With all our hope in "Another World,"\r\nwe have largely lost hope of this one.\r\n\r\nSome minds, still keen in the perception of better human possibilities,\r\nhave tried to write out their vision and give it to the world. From\r\nPlato\'s ideal Republic to Wells\' Day of the Comet we have had many\r\nUtopias set before us, best known of which are that of Sir Thomas More\r\nand the great modern instance, "Looking Backward."\r\n\r\nAll these have one or two distinctive features--an element of extreme\r\nremoteness, or the introduction of some mysterious outside force.\r\n"Moving the Mountain" is a short distance Utopia, a baby Utopia, a\r\nlittle one that can grow. It involves no other change than a change of\r\nmind, the mere awakening of people, especially the women, to existing\r\npossibilities. It indicates what people might do, real people, now\r\nliving, in thirty years--if they would.\r\n\r\nOne man, truly aroused and redirecting his energies, can change his\r\nwhole life in thirty years.\r\n\r\nSo can the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a gray, cold, soggy Tibetan plateau stood glaring at one another two\r\nwhite people--a man and a woman.\r\n\r\nWith the first, a group of peasants; with the second, the guides and\r\ncarriers of a well-equipped exploring party.\r\n\r\nThe man wore the dress of a peasant, but around him was a leather\r\nbelt--old, worn, battered--but a recognizable belt of no Asiatic\r\npattern, and showing a heavy buckle made in twisted initials.\r\n\r\nThe woman\'s eye had caught the sunlight on this buckle before she saw\r\nthat the heavily bearded face under the hood was white. She pressed\r\nforward to look at it.\r\n\r\n"Where did you get that belt?" she cried, turning for the interpreter to\r\nurge her question.\r\n\r\nThe man had caught her voice, her words. He threw back his hood and\r\nlooked at her, with a strange blank look, as of one listening to\r\nsomething far away.\r\n\r\n"John!" she cried. "John! My Brother!"\r\n\r\nHe lifted a groping hand to his head, made a confused noise that ended\r\nin almost a shout of "Nellie!" reeled and fell backward.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhen one loses his mind, as it were, for thirty years, and finds it\r\nagain; when one wakes up; comes to life; recognizes oneself an American\r\ncitizen twenty-five years old----\r\n\r\nNo. This is what I find it so hard to realize. I am not twenty-five; I\r\nam fifty-five.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying, when one comes to life again like this, and has\r\nto renew acquaintance with one\'s own mind, in a sudden swarming rush of\r\nhurrying memories--that is a good deal of pressure for a brain so long\r\nunused.\r\n\r\nBut when on top of that, one is pushed headlong into a world\r\nimmeasurably different from the world one has left at twenty-five--a\r\ntopsy-turvy world, wherein all one\'s most cherished ideals are found to\r\nbe reversed, re-arranged, or utterly gone; where strange new facts are\r\naccompanied by strange new thoughts and strange new feelings--the\r\npressure becomes terrific.\r\n\r\nNellie has suggested that I write it down, and I think for once she is\r\nright. I disagree with her on so many points that I am glad to recognize\r\nthe wisdom of this idea. It will certainly be a useful process in my\r\nre-education; and relieve the mental tension.\r\n\r\nSo, to begin with my first life, being now in my third----\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI am the only son of a Methodist minister of South Carolina. My mother\r\nwas a Yankee. She died after my sister Ellen was born, when I was seven\r\nyears old. My father educated me well. I was sent to a small Southern\r\ncollege, and showed such a talent for philology that I specialized in\r\nancient languages, and, after some teaching and the taking of various\r\ndegrees, I had a wonderful opportunity to join an expedition into India\r\nand Tibet. I was eager for a sight of those venerable races, those hoary\r\nscriptures, those time-honored customs.\r\n\r\nWe were traveling through the Himalayas--and the last thing I remember\r\nwas a night camp, and a six-months-old newspaper from home. We had\r\nrejoicingly obtained it from a party we met in the pass.\r\n\r\nIt was read and re-read by all of us--even the advertisements--even the\r\neditorials, and in one of these I learned that Mrs. Eddy had been dead\r\nsome time and that another religion had burst forth and was sweeping the\r\ncountry, madly taken up by the women. That was my last news item.\r\n\r\nI suppose it was this reading, and the discussions we had, that made me\r\nwalk in my sleep that night. That is the only explanation I can give. I\r\nknow I lay down just as I was--and that\'s all I know, until Nellie found\r\nme.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe party reported me lost. They searched for days, made what inquiry\r\nthey could. No faintest clue was ever found. Himalayan precipices are\r\nvery tall, and very sudden.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMy sister Nellie was traveling in Tibet and found me, with a party of\r\npeasants. She gathered what she could from them, through interpreters.\r\n\r\nIt seems that I fell among those people--literally; bruised, stunned,\r\nbroken, but not dead. Some merciful--or shall I say unmerciful?--trees\r\nhad softened the fall and let me down easy, comparatively speaking.\r\n\r\nThey were good people--Buddhists. They mended my bones and cared for me,\r\nand it appears made me quite a chief man, in course of time, in their\r\ntiny village. But their little valley was so remote and unknown, so out\r\nof touch with any and everything, that no tale of this dumb white man\r\never reached Western ears. I was dumb until I learned their language,\r\nwas "as a child of a day," they said--knew absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nThey taught me what they knew. I suppose I turned a prayer mill; I\r\nsuppose I was married--Nellie didn\'t ask that, and they never mentioned\r\nsuch a detail. Furthermore, they gave so dim an account of where the\r\nplace was that we don\'t know now; should have to locate that night\'s\r\nencampment, and then look for a precipice and go down it with ropes.\r\n\r\nAs I have no longer any interest in those venerable races and\r\ntime-honored customs, I think we will not do this.\r\n\r\nWell, she found me, and something happened. She says I knew her--shouted\r\n"Nellie!" and fell down--fell on a stone, too, and hit my head so hard\r\nthey thought I was dead this time "for sure." But when I "came to" I\r\ncame all the way, back to where I was thirty years ago; and as for those\r\nthirty years--I do not remember one day of them.\r\n\r\nNor do I wish to. I have those filthy Tibetan clothes, sterilized and\r\npacked away, but I never want to look at them.\r\n\r\nI am back in the real world, back where I was at twenty-five. But now I\r\nam fifty-five----\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNow, about Nellie. I must go slowly and get this thing straightened out\r\nfor good and all.\r\n\r\nMy little sister! I was always fond of her, and she adored me. She\r\nlooked up to me, naturally; believed everything I told her; minded me\r\nlike a little dog--when she was a child. And as she grew into girlhood,\r\nI had a strong restraining influence upon her. She wanted to be\r\neducated--to go to college--but father wouldn\'t hear of it, of course,\r\nand I backed him up. If there is anything on earth I always hated and\r\ndespised, it is a strong-minded woman! That is--it _was_. I certainly\r\ncannot hate and despise my sister Nellie.\r\n\r\nNow it appears that soon after my departure from this life father died,\r\nvery suddenly. Nellie inherited the farm--and the farm turned out to be\r\na mine, and the mine turned out to be worth a good deal of money.\r\n\r\nSo that poor child, having no natural guardian or protector, just set to\r\nwork for herself--went to college to her heart\'s content, to a foreign\r\nuniversity, too. She studied medicine, practiced a while, then was\r\noffered a chair in a college and took it; then--I hate to write it--but\r\nshe is now president of a college--_a co-educational college_!\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you mean \'dean?\'" I asked her.\r\n\r\n"No," she said. "There is a dean of the girl\'s building--but I am the\r\npresident."\r\n\r\nMy little sister!\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe worst of it is that my little sister is now forty-eight, and I--to\r\nall intents and purposes--am twenty-five! She is twenty-three years\r\nolder than I am. She has had thirty years of world-life which I have\r\nmissed entirely, and this thirty years, I begin to gather, has covered\r\nmore changes than an ordinary century or two.\r\n\r\nIt is lucky about that mine.\r\n\r\n"At least I shall not have to worry about money," I said to her when she\r\ntold me about our increased fortune.\r\n\r\nShe gave one of those queer little smiles, as if she had something up\r\nher sleeve, and said:\r\n\r\n"No; you won\'t have to worry in the least about money."\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nHaving all that medical skill of hers in the background, she took\r\nexcellent care of me up there on those dreary plains and hills, brought\r\nme back to the coast by easy stages, and home on one of those new\r\nsteamers--but I mustn\'t stop to describe the details of each new thing I\r\nnotice!\r\n\r\nI have sense enough myself, even if I\'m not a doctor, to use my mind\r\ngradually, not to swallow too fast, as it were.\r\n\r\nNellie is a little inclined to manage me. I don\'t know as I blame her. I\r\ndo feel like a child, sometimes. It is so humiliating not to know little\r\ncommon things such as everybody else knows. Air ships I expected, of\r\ncourse; they had started before I left. They are common enough, all\r\nsizes. But water is still the cheaper route--as well as slower.\r\n\r\nNellie said she didn\'t want me to get home too quick; she wanted time to\r\nexplain things. So we spent long, quiet hours in our steamer chairs,\r\ntalking things over.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no use asking about the family; there is only a flock of young\r\ncousins and "once removed" now; the aunts and uncles are mostly gone.\r\nUncle Jake is left. Nellie grins wickedly when she mentions him.\r\n\r\n"If things get too hard on you, John, you can go down to Uncle Jake\'s\r\nand rest up. He and Aunt Dorcas haven\'t moved an inch. They fairly\r\nbarricade their minds against a new idea--and he ploughs and she cooks\r\nup on that little mountain farm just as they always did. People go to\r\nsee them----"\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t they?" I asked. And she smiled that queer little smile\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"I mean they go to see them as if they were the Pyramids."\r\n\r\n"I see," said I. "I might as well prepare for some preposterous\r\nnightmare of a world, like--what was that book of Wells\', \'The Sleeper\r\nAwakened?\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I remember that book," she answered, "and a lot of others.\r\nPeople were already guessing about things as they might be, weren\'t\r\nthey? But what never struck any of them was that the people themselves\r\ncould change."\r\n\r\n"No," I agreed. "You can\'t alter human nature."\r\n\r\nNellie laughed--laughed out loud. Then she squeezed my hand and patted\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"You _Dear_!" she said. "You precious old Long-Lost Brother! When you\r\nget too utterly upset I\'ll wear my hair down, put on a short dress and\r\nlet you boss me awhile--to keep your spirits up. That was just the\r\nphrase, wasn\'t it?--\'You can\'t alter human nature!\'" And she laughed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThere is something queer about Nellie--very queer. It is not only that\r\nshe is different from my little sister--that\'s natural; but she is\r\ndifferent from any woman of forty-eight I ever saw--from any woman of\r\nany age I ever saw.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, she doesn\'t look _old_--not at all. Women of forty,\r\nin our region, were _old women_, and Nellie\'s near fifty! Then she\r\nisn\'t--what shall I call it--dependent; not the least in the world. As\r\nsoon as I became really conscious, and strong enough to be of any use,\r\nand began to offer her those little services and attentions due to a\r\nwoman, I noticed this difference.\r\n\r\nShe is brisk, firm, assured--not unpleasantly so; I don\'t mean a thing\r\nof that sort; but somehow like--almost like a man! No, I certainly don\'t\r\nmean that. She is not in the least mannish, nor in the least\r\nself-assertive; but she takes things so easily--as if she owned them.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI suppose it will be some time before my head is absolutely clear and\r\nstrong as it used to be. I tire rather easily. Nellie is very reassuring\r\nabout it. She says it will take about a year to re-establish connections\r\nand renew mental processes. She advises me to read and talk only a\r\nlittle every day, to sleep all I can, and not to worry.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be all right soon, my dear," she says, "and plenty of life\r\nbefore you. You seem to have led a very healthy out-door life. You\'re\r\nreally well and strong--and as good-looking as ever."\r\n\r\nAt least she hasn\'t forgotten that woman\'s chief duty is to please.\r\n\r\n"And the world is a much better place to have in than it was," she\r\nassured me. "Things will surprise you, of course--things I have gotten\r\nused to and shall forget to tell you about. But the changes are all good\r\nones, and you\'ll soon get--acclimated. You\'re young yet."\r\n\r\nThat\'s where Nellie slips up. She cannot help having me in mind as the\r\nbrave young brother she knew. She forgets that I am an old man now.\r\nFinally I told her that.\r\n\r\n"No, John Robertson," she says, "that\'s where you are utterly wrong. Of\r\ncourse, you don\'t know what we\'re doing about age--how differently we\r\nfeel. As a matter of physiology we find that about one hundred and fifty\r\nought to be our natural limit; and that with proper conditions we can\r\neasily get to be a hundred now. Ever so many do."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to be a hundred," I protested. "I saw a man of\r\nninety-eight once, and never want to be one."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not like that now," she said. "I mean we live to be a hundred and\r\nenjoy life still--\'keep our faculties,\' as they used to put it. Why, the\r\nship\'s doctor here is eighty-seven."\r\n\r\nThis surprised me a good deal. I had talked a little with this man, and\r\nhad thought him about sixty.\r\n\r\n"Then a man of a hundred, according to your story, would look\r\nlike--like----"\r\n\r\n"Like Grandpa Ely," she offered.\r\n\r\nI remembered my mother\'s father--a tall, straight, hale old man of\r\nseventy-five. He had a clear eye, a firm step, a rosy color in his face.\r\nWell, that wasn\'t so bad a prospect.\r\n\r\n"I consent to be a hundred--on those terms," I told her.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nShe talked to me a good bit, in small daily doses, of the more general\r\nchanges in the world, showed me new maps, even let me read a little in\r\nthe current magazines.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have a million of these now," I said. "There were\r\nthousands when I left!"\r\n\r\n"No," she answered. "There are fewer, I believe; but much better."\r\n\r\nI turned over the one in my hand. It was pleasantly light and thin, it\r\nopened easily, the paper and presswork were of the best, the price was\r\ntwenty-five cents.\r\n\r\n"Is this a cheap one--at a higher price? or have the best ones come\r\ndown?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a cheap one," she told me, "if you mean by that a popular one, and\r\nit\'s cheap enough. They have all of a million subscribers."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s the difference, beyond the paper and print?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"The pictures are good."\r\n\r\nI looked it through again.\r\n\r\n"Yes, very good, much improved. But I don\'t see anything\r\nphenomenal--unless it is the absence of advertisements."\r\n\r\nNellie took it out of my hand and ran it over.\r\n\r\n"Just read some of that," she said. "Read this story--and this\r\narticle--and that."\r\n\r\nSo I sat reading in the sunny silence, the gulls wheeling and dipping\r\njust as they used to, and the wide purple ocean just as changeable--and\r\nchangeless--as ever.\r\n\r\nOne of the articles was on an extension of municipal service, and\r\ninvolved so much comment on preceding steps that I found it most\r\nenlightening. The other was a recent suggestion in educational\r\npsychology, and this too carried a retrospect of recent progress which\r\ngave me food for thought. The story was a clever one. I found it really\r\namusing, and only on a second reading did I find what it was that gave\r\nthe queer flavor to it. It was a story about women--two women who were\r\nin business partnership, with their adventures, singly and together.\r\n\r\nI looked through it carefully. They were not even girls, they were not\r\nhandsome, they were not in process of being married--in fact, it was not\r\nonce mentioned whether they were married or not, ever had been or ever\r\nwanted to be. Yet I had found it amusing!\r\n\r\nI laid the magazine on my rug-bound knees and meditated. A queer sick\r\nfeeling came over me--mental, not physical. I looked through the\r\nmagazine again. It was not what I should have called "a woman\'s\r\nmagazine," yet the editor was a woman, most of the contributors were\r\nwomen, and in all the subject matter I began to detect allusions and\r\nreferences of tremendous import.\r\n\r\nPresently Nellie came to see how I was getting on. I saw her\r\napproaching, a firm, brisk figure, well and becomingly dressed, with a\r\ntailored trimness and convenience, far indeed from the slim, graceful,\r\nyielding girl I had once been so proud to protect and teach.\r\n\r\n"How soon do we get in, Lady Manager?" I asked her.\r\n\r\n"Day after to-morrow," she answered back promptly--not a word about\r\ngoing to see, or asking anyone!\r\n\r\n"Well, ma\'am, I want you to sit down here and tell me things--right now.\r\nWhat am I to expect? Are there _no_ men left in America?"\r\n\r\nShe laughed gaily.\r\n\r\n"No men! Why, bless you, there are as many men as there are women, and a\r\nfew more, I believe. Not such an over-plus as there used to be, but some\r\nto spare still. We had a million and a half extra in your day, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to learn we\'re allowed to live!" said I. "Now tell me the\r\nworst--are the men all doing the housework?"\r\n\r\n"You call that \'the worst,\' do you?" inquired Nellie, cocking her head\r\nto one side and looking at me affectionately, and yet quizzically.\r\n"Well, I guess it was--pretty near \'the worst!\' No dear, men are doing\r\njust as many kinds of business as they ever were."\r\n\r\nI heaved a sigh of relief and chucked my magazine under the chair.\r\n\r\n"I\'d begun to think there weren\'t any men left. And they still wear\r\ntrousers, don\'t they?"\r\n\r\nShe laughed outright.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. They wear just as many trousers as they did before."\r\n\r\n"And what do the women wear," I demanded suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"Whatever kind of clothing their work demands," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Their work? What kind of work do they do?"\r\n\r\n"All kinds--anything they like."\r\n\r\nI groaned and shut my eyes. I could see the world as I left it, with\r\nonly a small proportion of malcontents and a large majority of contented\r\nand happy homes; and then I saw this awful place I was coming to, with\r\nstrange, masculine women and subdued men.\r\n\r\n"How does it happen that there aren\'t any on this ship?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"Any what?" asked Nellie.\r\n\r\n"Any of these--New Women?"\r\n\r\n"Why, there are. They\'re all new, except Mrs. Talbot. She\'s older than I\r\nam, and rather reactionary."\r\n\r\nThis Mrs. Talbot was a stiff, pious, narrow-minded old lady, and I had\r\nliked her the least of any on board.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me that pretty Mrs. Exeter is--one of this new\r\nkind?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Exeter owns--and manages--a large store, if that is what you\r\nmean."\r\n\r\n"And those pretty Borden girls?"\r\n\r\n"They do house decorating--have been abroad on business."\r\n\r\n"And Mrs. Green--and Miss Sandwich?"\r\n\r\n"One of them is a hat designer, one a teacher. This is toward the end of\r\nvacation, and they\'re all coming home, you see."\r\n\r\n"And Miss Elwell?"\r\n\r\nMiss Elwell was quite the prettiest woman on board, and seemed to have\r\nplenty of attention--just like the girls I remembered.\r\n\r\n"Miss Elwell is a civil engineer," said my sister.\r\n\r\n"It\'s horrid," I said. "It\'s perfectly horrid! And aren\'t there any\r\nwomen left?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s Aunt Dorcas," said Nellie, mischievously, "and Cousin Drusilla.\r\nYou remember Drusilla?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day after to-morrow! I was to see it the day after to-morrow--this\r\nstrange, new, abhorrent world!\r\n\r\nThe more I considered what bits of information I had gleaned already,\r\nthe more I disliked what lay before me. In the first blazing light of\r\nreturned memory and knowledge, the first joy of meeting my sister, the\r\nhope of seeing home again, I had not distinguished very sharply between\r\nwhat was new to my bewildered condition and what was new indeed--new to\r\nthe world as well as to me. But now a queer feeling of disproportion and\r\nunreality began to haunt me.\r\n\r\nAs my head cleared, and such knowledge as I was now gathering began to\r\nhelp towards some sense of perspective and relation, even my immediate\r\nsurroundings began to assume a sinister importance.\r\n\r\nAny change, to any person, is something of a shock, though sometimes a\r\nbeneficial one. Changes too sudden, and too great, are hard to bear, for\r\nany one. But who can understand the peculiar horror of my unparalleled\r\nexperience?\r\n\r\nSlowly the thing took shape in my mind.\r\n\r\nThere was the first, irrevocable loss--my life!\r\n\r\nThirty years--_the_ thirty years in which a man may really live--these\r\nwere gone from me forever.\r\n\r\nI was coming back; strong to be sure; well enough in health; even, I\r\nhoped, with my old mental vigor--_but not to the same world_.\r\n\r\nEven the convict who survives thirty years imprisonment, may return at\r\nlength to the same kind of world he had left so long.\r\n\r\nBut I! It was as if I had slept, and, in my sleep, they had stolen my\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nI threw off the thought, and started in to action.\r\n\r\nHere was a small world--the big steamer beneath me. I had already\r\nlearned much about her. In the first place, she was not a "steamer," but\r\na thing for which I had no name; her power was electric.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well," I thought, as I examined her machinery, "this I might have\r\nexpected. Thirty years of such advances as we were making in 1910 were\r\nsure to develop electric motors of all sorts."\r\n\r\nThe engineer was a pleasant, gentlemanly fellow, more than willing to\r\ntalk about his profession and its marvellous advances. The ship was well\r\nmanned, certainly; though the work required was far less than it used to\r\nbe, the crew were about as numerous. I had made some acquaintances among\r\nthe ship\'s officers--even among the men, who were astonishingly civil\r\nand well-mannered--but I had not at first noticed the many points of\r\nnovelty in their attitude or in my surroundings.\r\n\r\nNow I paced the deck and considered the facts I had observed--the\r\nperfect ventilation of the vessel, the absence of the smell of cooking\r\nand of bilge water, the dainty convenience and appropriate beauty of all\r\nthe fittings and furnishings, the smooth speed and steadiness of her.\r\n\r\nThe quarters of the crew I found as remarkable as anything else about\r\nthe vessel; indeed the forecastle and steerage differed more from what I\r\nremembered than from any other part. Every person on board had a clean\r\nand comfortable lodging, though there were grades of distinction in size\r\nand decoration. But any gentleman could have lived in that "foks\'le"\r\nwithout discomfort. Indeed, I soon found that many gentlemen did. I\r\ndiscovered, quite by accident, that one of the crew was a Harvard man.\r\nHe was not at all loath to talk of it, either--was evidently no black\r\nsheep of any sort.\r\n\r\nWhy had he chosen this work?\r\n\r\nOh, he wanted the experience--it widened life, knowing different trades.\r\n\r\nWhy was he not an officer then?\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t care to work at it long enough--this was only experience work,\r\nyou see.\r\n\r\nI did not see, nor ask, but I inferred, and it gave me again that\r\nfeeling as if the ground underfoot had wiggled slightly.\r\n\r\nWas that old dream of Bellamy\'s stalking abroad? Were young men\r\nportioned out to menial service, willy-nilly?\r\n\r\nIt was evidently not a universal custom, for some of the sailors were\r\nmuch older men, and long used to the business. I got hold of one who\r\nseemed more like the deckhands of old days, though cleaner and more\r\ncheerful; a man who was all of sixty.\r\n\r\nYes he had followed the sea from boyhood. Yes, he liked it, always had\r\nliked it, liked it better now than when he was young.\r\n\r\nHe had seen many changes? I listened carefully, though I asked the\r\nquestion lightly enough.\r\n\r\nChanges! He guessed he had. Terbacca was better for one thing--I was\r\nrelieved to see that men still smoked, and then the jar came again as I\r\nremembered that save for this man, and one elderly officer, I had not\r\nseen anyone smoking on the vessel.\r\n\r\n"How do you account for it?" I asked the old Yankee. "For tobacco\'s\r\nbeing better?"\r\n\r\nHe grinned cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"Less run on it, I guess," said he. "Young fellers don\'t seem to smoke\r\nno more, and I ain\'t seen nobody chewing for--well, for ten years back."\r\n\r\n"Is it cheaper as well as better?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, it ain\'t. It\'s perishing high. But then, wages is high, too,"\r\nhe grudgingly admitted.\r\n\r\n"Better tobacco and better wages--anything else improved?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir-ee! Grub\'s better, by square miles--and \'commodations--an\'\r\nclose. Make better stuff now.\r\n\r\n"Well! well!" said I as genially as I knew how. "That\'s very different\r\nfrom my young days. Then everybody older than I always complained about\r\nall manner of things, and told how much better--and cheaper--things were\r\nwhen they were young."\r\n\r\n"Yes, \'twas so," he admitted meditatively. "But \'tain\'t so now. Shoes is\r\nbetter, most things is better, I guess. Seems like water runnin\' up\r\nhill, don\'t it, sir?"\r\n\r\nIt did. I didn\'t like it. I got away from the old man, and walked by\r\nmyself--like Kipling\'s cat.\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course!" I said to myself impatiently, "I may as well\r\nexpect to find everything as much improved from what it was in my time\r\nas in, say, sixty years before. That sort of progress goes faster and\r\nfaster. Things change, but people--"\r\n\r\nAnd here is where I got this creepy sense of unreality.\r\n\r\nAt first everything was so strange to me, and my sister was so kind and\r\nthoughtful, so exquisitely considerate of my feelings and condition,\r\nthat I had failed to notice this remarkable circumstance--so were the\r\nother people. It was like being in a--well, in a house-party of very\r\nnice persons. Kind, cheerful, polite--here I suddenly realized that I\r\nhad not seen a grouchy face, heard an unkind remark, felt, as one does\r\nfeel through silk and broadcloth, the sense of discontent and\r\ndisapproval.\r\n\r\nThere was one, the somewhat hard-faced old lady, Mrs. Talbot, of whom I\r\nhad hopes. I sought her, and laid myself out to please her by those\r\nlittle attentions which are so grateful to an elderly woman from a young\r\nman.\r\n\r\nHer accepting these as a commonplace, her somewhat too specific\r\ninquiries about my health, suddenly reminded me that I was not a young\r\nman----\r\n\r\nShe talked on while I made again that effort at readjustment which was\r\nso hideously hard. Gone in a night--all my young manhood--gone untasted!\r\n\r\n"Do you find it difficult to concentrate your attention?" she was\r\nsaying, a steely eye fixed upon my face.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, madam. I fear I do. You were saying--"\r\n\r\n"I was saying that you will find many changes when you get back."\r\n\r\n"I find them already, Mrs. Talbot. They rather loom up. It is sudden,\r\nyou see."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you\'ve been away a long time, I understand. In the far East?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Talbot was the first person who had asked me a question. Evidently\r\nhers were the manners of an older generation, and for once I had to\r\nadmit that the younger generation had improved.\r\n\r\nBut I recalled the old defensive armor against the old assaults.\r\n\r\n"Quite a while," I answered cheerfully, "Quite a while. Now what should\r\nyou think would impress me most--in the way of change?"\r\n\r\n"The women," she answered promptly.\r\n\r\nI smiled my gallantest, and replied, bowing:\r\n\r\n"I find them still charming."\r\n\r\nHer set face broke into a pleased smile.\r\n\r\n"You do my heart good!" she cried. "I haven\'t heard a compliment in\r\nfifteen years."\r\n\r\n"Good Heavens, madam! what are our men thinking of?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not the men\'s fault; it\'s the women\'s. They won\'t have it."\r\n\r\n"Are there many of these--new women?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing else--except a few old ones like me."\r\n\r\nI hastened to assure her that a woman like her would never be called\r\nold--and she looked as pleased as a girl.\r\n\r\nPresently I excused myself and left her, with relief. It was annoying\r\nbeyond measure to have the only specimen of the kind of woman I used to\r\nlike turn out to be personally the kind I never liked.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite deck, I found Miss Elwell--and for once alone. A\r\nretiring back, wearing an aggrieved expression showed that it had not\r\nbeen for long.\r\n\r\n"May I join you, Miss Elwell?"\r\n\r\nI might. I did. We paced up and down, silent for a bit.\r\n\r\nShe was a joy to the eye, a lovely, straight, young thing, with a fresh,\r\npure color and eyes of dancing brightness. I spoke of this and that\r\naboard ship--the sea, the weather; and she was so gaily friendly, so\r\nsweet and modest, yet wholly frank, that I grew quite happy in her\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nMy sister must have been mistaken about her being a civil engineer. She\r\nmight be a college girl--but nothing worse. And she was so pretty!\r\n\r\nI devoted myself to Miss Elwell \'till she took herself off, probably to\r\njoin her--her--it occurred to me that I had seen no one with Miss\r\nElwell.\r\n\r\n"Nellie," said I, "for heaven\'s sake give me the straight of all this.\r\nI\'m going distracted with the confusion. What has happened to the world?\r\nTell me all, I can bear it--as the extinct novels used to say. But I\r\ncannot bear this terrible suspense! Don\'t you have novels any more?"\r\n\r\n"Novels? Oh, yes, plenty; better than ever were written. You\'ll find it\r\nsplendidly worth while to read quite a few of them while you\'re getting\r\noriented . . . Well, you want a kind of running, historic sketch?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Give me the outlines--just the heads, as it were. You see, my\r\ndear, it is not easy to get readjusted even to the old things, and there\r\nare so many new ones----"\r\n\r\nWe were in our steamer chairs, most people dozing after their midday\r\nmeal. She reached over and took my hand in hers, and held it tight. It\r\nwas marvelously comforting, this one live visible link between what was\r\nforever past and this uncertain future. But for her, even those old, old\r\ndays might have flickered and seemed doubtful--I should have felt like\r\none swimming under water and not knowing, which way was up. She gave me\r\nsolid ground underfoot at any rate. Whatever her place might be in this\r\nNew World, she had talked to me only of the old one.\r\n\r\nIn these long, quiet, restful days, she had revived in my mind the\r\npleasant memories of our childhood together; our little Southern home;\r\nour patient, restrained Northern mother and the fine education she gave\r\nher school-less little ones; our high-minded--and, alas,\r\nnarrow-minded--father, handsome, courteous, inflexible. Under Nellie\'s\r\ngentle leading, my long unused memory-cells had revived like rain-washed\r\nleaves, and my past life had, at last, grown clear and steady.\r\n\r\nMy college life; my old chum, Granger, who had visited us once; our\r\nneighbors and relations; little gold-haired Cousin Drusilla, whom I, in\r\nten years proud seniority, had teased as a baby, played with and\r\ntyrannized over as a confiding child, and kissed good-bye--a slim,\r\nstartled little figure--when I left for Asia.\r\n\r\nNellie had always spoken of things as I remembered them, and avoided\r\nadroitly, or quietly refused to discuss, their new aspects.\r\n\r\nI think she was right--at first.\r\n\r\n"Out with it!" said I. "Come--Have we adopted Socialism?" I braced\r\nmyself for the answer.\r\n\r\n"Socialism? Oh--why, yes. I think we did. But that was twenty years\r\nago."\r\n\r\n"And it didn\'t last? You\'ve proved the impracticable folly of it? You\'ve\r\ndiscarded it?"\r\n\r\nI sat up straight, very eager.\r\n\r\n"Why, no--" said Nellie. "It\'s very hard to put these new things into\r\nold words--We\'ve got beyond it."\r\n\r\n"Beyond Socialism! Not--not--Anarchy?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, bless you, no; no indeed! We understand better what socialism\r\nmeant, that\'s all. We have more, much more, than it ever asked; but we\r\ndon\'t call it that."\r\n\r\nI did not understand.\r\n\r\n"It\'s like this," she said. "Suppose you had left a friend in the throes\r\nof a long, tempestuous\' courtship, full of ardor, of keen joy, and\r\nkeener anticipation. Then, returning, you say to your friend, \'Do you\r\nstill have courtship?\' And he says, \'Why no, I\'m married.\' It\'s not that\r\nhe has discarded it, proved it\'s impracticable folly. He had to have\r\nit--he liked it--but he\'s got beyond it."\r\n\r\n"Go on and elucidate," I said. "I don\'t quite follow your parable."\r\n\r\nShe considered a bit.\r\n\r\n"Well, here\'s a more direct parallel. Back in the 18th century, the\r\nworld was wild about Democracy--Democracy was going to do all things for\r\nall men. Then, with prodigious struggles, they acquired some\r\nDemocracy--set it going. It was a good thing. But it took time. It grew.\r\nIt had difficulties. In the next century, there was less talk about all\r\nthe heavenly results of Democracy, and more definite efforts to make it\r\nwork."\r\n\r\nThis was clearer.\r\n\r\n"You mean," I followed her slowly. "That what was called socialism was\r\nattained--and you\'ve been improving upon it?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly, Brother, \'you are on\'--as we used to say. But even that\'s not\r\nthe main step."\r\n\r\n"No? What else?"\r\n\r\n"Only a New Religion."\r\n\r\nI showed my disappointment. Nellie watched my face silently. She\r\nlaughed. She even kissed me.\r\n\r\n"John," said she, "I could make vast sums by exhibiting you to\r\npsychologists! as An Extinct Species of Mind. You\'d draw better than a\r\nWoolly Mammoth."\r\n\r\nI smiled wryly; and she squeezed my hand. "Might as well make a joke of\r\nit, Old Man--you\'ve got to get used to it, and \'the sooner the\r\nquicker!\'"\r\n\r\n"All right--Go ahead with your New Religion."\r\n\r\nShe sat back in her chair with an expression of amused retrospection.\r\n\r\n"I had forgotten," she said, "I had really forgotten. We didn\'t use to\r\nthink much of religion, did we?"\r\n\r\n"Father did," said I.\r\n\r\n"No, not even Father and his kind--they only used it as a--what was the\r\nold joke? a patent fire escape! Nobody appreciated Religion!"\r\n\r\n"They spent much time and money on it," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"_That\'s_ not appreciation!"\r\n\r\n"Well, come on with the story. Did you have another Incarnation of any\r\nbody?"\r\n\r\n"You might call it that," Nellie allowed, her voice growing quietly\r\nearnest, "We certainly had somebody with an unmistakable Power."\r\n\r\nThis did not interest me at all. I hated to see Nellie looking so\r\nsweetly solemn over her "New Religion." In the not unnatural reaction of\r\na minister\'s son, rigidly reared, I had had small use for religion of\r\nany sort. As a scholar I had studied them all, and felt as little\r\nreverence for the ancient ones as for the shifty mushroom crop of new\r\nsects and schools of thought with which the country teemed in my time.\r\n\r\n"Now, look here, John," said she at length, "I\'ve been watching you\r\npretty closely and I think you\'re equal to a considerable mental\r\neffort--In one way, it may be easier for you, just because you\'ve not\r\nseen a bit of it--anyhow, you\'ve got to face it--\r\n\r\n"Our world has changed in these thirty years, more than the change\r\nbetween what it used to be and what people used to imagine about Heaven.\r\nHere is the first thing you\'ve got to do--mentally. You must understand,\r\nclearly, in your human consciousness, that the objection and distaste\r\nyou feel is only in your personal consciousness. Everything is better;\r\nthere is far more comfort, pleasure, peace of mind; a richer, swifter\r\ngrowth, a higher happier life in every way; and yet, you won\'t like it\r\nbecause your--" she seemed to hesitate for a word, now and then; as one\r\ntrying to translate, "reactions are all tuned to earlier conditions. If\r\nyou can understand this and see over your own personal--attitudes it\r\nwill not be long before a real convincing _sense_ of joy, of life, will\r\nfollow the intellectual perception that things are better."\r\n\r\n"Hold on," I said, "Let me chew on that a little."\r\n\r\n"As if," I presently suggested, "as if I\'d left a home that was poor and\r\ndirty and crowded, with a pair of quarrelsome inefficient\r\nparents--drunken and abusive, maybe, and a lot of horrid, wrangling,\r\nselfish, little brothers and sisters--and woke up one fine morning in a\r\ngreat clean beautiful house--richly furnished--full of a lot of\r\nangels--who were total strangers?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly!" she cried. "Hurrah for you, Johnnie, you couldn\'t have\r\ndefined it better."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it," said I. "I\'d rather have my old home and my own\r\nfamily than all the princely palaces and amiable angels you could dream\r\nof in a hundred years."\r\n\r\n"Mother had an old story-book by a New England author," Nellie quietly\r\nremarked, "where somebody said, \'You can\'t always have your\r\n"druthers"\'--she used to quote it to me when I was little and complained\r\nthat things were not as I wanted them. John, dear, please remember that\r\nthe new people in the new world find it \'like home\' and love it far\r\nbetter than we used to. It\'ll be queer to you, but it\'s a pleasant\r\ncommonplace to them. We have found out at last that it is natural to be\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\nShe was silent and I was silent; till I asked her "What\'s the name of\r\nyour new religion?"\r\n\r\n"It hasn\'t any," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t any? What do they call it? the Believers, I mean?"\r\n\r\n"They call it \'Living\' and \'Life\'--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Hm! and what\'s their specialty?"\r\n\r\nNellie gave a funny little laugh, part sad, part tender, part amused.\r\n\r\n"I had no idea it would be so hard to tell you things," she said.\r\n"You\'ll have to just see for yourself, I guess."\r\n\r\n"Do go on, Nellie. I\'ll be good. You were going to tell me, in a\r\nnutshell, what had happened--please do."\r\n\r\n"The thing that has happened," said she, slowly, "is just this. The\r\nworld has come alive. We are doing in a pleasant, practical way, all the\r\nthings which we could have done, at any time before--only we never\r\nthought so. The real change is this: we have changed our minds. This\r\nhappened very soon after you left. Ah! that was a time! To think that\r\nyou should have missed it!" She gave my hand another sympathetic squeeze\r\nand went on. "After that it was only a question of time, of how soon we\r\ncould do things. And we\'ve been doing them ever since, faster and\r\nfaster."\r\n\r\nThis seemed rather flat and disappointing.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that you make out anything wonderful--so far. A new\r\nReligion which seems to consist only in behaving better; and a gradual\r\nimprovement of social conditions--all that was going on when I left."\r\n\r\nNellie regarded me with a considering eye. "I see how you interpret it,"\r\nshe said, "behaving better in our early days was a small personal\r\naffair; either a pathetically inadequate failure to do what one could\r\nnot, or a Pharisaic, self-righteous success in doing what one could. All\r\npersonal--personal!"\r\n\r\n"Good behavior has to be a personal affair, hasn\'t it?" I mildly\r\nprotested.\r\n\r\n"Not by any means!" said Nellie with decision. "That was precisely what\r\nkept us so small and bad, so miserably confined and discouraged. Like a\r\nlot of well-meaning soldiers imagining that their evolutions were \'a\r\npersonal affair\'--or an orchestra plaintively protesting that if each\r\nman played a correct tune of his own choosing, the result would be\r\nperfect! Dear! dear! No, _Sir_," she continued with some fierceness,\r\n"that\'s just where we changed our minds! Humanity has come alive, I tell\r\nyou and we have reason to be proud of our race!"\r\n\r\nShe held her head high, there was a glad triumphant look in her\r\neyes--not in the least religious. Said she:\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see results. That will make it clearer to you than anything I\r\ncan say. But if I may remark that we have no longer the fear of\r\ndeath--much less of damnation, and no such thing as \'sin\'; that the only\r\nkind of prison left is called a quarantine--that punishment is unknown\r\nbut preventive means are of a drastic and sweeping nature such as we\r\nnever dared think of before--that there is no such thing in the\r\ncivilized world as poverty--no labor problem--no color problem--no sex\r\nproblem--almost no disease--very little accident--practically no\r\nfires--that the world is rapidly being reforested--the soil improved;\r\nthe output growing in quantity and quality; that no one needs to work\r\nover two hours a day and most people work four--that we have no\r\ngraft--no adulteration of goods--no malpractice--no crime."\r\n\r\n"Nellie," said I, "you are a woman and my sister. I\'m very sorry, but I\r\ndon\'t believe it."\r\n\r\n"I thought you wouldn\'t," said she. Women always will have the last\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blue shore line of one\'s own land always brings a thrill of the\r\nheart; to me, buried exile as I had been, the heart-leap was choking.\r\n\r\nOurs was a slow steamer, and we did not stop at Montauk where the mail\r\nand the swiftest travelers landed, nor in Jamaica Harbor with the\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\nAs we swept along the sunny, level spaces of the South shore, Nellie\r\ntold me how Long Island was now the "Reception Room" of our country,\r\ninstead of poor, brutal little Ellis Island.\r\n\r\n"The shores are still mostly summer places," she said. "One of the most\r\nconvincing of our early lines of advance was started on the South shore;\r\nand there are plenty of Country Clubs, Home Parks and things like that;\r\nbut the bulk of the island toward the western end is an experiment\r\nstation in applied sociology."\r\n\r\nI was watching the bright shore hungrily. With a glass I could see many\r\nlarge buildings, not too closely set.\r\n\r\n"I should think it would spoil the place for homes," I said.\r\n\r\nNellie had a way of listening to my remarks, kindly and pleasantly, but\r\nas if I were somehow a long way off and she was trying to grasp what I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"In a way it did--at first;" she explained presently, "but even then it\r\nmeant just as many homes for other people, and now it means so much\r\nmore!"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment and then plunged in resolutely.\r\n\r\n"You\'re in for a steady course of instructive remarks from now on.\r\nEverybody will be explaining things and bragging about them. We haven\'t\r\noutgrown some of the smaller vices, you see. As to this \'Immigration\r\nProblem\'--we woke up to this fact among others, that the \'reintegration\r\nof peoples\' as Ward called it, was a sociological process not possible\r\nto stop, but quite possible to assist and to guide to great advantage.\r\nAnd here in America we recognized our own special place--\'the melting\r\npot,\' you know?"\r\n\r\nYes, I remembered the phrase, I never liked it. Our family were pure\r\nEnglish stock, and rightly proud of their descent.\r\n\r\n"I begin to see, my dear sister, that while receiving the torrent of\r\ninstructive remarks you foretell, the way of wisdom for me is\r\nsteadfastly to withhold my own opinions."\r\n\r\nNellie laughed appreciatively.\r\n\r\n"You always had a long head, John. Well, whether you like it or not, our\r\npeople saw their place and power at last and rose to it. We refuse no\r\none. We have discovered as many ways of utilizing human waste as we used\r\nto have for the waste products of coal tar."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say idiots and criminals?" I protested.\r\n\r\n"Idiots, hopeless ones, we don\'t keep any more," she answered gently.\r\n"They are very rare now. The grade of average humanity is steadily\r\nrising; and we have the proud satisfaction of knowing we have helped it\r\nrise. We organized a permanent \'reception committee\' for the whole\r\ncountry, one station here and one in California. Anybody could come--but\r\nthey had to submit to our handling when they did come."\r\n\r\n"We used to have physical examination, didn\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"A rudimentary one. What we have now is Compulsory Socialization."\r\n\r\nI stared at her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know! You are thinking of that geological kind of evolution\r\npeople used to talk about, and \'you can\'t alter human nature.\' In the\r\nfirst place, we can. In the second place, we do. In the third place,\r\nthere isn\'t so much alteration needed as we used to think. Human nature\r\nis a pretty good thing. No immigrant is turned loose on the community\r\ntill he or she is up to a certain standard, and the children we\r\neducate."\r\n\r\n"We always did, didn\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Always did? Why brother, we didn\'t know what the word meant in your\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"I shall be glad to follow that up," I assured her. "Education was\r\nimproving even in the old days, I remember. I shall be glad to see the\r\nschools."\r\n\r\n"Some of them you won\'t know when you do see them," said Nellie. "On\r\nLong Island we have agricultural and industrial stations like--like--I\r\nthink we had something like it in some of our Western colleges, which it\r\nwas the fashion to look down upon. We have a graded series of dwellings\r\nwhere the use of modern conveniences is taught to all newcomers."\r\n\r\n"Suppose they won\'t learn? They used to prefer to live like hogs, as I\r\nremember."\r\n\r\nAgain Nellie looked at me as if I were speaking to her from a distance.\r\n\r\n"We used to say so--and I suppose we used to think so--some of us. But\r\nwe know better now. These people are not compelled to come to our\r\ncountry, but if they come they know what they have to do--and they do\r\nit. You may have noticed that we have no \'steerage.\'"\r\n\r\nI had noticed it.\r\n\r\n"They have decent surroundings from the first step. They have to be\r\nantiseptically clean, they and all their belongings, before entering the\r\nship."\r\n\r\n"But what an awful expense!" I ventured.\r\n\r\n"Suppose you keep cattle, John, and knew how to fatten and improve them;\r\nand suppose your ranch was surrounded by strays--mavericks--anxious to\r\ncome in. Would you call it \'an expense\' to add to your herd?"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t sell people."\r\n\r\n"No, but you can profit by their labor."\r\n\r\n"That sounds like the same old game. I should think your Socialism would\r\nhave put an end to that."\r\n\r\n"Socialism, did not alter the fact that wealth comes by labor," she\r\nreplied. "All these people work. We provide the opportunity for them, we\r\ntrain them to higher efficiency, especially the children. The very best\r\nand wisest of us are proud to serve there--as women used to be proud\r\nwhen they were invited \'to help receive\' some personage. We receive\r\nHumanity--and introduce it to America. What they produce is used to\r\ncover the expense of their training, and also to lay up a surplus for\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\n"They must produce more than they used to," observed I drily.\r\n\r\n"They do," said Nellie.\r\n\r\n"You might as well finish this thing up," I said. "Then when people talk\r\nto me about immigration, I can look intelligent and say, \'I know about\r\nthat.\' And really, I\'m interested. How do you begin with \'em?"\r\n\r\n"When they come into Jamaica Harbor they see a great crescent of white\r\npiers, each with its gate. We\'ll go and see it some day--splendid arches\r\nwith figures on them, like the ones they used to put up for Triumphs.\r\nThere\'s the German Gate and the Spanish Gate, the English Gate, the\r\nItalian Gate--and so on. There is welcome in their own language--and\r\ninstruction in ours. There is physical examination--the most searching\r\nand thorough--microscopic--chemical. They have to come up to a certain\r\nstandard before they are graduated, you see."\r\n\r\n"Graduated?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. We have a standard of citizenship now--an idea of what people\r\nought to be and how to make them so. Dear me! To think that you don\'t\r\nknow about that--"\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t think they\'d stand for it--all this examination and so on."\r\n\r\n"No country on earth offers so much happiness to its people. Nowhere\r\nelse--yet--is there as good opportunity to be helped up, to have real\r\nscientific care, real loving study and assistance! Everybody likes to be\r\nmade the most of! Everybody--nearly--has the feeling that they might be\r\nsomething better if they had a chance! We give them the chance."\r\n\r\n"Then I should think you\'d have all creation on your hands at once."\r\n\r\n"And depopulate the other nations? They had something to say about that!\r\nYou see this worked all sorts of ways. In the first place, when we got\r\nall the worst and lowest people, that left an average of better ones at\r\nhome--people who could learn more quickly. When we proved what good\r\nstuff human nature was, rightly treated, they all took heart of grace\r\nand began to improve their own. Then, as our superior attractions\r\nsteadily drew off \'the lower classes,\' that raised the value of those\r\nwho remained. They were better paid, better thought of at home. As more\r\nand more people came to us, the other nations got rather alarmed, and\r\nbegan to establish counter attractions--to keep their folks at home.\r\nAlso, many other nations had some better things than we did, you\r\nremember. And finally most people love their own country better than any\r\nother, no matter how good. No, the balance of population is not\r\nseriously altered."\r\n\r\n"Still, with such an influx of low-grade people you must have a\r\nMalthusian torrent of increasing population on your hands."\r\n\r\nAgain that odd listening look, her head a little on one side.\r\n\r\n"I have to keep remembering," she said. "Have to recall what people\r\nwrote and said and thought in the past generation. The idea was that\r\npeople had to increase like rabbits, and would eat up the food supply,\r\nso wars and pestilences and all manner of cruel conditions were\r\nnecessary to \'keep down the population.\' Wasn\'t that it?"\r\n\r\n"You are twenty years out, my dear!" I rejoiced to assure her. "We had\r\nlargely passed that, and were beginning to worry about the decreasing\r\nbirth rate--among the more intelligent. It was only the lowest grade\r\nthat kept on \'like rabbits\' as you say. But it\'s that sort you seem to\r\nhave been filling in with. I should think it would have materially\r\nlowered the average. Or have you, in this new \'forcing system,\' made\r\ndecent people out of scrubs?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly what we\'ve done; we\'ve improved the people and lowered\r\nthe birthrate at one stroke!"\r\n\r\n"They were beginning to talk eugenics when I left."\r\n\r\n"This is not eugenics--we have made great advances in that, of course;\r\nbut the chief factor in this change is a common biological\r\nlaw--\'individuation is in inverse proportion to reproduction,\' you know.\r\nWe individualize the women--develop their personal power, their human\r\ncharacteristics--and they don\'t have so many children."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how that helps unless you have eliminated the brutality of\r\nmen."\r\n\r\n"My dear brother, the brutality of men _lowered_ the birthrate--it\r\ndidn\'t raise it! One of those undifferentiated peasant women would have\r\na baby every year if she was married to a saint--and she couldn\'t have\r\nmore in polyandry--unless it were twins! No, the birthrate was for women\r\nto settle--and they have."\r\n\r\n"Out of fashion to have children at all?"\r\n\r\n"No, John, you needn\'t sneer. We have better children than ever were\r\nborn on earth before, and they grade higher every year. But we are\r\napproaching a balanced population."\r\n\r\nI didn\'t like the subject, and turned to the clear skyline of the\r\ndistant city. It towered as of old, but seemed not so close-packed. Not\r\none black cloud--and very few white ones!\r\n\r\n"You\'ve ended the smoke nuisance, I\'m glad to see. Has steam gone, too?"\r\n\r\n"We use electricity altogether in all the cities now," she said. "It\r\noccurred to us that to pipe a leaking death into every bedroom; to\r\nthread the city with poison, fire and explosion, was foolish."\r\n\r\n"Defective wiring used to cause both death and conflagration, didn\'t\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"It did," she admitted; "but it is not \'defective\' any more."\r\n\r\n"Is the coal all gone?"\r\n\r\n"No, but we burn it at the mines--by a process which does _not_ waste\r\nninety per cent of the energy--and transmit the power."\r\n\r\n"For all New York?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. New York has enough water power, you see. The tide mills are\r\nenough for this whole region."\r\n\r\n"They solved the tide-mill problem, did they?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. There are innumerable mechanical advances, of course. You\'ll enjoy\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nWe were near enough now to see the city clearly.\r\n\r\n"What a splendid water front!" I cried. "Why, this is glorious."\r\n\r\nIt surely was. The wide shores swung away, glittering in the pure\r\nsunlight. Staten Island lay behind us, a vision of terraced loveliness;\r\nthe Jersey shore shone clear, no foul pall of oil smoke overhanging; the\r\nBrooklyn banks were banks of palaces, and Manhattan itself towered\r\nroyally before us, all bordered with broad granite piers.\r\n\r\n"\'Marginal mile after mile of smooth-running granite embankment,\'"\r\nquoted Nellie. "\'Broad steps of marble descending for the people to\r\nenter the water. White-pillared piers----"\r\n\r\n"Look at the water!" I cried, suddenly. "It\'s clear!"\r\n\r\n"Of course it\'s clear," she agreed laughingly. "This is a civilized\r\ncountry, I tell you."\r\n\r\n"I looked and looked. It was blue and bright in the distance; it was a\r\nclear, soft green beneath us. I saw a fish leap----"\r\n\r\n"So far I\'m with you, anyhow," said I. "That certainly is a big\r\nstep--and looks like a miracle. New York harbor _clean_! . . . How about\r\ncustoms?" I asked as we drew in.\r\n\r\n"Gone--clean forgotten--with a lot of other foolishness. The air ships\r\nsettled that. We couldn\'t plant custom houses in the air, you see--along\r\nten thousand miles of coast and border."\r\n\r\nI was watching the shore. There were plenty of people about, but\r\nstrangely gay of aspect and bright-colored in raiment. I could see\r\namusement piers--numbers of them--some evidently used as gymnasia, in\r\nsome there was dancing. Motor cars of all descriptions ran swiftly and\r\nquietly about. Air ships, large and small, floated off, to the north and\r\nwest mostly. The water was freckled with pleasure boats. I heard\r\nsinging--and music.\r\n\r\n"Some new holiday?" I ventured.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said my sister. "It is afternoon."\r\n\r\nShe watched me, quizzically.\r\n\r\n"It is afternoon," she repeated. "Let that sink in!"\r\n\r\nIt sank in, slowly.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that no one works in the afternoon?"\r\n\r\n"No one--except those who don\'t work in the morning. Some kinds of work\r\ncan\'t stop, of course; but most kinds can. I told you before--no one has\r\nto work more than two hours a day; most people work four. Why?" She saw\r\nmy unbelieving stare. "Because we like to. Also because we are\r\nambitious," she went on. "I told you of the gain we\'ve made in \'the\r\ncivilized world.\' Not all of it is civilized. We are still\r\nmissionary-ing. And while there is need of help anywhere on earth, most\r\nof us work overtime. Also it lays up public capital--we are planning\r\nsome vast undertakings--and gives a wider margin for vacations."\r\n\r\nI was thinking in a hazy way of a world that was not tired, not driven,\r\nno nose on any grindstone; of a people who only had to work two\r\nhours--and worked four! Yet there was every evidence of increased\r\nwealth----\r\n\r\nSuddenly Nellie gave a joyous little cry.\r\n\r\n"Why, there\'s Owen!" she waved her veil. "And there\'s Jerrold and\r\nHallie!" She fairly danced with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"I could see a big grayish man madly waving his hat down there--and two\r\nyoung folks hopping up and down and flourishing handkerchiefs, among\r\nmany similarly excited.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how _good_ of him!" she cried. "I never dreamed they\'d be here!"\r\n\r\n"Nellie," said I sternly. "You never told me you were married!"\r\n\r\n"Why should I?" she asked innocently. "You never asked me."\r\n\r\nI had not. I had seen that she signed her name "Ellen Robertson," and I\r\nknew she was president of a college--how could I imagine her married.\r\nMarried she evidently was, and even her long-lost brother was forgotten\r\nfor a moment as the big man engulfed her in his gray overcoat, and the\r\ntall son and daughter added their arms to the group.\r\n\r\nBut it was only a moment, and the big brotherly grasp of my new\r\nrelation\'s hand, the cordial nephewly grip, and affectionate nicely kiss\r\ngave me a new and unexpected sense of the joys of homecoming.\r\n\r\nThese were people, real people, as warm and kind and cheery as people\r\never were; and they greeted me with evident good will. It was "Uncle\r\nJohn" in no time, and Hallie in especial seized upon me as her own.\r\n\r\n"I know mother\'s got you all broken in by this time," she said. "And\r\nthat you are prepared for all manner of amazing disclosures. But Mother\r\nnever told us how handsome you are, Uncle John!"\r\n\r\n"In vain is the net spread in sight of any bird," murmured young Jerrold\r\nmischievously.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t listen to him, Uncle! I am perfectly sincere," she protested,\r\nleaning over to hug her mother again, and turning back to me with a\r\nconfiding smile.\r\n\r\n"Why should I doubt such evident good judgment?" said I. And she slipped\r\nher hand in mine and squeezed it. Nellie sat there, looking as proud and\r\nhappy and matronly and motherly as anybody could, and a great weight\r\nrolled off my heart. Some things were left of my old world anyway.\r\n\r\nWe talked gaily and excitedly on our way of immediate plans, rolling\r\nsmoothly along broad, open streets. A temporary conclusion was to stop\r\nat Hallie\'s apartment for the time being; and I was conscious of a\r\ndistinct sense of loss to think of my new-found niece being already\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\n"How still it is!" I presently observed. "Is that because it is\r\nafternoon, too?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," they assured me. "We aren\'t as noisy as we used to be."\r\n\r\n"These children don\'t know anything about what we used to have to put up\r\nwith," said Owen. "They never were in New York while it was screaming.\r\nYou see, there are no horses; all surface vehicles are rubber-tired; the\r\nminor delivery is pneumatic, and the freight all goes underneath--on\r\nthose silent monorails."\r\n\r\nThe great city spread about us, clean as a floor, quiet as a country\r\ntown by comparison with what I remembered; yet full of the stir and\r\nmurmur of moving crowds. Everyone we passed or met looked happy and\r\nprosperous, and even my inexperienced eye caught a difference in\r\ncostuming.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no masquerade on, is there?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no--we all wear what we please, that\'s all. Don\'t you like it?"\r\nHallie asked.\r\n\r\nGenerally there appeared the trim short skirt I had noticed as so\r\nappropriate on shipboard; here and there a sort of Florentine gown,\r\nlong, richly damasked; sometimes a Greekish flow of drapery; the men\r\nmostly knickerbockered. I couldn\'t deny that it was pleasant to the eye,\r\nbut it worried me a little none the less.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no hurry, John," said Nellie, always unobtrusively watching me.\r\n"Some things you\'ll just have to get used to."\r\n\r\n"Before I wholly accept this sudden new brother," I presently suggested,\r\n"I\'d like to know his name."\r\n\r\n"Montrose--Owen Montrose, at your service," he said, bowing his fine\r\nhead. "Also Jerrold Montrose--and Hallie Robertson!"\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear!" I protested. "So it\'s come to that, has it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s come to that--and we still love each other!" Nellie cheerfully\r\nagreed. "But it isn\'t final. There\'s a strong movement on foot to drop\r\nhereditary names altogether."\r\n\r\nI groaned. "In the name of common humanity, don\'t tell me anything worse\r\nthan you have now!"\r\n\r\nHallie\'s apartment was in a big building, far uptown, overlooking the\r\nHudson.\r\n\r\n"I have to live in town nine months of the year, you see. Uncle, on\r\naccount of my work," she explained rather apologetically.\r\n\r\n"Hallie\'s an official--and awfully proud of it," her brother whispered\r\nvery loudly.\r\n\r\n"Jerrold\'s only a musician--and pretends to be proud of it!" she\r\nretorted. Whereat he forcibly held and kissed her.\r\n\r\nI could see no very strong difference between this brother and sister\r\nand others I had known--except that they were perhaps unusually\r\naffectionate.\r\n\r\nIt was a big, handsome place. The front windows faced the great river,\r\nthe rear ones opened on a most unexpected scene of loveliness. A big\r\nsheltered garden, every wall-space surrounding it a joy to the eye--rich\r\nmasses of climbing vines, a few trees, a quiet fountain, beautiful stone\r\nseats and winding walks, flowers in profusion, and birds singing.\r\n\r\n"We used to have only the song of the tomcat in my time. Have you taught\r\nthe cat to lie down with the canary--or killed him?"\r\n\r\n"There are no animals kept in cities any more--except the birds--and\r\nthey come and go."\r\n\r\n"Mostly sparrows, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"No; the sparrow went with the horse," Owen replied. "And the mouse, the\r\nfly and the croton bug went with the kitchen."\r\n\r\nI turned with a gesture of despair.\r\n\r\n"No homes left?----"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say \'home\'--I said \'kitchen.\' Brace up, old man! We still\r\neat--and better food than you ever dreamed of in your hungriest youth."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a long story," Nellie here suggested. "We mustn\'t crowd him.\r\nLet\'s get washed and rested a bit, and have some of that food you\'re\r\nboasting of."\r\n\r\nThey gave me a room with a river window, and I looked out at the broad\r\ncurrent, changed only in its lovely clearness, and at the changeless\r\nPalisades.\r\n\r\nChangeless? I started, and seized the traveling glass still on the\r\nstrap.\r\n\r\nThe high cliffs reached away to the northward, still wooded, though\r\nsprinkled with buildings; but the more broken section opposite the city\r\nwas a picture of startling beauty.\r\n\r\nThe water front was green-parked, white-piered, rimmed with palaces, and\r\nthe broken slopes terraced and garlanded in rich foliage. White cottages\r\nand larger buildings climbed and nestled along the sunny slopes as on\r\nthe cliffs at Capri. It was a place one would go far to see.\r\n\r\nI dropped my eyes to the nearer shore. Again the park, the boulevard,\r\nthe gracious outlines of fine architecture.\r\n\r\nIt was beautiful--undeniably beautiful--but a strange world to me. I\r\nfelt like one at a play. A plain, ordinary American landscape ought not\r\nto look like a theatre curtain!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThey called me to supper. "Most of us have our heartiest meal in the\r\nmiddle of the day," my sister said. "The average man, O Victim of\r\nCopious Instruction," added my brother-in-law, "does his work in the\r\nmorning; the two hours that he has to, or the four that he usually puts\r\nin. Eight to twelve, or nine to one--that is the working day for\r\neverybody. Then home, rest, a bath maybe, and then--allow me to help you\r\nto some of our Improvements!"\r\n\r\nI was hungry, and this simple meal looked and smelled most appetizing.\r\nThere was in particular a large shining covered dish, which, being\r\nopened, gave forth so savory a steam as fairly to make my mouth water.\r\nA crisp and toothsome bread was by my plate; a hot drink, which they\r\nlaughingly refused to name, proved most agreeable; a suave, cool salad\r\nfollowed; fruits, some of which were new to me, and most delicate little\r\ncakes, closed the meal.\r\n\r\nThey would not tell me a thing, only saying "Have some more!" and I did.\r\nNot till I had eaten, with continuous delight, three helpings from the\r\nlarge dish did I notice that it stood alone, so to speak.\r\n\r\nNellie followed my eye with her usual prompt intelligence. "Yes," she\r\nsaid, "this is all. But we can send for other things in the twinkling of\r\nan eye; what would you like?"\r\n\r\nI leaned back in my chair and looked at her reproachfully. "I would like\r\nsome of that salad--not very much, please! And some of those Burbankian\r\nproducts yonder, and one particular brown little cake--if I can hold\r\nit."\r\n\r\nNellie smiled demurely. "Oh!" she mildly remarked, "I thought for the\r\nmoment that our little supper seemed scant to you."\r\n\r\nI glared at her, retorting, "Now I will not utter the grateful praises\r\nthat were rising to my lips. I will even try to look critical and\r\ndissatisfied." And I did, but they all laughed.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no manner of use, Uncle John," cried my pretty niece; "we saw you\r\neat it."\r\n\r\n"\'It\' indeed!" I protested. "What is this undeniably easy-to-take\r\nconcoction you have stuffed me with?"\r\n\r\n"My esteemed new brother," Owen answered, "we have been considering your\r\ncase in conclave assembled, and we think it is wiser to feed you for\r\nawhile and demand by all the rites of hospitality that you eat what is\r\nset before you and ask no questions for conscience sake. When you begin\r\nto pine, to lose your appetite, to look wan and hollow-eyed, then we may\r\nreconsider. Meanwhile we will tell you everything you want to know about\r\nfood in general, and even some particulars--present dishes always\r\nexcepted."\r\n\r\n"I will now produce information," began Hallie, "my office being that of\r\nFood Inspector."\r\n\r\n"Her main purpose in bringing you here, Uncle, was to give you food and\r\nthen talk about it," said Jerrold solemnly. Hallie only made a face at\r\nhim, and went on:\r\n\r\n"We have a magnificent system of production and distribution," she\r\nexplained, "with a decreasing use of animal foods."\r\n\r\n"Was this a vegetarian meal?" I asked in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n"Mostly; but you shall have meat when you want it--better meat than you\r\nused to get, too."\r\n\r\n"Cold Storage Meat?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; that\'s long since stopped. The way we manage about meat is\r\nthis: A proper proportion of edible animals are raised under good\r\nconditions--nice, healthy, happy beasts; killed so that they don\'t know\r\nit!--and never kept beyond a certain time limit. You see----" she\r\npaused, looking for the moment like her mother, "the whole food business\r\nis changed--you don\'t realize----"\r\n\r\n"Go ahead and tell me--tell me all--my life at present is that of Rollo,\r\nI perceive, and I am most complacent after this meal."\r\n\r\n"Uncle, I rejoice in your discovery, I do indeed. You are an uncle after\r\nmy own heart," said Jerrold.\r\n\r\nSo my fair niece, looking like any other charming girl in a pretty\r\nevening frock, began to expound her specialty. Her mother begged to\r\ninterrupt for the moment. "Let me recall to him things as they\r\nwere--which you hardly know, you happy child. Don\'t forget, John, that\r\nwhen we were young we did not know what good food was."\r\n\r\nI started to protest, but she shook her finger at me.\r\n\r\n"No, we didn\'t, my dear boy. We knew \'what we liked,\' as the people said\r\nat the picture show; but that did not make it good--good in itself or\r\ngood for us. The world was ill-fed. Most of the food was below par; a\r\ngood deal was injurious, some absolutely poison. People sold poison for\r\nfood in 1910, don\'t forget that! You may remember the row that was\r\nbeginning to be made about it."\r\n\r\nI admitted recalling something of the sort, though it had not\r\nparticularly interested me at the time.\r\n\r\n"Well, that row went on--and gained in force. The women woke up."\r\n\r\n"If you have said that once since we met, my dear sister, you\'ve said it\r\nforty times. I wish you would make a parenthesis in these food\r\ndiscussions and tell me how, when and why the women woke up."\r\n\r\nNellie looked a little dashed, and Owen laughed outright.\r\n\r\n"You stand up for your rights, John!" he said, rising and slapping me on\r\nthe shoulder. "Let\'s go in the other room and settle down for a\r\nchin--it\'s our fate."\r\n\r\n"Hold him till he sees our housekeeping," said Jerrold. I stood\r\nwatching, while they rapidly placed our dishes--which I now noticed were\r\nvery few--in a neat square case which stood on a side table. Everything\r\nwent in out of sight; paper napkins from the same receptacle wiped the\r\nshining table; and then a smooth-running dumbwaiter took it from our\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n"This is housework," said Nellie, mischievously.\r\n\r\n"I refuse to be impressed. Come back to our muttons," I insisted. "You\r\ncan tell me about your domestic sleight-of-hand in due season."\r\n\r\nSo we lounged in the large and pleasant parlor, the broad river before\r\nus, rimmed with starry lamps, sparkling everywhere with the lights of\r\ntiny pleasure craft, and occasionally the blaze and wash of larger\r\nboats. I had a sense of pleasant well-being. I had eaten heartily, very\r\nheartily, yet was not oppressed. My new-found family pleased me well.\r\nThe quiet room was beautiful in color and proportion, and as my eyes\r\nwandered idly over it I noted how few in number and how harmonious were\r\nits contents giving a sense of peace and spaciousness.\r\n\r\nThe air was sweet--I did not notice then, as I did later, that the whole\r\ncity was sweet-aired now; at least by comparison with what cities used\r\nto be. From somewhere came the sound of soft music, grateful to the ear.\r\nI stretched myself luxuriously with:\r\n\r\n"Now, then, Nellie--let her go--\'the women woke up.\'"\r\n\r\n"Some women were waking up tremendously, before you left, John\r\nRobertson, only I dare say you never noticed it. They just kept on,\r\nfaster and faster, till they all did--about all. There are some Dodos\r\nleft, even yet, but they don\'t count--discredited grandmothers!"\r\n\r\n"And, being awake?" I gently suggested.\r\n\r\n"And being awake, they----" She paused for an instant, seeking an\r\nexpression, and Jerrold\'s smooth bass voice put in, "They saw their duty\r\nand they did it."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," his mother agreed, with a proudly loving glance at him;\r\n"that\'s just what they did! And in regard to the food business, they\r\nrecognized at last that it was their duty to feed the world--and that it\r\nwas miserably done! So they took hold."\r\n\r\n"Now, mother, this is my specialty," Hallie interposed.\r\n\r\n"When a person can only talk about one thing, why oppose them?" murmured\r\nJerrold. But she quite ignored him, and reopened her discussion.\r\n\r\n"We--that is, most of the women and some of the men--began to seriously\r\nstudy the food question, both from a hygienic and an economic\r\nstandpoint. I can\'t tell you that thirty years\' work in a minute. Uncle\r\nJohn, but here\'s the way we manage it now: We have learned very\r\ndefinitely what people ought not to eat, and it is not only a\r\npunishable, but a punished offense to sell improper food stuffs."\r\n\r\n"How are the people to know?" I ventured.\r\n\r\n"The people are not required to know everything. All the food is watched\r\nand tested by specialists; what goes into the market is good--all of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"By impeccable angelic specialists--like my niece?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head at me. "If they were not, the purchaser would spot\r\nthem at once. You see, our food supply is not at the mercy of the\r\nmillions of ignorant housewives any more. Food is bought and prepared by\r\npeople who know how--and they have all the means--and knowledge--for\r\nexpert tests."\r\n\r\n"And if the purchaser too was humanly fallible?--"\r\n\r\nShe cast a pitying glance on me, and her father took the floor for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"You see, John, in the old time the dealers were mostly poor, and sold\r\ncheap and bad stuff to make a little money. The buyers were mostly poor,\r\nand had to buy the cheap and nasty stuff. Even large manufacturers were\r\nunder pressure, and had to cheat to make a profit--or thought they had\r\nto. Then when we got to inspectors and such like they were under the\r\nharrow, too, and were by no means impeccable. Our big change is this:\r\nNobody is poor now."\r\n\r\n"I hear you say that," I answered, "but I can\'t seem to get it through\r\nmy head. Have you really divided all the property?"\r\n\r\n"John Robertson, I\'m ashamed of you!" cried Nellie. "Even in 1910 people\r\nknew better than that--people who knew anything!"\r\n\r\n"That wasn\'t necessary," said Owen, "nor desirable. What we have done is\r\nthis: First, we have raised the productive capacity of the population;\r\nsecond, we have secured their right to our natural resources; third, we\r\nhave learned to administer business without waste. The wealth of the\r\nworld grows enormously. It is not what you call \'equally distributed,\'\r\nbut every one has enough. There is no economic danger any more; there is\r\neconomic peace."\r\n\r\n"And economic freedom?" asked I sharply.\r\n\r\n"And economic freedom. People choose the work they like best, and\r\nwork--freely, more than they have to."\r\n\r\nI pondered on this. "Ah, but they _have to_--labor is compulsory."\r\n\r\nOwen grinned. "Yes, labor is compulsory--always was. It is compulsory on\r\neveryone now. We used to have two sets who wouldn\'t work--paupers and\r\nthe idle rich; no such classes left--all busy."\r\n\r\n"But, the freedom of the individual----" I persisted.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, brother; society always played hob with the freedom of the\r\nindividuals whenever it saw fit. It killed, imprisoned, fined; it had\r\ncompulsory laws and regulations; it required people to wear clothes and\r\nfurnished no clothes for them to wear. If society has a right to take\r\nhuman life, why has it not a right to improve it? No, my dear man,"\r\ncontinued Owen (he was evidently launched on _his_ specialty now)\r\n"society is not somebody else domineering over us! Society is us--taking\r\ncare of ourselves."\r\n\r\nI took no exception to this, and he began again. "Society, in our young\r\ndays, was in a state of auto-intoxication. It generated its own\r\npoisons, and absorbed them in peaceful, slow suicide. To think!--it\r\nseems impossible now--to think of allowing anybody to sell bad food!"\r\n\r\n"That wasn\'t the only bad thing they sold," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"No; unfortunately. Why, look here--" Owen slid a glass panel in the\r\nwall and took out a book.\r\n\r\n"That\'s clever," I remarked approvingly. "Bookcases built in!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, they are everywhere now," said Nellie. "Books--a few of them--are\r\ncommon human necessities. Every home, every room almost, has these\r\nlittle dust-tight, insect-proof wall cases. Concrete construction has\r\nhelped very much in all such matters."\r\n\r\nOwen had found his place, and now poured upon me a concentrated list of\r\nthe adulterated materials deteriorating the world in that period so\r\nslightingly referred to as "my day." I noticed with gratitude that Owen\r\nsaid "When we were young!"\r\n\r\n"You never were sure of getting _anything_ pure," he said scornfully,\r\n"no matter what you paid for it. How we submitted to such rank outrage\r\nfor so long I cannot imagine! This was taken up very definitely some\r\ntwenty years ago, by the women mostly."\r\n\r\n"Aha--\'when the women woke up!\'" I cried.\r\n\r\n"Yes, just that. It is true that their being mostly mere housewives and\r\nseamstresses was a handicap in some ways; but it was a direct advantage\r\nin others. They were almost all consumers, you see, not producers. They\r\nwere not so much influenced by considerations of the profits of the\r\nmanufacturer as they were by the direct loss to their own pockets and\r\nhealth. Yes," he smiled reminiscently, "there were some pretty warm\r\nyears while this thing was thrashed out. One of the most successful\r\nlines of attack was in the New Food system, though."\r\n\r\n"I _will_ talk!" cried Hallie. "Here I\'ve inveigled Uncle John up\r\nhere--and--and fed him to repletion; and have him completely at my\r\nmercy, and then you people butt in and do all the talking!"\r\n\r\n"Go it, little sister--you\'re dead right!" agreed Jerrold.\r\n\r\n"You see. Uncle, it\'s one thing to restrain and prevent and punish--and\r\nanother thing to substitute improvements."\r\n\r\n"Kindergarten methods?" I ventured.\r\n\r\n"Yes, exactly. As women had learned this in handling children, they\r\nbegan to apply it to grown people--the same children, only a little\r\nolder. Ever so many people had been talking and writing about this food\r\nbusiness, and finally some of them got together and really started it."\r\n\r\n"One of these co-operative schemes?" I was beginning, but the women\r\nlooked at me with such pitying contempt that I promptly withdrew the\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n"Not much!" said Nellie disdainfully. "Of course, those co-operative\r\nschemes were a natural result of the growing difficulties in our old\r\nmethods, but they were on utterly wrong lines. No, sir; the new food\r\nbusiness was a real business, and a very successful one. The first\r\ncompany began about 1912 or \'13, I think. Just some women with a real\r\nbusiness sense, and enough capital. They wisely concluded that a block\r\nof apartments was the natural field for their services; and that\r\nprofessional women were their natural patrons."\r\n\r\n"The unprofessional women--or professional wives, as you might call\r\nthem--had only their housewifery to preserve their self-respect, you\r\nsee," put in Owen. "If they didn\'t do housekeeping for a living,\r\nwhat--in the name of decency--did they do?"\r\n\r\n"This was called the Home Service Company," said Hallie. "(I will talk,\r\nmother!) They built some unusually attractive apartments, planned by\r\nwomen, to please women; this block was one of the finest designs of\r\ntheir architects--women, too, by the way."\r\n\r\n"Who had waked up," murmured Jerrold, unnoticed.\r\n\r\n"It was frankly advertised as specially designed for professional women.\r\nThey looked at it, liked it, and moved it; teachers, largely doctors,\r\nlawyers, dressmakers; women who worked."\r\n\r\n"Sort of a nunnery?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"My dear brother, do you imagine that all working women were orphan\r\nspinsters, even in your day?" cried Nellie. "The self-supporting women\r\nof that time generally had other people to support, too. Lots of them\r\nwere married; many were widows with children; even the single ones had\r\nbrothers and sisters to take care of."\r\n\r\n"They rushed in, anyhow," said Hallie. "The place was beautiful and\r\nbuilt for enjoyment. There was a nice garden in the middle----"\r\n\r\n"Like this one here?" I interrupted. "This is a charming patio. How did\r\nthey make space for it?"\r\n\r\n"New York blocks were not divinely ordained," Owen replied. "It occurred\r\nto the citizens at last they could bisect those 200 x 800-foot\r\noblongs, and they did. Wide, tree-shaded, pleasant ways run between the\r\nold avenues, and the blocks remaining are practically squares."\r\n\r\n"You noticed the irregular border of grass and shrubbery as we came up,\r\ndidn\'t you, Uncle?" asked Jerrold. "We forgot to speak about it, because\r\nwe are used to it."\r\n\r\nI did recall now that our ride had been not through monotonous,\r\nstone-faced, right-angled ravines, but along the pleasant fronts of\r\ngracious varying buildings, whose skyline was a pleasure and street line\r\nbordered greenly.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t live here and don\'t remember, maybe," Owen remarked, "but\r\nthe regular thing uptown was one of those lean, long blocks, flat-faced\r\nand solid, built to the sidewalk\'s edge. If it was a line of private\r\nhouses they were bordered with gloomy little stone-paved areas, and\r\nornamented with ash-cans and garbage pails. If the avenue end was faced\r\nwith tall apartments, their lower margin was infested with a row of\r\nlittle shops--meat, fish, vegetable, fruit--with all their litter and\r\nrefuse and flies, and constant traffic. Now a residence block is a thing\r\nof beauty on all sides. The really necessary shops are maintained, but\r\nplanned for in the building, and made beautiful. Those fly-tainted meat\r\nmarkets no longer exist."\r\n\r\n"I _will_ talk!" said Hallie, so plaintively that we all laughed and let\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"That first one I was telling you about was very charming and\r\nattractive. There were arrangements on the top floor for nurseries and\r\nchild gardens; and the roof was for children all day; evenings the\r\ngrown-ups had it. Great care was taken by the management in letting this\r\npart to the best professionals in child culture.\r\n\r\n"There were big rooms, too, for meetings and parties; places for\r\nbilliards and bowling and swimming--it was planned for real human\r\nenjoyment, like a summer hotel."\r\n\r\n"But I thought you said this place was for women," I incautiously\r\nventured.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Uncle John! And has it never occurred to you that women like to\r\namuse themselves? Or that professional women have men relatives and men\r\nfriends? There were plenty of men in the building, and plenty more to\r\nvisit it. They were shown how nice it was, you see. But the chief card\r\nwas the food and service. This company engaged, at high wages,\r\nfirst-class houseworkers, and the residents paid for them by the hour;\r\nand they had a food service which was beyond the dreams of--of--homes,\r\nor boarding houses."\r\n\r\n"Your professional women must have been millionaires," I mildly\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n"You think so because you do not understand the food business, Uncle\r\nJohn; nobody did in those days. We were so used to the criminal waste of\r\nindividual housekeeping, with its pitifully low standards, and to\r\nmonotonous low-grade restaurant meals, with their waste and extortion,\r\nthat it never occurred to us to estimate the amount of profit there\r\nreally was in the business. These far-seeing women were pioneers--but\r\nnot for long! Dozens are claiming first place now, just as the early\r\n\'Women\'s Clubs\' used to.\r\n\r\n"They established in that block a meal service that was a wonder for\r\nexcellence, and for cheapness, too; and people began to learn."\r\n\r\nI was impressed, but not convinced, and she saw it.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Uncle John, I hate to use figures on a helpless listener,\r\nbut you drive me to it."\r\n\r\nThen she reached for the bookcase and produced her evidence, sparingly,\r\nbut with effect. She showed me that the difference between the expense\r\nof hiring separate service and the same number of people patronizing a\r\nservice company was sufficient to reduce expenses to the patrons and\r\nleave a handsome payment for the company.\r\n\r\nOwen looked on, interpreting to my ignorance.\r\n\r\n"You never kept house, old, man," he said, "nor thought much about it, I\r\nexpect; but you can figure this out for yourself easily enough. Here\r\nwere a hundred families, equal to, say, five hundred persons. They hired\r\na hundred cooks, of course; paid them something like six dollars a\r\nweek--call it five on an average. There\'s $500 a week, just for\r\ncooks--$26,000 a year!"\r\n\r\n"Now, as a matter of fact (our learned daughter tells us this), ten\r\ncooks are plenty for five hundred persons--at the same price would cost\r\n$1,300 a year!"\r\n\r\n"Ten are plenty, and to spare," said Hallie; "but we pay them\r\nhandsomely. One chef at $8,000; two next bests at $2,000 each, four\r\nthousand; two at $1,000 apiece, two thousand; five at $800, four\r\nthousand. That\'s $13,000--half what we paid before, and the difference\r\nin service between a kitchen maid and a scientific artist."\r\n\r\n"Fifty per cent, saved on wages, and 500 per cent, added to skill," Owen\r\ncontinued. "And you can go right on and add 90 per cent, saving in fuel,\r\n90 per cent, in plant, 50 per cent, in utensils, and--how much is it,\r\nHallie, in materials?"\r\n\r\nHallie looked very important.\r\n\r\n"Even when they first started, when food was shamefully expensive and\r\nrequired all manner of tests and examinations, the saving was all of 60\r\nper cent. Now it is fully 80 per cent."\r\n\r\n"That makes a good deal all told, Uncle John," Jerrold quietly remarked,\r\nhanding me a bit of paper. "You see, it does leave a margin of profit."\r\n\r\nI looked rather helplessly at the figures; also at Hallie.\r\n\r\n"It is a shame, Uncle, to hurry you so, but the sooner you get these\r\nlittle matters clear in your head, the better. We have these great food\r\nfurnishing companies, now, all over the country; and they have market\r\ngardens and dairies and so on, of their own. There is a Food Bureau in\r\nevery city, and a National Food Bureau, with international relations.\r\nThe best scientific knowledge is used to study food values, to improve\r\nold materials and develop new ones; there\'s a tremendous gain."\r\n\r\n"But--do the people swallow things as directed by the government?" I\r\nprotested. "Is there no chance to go and buy what you want to eat when\r\nyou want it?"\r\n\r\nThey rose to their feet with one accord. Jerrold seized me by the hand.\r\n\r\n"Come on, Uncle!" he cried. "Now is as good a time as any. You shall see\r\nour food department--come to scoff and remain to prey--if you like."\r\n\r\nThe elevator took us down, and I was led unresistingly among their\r\nshining modernities.\r\n\r\n"Here is the source of supply," said Owen, showing where the basement\r\nsupply room connected with a clean, airy subway under the glass-paved\r\nsidewalk. "Ice we make, drinking water we distil, fuel is wired to us;\r\nbut the food stuffs are brought this way. Come down early enough and you\r\nwould find these arteries of the city flowing steadily with----"\r\n\r\n"Milk and honey," put in Jerrold.\r\n\r\n"With the milk train, the meat train, the vegetable train, and so on."\r\n\r\n"Ordered beforehand?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Ordered beforehand. Up to midnight you may send down word as to the\r\nkind of mushrooms you prefer--and no extra charge. During the day you\r\ncan still order, but there\'s a trifle more expense--not much. But most\r\nof us are more than content to have our managers cater for us. From the\r\nhome outfit you may choose at any time. There are lists upstairs, and\r\nhere is the array."\r\n\r\nThere were but few officials in this part of the great establishment at\r\nthis hour, but we were politely shown about by a scholarly looking man\r\nin white linen, who had been reading as we entered. They took me between\r\nrows of glass cases, standing as books do in the library, and showed me\r\nthe day\'s baking; the year\'s preserves; the fragrant, colorful shelves\r\nof such fruit and vegetables as were not fresh picked from day to day.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t get to-day\'s strawberries till the local ones are ripe,"\r\nJerrold told us. "These are yesterday\'s, and pretty good yet."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, but those have just come in," said the white-linen person;\r\n"this morning\'s picking, from Maryland."\r\n\r\nI tasted them with warm approval. There was a fascinating display of\r\ncakes and cookies, some old favorites, some of a new but attractive\r\naspect; and in glass-doored separate ice-chambers, meats, fish, milk,\r\nand butter.\r\n\r\n"Can people come in here and get what they want, though?" I inquired\r\ntriumphantly.\r\n\r\n"They can, and occasionally they do. But what it will take you some time\r\nto realize, John," my sister explained, "is the different attitude of\r\npeople toward their food. We are all not only well fed--sufficiently\r\nfed--but so wisely fed that we seldom think of wanting anything further.\r\nWhen we do we can order from upstairs, come down to the eating room and\r\norder, send to the big depots if it is some rare thing, or even come in\r\nlike this. To the regular purchasers it is practically free."\r\n\r\n"And how if you are a stranger--a man in the street?"\r\n\r\n"In every city in our land you may go into any eating house and find\r\nfood as good--and cheap--as this," said Hallie, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile below they took me into the patio, that quiet inner garden which\r\nwas so attractive from above. It was a lovely place. The moon was riding\r\nhigh and shone down into it; a slender fountain spray rose shimmering\r\nfrom its carved basin; on the southern-facing wall a great wistaria vine\r\ndrooped in budding purple, and beds of violets made the air rich with\r\nsoft fragrance.\r\n\r\nHere and there were people walking; and in the shadowy corners sat young\r\ncouples, apparently quite happy.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you don\'t know the names of one of them," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I know nearly all," answered Hallie. "These apartments\r\nare taken very largely by friends and acquaintances. You see, the\r\ngardens and roofs are in common, and there are the reading-rooms,\r\nballrooms, and so on. It is pleasanter to be friends to begin with, and\r\nmost of us get to be afterward, if we are not at first.\r\n\r\n"But surely there are some disagreeable people left on earth!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but where there is so much more social life people get together in\r\ncongenial sets," put in Nellie; "just as we used to in summer resorts."\r\n\r\n"There aren\'t so many bores and fools as there used to be, John," Owen\r\nremarked. "We really do raise better people. Even the old ones have\r\nimproved. You see, life is so much pleasanter and more interesting."\r\n\r\n"We\'re all healthier. Uncle John, because we\'re better fed; that makes\r\nus more agreeable."\r\n\r\n"There\'s more art in the world to make us happier," said Jerrold.\r\n"Hallie thinks it\'s all due to her everlasting bread and butter. Listen\r\nto that now!"\r\n\r\nFrom a balcony up there in the moonlight came a delicious burst of\r\nmelody; a guitar and two voices, and the refrain was taken up from\r\nanother window, from one corner of the garden, from the roof; all in\r\nsmooth accord.\r\n\r\n"Your group here must be an operatic one," I suggested. But my nephew\r\nanswered that it was not, but that music--good music--was so common now,\r\nand so well taught, that the average was high in both taste and\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nWe sat late that night, my new family bubbling over with things to say,\r\nand filling my mind with a confused sense of new advantages, unexplained\r\nand only half believed.\r\n\r\nI could not bring myself to accept as commonplace facts the unusual\r\nexcellences so glibly described, and I suppose my silence showed this as\r\nwell as what I said, for my sister presently intervened with decision:\r\n\r\n"We must all stop this for to-night," she said. "John feels as if he was\r\nbeing forcibly fed--he\'s got to rest. Then I suggest that to-morrow Owen\r\ntake him in hand--go off for a tramp, why don\'t you?--and really\r\nstraighten out things. You see, there are two distinct movements to\r\nconsider, the unconscious progress that would have taken place anyway in\r\nthirty years, and then the deliberate measures adopted by the \'New\r\nLifers,\' and it\'s rather confusing. I\'ve labored with him all the way\r\nhome now; I think the man\'s point of view will help."\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOwen was a big man with a strong, wholesome face, and a quizzical little\r\nsmile of his own. He and I went up the river next morning in a swift\r\nmotor boat, which did not batter the still air with muffled banging as\r\nthey used to do, and strolled off in the bright spring sunshine into\r\nPalisade Park.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve saved all the loveliest of it--for keeps," he said. "Out here,\r\nwhere the grass and trees are just as they used to be, you won\'t be\r\nbothered, and one expositor will be easier to handle than four at once.\r\nNow, shall I talk, or will you ask questions?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to ask a few questions first, then you can expound by the\r\nhour. Do give me the long and short of this \'women-waked-up\'\r\nproposition. What does it mean--to a man?"\r\n\r\nOwen stroked his chin.\r\n\r\n"No loss," he said at length; "at least, no loss that\'s not covered by a\r\ngreater gain. Do you remember the new biological theory in regard to the\r\nrelative position of the sexes that was beginning to make headway when\r\nwe were young?"\r\n\r\nI nodded. "Ward\'s theory? Oh, yes; I heard something of it. Pretty\r\nfar-fetched, it seemed to me."\r\n\r\n"Far-fetched and dear-bought, but true for all that. You\'ll have to\r\nswallow it. The female is the race type; the male is her assistant. It\'s\r\nestablished beyond peradventure."\r\n\r\nI meditated, painfully. I looked at Owen. He had just as happy and proud\r\na look as if he was a real man--not merely an Assistant. I though of\r\nJerrold--nothing cowed about him; of the officers and men on the ship;\r\nof such men as I had seen in the street.\r\n\r\n"I suppose this applies in the main to remote origins?" I suggested.\r\n\r\n"It holds good all through life--is just as true as it ever was."\r\n\r\n"Then--do you mean that women run everything, and men are only helpers?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; I wasn\'t talking about human life at all--only about sex.\r\n\'Running things\' has nothing to do with that. Women run some businesses\r\nand are in practically all, but men still do the bulk of the world\'s\r\nwork. There is a natural division of labor, after all."\r\n\r\nThis was pleasant to hear, but he dashed my hopes.\r\n\r\n"Men do almost all the violent plain work--digging and hewing and\r\nhammering; women, as a class, prefer the administrative and constructive\r\nkinds. But all that is open yet, and settling itself gradually; men and\r\nwomen are working everywhere. The big change which Nellie is always\r\nreferring to means simply that women \'waked up\' to a realization of the\r\nfact that they were human beings."\r\n\r\n"What were they before, pray?"\r\n\r\n"Only female beings."\r\n\r\n"Female human beings, of course," said I.\r\n\r\n"Yes; a little human, but mostly female. Now they are mostly human. It\r\nis a great change."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t follow you. Aren\'t they still wives and mothers?"\r\n\r\n"They are still mothers--far more so than they were before, as a matter\r\nof fact; but as to being wives--there\'s a difference."\r\n\r\nI was displeased, and showed it.\r\n\r\n"Well, is it Polygamy, or Polyandry, or Trial Marriages, or what?"\r\n\r\nOwen gazed at me with an expression very like Nellie\'s.\r\n\r\n"There it is," he said. "You can only think about women in some sort of\r\nrelation to men, of a change in marriage relations as merely a change in\r\nkind; whereas what has happened is a change in degree. We still have\r\nmonogamous marriages, on a much purer and more lasting plane than a\r\ngeneration ago; but the word \'wife\' does not mean what it used to."\r\n\r\n"Go on--I can\'t follow you at all."\r\n\r\n"A \'wife\' used to be a possession; \'wilt thou be mine?\' said the lover,\r\nand the wife was \'his.\'"\r\n\r\n"Well--whose else is she now?" I asked with some sharpness.\r\n\r\n"She does not \'belong\' to anyone in that old sense. She is the wife of\r\nher husband in that she is his true lover, and that their marriage is\r\nlegally recorded; but her life and work does not belong to him. He has\r\nno right to her \'services\' any more. A woman who is in a business--like\r\nHallie, for instance--does not give it up when she marries."\r\n\r\nI stopped him. "What! Isn\'t Hallie married?"\r\n\r\n"No--not yet."\r\n\r\n"But--that is her flat?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; why not?" He laughed at me. "You see, you can\'t imagine a woman\r\nhaving a home of her own. Hallie is twenty-three. She won\'t marry for\r\nsome years, probably; but she has her position and is doing excellent\r\nwork. It\'s only a minor inspectorship, but she likes it. Why shouldn\'t\r\nshe have a home?"\r\n\r\n"Why doesn\'t she have it with you?"\r\n\r\n"Because I like to live with my wife. Her business, and mine, are in\r\nMichigan; Hallie\'s in New York."\r\n\r\n"And when she marries she keeps on being an inspector?" I queried.\r\n\r\n"Precisely. The man who marries that young woman will have much\r\nhappiness, but he will not \'own\' her, and she will not be his wife in\r\nthe sense of a servant. She will not darn his socks or cook his meals.\r\nWhy should she?"\r\n\r\n"Will she not nurse his babies?"\r\n\r\n"No; she will nurse _her_ babies--_their_ babies, not \'his\' merely."\r\n\r\n"And keep on being an inspector?"\r\n\r\n"And keep on being an inspector--for four hours a day--in two shifts.\r\nNot a bit more difficult than cooking, my dear boy."\r\n\r\n"But--she will not be with her children--"\r\n\r\n"She will be with her children twenty hours out of the twenty-four--if\r\nshe wants to. But Hallie\'s not specially good with children. . . . You\r\nsee, John, the women have specialized--even in motherhood."\r\n\r\nThen he went on at considerable length to show how there had arisen a\r\nrecognition of far more efficient motherhood than was being given; that\r\nthose women best fitted for the work had given eager, devoted lives to\r\nit and built up a new science of Humaniculture; that no woman was\r\nallowed to care for her children without proof of capacity.\r\n\r\n"Allowed by whom?" I put in.\r\n\r\n"By the other women--the Department of Child Culture--the Government."\r\n\r\n"And the fathers--do they submit to this, tamely?"\r\n\r\n"No; they cheerfully agree and approve. Absolutely the biggest thing\r\nthat has happened, some of us think, is that new recognition of the\r\nimportance of childhood. We are raising better people now."\r\n\r\nI was silent for a while, pulling up bits of grass and snapping small\r\nsticks into inch pieces.\r\n\r\n"There was a good deal of talk about Eugenics, I remember," I said at\r\nlast, "and--what was that thing? Endowment of Motherhood?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--man\'s talk," Owen explained. "You see, John, we couldn\'t look at\r\nwomen but in one way--in the old days; it was all a question of sex with\r\nus--inevitably, we being males. Our whole idea of improvement was in\r\nbetter breeding; our whole idea of motherhood was in each woman\'s\r\ndevoting her whole life to her own children. That turbid freshet of an\r\nEnglishman, Wells, who did so much to stir his generation, said \'I am\r\nwholly feminist\'--and he was! He saw women only as females and wanted\r\nthem endowed as such. He was never able to see them as human beings and\r\namply competent to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\n"Now, our women, getting hold of this idea that they really are human\r\ncreatures, simply blossomed forth in new efficiency. They specialized\r\nthe food business--Hallie\'s right about the importance of that--and then\r\nthey specialized the baby business. All women who wish to, have babies;\r\nbut if they wish to take care of them they must show a diploma."\r\n\r\nI looked at him. I didn\'t like it--but what difference did that make? I\r\nhad died thirty years ago, it appeared.\r\n\r\n"A diploma for motherhood!" I repeated; but he corrected me.\r\n\r\n"Not at all. Any woman can be a mother--if she\'s normal. I said she had\r\nto have a diploma as a child-culturist--quite a different matter."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see the difference."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose not. I didn\'t, once," he said. "Any and every mother was\r\nsupposed to be competent to \'raise\' children--and look at the kind of\r\npeople we raised! You see, we are beginning to learn--just beginning.\r\nYou needn\'t imagine that we are in a state of perfection--there are more\r\nnew projects up for discussion than ever before. We\'ve only made a\r\nstart. The consequences, so far, are so good that we are boiling over\r\nwith propositions for future steps."\r\n\r\n"Go on about the women," I said. "I want to know the worst and become\r\nresigned."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing very bad to tell," he continued cheerfully. "When a\r\ngirl is born she is treated in all ways as if she was a boy; there is no\r\nhint made in any distinction between them except in the perfectly open\r\nphysiological instruction as to their future duties. Children, young\r\nhumans, grow up under precisely the same conditions. I speak, of course,\r\nof the most advanced people--there are still backward places--there\'s\r\nplenty to do yet.\r\n\r\n"Then the growing girls are taught of their place and power as\r\nmothers--and they have tremendously high ideals. That\'s what has done so\r\nmuch to raise the standard in men. It came hard, but it worked."\r\n\r\nI raised my head with keen interest, remarking, "I\'ve glimpsed a sort of\r\n\'iron hand in a velvet glove\' back of all this. What did they do?"\r\n\r\nOwen looked rather grim for a moment.\r\n\r\n"The worst of it was twenty or twenty-five years back. Most of those men\r\nare dead. That new religious movement stirred the socio-ethical sense to\r\nsudden power; it coincided with the women\'s political movement, urging\r\nmeasures for social improvement; its enormous spread, both by preaching\r\nand literature, lit up the whole community with new facts, ideas and\r\nfeelings. Health--physical purity--was made a practical ideal. The young\r\nwomen learned the proportion of men with syphilis and gonorrhea and\r\ndecided it was wrong to marry them. That was enough. They passed laws in\r\nevery State requiring a clean bill of health with every marriage\r\nlicense. Diseased men had to die bachelors--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"And did men submit to legislation like that?" I protested.\r\n\r\n"Why not? It was so patently for the protection of the race--of the\r\nfamily--of the women and children. Women were solid for it, of\r\ncourse--and all the best men with them. To oppose it was almost a\r\nconfession of guilt and injured a man\'s chances of marriage."\r\n\r\n"It used to be said that any man could find a woman to marry him," I\r\nmurmured, meditatively.\r\n\r\n"Maybe he could--once. He certainly cannot now. A man who has one of\r\nthose diseases is so reported--just like small-pox, you see. Moreover,\r\nit is registered against him by the Department of Eugenics--physicians\r\nare required to send in lists; any girl can find out."\r\n\r\n"It must have left a large proportion of unmarried women."\r\n\r\n"It did, at first. And that very thing was of great value to the world.\r\nThey were wise, conscientious, strong women, you see, and they poured\r\nall their tremendous force into social service. Lots of them went into\r\nchild culture--used their mother-power that way. It wasn\'t easy for\r\nthem; it wasn\'t easy for the left-over men, either!"\r\n\r\n"It must have increased prostitution to an awful extent," I said.\r\n\r\nOwen shook his head and regarded me quizzically.\r\n\r\n"That is the worst of it," he said. "There isn\'t any."\r\n\r\nI sat up. I stood up. I walked up and down. "No prostitution! I--I can\'t\r\nbelieve it. Why, prostitution is a social necessity, as old as Nineveh!"\r\n\r\nOwen laughed outright. "Too late, old man; too late! I know we used to\r\nthink so. We did use to call it a \'social necessity,\' didn\'t we? Come,\r\nnow, tell me what necessity it was _to the women_."\r\n\r\nI stopped my march and looked at him.\r\n\r\n"To the women," he repeated. "What did they want of prostitution? What\r\ngood did it do them?"\r\n\r\n"Why--why--they made a living at it," I replied, rather lamely.\r\n\r\n"Yes, a nice, honorable, pleasant, healthy living, didn\'t they? With all\r\nwomen perfectly well able to earn an excellent living decently; with all\r\nwomen fully educated about these matters and knowing what a horrible\r\ndeath was before them in this business; with all women brought up like\r\nhuman beings and not like over-sexed female animals, and with all women\r\nquite free to marry if they wished to--how many, do you think, would\r\nchoose that kind of business?\r\n\r\n"We never waited for them to choose it, remember! We fooled them and\r\nlied to them and dragged them in--and drove them in--forced them in--and\r\nkept them as slaves and prisoners. They didn\'t really enjoy the life;\r\nyou know that. Why should they go into it if they do not have to--to\r\naccommodate us?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me there are no--wantons--among women?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t mean any such thing. There are various kinds of\r\nover-developed and morbidly developed women as there are men, and we\r\nhaven\'t weeded them out entirely. But the whole thing is now recognized\r\nas pathological--cases for medical treatment, or perhaps surgical.\r\nBesides, wantonness is not prostitution. Prostitution is a social crime\r\nof the worst order. No one thing did more harm. The women stamped it\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"Legislated us all into morality, did they?" I inquired sarcastically.\r\n\r\n"Legislation did a good deal; education did more; the new religion did\r\nmost; social opinion helped. You remember we men never really tried to\r\nlegislate against prostitution--we wanted it to go on."\r\n\r\n"Why, surely we did legislate against it--and it was of no use!" I\r\nprotested.\r\n\r\n"No; we legislated against the women, but not against the men, or the\r\nthing itself. We examined the women, and fined them, and licensed\r\nthem--and never did anything against the men. Women legislators used\r\nvery different measures, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is for the good of the world," I presently admitted;\r\n"but----"\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t quite like to think of men in this new and peculiar\r\nposition of having to be good!"\r\n\r\n"Frankly--I don\'t. I\'m willing to be good, but-- I don\'t like to be\r\ngiven no choice."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, look at it. As it was, we had one way, according to what we\r\nthought was good for us. Rather than lead clean, contented lives at some\r\nexpense to ourselves in the way of moral and physical control, we\r\ndeliberately sacrificed an army of women to a horrible life and a more\r\nhorrible death, and corrupted the blood of the nation. It was on the\r\nline of health they made their stand, not on \'morality\' alone. Under our\r\nnew laws it is held a crime to poison another human being with syphilis,\r\njust as much as to use prussic acid."\r\n\r\n"Nellie said you had no crime now."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, Nellie is an optimist. I suppose she meant the old kinds and\r\ndefinitions. We don\'t call things \'crimes\' any more. And then, really,\r\nthere is not a hundredth part of the evil done that there used to be. We\r\nknow more, you see, and have less temptation."\r\n\r\nWe were silent for a while. I watched a gull float and wheel over the\r\nblue water. Big airships flew steadily along certain lines. Little ones\r\nsailed about on all sides.\r\n\r\nOne darted over our heads and lit with a soft swoop on an open\r\npromontory.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t they use to buzz?" I asked Owen.\r\n\r\n"Of course; just as the first motor boats thumped and banged abominably.\r\nWe will not stand for unnecessary noise, as we used to."\r\n\r\n"How do you stop it? More interference with the individual rights?"\r\n\r\n"More recognition of public rights. A bad noise is a nuisance, like a\r\nbad smell. We didn\'t used to mind it much--but the women did. You see,\r\nwhat women like has to be considered now."\r\n\r\n"It always was considered!" I broke in with some heat. "The women of\r\nAmerica were the most spoiled, pampered lot on earth; men gave up to\r\nthem in all ways."\r\n\r\n"At home, perhaps, but not in public. The city and state weren\'t run to\r\nsuit them at all."\r\n\r\n"Why should they be? Women belong at home. If they push into a man\'s\r\nworld they ought to take the consequences."\r\n\r\nOwen stretched his long legs and looked up at the soft, brilliant blue\r\nabove us.\r\n\r\n"Why do you call the world \'man\'s?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"It was man\'s; it ought to be. Woman\'s place is in the home. I suppose I\r\nsound like ancient history to you?" and I laughed a little shamefacedly.\r\n\r\n"We have _rather_ lost that point of view," Owen guardedly admitted.\r\n"You see----" and then he laughed. "It\'s no use, John; no matter how we\r\nput it to you it\'s a jar. The world\'s thought has changed--and you have\r\ngot to catch up!"\r\n\r\n"Suppose I refuse? Suppose I really am unable?"\r\n\r\n"We won\'t suppose it for a moment," he said cheerfully. "Ideas are not\r\nnailed down. Just take out what you had and insert some new ones. Women\r\nare people--just as much as we are; that\'s a _fact_, my dear fellow.\r\nYou\'ll have to accept it."\r\n\r\n"And are men allowed to be people, too?" I asked gloomily.\r\n\r\n"Why, of course! Nothing has interfered with our position as human\r\nbeings; it is only our sex supremacy that we have lost."\r\n\r\n"And do you _like_ it?" I demanded.\r\n\r\n"Some men made a good deal of fuss at first--the old-fashioned kind, and\r\nall the worst varieties. But modern men aren\'t worried in the least over\r\ntheir position. . . . See here, John, you don\'t grasp this--women are\r\nvastly more agreeable than they used to be."\r\n\r\nI looked at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Fact!" he said. "Of course, we loved our own mothers and daughters and\r\nsisters, more or less, no matter how they looked or what they did; and\r\nwhen we were \'in love\' there was no limit to the glory of \'the beloved\r\nobject.\' But you and I know that women were pretty unsatisfactory in the\r\nold days."\r\n\r\nI refused to admit it, but he went on calmly.\r\n\r\n"The \'wife and mother\' was generally a tired, nervous, overworked\r\ncreature. She soon lost her beauty and vigor, her charm and inspiration.\r\nWe were forever chasing fine, handsome, highly desirable young girls,\r\nand forever reducing them to weary, worn-out women--in the name of love!\r\nThe gay outsiders were always a fresh attraction--as long as we couldn\'t\r\nhave them. . . . See here, John, can\'t you understand? Our old way of\r\nusing women wasn\'t good for them--nor for us, either, by the way--but it\r\nsimply spoiled the women. They were hopelessly out of the running with\r\nus in all human lines; their business was housework, and ours was world\r\nwork. There was very little real companionship.\r\n\r\n"Now women are intelligent, experienced, well-trained citizens, fully\r\nour equals in any line of work they take up, and with us everywhere.\r\nIt\'s made the world over!"\r\n\r\n"Made it \'feminist\' through and through, I suppose!" I groaned.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit! It used to be \'masculist\' through and through; now it\'s just\r\n_human_. And, see here--women are more attractive, as women, than they\r\nused to be."\r\n\r\nI stared at this, unbelieving.\r\n\r\n"That\'s true! You see, they are healthy; there\'s a new standard of\r\nphysical beauty--very Greek--you must have noticed already the big,\r\nvigorous, fresh-colored, free-stepping girls."\r\n\r\nI had, even in my brief hours of observation.\r\n\r\n"They are far more perfect physically, better developed mentally, with a\r\nhigher moral sense--yes, you needn\'t look like that! We used to call\r\nthem our \'moral superiors,\' just because they had the one virtue we\r\ninsisted on--and we never noticed the lack in other lines. Women to-day\r\nare truthful, brave, honest, generous, self-controlled; they\r\nare--jollier, more reasonable, more companionable."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m glad to hear that," I rather grudgingly admitted. "I was\r\nafraid they would have lost all--charm."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we used to feel that way, I remember. Funny! We were convinced on\r\nthe one hand that there was nothing to a woman but her eternal\r\nwomanliness, and on the other we were desperately afraid her womanliness\r\nwould disappear the moment she turned her mind to anything else. I\r\nassure you that men love women, in general and in particular, much more\r\nthan they used to."\r\n\r\nI pondered. "But--what sort of home life do you have?"\r\n\r\n"Think for a moment of what we used to have--even in a \'happy home.\' The\r\nman had the whole responsibility of keeping it up--his business life and\r\ninterests all foreign to her. She had the whole labor of running it--the\r\ndirect manual labor in the great majority of cases--the management in\r\nany case. They were strangers in an industrial sense.\r\n\r\n"When he came home he had to drop all his line of thought--and she hers,\r\nexcept that she generally unloaded on him the burden of inadequacy in\r\nhousekeeping. Sometimes he unloaded, too. They could sympathize and\r\ncondole, but neither could help the other.\r\n\r\n"The whole thing cost like sin, too. It was a living nightmare to lots\r\nof men--and women! The only things they had in common were their\r\nchildren and \'social interests.\'\r\n\r\n"Well--nowadays, in the first place every body is easy about money.\r\n(I\'ll go into that later.) No woman marries except for love--and good\r\njudgment, too; all women are more desirable--more men want to marry\r\nthem--and that improves the men! You see, a man naturally cares more for\r\nwomen than for anything else in life--and they know it! It\'s the handle\r\nthey lift by. That\'s what has eliminated tobacco."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that these women have arbitrarily prevented\r\nsmoking?" I do not smoke myself, but I was angry nevertheless.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it, John--not a bit of it. Anybody can smoke who wants\r\nto."\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Because women do not like it."\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with it? Can\'t a man do what he wants to--even if\r\nthey don\'t like it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he can; but it costs too much. Men like tobacco, but they like\r\nlove better, old man."\r\n\r\n"Is it one of your legal requirements for marriage?"\r\n\r\n"No, not legal; but women disapprove of tobacco-y lovers, husbands,\r\nfathers; they know that the excessive use of it is injurious, and won\'t\r\nmarry a heavy smoker. But the main point is that they simply don\'t like\r\nthe smell of the stuff, or of the man who uses it--most women, that is."\r\n\r\n"But what _difference does_ it make? I dare say that most women did not\r\nlike it before, but surely a man has a right----"\r\n\r\n"To make himself a disgusting object to his wife," Owen interrupted.\r\n"Yes, he has a \'right\' to. We would have a right to bang on a tin pan, I\r\nsuppose--or to burn rubber, but he wouldn\'t be popular!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s tyranny!" I protested.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," he said, imperturbably. "We had no idea what a nuisance we\r\nused to be, that\'s all; or how much women put up with that they did not\r\nlike at all. I asked a woman once--when I was a bachelor--why she\r\nobjected to tobacco, and she frankly replied that a man who did not\r\nsmoke was much pleasanter to kiss! She was a very fascinating little\r\nwidow--I confess it made me think."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the same with liquor, I suppose? Let\'s get it all told."\r\n\r\n"Yes, only more so. Alcoholism was a race evil of the worst sort. I\r\ncannot imagine how we put up with it so long."\r\n\r\n"Is this spotless world of yours one solid temperance union?"\r\n\r\n"Practically. We use some light wines and a little spirits yet, but\r\ninfrequently--in this country, at least, and Europe is vastly improved.\r\n\r\n"But that was a much more serious thing than the other. It wasn\'t a mere\r\nmatter of not marrying! They used all kinds of means. But come on--we\'ll\r\nbe late to dinner; and dinner, at least, is still a joy, Brother John."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of the mass of information offered by my new family and the pleasant\r\nfriends we met, together with the books and publications profusely\r\npiling around me, I felt it necessary to make a species of digest for my\r\nown consideration. This I submitted to Nellie, Owen, and one or two\r\nothers, adding suggestions and corrections; and thus established in my\r\nown mind a coherent view of what had happened.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, as Owen repeatedly assured me, nothing was\r\n_done_--finished--brought to static perfection.\r\n\r\n"Thirty years isn\'t much, you see," he said cheerfully. "I dare say if\r\nyou\'d been here all along you wouldn\'t think it was such a great\r\nadvance. We have removed some obvious and utterly unnecessary evils, and\r\ncleared the ground for new beginnings; but what we are going to do is\r\nthe exciting thing!\r\n\r\n"Now you think it is so wonderful that we have no poverty. We think it\r\nis still more wonderful that a world of even partially sane people could\r\nhave borne poverty so long."\r\n\r\nWe naturally discussed this point a good deal, and they brought up a\r\nlittle party of the new economists to enlighten me--Dr. Harkness,\r\nsociologist; Mr. Alfred Brown, Department of Production; Mrs. Allerton\r\nof the Local Transportation Bureau; and a young fellow named Pike, who\r\nhad written a little book on "Distinctive Changes of Three Decades,"\r\nwhich I found very useful.\r\n\r\n"It was such a simple matter, after all, you see," the sociologist\r\nexplained to me, in an amiable class-room manner.\r\n\r\n"Suppose now you were considering the poverty of one family, an isolated\r\nfamily, sir. Now, if this family was poor, it would be due to the\r\nlimitations of the individual or of the environment. Limitations of the\r\nindividual would cover inefficiency, false theory of industry,\r\nill-judged division of labor, poor system of production, or misuse of\r\nproduct. Limitation of environment would, of course, apply to climate,\r\nsoil, natural products, etc. No amount of health, intelligence or virtue\r\ncould make Iceland rich--if it was completely isolated; nor England, for\r\nthat matter, owing to the inexorable limitations of that environment.\r\n\r\n"Here in this country we have no complaint to make of our natural\r\nresources. The soil is capable of sustaining an enormous population. So\r\nwe have merely to consider the limitations of individuals, transferring\r\nour problem from the isolated family to the general public.\r\n\r\n"What do we find? All the limitations I enumerated! Inefficiency--nearly\r\nevery one below par in working power in the generation before\r\nlast, as well as miserably educated; false theories of industry\r\neverywhere--idiotic notions as to what work was \'respectable\' and what\r\nwasn\'t, more idiotic notions of payment; worst of all, most idiotic\r\nideas that work was a curse . . . Might as well call digestion a curse!\r\nDear! Dear! How benighted we were!\r\n\r\n"Then there was ill-judged division of labor--almost universal; that\r\nevil. For instance, look at this one point; half the workers of the\r\nworld, nearly, were restricted to one class of labor, and that in the\r\nlowest industrial grade."\r\n\r\n"He means women, in housework, John," Nellie interpolated. "We never\r\nused to think of that as part of our economic problem."\r\n\r\n"It was a very serious part," the professor continued, hastily\r\nforestalling the evident intention of Mr. Brown to strike in, "but there\r\nwere many others. The obvious utility of natural specialization in labor\r\nseemed scarcely to occur to us. Our system of production was archaic in\r\nthe extreme; practically _no_ system was followed."\r\n\r\n"You must give credit to the work of the Department of Agriculture, Dr.\r\nHarkness," urged Mr. Brown, "the introduction of new fruits, the\r\nimprovement of stocks----"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," agreed Dr. Harkness, "the rudiments were there, of course;\r\nbut no real grasp of organized productivity. And as to misuse of\r\nproduct--why, my dear Mr. Robertson, it is a wonder anybody had enough\r\nto live on in those days, in view of our criminal waste.\r\n\r\n"The real turning point, Mr. Robertson, if we can put our finger on one,\r\nis where the majority of the people recognized the folly and evil of\r\npoverty--and saw it to be a thing of our own making. We saw that our\r\nworst poverty was poverty in the stock--that we raised a terrible\r\npercentage of poor people. Then we established a temporary Commission on\r\nHuman Efficiency, away back in 1913 or 14----"\r\n\r\n"Thirteen," put in Mr. Pike, who sat back listening to Dr. Harkness with\r\nan air of repressed superiority.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said the eminent sociologist courteously. "These young\r\nfellows have it all at their fingers\' ends, Mr. Robertson. Better\r\nmethods in education nowadays, far better! As I was saying, we\r\nestablished a Commission on Human Efficiency."\r\n\r\n"You will remember the dawning notions of \'scientific management\' we\r\nbegan to have in the first decade of the new century," Mrs. Allerton\r\nquietly suggested. "It occurred to us later to apply it to\r\nourselves--and we did."\r\n\r\n"The Commission found that the majority of human beings were not\r\nproperly reared," Dr. Harkness resumed, "with a resultant low standard\r\nof efficiency--shockingly low; and that the loss was not merely to the\r\nindividual but to the community. Then Society stretched out a long arm\r\nand took charge of the work of humaniculture--began to lift the human\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t burden you with details on that line at present; it touched but\r\none cause of poverty after all. The false theory of industry was next to\r\nbe changed. A few farseeing persons were already writing and talking\r\nabout work as an organic social function, but the sudden spread of it\r\ncame through the new religion."\r\n\r\n"_And_ the new voters, Dr. Harkness," my sister added.\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her benevolently. A large, comfortable, full-bearded, rosy\r\nold gentleman was Dr. Harkness, and evidently in full enjoyment of his\r\npresent task.\r\n\r\n"Let us never forget the new voters, of course. They have ceased to be\r\nthought of as new, Mr. Robertson--so easily does the human mind accept\r\nestablished conditions. The new religion urged work--normal,\r\nwell-adapted work--as _the_ duty of life--as life itself; and the new\r\nvoters accepted this idea as one woman.\r\n\r\n"They were, as a class, used to doing their duty in patient industry,\r\ngenerally distasteful to them; and the opportunity of doing work they\r\nliked--with a sense of higher duty added--was universally welcomed."\r\n\r\n"I certainly remember a large class of women who practiced no industry\r\nat all--no duty, either, unless what they called \'social duties,\'" I\r\nrather sourly remarked. Mrs. Allerton took me up with sudden heat:\r\n\r\n"Yes, there were such, in large numbers, in our great cities\r\nparticularly; but public opinion was rising against them even as far\r\nback as 1910. The more progressive women turned the light on them first,\r\nand then men took it up and began to see that this domestic pet was not\r\nonly expensive and useless but injurious and absurd. I don\'t suppose we\r\ncan realize," she continued meditatively, "how complete the change in\r\npublic opinion is--and how supremely important. In visible material\r\nprogress we have only followed simple lines, quite natural and obvious,\r\nand accomplished what was perfectly possible at any time--if we had only\r\nthought so."\r\n\r\n"_That\'s_ the point!" Mr. Pike was unable to preserve his air of\r\nrestraint any longer, and burst forth volubly.\r\n\r\n"That was the greatest, the most sudden, the most vital of our changes,\r\nsir--the change in the world\'s thought! Ideas are the real things, sir!\r\nBrick and mortar? Bah! We can put brick and mortar in any shape we\r\nchoose--but we have to choose first! What held the old world back was\r\nnot facts--not conditions--not any material limitations, or psychic\r\nlimitations either. We had every constituent of human happiness,\r\nsir--except the sense to use them. The channel of progress was\r\nobstructed with a deposit of prehistoric ideas. We choked up our\r\nchildren\'s minds with this mental refuse as we choked our rivers and\r\nharbors with material refuse, sir."\r\n\r\nDr. Harkness still smiled. "Mr. Pike was in my class ten years ago," he\r\nobserved amiably. "I always said he was the brightest young man I had.\r\nWe are all very proud of Mr. Pike."\r\n\r\nMr. Pike seemed not over pleased with this communication, and the old\r\ngentleman went on:\r\n\r\n"He is entirely right. Our idiotic ideas and theories were the main\r\ncauses of poverty after all. The new views on economics--true social\r\neconomics, not the \'dismal science\'; with the blaze of the new religion\r\nto show what was right and wrong, and the sudden uprising of half the\r\nadult world--the new voters--to carry out the new ideas; these were what\r\nchanged things! There you have it, Mr. Robertson, in a nutshell--rather\r\na large nutshell, a pericarp, as it were--but I think that covers it."\r\n\r\n"We students used always to admire Dr. Harkness\' power of easy\r\ngeneralization," said Mr. Pike, in a mild, subacid tone, "but if any\r\nground of inquiry is left to you, Mr. Robertson, I could, perhaps,\r\nilluminate some special points."\r\n\r\nDr. Harkness laughed in high good humor, and clapped his whilom pupil on\r\nthe back.\r\n\r\n"You have the floor, Mr. Pike--I shall listen to you with edification."\r\n\r\nThe young man looked a little ashamed of his small irony, and continued\r\nmore genially:\r\n\r\n"Our first step--or one of our first steps, for we advanced like a\r\nstrenuous centipede--was to check the birth of defectives and\r\ndegenerates. Certain classes of criminals and perverts were rendered\r\nincapable of reproducing their kind. In the matter of those diseases\r\nmost injurious to the young, very stringent measures were taken. It was\r\nmade a felony to infect wife or child knowingly, and a misdemeanor if it\r\nwere done unknowingly. Physicians were obliged to report all cases of\r\ninfectious disease, and young girls were clearly taught the consequence\r\nof marriage with infected persons. The immediate result was, of course,\r\na great decrease in marriage; but the increase in population was scarce\r\nchecked at all because of the lowered death rate among children. It was\r\nchecked a little; but for twenty years now, it has been recovering\r\nitself. We increase a little too fast now, but see every hope of a\r\nbalanced population long before the resources of the world are\r\nexhausted."\r\n\r\nMr. Brown seized upon a second moment\'s pause to suggest that the\r\nworld\'s resources were vastly increased also--and still increasing.\r\n\r\n"Let Pike rest a moment and get his breath," he said, warming to the\r\nsubject, "I want to tell Mr. Robertson that the productivity of the\r\nearth is gaining every year. Here\'s this old earth feeding us\r\nall--laying golden eggs as it were; and we used to get those eggs by the\r\nC\xc3\xa6sarian operation! We uniformly exhausted the soil--uniformly! Now a\r\nman would no more think of injuring the soil, the soil that feeds him,\r\nthan he would of hurting his mother. We steadily improve the soil; we\r\nimprove the seed; we improve methods of culture; we improve everything."\r\n\r\nMrs. Allerton struck in here, "Not forgetting the methods of\r\ntransportation, Mr. Robertson. There was one kind of old world folly\r\nwhich made great waste of labor and time; that was our constant desire\r\nto eat things out of season. There is now a truer sense of what is\r\nreally good eating; no one wants to eat asparagus that is not of the\r\nbest, and asparagus cut five or ten days cannot be really good. We do\r\nnot carry things about unnecessarily; and the carrying we do is swift,\r\neasy and economical. For slow freight we use waterways wherever\r\npossible--you will be pleased to see the \'all-water routes\' that thread\r\nthe country now. And our roads--you haven\'t seen our roads yet! We lead\r\nthe world."\r\n\r\n"We used to be at the foot of the class as to roads, did we not?" I\r\nasked; and Mr. Pike swiftly answered:\r\n\r\n"We did, indeed, sir. But that very need of good roads made easy to us\r\nthe second step in abolishing poverty. Here was a great social need\r\ncalling for labor; here were thousands of men calling for employment;\r\nand here were we keeping the supply from the demand by main\r\nstrength--merely from those archaic ideas of ours.\r\n\r\n"We had a mass of valuable data already collected, and now that the\r\nwhole country teemed with new ideals of citizenship and statesmanship,\r\nit did not take very long to get the two together."\r\n\r\n"We furnished employment for all the women, too," my sister added. "A\r\nSocial Service Union was formed the country over; it was part of the new\r\nreligion. Every town has one--men and women. The same spirit that used\r\nto give us crusaders and missionaries now gave plenty of enthusiastic\r\nworkers."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see yet how you got up any enthusiasm about work," said I.\r\n\r\n"It was not work for oneself," Nellie explained. "That is what used to\r\nmake it so sordid; we used really to believe that we were working each\r\nfor himself. This new idea was overwhelming in its simplicity--and\r\ntruth; work is social service--social service is religion--that\'s about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Not only so," Dr. Harkness added, "it made a three-fold appeal; to the\r\nold, deep-seated religious sense; to the new, vivid intellectual\r\nacceptance; and to the very widespread, wholesome appreciation of a\r\nclear advantage.\r\n\r\n"When a thing was offered to the world that agreed with every social\r\ninstinct, that appealed to common sense, that was established by the\r\nhighest scientific authority, and that had the overwhelming sanction of\r\nreligion--why the world took to it."\r\n\r\n"But it is surely not natural to people to work--much less to like to\r\nwork!" I protested.\r\n\r\n"There\'s where the change comes in," Mr. Pike eagerly explained. "We\r\nused to _think_ that people hated work--nothing of the sort! What people\r\nhated was too much work, which is death; work they were personally unfit\r\nfor and therefore disliked, which is torture; work under improper\r\nconditions, which is disease; work held contemptible, looked down upon\r\nby other people, which is a grievous social distress; and work so\r\nill-paid that no human beings could really live by it."\r\n\r\n"Why Mr. Robertson, if you can throw any light on the now inconceivable\r\nfolly of that time so utterly behind us, we shall be genuinely indebted\r\nto you. It was quite understood in your day that the whole world\'s life,\r\ncomfort, prosperity and progress depended upon the work done, was it\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course; that was an economic platitude," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Then why were the workers punished for doing it?"\r\n\r\n"Punished? What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean just what I say. They were punished, just as we punish\r\ncriminals--with confinement at hard labor. The great mass of the people\r\nwere forced to labor for cruelly long hours at dull, distasteful\r\noccupations; is not that punishment?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," I said hotly. "They were free at any time to leave an\r\noccupation they did not like."\r\n\r\n"Leave it for what alternative?"\r\n\r\n"To take up another," said I, perceiving that this, after all, was not\r\nmuch of an escape.\r\n\r\n"Yes, to take up another under the same heavy conditions, if there was\r\nany opening; or to starve--that was their freedom."\r\n\r\n"Well, what would you have?" I asked. "A man must work for his living\r\nsurely."\r\n\r\n"Remember your economic platitude, Mr. Robertson," Dr. Harkness\r\nsuggested. "The whole world\'s life, comfort, prosperity and progress\r\ndepends upon the work done, you know. It was not _their_ living they\r\nwere working for; it was the world\'s."\r\n\r\n"That is very pretty as a sentiment," I was beginning; but his twinkling\r\neye reminded that an economic platitude is not precisely sentimental.\r\n\r\n"That\'s where the change came," Mr. Pike eagerly repeated. "The idea\r\nthat each man had to do it for himself kept us blinded to the fact that\r\nit was all social service; that they worked for the world, and the world\r\ntreated them shamefully--so shamefully that their product was\r\ndeteriorated, markedly deteriorated."\r\n\r\n"You will be continually surprised, Mr. Robertson, at the improvements\r\nof our output," remarked Mr. Brown. "We have standards in every form of\r\nmanufacture, required standards; and to label an article incorrectly is\r\na misdemeanor."\r\n\r\n"That was just starting in the pure-food agitation, you remember," my\r\nsister put in--(\'with apple juice containing one-tenth of one per cent,\r\nof benzoate of soda\').\r\n\r\n"And now," Mr. Brown continued, "\'all wool\' is all wool; if it isn\'t,\r\nyou can have the dealer arrested. Silk is silk, nowadays, and cream is\r\ncream."\r\n\r\n"And \'caveat emptor\' is a dead letter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is \'caveat vendor\' now. You see, selling goods is public\r\nservice."\r\n\r\n"You apply that term quite differently from what it stood for in my\r\nmemory," said I.\r\n\r\n"It used to mean some sort of beneficent statesmanship, at first,"\r\nNellie agreed. "Then it spread to various philanthropic efforts and\r\nwider grades of government activities. Now it means any kind of world\r\nwork."\r\n\r\nShe saw that this description did not carry much weight with me, and\r\nadded, "Any kind of human work, John; that is, work a man gives his\r\nwhole time to and does not himself consume, is world work--is social\r\nservice."\r\n\r\n"If a man raises, by his own labor, just enough to feed himself--that is\r\nworking for himself," Mr. Brown explained, "but if he raises more corn\r\nthan he consumes, he is serving humanity."\r\n\r\n"But he does not give it away," I urged; "he is paid for it."\r\n\r\n"Well, you paid the doctor who saved your child\'s life, but the doctor\'s\r\nwork was social service none the less--and the teacher\'s--anybody\'s."\r\n\r\n"But that kind of work benefits humanity--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and does it not benefit humanity to eat--to have shoes and clothes\r\nand houses? John, John, wake up!" Nellie for the first time showed\r\nimpatience with me. But my brother-in-law extended a protecting arm.\r\n\r\n"Now, Nellie, don\'t hurry him. This thing will burst upon him all at\r\nonce. Of course, it\'s glaringly plain, but there was a time when you and\r\nI did not see it either."\r\n\r\nI was a little sulky. "Well, as far as I gather," and I took out my note\r\nbook, "people all of a sudden changed all their ideas about\r\neverything--and your demi-millennium followed."\r\n\r\n"I wish we could say that," said Mrs. Allerton. "We are not telling you\r\nof our present day problems and difficulties, you see. No, Mr.\r\nRobertson, we have merely removed our most obvious and patently\r\nunnecessary difficulties, of which poverty was at least the largest.\r\n\r\n"What we did, as we have rather confusedly suggested, I\'m afraid, was to\r\nestablish such measures as to insure better births, and vastly better\r\nenvironment and education for every child. That raised the standard of\r\nthe people, you see, and increased their efficiency. Then we provided\r\nemployment for everyone, under good conditions, and improved the world\r\nin two ways at once."\r\n\r\n"And who paid for this universal employment?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Who paid for it before?" she returned promptly.\r\n\r\n"The employer, of course."\r\n\r\n"Did he? Out of his own private pocket? At a loss to himself."\r\n\r\n"Why, of course not," I replied, a little nettled. "Out of the profits\r\nof the business."\r\n\r\n"And \'the business\' was the work done by the employees?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all! He did it himself; they only furnished the labor."\r\n\r\n"Could he do it alone--without \'labor?\' Did he furnish employment as a\r\npiece of beneficence, outside of his business--Ah, Mr. Robertson, surely\r\nit is clear that unless a man\'s labor furnished a profit to his\r\nemployer, he would not be employed. It was on that profit that \'labor\'\r\nwas paid--they paid themselves. They do now, but at a higher rate."\r\n\r\nI was annoyed by this clever juggling with the hard facts of business.\r\n\r\n"That is very convincing, Mrs. Allerton," I said with some warmth, "but\r\nit unfortunately omits certain factors. A lot of laborers could make a\r\ngiven article, of course; but they could not sell it--and that is where\r\nthe profit comes in. What good would it do the laborer to pile up goods\r\nif he could not sell them?"\r\n\r\n"And what good would be the ability to sell goods if there were none,\r\nMr. Robertson. Of course, I recognize the importance of transportation;\r\nthat is my own line of work, but there must be something to transport.\r\nAs long ago as St. Paul\'s day it was known that the hand could not say\r\nto the foot, \'I have no need of thee.\'"\r\n\r\n"To cover that ground more easily, Mr. Robertson," Dr. Harkness\r\nexplained, "just put down in your digest there that Bureaus of\r\nEmployment were formed all over the country; some at first were of\r\nindividual initiative, but in a few years\' time all were in government\r\nmanagement. There was a swift and general improvement in the whole\r\ncountry. The roads became models to the world, the harbors were cleared,\r\ncanals dug, cities rebuilt, bare hills reforested, the value of our\r\nnational property doubled and trebled--all owing to the employment of\r\nhitherto neglected labor. Out of the general increase of wealth they got\r\ntheir share, of course. And where there is work for everyone, at good\r\nwages, there is no poverty; that\'s clearly seen."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe country was as astonishing to me as the city--its old beauty added\r\nto in every direction. They took me about in motor cars, motor boats and\r\nair ships, on foot and on horseback (the only horses now to be found\r\nwere in the country). And while I speak of horses, I will add that the\r\nonly dogs and cats I saw, or heard, were in the country, too, and not\r\nvery numerous at that.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve changed our views as to \'pets\' and \'domestic animals,\'" Nellie\r\nsaid. "We ourselves are the only domestic animals allowed now. Meat\r\neating, as Hallie told you, is decreasing every day; but the care and\r\nhandling of our food animals improves even more rapidly. Every city has\r\nits municipal pastures and dairies, and every village or residence\r\ngroup. By the way, I might as well show you one of those last, and get\r\nit clear in your mind."\r\n\r\nWe were on an air trip in one of the smooth-going, noiseless machines\r\ncommonly used, which opened a new world of delight to me. This one held\r\ntwo, with the aviator. I had inquired about accidents, and was glad to\r\nfind that thirty years\' practice had eliminated the worst dangers and\r\nreared a race of flying men.\r\n\r\n"In our educational plan to-day all the children are given full physical\r\ndevelopment and control," my sister explained. "That goes back to the\r\nwoman again--the mothers. There was a sort of Hellenic revival--a\r\nrecognition that it was possible for us to rear as beautiful human\r\nbeings as walked in Athens. When women were really free of man\'s\r\nselective discrimination they proved quite educable, and learned to be\r\nashamed of their deformities. Then we began to appreciate the human body\r\nand to have children reared in an atmosphere of lovely form and color,\r\nstatues and pictures all about them, and the new stories--Oh! I haven\'t\r\ntold you a thing about them, have I?"\r\n\r\n"No," I said; "and please don\'t. I started out to see the country, and\r\nyour new-fangled \'residence groups,\' whatever they may be, and I refuse\r\nto have my mind filled up with educational information. Take me on a\r\nschool expedition another time, please."\r\n\r\n"All right," she agreed; "but I can tell you more about the beasts\r\nwithout distracting your mind, I hope. For one thing, we have no longer\r\nany menageries."\r\n\r\n"What?" I cried. "No menageries! How absurd! They were certainly\r\neducational, and a great pleasure to children--and other people."\r\n\r\n"Our views of education have changed you see," she replied; "and our\r\nviews of human relation to the animal world; also our ideas of pleasure.\r\nPeople do not think it a pleasure now to watch animals in pain."\r\n\r\n"More absurdity! They were not in pain. They were treated better than\r\nwhen left wild," I hotly replied.\r\n\r\n"Imprisonment is never a pleasure," she answered; "it is a terrible\r\npunishment. A menagerie is just a prison, not for any offense of the\r\ninmates, but to gratify men in the indulgence of grossly savage\r\nimpulses. Children, being in the savage period of their growth, feel\r\nanew the old satisfaction of seeing their huge enemies harmless or their\r\nsmall victims helpless and unable to escape. But it did no human being\r\nany good."\r\n\r\n"How about the study of these \'victims\' of yours--the scientific value?"\r\n\r\n"For such study as is really necessary to us, or to them, some\r\nlaboratories keep a few. Otherwise, the student goes to where the\r\nanimals live and studies their real habits."\r\n\r\n"And how much would he learn of wild tigers by following them\r\nabout--unless it was an inside view?"\r\n\r\n"My dear brother, can you mention one single piece of valuable\r\ninformation for humanity to be found in the study of imprisoned tigers?\r\nAs a matter of fact, I don\'t think there are any left by this time; I\r\nhope not."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me that your new humanitarianism has exterminated\r\nwhole species?"\r\n\r\n"Why not? Would England be pleasant if the gray wolf still ran at large?\r\nWe are now trying, as rapidly as possible, to make this world safe and\r\nhabitable everywhere."\r\n\r\n"And how about the hunting? Where\'s the big game?"\r\n\r\n"Another relic of barbarism. There is very little big game left, and\r\nvery little hunting."\r\n\r\nI glared at her, speechless. Not that I was ever a hunter myself, or\r\neven wanted to be; but to have that splendid manly sport utterly\r\nprevented--it was outrageous! "I suppose this is more of the women\'s\r\nwork," I said at length.\r\n\r\nShe cheerfully admitted it. "Yes, we did it. You see, hunting as a means\r\nof livelihood is even lower than private housework--far too wasteful and\r\nexpensive to be allowed in a civilized world. When women left off using\r\nskins and feathers, that was a great blow to the industry. As to the\r\nsport, why, we had never greatly admired it, you know--the manly sport\r\nof killing things for fun--and with our new power we soon made it\r\nundesirable."\r\n\r\nI groaned in spirit. "Do you mean to tell me that you have introduced\r\nlegislation against hunting, and found means to enforce it?"\r\n\r\n"We found means to enforce it without much legislation, John."\r\n\r\n"As for instance?"\r\n\r\n"As for instance, in rearing children who saw and heard the fullest\r\ncondemnation of all such primitive cruelty. That is another place where\r\nthe new story-books come in. Why on earth we should have fed our\r\nchildren on silly savagery a thousand years old, just because they liked\r\nit, is more than I can see. We were always interfering with their likes\r\nand dislikes in other ways. Why so considerate in this? We have a lot of\r\nsplendid writers now--first-class ones--making a whole lot of new\r\nliterature for children."\r\n\r\n"Do leave out your story books. You were telling me how you redoubtable\r\nfemales coerced men into giving up hunting."\r\n\r\n"Mostly by disapproval, consistent and final."\r\n\r\nThis was the same sort of thing Owen had referred to in regard to\r\ntobacco. I didn\'t like it. It gave me a creepy feeling, as of one slowly\r\nsurmounted by a rising tide. "Are you--do you mean to tell me, Nellie,\r\nthat you women are trying to make men over to suit yourselves?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Why not? Didn\'t you make women to suit yourselves for several\r\nthousand years? You bred and trained us to suit your tastes; you liked\r\nus small, you liked us weak, you liked us timid, you liked us ignorant,\r\nyou liked us pretty--what you called pretty--and you eliminated the\r\nkinds you did not like."\r\n\r\n"How, if you please?"\r\n\r\n"By the same process we use--by not marrying them. Then, you see, there\r\naren\'t any more of that kind."\r\n\r\n"You are wrong, Nellie--you\'re absurdly wrong. Women were naturally that\r\nway; that is, womanly women were, and men preferred that kind, of\r\ncourse."\r\n\r\n"How do you know women were \'naturally\' like that?--without special\r\neducation and artificial selection, and all manner of restrictions and\r\npenalties? Where were any women ever allowed to grow up \'naturally\'\r\nuntil now?"\r\n\r\nI maintained a sulky silence, looking down at the lovely green fields\r\nand forests beneath. "Have you exterminated dogs?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Not yet. There are a good many real dogs left. But we don\'t make\r\nartificial ones any more."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you keep all the cats--being women." She laughed.\r\n\r\n"No; we keep very few. Cats kill birds, and we need the birds for our\r\nfarms and gardens. They keep the insects down."\r\n\r\n"Do they keep the mice down, too?"\r\n\r\n"Owls and night-hawks do, as far as they can. But we attend to the mice\r\nourselves. Concrete construction and the removal of the kitchen did\r\nthat. We do not live in food warehouses now. There, look! We are coming\r\nto Westholm Park; that was one of the first."\r\n\r\nIn all the beauty spread below me, the great park showed more beautiful,\r\noutlined by a thick belt of trees.\r\n\r\nWe kept our vehicle gliding slowly above it while Nellie pointed things\r\nout. "It\'s about 300 acres," she said. "You can see the woodland and\r\nempty part--all that is left wild. That big patch there is\r\npasturage--they keep their own sheep and cows. There are gardens and\r\nmeadows. Up in the corner is the children\'s playground, bathing pool,\r\nand special buildings. Here is the playground for grown-ups--and their\r\nlake. This big spreading thing is the guest-house and general playhouse\r\nfor the folks--ballroom, billiards, bowling, and so on. Behind it is the\r\nplant for the whole thing. The water tower you\'ll see to more advantage\r\nwhen we land. And all around you see the homes; each family has an acre\r\nor so."\r\n\r\nWe dropped softly to the landing platform and came down to the pleasure\r\nground beneath. In a little motor we ran about the place for awhile,\r\nthat I might see the perfect roads, shaded with arching trees, the\r\nendless variety of arrangement, the miles of flowers, the fruit on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"You must have had a good landscape architect to plan this," I\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n"We did--one of the best."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not so very unlike a great, first-class summer hotel, with\r\nsingularly beautiful surroundings."\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s not," she agreed. "We had our best summer resorts in mind when\r\nwe began to plan these places. People used to pay heavily in summer to\r\nenjoy a place where everything was done to make life smooth and\r\npleasant. It occurred to us at last that we might live that way."\r\n\r\n"Who wants to live in a summer hotel all the time? Excuse _me_!\r\n\r\n"O, they don\'t. The people here nearly all live in \'homes\'--the homiest\r\nkind--each on its own ground, as you see. Only some unattached ones, and\r\npeople who really like it, live in the hotel--with transients, of\r\ncourse. Let\'s call here; I know this family."\r\n\r\nShe introduced me to Mrs. Masson, a sweet, motherly little woman,\r\nrocking softly on her vine-shadowed piazza, a child in her arms. She was\r\neager to tell me about things--most people were, I found.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a reactionary, Mr. Robertson. I prefer to work at home, and I\r\nprefer to keep my children with me, all I can."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that allowed nowadays?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"O, yes; if one qualifies. I did. I took the child-culture course, but I\r\ndo not want to be a regular teacher. My work is done right here, and I\r\ncan have them as well as not, but they won\'t stay much."\r\n\r\nEven as she spoke the little thing in her arms whispered eagerly to her\r\nmother, slipped to the floor, ran out of the gate, her little pink legs\r\nfairly twinkling, and joined an older child who was passing.\r\n\r\n"They like to be with the others, you see. This is my baby; I manage to\r\nhold on to her for part of the day, but she\'s always running off to The\r\nGarden when she can."\r\n\r\n"The Garden?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; it\'s a regular Child Garden, where they are cultivated and grow!\r\nAnd they do so love to grow!"\r\n\r\nShe showed us her pretty little house and her lovely work--embroidery.\r\n"I\'m so fortunate," she said, "loving home as I do, to have work that\'s\r\njust as well done here."\r\n\r\nI learned that there were some thirty families living in the grounds,\r\nnot counting the hotel people. Quite a number found their work in the\r\nnecessary activities of the place itself.\r\n\r\n"We have a long string of places, you see--from the general manager to\r\nthe gardeners and dairymen. It is really quite a piece of work, to care\r\nfor some two hundred and fifty people," Mrs. Masson explained with some\r\npride.\r\n\r\n"Instead of a horde of servants and small tradesmen to make a living off\r\nthese thirty families, we have a small corps of highly trained\r\nofficers," added Nellie.\r\n\r\n"And do you co-operate in housekeeping?" I inquired, meaning no harm,\r\nthough my sister was quite severe with me for this slip.\r\n\r\n"No, _indeed_," protested Mrs. Masson. "I do despise being mixed up with\r\nother families. I\'ve been here nearly a year, and I hardly know anyone."\r\nAnd she rocked back and forth, complacently.\r\n\r\n"But I thought that the meals were co-operative."\r\n\r\n"O, not at _all_--_not at all_! Just see my dining-room! And you must be\r\ntired and hungry, now, Mrs. Robertson--don\'t say no! I\'ll have lunch in\r\na moment. Excuse me, please."\r\n\r\nShe retired to the telephone, but we could hear her ordering lunch.\r\n"Right away, please; No. 5; no, let me see--No. 7, please. And have you\r\nfresh mushrooms? Extra; four plates."\r\n\r\nHer husband came home in time for the meal, and she presided just like\r\nany other little matron over a pretty table and a daintily served lunch;\r\nbut it came down from the hotel in a neat, light case, to which the\r\nremnants and the dishes were returned.\r\n\r\n"O, I wouldn\'t give up my own table for the world! And my own dishes;\r\nthey take excellent care of them. Our breakfasts we get all\r\ntogether--see my kitchen!" And she proudly exhibited a small, light\r\ncloset, where an immaculate porcelain sink, with hot and cold water, a\r\nglass-doored "cold closet" and a shining electric stove, allowed the\r\npreparation of many small meals.\r\n\r\nNellie smiled blandly as she saw this little lady claiming conservatism\r\nin what struck me as being quite sufficiently progressive, while Mr.\r\nMasson smiled in proud content.\r\n\r\n"I took you there on purpose," she told me later. "She is really quite\r\nreactionary for nowadays, and not over popular. Come and see the\r\nguest-house."\r\n\r\nThis was a big, widespread concrete building, with terraces and\r\nbalconies and wide roofs, where people strolled and sat. It rose proudly\r\nfrom its wide lawns and blooming greenery, a picture of peace and\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n"It\'s like a country club, with more sleeping rooms," I suggested. "But\r\nisn\'t it awfully expensive--the year round?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s about a third cheaper than it would cost these people to live if\r\nthey kept house. Funny! It took nearly twenty years to prove that\r\norganization in housekeeping paid, like any other form of organized\r\nlabor. Wages have risen, all the work is better done and it costs much\r\nless. You can see all that. But what you can\'t possibly realize is the\r\ndifference it makes to women. All the change the men feel is in better\r\nfood, no fret and worry at home, and smaller bills."\r\n\r\n"That\'s something," I modestly suggested.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s a good deal; but to the women it\'s a thousand times more.\r\nThe women who liked that kind of work are doing it now, as a profession,\r\nfor reasonable hours and excellent salaries; and the women who did not\r\nlike it are now free to do the work they are fitted for and enjoy. This\r\nis one of our great additions to the world\'s wealth--freeing so much\r\nproductive energy. It has improved our health, too. One of the worst\r\ncauses of disease is mal-position, you know. Almost everybody used to\r\nwork at what they did not like--and we thought it was beneficial to\r\ncharacter!"\r\n\r\nI tried without prejudice to realize the new condition, but a house\r\nwithout a housewife, without children, without servants, seemed\r\naltogether empty. Nellie reassured me as to the children, however.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no worse than when they went to school, John, not a bit. If you\r\nwere here at about 9 A.M., you\'d see the mothers taking a morning walk,\r\nor ride if it\'s stormy, to the child-garden, and leaving the babies\r\nthere, asleep mostly. There are seldom more than five or six real little\r\nones at one time in a group like this."\r\n\r\n"Do mothers leave their nursing babies there?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes; it depends on the kind of work they do. Remember they only\r\nhave to work two hours, and many mothers get ahead on their work and\r\ntake a year off at baby time. Still, two hours\' work a day that one\r\nenjoys, does not hurt even a nursing mother."\r\n\r\nI found it extremely difficult from the first, to picture a world whose\r\nworking day was but two hours long; or even the four hours they told me\r\nwas generally given.\r\n\r\n"What do people do with the rest of their time; working people, I mean?"\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\n"The old ones usually rest a good deal, loaf, visit one another, play\r\ngames, in some cases they travel. Others, who have the working habit\r\ningrained, keep on in the afternoon; in their gardens often; almost all\r\nold people love gardening; and those who wish, have one now, you see.\r\nThe city ones do an astonishing amount of reading, studying, going to\r\nlectures, and the theatres. They have a good time."\r\n\r\n"But I mean the low rowdy common people--don\'t they merely loaf and get\r\ndrunk?"\r\n\r\nNellie smiled at me good humoredly.\r\n\r\n"Some of them did, for a while. But it became increasingly difficult to\r\nget drunk. You see, their health was better, with sweeter homes, better\r\nfood and more pleasure; and except for the dipsomaniacs they improved in\r\ntheir tastes presently. Then their children all made a great advance,\r\nunder the new educational methods; the women had an immense power as\r\nsoon as they were independent; and between the children\'s influence and\r\nthe woman\'s _and_ the new opportunities, the worst men had to grow\r\nbetter. There was always more recuperative power in people than they\r\nwere given credit for."\r\n\r\n"But surely there were thousands, hundreds of thousands, of hoboes and\r\npaupers; wretched, degenerate creatures."\r\n\r\nNellie grew sober. "Yes, there were. One of our inherited handicaps was\r\nthat great mass of wreckage left over from the foolishness and ignorance\r\nof the years behind us. But we dealt very thoroughly with them. As I\r\ntold you before, hopeless degenerates were promptly and mercifully\r\nremoved. A large class of perverts were incapacitated for parentage and\r\nplaced where they could do no harm, and could still have some usefulness\r\nand some pleasure. Many proved curable, and were cured. And for the\r\nhelpless residue; blind and crippled through no fault of their own, a\r\nremorseful society provides safety, comfort and care; with all the\r\ndevices for occupation and enjoyment that our best minds could arrange.\r\nThese are our remaining asylums; decreasing every year. We don\'t make\r\nthat kind of people any more."\r\n\r\nWe talked as we strolled about, or sat on the stone benches under rose\r\nbush or grape vine. The beauty of the place grew on me irresistibly.\r\nEach separate family could do as they liked in their own yard, under\r\nsome restriction from the management in regard to general comfort and\r\nbeauty. I was always ready to cry out about interference with personal\r\nrights; but my sister reminded me that we were not allowed to "commit a\r\nnuisance" in the old days, only our range of objections had widened. A\r\ndisagreeable noise is now prohibited, as much as a foul smell; and\r\nconspicuously ugly forms and colors, also.\r\n\r\n"And who decides--who\'s your dictator and censor?"\r\n\r\n"Our best judges--we elect, recall and change them. But under their\r\nguidance we have developed some general sense of beauty. People would\r\ncomplain loudly now of what did not use to trouble them at all."\r\n\r\nThen I remembered that I had seen no row of wooden cows in the green\r\nmeadows, no invitation to "meet me at the fountain," no assailing finger\r\nto assure me that my credit was good, no gross cathartic reminders,\r\nnothing anywhere to mar the beauty of the landscape; but many a graceful\r\ngate, temple-like summer houses crowning the grassy hills, arbors,\r\npergolas, cool seats by stone-rimmed fountains, signs everywhere of the\r\nlove of beauty and the power to make it.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see yet how you ever manage to pay for all this extra work\r\neverywhere. I suppose in a place like this it comes out of the profit\r\nmade on food," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"No--the gardening expenses of these home clubs come out of the rent."\r\n\r\n"And what rent do they have to pay--approximately?"\r\n\r\n"I can tell you exactly about this place, because it was opened by a\r\nsort of stock company of women, and I was in it for a while. The land\r\ncost $100.00 an acre then--$30,000.00. To get it in shape cost\r\n$10,000.00, to build thirty of these houses about $4,000.00\r\napiece--there was great saving in doing it all at one time, the\r\nguest-house, furnished, was only $50,000.00, it is very simple, you see;\r\nand the general plant and child-garden, and everything else, some\r\n$40,000.00 more. I know we raised a capital of $250,000.00, and used it\r\nall. The residents pay $600.00 a year for house-rent and $100.00 more\r\nfor club privileges. That is $28,000.00. We take 4 per cent, and it\r\nleaves plenty for taxes and up-keep. Those who have children keep up the\r\nchild-garden. The hotel makes enough to keep everything going easily,\r\nand the food and service departments pay handsomely. Why, if these\r\npeople had kept on living in New York, it would have cost them\r\naltogether at least $3,000.00 a year. Here it just costs them about\r\n$2,000.00--and just see what they get for it."\r\n\r\nI had an inborn distrust of my sister\'s figures, and consulted Owen\r\nlater; also Hallie, who had much detailed knowledge on the subject; and\r\nfurthermore I did some reading.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it. The method of living of which we used to be\r\nso proud, for which I still felt a deep longing, was abominably\r\nexpensive. Much smaller amounts, wisely administered, produced better\r\nliving, and for the life of me I could not discover the cackling herds\r\nof people I had been led to expect when such "Utopian schemes" used to\r\nbe discussed in my youth.\r\n\r\nFrom the broad, shady avenues of this quiet place we looked over green\r\nhedges or wire fences thick with honeysuckle and rose, into pleasant\r\nhomelike gardens where families sat on broad piazzas, swung in hammocks,\r\nplayed tennis, ball, croquet, tetherball and badminton, just as families\r\nused to.\r\n\r\nGroups of young girls or young men--or both--strolled under the trees\r\nand disported themselves altogether as I remembered them to have done,\r\nand happy children frolicked about in the houses and gardens, all the\r\nmore happily, it would appear, because they had their own place for part\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nWe had seen the fathers come home in time for the noon meal. In the\r\nafternoon most of the parents seemed to think it the finest thing in the\r\nworld to watch their children learning or playing together, in that\r\namazing Garden of theirs, or to bring them home for more individual\r\ncompanionship. As a matter of fact, I had never seen, in any group of\r\nhomes that I could recall, so much time given to children by so many\r\nparents--unless on a Sunday in the suburbs.\r\n\r\nI was very silent on the way back, revolving these things in my mind.\r\nPoint by point it seemed so vividly successful, so plainly advantageous,\r\nso undeniably enjoyed by those who lived there; and yet the old\r\nobjections surged up continually.\r\n\r\nThe "noisy crowd all herding together to eat!"--I remembered Mr.\r\nMasson\'s quiet dining-room--they all had dining-rooms, it appeared. The\r\n"dreadful separation of children from their parents!" I thought of all\r\nthose parents watching with intelligent interest their children\'s\r\nguarded play, or enjoying their companionship at home.\r\n\r\nThe "forced jumble with disagreeable neighbors!" I recalled those\r\nsheltered quiet grounds; each house with its trees and lawn, its garden\r\nand its outdoor games.\r\n\r\nIt was against all my habits, principles, convictions, theories, and\r\nsentiments; but there it was, and they seemed to like it. Also, Owen\r\nassured me, it paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all, it takes time for a great change in world-thought to strike\r\nin. That\'s what Owen insisted on calling it. He maintained that the\r\namazing uprush of these thirty years was really due to the wholesale\r\nacceptance and application of the idea of evolution.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know which to call more important--the new idea, or the new\r\npower to use it," he said. "When we were young, practically all men of\r\nscience accepted the evolutionary theory of life; and it was in general\r\npopular favor, though little understood. But the governing ideas of all\r\nour earlier time were so completely out of touch with life; so\r\nimpossible of any useful application, that the connection between belief\r\nand behavior was rusted out of us. Between our detached religious ideas\r\nand our brutal ignorance of brain culture, we had made ourselves\r\npreternaturally inefficient.\r\n\r\n"Then--you remember the talk there was about Mental Healing--\'Power in\r\nRepose\'--\'The Human Machine\'--or was that a bit later? Anyway, people\r\nhad begun to waken up to the fact that they could do things with their\r\nbrains. At first they used them only to cure diseases, to maintain an\r\nartificial \'peace of mind,\' and tricks like that. Then it suddenly burst\r\nupon us--two or three important books came along nearly at once, and\r\nhosts of articles--that we could use this wonderful mental power every\r\nday, to _live_ with! That all these scientific facts and laws had an\r\napplication to life--human life."\r\n\r\nI nodded appreciatively. I was getting quite fond of my brother-in-law.\r\nWe were in a small, comfortable motor boat, gliding swiftly and\r\nnoiselessly up the beautiful Hudson. Its blue cleanness was a joy. I\r\ncould see fish--real fish--in the clear water when we were still.\r\n\r\nThe banks were one long succession of gardens, palaces, cottages and\r\nrich woodlands, charming to view.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the _time_ that puzzles me more than anything," I said, "even more\r\nthan the money. How on earth so much could be done in so little time!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you conceive of it as being done in one place after\r\nanother, instead of in every place at once," Owen replied. "If one city,\r\nin one year, could end the smoke at once," Owen replied. "If one city,\r\nin one year, could end the smoke nuisance, so could all the cities on\r\nearth, if they chose to. We chose to, all over the country, practically\r\nat once."\r\n\r\n"But you speak of evolution. Evolution is the slowest of slow processes.\r\nIt took us thousands of dragging years to evolve the civilization of\r\n1910, and you show me a 1940 that seems thousands of years beyond that."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but what you call \'evolution\' was that of unaided nature. Social\r\nevolution is a distinct process. Below us, you see, all improvements had\r\nto be built into the stock--transmitted by heredity. The social organism\r\nis open to lateral transmission--what we used to call education. We\r\nnever understood it. We thought it was to supply certain piles of\r\ninformation, mostly useless; or to develop certain qualities."\r\n\r\n"And what do you think it is now?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"We know now that _the_ social process is to constantly improve and\r\ndevelop society. This has a necessary corollary of improvement in\r\nindividuals; but the thing that matters most is growth in the social\r\nspirit--and body."\r\n\r\n"You\'re beyond me now, Owen."\r\n\r\n"Yes; don\'t you notice that ever since you began to study our advance,\r\nwhat puzzles you most is not the visible details about you, but a\r\nchanged spirit in people? Thirty years ago, if you showed a man that\r\nsome one had dumped a ton of soot in his front yard he would have been\r\nfurious, and had the man arrested and punished. If you showed him that\r\nnumbers of men were dumping thousands of tons of soot all over his city\r\nevery year, he would have neither felt nor acted. It\'s the other way,\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"You speak as if man had really learned to \'love his neighbor as\r\nhimself,\'" I said sarcastically.\r\n\r\n"And why not? If you have a horse, on whose strength you absolutely\r\ndepend to make a necessary journey, you take good care of that horse and\r\ngrow fond of him. It dawned on us at last that life was not an\r\nindividual affair; that other people were essential to our happiness--to\r\nour very existence. We are not what they used to call \'altruistic\' in\r\nthis. We do not think of \'neighbors,\' \'brothers,\' \'others\' any more. It\r\nis all \'ourself.\'"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t follow you--sorry."\r\n\r\nOwen grinned at me amiably. "No matter, old chap, you can see results,\r\nand will have to take the reasons on trust. Now here\'s this particular\r\nriver with its natural beauties, and its unnatural defilements. We\r\nsimply stopped defiling it--and one season\'s rain did the rest."\r\n\r\n"Did the rains wash away the railroads?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no--they are there still. But the use of electric power has removed\r\nthe worst evils. There is no smoke, dust, cinders, and a yearly saving\r\nof millions in forest fires on the side! Also very little noise. Come\r\nand see the way it works now."\r\n\r\n"We ran in at Yonkers. I wouldn\'t have known the old town. It was as\r\nbeautiful as--Posilippo."\r\n\r\n"Where are the factories?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"There--and there--and there."\r\n\r\n"Why, those are palaces!"\r\n\r\n"Well? Why not? Why shouldn\'t people work in palaces? It doesn\'t cost\r\nany more to make a beautiful building than an ugly one. Remember, we are\r\nmuch richer, now--and have plenty of time, and the spirit of beauty is\r\nencouraged."\r\n\r\nI looked at the rows of quiet, stately buildings; wide windowed;\r\ngarden-roofed.\r\n\r\n"Electric power there too?" I suggested. Owen nodded again.\r\n"Everywhere," he said. "We store electricity all the time with\r\nwind-mills, water-mills, tide-mills, solar engines--even hand power."\r\n\r\n"What!"\r\n\r\n"I mean it," he said. "There are all kinds of storage batteries now.\r\nHuge ones for mills, little ones for houses; and there are ever so many\r\npeople whose work does not give them bodily exercise, and who do not\r\ncare much for games. So we have both hand and foot attachments; and a\r\nvigorous man, or woman--or child, for that matter, can work away for\r\nhalf an hour, and have the pleasant feeling that the power used will\r\nheat the house or run the motor.\r\n\r\n"Is that why I don\'t smell gasoline in the streets?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. We use all those sloppy, smelly things in special places--and\r\napply all the power by electric storage mostly. You saw the little\r\nbatteries in our boat."\r\n\r\nThen he showed me the railroad. There were six tracks, clean and\r\nshiny--thick turf between them.\r\n\r\n"The inside four are for the special trains--rapid transit and long\r\ndistance freight. The outside two are open to anyone."\r\n\r\nWe stopped long enough to see some trains go by; the express at an\r\nincredible speed, yet only buzzing softly; and the fast freight; cars\r\nseemingly of aluminum, like a string of silver beads.\r\n\r\n"We use aluminum for almost everything. You know it was only a question\r\nof power--the stuff is endless," Owen explained.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time, on the outside tracks, which had a side track at every\r\nstation, he told me, ran single coaches or short trains, both passenger\r\nand freight, at a comfortable speed.\r\n\r\n"All kinds of regular short-distance traffic runs this way. It\'s a great\r\nconvenience. But the regular highroads are the best. Have you noticed?"\r\n\r\nI had seen from the air-motor how broad and fine they looked, but told\r\nhim I had made no special study of them.\r\n\r\n"Come on--while we\'re about it," he said; and called a little car. We\r\nran up the hills to Old Broadway, and along its shaded reaches for quite\r\na distance. It was broad, indeed. The center track, smooth, firm, and\r\ndustless, was for swift traffic of any sort, and well used. As the\r\nfreight wagons were beautiful to look at and clean, they were not\r\nexcluded, and the perfect road was strong enough for any load. There\r\nwere rows of trees on either side, showing a good growth, though young\r\nyet; then a narrower roadway for slower vehicles, on either side a\r\nsecond row of trees, the footpaths, and the outside trees.\r\n\r\n"These are only about twenty-five years old. Don\'t you think they are\r\ndoing well?"\r\n\r\n"They are a credit to the National Bureau of Highways and Arboriculture\r\nthat I see you are going to tell me about."\r\n\r\n"You _are_ getting wise," Owen answered, with a smile. "Yes--that\'s what\r\ndoes it. And it furnishes employment, I can tell you. In the early\r\nmorning these roads are alive with caretakers. Of course the bulk of the\r\nwork is done by running machines; but there is a lot of pruning and\r\ntrimming and fighting with insects. Among our richest victories in that\r\nline is the extermination of the gipsy moth--brown tail--elm beetle and\r\nthe rest."\r\n\r\n"How on earth did you do that?"\r\n\r\n"Found the natural devourer--as we did with the scale pest. Also by\r\nraising birds instead of killing them; and by swift and thorough work in\r\nthe proper season. We gave our minds to it, you see, at last."\r\n\r\nThe outside path was a delightful one, wide, smooth, soft to the foot,\r\nagreeable in color.\r\n\r\n"What do you make your sidewalk of?" I asked.\r\n\r\nOwen tapped it with his foot. "It\'s a kind of semi-flexible\r\nconcrete--wears well, too. And we color it to suit ourselves, you see.\r\nThere was no real reason why a path should be ugly to look at."\r\n\r\nEvery now and then there were seats; also of concrete, beautifully\r\nshaped and too heavy to be easily moved. A narrow crack ran along the\r\nlowest curve.\r\n\r\n"That keeps \'em dry," said Owen.\r\n\r\nDrinking fountains bubbled invitingly up from graceful standing basins,\r\nwhere birds drank and dipped in the overflow.\r\n\r\n"Why, these are fruit trees," I said suddenly, looking along the outside\r\nrow.\r\n\r\n"Yes, nearly all of them, and the next row are mostly nut trees. You\r\nsee, the fruit trees are shorter and don\'t take the sun off. The middle\r\nones are elms wherever elms grow well. I tell you, John, it is the\r\nexperience of a lifetime to take a long motor trip over the roads of\r\nAmerica! You can pick your climate, or run with the season. Nellie and I\r\nstarted once from New Orleans in February--the violets out. We came\r\nnorth with them; I picked her a fresh bunch every day!"\r\n\r\nHe showed me the grape vines trained from tree to tree in Tuscan\r\nfashion; the lines of berry bushes, and the endless ribbon of perennial\r\nflowers that made the final border of the pathway. On its inner side\r\nwere beds of violets, lilies of the valley, and thick ferns; and around\r\neach fountain were groups of lilies and water-loving plants.\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it," I said. "I _simply don\'t believe it_! How could\r\nany nation afford to keep up such roads!"\r\n\r\nOwen drew me to a seat--we had dismounted to examine a fountain and see\r\nthe flowers. He produced pencil and paper.\r\n\r\n"I\'m no expert," he said. "I can\'t give you exact figures. But I want\r\nyou to remember that the trees pay. Pay! These roads, hundreds of\r\nthousands of miles of them, constitute quite a forest, and quite an\r\norchard. Nuts, as Hallie told you, are in growing use as food. We have\r\nalong these roads, as beautiful clean shade trees, the finest improved\r\nkinds of chestnut, walnut, butternut, pecan--whatever grows best in the\r\nlocality."\r\n\r\nAnd then he made a number of startling assertions and computations, and\r\nshowed me the profit per mile of two rows of well-kept nut trees.\r\n\r\n"I suppose Hallie has told you about tree farming?" he added.\r\n\r\n"She said something about it--but I didn\'t rightly know what she meant."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s a big thing; it has revolutionized agriculture. As you\'re\r\nsailing over the country now you don\'t see so many bald spots. A\r\nhealthy, permanent world has to keep its fur on."\r\n\r\nI was impressed by that casual remark, "As you\'re sailing over the\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Owen, I think I have the glimmer of an idea. Didn\'t the\r\ncommon use of airships help to develop this social consciousness you\'re\r\nalways talking about--this general view of things?"\r\n\r\nHe clapped me on the shoulder. "You\'re dead right, John--it did, and I\r\ndon\'t believe any of us would have thought to mention it." He looked at\r\nme admiringly. "Behold the power of a naturally strong mind--in spite of\r\ncircumstances! Yes, really that\'s a fact. You see few people are able to\r\nvisualize what they have not seen. Most of us had no more idea of the\r\nsurface of the earth than an ant has of a meadow. In each mind was only\r\na thready fragment of an idea of the world--no real geographic view. And\r\nwhen we got flying all over it commonly, it became real and familiar to\r\nus--like a big garden.\r\n\r\n"I guess that helped on the tree idea. You see, in our earlier kind of\r\nagriculture the first thing we did was to cut down the forest, dig up\r\nand burn over, plow, harrow, and brush fine--to plant our little\r\ngrasses. All that dry, soft, naked soil was helplessly exposed to the\r\nrain--and the rain washed it steadily away. In one heavy storm soil that\r\nit had taken centuries of forest growth to make would be carried off to\r\nclog the rivers and harbors. This struck us all at once as wasteful. We\r\nbegan to realize that food could grow on trees as well as grasses; that\r\nthe cubic space occupied by a chestnut tree could produce more bushels\r\nof nutriment than the linear space below it. Of course we have our wheat\r\nfields yet, but around every exposed flat acreage is a broad belt of\r\nturf and trees; every river and brook is broadly bordered with turf and\r\ntrees, or shrubs. We have stopped soil waste to a very great extent.\r\nAlso we make soil--but that is a different matter."\r\n\r\n"Hurrying Mother Nature again, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the advance in scientific agriculture is steady. Don\'t you\r\nremember that German professor who raised all kinds of things in water?\r\nJust fed them a pinch of chemicals now and then? They said he had a row\r\nof trees before his door with their roots in barrels of water--the third\r\ngeneration that had never touched ground. We kept on studying, and began\r\nto learn how to put together the proper kind of soil for different kinds\r\nof plants. Rock-crushers furnished the basis, then add the preferred\r\nconstituents and sell, by the bag or the ship load. You can have a\r\nradish bed in a box on your window sill, if you like radishes, that will\r\nraise you the fattest, sweetest, juiciest, crispiest, tenderest little\r\npink beauties you ever saw--all the year round. No weed seeds in that\r\nsoil, either."\r\n\r\nWe rolled slowly back in the green shade. There was plenty of traffic,\r\nbut all quiet, orderly, and comfortable. The people were a constant\r\nsurprise to me. They were certainly better looking, even the poorest.\r\nAnd on the faces of the newest immigrants there was an expression of\r\nblazing hope that was almost better than the cheery peacefulness of the\r\nnative born.\r\n\r\nWherever I saw workmen, they worked swiftly, with eager interest.\r\nNowhere did I see the sagging slouch, the slow drag of foot and dull\r\nswing of arm which I had always associated with day laborers. We saw men\r\nworking in the fields--and women, too; but I had learned not to lay my\r\nneck on the block too frequently. I knew that my protest would only\r\nbring out explanations of the advantage of field work over house\r\nwork--and that women were as strong as men--or thereabouts. But I was\r\nsurprised at their eagerness.\r\n\r\n"They look as busy as a lot of ants on an ant heap," I said.\r\n\r\n"It\'s their heap, you see," Owen answered. "And they are not tired--that\r\nmakes a great difference."\r\n\r\n"They seem phenomenally well dressed--looks like a scene in an opera.\r\nSort of agricultural uniform?"\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Owen was always asking me "why not"--and there wasn\'t any\r\nanswer to it. "We used to have hunting suits and fishing suits and\r\nplumbing suits, and so on. It isn\'t really a uniform, just the natural\r\nworking out of the best appointed dress for the trade."\r\n\r\nAgain I held my tongue; not asking how they could afford it, but\r\nremembering the shorter hours, the larger incomes, the more universal\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nWe got back to Yonkers, put up the car--these things could be hired, I\r\nfound, for twenty-five cents an hour--and had lunch in a little eating\r\nplace which bore out Hallie\'s statement as to the high standard of food\r\neverywhere. Our meal was twenty-five cents for each of us. I saw Owen\r\nsmile at me, but I refused to be surprised. We settled down in our boat\r\nagain, and pushed smoothly up the river.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d get one thing clear in my mind," I said at last. "Just how\r\ndid you tackle the liquor question. I haven\'t seen a saloon--or a\r\ndrunken man. Nellie said something about people\'s not wanting to drink\r\nany more--but there were several millions who did want to, thirty years\r\nago, and plenty of people who wanted them to. What were your steps?"\r\n\r\n"The first step was to eliminate the self-interest of the dealer--the\r\nbig business pressure that had to make drunkards. That was done in state\r\nafter state, within a few years, by introducing government ownership and\r\nmanagement. With that went an absolute government guarantee of purity.\r\nIn five or six years there was no bad liquor sold, and no public\r\ndrinking places except government ones.\r\n\r\n"But that wasn\'t enough--not by a long way. It wasn\'t the love of liquor\r\nthat supported the public house--it was the need of the public house\r\nitself."\r\n\r\nI stared rather uncertainly.\r\n\r\n"The meeting place," he went on. "Men have to get together. We have had\r\npublic houses as long as we have had private ones, almost. It is a\r\nsocial need."\r\n\r\n"A social need with a pretty bad result, it seems to me," I said.\r\n"Taking men away from their families, leading to all manner of vicious\r\nindulgence."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they used to; but that was because only men used them. I said a\r\nsocial need, not a masculine one. We have met it in this way. Whenever\r\nwe build private houses--if it is the lowest country unit, or the\r\nhighest city block, we build accommodations for living together.\r\n\r\n"Every little village has its Town House, with club rooms of all sorts;\r\nthe people flock together freely, for games, for talk, for lectures, and\r\nplays, and dances, and sermons--it is universal. And in the city--you\r\ndon\'t see a saloon on every corner, but you do see almost as many places\r\nwhere you can \'meet a man\' and talk with him on equal ground."\r\n\r\n"Meet a woman, too?" I suggested.\r\n\r\n"Yes; especially, yes. People can meet, as individuals or in groups,\r\nfreely and frequently, in city or country. But men can not flock by\r\nthemselves in special places provided for their special vices--without\r\ntaking a great deal of extra trouble."\r\n\r\n"I should think they would take the trouble, then," said I.\r\n\r\n"But why? When there is every arrangement made for a natural good time;\r\nwhen you are not overworked, not underfed, not miserable and hopeless.\r\nWhen you can drop into a comfortable chair and have excellent food and\r\ndrink in pleasant company; and hear good music, or speaking, or reading,\r\nor see pictures; or, if you like, play any kind of game; swim, ride,\r\nfly, do what you want to, for change and recreation--why long for liquor\r\nin a low place?"\r\n\r\n"But the men--the real men, people as they were," I insisted. "You had a\r\nworld full of drinking men who liked the saloon; did you--what do you\r\ncall it?--eliminate them?"\r\n\r\n"A few of them, yes," he replied gravely! "Some preferred it; others,\r\nthorough-going dipsomaniacs, we gave hospital treatment and permanent\r\nrestraint; they lived and worked and were well provided for in places\r\nwhere there was no liquor. But there were not many of that kind. Most\r\nmen drank under a constant pressure of conditions driving them to it,\r\nand the mere force of habit.\r\n\r\n"Just remember that the weight and terror of life is lifted off us--for\r\ngood and all."\r\n\r\n"Socialism, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, real socialism. The wealth and power of all of us belongs to all\r\nof us now. The Wolf is dead."\r\n\r\n"Other things besides poverty drove a man to drink in my time," I\r\nventured.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--and some men continued to drink. I told you there was liquor\r\nto be had--good liquor, too. And other drug habits held on for a while.\r\nBut we stopped the source of the trouble. The old men died off, the\r\nyounger ones got over it, and the new ones--that\'s what you don\'t\r\nrealize yet: We make a new kind of people now."\r\n\r\nHe was silent, his strong mouth set in a kind smile, his eyes looking\r\nfar up the blue river.\r\n\r\n"Well, what comes next? What\'s done it?" I demanded. "Religion,\r\neducation, or those everlasting women?"\r\n\r\nHe laughed outright; laughed till the boat rocked.\r\n\r\n"How you do hate to admit that it\'s their turn. John! Haven\'t we had\r\nfull swing--everything in our hands--for all historic time? They have\r\nonly begun. Thirty years? Why, John, they have done so much in these\r\nthirty years that the world\'s heart is glad at last. You don\'t know----"\r\n\r\nI didn\'t know. But I did feel a distinct resentment at being treated\r\nlike an extinct species.\r\n\r\n"They have simply stepped on to an eminence men have been all these\r\nyears building," I said. "We have done all the hard work--are doing it\r\nyet, for all I see. We have made it possible for them to live at all! We\r\nhave made the whole civilization of the world--they just profit by it.\r\nAnd now you speak as if, somehow, they had managed to achieve more than\r\nwe have!"\r\n\r\nOwen considered a while thoughtfully. "What you say is true. We have\r\ndone a good deal of the work; we did largely make and modify our\r\ncivilization. But if you read some of the newer histories----" he\r\nstopped and looked at me as if I had just happened. "Why you don\'t know\r\nyet, do you? History has been rewritten."\r\n\r\n"You speak as if \'history\' was a one act play."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean it\'s all done, of course--but we do have now a complete\r\nnew treatment of the world\'s history. Each nation its own, some several\r\nof them, there\'s no dead level of agreement, I assure you. But our old\r\nandrocentric version of life began to be questioned about 1910, I\r\nthink--and new versions appeared, more and more of them. The big\r\nscholars took it up, there was new research work, and now we are not so\r\nglib in our assurance that we did it all."\r\n\r\n"You\'re getting pretty close to things I used to know something about,"\r\nI remarked drily.\r\n\r\n"If you knew all that was known, then, you wouldn\'t know this, John.\r\nDon\'t you remember what Lester Ward calls \'the illusion of the\r\nnear\'--how the most familiar facts were precisely those we often failed\r\nto understand? In all our history, ancient and modern, we had the\r\nunderlying assumption that men were the human race, the people who did\r\nthings; and that women--were \'their women.\'"\r\n\r\n"And precisely what have you lately discovered? That Horatio at the\r\nbridge was Horatio, after all? That the world was conquered by an\r\nAlexandra--and a Napoleona?" I laughed with some bitterness.\r\n\r\n"No," said Owen gently, "There is no question about the battles--men did\r\nthe fighting, of course. But we have learned that \'the decisive battles\r\nof history\' were not so decisive as we thought them. Man, as a\r\ndestructive agent did modify history, unquestionably. What did make\r\nhistory, make civilization, was constructive industry. And for many ages\r\nwomen did most of that."\r\n\r\n"Did women build the Pyramids? the Acropolis? the Roads of Rome?"\r\n\r\n"No, nor many other things. But they gave the world its first start in\r\nagriculture and the care of animals; they clothed it and fed it and\r\nornamented it and kept it warm; their ceaseless industry made rich the\r\nsimple early cultures. Consider--without men, Egypt and Assyria could\r\nnot have fought--but they could have grown rich and wise. Without\r\nwomen--they could have fought until the last man died alone--if the food\r\nheld out.\r\n\r\n"But I won\'t bother you with this, John. You\'ll get all you want out of\r\nbooks better than I can give it. What I set out to say was that the most\r\nimportant influence in weeding out intemperance was that of the women."\r\n\r\nI was in a very bad temper by this time, it was disagreeable enough to\r\nhave this--or any other part of it, true; but what I could not stand was\r\nto see that big hearted man speak of it in such a cheerful\r\nmatter-of-fact way.\r\n\r\n"Have the men of to-day no pride?" I asked. "How can you stand it--being\r\ntreated as inferiors--by women?"\r\n\r\n"Women stood it for ten thousand years," he answered, "being treated as\r\ninferiors--by men."\r\n\r\nWe went home in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nI learned to understand the immense material prosperity of the country\r\nmuch more easily than its social progress.\r\n\r\nThe exquisite agriculture which made millions of acres from raw farms\r\nand ranches into rich gardens, the forestry which had changed our\r\nstraggling woodlands into great tree-farms, yielding their steady crops\r\nof cut boughs, thinned underbrush, and full-grown trunks, those endless\r\norchard roads, with their processions of workers making continual\r\nexcursions in their special cars, keeping roadway and bordering trees in\r\nperfect order--all this one could see.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course far more of the wilder, narrower roads, perfect as\r\nthe roadbed, but not parked, with all untrimmed nature to travel\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nThe airships did make a difference. To look down on the flowing,\r\noutspread miles beneath gave a sense of the unity and continuous beauty\r\nof our country, quite different from the streak views we used to get. An\r\nairship is a moving mountain-top.\r\n\r\nThe cities were even more strikingly beautiful, in that the change was\r\ngreater, the contrast sharper. I never tired of wandering about on foot\r\nalong the streets of cities, and I visited several, finding, as Nellie\r\nsaid, that it took no longer to improve twenty than one; the people in\r\neach could do it as soon as they chose to.\r\n\r\nBut what made them choose? What had got into the people? That was what\r\npuzzled me most. It did not show outside, like the country changes, and\r\nthe rebuilt cities; the people did not look remarkable, though they were\r\ndifferent, too. I watched and studied them, trying to analyze the\r\nchanges that could be seen. Most visible was cleanliness, comfort, and\r\nbeauty in dress.\r\n\r\nI had never dreamed of the relief to the spectator in not seeing any\r\npoverty. We were used to it, of course; we had our excuses, religious\r\nand economic, we even found, or thought we found, artistic pleasure in\r\nthis social disease. But now I realized what a nightmare it had\r\nbeen--the sights, the sounds, the smells of poverty--merely to an\r\noutside observer.\r\n\r\nThese people had good bodies, too. They were not equally beautiful, by\r\nany means; thirty years, of course, could not wholly return to the\r\nnormal a race long stunted and overworked. But in the difference in the\r\nyoung generation I could see at a glance the world\'s best hope, that the\r\n"long inheritance" is far deeper than the short.\r\n\r\nThose of about twenty and under, those who were born after some of these\r\nchanges had been made, were like another race. Big, sturdy, blooming\r\ncreatures, boys and girls alike, swift and graceful, eager, happy,\r\ncourteous--I supposed at first that these were the children of\r\nexceptionally placed people; but soon found, with a heart-stirring sort\r\nof shock, that all the children were like that.\r\n\r\nSome of the old folk still carried the scars of earlier conditions, but\r\nthe children were new people.\r\n\r\nThen of my own accord I demanded reasons. Nellie laughed sweetly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad you\'ve come to your appetite," she said. "I\'ve been longing\r\nto talk to you about that, and you were always bored."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good deal of a dose, Nell; you\'ll admit that. And one hates to\r\nbe forcibly fed. But now I do want to get an outline, a sort of general\r\nidea, of what you do with children. Can you condense a little recent\r\nhistory, and make it easy to an aged stranger?"\r\n\r\n"Aged! You are growing younger every day, John. I believe that\r\ncomparatively brainless life you led in Tibet was good for you. That was\r\nall new impression on the brain; the first part rested. Now you are\r\nbeginning where you left off. I wish you would recognize that."\r\n\r\nI shook my head. "Never mind me, I\'m trying not to think of my\r\nchopped-off life; but tell me how you manufacture this kind of people."\r\n\r\nMy sister sat still, thinking, for a little. "I want to avoid repetition\r\nif possible--tell me just how much you have in mind already." But I\r\nrefused to be catechised.\r\n\r\n"You put it all together, straight; I want to get the whole of it--as\r\nwell as I can."\r\n\r\n"All right. On your head be it. Let me see--first---- Oh, there isn\'t\r\nany first, John! We were doing ever so much for children before you\r\nleft--before you and I were born! It is the vision of all the great\r\nchild-lovers; that children are people, and the most valuable people on\r\nearth. The most important thing to a child is its mother. We made new\r\nmothers for them--I guess that is \'first.\'\r\n\r\n"Suppose we begin this way:\r\n\r\n"a. Free, healthy, independent, intelligent mothers.\r\n\r\n"b. Enough to live on--right conditions for child-raising.\r\n\r\n"c. Specialized care.\r\n\r\n"d. The new social consciousness, with its religion, its art, its\r\nscience, its civics, its industry, its wealth, its brilliant efficiency.\r\nThat\'s your outline."\r\n\r\nI set down these points in my notebook.\r\n\r\n"An excellent outline, Nellie. Now for details on \'a.\' I will set my\r\nteeth till that\'s over."\r\n\r\nMy sister regarded me with amused tenderness. "How you do hate the new\r\nwomen, John--in the abstract! I haven\'t seen you averse to any of them\r\nin the concrete!"\r\n\r\nAt the time I refused to admit any importance to this remark, but I\r\nthought it over later--and to good purpose. It was true. I did hate the\r\nnew kind of human being who loomed so large in every line of progress.\r\nShe jarred on every age--old masculine prejudice--she was not what woman\r\nused to be. And yet--as Nellie said--the women I met I liked.\r\n\r\n"Get on with the lesson, my dear," said I. "I am determined to learn and\r\nnot to argue. What did your omnipresent new woman do to improve the\r\nhuman stock so fast?"\r\n\r\nThen Nellie settled down in earnest and gave me all I wanted--possibly\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n"They wakened as if to a new idea, to their own natural duty as mothers;\r\nto the need of a high personal standard of health and character in both\r\nparents. That gave us a better start right away--clean-born, vigorous\r\nchildren, inheriting strength and purity.\r\n\r\n"Then came the change in conditions, a change so great you\'ve hardly\r\nglimpsed it yet. No more, never more again, please God, that brutal\r\nhunger and uncertainty, that black devil of want and fear.\r\nEverybody--everybody--sure of decent living! That one thing lifted the\r\nheaviest single shadow from the world, and from the children.\r\n\r\n"Nobody is overworked now. Nobody is tired, unless they tire themselves\r\nunnecessarily. People live sanely, safely, easily. The difference to\r\nchildren, both in nature and nurture, is very great. They all have\r\nproper nourishment, and clothing, and environment--from birth.\r\n\r\n"And with that, as advance in special conditions for child-culture, we\r\nbuild for babies now. We, as a community, provide suitably for our most\r\nimportant citizens."\r\n\r\nAt this point I opened my mouth to say something, but presently shut it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Good boy!" said Nellie. "I\'ll show you later."\r\n\r\n"The next is specialized care. That one thing is enough, almost, to\r\naccount for it all. To think of all the ages when our poor babies had no\r\nbenefit at all of the advance in human intelligence!\r\n\r\n"We had the best and wisest specialists we could train and hire in every\r\nother field of life--and the babies left utterly at the mercy of\r\namateurs!\r\n\r\n"Well, I mustn\'t stop to rage at past history. We do better now. John,\r\nguess the salary of the head of the Baby Gardens in a city."\r\n\r\n"Oh, call it a million, and go on," I said cheerfully; which somewhat\r\ndisconcerted her.\r\n\r\n"It\'s as big a place as being head of Harvard College," she said, "and\r\nbetter paid than that used to be. Our highest and finest people study\r\nfor this work. Real geniuses, some of them. The babies, all the babies,\r\nmind you, get the benefit of the best wisdom we have. And it grows fast.\r\nWe are learning by doing it. Every year we do better. \'Growing up\' is an\r\neasier process than it used to be."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have to accept it for the sake of argument," I agreed. "It\'s the\r\nlast point I care most for, I think. All these new consciousnesses you\r\nwere so glib about. I guess you can\'t describe that so easily."\r\n\r\nShe grew thoughtful, rocking to and fro for a few moments.\r\n\r\n"No," she said at length, "it\'s not so easy. But I\'ll try. I wasn\'t very\r\nglib, really. I spoke of religion, art, civics, science, industry,\r\nwealth, and efficiency, didn\'t I? Now let\'s see how they apply to the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n"This religion---- Dear me, John! am I to explain the greatest sunburst\r\nof truth that ever was--in two minutes?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," I said loftily. "I\'ll give you five! You\'ve got to try,\r\nanyway."\r\n\r\nSo she tried.\r\n\r\n"In place of Revelation and Belief," she said slowly, "we now have Facts\r\nand Knowledge. We used to believe in God--variously, and teach the\r\nbelief as a matter of duty. Now we know God, as much as we know anything\r\nelse--more than we know anything else--it is The Fact of Life.\r\n\r\n"This is the base of knowledge, underlying all other knowledge, simple\r\nand safe and sure--and we can teach it to children! The child mind,\r\nopening to this lovely world, is no longer filled with horrible or\r\nridiculous old ideas--it learns to know the lovely truth of life."\r\n\r\nShe looked so serenely beautiful, and sat so still after she said this,\r\nthat I felt a little awkward.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to jar on you, Nellie," I said. "I didn\'t know you were\r\nso--religious."\r\n\r\nThen she laughed again merrily. "I\'m not," she said. "No more than\r\nanybody is. We don\'t have \'religious\' people any more, John. It\'s not a\r\nseparate thing; a \'body of doctrine\' and set of observances--it is what\r\nall of us have at the bottom of everything else, the underlying basic\r\nfact of life. And it goes far, very far indeed, to make the strong good\r\ncheer you see in these children\'s faces.\r\n\r\n"They have never been frightened, John. They have never been told any of\r\nthose awful things we used to tell them. There is no struggle with\r\nchurch-going, no gagging over doctrines, no mysterious queer mess--only\r\nlife. Life is now open to our children, clear, brilliant, satisfying,\r\nand yet stimulating.\r\n\r\n"Of course, I don\'t mean that this applies equally to every last one.\r\nThe material benefit does, that could be enforced by law where\r\nnecessary; but this world-wave of new knowledge is irregular, of course.\r\nIt has spread wider, and gone faster than any of the old religions ever\r\ndid, but you can find people yet who believe things almost as dreadful\r\nas father did!"\r\n\r\nI well remembered my father\'s lingering Calvinism, and appreciated its\r\nhorrors.\r\n\r\n"Our educators have recognized a new duty to children," Nellie went on;\r\n"to stand between them and the past. We recognize that the child mind\r\nshould lift and lead the world; and we feed it with our newest, not our\r\noldest ideas.\r\n\r\n"Also we encourage it to wander on ahead, fearless and happy. I began to\r\ntell you the other day--and you snubbed me, John, you did really!--that\r\nwe have a new literature for children, and have dropped the old."\r\n\r\nAt this piece of information I could no longer preserve the attitude of\r\na patient listener. I sat back and stared at my sister, while the full\r\nawfulness of this condition slowly rolled over me.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean," I said slowly, "that children are taught nothing of the\r\npast?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, indeed; they are taught about the past from the earth\'s\r\nbeginning. In the mind of every child is a clear view of how Life has\r\ngrown on earth."\r\n\r\n"And our own history?"\r\n\r\n"Of course; from savagery to to-day--that is a simple story, endlessly\r\ninteresting as they grow older."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, then, by cutting off the past?"\r\n\r\n"I mean that their stories, poems, pictures, and the major part of their\r\ninstruction deals with the present and future--especially the future.\r\nThe whole teaching is dynamic--not static. We used to teach mostly\r\nfacts, or what we thought were facts. Now we teach processes. You\'ll\r\nfind out if you talk to children, anywhere."\r\n\r\nThis I mentally determined to do, and in due course did. I may as well\r\nsay right here that I found children more delightful companions than\r\nthey used to be. They were polite enough, even considerate; but so\r\nuniversally happy, so overflowing with purposes, so skilful in so many\r\nways, so intelligent and efficient, that it astonished me. We used to\r\nhave a sort of race-myth about "happy childhood," but none of us seemed\r\nto study the faces of the children we saw about us. Even among\r\nwell-to-do families, the discontented, careworn, anxious, repressed, or\r\nrebellious faces of children ought to have routed our myth forever.\r\n\r\nTimid, brow-beaten children, sulky children, darkly resentful; nervous,\r\nwhining children, foolish, mischievous, hysterically giggling children,\r\nnoisy, destructive, uneasy children--how well I remembered them.\r\n\r\nThese new ones had a strange air of being Persons, not subordinates and\r\ndependents, but Equals; their limitations frankly admitted, but not cast\r\nup at them, and their special powers fully respected. That was it!\r\n\r\nI am wandering far ahead of that day\'s conversation, but it led to wide\r\nstudy among children, analysis, and some interesting conclusions. When I\r\nhit on this one I began to understand. Children were universally\r\nrespected, and they liked it. In city or country, place was made for\r\nthem, permanent, pleasant, properly appointed place; to use, enjoy, and\r\ngrow up in. They had their homes and families as before, losing nothing;\r\nbut they added to this background their own wide gardens and houses,\r\nwhere part of each day was spent.\r\n\r\nFrom earliest infancy they absorbed the idea that home was a place to\r\ncome out from and go back to; the sweetest, dearest place--for there was\r\nmother, and father, and one\'s own little room to sleep in; but the day\r\nhours were to go somewhere to learn and do, to work and play, to grow\r\nin.\r\n\r\nI branched off from Nellie\'s startling me with her\r\n"new-literature-for-children" idea. She went on to explain it further.\r\n\r\n"The greatest artists work for children now, John," she said. "In the\r\nchild-gardens and child-homes they are surrounded with beauty. I do not\r\nmean that we hire painters and poets to manufacture beauty for them; but\r\nthat painters and poets, architects and landscape artists, designers and\r\ndecorators of all kinds, love and revere childhood, and delight to work\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n"Remember that half of our artists are mothers now--a loving, serving,\r\ngiving spirit has come into expression--a wider and more lasting\r\nexpression than it was ever possible to put into doughnuts and\r\nembroidery! Wait till you see the beauty of our child-gardens!"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you call them schools? Don\'t you have schools?"\r\n\r\n"Some. We haven\'t wholly outgrown the old academic habit. But for the\r\nbabies there was no precedent, and they do not \'go to school.\'"\r\n\r\n"You have a sort of central nursery?" I ventured.\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily \'central,\' John. And we have great numbers of them. How\r\ncan I make it any way clear to you? See here. Suppose you were a mother,\r\nand a very busy one, like the old woman in the shoe; and suppose you had\r\ntwenty or thirty permanent babies to be provided for? And suppose you\r\nwere wise and rich--able to do what you wanted to? Wouldn\'t you build an\r\nelaborate nursery for those children? Wouldn\'t you engage the very best\r\nnurses and teachers? Wouldn\'t you want the cleanest, quietest garden for\r\nthem to play or sleep in? Of course you would.\r\n\r\n"That is our attitude. We have at last recognized babies as a permanent\r\nclass. They are always here, about a fifth of the population. And we,\r\ntheir mothers, have at last ensured to these, our babies, the best\r\naccommodation known to our time. It improves as we learn, of course."\r\n\r\n"Mm!" I said. "I\'ll go and gaze upon these Infant Paradises later--at\r\nthe sleeping hour, please! But how about that new literature you\r\nfrightened me with?"\r\n\r\n"Oh. Why, we have tried to treat their minds as we do their\r\nstomachs--putting in only what is good for then. I mean the very\r\nlittlest, understand. As they grow older they have wider range; we have\r\nnot expunged the world\'s past, my dear brother! But we do prepare with\r\nall the wisdom, love, and power we have, the mental food for little\r\nchildren. Simple, lovely music is about them always--you must have\r\nnoticed how universally they sing?"\r\n\r\nI had, and said so.\r\n\r\n"The coloring and decoration of their rooms is beautiful--their clothes\r\nare beautiful--and simple--you\'ve seen that, too?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear girl. It\'s because I\'ve seen--and heard--and noticed the\r\nsurprisingness of the New Child that I sit here fairly guzzling\r\ninformation. Pray proceed to the literature!"\r\n\r\n"Literature is the most useful of the arts--the most perfect medium for\r\ntransfer of ideas. We wish to have the first impressions in our\r\nchildren\'s minds, above all things, true. All the witchery and\r\nloveliness possible in presentation--but the things presented are not\r\nsenseless and unpleasant.\r\n\r\n"We have plenty of \'true stories,\' stories based on real events and on\r\nnatural laws and processes; but the viewpoint from which they are\r\nwritten has changed; you\'ll have to read some to see what I mean. But\r\nthe major difference is in our stories of the future, our future here on\r\nearth. They are good stories, mind, the very best writers make them;\r\ngood verses and pictures, too. And a diet like that, while it is just as\r\nvaried and entertaining as the \'once upon a time\' kind, leaves the child\r\nwith a sense that things are going to happen--and he, or she, can help.\r\n\r\n"You see, we don\'t consider anything as done. To you, as a new visitor,\r\nwe \'point with pride,\' but among ourselves we \'view with alarm.\' We are\r\njust as full of Reformers and Propagandists as ever, and overflowing\r\nwith plans for improvement.\r\n\r\n"These are the main characteristics of the new child literature: Truth\r\nand Something Better Ahead."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it!" I said firmly. "No wonder you dodged about so long.\r\nYou\'ve apparently made a sort of pap out of Grad-grind and Rollo, and\r\nfeed it to these poor babies through a tube!"\r\n\r\nThis time my sister rebelled. She came firmly to my side and pulled my\r\nhair--precisely as she used to do forty years ago and more--the few\r\nlittle hairs at the crown which still troubled me in brushing--because\r\nof being pulled out straight so often.\r\n\r\n"You shall have no more oral instruction, young man," said she. "You\r\nshall be taken about and shown things; you shall \'Stop! Look! Listen!\'\r\nuntil you admit the advantages I have striven in vain to pump into your\r\nresisting intellect--you Product of Past Methods!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re the product of the same methods yourself, my dear," I replied\r\namiably; "but I\'m quite willing to be shown--always was something of a\r\nMissourian."\r\n\r\nNo part of my re-education was pleasanter, and I\'m sure none was more\r\nimportant, than the next few days. We visited place after place, in\r\ndifferent cities, or in the country, and everywhere was the same high\r\nstandard of health and beauty, of comfort, fun, and visible growth.\r\n\r\nI saw babies and wee toddlers by the thousands, and hardly ever heard\r\none cry! Out of that mass of experience some vivid pictures remain in my\r\nmind. One was "mother time" in a manufacturing village. There was a big\r\ngroup of mills with waterpower; each mill a beautiful, clean place,\r\nlight, airy, rich in color, sweet with the flowers about it, where men\r\nand women worked their two-hour shifts.\r\n\r\nThe women took off their work-aprons and slipped into the neighboring\r\ngarden to nurse their babies. They were in no haste. They were\r\npleasantly dressed and well-fed and not tired.\r\n\r\nThey were known and welcomed by the women in charge of the child-garden;\r\nand each mother slipped into a comfortable rocker and took into her arms\r\nthat little rosy piece of herself and the man she loved--it was a thing\r\nto bring one\'s heart into one\'s throat. The clean peace and quiet of it,\r\ntime enough, the pleasant neighborliness, the atmosphere of contented\r\nmotherhood, those healthy, drowsy little mites, so busy with their\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nThen they put them down, asleep for the most part, kissed them, and\r\nstrolled back to the pleasant workroom for another two hours.\r\n\r\nSpecialization used to be a terror, when a whole human being was held\r\ndown to one motion for ten hours. But specialization hurts nobody when\r\nit does not last too long.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoons some mothers took their babies home at once. Some\r\nnursed them and then went out together for exercise or pleasure. The\r\nhomes were clean and quiet, too; no kitchen work, no laundry work, no\r\nself-made clutter and dirt. It looked so comfortable that I couldn\'t\r\nbelieve my eyes, yet it was just common, everyday life.\r\n\r\nAs the babies grew old enough to move about, their joys widened. They\r\nwere kept in rooms of a suitable temperature, and wore practically no\r\nclothes. This in itself I was told was one main cause of their health\r\nand contentment. They rolled and tumbled on smooth mattresses; pulled\r\nthemselves up and swung back and forth on large, soft horizontal ropes\r\nfastened within reach; delightful little bunches of rose leaves and\r\ndimples, in perfect happiness.\r\n\r\nVery early they had water to play in; clean, shallow pools, kept at a\r\nproper temperature, where they splashed and gurgled in rapture, and\r\nlearned to swim before they learned to walk, sometimes.\r\n\r\nAs they grew larger and more competent, their playgrounds were more\r\nextensive and varied; but the underlying idea was always clear--safety\r\nand pleasure, full exercise and development of every power. There was no\r\nquarrelling over toys--whatever they had to play with they all had in\r\nabundance; and most of the time they did not have exchangeable objects,\r\nbut these ropes, pools, sand, clay, and so on, materials common to all;\r\nand the main joy was in the use of their own little bodies, is as many\r\nways as was possible.\r\n\r\nAt any time when they were not asleep a procession of crowing toddlers\r\ncould be seen creeping up a slight incline and sliding or rolling\r\ntriumphantly down the other side. A sort of beautified cellar door,\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nStrange that we always punished children for sliding down unsuitable\r\nthings and never provided suitable ones. But then, of course, one could\r\nnot have machinery like this in one brief family. Swings, see-saws, all\r\nmanner of moving things they had, with building-blocks, of course, and\r\nballs. But as soon as it was easy to them they had tools and learned to\r\nuse them; the major joy of their expanding lives was doing things. I\r\nspeak of them in an unbroken line, for that was the way they lived. Each\r\nstage lapped over into the next, and that natural ambition to be with\r\nthe older ones and do what they did was the main incentive in their\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nTo go on, to get farther, higher, to do something better and more\r\ninteresting, this was in the atmosphere; growth, exercise, and joy.\r\n\r\nI watched and studied, and grew happy as I did so; which I could see was\r\na gratification to Nellie.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t they ever naughty?" I demanded one day.\r\n\r\n"Why should they be?" she answered. "How could they be? What we used to\r\ncall \'naughtiness\' was only the misfit. The poor little things were in\r\nthe wrong place--and nobody knew how to make them happy. Here there is\r\nnothing they can hurt, and nothing that can hurt them. They have earth,\r\nair, fire, and water to play with."\r\n\r\n"Fire?" I interrupted.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. All children love fire, of course. As soon as they can\r\nmove about they are taught fire."\r\n\r\n"How many burn themselves up?"\r\n\r\n"None. Never any more. Did you never hear \'a burnt child dreads the\r\nfire\'? We said that, but we never had sense enough to use it. No proverb\r\never said \'a whipped child dreads the fire\'! We never safeguarded them,\r\nand the poor little things were always getting burned to death in our\r\nbarbarous \'homes\'!"\r\n\r\n"Do you arbitrarily burn them all?" I asked. "Have an annual\r\n\'branding\'?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; but we allow them to burn themselves--within reason. Come and\r\nsee."\r\n\r\nShe showed me a set of youngsters learning Heat and Cold, with basins of\r\nwater, a row of them; eagerly experimenting with cautious little\r\nfingers--very cold, cold, cool, tepid, warm, hot, very hot. They could\r\nhardly say the words plain, but learned them all, even when they all had\r\nto shut their eyes and the basins were changed about.\r\n\r\nStraying from house to house, from garden to garden, I watched them grow\r\nand learn. On the long walls about them were painted an endless panorama\r\nof human progress. When they noticed and asked questions they were told,\r\nwithout emphasis, that people used to live that wave; and grew to\r\nthis--and this.\r\n\r\nI found that as the children grew older they all had a year of travel;\r\neach human being knew his world. And when I questioned as to expense, as\r\nI always did, Nellie would flatten me with things like this:\r\n\r\n"Remember that we used to spend 70 per cent, of our national income on\r\nthe expenses of war, past and present. If we women had done no more than\r\nsave that, it would have paid for all you see."\r\n\r\nOr she would remind me again of the immense sums we used to spend on\r\nhospitals and prisons; or refer to the general change in economics, that\r\ninevitable socialization of industry, which had checked waste and\r\nincreased productivity so much.\r\n\r\n"We are a rich people, John," she repeated. "So are other nations, for\r\nthat matter; the world\'s richer. We have increased our output and\r\nlowered our expenses at the same time. One of our big present problems\r\nis what to do with our big surplus; we quarrel roundly over that. But\r\nmeanwhile it is a very poor nation indeed that does not provide full\r\neducation for its children."\r\n\r\nI found that the differences in education were both subtle and profound.\r\nThe babies\' experience of group life, as well as the daily return to\r\nfamily life, gave a sure groundwork for the understanding of civics.\r\nTheir first impressions included other babies; no child grew up with the\r\nintensified self-consciousness we used to almost force upon them.\r\n\r\nIn all the early years learning was ceaseless and unconscious. They grew\r\namong such carefully chosen surroundings as made it impossible not to\r\nlearn what was really necessary; and to learn it as squirrels learn the\r\ntrees--by playing and working in them. They learned the simple\r\nbeginnings of the world\'s great trades, led by natural interest and\r\ndesire, gathering by imitation and asked instruction.\r\n\r\nI saw nowhere the enforced task; everywhere the eager attention of real\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"Are they never taught to apply themselves? To concentrate?" I asked.\r\nAnd for answer she showed me the absorbed, breathless concentration of\r\nfresh young minds and busy hands.\r\n\r\n"But they soon tire of these things and want to do something else, do\r\nthey not?"\r\n\r\n"Of course. That is natural to childhood. And there is always something\r\nelse for them to do."\r\n\r\n"But they are only doing what they like to do--that is no preparation\r\nfor a life work surely."\r\n\r\n"We find it an excellent preparation for life work. You see, we all work\r\nat what we like now. That is one reason we do so much better work."\r\n\r\nI had talked on this line before with those who explained the workings\r\nof industrial socialism.\r\n\r\n"Still, as a matter of education," I urged, "is it not necessary for a\r\nchild to learn to compel himself to work?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," they told me; and, to say truth, convincingly showed me.\r\n"Children like to work. If any one does not, we know he is sick."\r\n\r\nAnd as I saw more and more of the child-gardens, and sat silently\r\nwatching for well-spent hours, I found how true this was.\r\n\r\nThe children had around them the carefully planned stimuli of a\r\ngenuinely educational environment. The work of the world was there, in\r\nwords of one syllable, as it were; and among wise, courteous, pleasant\r\npeople, themselves actually doing something, yet always ready to give\r\ninformation when asked.\r\n\r\nFirst the natural appetite of the young brain, then every imaginable\r\nconvenience for learning, then the cautiously used accessories to\r\nencourage further effort; and then these marvellous teachers--who seemed\r\nto like their work, too. The majority were women, and of them nearly all\r\nwere mothers. It appeared that children had not lost their mothers, as\r\nat first one assumed, but that each child kept his own and gained\r\nothers. And these teaching mothers were somehow more motherly than the\r\naverage.\r\n\r\nNellie was so pleased when I noticed this. She liked to see me "going to\r\nschool" so regularly. I was not alone in it, either. There seemed to be\r\nnumbers of people who cared enough for children to enjoy watching them\r\nand playing with them. Nobody was worn out with child care. The parents\r\nwere not--the nurses and teachers had short shifts--it seemed to be\r\nconsidered a pleasure and an honor to be allowed with the little ones.\r\n\r\nAnd in all this widespread, costly, elaborate, and yet perfectly simple\r\nand lovely environment, these little New Persons grew and blossomed with\r\nthat divine unconsciousness which belongs to children.\r\n\r\nThey did not know that the best intellects were devoted to their\r\nservice, they never dreamed what thought and love and labor made these\r\nwide gardens, these bright playing-places, these endlessly interesting\r\nshops where they could learn to make things as soon as they were old\r\nenough. They took it all as life--just Life, as a child must take his\r\nfirst environment.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you think, John," Nellie said, when I spoke of this, "don\'t\r\nyou really think this is a more normal environment for a young human\r\nsoul than a kitchen? Or a parlor? Or even a nursery?"\r\n\r\nI had to admit that it had its advantages.\r\n\r\nAs they grew older there was every chance for specialization. In the\r\nfirst years they gathered the rudiments of general knowledge, and of\r\ngeneral activity, of both hand and brain, and from infancy each child\r\nwas studied, and his growth--or hers--carefully recorded; not by\r\nadoring, intimately related love, but by that larger, wiser tenderness\r\nof these great child-lovers who had had hundreds of them to study.\r\n\r\nThey were observed intelligently. Notes were made, the mother and father\r\ncontributed theirs; in freedom and unconsciousness the young nature\r\ndeveloped, never realizing how its environment was altered to fit its\r\nspecial needs.\r\n\r\nAs the cool, spacious, flower-starred, fruitful forests of this time\r\ndiffered from the tangled underbrush, with crooked, crowded, imperfect\r\ntrees struggling for growth, that I remembered as "woods," or from\r\nclipped and twisted products of the forcing and pruning process; so did\r\nthe new child-gardens differ from the old schools.\r\n\r\nNo wonder children wore so different an aspect. They had the fresh,\r\ninsatiable thirst for knowledge which has been wisely slaked, but never\r\ngiven the water-torture. As I recalled my own youth, and thought of all\r\nthose young minds set in rows, fixed open as with a stick between the\r\nteeth, and forced to drink, drink, drink till all desire was turned to\r\nloathing, I felt a sudden wish to be born again--now!--and begin over.\r\n\r\nAs an adult observer, I found this re-arranged world jarring and\r\ndispleasing in many ways; but as I sat among the children, played with\r\nthem, talked with them, became somewhat acquainted with their views of\r\nthings, I began to see that to them the new world was both natural and\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nWhen they learned that I was a "leftover" from what to them seemed past\r\nages, I became extremely popular. There was a rush to get near me, and\r\neager requests to tell them about old times--checked somewhat by\r\npoliteness, yet always eager.\r\n\r\nBut the cheerful pride with which I began to describe the world as I\r\nknew it was considerably dashed by their comments. What I had considered\r\nas necessary evils, or as no evils at all, to them appeared as silly and\r\ndisgraceful as cannibalism; and there grew among them an attitude of\r\nchivalrous pity for my unfortunate upbringing which was pretty to see.\r\n\r\n"I see no child in glasses!" I suddenly remarked one day.\r\n\r\n"Of course not," answered the teacher I stood by. "We use books very\r\nlittle, you see. Education no longer impairs our machinery."\r\n\r\nI recalled the Boston school children and the myopic victims of\r\nGermany\'s archaic letter-press; and freely admitted that this was\r\nadvance. Much of the instruction was oral--much, very much, came through\r\ngames and exercises; books, I found, were regarded rather as things to\r\nconsult, like a dictionary, or as instruments of high enjoyment.\r\n\r\n"School books"--"text books"--scarcely existed, at least for children.\r\nThe older ones, some of them, plunged into study with passion; but their\r\neyes were good and their brains were strong; also their general health.\r\nThere was no "breakdown from overstudy;" that slow, cruel, crippling\r\ninjury--sometimes death, which we, wise and loving parents of past days,\r\nso frequently forced upon our helpless children.\r\n\r\nNaturally happy, busy, self-respecting, these grew up; with a wide\r\ncapacity for action, a breadth of general knowledge which was almost\r\nincredible, a high standard of courtesy, and vigorous, well-exercised\r\nminds. They were trained to think, I found; to question, discuss,\r\ndecide; they could reason.\r\n\r\nAnd they faced life with such loving enthusiasm! Such pride in the new\r\naccomplishments of the world! Such a noble, boundless ambition to do\r\nthings, to make things, to help the world still further.\r\n\r\nAnd from infancy to adolescence--all through these years of happy\r\ngrowing--there was nothing whatever to differentiate the boys from the\r\ngirls! As a rule, they could not be distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was this new growth of humanity which made continuing social progress\r\nso rapid and so sure.\r\n\r\nThese young minds had no rubbish in them. They had a vivid sense of the\r\nworld as a whole, quite beyond their family "relations." They were\r\nmarvelously reasonable, free from prejudice, able to see and willing to\r\ndo. And this spreading tide of hope and courage flowed back into the\r\nolder minds, as well as forward into the new I found that people\'s ideas\r\nof youth and age had altered materially. Nellie said it was due to the\r\nchange in women--but then she laid most things to that. She reminded me\r\nthat women used to be considered only as females, and were "old" when no\r\nlonger available in that capacity; but that as soon as they recognized\r\nthemselves as human beings they put "Grandma" into the background, and\r\n"Mother" too; and simply went on working and growing and enjoying life\r\nup into the lively eighties--even nineties, sometimes.\r\n\r\n"Brains do not cease to function at fifty," she said. "Just because a\r\nwoman is no longer an object to \'fall in love\' with, it does not follow\r\nthat life has no charms for her. Women to-day have all that they ever\r\nhad before, all that was good in it; and more, a thousand times more.\r\nWhen the lives of half the world widen like that it widens the other\r\nhalf too."\r\n\r\nThis quite evidently had happened.\r\n\r\nThe average mental standard was higher, the outlook broader. I found\r\nmany very ordinary people, of course; some whose only attitude toward\r\nthis wonderful new world was to enjoy its advantages; and even some who\r\ngrumbled. These were either old persons with bad digestions or new\r\nimmigrants from very backward countries.\r\n\r\nI traveled about, visiting different places, consulting all manner of\r\nauthorities, making notes, registering objections. It was all\r\ninteresting, and grew more so as it seemed less strange. My sense of\r\ntheatrical unreality gave way to a growing appreciation of the universal\r\nbeauty about me.\r\n\r\nArt, I found, held a very different position from what it used to hold.\r\nIt had joined hands with life again, was common, familiar, used in all\r\nthings. There were pictures, many and beautiful, but the great word Art\r\nwas no longer so closely confined to its pictorial form. It was not\r\nnarrow, expensive, requiring a special education, but part of the\r\natmosphere in which all children grew, all people lived.\r\n\r\nFor instance the theatre, which I remember as a two-dollar affair, and\r\nmainly vulgar and narrow, was now the daily companion and teacher. The\r\nhistoric instinct with which nearly every child is born was cultivated\r\nwithout check. The little ones played through all their first years of\r\ninstruction, played the old stone age (most natural to them!) the new\r\nstone age, the first stages of industry. Older children learned history\r\nthat way; and as they reached years of appreciation, special dramas were\r\nwritten for them, in which psychology and sociology were learned without\r\nhearing their names.\r\n\r\nThose happy, busy, eager young things played gaily through wide ranges\r\nof human experience; and when these emotions touched them in later\r\nyears, they were not strange and awful, but easy to understand.\r\n\r\nIn every smallest village there was a playhouse, not only in the\r\nchild-gardens, but for the older people. They each had their dramatic\r\ncompany, as some used to have their bands; had their musical companies\r\ntoo, and better ones.\r\n\r\nOut of this universal use of the drama rose freely those of special\r\ntalent who made it the major business of their lives; and the higher\r\naverage everywhere gave to these greater ones the atmosphere of real\r\nappreciation which a growing art must have.\r\n\r\nI asked Nellie how the people managed who lived in the real\r\ncountry--remote and alone.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t live that way any more," she said. "Only some stubborn old\r\npeople, like Uncle Jake and Aunt Dorcas. You see the women decided that\r\nthey must live in groups to have proper industrial and educational\r\nadvantages; and they do."\r\n\r\n"Where do the men live?" I asked grimly.\r\n\r\n"With the women, of course--Where should they? I don\'t mean that a\r\nperson cannot go and live in a hut on a mountain, if he likes; we do\r\nthat in summer, very largely. It is a rest to be alone part of the time.\r\nBut living, real human living, requires a larger group than one family.\r\nYou can see the results."\r\n\r\nI could and I did; though I would not always admit it to Nellie; and\r\nthis beautiful commonness of good music, good architecture, good\r\nsculpture, good painting, good drama, good dancing, good literature,\r\nimpressed me increasingly. Instead of those perpendicular peaks of\r\nisolated genius we used to have, surrounded by the ignorantly\r\nindifferent many, and the excessively admiring few, those geniuses now\r\nsloped gently down to the average on long graduated lines of decreasing\r\nability. It gave to the commonest people a possible road of upward\r\ndevelopment, and to the most developed a path of connection with the\r\ncommonest people. The geniuses seemed to like it too. They were not so\r\nconceited, not so disagreeable, not so lonesome.\r\n\r\nPeople seemed to have a very good time, even while at work; indeed very\r\nmany found their work more fun than anything else. The abundant leisure\r\ngave a sort of margin to life which was wholly new, to the majority at\r\nleast. It was that spare time, and the direct efforts of the government\r\nin wholesale educational lines, which had accomplished so much in the\r\nfirst ten years.\r\n\r\nOwen reminded me of the educational vitality even of the years I knew;\r\nof the university extension movement, the lectures in the public\r\nschools, the push of the popular magazines; the summer schools, the\r\nhundreds of thousands of club women, whose main effort seemed to be to\r\nimprove their minds.\r\n\r\n"And the Press," I said--"our splendid Press."\r\n\r\n"That was one of our worst obstacles, I\'m sorry to say," he answered.\r\n\r\nI looked at him. "Oh, go ahead, go ahead! You\'ll tell me the public\r\nschools were an obstacle next."\r\n\r\n"They would have been--if we hadn\'t changed them," he agreed. "But they\r\nwere in our hands at least, and we got them re-arranged very promptly.\r\nThat absurd old despotism which kept the grade of teachers down so low,\r\nwas very promptly changed. We have about five times as many teachers\r\nnow, fifty times as good and far better paid, not only in cash, but in\r\npublic appreciation. Our teachers are \'leading citizens\' now--we have\r\nelected one President from the School Principalship of a state."\r\n\r\nThis was news, and not unpleasant.\r\n\r\n"Have you elected any Editors?"\r\n\r\n"No--but we may soon. They are a new set of men now I can tell you; and\r\nwomen, of course. You remember in our day journalism was frankly treated\r\nas a trade; whereas it is visibly one of the most important\r\nprofessions."\r\n\r\n"And did you so reform those Editors, so that they became as\r\nself-sacrificing as country doctors?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. But we changed the business conditions. It was the advertising\r\nthat corrupted the papers--mostly; and the advertisers were only\r\nscreaming for bread and butter--especially butter. When Socialism\r\nreorganized business there was no need to scream.\r\n\r\n"But I find plenty of advertising in the papers and magazines."\r\n\r\n"Certainly--it is a great convenience. Have you studied it?"\r\n\r\nI had to own that I had not particularly--I never did like advertising.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find it worth reading. In the first place it\'s all true."\r\n\r\n"How do you secure that?"\r\n\r\n"We have made lying to the public a crime--don\'t you remember? Each\r\ncommunity has its Board of Standards; there is a constant effort to\r\nimprove standards you see, in all products; and expert judgment may\r\nalways be had, for nothing. If any salesman advertises falsely he loses\r\nhis job, if he\'s an official; and is posted, if he\'s selling as a\r\nprivate individual. When the public is told officially that Mr. Jones is\r\na liar it hurts his trade."\r\n\r\n"You have a Government Press?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly. The Press is pre-eminently a public function--it is not and\r\nnever was a private business--not legitimately."\r\n\r\n"But you do have private papers and magazines?"\r\n\r\n"Yes indeed, lots of them. Ever so many personal \'organs,\' large and\r\nsmall. But they don\'t carry advertising. If enough people will buy a\r\nman\'s paper to pay him, he\'s quite free to publish."\r\n\r\n"How do you prevent his carrying advertising?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s against the law--like any other misdemeanor. Post Office won\'t\r\ntake it--he can\'t distribute. No, if you want to find out about the\r\nlatest breakfast food--(and there are a score you never heard of)--or\r\nthe last improvement in fountain pens or airships--you find it all,\r\nclear, short, and reliable, in the hotel paper of every town. There\'s no\r\nsuch bulk of advertising matter now, you see; not so many people\r\nstruggling to sell the same thing."\r\n\r\n"Is all business socialized?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--and no. All the main business is; the big assured steady things\r\nthat our life depends on. But there is a free margin for individual\r\ninitiative--and always will be. We are not so foolish as to cut off that\r\nsupply. We have more inventors and idealists than ever; and plenty of\r\nchance for trial. You see the two hours a day which pays board, so to\r\nspeak, leaves plenty of time to do other work; and if the new thing the\r\nman does is sufficiently valuable to enough people, he is free to do\r\nthat alone. Like the little one-man papers I spoke of. If a man can find\r\nfive thousand people who will pay a dollar a year to read what he says\r\nhe\'s quite as likely to make his living that way."\r\n\r\n"Have you no competition at all?"\r\n\r\n"Plenty of it. All our young folks are racing and chasing to break the\r\nrecord; to do more work, better work, new work."\r\n\r\n"But not under the spur of necessity."\r\n\r\n"Why, yes they are. The most compelling necessity we know. They have to\r\ndo it; it is in them and must come out."\r\n\r\n"But they are all sure of a living, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course. Oh, I see! What you meant by necessity was hunger and\r\ncold. Bless you, John, poverty was no spur. It was a deadly\r\nan\xc3\xa6sthetic."\r\n\r\nI looked my disagreement, and he went on: "You remember the hideous\r\npoverty and helplessness of the old days--did that \'spur\' the population\r\nto do anything? Don\'t you see, John, that if poverty had been the\r\nsplendid stimulus it used to be thought, there wouldn\'t have been any\r\npoverty? Some few exceptional persons triumphed in spite of it, but we\r\nshall never know the amount of world loss in the many who did not.\r\n\r\n"It was funny," he continued meditatively, "how we went on believing\r\nthat in some mysterious way poverty \'strengthened character,\' \'developed\r\ninitiative,\' \'stimulated industry,\' and did all manner of fine things;\r\nand never tinned our eyes on the millions of people who lived and died\r\nin poverty with weakened characters, no initiative, a slow, enforced and\r\nhated industry. My word, John, what fools we were!"\r\n\r\nI was considering this Government Press he described. "How did you\r\ndispose of the newspapers you had?"\r\n\r\n"Just as we disposed of the saloons; drove them out of business by\r\nunderselling them with better goods. The laws against lying helped too."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how you can stop people\'s lying."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t stop their lying in private, except by better social\r\nstandards; but we can stop public lying, and we have. If a paper\r\npublished a false statement anyone could bring a complaint; and the\r\ndistrict attorney was obliged to prosecute. If a paper pleaded ignorance\r\nor misinformation it was let off with a fine and a reprimand the first\r\ntime, a heavy fine the second time, and confiscation the third time; as\r\nbeing proved by their own admission incompetent to tell the truth! If it\r\nwas shown to be an intentional falsehood they were put out of business\r\nat once."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very pretty," I said, "and sounds easy as you tell it; but\r\nwhat made people so hot about lying? They didn\'t used to mind it. The\r\nmore you tell me of these things the more puzzled I am as to what\r\naltered the minds of the people. They certainly had to alter\r\nconsiderably from the kind I remember, to even want all these changes,\r\nmuch more to enforce them."\r\n\r\nOwen wasn\'t much of a psychologist, and said so. He insisted that people\r\nhad wanted better things, only they did not know it.\r\n\r\n"Well--what made them know it?" I insisted. "Now here\'s one thing, small\r\nin a way, but showing a very long step in alteration; people dress\r\ncomfortably and beautifully; almost all of them. What made them do it?"\r\n\r\n"They have more money," Owen began, "more leisure and better education."\r\n\r\nBut I waved this aside.\r\n\r\n"That has nothing to do with it. The people with money and education\r\nwere precisely the ones who wore the most outrageous clothes. And as to\r\nleisure--they spent their leisure in getting up foolish costumes,\r\napparently."\r\n\r\n"Women are more intelligent, you see," he began again; but I dismissed\r\nthis also.\r\n\r\n"The intelligence of a Lord Chancellor didn\'t prevent his wearing a wig!\r\nHow did people break loose from the force of fashion, I want to know?"\r\n\r\nHe could not make this clear, and said he wouldn\'t try.\r\n\r\n"You show me all these material changes," I went on; "and I can see that\r\nthere was no real obstacle to them; but the obstacle that lasted so long\r\nwas in the people\'s minds. What moved that? Then you show me this\r\nmarvellous new education, as resulting in new kinds of people, better\r\npeople, wiser, freer, stronger, braver; and I can see that at work. But\r\nhow did you come to accept this new education? You needn\'t lay it all to\r\nthe women, as Nellie does. I knew one or two of the most advanced of\r\nthem in 1910, and they had no such world-view as this. They wore foolish\r\nclothes and had no ideas beyond \'Votes for Women\'--some of them.\r\n\r\n"No sir! I admit that there was potential wealth enough in the earth to\r\nsupport all this ease and beauty; and potential energy in the people to\r\nproduce the wealth. I admit that it was possible for people to leave off\r\nbeing stupid and become wise--evidently they have done so. But I don\'t\r\nsee what made them."\r\n\r\n"You go and see Dr. Borderson," said Owen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Borderson, it seemed, held the chair in Ethics at the University. I\r\nknew a Borderson once and was very fond of him. Poor Frank! If he was\r\nalive he would have more likely reached a prison or a hospital than a\r\nprofessorship. Yet he was brilliant enough. We were great friends in\r\ncollege, and before; let me see--thirty-five years ago. But he was\r\nexpelled for improper conduct, and went from bad to worse. The last I\r\nhad heard of him was in a criminal case--but he had run away and\r\ndisappeared. I well remembered the grief and shame it was to me at the\r\ntime to see such a promising young life ruined and lost so early.\r\n\r\nThinking of this, I was shown into the study of the great teacher of\r\nethics, and as I shook hands I met the keen brown eyes of--Frank\r\nBorderson. He had both my hands and shook them warmly.\r\n\r\n"Well, John! It is good to see you again. How well you look; how little\r\nyou have changed! It\'s a good world you\'ve come back to, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"You are the most astonishing thing I\'ve seen so far," I replied. "Do\r\nyou really mean it? Are you--a Professor of Ethics?"\r\n\r\n"When I used to be a God-forsaken rascal, eh? Yes, it\'s really so. I\'ve\r\ntaught Ethics for twenty years, and gradually pushed along to this\r\nposition. And I was a good deal farther off than Tibet, old man."\r\n\r\nI was tremendously glad to see him. It was more like a touch of the old\r\nlife than anything I had yet found--except Nellie, of course. We spoke\r\nfor some time of those years of boyhood; of the good times we had had\r\ntogether; of our common friends.\r\n\r\nHe kept me to dinner; introduced me to his wife, a woman with a rather\r\nsad, sweet face, which seemed to bear marks of deep experience; and we\r\nsettled down for an evening\'s talk.\r\n\r\n"I think you have come to the right person, John; not only because of my\r\nspecial studies, but because of my special line of growth. If I can tell\r\nyou what changed me, so quickly and so wholly, you won\'t be much puzzled\r\nabout the others, eh?"\r\n\r\nI fully agreed with him. The boy I knew was clever enough to dismiss all\r\ntheology, to juggle with philosophy and pick ethics to pieces; but his\r\nbest friends had been reluctantly compelled to admit that he had "no\r\nmoral character." He had, to my knowledge, committed a number of\r\nunquestionable "sins," and by hearsay I knew of vices and crimes that\r\nfollowed. And he was Dr. Borderson!\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take myself as a sample, Whitman fashion," said he. "There I was\r\nwhen you knew me--conceited, ignorant, clever, self-indulgent, weak,\r\nsensual, dishonest. After I was turned out of college I broke a good\r\nmany laws and nearly all the commandments. What was worse, in one way,\r\nwas that my \'wages\' were being paid me in disease--abominable disease.\r\nAlso I had two drug habits--alchohol and cocaine. Will you take me as a\r\nsample?"\r\n\r\nI looked at him. He had not the perfect health I saw so much of in the\r\nyounger people; but he seemed in no way an invalid, much less a drug\r\nvictim. His eyes were clear and bright, his complexion good, his hand\r\nsteady, his manner assured and calm.\r\n\r\n"Frank," said I, "you beat anything I\'ve seen yet. You stand absolutely\r\nto my mind as an illustration of \'Before Taking\' and \'After Taking.\' Now\r\nin the name of reason tell me what it was you Took!"\r\n\r\n"I took a new grip on Life--that\'s the whole answer. But you\r\nwant to know the steps, and I\'ll tell you. The new stage of\r\nethical perception we are in now--or, as you would probably say,\r\nthis new religion--presents itself to me in this way:\r\n\r\n"The business of the universe about us consists in the Transmission of\r\nEnergy. Some of it is temporarily and partially arrested in material\r\ncompositions; some is more actively expressed in vegetable and animal\r\nform; this stage of expression we call Life. We ourselves, the human\r\nanimals, were specially adapted for high efficiency in storing and\r\ntransmitting this energy; and so were able to enter into a combination\r\nstill more efficient; that is, into social relations. Humanity, man in\r\nsocial relation, is the best expression of the Energy that we know. This\r\nEnergy is what the human mind has been conscious of ever since it was\r\nconscious at all; and calls God. The relation between this God and this\r\nHumanity is in reality a very simple one. In common with all other life\r\nforms, the human being must express itself in normal functioning.\r\nBecause of its special faculty of consciousness, this human engine can\r\nfeel, see, think, about the power within it; and can use it more fully\r\nand wisely. All it has to learn is the right expression of its degree of\r\nlife-force, of Social Energy." He beamed at me. "I think it\'s about all\r\nthere, John."\r\n\r\n"You may be a very good Professor of Ethics for these new-made minds,\r\nbut you don\'t reach the old kind--not a little bit. To my mind you\r\nhaven\'t said anything--yet."\r\n\r\nHe seemed a little disappointed, but took it mildly. "Perhaps I am a\r\nlittle out of touch. Wait a moment--let me go back and try to take up\r\nthe old attitude."\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in his chair and shut his eyes. I saw an expression of\r\npain slowly grow and deepen on his face; and suddenly realized what he\r\nwas doing.\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind, Frank; don\'t do it; don\'t try. I\'ll catch on somehow."\r\n\r\nHe seemed not to hear me; but dropped his face in his hands. When he\r\nraised it was clear again. "Now I can make things clearer perhaps,"\r\nhe said. "We had in our minds thirty years ago a strange hodge-podge of\r\nold and new ideas. What was called God was still largely patterned after\r\nthe old tribal deity of the Hebrews. Our ideas of \'Sin\' were still\r\nmostly of the nature of disobedience--wrong only because we were told\r\nnot to do it. Sin as a personal offense against Somebody, and Somebody\r\nvery much offended; that was it. We were beginning to see something of\r\nSocial values, too, but not clearly. Our progress was in what we called\r\n\'The natural sciences\'; and we did not think with the part of our minds\r\nwherein we stored religion. Yet there was very great activity and\r\nprogress in religious thought; the whole field was in motion; the new\r\nchurches widening and growing in every direction; the older ones holding\r\non like grim death, trying not to change, and changing in spite of\r\nthemselves; and Ethics being taught indeed, but with no satisfying\r\nbasis. That\'s the kind of atmosphere you and I grew up in, John. Now\r\nhere was I, an ill-assorted team of impulses and characteristics,\r\nprejudiced against religion, ignorant of real ethics, and generally\r\ngoing to the devil--as we used to call it! You know how far down I\r\nwent--or something of it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak of it, Frank!" I said. "That was long ago; forget it, old\r\nman!" But he turned toward me a smile of triumph.\r\n\r\n"Forget it! I wouldn\'t forget one step of it if I could! Why, John, it\'s\r\nbecause of my intimate knowledge of these down-going steps that I can\r\nhelp other people up them!"\r\n\r\n"You looked decidedly miserable just now, all the same, when you were\r\nthinking them over."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bless you, John, I wasn\'t thinking of myself at all! I was thinking\r\nof the awful state of mind the world was in, and how it suffered! Of all\r\nthe horror and misery and shame; all that misplaced, unnecessary cruelty\r\nwe called punishment; the Dark Ages we were still in, in spite of all we\r\nhad to boast of. However, this new perception came."\r\n\r\nI interrupted him.\r\n\r\n"What came? Who came? Did you have a new revelation? Who did it? What do\r\nyou call it? Nobody seems to be able to give me definite information."\r\n\r\nHe smiled broadly. "You\'re a beautiful proof of the kind of mental\r\njumble I spoke of. Knowledge of evolution did not come by a revelation,\r\ndid it? Or did any one man, or two, give it to us? Darwin and Wallace\r\nwere not the only minds that helped to see and express that great idea;\r\nand many more had to spread it. These great truths break into the\r\nworld-mind through various individuals, and coalesce so that we cannot\r\ndisconnect them. We have had many writers, preachers, lecturers, who\r\ndiscoursed and explained; this new precept as to the relation between\r\nman and God came with such a general sweep that no one even tries to\r\ngive personal credit for it. These things are not personal--they are\r\nworld-percepts."\r\n\r\n"But every religion has had its Founder, hasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"_I_ don\'t call it a religion, my dear fellow! It\'s a science, like any\r\nother science. Ethics is The Science of Human Relation. It is called\r\nApplied Sociology--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"How does a thing like that touch one, personally?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"How does any science touch one personally? One studies a science, one\r\nteaches a science, one uses a science. That\'s the point--the _use_ of\r\nit. Our old scheme of religion was a thing to \'believe,\' or \'deny\'; it\r\nwas a sort of shibboleth, a test question one had to pass examination in\r\nto get good marks! What I\'m telling you about is a general recognition\r\nof right behavior, and a general grasp of the necessary power."\r\n\r\n"You leave out entirely the emotional side of religion."\r\n\r\n"Do I? I did not intend to. You see, we do not distinguish religion from\r\nlife now, and are apt to forget old terms. You are thinking, I suppose,\r\nof the love of God, and man, which we used to preach. We practice it\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n"That Energy I spoke of, when perceived by us, is called Love. Love, the\r\nreal thing we had in mind when we said \'God is Love,\' is beneficent\r\nenergy. It is the impulse of service, the desire to do, to help, to\r\nmake, to benefit. That is the \'love\' we were told to bestow on one\r\nanother. Now we do."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but what made you do it? What keeps you up to it?"\r\n\r\n"Just nature, John. It is human nature. We used to believe otherwise."\r\nHe was quiet for a while.\r\n\r\n"One of these new doctors got hold of me, when I was about as near the\r\nbottom as one can go and get back. Not a priest with a formula, nor a\r\nreformer with an exhortation; but a real physician, a soul-doctor, with\r\na passionate enthusiasm for an interesting case. That\'s what I was,\r\nJohn; not a lost soul; not even a \'sinner\'--just \'a case.\' Have you\r\nheard about these moral sanitariums?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--but not definitely."\r\n\r\n"Well, as soon as this view of things took hold, they began to want to\r\nisolate bad cases, and cure them if they could. And they cured me."\r\n\r\n"How, Frank--_how_? What did they tell you that you didn\'t know before?\r\nWhat did they do to you?"\r\n\r\n"Sane, strong, intelligent minds put themselves in connection with mine,\r\nJohn, and shared their strength with me. I was made to feel that my\r\nindividual failure was no great matter, but that my social duty was;\r\nthat the whole of my dirty past was as nothing to all our splendid\r\nfuture, that whatever I had done was merely to be forgotten--the sooner\r\nthe better, and that all life was open before me--all human life;\r\nendless, beautiful, profoundly interesting--the game was on, and I was\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n"John-- I wish I could make you feel it. It was as if we had all along\r\nhad inside us an enormous reservoir of love, human love, that had\r\nsomehow been held in and soured! This new arrangement of our minds let\r\nit out--to our limitless relief and joy. No \'sin\'--think of that! Just\r\nlet it sink in. No such thing as sin. . . . We had, collectively and\r\nprivately, made mistakes, and done the wrong thing, often. What of it?\r\nOf course we had. A growing race _grew that way_.\r\n\r\n"Now we are wiser and need not keep on going wrong. We had learned that\r\nlife was far easier, pleasanter, more richly satisfying when followed on\r\nthese new lines--and the new lines were not hard to learn. Love was the\r\nnatural element of social life. Love meant service, service meant doing\r\none\'s special work well, and doing it for the persons served--of course!\r\n\r\n"_All_ our mistakes lay in our belated Individualism. You cannot\r\npredicate Ethics of individuals; you cannot fulfill any religion as\r\nindividuals. My fellow creatures took hold of me, you see. That power\r\nthat was being used so extensively for physical healing in our young\r\ndays had become a matter of common knowledge--and use."\r\n\r\n"How many of these--moral hygienists--did you have?"\r\n\r\n"Scores, hundreds, thousands--we all help one another now. If a person\r\nis tired and blue and has lost his grip, if he can\'t rectify it by\r\nchange of diet and change of scene, he goes to a moral hygienist, as you\r\nrightly call it, and gets help. I do a lot of that sort of work."\r\n\r\nI meditated awhile, and again shook my head. "I\'m afraid it\'s no use. I\r\ncan\'t make it seem credible. I hear what you say and I see what you\'ve\r\ndone--but I do not get any clear understanding of the process. With\r\npeople as they were, with all those casehardened old sinners, all the\r\ncrass ignorance, the stupidity, the sodden prejudice, the apathy, the\r\nselfishness--to make a world like that see reason--in thirty\r\nyears!--No--I don\'t get it."\r\n\r\n"You are wrong in your premises, John. Human nature is, and was, just as\r\ngood as the rest of nature. Two things kept us back--wrong conditions,\r\nand wrong ideas; we have changed both. I think you forget the sweeping\r\nadvance in material conditions and its effect on character. What made\r\nthe well-bred, well-educated, well-meaning, pleasant people we used to\r\nknow? Good conditions, for them and their ancestors. There were just as\r\npleasant people among the poor and among their millions of children;\r\nthey had every capacity for noble growth--given the chance. It took no\r\nwholesale change of heart to make people want shorter hours, better pay,\r\nbetter housing, food, clothes, amusements. As soon as the shameful\r\npressure of poverty was taken off humanity it rose like a freed spring.\r\nHumanity\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"There were some things all wrong," I replied, "that I know. You could\r\nnot obliterate hereditary disease in ten--or thirty years. You couldn\'t\r\nmake clean women of hundreds of thousands of prostitutes. You couldn\'t\r\nturn an invalid tramp into a healthy gentleman."\r\n\r\nHe stopped me. "We could do better than that," he said, "and we have. I\r\nbegin to see your central difficulty, John; the difficulty that used to\r\nhold us all. You are looking at life as a personal affair--a matter of\r\npersonal despair or salvation."\r\n\r\n"Of course, what else is it?"\r\n\r\n"What _else_! Why, that is no part of human life! Human life is social,\r\nJohn, collectively, common, or it isn\'t human life at all. Hereditary\r\ndisease looks pretty hopeless when you see one generation or two or\r\nthree so cursed. But when you realize how swiftly the stream of human\r\nlife can be cleansed of it, you take a fresh hold. The percentage of\r\nhereditary disease has sunk by more than half in thirty years, John, and\r\nat its present rate of decrease will be gone, clean gone, in another\r\ntwenty. Remember that every case is known, and that they are either\r\nprevented from transmitting the inheritance, isolated, or voluntarily\r\nliving single. Diseases from bad conditions we no longer endure, nor\r\ndiseases from ignorance, those from bacilli we are able to resist or\r\ncure; disease was never a permanent thing--only an accident. As for the\r\nprostitutes--we thought them \'ruined\' because they were no longer\r\nsuitable for our demands in marriage. As if that was everything! I tell\r\nyou we opened a way out for them!"\r\n\r\n"Namely?"\r\n\r\n"Namely all the rest of life! Sex-life isn\'t everything, John. Not fit\r\nto be a mother, we said to them; never mind--there is everything else in\r\nthe world to be. You may remember, my friend, that thousands of men, as\r\nvicious as any prostitutes, and often as diseased, continued to live, to\r\nwork, and to enjoy. Why shouldn\'t the women? You haven\'t ruined your\r\nlives, we said to them; only one part. It\'s a loss, a great loss, but\r\nnever mind, the whole range of human life remains open to you, the great\r\nmoving world of service and growth and happiness. If you\'re sick, you\'re\r\nsick--we\'ll cure it if possible. If not, you\'ll die--never mind, we all\r\ndie--that\'s nothing."\r\n\r\n"Does your new religion call death nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. The fuss we made about death was wholly owing to the old\r\nreligions; the post-mortem religions, their whole basis was death."\r\n\r\n"Hold on a bit. Do you mean to tell me the people aren\'t afraid of death\r\nany more?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit. Why should they be? Every living thing dies; that\'s part of\r\nthe living. We do not hide it from children now, we teach it to them."\r\n\r\n"Teach death--to children! How horrible!"\r\n\r\n"Did you see or hear anything horrible in your educational excursions,\r\nJohn? I know you didn\'t. No, they learn it naturally; in their gardens;\r\nin their autumn and winter songs; in their familiarity with insects and\r\nanimals. Our children learn life, death, and immortality, from\r\nsilk-worms; and, then only incidentally. The silk is what they are\r\nstudying.\r\n\r\n"It takes a great many silk-worms to make silk, generations of them.\r\nThey see them born, live and die, as incidents in silk culture. So we\r\nshow them how people are born, live and die, in the making of human\r\nhistory. The idea is worked into our new educational literature--and all\r\nour literature for that matter. We see human life as a continuous whole\r\nnow. People are only temporary parts of it. Dying isn\'t any more trouble\r\nthan being born.\r\n\r\n"People feared death, originally, because it hint; being chased and\r\neaten was not pleasant. But natural dying does not hurt. Then they were\r\nmade to fear it by the hell-school of religions. All that is gone by.\r\nOur religion rests on life."\r\n\r\n"The life of this world or the life eternal?"\r\n\r\n"The eternal life of this world, John. We have no quarrel with anyone\'s\r\nbelief as to what may happen after death, that is a free field; but the\r\nglory and power of our religion is that it rests with assurance on\r\ncommon knowledge of the beautiful facts of life. Here is Humanity, a\r\ncontinuing stream of life. Its line of advance is clear. That which\r\nmakes Humanity stronger, wiser and happier is evidently what is right\r\nfor it to do. We do teach it to all our children."\r\n\r\n"And they do it?"\r\n\r\n"Of course they do it. Why shouldn\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"But our evil tendencies----"\r\n\r\n"We don\'t have evil tendencies, John--and never did. We have earlier and\r\nlater tendencies; and it is perfectly possible to show the child which\r\nis which."\r\n\r\n"But surely it is easier to follow the lower impulses than the higher;\r\neasier to give way than to strive."\r\n\r\n"There\'s the old misconception, John, that \'striving idea.\' We assumed\r\nthat it was \'natural\' to be \'bad\' and \'unnatural\' to be \'good\'--that we\r\nhad to make special efforts, painful and laborious, to become better. We\r\nhad not seen, thirty years ago, that social evolution is as \'natural\' as\r\nthe evolution of the horse from the eohippus. If it was easier to be an\r\neohippus than a horse why did the thing change?\r\n\r\n"As to that army of \'fallen women\' you are so anxious about, they just\r\ngot up again, that\'s all, got up and went on. They had only fallen from\r\none position; there was plenty of room left to stand and walk. Why they\r\nwere not a speck on society compared to the \'fallen men.\' Two hundred\r\nthousand prostitutes in the city of New York--well? How many patrons? A\r\nmillion, at the least. They kept on doing business, and enjoying life. I\r\ntell you, John, all the unnecessary evils of condition in the old days,\r\nwere as nothing to the unnecessary evils of our foolish ideas! And ideas\r\ncan be changed in the twinkling of an eye!\r\n\r\n"As to your hoboes and bums, that invalid tramp you instanced--I can\r\nsettle your mind on that point. I was an invalid tramp, John; a\r\ndrunkard, a cocaine fiend, a criminal, sick, desperate, as bad as they\r\nmake them."\r\n\r\n"Which brings us back to that \'moral sanitarium\' I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I strayed away from it. I keep forgetting my own case. But it is\r\nan excellent one for illustration. I was taken hold of with the strong\r\nhand, and given a course of double treatment, deep and thorough. By\r\ndouble treatment I mean physical and mental at once; such a complete\r\noverhauling and wise care as enabled my exhausted vitality slowly to\r\nreassert itself, and at the same time such strong tender cheerful\r\ncompanionship, such well-devised entertainment, such interesting,\r\nirresistible instruction--Why, John--put a tramp into Paradise, and\r\nthere\'s some hope of him."\r\n\r\nI was about to say that tramps did not deserve Paradise, but as I\r\nremembered what this man had been, and saw what he was now, I refrained.\r\n\r\nHe read my mind at once.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a question of desert, John. We no longer deal in terms of\r\npersonal reward or punishment. If I have a bad finger or a bad tooth I\r\nsave it if I can; not because it deserves it, but because I need it.\r\nPeople who used to be called sinners are now seen to be diseased members\r\nof society, and society turns all its regenerative forces on at once. We\r\nnever used to dream of that flood of power we had at hand--the\r\nRegenerative Forces of Society!"\r\n\r\nHe sat smiling, his fine eyes full of light. "Sometimes we had to\r\namputate," he continued, "especially at first. It is very seldom\r\nnecessary now."\r\n\r\n"You mean you killed the worst people?"\r\n\r\n"We killed many hopeless degenerates, insane, idiots, and real perverts,\r\nafter trying our best powers of cure. But it is really astonishing to\r\nsee how much can be done with what we used to call criminals, merely by\r\nfirst-class physical treatment. I can remember how strange it seemed to\r\nme, having elaborate baths, massage, electric stimulus, perfect food,\r\nclean comfortable beds, beautiful clothes, books, music, congenial\r\ncompany, and wonderful instruction. It was very confusing. It went far\r\nto rearrange all my ideas."\r\n\r\n"If you treat--social invalids--like that, I should think they would\r\n\'lie down;\' just to remain in hospital forever. Or go out and be bad in\r\norder to get back again."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," he said. "A healthy man can\'t lie around and do nothing very\r\nlong. Also it is good outside too, remember. Life is good, pleasant,\r\neasy. Why on earth should a man want to prowl around at night and steal\r\nwhen he can have all he wants, with less effort, in the daytime? Happy\r\npeople do not become criminals.\r\n\r\n"But I can tell you what treatment like that does to one. It gives a man\r\na new view of human life, of what it is he belongs to. A sense of pride\r\nin our common accomplishment, of gratitude for the pleasure he receives,\r\nof a natural desire to contribute something. I took this new ethics--it\r\nsatisfied me, it\'s reasonable, it\'s necessary. We make it our basic\r\nstudy now, in all the schools. You must have noticed that?"\r\n\r\nYes, I had noticed it, as I looked back. "But they don\'t call it that,"\r\nI said.\r\n\r\n"No, they don\'t call it anything to the children. It is just life, the\r\nrules of decent behavior."\r\n\r\nWe sat silent awhile after this. Things were clearing up a little in my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n"A sort of crystallization of chaotic progressive thought into clear\r\ndiamonds of usable truth--is that about what happened?" I said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly it."\r\n\r\n"And a general refutation and clearing out of--of."\r\n\r\n"Of a lot of things we deeply believed--that were not so! That is what\r\nwas the matter with us, John. Our minds were full of what Mrs. Eddy\r\nchristened error. I wish I could make you feel what a sunrise it was to\r\nthe world when we left off believing lies and learned the facts."\r\n\r\n"Can you, in a few words, outline a little of your new \'Ethics\' to the\r\nlay mind?"\r\n\r\n"Easily. It is all \'lay\' enough. We don\'t make a separate profession of\r\nreligion, or a separate science of ethics. Ethics is social hygiene--it\r\nteaches how humanity must live in order to be well and strong. We show\r\nthe child the patent facts of social relation, how all our daily life,\r\nour accumulated wealth and beauty and continuing power, rests on common\r\naction, on what people do together. Everything about him teaches that.\r\nThen we show him the reasons why such and such actions are wrong, what\r\nthe results are; how to avoid wrong lines of action and adopt right\r\nones. It\'s no more difficult than teaching any other game, and far more\r\ninteresting."\r\n\r\nI suppose I looked unconvinced, for he added, "Remember we have nature\r\non our side. It is natural for a social animal to develop social\r\ninstincts; any personal desire which works against the social good is\r\nclearly a survival of a lower pre-social period; wrong, in that it is\r\nout of place. What we used to call criminals were relics of the past. By\r\nartificially maintaining low conditions, such as poverty, individual\r\nwealth, we bred low-grade types. We do not breed them any more."\r\n\r\nAgain we sat silent. I was nursing my knee and sat looking into the\r\nfire; the soft shimmering play of rosy light and warmth with which\r\nelectricity now gave jewels to our rooms.\r\n\r\nHe followed my eyes.\r\n\r\n"That clean, safe, beautiful power was always here, John--but we had not\r\nlearned of it. The power of wind and water and steam were here--before\r\nwe learned to use them. All this splendid power of human life was\r\nhere--only we did not know it."\r\n\r\nAfter that talk with Frank Borderson I felt a little clearer in my mind\r\nabout what had taken place. I saw a good deal of him, and he introduced\r\nme to others who were in his line of work. Also I got to know his wife\r\npretty well. She was not so great an authority on ethics as he; but an\r\nexcellent teacher, widely useful.\r\n\r\nOne day I said something to her about her lovely spirit, and what she\r\nmust have been to him--such an uplifting influence.\r\n\r\nShe laughed outright.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have to tell you the facts, Mr. Robertson, as part of your\r\ninstruction. So far from my uplifting him, he picked me out of the\r\ngutter, literally, dead drunk in the gutter, the lowest kind of wreck.\r\nHe made me over. He gave me--Life."\r\n\r\nHer eyes shone.\r\n\r\n"We work together," she added cheerfully.\r\n\r\nThey did work together, and evidently knew much happiness. I noted a\r\nsort of deep close understanding between them, as in those who have been\r\nthrough the wars in company.\r\n\r\nI found Nellie knew about them. "Yes, indeed," she said. "They are\r\ndevoted to each other, and most united in their work. He was just\r\nbeginning to try to work, after his own rebuilding; but feeling pretty\r\nlonesome. He felt that he had no chance of any personal life, you see,\r\nand there were times when he missed it badly. He had no right to marry,\r\nof course; that is, with a well woman. And then he found this broken\r\nlily--and mended it. There can\'t be any children, but there is great\r\nhappiness, you can see that."\r\n\r\n"And they are--received?"\r\n\r\n"Received?--Oh, I remember! You mean they are invited to dinners and\r\nparties. Why, yes."\r\n\r\n"Not among the best people, surely?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely that, the very best; people who appreciate their wonderful\r\nlives."\r\n\r\n"Tell me this. Sister; what happened to the Four Hundred--the F.F.\r\nV\'s--and the rest of the aristocracy?"\r\n\r\n"The same thing that happened to all of us. They were only people, you\r\nsee. Their atrophied social consciousness was electrified with the new\r\nthoughts and feelings. They woke up, too, most of them. Some just died\r\nout harmlessly. They were only by-products."\r\n\r\nI consulted a rather reactionary old professor of Sociology, Morris\r\nBanks; one who had been teaching Political Economy in my youth, and who\r\nought to be able to remember things. I asked him if he would be so good\r\nas to show me the dark side of this shield.\r\n\r\n"Surely there must have been opposition, misunderstanding, the usual\r\ndifficulties of new adjustments," I said. "You remember the first years\r\nof change--I wish you would give me a clear account of it."\r\n\r\nThe old man considered awhile: "Take any one state, any city, or country\r\nlocality, and study back a little," he said, "and you find the story is\r\nabout the same. There was opposition and dissent, of course, but it\r\ndecreased very rapidly. You see the improvements at first introduced\r\nwere such universal benefits that there could not be any serious\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n"By the time we had universal suffrage the women were more than ready\r\nfor it, full of working plans to carry out, and rich by the experience\r\nof the first trials.\r\n\r\n"By the time Socialism was generally adopted we had case after case of\r\nproven good in Socialistic methods; and also the instructive background\r\nof some failures."\r\n\r\n"But the big men who ran the country to suit themselves in my time, they\r\ndidn\'t give up without a struggle surely? You must have had _some_\r\nfighting," I said.\r\n\r\nHe smiled in cheerful reminiscence. "We had a good deal of noise, if\r\nthat\'s what you mean. But there\'s no fighting to be done, with soldiers,\r\nif the soldiers won\'t fight. Our workingmen declined to shoot or to be\r\nshot any longer, and left the big capitalists to see what they could do\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"But they had the capital?"\r\n\r\n"Not all of it. The revenues of the cities and of the United States\r\nGovernment are pretty considerable, especially when you save the seventy\r\nper cent, we used to spend on wars past and possible; and the ten or\r\ntwenty more that went in waste and graft. With a Socialist State private\r\nCapital has no grip!"\r\n\r\n"Did you confiscate it?"\r\n\r\n"Did not have to. The people who were worth anything, swung into line\r\nand went to work like other people. Those that weren\'t were just let\r\nalone. Nobody has any respect for them now."\r\n\r\n"You achieved Socialism without bloodshed?"\r\n\r\n"We did. It did not happen all at once, you see; just spread and spread\r\nand proved its usefulness."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nMore and more I cut loose from the explanatory guiding strings of my\r\nsister and the family, even from the requested information of\r\nspecialists, and wandered by myself in search of the widening daily\r\nacquaintance which alone could make life seem real again.\r\n\r\nIt was an easy world to wander in. The standard of general courtesy and\r\nintelligence of the officials, and of the average passer-by, was as much\r\nabove what I remembered as the standard in Boston used to be above that\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\nAs most of the business was public business one could study and inquire\r\nfreely. As much work as could be advantageously localized was so\r\narranged, this saving in transportation. The clothing industry, for\r\ninstance, instead of being carried on in swarming centers, and then\r\ndistributed all over the country, formed part of the pleasant everyday\r\nwork in each community and was mostly in the hands of women.\r\n\r\nAs a man I could appreciate little of the improved quality of fabrics,\r\nsave as I noticed their beauty, and that my own clothes wore longer, and\r\nboth looked and felt more agreeable. But women told me how satisfying it\r\nwas to know that silk was silk, and wool, wool. This improvement in\r\ntextile values, with the outgrowing of that long obsession called\r\nfashion, reduced the labor of clothes-making materially.\r\n\r\nWomen\'s clothes, I found, as I strolled were very delicate and fine, and\r\nhad a gracious dignity and sanity far removed from the frantic\r\nconcoctions I remembered in the windows;--shredded patchwork of muslin\r\nand lace, necessarily frail and short-lived even as ornaments, never\r\nuseful, and costing arduous labor in construction, with corresponding\r\nexpense to the purchaser.\r\n\r\nThe robes and gowns were a joy to the eye. Some showed less taste than\r\nothers, naturally, but nowhere was to be seen the shameless ugliness so\r\ncommon in my youth.\r\n\r\nBeauty and peace, I found, care, leisure, quietness, plenty of gaiety,\r\ntoo, both in young and old. It struck me that the young people, owing to\r\ntheir wider and sounder upbringing, were more serious, and that older\r\npeople, owing to their safer, easier lives, were jollier. These\r\nsweet-faced, broad-minded young women did not show so much giggling\r\ninanity as once seemed necessary to them; and a young man, even a young\r\nman in college, did not, therefore, find pleasure in theft, cruelty,\r\ngross practical jokes and destruction of property.\r\n\r\nAs I noted this, I brought myself up with a start. It looked as if\r\nNellie had written it. Surely, when I was in college--and there rose up\r\nwithin me a memory of the crass, wasteful follies that used to be called\r\n"pranks" in my time, and considered perfectly natural in young men. I\r\nhad not minded them in those days. It gave me a queer feeling to see by\r\nmy own words how my judgment was affected already.\r\n\r\nI explored the city from end to end, and satisfied myself that there was\r\nno poverty in it, no street that was not clean, no house that was not\r\nfit for human habitation. That is, as far as I could judge from an\r\noutside view.\r\n\r\nAmong the masses of people, after their busy mornings, there were vast\r\nnumbers who used the afternoons for learning, the easy, interesting,\r\nendless learning now carried on far and wide. The more they learned the\r\nmore they wanted to know; and the best minds, free for research work,\r\nand upheld in it by the deepening attention of the world, constantly\r\npushed on the boundaries of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThere were some hospitals yet, but as one to a hundred of what used to\r\nbe, of higher quality, and fuller usefulness. There were some of what I\r\nshould have called prisons, though the life inside was not only as\r\ncomfortable as that without, but administered with a stricter care for\r\nthe advantage of those within.\r\n\r\nThere were the moral sanitariums--healthful and beautiful, richly\r\nendowed with the world\'s best methods of improvement, and managed by the\r\nworld\'s best people. It made me almost dizzy to try to take in this\r\nopposite pole of judgment on the criminal.\r\n\r\nOut of town I found that the park-like roads, so generally in use, by no\r\nmeans interfered with the wide stretches of what I used to call "real\r\ncountry." Intensive agriculture took less ground, rather more; and the\r\nwide use of food-bearing trees had restored the wooded aspect, so\r\npleasant in every sense.\r\n\r\nThe small country towns were of special interest to me; I visited scores\r\nof them; each differing from the others, all beautiful and clean and\r\nbusy. They were numerous too; replacing the areas of scattered lonely\r\nfarmhouses, with these comfortable and pretty groups, each in its home\r\npark, with its standard of convenience as high as that in any town.\r\n\r\nThe smallest group had its power plant, supplying all the houses with\r\nheat, light and water, had its child-gardens, its Town House and Club\r\nHouse, its workshops and foodshops as necessary as its postoffices.\r\n\r\nThe Socialized industries ensured employment to every citizen, and\r\nprovided all the necessaries of life--larger order this than it used to\r\nbe. Quite above this broad base of social control, the life of the\r\npeople went on; far freer and more open to individual development than\r\nit had ever had a chance to be in the whole history of the world.\r\n\r\nThis I frankly conceded. I found I was making more concessions in my\r\nnote-book than I had yet made to either Nellie or Owen. They encouraged\r\nme to travel about by myself. In fact, my sister was now about to resume\r\nher college position and Owen was going with her.\r\n\r\nThey both advised me not to settle upon any work for a full year.\r\n\r\n"That\'s little enough time in which to cover thirty," Nellie said,\r\npatting my shoulder. "But you\'re doing splendidly, John. We are proud of\r\nyou. And there\'s no hurry. You know there\'s enough from our mine to\r\nenable you to join the \'leisure class\'--if you want to!"\r\n\r\nI had no idea of doing this, as she well knew, but I did feel it\r\nnecessary to get myself in some way grafted on to this new world before\r\nI took up regular employment. I found that there was not much call for\r\nancient languages in the colleges, even if I had been in touch with the\r\nnew methods; but there remained plenty of historical work, for which I\r\nhad now a special fitness. Indeed some of my new scientific friends\r\nassured me I could be of the utmost service, with my unique experience.\r\n\r\nSo I was not worried about what to do, nor under any pressure about\r\ndoing it. But the more I saw of all these new advantages, the more I was\r\nobliged to admit that they were advantages; the more I traveled and read\r\nand learned, the more lonesome and homesick I became.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful world, but it was not my world. It was like a\r\nbeautiful dream, but seemed a dream nevertheless. I could no longer\r\ndispute that it was possible for people to be "healthy, wealthy and\r\nwise"; and happy, too--visibly happy--here they all were; working and\r\nplaying and enjoying life as naturally as possible. But they were not\r\nthe people I used to know; those, too, were like Frank Borderson and\r\nMorris Banks--changed so that they seemed more unreal than the others.\r\n\r\nThe beauty and peace and order of the whole thing wore on me. I wanted\r\nto hear the roar of the elevated--to smell the foul air of the subway\r\nand see the people pile in, pushing and angry, as I still remembered in\r\nmy visits to New York.\r\n\r\nI wanted to see some neglected-looking land, some ragged suburbs, some\r\nfar-away farmhouse alone under its big elms, with its own barns in\r\nodorous proximity, its own cows, boy-driven, running and stumbling home\r\nto be milked.\r\n\r\nI wanted a newspaper which gave me the excitement of guessing what the\r\ntruth was, I wanted to see some foolish, crazily dressed, giggling\r\ngirls, and equally foolish boys, but better dressed and less giggling,\r\ngiven to cigarettes and uproarious "good times."\r\n\r\nI was homesick, desperately homesick. So without saying a word to anyone\r\nI betook myself to old Slide-face, to see Uncle Jake.\r\n\r\nAll the way down--and I went by rail--no air travel for this\r\nhomecoming!--I felt an increasing pleasure in the familiar look of\r\nthings. The outlines of the Alleghanies had not changed. I would not get\r\nout at any town, the shining neatness of the railroad station was\r\nenough; but the sleeping cars were a disappointment. The beds were wide,\r\nsoft, cool, the blankets of light clean wool, the air clear and fresh,\r\nthe noise and jar almost gone. Oh, well, I couldn\'t expect to have\r\neverything as it used to be, of course.\r\n\r\nBut when I struck out, on foot, from Paintertown, and began to climb the\r\nroad that led to my old home, my heart was in my mouth. It was a better\r\nroad, of course--but I hardly noticed that. All the outlying farms were\r\nbetter managed and the little village groups showed here and there--but\r\nI shut my eyes to these things.\r\n\r\nThe hills were the same--the hills I had grown up among. They couldn\'t\r\nalter the face of the earth much--that was still recognizable. Our own\r\nhouse I did not visit--both father and mother were gone, and the little\r\nwooden building replaced by a concrete mining office. Nellie had told me\r\nabout all this; it was one reason why I had not come back before.\r\n\r\nBut now I went past our place almost with my eyes shut; and kept on\r\nalong the road to Uncle Jake\'s. He had been a rich man, as farmers went,\r\nowning the land for a mile or two on every side, owning Slide-face as a\r\nmatter of fact; and as he made enough from the rich little upland valley\r\nwhere the house stood, to pay his taxes, he owned it still.\r\n\r\nThe moment I reached his boundary I knew it, unmistakably. A ragged,\r\nhomemade sign, sagging from its nails, announced "Private Road. No\r\ntrespassers allowed." Evidently they heeded the warning, for the stony,\r\nwashed-out roadbed was little traveled.\r\n\r\nMy heart quite leaped as I set foot on it. It was not "improved" in the\r\nleast from what I remembered in my infrequent visits. My father and\r\nUncle Jake had "a coldness" between them; which would have been a\r\nquarrel, I fancy, if father had not been a minister, so I never saw much\r\nof these relations.\r\n\r\nDrusilla I remembered well enough, though, a pretty, babyish thing, and\r\nAunt Dorcas\'s kind, patient, tired smile, and the fruit cakes she made.\r\n\r\nUp and up, through the real woods, ragged and thick with dead boughs,\r\nfallen trunks and underbrush, not touched by any forester, and finally,\r\naround the shoulder of Slide-face, to the farm.\r\n\r\nI stood still and drew in a long breath of utter satisfaction. Here was\r\nsomething that had not changed. There was an old negro plowing, the same\r\nnegro I remembered, apparently not a day older. It is wonderful how\r\nlittle they do change with years. His wool showed white though, as he\r\ndoffed his ragged cap and greeted me with cheerful cordiality as Mass\'\r\nJohn.\r\n\r\n"We all been hearin\' about you, Mass\' John. We been powerful sorry \'bout\r\nyou long time, among de heathen," he said. "You folks\'ll be glad to see\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"Well, young man!" said Uncle Jake, with some show of cordiality;\r\n"better late than never. We wondered if you intended to look up your\r\ncountry relations."\r\n\r\nBut Aunt Dorcas put her thin arms around my neck and kissed me, teary\r\nkisses with little pats and exclamations. "To think of it! Thirty years\r\namong savages! We heard about it from Nellie--she wrote us, of course.\r\nNellie\'s real good to keep us posted."\r\n\r\n"She never comes to see us!" said my Uncle. "Nor those youngsters of\r\nhers. We\'ve never had them here but once. They\'re too \'advanced\' for\r\nold-fashioned folks."\r\n\r\nUncle Jake\'s long upper lip set firmly; I remembered that look, as he\r\nused to sit in his wagon and talk with mother at our gate, refusing to\r\ncome in, little sunny-haired Drusilla looking shyly at me from under her\r\nsunbonnet the while.\r\n\r\nWhere was Drusilla? Surely not--that! A frail, weak, elderly, quiet,\r\nlittle woman stood there by Aunt Dorcas, her smooth fine, ash-brown hair\r\ndrawn tightly back to a flat knot behind, her dull blue calico dress\r\nfalling starkly about her.\r\n\r\nShe came forward, smiling, and held out a thin work-worn hand. "We\'re so\r\nglad to see you, Cousin John," she said. "We certainly are."\r\n\r\nThey made much of me in the old familiar ways I had so thirsted for. The\r\nsense of family background, of common knowledge and experience was\r\ncomforting in the extreme, the very furnishings and clothes as I\r\nrecalled them. I told them what a joy it was.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to please Uncle Jake enormously.\r\n\r\n"I _thought_ you\'d do it," he said. "Like to find one place that hasn\'t\r\nbeen turned upside down by all these new-fangled notions. Dreadful\r\nthings have been goin\' on, John, while you were amongst them Feejees."\r\n\r\nI endeavored to explain to him something of the nature and appearance of\r\nthe inhabitants of Tibet, but it made small impression. Uncle Jake\'s\r\nmind was so completely occupied by what was in it, that any outside fact\r\nor idea had small chance of entry.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve got wimmin votin\' now, I understand," he pursued; "I don\'t read\r\nthe papers much, they are so ungodly, but I\'ve heard that. And they\'ve\r\nbeen meddlin\' with Divine Providence in more ways than one--but I keep\r\nout of it, and so does Aunt Dorcas and the girl here."\r\n\r\nHe looked around at my Aunt, who smiled her gentle, faithful smile, and\r\nat Drusilla, who dropped her eyes and flushed faintly. I suspected her\r\nof secret leanings toward the movement of the world outside.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t allow my family off the farm," he went on, "except when we go\r\nto meetin\', and that\'s not often. There\'s hardly an orthodox preacher\r\nleft, seems to me; but we go up to the Ridge meetin\' house sometimes."\r\n\r\n"I should think you would find it a little dull--don\'t you?" I ventured.\r\n\r\nDrusilla flashed a grateful look at me.\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the sort," he answered. "I was born on this farm, and it\'s\r\nbig enough for anybody to be contented on. Your Aunt was born over in\r\nHadley Holler--and she\'s contented enough. As for Drusilly--" he looked\r\nat her again with real affection, "Drusilla\'s always been a good\r\ngirl--never made any trouble in her life. Unless \'twas when she pretty\r\nnear married that heretic minister--eh, Drusilly?"\r\n\r\nMy cousin did not respond warmly to this sally, but neither did she show\r\nsigns of grief. I was conscious of a faint satisfaction that she had not\r\nmarried the heretic minister.\r\n\r\nThey made me very welcome, so welcome indeed that as days passed, Uncle\r\nJake even broached the subject of my remaining there.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got no son," he said, "and a girl can\'t run the farm. You stay\r\nhere, John, and keep things goin\', and I\'ll will it to you--what do you\r\nsay? You ain\'t married, I see. Just get you a nice girl--if there\'s any\r\nleft, and settle down here."\r\n\r\nI thanked him warmly, but said I must have time to consider--that I had\r\nthought of accepting other work which offered.\r\n\r\nHe was most insistent about it. "You better stay here, John. Here\'s pure\r\nair and pure food--none of these artificial kickshaws I hear of folks\r\nhavin\' nowadays. We smoke our own hams just as we used to do in my\r\ngrandfather\'s time--there\'s none better. We buy sugar and rice and\r\ncoffee and such as that; but I grind my own corn in the little mill there\r\non the creek--reckon I\'m the only one who uses it now. And your Aunt\r\nruns her loom to this day. Drusilly can, too, but she \'lows she hates to\r\ndo it. Girls aren\'t what they used to be when I was young!"\r\n\r\nIt did not seem possible that Uncle Jake had ever been young. His\r\nsturdy, stooping frame, his hard, ruddy features were the same at\r\nseventy as I remembered them at forty, only the hair, whitened and\r\nthinned, was different.\r\n\r\nMy bedroom was exactly as when I last slept in it, on my one visit to\r\nthe farm as a boy of fifteen. Drusilla had seemed only a baby then--a\r\nslender little five-year old. She had followed me about in silence, with\r\nadoring eyes, and I had teased her!--I hated to think of how I had\r\nteased her.\r\n\r\nThe gold in her hair was all dulled and faded, the rose-leaf color of\r\nher cheeks had faded, too, and her blue eyes wore a look of weary\r\npatience. She worked hard. Her mother was evidently feeble now, and the\r\nlabor required in that primitive home was considerable.\r\n\r\nThe old negro brought water from the spring and milked the cows, but all\r\nthe care of the dairy, the cooking for the family, the knitting and\r\nsewing and mending and the sweeping, scrubbing and washing was in the\r\nhands of Aunt Dorcas and Drusilla.\r\n\r\nShe would make her mother sit down and chat with me, while Uncle Jake\r\nsmoked his cob pipe, but she herself seemed always at work.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no getting any help nowadays," said my Uncle. "Even if we\r\nneeded it. Old Joe there stayed on--he was here before I was born. Joe\r\nmust be eighty or over--there\'s no telling the age of niggers. But the\r\nyoung ones are too uppity for any use. They want to be paid out of all\r\nreason, and treated like white folks at that!"\r\n\r\nHe boasted that he had never worn a shirt or a pair of socks made off\r\nthe place. "In my father\'s time we raised a heap of cotton and sold it.\r\nPlenty of niggers then. Now I manage to get enough for my own use, and\r\nwe spin and weave it on the spot!"\r\n\r\nI watched Aunt Dorcas at her wheel and loom, and rubbed my eyes. It was\r\nonly in the remote mountain regions that these things were done when I\r\nwas young, and to see it now seemed utterly incredible. But Uncle Jake\r\nwas proud of it.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe there\'s another wheel agoin\' in the whole country," he\r\nsaid. "The mountains ain\'t what they used to be, John. They\'ve got the\r\ntrees all grafted up with new kinds of foolishness--nuts and fruit and\r\none thing\'n another--and unheard-of kinds of houses and schools, and\r\nplay-actin\' everywhere. I can\'t abide it."\r\n\r\nHe set his jaw firmly, making the stiff white beard stand out at a sharp\r\nangle. "The farm\'ll keep us for my time," he concluded; "but I should\r\nhate to have it all \'reformed\' and torn to pieces after I\'m gone." And\r\nhe looked meaningly at me.\r\n\r\nI lingered on, still enjoying the sense of family affection, but my\r\nsatisfaction in the things about me slowly cooling.\r\n\r\nA cotton quilt was heavier but not so warm as a woolen blanket. Homespun\r\nsheets were durable, doubtless, but not comfortable. The bathing to be\r\ndone in a small steep-sided china basin, with water poured from a\r\npitcher the outlines of which were more concave than convex, was\r\nlaborious and unsatisfying.\r\n\r\nThe relish of that "hog and hominy" and the beaten biscuit, the corn\r\npone, the molasses and pork gravy of my youth, wore off as the same\r\nviands reappeared on the table from day to day and week to week, and\r\nseemed ceaselessly present within me.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to listen to Aunt Dorcas\'s gentle reminiscences of the\r\npast years, of my father and mother in their youth, of my infancy, and\r\nDrusilla\'s. She grieved that she had not more to tell. "I never was one\r\nto visit much," she said.\r\n\r\nBut it was saddening to find that the dear old lady could talk of\r\nabsolutely nothing else. In all her sixty-eight years she had known\r\nnothing else; her father\'s home and her husband\'s, alike in their\r\ncontents and in their labors, her own domestic limitations, and those of\r\nher neighbors, and her church paper--taken for forty years, and\r\narbitrarily discontinued by Uncle Jake because it had grown too liberal.\r\n\r\n"It never seemed over-liberal to me," she said softly, "and I do miss\r\nit. I wouldn\'t a\'believed \'Id a\'missed anything so much. It used to come\r\nevery week, and I kept more acquainted with what the rest of this\r\ncircuit was doing. But your Uncle Jake is so set against liberalism!"\r\n\r\nI turned to my cousin for some wider exchange of thoughts, and strove\r\nwith all the remembered arts of my youth, and all the recently acquired\r\nwisdom of my present years, to win her confidence.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult at first. She was shy with the dumb shyness of an\r\nanimal; not like a wild animal, frankly curious, not like a hunted\r\nanimal, which runs away and hides, but like an animal in a menagerie, a\r\nsullen, hopeless timidity, due to long restriction. Life had slipped by\r\nher, all of it, as far as she knew. She had been an "old maid" for\r\ntwenty-five years--they call them that in these mountains if they are\r\nnot married at twenty. Her father\'s domineering ways had discouraged\r\nmost of the few young men she had known, and he had ruthlessly driven\r\naway the only one who came near enough to be dismissed.\r\n\r\nThen it was only the housework, and caring for her mother as she grew\r\nolder. The one pleasure of her own she ever had was in her flowers. She\r\nhad transplanted wild ones, had now and then been given "a slip" by\r\nremote neighbors--in past years; and those carefully nurtured blossoms\r\nwere all that brought color and sweetness into her gray life.\r\n\r\nShe did not complain. For a long time I could not get her to talk to me\r\nat all about herself, and when she did it was without hope or protest.\r\nShe had practically no education--only a few years in a country school\r\nin childhood, and almost no reading, writing, conversation, any sort of\r\nknowledge of the life of the world about her.\r\n\r\nAnd here she lived, meek, patient, helpless, with neither complaint nor\r\ndesire, endlessly working to make comfortable the parents who must some\r\nday leave her alone--to what?\r\n\r\nMy thirty years in Tibet seemed all at once a holiday compared to this\r\nthirty years on an upland farm in the Alleghanies of Carolina. My loss\r\nof life--what was it to this loss? I, at least, had never known it, not\r\nuntil I was found and brought back, and she had known it every day and\r\nnight for thirty years. I had come back at fifty-five, regaining a new\r\nyouth in a new world. She apparently had had no youth, and now was\r\nold--older at forty-five than women of fifty and sixty whom I had met\r\nand talked with recently.\r\n\r\nI thought of them, those busy, vigorous, eager, active women, of whom no\r\none would ever predicate either youth or age; they were just women,\r\npermanently, as men were men. I thought of their wide, free lives, their\r\nabsorbing work and many minor interests, and the big, smooth, beautiful,\r\nmoving world in which they lived, and my heart went out to Drusilla as\r\nto a baby in a well.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Drusilla," I said to her at last, "I want you to marry me.\r\nWe\'ll go away from here; you shall see something of life, my\r\ndear--there\'s lot of time yet."\r\n\r\nShe raised those quiet blue eyes and looked at me, a long, sweet,\r\nsearching look, and then shook her head with gentle finality. "O, no,"\r\nshe said. "Thank you, Cousin John, but I could not do that."\r\n\r\nAnd then, all at once I felt more lonely and out of life than when the\r\nfirst shock met me.\r\n\r\n"O, Drusilla!" I begged; "Do--do! Don\'t you see, if you won\'t have me\r\nnobody ever will? I am all alone in the world, Drusilla; the world has\r\nall gone away from me! You are the only woman alive who would\r\nunderstand. Dear cousin--dear little girl--you\'ll have to marry me--out\r\nof pity!"\r\n\r\nAnd she did.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNobody would know Drusilla now. She grew young at a rate that seemed a\r\nheavenly miracle. To her the world was like heaven, and, being an angel\r\nwas natural to her anyway.\r\n\r\nI grew to find the world like heaven, too--if only for what it did to\r\nDrusilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MOVING THE MOUNTAIN ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
