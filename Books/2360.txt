Till then I had\r\nonly known as much as the rest of his friends, namely, that he had\r\nrecently undergone experiences during a yachting cruise with a certain\r\nMr \xe2\x80\x9cDavies\xe2\x80\x9d which had left a deep mark on his character and habits.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his narrative\xe2\x80\x94which, from its bearing on studies and\r\nspeculations of my own, as well as from its intrinsic interest and racy\r\ndelivery, made a very deep impression on me\xe2\x80\x94he added that the important\r\nfacts discovered in the course of the cruise had, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelay, been communicated to the proper authorities, who, after some\r\ndignified incredulity, due in part, perhaps, to the pitiful inadequacy\r\nof their own secret service, had, he believed, made use of them, to\r\navert a great national danger. I say \xe2\x80\x9che believed\xe2\x80\x9d, for though it was\r\nbeyond question that the danger was averted for the time, it was\r\ndoubtful whether they had stirred a foot to combat it, the secret\r\ndiscovered being of such a nature that mere suspicion of it on this\r\nside was likely to destroy its efficacy.\r\n\r\nThere, however that may be, the matter rested for a while, as, for\r\npersonal reasons which will be manifest to the reader, he and Mr\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavies\xe2\x80\x9d expressly wished it to rest.\r\n\r\nBut events were driving them to reconsider their decision. These seemed\r\nto show that the information wrung with such peril and labour from the\r\nGerman Government, and transmitted so promptly to our own, had had none\r\nbut the most transitory influence on our policy. Forced to the\r\nconclusion that the national security was really being neglected, the\r\ntwo friends now had a mind to make their story public; and it was about\r\nthis that \xe2\x80\x9cCarruthers\xe2\x80\x9d wished for my advice. The great drawback was\r\nthat an Englishman, bearing an honoured name, was disgracefully\r\nimplicated, and that unless infinite delicacy were used, innocent\r\npersons, and, especially, a young lady, would suffer pain and\r\nindignity, if his identity were known. Indeed, troublesome rumours,\r\ncontaining a grain of truth and a mass of falsehood, were already\r\nafloat.\r\n\r\nAfter weighing both sides of the question, I gave my vote emphatically\r\nfor publication. The personal drawbacks could, I thought, with tact be\r\nneutralised; while, from the public point of view, nothing but good\r\ncould come from submitting the case to the common sense of the country\r\nat large. Publication, therefore, was agreed upon, and the next point\r\nwas the form it should take. \xe2\x80\x9cCarruthers\xe2\x80\x9d, with the concurrence of Mr\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavies\xe2\x80\x9d, was for a bald exposition of the essential facts, stripped of\r\ntheir warm human envelope. I was strongly against this course, first,\r\nbecause it would aggravate instead of allaying the rumours that were\r\ncurrent; secondly, because in such a form the narrative would not carry\r\nconviction, and would thus defeat its own end. The persons and the\r\nevents were indissolubly connected; to evade, abridge, suppress, would\r\nbe to convey to the reader the idea of a concocted hoax. Indeed, I took\r\nbolder ground still, urging that the story should be made as explicit\r\nand circumstantial as possible, frankly and honestly for the purpose of\r\nentertaining and so of attracting a wide circle of readers. Even\r\nanonymity was undesirable. Nevertheless, certain precautions were\r\nimperatively needed.\r\n\r\nTo cut the matter short, they asked for my assistance and received it\r\nat once. It was arranged that I should edit the book; that \xe2\x80\x9cCarruthers\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshould give me his diary and recount to me in fuller detail and from\r\nhis own point of view all the phases of the \xe2\x80\x9cquest\xe2\x80\x9d, as they used to\r\ncall it; that Mr \xe2\x80\x9cDavies\xe2\x80\x9d should meet me with his charts and maps and\r\ndo the same; and that the whole story should be written, as from the\r\nmouth of the former, with its humours and errors, its light and its\r\ndark side, just as it happened; with the following few limitations. The\r\nyear it belongs to is disguised; the names of persons are throughout\r\nfictitious; and, at my instance certain slight liberties have been\r\ntaken to conceal the identity of the English characters.\r\n\r\nRemember, also that these persons are living now in the midst of us,\r\nand if you find one topic touched on with a light and hesitating pen,\r\ndo not blame the Editor, who, whether they are known or not, would\r\nrather say too little than say a word that might savour of\r\nimpertinence.\r\n\r\nE. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March_, 1903\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maps and charts are based on British and German Admiralty charts,\r\nwith irrelevant details omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nThe Letter\r\n\r\n\r\nI have read of men who, when forced by their calling to live for long\r\nperiods in utter solitude\xe2\x80\x94save for a few black faces\xe2\x80\x94have made it a\r\nrule to dress regularly for dinner in order to maintain their\r\nself-respect and prevent a relapse into barbarism. It was in some such\r\nspirit, with an added touch of self-consciousness, that, at seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening of September 23 in a recent year, I was making\r\nmy evening toilet in my chambers in Pall Mall. I thought the date and\r\nthe place justified the parallel; to my advantage even; for the obscure\r\nBurmese administrator might well be a man of blunted sensibilities and\r\ncoarse fibre, and at least he is alone with nature, while I\xe2\x80\x94well, a\r\nyoung man of condition and fashion, who knows the right people, belongs\r\nto the right clubs, has a safe, possibly a brilliant, future in the\r\nForeign Office\xe2\x80\x94may be excused for a sense of complacent martyrdom,\r\nwhen, with his keen appreciation of the social calendar, he is doomed\r\nto the outer solitude of London in September. I say \xe2\x80\x9cmartyrdom\xe2\x80\x9d, but in\r\nfact the case was infinitely worse. For to feel oneself a martyr, as\r\neverybody knows, is a pleasurable thing, and the true tragedy of my\r\nposition was that I had passed that stage. I had enjoyed what sweets it\r\nhad to offer in ever dwindling degree since the middle of August, when\r\nties were still fresh and sympathy abundant. I had been conscious that\r\nI was missed at Morven Lodge party. Lady Ashleigh herself had said so\r\nin the kindest possible manner, when she wrote to acknowledge the\r\nletter in which I explained, with an effectively austere reserve of\r\nlanguage, that circumstances compelled me to remain at my office. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nknow how busy you must be just now\xe2\x80\x9d, she wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cand I do hope you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t overwork; we shall _all_ miss you very much.\xe2\x80\x9d Friend after friend\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgot away\xe2\x80\x9d to sport and fresh air, with promises to write and chaffing\r\ncondolences, and as each deserted the sinking ship, I took a grim\r\ndelight in my misery, positively almost enjoying the first week or two\r\nafter my world had been finally dissipated to the four bracing winds of\r\nheaven. I began to take a spurious interest in the remaining five\r\nmillions, and wrote several clever letters in a vein of cheap satire,\r\nindirectly suggesting the pathos of my position, but indicating that I\r\nwas broad-minded enough to find intellectual entertainment in the\r\nscenes, persons, and habits of London in the dead season. I even did\r\nrational things at the instigation of others. For, though I should have\r\nliked total isolation best, I, of course, found that there was a\r\nsediment of unfortunates like myself, who, unlike me, viewed the\r\nsituation in a most prosaic light. There were river excursions, and so\r\non, after office-hours; but I dislike the river at any time for its\r\nnoisy vulgarity, and most of all at this season. So I dropped out of\r\nthe fresh air brigade and declined H\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99s offer to share a riverside\r\ncottage and run up to town in the mornings. I did spend one or two\r\nweek-ends with the Catesbys in Kent; but I was not inconsolable when\r\nthey let their house and went abroad, for I found that such partial\r\ncompensations did not suit me. Neither did the taste for satirical\r\nobservation last. A passing thirst, which I dare say many have shared,\r\nfor adventures of the fascinating kind described in the _New Arabian\r\nNights_ led me on a few evenings into some shady haunts in Soho and\r\nfarther eastward; but was finally quenched one sultry Saturday night\r\nafter an hour\xe2\x80\x99s immersion in the reeking atmosphere of a low music-hall\r\nin Ratcliffe Highway, where I sat next a portly female who suffered\r\nfrom the heat, and at frequent intervals refreshed herself and an\r\ninfant from a bottle of tepid stout.\r\n\r\nBy the first week in September I had abandoned all palliatives, and had\r\nsettled into the dismal but dignified routine of office, club, and\r\nchambers. And now came the most cruel trial, for the hideous truth\r\ndawned on me that the world I found so indispensable could after all\r\ndispense with me. It was all very well for Lady Ashleigh to assure me\r\nthat I was deeply missed; but a letter from F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, who was one of the\r\nparty, written \xe2\x80\x9cin haste, just starting to shoot\xe2\x80\x9d, and coming as a\r\ntardy reply to one of my cleverest, made me aware that the house party\r\nhad suffered little from my absence, and that few sighs were wasted on\r\nme, even in the quarter which I had assumed to have been discreetly\r\nalluded to by the underlined _all_ in Lady Ashleigh\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall _all_\r\nmiss you\xe2\x80\x9d. A thrust which smarted more, if it bit less deeply, came\r\nfrom my cousin Nesta, who wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s horrid for you to have to be\r\nbaking in London now; but, after all, it must be a great pleasure to\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x9d (malicious little wretch!) \xe2\x80\x9cto have such interesting and important\r\nwork to do.\xe2\x80\x9d Here was a nemesis for an innocent illusion I had been\r\naccustomed to foster in the minds of my relations and acquaintances,\r\nespecially in the breasts of the trustful and admiring maidens whom I\r\nhad taken down to dinner in the last two seasons; a fiction which I had\r\nalmost reached the point of believing in myself. For the plain truth\r\nwas that my work was neither interesting nor important, and consisted\r\nchiefly at present in smoking cigarettes, in saying that Mr So-and-So\r\nwas away and would be back about October 1, in being absent for lunch\r\nfrom twelve till two, and in my spare moments making _pr\xc3\xa9cis_ of\xe2\x80\x94let us\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94the less confidential consular reports, and squeezing the results\r\ninto cast-iron schedules. The reason of my detention was not a cloud on\r\nthe international horizon\xe2\x80\x94though I may say in passing that there was\r\nsuch a cloud\xe2\x80\x94but a caprice on the part of a remote and mighty\r\npersonage, the effect of which, ramifying downwards, had dislocated the\r\ncarefully-laid holiday plans of the humble juniors, and in my own small\r\ncase had upset the arrangement between myself and K\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, who positively\r\nliked the dog-days in Whitehall.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing was needed to fill my cup of bitterness, and this it was\r\nthat specially occupied me as I dressed for dinner this evening. Two\r\ndays more in this dead and fermenting city and my slavery would be at\r\nan end. Yes, but\xe2\x80\x94irony of ironies!\xe2\x80\x94I had nowhere to go to! The Morven\r\nLodge party was breaking up. A dreadful rumour as to an engagement\r\nwhich had been one of its accursed fruits tormented me with the fresh\r\ncertainty that I had not been missed, and bred in me that most\r\ndesolating brand of cynicism which is produced by defeat through\r\ninsignificance. Invitations for a later date, which I had declined in\r\nJuly with a gratifying sense of being much in request, now rose up\r\nspectrally to taunt me. There was at least one which I could easily\r\nhave revived, but neither in this case nor in any other had there been\r\nany renewal of pressure, and there are moments when the difference\r\nbetween proposing oneself and surrendering as a prize to one of several\r\neagerly competing hostesses seems too crushing to be contemplated. My\r\nown people were at Aix for my father\xe2\x80\x99s gout; to join them was a\r\n_pis-aller_ whose banality was repellent. Besides, they would be\r\nleaving soon for our home in Yorkshire, and I was not a prophet in my\r\nown country. In short, I was at the extremity of depression.\r\n\r\nThe usual preliminary scuffle on the staircase prepared me for the\r\nknock and entry of Withers. (One of the things which had for some time\r\nceased to amuse me was the laxity of manners, proper to the season,\r\namong the servants of the big block of chambers where I lived.) Withers\r\ndemurely handed me a letter bearing a German postmark and marked\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUrgent\xe2\x80\x9d. I had just finished dressing, and was collecting my money and\r\ngloves. A momentary thrill of curiosity broke in upon my depression as\r\nI sat down to open it. A corner on the reverse of the envelope bore the\r\nblotted legend: \xe2\x80\x9cVery sorry, but there\xe2\x80\x99s one other thing\xe2\x80\x94a pair of\r\nrigging screws from Carey and Neilson\xe2\x80\x99s, size 1\xe2\x85\x9c, _galvanised_.\xe2\x80\x9d Here\r\nit is:\r\n\r\nYacht _Dulcibella_,\r\nFlensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, _Sept_. 21.\r\n\r\n_Dear Carruthers_,\xe2\x80\x94I daresay you\xe2\x80\x99ll be surprised at hearing from me, as\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s ages since we met. It is more than likely, too, that what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to suggest won\xe2\x80\x99t suit you, for I know nothing of your plans, and\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99re in town at all you\xe2\x80\x99re probably just getting into harness\r\nagain and can\xe2\x80\x99t get away. So I merely write on the offchance to ask if\r\nyou would care to come out here and join me in a little yachting, and,\r\nI hope, duck-shooting. I know you\xe2\x80\x99re keen on shooting, and I sort of\r\nremember that you have done some yachting too, though I rather forget\r\nabout that. This part of the Baltic\xe2\x80\x94the Schleswig fiords\xe2\x80\x94is a splendid\r\ncruising-ground\xe2\x80\x94A1 scenery\xe2\x80\x94and there ought to be plenty of duck about\r\nsoon, if it gets cold enough. I came out here _via_ Holland and the\r\nFrisian Islands, starting early in August. My pals have had to leave\r\nme, and I\xe2\x80\x99m badly in want of another, as I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lay up yet for\r\na bit. I needn\xe2\x80\x99t say how glad I should be if you could come. If you\r\ncan, send me a wire to the P.O. here. Flushing and on by Hamburg will\r\nbe your best route, I think. I\xe2\x80\x99m having a few repairs done here, and\r\nwill have them ready sharp by the time your train arrives. Bring your\r\ngun and a good lot of No. 4\xe2\x80\x99s; and would you mind calling at\r\nLancaster\xe2\x80\x99s and asking for mine, and bringing it too? Bring some\r\noilskins. Better get the eleven-shilling sort, jacket and trousers\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cyachting\xe2\x80\x9d brand; and if you paint bring your gear. I know you\r\nspeak German like a native, and that will be a great help. Forgive this\r\nhail of directions, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve a sort of feeling that I\xe2\x80\x99m in luck and\r\nthat you\xe2\x80\x99ll come. Anyway, I hope you and the F.O. both flourish.\r\nGood-bye.\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\n_Arthur H. Davies_.\r\n\r\nWould you mind bringing me out a _prismatic compass_, and a pound of\r\nRaven mixture?\r\n\r\nThis letter marked an epoch for me; but I little suspected the fact as\r\nI crumpled it into my pocket and started languidly on the _voie\r\ndouloureuse_ which I nightly followed to the club. In Pall Mall there\r\nwere no dignified greetings to be exchanged now with well-groomed\r\nacquaintances. The only people to be seen were some late stragglers\r\nfrom the park, with a perambulator and some hot and dusty children\r\nlagging fretfully behind; some rustic sightseers draining the last\r\ndregs of the daylight in an effort to make out from their guide-books\r\nwhich of these reverend piles was which; a policeman and a builder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncart. Of course the club was a strange one, both of my own being closed\r\nfor cleaning, a coincidence expressly planned by Providence for my\r\ninconvenience. The club which you are \xe2\x80\x9cpermitted to make use of\xe2\x80\x9d on\r\nthese occasions always irritates with its strangeness and discomfort.\r\nThe few occupants seem odd and oddly dressed, and you wonder how they\r\ngot there. The particular weekly that you want is not taken in; the\r\ndinner is execrable, and the ventilation a farce. All these evils\r\noppressed me to-night. And yet I was puzzled to find that somewhere\r\nwithin me there was a faint lightening of the spirits; causeless, as\r\nfar as I could discover. It could not be Davies\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Yachting in\r\nthe Baltic at the end of September! The very idea made one shudder.\r\nCowes, with a pleasant party and hotels handy, was all very well. An\r\nAugust cruise on a steam yacht in French waters or the Highlands was\r\nall very well; but what kind of a yacht was this? It must be of a\r\ncertain size to have got so far, but I thought I remembered enough of\r\nDavies\xe2\x80\x99s means to know that he had no money to waste on luxuries. That\r\nbrought me to the man himself. I had known him at Oxford\xe2\x80\x94not as one of\r\nmy immediate set; but we were a sociable college, and I had seen a good\r\ndeal of him, liking him for his physical energy combined with a certain\r\nsimplicity and modesty, though, indeed, he had nothing to be conceited\r\nabout; liked him, in fact, in the way that at that receptive period one\r\nlikes many men whom one never keeps up with later. We had both gone\r\ndown in the same year\xe2\x80\x94three years ago now. I had gone to France and\r\nGermany for two years to learn the languages; he had failed for the\r\nIndian Civil, and then had gone into a solicitor\xe2\x80\x99s office. I had only\r\nseen him since at rare intervals, though I admitted to myself that for\r\nhis part he had clung loyally to what ties of friendship there were\r\nbetween us. But the truth was that we had drifted apart from the nature\r\nof things. I had passed brilliantly into my profession, and on the few\r\noccasions I had met him since I made my triumphant _d\xc3\xa9but_ in society I\r\nhad found nothing left in common between us. He seemed to know none of\r\nmy friends, he dressed indifferently, and I thought him dull. I had\r\nalways connected him with boats and the sea, but never with yachting,\r\nin the sense that I understood it. In college days he had nearly\r\npersuaded me into sharing a squalid week in some open boat he had\r\npicked up, and was going to sail among some dreary mudflats somewhere\r\non the east coast. There was nothing else, and the funereal function of\r\ndinner drifted on. But I found myself remembering at the _entr\xc3\xa9e_ that\r\nI had recently heard, at second or third hand, of something else about\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94exactly what I could not recall. When I reached the savoury, I had\r\nconcluded, so far as I had centred my mind on it at all, that the whole\r\nthing was a culminating irony, as, indeed, was the savoury in its way.\r\nAfter the wreck of my pleasant plans and the fiasco of my martyrdom, to\r\nbe asked as consolation to spend October freezing in the Baltic with an\r\neccentric nonentity who bored me! Yet, as I smoked my cigar in the\r\nghastly splendour of the empty smoking-room, the subject came up again.\r\nWas there anything in it? There were certainly no alternatives at hand.\r\nAnd to bury myself in the Baltic at this unearthly time of year had at\r\nleast a smack of tragic thoroughness about it.\r\n\r\nI pulled out the letter again, and ran down its impulsive staccato\r\nsentences, affecting to ignore what a gust of fresh air, high spirits,\r\nand good fellowship this flimsy bit of paper wafted into the jaded\r\nclub-room. On reperusal, it was full of evil presage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA1 scenery\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nwhat of equinoctial storms and October fogs? Every sane yachtsman was\r\npaying off his crew now. \xe2\x80\x9cThere ought to be duck\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94vague, very vague.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it gets cold enough\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94cold and yachting seemed to be a gratuitously\r\nmonstrous union. His pals had left him; why? \xe2\x80\x9cNot the \xe2\x80\x98yachting\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbrand\xe2\x80\x9d; and why not? As to the size, comfort, and crew of the yacht\xe2\x80\x94all\r\ncheerfully ignored; so many maddening blanks. And, by the way, why in\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s name \xe2\x80\x9ca prismatic compass\xe2\x80\x9d? I fingered a few magazines, played\r\na game of fifty with a friendly old fogey, too importunate to be worth\r\nthe labour of resisting, and went back to my chambers to bed, ignorant\r\nthat a friendly Providence had come to my rescue; and, indeed, rather\r\nresenting any clumsy attempt at such friendliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nThe _Dulcibella_\r\n\r\n\r\nThat two days later I should be found pacing the deck of the Flushing\r\nsteamer with a ticket for Hamburg in my pocket may seem a strange\r\nresult, yet not so strange if you have divined my state of mind. You\r\nwill guess, at any rate, that I was armed with the conviction that I\r\nwas doing an act of obscure penance, rumours of which might call\r\nattention to my lot and perhaps awaken remorse in the right quarter,\r\nwhile it left me free to enjoy myself unobtrusively in the remote event\r\nof enjoyment being possible.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that, at breakfast on the morning after the arrival of the\r\nletter, I had still found that inexplicable lightening which I\r\nmentioned before, and strong enough to warrant a revival of the pros\r\nand cons. An important pro which I had not thought of before was that\r\nafter all it was a good-natured piece of unselfishness to join Davies;\r\nfor he had spoken of the want of a pal, and seemed honestly to be in\r\nneed of me. I almost clutched at this consideration. It was an\r\nadmirable excuse, when I reached my office that day, for a resigned\r\nstudy of the Continental Bradshaw, and an order to Carter to unroll a\r\ngreat creaking wall-map of Germany and find me Flensburg. The latter\r\nlabour I might have saved him, but it was good for Carter to have\r\nsomething to do; and his patient ignorance was amusing. With most of\r\nthe map and what it suggested I was tolerably familiar, for I had not\r\nwasted my year in Germany, whatever I had done or not done since. Its\r\npeople, history, progress, and future had interested me intensely, and\r\nI had still friends in Dresden and Berlin. Flensburg recalled the\r\nDanish war of \xe2\x80\x9964, and by the time Carter\xe2\x80\x99s researches had ended in\r\nsuccess I had forgotten the task set him, and was wondering whether the\r\nprospect of seeing something of that lovely region of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, _[See Map A]_ as I knew from hearsay that it was,\r\nwas at all to be set against such an uncomfortable way of seeing it,\r\nwith the season so late, the company so unattractive, and all the other\r\ndrawbacks which I counted and treasured as proofs of my desperate\r\ncondition, if I _were_ to go. It needed little to decide me, and I\r\nthink K\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99s arrival from Switzerland, offensively sunburnt, was the\r\nfinishing touch. His greeting was \xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Carruthers, you here? Thought\r\nyou had got away long ago. Lucky devil, though, to be going now, just\r\nin time for the best driving and the early pheasants. The heat\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nshocking out there. Carter, bring me a Bradshaw\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(an extraordinary\r\nbook, Bradshaw, turned to from habit, even when least wanted, as men\r\nfondle guns and rods in the close season).\r\n\r\nBy lunch-time the weight of indecision had been removed, and I found\r\nmyself entrusting Carter with a telegram to Davies, P.O., Flensburg.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks; expect me 9.34 p.m. 26th\xe2\x80\x9d; which produced, three hours later,\r\na reply: \xe2\x80\x9cDelighted; please bring a No. 3 Rippingille stove\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nperplexing and ominous direction, which somehow chilled me in spite of\r\nits subject matter.\r\n\r\nIndeed, my resolution was continually faltering. It faltered when I\r\nturned out my gun in the evening and thought of the grouse it ought to\r\nhave accounted for. It faltered again when I contemplated the\r\nmiscellaneous list of commissions, sown broadcast through Davies\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, to fulfil which seemed to make me a willing tool where my\r\nchosen _r\xc3\xb4le_ was that of an embittered exile, or at least a\r\ncondescending ally. However, I faced the commissions manfully, after\r\nleaving the office.\r\n\r\nAt Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s I inquired for his gun, was received coolly, and had to\r\npay a heavy bill, which it seemed to have incurred, before it was\r\nhanded over. Having ordered the gun and No. 4\xe2\x80\x99s to be sent to my\r\nchambers, I bought the Raven mixture with that peculiar sense of injury\r\nwhich the prospect of smuggling in another\xe2\x80\x99s behalf always entails; and\r\nwondered where in the world Carey and Neilson\xe2\x80\x99s was, a firm which\r\nDavies spoke of as though it were as well known as the Bank of England\r\nor the Stores, instead of specialising in \xe2\x80\x9crigging-screws\xe2\x80\x9d, whatever\r\nthey might be. They sounded important, though, and it would be only\r\npolite to unearth them. I connected them with the \xe2\x80\x9cfew repairs,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nawoke new misgivings. At the Stores I asked for a No. 3 Rippingille\r\nstove, and was confronted with a formidable and hideous piece of\r\nironmongery, which burned petroleum in two capacious tanks, horribly\r\nprophetic of a smell of warm oil. I paid for this miserably, convinced\r\nof its grim efficiency, but speculating as to the domestic conditions\r\nwhich caused it to be sent for as an afterthought by telegram. I also\r\nasked about rigging-screws in the yachting department, but learnt that\r\nthey were not kept in stock; that Carey and Neilson\xe2\x80\x99s would certainly\r\nhave them, and that their shop was in the Minories, in the far east,\r\nmeaning a journey nearly as long as to Flensburg, and twice as\r\ntiresome. They would be shut by the time I got there, so after this\r\nexhausting round of duty I went home in a cab, omitted dressing for\r\ndinner (an epoch in itself), ordered a chop up from the basement\r\nkitchen, and spent the rest of the evening packing and writing, with\r\nthe methodical gloom of a man setting his affairs in order for the last\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe last of those airless nights passed. The astonished Withers saw me\r\nbreakfasting at eight, and at 9.30 I was vacantly examining\r\nrigging-screws with what wits were left me after a sulphurous ride in\r\nthe underground to Aldgate. I laid great stress on the 3/8\xe2\x80\x99s, and the\r\ngalvanism, and took them on trust, ignorant as to their functions. For\r\nthe eleven-shilling oilskins I was referred to a villainous den in a\r\nback street, which the shopman said they always recommended, and where\r\na dirty and bejewelled Hebrew chaffered with me (beginning at 18_s_.)\r\nover two reeking orange slabs distantly resembling moieties of the\r\nhuman figure. Their odour made me close prematurely for 14_s_., and I\r\nhurried back (for I was due there at 11) to my office with my two\r\ndisreputable brown-paper parcels, one of which made itself so\r\nnoticeable in the close official air that Carter attentively asked if I\r\nwould like to have it sent to my chambers, and K\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 was inquisitive to\r\nbluntness about it and my movements. But I did not care to enlighten\r\nK\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, whose comments I knew would be provokingly envious or wounding to\r\nmy pride in some way.\r\n\r\nI remembered, later on, the prismatic compass, and wired to the\r\nMinories to have one sent at once, feeling rather relieved that I was\r\nnot present there to be cross-examined as to size and make. The reply\r\nwas, \xe2\x80\x9cNot stocked; try surveying-instrument maker\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a reply both\r\npuzzling and reassuring, for Davies\xe2\x80\x99s request for a compass had given\r\nme more uneasiness than anything, while, to find that what he wanted\r\nturned out to be a surveying-instrument, was a no less perplexing\r\ndiscovery. That day I made my last _pr\xc3\xa9cis_ and handed over my\r\nschedules\xe2\x80\x94Procrustean beds, where unwilling facts were stretched and\r\ntortured\xe2\x80\x94and said good-bye to my temporary chief, genial and lenient\r\nM\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, who wished me a jolly holiday with all sincerity.\r\n\r\nAt seven I was watching a cab packed with my personal luggage and the\r\ncollection of unwieldy and incongruous packages that my shopping had\r\ndrawn down on me. Two deviations after that wretched prismatic\r\ncompass\xe2\x80\x94which I obtained in the end secondhand, _faute de mieux_, near\r\nVictoria, at one of those showy shops which look like jewellers\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nare really pawnbrokers\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94nearly caused me to miss my train. But at 8.30\r\nI had shaken off the dust of London from my feet, and at 10.30 I was,\r\nas I have announced, pacing the deck of a Flushing steamer, adrift on\r\nthis fatuous holiday in the far Baltic.\r\n\r\nAn air from the west, cooled by a midday thunderstorm, followed the\r\nsteamer as she slid through the calm channels of the Thames estuary,\r\npassed the cordon of scintillating lightships that watch over the\r\nsea-roads to the imperial city like pickets round a sleeping army, and\r\nslipped out into the dark spaces of the North Sea. Stars were bright,\r\nsummer scents from the Kent cliffs mingled coyly with vulgar\r\nsteamer-smells; the summer weather held immutably. Nature, for her\r\npart, seemed resolved to be no party to my penance, but to be\r\nimperturbably bent on shedding mild ridicule over my wrongs. An\r\nirresistible sense of peace and detachment, combined with that\r\ndelicious physical awakening that pulses through the nerve-sick\r\ntownsman when city airs and bald routine are left behind him, combined\r\nto provide me, however thankless a subject, with a solid background of\r\nresignation. Stowing this safely away, I could calculate my intentions\r\nwith cold egotism. If the weather held I might pass a not intolerable\r\nfortnight with Davies. When it broke up, as it was sure to, I could\r\neasily excuse myself from the pursuit of the problematical ducks; the\r\nwintry logic of facts would, in any case, decide him to lay up his\r\nyacht, for he could scarcely think of sailing home at such a season. I\r\ncould then take a chance lying ready of spending a few weeks in Dresden\r\nor elsewhere. I settled this programme comfortably and then turned in.\r\n\r\nFrom Flushing eastward to Hamburg, then northward to Flensburg, I cut\r\nshort the next day\xe2\x80\x99s sultry story. Past dyke and windmill and still\r\ncanals, on to blazing stubbles and roaring towns; at the last, after\r\ndusk, through a quiet level region where the train pottered from one\r\nlazy little station to another, and at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock I found myself,\r\nstiff and stuffy, on the platform at Flensburg, exchanging greetings\r\nwith Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awfully good of you to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all; it\xe2\x80\x99s very good of you to ask me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were both of us ill at ease. Even in the dim gaslight he clashed on\r\nmy notions of a yachtsman\xe2\x80\x94no cool white ducks or neat blue serge; and\r\nwhere was the snowy crowned yachting cap, that precious charm that so\r\neasily converts a landsman into a dashing mariner? Conscious that this\r\nimpressive uniform, in high perfection, was lying ready in my\r\nportmanteau, I felt oddly guilty. He wore an old Norfolk jacket, muddy\r\nbrown shoes, grey flannel trousers (or had they been white?), and an\r\nordinary tweed cap. The hand he gave me was horny, and appeared to be\r\nstained with paint; the other one, which carried a parcel, had a\r\nbandage on it which would have borne renewal. There was an instant of\r\nmutual inspection. I thought he gave me a shy, hurried scrutiny as\r\nthough to test past conjectures, with something of anxiety in it, and\r\nperhaps (save the mark!) a tinge of admiration. The face was familiar,\r\nand yet not familiar; the pleasant blue eyes, open, clean-cut features,\r\nunintellectual forehead were the same; so were the brisk and impulsive\r\nmovements; there was some change; but the moment of awkward hesitation\r\nwas over and the light was bad; and, while strolling down the platform\r\nfor my luggage, we chatted with constraint about trivial things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly said, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m not fit to be\r\nseen; but it\xe2\x80\x99s so late it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been painting hard all\r\nday, and just got it finished. I only hope we shall have some wind\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s been hopelessly calm lately. I say, you\xe2\x80\x99ve brought a\r\ngood deal of stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, as my belongings began to collect.\r\n\r\nHere was a reward for my submissive exertions in the far east!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave me a good many commissions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean those things,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, absently. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks for\r\nbringing them, by the way. That\xe2\x80\x99s the stove, I suppose; cartridges,\r\nthis one, by the weight. You got the rigging-screws all right, I hope?\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re not really necessary, of course\xe2\x80\x9d (I nodded vacantly, and felt a\r\nlittle hurt); \xe2\x80\x9cbut they\xe2\x80\x99re simpler than lanyards, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nthem here. It\xe2\x80\x99s that portmanteau,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, slowly, measuring it with a\r\ndoubtful eye. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind! we\xe2\x80\x99ll try. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do with the\r\nGladstone only, I suppose? You see, the dinghy\xe2\x80\x94h\xe2\x80\x99m, and there\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nhatchway, too\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he was lost in thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nthere are no cabs; but it\xe2\x80\x99s quite near, and the porter\xe2\x80\x99ll help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSickening forebodings crept over me, while Davies shouldered my\r\nGladstone and clutched at the parcels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t your men here?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked confused. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, perhaps I ought to have told you, I\r\nnever have any paid hands; it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a small boat, you know\xe2\x80\x94I hope you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t expect luxury. I\xe2\x80\x99ve managed her single-handed for some time. A\r\nman would be no use, and a horrible nuisance.\xe2\x80\x9d He revealed these\r\nappalling truths with a cheerful assurance, which did nothing to hide a\r\nna\xc3\xafve apprehension of their effect on me. There was a check in our\r\nmobilisation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather late to go on board, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, in a wooden voice.\r\nSomeone was turning out the gaslights, and the porter yawned\r\nostentatiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99d rather sleep at an hotel to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nstrained pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course you can do that, if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, in\r\ntransparent distress of mind. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it seems hardly worth while to cart\r\nthis stuff all the way to an hotel (I believe they\xe2\x80\x99re all on the other\r\nside of the harbour), and back again to the boat to-morrow. She\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\ncomfortable, and you\xe2\x80\x99re sure to sleep well, as you\xe2\x80\x99re tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can leave the things here,\xe2\x80\x9d I argued feebly, \xe2\x80\x9cand walk over with my\r\nbag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shall have to go aboard anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined; \xe2\x80\x9cI _never_ sleep\r\non shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be clinging timidly, but desperately, to some diplomatic\r\nend. A stony despair was invading me and paralysing resistance. Better\r\nface the worst and be done with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, grimly.\r\n\r\nHeavily loaded, we stumbled over railway lines and rubble heaps, and\r\ncame on the harbour. Davies led the way to a stairway, whose weedy\r\nsteps disappeared below in gloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll get into the dinghy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, all briskness now, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pass\r\nthe things down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI descended gingerly, holding as a guide a sodden painter which ended\r\nin a small boat, and conscious that I was collecting slime on cuffs and\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold up!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Davies, cheerfully, as I sat down suddenly near the\r\nbottom, with one foot in the water.\r\n\r\nI climbed wretchedly into the dinghy and awaited events.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow float her up close under the quay wall, and make fast to the ring\r\ndown there,\xe2\x80\x9d came down from above, followed by the slack of the sodden\r\npainter, which knocked my cap off as it fell. \xe2\x80\x9cAll fast? Any knot\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndo,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard, as I grappled with this loathsome task, and then a big,\r\ndark object loomed overhead and was lowered into the dinghy. It was my\r\nportmanteau, and, placed athwart, exactly filled all the space\r\namidships. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes it fit?\xe2\x80\x9d was the anxious inquiry from aloft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautifully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScratching at the greasy wall to keep the dinghy close to it, I\r\nreceived in succession our stores, and stowed the cargo as best I\r\ncould, while the dinghy sank lower and lower in the water, and its\r\nprecarious superstructure grew higher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch!\xe2\x80\x9d was the final direction from above, and a damp soft parcel hit\r\nme in the chest. \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful of that, it\xe2\x80\x99s meat. Now back to the\r\nstairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI painfully acquiesced, and Davies appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a load, and she\xe2\x80\x99s rather deep; but I _think_ we shall\r\nmanage,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cYou sit right aft, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll row.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was too far gone for curiosity as to how this monstrous pyramid was\r\nto be rowed, or even for surmises as to its foundering by the way. I\r\ncrawled to my appointed seat, and Davies extricated the buried sculls\r\nby a series of tugs, which shook the whole structure, and made us roll\r\nalarmingly. How he stowed himself into rowing posture I have not the\r\nleast idea, but eventually we were moving sluggishly out into the open\r\nwater, his head just visible in the bows. We had started from what\r\nappeared to be the head of a narrow loch, and were leaving behind us\r\nthe lights of a big town. A long frontage of lamp-lit quays was on our\r\nleft, with here and there the vague hull of a steamer alongside. We\r\npassed the last of the lights and came out into a broader stretch of\r\nwater, when a light breeze was blowing and dark hills could be seen on\r\neither shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m lying a little way down the fiord, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate\r\nto be too near a town, and I found a carpenter handy here\xe2\x80\x94 There she\r\nis! I wonder how you\xe2\x80\x99ll like her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI roused myself. We were entering a little cove encircled by trees, and\r\napproaching a light which flickered in the rigging of a small vessel,\r\nwhose outline gradually defined itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep her off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, as we drew alongside.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he had jumped on deck, tied the painter, and was round at\r\nmy end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hand them up,\xe2\x80\x9d he ordered, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll take them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a laborious task, with the one relief that it was not far to\r\nhand them\xe2\x80\x94a doubtful compensation, for other reasons distantly shaping\r\nthemselves. When the stack was transferred to the deck I followed it,\r\ntripping over the flabby meat parcel, which was already showing ghastly\r\nsigns of disintegration under the dew. Hazily there floated through my\r\nmind my last embarkation on a yacht; my faultless attire, the trim gig\r\nand obsequious sailors, the accommodation ladder flashing with varnish\r\nand brass in the August sun; the orderly, snowy decks and basket chairs\r\nunder the awning aft. What a contrast with this sordid midnight\r\nscramble, over damp meat and littered packing-cases! The bitterest\r\ntouch of all was a growing sense of inferiority and ignorance which I\r\nhad never before been allowed to feel in my experience of yachts.\r\n\r\nDavies awoke from another reverie over my portmanteau to say, cheerily:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just show you round down below first, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll stow things\r\naway and get to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dived down a companion ladder, and I followed cautiously. A complex\r\nodour of paraffin, past cookery, tobacco, and tar saluted my nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind your head,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, striking a match and lighting a candle,\r\nwhile I groped into the cabin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better sit down; it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to\r\nlook round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere might well have been sarcasm in this piece of advice, for I must\r\nhave cut a ridiculous figure, peering awkwardly and suspiciously round,\r\nwith shoulders and head bent to avoid the ceiling, which seemed in the\r\nhalf-light to be even nearer the floor than it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d were Davies\xe2\x80\x99s reassuring words, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of room to\r\n_sit_ upright\xe2\x80\x9d (which was strictly true; but I am not very tall, and he\r\nis short). \xe2\x80\x9cSome people make a point of head-room, but I never mind\r\nmuch about it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the centreboard case,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, as, in\r\nstretching my legs out, my knee came into contact with a sharp edge.\r\n\r\nI had not seen this devilish obstruction, as it was hidden beneath the\r\ntable, which indeed rested on it at one end. It appeared to be a long,\r\nlow triangle, running lengthways with the boat and dividing the\r\nnaturally limited space into two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, she\xe2\x80\x99s a flat-bottomed boat, drawing very little water without\r\nthe plate; that\xe2\x80\x99s why there\xe2\x80\x99s so little headroom. For deep water you\r\nlower the plate; so, in one way or another, you can go practically\r\nanywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was not nautical enough to draw any very definite conclusions from\r\nthis, but what I did draw were not promising. The latter sentences were\r\nspoken from the forecastle, whither Davies had crept through a low\r\nsliding door, like that of a rabbit-hutch, and was already busy with a\r\nkettle over a stove which I made out to be a battered and disreputable\r\ntwin brother of the No. 3 Rippingille.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be boiling soon,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cand we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some grog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy eyes were used to the light now, and I took in the rest of my\r\nsurroundings, which may be very simply described. Two long\r\ncushion-covered seats flanked the cabin, bounded at the after end by\r\ncupboards, one of which was cut low to form a sort of miniature\r\nsideboard, with glasses hung in a rack above it. The deck overhead was\r\nvery low at each side but rose shoulder high for a space in the middle,\r\nwhere a \xe2\x80\x9ccoach-house roof\xe2\x80\x9d with a skylight gave additional cabin space.\r\nJust outside the door was a fold-up washing-stand. On either wall were\r\nlong net-racks holding a medley of flags, charts, caps, cigar-boxes,\r\nhanks of yarn, and such like. Across the forward bulkhead was a\r\nbookshelf crammed to overflowing with volumes of all sizes, many upside\r\ndown and some coverless. Below this were a pipe-rack, an aneroid, and a\r\nclock with a hearty tick. All the woodwork was painted white, and to a\r\nless jaundiced eye than mine the interior might have had an enticing\r\nlook of snugness. Some Kodak prints were nailed roughly on the after\r\nbulkhead, and just over the doorway was the photograph of a young girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, who had emerged and saw me looking at\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, let\xe2\x80\x99s get the stuff down.\xe2\x80\x9d He ran up the ladder, and soon my\r\nportmanteau blackened the hatchway, and a great straining and squeezing\r\nbegan. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid it was too big,\xe2\x80\x9d came down; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to unpack on deck\xe2\x80\x94we may be able to squash it down when it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nempty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the wearisome tail of packages began to form a fresh stack in the\r\ncramped space at my feet, and my back ached with stooping and moiling\r\nin unfamiliar places. Davies came down, and with unconcealed pride\r\nintroduced me to the sleeping cabin (he called the other one \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nsaloon\xe2\x80\x9d). Another candle was lit and showed two short and narrow berths\r\nwith blankets, but no sign of sheets; beneath these were drawers, one\r\nset of which Davies made me master of, evidently thinking them a\r\nprincely allowance of space for my wardrobe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can chuck your things down the skylight on to your berth as you\r\nunpack them,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I doubt if there\xe2\x80\x99s room for all\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got. I suppose you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d I said shortly.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of argument struck me; two men, doubled up like monkeys,\r\ncannot argue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll go out I shall be able to get out too,\xe2\x80\x9d I added. He seemed\r\nmiserable at this ghost of an altercation, but I pushed past, mounted\r\nthe ladder, and in the expiring moonlight unstrapped that accursed\r\nportmanteau and, brimming over with irritation, groped among its\r\ncontents, sorting some into the skylight with the same feeling that\r\nnothing mattered much now, and it was best to be done with it;\r\nrepacking the rest with guilty stealth ere Davies should discover their\r\ncharacter, and strapping up the whole again. Then I sat down upon my\r\nwhite elephant and shivered, for the chill of autumn was in the air. It\r\nsuddenly struck me that if it had been raining things might have been\r\nworse still. The notion made me look round. The little cove was still\r\nas glass; stars above and stars below; a few white cottages glimmering\r\nat one point on the shore; in the west the lights of Flensburg; to the\r\neast the fiord broadening into unknown gloom. From Davies toiling below\r\nthere were muffled sounds of wrenching, pushing, and hammering,\r\npunctuated occasionally by a heavy splash as something shot up from the\r\nhatchway and fell into the water.\r\n\r\nHow it came about I do not know. Whether it was something pathetic in\r\nthe look I had last seen on his face\xe2\x80\x94a look which I associated for no\r\nreason whatever with his bandaged hand; whether it was one of those\r\ninstants of clear vision in which our separate selves are seen divided,\r\nthe baser from the better, and I saw my silly egotism in contrast with\r\na simple generous nature; whether it was an impalpable air of mystery\r\nwhich pervaded the whole enterprise and refused to be dissipated by its\r\nmost mortifying and vulgarising incidents\xe2\x80\x94a mystery dimly connected\r\nwith my companion\xe2\x80\x99s obvious consciousness of having misled me into\r\njoining him; whether it was only the stars and the cool air rousing\r\natrophied instincts of youth and spirits; probably, indeed, it was all\r\nthese influences, cemented into strength by a ruthless sense of humour\r\nwhich whispered that I was in danger of making a mere commonplace fool\r\nof myself in spite of all my laboured calculations; but whatever it\r\nwas, in a flash my mood changed. The crown of martyrdom disappeared,\r\nthe wounded vanity healed; that precious fund of fictitious resignation\r\ndrained away, but left no void. There was left a fashionable and\r\ndishevelled young man sitting in the dew and in the dark on a\r\nridiculous portmanteau which dwarfed the yacht that was to carry it; a\r\nyouth acutely sensible of ignorance in a strange and strenuous\r\natmosphere; still feeling sore and victimised; but withal sanely\r\nashamed and sanely resolved to enjoy himself. I anticipate; for though\r\nthe change was radical its full growth was slow. But in any case it was\r\nhere and now that it took its birth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrog\xe2\x80\x99s ready!\xe2\x80\x9d came from below. Bunching myself for the descent I\r\nfound to my astonishment that all trace of litter had miraculously\r\nvanished, and a cosy neatness reigned. Glasses and lemons were on the\r\ntable, and a fragrant smell of punch had deadened previous odours. I\r\nshowed little emotion at these amenities, but enough to give intense\r\nrelief to Davies, who delightedly showed me his devices for storage,\r\npraising the \xe2\x80\x9croominess\xe2\x80\x9d of his floating den. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s your stove, you\r\nsee,\xe2\x80\x9d he ended; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve chucked the old one overboard.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a weakness\r\nof his, I should say here, to rejoice in throwing things overboard on\r\nthe flimsiest pretexts. I afterwards suspected that the new stove had\r\nnot been \xe2\x80\x9creally necessary\xe2\x80\x9d any more than the rigging-screws, but was\r\nan excuse for gratifying this curious taste.\r\n\r\nWe smoked and chatted for a little, and then came the problem of going\r\nto bed. After much bumping of knuckles and head, and many giddy\r\nwrithings, I mastered it, and lay between the rough blankets. Davies,\r\nmoving swiftly and deftly, was soon in his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite comfortable, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he blew out the light\r\nfrom where he lay, with an accuracy which must have been the fruit of\r\nlong practice.\r\n\r\nI felt prickly all over, and there was a damp patch on the pillow,\r\nwhich was soon explained by a heavy drop of moisture falling on my\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the deck\xe2\x80\x99s not leaking?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, as mildly as I could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, earnestly, tumbling out of his bunk.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be the heavy dew. I did a lot of caulking yesterday, but I\r\nsuppose I missed that place. I\xe2\x80\x99ll run up and square it with an\r\noilskin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, sleepily, on his return, for\r\ngratitude reminded me of that bandage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing much; I strained it the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply; and then\r\nthe seemingly inconsequent remark: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you brought that prismatic\r\ncompass. It\xe2\x80\x99s not really necessary, of course; but\xe2\x80\x9d (muffled by\r\nblankets) \xe2\x80\x9cit may come in useful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nDavies\r\n\r\n\r\nI dozed but fitfully, with a fretful sense of sore elbows and neck and\r\nmany a draughty hiatus among the blankets. It was broad daylight before\r\nI had reached the stage of torpor in which such slumber merges. That\r\nwas finally broken by the descent through the skylight of a torrent of\r\nwater. I started up, bumped my head hard against the decks, and blinked\r\nleaden-eyed upwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry! I\xe2\x80\x99m scrubbing decks. Come up and bathe. Slept well?\xe2\x80\x9d I heard a\r\nvoice saying from aloft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFairly well,\xe2\x80\x9d I growled, stepping out into a pool of water on the\r\noilcloth. Thence I stumbled up the ladder, dived overboard, and buried\r\nbad dreams, stiffness, frowsiness, and tormented nerves in the\r\nloveliest fiord of the lovely Baltic. A short and furious swim and I\r\nwas back again, searching for a means of ascent up the smooth black\r\nside, which, low as it was, was slippery and unsympathetic. Davies, in\r\na loose canvas shirt, with the sleeves tucked up, and flannels rolled\r\nup to the knee, hung over me with a rope\xe2\x80\x99s end, and chatted\r\nunconcernedly about the easiness of the job when you know how, adjuring\r\nme to mind the paint, and talking about an accommodation ladder he had\r\nonce had, but had thrown overboard because it was so horribly in the\r\nway. When I arrived, my knees and elbows were picked out in black\r\npaint, to his consternation. Nevertheless, as I plied the towel, I knew\r\nthat I had left in those limpid depths yet another crust of discontent\r\nand self-conceit.\r\n\r\nAs I dressed into flannels and blazer, I looked round the deck, and\r\nwith an unskilled and doubtful eye took in all that the darkness had\r\nhitherto hidden. She seemed very small (in point of fact she was seven\r\ntons), something over thirty feet in length and nine in beam, a size\r\nvery suitable to week-ends in the Solent, for such as liked that sort\r\nof thing; but that she should have come from Dover to the Baltic\r\nsuggested a world of physical endeavour of which I had never dreamed. I\r\npassed to the \xc3\xa6sthetic side. Smartness and beauty were essential to\r\nyachts, in my mind, but with the best resolves to be pleased I found\r\nlittle encouragement here. The hull seemed too low, and the mainmast\r\ntoo high; the cabin roof looked clumsy, and the skylights saddened the\r\neye with dull iron and plebeian graining. What brass there was, on the\r\ntiller-head and elsewhere, was tarnished with sickly green. The decks\r\nhad none of that creamy purity which Cowes expects, but were rough and\r\ngrey, and showed tarry exhalations round the seams and rusty stains\r\nnear the bows. The ropes and rigging were in mourning when contrasted\r\nwith the delicate buff manilla so satisfying to the artistic eye as\r\nseen against the blue of a June sky at Southsea. Nor was the whole\r\neffect bettered by many signs of recent refitting. An impression of\r\npaint, varnish, and carpentry was in the air; a gaudy new burgee\r\nfluttered aloft; there seemed to be a new rope or two, especially round\r\nthe diminutive mizzen-mast, which itself looked altogether new. But all\r\nthis only emphasised the general plainness, reminding one of a\r\nrespectable woman of the working-classes trying to dress above her\r\nstation, and soon likely to give it up.\r\n\r\nThat the _ensemble_ was businesslike and solid even my untrained eye\r\ncould see. Many of the deck fittings seemed disproportionately\r\nsubstantial. The anchor-chain looked contemptuous of its charge; the\r\nbinnacle with its compass was of a size and prominence almost comically\r\nimpressive, and was, moreover the only piece of brass which was\r\nburnished and showed traces of reverent care. Two huge coils of stout\r\nand dingy warp lay just abaft the mainmast, and summed up the\r\nweather-beaten aspect of the little ship. I should add here that in the\r\ndistant past she had been a lifeboat, and had been clumsily converted\r\ninto a yacht by the addition of a counter, deck, and the necessary\r\nspars. She was built, as all lifeboats are, diagonally, of two skins of\r\nteak, and thus had immense strength, though, in the matter of looks,\r\nall a hybrid\xe2\x80\x99s failings.\r\n\r\nHunger and \xe2\x80\x9cTea\xe2\x80\x99s made!\xe2\x80\x9d from below brought me down to the cabin, where\r\nI found breakfast laid out on the table over the centreboard case, with\r\nDavies earnestly presiding, rather flushed as to the face, and sooty as\r\nto the fingers. There was a slight shortage of plate and crockery, but\r\nI praised the bacon and could do so truthfully, for its crisp and\r\nsteaming shavings would have put to shame the efforts of my London\r\ncook. Indeed, I should have enjoyed the meal heartily were it not for\r\nthe lowness of the sofa and table, causing a curvature of the body\r\nwhich made swallowing a more lengthy process than usual, and induced a\r\nperiodical yearning to get up and stretch\xe2\x80\x94a relief which spelt disaster\r\nto the skull. I noticed, too, that Davies spoke with a zest, sinister\r\nto me, of the delights of white bread and fresh milk, which he seemed\r\nto consider unusual luxuries, though suitable to an inaugural banquet\r\nin honour of a fastidious stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t be always going on\r\nshore,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when I showed a discreet interest in these things. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlived for ten days on a big rye loaf over in the Frisian Islands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it died hard, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery hard, but\xe2\x80\x9d (gravely) \xe2\x80\x9cquite good. After that I taught myself to\r\nmake rolls; had no baking powder at first, so used Eno\xe2\x80\x99s fruit salt,\r\nbut they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rise much with that. As for milk, condensed is\xe2\x80\x94I hope\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI changed the subject, and asked about his plans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get under way at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand sail down the fiord.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ntried for something more specific, but he was gone, and his voice\r\ndrowned in the fo\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99sle by the clatter and swish of washing up.\r\nThenceforward events moved with bewildering rapidity. Humbly desirous\r\nof being useful I joined him on deck, only to find that he scarcely\r\nnoticed me, save as a new and unexpected obstacle in his round of\r\nactivity. He was everywhere at once\xe2\x80\x94heaving in chain, hooking on\r\nhalyards, hauling ropes; while my part became that of the clown who\r\ndoes things after they are already done, for my knowledge of a yacht\r\nwas of that floating and inaccurate kind which is useless in practice.\r\nSoon the anchor was up (a great rusty monster it was!), the sails set,\r\nand Davies was darting swiftly to and fro between the tiller and\r\njib-sheets, while the _Dulcibella_ bowed a lingering farewell to the\r\nshore and headed for the open fiord. Erratic puffs from the high land\r\nbehind made her progress timorous at first, but soon the fairway was\r\nreached and a true breeze from Flensburg and the west took her in its\r\nfriendly grip. Steadily she rustled down the calm blue highway whose\r\nsoft beauty was the introduction to a passage in my life, short, but\r\npregnant with moulding force, through stress and strain, for me and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nDavies was gradually resuming his natural self, with abstracted\r\nintervals, in which he lashed the helm to finger a distant rope, with\r\nsuch speed that the movements seemed simultaneous. Once he vanished,\r\nonly to reappear in an instant with a chart, which he studied, while\r\nsteering, with a success that its reluctant folds seemed to render\r\nimpossible. Waiting respectfully for his revival I had full time to\r\nlook about. The fiord here was about a mile broad. From the shore we\r\nhad left the hills rose steeply, but with no rugged grandeur; the\r\noutlines were soft; there were green spaces and rich woods on the lower\r\nslopes; a little white town was opening up in one place, and scattered\r\nfarms dotted the prospect. The other shore, which I could just see,\r\nframed between the gunwale and the mainsail, as I sat leaning against\r\nthe hatchway, and sadly missing a deck-chair, was lower and lonelier,\r\nthough prosperous and pleasing to the eye. Spacious pastures led up by\r\nslow degrees to ordered clusters of wood, which hinted at the presence\r\nof some great manor house. Behind us, Flensburg was settling into haze.\r\nAhead, the scene was shut in by the contours of hills, some clear, some\r\ndreamy and distant. Lastly, a single glimpse of water shining between\r\nthe folds of hill far away hinted at spaces of distant sea of which\r\nthis was but a secluded inlet. Everywhere was that peculiar charm\r\nengendered by the association of quiet pastoral country and a homely\r\nhuman atmosphere with a branch of the great ocean that bathes all the\r\nshores of our globe.\r\n\r\nThere was another charm in the scene, due to the way in which I was\r\nviewing it\xe2\x80\x94not as a pampered passenger on a \xe2\x80\x9cfine steam yacht\xe2\x80\x9d, or even\r\non \xe2\x80\x9ca powerful modern schooner\xe2\x80\x9d, as the yacht agents advertise, but\r\nfrom the deck of a scrubby little craft of doubtful build and\r\ndistressing plainness, which yet had smelt her persistent way to this\r\ndistant fiord through I knew not what of difficulty and danger, with no\r\napparent motive in her single occupant, who talked as vaguely and\r\nunconcernedly about his adventurous cruise as though it were all a\r\nprotracted afternoon on Southampton Water.\r\n\r\nI glanced round at Davies. He had dropped the chart and was sitting, or\r\nrather half lying, on the deck with one bronzed arm over the tiller,\r\ngazing fixedly ahead, with just an occasional glance around and aloft.\r\nHe still seemed absorbed in himself, and for a moment or two I studied\r\nhis face with an attention I had never, since I had known him, given\r\nit. I had always thought it commonplace, as I had thought him\r\ncommonplace, so far as I had thought at all about either. It had always\r\nrather irritated me by an excess of candour and boyishness. These\r\nqualities it had kept, but the scales were falling from my eyes, and I\r\nsaw others. I saw strength to obstinacy and courage to recklessness, in\r\nthe firm lines of the chin; an older and deeper look in the eyes. Those\r\nodd transitions from bright mobility to detached earnestness, which had\r\npartly amused and chiefly annoyed me hitherto, seemed now to be lost in\r\na sensitive reserve, not cold or egotistic, but strangely winning from\r\nits paradoxical frankness. Sincerity was stamped on every lineament. A\r\ndeep misgiving stirred me that, clever as I thought myself, nicely\r\nperceptive of the right and congenial men to know, I had made some big\r\nmistakes\xe2\x80\x94how many, I wondered? A relief, scarcely less deep because it\r\nwas unconfessed, stole in on me with the suspicion that, little as I\r\ndeserved it, the patient fates were offering me a golden chance of\r\nrepairing at least one. And yet, I mused, the patient fates have\r\ncrooked methods, besides a certain mischievous humour, for it was\r\nDavies who had asked me out\xe2\x80\x94though now he scarcely seemed to need\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94almost tricked me into coming out, for he might have known I was not\r\nsuited to such a life; yet trickery and Davies sounded an odd\r\nconjuncture.\r\n\r\nProbably it was the growing discomfort of my attitude which produced\r\nthis backsliding. My night\xe2\x80\x99s rest and the \xe2\x80\x9cascent from the bath\xe2\x80\x9d had,\r\nin fact, done little to prepare me for contact with sharp edges and\r\nhard surfaces. But Davies had suddenly come to himself, and with an \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsay, are you comfortable? Have something to sit on?\xe2\x80\x9d jerked the helm a\r\nlittle to windward, felt it like a pulse for a moment, with a rapid\r\nlook to windward, and dived below, whence he returned with a couple of\r\ncushions, which he threw to me. I felt perversely resentful of these\r\nluxuries, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I be of any use?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t you bother,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect you\xe2\x80\x99re tired. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t we\r\nhaving a splendid sail? That must be Ekken on the port bow,\xe2\x80\x9d peering\r\nunder the sail, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the trees run in. I say, do you mind looking at\r\nthe chart?\xe2\x80\x9d He tossed it over to me. I spread it out painfully, for it\r\ncurled up like a watch-spring at the least slackening of pressure. I\r\nwas not familiar with charts, and this sudden trust reposed in me,\r\nafter a good deal of neglect, made me nervous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see Flensburg, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where we are,\xe2\x80\x9d dabbing\r\nwith a long reach at an indefinite space on the crowded sheet. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nwhich side of that buoy off the point do we pass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had scarcely taken in which was land and which was water, much less\r\nthe significance of the buoy, when he resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure it\xe2\x80\x99s all deep water about here. I expect\r\nthat marks the fairway for steamers.\r\n\r\nIn a minute or two we were passing the buoy in question, on the wrong\r\nside I am pretty certain, for weeds and sand came suddenly into view\r\nbelow us with uncomfortable distinctness. But all Davies said was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s never any sea here, and the plate\xe2\x80\x99s not down,\xe2\x80\x9d a dark\r\nutterance which I pondered doubtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best of these Schleswig\r\nwaters,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis that a boat of this size can go almost\r\nanywhere. There\xe2\x80\x99s no navigation required. Why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d At this moment a faint\r\nscraping was felt, rather than heard, beneath us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t we aground?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked with great calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she\xe2\x80\x99ll blow over,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, wincing a little.\r\n\r\nShe \xe2\x80\x9cblew over\xe2\x80\x9d, but the episode caused a little na\xc3\xafve vexation in\r\nDavies. I relate it as a good instance of one of his minor\r\npeculiarities. He was utterly without that didactic pedantry which\r\nyachting has a fatal tendency to engender in men who profess it. He had\r\ntossed me the chart without a thought that I was an ignoramus, to whom\r\nit would be Greek, and who would provide him with an admirable subject\r\nto drill and lecture, just as his neglect of me throughout the morning\r\nhad been merely habitual and unconscious independence. In the second\r\nplace, master of his _m\xc3\xa9tier_, as I knew him afterwards to be,\r\nresourceful, skilful, and alert, he was liable to lapse into a certain\r\namateurish vagueness, half irritating and half amusing. I think truly\r\nthat both these peculiarities came from the same source, a hatred of\r\nany sort of affectation. To the same source I traced the fact that he\r\nand his yacht observed none of the superficial etiquette of yachts and\r\nyachtsmen, that she never, for instance, flew a national ensign, and he\r\nnever wore a \xe2\x80\x9cyachting suit\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nWe rounded a low green point which I had scarcely noticed before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must jibe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies: \xe2\x80\x9cjust take the helm, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d and,\r\nwithout waiting for my co-operation, he began hauling in the mainsheet\r\nwith great vigour. I had rude notions of steering, but jibing is a\r\ndelicate operation. No yachtsman will be surprised to hear that the\r\nboom saw its opportunity and swung over with a mighty crash, with the\r\nmainsheet entangled round me and the tiller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJibed all standing,\xe2\x80\x9d was his sorrowful comment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not used to\r\nher yet. She\xe2\x80\x99s very quick on the helm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I to steer for?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, wildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take her now,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\nI felt it was time to make my position clear. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an utter duffer at\r\nsailing,\xe2\x80\x9d I began. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot to teach me, or one of these days\r\nI shall be wrecking you. You see, there\xe2\x80\x99s always been a crew\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrew!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with sovereign contempt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy, the whole fun of the thing is to\r\ndo everything oneself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt in the way the whole morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry!\xe2\x80\x9d His dismay and repentance were comical. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust the other way; you may be all the use in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d He became\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nWe were following the inward trend of a small bay towards a cleft in\r\nthe low shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Ekken Sound,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s look into it,\xe2\x80\x9d and a minute\r\nor two later we were drifting through a dainty little strait, with a\r\npeep of open water at the end of it. Cottages bordered either side,\r\nsome overhanging the very water, some connecting with it by a rickety\r\nwooden staircase or a miniature landing-stage. Creepers and roses\r\nrioted over the walls and tiny porches. For a space on one side, a rude\r\nquay, with small smacks floating off it, spoke of some minute\r\ncommercial interests; a very small tea-garden, with neglected-looking\r\nbowers and leaf-strewn tables, hinted at some equally minute tripping\r\ninterest. A pervading hue of mingled bronze and rose came partly from\r\nthe weather-mellowed woodwork of the cottages and stages, and partly\r\nfrom the creepers and the trees behind, where autumn\xe2\x80\x99s subtle fingers\r\nwere already at work. Down this exquisite sea-lane we glided till it\r\nended in a broad mere, where our sails, which had been shivering and\r\ncomplaining, filled into contented silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReady about!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, callously. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must get out of this again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd round we swung.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not anchor and stop here?\xe2\x80\x9d I protested; for a view of tantalising\r\nloveliness was unfolding itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all there is to be seen, and we must take this breeze\r\nwhile we\xe2\x80\x99ve got it.\xe2\x80\x9d It was always torture to Davies to feel a good\r\nbreeze running to waste while he was inactive at anchor or on shore.\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cshore\xe2\x80\x9d to him was an inferior element, merely serving as a useful\r\nannexe to the water\xe2\x80\x94a source of necessary supplies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, as we resumed our way down the fiord. A\r\nvision of iced drinks, tempting salads, white napery, and an attentive\r\nsteward mocked me with past recollections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find a tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice of doom, \xe2\x80\x9cin the starboard\r\nsofa-locker; beer under the floor in the bilge. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see her round that\r\nbuoy, if you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d I obeyed with a bad grace, but\r\nthe close air and cramped posture must have benumbed my faculties, for\r\nI opened the port-side locker, reached down, and grasped a sticky body,\r\nwhich turned out to be a pot of varnish. Recoiling wretchedly, I tried\r\nthe opposite one, combating the embarrassing heel of the boat and the\r\nobstructive edges of the centreboard case. A medley of damp tins of\r\nvaried sizes showed in the gloom, exuding a mouldy odour. Faded legends\r\non dissolving paper, like the remnants of old posters on a disused\r\nhoarding, spoke of soups, curries, beefs, potted meats, and other\r\nhidden delicacies. I picked out a tongue, re-imprisoned the odour, and\r\nexplored for beer. It was true, I supposed, that bilge didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt it,\r\nas I tugged at the plank on my hands and knees, but I should have\r\nmyself preferred a more accessible and less humid wine-cellar than the\r\ncavities among slimy ballast from which I dug the bottles. I regarded\r\nmy hard-won and ill-favoured pledges of a meal with giddiness and\r\ndiscouragement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you getting on?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cthe tin-opener\xe2\x80\x99s hanging up\r\non the bulkhead; the plates and knives are in the cupboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI doggedly pursued my functions. The plates and knives met me half-way,\r\nfor, being on the weather side, and thus having a downward slant, its\r\ncontents, when I slipped the latch, slid affectionately into my bosom,\r\nand overflowed with a clatter and jingle on to the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat often happens,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard from above. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind! There are no\r\nbreakables. I\xe2\x80\x99m coming down to help.\xe2\x80\x9d And down he came, leaving the\r\n_Dulcibella_ to her own devices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on deck,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy in the world couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you lunch\r\ncomfortably at Ekken and save this infernal pandemonium of a picnic?\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the yacht going to meanwhile? And how are we to lunch on that\r\nslanting table? I\xe2\x80\x99m covered with varnish and mud, and ankle-deep in\r\ncrockery. There goes the beer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have stood it on the table with this list on,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDavies, with intense composure, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it won\xe2\x80\x99t do any harm; it\xe2\x80\x99ll drain\r\ninto the bilge\xe2\x80\x9d (ashes to ashes, dust to dust, I thought). \xe2\x80\x9cYou go on\r\ndeck now, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll finish getting ready.\xe2\x80\x9d I regretted my explosion,\r\nthough wrung from me under great provocation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep her straight on as she\xe2\x80\x99s going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, as I clambered up\r\nout of the chaos, brushing the dust off my trousers and varnishing the\r\nladder with my hands. I unlashed the helm and kept her as she was\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nWe had rounded a sharp bend in the fiord, and were sailing up a broad\r\nand straight reach which every moment disclosed new beauties, sights\r\nfair enough to be balm to the angriest spirit. A red-roofed hamlet was\r\non our left, on the right an ivied ruin, close to the water, where some\r\ncontemplative cattle stood knee-deep. The view ahead was a white strand\r\nwhich fringed both shores, and to it fell wooded slopes, interrupted\r\nhere and there by low sandstone cliffs of warm red colouring, and now\r\nand again by a dingle with cracks of greensward.\r\n\r\nI forgot petty squalors and enjoyed things\xe2\x80\x94the coy tremble of the\r\ntiller and the backwash of air from the dingy mainsail, and, with a\r\nsomewhat chastened rapture, the lunch which Davies brought up to me and\r\nsolicitously watched me eat.\r\n\r\nLater, as the wind sank to lazy airs, he became busy with a larger\r\ntopsail and jib; but I was content to doze away the afternoon,\r\ndrenching brain and body in the sweet and novel foreign atmosphere, and\r\ndreamily watching the fringe of glen cliff and cool white sand as they\r\npassed ever more slowly by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nRetrospect\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWake up!\xe2\x80\x9d I rubbed my eyes and wondered where I was; stretched myself\r\npainfully, too, for even the cushions had not given me a true bed of\r\nroses. It was dusk, and the yacht was stationary in glassy water,\r\ncoloured by the last after-glow. A roofing of thin upper-cloud had\r\nspread over most of the sky, and a subtle smell of rain was in the air.\r\nWe seemed to be in the middle of the fiord, whose shores looked distant\r\nand steep in the gathering darkness. Close ahead they faded away\r\nsuddenly, and the sight lost itself in a grey void. The stillness was\r\nabsolute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t get to Sonderburg to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done then?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, collecting my senses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! we\xe2\x80\x99ll anchor anywhere here, we\xe2\x80\x99re just at the mouth of the fiord;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tow her inshore if you\xe2\x80\x99ll steer in that direction.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed\r\nvaguely at a blur of trees and cliff. Then he jumped into the dinghy,\r\ncast off the painter, and, after snatching at the slack of a rope,\r\nbegan towing the reluctant yacht by short jerks of the sculls. The\r\nmenacing aspect of that grey void, combined with a natural preference\r\nfor getting to some definite place at night, combined to depress my\r\nspirits afresh. In my sleep I had dreamt of Morven Lodge, of heather\r\ntea-parties after glorious slaughters of grouse, of salmon leaping in\r\namber pools\xe2\x80\x94and now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust take a cast of the lead, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d came Davies\xe2\x80\x99s voice above the\r\nsplash of the sculls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re close enough now; let\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Can you manage to let go the\r\nanchor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hurried forward and picked impotently at the bonds of the sleeping\r\nmonster. But Davies was aboard again, and stirred him with a deft touch\r\nor two, till he crashed into the water with a grinding of chain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall do well here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this rather an open anchorage?\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only open from that quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it comes on to blow\r\nfrom there we shall have to clear out; but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s only rain.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s stow the sails.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother whirlwind of activity, in which I joined as effectively as I\r\ncould, oppressed by the prospect of having to \xe2\x80\x9cclear out\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94who knows\r\nwhither?\xe2\x80\x94at midnight. But Davies\xe2\x80\x99s _sang froid_ was infectious, I\r\nsuppose, and the little den below, bright-lit and soon fragrant with\r\ncookery, pleaded insistently for affection. Yachting in this singular\r\nstyle was hungry work, I found. Steak tastes none the worse for having\r\nbeen wrapped in newspaper, and the slight traces of the day\xe2\x80\x99s news\r\ndisappear with frying in onions and potato-chips. Davies was indeed on\r\nhis mettle for this, his first dinner to his guest; for he produced\r\nwith stealthy pride, not from the dishonoured grave of the beer, but\r\nfrom some more hallowed recess, a bottle of German champagne, from\r\nwhich we drank success to the _Dulcibella_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would tell me all about your cruise from England,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have had some exciting adventures. Here are the charts; let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngo over them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must wash up first,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, and I was tactfully introduced to\r\none of his very few \xe2\x80\x9cstanding orders\xe2\x80\x9d, that tobacco should not burn,\r\nnor post-prandial chat begin, until that distasteful process had ended.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would never get done otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d he sagely opined. But when we were\r\nfinally settled with cigars, a variety of which, culled from many\r\nports\xe2\x80\x94German, Dutch, and Belgian\xe2\x80\x94Davies kept in a battered old box in\r\nthe net-rack, the promised talk hung fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no good at description,\xe2\x80\x9d he complained; \xe2\x80\x9cand there\xe2\x80\x99s really very\r\nlittle to tell. We left Dover\xe2\x80\x94Morrison and I\xe2\x80\x94on the 6th of August; made\r\na good passage to Ostend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had some fun there, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d I put in, thinking of\xe2\x80\x94well, of\r\nOstend in August.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFun! A filthy hole I call it; we had to stop a couple of days, as we\r\nfouled a buoy coming in and carried away the bobstay; we lay in a dirty\r\nlittle tidal dock, and there was nothing to do on shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a splendid sail to the East Scheldt, but then, like fools,\r\ndecided to go through Holland by canal and river. It was good fun\r\nenough navigating the estuary\xe2\x80\x94the tides and banks there are\r\nappalling\xe2\x80\x94but farther inland it was a wretched business, nothing but\r\npaying lock-dues, bumping against schuyts, and towing down stinking\r\ncanals. Never a peaceful night like this\xe2\x80\x94always moored by some quay or\r\ntow-path, with people passing and boys. Heavens! shall I ever forget\r\nthose boys! A perfect murrain of them infests Holland; they seem to\r\nhave nothing in the world to do but throw stones and mud at foreign\r\nyachts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want a Herod, with some statesmanlike views on infanticide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! yes; but the fact is that you want a crew for that pottering\r\ninland work; they can smack the boys and keep an eye on the sculls. A\r\nboat like this should stick to the sea, or out-of-the-way places on the\r\ncoast. Well, after Amsterdam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve skipped a good deal, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! have I? Well, let me see, we went by Dordrecht to Rotterdam;\r\nnothing to see there, and swarms of tugs buzzing about and shaving\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s bows every second. On by the Vecht river to Amsterdam, and\r\nthence\xe2\x80\x94Lord, what a relief it was!\xe2\x80\x94out into the North Sea again. The\r\nweather had been still and steamy; but it broke up finely now, and we\r\nhad a rattling three-reef sail to the Zuyder Zee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reached up to the bookshelf for what looked like an ancient ledger,\r\nand turned over the leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your log?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to have a look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you\xe2\x80\x99d find it dull reading\xe2\x80\x94if you could read it at all; it\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nshort notes about winds and bearings, and so on.\xe2\x80\x9d He was turning some\r\nleaves over rapidly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you keep a log of what we do? I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t describe things, and you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve half a mind to try,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want another chart now,\xe2\x80\x9d and he pulled down a second yet more\r\nstained and frayed than the first. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a splendid time then\r\nexploring the Zuyder Zee, its northern part at least, and round those\r\nislands which bound it on the north. Those are the Frisian Islands, and\r\nthey stretch for 120 miles or so eastward. You see, the first two of\r\nthem, Texel and Vlieland, shut in the Zuyder Zee, and the rest border\r\nthe Dutch and German coasts.\xe2\x80\x9d _[See Map A]_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, running my finger over some dotted patches\r\nwhich covered much of the chart. The latter was becoming\r\nunintelligible; clean-cut coasts and neat regiments of little figures\r\nhad given place to a confusion of winding and intersecting lines and\r\nbald spaces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll _sand_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, enthusiastically. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t think what a\r\nsplendid sailing-ground it is. You can explore for days without seeing\r\na soul. These are the channels, you see; they\xe2\x80\x99re very badly charted.\r\nThis chart was almost useless, but it made it all the more fun. No\r\ntowns or harbours, just a village or two on the islands, if you wanted\r\nstores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey look rather desolate,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDesolate\xe2\x80\x99s no word for it; they\xe2\x80\x99re really only gigantic sandbanks\r\nthemselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t all this rather dangerous?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit; you see, that\xe2\x80\x99s where our shallow draught and flat bottom\r\ncame in\xe2\x80\x94we could go anywhere, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter running\r\naground\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s perfect for that sort of work; and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really\r\n_look_ bad either, does she?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, rather wistfully. I suppose I\r\nhesitated, for he said, abruptly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, I don\xe2\x80\x99t go in for looks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had leaned back, and I detected traces of incipient\r\nabsentmindedness. His cigar, which he had lately been lighting and\r\nrelighting feverishly\xe2\x80\x94a habit of his when excited\xe2\x80\x94seemed now to have\r\nexpired for good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout running aground,\xe2\x80\x9d I persisted; \xe2\x80\x9csurely that\xe2\x80\x99s apt to be\r\ndangerous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat up and felt round for a match.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least, if you know where you can run risks and where you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t; anyway, you can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly help it. That chart may look simple\r\nto you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(\xe2\x80\x9csimple!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut at half flood all those banks are\r\ncovered; the islands and coasts are scarcely visible, they are so low,\r\nand everything looks the same.\xe2\x80\x9d This graphic description of a \xe2\x80\x9csplendid\r\ncruising-ground\xe2\x80\x9d took away my breath. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course there _is_ risk\r\nsometimes\xe2\x80\x94choosing an anchorage requires care. You can generally get a\r\nnice berth under the lee of a bank, but the tides run strong in the\r\nchannels, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s a gale blowing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever take a pilot?\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPilot? Why, the whole point of the thing\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he stopped short\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI did take\r\none once, later on,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, with an odd smile, which faded at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d I urged, for I saw a reverie was coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! he ran me ashore, of course. Served me right. I wonder what the\r\nweather\xe2\x80\x99s doing\xe2\x80\x9d; he rose, glanced at the aneroid, the clock, and the\r\nhalf-closed skylight with a curious circular movement, and went a step\r\nor two up the companion-ladder, where he remained for several minutes\r\nwith head and shoulders in the open air.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound of wind outside, but the _Dulcibella_ had begun to\r\nmove in her sleep, as it were, rolling drowsily to some faint send of\r\nthe sea, with an occasional short jump, like the start of an uneasy\r\ndreamer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it look like?\xe2\x80\x9d I called from my sofa. I had to repeat the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRain coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, returning, \xe2\x80\x9cand possibly wind; but we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsafe enough here. It\xe2\x80\x99s coming from the sou\xe2\x80\x99-west; shall we turn in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t finished your cruise yet,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cLight a pipe and tell\r\nme the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed, with more readiness than I expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter Terschelling\xe2\x80\x94here it is, the third island from the west\xe2\x80\x94I\r\npottered along eastward.\xe2\x80\x9d _[See Map A]_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I forgot. Morrison had to leave me there. I missed him badly, but\r\nI hoped at that time to get \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 to join me. I could manage all right\r\nsingle-handed, but for that sort of work two are much better than one.\r\nThe plate\xe2\x80\x99s beastly heavy; in fact, I had to give up using it for fear\r\nof a smash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter Terschelling?\xe2\x80\x9d I jogged his memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I followed the Dutch islands, Ameland, Schiermonnikoog, Rottum\r\n(outlandish names, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?), sometimes outside them, sometimes\r\ninside. It was a bit lonely, but grand sport and very interesting. The\r\ncharts were shocking, but I worried out most of the channels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose those waters are only used by small local craft?\xe2\x80\x9d I put in;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat would account for inaccuracies.\xe2\x80\x9d Did Davies think that\r\nAdmiralties had time to waste on smoothing the road for such quixotic\r\nlittle craft as his, in all its inquisitive ramblings? But he fired up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut think what folly it is. However,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a long story, and will bore you. To cut matters short, for we\r\nought to be turning in, I got to Borkum\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the first of the\r\n_German_ islands.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed at a round bare lozenge lying in the\r\nmidst of a welter of sandbanks. \xe2\x80\x9cRottum\xe2\x80\x94this queer little one\xe2\x80\x94it has\r\nonly one house on it\xe2\x80\x94is the most easterly Dutch island, and the\r\nmainland of Holland ends _here_, opposite it, at the Ems\r\nRiver\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94indicating a dismal cavity in the coast, sown with names\r\nsuggestive of mud, and wrecks, and dreariness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat date was this?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the ninth of this month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s only a fortnight before you wired to me! You were pretty\r\nquick getting to Flensburg. Wait a bit, we want another chart. Is this\r\nthe next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but we scarcely need it. I only went a little way farther on\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nNorderney, in fact, the third German island\xe2\x80\x94then I decided to go\r\nstraight for the Baltic. I had always had an idea of getting there, as\r\nKnight did in the _Falcon_. So I made a passage of it to the Eider\r\nRiver, _there_ on the West Schleswig coast, took the river and canal\r\nthrough to Kiel on the Baltic, and from there made another passage up\r\nnorth to Flensburg. I was a week there, and then you came, and here we\r\nare. And now let\xe2\x80\x99s turn in. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a fine sail to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d He ended\r\nwith rather forced vivacity, and briskly rolled up the chart. The\r\nreluctance he had shown from the first to talk about his cruise had\r\nbeen for a brief space forgotten in his enthusiasm about a portion of\r\nit, but had returned markedly in this bald conclusion. I felt sure that\r\nthere was more in it than mere disinclination to spin nautical yarns in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9chardy Corinthian\xe2\x80\x9d style, which can be so offensive in amateur\r\nyachtsmen; and I thought I guessed the explanation. His voyage\r\nsingle-handed to the Baltic from the Frisian Islands had been a\r\nfoolhardy enterprise, with perilous incidents, which, rather than make\r\nlight of, he would not refer to at all. Probably he was ashamed of his\r\nrecklessness and wished to ignore it with me, an inexperienced\r\nacquaintance not yet enamoured of the _Dulcibella_\xe2\x80\x99s way of life, whom\r\nboth courtesy and interest demanded that he should inspire with\r\nconfidence. I liked him all the better as I came to this conclusion,\r\nbut I was tempted to persist a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slept the whole afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cand, to tell the truth, I\r\nrather dread the idea of going to bed, it\xe2\x80\x99s so tiring. Look here,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve rushed over that last part like an express train. That passage\r\nto the Schleswig coast\xe2\x80\x94the Eider River, did you say?\xe2\x80\x94was a longish one,\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see what it was; about seventy miles, I suppose, direct.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nspoke low, bending down to sweep up some cigar ashes on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirect?\xe2\x80\x9d I insinuated. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you put in somewhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stopped once, anchored for the night; oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing of a sail\r\nwith a fair wind. By Jove! I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten to caulk that seam over your\r\nbunk, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to rain. I must do it now. You turn in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe disappeared. My curiosity, never very consuming, was banished by\r\nconcern as to the open seam; for the prospect of a big drop,\r\nremorseless and regular as Fate, falling on my forehead throughout the\r\nnight, as in the torture-chamber of the Inquisition, was alarming\r\nenough to recall me wholly to the immediate future. So I went to bed,\r\nfinding on the whole that I had made progress in the exercise, though\r\nstill far from being the trained contortionist that the occasion called\r\nfor. Hammering ceased, and Davies reappeared just as I was stretched on\r\nthe rack\xe2\x80\x94tucked up in my bunk, I mean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when he was settled in his, and darkness reigned, \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nyou think you\xe2\x80\x99ll like this sort of thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there are many places about here as beautiful as this,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I shall. But _I_ should like to land now and then and have a\r\nwalk. Of course, a great deal depends on the weather, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I\r\nhope this rain\xe2\x80\x9d (drops had begun to patter overhead) \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that\r\nthe summer\xe2\x80\x99s over for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you can sail just the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cunless it\xe2\x80\x99s very bad.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of sheltered water. There\xe2\x80\x99s bound to be a change soon.\r\nBut then there are the ducks. The colder and stormier it is, the better\r\nfor them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had forgotten the ducks and the cold, and, suddenly presented as a\r\nshooting-box in inclement weather, the _Dulcibella_ lost ground in my\r\nestimation, which she had latterly gained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fond of shooting,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m only a fair-weather\r\nyachtsman, and I should much prefer sun and scenery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScenery,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, you must have thought it\r\na queer taste of mine to cruise about on that outlandish Frisian coast.\r\nHow would you like that sort of thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should loathe it,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, promptly, with a clear conscience.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeren\xe2\x80\x99t you delighted yourself to get to the Baltic? It must be a\r\nwonderful contrast to what you described. Did you ever see another\r\nyacht there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cGood night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nWanted, a North Wind\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing disturbed my rest that night, so adaptable is youth and so\r\nmasterful is nature. At times I was remotely aware of a threshing of\r\nrain and a humming of wind, with a nervous kicking of the little hull,\r\nand at one moment I dreamt I saw an apparition by candle-light of\r\nDavies, clad in pyjamas and huge top-boots, grasping a misty lantern of\r\ngigantic proportions. But the apparition mounted the ladder and\r\ndisappeared, and I passed to other dreams.\r\n\r\nA blast in my ear, like the voice of fifty trombones, galvanised me\r\ninto full consciousness. The musician, smiling and tousled, was at my\r\nbedside, raising a foghorn to his lips with deadly intention. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nway we have in the _Dulcibella_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as I started up on one\r\nelbow. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t startle you much, did I?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I like the _mattinata_ better than the cold douche,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered,\r\nthinking of yesterday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine day and magnificent breeze!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. My sensations this\r\nmorning were vastly livelier than those of yesterday at the same hour.\r\nMy limbs were supple again and my head clear. Not even the searching\r\nwind could mar the ecstasy of that plunge down to smooth, seductive\r\nsand, where I buried greedy fingers and looked through a medium blue,\r\nwith that translucent blue, fairy-faint and angel-pure, that you see in\r\nperfection only in the heart of ice. Up again to sun, wind, and the\r\nforest whispers from the shore; down just once more to see the uncouth\r\nanchor stabbing the sand\xe2\x80\x99s soft bosom with one rusty fang, deaf and\r\ninert to the _Dulcibella_\xe2\x80\x99s puny efforts to drag him from his prey.\r\nBack, holding by the cable as a rusty clue from heaven to earth, up to\r\nthat _bourgeoise_ little maiden\xe2\x80\x99s bows; back to breakfast, with an\r\nappetite not to be blunted by condensed milk and somewhat _pass\xc3\xa9_\r\nbread. An hour later we had dressed the _Dulcibella_ for the road, and\r\nwere foaming into the grey void of yesterday, now a noble expanse of\r\nwind-whipped blue, half surrounded by distant hills, their every\r\noutline vivid in the rain-washed air.\r\n\r\nI cannot pretend that I really enjoyed this first sail into the open,\r\nthough I was keenly anxious to do so. I felt the thrill of those\r\nforward leaps, heard that persuasive song the foam sings under the\r\nlee-bow, saw the flashing harmonies of sea and sky; but sensuous\r\nperception was deadened by nervousness. The yacht looked smaller than\r\never outside the quiet fiord. The song of the foam seemed very near,\r\nthe wave crests aft very high. The novice in sailing clings desperately\r\nto the thoughts of sailors\xe2\x80\x94effective, prudent persons, with a typical\r\njargon and a typical dress, versed in local currents and winds. I could\r\nnot help missing this professional element. Davies, as he sat grasping\r\nhis beloved tiller, looked strikingly efficient in his way, and\r\nsupremely at home in his surroundings; but he looked the amateur\r\nthrough and through, as with one hand, and (it seemed) one eye, he\r\nwrestled with a spray-splashed chart half unrolled on the deck beside\r\nhim. All his casual ways returned to me\xe2\x80\x94his casual talk and that last\r\nadventurous voyage to the Baltic, and the suspicions his reticence had\r\naroused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see a monument anywhere?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, all at once; and, before I\r\ncould answer; \xe2\x80\x9cWe must take another reef.\xe2\x80\x9d He let go of the tiller and\r\nrelit his pipe, while the yacht rounded sharply to, and in a twinkling\r\nwas tossing head to sea with loud claps of her canvas and passionate\r\njerks of her boom, as the wind leapt on its quarry, now turning to bay,\r\nwith redoubled force. The sting of spray in my eyes and the Babel of\r\nnoise dazed me; but Davies, with a pull on the fore-sheet, soothed the\r\ntormented little ship, and left her coolly sparring with the waves\r\nwhile he shortened sail and puffed his pipe. An hour later the narrow\r\nvista of Als Sound was visible, with quiet old Sonderburg sunning\r\nitself on the island shore, and the Dybbol heights towering above\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nDybbol of bloody memory; scene of the last desperate stand of the Danes\r\nin \xe2\x80\x9964, ere the Prussians wrested the two fair provinces from them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s early to anchor, and I hate towns,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, as one section\r\nof a lumbering pontoon bridge opened to give us passage. But I was firm\r\non the need for a walk, and got my way on condition that I bought\r\nstores as well, and returned in time to admit of further advance to a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cquiet anchorage\xe2\x80\x9d. Never did I step on the solid earth with stranger\r\nfeelings, partly due to relief from confinement, partly to that sense\r\nof independence in travelling, which, for those who go down to the sea\r\nin small ships, can make the foulest coal-port in Northumbria seem\r\nattractive. And here I had fascinating Sonderburg, with its broad-eaved\r\nhouses of carved woodwork, each fresh with cleansing, yet reverend with\r\nage; its fair-haired Viking-like men, and rosy, plain-faced women, with\r\ntheir bullet foreheads and large mouths; Sonderburg still Danish to the\r\ncore under its Teuton veneer. Crossing the bridge I climbed the\r\nDybbol\xe2\x80\x94dotted with memorials of that heroic defence\xe2\x80\x94and thence could\r\nsee the wee form and gossamer rigging of the _Dulcibella_ on the silver\r\nribbon of the Sound, and was reminded by the sight that there were\r\nstores to be bought. So I hurried down again to the old quarter and\r\nbargained over eggs and bread with a dear old lady, pink as a\r\n_d\xc3\xa9butante,_ made a patriotic pretence of not understanding German, and\r\ncalled in her strapping son, whose few words of English, being chiefly\r\nnautical slang picked up on a British trawler, were peculiarly useless\r\nfor the purpose. Davies had tea ready when I came aboard again, and,\r\ndrinking it on deck, we proceeded up the sheltered Sound, which, in\r\nspite of its imposing name, was no bigger than an inland river, only\r\nthe hosts of rainbow jelly-fish reminding us that we were threading a\r\nhighway of ocean. There is no rise and fall of tide in these regions to\r\ndisfigure the shore with mud. Here was a shelving gravel bank; there a\r\nbed of whispering rushes; there again young birch trees growing to the\r\nvery brink, each wearing a stocking of bright moss and setting its foot\r\nfirmly in among golden leaves and scarlet fungus.\r\n\r\nDavies was preoccupied, but he lighted up when I talked of the Danish\r\nwar. \xe2\x80\x9cGermany\xe2\x80\x99s a thundering great nation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if we\r\nshall ever fight her.\xe2\x80\x9d A little incident that happened after we\r\nanchored deepened the impression left by this conversation. We crept at\r\ndusk into a shaded back-water, where our keel almost touched the gravel\r\nbed. Opposite us on the Alsen shore there showed, clean-cut against the\r\nsky, the spire of a little monument rising from a leafy hollow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what that is,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. It was scarcely a minute\xe2\x80\x99s row in the\r\ndinghy, and when the anchor was down we sculled over to it. A bank of\r\nloam led to gorse and bramble. Pushing aside some branches we came to a\r\nslender Gothic memorial in grey stone, inscribed with bas-reliefs of\r\nbattle scenes, showing Prussians forcing a landing in boats and Danes\r\nresisting with savage tenacity. In the failing light we spelt out an\r\ninscription: \xe2\x80\x9cDen bei dem Meeres Uebergange und der Eroberung von Alsen\r\nam 29. Juni 1864 heldenm\xc3\xbcthig gefallenen zum ehrenden Ged\xc3\xa4chtniss.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\nthe honoured memory of those who died heroically at the invasion and\r\nstorming of Alsen.\xe2\x80\x9d I knew the German passion for commemoration; I had\r\nseen similar memorials on Alsatian battlefields, and several on the\r\nDybbol only that afternoon; but there was something in the scene, the\r\nhour, and the circumstances, which made this one seem singularly\r\ntouching. As for Davies, I scarcely recognised him; his eyes flashed\r\nand filled with tears as he glanced from the inscription to the path we\r\nhad followed and the water beyond. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a landing in boats, I\r\nsuppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, half to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder they managed it. What\r\ndoes _heldenm\xc3\xbcthig_ mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHeroically.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHeldenm\xc3\xbcthig gefallenen,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated, under his breath, lingering on each syllable. He was like a\r\nschoolboy reading of Waterloo.\r\n\r\nOur conversation at dinner turned naturally on war, and in naval\r\nwarfare I found I had come upon Davies\xe2\x80\x99s literary hobby. I had not\r\nhitherto paid attention to the medley on our bookshelf, but I now saw\r\nthat, besides a Nautical Almanack and some dilapidated _Sailing\r\nDirections_, there were several books on the cruises of small yachts,\r\nand also some big volumes crushed in anyhow or lying on the top.\r\nSquinting painfully at them I saw Mahan\xe2\x80\x99s _Life of Nelson_, Brassey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Naval Annual_, and others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendously interesting subject,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, pulling down\r\n(in two pieces) a volume of Mahan\xe2\x80\x99s _Influence of Sea Power_.\r\n\r\nDinner flagged (and froze) while he illustrated a point by reference to\r\nthe much-thumbed pages. He was very keen, and not very articulate. I\r\nknew just enough to be an intelligent listener, and, though hungry, was\r\ndelighted to hear him talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not boring you, am I?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think not,\xe2\x80\x9d I protested. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you might just have a look at\r\nthe chops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had indeed been crying aloud for notice for some minutes, and drew\r\ncandid attention to their neglect when they appeared. The diversion\r\nthey caused put Davies out of vein. I tried to revive the subject, but\r\nhe was reserved and diffident.\r\n\r\nThe untidy bookshelf reminded me of the logbook, and when Davies had\r\nretired with the crockery to the forecastle, I pulled the ledger down\r\nand turned over the leaves. It was a mass of short entries, with\r\ncryptic abbreviations, winds, tides, weather, and courses appearing to\r\npredominate. The voyage from Dover to Ostend was dismissed in two\r\nlines: \xe2\x80\x9cUnder way 7 p.m., wind W.S.W. moderate; West Hinder 5 a.m.,\r\noutside all banks; Ostend 11 a.m.\xe2\x80\x9d The Scheldt had a couple of pages\r\nvery technical and _staccato_ in style. Inland Holland was given a\r\ncontemptuous summary, with some half-hearted allusions to windmills,\r\nand so on, and a caustic word or two about boys, paint, and canal\r\nsmells.\r\n\r\nAt Amsterdam technicalities began again, and a brisker tone pervaded\r\nthe entries, which became progressively fuller as the writer cruised on\r\nthe Frisian coast. He was clearly in better spirits, for here and there\r\nwere quaint and laboured efforts to describe nature out of material\r\nwhich, as far as I could judge, was repellent enough to discourage the\r\nmost brilliant and observant of writers; with an occasional note of a\r\nvisit on shore, generally reached by a walk of half a mile over sand,\r\nand of talks with shop people and fishermen. But such lighter relief\r\nwas rare. The bulk dealt with channels and shoals with weird and\r\ndepressing names, with the centre-plate, the sails, and the wind, buoys\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cbooms\xe2\x80\x9d, tides and \xe2\x80\x9cberths\xe2\x80\x9d for the night. \xe2\x80\x9cKedging off\xe2\x80\x9d appeared\r\nto be a frequent diversion; \xe2\x80\x9crunning aground\xe2\x80\x9d was of almost daily\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy reading, and I turned the leaves rapidly. I was\r\ncurious, too, to see the latter part. I came to a point where the rain\r\nof little sentences, pattering out like small shot, ceased abruptly. It\r\nwas at the end of September 9. That day, with its \xe2\x80\x9ckedging\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cboom-dodging\xe2\x80\x9d, was filled in with the usual detail. The log then leapt\r\nover three days, and went on: \xe2\x80\x9c_Sept._ 13. Wind W.N.W. fresh. Decided\r\nto go to Baltic. Sailed 4 a.m. Quick passage E. 1/2 S. to mouth of\r\nWeser. Anchored for night under Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn Sand. _ Sept._ 14, _nil_.\r\n_Sept._ 15, under way at 4 a.m. Wind East moderate. Course W. by S.;\r\nfour miles; N.E. by N. fifteen miles. Norderpiep 9.30. Eider River\r\n11.30.\xe2\x80\x9d This recital of naked facts was quite characteristic when\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpassages\xe2\x80\x9d were concerned, and any curiosity I had felt about his\r\nreticence on the previous night would have been rather allayed than\r\nstimulated had I not noticed that a page had been torn out of the book\r\njust at this point. The frayed edge left had been pruned and picked\r\ninto very small limits; but dissimulation was not Davies\xe2\x80\x99s strong\r\npoint, and a child could have seen that a leaf was missing, and that\r\nthe entries, starting from the evening of September 9 (where a page\r\nended), had been written together at one sitting. I was on the point of\r\ncalling to Davies, and chaffing him with having committed a grave\r\noffence against maritime law in having \xe2\x80\x9ccooked\xe2\x80\x9d his log; but I checked\r\nmyself, I scarcely know why, probably because I guessed the joke would\r\ntouch a sensitive place and fail. Delicacy shrank from seeing him\r\ncompelled either to amplify a deception or blunder out a confession\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwas too easy a prey; and, after all, the matter was of small moment. I\r\nreturned the book to the shelf, the only definite result of its perusal\r\nbeing to recall my promise to keep a diary myself, and I then and there\r\ndedicated a notebook to the purpose.\r\n\r\nWe were just lighting our cigars when we heard voices and the splash of\r\noars, followed by a bump against the hull which made Davies wince, as\r\nviolations of his paint always did. \xe2\x80\x9cGuten Abend; wo fahren Sie hin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ngreeted us as we climbed on deck. It turned out to be some jovial\r\nfishermen returning to their smack from a visit to Sonderburg. A short\r\ndialogue proved to them that we were mad Englishmen in bitter need of\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to Satrup,\xe2\x80\x9d they said; \xe2\x80\x9call the smacks are there, round the\r\npoint. There is good punch in the inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing loth, we followed in the dinghy, skirted a bend of the Sound,\r\nand opened up the lights of a village, with some smacks at anchor in\r\nfront of it. We were escorted to the inn, and introduced to a\r\nformidable beverage, called coffee-punch, and a smoke-wreathed circle\r\nof smacksmen, who talked German out of courtesy, but were Danish in all\r\nelse. Davies was at once at home with them, to a degree, indeed, that I\r\nenvied. His German was of the crudest kind, _bizarre_ in vocabulary and\r\ncomical in accent; but the freemasonry of the sea, or some charm of his\r\nown, gave intuition to both him and his hearers. I cut a poor figure in\r\nthis nautical gathering, though Davies, who persistently referred to me\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cmeiner Freund\xe2\x80\x9d, tried hard to represent me as a kindred spirit and\r\nto include me in the general talk. I was detected at once as an\r\nuninteresting hybrid. Davies, who sometimes appealed to me for a word,\r\nwas deep in talk over anchorages and ducks, especially, as I well\r\nremember now, about the chance of sport in a certain _Schlei Fiord_. I\r\nfell into utter neglect, till rescued by a taciturn person in\r\nspectacles and a very high cap, who appeared to be the only landsman\r\npresent. After silently puffing smoke in my direction for some time, he\r\nasked me if I was married, and if not, when I proposed to be. After\r\nthis inquisition he abandoned me.\r\n\r\nIt was eleven before we left this hospitable inn, escorted by the whole\r\nparty to the dinghy. Our friends of the smack insisted on our sharing\r\ntheir boat out of pure good-fellowship\xe2\x80\x94for there was not nearly room\r\nfor us\xe2\x80\x94and would not let us go till a bucket of fresh-caught fish had\r\nbeen emptied into her bottom. After much shaking of scaly hands, we\r\nsculled back to the _Dulcibella_, where she slept in a bed of tremulous\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nDavies sniffed the wind and scanned the tree-tops, where light gusts\r\nwere toying with the leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSou\xe2\x80\x99-west still,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand more rain coming. But it\xe2\x80\x99s bound to\r\nshift into the north.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill that be a good wind for us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends where we go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was asking those fellows\r\nabout duck-shooting. They seemed to think the best place would be\r\nSchlei Fiord. That\xe2\x80\x99s about fifteen miles south of Sonderburg, on the\r\nway to Kiel. They said there was a pilot chap living at the mouth who\r\nwould tell us all about it. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t very encouraging though. We\r\nshould want a north wind for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care where we go,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, to my own surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you really?\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, with sudden warmth. Then, with a\r\nslight change of voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean it\xe2\x80\x99s all very jolly about here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I meant that. Before we went below we both looked for a\r\nmoment at the little grey memorial; its slender fretted arch outlined\r\nin tender lights and darks above the hollow on the Alsen shore. The\r\nnight was that of September 27, the third I had spent on the\r\n_Dulcibella_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nSchlei Fiord\r\n\r\n\r\nI make no apology for having described these early days in some detail.\r\nIt is no wonder that their trivialities are as vividly before me as the\r\ncolours of earth and sea in this enchanting corner of the world. For\r\nevery trifle, sordid or picturesque, was relevant; every scrap of talk\r\na link; every passing mood critical for good or ill. So slight indeed\r\nwere the determining causes that changed my autumn holiday into an\r\nundertaking the most momentous I have ever approached.\r\n\r\nTwo days more preceded the change. On the first, the southwesterly wind\r\nstill holding, we sallied forth into Augustenburg Fiord, \xe2\x80\x9cto practise\r\nsmartness in a heavy thresh,\xe2\x80\x9d as Davies put it. It was the day of\r\ndedication for those disgusting oilskins, immured in whose stiff and\r\nodorous angles, I felt distressfully cumbersome; a day of proof indeed\r\nfor me, for heavy squalls swept incessantly over the loch, and Davies,\r\nat my own request, gave me no rest. Backwards and forwards we tacked,\r\nblustering into coves and out again, reefing and unreefing, now stung\r\nwith rain, now warmed with sun, but never with time to breathe or\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nI wrestled with intractable ropes, slaves if they could be subdued,\r\ntyrants if they got the upper hand; creeping, craning, straining, I\r\nmade the painful round of the deck, while Davies, hatless and tranquil,\r\ndirected my blundering movements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow take the helm and try steering in a hard breeze to windward. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe finest sport on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I grappled with the niceties of that delicate craft; smarting eyes,\r\nchafed hands, and dazed brain all pressed into the service, whilst\r\nDavies, taming the ropes the while, shouted into my ear the subtle\r\nmysteries of the art; that fidgeting ripple in the luff of the\r\nmainsail, and the distant rattle from the hungry jib\xe2\x80\x94signs that they\r\nare starved of wind and must be given more; the heavy list and wallow\r\nof the hull, the feel of the wind on your cheek instead of your nose,\r\nthe broader angle of the burgee at the masthead\xe2\x80\x94signs that they have\r\ntoo much, and that she is sagging recreantly to leeward instead of\r\nfighting to windward. He taught me the tactics for meeting squalls, and\r\nthe way to press your advantage when they are defeated\xe2\x80\x94the iron hand in\r\nthe velvet glove that the wilful tiller needs if you are to gain your\r\nends with it; the exact set of the sheets necessary to get the easiest\r\nand swiftest play of the hull\xe2\x80\x94all these things and many more I\r\nstruggled to apprehend, careless for the moment as to whether they were\r\nworth knowing, but doggedly set on knowing them. Needless to say, I had\r\nno eyes for beauty. The wooded inlets we dived into gave a brief\r\nrespite from wind and spindrift, but called into use the lead and the\r\ncentreboard tackle\xe2\x80\x94two new and cumbrous complexities. Davies\xe2\x80\x99s passion\r\nfor intricate navigation had to be sated even in these secure and\r\ntideless waters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get in as near as we can\xe2\x80\x94you stand by the lead,\xe2\x80\x9d was his\r\nformula; so I made false casts, tripped up in the slack, sent rivers of\r\nwater up my sleeves, and committed all the other _gaucheries_ that\r\nbeginners in the art commit, while the sand showed whiter beneath the\r\nkeel, till Davies regretfully drew off and shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cReady about,\r\ncentre-plate down,\xe2\x80\x9d and I dashed down to the trappings of that\r\ndiabolical contrivance, the only part of the _Dulcibella_\xe2\x80\x99s equipment\r\nthat I hated fiercely to the last. It had an odious habit when lowered\r\nof spouting jets of water through its chain-lead on to the cabin floor.\r\nOne of my duties was to gag it with cotton-waste, but even then its\r\nchoking gurgle was a most uncomfortable sound in your dining-room. In a\r\nminute the creek would be behind us and we would be thumping our stem\r\ninto the short hollow waves of the fiord, and lurching through spray\r\nand rain for some point on the opposite shore. Of our destination and\r\nobjects, if we had any, I knew nothing. At the northern end of the\r\nfiord, just before we turned, Davies had turned dreamy in the most\r\nexasperating way, for I was steering at the time and in mortal need of\r\nsympathetic guidance, if I was to avoid a sudden jibe. As though\r\ncontinuing aloud some internal debate, he held a onesided argument to\r\nthe effect that it was no use going farther north. Ducks, weather, and\r\ncharts figured in it, but I did not follow the pros and cons. I only\r\nknow that we suddenly turned and began to \xe2\x80\x9cbattle\xe2\x80\x9d south again. At\r\nsunset we were back once more in the same quiet pool among the trees\r\nand fields of Als Sound, a wondrous peace succeeding the turmoil.\r\nBruised and sodden, I was extricating myself from my oily prison, and\r\nlater was tasting (though not nearly yet in its perfection) the unique\r\nexultation that follows such a day, when, glowing all over, deliciously\r\ntired and pleasantly sore, you eat what seems ambrosia, be it only\r\ntinned beef; and drink nectar, be it only distilled from terrestrial\r\nhops or coffee berries, and inhale as culminating luxury balmy fumes\r\nwhich even the happy Homeric gods knew naught of.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, the 30th, a joyous shout of \xe2\x80\x9cNor\xe2\x80\x99-west wind\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsent me shivering on deck, in the small hours, to handle rain-stiff\r\ncanvas and cutting chain. It was a cloudy, unsettled day, but still\r\nenough after yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s boisterous ordeal. We retraced our way past\r\nSonderburg, and thence sailed for a faint line of pale green on the far\r\nsouth-western horizon. It was during this passage that an incident\r\noccurred, which, slight as it was, opened my eyes to much.\r\n\r\nA flight of wild duck crossed our bows at some little distance, a\r\nwedge-shaped phalanx of craning necks and flapping wings. I happened to\r\nbe steering while Davies verified our course below; but I called him up\r\nat once, and a discussion began about our chances of sport. Davies was\r\ngloomy over them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose fellows at Satrup were rather doubtful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are\r\nplenty of ducks, but I made out that it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy for strangers to get\r\nshooting. The whole country\xe2\x80\x99s so very civilised; it\xe2\x80\x99s not _wild_\r\nenough, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at me. I had no very clear opinion. It was anything but wild\r\nin one sense, but there seemed to be wild enough spots for ducks. The\r\nshore we were passing appeared to be bordered by lonely marshes, though\r\na spacious champaign showed behind. If it were not for the beautiful\r\nplaces we had seen, and my growing taste for our way of seeing them,\r\nhis disappointing vagueness would have nettled me more than it did.\r\nFor, after all, he had brought me out loaded with sporting equipment\r\nunder a promise of shooting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad weather is what we want for ducks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nin the wrong place for them. Now, if it was the North Sea, among those\r\nFrisian Islands\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d His tone was timid and interrogative, and I felt at\r\nonce that he was sounding me as to some unpalatable plan whose nature\r\nbegan to dawn on me.\r\n\r\nHe stammered on through a sentence or two about \xe2\x80\x9cwildness\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnobody\r\nto interfere with you,\xe2\x80\x9d and then I broke in: \xe2\x80\x9cYou surely don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nleave the Baltic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, staring into the compass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it, man!\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, tartly, \xe2\x80\x9chere we are in October, the summer\r\nover, and the weather gone to pieces. We\xe2\x80\x99re alone in a cockle-shell\r\nboat, at a time when every other yacht of our size is laying up for the\r\nwinter. Luckily, we seem to have struck an ideal cruising-ground, with\r\na wide choice of safe fiords and a good prospect of ducks, if we choose\r\nto take a little trouble about them. You can\xe2\x80\x99t mean to waste time and\r\nrun risks\xe2\x80\x9d (I thought of the torn leaf in the log-book) \xe2\x80\x9cin a long\r\nvoyage to those forbidding haunts of yours in the North Sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not very long,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, doggedly. \xe2\x80\x9cPart of it\xe2\x80\x99s canal, and\r\nthe rest is quite safe if you\xe2\x80\x99re careful. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of sheltered\r\nwater, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not really necessary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s it all _for?_\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t _tried_\r\nfor shooting here yet. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no notion, have you, of getting the boat\r\nback to England this autumn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEngland?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t much care.\xe2\x80\x9d Again his vagueness\r\njarred on me; there seemed to be some bar between us, invisible and\r\ninsurmountable. And, after all, what was I doing here? Roughing it in a\r\nshabby little yacht, utterly out of my element, with a man who, a week\r\nago, was nothing to me, and who now was a tiresome enigma. Like swift\r\npoison the old morbid mood in which I left London spread through me.\r\nAll I had learnt and seen slipped away; what I had suffered remained. I\r\nwas on the point of saying something which might have put a precipitate\r\nend to our cruise, but he anticipated me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cfor being such a selfish brute. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what I was thinking about. You\xe2\x80\x99re a brick to join me in this\r\nsort of life, and I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m an infernally bad host. Of course this\r\nis just the place to cruise. I forgot about the scenery, and all that.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s ask about the ducks here. As you say, we\xe2\x80\x99re sure to get sport if\r\nwe worry and push a bit. We must be nearly there now\xe2\x80\x94yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nentrance. Take the helm, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sprang up the mast like a monkey, and gazed over the land from the\r\ncross-trees. I looked up at my enigma and thanked Providence I had not\r\nspoken; for no one could have resisted his frank outburst of good\r\nnature. Yet it occurred to me that, considering the conditions of our\r\nlife, our intimacy was strangely slow in growth. I had no clue yet as\r\nto where his idiosyncrasies began and his self ended, and he, I\r\nsurmised, was in the same stage towards me. Otherwise I should have\r\npressed him further now, for I felt convinced that there was some\r\nmystery in his behaviour which I had not yet accounted for. However,\r\nlight was soon to break.\r\n\r\nI could see no sign of the entrance he had spoken of, and no wonder,\r\nfor it is only eighty yards wide, though it leads to a fiord thirty\r\nmiles long. All at once we were jolting in a tumble of sea, and the\r\nchannel grudgingly disclosed itself, stealing between marshes and\r\nmeadows and then broadening to a mere, as at Ekken. We anchored close\r\nto the mouth, and not far from a group of vessels of a type that\r\nafterwards grew very familiar to me. They were sailing-barges,\r\nsomething like those that ply in the Thames, bluff-bowed, high-sterned\r\ncraft of about fifty tons, ketch-rigged, and fitted with lee-boards,\r\nvery light spars, and a long tip-tilted bowsprit. (For the future I\r\nshall call them \xe2\x80\x9cgalliots\xe2\x80\x9d.) Otherwise the only sign of life was a\r\nsolitary white house\xe2\x80\x94the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s house, the chart told us\xe2\x80\x94close to the\r\nnorthern point of entrance. After tea we called on the pilot.\r\nPatriarchally installed before a roaring stove, in the company of a\r\nbuxom bustling daughter-in-law and some rosy grandchildren, we found a\r\nrotund and rubicund person, who greeted us with a hoarse roar of\r\nwelcome in German, which instantly changed, when he saw us, to the\r\nfunniest broken English, spoken with intense relish and pride. We\r\nexplained ourselves and our mission as well as we could through the\r\nhospitable interruptions caused by beer and the strains of a huge\r\nmusical box, which had been set going in honour of our arrival.\r\nNeedless to say, I was read like a book at once, and fell into the part\r\nof listener.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9call right. There is plenty ducks, but first we\r\nwill drink a glass beer; then we will shift your ship, captain\xe2\x80\x94she lies\r\nnot good there.\xe2\x80\x9d (Davies started up in a panic, but was waved back to\r\nhis beer.) \xe2\x80\x9cThen we will drink together another glass beer; then we\r\nwill talk of ducks\xe2\x80\x94no, then we will kill ducks\xe2\x80\x94that is better. Then we\r\nwill have plenty glasses beer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was an unexpected climax, and promised well for our prospects. And\r\nthe programme was fully carried out. After the beer our host was packed\r\nbriskly by his daughter into an armour of woollen gaiters, coats, and\r\nmufflers, topped with a worsted helmet, which left nothing of his face\r\nvisible but a pair of twinkling eyes. Thus equipped, he led the way out\r\nof doors, and roared for Hans and his gun, till a great gawky youth,\r\nwith high cheek-bones and a downy beard, came out from the yard and\r\nsheepishly shook our hands.\r\n\r\nTogether we repaired to the quay, where the pilot stood, looking like a\r\ngenial ball of worsted, and bawled hoarse directions while we shifted\r\nthe _Dulcibella_ to a berth on the farther shore close to the other\r\nvessels. We returned with our guns, and the interval for refreshments\r\nfollowed. It was just dusk when we sallied out again, crossed a stretch\r\nof bog-land, and took up strategic posts round a stagnant pond. Hans\r\nhad been sent to drive, and the result was a fine mallard and three\r\nducks. It was true that all fell to the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s gun, perhaps owing to\r\nHans\xe2\x80\x99s filial instinct and his parent\xe2\x80\x99s canny egotism in choosing his\r\nown lair, or perhaps it was chance; but the shooting-party was none the\r\nless a triumphal success. It was celebrated with beer and music as\r\nbefore, while the pilot, an infant on each podgy knee, discoursed\r\nexuberantly on the glories of his country and the Elysian content of\r\nhis life. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is plenty beer, plenty meat, plenty money, plenty\r\nducks,\xe2\x80\x9d summed up his survey.\r\n\r\nIt may have been fancy, but Davies, though he had fits and starts of\r\nvivacity, seemed very inattentive, considering that we were sitting at\r\nthe feet of so expansive an oracle. It was I who elicited most of the\r\npractical information\xe2\x80\x94details of time, weather, and likely places for\r\nshooting, with some shrewd hints as to the kind of people to\r\nconciliate. Whatever he thought of me, I warmed with sympathy towards\r\nthe pilot, for he assumed that we had done with cruising for the year,\r\nand thought us mad enough as it was to have been afloat so long, and\r\nmadder still to intend living on \xe2\x80\x9cso little a ship\xe2\x80\x9d when we could live\r\non land with beer and music handy. I was tempted to raise the North Sea\r\nquestion, just to watch Davies under the thunder of rebukes which would\r\nfollow. But I refrained from a wish to be tender with him, now that all\r\nwas going so well. The Frisian Islands were an extravagant absurdity\r\nnow. I did not even refer to them as we pulled back to the\r\n_Dulcibella_, after swearing eternal friendship with the good pilot and\r\nhis family.\r\n\r\nDavies and I turned in good friends that night\xe2\x80\x94or rather I should say\r\nthat I turned in, for I left him sucking an empty pipe and aimlessly\r\nfingering a volume of Mahan; and once when I woke in the night I felt\r\nsomehow that his bunk was empty and that he was there in the dark\r\ncabin, dreaming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nThe Missing Page\r\n\r\n\r\nI woke (on the 1st of October) with that dispiriting sensation that a\r\nhitch has occurred in a settled plan. It was explained when I went on\r\ndeck, and I found the _Dulcibella_ wrapped in a fog, silent, clammy,\r\nnothing visible from her decks but the ghostly hull of a galliot at\r\nanchor near us. She must have brought up there in the night, for there\r\nhad been nothing so close the evening before; and I remembered that my\r\nsleep had been broken once by sounds of rumbling chain and gruff\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis looks pretty hopeless for to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with a shiver, to\r\nDavies, who was laying the breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything till this fog lifts,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a\r\ngood deal of resignation. Breakfast was a cheerless meal. The damp\r\npenetrated to the very cabin, whose roof and walls wept a fine dew. I\r\nhad dreaded a bathe, and yet missed it, and the ghastly light made the\r\ntablecloth look dirtier than it naturally was, and all the accessories\r\nmore sordid. Something had gone wrong with the bacon, and the lack of\r\negg-cups was not in the least humorous.\r\n\r\nDavies was just beginning, in his summary way, to tumble the things\r\ntogether for washing up, when there was a sound of a step on deck, two\r\nsea-boots appeared on the ladder, and, before we could wonder who the\r\nvisitor was, a little man in oilskins and a sou\xe2\x80\x99-wester was stooping\r\ntowards us in the cabin door, smiling affectionately at Davies out of a\r\nround grizzled beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell met, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly, in German. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you bound\r\nto this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBartels!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Davies, jumping up. The two stooping figures,\r\nyoung and old, beamed at one another like father and son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you come from? Have some coffee. How\xe2\x80\x99s the _Johannes_? Was\r\nthat you that came in last night? I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to see you!\xe2\x80\x9d (I spare\r\nthe reader his uncouth lingo.) The little man was dragged in and seated\r\non the opposite sofa to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took my apples to Kappeln,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sedately, \xe2\x80\x9cand now I sail to\r\nKiel, and so to Hamburg, where my wife and children are. It is my last\r\nvoyage of the year. You are no longer alone, captain, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d He had\r\ntaken off his dripping sou\xe2\x80\x99-wester and was bowing ceremoniously towards\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I quite forgot!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, who had been kneeling on one knee in\r\nthe low doorway, absorbed in his visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is \xe2\x80\x98_meiner Freund_,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHerr Carruthers. Carruthers, this is my friend, Schiffer Bartels, of\r\nthe galliot _Johannes_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas I never to be at an end of the puzzles which Davies presented to\r\nme? All the impulsive heartiness died out of his voice and manner as he\r\nuttered the last few words, and there he was, nervously glancing from\r\nthe visitor to me, like one who, against his will or from tactlessness,\r\nhas introduced two persons who he knows will disagree.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause while he fumbled with the cups, poured some cold\r\ncoffee out and pondered over it as though it were a chemical\r\nexperiment. Then he muttered something about boiling some more water,\r\nand took refuge in the forecastle. I was ill at ease at this period\r\nwith seafaring men, but this mild little person was easy ground for a\r\nbeginner. Besides, when he took off his oilskin coat he reminded me\r\nless of a sailor than of a homely draper of some country town, with his\r\nclean turned-down collar and neatly fitting frieze jacket. We exchanged\r\nsome polite platitudes about the fog and his voyage last night from\r\nKappeln, which appeared to be a town some fifteen miles up the fiord.\r\n\r\nDavies joined in from the forecastle with an excess of warmth which\r\nalmost took the words out of my mouth. We exhausted the subject very\r\nsoon, and then my _vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_ smiled paternally at me, as he had done\r\nat Davies, and said, confidentially:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is good that the captain is no more alone. He is a fine young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94Heaven, what a fine young man! I love him as my son\xe2\x80\x94but he is too\r\nbrave, too reckless. It is good for him to have a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI nodded and laughed, though in reality I was very far from being\r\namused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was it you met?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn an ugly place, and in ugly weather,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, gravely, but with\r\na twinkle of fun in his eye. \xe2\x80\x9cBut has he not told you?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with\r\nponderous slyness. \xe2\x80\x9cI came just in time. No! what am I saying? He is\r\nbrave as a lion and quick as a cat. I think he cannot drown; but still\r\nit was an ugly place and ugly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about, Bartels?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Davies, emerging\r\nnoisily with a boiling kettle.\r\n\r\nI answered the question. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just asking your friend how it was you\r\nmade his acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he helped me out of a bit of a mess in the North Sea, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you,\r\nBartels?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartels. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the North Sea is no place for your\r\nlittle boat, captain. So I have told you many times. How did you like\r\nFlensburg? A fine town, is it not? Did you find Herr Krank, the\r\ncarpenter? I see you have placed a little mizzen-mast. The rudder was\r\nnothing much, but it was well that it held to the Eider. But she is\r\nstrong and good, your little ship, and\xe2\x80\x94Heaven!\xe2\x80\x94she had need be so.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nchuckled, and shook his head at Davies as at a wayward child.\r\n\r\nThis is all the conversation that I need record. For my part I merely\r\nwaited for its end, determined on my course, which was to know the\r\ntruth once and for all, and make an end of these distracting\r\nmystifications. Davies plied his friend with coffee, and kept up the\r\ntalk gallantly; but affectionate as he was, his manner plainly showed\r\nthat he wanted to be alone with me.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the little skipper\xe2\x80\x99s talk was a parental warning that,\r\nthough we were well enough here in the \xe2\x80\x9cOst-See\xe2\x80\x9d, it was time for\r\nlittle boats to be looking for winter quarters. That he himself was\r\ngoing by the Kiel Canal to Hamburg to spend a cosy winter as a decent\r\ncitizen at his warm fireside, and that we should follow his example. He\r\nended with an invitation to us to visit him on the _Johannes_, and with\r\nsuave farewells disappeared into the fog. Davies saw him into his boat,\r\nreturned without wasting a moment, and sat down on the sofa opposite\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he mean?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the whole thing. As far as\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re concerned it\xe2\x80\x99s partly a confession. Last night I had made up my\r\nmind to say nothing, but when Bartels turned up I knew it must all come\r\nout. It\xe2\x80\x99s been fearfully on my mind, and perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to help\r\nme. But it\xe2\x80\x99s for you to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire away!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I was saying about the Frisian Islands the other day? A\r\nthing happened there which I never told you, when you were asking about\r\nmy cruise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt began near Norderney,\xe2\x80\x9d I put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you guess that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a bad hand at duplicity,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re quite right, it was there, on September 9. I told you the\r\nsort of thing I was doing at that time, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I said that I\r\nmade inquiries from one or two people about duck-shooting, and had been\r\ntold by some fishermen at Borkum that there was a big sailing-yacht in\r\nthose waters, whose owner, a German of the name of Dollmann, shot a\r\ngood deal, and might give me some tips. Well, I found this yacht one\r\nevening, knowing it must be her from the description I had. She was\r\nwhat is called a \xe2\x80\x98barge-yacht\xe2\x80\x99, of fifty or sixty tons, built for\r\nshallow water on the lines of a Dutch galliot, with lee-boards and\r\nthose queer round bows and square stern. She\xe2\x80\x99s something like those\r\ngalliots anchored near us now. You sometimes see the same sort of yacht\r\nin English waters, only there they copy the Thames barges. She looked a\r\nclipper of her sort, and very smart; varnished all over and shining\r\nlike gold. I came on her about sunset, after a long day of exploring\r\nround the Ems estuary. She was lying in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, let\xe2\x80\x99s have the chart,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted.\r\n\r\nDavies found it and spread it on the table between us, first pushing\r\nback the cloth and the breakfast things to one end, where they lay in a\r\nslovenly litter. This was one of the only two occasions on which I ever\r\nsaw him postpone the rite of washing up, and it spoke volumes for the\r\nurgency of the matter in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies _[See Map A]_ and I looked with a new and\r\nstrange interest at the long string of slender islands, the parallel\r\nline of coast, and the confusion of shoals, banks, and channels which\r\nlay between. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Norderney, you see. By the way, there\xe2\x80\x99s a harbour\r\nthere at the west end of the island, the only real harbour on the whole\r\nline of islands, Dutch or German, except at Terschelling. There\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\na big town there, too, a watering place, where Germans go for\r\nsea-bathing in the summer. Well, the _Medusa_, that was her name, was\r\nlying in the Riff Gat roadstead, flying the German ensign, and I\r\nanchored for the night pretty near her. I meant to visit her owner\r\nlater on, but I very nearly changed my mind, as I always feel rather a\r\nfool on smart yachts, and my German isn\xe2\x80\x99t very good. However, I thought\r\nI might as well; so, after dinner, when it was dark, I sculled over in\r\nthe dinghy, hailed a sailor on deck, said who I was, and asked if I\r\ncould see the owner. The sailor was a surly sort of chap, and there was\r\na good long delay while I waited on deck, feeling more and more\r\nuncomfortable. Presently a steward came up and showed me down the\r\ncompanion and into the saloon, which, after _this_, looked\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nhorribly gorgeous\xe2\x80\x94you know what I mean, plush lounges, silk cushions,\r\nand that sort of thing. Dinner seemed to be just over, and wine and\r\nfruit were on the table. Herr Dollmann was there at his coffee. I\r\nintroduced myself somehow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was he like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a tall, thin chap, in evening dress; about fifty I suppose, with\r\ngreyish hair and a short beard. I\xe2\x80\x99m not good at describing people. He\r\nhad a high, bulging forehead, and there was something about him\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99d better tell you the bare facts first. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say he seemed\r\npleased to see me, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak English, and, in fact, I felt\r\ninfernally awkward. Still, I had an object in coming, and as I was\r\nthere I thought I might as well gain it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe notion of Davies in his Norfolk jacket and rusty flannels\r\nharanguing a frigid German in evening dress in a \xe2\x80\x9cgorgeous\xe2\x80\x9d saloon\r\ntickled my fancy greatly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed very much astonished to see me; had evidently seen the\r\n_Dulcibella_ arrive, and had wondered what she was. I began as soon as\r\nI could about the ducks, but he shut me up at once, said I could do\r\nnothing hereabouts. I put it down to sportsman\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy\xe2\x80\x94you know what\r\nthat is. But I saw I had come to the wrong shop, and was just going to\r\nback out and end this unpleasant interview, when he thawed a bit,\r\noffered me some wine, and began talking in quite a friendly way, taking\r\na great interest in my cruise and my plans for the future. In the end\r\nwe sat up quite late, though I never felt really at my ease. He seemed\r\nto be taking stock of me all the time, as though I were some new\r\nanimal.\xe2\x80\x9d (How I sympathised with that German!) \xe2\x80\x9cWe parted civilly\r\nenough, and I rowed back and turned in, meaning to potter on eastwards\r\nearly next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I was knocked up at dawn by a sailor with a message from Dollmann\r\nasking if he could come to breakfast with me. I was rather\r\nflabbergasted, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be rude, so I said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, he\r\ncame, and I returned the call\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94well, the end of it was that I stayed\r\nat anchor there for three days.\xe2\x80\x9d This was rather abrupt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you spend the time?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. Stopping three days anywhere was\r\nan unusual event for him, as I knew from his log.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I lunched or dined with him once or twice\xe2\x80\x94with _them_, I ought to\r\nsay,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cHis daughter was with him. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nappear the evening I first called.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what was she like?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, promptly, before he could hurry on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she seemed a very nice girl,\xe2\x80\x9d was the guarded reply, delivered\r\nwith particular unconcern, \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x94the end of it was that I and the\r\n_Medusa_ sailed away in company. I must tell you how it came about,\r\njust in a few words for the present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was his suggestion. He said he had to sail to Hamburg, and proposed\r\nthat I should go with him in the _Dulcibella_ as far as the Elbe, and\r\nthen, if I liked, I could take the ship canal at Brunsb\xc3\xbcttel through to\r\nKiel and the Baltic. I had no very fixed plans of my own, though I had\r\nmeant to go on exploring eastwards between the islands and the coast,\r\nand so reach the Elbe in a much slower way. He dissuaded me from this,\r\nsticking to it that I should have no chance of ducks, and urging other\r\nreasons. Anyway, we settled to sail in company direct to Cuxhaven, in\r\nthe Elbe. With a fair wind and an early start it should be only one\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s sail of about sixty miles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe plan only came to a head on the evening of the third day, on the\r\n12th of September.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you, I think, that the weather had broken after a long spell of\r\nheat. That very day it had been blowing pretty hard from the west, and\r\nthe glass was falling still. I said, of course, that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go with\r\nhim if the weather was too bad, but he prophesied a good day, said it\r\nwas an easy sail, and altogether put me on my mettle. You can guess how\r\nit was. Perhaps I had talked about single-handed cruising as though it\r\nwere easier than it was, though I never meant it in a boasting way, for\r\nI hate that sort of thing, and besides there _is_ no danger if you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncareful\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go on,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, we went next morning at six. It was a dirty-looking day, wind\r\nW.N.W., but his sails were going up and mine followed. I took two reefs\r\nin, and we sailed out into the open and steered E.N.E. along the coast\r\nfor the Outer Elbe Lightship about fifty knots off. Here it all is, you\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d (He showed me the course on the chart.) \xe2\x80\x9cThe trip was nothing for\r\nhis boat, of course, a safe, powerful old tub, forging through the sea\r\nas steady as a house. I kept up with her easily at first. My hands were\r\npretty full, for there was a hard wind on my quarter and a troublesome\r\nsea; but as long as nothing worse came I knew I should be all right,\r\nthough I also knew that I was a fool to have come.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: Chart A to Illustrate the Stranding of the Dulcibella,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll went well till we were off Wangeroog, the last of the\r\nislands\xe2\x80\x94_here_\xe2\x80\x94and then it began to blow really hard. I had half a mind\r\nto chuck it and cut into the Jade River, _down there_,\xe2\x80\x9d but I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe face to, so I hove to and took in my last reef.\xe2\x80\x9d (Simple words,\r\nsimply uttered; but I had seen the operation in calm water and\r\nshuddered at the present picture.) \xe2\x80\x9cWe had been about level till then,\r\nbut with my shortened canvas I fell behind. Not that that mattered in\r\nthe least. I knew my course, had read up my tides, and, thick as the\r\nweather was, I had no doubt of being able to pick up the lightship. No\r\nchange of plan was possible now. The Weser estuary was on my starboard\r\nhand, but the whole place was a lee-shore and a mass of unknown\r\nbanks\xe2\x80\x94just look at them. I ran on, the _Dulcibella_ doing her level\r\nbest, but we had some narrow shaves of being pooped. I was about\r\n_here_, say six miles south-west of the lightship, _[See Chart A]_ when\r\nI suddenly saw that the _Medusa_ had hove to right ahead, as though\r\nwaiting till I came up. She wore round again on the course as I drew\r\nlevel, and we were alongside for a bit. Dollmann lashed the wheel,\r\nleaned over her quarter, and shouted, very slowly and distinctly so\r\nthat I could understand; \xe2\x80\x98Follow me\xe2\x80\x94sea too bad for you outside\xe2\x80\x94short\r\ncut through sands\xe2\x80\x94save six miles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was taking me all my time to manage the tiller, but I knew what he\r\nmeant at once, for I had been over the chart carefully the night\r\nbefore. _[See Map A]_ You see, the whole bay between Wangeroog and the\r\nElbe is encumbered with sand. A great jagged chunk of it runs out from\r\nCuxhaven in a north-westerly direction for fifteen miles or so, ending\r\nin a pointed spit, called the _Scharhorn_. To reach the Elbe from the\r\nwest you have to go right outside this, round the lightship, which is\r\noff the Scharhorn, and double back. Of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s what all big\r\nvessels do. But, as you see, these sands are intersected here and there\r\nby channels, very shallow and winding, exactly like those behind the\r\nFrisian Islands. Now look at this one, which cuts right through the big\r\nchunk of sand and comes out near Cuxhaven. The _Telte_ _[See Chart A]_\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s called. It\xe2\x80\x99s miles wide, you see, at the entrance, but later on it\r\nis split into two by the Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn bank: then it gets shallow and very\r\ncomplicated, and ends in a mere tidal driblet with another name. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust the sort of channel I should like to worry into on a fine day or\r\nwith an off-shore wind. Alone, in thick weather and a heavy sea, it\r\nwould have been folly to attempt it, except as a desperate resource.\r\nBut, as I said I knew at once that Dollmann was proposing to run for it\r\nand guide me in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea, because I like doing things for myself, and,\r\nsilly as it sounds, I believe I resented being told the sea was too bad\r\nfor me, which it certainly was. Yet the short cut did save several\r\nmiles and a devil of a tumble off the Scharhorn, where two tides meet.\r\nI had complete faith in Dollmann, and I suppose I decided that I should\r\nbe a fool not to take a good chance. I hesitated. I know; but in the\r\nend I nodded, and held up my arm as she forged ahead again. Soon after,\r\nshe shifted her course and I followed. You asked me once if I ever took\r\na pilot. That was the only time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with bitter gravity, flung himself back, and felt his pocket\r\nfor his pipe. It was not meant for a dramatic pause, but it certainly\r\nwas one. I had just a glimpse of still another Davies\xe2\x80\x94a Davies five\r\nyears older throbbing with deep emotions, scorn, passion, and stubborn\r\npurpose; a being above my plane, of sterner stuff, wider scope. Intense\r\nas my interest had become, I waited almost timidly while he\r\nmechanically rammed tobacco into his pipe and struck ineffectual\r\nmatches. I felt that whatever the riddle to be solved, it was no mean\r\none. He repressed himself with an effort, half rose, and made his\r\ncircular glance at the clock, barometer, and skylight, and then\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe soon came to what I knew must be the beginning of the Telte\r\nchannel. All round you could hear the breakers on the sands, though it\r\nwas too thick to see them yet. As the water shoaled, the sea, of\r\ncourse, got shorter and steeper. There was more wind\xe2\x80\x94a whole gale I\r\nshould say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kept dead in the wake of the _Medusa_, but to my disgust I found she\r\nwas gaining on me very fast. Of course I had taken for granted, when he\r\nsaid he would lead me in, that he would slow down and keep close to me.\r\nHe could easily have done so by getting his men up to check his sheets\r\nor drop his peak. Instead of that he was busting on for all he was\r\nworth. Once, in a rain-squall, I lost sight of him altogether; got him\r\nfaintly again, but had enough to do with my own tiller not to want to\r\nbe peering through the scud after a runaway pilot. I was all right so\r\nfar, but we were fast approaching the worst part of the whole passage,\r\nwhere the Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn bank blocks the road, and the channel divides. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what it looks like to you on the chart\xe2\x80\x94perhaps fairly\r\nsimple, because you can follow the twists of the channels, as on a\r\nground-plan; but a stranger coming to a place like that (where there\r\nare no buoys, mind you) can tell nothing certain by the eye\xe2\x80\x94unless\r\nperhaps at dead low water, when the banks are high and dry, and in very\r\nclear weather\xe2\x80\x94he must trust to the lead and the compass, and feel his\r\nway step by step. I knew perfectly well that what I should soon see\r\nwould be a wall of surf stretching right across and on both sides. To\r\n_feel_ one\xe2\x80\x99s way in that sort of weather is impossible. You must _know_\r\nyour way, or else have a pilot. I had one, but he was playing his own\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a second hand on board to steer while I conned I should have felt\r\nless of an ass. As it was, I knew I ought to be facing the music in the\r\noffing, and cursed myself for having broken my rule and gone blundering\r\ninto this confounded short cut. It was giving myself away, doing just\r\nthe very thing that you can\xe2\x80\x99t do in single-handed sailing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the time I realised the danger it was far too late to turn and\r\nhammer out to the open. I was deep in the bottle-neck bight of the\r\nsands, jammed on a lee shore, and a strong flood tide sweeping me on.\r\nThat tide, by the way, gave just the ghost of a chance. I had the hours\r\nin my head, and knew it was about two-thirds flood, with two hours more\r\nof rising water. That meant the banks would be all covering when I\r\nreached them, and harder than ever to locate; but it also meant that I\r\n_might_ float right over the worst of them if I hit off a lucky place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDavies thumped the table in disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cPah! It makes me sick to think of\r\nhaving to trust to an accident like that, like a lubberly cockney out\r\nfor a boozy Bank Holiday sail. Well, just as I foresaw, the wall of\r\nsurf appeared clean across the horizon, and curling back to shut me in,\r\nbooming like thunder. When I last saw the _Medusa_ she seemed to be\r\ncharging it like a horse at a fence, and I took a rough bearing of her\r\nposition by a hurried glance at the compass. At that very moment I\r\n_thought_ she seemed to luff and show some of her broadside; but a\r\nsquall blotted her out and gave me hell with the tiller. After that she\r\nwas lost in the white mist that hung over the line of breakers. I kept\r\non my bearing as well as I could, but I was already out of the channel.\r\nI knew that by the look of the water, and as we neared the bank I saw\r\nit was all awash and without the vestige of an opening. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going\r\nto chuck her on to it without an effort; so, more by instinct than with\r\nany particular hope, I put the helm down, meaning to work her along the\r\nedge on the chance of spotting a way over. She was buried at once by\r\nthe beam sea, and the jib flew to blazes; but the reefed stays\xe2\x80\x99l stood,\r\nshe recovered gamely, and I held on, though I knew it could only be for\r\na few minutes, as the centre-plate was up, and she made frightful\r\nleeway towards the bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was half-blinded by scud, but suddenly I noticed what looked like a\r\ngap, behind a spit which curled out right ahead. I luffed still more to\r\nclear this spit, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t weather it. Before you could say\r\nknife she was driving across it, bumped heavily, bucked forward again,\r\nbumped again, and\xe2\x80\x94ripped on in deeper water! I can\xe2\x80\x99t describe the next\r\nfew minutes. I was in some sort of channel, but a very narrow one, and\r\nthe sea broke everywhere. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t proper command either; for the\r\nrudder had crocked up somehow at the last bump. I was like a drunken\r\nman running for his life down a dark alley, barking himself at every\r\ncorner. It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t last long, and finally we went crash on to\r\nsomething and stopped there, grinding and banging. So ended that little\r\ntrip under a pilot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was like this\xe2\x80\x94there was really no danger\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I opened my eyes at\r\nthe characteristic phrase. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, that lucky stumble into a channel\r\nwas my salvation. Since then I had struggled through a mile of sands,\r\nall of which lay behind me like a breakwater against the gale. They\r\nwere covered, of course, and seething like soapsuds; but the force of\r\nthe sea was deadened. The _Dulce_ was bumping, but not too heavily. It\r\nwas nearing high tide, and at half ebb she would be high and dry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the ordinary way I should have run out a kedge with the dinghy, and\r\nat the next high water sailed farther in and anchored where I could lie\r\nafloat. The trouble was now that my hand was hurt and my dinghy stove\r\nin, not to mention the rudder business. It was the first bump on the\r\nouter edge that did the damage. There was a heavy swell there, and when\r\nwe struck, the dinghy, which was towing astern, came home on her\r\npainter and down with a crash on the yacht\xe2\x80\x99s weather quarter. I stuck\r\nout one hand to ward it off and got it nipped on the gunwale. She was\r\nbadly stove in and useless, so I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t run out the kedge\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this was\r\nGreek to me, but I let him go on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand for the present my hand was too\r\npainful even to stow the boom and sails, which were whipping and\r\nracketing about anyhow. There was the rudder, too, to be mended; and we\r\nwere several miles from the nearest land. Of course, if the wind fell,\r\nit was all easy enough; but if it held or increased it was a poor\r\nlook-out. There\xe2\x80\x99s a limit to strain of that sort\xe2\x80\x94and other things might\r\nhave happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, it was precious lucky that Bartels turned up. His galliot was\r\nat anchor a mile away, up a branch of the channel. In a clear between\r\nsqualls he saw us, and, like a brick, rowed his boat out\xe2\x80\x94he and his\r\nboy, and a devil of a pull they must have had. I was glad enough to see\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94no, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true; I was in such a fury of disgust and shame\r\nthat I believe I should have been idiot enough to say I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nhelp, if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t just nipped on board and started work. He\xe2\x80\x99s a terror\r\nto work, that little mouse of a chap. In half an hour he had stowed the\r\nsails, unshackled the big anchor, run out fifty fathoms of warp, and\r\nhauled her off there and then into deep water. Then they towed her up\r\nthe channel\xe2\x80\x94it was dead to leeward and an easy job\xe2\x80\x94and berthed her near\r\ntheir own vessel. It was dark by that time, so I gave them a drink, and\r\nsaid good-night. It blew a howling gale that night, but the place was\r\nsafe enough, with good ground-tackle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole affair was over; and after supper I thought hard about it\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nThe Theory\r\n\r\n\r\nDavies leaned back and gave a deep sigh, as though he still felt the\r\nrelief from some tension. I did the same, and felt the same relief. The\r\nchart, freed from the pressure of our fingers, rolled up with a flip,\r\nas though to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d I have straightened out\r\nhis sentences a little, for in the excitement of his story they had\r\ngrown more and more jerky and elliptical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Dollmann?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat about him? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get at much that\r\nnight. It was all so sudden. The only thing I could have sworn to from\r\nthe first was that he had purposely left me in the lurch that day. I\r\npieced out the rest in the next few days, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll just finish with\r\nas shortly as I can. Bartels came aboard next morning, and though it\r\nwas blowing hard still we managed to shift the _Dulcibella_ to a place\r\nwhere she dried safely at the midday low water, and we could get at her\r\nrudder. The lower screw-plate on the stern post had wrenched out, and\r\nwe botched it up roughly as a makeshift. There were other little\r\nbreakages, but nothing to matter, and the loss of the jib was nothing,\r\nas I had two spare ones. The dinghy was past repair just then, and I\r\nlashed it on deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt turned out that Bartels was carrying apples from Bremen to Kappeln\r\n(in this fiord), and had run into that channel in the sands for shelter\r\nfrom the weather. To-day he was bound for the Eider River, whence, as I\r\ntold you, you can get through (by river and canal) into the Baltic. Of\r\ncourse the Elbe route, by the new Kaiser Wilhelm ship canal, is the\r\nshortest. The Eider route is the old one, but he hoped to get rid of\r\nsome of his apples at T\xc3\xb6nning, the town at its mouth. Both routes touch\r\nthe Baltic at Kiel. As you know, I had been running for the Elbe, but\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s muck-up put me off, and I changed my mind\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why\r\npresently\xe2\x80\x94and decided to sail to the Eider along with the _Johannes_\r\nand get through that way. It cleared from the east next day, and I\r\nraced him there, winning hands down, left him at T\xc3\xb6nning, and in three\r\ndays was in the Baltic. It was just a week after I ran ashore that I\r\nwired to you. You see, I had come to the conclusion that _that chap was\r\na spy_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the end it came out quite quietly and suddenly, and left me in\r\nprofound amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cI wired to you\xe2\x80\x94that chap was a spy.\xe2\x80\x9d It was the\r\nclose association of these two ideas that hit me hardest at the moment.\r\nFor a second I was back in the dreary splendour of the London\r\nclub-room, spelling out that crabbed scrawl from Davies, and\r\nfastidiously criticising its proposal in the light of a holiday.\r\nHoliday! What was to be its issue? Chilling and opaque as the fog that\r\nfiltered through the skylight there flooded my imagination a mist of\r\ndoubt and fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA spy!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated blankly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Why did you wire to me?\r\nA spy of what\xe2\x80\x94of whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how I worked it out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think \xe2\x80\x98spy\xe2\x80\x99\r\nis the right word; but I mean something pretty bad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe purposely put me ashore. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m suspicious by nature,\r\nbut I know something about boats and the sea. I know he could have kept\r\nclose to me if he had chosen, and I saw the whole place at low water\r\nwhen we left those sands on the second day. Look at the chart again.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn bank that I showed you as blocking the road. _[See\r\nChart A]_ It\xe2\x80\x99s in two pieces\xe2\x80\x94first the west and then the east. You see\r\nthe Telte channel dividing into two branches and curving round it. Both\r\nbranches are broad and deep, as channels go in those waters. Now, in\r\nsailing in I was nowhere near either of them. When I last saw Dollmann\r\nhe must have been steering straight for the bank itself, at a point\r\nsomewhere _here_, quite a mile from the northern arm of the channel,\r\nand two from the southern. I followed by compass, as you know, and\r\nfound nothing but breakers ahead. How did I get through? That\xe2\x80\x99s where\r\nthe luck came in. I spoke of only two channels, that is, _round_ the\r\nbank\xe2\x80\x94one to the north, the other to the south. But look closely and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see that right through the centre of the West Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn runs\r\nanother, a very narrow and winding one, so small that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nnoticed it the night before, when I was going over the chart. That was\r\nthe one I stumbled into in that tailor\xe2\x80\x99s fashion, as I was groping\r\nalong the edge of the surf in a desperate effort to gain time. I bolted\r\ndown it blindly, came out into this strip of open water, crossed that\r\naimlessly, and brought up on the edge of the _East_ Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn, _here_.\r\nIt was more than I deserved. I can see now that it was a hundred to one\r\nin favour of my striking on a bad place outside, where I should have\r\ngone to pieces in three minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did Dollmann go?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as clear as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Davies answered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doubled back into the\r\nnorthern channel when he had misled me enough. Do you remember my\r\nsaying that when I last saw him I _thought_ he had luffed and showed\r\nhis broadside? I had another bit of luck in that. He was luffing\r\ntowards the north\xe2\x80\x94so it struck me through the blur\xe2\x80\x94and when I in my\r\nturn came up to the bank, and had to turn one way or the other to avoid\r\nit, I think I should naturally have turned north too, as he had done.\r\nIn that case I should have been done for, for I should have had a mile\r\nof the bank to skirt before reaching the north channel, and should have\r\ndriven ashore long before I got there. But as a matter of fact I turned\r\nsouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I was running on the starboard tack\xe2\x80\x94boom over to\r\nport; to turn north would have meant a jibe, and as things were I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t risk one. It was blowing like fits; if anything had carried\r\naway I should have been on shore in a jiffy. I scarcely thought about\r\nit at all, but put the helm down and turned her south. Though I knew\r\nnothing about it, that little central channel was now on my port hand,\r\ndistant about two cables. The whole thing was luck from beginning to\r\nend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelped by pluck, I thought to myself, as I tried with my landsman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfancy to conjure up that perilous scene. As to the truth of the affair,\r\nthe chart and Davies\xe2\x80\x99s version were easy enough to follow, but I felt\r\nonly half convinced. The \xe2\x80\x9cspy\xe2\x80\x9d, as Davies strangely called his pilot,\r\nmight have honestly mistaken the course himself, outstripped his convoy\r\ninadvertently, and escaped disaster as narrowly as she did. I suggested\r\nthis on the spur of the moment, but Davies was impatient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till you hear the whole thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go back to when\r\nI first met him. I told you that on that first evening he began by\r\nbeing as rude as a bear and as cold as stone, and then became suddenly\r\nfriendly. I can see now that in the talk that followed he was pumping\r\nme hard. It was an easy game to play, for I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen a gentleman\r\nsince Morrison left me, I was tremendously keen about my voyage, and I\r\nthought the chap was a good sportsman, even if he was a bit dark about\r\nthe ducks. I talked quite freely\xe2\x80\x94at least, as freely as I could with my\r\nbad German\xe2\x80\x94about my last fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s sailing; how I had been smelling\r\nout all the channels in and out of the islands, how interested I had\r\nbeen in the whole business, puzzling out the effect of the winds on the\r\ntides, the set of the currents, and so on. I talked about my\r\ndifficulties, too; the changes in the buoys, the prehistoric rottenness\r\nof the English charts. He drew me out as much as he could, and in the\r\nlight of what followed I can see the point of scores of his questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day and the next I saw a good deal of him, and the same thing\r\nwent on. And then there were my plans for the future. My idea was, as I\r\ntold you, to go on exploring the German coast just as I had the Dutch.\r\nHis idea\xe2\x80\x94Heavens, how plainly I see it now!\xe2\x80\x94was to choke me off, get me\r\nto clear out altogether from that part of the coast. That was why he\r\nsaid there were no ducks. That was why he cracked up the Baltic as a\r\ncruising-ground and shooting-ground. And that was why he broached and\r\nstuck to that plan of sailing in company direct to the Elbe. It was to\r\n_see_ me clear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe improved on that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but after that, it\xe2\x80\x99s guess-work. I mean that I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell when he\r\nfirst decided to go one better and drown me. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t count for\r\ncertain on bad weather, though he held my nose to it when it came. But,\r\ngranted that he wanted to get rid of me altogether, he got a\r\nmagnificent chance on that trip to the Elbe lightship. I expect it\r\nstruck him suddenly, and he acted on the impulse. Left to myself I was\r\nall right; but the short cut was a grand idea of his. Everything was in\r\nits favour\xe2\x80\x94wind, sea, sand, tide. He thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the crew?\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat about the crew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another thing. When he first hove to, waiting for me, of course\r\nthey were on deck (two of them, I think) hauling at sheets. But by the\r\ntime I had drawn up level the _Medusa_ had worn round again on her\r\ncourse, and no one was on deck but Dollmann at the wheel. No one\r\noverheard what he said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they have _seen_ you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely not; the weather was very thick, and the _Dulce_ is very\r\nsmall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe incongruity of the whole business was striking me. Why should\r\nanyone want to kill Davies, and why should Davies, the soul of modesty\r\nand simplicity, imagine that anyone wanted to kill him? He must have\r\ncogent reasons, for he was the last man to give way to a morbid fancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was his motive? A German finds an Englishman\r\nexploring a bit of German coast, determines to stop him, and even to\r\nget rid of him. It looks so far as if you were thought to be the spy.\r\n\r\nDavies winced. \xe2\x80\x9c_But he\xe2\x80\x99s not a German_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, hotly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nEnglishman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn Englishman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it. Not that I\xe2\x80\x99ve much to go on. He professed to know\r\nvery little English, and never spoke it, except a word or two now and\r\nthen to help me out of a sentence; and as to his German, he seemed to\r\nme to speak it like a native; but, of course, I\xe2\x80\x99m no judge.\xe2\x80\x9d Davies\r\nsighed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where I wanted someone like you. You would have spotted\r\nhim at once, if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t German. I go more by a\xe2\x80\x94what do you call\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral impression,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean. It was something in his looks and manner; you\r\nknow how different we are from foreigners. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t only himself,\r\nit was the way he talked\xe2\x80\x94I mean about cruising and the sea, especially.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s true he let me do most of the talking; but, all the same\xe2\x80\x94how can I\r\nexplain it? I felt we understood one another, in a way that two\r\nforeigners wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe pretended to think me a bit crazy for coming so far in a small\r\nboat, but I could swear he knew as much about the game as I did; for\r\nlots of little questions he asked had the right ring in them. Mind you,\r\nall this is an afterthought. I should never have bothered about it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot cut out for a Sherlock Holmes\xe2\x80\x94if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for what followed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather vague,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you no more definite reason for\r\nthinking him English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were one or two things rather more definite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies,\r\nslowly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know when he hove to and hailed me, proposing the short\r\ncut, I told you roughly what he said. I forget the exact words, but\r\n\xe2\x80\x98abschneiden\xe2\x80\x99 came in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98durch Watten\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98abschneiden\xe2\x80\x99 (they call the\r\nbanks \xe2\x80\x98watts\xe2\x80\x99, you know); they were simple words, and he shouted them\r\nloud, so as to carry through the wind. I understood what he meant, but,\r\nas I told you, I hesitated before consenting. I suppose he thought I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, for just as he was drawing ahead again he pointed to\r\nthe suth\xe2\x80\x99ard, and then shouted through his hands as a trumpet\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Verstehen Sie? short-cut through sands: follow me!\xe2\x80\x99 the last two\r\nsentences in downright English. I can hear those words now, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nswear they were in his native tongue. Of course I thought nothing of it\r\nat the time. I was quite aware that he knew a few English words, though\r\nhe had always mispronounced them; an easy trick when your hearer\r\nsuspects nothing. But I needn\xe2\x80\x99t say that just then I was observant of\r\ntrifles. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be able to unravel a plot and steer a small\r\nboat before a heavy sea at the same moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he was piloting you into the next world he could afford to\r\ncommit himself before you parted! Was there anything else? By the way,\r\nhow did the daughter strike you? Did she look English too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo men cannot discuss a woman freely without a deep foundation of\r\nintimacy, and, until this day, the subject had never arisen between us\r\nin any form. It was the last that was likely to, for I could have\r\ndivined that Davies would have met it with an armour of reserve. He was\r\nbusy putting on this armour now; yet I could not help feeling a little\r\nbrutal as I saw how badly he jointed his clumsy suit of mail. Our ages\r\nwere the same, but I laugh now to think how old and _blas\xc3\xa9_ I felt as\r\nthe flush warmed his brown skin, and he slowly propounded the verdict,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think she did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe _talked_ nothing but German, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see much of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d (how frame it?) \xe2\x80\x9cDid she want you to sail to the Elbe with\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe seemed to,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Davies, reluctantly, clutching at his ally,\r\nthe match-box. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, hang it, don\xe2\x80\x99t dream that she knew what was\r\ncoming,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with sudden fire.\r\n\r\nI pondered and wondered, shrinking from further inquisition, easy as it\r\nwould have been with so truthful a victim, and banishing all thought of\r\nill-timed chaff. There was a cross-current in this strange affair,\r\nwhose depth and strength I was beginning to gauge with increasing\r\nseriousness. I did not know my man yet, and I did not know myself. A\r\nconviction that events in the near future would force us into complete\r\nmutual confidence withheld me from pressing him too far. I returned to\r\nthe main question; who was Dollmann, and what was his motive? Davies\r\nstruggled out of his armour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m convinced,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\xe2\x80\x99s an Englishman in German service.\r\nHe must be in German service, for he had evidently been in those waters\r\na long time, and knew every inch of them; of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very lonely\r\npart of the world, but he has a house on Norderney Island; and he, and\r\nall about him, must be well known to a certain number of people. One of\r\nhis friends I happened to meet; what do you think he was? A naval\r\nofficer. It was on the afternoon of the third day, and we were having\r\ncoffee on the deck of the _Medusa_, and talking about next day\xe2\x80\x99s trip,\r\nwhen a little launch came buzzing up from seaward, drew alongside, and\r\nthis chap I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking of came on board, shook hands with Dollmann, and\r\nstared hard at me. Dollmann introduced us, calling him Commander von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning, in command of the torpedo gunboat _Blitz_. He pointed towards\r\nNorderney, and I saw her\xe2\x80\x94a low, grey rat of a vessel\xe2\x80\x94anchored in the\r\nRoads about two miles away. It turned out that she was doing the work\r\nof fishery guardship on that part of the coast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say I took to him at once. He looked a real good sort, and a\r\nsplendid officer, too\xe2\x80\x94just the sort of chap I should have liked to be.\r\nYou know I always wanted\xe2\x80\x94but that\xe2\x80\x99s an old story, and can wait. I had\r\nsome talk with him, and we got on capitally as far as we went, but that\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t far, for I left pretty soon, guessing that they wanted to be\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Were_ they alone then?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, innocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Dollmann was there, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Davies, feeling\r\nfor his armour again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he seem to know them well?\xe2\x80\x9d I pursued, inconsequently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScenting a faint clue, I felt the need of feminine weapons for my\r\nsensitive antagonist. But the opportunity passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the last I saw of him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe sailed, as I told you,\r\nat daybreak next morning. Now, have you got any idea what I\xe2\x80\x99m driving\r\nat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rough idea,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies sat up to the table, unrolled the chart with a vigorous sweep of\r\nhis two hands, and took up his parable with new zest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI start with two certainties,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne is that I was \xe2\x80\x98moved on\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfrom that coast, because I was too inquisitive. The other is that\r\nDollmann is at some devil\xe2\x80\x99s work there which is worth finding out.\r\nNow\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he paused in a gasping effort to be logical and articulate.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x94well, look at the chart. No, better still, look first at this map\r\nof Germany. It\xe2\x80\x99s on a small scale, and you can see the whole thing.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nsnatched down a pocket-map from the shelf and unfolded it. _[See Map\r\nA]_ \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s this huge empire, stretching half over central Europe\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nempire growing like wildfire, I believe, in people, and wealth, and\r\neverything. They\xe2\x80\x99ve licked the French, and the Austrians, and are the\r\ngreatest military power in Europe. I wish I knew more about all that,\r\nbut what I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned with is their sea-power. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new thing with\r\nthem, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going strong, and that Emperor of theirs is running it\r\nfor all it\xe2\x80\x99s worth. He\xe2\x80\x99s a splendid chap, and anyone can see he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got no colonies to speak of, and _must_ have them, like\r\nus. They can\xe2\x80\x99t get them and keep them, and they can\xe2\x80\x99t protect their\r\nhuge commerce without naval strength. The command of the sea is _the_\r\nthing nowadays, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I say, don\xe2\x80\x99t think these are my ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, na\xc3\xafvely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all out of Mahan and those fellows. Well, the\r\nGermans have got a small fleet at present, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a thundering good\r\none, and they\xe2\x80\x99re building hard. There\xe2\x80\x99s the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94and the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d He broke off\r\ninto a digression on armaments and speeds in which I could not follow\r\nhim. He seemed to know every ship by heart. I had to recall him to the\r\npoint. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, think of Germany as a new sea-power,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nnext thing is, what is her coast-line? It\xe2\x80\x99s a very queer one, as you\r\nknow, split clean in two by Denmark, most of it lying east of that and\r\nlooking on the Baltic, which is practically an inland sea, with its\r\nentrance blocked by Danish islands. It was to evade that block that\r\nWilliam built the ship canal from Kiel to the Elbe, but that could be\r\neasily smashed in war-time. Far the most important bit of coast-line is\r\nthat which lies _west_ of Denmark and looks on the North Sea. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthere that Germany gets her head out into the open, so to speak. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthere that she fronts us and France, the two great sea-powers of\r\nWestern Europe, and it\xe2\x80\x99s there that her greatest ports are and her\r\nrichest commerce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it must strike you at once that it\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculously short compared\r\nwith the huge country behind it. From Borkum to the Elbe, as the crow\r\nflies, is only seventy miles. Add to that the west coast of Schleswig,\r\nsay 120 miles. Total, say, two hundred. Compare that with the seaboard\r\nof France and England. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it stand to reason that every inch of it\r\nis important? Now what _sort_ of coast is it? Even on this small map\r\nyou can see at once, by all those wavy lines, shoals and sand\r\neverywhere, blocking nine-tenths of the land altogether, and doing\r\ntheir best to block the other tenth where the great rivers run in. Now\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s take it bit by bit. You see it divides itself into three.\r\nBeginning from the west the _first piece_ is from Borkum to\r\nWangeroog\xe2\x80\x94fifty odd miles. What\xe2\x80\x99s that like? A string of sandy islands\r\nbacked by sand; the Ems river at the western end, on the Dutch border,\r\nleading to Emden\xe2\x80\x94not much of a place. Otherwise, no coast towns at all.\r\n_Second piece:_ a deep sort of bay consisting of the three great\r\nestuaries\xe2\x80\x94the Jade, the Weser and the Elbe\xe2\x80\x94leading to Wilhelmshaven\r\n(their North Sea naval base), Bremen, and Hamburg; total breadth of\r\nbay, twenty odd miles only; sandbanks littered about all through it.\r\n_Third piece:_ the Schleswig coast, hopelessly fenced in behind a six\r\nto eight mile fringe of sand. No big towns; one moderate river, the\r\nEider. Let\xe2\x80\x99s leave that third piece aside. I may be wrong, but, in\r\nthinking this business out, I\xe2\x80\x99ve pegged away chiefly at the other two,\r\nthe seventy-mile stretch from Borkum to the Elbe\xe2\x80\x94half of it estuaries,\r\nand half islands. It was there that I found the _Medusa_, and it\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nstretch that, thanks to him, I missed exploring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made an obvious conjecture. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose there are forts and coast\r\ndefences? Perhaps he thought you would see too much. By the way, he saw\r\nyour naval books, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. Of course that was my first idea; but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be that. It\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t explain things in the least. To begin with, there _are_ no\r\nforts and can be none in that first division, where the islands are.\r\nThere might be something on Borkum to defend the Ems; but it\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nunlikely, and, anyway, I had passed Borkum and was at Norderney.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else to defend. Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s different in the second\r\ndivision, where the big rivers are. There are probably hosts of forts\r\nand mines round Wilhelmshaven and Bremerhaven, and at Cuxhaven just at\r\nthe mouth of the Elbe. Not that I should ever dream of bothering about\r\nthem; every steamer that goes in would see as much as me. Personally, I\r\nmuch prefer to stay on board, and don\xe2\x80\x99t often go on shore. And, good\r\nHeavens!\xe2\x80\x9d (Davies leant back and laughed joyously) \xe2\x80\x9cdo I _look_ like\r\nthat kind of spy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI figured to myself one of those romantic gentlemen that one reads of\r\nin sixpenny magazines, with a Kodak in his tie-pin, a sketch-book in\r\nthe lining of his coat, and a selection of disguises in his hand\r\nluggage. Little disposed for merriment as I was, I could not help\r\nsmiling, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout this coast,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the event of war it seems to me\r\nthat every inch of it would be important, _sand and all._ Take the big\r\nestuaries first, which, of course, might be attacked or blockaded by an\r\nenemy. At first sight you would say that their main channels were the\r\nonly things that mattered. Now, in time of peace there\xe2\x80\x99s no secrecy\r\nabout the navigation of these. They\xe2\x80\x99re buoyed and lighted like streets,\r\nopen to the whole world, and taking an immense traffic; well charted,\r\ntoo, as millions of pounds in commerce depend on them. But now look at\r\nthe sands they run through, intersected, as I showed you, by threads of\r\nchannels, tidal for the most part, and probably only known to smacks\r\nand shallow coasters, like that galliot of Bartels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes me that in a war a lot might depend on these, both in\r\ndefence and attack, for there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of water in them at the right\r\ntide for patrol-boats and small torpedo craft, though I can see they\r\ntake a lot of knowing. Now, say _we_ were at war with Germany\xe2\x80\x94both\r\nsides could use them as lines between the three estuaries; and to take\r\nour own case, a small torpedo-boat (not a destroyer, mind you) could on\r\na dark night cut clean through from the Jade to the Elbe and play the\r\ndeuce with the shipping there. But the trouble is that I doubt if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a soul in our fleet who knows those channels. _We_ haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncoasters there; and, as to yachts, it\xe2\x80\x99s a most unlikely game for an\r\nEnglish yacht to play at; but it does so happen that I have a fancy for\r\nthat sort of thing and would have explored those channels in the\r\nordinary course.\xe2\x80\x9d I began to see his drift.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for the islands. I was rather stumped there at first, I grant,\r\nbecause, though there are lashings of sand behind them, and the same\r\nsort of intersecting channels, yet there seems nothing important to\r\nguard or attack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a stranger ramble as he pleases through them? Still\r\nDollmann had his headquarters there, and I was sure that had some\r\nmeaning. Then it struck me that the same point held good, for that\r\nstrip of Frisian coast adjoins the estuaries, and would also form a\r\nsplendid base for raiding midgets, which could travel unseen right\r\nthrough from the Ems to the Jade, and so to the Elbe, as by a covered\r\nway between a line of forts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow here again it\xe2\x80\x99s an unknown land to us. Plenty of local galliots\r\ntravel it, but strangers never, I should say. Perhaps at the most an\r\noccasional foreign yacht gropes in at one of the gaps between the\r\nislands for shelter from bad weather, and is precious lucky to get in\r\nsafe. Once again, it was my fad to like such places, and Dollmann\r\ncleared me out. He\xe2\x80\x99s not a German, but he\xe2\x80\x99s in with Germans, and naval\r\nGermans too. He\xe2\x80\x99s established on that coast, and knows it by heart. And\r\nhe tried to drown me. Now what do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d He gazed at me long and\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nI Sign Articles\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not an easy question to answer, for the affair was utterly\r\noutside all my experience; its background the sea, and its actual scene\r\na region of the sea of which I was blankly ignorant. There were other\r\ndifficulties that I could see perhaps better than Davies, an enthusiast\r\nwith hobbies, who had been brooding in solitude over his dangerous\r\nadventure. Yet both narrative and theory (which have lost, I fear, in\r\ninterpretation to the reader) had strongly affected me; his forcible\r\nroughnesses, tricks of manner, sudden bursts of ardour, sudden retreats\r\ninto shyness, making up a charm I cannot render. I found myself\r\ncontinually trying to see the man through the boy, to distinguish sober\r\njudgement from the hot-headed vagaries of youth. Not that I dreamed for\r\na moment of dismissing the story of his wreck as an hallucination. His\r\nclear blue eyes and sane simplicity threw ridicule on such treatment.\r\n\r\nEvidently, too, he wanted my help, a matter that might well have\r\ninfluenced my opinion on the facts, had he been other than he was. But\r\nit would have taken a \xe2\x80\x9cfinished and finite clod\xe2\x80\x9d to resist the\r\nattraction of the man and the enterprise; and I take no credit whatever\r\nfor deciding to follow him, right or wrong. So, when I stated my\r\ndifficulties, I knew very well that we should go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two main points that I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve never explained why an _Englishman_ should be watching those\r\nwaters and ejecting intruders; secondly, your theory doesn\xe2\x80\x99t supply\r\nsufficient motive. There may be much in what you say about the\r\nnavigation of those channels, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough. You say he wanted to\r\ndrown you\xe2\x80\x94a big charge, requiring a big motive to support it. But I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t deny that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a strong case.\xe2\x80\x9d Davies lighted up. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nwilling to take a good deal for granted\xe2\x80\x94until we find out more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe jumped up, and did a thing I never saw him do before or since\xe2\x80\x94bumped\r\nhis head against the cabin roof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that you\xe2\x80\x99ll come?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even asked\r\nyou! Yes, I want to go back and clear up the whole thing. I know now\r\nthat I want to; telling it all to you has been such an immense relief.\r\nAnd a lot depended on you, too, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve been feeling such\r\nan absolute hypocrite. I say, how can I apologise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry about me; I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a splendid time. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll come right\r\nenough; but I should like to know exactly what you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but wait till I just make a clean breast of it\xe2\x80\x94about you, I mean.\r\nYou see, I came to the conclusion that I could do nothing alone; not\r\nthat two are really necessary for managing the boat in the ordinary\r\nway, but for this sort of job you _do_ want two; besides, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak\r\nGerman properly, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a dull chap all round. If my theory, as you\r\ncall it, is right, it\xe2\x80\x99s a case for sharp wits, if ever there was one;\r\nso I thought of you. You\xe2\x80\x99re clever, and I knew you had lived in Germany\r\nand knew German, and I knew,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a little awkwardness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat you had done a good deal of yachting; but of course I ought to\r\nhave told you what you were in for\xe2\x80\x94roughing it in a small boat with no\r\ncrew. I felt ashamed of myself when you wired back so promptly, and\r\nwhen you came\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Davies stammered and hesitated in the humane\r\nresolve not to wound my feelings. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help noticing\r\nthat it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what you expected,\xe2\x80\x9d was the delicate summary he arrived\r\nat. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you took it splendidly,\xe2\x80\x9d he hastened to add. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly, somehow, I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring myself to talk about the plan. It was good enough of you\r\nto come out at all, without bothering you with hare-brained schemes.\r\nBeside, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even sure of myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tangled business. There\r\nwere reasons, there are reasons still\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he looked nervously at\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhich\xe2\x80\x94well, which make it a tangled business.\xe2\x80\x9d I had thought a\r\nconfidence was coming, and was disappointed. \xe2\x80\x9cI was in an idiotic state\r\nof uncertainty,\xe2\x80\x9d he hurried on; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the plan grew on me more and more,\r\nwhen I saw how you were taking to the life and beginning to enjoy\r\nyourself. All that about the ducks on the Frisian coast was humbug;\r\npart of a stupid idea of decoying you there and gaining time. However,\r\nyou quite naturally objected, and last night I meant to chuck the whole\r\nthing up and give you the best time here I could. Then Bartels turned\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d I put in. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you know he might turn up when you sailed here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, guiltily. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew he might; and now it\xe2\x80\x99s all come\r\nout, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll come! What a fool I\xe2\x80\x99ve been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLong before he had finished I had grasped the whole meaning of the last\r\nfew days, and had read their meaning into scores of little incidents\r\nwhich had puzzled me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t apologise,\xe2\x80\x9d I protested. \xe2\x80\x9cI could make\r\nconfessions, too, if I liked. And I doubt if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been such a fool as\r\nyou think. I\xe2\x80\x99m a patient that wants careful nursing, and it has been\r\nthe merest chance all through that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t rebelled and bolted. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a good deal to thank the weather for, and other little stimulants.\r\nAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet my reasons for deciding to try your cure at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy cure?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat in the world do you mean? It was jolly\r\ndecent of you to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind! There\xe2\x80\x99s another view of it, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter now.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s return to the point. What\xe2\x80\x99s your plan of action?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s this,\xe2\x80\x9d was the prompt reply: \xe2\x80\x9cto get back to the North Sea, _via_\r\nKiel and the ship canal. Then there will be two objects: one, to work\r\nback to Norderney, where I left off before, exploring all those\r\nchannels through the estuaries and islands; the other, to find\r\nDollmann, discover what he\xe2\x80\x99s up to, and settle with him. The two things\r\nmay overlap, we can\xe2\x80\x99t tell yet. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know where he and his\r\nyacht are; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound they\xe2\x80\x99re somewhere in those same waters,\r\nand probably back at Norderney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a delicate matter,\xe2\x80\x9d I mused, dubiously, \xe2\x80\x9cif your theory\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncorrect. Spying on a spy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who likes can\r\nsail about there and explore those waters. I say, you don\xe2\x80\x99t really\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s like that, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to do anything dishonourable,\xe2\x80\x9d I hastened\r\nto explain. \xe2\x80\x9cI grant you the sea\xe2\x80\x99s public property in your sense. I\r\nonly mean that developments are possible, which you don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon on.\r\nThere _must_ be more to find out than the mere navigation of those\r\nchannels, and if that\xe2\x80\x99s so, mightn\xe2\x80\x99t we come to be genuine spies\r\nourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, after all, hang it!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cif it comes to that, why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we? I look at it like this. The man\xe2\x80\x99s an Englishman, and if\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s in with Germany he\xe2\x80\x99s a traitor to us, and we as Englishmen have a\r\nright to expose him. If we can\xe2\x80\x99t do it without spying we\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to\r\nspy, at our own risk\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a stronger argument than that. He tried to take your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a rap about that. I\xe2\x80\x99m not such an ass as to thirst for\r\nrevenge and all that, like some chap in a shilling shocker. But it\r\nmakes me wild to think of that fellow masquerading as a German, and up\r\nto who knows what mischief\xe2\x80\x94mischief enough to make him want to get rid\r\nof _any_ one. I\xe2\x80\x99m keen about the sea, and I think they\xe2\x80\x99re apt to be a\r\nbit slack at home,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued inconsequently. \xe2\x80\x9cThose Admiralty chaps\r\nwant waking up. Anyway, as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite natural\r\nthat I should look him up again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite,\xe2\x80\x9d I agreed; \xe2\x80\x9cyou parted friends, and they may be delighted to\r\nsee you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty to talk about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, withered into silence by the \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo! I say,\r\ndo you know it\xe2\x80\x99s three o\xe2\x80\x99clock? How the time has gone! And, by Jove! I\r\nbelieve the fog\xe2\x80\x99s lifting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI returned, with a shock, to the present, to the weeping walls, the\r\ndiscoloured deal table, the ghastly breakfast litter\xe2\x80\x94all the visible\r\nsymbols of the life I had pledged myself to. Disillusionment was making\r\nrapid headway when Davies returned, and said, with energy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to starting for Kiel at once? The fog\xe2\x80\x99s going, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a breeze from the sou\xe2\x80\x99-west.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow?\xe2\x80\x9d I protested. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99ll mean sailing all night, won\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cNot with luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s dark at seven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s only twenty-five miles. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a fair\r\nwind, but we shall lie closehauled most of the way. The glass is\r\nfalling, and we ought to take this chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo argue about winds with Davies was hopeless, and the upshot was that\r\nwe started lunchless. A pale sun was flickering out of masses of racing\r\nvapour, and through delicate vistas between them the fair land of\r\nSchleswig now revealed and now withdrew her pretty face, as though\r\nsmiling _adieux_ to her faithless courtiers.\r\n\r\nThe clank of our chain brought up Bartels to the deck of the\r\n_Johannes_, rubbing his eyes and pulling round his throat a grey shawl,\r\nwhich gave him a comical likeness to a lodging-house landlady receiving\r\nthe milk in morning _d\xc3\xa9shabill\xc3\xa9._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re off, Bartels,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, without looking up from his work.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee you at Kiel, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are always in a hurry, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d bleated the old man, shaking his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should wait till to-morrow. The sky is not good, and it will\r\nbe dark before you are off Eckenf\xc3\xb6rde.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies laughed, and very soon his mentor\xe2\x80\x99s sad little figure was lost\r\nin haze.\r\n\r\nThat was a curious evening. Dusk soon fell, and the devil made a\r\ndetermined effort to unman me; first, with the scrambled tea which was\r\nthe tardy substitute for an orderly lunch, then with the new and\r\nnauseous duty of filling the side-lights, which meant squatting in the\r\nfo\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99sle to inhale paraffin and dabble in lamp-black; lastly, with an\r\nall-round attack on my nerves as the night fell on our frail little\r\nvessel, pitching on her precarious way through driving mist. In a sense\r\nI think I went through the same sort of mental crisis as when I sat\r\nupon my portmanteau at Flensburg. The main issue was not seriously in\r\nquestion, for I had signed on in the _Dulcibella_ for good or ill; but\r\nin doing so I had outrun myself, and still wanted an outlook, a mood\r\nsuited to the enterprise, proof against petty discouragements. Not for\r\nthe first time a sense of the ludicrous came to my assistance, as I saw\r\nmyself fretting in London under my burden of self-imposed woes, nicely\r\nweighing that insidious invitation, and stepping finally into the snare\r\nwith the dignity due to my importance; kidnapped as neatly as ever a\r\npeaceful clerk was kidnapped by a lawless press-gang, and, in the end,\r\nfinding as the arch-conspirator a guileless and warm-hearted friend,\r\nwho called me clever, lodged me in a cell, and blandly invited me to\r\ntalk German to the purpose, as he was aiming at a little secret service\r\non the high seas. Close in the train of Humour came Romance, veiling\r\nher face, but I knew it was the rustle of her robes that I heard in the\r\nfoam beneath me; I knew that it was she who handed me the cup of\r\nsparkling wine and bade me drink and be merry. Strange to me though it\r\nwas, I knew the taste when it touched my lips. It was not that bastard\r\nconcoction I had tasted in the pseudo-Bohemias of Soho; it was not the\r\nshowy but insipid beverage I should have drunk my fill of at Morven\r\nLodge; it was the purest of her pure vintages, instilling the ancient\r\ninspiration which, under many guises, quickens thousands of better\r\nbrains than mine, but whose essence is always the same; the gay pursuit\r\nof a perilous quest. Then and there I tried to clinch the matter and\r\nkeep that mood. In the main I think I succeeded, though I had many\r\nlapses.\r\n\r\nFor the present my veins tingled with the draught. The wind humming\r\ninto the mainsail, the ghostly wave-crests riding up out of the void,\r\nwhispered a low thrilling chorus in praise of adventure. Potent indeed\r\nmust the spell have been, for, in reality, that first night sail teemed\r\nwith terrors for me. It is true that it began well, for the haze\r\ndispersed, as Davies had prophesied, and Bulk Point Lighthouse guided\r\nus safely to the mouth of Kiel Fiord. It was during this stage that,\r\ncrouching together aft, our pipe-bowls glowing sympathetically, we\r\nreturned to the problem before us; for we had shot out on our quest\r\nwith volcanic precipitation, leaving much to be discussed. I gleaned a\r\nfew more facts, though I dispelled no doubts. Davies had only seen the\r\nDollmanns on their yacht, where father and daughter were living for the\r\ntime. Their villa at Norderney, and their home life there, were unknown\r\nto him, though he had landed once at the harbour himself. Further, he\r\nhad heard vaguely of a stepmother, absent at Hamburg. They were to have\r\njoined her on their arrival at that city, which, be it noted, stands a\r\nlong way up the Elbe, forty miles and more above Cuxhaven, the town at\r\nthe mouth.\r\n\r\nThe exact arrangement made on the day before the fatal voyage was that\r\nthe two yachts should meet in the evening at Cuxhaven and proceed up\r\nthe river together. Then, in the ordinary course, Davies would have\r\nparted company at Brunsb\xc3\xbcttel (fifteen miles up), which is the western\r\nterminus of the ship canal to the Baltic. Such at least had been his\r\noriginal intention; but, putting two and two together, I gathered that\r\nlatterly, and perhaps unconfessed to himself, his resolve had weakened,\r\nand that he would have followed the _Medusa_ to Hamburg, or indeed the\r\nend of the world, impelled by the same motive that, contrary to all his\r\ntastes and principles, had induced him to abandon his life in the\r\nislands and undertake the voyage at all. But on that point he was\r\nimmovably reticent, and all I could conclude was that the strange\r\ncross-current connected with Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s daughter had given him cruel\r\npain and had clouded his judgement to distraction, but that he now was\r\nprepared to forget or ignore it, and steer a settled course.\r\n\r\nThe facts I elicited raised several important questions. Was it not\r\nknown by this time that he and his yacht had survived? Davies was\r\nconvinced that it was not. \xe2\x80\x9cHe may have waited at Cuxhaven, or inquired\r\nat the lock at Brunsb\xc3\xbcttel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there was no need, for I\r\ntell you the thing was a certainty. If I had struck and _stuck_ on that\r\nouter bank, as it was a hundred to one I should do, the yacht would\r\nhave broken up in three minutes. Bartels would never have seen me, and\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have got to me if he had. No one would have seen me. And\r\nnothing whatever has happened since to show that they know I\xe2\x80\x99m alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are \xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99? Who are our adversaries?\xe2\x80\x9d If\r\nDollmann were an accredited agent of the German Admiralty\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 But, no, it\r\nwas incredible that the murder of a young Englishman should be connived\r\nat in modern days by a friendly and civilised government! Yet, if he\r\nwere not such an agent, the whole theory fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Dollmann did it off his own bat, and\r\nbeyond that I can\xe2\x80\x99t see. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it matters at present.\r\nAlive or dead we\xe2\x80\x99re doing nothing wrong, and have nothing to be ashamed\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it matters a good deal,\xe2\x80\x9d I objected. \xe2\x80\x9cWho will be interested\r\nin our resurrection, and how are we to go to work, openly or secretly?\r\nI suppose we shall keep out of the way as much as we can?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for keeping out of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, jerkily, as he peered to\r\nwindward under the foresail, \xe2\x80\x9cwe _must_ pass the ship canal; that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npublic highway, where anyone can see you. After that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nmuch difficulty. Wait till you see the place!\xe2\x80\x9d He gave a low, contented\r\nlaugh, which would have frozen my marrow yesterday. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, that\r\nreminds me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must stop at Kiel for the inside of a day\r\nand lay in a lot of stores. We want to be independent of the shore.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid nothing. Independence of the shore in a seven-tonner in October!\r\nWhat an end to aim at!\r\n\r\nAbout nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock we weathered the point, entered Kiel Fiord, and\r\nbegan a dead beat to windward of seven miles to the head of it where\r\nKiel lies. Hitherto, save for the latent qualms concerning my total\r\nhelplessness if anything happened to Davies, interest and excitement\r\nhad upheld me well. My alarms only began when I thought them nearly\r\nover. Davies had frequently urged me to turn in and sleep, and I went\r\nso far as to go below and coil myself up on the lee sofa with my pencil\r\nand diary. Suddenly there was a flapping and rattling on deck, and I\r\nbegan to slide on to the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, in a panic,\r\nfor there was Davies stooping in at the cabin door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, chafing his hands for warmth; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only going\r\nabout. Hand me the glasses, will you? There\xe2\x80\x99s a steamer ahead. I say,\r\nif you really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to turn in, you might make some soup. Just\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s look at the chart.\xe2\x80\x9d He studied it with maddening deliberation,\r\nwhile I wondered how near the steamer was, and what the yacht was doing\r\nmeanwhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s not really necessary for anyone to be at the helm?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she\xe2\x80\x99s all right for a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without looking up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo\xe2\x80\x94one and a half\xe2\x80\x94one\xe2\x80\x94lights in line sou\xe2\x80\x99-west by west\xe2\x80\x94got a match?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe expended two, and tumbled upstairs again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want me, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but come up when you\xe2\x80\x99ve put the kettle on. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty beat up\r\nthe fiord. Lovely breeze.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis legs disappeared. A sort of buoyant fatalism possessed me as I\r\nfinished my notes and pored over the stove. It upheld me, too, when I\r\nwent on deck and watched the \xe2\x80\x9cpretty beat\xe2\x80\x9d, whose prettiness was mainly\r\ndue to the crowd of fog-bound shipping\xe2\x80\x94steamers, smacks, and\r\nsailing-vessels\xe2\x80\x94now once more on the move in the confined fairway of\r\nthe fiord, their baleful eyes of red, green, or yellow, opening and\r\nshutting, brightening and fading; while shore-lights and anchor-lights\r\nadded to my bewilderment, and a throbbing of screws filled the air like\r\nthe distant roar of London streets. In fact, every time we spun round\r\nfor our dart across the fiord I felt like a rustic matron gathering her\r\nskirts for the transit of the Strand on a busy night. Davies, however,\r\nwas the street arab who zigzags under the horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet unscathed; and\r\nall the time he discoursed placidly on the simplicity and safety of\r\nnight-sailing if only you are careful, obeying rules, and burnt good\r\nlights. As we were nearing the hot glow in the sky that denoted Kiel we\r\npassed a huge scintillating bulk moored in mid-stream. \xe2\x80\x9cWarships,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmurmured, ecstatically.\r\n\r\nAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock we anchored off the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nHis Chance\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9chow long do you think this trip will last?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve only got a month\xe2\x80\x99s leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were standing at slanting desks in the Kiel post-office, Davies\r\nscratching diligently at his letter-card, and I staring feebly at mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, with a start of dismay; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s only three\r\nweeks more; I never thought of that. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage to get an\r\nextension, could you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can write to the chief,\xe2\x80\x9d I admitted; \xe2\x80\x9cbut where\xe2\x80\x99s the answer to come\r\nto? We\xe2\x80\x99re better without an address, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Cuxhaven,\xe2\x80\x9d reflected Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s too near, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94but we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be tied down to landing anywhere. I tell\r\nyou what: say \xe2\x80\x98Post Office, Norderney\xe2\x80\x99, just your name, not the\r\nyacht\xe2\x80\x99s. We _may_ get there and be able to call for letters.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ncasual character of our adventure never struck me more strongly than\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what _you\xe2\x80\x99re_ doing?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be having important letters like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you saying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just that we\xe2\x80\x99re having a splendid cruise, and are on our way\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe notion tickled me, and I said the same in my home letter, adding\r\nthat we were looking for a friend of Davies\xe2\x80\x99s who would be able to show\r\nus some sport. I wrote a line, too, to my chief (unaware of the gravity\r\nof the step I was taking) saying it was possible that I might have to\r\napply for longer leave, as I had important business to transact in\r\nGermany, and asking him kindly to write to the same address. Then we\r\nshouldered our parcels and resumed our business.\r\n\r\nTwo full dinghy-loads of stores we ferried to the _Dulcibella_, chief\r\namong which were two immense cans of petroleum, constituting our\r\nreserves of heat and light, and a sack of flour. There were spare ropes\r\nand blocks, too; German charts of excellent quality; cigars and many\r\nweird brands of sausage and tinned meats, besides a miscellany of\r\noddments, some of which only served in the end to slake my companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncraving for jettison. Clothes were my own chief care, for, freely as I\r\nhad purged it at Flensburg, my wardrobe was still very unsuitable, and\r\nI had already irretrievably damaged two faultless pairs of white\r\nflannels. (\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be able to throw them overboard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies,\r\nhopefully.) So I bought a great pair of seaboots of the country,\r\nfelt-lined and wooden-soled, and both of us got a number of rough\r\nwoollen garments (as worn by the local fishermen), breeches, jerseys,\r\nhelmets, gloves; all of a colour chosen to harmonise with paraffin\r\nstains and anchor mud.\r\n\r\nThe same evening we were taking our last look at the Baltic, sailing\r\npast warships and groups of idle yachts battened down for their\r\nwinter\xe2\x80\x99s sleep; while the noble shores of the fiord, with its villas\r\nembowered in copper foliage, grew dark and dim above us.\r\n\r\nWe rounded the last headland, steered for a galaxy of coloured lights,\r\ntumbled down our sails, and came to under the colossal gates of the\r\nHoltenau lock. That these would open to such an infinitesimal suppliant\r\nseemed inconceivable. But open they did, with ponderous majesty, and\r\nour tiny hull was lost in the womb of a lock designed to float the\r\nlargest battleships. I thought of Boulter\xe2\x80\x99s on a hot August Sunday, and\r\nwondered if I really was the same peevish dandy who had jostled and\r\nsweltered there with the noisy cockney throng a month ago. There was a\r\nblaze of electricity overhead, but utter silence till a solitary\r\ncloaked figure hailed us and called for the captain. Davies ran up a\r\nladder, disappeared with the cloaked figure, and returned crumpling a\r\npaper into his pocket. It lies before me now, and sets forth, under the\r\nstamp of the K\xc3\xb6nigliches Zollamt, that, in consideration of the sum of\r\nten marks for dues and four for tonnage, an imperial tug would tow the\r\nvessel _Dulcibella_ (master A. H. Davies) through the Kaiser Wilhelm\r\ncanal from Holtenau to Brunsb\xc3\xbcttel. Magnificent condescension! I blush\r\nwhen I look at this yellow document and remember the stately courtesy\r\nof the great lock-gates; for the sleepy officials of the K\xc3\xb6nigliches\r\nZollamt little knew what an insidious little viper they were admitting\r\ninto the imperial bosom at the light toll of fourteen shillings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeems cheap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, joining me, \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? They\xe2\x80\x99ve a regular\r\ntariff on tonnage, same for yachts as for liners. We start at four\r\nto-morrow with a lot of other boats. I wonder if Bartels is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe same silence reigned, but invisible forces were at work. The inner\r\ngates opened and we prised ourselves through into a capacious basin,\r\nwhere lay moored side by side a flotilla of sailing vessels of various\r\nsizes. Having made fast alongside a vacant space of quay, we had our\r\ndinner, and then strolled out with cigars to look for the _Johannes_.\r\nWe found her wedged among a stack of galliots, and her skipper sitting\r\nprimly below before a blazing stove, reading his Bible through\r\nspectacles. He produced a bottle of schnapps and some very small and\r\nhard pears, while Davies twitted him mercilessly about his false\r\npredictions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sky was not good,\xe2\x80\x9d was all he said, beaming indulgently at his\r\nincorrigible young friend.\r\n\r\nBefore parting for the night it was arranged that next morning we\r\nshould lash alongside the _Johannes_ when the flotilla was marshalled\r\nfor the tow through the canal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKarl shall steer for us both,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand we will stay warm in the\r\ncabin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scheme was carried out, not without much confusion and loss of\r\npaint, in the small hours of a dark and drizzling morning. Boisterous\r\nlittle tugs sorted us into parties, and half lost under the massive\r\nbulwarks of the _Johannes_ we were carried off into a black inane. If\r\nany doubt remained as to the significance of our change of\r\ncruising-grounds, dawn dispelled it. View there was none from the deck\r\nof the _Dulcibella_; it was only by standing on the mainboom that you\r\ncould see over the embankments to the vast plain of Holstein, grey and\r\nmonotonous under a pall of mist. The soft scenery of the Schleswig\r\ncoast was a baseless dream of the past, and a cold penetrating rain\r\nadded the last touch of dramatic completeness to the staging of the new\r\nact.\r\n\r\nFor two days we travelled slowly up the mighty waterway that is the\r\nstrategic link between the two seas of Germany. Broad and straight,\r\nmassively embanked, lit by electricity at night till it is lighter than\r\nmany a great London street; traversed by great war vessels, rich\r\nmerchantmen, and humble coasters alike, it is a symbol of the new and\r\nmighty force which, controlled by the genius of statesmen and\r\nengineers, is thrusting the empire irresistibly forward to the goal of\r\nmaritime greatness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it splendid?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a fine fellow, that emperor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKarl was the shock-headed, stout-limbed boy of about sixteen, who\r\nconstituted the whole crew of the _Johannes_, and was as dirty as his\r\nmaster was clean. I felt a certain envious reverence for this\r\nunprepossessing youth, seeing in him a much more efficient counterpart\r\nof myself; but how he and his little master ever managed to work their\r\nungainly vessel was a miracle I never understood. Phlegmatically\r\nimpervious to rain and cold, he steered the _Johannes_ down the long\r\ngrey reaches in the wake of the tug, while we and Bartels held snug\r\ngatherings down below, sometimes in his cabin, sometimes in ours. The\r\nheating arrangements of the latter began to be a subject of serious\r\nconcern. We finally did the only logical thing, and brought the\r\nkitchen-range into the parlour, fixing the Rippingille stove on the\r\nforward end of the cabin table, where it could warm as well as cook for\r\nus. As an ornament it was monstrous, and the taint of oil which it\r\nintroduced was a disgusting drawback; but, after all, the great\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94as Davies said\xe2\x80\x94is to be comfortable, and after that to be clean.\r\n\r\nDavies held long consultations with Bartels, who was thoroughly at home\r\nin the navigation of the sands we were bound for, his own boat being a\r\ntype of the very craft which ply in them. I shall not forget the moment\r\nwhen it first dawned on him that his young friend\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity was\r\npractical; for he had thought that our goal was his own beloved\r\nHamburg, queen of cities, a place to see and die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late,\xe2\x80\x9d he wailed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know the Nord See as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nonsense, Bartels, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafe! And have I not found you fast on Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn, in a storm, with\r\nyour rudder broken? God was good to you then, my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my f\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Davies checked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going home.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in that.\xe2\x80\x9d Bartels became sadly resigned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is good that you have a friend,\xe2\x80\x9d was his last word on the subject;\r\nbut all the same he always glanced at me with a rather doubtful eye. As\r\nto Davies and myself, our friendship developed quickly on certain\r\nlimited lines, the chief obstacle, as I well know now, being his\r\nreluctance to talk about the personal side of our quest.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I spoke about my own life and interests, with an\r\nunsparing discernment, of which I should have been incapable a month\r\nago, and in return I gained the key to his own character. It was\r\ndevotion to the sea, wedded to a fire of pent-up patriotism struggling\r\nincessantly for an outlet in strenuous physical expression; a humanity,\r\nborn of acute sensitiveness to his own limitations, only adding fuel to\r\nthe flame. I learnt for the first time now that in early youth he had\r\nfailed for the navy, the first of several failures in his career. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t settle down to anything else,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI read no end about\r\nit, and yet I am a useless outsider. All I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to do is to\r\npotter about in small boats; but it\xe2\x80\x99s all been _wasted_ till this\r\nchance came. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll not understand how I feel about it; but\r\nat last, for once in a way, I see a chance of being useful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ought to be chances for chaps like you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout the\r\naccident of a job such as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as long as I get it, what matter? But I know what you mean. There\r\nmust be hundreds of chaps like me\xe2\x80\x94I know a good many myself\xe2\x80\x94who know\r\nour coasts like a book\xe2\x80\x94shoals, creeks, tides, rocks; there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in\r\nit, it\xe2\x80\x99s only practice. They ought to make some use of us as a naval\r\nreserve. They tried to once, but it fizzled out, and nobody really\r\ncares. And what\xe2\x80\x99s the result? Using every man of what reserves we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot, there\xe2\x80\x99s about enough to man the fleet on a war footing, and no\r\nmore. They\xe2\x80\x99ve tinkered with fishermen, and merchant sailors, and\r\nyachting hands, but everyone of them ought to be got hold of; and the\r\ncolonies, too. Is there the ghost of a doubt that if war broke out\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99d be wild appeals for volunteers, aimless cadging, hurry,\r\nconfusion, waste? My own idea is that we ought to go much further, and\r\ntrain every able-bodied man for a couple of years as a sailor. Army?\r\nOh, I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d have to give them the choice. Not that I know or\r\ncare much about the Army, though to listen to people talk you\xe2\x80\x99d think\r\nit really mattered as the Navy matters. We\xe2\x80\x99re a maritime nation\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngrown by the sea and live by it; if we lose command of it we starve.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re unique in that way, just as our huge empire, only linked by the\r\nsea, is unique. And yet, read Brassey, Dilke, and those _Naval\r\nAnnuals_, and see what mountains of apathy and conceit have had to be\r\ntackled. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the people\xe2\x80\x99s fault. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been safe so long, and\r\ngrown so rich, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten what we owe it to. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nexcuse for those blockheads of statesmen, as they call themselves, who\r\nare paid to see things as they are. They have to go to an American to\r\nlearn their A B C, and it\xe2\x80\x99s only when kicked and punched by civilian\r\nagitators, a mere handful of men who get sneered at for their pains,\r\nthat they wake up, do some work, point proudly to it, and go to sleep\r\nagain, till they get another kick. By Jove! we want a man like this\r\nKaiser, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to be kicked, but works like a nigger for his\r\ncountry, and sees ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re improving, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course, we are! But it\xe2\x80\x99s a constant uphill fight; and we aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nready. They talk of a two-power standard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He plunged away into\r\nregions where space forbids me to follow him. This is only a sample of\r\nmany similar conversations that we afterwards held, always culminating\r\nin the burning question of Germany. Far from including me and the\r\nForeign Office among his targets for vague invective, he had a profound\r\nrespect for my sagacity and experience as a member of that institution;\r\na respect which embarrassed me not a little when I thought of my\r\n_pr\xc3\xa9cis_ writing and cigarette-smoking, my dancing, and my dining. But\r\nI did know something of Germany, and could satisfy his tireless\r\nquestioning with a certain authority. He used to listen rapt while I\r\ndescribed her marvellous awakening in the last generation, under the\r\nstrength and wisdom of her rulers; her intense patriotic ardour; her\r\nseething industrial activity, and, most potent of all, the forces that\r\nare moulding modern Europe, her dream of a colonial empire, entailing\r\nher transformation from a land-power to a sea-power. Impregnably based\r\non vast territorial resources which we cannot molest, the dim instincts\r\nof her people, not merely directed but anticipated by the genius of her\r\nruling house, our great trade rivals of the present, our great naval\r\nrival of the future, she grows, and strengthens, and waits, an ever\r\nmore formidable factor in the future of our delicate network of empire,\r\nsensitive as gossamer to external shocks, and radiating from an island\r\nwhose commerce is its life, and which depends even for its daily ration\r\nof bread on the free passage of the seas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready for her,\xe2\x80\x9d Davies would say; \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t look her\r\nway. We have no naval base in the North Sea, and no North Sea Fleet.\r\nOur best battleships are too deep in draught for North Sea work. And,\r\nto crown all, we were asses enough to give her Heligoland, which\r\ncommands her North Sea coast. And supposing she collars Holland; isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthere some talk of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat would lead me to describe the swollen ambitions of the\r\nPan-Germanic party, and its ceaseless intrigues to promote the\r\nabsorption of Austria, Switzerland, and\xe2\x80\x94a direct and flagrant menace to\r\nourselves\xe2\x80\x94of Holland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, who, for all his patriotism, had not\r\na particle of racial spleen in his composition. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame them;\r\ntheir Rhine ceases to be German just when it begins to be most\r\nvaluable. The mouth is Dutch, and would give them magnificent ports\r\njust opposite British shores. _We_ can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about conquest and\r\ngrabbing. We\xe2\x80\x99ve collared a fine share of the world, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve every\r\nright to be jealous. Let them hate us, and say so; it\xe2\x80\x99ll teach us to\r\nbuck up; and that\xe2\x80\x99s what really matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn these talks there occurred a singular contact of minds. It was very\r\nwell for me to spin sonorous generalities, but I had never till now\r\ndreamed of being so vulgar as to translate them into practice. I had\r\nalways detested the meddlesome alarmist, who veils ignorance under\r\nnoisiness, and for ever wails his chant of lugubrious pessimism. To be\r\nthrown with Davies was to receive a shock of enlightenment; for here,\r\nat least, was a specimen of the breed who exacted respect. It is true\r\nhe made use of the usual jargon, interlarding his stammering sentences\r\n(sometimes, when he was excited, with the oddest effect) with the\r\nconventional catchwords of the journalist and platform speaker. But\r\nthese were but accidents; for he seemed to have caught his innermost\r\nconviction from the very soul of the sea itself. An armchair critic is\r\none thing, but a sunburnt, brine-burnt zealot smarting under a personal\r\ndiscontent, athirst for a means, however tortuous, of contributing his\r\neffort to the great cause, the maritime supremacy of Britain, that was\r\nquite another thing. He drew inspiration from the very wind and spray.\r\nHe communed with his tiller, I believe, and marshalled his figures with\r\nits help. To hear him talk was to feel a current of clarifying air\r\nblustering into a close club-room, where men bandy ineffectual\r\nplatitudes, and mumble old shibboleths, and go away and do nothing.\r\n\r\nIn our talk about policy and strategy we were Bismarcks and Rodneys,\r\nwielding nations and navies; and, indeed, I have no doubt that our\r\nfancy took extravagant flights sometimes. In plain fact we were merely\r\ntwo young gentlemen in a seven-ton pleasure boat, with a taste for\r\namateur hydrography and police duty combined. Not that Davies ever\r\ndoubted. Once set on the road he gripped his purpose with child-like\r\nfaith and tenacity. It was his \xe2\x80\x9cchance\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nThe Pathfinders\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon of the second day our flotilla reached the Elbe\r\nat Brunsb\xc3\xbcttel and ranged up in the inner basin, while a big liner,\r\nwhimpering like a fretful baby, was tenderly nursed into the lock.\r\nDuring the delay Davies left me in charge, and bolted off with an\r\noil-can and a milk-jug. An official in uniform was passing along the\r\nquay from vessel to vessel countersigning papers. I went up to meet him\r\nwith our receipt for dues, which he signed carelessly. Then he paused\r\nand muttered _\xe2\x80\x9cDooltzhibella,\xe2\x80\x9d_ scratching his head, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was the\r\nname. English?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle _lust-cutter_, that is so; there was an inquiry for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend of yours from a big barge-yacht.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know; she went on to Hamburg, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo such luck, captain; she was outward bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat did the man mean? He seemed to be vastly amused by something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen was this\xe2\x80\x94about three weeks ago?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, indifferently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree weeks? It was the day before yesterday. What a pity to miss him\r\nby so little!\xe2\x80\x9d He chuckled and winked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he leave any message?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a lady who inquired,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the fellow, sniggering. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nreally,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, beginning to feel highly absurd, but keenly curious.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she inquired about the _Dulcibella_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerrgott! she was difficult to satisfy! Stood over me while I searched\r\nthe books. \xe2\x80\x98A very little one,\xe2\x80\x99 she kept saying, and \xe2\x80\x98Are you sure all\r\nthe names are here?\xe2\x80\x99 I saw her into her kleine Boot, and she rowed away\r\nin the rain. No, she left no message. It was dirty weather for a young\r\nFr\xc3\xa4ulein to be out alone in. Ach! she was safe enough, though. To see\r\nher crossing the ebb in a chop of tide was a treat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the yacht went on down the river? Where was she bound to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know? Bremen, Wilhelmshaven, Emden\xe2\x80\x94somewhere in the North\r\nSea; too far for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, bravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch! you will not follow in _that_? Are not you bound to Hamburg?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can change our plans. It seems a pity to have missed them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink twice, captain, there are plenty of pretty girls in Hamburg. But\r\nyou English will do anything. Well, viel Gl\xc3\xbcck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved on, chuckling, to the next boat. Davies soon returned with his\r\ncans and an armful of dark, rye loaves, just in time, for, the liner\r\nbeing through, the flotilla was already beginning to jostle into the\r\nlock and Bartels was growing impatient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll last ten days,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as we followed the throng, still\r\nclinging like a barnacle to the side of the _Johannes_. We spent the\r\nfew minutes while the lock was emptied in a farewell talk to Bartels.\r\nKarl had hitched their main halyards on to the windlass and was\r\ngrinding at it in an _acharnement_ of industry, his shock head jerking\r\nand his grubby face perspiring. Then the lock-gates opened; and so, in\r\na Babel of shouting, whining of blocks, and creaking of spars, our\r\nwhole company was split out into the dingy bosom of the Elbe. The\r\n_Johannes_ gathered way under wind and tide and headed for midstream. A\r\nlast shake of the hand, and Bartels reluctantly slipped the head-rope\r\nand we drifted apart. \xe2\x80\x9cGute Reise! Gute Reise!\xe2\x80\x9d It was no time for\r\nregretful gazing, for the flood-tide was sweeping us up and out, and it\r\nwas not until we had set the foresail, edged into a shallow bight, and\r\nlet go our anchor, that we had leisure to think of him again; but by\r\nthat time his and the other craft were shades in the murky east.\r\n\r\nWe swung close to a _glacis_ of smooth blue mud which sloped up to a\r\nweed-grown dyke; behind lay the same flat country, colourless, humid;\r\nand opposite us, two miles away, scarcely visible in the deepening\r\ntwilight, ran the outline of a similar shore. Between rolled the turgid\r\nElbe. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Styx flowing through Tartarus,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to myself,\r\nrecalling some of our Baltic anchorages.\r\n\r\nI told my news to Davies as soon as the anchor was down, instinctively\r\nleaving the sex of the inquirer to the last, as my informant had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _Medusa_ called yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd outward bound?\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a rum thing. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he inquire when he was going _up_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a lady,\xe2\x80\x9d and I drily retailed the official\xe2\x80\x99s story, very busy\r\nwith a deck-broom the while. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all square now, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nended. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go below and light the stove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies had been engaged in fixing up the riding-light. When I last saw\r\nhim he was still so engaged, but motionless, the lantern under his left\r\narm and his right hand grasping the forestay and the half-knotted\r\nlanyard; his eyes staring fixedly down the river, a strange look in his\r\nface, half exultant, half perplexed. When he joined me and spoke he\r\nseemed to be concluding a difficult argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, it proves,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the _Medusa_ has gone back to\r\nNorderney. That\xe2\x80\x99s the main thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably,\xe2\x80\x9d I agreed, \xe2\x80\x9cbut let\xe2\x80\x99s sum up all we know. First, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncertain that nobody we\xe2\x80\x99ve met as yet has any suspicion of _us_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you he did it off his own bat,\xe2\x80\x9d threw in Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, secondly, of _him._ If he\xe2\x80\x99s what you think it\xe2\x80\x99s not known here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirdly, he inquires for you on his way _back_ from Hamburg, three\r\nweeks after the event. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look as if he thought he had disposed\r\nof you\xe2\x80\x94it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look as if he had _meant_ to dispose of you. He sends\r\nhis daughter, too; a curious proceeding under the circumstances.\r\nPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s all a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, half to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut _did_ he send\r\nher? He\xe2\x80\x99d have sent one of his men. He can\xe2\x80\x99t be on board at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a new light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have left the yacht when he got to Hamburg; some other devil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, I suppose. She\xe2\x80\x99s being sailed back now, and passing here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see! It\xe2\x80\x99s a private supplementary inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a long name to call it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould the girl sail back alone with the crew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s used to the sea\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps she isn\xe2\x80\x99t alone. There was that\r\nstepmother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a ha\xe2\x80\x99porth of difference to our plans;\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll start on the ebb to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were busier than usual that night, reckoning stores, tidying\r\nlockers, and securing movables. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must economise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, for\r\nall the world as though we were castaways on a raft. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a wretched\r\nthing to have to land somewhere to buy oil,\xe2\x80\x9d was a favourite\r\nobservation of his.\r\n\r\nBefore getting to sleep I was made to recognise a new factor in the\r\nconditions of navigation, now that the tideless Baltic was left behind\r\nus. A strong current was sluicing past our sides, and at the eleventh\r\nhour I was turned out, clad in pyjamas and oilskins (a horrible\r\ncombination), to assist in running out a kedge or spare anchor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s kedging-off?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, when we were tucked up again. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhen you run aground; you have to\xe2\x80\x94but you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon learn all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI steeled my heart for the morrow.\r\n\r\nSo behold us, then, at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock on October 5, standing down the\r\nriver towards the field of our first labours. It is fifteen miles to\r\nthe mouth; drab, dreary miles like the dullest reaches of the lower\r\nThames; but scenery was of no concern to us, and a south-westerly\r\nbreeze blowing out of a grey sky kept us constantly on the verge of\r\nreefing. The tide as it gathered strength swept us down with a force\r\nattested by the speed with which buoys came in sight, nodded above us\r\nand passed, each boiling in its eddy of dirty foam. I scarcely noticed\r\nat first\xe2\x80\x94so calm was the water, and so regular were the buoys, like\r\nmilestones along a road\xe2\x80\x94that the northern line of coast was rapidly\r\nreceding and that the \xe2\x80\x9criver\xe2\x80\x9d was coming to be but a belt of deep water\r\nskirting a vast estuary, three\xe2\x80\x94seven\xe2\x80\x94ten miles broad, till it merged in\r\nopen sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we\xe2\x80\x99re at sea!\xe2\x80\x9d I suddenly exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cafter an hour\xe2\x80\x99s sailing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust discovered that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said it was fifteen miles,\xe2\x80\x9d I complained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is, till we reach this coast at Cuxhaven; but I suppose you may\r\nsay we\xe2\x80\x99re at sea; of course that\xe2\x80\x99s all sand over there to starboard.\r\nLook! some of it\xe2\x80\x99s showing already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed into the north. Looking more attentively I noticed that\r\noutside the line of buoys patches of the surface heaved and worked; in\r\none or two places streaks and circles of white were forming; in the\r\nmidst of one such circle a sleek mauve hump had risen, like the back of\r\na sleeping whale. I saw that an old spell was enthralling Davies as his\r\neye travelled away to the blank horizon. He scanned it all with a\r\ncritical eagerness, too, as one who looks for a new meaning in an old\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s face. Something of his zest was communicated to me, and\r\nstilled the shuddering thrill that had seized me. The protecting land\r\nwas still a comforting neighbour; but our severance with it came\r\nquickly. The tide whirled us down, and our straining canvas aiding it,\r\nwe were soon off Cuxhaven, which crouched so low behind its mighty\r\ndyke, that of some of its houses only the chimneys were visible. Then,\r\na mile or so on, the shore sharpened to a point like a claw, where the\r\ninnocent dyke became a long, low fort, with some great guns peeping\r\nover; then of a sudden it ceased, retreating into the far south in a\r\ndim perspective of groins and dunes.\r\n\r\nWe spun out into the open and leant heavily over to the now\r\nunobstructed wind. The yacht rose and sank to a little swell, but my\r\nfirst impression was one of wonder at the calmness of the sea, for the\r\nwind blew fresh and free from horizon to horizon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s all sand _there_ now, and we\xe2\x80\x99re under the lee of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDavies, with an enthusiastic sweep of his hand over the sea on our left\r\nor port hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our hunting ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPick up Sticker\xe2\x80\x99s Gat,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt ought to be near Buoy K.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA red buoy with a huge K on it soon came into view. Davies peered over\r\nto port.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust pull up the centreboard, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked abstractedly,\r\nadding, \xe2\x80\x9cand hand me up the glasses as you are down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the glasses. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it now; come to the main-sheet,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nthe next remark.\r\n\r\nHe put down the helm and headed the yacht straight for the troubled and\r\ndiscoloured expanse which covered the submerged sands. A \xe2\x80\x9csleeping\r\nwhale\xe2\x80\x9d, with a light surf splashing on it, was right in our path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by the lead, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, politely. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll manage the\r\nsheets, it\xe2\x80\x99s a dead beat in. Ready about!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wind was in our teeth now, and for a crowded half-hour we wormed\r\nourselves forward by ever-shortening tacks into the sinuous recesses of\r\na channel which threaded the shallows westward. I knelt in a tangle of\r\nline, and, under the hazy impression that something very critical was\r\ngoing on, plied the lead furiously, bumping and splashing myself, and\r\nshouting out the depths, which lessened steadily, with a great sense of\r\nthe importance of my function. Davies never seemed to listen, but\r\ntacked on imperturbably, juggling with the tiller, the sheets, and the\r\nchart, in a way that made one giddy to look at. For all our zeal we\r\nseemed to be making very slow progress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use, tide\xe2\x80\x99s too strong; we must chance it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChance what?\xe2\x80\x9d I wondered to myself. Our tacks suddenly began to grow\r\nlonger, and the depths, which I registered, shallower. All went well\r\nfor some time though, and we made better progress. Then came a longer\r\nreach than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo and a half\xe2\x80\x94two\xe2\x80\x94one and a half\xe2\x80\x94one\xe2\x80\x94only five feet,\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped,\r\nreproachfully. The water was growing thick and frothy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if we do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, thinking aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\neddy here, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity to waste it\xe2\x80\x94ready about! Back the jib!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was too late. The yacht answered but faintly to the helm,\r\nstopped, and heeled heavily over, wallowing and grinding. Davies had\r\nthe mainsail down in a twinkling; it half smothered me as I crouched on\r\nthe lee-side among my tangled skeins of line, scared and helpless. I\r\ncrawled out from the folds, and saw him standing by the mast in a\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not much use,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9con a falling tide, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll try\r\nkedging-off. Pay that warp out while I run out the kedge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike lightning he had cast off the dinghy\xe2\x80\x99s painter, tumbled the\r\nkedge-anchor and himself into the dinghy, pulled out fifty yards into\r\nthe deeper water, and heaved out the anchor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow haul,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\r\n\r\nI hauled, beginning to see what kedging-off meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady on! Don\xe2\x80\x99t sweat yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, jumping aboard again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s coming,\xe2\x80\x9d I spluttered, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe warp is, the yacht isn\xe2\x80\x99t; you\xe2\x80\x99re dragging the anchor home. Never\r\nmind, she\xe2\x80\x99ll lie well here. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe yacht was motionless, and the water round her visibly lower.\r\nPetulant waves slapped against her sides, but, scattered as my senses\r\nwere, I realised that there was no vestige of danger. Round us the\r\nwhole face of the waters was changing from moment to moment, whitening\r\nin some places, yellowing in others, where breadths of sand began to be\r\nexposed. Close on our right the channel we had left began to look like\r\na turbid little river; and I understood why our progress had been so\r\nslow when I saw its current racing back to meet the Elbe. Davies was\r\nalready below, laying out a more than usually elaborate lunch, in high\r\ncontent of mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLies quiet, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you _do_ want a sit-down\r\nlunch, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like running aground for it. And, anyhow, we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nas handy for work here as anywhere else. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike most landsmen I had a wholesome prejudice against running aground,\r\nso that my mentor\xe2\x80\x99s turn for breezy paradox was at first rather\r\nexasperating. After lunch the large-scale chart of the estuaries was\r\nbrought down, and we pored over it together, mapping out work for the\r\nnext few days. There is no need to tire the general reader with its\r\nintricacies, nor is there space to reproduce it for the benefit of the\r\ninstructed reader. For both classes the general map should be\r\nsufficient, taken with the large-scale fragment _[See Chart A]_ which\r\ngives a fair example of the region in detail. It will be seen that the\r\nthree broad fairways of the Jade, Weser, and Elbe split up the sands\r\ninto two main groups. The westernmost of these is symmetrical in\r\noutline, an acute-angled triangle, very like a sharp steel-shod pike,\r\nif you imagine the peninsula from which it springs to be the wooden\r\nhaft. The other is a huge congeries of banks, its base resting on the\r\nHanover coast, two of its sides tolerably clean and even, and the\r\nthird, that facing the north-west, ribboned and lacerated by the fury\r\nof the sea, which has eaten out deep cavities and struck hungry\r\ntentacles far into the interior. The whole resembles an inverted E, or,\r\nbetter still, a rude fork, on whose three deadly prongs, the Scharhorn\r\nReef, the Knecht Sand, and the Tegeler Flat, as on the no less deadly\r\npoint of the pike, many a good ship splinters herself in northerly\r\ngales. Following this simile, the Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn bank, where Davies was\r\nwrecked, is one of those that lie between the upper and middle prongs.\r\n\r\nOur business was to explore the Pike and the Fork and the channels\r\nwhich ramify through them. I use the general word \xe2\x80\x9cchannel\xe2\x80\x9d, but in\r\nfact they differ widely in character, and are called in German by\r\nvarious names: Balje, Gat, Loch, Diep, Rinne. For my purpose I need\r\nonly divide them into two sorts\xe2\x80\x94those which have water in them at all\r\nstates of the tide, and those which have not, which dry off, that is,\r\neither wholly or partly at low-tide.\r\n\r\nDavies explained that the latter would take most learning, and were to\r\nbe our chief concern, because they were the \xe2\x80\x9cthrough-routes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nconnecting links between the estuaries. You can always detect them on\r\nthe chart by rows of little Y-shaped strokes denoting \xe2\x80\x9cbooms\xe2\x80\x9d, that is\r\nto say, poles or saplings fixed in the sand to mark the passage. The\r\nstrokes, of course, are only conventional signs, and do not correspond\r\nin the least to individual \xe2\x80\x9cbooms\xe2\x80\x9d, which are far too numerous and\r\ncomplex to be indicated accurately on a chart, even of the largest\r\nscale. The same applies to the course of the channels themselves, whose\r\nminor meanderings cannot be reproduced.\r\n\r\nIt was on the edge of one of these tidal swatchways that the yacht was\r\nnow lying. It is called Sticker\xe2\x80\x99s Gat, and you cannot miss it _[See\r\nChart A]_ if you carry your eye westward along our course from\r\nCuxhaven. It was, so Davies told me, the last and most intricate stage\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cshort cut\xe2\x80\x9d which the _Medusa_ had taken on that memorable day\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nstage he himself had never reached. Discussion ended, we went on deck,\r\nDavies arming himself with a notebook, binoculars, and the prismatic\r\ncompass, whose use\xe2\x80\x94to map the angles of the channels\xe2\x80\x94was at last\r\napparent. This is what I saw when we emerged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nMy Initiation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe yacht lay with a very slight heel (thanks to a pair of small\r\nbilge-keels on her bottom) in a sort of trough she had dug for herself,\r\nso that she was still ringed with a few inches of water, as it were\r\nwith a moat.\r\n\r\nFor miles in every direction lay a desert of sand. To the north it\r\ntouched the horizon, and was only broken by the blue dot of Neuerk\r\nIsland and its lighthouse. To the east it seemed also to stretch to\r\ninfinity, but the smoke of a steamer showed where it was pierced by the\r\nstream of the Elbe. To the south it ran up to the pencil-line of the\r\nHanover shore. Only to the west was its outline broken by any vestiges\r\nof the sea it had risen from. There it was astir with crawling white\r\nfilaments, knotted confusedly at one spot in the north-west, whence\r\ncame a sibilant murmur like the hissing of many snakes. Desert as I\r\ncall it, it was not entirely featureless. Its colour varied from light\r\nfawn, where the highest levels had dried in the wind, to brown or deep\r\nviolet, where it was still wet, and slate-grey where patches of mud\r\nsoiled its clean bosom. Here and there were pools of water, smitten\r\ninto ripples by the impotent wind; here and there it was speckled by\r\nshells and seaweed. And close to us, beginning to bend away towards\r\nthat hissing knot in the north-west, wound our poor little channel,\r\nmercilessly exposed as a stagnant, muddy ditch with scarcely a foot of\r\nwater, not deep enough to hide our small kedge-anchor, which perked up\r\none fluke in impudent mockery. The dull, hard sky, the wind moaning in\r\nthe rigging as though crying in despair for a prey that had escaped it,\r\nmade the scene inexpressibly forlorn.\r\n\r\nDavies scanned it with gusto for a moment, climbed to a point of\r\nvantage on the boom, and swept his glasses to and fro along the course\r\nof the channel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFairly well boomed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, meditatively, \xe2\x80\x9cbut one or two are very\r\nmuch out. By Jove! that\xe2\x80\x99s a tricky bend there.\xe2\x80\x9d He took a bearing with\r\nthe compass, made a note or two, and sprang with a vigorous leap down\r\non to the sand.\r\n\r\nThis, I may say, was the only way of \xe2\x80\x9cgoing ashore\xe2\x80\x9d that he really\r\nliked. We raced off as fast as our clumsy sea-boots would let us, and\r\nfollowed up the course of our channel to the west, reconnoitring the\r\nroad we should have to follow when the tide rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only way to learn a place like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cis to see it at\r\nlow water. The banks are dry then, and the channels are plain. Look at\r\nthat boom\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he stopped and pointed contemptuously\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all out of\r\nplace. I suppose the channel\xe2\x80\x99s shifted there. It\xe2\x80\x99s just at an important\r\nbend too. If you took it as a guide when the water was up you\xe2\x80\x99d run\r\naground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich would be very useful,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hang it!\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re exploring. I want to be able to run\r\nthrough this channel without a mistake. We will, next time.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nstopped, and plied compass and notebook. Then we raced on till the next\r\nhalt was called.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, the channel\xe2\x80\x99s getting deeper, it was nearly dry a\r\nmoment ago; see the current in it now? That\xe2\x80\x99s the flood tide coming\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94from the _west,_ mind you; that is, from the Weser side. That shows\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re past the watershed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatershed?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, blankly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I call it. You see, a big sand such as this is like a\r\nrange of hills dividing two plains, it\xe2\x80\x99s never dead flat though it\r\nlooks it; there\xe2\x80\x99s always one point, one ridge, rather, where it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhighest. Now a channel cutting right through the sand is, of course,\r\nalways at its shallowest when it\xe2\x80\x99s crossing this ridge; at low water\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s generally dry there, and it gradually deepens as it gets nearer to\r\nthe sea on either side. Now at high tide, when the whole sand is\r\ncovered, the water can travel where it likes; but directly the ebb sets\r\nin the water falls away on either side the ridge and the channel\r\nbecomes two rivers flowing in opposite directions _from_ the centre, or\r\nwatershed, as I call it. So, also, when the ebb has run out and the\r\nflood begins, the channel is fed by two currents flowing to the centre\r\nand meeting in the middle. Here the Elbe and the Weser are our two\r\nfeeders. Now this current here is going eastwards; we know by the time\r\nof day that the tide\xe2\x80\x99s rising, _therefore_ the watershed is between us\r\nand the yacht.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it so important to know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause these currents are strong, and you want to know when you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlose a fair one and strike a foul one. Besides, the ridge is the\r\ncritical point when you\xe2\x80\x99re crossing on a falling tide, and you want to\r\nknow when you\xe2\x80\x99re past it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe pushed on till our path was barred by a big lagoon. It looked far\r\nmore imposing than the channel; but Davies, after a rapid scrutiny,\r\ntreated it to a grunt of contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a _cul de sac_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSee that hump of sand it\xe2\x80\x99s making for,\r\nbeyond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s boomed,\xe2\x80\x9d I remonstrated, pointing to a decrepit stem drooping\r\nover the bank, and shaking a palsied finger at the imposture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s just where one goes wrong, it\xe2\x80\x99s an old cut that\xe2\x80\x99s silted\r\nup. That boom\xe2\x80\x99s a fraud; there\xe2\x80\x99s no time to go farther, the flood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaking fast. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take bearings of what we can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe false lagoon was the first of several that began to be visible in\r\nthe west, swelling and joining hands over the ribs of sand that divided\r\nthem. All the time the distant hissing grew nearer and louder, and a\r\ndeep, thunderous note began to sound beneath it. We turned our backs to\r\nthe wind and hastened back towards the _Dulcibella_, the stream in our\r\nchannel hurrying and rising alongside of us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s just time to do the other side,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, when we reached\r\nher, and I was congratulating myself on having regained our base\r\nwithout finding our communications cut. And away we scurried in the\r\ndirection we had come that morning, splashing through pools and jumping\r\nthe infant runnels that were stealing out through rifts from the\r\nmother-channel as the tide rose. Our observations completed, back we\r\ntravelled, making a wide circuit over higher ground to avoid the\r\nencroaching flood, and wading shin-deep in the final approach to the\r\nyacht.\r\n\r\nAs I scrambled thankfully aboard, I seemed to hear a far-off voice\r\nsaying, in languid depreciation of yachting, that it did not give one\r\nenough exercise. It was mine, centuries ago, in another life. From east\r\nand west two sheets of water had overspread the desert, each pushing\r\nout tongues of surf that met and fused.\r\n\r\nI waited on deck and watched the death-throes of the suffocating sands\r\nunder the relentless onset of the sea. The last strongholds were\r\nbattered, stormed, and overwhelmed; the tumult of sounds sank and\r\nsteadied, and the sea swept victoriously over the whole expanse. The\r\n_Dulcibella_, hitherto contemptuously inert, began to wake and tremble\r\nunder the buffetings she received. Then, with an effort, she jerked\r\nherself on to an even keel and bumped and strained fretfully, impatient\r\nto vanquish this insolent invader and make him a slave for her own\r\nends. Soon her warp tightened and her nose swung slowly round; only her\r\nstern bumped now, and that with decreasing force. Suddenly she was free\r\nand drifting broadside to the wind till the anchor checked her and she\r\nbrought up to leeward of it, rocking easily and triumphantly.\r\nGood-humoured little person! At heart she was friends alike with sand\r\nand sea. It was only when the old love and the new love were in mortal\r\ncombat for her favours, and she was mauled in the _fracas_, that her\r\ntemper rose in revolt.\r\n\r\nWe swallowed a hasty cup of tea, ran up the sails, and started off west\r\nagain. Once across the \xe2\x80\x9cwatershed\xe2\x80\x9d we met a strong current, but the\r\ntrend of the passage was now more to the north-west, so that we could\r\nhold our course without tacking, and consequently could stem the tide.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive her just a foot of the centre-plate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know the\r\nway here, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll make less leeway; but we shall generally have to\r\ndo without it always on a falling tide. If you run aground with the\r\nplate down you deserve to be drowned.\xe2\x80\x9d I now saw how valuable our walk\r\nhad been. The booms were on our right; but they were broken reeds,\r\ngiving no hint as to the breadth of the channel. A few had lost their\r\ntops, and were being engulfed altogether by the rising water. When we\r\ncame to the point where they ceased, and the false lagoon had lain, I\r\nshould have felt utterly lost. We had crossed the high and relatively\r\nlevel sands which form the base of the Fork, and were entering the\r\nlabyrinth of detached banks which obstruct the funnel-shaped cavity\r\nbetween the upper and middle prongs. This I knew from the chart. My\r\nunaided eye saw nothing but the open sea, growing dark green as the\r\ndepths increased; a dour, threatening sea, showing its white fangs. The\r\nwaves grew longer and steeper, for the channels, though still tortuous,\r\nnow begin to be broad and deep.\r\n\r\nDavies had his bearings, and struck on his course confidently. \xe2\x80\x9cNow for\r\nthe lead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe compass\xe2\x80\x99ll be little use soon. We must feel\r\nthe edge of the sands till we pick up more booms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we going to anchor for the night?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cfor auld lang syne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPartly by sight and mostly by touch we crept round the outermost alley\r\nof the hidden maze till a new clump of booms appeared, meaningless to\r\nme, but analysed by him into two groups. One we followed for some\r\ndistance, and then struck finally away and began another beat to\r\nwindward.\r\n\r\nDusk was falling. The Hanover coast-line, never very distinct, had\r\nutterly vanished; an ominous heave of swell was under-running the short\r\nsea. I ceased to attend to Davies imparting instruction on his beloved\r\nhobby, and sought to stifle in hard manual labour the dread that had\r\nbeen latent in me all day at the prospect of our first anchorage at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSound, like blazes now!\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. I came to a fathom and a\r\nhalf. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the bank,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a bit of a berth and\r\nthen let go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet go now!\xe2\x80\x9d was the order after a minute, and the chain ran out with\r\na long-drawn moan. The _Dulcibella_ snubbed up to it and jauntily faced\r\nthe North Sea and the growing night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere we are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, as we finished stowing the mainsail, \xe2\x80\x9csafe\r\nand snug in four fathoms in a magnificent sand-harbour, with no one to\r\nbother us and the whole of it to ourselves. No dues, no stinks, no\r\ntraffic, no worries of any sort. It\xe2\x80\x99s better than a Baltic cove even,\r\nless beastly civilization about. We\xe2\x80\x99re seven miles from the nearest\r\ncoast, and five even from Neuerk\xe2\x80\x94look, they\xe2\x80\x99re lighting up.\xe2\x80\x9d There was\r\na tiny spark in the east.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99d rather see a solid\r\nbreakwater somewhere; it\xe2\x80\x99s a dirty-looking night, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like this\r\nswell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe swell\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s only a stray drain from\r\noutside. As for breakwaters, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got them all round you, only\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re hidden. Ahead and to starboard is the West Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn, curling\r\nround to the sou\xe2\x80\x99-west for all the world like a stone pier. You can\r\nhear the surf battering on its outside over to the north. That\xe2\x80\x99s where\r\nI was nearly wrecked that day, and the little channel I stumbled into\r\nmust be quite near us somewhere. Half a mile away\xe2\x80\x94to port there\xe2\x80\x94is the\r\nEast Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn, where I brought up, after dashing across this lake\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re in. Another mile astern is the main body of the sands, the top\r\nprong of your fork. So you see we\xe2\x80\x99re shut in\xe2\x80\x94practically. Surely you\r\nremember the chart? Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, confound the chart!\xe2\x80\x9d I broke out, finding this flow of plausible\r\ncomfort too dismally suggestive for my nerves. \xe2\x80\x9c_Look_ at it, man!\r\nSupposing anything happens\xe2\x80\x94supposing it blows a gale! But it\xe2\x80\x99s no good\r\nshivering here and staring at the view. I\xe2\x80\x99m going below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a _mauvais quart d\xe2\x80\x99heure_ below, during which, I am ashamed\r\nto say, I forgot the quest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich soup do you feel inclined for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, timidly, after a\r\nblack silence of some minutes.\r\n\r\nThat simple remark, more eloquent of security than a thousand technical\r\narguments, saved the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a white-livered cur at the best, and you\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t spare me. But you\xe2\x80\x99re not like any yachtsman I ever met before,\r\nor any sailor of any sort. You\xe2\x80\x99re so casual and quiet in the\r\nextraordinary things you do. I believe I should like you better if you\r\nlet fly a volley of deep-sea oaths sometimes, or threatened to put me\r\nin irons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies opened wide eyes, and said it was all his fault for forgetting\r\nthat I was not as used to such anchorages as he was. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, by the way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, \xe2\x80\x9cas to its blowing a gale, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if it did; the\r\nglass is falling hard; but it can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt us. You see, even at high\r\nwater the drift of the sea\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t begin again. You\xe2\x80\x99ll prove soon that we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsafer here than in an hotel. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have dinner, and a thundering good\r\none!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDinner ran a smooth course, but just as coffee was being brewed the\r\nhull, from pitching regularly, began to roll.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew she would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cI was going to warn you, only\xe2\x80\x94the ebb\r\nhas set in _against_ the wind. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite safe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you said it would get calmer when the tide fell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it will, but it may _seem_ rougher. Tides are queer things,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, as though in defence of some not very respectable acquaintances.\r\n\r\nHe busied himself with his logbook, swaying easily to the motion of the\r\nboat; and I for my part tried to write up my diary, but I could not fix\r\nmy attention. Every loose article in the boat became audibly restless.\r\nCans clinked, cupboards rattled, lockers uttered hollow groans. Small\r\nthings sidled out of dark hiding-places, and danced grotesque drunken\r\nfigures on the floor, like goblins in a haunted glade. The mast whined\r\ndolorously at every heel, and the centreboard hiccoughed and choked.\r\nOverhead another horde of demons seemed to have been let loose. The\r\ndeck and mast were conductors which magnified every sound and made the\r\ntap-tap of every rope\xe2\x80\x99s end resemble the blows of a hammer, and the\r\nslapping of the halyards against the mast the rattle of a Maxim gun.\r\nThe whole tumult beat time to a rhythmical chorus which became\r\nmaddening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might turn in now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s half-past ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, sleep through this?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stand this, I must\r\n_do_ something. Can\xe2\x80\x99t we go for another walk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI spoke in bitter, half-delirious jest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a bit of a tumble\r\nin the dinghy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI reconsidered my rash suggestion, but it was too late now to turn\r\nback, and some desperate expedient was necessary. I found myself on\r\ndeck, gripping a backstay and looking giddily down and then up at the\r\ndinghy, as it bobbed like a cork in the trough of the sea alongside,\r\nwhile Davies settled the sculls and rowlocks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJump!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, and before I could gather my wits and clutch the\r\nsides we were adrift in the night, reeling from hollow to hollow of the\r\nsteep curling waves. Davies nursed our walnut-shell tenderly over their\r\ncrests, edging her slantwise across their course. He used very little\r\nexertion, relying on the tide to carry us to our goal. Suddenly the\r\nmotion ceased. A dark slope loomed up out of the night, and the dinghy\r\nrested softly in a shallow eddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe West Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. We jumped out and sank into soft\r\nmud, hauled up the dinghy a foot or two, then mounted the bank and were\r\non hard, wet sand. The wind leapt on us, and choked our voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s find my channel,\xe2\x80\x9d bawled Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cThis way. Keep Neuerk light\r\nright astern of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe set off with a long, stooping stride in the teeth of the wind, and\r\nstraight towards the roar of the breakers on the farther side of the\r\nsand. A line of Matthew Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cThe naked shingles of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas running in my head. \xe2\x80\x9cSeven miles from land,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cscuttling\r\nlike sea-birds on a transient islet of sand, encircled by rushing tides\r\nand hammered by ocean, at midnight in a rising gale\xe2\x80\x94cut off even from\r\nour one dubious refuge.\xe2\x80\x9d It was the time, if ever, to conquer weakness.\r\nA mad gaiety surged through me as I drank the wind and pressed forward.\r\nIt seemed but a minute or two and Davies clutched me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my channel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ground sloped down, and a rushing river glimmered before us. We\r\nstruck off at a tangent and followed its course to the north, stumbling\r\nin muddy rifts, slipping on seaweed, beginning to be blinded by a fine\r\nsalt spray, and deafened by the thunder of the ocean surf. The river\r\nbroadened, whitened, roughened, gathered itself for the shock, was\r\nshattered, and dissolved in milky gloom. We wheeled away to the right,\r\nand splashed into yeasty froth. I turned my back to the wind, scooped\r\nthe brine out of my eyes, faced back and saw that our path was barred\r\nby a welter of surf. Davies\xe2\x80\x99s voice was in my ear and his arm was\r\npointing seaward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94about where\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94bumped first\xe2\x80\x94worse then\xe2\x80\x94nor\xe2\x80\x99-west\r\nwind\xe2\x80\x94this\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94nothing. Let\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94go\xe2\x80\x94right\xe2\x80\x94round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe galloped away with the wind behind us, skirting the line of surf. I\r\nlost all account of time and direction. Another sea barred our road,\r\nbecame another river as we slanted along its shore. Again we were in\r\nthe teeth of that intoxicating wind. Then a point of light was swaying\r\nand flickering away to the left, and now we were checking and circling.\r\nI stumbled against something sharp\xe2\x80\x94the dinghy\xe2\x80\x99s gunwale. So we had\r\ncompleted the circuit of our fugitive domain, that\r\ndream-island\xe2\x80\x94nightmare island as I always remember it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must scull, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blowing hard now. Keep her\r\nnose _up_ a little\xe2\x80\x94all you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe lurched along, my scull sometimes buried to the thwart, sometimes\r\nstriking at the bubbles of a wave top. Davies, in the bows, said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cSteady!\xe2\x80\x9d at intervals. I heard the scud smacking against\r\nhis oilskin back. Then a wan, yellow light glanced over the waves.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasy! Let her come!\xe2\x80\x9d and the bowsprit of the _Dulcibella_, swollen to\r\nspectral proportions, was stabbing the darkness above me. \xe2\x80\x9cBack a bit!\r\nTwo good strokes. Ship your scull! Now jump!\xe2\x80\x9d I clawed at the tossing\r\nhull and landed in a heap. Davies followed with the painter, and the\r\ndinghy swept astern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s riding beautifully now,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when he had secured the\r\npainter. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll be no rolling on the flood, and it\xe2\x80\x99s nearly low\r\nwater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should have cared, however much she had rolled. I was\r\nfinally cured of funk.\r\n\r\nIt was well that I was, for to be pitched out of your bunk on to wet\r\noil-cloth is a disheartening beginning to a day. This happened about\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The yacht was pitching violently, and I crawled on all\r\nfours into the cabin, where Davies was setting out breakfast on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI let you sleep on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything till the water\r\nfalls. We should never get the anchor up in this sea. Come and have a\r\nlook round. It\xe2\x80\x99s clearing now,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, when we were crouching low\r\non deck, gripping cleats for safety. \xe2\x80\x9cWind\xe2\x80\x99s veered to nor\xe2\x80\x99-west. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen blowing a full gale, and the sea is at its worst now\xe2\x80\x94near high\r\nwater. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never see worse than this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was prepared for what I saw\xe2\x80\x94the stormy sea for leagues around, and a\r\nchaos of breakers where our dream-island had stood\xe2\x80\x94and took it quietly,\r\neven with a sort of elation. The _Dulcibella_ faced the storm as\r\ndoggedly as ever, plunging her bowsprit into the sea and flinging green\r\nwater over her bows. A wave of confidence and affection for her welled\r\nthrough me. I had been used to resent the weight and bulk of her\r\nunwieldy anchor and cable, but I saw their use now; varnish, paint,\r\nspotless decks, and snowy sails were foppish absurdities of a hateful\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can we do to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must keep well inside the banks and be precious careful wherever\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a swell. It\xe2\x80\x99s rampant in here, you see, in spite of the barrier\r\nof sand. But there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty we can do farther back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted in horrible discomfort; then smoked and talked till the\r\nroar of the breakers dwindled. At the first sign of bare sand we got\r\nunder way, under mizzen and headsails only, and I learned how to sail a\r\nreluctant anchor out of the ground. Pivoting round, we scudded east\r\nbefore the wind, over the ground we had traversed the evening before,\r\nwhile an archipelago of new banks slowly shouldered up above the fast\r\nweakening waves. We trod delicately among and around them, sounding and\r\nobserving; heaving to where space permitted, and sometimes using the\r\ndinghy. I began to see where the risks lay in this sort of navigation.\r\nWherever the ocean swell penetrated, or the wind blew straight down a\r\nlong deep channel, we had to be very cautious and leave good margins.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of place you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t ground on,\xe2\x80\x9d Davies used to say.\r\n\r\nIn the end we traversed the Steil Sand again, but by a different\r\nswatchway, and anchored, after an arduous day, in a notch on its\r\neastern limit, just clear of the swell that rolled in from the\r\nturbulent estuary of the Elbe. The night was fair, and when the tide\r\nreceded we lay perfectly still, the fresh wind only sending a lip-lip\r\nof ripples against our sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nThe Meaning of our Work\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing happened during the next ten days to disturb us at our work.\r\nDuring every hour of daylight and many of darkness, sailing or\r\nanchored, aground or afloat, in rain and shine, wind and calm, we\r\nstudied the bed of the estuaries, and practised ourselves in threading\r\nthe network of channels; holding no communication with the land and\r\nrarely approaching it. It was a life of toil, exposure, and peril; a\r\nstruggle against odds, too; for wild autumnal weather was the rule,\r\nwith the wind backing and veering between the south-west and\r\nnorth-west, and only for two placid days blowing gently from the east,\r\nthe safe quarter for this region. Its force and direction determined\r\neach fresh choice of ground. If it was high and northerly we explored\r\nthe inner fastnesses; in moderate intervals the exterior fringe,\r\ndarting when surprised into whatever lair was most convenient.\r\n\r\nSometimes we were tramping vast solitudes of sand, sometimes scudding\r\nacross ephemeral tracts of shallow sea. Again, we were creeping\r\ngingerly round the deeper arteries that surround the Great Knecht,\r\nexamining their convolutions as it were the veins of a living tissue,\r\nand the circulation of the tide throbbing through them like blood.\r\nAgain, we would be staggering through the tide-rips and overfalls that\r\ninfest the open fairway of the Weser on our passage between the Fork\r\nand the Pike. On one of our fine days I saw the scene of Davies\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noriginal adventure by daylight with the banks dry and the channels\r\nmanifest. The reader has seen it on the chart, and can, up to a point,\r\nform his opinion; I can only add that I realised by ocular proof that\r\nno more fatal trap could have been devised for an innocent stranger;\r\nfor approaching it from the north-west under the easiest conditions it\r\nwas hard enough to verify our true course. In a period so full of new\r\nexcitements it is not easy for me to say when we were hardest put to\r\nit, especially as it was a rule with Davies never to admit that we were\r\nin any danger at all. But I think that our ugliest experience was on\r\nthe 10th, when, owing to some minute miscalculation, we stranded in a\r\ndangerous spot. Mere stranding, of course, was all in the day\xe2\x80\x99s work;\r\nthe constantly recurring question being when and where to court or risk\r\nit. This time we were so situated that when the rising tide came again\r\nwe were on a lee shore, broadside on to a gale of wind which was\r\nsending a nasty sea\xe2\x80\x94with a three-mile drift to give it force\xe2\x80\x94down\r\nRobin\xe2\x80\x99s Balje, which is one of the deeper arteries I spoke of above,\r\nand now lay dead to windward of us. The climax came about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nat night. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can do nothing till she floats,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; and I can\r\nsee him now quietly smoking and splicing a chafed warp while he\r\nexplained that her double skin of teak fitted her to stand anything in\r\nreason. She certainly had a terrific test that night, for the bottom\r\nwas hard, unyielding sand, on which she rose and fell with convulsive\r\nvehemence. The last half-hour was for me one of almost intolerable\r\ntension. I spent it on deck unable to bear the suspense below. Sheets\r\nof driven sea flew bodily over the hull, and a score of times I thought\r\nshe must succumb as she shivered to the blows of her keel on the sand.\r\nBut those stout skins knit by honest labour stood the trial. One final\r\nthud and she wrenched herself bodily free, found her anchor, and rode\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I think we made few mistakes. Davies had a supreme\r\naptitude for the work. Every hour, sometimes every minute, brought its\r\nproblem, and his resource never failed. The stiffer it was the cooler\r\nhe became. He had, too, that intuition which is independent of acquired\r\nskill, and is at the root of all genius; which, to take cases analogous\r\nto his own, is the last quality of the perfect guide or scout. I\r\nbelieve he could _smell_ sand where he could not see or touch it.\r\n\r\nAs for me, the sea has never been my element, and never will be;\r\nnevertheless, I hardened to the life, grew salt, tough, and tolerably\r\nalert. As a soldier learns more in a week of war than in years of\r\nparades and pipeclay, so, cut off from all distractions, moving from\r\nbivouac to precarious bivouac, and depending, to some extent, for my\r\nlife on my muscles and wits, I rapidly learnt my work and gained a\r\ncertain dexterity. I knew my ropes in the dark, could beat economically\r\nto windward through squalls, take bearings, and estimate the\r\ninteraction of wind and tide.\r\n\r\nWe were generally in solitude, but occasionally we met galliots like\r\nthe _Johannes_ tacking through the sands, and once or twice we found a\r\nfleet of such boats anchored in a gut, waiting for water. Their\r\ndraught, loaded, was from six to seven feet, our own only four, without\r\nour centre-plate, but we took their mean draught as the standard of all\r\nour observations. That is, we set ourselves to ascertain when and how a\r\nvessel drawing six and a half feet could navigate the sands.\r\n\r\nA word more as to our motive. It was Davies\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, as I have\r\nsaid, that the whole region would in war be an ideal hunting-ground for\r\nsmall free-lance marauders, and I began to know he was right; for look\r\nat the three sea-roads through the sands to Hamburg, Bremen,\r\nWilhelmshaven, and the heart of commercial Germany. They are like\r\nhighways piercing a mountainous district by defiles, where a handful of\r\ndesperate men can arrest an army.\r\n\r\nFollow the parallel of a war on land. People your mountains with a\r\ndaring and resourceful race, who possess an intimate knowledge of every\r\ntrack and bridle-path, who operate in small bands, travel light, and\r\nmove rapidly. See what an immense advantage such guerillas possess over\r\nan enemy which clings to beaten tracks, moves in large bodies, slowly,\r\nand does not \xe2\x80\x9cknow the country\xe2\x80\x9d. See how they can not only inflict\r\ndisasters on a foe who vastly overmatches them in strength, but can\r\nprolong a semi-passive resistance long after all decisive battles have\r\nbeen fought. See, too, how the strong invader can only conquer his\r\nelusive antagonists by learning their methods, studying the country,\r\nand matching them in mobility and cunning. The parallel must not be\r\npressed too far; but that this sort of warfare will have its\r\ncounterpart on the sea is a truth which cannot be questioned.\r\n\r\nDavies in his enthusiasm set no limits to its importance. The small\r\nboat in shallow waters played a mighty _r\xc3\xb4le_ in his vision of a naval\r\nwar, a part that would grow in importance as the war developed and\r\nreach its height in the final stages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe heavy battle fleets are all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if\r\nthe sides are well matched there might be nothing left of them after a\r\nfew months of war. They might destroy one another mutually, leaving as\r\nnominal conqueror an admiral with scarcely a battleship to bless\r\nhimself with. It\xe2\x80\x99s then that the true struggle will set in; and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthen that anything that will float will be pressed into the service,\r\nand anybody who can steer a boat, knows his waters, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nthe toss of a coin for his life, will have magnificent opportunities.\r\nIt cuts both ways. What small boats can do in these waters is plain\r\nenough; but take our own case. Say we\xe2\x80\x99re beaten on the high seas by a\r\ncoalition. There\xe2\x80\x99s then a risk of starvation or invasion. It\xe2\x80\x99s all rot\r\nwhat they talk about instant surrender. We can live on half rations,\r\nrecuperate, and build; but we must have time. Meanwhile our coast and\r\nports are in danger, for the millions we sink in forts and mines won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncarry us far. They\xe2\x80\x99re fixed\xe2\x80\x94pure passive defence. What you want is\r\n_boats_\xe2\x80\x94mosquitoes with stings\xe2\x80\x94swarms of them\xe2\x80\x94patrol-boats,\r\nscout-boats, torpedo-boats; intelligent irregulars manned by local men,\r\nwith a pretty free hand to play their own game. And what a splendid\r\ngame to play! There are places very like this over there\xe2\x80\x94nothing half\r\nso good, but similar\xe2\x80\x94the Mersey estuary, the Dee, the Severn, the Wash,\r\nand, best of all, the Thames, with all the Kent, Essex, and Suffolk\r\nbanks round it. But as for defending our coasts in the way I mean\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnothing ready\xe2\x80\x94nothing whatsoever! We don\xe2\x80\x99t even build or use small\r\ntorpedo-boats. These fast \xe2\x80\x98destroyers\xe2\x80\x99 are no good for _this_ work\xe2\x80\x94too\r\nlong and unmanageable, and most of them too deep. What you want is\r\nsomething strong and simple, of light draught, and with only a\r\nspar-torpedo, if it came to that. Tugs, launches, small yachts\xe2\x80\x94anything\r\nwould do at a pinch, for success would depend on intelligence, not on\r\nbrute force or complicated mechanism. They\xe2\x80\x99d get wiped out often, but\r\nwhat matter? There\xe2\x80\x99d be no lack of the right sort of men for them if\r\nthe thing was _organised._ But where are the men?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, suppose we have the best of it on the high seas, and have to\r\nattack or blockade a coast like this, which is sand from end to end.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t improvise people who are at home in such waters. The navy\r\nchaps don\xe2\x80\x99t learn it, though, by Jove! they\xe2\x80\x99re the most magnificent\r\nservice in the world\xe2\x80\x94in pluck, and nerve, and everything else. They\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n_try_ anything, and often do the impossible. But their boats are deep,\r\nand they get little practice in this sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies never pushed home his argument here; but I know that it was the\r\npassionate wish of his heart, somehow and somewhere, to get a chance of\r\nturning his knowledge of this coast to practical account in the war\r\nthat he felt was bound to come, to play that \xe2\x80\x9csplendid game\xe2\x80\x9d in this,\r\nthe most fascinating field for it.\r\n\r\nI can do no more than sketch his views. Hearing them as I did, with the\r\nvery splash of the surf and the bubble of the tides in my ears, they\r\nmade a profound impression on me, and gave me the very zeal for our\r\nwork he, by temperament, possessed.\r\n\r\nBut as the days passed and nothing occurred to disturb us, I felt more\r\nand more strongly that, as regards our quest, we were on the wrong\r\ntack. We found nothing suspicious, nothing that suggested a really\r\nadequate motive for Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s treachery. I became impatient, and was\r\nfor pushing on more quickly westward. Davies still clung to his theory,\r\nbut the same feeling influenced him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something to do with these channels in the sand,\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, as you say, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t got at the heart of the\r\nmystery. Nobody seems to care a rap what we do. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t done the\r\nestuaries as well as I should like, but we\xe2\x80\x99d better push on to the\r\nislands. It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the same sort of work, and just as important, I\r\nbelieve. We\xe2\x80\x99re bound to get a clue soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was also the question of time, for me at least. I was due to be\r\nback in London, unless I obtained an extension, on the 28th, and our\r\npresent rate of progress was slow. But I cannot conscientiously say\r\nthat I made a serious point of this. If there was any value in our\r\nenterprise at all, official duty pales beside it. The machinery of\r\nState would not suffer from my absence; excuses would have to be made,\r\nand the results braved.\r\n\r\nAll the time our sturdy little craft grew shabbier and more\r\nweather-worn, the varnish thinner, the decks greyer, the sails dingier,\r\nand the cabin roof more murky where stove-fumes stained it. But the\r\nonly beauty she ever possessed, that of perfect fitness for her\r\nfunctions, remained. With nothing to compare her to she became a home\r\nto me. My joints adapted themselves to her crabbed limits, my tastes\r\nand habits to her plain domestic economy.\r\n\r\nBut oil and water were running low, and the time had come for us to be\r\nforced to land and renew our stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nThe First Night in the Islands\r\n\r\n\r\nA low line of sandhills, pink and fawn in the setting sun, at one end\r\nof them a little white village huddled round the base of a massive\r\nfour-square lighthouse\xe2\x80\x94such was Wangeroog, the easternmost of the\r\nFrisian Islands, as I saw it on the evening of October 15. We had\r\ndecided to make it our first landing-place; and since it possesses no\r\nharbour, and is hedged by a mile of sand at low water, we had run in on\r\nthe rising tide till the yacht grounded, in order to save ourselves as\r\nmuch labour as possible in the carriage to and fro of the heavy\r\nwater-breakers and oil-cans which we had to replenish. In faint outline\r\nthree miles to the south of us was the flat plain of Friesland, broken\r\nonly by some trees, a windmill or two, and a church spire. Between, the\r\nshallow expanse of sea was already beginning to shrink away into\r\nlagoons, chief among which was the narrow passage by which we had\r\napproached from the east. This continued its course west, directly\r\nparallel to the island, and in it, at a distance of half a mile from\r\nus, three galliots lay at anchor.\r\n\r\nBefore supper was over the yacht was high and dry, and when we had\r\neaten, Davies loaded himself with cans and breakers. I was for taking\r\nmy share, but he induced me to stay aboard; for I was dead tired after\r\nan unusually long and trying day, which had begun at 2 a.m., when,\r\nusing a precious instalment of east wind, we had started on a complete\r\npassage of the sands from the Elbe to the Jade. It was a barely\r\npossible feat for a boat of our low speed to perform in only two tides;\r\nand though we just succeeded, it was only by dint of tireless vigilance\r\nand severe physical strain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLay out the anchor when you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a smoke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cand keep an\r\neye on the riding-light; it\xe2\x80\x99s my only guide back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lowered himself, and I heard the scrunch of his sea-boots as he\r\ndisappeared in the darkness. It was a fine starry night, with a touch\r\nof frost in the air. I lit a cigar, and stretched myself on a sofa\r\nclose to the glow of the stove. The cigar soon languished and dropped,\r\nand I dozed uneasily, for the riding-light was on my mind. I got up\r\nonce and squinted at it through the half-raised skylight, saw it\r\nburning steadily, and lay down again. The cabin lamp wanted oil and was\r\ndying down to a red-hot wick, but I was too drowsy to attend to it, and\r\nit went out. I lit my cigar stump again, and tried to keep awake by\r\nthinking. It was the first time I and Davies had been separated for so\r\nlong; yet so used had we grown to freedom from interference that this\r\nwould not have disturbed me in the least were it not for a sudden\r\npresentiment that on this first night of the second stage of our\r\nlabours something would happen. All at once I heard a sound outside, a\r\nsplashing footstep as of a man stepping in a puddle. I was wide awake\r\nin an instant, but never thought of shouting \xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Davies?\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\nI knew in a flash that it was not he. It was the slip of a stealthy\r\nman. Presently I heard another footstep\xe2\x80\x94the pad of a boot on the\r\nsand\xe2\x80\x94this time close to my ear, just outside the hull; then some more,\r\nfainter and farther aft. I gently rose and peered aft through the\r\nskylight. A glimmer of light, reflected from below, was wavering over\r\nthe mizzen-mast and bumpkin; it had nothing to do with the\r\nriding-light, which hung on the forestay. My prowler, I understood, had\r\nstruck a match and was reading the name on the stern. How much farther\r\nwould his curiosity carry him? The match went out, and footsteps were\r\naudible again. Then a strong, guttural voice called in German, \xe2\x80\x9cYacht\r\nahoy!\xe2\x80\x9d I kept silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYacht ahoy!\xe2\x80\x9d a little louder this time. A\r\npause, and then a vibration of the hull as boots scraped on it and\r\nhands grasped the gunwale. My visitor was on deck. I bobbed down, sat\r\non the sofa, and I heard him moving along the deck, quickly and\r\nconfidently, first forward to the bows, where he stopped, then back to\r\nthe companion amidships. Inside the cabin it was pitch dark, but I\r\nheard his boots on the ladder, feeling for the steps. In another moment\r\nhe would be in the doorway lighting his second match. Surely it was\r\ndarker than before? There had been a little glow from the riding-lamp\r\nreflected on to the skylight, but it had disappeared. I looked up,\r\nrealised, and made a fool of myself. In a few seconds more I should\r\nhave seen my visitor face to face, perhaps had an interview: but I was\r\nnew to this sort of work and lost my head. All I thought of was\r\nDavies\xe2\x80\x99s last words, and saw him astray on the sands, with no light to\r\nguide him back, the tide rising, and a heavy load. I started up\r\ninvoluntarily, bumped against the table, and set the stove jingling. A\r\nlong step and a grab at the ladder, but just too late! I grasped\r\nsomething damp and greasy, there was tugging and hard breathing, and I\r\nwas left clasping a big sea-boot, whose owner I heard jump on to the\r\nsand and run. I scrambled out, vaulted overboard, and followed blindly\r\nby the sound. He had doubled round the bows of the yacht, and I did the\r\nsame, ducked under the bowsprit, forgetting the bobstay, and fell\r\nviolently on my head, with all the wind knocked out of me by a wire\r\nrope and block whose strength and bulk was one of the glories of the\r\n_Dulcibella_. I struggled on as soon as I got some breath, but my\r\ninvisible quarry was far ahead. I pulled off my heavy boots, carried\r\nthem, and ran in my stockings, promptly cutting my foot on some\r\ncockle-shells. Pursuit was hopeless, and a final stumble over a bit of\r\ndriftwood sent me sprawling with agony in my toes.\r\n\r\nLimping back, I decided that I had made a very poor beginning as an\r\nactive adventurer. I had gained nothing, and lost a great deal of\r\nbreath and skin, and did not even know for certain where I was. The\r\nyacht\xe2\x80\x99s light was extinguished, and, even with Wangeroog Lighthouse to\r\nguide me, I found it no easy matter to find her. She had no anchor out,\r\nif the tide rose. And how was Davies to find her? After much feeble\r\ncircling I took to lying flat at intervals in the hopes of seeing her\r\nsilhouetted against the starry sky. This plan succeeded at last, and\r\nwith relief and humility I boarded her, relit the riding-light, and\r\ncarried off the kedge anchor. The strange boot lay at the foot of the\r\nladder, but it told no tales when I examined it. It was eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\npast low water. Davies was cutting it fine if he was to get aboard\r\nwithout the dinghy\xe2\x80\x99s help. But eventually he reappeared in the most\r\nprosaic way, exhausted with his heavy load, but full of talk about his\r\nvisit ashore. He began while we were still on deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, we ought to have settled more about what we\xe2\x80\x99re to say when\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re asked questions. I chose a quiet-looking shop, but it turned out\r\nto be a sort of inn, where they were drinking pink gin\xe2\x80\x94all very\r\nfriendly, as usual, and I found myself under a fire of questions. I\r\nsaid we were on our way back to England. There was the usual rot about\r\nthe smallness of the boat, etc. It struck me that we should want some\r\nother pretence for going so slow and stopping to explore, so I had to\r\nbring in the ducks, though goodness knows we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to waste time\r\nover _them._ The subject wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite a success. They said it was too\r\nearly\xe2\x80\x94jealous, I suppose; but then two fellows spoke up, and asked to\r\nbe taken on to help. Said they would bring their punt; without local\r\nhelp we should do no good. All true enough, no doubt, but what a\r\nnuisance they\xe2\x80\x99d be. I got out of it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just as well you did,\xe2\x80\x9d I interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall never be able to\r\nleave the boat by herself. I believe we\xe2\x80\x99re watched,\xe2\x80\x9d and I related my\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see who it was. Confound that bobstay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(his tactful way of reflecting on my clumsiness); \xe2\x80\x9cwhich way did he\r\nrun?\xe2\x80\x9d I pointed vaguely into the west. \xe2\x80\x9cNot towards the island? I\r\nwonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s someone off one of those galliots. There are three\r\nanchored in the channel over there; you can see their lights. You\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a boat pulling off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI explained that I had been a miserable failure as a detective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done jolly well, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you had shouted\r\nwhen you first heard him we should know less still. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\nboot, which may come in useful. Anchor out all right? Let\xe2\x80\x99s get below.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe smoked and talked till the new flood, lapping softly round the\r\n_Dulcibella_, raised her without a jar.\r\n\r\nOf course, I argued, there might be nothing in it. The visitor might\r\nhave been a commonplace thief; an apparently deserted yacht was a\r\ntempting bait. Davies scouted this possibility from the first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not like that in Germany,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Holland, if you like,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that turning out of the lantern\r\nto gain time, if we were away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNor did I. In spite of my blundering in details, I welcomed the\r\nincident as the first concrete proof that the object of our quest was\r\nno mare\xe2\x80\x99s nest. The next point was what was the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s object? If to\r\nsearch, what would he have found?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe charts, of course, with all our corrections and notes, and the\r\nlog. They\xe2\x80\x99d give us away,\xe2\x80\x9d was Davies\xe2\x80\x99s instant conclusion. Not having\r\nhis faith in the channel theory, I was lukewarm about his precious\r\ncharts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing nothing wrong, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve often said yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI said.\r\n\r\nStill, as a true index to our mode of life they were the only things on\r\nboard that could possibly compromise us or suggest that we were\r\nanything more than eccentric young Englishmen cruising for sport\r\n(witness the duck-guns) and pleasure. We had two sets of charts, German\r\nand English. The former we decided to use in practice, and to hide,\r\ntogether with the log, if occasion demanded. My diary, I resolved,\r\nshould never leave my person. Then there were the naval books. Davies\r\nscanned them with a look I knew well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are too many of them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in the tone of a cook fixing the\r\nfate of superfluous kittens. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s throw them overboard. They\xe2\x80\x99re very\r\nold anyhow, and I know them by heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not here!\xe2\x80\x9d I protested, for he was laying greedy hands on the\r\nshelf; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ll be found at low water. In fact, I should leave them as\r\nthey are. You had them when you were here before, and Dollmann knows\r\nyou had them. If you return without them, it will look queer.\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\nwere spared.\r\n\r\nThe English charts, being relatively useless, though more suitable to\r\nour _r\xc3\xb4le_ as English yachtsmen, were to be left in evidence, as\r\nshining proofs of our innocence. It was all delightfully casual, I\r\ncould not help thinking. A seven-ton yacht does not abound in (dry)\r\nhiding-places, and we were helpless against a drastic search. If there\r\n_were_ secrets on this coast to guard, and we were suspected as spies,\r\nthere was nothing to prevent an official visit and warning. There need\r\nbe no prowlers scuttling off when alarmed, unless indeed it was thought\r\nwisest to let well alone, if we _were_ harmless, and not to arouse\r\nsuspicions where there were none. Here we lost ourselves in conjecture.\r\nWhose agent was the prowler? If Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s, did Dollmann know now that\r\nthe _Dulcibella_ was safe, and back in the region he had expelled her\r\nfrom? If so, was he likely to return to the policy of violence? We\r\nfound ourselves both glancing at the duck-guns strung up under the\r\nracks, and then we both laughed and looked foolish. \xe2\x80\x9cA war of wits, and\r\nnot of duck-guns,\xe2\x80\x9d I opined. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s look at the chart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: Map B of East Friesland. Map B\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader is already familiar with the general aspect of this singular\r\nregion, and I need only remind him that the mainland is that district\r\nof Prussia which is known as East Friesland. It is a _[See Map B]_\r\nshort, flat-topped peninsula, bounded on the west by the Ems estuary\r\nand beyond that by Holland, and on the east by the Jade estuary; a\r\nlow-lying country, containing great tracts of marsh and heath, and few\r\ntowns of any size; on the north side none. Seven islands lie off the\r\ncoast. All, except Borkum, which is round, are attenuated strips,\r\nslightly crescent-shaped, rarely more than a mile broad, and tapering\r\nat the ends; in length averaging about six miles, from Norderney and\r\nJuist, which are seven and nine respectively, to little Baltrum, which\r\nis only two and a half.\r\n\r\nOf the shoal spaces which lie between them and the mainland, two-thirds\r\ndry at low-water, and the remaining third becomes a system of lagoons\r\nwhose distribution is controlled by the natural drift of the North Sea\r\nas it forces its way through the intervals between the islands. Each of\r\nthese intervals resembles the bar of a river, and is obstructed by\r\ndangerous banks, over which the sea pours at every tide scooping out a\r\ndeep pool. This fans out and ramifies to east and west as the pent-up\r\ncurrent frees itself, encircles the islands, and spreads over the\r\nintervening flats. But the farther it penetrates the less coursing\r\nforce it has, and as a result no island is girt completely by a\r\nlow-water channel. About midway at the back of each of them is a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwatershed\xe2\x80\x9d, only covered for five or six hours out of the twelve. A\r\nboat, even of the lightest draught, navigating behind the islands must\r\nchoose its moment for passing these. As to navigability, the _North Sea\r\nPilot_ sums up the matter in these dry terms: \xe2\x80\x9cThe channels dividing\r\nthese islands from each other and the shore afford to the small craft\r\nof the country the means of communication between the Ems and the Jade,\r\nto which description of vessels only they are available.\xe2\x80\x9d The islands\r\nare dismissed with a brief note or two about beacons and lights.\r\n\r\nThe more I looked at the chart the more puzzled I became. The islands\r\nwere evidently mere sandbanks, with a cluster of houses and a church on\r\neach, the only hint of animation in their desolate _ensemble_ being the\r\noccasional word \xe2\x80\x9cBade-strand\xe2\x80\x9d, suggesting that they were visited in the\r\nsummer months by a handful of townsfolk for the sea-bathing. Norderney,\r\nof course, was conspicuous in this respect; but even its town, which I\r\nknow by repute as a gay and fashionable watering-place, would be dead\r\nand empty for some months in the year, and could have no commercial\r\nimportance. No man could do anything on the mainland coast\xe2\x80\x94a monotonous\r\nline of dyke punctuated at intervals by an infinitesimal village.\r\nGlancing idly at the names of these villages, I noticed that they most\r\nof them ended in siel\xe2\x80\x94a repulsive termination, that seemed appropriate\r\nto the whole region. There were Carolinensiel, Bensersiel, etc. Siel\r\nmeans either a sewer or a sluice, the latter probably in this case, for\r\nI noticed that each village stood at the outlet of a little stream\r\nwhich evidently carried off the drainage of the lowlands behind. A\r\nsluice, or lock, would be necessary at the mouth, for at high tide the\r\nland is below the level of the sea. Looking next at the sands outside,\r\nI noticed that across them and towards each outlet a line of booms was\r\nmarked, showing that there was some sort of tidal approach to the\r\nvillage, evidently formed by the scour of the little stream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we going to explore those?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see the use,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cthey only lead to those potty\r\nlittle places. I suppose local galliots use them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about your torpedo-boats and patrol-boats?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey _might,_ at certain tides. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t see what value they\xe2\x80\x99d be,\r\nunless as a refuge for a German boat in the last resort. They lead to\r\nno harbours. Wait! There\xe2\x80\x99s a little notch in the dyke at\r\nNeuharlingersiel and Dornumersiel, which may mean some sort of a quay\r\narrangement, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may as well visit one or two, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so; but we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be playing round villages. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheaps of really important work to do, farther out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what _do_ you make of this coast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies had nothing but the same old theory, but he urged it with a\r\nforce and keenness that impressed me more deeply than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at those islands!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re clearly the old line of\r\ncoast, hammered into breaches by the sea. The space behind them is like\r\nan immense tidal harbour, thirty miles by five, and they screen it\r\nimpenetrably. It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely _made_ for shallow war-boats under\r\nskilled pilotage. They can nip in and out of the gaps, and dodge about\r\nfrom end to end. On one side is the Ems, on the other the big\r\nestuaries. It\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect base for torpedo-craft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI agreed (and agree still), but still I shrugged my shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe go on exploring, then, in the same way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; keeping a sharp look-out, though. Remember, we shall always be in\r\nsight of land now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the glass doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigher than for a long time. I hope it won\xe2\x80\x99t bring fog. I know this\r\ndistrict is famous for fogs, and fine weather at this time of the year\r\nis bad for them anywhere. I would rather it blew, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for\r\nexploring those gaps, where an on-shore wind would be nasty. Six-thirty\r\nto-morrow; not later. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep in the saloon for the future,\r\nafter what happened to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nBensersiel\r\n\r\n\r\n[For this chapter see Map B.]\r\n\r\nThe decisive incidents of our cruise were now fast approaching. Looking\r\nback on the steps that led to them, and anxious that the reader should\r\nbe wholly with us in our point of view, I think I cannot do better than\r\ngive extracts from my diary of the next three days:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Oct._ 16 (up at 6.30, yacht high and dry). Of the three galliots out\r\nat anchor in the channel yesterday, only one is left.... I took my turn\r\nwith the breakers this morning and walked to Wangeroog, whose village I\r\nfound half lost in sand drifts, which are planted with tufts of\r\nmarram-grass in mathematical rows, to give stability and prevent a\r\ncatastrophe like that at Pompeii. A friendly grocer told me all there\r\nis to know, which is little. The islands are what we thought\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94barren for the most part, with a small fishing population, and a\r\nscanty accession of summer visitors for bathing. The season is over\r\nnow, and business slack for him. There is still, however, a little\r\ntrade with the mainland in galliots and lighters, a few of which come\r\nfrom the \xe2\x80\x98siels\xe2\x80\x99 on the mainland. \xe2\x80\x98Had these harbours?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mud-holes!\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, with a contemptuous laugh. (He is a settler in\r\nthese wilds, not a native.) Said he had heard of schemes for improving\r\nthem, so as to develop the islands as health-resorts, but thought it\r\nwas only a wild speculation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA heavy tramp back to the yacht, nearly crushed by impedimenta. While\r\nDavies made yet another trip, I stalked some birds with a gun, and\r\nobtained what resembled a specimen of the smallest variety of\r\njack-snipe, and small at that; but I made a great noise, which I hope\r\npersuaded somebody of the purity of our motives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe weighed anchor at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and in passing the anchored galliot\r\ntook a good look at her. _Kormoran_ was on her stern; otherwise she was\r\njust like a hundred others. Nobody was on deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe spent the whole afternoon till dark exploring the Harle, or gap\r\nbetween Wangeroog and Spiekeroog; the sea breaking heavily on the banks\r\noutside.... Fine as the day was, the scene from the offing was desolate\r\nto the last degree. The naked spots of the two islands are hideous in\r\ntheir sterility: melancholy bits of wreck-wood their only relief, save\r\nfor one or two grotesque beacons, and, most _bizarre_ of all, a great\r\nchurch-tower, standing actually _in_ the water, on the north side of\r\nWangeroog, a striking witness to the encroachment of the sea. On the\r\nmainland, which was barely visible, there was one very prominent\r\nlandmark, a spire, which from the chart we took to be that of _Esens,_\r\na town four miles inland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe days are growing short. Sunset is soon after five, and an hour\r\nlater it is too dark to see booms and buoys distinctly. The tides also\r\nare awkward just now.[1] High-water at morning and evening is between\r\nfive and six\xe2\x80\x94just at twilight. For the night, we groped with the lead\r\ninto the Muschel Balge, the tributary channel which laps round the\r\ninside of Spiekeroog, and lay in two fathoms, clear of the outer swell,\r\nbut rolling a little when the ebb set in strong against the wind.\r\n\r\n [1] I exclude all the technicalities that I can, but the reader should\r\n take note that the tide-table is very important henceforward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA galliot passed us, going west, just as we were stowing sails; too\r\ndark to see her name. Later, we saw her anchor-light higher up our\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great event of the day has been the sighting of a small German\r\ngunboat, steaming slowly west along the coast. That was about half-past\r\nfour, when we were sounding along the Harle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavies identified her at once as the _Blitz_, Commander von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngunboat. We wondered if he recognised the _Dulcibella_, but, anyway,\r\nshe seemed to take no notice of us and steamed slowly on. We quite\r\nexpected to fall in with her when we came to the islands, but the\r\nactual sight of her has excited us a good deal. She is an ugly, cranky\r\nlittle vessel, painted grey, with one funnel. Davis is contemptuous\r\nabout her low freeboard forward; says he would rather go to sea in the\r\n_Dulce_. He has her dimensions and armament (learnt from Brassey) at\r\nhis fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends: one hundred and forty feet by twenty-five, one 4.9\r\ngun, one 3.4, and four maxims\xe2\x80\x94an old type. Just going to bed; a\r\nbitterly cold night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Oct._ 17.\xe2\x80\x94Glass falling heavily this morning, to our great disgust.\r\nWind back in the SW and much warmer. Starting at 5.30 we tacked on the\r\ntide over the \xe2\x80\x98watershed\xe2\x80\x99 behind Spiekeroog. So did the galliot we had\r\nseen last night, but we again missed identifying her, as she weighed\r\nanchor before we came up to her berth. Davies, however, swore she was\r\nthe _Kormoran_. We lost sight of her altogether for the greater part of\r\nthe day, which we spent in exploring the Otzumer Ee (the gap between\r\nLangeoog and Spiekeroog), now and then firing some perfunctory shots at\r\nseals and sea-birds . . . (nautical details omitted). . . . In the\r\nevening we were hurrying back to an inside anchorage, when we made a\r\nbad mistake; did, in fact, what we had never done before, ran aground\r\non the very top of high water, and are now sitting hard and fast on the\r\nedge of the Rute Flat, south of the east spit of Langeoog. The light\r\nwas bad, and a misplaced boom tricked us; kedging-off failed, and at 8\r\np.m. we were left on a perfect Ararat of sand, and only a yard or two\r\nfrom that accursed boom, which is perched on the very summit, as a lure\r\nto the unwary. It is going to blow hard too, though that is no great\r\nmatter, as we are sheltered by banks on the sou\xe2\x80\x99-west and nor\xe2\x80\x99-west\r\nsides, the likely quarters. We hope to float at 6.15 to-morrow morning,\r\nbut to make sure of being able to get her off, we have been\r\ntransferring some ballast to the dinghy, by way of lightening the\r\nyacht\xe2\x80\x94a horrid business handling the pigs of lead, heavy, greasy, and\r\nblack. The saloon is an inferno, the deck like a collier\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nourselves like sweeps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe anchors are laid out, and there is nothing more to be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Oct._ 18\xe2\x80\x94Half a gale from the sou\xe2\x80\x99-west when we turned out, but it\r\nhelped us to float off safely at six. The dinghy was very nearly\r\nswamped with the weight of lead in it, and getting the ballast back\r\ninto the yacht was the toughest job of all. We got the dinghy\r\nalongside, and Davies jumped in (nearly sinking it for good), balanced\r\nhimself, fended off, and, whenever he got a chance, attached the pigs\r\none by one on to a bight of rope, secured to the peak halyards, on\r\nwhich I hoisted from the deck. It was touch and go for a few minutes,\r\nand then easier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nine before we had finished replacing the pigs in the hold, a\r\nfilthy but delicate operation, as they fit like a puzzle, and if one is\r\nout of place the floor-boards won\xe2\x80\x99t shut down. Coming on deck after it,\r\nwe saw to our surprise the _Blitz_, lying at anchor in the Schill\r\nBalje, inside Spiekeroog, about a mile and a half off. She must have\r\nentered the Otzumer Ee at high-water for shelter from the gale; a neat\r\nbit of work for a vessel of her size, as Davies says she draws\r\nnine-foot-ten, and there can\xe2\x80\x99t be more than twelve on the bar at\r\nhigh-water neaps. Several smacks had run in too, and there were two\r\ngalliots farther up our channel, but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out if the\r\n_Kormoran_ was one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the banks uncovered we lay more quietly, so landed and took a\r\nlong, tempestuous walk over the Rute, with compass and notebooks.\r\nReturning at two, we found the glass tumbling down almost visibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suggested running for Bensersiel, one of the mainland villages\r\nsouth-west of us, on the evening flood, as it seemed just the right\r\nopportunity, if we were to visit one of those \xe2\x80\x98siels\xe2\x80\x99 at all. Davies\r\nwas very lukewarm, but events overcame him. At 3.30 a black, ragged\r\ncloud, appearing to trail into the very sea, brought up a terrific\r\nsquall. This passed, and there was a deathly pause of ten minutes while\r\nthe whole sky eddied as with smoke-wreaths. Then an icy puff struck us\r\nfrom the north-west, rapidly veering till it reached north-east; there\r\nit settled and grew harder every moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Sou\xe2\x80\x99-west to north-east\xe2\x80\x94only the worst sort do that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe shift to the east changed the whole situation (as shifts often\r\nhave before), making the Rute Flats a lee shore, while to windward lay\r\nthe deep lagoons of the Otzumer Ee, bounded indeed by Spiekeroog, but\r\nstill offering a big drift for wind and sea. We had to clear out sharp,\r\nto set the mizzen. It was out of the question to beat to windward, for\r\nit was blowing a hurricane in a few minutes. We must go to leeward, and\r\nDavies was for running farther in well behind the Jans sand, and not\r\nrisking Bensersiel. A blunder of mine, when I went to the winch to get\r\nup anchor, settled the question. Thirty out of our forty fathoms of\r\nchain were out. Confused by the motion and a blinding sleet-shower that\r\nhad come on, and forgetting the tremendous strain on the cable, I cast\r\nthe slack off the bitts and left it loose. There was then only one turn\r\nof the chain round the drum, enough in ordinary weather to prevent it\r\nrunning out. But now my first heave on the winch-lever started it\r\nslipping, and in an instant it was whizzing out of the hawse-pipe and\r\noverboard. I tried to stop it with my foot, stumbled at a heavy plunge\r\nof the yacht, heard something snap below, and saw the last of it\r\ndisappear. The yacht fell off the wind, and drifted astern. I shouted,\r\nand had the sense to hoist the reefed foresail at once. Davies had her\r\nin hand in no time, and was steering south-west. Going aft I found him\r\ncool and characteristic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98anchor\xe2\x80\x99s buoyed. (Ever since leaving the\r\nElbe we had had a buoy-line on our anchor against the emergency of\r\nhaving to slip our cable and run. For the same reason the end of the\r\nchain was not made permanently fast below.) We\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to-morrow\r\nand get it. Can\xe2\x80\x99t now. Should have had to slip it anyhow; wind and sea\r\ntoo strong. We\xe2\x80\x99ll try for Bensersiel. Can\xe2\x80\x99t trust to a warp and kedge\r\nout here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn exciting run it was, across country, so to speak, over an unboomed\r\nwatershed; but we had bearings from our morning\xe2\x80\x99s walk. Shoal water all\r\nthe way and a hollow sea breaking everywhere. We soon made out the\r\nBensersiel booms, but even under mizzen and foresail only we travelled\r\ntoo fast, and had to heave to outside them, for the channel looked too\r\nshallow still. We lowered half the centreboard and kept her just\r\nholding her own to windward, through a most trying period. In the end\r\nhad to run for it sooner than we meant, as we were sagging to leeward\r\nin spite of all, and the light was failing. Bore up at 5.15, and raced\r\nup the channel with the booms on our left scarcely visible in the surf\r\nand rising water. Davies stood forward, signalling\xe2\x80\x94port, starboard, or\r\nsteady\xe2\x80\x94with his arms, while I wrestled with the helm, flung from side\r\nto side and flogged by wave-tops. Suddenly found a sort of dyke on our\r\nright just covering with sea. The shore appeared through scud, and men\r\non a quay shouting. Davies brandished his left arm furiously; I ported\r\nhard, and we were in smoother water. A few seconds more and we were\r\nwhizzing through a slit between two wood jetties. Inside a small square\r\nharbour showed, but there was no room to round up properly and no time\r\nto lower sails. Davies just threw the kedge over, and it just got a\r\ngrip in time to check our momentum and save our bowsprit from the\r\nquayside. A man threw us a rope and we brought up alongside, rather\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot more so than the natives, who seemed to think we had dropped from\r\nthe sky. They were very friendly, with an undercurrent of\r\ndisappointment, having expected salvage work outside, I think. All\r\nshowed embarrassing helpfulness in stowing sails, etc. We were rescued\r\nby a fussy person in uniform and spectacles, who swept them aside and\r\nannounced himself as the Custom-house officer (fancy such a thing in\r\nthis absurd mud-hole!), marched down into the cabin, which was in a\r\nfearful mess and wringing wet, and producing ink, pen, and a huge\r\nprinted form, wanted to know our cargo, our crew, our last port, our\r\ndestination, our food, stores, and everything. No cargo (pleasure);\r\ncaptain, Davies; crew, me; last port, Brunsb\xc3\xbcttel; destination,\r\nEngland. What spirits had we? Whisky, produced. What salt? Tin of\r\nCerebos, produced, and a damp deposit in a saucer. What coffee? etc.\r\nLockers searched, guns fingered, bunks rifled. Meanwhile the German\r\ncharts and the log, the damning clues to our purpose, were in full\r\nevidence, crying for notice which they did not get. (We had forgotten\r\nour precautions in the hurry of our start from the Rute.) When the huge\r\nform was as full as he could make it, he suddenly became human,\r\ntalkative, and thirsty; and, when we treated him, patronising. It\r\nseemed to dawn on him that, under our rough clothes and crust of brine\r\nand grime, we were two mad and wealthy aristocrats, worthy _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9s_\r\nof a high official. He insisted on our bringing our cushions to dry at\r\nhis house, and to get rid of him we consented, for we were wet, hungry,\r\nand longing to change and wash. He talked himself away at last, and we\r\nhid the log and charts; but he returned, in the postmaster\xe2\x80\x99s uniform\r\nthis time before we had finished supper, and haled us and our cushions\r\nup through dark and mud to his cottage near the quay. To reach it we\r\ncrossed a small bridge spanning what seemed to be a small river with\r\nsluice-gates, just as we had thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe showed his prizes to his wife, who was quite flustered by the\r\ndistinguished strangers, and received the cushions with awe; and next\r\nwe were carried off to the Gasthaus and exhibited to the village\r\ncircle, where we talked ducks and weather. (Nobody takes us seriously;\r\nI never felt less like a conspirator.) Our friend, who is a\r\nfeather-headed chatterbox, is enormously important about his ridiculous\r\nlittle port, whose principal customer seems to be the Langeoog\r\npost-boat, a galliot running to and fro according to tide. A few\r\nlighters also come down the stream with bricks and produce from the\r\ninterior, and are towed to the islands. The harbour has from five to\r\nseven feet in it for two hours out of twelve! Herr Schenkel talked us\r\nback to the yacht, which we found resting on the mud\xe2\x80\x94and here we are.\r\nDavies pretends there are harbour smells, and says he won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to\r\nsleep; is already worrying about how to get away from here. Ashore,\r\nthey were saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, under sail, in strong north-east\r\nwinds, the channel being too narrow to tack in. For my part I find it a\r\nhuge relief to be in any sort of harbour after a fortnight in the open.\r\nThere are no tides or anchors to think about, and no bumping or\r\nrolling. Fresh milk to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nCommander von Br\xc3\xbcning\r\n\r\n\r\nTo resume my story in narrative form.\r\n\r\nI was awakened at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the 19th, after a long and delicious\r\nsleep, by Davies\xe2\x80\x99s voice outside, talking his unmistakable German.\r\nLooking out, in my pyjamas, I saw him on the quay above in conversation\r\nwith a man in a long mackintosh coat and a gold-laced navy cap. He had\r\na close-trimmed auburn beard, a keen, handsome face, and an animated\r\nmanner. It was raining in a raw air.\r\n\r\nThey saw me, and Davies said: \xe2\x80\x9cHullo, Carruthers! Here\xe2\x80\x99s Commander von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning from the _Blitz_\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98meiner Freund\xe2\x80\x99 Carruthers.\xe2\x80\x9d (Davies\r\nwas deplorably weak in terminations.)\r\n\r\nThe Commander smiled broadly at me, and I inclined an uncombed head,\r\nwhile, for a moment, the quest was a dream, and I myself felt\r\nunutterably squalid and foolish. I ducked down, heard them parting, and\r\nDavies came aboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re to meet him at the inn for a talk at twelve,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHis news was that the _Blitz_\xe2\x80\x99s steam-cutter had come in on the morning\r\ntide, and he had met von Br\xc3\xbcning when marketing at the inn. Secondly,\r\nthe _Kormoran_ had also come in, and was moored close by. It was as\r\nclear as possible, therefore, that the latter had watched us, and was\r\nin touch with the _Blitz_, and that both had seized the opportunity of\r\nour being cooped up in Bensersiel to take further stock of us. What had\r\npassed hitherto? Nothing much. Von Br\xc3\xbcning had greeted Davies with\r\ncordial surprise, and said he had wondered yesterday if it was the\r\n_Dulcibella_ that he had seen anchored behind Langeoog. Davies had\r\nexplained that we had left the Baltic and were on our way home; taking\r\nthe shelter of the islands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing he comes on board and asks to see our log?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull it out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rot, this hiding, after all, I say. I\r\nrather funk this interview; what are we to say? It\xe2\x80\x99s not in my line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe resolved abruptly on an important change of plan, replaced the log\r\nand charts in the rack as the first logical step. They contained\r\nnothing but bearings, courses, and the bare data of navigation. To\r\nDavies they were hard-won secrets of vital import, to be lied for,\r\nhowever hard and distasteful lying was. I was cooler as to their value,\r\nbut in any case the same thing was now in both our minds. There would\r\nbe great difficulties in the coming interview if we tried to be too\r\nclever and conceal the fact that we had been exploring. We did not know\r\nhow much von Br\xc3\xbcning knew. When had our surveillance by the _Kormoran_\r\nbegun? Apparently at Wangeroog, but possibly in the estuaries, where we\r\nhad not fired a shot at duck. Perhaps he knew even more\xe2\x80\x94Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntreachery, Davies\xe2\x80\x99s escape, and our subsequent movements\xe2\x80\x94we could not\r\ntell. On the other hand, exploration was known to be a fad of Davies\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand in September he had made no secret of it.\r\n\r\nIt was safer to be consistent now. After breakfast we determined to\r\nfind out something about the _Kormoran_, which lay on the mud at the\r\nother side of the harbour, and accordingly addressed ourselves to two\r\nmighty sailors, whose jerseys bore the legend \xe2\x80\x9cPost\xe2\x80\x9d, and who towered\r\nconspicuous among a row of stolid Frisians on the quay, all gazing\r\ngravely down at us as at a curious bit of marine bric-\xc3\xa0-brac. The twins\r\n(for such they proved to be) were most benignant giants, and asked us\r\naboard the post-boat galliot for a chat. It was easy to bring the talk\r\nnaturally round to the point we wished, and we soon gained some most\r\ninteresting information, delivered in the broadest Frisian, but\r\nintelligible enough. They called the _Kormoran_ a Memmert boat, or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwreck-works\xe2\x80\x9d boat. It seemed that off the western end of _Juist_, the\r\nisland lying west of Norderney, there lay the bones of a French\r\nwar-vessel, wrecked ages ago. She carried bullion which has never been\r\nrecovered, in spite of many efforts. A salvage company was trying for\r\nit now, and had works on Memmert, an adjacent sandbank. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is Herr\r\nGrimm, the overseer himself,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, pointing to the bridge above\r\nthe sluice-gates. (I call him \xe2\x80\x9cGrimm\xe2\x80\x9d because it describes him\r\nexactly.) A man in a pilot jacket and peaked cap was leaning over the\r\nparapet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nThey answered that he was often up and down the coast, work on the\r\nwreck being impossible in rough weather. They supposed he was bringing\r\ncargo in his galliot from Wilhelmshaven, all the company\xe2\x80\x99s plant and\r\nstores coming from that port. He was a local man from Aurich; an ex-tug\r\nskipper.\r\n\r\nWe discussed this information while walking out over the sands to see\r\nthe channel at low water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear anything about this in September?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Juist. I would have, probably, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmet Dollmann.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat in the world did it mean? How did it affect our plans?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at his boots if we pass him,\xe2\x80\x9d was all Davies had to suggest.\r\n\r\nThe channel was now a ditch, with a trickle in it, running north by\r\neast, roughly, and edged by a dyke of withies for the first quarter of\r\na mile. It was still blowing fresh from the north-east, and we saw that\r\nexit was impossible in such a wind.\r\n\r\nSo back to the village, a paltry, bleak little place. We passed friend\r\nGrimm on the bridge; a dark, clean-shaved, saturnine man, wearing\r\n_shoes._ Approaching the inn:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t settled quite enough, have we?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about\r\nour future plans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven knows, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how we can. We\r\nmust see how things go. It\xe2\x80\x99s past twelve, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t do to be late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I leave it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best. All you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do is to be yourself and\r\ntell one lie, if need be, about the trick Dollmann played you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next scene: von Br\xc3\xbcning, Davies, and I, sitting over coffee and\r\nK\xc3\xbcmmel at a table in a dingy inn-parlour overlooking the harbour and\r\nthe sea, Davies with a full box of matches on the table before him. The\r\nCommander gave us a hearty welcome, and I am bound to say I liked him\r\nat once, as Davies had done; but I feared him, too, for he had honest\r\neyes, but abominably clever ones.\r\n\r\nI had impressed on Davies to talk and question as freely and naturally\r\nas though nothing uncommon had happened since he last saw von Br\xc3\xbcning\r\non the deck of the _Medusa_. He must ask about Dollmann\xe2\x80\x94the mutual\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x94at the outset, and, if questioned about that voyage in his\r\ncompany to the Elbe, must lie like a trooper as to the danger he had\r\nbeen in. This was the one clear and essential necessity, where much was\r\ndifficult. Davies did his duty with precipitation, and blushed when he\r\nput his question, in a way that horrified me, till I remembered that\r\nhis embarrassment was due, and would be ascribed, to another cause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerr Dollmann is away still, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning. (So Davies\r\nhad been right at Brunsb\xc3\xbcttel.) \xe2\x80\x9cWere you thinking of looking him up\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s away. But his yacht is back, I believe\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nFr\xc3\xa4ulein Dollmann, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s a very fine boat that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur host smiled, gazing thoughtfully at Davies, who was miserable. I\r\nsaw a chance, and took it mercilessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can call on Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Dollmann, at least, Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with a\r\nmeaning smile at von Br\xc3\xbcning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cwill he be back soon, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Commander had begun to light a cigar, and took his time in\r\nanswering. \xe2\x80\x9cProbably,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after some puffing, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s never away\r\nvery long. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them later than I have. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you sail to\r\nthe Elbe together the day after I saw you last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, part of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, with great negligence. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen him since. He got there first; outsailed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGave you the slip, in fact?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he beat me; I was close-reefed. Besides\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I remember; there was a heavy blow\xe2\x80\x94a devil of a heavy blow. I\r\nthought of you that day. How did you manage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was a fair wind; it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrosse Gott! In _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded towards the window whence the\r\n_Dulcibella_\xe2\x80\x99s taper mast could be seen pointing demurely heavenwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a splendid sea-boat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand pardons!\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t shake my faith in her,\xe2\x80\x9d I put in. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get to England in\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid; I was only thinking that there must have been some sea\r\nround the Scharhorn that day; a tame affair, no doubt, Herr Davies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScharhorn?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, who did not catch the idiom in the latter\r\nsentence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t go that way. We cut through the sands\xe2\x80\x94by the\r\nTelte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Telte! In a north-west gale!\xe2\x80\x9d The Commander started, ceased to\r\nsmile, and only stared. (It was genuine surprise; I could swear it. He\r\nhad heard nothing of this before.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerr Dollmann knew the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, doggedly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe kindly offered\r\nto pilot me through, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d There was an\r\nawkward little pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe led you well, it seems?\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; there\xe2\x80\x99s a nasty surf there, though, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there? But it saves six\r\nmiles\xe2\x80\x94and the Scharhorn. Not that I saved distance. I was fool enough\r\nto run aground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, with interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, because I was well inside then. Those sands are\r\ndifficult at high water. We\xe2\x80\x99ve come back that way, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we run aground every day,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, with resignation.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that where the _Medusa_ gave you the slip?\xe2\x80\x9d asked von Br\xc3\xbcning,\r\nstill studying Davies with a strange look, which I strove anxiously to\r\nanalyse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have noticed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very thick and\r\nsqually\xe2\x80\x94and she had got some way ahead. There was no need for her to\r\nstop, anyway. I got off all right; the tide was rising still. But, of\r\ncourse, I anchored there for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInside there, under the Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the _what_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t they wait for you at Cuxhaven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go that way.\xe2\x80\x9d The Commander looked more and\r\nmore puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by the ship canal, I mean. I changed my mind about it, because the\r\nnext day the wind was easterly. It would have been a dead beat across\r\nthe sands to Cuxhaven, while it was a fair wind straight out to the\r\nEider River. So I sailed there, and reached the Baltic that way. It was\r\nall the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought. He had told his story well, using no\r\nsubtlety. I knew it was exactly how he would have told it to anyone\r\nelse, if he had not had irrefutable proof of foul play.\r\n\r\nThe Commander laughed, suddenly and heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother liqueur?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Then, to me: \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, your friend\r\namuses me. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to make him spin a yarn. I expect he had a\r\nbad time of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to him,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9che prefers it. He anchored me the\r\nother day behind the Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn in a gale of wind; said it was safer\r\nthan a harbour, and more sanitary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder he brought you here last night. It was a fair wind for\r\nEngland; and not very far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no pilot to follow, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a charming daughter\xe2\x80\x94no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies frowned and glared at me. I was merciful and changed the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve left our anchor and chain out there.\xe2\x80\x9d And I\r\nmade confession of my sin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as it\xe2\x80\x99s buoyed, I should advise you to pick it up as soon as you\r\ncan,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning, carelessly; \xe2\x80\x9cor someone else will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, by Jove! Carruthers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must get out on\r\nthis next tide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, partly from policy, partly because the\r\nease of the shore was on me. To sit on a chair upright is something of\r\na luxury, however good the cause in which you have crouched like a\r\nmonkey over a table at the level of your knees, with a reeking\r\noil-stove at your ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re honest enough about here, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d I added. While the\r\nwords were on my lips I remembered the midnight visitor at Wangeroog,\r\nand guessed that von Br\xc3\xbcning was leading up to a test. Grimm (if he was\r\nthe visitor) would have told him of his narrow escape from detection,\r\nand reticence on our part would show we suspected something. I could\r\nhave kicked myself, but it was not too late. I took the bull by the\r\nhorns, and, before the Commander could answer, added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! Davies, I forgot about that fellow at Wangeroog. The anchor\r\nmight be stolen, as he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies looked blank, but von Br\xc3\xbcning had turned to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe never dreamed there would be thieves among these islands,\xe2\x80\x9d I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut the other night I nearly caught a fellow in the act. He thought\r\nthe yacht was empty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI described the affair in detail, and with what humour I could. Our\r\nhost was amused, and apologetic for the islanders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re excellent folk,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they\xe2\x80\x99re born with predatory\r\ninstincts. Their fathers made their living out of wrecks on this coast,\r\nand the children inherit a weakness for plunder. When Wangeroog\r\nlighthouse was built they petitioned the Government for compensation,\r\nin perfect good faith. The coast is well lighted now, and windfalls are\r\nrare, but the sight of a stranded yacht, with the owners ashore, would\r\ninflame the old passion; and, depend upon it, someone has seen that\r\nanchor-buoy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe word \xe2\x80\x9cwrecks\xe2\x80\x9d had set me tingling. Was it another test? Impossible\r\nto say; but audacity was safer than reserve, and might save trouble in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t there the wreck of a treasure-ship somewhere farther west?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cWe heard of it at Wangeroog\xe2\x80\x9d (my first inaccuracy). \xe2\x80\x9cThey said\r\na company was exploiting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Commander, without a sign of embarrassment. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wonder you heard of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the few things folk have to\r\ntalk about in these parts. It lies on Juister Riff, a shoal off Juist.\r\n_[See Map B]_ She was a French frigate, the _Corinne_, bound from\r\nHamburg to Havre in 1811, when Napoleon held Hamburg as tight as Paris.\r\nShe carried a million and a half in gold bars, and was insured in\r\nHamburg; foundered in four fathoms, broke up, and there lies the\r\ntreasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever been raised?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. The underwriters failed and went bankrupt, and the wreck came into\r\nthe hands of your English Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s. It remained their property till \xe2\x80\x9975,\r\nbut they never got at the bullion. In fact, for fifty years it was\r\nnever scratched at, and its very position grew doubtful, for the sand\r\nswallowed every stick. The rights passed through various hands, and in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9986 were held by an enterprising Swedish company, which brought modern\r\nappliances, dived, dredged, and dug, fished up a lot of timber and\r\nbric-\xc3\xa0-brac, and then broke. Since then, two Hamburg firms have tackled\r\nthe job and lost their capital. Scores of lives have been spent over\r\nit, all told, and probably a million of money. Still there are the\r\nbars, somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s being done now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, recently a small local company was formed. It has a dep\xc3\xb4t at\r\nMemmert, and is working with a good deal of perseverance. An engineer\r\nfrom Bremen was the principal mover, and a few men from Norderney and\r\nEmden subscribed the capital. By the way, our friend Dollmann is\r\nlargely interested in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of my eye I saw Davies\xe2\x80\x99s tell-tale face growing\r\ntroubled with inward questionings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t get back to him,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to my\r\nfriend. But all this is very interesting. Will they ever get those\r\nbars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s the point,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning, with a mysterious twinkle.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an undertaking of immense difficulty; for the wreck is wholly\r\ndisintegrated, and the gold, being the heaviest part of it, has, of\r\ncourse, sunk the deepest. Dredging is useless after a certain point;\r\nand the divers have to make excavations in the sand, and shore them up\r\nas best they can. Every gale nullifies half their labour, and weather\r\nlike this of the last fortnight plays the mischief with the work. Only\r\nthis morning I met the overseer, who happens to be ashore here. He was\r\nas black as thunder over prospects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s a romantic speculation,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey deserve a return for\r\ntheir money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll get it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Commander. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, I hold a few\r\nshares myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I hope I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been asking indiscreet questions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear no; all the world knows what I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nunderstand that one has to be reticent as to results in such a case.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a big stake, and the _title is none too sound._ There has been\r\nlitigation over it. Not that I worry much about my investment; for I\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t lose much by it at the worst. But it gives one an interest in\r\nthis abominable coast. I go and see how they\xe2\x80\x99re getting on sometimes,\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m down that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ an abominable coast,\xe2\x80\x9d I agreed heartily, \xe2\x80\x9cthough you won\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nDavies to agree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a magnificent place for sailing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, looking wistfully\r\nout over the storm-speckled grey of the North Sea.\r\n\r\nHe underwent some more chaff, and the talk passed to our cruising\r\nadventures in the Baltic and the estuaries. Von Br\xc3\xbcning cross-examined\r\nus with the most charming urbanity and skill. Nothing he asked could\r\ncause us the slightest offence; and a responsive frankness was our only\r\npossible course. So, date after date, and incident after incident, were\r\nelicited in the most natural way. As we talked I was astonished to find\r\nhow little there was that was worth concealing, and heartily thankful\r\nthat we had decided on candour. My fluency gave me the lead, and Davies\r\nfollowed me; but his own personality was really our tower of strength.\r\nI realised that as I watched the play of his eager features, and heard\r\nhim struggle for expression on his favourite hobby; all his pet phrases\r\ntranslated crudely into the most excruciating German. He was\r\nconvincing, because he was himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there many like you in England?\xe2\x80\x9d asked von Br\xc3\xbcning once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike me? Of course\xe2\x80\x94lots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish there were more in Germany; they play at yachting over here\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nshore half the time, drinking and loafing; paid crews, clean hands,\r\nwhite trousers; laid up in the middle of September.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen many yachts about, said Davies, politely.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I made no pretence of being a Davies. Faithful to my lower\r\nnature, I vowed the Germans were right, and, not without a secret zest,\r\ndrew a lurid picture of the horrors of crewless cruising, and the\r\ndrudgery that my remorseless skipper inflicted on me. It was delightful\r\nto see Davies wincing when I described my first night at Flensburg, for\r\nI had my revenge at last, and did not spare him. He bore up gallantly\r\nunder my jesting, but I knew very well by his manner that he had not\r\nforgiven me my banter about the \xe2\x80\x9ccharming daughter\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak German well,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lived in Germany,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStudying for a profession, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, thinking ahead. \xe2\x80\x9cCivil Service,\xe2\x80\x9d was my prepared answer\r\nto the next question, but again (morbidly, perhaps) I saw a pitfall.\r\nThat letter from my chief awaiting me at Norderney? My name was known,\r\nand we were watched. It might be opened. Lord, how casual we have been!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Foreign Office.\xe2\x80\x9d It sounded suspicious, but there it was.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed\xe2\x80\x94in the Government service? When do you have to be back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was how the question of our future intentions was raised,\r\nprematurely by me; for two conflicting theories were clashing in my\r\nbrain. But the contents of the letter dogged me now, and \xe2\x80\x9cwhen at a\r\nloss, tell the truth\xe2\x80\x9d, was an axiom I was finding sound. So I answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty soon, in about a week. But I\xe2\x80\x99m expecting a letter at Norderney,\r\nwhich may give me an extension. Davies said it was a good address to\r\ngive,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning, dryly; the joke had apparently ceased to\r\namuse him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you haven\xe2\x80\x99t much time then, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cunless you leave your skipper in the lurch. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long way to\r\nEngland, and the season is late for yachts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt myself being hurried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d I explained; \xe2\x80\x9c_he\xe2\x80\x99s_ in no hurry. He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nman of leisure; aren\xe2\x80\x99t you, Davies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\nI translated my cruel question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, with simple pathos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have to leave him I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be missed\xe2\x80\x94as an able seaman, at least.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll just potter on down the islands, running aground and kedging-off,\r\nand arrive about Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr take the first fair gale to Dover,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the Commander.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr that. So, you see, we\xe2\x80\x99re in no hurry; and we never make plans. And\r\nas for a passage to England straight, I\xe2\x80\x99m not such a coward as I was at\r\nfirst, but I draw the line at that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a curious pair of shipmates; what\xe2\x80\x99s your point of view, Herr\r\nDavies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like this coast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94we want to shoot some ducks.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nwas nervous, and forgot himself. I had already satirised our sporting\r\narmament and exploits, and hoped the subject was disposed of. Ducks\r\nwere pretexts, and might lead to complications. I particularly wanted a\r\nfree hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to wild fowl,\xe2\x80\x9d said our friend, \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to give you gentlemen\r\nsome advice. There are plenty to be got, now that autumn weather has\r\nset in (you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have got a shot in September, Herr Davies; I\r\nremember your asking about them when I saw you last). And even now it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nearly for amateurs. In hard winter weather a child can pick them up;\r\nbut they\xe2\x80\x99re wild still, and want crafty hunting. You want a local punt,\r\nand above all a local man (you could stow him in your fo\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99sle), and to\r\ngo to work seriously. Now, if you really wish for sport, I could help\r\nyou. I could get you a trustworthy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s too good of you,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Davies, in a more unhappy accent\r\nthan usual. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can easily find one for ourselves. A man at Wangeroog\r\noffered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, did he?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted von Br\xc3\xbcning, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know the Frieslanders. They\xe2\x80\x99re guileless, as I said, but they\r\ncling to their little perquisites.\xe2\x80\x9d (I translated to Davies.) \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen cheated out of wrecks, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all the more sensitive about\r\nducks, which are more lucrative than fish. A stranger is a poacher.\r\nYour man would have made slight errors as to time and place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said they were odd in their manner, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Davies?\xe2\x80\x9d I put in.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, this is very kind of Commander von Br\xc3\xbcning; but hadn\xe2\x80\x99t we\r\nbetter be certain of my plans before settling down to shoot? Let\xe2\x80\x99s push\r\non direct to Norderney and get that letter of mine, and then decide.\r\nBut we shan\xe2\x80\x99t see you again, I suppose, Commander?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? I am cruising westwards, and shall probably call at\r\nNorderney. Come aboard if you\xe2\x80\x99re there, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? I should like to\r\nshow you the _Blitz_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as heartily as I could.\r\n\r\nOur party broke up soon after this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gentlemen, I must take leave of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said our friend. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nto drive to Esens. I shall be going back to the _Blitz_ on the evening\r\ntide, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll be busy then with your own boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had been a puzzling interview, but the greatest puzzle was still to\r\ncome. As we went towards the door, von Br\xc3\xbcning made a sign to me. We\r\nlet Davies pass out and remained standing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word in confidence with you, Herr Carruthers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking\r\nlow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t think me officious, I hope. I only speak out of keen\r\nregard for your friend. It is about the Dollmanns\xe2\x80\x94you see how the land\r\nlies? I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t encourage him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut really\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only a hint. He\xe2\x80\x99s a splendid young fellow, but if anything\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nunderstand\xe2\x80\x94too honest and simple. I take it you have influence with\r\nhim, and I should use it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not in earnest,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen the Dollmanns; I\r\nthought they were friends of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, looking him straight in\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know them, but\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he shrugged his shoulders\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI know everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with them?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, point-blank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly! Herr Carruthers. Remember, I speak out of pure friendliness to\r\nyou as strangers, foreigners, and young. You I take to have discretion,\r\nor I should not have said a word. Still, I will add this. We know very\r\nlittle of Herr Dollmann, of his origin, his antecedents. He is half a\r\nSwede, I believe, certainly not a Prussian; came to Norderney three\r\nyears ago, appears to be rich, and has joined in various commercial\r\nundertakings. Little scope about here? Oh, there is more enterprise\r\nthan you think\xe2\x80\x94development of bathing resorts, you know, speculation in\r\nland on these islands. Sharp practice? Oh, no! he\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly straight\r\nin that way. But he\xe2\x80\x99s a queer fellow, of eccentric habits, and\xe2\x80\x94and,\r\nwell, as I say, little is known of him. That\xe2\x80\x99s all, just a warning.\r\nCome along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw that to press him further was useless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks; I\xe2\x80\x99ll remember,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd look here,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as we walked down the passage, \xe2\x80\x9cif you take\r\nmy advice, you\xe2\x80\x99ll omit that visit to the _Medusa_ altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave\r\nme a steady look, smiling gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you know, and what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d were the questions that\r\nthrobbed in my thoughts; but I could not utter them, so I said nothing\r\nand felt very young.\r\n\r\nOutside we joined Davies, who was knitting his brow over prospects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt just comes of going into places like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me. \xe2\x80\x9cWe may\r\nbe stuck here for days. Too much wind to tow out with the dinghy, and\r\ntoo narrow a channel to beat in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVon Br\xc3\xbcning was ready with a new proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t I think of it before?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tow you out in my\r\nlaunch. Be ready at 6.30; we shall have water enough then. My men will\r\nsend you a warp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to refuse, but a sense of being personally conducted\r\nagain oppressed me; and the last hope of a bed in the inn vanished.\r\nDavies was none too effusive either. A tug meant a pilot, and he had\r\nhad enough of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe objects to towage on principle,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust like him!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the other. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s settled, then!\xe2\x80\x9d A dogcart\r\nwas standing before the inn door in readiness for von Br\xc3\xbcning. I was\r\ncurious about Esens and his business there. Esens, he said, was the\r\nprincipal town of the district, four miles inland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to go there,\xe2\x80\x9d he volunteered, \xe2\x80\x9cabout a poaching case\xe2\x80\x94a Dutchman\r\ntrawling inside our limits. That\xe2\x80\x99s my work, you know\xe2\x80\x94police duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHad the words a deeper meaning?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you ever catch an Englishman?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, recklessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very rarely; your countrymen don\xe2\x80\x99t come so far as this\xe2\x80\x94except on\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d He bowed to us each and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much of that to be got in Bensersiel,\xe2\x80\x9d I laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a dull afternoon. Look here. I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nleave your boat altogether, and it\xe2\x80\x99s no use asking Herr Davies; but\r\nwill _you_ drive into Esens with me and see a Frisian town\xe2\x80\x94for what\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s worth? You\xe2\x80\x99re getting a dismal impression of Friesland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI excused myself, said I would stop with Davies; we would walk out over\r\nthe sands and prospect for the evening\xe2\x80\x99s sail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctill the evening. Be ready for the\r\nwarp at 6.30.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe jumped up, and the cart rattled off through the mud, crossed the\r\nbridge, and disappeared into the dreary hinterland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nClearing the Air\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he gone to get the police, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go aboard before that Customs fellow\r\nbuttonholes us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA diminished row of stolid Frisians still ruminated over the\r\n_Dulcibella_. Friend Grimm was visible smoking on his forecastle. We\r\nwent on board in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, where exactly is Memmert?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nDavies pulled down the chart, said \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d and flung himself at full\r\nlength on a sofa.\r\n\r\nThe reader can see Memmert for himself. South of Juist, _[See Map B]_\r\nabutting on the Ems delta, lies an extensive sandbank called Nordland,\r\nwhose extreme western rim remains uncovered at the highest tides; the\r\neffect being to leave a C-shaped island, a mere paring of sand like a\r\nboomerang, nearly two miles long, but only 150 yards or so broad, of\r\ncuriously symmetrical outline, except at one spot, where it bulges to\r\nthe width of a quarter of a mile. On the English chart its nakedness\r\nwas absolute, save for a beacon at the south; but the German chart\r\nmarked a building at the point where the bulge occurs. This was\r\nevidently the dep\xc3\xb4t. \xe2\x80\x9cFancy living there!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, for the very name\r\nstruck cold. No wonder Grimm was grim; and no wonder he was used to\r\nseek change of air. But the advantages of the site were obvious. It was\r\nremarkably isolated, even in a region where isolation is the rule; yet\r\nit was conveniently near the wreck, which, as we had heard, lay two\r\nmiles out on the Juister Reef. Lastly, it was clearly accessible at any\r\nstate of the tide, for the six-fathom channel of the Ems estuary runs\r\nhard up to it on the south, and thence sends off an eastward branch\r\nwhich closely borders the southern horn, thus offering an anchorage at\r\nonce handy, deep, and sheltered from seaward gales.\r\n\r\nSuch was Memmert, as I saw it on the chart, taking in its features\r\nmechanically, for while Davies lay there heedless and taciturn, a\r\npretence of interest was useless. I knew perfectly well what was\r\nbetween us, but I did not see why I should make the first move; for I\r\nhad a grievance too, an old one. So I sat back on my sofa and jotted\r\ndown in my notebook the heads of our conversation at the inn while it\r\nwas fresh in my memory, and strove to draw conclusions. But the silence\r\ncontinuing and becoming absurd, I threw my pride to the winds, and my\r\nnotebook on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully sorry I chaffed you about\r\nFr\xc3\xa4ulein Dollmann.\xe2\x80\x9d (No answer.) \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you see I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to Heaven we had never come in here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a hard voice;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit comes of landing _ever_.\xe2\x80\x9d (I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help smiling at this, but he\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking at me.) \xe2\x80\x9cHere we are, given away, moved on, taken in\r\ncharge, arranged for like Cook\xe2\x80\x99s tourists. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t follow your\r\ngame\xe2\x80\x94too infernally deep for me, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d That stung me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI did my best. It was you that muddled it. Why\r\ndid you harp on ducks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could have got out of that. Why did you harp on everything\r\nidiotic\xe2\x80\x94your letter, the Foreign Office, the _Kormoran_, the wreck,\r\nthe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re utterly unreasonable. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you see what traps there were? I\r\nwas driven the way I went. We started unprepared, and we\xe2\x80\x99re jolly well\r\nout of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies drove on blindly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was bad enough telling all about the\r\nchannels and exploring\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you agreed to that yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave in to you. We can\xe2\x80\x99t explore any more now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the wreck, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hang the wreck! It\xe2\x80\x99s all a blind, or he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made so much\r\nof it. There are all these channels to be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hang the channels! I know we wanted a free hand, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\ngo to Norderney some time, and if Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s away\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you harp on Miss Dollmann?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\nWe had worked round, through idle recrimination, to the real point of\r\ndeparture. I knew Davies was not himself, and would not return to\r\nhimself till the heart of the matter was reached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou brought me out here to help you, because, as\r\nyou say, I was clever, talked German, and\xe2\x80\x94liked yachting (I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nresist adding this). But directly you really _want_ me you turn round\r\nand go for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean all that, really,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\x94I was\r\nworried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know; but it\xe2\x80\x99s your own fault. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t been fair with me.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a complication in this business that you\xe2\x80\x99ve never talked about.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never pressed you because I thought you would confide in me.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see the result. Our hand was forced. To have said nothing\r\nabout Dollmann was folly\xe2\x80\x94to have said he tried to wreck you was equal\r\nfolly. The story we agreed on was the best and safest, and you told it\r\nsplendidly. But for two reasons I had to harp on the daughter\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nbecause your manner when they were mentioned was so confused as to\r\nimperil our whole position. Two, because your story, though the safest,\r\nwas, at the best, suspicious. Even on your own showing Dollmann treated\r\nyou badly\xe2\x80\x94discourteously, say: though you pretended not to have seen\r\nit. You want a motive to neutralise that, and induce you to revisit him\r\nin a friendly way. I supplied it, or rather I only encouraged von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning to supply it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy revisit him, after all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you see what a hideous fix you\xe2\x80\x99ve put me in? How caddish I\r\nfeel about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did see, and I felt a cad myself, as his full distress came home to\r\nme. But I felt, too, that, whosesoever the fault, we had drifted into a\r\nridiculous situation, and were like characters in one of those tiresome\r\nplays where misunderstandings are manufactured and so carefully\r\nsustained that the audience are too bored to wait for the _d\xc3\xa9nouement._\r\nYou can do that on the stage; but we wanted our _d\xc3\xa9nouement._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish you had told me all about it.\r\nWon\xe2\x80\x99t you now? Just the bare, matter-of-fact truth. I hate sentiment,\r\nand so do you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI find it very difficult to tell people things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cthings\r\nlike this.\xe2\x80\x9d I waited. \xe2\x80\x9cI did like her\xe2\x80\x94very much.\xe2\x80\x9d Our eyes met for a\r\nsecond, in which all was said that need be said, as between two of our\r\nphlegmatic race. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94separate from him. That was the reason of\r\nall my indecisions.\xe2\x80\x9d he hurried on. \xe2\x80\x9cI only told you half at Schlei. I\r\nknow I ought to have been open, and asked your advice. But I let it\r\nslide. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hoping all along that we might find what we want and\r\nwin the game without coming to close quarters again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI no longer wondered at his devotion to the channel theory, since,\r\nbuilt on conviction, it was thus doubly fortified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you always knew what might happen,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt Schlei you spoke\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98settling with\xe2\x80\x99 Dollmann.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. When I thought of him I was mad. I made myself forget the\r\nother part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich recurred at Brunsb\xc3\xbcttel?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought of the news we had there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavies, we must have no more secrets. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to speak out. Are you\r\nsure you\xe2\x80\x99ve not misunderstood her? You say\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to assume\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94that Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s a traitor and a murderer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hang the murder part!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does _that_\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, traitor. Very good; but in that case I suspect his daughter. No!\r\nlet me go on. She was useful, to say the least. She encouraged\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve told me that\xe2\x80\x94to make that passage with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, Carruthers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you mean kindly; but\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s no use. I believe in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve something to propose. When we get out of\r\nthis place let\xe2\x80\x99s sail straight away to England.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c(There, Commander von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cyou never can say I neglected your advice.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Davies, starting up and facing me. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hanged if we\r\nwill. Think what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake. Think of that traitor\xe2\x80\x94plotting with\r\nGermans. My God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m with you for going on. But let\xe2\x80\x99s face facts.\r\nWe _must_ scotch Dollmann. We can\xe2\x80\x99t do so without hurting _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we _possibly_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not; be sensible, man. Face that. Next point; it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd to\r\nhope that we need not revisit them\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s ten to one that we must, if\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re to succeed. His attempt on you is the whole foundation of our\r\nsuspicions. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t even know for certain who he _is_ yet. We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncommitted, I know, to going straight to Norderney now; but even if we\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t, should we do any good by exploring and prying? It\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\ndoubtful. We know we\xe2\x80\x99re watched, if not suspected, and that disposes of\r\nnine-tenths of our power. The channels? Yes, but is it likely they\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlet us learn them by heart, if they\xe2\x80\x99re of such vital importance, even\r\nif we are thought to be _bona fide_ yachtsmen? And, seriously, apart\r\nfrom their value in war, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny, are they at the root of\r\nthis business? But we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about that in a moment. The point now is,\r\nwhat shall we do if we meet the Dollmanns?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeads of sweat stood on Davies\xe2\x80\x99s brow. I felt like a torturer, but it\r\ncould not be helped. \xe2\x80\x9cTax him with having wrecked you? Our quest would\r\nbe at an end! We must be friendly. You must tell the story you told\r\nto-day, and chance his believing it. If he does, so much the better; if\r\nhe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, he won\xe2\x80\x99t dare say so, and we still have chances. We gain\r\ntime, and have a tremendous hold on him\xe2\x80\x94_if_ we\xe2\x80\x99re friendly.\xe2\x80\x9d Davies\r\nwinced. I gave another turn to the screw. \xe2\x80\x9cFriendly with them _both,_\r\nof course. You were before, you know; you liked her very much\xe2\x80\x94you must\r\nseem to still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, stop your infernal logic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we chuck it and go to England?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked again, as an inquisitor\r\nmight say, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you had enough?\xe2\x80\x9d No answer. I went on: \xe2\x80\x9cTo make it\r\neasier, you _do_ like her still.\xe2\x80\x9d I had roused my victim at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil do you mean, Carruthers? That I\xe2\x80\x99m to trade on my liking\r\nfor her\xe2\x80\x94on her innocence, to\xe2\x80\x94good God! what _do_ you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not that. I\xe2\x80\x99m not such a cad, or such a fool, or so ignorant\r\nof you. If she knows nothing of her father\xe2\x80\x99s character and likes\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94and you like her\xe2\x80\x94and you are what you are\xe2\x80\x94oh Heavens! man, face it,\r\nrealise it! But what I mean is this: is she, _can_ she be, what you\r\nthink? Imagine his position if we\xe2\x80\x99re right about him; the vilest\r\ncreature on God\xe2\x80\x99s earth\xe2\x80\x94a disgraceful past to have been driven to\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94in the pay of Germany. I want to spare you misery.\xe2\x80\x9d I was going to\r\nadd: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you\xe2\x80\x99re on your guard, to increase our chances.\xe2\x80\x9d But the\r\nutter futility of such suggestions silenced me. What a plan I had\r\nforeshadowed! An enticing plan and a fair one, too, as against such\r\nadversaries; turning this baffling cross-current to advantage as many a\r\ntime we had worked eddies of an adverse tide in these difficult seas.\r\nBut Davies was Davies, and there was an end of it; his faith and\r\nsimplicity shamed me. And the pity of it, the cruelty of it, was that\r\nhis very qualities were his last torture, raising to the acutest pitch\r\nthe conflict between love and patriotism. Remember that the latter was\r\nhis dominant life-motive, and that here and now was his chance\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\nwould gauge the bitterness of that conflict.\r\n\r\nIt was in its last throes now. His elbows were on the table, and his\r\ntwitching hands pressed on his forehead. He took them away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we must go on. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you believe in her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll remember what you\xe2\x80\x99ve said. There may be some way out. And\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nrather not talk about that any more. What about the wreck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFurther argument was futile. Davies by an effort seemed to sweep the\r\nsubject from his thoughts, and I did my best to do the same. At any\r\nrate the air was cleared\xe2\x80\x94we were friends; and it only remained to\r\ngrapple with the main problem in the light of the morning\xe2\x80\x99s interview.\r\n\r\nEvery word that I could recollect of that critical conversation I\r\nreviewed with Davies, who had imperfectly understood what he had not\r\nbeen directly concerned in; and, as I did so, I began to see with what\r\ncleverness each succeeding sentence of von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s was designed to\r\nsuit both of two contingencies. If we were innocent travellers, he was\r\nthe genial host, communicative and helpful. If we were spies, his\r\ntactics had been equally applicable. He had outdone us in apparent\r\ncandour, hiding nothing which he knew we would discover for ourselves,\r\nand contriving at the same time both to gain knowledge and control of\r\nour movements, and to convey us warnings, which would only be\r\nunderstood if we were guilty, that we were playing an idle and perilous\r\ngame, and had better desist. But in one respect we had had the\r\nadvantage, and that was in the version Davies had given of his\r\nstranding on the Hohenh\xc3\xb6rn. Inscrutable as our questioner was, he let\r\nit appear not only that the incident was new to him, but that he\r\nconjectured at its sinister significance. A little cross-examination on\r\ndetail would have been fatal to Davies\xe2\x80\x99s version; but that was where\r\nour strength lay; he dared not cross-examine for fear of suggesting to\r\nDavies suspicions which he might never have felt. Indeed, I thought I\r\ndetected that fear underlying his whole attitude towards us, and it\r\nstrengthened a conviction which had been growing in me since Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfurtive midnight visit, that the secret of this coast was of so\r\nimportant and delicate a nature that rather than attract attention to\r\nit at all, overt action against intruders would be taken only in the\r\nlast resort, and on irrefragable proofs of guilty intention.\r\n\r\nNow for our clues. I had come away with two, each the germ of a\r\ndistinct theory, and both obscured by the prevailing ambiguity. Now,\r\nhowever, as we thumbed the chart and I gave full rein to my fancy, one\r\nof them, the idea of Memmert, gained precision and vigour every moment.\r\nTrue, such information as we had about the French wreck and his own\r\nconnection with it was placed most readily at our disposal by von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning; but I took it to be information calculated only to forestall\r\nsuspicion, since he was aware that we already associated him with\r\nDollmann, possibly also with Grimm, and it was only likely that in the\r\nordinary course we should learn that the trio were jointly concerned in\r\nMemmert. So much for the facts; as for the construction he wished us to\r\nput on them, I felt sure it was absolutely false. He wished to give us\r\nthe impression that the buried treasure itself was at the root of any\r\nmystery we might have scented. I do not know if the reader fully\r\nappreciated that astute suggestion\xe2\x80\x94the hint that secrecy as to results\r\nwas necessary owing both to the great sum at stake and the flaw in the\r\ntitle, which he had been careful to inform us had passed through\r\nBritish hands. What he meant to imply was, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if you\r\nhave midnight visitors; Englishmen prowling along this coast are\r\nsuspected of being Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s agents.\xe2\x80\x9d An ingenious insinuation, which, at\r\nthe time it was made, had caused me to contemplate a new and much more\r\ncommonplace solution of our enigma than had ever occurred to us; but it\r\nwas only a passing doubt, and I dismissed it altogether now.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, it either explained everything or nothing. As long as we\r\nheld to our fundamental assumption\xe2\x80\x94that Davies had been decoyed into a\r\ndeath-trap in September\xe2\x80\x94it explained nothing. It was too fantastic to\r\nsuppose that the exigencies of a commercial speculation would lead to\r\nsuch extremities as that. We were not in the South Sea Islands; nor\r\nwere we the puppets of a romance. We were in Europe, dealing not only\r\nwith a Dollmann, but with an officer of the German Imperial Navy, who\r\nwould scarcely be connected with a commercial enterprise which could\r\nconceivably be reduced to forwarding its objects in such a fashion. It\r\nwas shocking enough to find him in relations with such a scoundrel at\r\nall, but it was explicable if the motive were imperial\xe2\x80\x94not so if it\r\nwere financial. No; to accept the suggestion we must declare the whole\r\nquest a mare\xe2\x80\x99s nest from beginning to end; the attempt on Davies a\r\ndelusion of his own fancy, the whole structure we had built on it,\r\nbaseless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I can hear the reader saying, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not? You, at any rate, were\r\nalways a little sceptical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGranted; yet I can truthfully say I scarcely faltered for a moment.\r\nMuch had happened since Schlei Fiord. I had seen the mechanism of the\r\ndeath-trap; I had lived with Davies for a stormy fortnight, every hour\r\nof which had increased my reliance on his seamanship, and also,\r\ntherefore, on his account of an event which depended largely for its\r\ncorrect interpretation on a balanced nautical judgement. Finally, I had\r\nbeen unconsciously realising, and knew from his mouth to-day, that he\r\nhad exercised and acted on that judgement in the teeth of personal\r\nconsiderations, which his loyal nature made overwhelming in their\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the meaning of Memmert? At the outset it riveted my\r\nattention on the Ems estuary, whose mouth it adjoins. We had always\r\nrather neglected the Ems in our calculations; with some excuse, too,\r\nfor at first sight its importance bears no proportion to that of the\r\nthree greater estuaries. The latter bear vessels of the largest tonnage\r\nand deepest draught to the very quays of Hamburg, Bremerhaven, and the\r\nnaval dockyard of Wilhelmshaven; while two of them, the Elbe and the\r\nWeser, are commerce carriers on the vastest scale for the whole empire.\r\nThe Ems, on the other hand, only serves towns of the second class. A\r\nglance at the chart explains this. You see a most imposing estuary on a\r\ngrander scale than any of the other three taken singly, with a length\r\nof thirty miles and a frontage on the North Sea of ten miles, or\r\none-seventieth, roughly, of the whole seaboard; encumbered by outlying\r\nshoals, and blocked in the centre by the island of Borkum, but\r\npresenting two fine deep-water channels to the incoming vessel. These\r\nroll superbly through enormous sheets of sand, unite and approach the\r\nmainland in one stately stream three miles in breadth. But then comes a\r\nsad falling off. The navigable fairway shoals and shrinks, middle\r\ngrounds obstruct it, and shelving foreshores persistently deny it that\r\neasy access to the land that alone can create great seaboard cities.\r\nAll the ports of the Ems are tidal; the harbour of Delfzyl, on the\r\nDutch side, dries at low water, and Emden, the principal German port,\r\ncan only be reached by a lock and a mile of canal.\r\n\r\nBut this depreciation is only relative. Judged on its merits, and not\r\nby the standard of the Elbe, it is a very important river. Emden is a\r\nflourishing and growing port. For shallow craft the stream is navigable\r\nfar into the interior, where, aided by tributaries and allied canals\r\n(notably the connection with the Rhine at Dortmund, then approaching\r\ncompletion), it taps the resources of a great area. Strategically there\r\nwas still less reason for underrating it. It is one of the great\r\nmaritime gates of Germany; and it is the westernmost gate, the nearest\r\nto Great Britain and France, contiguous to Holland. Its great forked\r\ndelta presents two yawning breaches in that singular rampart of islets\r\nand shoals which masks the German seaboard\xe2\x80\x94a seaboard itself so short\r\nin proportion to the empire\xe2\x80\x99s bulk, that, as Davies used to say, \xe2\x80\x9cevery\r\ninch of it must be important.\xe2\x80\x9d Warships could force these breaches, and\r\nso threaten the mainland at one of its few vulnerable points. Quay\r\naccommodation is no object to such visitors; intricate navigation no\r\ndeterrent. Even the heaviest battleships could approach within striking\r\ndistance of the land, while cruisers and military transports could\r\npenetrate to the level of Emden itself. Emden, as Davies had often\r\npointed out, is connected by canal with Wilhelmshaven on the Jade, a\r\nstrategic canal, designed to carry gunboats as well as merchandise.\r\n\r\nNow Memmert was part of the outer rampart; its tapering sickle of sand\r\ndirectly commanded the eastern breach; it _must_ be connected with the\r\ndefence of this breach. No more admirable base could be imagined;\r\nself-contained and isolated, yet sheltered, accessible\xe2\x80\x94better than\r\nJuist and Borkum. And supposing it were desired to shroud the nature of\r\nthe work in absolute secrecy, what a pretext lay to hand in the wreck\r\nand its buried bullion, which lay in the offing opposite the fairway!\r\n\r\nOn Memmert was the dep\xc3\xb4t for the salvage operations. Salvage work, with\r\nits dredging and diving, offered precisely the disguise that was\r\nneeded. It was submarine, and so are some of the most important\r\ndefences of ports, mines, and dirigible torpedoes. All the details of\r\nthe story were suggestive: the \xe2\x80\x9csmall local company\xe2\x80\x9d; the \xe2\x80\x9cengineer\r\nfrom Bremen\xe2\x80\x9d (who, I wondered, was he?); the few shares held by von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning, enough to explain his visits; the stores and gear coming from\r\nWilhelmshaven, a naval dockyard.\r\n\r\nTry as I would I could not stir Davies\xe2\x80\x99s imagination as mine was\r\nstirred. He was bent on only seeing the objections, which, of course,\r\nwere numerous enough. Could secrecy be ensured under pretext of salving\r\na wreck? It must be a secret shared by many\xe2\x80\x94divers, crews of tugs,\r\nemployees of all sorts. I answered that trade secrets are often\r\npreserved under no less difficult conditions, and why not imperial\r\nsecrets?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the Ems and not the Elbe?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Elbe, too, holds similar mysteries.\xe2\x80\x9d Neuerk\r\nIsland might, for all we knew, be another Memmert; when cruising in\r\nthat region we had had no eyes for such things, absorbed in a\r\npreconceived theory of our own. Besides, we must not take ourselves too\r\nseriously. We were amateurs, not experts in coast defence, and on such\r\nvague grounds to fastidiously reject a clue which went so far as this\r\none was to quarrel with our luck. There was a disheartening corollary\r\nto this latter argument that in my new-born zeal I shut my eyes to. As\r\namateurs, were we capable of using our clue and gaining exact knowledge\r\nof the defences in question? Davies, I knew, felt this strongly, and I\r\nthink it accounted for his lukewarm view of Memmert more than he was\r\naware. He clung more obstinately than ever to his \xe2\x80\x9cchannel theory\xe2\x80\x9d,\r\nconscious that it offered the one sort of opportunity of which with his\r\npeculiar gifts he was able to take advantage. He admitted, however,\r\nthat it was under a cloud at present, for if knowledge of the coastwise\r\nnavigation were a crime in itself we should scarcely be sitting here\r\nnow. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something to do with it, anyhow!\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nImperial Escort\r\n\r\n\r\nMemmert gripped me, then, to the exclusion of a rival notion which had\r\ngiven me no little perplexity during the conversation with von Br\xc3\xbcning.\r\nHis reiterated advice that we should lose no time in picking up our\r\nanchor and chain had ended by giving me the idea that he was anxious to\r\nget us away from Bensersiel and the mainland. At first I had taken the\r\nadvice partly as a test of our veracity (as I gave the reader to\r\nunderstand), and partly as an indirect method of lulling any suspicions\r\nwhich Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s midnight visit may have caused. Then it struck me that\r\nthis might be over-subtlety on my part, and the idea recurred when the\r\nquestion of our future plans cropped up, and hampered me in deciding on\r\na course. It returned again when von Br\xc3\xbcning offered to tow us out in\r\nthe evening. It was in my mind when I questioned him as to his business\r\nashore, for it occurred to me that perhaps his landing here was not\r\nsolely due to a wish to inspect the crew of the _Dulcibella_. Then came\r\nhis perfectly frank explanation (with its sinister _double entente_ for\r\nus), coupled with an invitation to me to accompany him to Esens. But,\r\non the principle of _timeo Danaos_ etc., I instantly smelt a ruse, not\r\nthat I dreamt that I was to be decoyed into captivity; but if there was\r\nanything here which we two might discover in the few hours left to us,\r\nit was an ingenious plan to remove the most observant of the two till\r\nthe hour of departure.\r\n\r\nDavies scorned them, and I had felt only a faint curiosity in these\r\ninsignificant hamlets, influenced, I am afraid, chiefly by a hankering\r\nafter _terra firma_ which the pitiless rigour of his training had been\r\nunable to cure.\r\n\r\nBut it was imprudent to neglect the slightest chance. It was three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and I think both our brains were beginning to be addled with\r\nthinking in close confinement. I suggested that we should finish our\r\ncouncil of war in the open, and we both donned oilskins and turned out.\r\nThe sky had hardened and banked into an even canopy of lead, and the\r\nwind drove before it a fine cold rain. You could hear the murmur of the\r\nrising flood on the sands outside, but the harbour was high above it\r\nstill, and the _Dulcibella_ and the other boats squatted low in a bed\r\nof black slime. Native interest seemed to be at last assuaged, for not\r\na soul was visible on the bank (I cannot call it a quay); but the top\r\nof a black sou\xe2\x80\x99wester with a feather of smoke curling round it showed\r\nabove the forehatch of the _Kormoran_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could get a look at your cargo, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nWe gazed at Bensersiel in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can\xe2\x80\x99t be anything _here_?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _can_ there be?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about that dyke?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with a sudden inspiration.\r\n\r\nFrom the bank we could see all along the coast-line, which is dyked\r\ncontinuously, as I have already said. The dyke was here a substantial\r\nbrick-faced embankment, very similar, though on a smaller scale, to\r\nthat which had bordered the Elbe near Cuxhaven, and over whose summit\r\nwe had seen the snouts of guns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think this coast could be invaded?\r\nAlong here, I mean, behind these islands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing in it. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the very last place on earth where a landing\r\nwould be possible. No transport could get nearer than where the _Blitz_\r\nis lying, four miles out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you say every inch of this coast is important?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the _water_ I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I want to see that dyke. Let\xe2\x80\x99s walk along it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mushroom theory died directly I set foot on it. It was the most\r\ninnocent structure in the world\xe2\x80\x94like a thousand others in Essex and\r\nHolland\xe2\x80\x94topped by a narrow path, where we walked in single file with\r\narms akimbo to keep our balance in the gusts of wind. Below us lay the\r\nsands on one side and rank fens on the other, interspersed with squares\r\nof pasture ringed in with ditches. After half a mile we dropped down\r\nand came back by a short circuit inland, following a mazy path\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwas mostly right angles and minute plank bridges, till we came to the\r\nEsens road. We crossed this and soon after found our way barred by the\r\nstream I spoke of. This involved a _d\xc3\xa9tour_ to the bridge in the\r\nvillage, and a stealthy avoidance of the post-office, for dread of its\r\ngarrulous occupant. Then we followed the dyke in the other direction,\r\nand ended by a circuit over the sands, which were fast being covered by\r\nthe tide, and so back to the yacht.\r\n\r\nNobody appeared to have taken the slightest notice of our movements.\r\n\r\nAs we walked we had tackled the last question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nfound very little to say on it. We were to leave to-night (unless the\r\nEsens police appeared on the scene), and were committed to sailing\r\ndirect to Norderney, as the only alternative to duck-shooting under the\r\nespionage of a \xe2\x80\x9ctrustworthy\xe2\x80\x9d nominee of von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s. Beyond\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94vagueness and difficulty of every sort.\r\n\r\nAt Norderney I should be fettered by my letter. If it seemed to have\r\nbeen opened and it ordered my return, I was limited to a week, or must\r\nrisk suspicion by staying. Dollmann was away (according to von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning), \xe2\x80\x9cwould probably be back soon\xe2\x80\x9d; but how soon? Beyond Norderney\r\nlay Memmert. How to probe its secret? The ardour it had roused in me\r\nwas giving way to a mortifying sense of impotence. The sight of the\r\n_Kormoran_, with her crew preparing for sea, was a pointed comment on\r\nmy diplomacy, and most of all on my ridiculous survey of the dykes.\r\nWhen all was said and done we were _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9s_ of von Br\xc3\xbcning, and\r\ndogged by Grimm. Was it likely they would let us succeed?\r\n\r\nThe tide was swirling into the harbour in whorls of chocolate froth,\r\nand as it rose all Bensersiel, dominated as before by Herr Schenkel,\r\nstraggled down to the quay to watch the movements of shipping during\r\nthe transient but momentous hour when the mud-hole was a seaport. The\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s steam-cutter was already afloat, and her sailors busy with\r\nsidelights and engines. When it became known that we, too, were to\r\nsail, and under such distinguished escort, the excitement intensified.\r\n\r\nAgain our friend of the Customs was spreading out papers to sign, while\r\na throng of helpful Frisians, headed by the twin giants of the\r\npost-boat, thronged our decks and made us ready for sea in their own\r\nconfused fashion. Again we were carried up to the inn and overwhelmed\r\nwith advice, and warnings, and farewell toasts. Then back again to find\r\nthe _Dulcibella_ afloat, and von Br\xc3\xbcning just arrived, cursing the\r\nweather and the mud, chaffing Davies, genial and _d\xc3\xa9bonnaire_ as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStow that mainsail, you won\xe2\x80\x99t want it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tow you right\r\nout to Spiekeroog. It\xe2\x80\x99s your only anchorage for the night in this\r\nwind\xe2\x80\x94under the island, near the _Blitz_, and that would mean a dead\r\nbeat for you in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fact was so true, and the offer so timely, that Davies\xe2\x80\x99s faint\r\nprotests were swept aside in a torrent of ridicule.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d the Commander ended, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make the trip with\r\nyou, if I may. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be pleasanter and drier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all three boarded the _Dulcibella_, and then the end came. Our\r\ntow-rope was attached, and at half-past six the little launch jumped\r\ninto the collar, and amidst a demonstration that could not have been\r\nmore hearty if we had been ambassadors on a visit to a friendly power,\r\nwe sidled out through the jetties.\r\n\r\nIt took us more than an hour to cover the five miles to Spiekeroog, for\r\nthe _Dulcibella_ was a heavy load in the stiff head wind, and Davies,\r\nthough he said nothing, showed undisguised distrust of our tug\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncapacities. He at once left the helm to me and flung himself on the\r\ngear, not resting till every rope was ready to hand, the mainsail\r\nreefed, the binnacle lighted, and all ready for setting sail or\r\nanchoring at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Our guest watched these precautions\r\nwith infinite amusement. He was in the highest and most mischievous\r\nhumour, raining banter on Davies and mock sympathy on me, laughing at\r\nour huge compass, heaving the lead himself, startling us with imaginary\r\nsoundings, and doubting if his men were sober. I offered entertainment\r\nand warmth below, but he declined on the ground that Davies would be\r\ntempted to cut the tow-rope and make us pass the night on a safe\r\nsandbank. Davies took the raillery unmoved. His work done, he took the\r\ntiller and sat bareheaded, intent on the launch, the course, the\r\ndetails, and chances of the present. I brought up cigars and we settled\r\nourselves facing him, our backs to the wind and spray. And so we made\r\nthe rest of the passage, von Br\xc3\xbcning cuddled against me and the\r\ncabin-hatch, alternately shouting a jest to Davies and talking to me in\r\na light and charming vein, with just that shade of patronage that the\r\ndisparity in our ages warranted, about my time in Germany, places,\r\npeople, and books I knew, and about life, especially young men\xe2\x80\x99s life,\r\nin England, a country he had never visited, but hoped to; I responding\r\nas well as I could, striving to meet his mood, acquit myself like a\r\nman, draw zest instead of humiliation from the irony of our position,\r\nbut scarcely able to make headway against a numbing sense of defeat and\r\nincapacity. A queer thought was haunting me, too, that such skill and\r\njudgement as I possessed was slipping from me as we left the land and\r\nfaced again the rigours of this exacting sea. Davies, I very well knew,\r\nwas under exactly the opposite spell\xe2\x80\x94a spell which even the reproach of\r\nthe tow-rope could not annul. His face, in the glow of the binnacle,\r\nwas beginning to wear that same look of contentment and resolve that I\r\nhad seen on it that night we had sailed to Kiel from Schlei Fiord.\r\nHeaven knows he had more cause for worry than I\xe2\x80\x94a casual comrade in an\r\nadventure which was peculiarly his, which meant everything on earth to\r\nhim; but there he was, washing away perplexity in the salt wind,\r\ndrawing counsel and confidence from the unfailing source of all his\r\ninspirations\xe2\x80\x94the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooks happy, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain once. I grunted that he\r\ndid, ashamed to find how irritated the remark made me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll remember what I said,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in my ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I should like to see her. What _is_ she like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d I could well believe it.\r\n\r\nThe hull of the _Blitz_ loomed up, and a minute later our kedge was\r\nsplashing overboard and the launch was backing alongside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said our passenger. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re safe enough here,\r\nand you can run across in ten minutes in the morning and pick up your\r\nanchor, if it\xe2\x80\x99s there still. Then you\xe2\x80\x99ve a fair wind west\xe2\x80\x94to England if\r\nyou like. If you decide to stay a little longer in these parts, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin reach, count on me to help you, to sport or anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe thanked him, shook hands, and he was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a thundering good chap, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; and I heartily\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nThe narrow vigilant life began again at once. We were \xe2\x80\x9csafe enough\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\na sense, but a warp and a twenty-pound anchor were poor security if the\r\nwind backed or increased. Plans for contingencies had to be made, and\r\ndeck-watches kept till midnight, when the weather seemed to improve,\r\nand stars appeared. The glass was rising, so we turned in and slept\r\nunder the very wing, so to speak, of the Imperial Government.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavies,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, when we were settled in our bunks, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s only a day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsail to Norderney, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a fair wind, less, if we go outside the islands direct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s settled that we do that to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get the anchor first. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nThe Rubicon\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, vaporous dawn, the glass rising, and the wind fallen to\r\na light air still from the north-east. Our creased and sodden sails\r\nscarcely answered to it as we crept across the oily swell to Langeoog.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFogs and calms,\xe2\x80\x9d Davies prophesied. The _Blitz_ was astir when we\r\npassed her, and soon after steamed out to sea. Once over the bar, she\r\nturned westward and was lost to view in the haze. I should be sorry to\r\nhave to explain how we found that tiny anchor-buoy, on the\r\nexpressionless waste of grey. I only know that I hove the lead\r\nincessantly while Davies conned, till at last he was grabbing overside\r\nwith the boathook, and there was the buoy on deck. The cable was soon\r\nfollowing it, and finally the rusty monster himself, more loathsome\r\nthan usual, after his long sojourn in the slime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we can go anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s Norderney, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? We\xe2\x80\x99ve settled that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose we have. I was wondering whether it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nshortest to go inside Langeoog after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely not,\xe2\x80\x9d I urged. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tide\xe2\x80\x99s ebbing now, and the light\xe2\x80\x99s bad;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s new ground, with a \xe2\x80\x98watershed\xe2\x80\x99 to cross, and we\xe2\x80\x99re safe to get\r\naground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right\xe2\x80\x94outside. Ready about.\xe2\x80\x9d We swung lazily round and headed for\r\nthe open sea. I record the fact, but in truth Davies might have taken\r\nme where he liked, for no land was visible, only a couple of ghostly\r\nbooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a pity to miss over that channel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies with a sigh;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cjust when the _Kormoran_ can\xe2\x80\x99t watch us.\xe2\x80\x9d (We had not seen her at all\r\nthis morning.)\r\n\r\nI set myself to the lead again, averse to reopening a barren argument.\r\nGrimm had done his work for the present, I felt certain, and was on his\r\nway by the shortest road to Norderney and Memmert.\r\n\r\nWe were soon outside and heading west, our boom squared away and the\r\nisland sand-dunes just apparent under our lee. Then the breeze died to\r\nthe merest draught, and left us rolling inert in a long swell. Consumed\r\nwith impatience to get on I saw fatality in this failure of wind, after\r\na fortnight of unprofitable meanderings, when we had generally had too\r\nmuch of it, and always enough for our purpose. I tried to read below,\r\nbut the vile squirting of the centreboard drove me up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we go any faster?\xe2\x80\x9d I burst out once. I felt that there ought to\r\nbe a pyramid of gauzy canvas aloft, spinnakers, flying jibs and what\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t go in for speed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, shortly. He loyally did his\r\nbest to \xe2\x80\x9cshove her\xe2\x80\x9d along, but puffs and calms were the rule all day,\r\nand it was only by towing in the dinghy for two hours in the afternoon\r\nthat we covered the length of Langeoog, and crept before dark to an\r\nanchorage behind Baltrum, its slug-shaped neighbour on the west.\r\nStrictly, I believe, we should have kept the sea all night; but I had\r\nnot the grit to suggest that course, and Davies was only too glad of an\r\nexcuse for threading the shoals of the Accumer Ee on a rising tide. The\r\natmosphere had been slowly clearing as the day wore on; but we had\r\nscarcely anchored ten minutes before a blanket of white fog, rolling in\r\nfrom seaward, swallowed us up. Davies was already afield in the dinghy,\r\nand I had to guide him back with a foghorn, whose music roused hosts of\r\nsea birds from the surrounding flats, and brought them wheeling and\r\ncomplaining round us, a weird invisible chorus to my mournful solo.\r\n\r\nThe fog hung heavy still at daybreak on the 20th, but dispersed\r\npartially under a catspaw from the south about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, in time\r\nfor us to traverse the boomed channel behind Baltrum, before the tide\r\nleft the watershed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shan\xe2\x80\x99t get far to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, with philosophy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this\r\nsort of thing may go on for any time. It\xe2\x80\x99s a regular autumn\r\nanti-cyclone\xe2\x80\x94glass thirty point five and steady. That gale was the last\r\nof a stormy equinox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe took the inside route as a matter of course to-day. It was now the\r\nshortest to Norderney harbour, and scarcely less intricate than the\r\nWichter Ee, which appeared to be almost totally blocked by banks, and\r\nis, in fact, the most impassable of all these outlets to the North Sea.\r\nBut, as I say, this sort of navigation, always puzzling to me, was\r\nutterly bewildering in hazy weather. Any attempt at orientation made me\r\ngiddy. So I slaved at the lead, varying my labour with a fierce bout of\r\nkedge-work when we grounded somewhere. I had two rests before two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, one of an hour, when we ran into a patch of windless fog;\r\nanother of a few moments, when Davies said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Norderney!\xe2\x80\x9d and I\r\nsaw, surmounting a long slope of weedy sand, still wet with the\r\nreceding sea, a cluster of sandhills exactly like a hundred others I\r\nhad seen of late, but fraught with a new and unique interest.\r\n\r\nThe usual formula, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got now?\xe2\x80\x9d checked my reverie, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelm\xe2\x80\x99s a-lee,\xe2\x80\x9d ended it for the time. We tacked on (for the wind had\r\nheaded us) in very shoal water.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Davies said: \xe2\x80\x9cIs that a boat ahead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that galliot?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. I could plainly distinguish one of\r\nthose familiar craft about half a mile away, just within the limit of\r\nvision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _Kormoran_, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d I added. Davies said nothing, but grew\r\ninattentive to his work. \xe2\x80\x9cBarely four,\xe2\x80\x9d from me passed unnoticed, and\r\nwe touched once, but swung off under some play of the current. Then\r\ncame abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cStand by the anchor. Let go,\xe2\x80\x9d and we brought up in\r\nmid-stream of the narrow creek we were following. I triced up the\r\nmain-tack, and stowed the headsails unaided. When I had done Davies was\r\nstill gazing to windward through his binoculars, and, to my\r\nastonishment, I noticed that his hands were trembling violently. I had\r\nnever seen this happen before, even at moments when a false turn of the\r\nwrist meant death on a surf-battered bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked; \xe2\x80\x9care you cold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat little boat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. I gazed to windward, too, and now saw a\r\nscrap of white in the distance, in sharp relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmall standing lug and jib; it\xe2\x80\x99s her, right enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies to\r\nhimself, in a sort of nervous stammer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? What?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Medusa_\xe2\x80\x99s dinghy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed, or rather pushed, me the glasses, still gazing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDollmann?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s _hers_\xe2\x80\x94the one she always sails. She\xe2\x80\x99s come to meet m\xe2\x80\x94, us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough the glasses the white scrap became a graceful little sail,\r\nsquared away for the light following breeze. An angle of the creek hid\r\nthe hull, then it glided into view. Someone was sitting aft steering,\r\nman or woman I could not say, for the sail hid most of the figure. For\r\nfull two minutes\xe2\x80\x94two long, pregnant minutes\xe2\x80\x94we watched it in silence.\r\nThe damp air was fogging the lenses, but I kept them to my eyes; for I\r\ndid not want to look at Davies. At last I heard him draw a deep breath,\r\nstraighten himself up, and give one of his characteristic \xe2\x80\x9ch\xe2\x80\x99ms\xe2\x80\x9d. Then\r\nhe turned briskly aft, cast off the dinghy\xe2\x80\x99s painter, and pulled her up\r\nalongside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, jumping in, and fixing the rowlocks. (His\r\nhands were steady again.) I laughed, and shoved the dinghy off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather you did,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, defiantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather stay. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tidy up, and put the kettle on.\xe2\x80\x9d Davies had\r\ntaken a half stroke, but paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to come aboard.\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe might like to,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cChilly day, long way from home,\r\ncommon courtesy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarruthers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cif she comes aboard, please remember that\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s outside this business. There are no clues to be got from _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little lecture which would have nettled me more if I had not been\r\nexultantly telling myself that, once and for all, for good or ill, the\r\nRubicon was passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your affair this time,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9crun it as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sculled away with vigorous strokes. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as he is,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to\r\nmyself: bare head, beaded with fog-dew, ancient oilskin coat (only one\r\nbutton); grey jersey; grey woollen trousers (like a deep-sea\r\nfisherman\xe2\x80\x99s) stuffed into long boots. A vision of his antitype, the\r\nCowes Philanderer, crossed me for a second. As to his face\xe2\x80\x94well, I\r\ncould only judge by it, and marvel, that he was gripping his dilemma by\r\neither horn, as firmly as he gripped his sculls.\r\n\r\nI watched the two boats converging. They would meet in the natural\r\ncourse about three hundred yards away, but a hitch occurred. First, the\r\nsail-boat checked and slewed; \xe2\x80\x9caground,\xe2\x80\x9d I concluded. The rowboat leapt\r\nforward still; then checked, too. From both a great splashing of sculls\r\nfloated across the still air, then silence. The summit of the\r\nwatershed, a physical Rubicon, prosaic and slimy, had still to be\r\ncrossed, it seemed. But it could be evaded. Both boats headed for the\r\nnorthern side of the creek: two figures were out on the brink, hauling\r\non two painters. Then Davies was striding over the sand, and a girl\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncould see her now\xe2\x80\x94was coming to meet him. And then I thought it was\r\ntime to go below and tidy up.\r\n\r\nNothing on earth could have made the _Dulcibella_\xe2\x80\x99s saloon a worthy\r\nreception-room for a lady. I could only use hurried efforts to make it\r\nlook its best by plying a bunch of cotton-waste and a floor-brush; by\r\npitching into racks and lockers the litter of pipes, charts, oddments\r\nof apparel, and so on, that had a way of collecting afresh, however\r\nrecently we had tidied up; by neatly arranging our demoralised library,\r\nand by lighting the stove and veiling the table under a clean white\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nI suppose about twenty minutes had elapsed, and I was scrubbing\r\nfruitlessly at the smoky patch on the ceiling, when I heard the sound\r\nof oars and voices outside. I threw the cotton-waste into the fo\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99sle,\r\nmade an onslaught on my hands, and then mounted the companion ladder.\r\nOur own dinghy was just rounding up alongside, Davies sculling in the\r\nbows, facing him in the stern a young girl in a grey tam-o\xe2\x80\x99-shanter,\r\nloose waterproof jacket and dark serge skirt, the latter, to be\r\nfrigidly accurate, disclosing a pair of workman-like rubber boots\r\nwhich, _mutatis mutandis,_ were very like those Davies was wearing. Her\r\nhair, like his, was spangled with moisture, and her rose-brown skin\r\nstruck a note of delicious colour against the sullen Stygian\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. Never did his \xe2\x80\x9cmeiner Freund, Carruthers,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsound so pleasantly in my ears; never so discordantly the \xe2\x80\x9cFr\xc3\xa4ulein\r\nDollmann\xe2\x80\x9d that followed it. Every syllable of the four was a lie. Two\r\nhonest English eyes were looking up into mine; an honest English\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94is this insular nonsense? Perhaps so, but I stick to it\xe2\x80\x94a brown,\r\nfirm hand\xe2\x80\x94no, not so very small, my sentimental reader\xe2\x80\x94was clasping\r\nmine. Of course I had strong reasons, apart from the racial instinct,\r\nfor thinking her to be English, but I believe that if I had had none at\r\nall I should at any rate have congratulated Germany on a clever bit of\r\nplagiarism. By her voice, when she spoke, I knew that she must have\r\ntalked German habitually from childhood; diction and accent were\r\nfaultless, at least to my English ear; but the native constitutional\r\nring was wanting.\r\n\r\nShe came on board. There was a hollow discussion first about time and\r\nweather, but it ended as we all in our hearts wished it to end. None of\r\nus uttered our real scruples. Mine, indeed, were too new and\r\nrudimentary to be worth uttering, so I said common-sense things about\r\ntea and warmth; but I began to think about my compact with Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust for a few minutes, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nI held out my hand and swung her up. She gazed round the deck and\r\nrigging with profound interest\xe2\x80\x94a breathless, hungry interest\xe2\x80\x94touching\r\nto see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her before, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not been on board before,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nThis struck me in passing as odd; but then I had only too few details\r\nfrom Davies about his days at Norderney in September.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, _that_ is what puzzled me,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, suddenly,\r\npointing to the mizzen. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew there was something different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies had belayed the painter, and now had to explain the origin of\r\nthe mizzen. This was a cumbrous process, and his hearer\xe2\x80\x99s attention\r\nsoon wandered from the subject and became centred in him\xe2\x80\x94his was\r\nalready more than half in her\xe2\x80\x94and the result was a golden opportunity\r\nfor the discerning onlooker. It was very brief, but I made the most of\r\nit; buried deep a few regrets, did a little heartfelt penance, told\r\nmyself I had been a cynical fool not to have foreseen this, and faced\r\nthe new situation with a sinking heart; I am not ashamed to admit that,\r\nfor I was fond of Davies, and I was keen about the quest.\r\n\r\nShe had never been a guilty agent in that attempt on Davies. Had she\r\nbeen an unconscious tool or only an unwilling one? If the latter, did\r\nshe know the secret we were seeking? In the last degree unlikely, I\r\ndecided. But, true to the compact, whose importance I now fully\r\nappreciated, I flung aside my diplomatic weapons, recoiling, as\r\nstrongly, or nearly as strongly, let us say, from any effort direct or\r\nindirect to gain information from such a source. It was not our fault\r\nif by her own conversation and behaviour she gave us some idea of how\r\nmatters stood. Davies already knew more than I did.\r\n\r\nWe spent a few minutes on deck while she asked eager questions about\r\nour build and gear and seaworthiness, with a quaint mixture of\r\nprofessional acumen and personal curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow _did_ you manage alone that day?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked Davies, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was quite safe,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s much better to have a\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me; and\xe2\x80\x94well, I would have died for Davies there and\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather said you would be safe,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, with decision\xe2\x80\x94a slight\r\nexcess of decision, I thought. And at that turned to some rope or block\r\nand pursued her questioning. She found the compass impressive, and the\r\ntrappings of that hateful centreboard had a peculiar fascination for\r\nher. Was this the way we did it in England? was her constant query.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of a superficial freedom, we were all shy and\r\nconstrained. The descent below was a welcome diversion, for we should\r\nhave been less than human if we had not extracted some spontaneous fun\r\nfrom the humours of the saloon. I went down first to see about the tea,\r\nleaving them struggling for mutual comprehension over the theory of an\r\nEnglish lifeboat. They soon followed, and I can see her now stooping in\r\nat the doorway, treading delicately, like a kitten, past the\r\nobstructive centreboard to a place on the starboard sofa, then taking\r\nin her surroundings with a timid rapture that broke into delight at all\r\nthe primitive arrangements and dingy amenities of our den. She explored\r\nthe cavernous recesses of the Rippingille, fingered the duck-guns and\r\nthe miscellany in the racks, and peeped into the fo\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99sle with dainty\r\nawe. Everything was a source of merriment, from our cramped attitudes\r\nto the painful deficiency of spoons and the \xe2\x80\x9cyachtiness\xe2\x80\x9d (there is no\r\nother word to describe it) of the bread, which had been bought at\r\nBensersiel, and had suffered from incarceration and the climate. This\r\nfact came out, and led to some questions, while we waited for the water\r\nto boil, about the gale and our visit there. The topic, a pregnant one\r\nfor us, appeared to have no special significance to her. At the mention\r\nof von Br\xc3\xbcning she showed no emotion of any sort; on the contrary, she\r\nwent out of her way, from an innocent motive that anyone could have\r\nguessed, to show that she could talk about him with dispassionate\r\ndetachment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came to see us when you were here last, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to\r\nDavies. \xe2\x80\x9cHe often comes. He goes with father to Memmert sometimes. You\r\nknow about Memmert? They are diving for money out of an old wreck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we had heard about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you have. Father is a director of the company, and Commander\r\nvon Br\xc3\xbcning takes great interest in it; they took me down in a\r\ndiving-bell once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d and Davies sawed laboriously at the bread. She\r\nmust have misconstrued our sheepish silence, for she stopped and drew\r\nherself up with just a touch of momentary _hauteur_, utterly lost on\r\nDavies. I could have laughed aloud at this transient little comedy of\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see any gold?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies at last, with husky solemnity.\r\nSomething had to be said or we should defeat our own end; but I let him\r\nsay it. He had not my faith in Memmert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, only mud and timber\xe2\x80\x94oh, I forgot\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t betray the company\xe2\x80\x99s secrets,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, laughing;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommander von Br\xc3\xbcning wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us a word about the gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s self-denial!\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it matters much,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, laughing too. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare only visitors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, demurely. \xe2\x80\x9cJust passing travellers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will stop at Norderney?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with na\xc3\xafve anxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cHerr\r\nDavies said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked to Davies; it was his affair. Fair and square came his answer,\r\nin blunt dog-German.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course, we shall. I should like to see your father again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp to this moment I had been doubtful of his final decision; for ever\r\nsince our explanation at Bensersiel I had had the feeling that I was\r\nholding his nose to a very cruel grindstone. This straight word, clear\r\nand direct, beyond anything I had hoped for, brought me to my senses\r\nand showed me that his mind had been working far in advance of mine;\r\nand more, shaping a double purpose that I had never dreamt of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Dollmann; \xe2\x80\x9cyes, I am sure he will be very\r\nglad to see you.\r\n\r\nThere was no conviction in her tone, and her eyes were distant and\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not at home now, is he?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know?\xe2\x80\x9d (a little maidenly confusion). \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Commander von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI might have added that it had been clear as daylight all along that\r\nthis visit was in the nature of an escapade of which her father might\r\nnot approve. I tried to say \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d without words, and may have\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told Mr Davies when we first met,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect him back\r\nvery soon\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow in fact; he wrote from Amsterdam. He left me at\r\nHamburg and has been away since. Of course, he will not know your yacht\r\nis back again. I think he expected Mr Davies would stay in the Baltic,\r\nas the season was so late. But\xe2\x80\x94but I am sure he will be glad to see\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the _Medusa_ in harbour?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but we are not living on her now. We are at our villa in the\r\nSchwannall\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x94my stepmother and I, that is.\xe2\x80\x9d She added some details, and\r\nDavies gravely pencilled down the address on a leaf of the log-book; a\r\nformality which somehow seemed to regularise the present position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be at Norderney to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the kettle was boiling merrily, and I made the tea\xe2\x80\x94cocoa, I\r\nshould say, for the menu was changed in deference to our visitor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntastes. \xe2\x80\x9cThis _is_ fun!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. And by common consent we abandoned\r\nourselves, three youthful, hungry mariners, to the enjoyment of this\r\nimpromptu picnic. Such a chance might never occur again\xe2\x80\x94_carpamus\r\ndiem._\r\n\r\nBut the banquet was never celebrated. As at Belshazzar\xe2\x80\x99s feast, there\r\nwas a writing on the wall; no supernatural inscription, but just a\r\nprinted name; an English surname with title and initials, in cheap gilt\r\nlettering on the back of an old book; a silent, sneering witness of our\r\nsnug party. The catastrophe came and passed so suddenly that at the\r\ntime I had scarcely even an inkling of what caused it; but I know now\r\nthat this is how it happened. Our visitor was sitting at the forward\r\nend of the starboard sofa, close to the bulkhead. Davies and I were\r\nopposite her. Across the bulkhead, on a level with our heads, ran the\r\nbookshelf, whose contents, remember, I had carefully straightened only\r\nhalf an hour ago, little dreaming of the consequence. Some trifle,\r\nprobably the logbook which Davies had reached down from the shelf,\r\ncalled her attention to the rest of our library. While busied with the\r\ncocoa I heard her spelling out some titles, fingering leaves, and\r\ntwitting Davies with the little care he took of his books. Suddenly\r\nthere was a silence which made me look up, to see a startled and\r\npitiful change in her. She was staring at Davies with wide eyes and\r\nparted lips, a burning flush mounting on her forehead, and such an\r\nexpression on her face as a sleep-walker might wear, who wakes in fear\r\nhe knows not where.\r\n\r\nHalf her mind was far away, labouring to construe some hideous dream of\r\nthe past; half was in the present, cringing before some sickening\r\nreality. She remained so for perhaps ten seconds, and then\xe2\x80\x94plucky girl\r\nthat she was\xe2\x80\x94she mastered herself, looked deliberately round and up\r\nwith a circular glance, strangely in the manner of Davies himself, and\r\nspoke. How late it was, she must be going\xe2\x80\x94her boat was not safe. At the\r\nsame time she rose to go, or rather slid herself along the sofa, for\r\nrising was impossible. We sat like mannerless louts, in blank\r\namazement. Davies at the outset had said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d in plain\r\nEnglish, and then relapsed into stupefaction. I recovered myself the\r\nfirst, and protested in some awkward fashion about the cocoa, the time,\r\nthe absence of fog. In trying to answer, her self-possession broke\r\ndown, poor child, and her retreat became a blind flight, like that of a\r\nwounded animal, while every sordid circumstance seemed to accentuate\r\nher panic.\r\n\r\nShe tilted the corner of the table in leaving the sofa and spilt cocoa\r\nover her skirt; she knocked her head with painful force against the\r\nsharp lintel of the doorway, and stumbled on the steps of the ladder. I\r\nwas close behind, but when I reached the deck she was already on the\r\ncounter hauling up the dinghy. She had even jumped in and laid hands on\r\nthe sculls before any check came in her precipitate movements. Now\r\nthere occurred to her the patent fact that the dinghy was ours, and\r\nthat someone must accompany her to bring it back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDavies will row you over,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will be so kind, Herr\r\nCarruthers. It is your turn. No, I mean, I want\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies to me in English.\r\n\r\nI stepped into the dinghy and motioned to take the sculls from her. She\r\nseemed not to see me, and pushed off while Davies handed down her\r\njacket, which she had left in the cabin. Neither of us tried to better\r\nthe situation by conventional apologies. It was left to her, at the\r\nlast moment, to make a show of excusing herself, an attempt so brave\r\nand yet so wretchedly lame that I tingled all over with hot shame. She\r\nonly made matters worse, and Davies interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Auf Wiedersehen_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, simply.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, did not even offer her hand, and pulled away;\r\nDavies turned sharp round and went below.\r\n\r\nThere was now no muddy Rubicon to obstruct us, for the tide had risen a\r\ngood deal, and the sands were covering. I offered again to take the\r\nsculls, but she took no notice and rowed on, so that I was a silent\r\npassenger on the stern seat till we reached her boat, a spruce little\r\nyacht\xe2\x80\x99s gig, built to the native model, with a spoon-bow and tiny\r\nlee-boards. It was already afloat, but riding quite safely to a rope\r\nand a little grapnel, which she proceeded to haul in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was quite safe after all, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I could not stay. Herr Carruthers, I want to say something to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d (I knew it was coming; von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s warning over again.) \xe2\x80\x9cI made\r\na mistake just now; it is no use your calling on us to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not see my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you said he was coming back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, by the morning steamer; but he will be very busy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can wait. We have several days to spare, and we have to call for\r\nletters anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not delay on our account. The weather is very fine at last.\r\nIt would be a pity to lose a chance of a smooth voyage to England. The\r\nseason\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no fixed plans. Davies wants to get some shooting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father will be much occupied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can see _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI insisted on being obtuse, for though this fencing with an unstrung\r\ngirl was hateful work, the quest was at stake. We were going to\r\nNorderney, come what might, and sooner or later we must see Dollmann.\r\nIt was no use promising not to. I had given no pledge to von Br\xc3\xbcning,\r\nand I would give none to her. The only alternative was to violate the\r\ncompact (which the present fiasco had surely weakened), speak out, and\r\ntry and make an ally of her. Against her own father? I shrank from the\r\nresponsibility and counted the cost of failure\xe2\x80\x94certain failure, to\r\njudge by her conduct. She began to hoist her lugsail in a dazed,\r\nshiftless fashion, while our two boats drifted slowly to leeward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather might not like it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, so low and from such tremulous\r\nlips that I scarcely caught her words. \xe2\x80\x9cHe does not like foreigners\r\nmuch. I am afraid . . . he did not want to see Herr Davies again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was wrong of me to come aboard\xe2\x80\x94I suddenly remembered; but I could\r\nnot tell Herr Davies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that he must not come near us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will understand. I know he will be very sorry, but,\xe2\x80\x9d I added,\r\nfirmly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can trust him implicitly to do the right thing.\xe2\x80\x9d And how I\r\nprayed that this would content her! Thank Heaven, it did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I did not say good-bye to him. You will\r\ndo so?\xe2\x80\x9d She gave me her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing more,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, holding it, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing had better be said\r\nabout this meeting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, nothing. It must never be known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI let go the gig\xe2\x80\x99s gunwale and watched her tighten her sheet and make a\r\ntack or two to windward. Then I rowed back to the _Dulcibella_ as hard\r\nas I could.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nThe Little Drab Book\r\n\r\n\r\nI found Davies at the cabin table, surrounded with a litter of books.\r\nThe shelf was empty, and its contents were tossed about among the cups\r\nand on the floor. We both spoke together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did she say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gave way, and told my story briefly. He listened in silence, drumming\r\non the table with a book which he held.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder; look here!\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nheld out to me a small volume, whose appearance was quite familiar to\r\nme, if its contents were less so. As I noted in an early chapter,\r\nDavies\xe2\x80\x99s library, excluding tide-tables, \xe2\x80\x9cpilots\xe2\x80\x9d, etc., was limited to\r\ntwo classes of books, those on naval warfare, and those on his own\r\nhobby, cruising in small yachts. He had six or seven of the latter,\r\nincluding Knight\xe2\x80\x99s _Falcon in the Baltic,_ Cowper\xe2\x80\x99s _Sailing Tours,_\r\nMacmullen\xe2\x80\x99s _Down Channel_, and other less known stories of adventurous\r\ntravel. I had scarcely done more than look into some of them at\r\noff-moments, for our life had left no leisure for reading. This\r\nparticular volume was\xe2\x80\x94no, I had better not describe it too fully; but I\r\nwill say that it was old and unpretentious, bound in cheap cloth of a\r\nrather antiquated style, with a title which showed it to be a guide for\r\nyachtsmen to a certain British estuary. A white label partly scratched\r\naway bore the legend \xe2\x80\x9c3_d_.\xe2\x80\x9d I had glanced at it once or twice with no\r\nspecial interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, turning over some yellow pages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDollmann!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cDollmann wrote it.\xe2\x80\x9d I turned to the\r\ntitle-page, and read: \xe2\x80\x9cBy Lieut. X\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, R.N.\xe2\x80\x9d The name itself conveyed\r\nnothing to me, but I began to understand. Davies went on: \xe2\x80\x9cThe name\xe2\x80\x99s\r\non the back, too\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m certain it\xe2\x80\x99s the last she looked at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s the man himself. Ass that I am not to have seen it before!\r\nLook at the frontispiece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a sorry piece of illustration of the old-fashioned sort, lacking\r\ndefinition and finish, but effective notwithstanding; for it was\r\nevidently the reproduction, though a cheap and imperfect process, of a\r\nphotograph. It represented a small yacht at anchor below some woods,\r\nwith the owner standing on deck in his shirt sleeves: a well-knit,\r\npowerful man, young, of middle height, clean-shaved. There appeared to\r\nbe nothing remarkable about the face; the portrait being on too small a\r\nscale, and the expression, such as it was, being of the fixed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cphotographic\xe2\x80\x9d character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know him? You said he was fifty, with a greyish beard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the shape of his head; that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed. Look how it widens at\r\nthe top, and then flattens\xe2\x80\x94sort of wedge shaped\xe2\x80\x94with a high, steep\r\nforehead; you\xe2\x80\x99d hardly notice it in that\xe2\x80\x9d (the points were not very\r\nnoticeable, but I saw what Davies meant). \xe2\x80\x9cThe height and figure are\r\nright, too; and the dates are about right. Look at the bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnderneath the picture was the name of a yacht and a date. The\r\npublisher\xe2\x80\x99s date on the title-page was the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixteen years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looks thirty odd in that, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe? And fifty now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s work the thing out. Sixteen years ago he was still an\r\nEnglishman, an officer in Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Navy. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s a German. At\r\nsome time between this and then, I suppose, he came to grief\xe2\x80\x94disgrace,\r\nflight, exile. When did it happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been here three years; von Br\xc3\xbcning said so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was long before that. She has talked German from a child. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nher age, do you think\xe2\x80\x94nineteen or twenty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay she was four when this book was published. The crash must have\r\ncome not long after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hiding in Germany since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this a well-known book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw another copy; picked this up on a second-hand bookstall\r\nfor threepence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe looked at it, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m certain of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she never on board you in September?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I asked them both, but Dollmann made excuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _he\xe2\x80\x94he_ came on board? You told me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce; he asked himself to breakfast on the first day. By Jove! yes;\r\nyou mean he saw the book?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt explains a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt explains everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe fell into deep reflexion for a minute or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really mean _everything_?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn that case let\xe2\x80\x99s sail\r\nstraight away and forget the whole affair. He\xe2\x80\x99s only some poor devil\r\nwith a past, whose secret you stumbled on, and, half mad with fear, he\r\ntried to silence you. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t want revenge, so it\xe2\x80\x99s no business\r\nof ours. We can ruin him if we like; but is it worth it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean a word you\xe2\x80\x99re saying,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I know why\r\nyou say it; and many thanks, old chap. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean \xe2\x80\x98everything\xe2\x80\x99. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplotting with Germans, or why did Grimm spy on us, and von Br\xc3\xbcning\r\ncross-examine us? We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to find out what he\xe2\x80\x99s at, as well as who he\r\nis. And as to her\xe2\x80\x94what do you think of her now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made my _amende_ heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cInnocent and ignorant,\xe2\x80\x9d was my verdict.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIgnorant, that is, of her father\xe2\x80\x99s treasonable machinations; but\r\naware, clearly, that they were English refugees with a past to hide.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid other things, but they do not matter. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly,\xe2\x80\x9d I concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nmakes the dilemma infinitely worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no dilemma at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said at Bensersiel that\r\nwe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt him without hurting her. Well, all I can say is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\n_got_ to. The time to cut and run, if ever, was when we sighted her\r\ndinghy. I had a baddish minute then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s given us a clue or two after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t our fault. To refuse to have her on board would have been to\r\ngive our show away; and the very fact that she\xe2\x80\x99s given us clues decides\r\nthe matter. She mustn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will she do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStick to her father, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what shall we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet; how can I know? It depends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, slowly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the point is, that we have two objects, equally important\xe2\x80\x94yes,\r\nequally, by Jove!\xe2\x80\x94to scotch him, and save her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s rather a large order,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you realise that at this\r\nvery moment we have probably gained the first object? If we went home\r\nnow, walked into the Admiralty and laid our facts before them, what\r\nwould be the result?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Admiralty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, with ineffable scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Scotland Yard, too, then. Both of them want our man, I dare say.\r\nIt would be strange if between them they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t dislodge him, and,\r\nincidentally, either discover what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here or draw such\r\nattention to this bit of coast as to make further secrecy impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s out of the question to let her betray her father, and then run\r\naway! Besides, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know enough, and they mightn\xe2\x80\x99t believe us. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na cowardly course, however you look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that settles it,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I want to go back over\r\nthe facts. When did you first see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat first morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the saloon the night before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would have gone away next morning if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t called?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I told you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe allowed her to persuade you to make that voyage with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he sent her below when the pilotage was going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said just now, \xe2\x80\x98Father said you would be safe.\xe2\x80\x99 What had you been\r\nsaying to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was when I met her on the sand. (By the way, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a chance\r\nmeeting; she had been making inquiries and heard about us from a\r\nskipper who had seen the yacht near Wangeroog, and she had been down\r\nthis way before.) She asked at once about that day, and began\r\napologising, rather awkwardly, you know, for their rudeness in not\r\nhaving waited for me at Cuxhaven. Her father found he must get on to\r\nHamburg at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Cuxhaven; you told her that? What exactly _did_\r\nyou tell her? This is important.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in a fearful fix, not knowing what _he_ had told her. So I said\r\nsomething vague, and then she asked the very question von Br\xc3\xbcning did,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there a _schrecklich_ sea round the Scharhorn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you took the short cut, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t dared to tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe knew that _they_ took it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly have hidden that. She would have known by\r\nthe look of the sea from the portholes, the shorter time, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when the _Medusa_ hove to and he shouted to you to follow\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t she understand what was happening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, evidently not. Mind you, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly have heard what we\r\nsaid, in that weather, from below. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cross-question her, but\r\nit was clear enough what she thought; namely, that he had hove to for\r\nexactly the opposite reason, to say _he_ was taking the short cut, and\r\nthat I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to attempt to follow him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why she laid stress on _waiting_ for you at Cuxhaven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course; mine would have been the longer passage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had no notion of foul play?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone\xe2\x80\x94that I could see. After all, there I was, alive and well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she was remorseful for having induced you to sail at all that day,\r\nand for not having waited to see you arrived safely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow what did you say about Cuxhaven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I let her understand that I went there, and, not finding\r\nthem, went on to the Baltic by the Eider river, having changed my mind\r\nabout the ship canal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, what about her voyage back from Hamburg? Was she alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the stepmother joined her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she say she had inquired about you at Brunsb\xc3\xbcttel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I suppose she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to. And there was no need, because my\r\ntaking the Eider explained it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sure she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a notion that you took the short\r\ncut?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure; but she may guess it now. She guessed foul play by seeing\r\nthat book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course she did; but I was thinking of something else. There are two\r\nstories afloat now\xe2\x80\x94yours to von Br\xc3\xbcning, the true one, that you\r\nfollowed the _Medusa_ to the short cut; and Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s to her, that you\r\nwent round the Scharhorn. That\xe2\x80\x99s evidently his version of the\r\naffair\xe2\x80\x94the version he would have given if you had been drowned and\r\ninquiries were ever made; the version he would have sworn his crew to\r\nif they discovered the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he must drop that yarn when he knows I\xe2\x80\x99m alive and back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but meanwhile, supposing von Br\xc3\xbcning sees him _before_ he knows\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re back again, and wants to find out the truth about that incident.\r\nIf I were von Br\xc3\xbcning I should say, \xe2\x80\x98By the way, what\xe2\x80\x99s become of that\r\nyoung Englishman you decoyed away to the Baltic?\xe2\x80\x99 Dollmann would give\r\nhis version, and von Br\xc3\xbcning, having heard ours, would know he was\r\nlying, and had tried to drown you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it matter? He must know already that Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s a scoundrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve been supposing; but we may be wrong. We\xe2\x80\x99re still in the dark\r\nas to Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s position towards these Germans. They may not even know\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s English, or they may know that and not know his real name and\r\npast. What effect your story will have on their relations with him we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t forecast. But I\xe2\x80\x99m clear about one thing, that it\xe2\x80\x99s our paramount\r\ninterest to maintain the _status quo_ as long as we can, to minimise\r\nthe danger you ran that day, and act as witnesses in his defence. We\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do that if his story and yours don\xe2\x80\x99t tally. The discrepancy will\r\nnot only damn him (that may be immaterial), but it will throw doubt on\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause if the short cut was so dangerous that he dared not own to\r\nhaving led you to it, it was dangerous enough to make you suspect foul\r\nplay; the very supposition we want to avoid. We want to be thought mere\r\ntravellers, with no scores to wipe out, and no secrets to pry after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you propose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHitherto I believe we stand fairly well. Let\xe2\x80\x99s assume we hoodwinked\r\nvon Br\xc3\xbcning at Bensersiel, and base our policy on that assumption. It\r\nfollows that we must show Dollmann at the earliest possible moment that\r\nyou _have_ come back, and give him time to revise his tactics before he\r\ncommits himself. Now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _she\xe2\x80\x99ll_ tell him we\xe2\x80\x99re back,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. We\xe2\x80\x99ve just agreed to keep this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s episode a\r\nsecret. She expects never to see us again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, he comes to-morrow by the morning boat, she said. What did that\r\nmean? Boat from where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. From Norddeich on the mainland opposite. There\xe2\x80\x99s a railway\r\nthere from Norden, and a steam ferry crosses to the island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Bradshaw will tell us\xe2\x80\x94here it is: \xe2\x80\x98Winter Service, 8.30 a.m., due\r\nat 9.5.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get away at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had a tussle with the tide at first, but once over the watershed the\r\nchannel improved, and the haze lightened gradually. A lighthouse\r\nappeared among the sand-dunes on the island shore, and before darkness\r\nfell we dimly saw the spires and roofs of a town, and two long black\r\npiers stretching out southwards. We were scarcely a mile away when we\r\nlost our wind altogether, and had to anchor. Determined to reach our\r\ndestination that night we waited till the ebb stream made, and then\r\ntowed the yacht with the dinghy. In the course of this a fog dropped on\r\nus suddenly, just as it had yesterday. I was towing at the time, and,\r\nof course, stopped short; but Davies shouted to me from the tiller to\r\ngo on, that he could manage with the lead and compass. And the end of\r\nit was that, at about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, we anchored safely in the\r\nfive-fathom roadstead, close to the eastern pier, as a short\r\nreconnaissance proved to us. It had been a little masterpiece of adroit\r\nseamanship.\r\n\r\nThere was utter stillness till our chain rattled down, when a muffled\r\nshout came from the direction of the pier, and soon we heard a boat\r\ngroping out to us. It was a polite but sleepy port-officer, who asked\r\nin a perfunctory way for our particulars, and when he heard them,\r\nremembered the _Dulcibella_\xe2\x80\x99s previous visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you bound to?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEngland\xe2\x80\x94sooner or later,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\nThe man laughed derisively. \xe2\x80\x9cNot this year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be\r\nfogs for another week; it is always so, and then storms. Better leave\r\nyour yawl here. Dues will be only sixpence a month for you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll think about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man vanished like a ghost in the thick night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the post-office open?\xe2\x80\x9d I called after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; eight to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d came back out of the fog.\r\n\r\nWe were too excited to sup in comfort, or sleep in peace, or to do\r\nanything but plan and speculate. Never till this night had we talked\r\nwith absolute mutual confidence, for Davies broke down the last\r\nbarriers of reserve and let me see his whole mind. He loved this girl\r\nand he loved his country, two simple passions which for the time\r\nabsorbed his whole moral capacity. There was no room left for\r\ncasuistry. To weigh one passion against the other, with the discordant\r\nvoices of honour and expediency dinning in his ears, had too long\r\ninvolved him in fruitless torture. Both were right; neither could be\r\nsurrendered. If the facts showed them irreconcilable, _tant pis pour\r\nles faits._ A way must be found to satisfy both or neither.\r\n\r\nI should have been a spiritless dog if I had not risen to his mood. But\r\nin truth his cutting of the knot was at this juncture exactly what\r\nappealed to me. I, too, was tired of vicarious casuistry, and the\r\nfascination of our enterprise, intensified by the discovery of that\r\nafternoon, had never been so strong in me. Not to be insincere, I\r\ncannot pretend that I viewed the situation with his single mind. My\r\nphilosophy when I left London was of a very worldly sort, and no one\r\ncan change his temperament in three weeks. I plainly said as much to\r\nDavies, and indeed took perverse satisfaction in stating with brutal\r\nemphasis some social truths which bore on this attachment of his to the\r\ndaughter of an outlaw. Truths I call them, but I uttered them more by\r\nrote than by conviction, and he heard them unmoved. And meanwhile I\r\nsnatched recklessly at his own solution. If it imparted into our\r\nadventure a strain of crazy chivalry more suited to knights-errant of\r\nthe Middle Ages than to sober modern youths\xe2\x80\x94well, thank Heaven, I was\r\nnot too sober, and still young enough to snatch at that fancy with an\r\nardour of imagination, if not of character; perhaps, too, of character,\r\nfor Galahads are not so common but that ordinary folk must needs draw\r\ncourage from their example and put something of a blind trust in their\r\ntenfold strength.\r\n\r\nTo reduce a romantic ideal to a working plan is a very difficult thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have to argue backwards,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be the final\r\nstage? Because that must govern the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was only one answer\xe2\x80\x94to get Dollmann, secrets and all, daughter\r\nand all, away from Germany altogether. So only could we satisfy the\r\ndouble aim we had set before us. What a joy it is, when beset with\r\ndoubts, to find a bed-rock necessity, however unattainable! We fastened\r\non this one and reasoned back from it. The first lesson was that,\r\nhowever many and strong were the enemies we had to contend with, our\r\nsole overt foe must be Dollmann. The issue of the struggle must be\r\nknown only to ourselves and him. If we won, and found out \xe2\x80\x9cwhat he was\r\nat\xe2\x80\x9d, we must at all costs conceal our success from his German friends,\r\nand detach him from them before he was compromised. (You will remark\r\nthat to blithely accept this limitation showed a very sanguine spirit\r\nin us.) The next question, how to find out what he was at, was a deal\r\nmore thorny. If it had not been for the discovery of Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nidentity, we should have found it as hard a nut to crack as ever. But\r\nthis discovery was illuminating. It threw into relief two methods of\r\naction which hitherto we had been hazily seeking to combine, seesawing\r\nbetween one and the other, each of us influenced at different times by\r\ndifferent motives. One was to rely on independent research; the other\r\nto extort the secret from Dollmann direct, by craft or threats. The\r\nmoral of to-day was to abandon the first and embrace the second.\r\n\r\nThe prospects of independent research were not a whit better than\r\nbefore. There were only two theories in the field, the channel theory\r\nand the Memmert theory. The former languished for lack of\r\ncorroboration; the latter also appeared to be weakened. To Fr\xc3\xa4ulein\r\nDollmann the wreck-works were evidently what they purported to be, and\r\nnothing more. This fact in itself was unimportant, for it was clear as\r\ncrystal that she was no party to her father\xe2\x80\x99s treacherous intrigues, if\r\nhe was engaged in such. But if Memmert was his sphere for them, it was\r\ndisconcerting to find her so familiar with that sphere, lightly talking\r\nof a descent in a diving-bell\xe2\x80\x94hinting, too, that the mystery as to\r\nresults was only for local consumption. Nevertheless, the charm of\r\nMemmert as the place we had traced Grimm to, and as the only tangible\r\nclue we had obtained, was still very great. The really cogent objection\r\nwas the insuperable difficulty, known and watched as we were, of\r\nlearning its significance. If there was anything important to see there\r\nwe should never be allowed to see it, while by trying and failing we\r\nrisked everything. It was on this point that the last of all\r\nmisunderstandings between me and Davies was dissipated. At Bensersiel\r\nhe had been influenced more than he owned by my arguments about\r\nMemmert; but at that time (as I hinted) he was biased by a radical\r\nprejudice. The channel theory had become a sort of religion with him,\r\npromising double salvation\xe2\x80\x94not only avoidance of the Dollmanns, but\r\nsuccess in the quest by methods in which he was past master. To have to\r\ndesert it and resort to spying on naval defences was an idea he dreaded\r\nand distrusted. It was not the morality of the course that bothered\r\nhim. He was far too clear-headed to blink at the essential fact that at\r\nheart we were spies on a foreign power in time of peace, or to salve\r\nhis conscience by specious distinctions as to our mode of operation.\r\nThe foreign power to him was Dollmann, a traitor. There was his final\r\njustification, fearlessly adopted and held to the last. It was rather\r\nthat, knowing his own limitations, his whole nature shrank from the\r\nsort of action entailed by the Memmert theory. And there was strong\r\ncommon sense in his antipathy.\r\n\r\nSo much for independent research.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the road was now clear for the other method. Davies\r\nno longer feared to face the imbroglio at Norderney; and that day\r\nfortune had given us a new and potent weapon against Dollmann;\r\nprecisely how potent we could not tell, for we had only a glimpse of\r\nhis past, and his exact relations with the Government were unknown to\r\nus. But we knew who he was. Using this knowledge with address, could we\r\nnot wring the rest from him? Feel our way, of course, be guided by his\r\nown conduct, but in the end strike hard and stake everything on the\r\nstroke? Such at any rate was our scheme to-night. Later, tossing in my\r\nbunk, I bethought me of the little drab book, lit a candle, and fetched\r\nit. A preface explained that it had been written during a spell of two\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x99 leave from naval duty, and expressed a hope that it might be of\r\nservice to Corinthian sailors. The style was unadorned, but scholarly\r\nand pithy. There was no trace of the writer\xe2\x80\x99s individuality, save a\r\ncertain subdued relish in describing banks and shoals, which reminded\r\nme of Davies himself. For the rest, I found the book dull, and, in\r\nfact, it sent me to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nBlindfold to Memmert\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere she comes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. It was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the next day,\r\nOctober 22, and we were on deck waiting for the arrival of the steamer\r\nfrom Norddeich. There was no change in the weather\xe2\x80\x94still the same\r\nstringent cold, with a high barometer, and only fickle flaws of air;\r\nbut the morning was gloriously clear, except for a wreath or two of\r\nmist curling like smoke from the sea, and an attenuated belt of opaque\r\nfog on the northern horizon. The harbour lay open before us, and very\r\ncommodious and civilised it looked, enclosed between two long piers\r\nwhich ran quite half a mile out from the land to the roadstead (Riff\r\nGat by name) where we lay. A stranger might have taken it for a deep\r\nand spacious haven; but this, of course, was an illusion, due to the\r\nhigh water. Davies knew that three-quarters of it was mud, the\r\nremainder being a dredged-out channel along the western pier. A couple\r\nof tugs, a dredger, and a ferry packet with steam up, were moored on\r\nthat side\xe2\x80\x94a small stack of galliots on the other. Beyond these was\r\nanother vessel, a galliot in build, but radiant as a queen among sluts;\r\nher varnished sides and spars flashing orange in the sun. These, and\r\nher snow-white sailcovers and the twinkle of brass and gun-metal,\r\nproclaimed her to be a yacht. I had already studied her through the\r\nglasses and read on her stern _Medusa_. A couple of sailors were\r\nswabbing her decks; you could hear the slush of the water and the\r\nscratching of the deck-brooms. \xe2\x80\x9c_They_ can see us anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d Davies had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nFor that matter all the world could see us\xe2\x80\x94certainly the incoming\r\nsteamer must; for we lay as near to the pier as safety permitted,\r\nabreast of the berth she would occupy, as we knew by a gangway and a\r\nknot of sailors.\r\n\r\nA packet boat, not bigger than a big tug, was approaching from the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, we\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to know he\xe2\x80\x99s coming,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s go\r\nbelow.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides the skylight, our \xe2\x80\x9ccoach-house\xe2\x80\x9d cabin top had little\r\noblong side windows. We wiped clean those on the port side and watched\r\nevents from them, kneeling on the sofa.\r\n\r\nThe steamer backed her paddles, flinging out a wash that set us rolling\r\nto our scuppers. There seemed to be very few passengers aboard, but all\r\nof them were gazing at the _Dulcibella_ while the packet was warped\r\nalongside. On the forward deck there were some market-women with\r\nbaskets, a postman, and a weedy youth who might be an hotel-waiter; on\r\nthe after-deck, standing close together, were two men in ulsters and\r\nsoft felt hats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, in a tense whisper; \xe2\x80\x9cthe tall one.\xe2\x80\x9d But the\r\ntall one turned abruptly as Davies spoke and strode away behind the\r\ndeck-house, leaving me just a lightning impression of a grey beard and\r\na steep tanned forehead, behind a cloud of cigar-smoke. It was perverse\r\nof me, but, to tell the truth, I hardly missed him, so occupied was I\r\nby the short one, who remained leaning on the rail, thoughtfully\r\ncontemplating the _Dulcibella_ through gold-rimmed pince-nez: a sallow,\r\nwizened old fellow, beetlebrowed, with a bush of grizzled moustache and\r\na jet-black tuft of beard on his chin. The most remarkable feature was\r\nthe nose, which was broad and flat, merging almost imperceptibly in the\r\nwrinkled cheeks. Lightly beaked at the nether extremity, it drooped\r\ntowards an enormous cigar which was pointing at us like a gun just\r\ndischarged. He looked wise as Satan, and you would say he was smiling\r\ninwardly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered to Davies. (There was no need to talk in\r\nwhispers, but we did so instinctively.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo! she\xe2\x80\x99s backing off, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve not\r\nlanded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome parcels and mail-bags had been thrown up, and the weedy waiter and\r\ntwo market-women had gone up the gangway, which was now being hauled\r\nup, and were standing on the quay. I think one or two other persons had\r\nfirst come aboard unnoticed by us, but at the last moment a man we had\r\nnot seen before jumped down to the forward deck. \xe2\x80\x9cGrimm!\xe2\x80\x9d we both\r\nejaculated at once.\r\n\r\nThe steamer whistled sharply, circled backwards into the roadstead, and\r\nthen steamed away. The pier soon hid her, but her smoke showed she was\r\nsteering towards the North Sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be some other quay to stop at nearer the town,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDavies. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go ashore and get your letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had made a long and painful toilette that morning, and felt quite\r\nshy of one another as we sculled towards the pier, in much-creased blue\r\nsuits, conventional collars, and brown boots. It was the first time for\r\ntwo years that I had seen Davies in anything approaching a respectable\r\ngarb; but a fashionable watering-place, even in the dead season, exacts\r\nrespect; and, besides, we had friends to visit.\r\n\r\nWe tied up the dinghy to an iron ladder, and on the pier found our\r\ninquisitor of the night before smoking in the doorway of a shed marked\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarbour Master\xe2\x80\x9d. After some civilities we inquired about the steamer.\r\nThe answer was that it was Saturday, and she had, therefore, gone on to\r\nJuist. Did we want a good hotel? The \xe2\x80\x9cVier Jahreszeiten\xe2\x80\x9d was still\r\nopen, etc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuist, by Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, as we walked on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are those three\r\ngoing to Juist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought it was pretty clear. They\xe2\x80\x99re on their way to\r\nMemmert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavies agreed, and we both looked longingly westward at a\r\nstraw-coloured streak on the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it some meeting, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooks like it. We shall probably find the _Kormoran_ here,\r\nwind-bound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd find her we did soon after, the outermost of the stack of galliots,\r\non the farther side of the harbour. Two men, whose faces we took a good\r\nlook at, were sitting on her hatch, mending a sail.\r\n\r\nFlooded with sun, yet still as the grave, the town was like a dead\r\nbutterfly for whom the healing rays had come too late. We crossed some\r\ndeserted public gardens commanded by a gorgeous casino, its porticos\r\nheaped with chairs and tables; so past kiosques and _caf\xc3\xa9s,_ great\r\nwhite hotels with boarded windows, bazaars and booths, and all the\r\nstale lees of vulgar frivolity, to the post-office, which at least was\r\nalive. I received a packet of letters and purchased a local time-table,\r\nfrom which we learned that the steamer sailed daily to Borkum _via_\r\nNorderney, touching three times a week at Juist (weather permitting).\r\nOn the return journey to-day it was due at Norderney at 7.30 p.m. Then\r\nI inquired the way to the \xe2\x80\x9cVier Jahreszeiten\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cFor whatever your\r\nprinciples, Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are going to have the best breakfast\r\nmoney can buy! We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the whole day before us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cFour Seasons\xe2\x80\x9d Hotel was on the esplanade facing the northern\r\nbeach. Living up to its name, it announced on an illuminated signboard,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInclusive terms for winter visitors; special attention to invalids,\r\netc.\xe2\x80\x9d Here in a great glass restaurant, with the unruffled blue of\r\nocean spread out before us, we ate the king of breakfasts, dismissed\r\nthe waiter, and over long and fragrant Havanas examined my mail at\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a waste of good diplomacy!\xe2\x80\x9d was my first thought, for nothing had\r\nbeen tampered with, so far as we could judge from the minutest\r\nscrutiny, directed, of course, in particular to the franked official\r\nletters (for to my surprise there were two) from Whitehall.\r\n\r\nThe first in order of date (October 6) ran: \xe2\x80\x9cDear Carruthers.\xe2\x80\x94Take\r\nanother week by all means.\xe2\x80\x94Yours, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe second (marked \xe2\x80\x9curgent\xe2\x80\x9d) had been sent to my home address and\r\nforwarded. It was dated October 15, and cancelled the previous letter,\r\nrequesting me to return to London without delay\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to abridge\r\nyour holiday, but we are very busy, and, at present,\r\nshort-handed.\xe2\x80\x94Yours, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a dry postscript to the effect\r\nthat another time I was to be good enough to leave more regular and\r\ndefinite information as to my whereabouts when absent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I never got this!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, handing it to Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t go, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking, nevertheless, with\r\nunconcealed awe at the great man\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting under the haughty\r\nofficial crest. Meanwhile I discovered an endorsement on a corner of\r\nthe envelope: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry; it\xe2\x80\x99s only the chief\xe2\x80\x99s fuss.\xe2\x80\x94M\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I promptly\r\ntore up the envelope. There are domestic mysteries which it would be\r\nindecent and disloyal to reveal, even to one\xe2\x80\x99s best friend. The rest of\r\nmy letters need no remark; I smiled over some and blushed over\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x94all were voices from a life which was infinitely far away.\r\nDavies, meanwhile, was deep in the foreign intelligence of a newspaper,\r\nspelling it out line by line, and referring impatiently to me for the\r\nmeaning of words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly; \xe2\x80\x9csame old game! Hear that siren?\xe2\x80\x9d A curtain\r\nof fog had grown on the northern horizon and was drawing shorewards\r\nslowly but surely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we must get back to the yacht. We can\xe2\x80\x99t leave her alone in the\r\nfog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was some marketing to be done on the way back, and in the course\r\nof looking for the shops we wanted we came on the Schwannall\xc3\xa9e and\r\nnoted its position. Before we reached the harbour the fog was on us,\r\ncharging up the streets in dense masses. Happily a tramline led right\r\nup to the pier-head, or we should have lost our way and wasted time,\r\nwhich, in the event, was of priceless value. Presently we stumbled up\r\nagainst the Harbour Office, which was our landmark for the steps where\r\nwe had tied up the dinghy. The same official appeared and\r\ngood-naturedly held the painter while we handed in our parcels. He\r\nwanted to know why we had left the flesh-pots of the \xe2\x80\x9cVier\r\nJahreszeiten\xe2\x80\x9d. To look after our yacht, of course. There was no need,\r\nhe objected; there would be no traffic moving while the fog lasted, and\r\nthe fog, having come on at that hour, had come to stay. If it did clear\r\nhe would keep an eye on the yacht for us. We thanked him, but thought\r\nwe would go aboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have a job to find her now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe distance was eighty yards at the most, but we had to use a\r\nscientific method, the same one, in fact, that Davies had used last\r\nnight in the approach to the eastern pier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRow straight out at right angles to the pier,\xe2\x80\x9d he said now. I did so,\r\nDavies sounding with his scull between the strokes. He found the bottom\r\nafter twenty yards, that being the width of the dredged-out channel at\r\nthis point. Then we turned to the right, and moved gently forward,\r\nkeeping touch with the edge of the mud-bank (for all the world like\r\nblind men tapping along a kerbstone) and taking short excursions from\r\nit, till the _Dulcibella_ hove in view. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s partly luck,\xe2\x80\x9d Davies\r\ncommented; \xe2\x80\x9cwe ought to have had the compass as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe exchanged shouts with the man on the pier to show we had arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: Chart B of Juist, Memmert, and Part of Norderney\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very good practice, that sort of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, when we had\r\ndisembarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a sixth sense,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow far could you go like\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have another try. I can\xe2\x80\x99t sit still all day. Let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexplore this channel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Why not go to Memmert?\xe2\x80\x9d_ I said, in fun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Memmert?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, slowly; \xe2\x80\x9cby Jove! that\xe2\x80\x99s an idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens, man! I was joking. Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s ten mortal miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, absently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not so much the distance\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe time? Ten fifteen; quarter ebb\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 What am I talking about? We made\r\nour plans last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut seeing him, to my amazement, serious, I was stung by the splendour\r\nof the idea I had awakened. Confidence in his skill was second nature\r\nto me. I swept straight on to the logic of the thing, the greatness,\r\nthe completeness of the opportunity, if by a miracle it could be seized\r\nand used. Something was going on at Memmert to-day; our men had gone\r\nthere; here were we, ten miles away, in a smothering, blinding fog. It\r\nwas known we were here\xe2\x80\x94Dollmann and Grimm knew it; the crew of the\r\n_Medusa_ knew it; the crew of the _Kormoran_ knew it; the man on the\r\npier, whether he cared or not, knew it. But none of them knew Davies as\r\nI knew him. Would anyone dream for an instant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a second,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cgive me two minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d He whipped out the\r\nGerman chart. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere exactly should we go?\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cExactly!\xe2\x80\x9d The word\r\ntickled me hugely.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the dep\xc3\xb4t, of course; it\xe2\x80\x99s our only chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen then\xe2\x80\x94there are two routes: the outside one by the open sea,\r\nright round Juist, and doubling south\xe2\x80\x94the simplest, but the longest;\r\nthe dep\xc3\xb4t\xe2\x80\x99s at the south point of Memmert, and Memmert\xe2\x80\x99s nearly two\r\nmiles long.\xe2\x80\x9d _[See Chart B]_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far would that way be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixteen miles good. And we should have to row in a breaking swell most\r\nof the way, close to land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of the question; it\xe2\x80\x99s too public, too, if it clears. The steamer\r\nwent that way, and will come back that way. We must go inside over the\r\nsands. Am I dreaming, though? Can you possibly find the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you see the hitch. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\n_time_ and the falling tide. High water was about 8.15: it\xe2\x80\x99s now 10.15,\r\nand all those sands are drying off. We must cross the See Gat and\r\nstrike that boomed channel, the Memmert Balje; strike it, freeze on to\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t cut off an inch\xe2\x80\x94and pass that \xe2\x80\x98watershed\xe2\x80\x99 you see there before\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s too late. It\xe2\x80\x99s an infernally bad one, I can see. Not even a dinghy\r\nwill cross it for an hour each side of low water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how far is the \xe2\x80\x98watershed\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord! What are we talking for? Change, man, change! Talk while\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re changing.\xe2\x80\x9d (He began flinging off his shore clothes, and I did\r\nthe same.) \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s at least five miles to the end of it; six, allowing\r\nfor bends; hour and a half hard pulling; two, allowing for checks. Are\r\nyou fit? You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pull the most. Then there are six or seven more\r\nmiles\xe2\x80\x94easier ones. And then\xe2\x80\x94What are we to do when we get there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave that to me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou get me there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing it clears?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter we get there? Bad; but we must risk that. If it clears on the\r\nway there it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter by this route; we shall be miles from\r\nland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about getting back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have a rising tide, anyway. If the fog lasts\xe2\x80\x94can you manage\r\nin a fog _and_ dark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dark makes it no more difficult, if we\xe2\x80\x99ve a light to see the\r\ncompass and chart by. You trim the binnacle lamp\xe2\x80\x94no, the riding-light.\r\nNow give me the scissors, and don\xe2\x80\x99t speak a word for ten minutes.\r\nMeanwhile, think it out, and load the dinghy\xe2\x80\x94(by Jove! though, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake a sound)\xe2\x80\x94some grub and whisky, the boat-compass, lead,\r\nriding-light, matches, _small_ boathook, grapnel and line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoghorn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the whistle too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re after ducks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. And muffle the rowlocks with cotton-waste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI left Davies absorbed in the charts, and softly went about my own\r\nfunctions. In ten minutes he was on the ladder, beckoning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cNow _shall_ we go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought it out. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\nThis was only roughly true, for I could not have stated in words all\r\nthe pros and cons that I had balanced. It was an impulse that drove me\r\nforward; but an impulse founded on reason, with just a tinge, perhaps,\r\nof superstition; for the quest had begun in a fog and might fitly end\r\nin one.\r\n\r\nIt was twenty-five minutes to eleven when we noiselessly pushed off.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her drift,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ebb\xe2\x80\x99ll carry her past the\r\npier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe slid by the _Dulcibella_, and she disappeared. Then we sat without\r\nspeech or movement for about five minutes, while the gurgle of tide\r\nthrough piles approached and passed. The dinghy appeared to be\r\nmotionless, just as a balloon in the clouds may appear to its occupants\r\nto be motionless, though urged by a current of air. In reality we were\r\ndriving out of the Riff Gat into the See Gat. The dinghy swayed to a\r\nlight swell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, pull,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, under his breath; \xe2\x80\x9ckeep it long and steady,\r\nabove all steady\xe2\x80\x94both arms with equal force.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was on the bow-thwart; he _vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_ to me on the stern seat, his\r\nleft hand behind him on the tiller, his right forefinger on a small\r\nsquare of paper which lay on his knees; this was a section cut out from\r\nthe big German chart. _[See Chart B]_ On the midship-thwart between us\r\nlay the compass and a watch. Between these three objects\xe2\x80\x94compass,\r\nwatch, and chart\xe2\x80\x94his eyes darted constantly, never looking up or out,\r\nsave occasionally for a sharp glance over the side at the flying\r\nbubbles, to see if I was sustaining a regular speed. My duty was to be\r\nhis automaton, the human equivalent of a marine engine whose\r\nrevolutions can be counted and used as data by the navigator. My arms\r\nmust be regular as twin pistons; the energy that drove them as\r\ncontrollable as steam. It was a hard ideal to reach, for the complex\r\nmortal tends to rely on all the senses God has given him, so unfitting\r\nhimself for mechanical exactitude when a sense (eyesight, in my case)\r\nfails him. At first it was constantly \xe2\x80\x9cleft\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d from Davies,\r\naccompanied by a bubbling from the rudder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis won\xe2\x80\x99t do, too much helm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, without looking up. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep\r\nyour stroke, but listen to me. Can you see the compass card?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I come forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake your time, and don\xe2\x80\x99t get flurried, but each time you come forward\r\nhave a good look at it. The course is sou\xe2\x80\x99-west half-west. You take the\r\nopposite, north-east half-east, and keep her _stern_ on that. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nrough, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll save some helm, and give me a hand free if I want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as he said, not without effort, and our progress gradually became\r\nsmoother, till he had no need to speak at all. The only sound now was\r\none like the gentle simmer of a saucepan away to port\xe2\x80\x94the lisp of surf\r\nI knew it to be\xe2\x80\x94and the muffled grunt of the rowlocks. I broke the\r\nsilence once to say \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very shallow.\xe2\x80\x9d I had touched sand with my\r\nright scull.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour passed, and then he added sounding to his other\r\noccupations. \xe2\x80\x9cPlump\xe2\x80\x9d went the lead at regular intervals, and he steered\r\nwith his hip while pulling in the line. Very little of it went out at\r\nfirst, then less still. Again I struck bottom, and, glancing aside, saw\r\nweeds. Suddenly he got a deep cast, and the dinghy, freed from the\r\nslight drag which shallow water always inflicts on a small boat, leapt\r\nbuoyantly forward. At the same time, I knew by boils on the smooth\r\nsurface that we were in a strong tideway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Buse Tief,\xe2\x80\x9d _[See Chart B]_ muttered Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cRow hard now, and\r\nsteady as a clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a hundred yards or more I bent to my sculls and made her fly.\r\nDavies was getting six fathom casts, till, just as suddenly as it had\r\ndeepened, the water shoaled\xe2\x80\x94ten feet, six, three, one\xe2\x80\x94the dinghy\r\ngrounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cBack her off! Pull your right only.\xe2\x80\x9d The dinghy\r\nspun round with her bow to N.N.W. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth arms together! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry\r\nabout the compass now; just pull, and listen for orders. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ntricky bit coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put aside the chart, kicked the lead under the seat, and, kneeling\r\non the dripping coils of line, sounded continuously with the butt-end\r\nof the boathook, a stumpy little implement, notched at intervals of a\r\nfoot, and often before used for the same purpose. All at once I was\r\naware that a check had come, for the dinghy swerved and doubled like a\r\nhound ranging after scent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cand throw out the grapnel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obeyed and we brought up, swinging to a slight current, whose\r\ndirection Davies verified by the compass. Then for half a minute he\r\ngave himself up to concentrated thought. What struck me most about him\r\nwas that he never for a moment strained his eyes through the fog; a\r\nuseless exercise (for five yards or so was the radius of our vision)\r\nwhich, however, I could not help indulging in, while I rested. He made\r\nup his mind, and we were off again, straight and swift as an arrow this\r\ntime, and in water deeper than the boathook. I could see by his face\r\nthat he was taking some bold expedient whose issue hung in the\r\nbalance.... Again we touched mud, and the artist\xe2\x80\x99s joy of achievement\r\nshone in his eyes. Backing away, we headed west, and for the first time\r\nhe began to gaze into the fog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one!\xe2\x80\x9d he snapped at last. \xe2\x80\x9cEasy all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA boom, one of the usual upright saplings, glided out of the mist. He\r\ncaught hold of it, and we brought up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest for three minutes now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in fairly good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was 11.10. I ate some biscuits and took a nip of whisky while Davies\r\nprepared for the next stage.\r\n\r\nWe had reached the eastern outlet of Memmert Balje, the channel which\r\nruns east and west behind Juist Island, direct to the south point of\r\nMemmert. How we had reached it was incomprehensible to me at the time,\r\nbut the reader will understand by comparing my narrative with the\r\ndotted line on the chart. I add this brief explanation, that Davies\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmethod had been to cross the channel called the Buse Tief, and strike\r\nthe other side of it at a point well _south_ of the outlet of the\r\nMemmert Balje (in view of the northward set of the ebb-tide), and then\r\nto drop back north and feel his way to the outlet. The check was caused\r\nby a deep indentation in the Itzendorf Flat; a _cul-de-sac,_ with a\r\nwide mouth, which Davies was very near mistaking for the Balje itself.\r\nWe had no time to skirt dents so deep as that; hence the dash across\r\nits mouth with the chance of missing the upper lip altogether, and of\r\neither being carried out to sea (for the slightest error was\r\ncumulative) or straying fruitlessly along the edge.\r\n\r\nThe next three miles were the most critical of all. They included the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwatershed\xe2\x80\x9d, whose length and depth were doubtful; they included, too,\r\nthe crux of the whole passage, a spot where the channel forks, our own\r\nbranch continuing west, and another branch diverging from it\r\nnorth-westward. We must row against time, and yet we must negotiate\r\nthat crux. Add to this that the current was against us till the\r\nwatershed was crossed; that the tide was just at its most baffling\r\nstage, too low to allow us to risk short cuts, and too high to give\r\ndefinition to the banks of the channel; and that the compass was no aid\r\nwhatever for the minor bends. \xe2\x80\x9cTime\xe2\x80\x99s up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, and on we went.\r\nI was hugging the comfortable thought that we should now have booms on\r\nour starboard for the whole distance; on our starboard, I say, for\r\nexperience had taught us that all channels running parallel with the\r\ncoast and islands were uniformly boomed on the northern side. Anyone\r\nless confident than Davies would have succumbed to the temptation of\r\nslavishly relying on these marks, creeping from one to the other, and\r\nwasting precious time. But Davies knew our friend the \xe2\x80\x9cboom\xe2\x80\x9d and his\r\neccentricities too well; and preferred to trust to his sense of touch,\r\nwhich no fog in the world could impair. If we happened to sight one,\r\nwell and good, we should know which side of the channel we were on. But\r\neven this contingent advantage he deliberately sacrificed after a short\r\ndistance, for he crossed over to the _south_ or unboomed side and\r\nsteered and sounded along it, using the ltzendorf Flat as his handrail,\r\nso to speak. He was compelled to do this, he told me afterwards, in\r\nview of the crux, where the converging lines of booms would have\r\ninvolved us in irremediable confusion. Our branch was the southern one,\r\nand it followed that we must use the southern bank, and defer obtaining\r\nany help from booms until sure we were past that critical spot.\r\n\r\nFor an hour we were at the extreme strain, I of physical exertion, he\r\nof mental. I could not get into a steady swing, for little checks were\r\nconstant. My right scull was for ever skidding on mud or weeds, and the\r\nbackward suck of shoal water clogged our progress. Once we were both of\r\nus out in the slime tugging at the dinghy\xe2\x80\x99s sides; then in again,\r\nblundering on. I found the fog bemusing, lost all idea of time and\r\nspace, and felt like a senseless marionette kicking and jerking to a\r\nmad music without tune or time. The misty form of Davies as he sat with\r\nhis right arm swinging rhythmically forward and back, was a clockwork\r\nfigure as mad as myself, but didactic and gibbering in his madness.\r\nThen the boathook he wielded with a circular sweep began to take\r\ngrotesque shapes in my heated fancy; now it was the antenna of a\r\ngroping insect, now the crank of a cripple\xe2\x80\x99s self-propelled\r\nperambulator, now the alpenstock of a lunatic mountaineer, who sits in\r\nhis chair and climbs and climbs to some phantom \xe2\x80\x9cwatershed\xe2\x80\x9d. At the\r\nback of such mind as was left me lodged two insistent thoughts: \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nmust hurry on,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwe are going wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d As to the latter, take a link-boy\r\nthrough a London fog and you will experience the same thing: he always\r\ngoes the way you think is wrong. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re rowing _back_!\xe2\x80\x9d I remember\r\nshouting to Davies once, having become aware that it was now my left\r\nscull which splashed against obstructions. \xe2\x80\x9cRubbish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve crossed over\xe2\x80\x9d; and I relapsed.\r\n\r\nBy degrees I returned to sanity, thanks to improved conditions. It is\r\nan ill wind that blows nobody good, and the state of the tide, though\r\nit threatened us with total failure, had the compensating advantage\r\nthat the lower it fell the more constricted and defined became our\r\nchannel; till the time came when the compass and boathook were alike\r\nunnecessary, because our handrail, the muddy brink of the channel, was\r\nvisible to the eye, close to us; on our right hand always now, for the\r\ncrux was far behind, and the northern side was now our guide. All that\r\nremained was to press on with might and main ere the bed of the creek\r\ndried.\r\n\r\nWhat a race it was! Homeric, in effect; a struggle of men with gods,\r\nfor what were the gods but forces of nature personified? If the God of\r\nthe Falling Tide did not figure in the Olympian circle he is none the\r\nless a mighty divinity. Davies left his post, and rowed stroke. Under\r\nour united efforts the dinghy advanced in strenuous leaps, hurling\r\nminiature rollers on the bank beside us. My palms, seasoned as they\r\nwere, were smarting with watery blisters. The pace was too hot for my\r\nstrength and breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have a rest,\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re over it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\nWe stopped the dinghy dead, and he stabbed over the side with the\r\nboathook. It passed gently astern of us, and even my bewildered brain\r\ntook in the meaning of that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree feet and the current with us. _Well_ over it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npaddle on while you rest and feed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a few minutes past one and we still, as he calculated, had eight\r\nmiles before us, allowing for bends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s a mere question of muscle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nI took his word for it, and munched at tongue and biscuits. As for\r\nmuscle, we were both in hard condition. He was fresh, and what distress\r\nI felt was mainly due to spasmodic exertion culminating in that\r\ndesperate spurt. As for the fog, it had more than once shown a faint\r\ntendency to lift, growing thinner and more luminous, in the manner of\r\nfogs, always to settle down again, heavy as a quilt.\r\n\r\nNote the spot marked \xe2\x80\x9csecond rest\xe2\x80\x9d (approximately correct, Davies says)\r\nand the course of the channel from that point westward. You will see it\r\nbroadening and deepening to the dimensions of a great river, and\r\nfinally merging in the estuary of the Ems. Note, too, that its northern\r\nboundary, the edge of the now uncovered Nordland Sand, leads, with one\r\ninterruption _(marked A),_ direct to Memmert, and is boomed throughout.\r\nYou will then understand why Davies made so light of the rest of his\r\nproblem. Compared with the feats he had performed, it was child\xe2\x80\x99s play,\r\nfor he always had that visible margin to keep touch with if he chose,\r\nor to return to in case of doubt. As a matter of fact\xe2\x80\x94observe our\r\ndotted line\xe2\x80\x94he made two daring departures from it, the first purely to\r\nsave time, the second partly to save time and partly to avoid the very\r\nawkward spot marked A, where a creek with booms and a little delta of\r\nits own interrupts the even bank. During the first of these\r\ndepartures\xe2\x80\x94the shortest but most brilliant\xe2\x80\x94he let me do the rowing, and\r\ndevoted himself to the niceties of the course; during the second, and\r\nthrough both the intermediate stages, he rowed himself, with occasional\r\npauses to inspect the chart. We fell into a long, measured stroke, and\r\ncovered the miles rapidly, scarcely exchanging a single word till, at\r\nthe end of a long pull through vacancy, Davies said suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow where are we to land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sandbank was looming over us crowned by a lonely boom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA quarter of a mile from Memmert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nThe Quartette\r\n\r\n\r\nHis _tour de force_ was achieved, and for the moment something like\r\ncollapse set in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world have we come here for?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered; \xe2\x80\x9cI feel a bit\r\ngiddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made him drink some whisky, which revived him; and then, speaking in\r\nwhispers, we settled certain points.\r\n\r\nI alone was to land. Davies demurred to this out of loyalty, but common\r\nsense, coinciding with a strong aversion of his own, settled the\r\nmatter. Two were more liable to detection than one. I spoke the\r\nlanguage well, and if challenged could cover my retreat with a gruff\r\nword or two; in my woollen overalls, sea-boots, oilskin coat, with a\r\nsou\xe2\x80\x99-wester pulled well over my eyes, I should pass in a fog for a\r\nFrisian. Davies must mind the dinghy; but how was I to regain it? I\r\nhoped to do so without help, by using the edge of the sand; but if he\r\nheard a long whistle he was to blow the foghorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the pocket-compass,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNever budge from the shore without\r\nusing it, and lay it on the ground for steadiness. Take this scrap of\r\nchart, too\xe2\x80\x94it may come in useful; but you can\xe2\x80\x99t miss the dep\xc3\xb4t, it\r\nlooks to be close to the shore. How long will you be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have I got?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young flood\xe2\x80\x99s making\xe2\x80\x94has been for nearly an hour\xe2\x80\x94that bank (he\r\nmeasured it with his eye) will be covering in an hour and a half.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ought to be enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t run it too fine. It\xe2\x80\x99s steep here, but it may shelve farther on.\r\nIf you have to wade you\xe2\x80\x99ll never find me, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll make a deuce of a\r\nrow. Got your watch, matches, knife? No knife? Take mine; never go\r\nanywhere without a knife.\xe2\x80\x9d (It was his seaman\xe2\x80\x99s idea of efficiency.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, we must settle a place to meet at in case I\xe2\x80\x99m late and\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t reach you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Don\xe2\x80\x99t_ be late. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get back to the yacht before we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmissed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I may have to hide and wait till dark\xe2\x80\x94the fog may clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were fools to come, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cThere _are_\r\nno meeting-places in a place like this. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the best I can see on\r\nthe chart\xe2\x80\x94a big triangular beacon marked on the very point of Memmert.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll pass it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99m off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood luck,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, faintly.\r\n\r\nI stepped out, climbed a miry glacis of five or six feet, reached hard\r\nwet sand, and strode away with the sluggish ripple of the Balje on my\r\nleft hand. A curtain dropped between me and Davies, and I was\r\nalone\xe2\x80\x94alone, but how I thrilled to feel the firm sand rustle under my\r\nboots; to know that it led to dry land, where, whatever befell, I could\r\ngive my wits full play. I clove the fog briskly.\r\n\r\nGood Heavens! what was that? I stopped short and listened. From over\r\nthe water on my left there rang out, dulled by fog, but distinct to the\r\near, three double strokes on a bell or gong. I looked at my watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShip at anchor,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cSix bells in the afternoon watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI knew the Balje was here a deep roadstead, where a vessel entering the\r\nEastern Ems might very well anchor to ride out a fog.\r\n\r\nI was just stepping forward when another sound followed from the same\r\nquarter, a bugle-call this time. Then I understood\xe2\x80\x94only men-of-war\r\nsound bugles\xe2\x80\x94the _Blitz_ was here then; and very natural, too, I\r\nthought, and strode on. The sand was growing drier, the water farther\r\nbeneath me; then came a thin black ribbon of weed\xe2\x80\x94high-water mark. A\r\nfew cautious steps to the right and I touched tufts of marram grass. It\r\nwas Memmert. I pulled out the chart and refreshed my memory. No! there\r\ncould be no mistake; keep the sea on my left and I must go right. I\r\nfollowed the ribbon of weed, keeping it just in view, but walking on\r\nthe verge of the grass for the sake of silence. All at once I almost\r\ntripped over a massive iron bar; others, a rusty network of them, grew\r\ninto being above and around me, like the arms of a ghostly polyp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat infernal spider\xe2\x80\x99s web is this?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, and stumbled clear. I\r\nhad strayed into the base of a gigantic tripod, its gaunt legs stayed\r\nand cross-stayed, its apex lost in fog; the beacon, I remembered. A\r\nhundred yards farther and I was down on my knees again, listening with\r\nmight and main; for several little sounds were in the air\xe2\x80\x94voices, the\r\nrasp of a boat\xe2\x80\x99s keel, the whistling of a tune. These were straight\r\nahead. More to the left, seaward, that is, I had aural evidence of the\r\npresence of a steamboat\xe2\x80\x94a small one, for the hiss of escaping steam was\r\nlow down. On my right front I as yet heard nothing, but the dep\xc3\xb4t must\r\nbe there.\r\n\r\nI prepared to strike away from my base, and laid the compass on the\r\nground\xe2\x80\x94NW. roughly I made the course. (\xe2\x80\x9cSouth-east\xe2\x80\x94south-east for\r\ncoming back,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated inwardly, like a child learning a lesson.)\r\nThen of my two allies I abandoned one, the beach, and threw myself\r\nwholly on the fog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlay the game,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody expects you; nobody will\r\nrecognise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI advanced in rapid stages of ten yards or so, while grass disappeared\r\nand soft sand took its place, pitted everywhere with footmarks. I trod\r\ncarefully, for obstructions began to show themselves\xe2\x80\x94an anchor, a heap\r\nof rusty cable; then a boat bottom upwards, and, lying on it, a foul\r\nold meerschaum pipe. I paused here and strained my ears, for there were\r\nsounds in many directions; the same whistling (behind me now), heavy\r\nfootsteps in front, and somewhere beyond\xe2\x80\x94fifty yards away, I reckoned\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nbuzz of guttural conversation; from the same quarter there drifted to\r\nmy nostrils the acrid odour of coarse tobacco. Then a door banged.\r\n\r\nI put the compass in my pocket (thinking \xe2\x80\x9csouth-east, south-east\xe2\x80\x9d),\r\nplaced the pipe between my teeth (ugh! the rank savour of it!) rammed\r\nmy sou\xe2\x80\x99-wester hard down, and slouched on in the direction of the door\r\nthat had banged. A voice in front called, \xe2\x80\x9cKarl Schicker\xe2\x80\x9d; a nearer\r\nvoice, that of the man whose footsteps I had heard approaching, took it\r\nup and called \xe2\x80\x9cKarl Schicker\xe2\x80\x9d: I, too, took it up, and, turning my\r\nback, called \xe2\x80\x9cKarl Schicker\xe2\x80\x9d as gruffly and gutturally as I could. The\r\nfootsteps passed quite close to me, and glancing over my shoulder I saw\r\na young man passing, dressed very like me, but wearing a sealskin cap\r\ninstead of a sou\xe2\x80\x99-wester. As he walked he seemed to be counting coins\r\nin his palm. A hail came back from the beach and the whistling stopped.\r\n\r\nI now became aware that I was on a beaten track. These meetings were\r\nhazardous, so I inclined aside, but not without misgivings, for the\r\npath led towards the buzz of talk and the banging door, and these were\r\nmy only guides to the dep\xc3\xb4t. Suddenly, and much before I expected it, I\r\nknew rather than saw that a wall was in front of me; now it was\r\nvisible, the side of a low building of corrugated iron. A pause to\r\nreconnoitre was absolutely necessary; but the knot of talkers might\r\nhave heard my footsteps, and I must at all costs not suggest the\r\ngroping of a stranger. I lit a match\xe2\x80\x94two\xe2\x80\x94and sucked heavily (as I had\r\nseen navvies do) at my pipe, studying the trend of the wall by\r\nreference to the sounds. There was a stale dottle wedged in the bowl,\r\nand loathsome fumes resulted. Just then the same door banged again;\r\nanother name, which I forget, was called out. I decided that I was at\r\nthe end of a rectangular building which I pictured as like an Aldershot\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chut\xe2\x80\x9d, and that the door I heard was round the corner to my left. A\r\nknot of men must be gathered there, entering it by turns. Having\r\nexpectorated noisily, I followed the tin wall to my _right,_ and\r\nturning a corner strolled leisurely on, passing signs of domesticity, a\r\nwashtub, a water-butt, then a tiled approach to an open door. I now was\r\naware of the corner of a second building, also of zinc, parallel to the\r\nfirst, but taller, for I could only just see the eave. I was just going\r\nto turn off to this as a more promising field for exploration, when I\r\nheard a window open ahead of me in my original building.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I am getting obscure, so I append a rough sketch of the\r\nscene, as I partly saw and chiefly imagined it. It was window (A) that\r\nI heard open. From it I could just distinguish through the fog a hand\r\nprotrude, and throw something out\xe2\x80\x94cigar-end? The hand, a clean one with\r\na gold signet ring, rested for an instant afterwards on the sash, and\r\nthen closed the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: diagram, Memmert Salvage Depot\r\n\r\nMy geography was clear now in one respect. That window belonged to the\r\nsame room as the banging door (B); for I distinctly heard the latter\r\nopen and shut again, opposite me on the other side of the building. It\r\nstruck me that it might be interesting to see into that room. \xe2\x80\x9cPlay the\r\ngame,\xe2\x80\x9d I reminded myself, and retreated a few yards back on tiptoe,\r\nthen turned and sauntered coolly past the window, puffing my villainous\r\npipe and taking a long deliberate look into the interior as I\r\npassed\xe2\x80\x94the more deliberate that at the first instant I realised that\r\nnobody inside was disturbing himself about me. As I had expected (in\r\nview of the fog and the time) there was artificial light within. My\r\nmental photograph was as follows: a small room with varnished deal\r\nwalls and furnished like an office; in the far right-hand corner a\r\ncounting-house desk, Grimm sitting at it on a high stool, side-face to\r\nme, counting money; opposite him in an awkward attitude a burly fellow\r\nin seaman\xe2\x80\x99s dress holding a diver\xe2\x80\x99s helmet. In the middle of the room a\r\ndeal table, and on it something big and black. Lolling on chairs near\r\nit, their backs to me and their faces turned towards the desk and the\r\ndiver, two men\xe2\x80\x94von Br\xc3\xbcning and an older man with a bald yellow head\r\n(Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s companion on the steamer, beyond a doubt). On another\r\nchair, with its back actually tilted against the window, Dollmann.\r\n\r\nSuch were the principal features of the scene; for details I had to\r\nmake another inspection. Stooping low, I crept back, quiet as a cat,\r\ntill I was beneath the window, and, as I calculated, directly behind\r\nDollmann\xe2\x80\x99s chair. Then with great caution I raised my head. There was\r\nonly one pair of eyes in the room that I feared in the least, and that\r\nwas Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s, who sat in profile to me, farthest away. I instantly put\r\nDollmann\xe2\x80\x99s back between Grimm and me, and then made my scrutiny. As I\r\nmade it, I could feel a cold sweat distilling on my forehead and\r\ntickling my spine; not from fear or excitement, but from pure ignominy.\r\nFor beyond all doubt I was present at the meeting of a _bona-fide_\r\nsalvage company. It was pay-day, and the directors appeared to be\r\ntaking stock of work done; that was all.\r\n\r\nOver the door was an old engraving of a two-decker under full sail;\r\npinned on the wall a chart and the plan of a ship. Relics of the\r\nwrecked frigate abounded. On a shelf above the stove was a small\r\npyramid of encrusted cannon-balls, and supported on nails at odd places\r\non the walls were corroded old pistols, and what I took to be the\r\nremains of a sextant. In a corner of the floor sat a hoary little\r\ncarronade, carriage and all. None of these things affected me so much\r\nas a pile of lumber on the floor, not firewood but unmistakable\r\nwreck-wood, black as bog-oak, still caked in places with the mud of\r\nages. Nor was it the mere sight of this lumber that dumbfounded me. It\r\nwas the fact that a fragment of it, a balk of curved timber garnished\r\nwith some massive bolts, lay on the table, and was evidently an object\r\nof earnest interest. The diver had turned and was arguing with gestures\r\nover it; von Br\xc3\xbcning and Grimm were pressing another view. The diver\r\nshook his head frequently, finally shrugged his shoulders, made a\r\nsalutation, and left the room. Their movements had kept me ducking my\r\nhead pretty frequently, but I now grew almost reckless as to whether I\r\nwas seen or not. All the weaknesses of my theory crowded on me\xe2\x80\x94the\r\narguments Davies had used at Bensersiel; Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthoughtless talk; the ease (comparatively) with which I had reached\r\nthis spot, not a barrier to cross or a lock to force; the publicity of\r\ntheir passage to Memmert by Dollmann, his friend, and Grimm; and now\r\nthis glimpse of business-like routine. In a few moments I sank from\r\ndepth to depth of scepticism. Where were my mines, torpedoes, and\r\nsubmarine boats, and where my imperial conspirators? Was gold after all\r\nat the bottom of this sordid mystery? Dollmann after all a commonplace\r\ncriminal? The ladder of proof I had mounted tottered and shook beneath\r\nme. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said the faint voice of reason. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are your\r\nfour men. Wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo more _employ\xc3\xa9s_ came into the room in quick succession and received\r\nwages; one looking like a fireman, the other of a superior type, the\r\nskipper of a tug, say. There was another discussion with this latter\r\nover the balk of wreck-wood, and this man, too, shrugged his shoulders.\r\nHis departure appeared to end the meeting. Grimm shut up a ledger, and\r\nI shrank down on my knees, for a general shifting of chairs began. At\r\nthe same time, from the other side of the building, I heard my knot of\r\nmen retreating beachwards, spitting and chatting as they went.\r\nPresently someone walked across the room towards my window. I sidled\r\naway on all fours, rose and flattened myself erect against the wall, a\r\nsickening despondency on me; my intention to slink away south-east as\r\nsoon as the coast was clear. But the sound that came next pricked me\r\nlike an electric shock; it was the tinkle and scrape of curtain-rings.\r\n\r\nQuick as thought I was back in my old position, to find my view barred\r\nby a cretonne curtain. It was in one piece, with no chink for my\r\nbenefit, but it did not hang straight, bulging towards me under the\r\npressure of something\xe2\x80\x94human shoulders by the shape. Dollmann, I\r\nconcluded, was still in his old place. I now was exasperated to find\r\nthat I could scarcely hear a word that was said, not even by pressing\r\nmy ear against the glass. It was not that the speakers were of set\r\npurpose hushing their voices\xe2\x80\x94they used an ordinary tone for intimate\r\ndiscussion\xe2\x80\x94but the glass and curtain deadened the actual words. Still,\r\nI was soon able to distinguish general characteristics. Von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94the only one I had ever heard before\xe2\x80\x94I recognised at once; he was\r\non the left of the table, and Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s I knew from his position. The\r\nthird was a harsh croak, belonging to the old gentleman whom, for\r\nconvenience, I shall prematurely begin to call Herr B\xc3\xb6hme. It was too\r\nold a voice to be Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s; besides, it had the ring of authority, and\r\nwas dealing at the moment in sharp interrogations. Three of its\r\nsentences I caught in their entirety. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen was that?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThey went no\r\nfarther?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cToo long; out of the question.\xe2\x80\x9d Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s voice, though\r\nnearest to me, was the least audible of all. It was a dogged monotone,\r\nand what was that odd movement of the curtain at his back? Yes, his\r\nhands were behind him clutching and kneading a fold of the cretonne.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are feeling uncomfortable, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d was my comment. Suddenly he\r\nthrew back his head\xe2\x80\x94I saw the dent of it\xe2\x80\x94and spoke up so that I could\r\nnot miss a word. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, sir, you shall see them at supper\r\nto-night; I will ask them both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(You will not be surprised to learn that I instantly looked at my\r\nwatch\xe2\x80\x94though it takes long to write what I have described\xe2\x80\x94but the time\r\nwas only a quarter to four.) He added something about the fog, and his\r\nchair creaked. Ducking promptly I heard the curtain-rings jar, and:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThick as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour report, Herr Dollmann,\xe2\x80\x9d said B\xc3\xb6hme, curtly. Dollmann left the\r\nwindow and moved his chair up to the table; the other two drew in\r\ntheirs and settled themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Chatham,_\xe2\x80\x9d said Dollmann, as if announcing a heading. It was an easy\r\nword to catch, rapped out sharp, and you can imagine how it startled\r\nme. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where you\xe2\x80\x99ve been for the last month!\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself. A\r\nmap crackled and I knew they were bending over it, while Dollmann\r\nexplained something. But now my exasperation became acute, for not a\r\nsyllable more reached me. Squatting back on my heels, I cast about for\r\nexpedients. Should I steal round and try the door? Too dangerous. Climb\r\nto the roof and listen down the stove-pipe? Too noisy, and generally\r\nhopeless. I tried for a downward purchase on the upper half of the\r\nwindow, which was of the simple sort in two sections, working\r\nvertically. No use; it resisted gentle pressure, would start with a\r\nsudden jar if I forced it. I pulled out Davies\xe2\x80\x99s knife and worked the\r\npoint of the blade between sash and frame to give it play\xe2\x80\x94no result;\r\nbut the knife was a nautical one, with a marlin-spike as well as a big\r\nblade.\r\n\r\nJust now the door within opened and shut again, and I heard steps\r\napproaching round the corner to my right. I had the presence of mind\r\nnot to lose a moment, but moved silently away (blessing the deep\r\nFrisian sand) round the corner of the big parallel building. Someone\r\nwhom I could not see walked past till his boots clattered on tiles,\r\nnext resounded on boards. \xe2\x80\x9cGrimm in his living-room,\xe2\x80\x9d I inferred. The\r\nprecious minutes ebbed away\xe2\x80\x94five, ten, fifteen. Had he gone for good? I\r\ndared not return otherwise. Eighteen\xe2\x80\x94he was coming out! This time I\r\nstole forward boldly when the man had just passed, dimly saw a figure,\r\nand clearly enough the glint of a white paper he was holding. He made\r\nhis circuit and re-entered the room.\r\n\r\nHere I felt and conquered a relapse to scepticism. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this is an\r\nimportant conclave why don\xe2\x80\x99t they set guards?\xe2\x80\x9d Answer, the only\r\npossible one, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause they stand alone. Their _employ\xc3\xa9s,_ like\r\n_everyone_ we had met hitherto, know nothing. The real object of this\r\nsalvage company (a poor speculation, I opined) is solely to afford a\r\npretext for the conclave.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the curtain, even?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBecause there are\r\nmaps, stupid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was back again at the window, but as impotent as ever against that\r\neven stream of low confidential talk. But I would not give up. Fate and\r\nthe fog had brought me here, the one solitary soul perhaps who by the\r\nchain of circumstances had both the will and the opportunity to wrest\r\ntheir secret from these four men.\r\n\r\nThe marlin-spike! Where the lower half of the window met the sill it\r\nsank into a shallow groove. I thrust the point of the spike down into\r\nthe interstice between sash and frame and heaved with a slowly\r\nincreasing force, which I could regulate to the fraction of an ounce,\r\non this powerful lever. The sash gave, with the faintest possible\r\nprotest, and by imperceptible degrees I lifted it to the top of the\r\ngroove, and the least bit above it, say half an inch in all; but it\r\nmade an appreciable difference to the sounds within, as when you remove\r\nyour foot from a piano\xe2\x80\x99s soft pedal. I could do no more, for there was\r\nno further fulcrum for the spike, and I dared not gamble away what I\r\nhad won by using my hands.\r\n\r\nHope sank again when I placed my cheek on the damp sill, and my ear to\r\nthe chink. My men were close round the table referring to papers which\r\nI heard rustle. Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d was evidently over, and I rarely\r\nheard his voice; Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s occasionally, von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s and B\xc3\xb6hme\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfrequently; but, as before, it was the latter only that I could ever\r\ncount on for an intelligible word. For, unfortunately, the villains of\r\nthe piece plotted without any regard to dramatic fitness or to my\r\ninterests. Immersed in a subject with which they were all familiar,\r\nthey were allusive, elliptic, and persistently technical. Many of the\r\nwords I did catch were unknown to me. The rest were, for the most part,\r\neither letters of the alphabet or statistical figures, of depth,\r\ndistance, and, once or twice, of time. The letters of the alphabet\r\nrecurred often, and seemed, as far as I could make out, to represent\r\nthe key to the cipher. The numbers clustering round them were mostly\r\nvery small, with decimals. What maddened me most was the scarcity of\r\nplain nouns.\r\n\r\nTo report what I heard to the reader would be impossible; so chaotic\r\nwas most of it that it left no impression on my own memory. All I can\r\ndo is to tell him what fragments stuck, and what nebulous\r\nclassification I involved. The letters ran from A to G, and my best\r\ncontinuous chance came when B\xc3\xb6hme, reading rapidly from a paper, I\r\nthink, went through the letters, backwards, from G, adding remarks to\r\neach; thus: \xe2\x80\x9cG. . . completed.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cF. . . bad. . . 1.3 (metres?). . .2.5\r\n(kilometres?).\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cE . . . thirty-two. . . 1.2.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cD. . . 3 weeks. . .\r\nthirty.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cC. . .\xe2\x80\x9d and so on.\r\n\r\nAnother time he went through this list again, only naming each letter\r\nhimself, and receiving laconic answers from Grimm\xe2\x80\x94answers which seemed\r\nto be numbers, but I could not be sure. For minutes together I caught\r\nnothing but the scratching of pens and inarticulate mutterings. But out\r\nof the muck-heap I picked five pearls\xe2\x80\x94four sibilant nouns and a name\r\nthat I knew before. The nouns were \xe2\x80\x9cSchleppboote\xe2\x80\x9d (tugs); \xe2\x80\x9cWassertiefe\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(depth of water); \xe2\x80\x9cEisenbahn\xe2\x80\x9d (railway); \xe2\x80\x9cLotsen\xe2\x80\x9d (pilots). The name,\r\nalso sibilant and thus easier to hear, was \xe2\x80\x9cEsens\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times I had to stand back and ease my cramped neck, and on\r\neach occasion I looked at my watch, for I was listening against time,\r\njust as we had rowed against time. We were going to be asked to supper,\r\nand must be back aboard the yacht in time to receive the invitation.\r\nThe fog still brooded heavily and the light, always bad, was growing\r\nworse. How would _they_ get back? How had they come from Juist? Could\r\nwe forestall them? Questions of time, tide, distance\xe2\x80\x94just the odious\r\nsort of sums I was unfit to cope with\xe2\x80\x94were distracting my attention\r\nwhen it should have been wholly elsewhere. 4.20\xe2\x80\x944.25\xe2\x80\x94now it was past\r\n4.30 when Davies said the bank would cover. I should have to make for\r\nthe beacon; but it was fatally near that steamboat path, etc., and I\r\nstill at intervals heard voices from there. It must have been about\r\n4.35 when there was another shifting of chairs within. Then someone\r\nrose, collected papers, and went out; someone else, _without_ rising\r\n(therefore Grimm), followed him.\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the room for a minute, and after that, for the\r\nfirst time, I heard some plain colloquial German, with no accompaniment\r\nof scratching or rustling. \xe2\x80\x9cI must wait for this,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, and\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe insists on coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said B\xc3\xb6hme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAch!\xe2\x80\x9d (an ejaculation of surprise and protest from von Br\xc3\xbcning).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said the 25th.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tide serves well. The night-train, of course. Tell Grimm to be\r\nready\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (An inaudible question from von Br\xc3\xbcning.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, any weather.\xe2\x80\x9d A laugh from von Br\xc3\xbcning and some words I could not\r\ncatch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one, with half a load.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c.....meet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\x94how\xe2\x80\x99s the fog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis appeared to be really the end. Both men rose and steps came\r\ntowards the window. I leapt aside as I heard it thrown up, and covered\r\nby the noise backed into safety. Von Br\xc3\xbcning called \xe2\x80\x9cGrimm!\xe2\x80\x9d and that,\r\nand the open window, decided me that my line of advance was now too\r\ndangerous to retreat by. The only alternative was to make a circuit\r\nround the bigger of the two buildings\xe2\x80\x94and an interminable circuit it\r\nseemed\xe2\x80\x94and all the while I knew my compass-course \xe2\x80\x9csouth-east\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\ngrowing nugatory. I passed a padlocked door, two corners, and faced the\r\nvoid of fog. Out came the compass, and I steadied myself for the sum.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSouth-east before\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m farther to the eastward now\xe2\x80\x94east will about do\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand off I went, with an error of four whole points, over tussocks and\r\ndeep sand. The beach seemed much farther off than I had thought, and I\r\nbegan to get alarmed, puzzled over the compass several times, and\r\nfinally realised that I had lost my way. I had the sense not to make\r\nmatters worse by trying to find it again, and, as the lesser of two\r\nevils, blew my whistle, softly at first, then louder. The bray of a\r\nfoghorn sounded right _behind_ me. I whistled again and then ran for my\r\nlife, the horn sounding at intervals. In three or four minutes I was on\r\nthe beach and in the dinghy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nA Change of Tactics\r\n\r\n\r\nWe pushed off without a word, and paddled out of sight of the beach. A\r\nvoice was approaching, hailing us. \xe2\x80\x9cHail back,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Davies;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpretend we\xe2\x80\x99re a galliot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo-a,\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOff Memmert,\xe2\x80\x9d came back. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you bound?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelfzyl,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelf-zyl,\xe2\x80\x9d I bawled.\r\n\r\nA sentence ending with \xe2\x80\x9canchor\xe2\x80\x9d was returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe flood\xe2\x80\x99s tearing east,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Davies; \xe2\x80\x9csit still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe heard no more, and, after a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 drifting, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat luck?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDavies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne or two clues, and an invitation to supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clues I left till later; the invitation was the thing, and I\r\nexplained its urgency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will _they_ get back?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cif the fog lasts the\r\nsteamer\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can count for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was some little\r\nsteamboat off the dep\xc3\xb4t, and the fog may lift. Which is our quickest\r\nway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this tide, a bee-line to Norderney by compass; we shall have water\r\nover all the banks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had all his preparations made, the lamp lit in advance, the compass\r\nin position, and we started at once; he at the bow-oar where he had\r\nbetter control over the boat\xe2\x80\x99s nose; lamp and compass on the floor\r\nbetween us. Twilight thickened into darkness\xe2\x80\x94a choking, pasty\r\ndarkness\xe2\x80\x94and still we sped unfalteringly over that trackless waste,\r\nsitting and swinging in our little pool of stifled orange light. To\r\ndrown fatigue and suspense I conned over my clues, and tried to carve\r\ninto my memory every fugitive word I had overheard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are there seven of round here?\xe2\x80\x9d I called back to Davies once\r\n(thinking of A to G). \xe2\x80\x9cSorry,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, for no answer came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see a star,\xe2\x80\x9d was my next word, after a long interval. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone. There it is again! Right aft!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Borkum light,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, presently; \xe2\x80\x9cthe fog\xe2\x80\x99s lifting.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nkeen wind from the west struck our faces, and as swiftly as it had come\r\nthe fog rolled away from us, in one mighty mass, stripping clean and\r\npure the starry dome of heaven, still bright with the western\r\nafter-glow, and beginning to redden in the east to the rising moon.\r\nNorderney light was flashing ahead, and Davies could take his tired\r\neyes from the pool of light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d was all he uttered in the way of gratitude for this mercy, and\r\nI felt very much the same; for in a fog Davies in a dinghy was a match\r\nfor a steamer; in a clear he lost his handicap.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter to seven. \xe2\x80\x9cAn hour\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, if we buck up,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\npronounced, after taking a rough bearing with the two lights. He\r\npointed out a star to me, which we were to keep exactly astern, and\r\nagain I applied to their labour my aching back and smarting palms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say about seven of something?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are there seven of hereabouts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIslands, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the clue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen followed the most singular of all our confabulations. Two memories\r\nare better than one, and the sooner I carved the cipher into his memory\r\nas well as mine the better record we should have. So, with rigid\r\neconomy of breath, I snapped out all my story, and answered his\r\nbreathless questions. It saved me from being mesmerised by the star,\r\nand both of us from the consciousness of over-fatigue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpying at Chatham, the blackguard?\xe2\x80\x9d he hissed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you make of it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing about battleships, mines, forts?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing about the Ems, Emden, Wilhelmshaven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing about transports?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe\xe2\x80\x94I was right\xe2\x80\x94after all\xe2\x80\x94something to do\xe2\x80\x94with the\r\nchannels\xe2\x80\x94behind islands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so that outworn creed took a new lease of life; though for my part\r\nthe words that clashed with it were those that had sunk the deepest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEsens,\xe2\x80\x9d I protested; \xe2\x80\x9cthat town behind Bensersiel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWassertiefe, Lotsen, Schleppboote,\xe2\x80\x9d spluttered Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKilometre\xe2\x80\x94Eisenbahn,\xe2\x80\x9d from me, and so on.\r\n\r\nI should earn the just execration of the reader if I continued to\r\nreport such a dialogue. Suffice to say that we realised very soon that\r\nthe substance of the plot was still a riddle. On the other hand, there\r\nwas fresh scent, abundance of it; and the question was already taking\r\nshape\xe2\x80\x94were we to follow it up or revert to last night\xe2\x80\x99s decision and\r\nstrike with what weapons we had? It was a pressing question, too, the\r\nlast of many\xe2\x80\x94was there to be no end to the emergencies of this crowded\r\nday?\xe2\x80\x94pressing for reasons I could not define, while convinced that we\r\nmust be ready with an answer by supper-time to-night.\r\n\r\nMeantime, we were nearing Norderney; the See Gat was crossed, and with\r\nthe last of the flood tide fair beneath us, and the red light on the\r\nwest pier burning ahead, we began insensibly to relax our efforts. But\r\nI dared not rest, for I was at that point of exhaustion when mechanical\r\nmovement was my only hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLight astern,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, thickly. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo\xe2\x80\x94white and red.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteamer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cgoing south though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA neat triangle of gems\xe2\x80\x94topaz, ruby, and emerald\xe2\x80\x94hung steady behind us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurned east,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cBuck up\xe2\x80\x94steamer from Juist. No, by Jove!\r\ntoo small. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn we laboured, while the gems waxed in brilliancy as the steamer\r\noverhauled us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cI seem to know those lights\xe2\x80\x94the _Blitz_\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlaunch\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s be caught rowing like madmen in a muck sweat. Paddle\r\ninshore a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d He was right, and, as in a dream, I saw hurrying and\r\npalpitating up the same little pinnace that had towed us out of\r\nBensersiel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re done for now,\xe2\x80\x9d I remember thinking, for the guilt of the runaway\r\nwas strong in me; and an old remark of von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s about \xe2\x80\x9cpolice\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nin my ears. But she was level with and past us before I could sink far\r\ninto despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree of them behind the hood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies: \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, and essayed a feeble stroke, but the blade\r\nscuttered over the surface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s wait about for a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re late anyhow. If they\r\ngo to the yacht they\xe2\x80\x99ll think we\xe2\x80\x99re ashore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur shore clothes\xe2\x80\x94lying about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you up to talking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but we must. The least suspicion\xe2\x80\x99ll do for us now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your scull, old chap, and put on your coat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe extinguished the lantern, lit a pipe, and then rowed slowly on,\r\nwhile I sat on a slack heap in the stern and devoted my last resources\r\nof will to the emancipation of the spirit from the tired flesh.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes or so we were rounding the pier, and there was the\r\nyacht\xe2\x80\x99s top-mast against the sky. I saw, too, that the launch was\r\nalongside of her, and told Davies so. Then I lit a cigarette, and made\r\na lamentable effort to whistle. Davies followed suit, and emitted a\r\nstrange melody which I took to be \xe2\x80\x9cHome, Sweet Home,\xe2\x80\x9d but he has not\r\nthe slightest ear for music.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they\xe2\x80\x99re on board, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cthe cabin\xe2\x80\x99s lighted. Ahoy\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted as we came up. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said a sailor, who was fending off the yacht with\r\na boathook. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Commander von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s launch. I think the gentlemen\r\nwant to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore we could answer, an exclamation of: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here they are!\xe2\x80\x9d came\r\nfrom the deck of the _Dulcibella_, and the dim form of von Br\xc3\xbcning\r\nhimself emerged from the companionway. There was something of a scuffle\r\ndown below, which the Commander nearly succeeded in drowning by the\r\nbreeziness of his greeting. Meanwhile, the ladder creaked under fresh\r\nweight, and Dollmann appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Herr Davies?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo! Herr Dollmann,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9chow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI must explain that we had floated up between the yacht and the launch,\r\nwhose sailors had passed her a little aside in order to give us room.\r\nHer starboard side-light was just behind and above us, pouring its\r\ngreen rays obliquely over the deck of the _Dulcibella_, while we and\r\nthe dinghy were in deep shadow between. The most studied calculation\r\ncould not have secured us more favourable conditions for a moment which\r\nI had always dreaded\xe2\x80\x94the meeting of Davies and Dollmann. The former,\r\nhaving shortened his sculls, just sat where he was, half turned towards\r\nthe yacht and looking up at his enemy. No lineament of his own face\r\ncould have been visible to the latter, while those pitiless green\r\nrays\xe2\x80\x94you know their ravaging effect on the human physiognomy\xe2\x80\x94struck\r\nfull on Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s face. It was my first fair view of it at close\r\nquarters, and, secure in my background of gloom, I feasted with a\r\nluxury of superstitious abhorrence on the livid smiling mask that for a\r\nfew moments stooped peering down towards Davies. One of the caprices of\r\nthe crude light was to obliterate, or at any rate so penetrate, beard\r\nand moustache, as to reveal in outline lips and chin, the features in\r\nwhich defects of character are most surely betrayed, especially when\r\nyour victim smiles. Accuse me, if you will, of stooping to melodramatic\r\nembroidery; object that my own prejudiced fancy contributed to the\r\nresult; but I can, nevertheless, never efface the impression of\r\nmalignant perfidy and base passion, exaggerated to caricature, that I\r\nreceived in those few instants. Another caprice of the light was to\r\nidentify the man with the portrait of him when younger and\r\nclean-shaven, in the frontispiece of his own book; and another still,\r\nthe most repulsively whimsical of all, was to call forth a strong\r\nresemblance to the sweet young girl who had been with us yesterday.\r\n\r\nEnough! I shall never offend again in this way. In reality I am much\r\nmore inclined to laugh than shudder over this meeting; for meanwhile\r\nthe third of our self-invited guests had with stertorous puffing risen\r\nto the stage, for all the world like a demon out of a trapdoor,\r\nspecially when he entered the zone of that unearthly light. And there\r\nthey stood in a row, like delinquents at judgement, while we, the true\r\nculprits, had only passively to accept explanations. Of course these\r\nwere plausible enough. Dollmann having seen the yacht in port that\r\nmorning had called on his return from Memmert to ask us to supper.\r\nFinding no one aboard, and concluding we were ashore, he had meant to\r\nleave a note for Davies in the cabin. His friend, Herr B\xc3\xb6hme, _\xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ndistinguished engineer,\xe2\x80\x9d_ was anxious to see over the little vessel\r\nthat had come so far, and he knew that Davies would not mind the\r\nintrusion. Not at all, said Davies; would not they stop and have\r\ndrinks? No, but would we come to supper at Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s villa? With\r\npleasure, said Davies, but we had to change first. Up to this point we\r\nhad been masters of the situation; but here von Br\xc3\xbcning, who alone of\r\nthe three appeared to be entirely at his ease, made the _retour\r\noffensif_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, rowing about since the fog cleared,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\nI suppose he thought that evasion would pass muster, but as he spoke, I\r\nnoticed to my horror that a stray beam of light was playing on the\r\nbunch of white cotton-waste that adorned one of the rowlocks: for we\r\nhad forgotten to remove these tell-tale appendages. So I added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter ducks again\xe2\x80\x9d; and, lifting one of the guns, let the light flash\r\non its barrel. To my own ears my voice sounded husky and distant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways ducks,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed von Br\xc3\xbcning. \xe2\x80\x9cNo luck, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it ought to be a good time after sunset\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, with a rising tide and the banks covered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe saw some,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, sullenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what, my zealous young sportsmen, you\xe2\x80\x99re rash to leave your\r\nboat at anchor here after dark without a light. I came aboard to find\r\nyour lamp and set it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cwe took it with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see to shoot by?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe laughed uncomfortably, and Davies compassed a wonderful German\r\nphrase to the effect that \xe2\x80\x9cit might come in useful\xe2\x80\x9d. Happily the matter\r\nwent no farther, for the position was a strained one at the best, and\r\nwould not bear lengthening. The launch went alongside, and the invaders\r\nevacuated British soil, looking, for all von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s flippant\r\nnonchalance, a rather crestfallen party. So much so, that, acute as was\r\nmy anxiety, I took courage to whisper to Davies, while the transhipment\r\nof Herr B\xc3\xb6hme was proceeding: \xe2\x80\x9cAsk Dollmann to stay while we dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Herr Dollmann,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t you stay on board with us\r\nwhile we dress? There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to tell you, and\xe2\x80\x94and we can follow on\r\nwith you when we\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDollmann had not yet stepped into the launch. \xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said;\r\nbut there followed an ominous silence, broken by von Br\xc3\xbcning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come along, Dollmann, and let them alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said brusquely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be horribly in the way down there, and we shall never get any\r\nsupper if you keep them yarning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s now a quarter-past eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled Herr B\xc3\xb6hme from\r\nhis corner behind the hood. Dollmann submitted, and excused himself,\r\nand the launch steamed away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I twig,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, as he helped, almost hoisted, me aboard.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather risky though\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew they\xe2\x80\x99d object\xe2\x80\x94only wanted to make sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cabin was just as we had left it, our shore clothes lying in\r\ndisorder on the bunks, a locker or two half open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wonder what they did down here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\nFor my part I went straight to the bookshelf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes anything strike you about this?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, kneeling on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLogbook\xe2\x80\x99s shifted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll swear it was at the end\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove!\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x99s Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s here all right, but not where it should be.\xe2\x80\x9d I had been reading\r\nit, you remember, overnight, and in the morning had replaced it in full\r\nview among the other books. I now found it behind them, in a wrenched\r\nattitude, which showed that someone who had no time to spare had pushed\r\nit roughly inwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you make of that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\nHe produced long drinks, and we allowed ourselves ten minutes of\r\nabsolute rest, stretched at full length on the sofas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t trust Dollmann,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI spotted that at Memmert even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, when they were talking about you and me. He was on his defence,\r\nand in a deuce of a funk, too. B\xc3\xb6hme was pressing him hard. Again, at\r\nthe end, when he left the room followed by Grimm, who I\xe2\x80\x99m certain was\r\nsent to watch him. It was while he was away that the other two arranged\r\nthat rendezvous for the night of the 25th. And again just now, when you\r\nasked him to stay. I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s working out as I thought it would.\r\nVon Br\xc3\xbcning, and through him B\xc3\xb6hme (who is the \xe2\x80\x9cengineer from Bremen\xe2\x80\x9d),\r\nknow the story of that short cut and suspect that it was an attempt on\r\nyour life. Dollmann daren\xe2\x80\x99t confess to that, because, morality apart,\r\nit could only have been prompted by extreme necessity\xe2\x80\x94that is, by the\r\nknowledge that you were really dangerous, and not merely an inquisitive\r\nstranger. Now _we_ know his motive; but they don\xe2\x80\x99t yet. The position of\r\nthat book proves it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shoved it in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo prevent them seeing it. There\xe2\x80\x99s no earthly reason why _they_ should\r\nhave hidden it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99re getting on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cThat shows they know his real\r\nname, or why should he shove the book in? But they don\xe2\x80\x99t know he wrote\r\na book, and that I have a copy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate he _thinks_ they don\xe2\x80\x99t; we can\xe2\x80\x99t say more than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does he think about me\xe2\x80\x94and you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the point. Ten to one he\xe2\x80\x99s in tortures of doubt, and would give\r\na fortune to have five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 talk alone with you to see how the land\r\nlies and get your version of the short cut incident. But they won\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nhim. They want to watch him in our company and us in his; you see it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan interesting reunion for you and him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s get into these beastly clothes for it,\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Davis. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall have a plunge overboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething drastic was required, and I followed his example, curious as\r\nthe hour was for bathing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I know what happened just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as we plied rough\r\ntowels in the warmth below. \xe2\x80\x9cThey steamed up and found nobody on board.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave a note,\xe2\x80\x99 says Dollmann. \xe2\x80\x98No independent communications,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsay they (or think they), \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99ll come too, and take the chance of\r\ninspecting this hornets\xe2\x80\x99 nest.\xe2\x80\x99 Down they go, and Dollmann, who knows\r\nwhat to look for first, sees that damning bit of evidence staring him\r\nin the face. They look casually at the shelf among other things\xe2\x80\x94examine\r\nthe logbook, say\xe2\x80\x94and he manages to push his own book out of sight. But\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t replace it when the interruption came. The action would\r\nhave attracted attention _then,_ and B\xc3\xb6hme made him leave the cabin in\r\nadvance, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, pausing in his toilet, \xe2\x80\x9cbut do\r\nthey guess how we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent the day? By Jove, Carruthers, that chart\r\nwith the square cut out; there it is on the rack!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must chance it, and bluff for all we\xe2\x80\x99re worth,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. The fact\r\nwas that Davies could not be brought to realise that he had done\r\nanything very remarkable that day; yet those fourteen sinuous miles\r\ntraversed blindfold, to say nothing of the return journey and my own\r\nexploits, made up an achievement audacious and improbable enough to\r\nout-distance suspicion. Nevertheless, von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s banter had been\r\ndisquieting, and if an inkling of our expedition had crossed his mind\r\nor theirs, there were ways of testing us which it would require all our\r\neffrontery to defeat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you looking for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. I was at the collar and stud\r\nstage, but had broken off to study the time-table which we had bought\r\nthat morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody insists on coming by the night train to somewhere, on the\r\n25th,\xe2\x80\x9d I reminded him. \xe2\x80\x9cB\xc3\xb6hme, von Br\xc3\xbcning, and Grimm are to meet the\r\nSomebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt a railway station! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where. They seemed to take it for\r\ngranted. But it must be somewhere on the sea, because B\xc3\xb6hme said, \xe2\x80\x98the\r\ntide serves.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be anywhere from Emden to Hamburg.\xe2\x80\x9d _[See Map B]_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there\xe2\x80\x99s a limit; it\xe2\x80\x99s probably somewhere near. Grimm was to come,\r\nand he\xe2\x80\x99s at Memmert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the map.... Emden and Norddeich are the only coast stations\r\ntill you get to Wilhelmshaven\xe2\x80\x94no, to Carolinensiel; but those are a\r\nlong way east.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Emden\xe2\x80\x99s a long way south. Say Norddeich then; but according to\r\nthis there\xe2\x80\x99s no train there after 6.15 p.m.; that\xe2\x80\x99s hardly \xe2\x80\x98night\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nWhen\xe2\x80\x99s high tide on the 25th?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see\xe2\x80\x948.30 here to-night\xe2\x80\x94Norddeich\xe2\x80\x99ll be the same. Somewhere\r\nbetween 10.30 and 11 on the 25th.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a train at Emden at 9.22 from Leer and the south, and one at\r\n10.50 from the north.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you counting on another fog?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, mockingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I want to know what our plans are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we wait till this cursed inspection\xe2\x80\x99s over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we can\xe2\x80\x99t; we should come to grief.\xe2\x80\x9d This was no barren truism, for\r\nI was ready with a plan of my own, though reluctant to broach it to\r\nDavies.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, ready or not, we had to start. The cabin we left as it was,\r\nchanging nothing and hiding nothing; the safest course to take, we\r\nthought, in spite of the risk of further search. But, as usual, I\r\ntransferred my diary to my breast-pocket, and made sure that the two\r\nofficial letters from England were safe in a compartment of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you propose?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, when we were in the dinghy again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a case of \xe2\x80\x98as you were\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day\xe2\x80\x99s trip was a\r\nchance we shall never get again. We must go back to last night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndecision\xe2\x80\x94tell them that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to stay on here for a bit.\r\nShooting, I suppose we shall have to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd courting?\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they know all about that. And then we must watch for a chance of\r\ntackling Dollmann privately. Not to-night, because we want time to\r\nconsider those clues of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Consider\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d I said: \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s putting it mildly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were at the ladder, and what a languid stiffness oppressed me I did\r\nnot know till I touched its freezing rungs, each one of which seared my\r\nsore palms like red-hot iron.\r\n\r\nThe overdue steamer was just arriving as we set foot on the quay. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyet, by Jove! why not to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Davies, beginning to stride up\r\nthe pier at a pace I could not imitate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady on,\xe2\x80\x9d I protested; \xe2\x80\x9cand, look here, I disagree altogether. I\r\nbelieve to-day has doubled our chances, but unless we alter our tactics\r\nit has doubled our risks. We\xe2\x80\x99ve involved ourselves in too tangled a\r\nweb. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like this inspection, and I fear that foxy old B\xc3\xb6hme who\r\nprompted it. The mere fact of their inviting us shows that we stand\r\nbadly; for it runs in the teeth of Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s warning at Bensersiel, and\r\nsmells uncommonly like arrest. There\xe2\x80\x99s a rift between Dollmann and the\r\nothers, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a ticklish matter to drive our wedge in; as to\r\n_to-night,_ hopeless; they\xe2\x80\x99re on the watch, and won\xe2\x80\x99t give us a chance.\r\nAnd after all, do we know enough? We don\xe2\x80\x99t know why he fled from\r\nEngland and turned German. It may have been an extraditable crime, but\r\nit may not. Supposing he defies us? There\xe2\x80\x99s the girl, you see\xe2\x80\x94she ties\r\nour hands, and if he once gets wind of that, and trades on our\r\nweakness, the game\xe2\x80\x99s up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you driving at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to detach him from Germany, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll probably go to any\r\nlengths rather than abandon his position here. His attempt on you is\r\nthe measure of his interest in it. Now, is to-day to be wasted?\xe2\x80\x9d We\r\nwere passing through the public gardens, and I dropped on to a seat for\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s rest, crackling dead leaves under me. Davies remained\r\nstanding, and pecked at the gravel with his toe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have got two valuable clues,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on; \xe2\x80\x9cthat rendezvous on the\r\n25th is one, and the name Esens is the other. We may consider them to\r\neternity; I vote we act on them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re under a searchlight here; and if we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncaught\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour plan\xe2\x80\x94ugh!\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s as risky as mine, and more so,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, rising\r\nwith a jerk, for a spasm of cramp took me. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must separate,\xe2\x80\x9d I added,\r\nas we walked on. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want, at one stroke, to prove to them that we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nharmless, and to get a fresh start. I go back to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo London!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. We were passing under an arc lamp, and, for\r\nthe dismay his face showed, I might have said Kamchatka.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, after all, it\xe2\x80\x99s where I ought to be at this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I forgot. And me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t get on without me, so you lay up the yacht here\xe2\x80\x94taking your\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter making inquiries about Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s past I double back as somebody\r\nelse, and follow up the clues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be quick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, abstractedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can just do it in time for the 25th.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you say \xe2\x80\x98making inquiries\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, looking straight\r\nbefore him, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean setting other people on his track?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s fair game!\xe2\x80\x9d I could not help saying; for there were moments when\r\nI chafed under this scrupulous fidelity to our self-denying ordinance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s our game, or nobody\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the secret,\xe2\x80\x9d I rejoined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s stick together,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall make a muck of it\r\nwithout you. And how are we to communicate\xe2\x80\x94meet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomehow\xe2\x80\x94that can wait. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a leap in the dark, but there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsafety in darkness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarruthers! what are we talking about? If they have the ghost of a\r\nnotion where we have been to-day, you give us away by packing off to\r\nLondon. They\xe2\x80\x99ll think we know their secret and are clearing out to make\r\nuse of it. _That_ means arrest, if you like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPessimist! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I written proof of good faith in my pocket\xe2\x80\x94official\r\nletters of recall, received to-day? It\xe2\x80\x99s one deception the less, you\r\nsee; for those letters _may_ have been opened; skilfully done it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpossible to detect. When in doubt, tell the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a rum thing how often it pays in this spying business,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDavies thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nWe had been tramping through deserted streets under the glare of\r\nelectricity, I with my leaden shuffle, he with the purposeful forward\r\nstoop and swinging arms that always marked his gait ashore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s it to be?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the Schwannall\xc3\xa9e.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I trust your judgement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe turned slowly down, running over a few last points where prior\r\nagreement was essential. As we stood at the very gate of the villa:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t commit yourself to dates,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9csay nothing that will\r\nprevent you from being here at least a week hence with the yacht still\r\nafloat.\xe2\x80\x9d And my final word, as we waited at the door for the bell to be\r\nanswered, was: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind what _I_ say. If things look queer we may\r\nhave to lighten the ship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLighten?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Davies; \xe2\x80\x9coh, I hope I shan\xe2\x80\x99t bosh it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I shan\xe2\x80\x99t get cramp,\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered between my teeth.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Davies had never been to the villa before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nFinesse\r\n\r\n\r\nThe door of a room on the ground floor was opened to us by a\r\nman-servant. As we entered the rattle of a piano stopped, and a hot\r\nwave of mingled scent and cigar-smoke struck my nostrils. The first\r\nthing I noticed over Davies\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, as he preceded me into the\r\nroom, was a woman\xe2\x80\x94the source of the perfume I decided\xe2\x80\x94turning round\r\nfrom the piano as he passed it and staring him up and down with a\r\ndisdainful familiarity that I at once hotly resented. She was in\r\nevening dress, pronounced in cut and colour; had a certain exuberant\r\nbeauty, not wholly ascribable to nature, and a notable lack of\r\nbreeding. Another glance showed me Dollmann putting down a liqueur\r\nglass of brandy, and rising from a low chair with something of a start;\r\nand another, von Br\xc3\xbcning, lying back in a corner of a sofa, smoking; on\r\nthe same sofa, _vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_ to him, was\xe2\x80\x94yes, of course it was\xe2\x80\x94Clara\r\nDollmann; but how their surroundings alter people, I caught myself\r\nthinking. For the rest, I was aware that the room was furnished with\r\nostentation, and was stuffy with stove-engendered warmth. Davies\r\nsteered a straight course for Dollmann, and shook his hand with\r\nbusinesslike resolution. Then he tacked across to the sofa, abandoning\r\nme in the face of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dollmann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarruthers,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, distinctly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was with Davies in the boat\r\njust now, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he introduced me. And now he has forgotten\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, dryly, turning towards Davies, who, having presented\r\nhimself to Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Dollmann, was looking feebly from her to von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning, the picture of tongue-tied awkwardness. (The Commander nodded\r\nto me and stretched himself with a yawn.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVon Br\xc3\xbcning told me about you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dollmann, ignoring my allusion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I was not quite sure of the name. No; it was not an occasion for\r\nformalities, was it?\xe2\x80\x9d He gave a sudden, mirthless laugh. I thought him\r\nflushed and excitable; yet, seen in a normal light, he was in some\r\nrespects a pleasant surprise, the remarkable conformation of the head\r\ngiving an impression of intellectual power and restless, almost\r\ninsanely restless, energy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat need?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard so much about you from Davies\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nCommander von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x94that we seem to be old friends already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shot a doubtful look at me, and a diversion came from the piano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the lady of the perfume, \xe2\x80\x9clet us\r\njoin Herr B\xc3\xb6hme at supper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me present you to my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dollmann.\r\n\r\nSo this was the stepmother; unmistakably German, I may add. I made my\r\nbow, and underwent much the same sort of frank scrutiny as Davies, only\r\nthat it was rather more favourable to me, and ended in a carmine smile.\r\n\r\nThere was a general movement and further introductions. Davies was led\r\nto the stepmother, and I found myself confronting the daughter with\r\nquickened pulses, and a sudden sense of added complexity in the issues.\r\nI had, of course, made up my mind to ignore our meeting of yesterday,\r\nand had assumed that she would do the same. And she did ignore it\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nmet as utter strangers; nor did I venture (for other eyes were upon us)\r\nto transmit any sign of intelligence to her. But the next moment I was\r\nwondering if I had not fallen into a trap. She had promised not to\r\ntell, but under what circumstances? I saw the scene again; the misty\r\nflats, the spruce little sail-boat and its sweet young mistress, fresh\r\nas a dewy flower, but blanched and demoralised by a horrid fear,\r\nappealing to my honour so to act that we three should never meet again,\r\npromising to be silent, but as much in her own interest as ours, and\r\nunder that implied condition which I had only equivocally refused. The\r\ncondition was violated, not by her fault or ours, but violated. She was\r\nfree to help her father against us, and was she helping him? What\r\ntroubled me was the change in her; that she\xe2\x80\x94how can I express it\r\nwithout offence?\xe2\x80\x94was less in discord with her surroundings than she\r\nshould have been; that in dress, pose and manner (as we exchanged some\r\ntrivialities) she was too near reflecting the style of the other woman;\r\nthat, in fact, she in some sort realised my original conception of her,\r\nso brutally avowed to Davies, so signally, as I had thought, falsified.\r\nIn the sick perplexity that this discovery caused me I dare say I\r\nlooked as foolish as Davies had done, and more so, for the close heat\r\nof the room and its tainted atmosphere, succeeding so abruptly to the\r\nwholesome nip of the outside air, were giving me a faintness which this\r\nmoral check lessened my power to combat. Von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x99s face wore a\r\nsneering smile that I winced under; and, turning, I found another pair\r\nof eyes fixed on me, those of Herr B\xc3\xb6hme, whose squat figure had\r\nappeared at a pair of folding doors leading to an adjoining room.\r\nNapkin in hand, he was taking in the scene before him with fat\r\nbenevolence, but exceeding shrewdness. I instantly noticed a faint red\r\nweal relieving the ivory of his bald head; and I had suffered too often\r\nin the same quarter myself to mistake its origin, namely, our cabin\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the other young explorer, B\xc3\xb6hme,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning. \xe2\x80\x9cHerr\r\nDavies kidnapped him a month ago, and bullied and starved him into\r\nsubmission; they\xe2\x80\x99ll drown together yet. I believe his sufferings have\r\nbeen terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis sufferings are over,\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve mutinied\xe2\x80\x94deserted\xe2\x80\x94haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI, Davies?\xe2\x80\x9d I caught Davies gazing with solemn _gaucherie_ at Miss\r\nDollmann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what?\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered. I explained in English. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, Carruthers\r\nhas to go home,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his vile lingo.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke for a moment, and even von Br\xc3\xbcning had no persiflage\r\nready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are we never going to have supper?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame impatiently; and\r\nwith that we all moved towards the folding doors. There had been little\r\nformality in the proceedings so far, and there was less still in the\r\nsupper-room. B\xc3\xb6hme resumed his repast with appetite, and the rest of us\r\nsat down apparently at random, though an underlying method was\r\ndiscernible. As it worked out, Dollmann was at one end of the small\r\ntable, with Davies on his right and B\xc3\xb6hme on his left; Frau Dollmann at\r\nthe other, with me on her right and von Br\xc3\xbcning on her left. The\r\nseventh personage, Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Dollmann, was between the Commander and\r\nDavies on the side opposite to me. No servants appeared, and we waited\r\non ourselves. I have a vague recollection of various excellent dishes,\r\nand a distinct one of abundance of wine. Someone filled me a glass of\r\nchampagne, and I confess that I drained it with honest avidity,\r\nblessing the craftsman who coaxed forth the essence, the fruit that\r\nharboured it, the sun that warmed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you going so suddenly?\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning to me across the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you we had to call here for letters? I got mine this\r\nmorning, and among others a summons back to work. Of course I must\r\nobey.\xe2\x80\x9d (I found myself speaking in a frigid silence.) \xe2\x80\x9cThe annoying\r\nthing was that there were two letters, and if I had only come here two\r\ndays sooner I should have only got the first, which gave me an\r\nextension.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very conscientious. How will they know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but the second\xe2\x80\x99s rather urgent.\xe2\x80\x9d There was another uncomfortable\r\nsilence, broken by Dollmann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, Herr Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to apologise to you\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was no business of mine, and the less interest I took in it the\r\nbetter; so I turned to Frau Dollmann and abused the fog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been in the harbour all day?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthen how was it you\r\ndid not visit us? Was Herr Davies so shy?\xe2\x80\x9d (Curiosity or malice?)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite the contrary; but I was,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered coldly; \xe2\x80\x9cyou see, we knew\r\nHerr Dollmann was away, and we really only called here to get my\r\nletters; besides, we did not know your address.\xe2\x80\x9d I looked at Clara and\r\nfound her talking gaily to von Br\xc3\xbcning, deaf seemingly to our little\r\ndialogue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyone would have told you it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame, raising her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say; but directly after breakfast the fog came on, and\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\none cannot leave a yacht alone in a fog,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, with professional\r\nsolidity.\r\n\r\nVon Br\xc3\xbcning pricked up his ears at this. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be hanged if that was\r\n_your_ maxim,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re too fond of the shore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sent him a glance of protest, as though to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of\r\nyour warning if you won\xe2\x80\x99t let me act on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor, of course, my excuses were meant chiefly for his consumption, and\r\nFr\xc3\xa4ulein Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s. That the lady I addressed them to found them\r\nunpalatable was not my fault.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you sat in your wretched little cabin all day?\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll day,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, brazenly; \xe2\x80\x9cit was the safest thing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d And I\r\nlooked again at Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Dollmann, frankly and squarely. Our eyes met,\r\nand she dropped hers instantly, but not before I had learnt something;\r\nfor if ever I saw misery under a mask it was on her face. No; she had\r\nnot told.\r\n\r\nI think I puzzled the stepmother, who shrugged her white shoulders, and\r\nsaid in that case she wondered we had dared to leave our precious boat\r\nand come to supper. If we knew Frisian fogs as well as she did\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nOh, I explained, we were not so nervous as that; and as for supper on\r\nshore, if she only knew what a Spartan life we led\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me about it!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with a\r\ngrimace; \xe2\x80\x9cI hate the mention of yachts. When I think of that dreadful\r\n_Medusa_ coming from Hamburg\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I sympathised with half my attention,\r\nkeeping one strained ear open for developments on my right. Davies, I\r\nknew, was in the thick of it, and none too happy under B\xc3\xb6hme\xe2\x80\x99s eye, but\r\nworking manfully. \xe2\x80\x9cMy fault\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csudden squall\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cquite safe\xe2\x80\x9d, were some of\r\nthe phrases I caught; while I was aware, to my alarm, that he was\r\nactually drawing a diagram of something with bread-crumbs and\r\ntable-knives. The subject seemed to gutter out to an awkward end, and\r\nsuddenly B\xc3\xb6hme, who was my right-hand neighbour, turned to me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nstarting for England to-morrow morning?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a steamer at 8.15, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is good. We shall be companions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to England, too, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, with hot misgivings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! I am going to Bremen; but we shall travel together as far\r\nas\xe2\x80\x94you go by Amsterdam, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x94as far as Leer, then. That will be\r\nvery pleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d I fancied there was a ghoulish gusto in his tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery,\xe2\x80\x9d I assented. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are making a short stay here, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as usual. I visit the work at Memmert once a month or so,\r\nspend a night with my friend Dollmann and his charming family\xe2\x80\x9d (he\r\nleered round him), \xe2\x80\x9cand return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether I was right or wrong in my next step I shall never know, but\r\nobeying a strong instinct, \xe2\x80\x9cMemmert,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cdo tell me more about\r\nMemmert. We heard a good deal about it from Commander von Br\xc3\xbcning;\r\nbut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was discreet, I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d said B\xc3\xb6hme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe left off at the most interesting part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that about me?\xe2\x80\x9d joined in von Br\xc3\xbcning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re dying to know more about Memmert, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we,\r\nDavies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, evidently aghast at my temerity; but I\r\ndid not mind that. If he roughed my suit, so much the better; I\r\nintended to rough his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave us plenty of history, Commander, but you did not bring it up\r\nto date.\xe2\x80\x9d The triple alliance laughed, Dollmann boisterously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning; \xe2\x80\x9cI gave you very good reasons, and you\r\nacquiesced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now he is trying to pump _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d said B\xc3\xb6hme, with his rasping\r\nchuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, sir; I have an excuse. The Commander was not only\r\nmysterious but inaccurate. I appeal to you, Herr Dollmann, for it was\r\n_\xc3\xa0 propos_ of you. When we fell in with him at Bensersiel, Davies asked\r\nhim if you were at home, and he said \xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99 When would you be back?\r\nProbably soon; _but he did not know when_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he said that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dollmann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, only three days later we arrive at Norderney, and find you have\r\nreturned that very day, but have gone to Memmert. Again (by the way)\r\nthe mysterious Memmert! But more than ever mysterious now, for in the\r\nevening, not only you and Herr B\xc3\xb6hme\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat penetration!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed von Br\xc3\xbcning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut also Commander von Br\xc3\xbcning, pay us a visit in _his_ launch, all\r\ncoming from Memmert!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you infer?\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that you must have known at Bensersiel\xe2\x80\x94only three days\r\nago\xe2\x80\x94exactly when Herr Dollmann was coming back, having an appointment\r\nat Memmert with him for to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I wished to conceal from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m so inquisitive; it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely your own fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it seems,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with mock humility; \xe2\x80\x9cbut fill your glass and go\r\non, young man. Why should I want to deceive you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I want to know. Come, confess now; wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there\r\nsomething important afoot to-day at Memmert? Something to do with the\r\ngold? You were inspecting it, sorting it, weighing it? Or _I_ know! You\r\nwere transporting it secretly to the mainland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a very good day for that! But softly, Herr Carruthers; no fishing\r\nfor admissions. Who said we had found any gold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you? There!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s better! Nothing like candour, my young investigator. But I am\r\nafraid, having no authority, I cannot assist you at all. Better try\r\nHerr B\xc3\xb6hme again. I\xe2\x80\x99m only a casual onlooker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith shares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you remember that? (He remembers everything!) With a few shares,\r\nthen; but with no expert knowledge. Now, B\xc3\xb6hme is the consulting\r\nengineer. Rescue me, B\xc3\xb6hme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot disclaim expert knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d said B\xc3\xb6hme, with humorous\r\ngravity; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I disclaim responsibility. Now, Herr Dollmann is chairman\r\nof the company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dollmann, with a noisy laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cmust fall back on the\r\nshareholders, whose interests I have to guard. One can\xe2\x80\x99t be too careful\r\nin these confidential matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s one who gives his consent,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t he represent the\r\nrest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExtorted by torture,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning. \xe2\x80\x9cI retract.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind them, Herr Carruthers,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Frau Dollmann, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are\r\nmaking fun of you; but I will give you a hint; no woman can keep a\r\nsecret\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, triumphantly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Not I; I detest the sea! But Clara has.\xe2\x80\x9d Everyone looked at Clara,\r\nwho in her turn looked in na\xc3\xafve bewilderment from me to her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, more soberly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut perhaps she is not a free agent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly free!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dollmann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only been there once, some time ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand I saw no\r\ngold at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuarded,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon; I mean that perhaps you only\r\nsaw what you were allowed to see. And, in any case, the Fr\xc3\xa4ulein has no\r\nexpert knowledge and no responsibility, and, perhaps, no shares. Her\r\nprovince is to be charming, not to hold financial secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done my best to help you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stepmother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all against us, Davies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, chuck it, Carruthers!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, in English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s insatiable,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning, and there was a pause; clearly,\r\nthey meant to elicit more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall draw my own conclusions,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning, \xe2\x80\x9cin what sense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt begins to dawn on me that you made fools of us at Bensersiel. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou remember, Davies, what an interest he took in all our doings? I\r\nwonder if he feared our exploring propensities might possibly lead us\r\nto Memmert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, this is the blackest ingratitude. I thought I made\r\nmyself particularly agreeable to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed; especially about the duck-shooting! How useful your local\r\nman would have been\xe2\x80\x94both to us and to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Commander, imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment; I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking it out.\xe2\x80\x9d And thinking it out I was in\r\ndeadly earnest, for all my levity, as I pressed my hand on my burning\r\nforehead and asked myself where I was to stop in this seductive but\r\nperilous fraud. To carry it too far was to court complete exposure; to\r\nstop too soon was equally compromising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he talking about, and why go on with this ridiculous mystery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Frau Dollmann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking about this supper party, and the way it came about,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\npursued, slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to complain of, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dollmann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not! Impromptu parties are always the pleasantest, and this\r\none was delightfully impromptu. Now I bet you I know its origin! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou discuss us at Memmert? And didn\xe2\x80\x99t one of you suggest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would almost think you had been there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dollmann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may thank your vile climate that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted,\r\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, as I was saying, didn\xe2\x80\x99t one of you suggest\xe2\x80\x94which of\r\nyou? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the Commander\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d said B\xc3\xb6hme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to explain\xe2\x80\x94an intuition, say\xe2\x80\x94I am sure he stood up for\r\nus; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was Herr Dollmann, because he knows Davies\r\nalready, and he\xe2\x80\x99s always on the spot; and, in short I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear it was\r\nHerr B\xc3\xb6hme, who is leaving early to-morrow, and had never seen either\r\nof us. It was you, sir, who proposed that we should be asked to supper\r\nto-night\xe2\x80\x94for inspection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInspection?\xe2\x80\x9d said B\xc3\xb6hme; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat an extraordinary idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, though! And one thing more; in the harbour just\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94this is going too far; I shall mortally offend you.\xe2\x80\x9d I gave way\r\nto hearty laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, let\xe2\x80\x99s have it. Your hallucinations are diverting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you insist; but this is rather a delicate matter. You know we were\r\na little surprised to find you _all_ on board; and you, Herr B\xc3\xb6hme, did\r\nyou always take such a deep interest in small yachts? I am afraid that\r\nit was at a certain sacrifice of comfort that you _inspected_ ours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd I glanced at the token he bore of his encounter with our lintel.\r\nThere was a burst of pent-up merriment, in which Dollmann took the\r\nloudest share.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warned you, B\xc3\xb6hme,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe engineer took the joke in the best possible part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe owe you apologies,\xe2\x80\x9d he conceded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_He_ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the injured one. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you never\r\nsuspected Davies, who could?\xe2\x80\x9d (Who indeed? I was on firm ground there.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe point is, what did you take _me_ for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we take you for it still,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho! Still suspicious? Don\xe2\x80\x99t drive me to extremities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat extremities?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I get back to London I shall go to Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten\r\nthat flaw in the title.\xe2\x80\x9d There was an impressive silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dollmann, with exaggerated solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must come\r\nto terms with this formidable young man. What do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me to Memmert,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThose are my terms!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake you to Memmert? But I thought you were starting for England\r\nto-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said it was urgent. Your conscience is very elastic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my affair. Will you take me to Memmert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d B\xc3\xb6hme nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we owe some\r\nreparation. Under promise of absolute secrecy, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, now that you trust me. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll show me everything\xe2\x80\x94honour\r\nbright\xe2\x80\x94wreck, dep\xc3\xb4t, and all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything; if you don\xe2\x80\x99t object to a diver\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVictory!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, in triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve won our point, Davies. And now,\r\ngentlemen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind saying that as far as I am concerned the joke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nat an end; and, in spite of your kind offer, I must start for England\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x9d under the good Herr B\xc3\xb6hme\xe2\x80\x99s wing. And in case my elastic\r\nconscience troubles you (for I see you think me a weather-cock) here\r\nare the letters received this morning, establishing my identity as a\r\nhumble but respectable clerk in the British Civil Service, summoned\r\naway from his holiday by a tyrannical superior.\xe2\x80\x9d (I pulled out my\r\nletters and tossed them to Dollmann.) \xe2\x80\x9cAh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t read English\r\neasily, perhaps? I dare say Herr B\xc3\xb6hme does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeaving B\xc3\xb6hme to study dates, postmarks, and contents to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontent, and unobserved, I turned to sympathise with my fair neighbour,\r\nwho complained that her head was going round; and no wonder. But at\r\nthis juncture, and very much to my surprise, Davies struck in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ should like to go to Memmert,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised at that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you won\xe2\x80\x99t be staying here either, Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d I objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I told you I should. If you leave me\r\nin the lurch like this I must have time to look round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend that you cannot sail alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said von Br\xc3\xbcning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s much more fun with two; I think I shall wire for another friend.\r\nMeanwhile, I should like to see Memmert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s only an excuse, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to shoot ducks too,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Davies, reddening. \xe2\x80\x9cI always have\r\nwanted to; and you promised to help in that, Commander.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of it now,\xe2\x80\x9d I laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, unmoved; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, honestly, I should advise Herr\r\nDavies, if he is ever going to get home this season, to make the best\r\nof this fine weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies; \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer wind. If I cannot get a friend\r\nI think I shall stop cruising, leave the yacht here, and come back for\r\nher next year.\r\n\r\nThere was some mute telegraphy between the allies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can leave her in my charge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dollmann, \xe2\x80\x9cand start with your\r\nfriend to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks; but there is no hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, growing redder than ever.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like Norderney\xe2\x80\x94and we might have another sail in your dinghy,\r\nFr\xc3\xa4ulein,\xe2\x80\x9d he blurted out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in that low dry voice I had heard yesterday;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I think I shall not be sailing again\xe2\x80\x94it is getting too cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s splendid.\xe2\x80\x9d But she had turned to von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning, and took no notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, send me a report about Memmert, Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d I laughed, with the\r\nidea of drawing attention from his rebuff. But Davies, having once\r\ndelivered his soul, seemed to have lost his shyness, and only gazed at\r\nhis neighbour with the placid, dogged expression that I knew so well.\r\nThat was the end of those delicate topics; and conviviality grew apace.\r\n\r\nI am not indifferent at any time to good wine and good cheer, nor was\r\nit for lack of pressing that I drank as sparingly as I was able, and\r\npretended to a greater elation than I felt. Nor certainly was it from\r\nany fine scruples as to the character of the gentleman whose\r\nhospitality we were receiving\xe2\x80\x94scruples which I knew affected Davies,\r\nwho ate little and drank nothing. In any case he was adamant in such\r\nmatters, and I verily believe would at any time have preferred our own\r\nlittle paraffin-flavoured messes to the best dinner in the world. It\r\nwas a very wholesome caution that warned me not to abuse the finest\r\nbrain tonic ever invented by the wit of man. I had finessed Memmert, as\r\none finesses a low card when holding a higher; but I had too much\r\nrespect for our adversaries to trade on any fancied security we had won\r\nthereby. They had allowed me to win the trick, but I credited them with\r\na better knowledge of my hand than they chose to show. On the other\r\nhand I hugged the axiom that in all conflicts it is just as fatal to\r\nunderrate the difficulties of your enemy as to overrate your own. Their\r\nchief one\xe2\x80\x94and it multiplied a thousandfold the excitement of the\r\ncontest\xe2\x80\x94was, I felt sure, the fear of striking in error; of using a\r\nsledge-hammer to break a nut. In breaking it they risked publicity, and\r\npublicity, I felt convinced, was death to their secret. So, even\r\nsupposing they had detected the finesse, and guessed that we had in\r\nfact got wind of imperial designs; yet, even so, I counted on immunity\r\nso long as they thought we were on the wrong scent, with Memmert, and\r\nMemmert alone, as the source of our suspicions.\r\n\r\nHad it been necessary I was prepared to encourage such a view,\r\nadmitting that the cloth von Br\xc3\xbcning wore had made his connexion with\r\nMemmert curious, and had suggested to Davies, for I should have put it\r\non him, with his naval enthusiasms, that the wreck-works were really\r\nnaval-defence works. If they went farther, and suspected that we had\r\ntried to go to Memmert that very day, the position was worse, but not\r\ndesperate; for the fear that they would take the final step and suppose\r\nthat we had actually got there and overheard their talk, I flatly\r\nrefused to entertain, until I should find myself under arrest.\r\n\r\nPrecisely how near we came to it I shall never rightly know; but I have\r\ngood reason to believe that we trembled on the verge. The main issue\r\nwas fully enough for me, and it was only in passing flashes that I\r\nfollowed the play of the warring under-currents. And yet, looking back\r\non the scene, I would warrant there was no party of seven in Europe\r\nthat evening where a student of human documents would have found so\r\nrich a field, such noble and ignoble ambitions, such base and holy\r\nfears, aye, and such pitiful agonies of the spirit. Roughly divided\r\nthough we were into separate camps, no two of us were wholly at one.\r\nEach wore a mask in the grand imposture; excepting, I am inclined to\r\nthink, the lady on my left, who, outside her own well-being, which she\r\ncultivated without reserve, had, as far as I could see, but one axe to\r\ngrind\xe2\x80\x94the intimacy of von Br\xc3\xbcning and her stepdaughter\xe2\x80\x94and ground it\r\nopenly.\r\n\r\nNot even B\xc3\xb6hme and von Br\xc3\xbcning were wholly at one; and as moral\r\ndistances are reckoned, Davies and I were leagues apart. Sitting\r\nbetween Dollmann and Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, the living and breathing\r\nsymbols of the two polar passions he had sworn to harmonise, he kept an\r\nequilibrium which, though his aims were nominally mine, I could not\r\nattain to. For me the man was the central figure; if I had attention to\r\nspare it was on him that I bestowed it; groping disgustfully after his\r\nhidden springs of action, noting the evidences of great gifts\r\nsquandered and prostituted; questioning where he was most vulnerable;\r\nwhom he feared most, us or his colleagues; whether he was open to\r\nremorse or shame; or whether he meditated further crime. The girl was\r\nincidental. After the first shock of surprise I had soon enough\r\ndiscovered that she, like the rest, had assumed a disguise; for she was\r\nfar too innocent to sustain the deception; and yesterday was fresh in\r\nmy memory. I was forced to continue turning her assumed character to\r\naccount; but it would be pharisaical in me to say that I rose to any\r\nmoral heights in her regard\xe2\x80\x94wine and excitement had deadened my better\r\nnature to that extent. I thought she looked prettier than ever, and, as\r\ntime passed, I fell into a cynical carelessness about her. This glimpse\r\nof her home life, and the desperate expedients to which she was driven\r\n(whether by compulsion or from her own regard for Davies) to repel and\r\ndismiss him, did not strike me as they might have done as the crowning\r\nargument in favour of the course we had adopted the night before, that\r\nof compassing our end without noise and scandal, disarming Dollmann,\r\nbut aiding him to escape from the allies he had betrayed. To Davies,\r\nthe man, if not a pure abstraction, was at most a noxious vermin to be\r\ntrampled on for the public good; while the girl, in her blackguardly\r\nsurroundings, and with her sinister future, had become the very source\r\nof his impulse.\r\n\r\nAnd the other players? B\xc3\xb6hme was _my_ abstraction, the fortress whose\r\nfoundations we were sapping, the embodiment of that systematised force\r\nwhich is congenital to the German people. In von Br\xc3\xbcning, the personal\r\nfactor was uppermost. Callous as I was this evening, I could not help\r\nwondering occasionally, as he talked and laughed with Clara Dollmann,\r\nwhat in his innermost thoughts, knowing her father, he felt and meant.\r\nIt is a point I cannot and would not pursue, and, thank Heaven, it does\r\nnot matter now; yet, with fuller knowledge of the facts, and, I trust,\r\na mellower judgement, I often return to the same debate, and, by I know\r\nnot what illogical bypaths, always arrive at the same conclusion, that\r\nI liked the man and like him still.\r\n\r\nWe behaved as sportsmen in the matter of time, giving them over two\r\nhours to make up their minds about us. It was only when tobacco-smoke\r\nand heat brought back my faintness, and a twinge of cramp warned me\r\nthat human strength has limits, that I rose and said we must go; that I\r\nhad to make an early start to-morrow. I am hazy about the farewells,\r\nbut I think that Dollmann was the most cordial, to me at any rate, and\r\nI augured good therefrom. B\xc3\xb6hme said he should see me again. Von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning, though bound for the harbour also, considered it was far too\r\nearly to be going yet, and said good-bye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to talk us over,\xe2\x80\x9d I remember saying, with the last flicker of\r\ngaiety I could muster.\r\n\r\nWe were in the streets again, under a silver, breathless night; dizzily\r\nfooting the greasy ladder again; in the cabin again, where I collapsed\r\non a sofa just as I was, and slept such a deep and stringent sleep that\r\nthe men of the _Blitz_\xe2\x80\x99s launch might have handcuffed and trussed and\r\ncarried me away, without incommoding me in the least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nI Double Back\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d called Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d the whistle blew and the ferry-steamer forged ahead,\r\nleaving Davies on the quay, bareheaded and wearing his old Norfolk\r\njacket and stained grey flannels, as at our first meeting in Flensburg\r\nstation. There was no bandaged hand this time, but he looked pinched\r\nand depressed; his eyes had black circles round them; and again I felt\r\nthat same indefinable pathos in him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend is in low spirits,\xe2\x80\x9d said B\xc3\xb6hme, who was installed on a\r\nseat beside me, voluminously caped and rugged against the biting air.\r\nIt was a still, sunless day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d I grunted, and it was the literal truth. I was only half\r\nawake, felt unwashed and dissipated, heavy in head and limbs. But for\r\nDavies I should never have been where I was. It was he who had\r\npatiently coaxed me out of my bunk, packed my bag, fed me with tea and\r\nan omelette (to which I believe he had devoted peculiarly tender care),\r\nand generally mothered me for departure. While I swallowed my second\r\ncup he was brushing the mould and smoothing the dents from my felt hat,\r\nwhich had been entombed for a month in the sail-locker; working at it\r\nwith a remorseful concern in his face. The only initiative I am\r\nconscious of having shown was in the matter of my bag. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in my sea\r\nclothes, oils, and all,\xe2\x80\x9d I had said; \xe2\x80\x9cI may want them again.\xe2\x80\x9d There was\r\nmortal need of a thorough consultation, but this was out of the\r\nquestion. Davies did not badger or complain, but only timidly asked me\r\nhow we were to meet and communicate, a question on which my mind was an\r\nabsolute blank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out for me about the 26th,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested feebly.\r\n\r\nBefore we left the cabin he gave me a scrap of pencilled paper and saw\r\nthat it went safely into my pocket-book. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at it in the train,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nUnable to cope with B\xc3\xb6hme, I paced the deck aimlessly as we swung round\r\nthe See Gat into the Buse Tief, trying to identify the point where we\r\ncrossed it yesterday blindfold. But the tide was full, and the waters\r\nblank for miles round till they merged in haze. Soon I drifted down\r\ninto the saloon, and crouching over a stove pulled out that scrap of\r\npaper. In a crabbed, boyish hand, and much besmudged with\r\ntobacco-ashes, I found the following notes:\r\n\r\n(1) _Your journey_. [See Maps A and B.] Norddeich 8.58, Emden 10.32,\r\nLeer 11.16 (B\xc3\xb6hme changes for Bremen), Rheine 1.8 (change), Amsterdam\r\n7.17 p.m. Leave again _via_ Hook 8.52, London 9 am.\r\n\r\n(2) The coast-station\xe2\x80\x94_their_ rondezvous\xe2\x80\x94querry is it _Norden_? (You\r\npass it 9.13)\xe2\x80\x94there is a tidal creek up to it. High-water there on\r\n25th, say 10.30 to 11 p.m. It cannot be Norddeich, which I find has a\r\ndredged-out low-water channel for the steamer, so tide \xe2\x80\x9cserves\xe2\x80\x9d would\r\nnot apply.\r\n\r\n(3) _Your other clews_ (tugs, pilots, depths, railway, Esens, seven of\r\nsomething). Querry: Scheme of defence by land and sea for North Sea\r\nCoast?\r\n\r\n_Sea_\xe2\x80\x947 islands, 7 channels between (counting West Ems), very small\r\ndepths (what you said) in most of them. Tugs and pilots for patrol work\r\nbehind islands, as I always said. Querry: Rondezvous is for inspecting\r\nchannels?\r\n\r\n_Land_\xe2\x80\x94Look at railway (map in ulster pocket) running in a loop all\r\nround Friesland, a few miles from coast. Querry: To be used as line of\r\ncommunication for army corps. Troops could be quickly sent to any\r\nthreatened point. _Esens_ the base? It is in top centre of loop. Von\r\nBrooning dished us fairly over that at Bensersiel.\r\n\r\n_Chatham_\xe2\x80\x94D. was spying after our naval plans for war with Germany.\r\n\r\nVon Brooning runs naval part over here.\r\n\r\nWhere does Burmer come in? Querry\xe2\x80\x94you go to Bremen and find out about\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nI nodded stupidly over this document\xe2\x80\x94so stupidly that I found myself\r\nwondering whether Burmer was a place or a person. Then I dozed, to wake\r\nwith a violent start and find the paper on the floor. Panic-stricken, I\r\nhid it away, and went on deck, when I found we were close to Norddeich,\r\nrunning up to the bleakest of bleak jetties thrown out from the\r\ndyke-bound polders of the mainland. B\xc3\xb6hme and I landed together, and he\r\nwas at my elbow as I asked for a ticket for Amsterdam, and was given\r\none as far as Rheine, a junction near the Dutch frontier. He was\r\nensconced in an opposite corner to me in the railway carriage, looking\r\nlike an Indian idol. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come in?\xe2\x80\x9d I pondered, dreamily. Too\r\nsleepy to talk, I could only blink at him, sitting bolt upright with my\r\narms folded over my precious pocket-book. Finally, I gave up the\r\nstruggle, buttoned my ulster tightly up, and turning my back upon him\r\nwith an apology, lay down to sleep, the precious pocket nethermost. He\r\nwas at liberty to rifle my bag if he chose, and I dare say he did. I\r\ncannot say, for from this point till Rheine, for the best part of four\r\nhours, that is, I had only two lucid intervals.\r\n\r\nThe first was at Emden, where we both had to change. Here, as we pushed\r\nour way down the crowded platform, B\xc3\xb6hme, after being greeted\r\nrespectfully by several persons, was at last buttonholed without means\r\nof escape by an obsequious gentleman, whose description is of no\r\nmoment, but whose conversation is. It was about a canal; what canal I\r\ndid not gather, though, from a name dropped, I afterwards identified it\r\nas one in course of construction as a feeder to the Ems. The point is\r\nthat the subject was canals. At the moment it was seed dropped in\r\nunreceptive soil, but it germinated later. I passed on, mingling with\r\nthe crowd, and was soon asleep again in another carriage where B\xc3\xb6hme\r\nthis time did not follow me.\r\n\r\nThe second occasion was at Leer, where I heard myself called by name,\r\nand woke to find him at the window. He had to change trains, and had\r\ncome to say good-bye. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget to go to Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d he grated in my\r\near. I expect it was a wan smile that I returned, for I was at a very\r\nlow ebb, and my fortress looked sarcastically impregnable. But the\r\nsapper was free; \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d was my last conscious thought.\r\n\r\nEven after Rheine, where I changed for the last time, a brutish\r\ndrowsiness enchained me, and the afternoon was well advanced before my\r\nfaculties began to revive.\r\n\r\nThe train crept like a snail from station to station. I might, so a\r\nfellow-passenger told me, have waited three hours at Rheine for an\r\nexpress which would have brought me to Amsterdam at about the same\r\ntime; or, if I had chosen to break the journey farther back, two hours\r\nat either Emden or Leer would still have enabled me to catch the said\r\nexpress at Rheine. These alternatives had escaped Davies, and, I\r\nsurmised, had been suppressed by B\xc3\xb6hme, who doubtless did not want me\r\nbehind him, free either to double back or to follow him to Bremen.\r\n\r\nThe pace, then, was execrable, and there were delays; we were behind\r\ntime at Hengelo, thirty minutes late at Apeldoorn; so that I might well\r\nhave grown nervous about my connexions at Amsterdam, which were in some\r\njeopardy. But as I battled out of my lethargy and began to take account\r\nof our position and prospects, quite a different thought at the outset\r\naffected me. Anxiety to reach London was swamped in reluctance to quit\r\nGermany, so that I found myself grudging every mile that I placed\r\nbetween me and the frontier. It was the old question of urgency. To-day\r\nwas the 23rd. The visit to London meant a minimum absence of\r\nforty-eight hours, counting from Amsterdam; that is to say, that by\r\ntravelling for two nights and one day, and devoting the other day to\r\ninvestigating Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s past, it was humanly possible for me to be\r\nback on the Frisian coast on the evening of the 25th. Yes, I could be\r\nat Norden, if that was the \xe2\x80\x9crendezvous\xe2\x80\x9d, at 7 p.m. But what a scramble!\r\nNo margin for delays, no physical respite. Some pasts take a deal of\r\nraking up\xe2\x80\x94other persons may be affected; men are cautious, they trip\r\nyou up with red tape; or the man who knows is out at lunch\xe2\x80\x94a protracted\r\nlunch; or in the country\xe2\x80\x94a protracted week-end. Will you see Mr\r\nSo-and-so, or leave a note? Oh! I know those public departments\xe2\x80\x94from\r\nthe inside! And the Admiralty!... I saw myself baffled and racing back\r\nthe same night to Germany, with two days wasted, arriving, good for\r\nnothing, at Norden, with no leisure to reconnoitre my ground; to be\r\nbaffled again there, probably, for you cannot always count on fogs (as\r\nDavies said). Esens was another clue, and \xe2\x80\x9cto follow Burmer\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94there was\r\nsomething in that notion. But I wanted time, and had I time? How long\r\ncould Davies maintain himself at Norderney? Not so very long, from what\r\nI remembered of last night. And was he even safe there? A feverish\r\ndream recurred to me\xe2\x80\x94a dream of Davies in a diving-dress; of a\r\nregrettable hitch in the air-supply\xe2\x80\x94Stop, that was nonsense!... Let us\r\nbe sane. What matter if he had to go? What matter if I took my time in\r\nLondon? Then with a flood of shame I saw Davies\xe2\x80\x99s wistful face on the\r\nquay, heard his grim ejaculation: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s our game or no one\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d; and my\r\nown sullen \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the secret!\xe2\x80\x9d London was utterly impossible.\r\nIf I found my informant, what credentials had I, what claim to\r\nconfidences? None, unless I told the whole story. Why, my mere presence\r\nin Whitehall would imperil the secret; for, once on my native heath, I\r\nshould be recognised\xe2\x80\x94possibly haled to judgement; at the best should\r\nescape in a cloud of rumour\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clast heard of at Norderney\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9conly this\r\nmorning was raising Cain at the Admiralty about a mythical lieutenant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nNo! Back to Friesland, was the word. One night\xe2\x80\x99s rest\xe2\x80\x94I must have\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94between sheets, on a feather bed; one long, luxurious night, and\r\nthen back refreshed to Friesland, to finish our work in our own way,\r\nand with none but our own weapons.\r\n\r\nHaving reached this resolve, I was nearly putting it into instant\r\nexecution, by alighting at Amersfoort, but thought better of it. I had\r\na transformation to effect before I returned north, and the more\r\npopulous centre I made it in the less it was likely to attract notice.\r\nBesides, I had in my mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye a perfect bed in a perfect hostelry\r\nhard by the Amstel River. It was an economy in the end.\r\n\r\nSo, at half-past eight I was sipping my coffee in the aforesaid\r\nhostelry, with a London newspaper before me, which was unusually\r\ninteresting, and some German journals, which, \xe2\x80\x9cin hate of a wrong not\r\ntheirs\xe2\x80\x9d, were one and all seething with rancorous Anglophobia. At nine\r\nI was in the Jewish quarter, striking bargains in an infamous marine\r\nslop-shop. At half-past nine I was despatching this unscrupulous\r\ntelegram to my chief\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cVery sorry, could not call Norderney; hope\r\nextension all right; please write to H\xc3\xb4tel du Louvre, Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d At ten I\r\nwas in the perfect bed, rapturously flinging my limbs abroad in its\r\nglorious redundancies. And at 8.28 on the following morning, with a\r\nnovel chilliness about the upper lip, and a vast excess of strength and\r\nspirits, I was sitting in a third-class carriage, bound for Germany,\r\nand dressed as a young seaman, in a pea-jacket, peaked cap, and\r\ncomforter.\r\n\r\nThe transition had not been difficult. I had shaved off my moustache\r\nand breakfasted hastily in my bedroom, ready equipped for a journey in\r\nmy ulster and cloth cap. I had dismissed the hotel porter at the\r\nstation, and left my bag at the cloak-room, after taking out of it an\r\number bundle and substituting the ulster. The umber bundle, which\r\nconsisted of my oilskins, and within them my sea-boots and a few other\r\ngarments and necessaries, the whole tied up with a length of tarry\r\nrope, was now in the rack above me, and (with a stout stick)\r\nrepresented my luggage. Every article in it\xe2\x80\x94I shudder at their\r\norigin\xe2\x80\x94was in strict keeping with my humble _m\xc3\xa9tier,_ for I knew they\r\nwere liable to search at the frontier Custom-house; but there was a\r\nBaedeker of Northern Germany in my jacket pocket.\r\n\r\nFor the nonce, if questions were asked, I was an English seaman, going\r\nto Emden to join a ship, with a ticket as far as the frontier. Beyond\r\nthat a definite scheme of action had still to be thought out. One\r\nthing, however, was sure. I was determined to be at Norden to-morrow\r\nnight, the 25th. A word about Norden, which is a small town seven miles\r\nsouth of Norddeich. When hurriedly scanning the map for coast stations\r\nin the cabin yesterday, I had not thought of Norden, because it did not\r\nappear to be on the coast, but Davies had noticed it while I slept, and\r\nI now saw that his pencilled hint was a shrewd one. The creek he spoke\r\nof, though barely visible on the map, _[See Map B]_ flowed into the Ems\r\nEstuary in a south-westerly direction. The \xe2\x80\x9cnight train\xe2\x80\x9d tallied to\r\nperfection, for high tide in the creek would be, as Davies estimated,\r\nbetween 10.30 and 11 p.m. on the night of the 25th; and the time-table\r\nshowed that the only night train arriving at Norden was one from the\r\nsouth at 10.46 p.m. This looked promising. Emden, which I had inclined\r\nto on the spur of the moment, was out of court in comparison, for many\r\nreasons; not the least being that it was served by three trains between\r\n9 p.m. and 1 a.m., so that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnight train\xe2\x80\x9d would be ambiguous\r\nand not decisive as with Norden.\r\n\r\nSo far good; but how was I to spend the intervening time? Should I act\r\non Davies\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cquerry\xe2\x80\x9d and go to Bremen after B\xc3\xb6hme? I soon dismissed\r\nthat idea. It was one to act upon if others failed; for the present it\r\nmeant another scramble. Bremen is six hours from Norden by rail. I\r\nshould spend a disproportionate amount of my limited time in trains,\r\nand I should want a different disguise. Besides, I had already learnt\r\nsomething fresh about B\xc3\xb6hme; for the seed dropped at Emden Station\r\nyesterday had come to life. A submarine engineer I knew him to be\r\nbefore; I now knew that canals were another branch of his labours\xe2\x80\x94not a\r\nvery illuminating fact; but could I pick up more in a single day?\r\n\r\nThere remained Esens, and it was thither I resolved to go to-night\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ntedious journey, lasting till past eight in the evening; but there I\r\nshould only be an hour from Norden by rail.\r\n\r\nAnd at Esens?\r\n\r\nAll day long I strove for light on the central mystery, collecting from\r\nmy diary, my memory, my imagination, from the map, the time-table, and\r\nDavies\xe2\x80\x99s grubby jottings, every elusive atom of material. Sometimes I\r\nissued from a reverie with a start, to find a phlegmatic Dutch peasant\r\nstaring strangely at me over his china pipe. I was more careful over\r\nthe German border. Davies\xe2\x80\x99s paper I soon knew by heart. I pictured him\r\nwriting it with his cramped fist in his corner by the stove, fighting\r\nagainst sleep, absently striking salvos of matches, while I snored in\r\nmy bunk; absently diverging into dreams, I knew, of a rose-brown face\r\nunder dewy hair and a grey tam-o\xe2\x80\x99-shanter; though not a word of her\r\ncame into the document. I smiled to see his undying faith in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cchannel theory\xe2\x80\x9d reconciled at the eleventh hour, with new data\r\ntouching the neglected \xe2\x80\x9cland\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nThe result was certainly interesting, but it left me cold. That there\r\nexisted in the German archives some such scheme of defence for the\r\nNorth Sea coast was very likely indeed. The seven islands, with their\r\nseven shallow channels (though, by the way, two of them, the twin\r\nbranches of the Ems, are by no means so shallow), were a very fair\r\nconjecture, and fitted in admirably with the channel theory, whose\r\nintrinsic merits I had always recognised; my constant objection having\r\nbeen that it did not go nearly far enough to account for our treatment.\r\nThe ring of railway round the peninsula, with Esens at the apex, was\r\nsuggestive, too; but the same objection applied. Every country with a\r\nmaritime frontier has, I suppose, secret plans of mobilisation for its\r\ndefence, but they are not such as could be discovered by passing\r\ntravellers, not such as would warrant stealthy searches, or require for\r\ntheir elaboration so recondite a meeting-place as Memmert. Dollmann was\r\nanother weak point; Dollmann in England, spying. All countries, Germany\r\nincluded, have spies in their service, dirty though necessary tools;\r\nbut Dollmann in such intimate association with the principal plotters\r\non this side; Dollmann rich, influential, a power in local affairs\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas clear he was no ordinary spy.\r\n\r\nAnd here I detected a hesitation in Davies\xe2\x80\x99s rough sketch, a\r\nreluctance, as it were, to pursue a clue to its logical end. He spoke\r\nof a German scheme of coast defence, and in the next breath of Dollmann\r\nspying for English plans in the event of war with Germany, and there he\r\nleft the matter; but what sort of plans? Obviously (if he was on the\r\nright track) plans of attack on the German coast as opposed to those of\r\nstrategy on the high seas. But what sort of an attack? Obviously again,\r\nif his railway-ring meant anything, an attack by invasion on that\r\nremote and desolate littoral which he had so often himself declared to\r\nbe impregnably secure behind its web of sands and shallows. My mind\r\nwent back to my question at Bensersiel, \xe2\x80\x9cCan this coast be invaded?\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nhis denial and our fruitless survey of the dykes and polders. Was he\r\nnow reverting to a fancy we had both rejected, while shrinking from\r\ngiving it explicit utterance? The doubt was tantalising.\r\n\r\nA brief digression here about the phases of my journey. At Rheine I\r\nchanged trains, turned due north and became a German seaman. There was\r\nlittle risk in a defective accent\xe2\x80\x94sailors are so polyglot; while an\r\nEnglish sailor straying about Esens might excite curiosity. Yesterday I\r\nhad paid no heed to the landscape; to-day I neglected nothing that\r\ncould conceivably supply a hint.\r\n\r\nFrom Rheine to Emden we descended the valley of the Ems; at first\r\nthrough a land of thriving towns and fat pastures, degenerating farther\r\nnorth to spaces of heathery bog and moorland\xe2\x80\x94a sad country, but looking\r\nat its best, such as that was, for I should mention here that the\r\nweather, which in the early morning had been as cold and misty as ever,\r\ngrew steadily milder and brighter as the day advanced; while my\r\nnewspaper stated that the glass was falling and the anticyclone giving\r\nway to pressure from the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAt Emden, where we entered Friesland proper, the train crossed a big\r\ncanal, and for the twentieth time that day (for we had passed numbers\r\nof them in Holland, and not a few in Germany), I said to myself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCanals, canals. Where does B\xc3\xb6hme come in?\xe2\x80\x9d It was dusk, but light\r\nenough to see an unfamiliar craft, a torpedo-boat in fact, moored to\r\nstakes at one side. In a moment I remembered that page in the _North\r\nSea Pilot_ where the Ems-Jade Canal is referred to as deep enough to\r\ncarry gun-boats, and as used for that strategic purpose between\r\nWilhelmshaven and Emden, along the base, that is, of the Frisian\r\npeninsula. I asked a peasant opposite; yes, that was the Ems-Jade\r\nCanal. Had Davies forgotten it? It would have greatly strengthened his\r\nhalting sketch.\r\n\r\nAt the bookstall at Emden I bought a pocket ordnance map [There is, of\r\ncourse, no space to reproduce this, but here and henceforward the\r\nreader is referred to Map B.] of Friesland, on a much larger scale than\r\nanything I had used before, and when I was unobserved studied the\r\ncourse of the canal, with an impatience which, alas! quickly cooled.\r\nFrom Emden northwards I used the same map to aid my eyesight, and with\r\nits help saw in the gathering gloom more heaths and bogs, once a great\r\nglimmering lake, and at intervals cultivated tracts; a watery land as\r\never; pools, streams and countless drains and ditches. Extensive woods\r\nwere marked also, but farther inland. We passed Norden at seven, just\r\ndark. I looked out for the creek, and sure enough, we crossed it just\r\nbefore entering the station. Its bed was nearly dry, and I\r\ndistinguished barges lying aground in it. This being the junction for\r\nEsens, I had to wait three-quarters of an hour, and then turned east\r\nthrough the uttermost northern wilds, stopping at occasional village\r\nstations and keeping five or six miles from the sea. It was during this\r\nstage, in a wretchedly lit compartment, and alone for the most part,\r\nthat I finally assembled all my threads and tried to weave them into a\r\ncable whose core should be Esens; \xe2\x80\x9ca town\xe2\x80\x9d, so Baedeker said, \xe2\x80\x9cof 3,500\r\ninhabitants, the centre of a rich agricultural district. Fine spire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsens is four miles inland from Bensersiel. I reviewed every\r\ncircumstance of that day at Bensersiel, and boiled to think how von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning had tricked me. He had driven to Esens himself, and read me so\r\nwell that he actually offered to take me with him, and I had refused\r\nfrom excess of cleverness. Stay, though; if I had happened to accept he\r\nwould have taken very good care that I saw nothing important. The\r\nsecret, therefore, was not writ large on the walls of Esens. Was it\r\nconnected with Bensersiel too, or the country between? I searched the\r\nordnance map again, standing up to get a better light and less jolting.\r\nThere was the road northwards from Esens to Bensersiel, passing through\r\ndots and chess-board squares, the former meaning fen, the latter\r\nfields, so the reference said. Something else, too, immediately caught\r\nmy eye, and that was a stream running to Bensersiel. I knew it at once\r\nfor the muddy stream or drain we had seen at the harbour, issuing\r\nthrough the sluice or _siel_ from which Bensersiel took its name. But\r\nit arrested my attention now because it looked more prominent than I\r\nshould have expected. Charts are apt to ignore the geography of the\r\nmainland, except in so far as it offers sea-marks to mariners. On the\r\nchart this stream had been shown as a rough little corkscrew, like a\r\nsucking-pig\xe2\x80\x99s tail. On the ordnance map it was marked with a dark blue\r\nline, was labelled \xe2\x80\x9cBenser Tief\xe2\x80\x9d, and was given a more resolute course;\r\nbends became angles, and there were what appeared to be artificial\r\nstraightnesses at certain points. One of the threads in my skein, the\r\ncanal thread, tingled sympathetically, like a wire charged with\r\ncurrent. Standing astraddle on both seats, with the map close to the\r\nlamp, I greedily followed the course of the \xe2\x80\x9ctief\xe2\x80\x9d southward. It\r\ninclined away from the road to Esens and passed the town about a mile\r\nto the west, diving underneath the railway. Soon after it took angular\r\ntacks to the eastward, and joined another blue line trending\r\nsouth-east, and lettered \xe2\x80\x9cEsens\xe2\x80\x94Wittmunder _Canal_.\xe2\x80\x9d This canal,\r\nhowever, came to an abrupt end halfway to Wittmund, a neighbouring\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nFor the first time that day there came to me a sense of genuine\r\ninspiration. Those shallow depths and short distances, fractions of\r\nmetres and kilometres, which I had overheard from B\xc3\xb6hme\xe2\x80\x99s lips at\r\nMemmert, and which Davies had attributed to the outside channels\xe2\x80\x94did\r\nthey refer to a canal? I remembered seeing barges in Bensersiel\r\nharbour. I remembered conversations with the natives in the inn, scraps\r\nof the post-master\xe2\x80\x99s pompous loquacity, talks of growing trade, of\r\nbricks and grain passing from the interior to the islands: from another\r\nsource\xe2\x80\x94was it the grocer of Wangeroog?\xe2\x80\x94of expansion of business in the\r\nislands themselves as bathing resorts; from another source again\xe2\x80\x94von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning himself, surely\xe2\x80\x94of Dollmann\xe2\x80\x99s personal activity in the\r\ndevelopment of the islands. In obscure connexion with these things, I\r\nsaw the torpedo-boat in the Ems-Jade Canal.\r\n\r\nIt was between Dornum and Esens that these ideas came, and I was still\r\nabsorbed in them when the train drew up, just upon nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at my\r\ndestination, and after ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk, along with a handful of other\r\npassengers, I found myself in the quiet cobbled streets of Esens, with\r\nthe great church steeple, that we had so often seen from the sea,\r\nsoaring above me in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nThe Seven Siels\r\n\r\n\r\nSelecting the very humblest _Gasthaus_ I could discover, I laid down my\r\nbundle and called for beer, bread, and _Wurst._ The landlord, as I had\r\nexpected, spoke the Frisian dialect, so that though he was rather\r\ndifficult to understand, he had no doubts about the purity of my own\r\nGerman high accent. He was a worthy fellow, and hospitably interested:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I want a bed?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo; I was going on to Bensersiel,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nsleep there, and take the morning _Postschiff_ to Langeoog Island.\xe2\x80\x9d (I\r\nhad not forgotten our friends the twin giants and their functions.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas not an islander myself?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I had a married sister\r\nthere; had just returned from a year\xe2\x80\x99s voyaging, and was going to visit\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9chow are they getting on with the Benser\r\nTief?\xe2\x80\x9d My friend shrugged his shoulders; it was finished, he believed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the connexion to Wittmund?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cUnder construction still.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLangeoog\r\nwould be going ahead then?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh! he supposed so, but he did not believe\r\nin these new-fangled schemes.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was good for trade, I supposed?\r\nEsens would benefit in sending goods by the \xe2\x80\x98tief\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94what was the\r\ntraffic, by the way?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh, a few more barge-loads than before of\r\nbricks, timber, coals, etc., but it would come to nothing _he_ knew:\r\n_Aktiengesellschaften_ (companies) were an invention of the devil. A\r\nfew speculators got them up and made money themselves out of land and\r\ncontracts, while the shareholders they had hoodwinked starved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something in that,\xe2\x80\x9d I conceded to this bigoted old\r\nconservative; \xe2\x80\x9cmy sister at Langeoog rents her lodging-house from a man\r\nnamed Dollmann; they say he owns a heap of land about. I saw his yacht\r\nonce\xe2\x80\x94pink velvet and electric light inside, they say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the name,\xe2\x80\x9d said mine host, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s one of them\xe2\x80\x94some sort of\r\nforeigner, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard; runs a salvage concern, too, Juist way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he won\xe2\x80\x99t get any of my savings!\xe2\x80\x9d I laughed, and soon after took\r\nmy leave, and inquired from a passer-by the road to Dornum. \xe2\x80\x9cFollow the\r\nrailway,\xe2\x80\x9d I was told.\r\n\r\nWith a warm wind in my face from the south-west, fleecy clouds and a\r\nhalf-moon overhead, I set out, not for Bensersiel but for Benser Tief,\r\nwhich I knew must cross the road to Dornum somewhere. A mile or so of\r\ncobbled causeway flanked with ditches and willows, and running cheek by\r\njowl with the railway track; then a bridge, and below me the \xe2\x80\x9cTief\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nwhich was, in fact, a small canal. A rutty track left the road, and\r\nsloped down to it one side; a rough siding left the railway, and sloped\r\ndown to it on the other.\r\n\r\nI lit a pipe and sat on the parapet for a little. No one was stirring,\r\nso with great circumspection I began to reconnoitre the left bank to\r\nthe north. The siding entered a fenced enclosure by a locked gate\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngate I could have easily climbed, but I judged it wiser to go round by\r\nthe bridge again and look across. The enclosure was a small coal-store,\r\nnothing more; there were gaunt heaps of coal glittering in the\r\nmoonlight; a barge half loaded lying alongside, and a deserted office\r\nbuilding. I skulked along a sandy towpath in solitude. Fens and field\r\nwere round me, as the map had said; willows and osier-beds; the dim\r\nforms of cattle; the low melody of wind roaming unfettered over a\r\nplain; once or twice the flutter and quack of a startled wild-duck.\r\n\r\nPresently I came to a farmhouse, dark and silent; opposite it, in the\r\ncanal, a couple of empty barges. I climbed into one of these, and\r\nsounded with my stick on the off-side\xe2\x80\x94barely three feet; and the\r\ntorpedo-boat melted out of my speculations. The stream, I observed\r\nalso, was only just wide enough for two barges to pass with comfort.\r\nOther farms I saw, or thought I saw, and a few more barges lying in\r\nside-cuts linked by culverts to the canal, but nothing noteworthy; and\r\nmindful that I had to explore the Wittmund side of the railway too, I\r\nturned back, already a trifle damped in spirits, but still keenly\r\nexpectant.\r\n\r\nPassing under the road and railway, I again followed the tow-path,\r\nwhich, after half a mile, plunged into woods, then entered a clearing\r\nand another fenced enclosure; a timber-yard by the look of it. This\r\ntime I stripped from the waist downward, waded over, dressed again, and\r\nclimbed the paling. (There was a cottage standing back, but its\r\noccupants evidently slept.) I was in a timber-yard, by the stacks of\r\nwood and the steam saw-mill; but something more than a timber-yard, for\r\nas I warily advanced under the shadow of the trees at the edge of the\r\nclearing I came to a long tin shed which strangely reminded me of\r\nMemmert, and below it, nearer the canal, loomed a dark skeleton\r\nframework, which proved to be a half-built vessel on stocks. Close by\r\nwas a similar object, only nearly completed\xe2\x80\x94a barge. A paved slipway\r\nled to the water here, and the canal broadened to a siding or\r\nback-water in which lay seven or eight more barges in tiers. I scaled\r\nanother paling and went on, walking, I should think, three miles by the\r\nside of the canal, till the question of bed and ulterior plans brought\r\nme to a halt. It was past midnight, and I was adding little to my\r\ninformation. I had encountered a brick-field, but soon after that there\r\nwas increasing proof that the canal was as yet little used for traffic.\r\nIt grew narrower, and there were many signs of recent labour for its\r\nimprovement. In one place a dammed-off deviation was being excavated,\r\nevidently to abridge an impossible bend. The path had become atrocious,\r\nand my boots were heavy with clay. Bearing in mind the abruptly-ending\r\nblue line on the map, I considered it useless to go farther, and\r\nretraced my steps, trying to concoct a story which would satisfy an\r\nirritable Esens inn-keeper that it was a respectable wayfarer, and not\r\na tramp or a lunatic, who knocked him up at half-past one or\r\nthereabouts.\r\n\r\nBut a much more practical resource occurred to me as I approached the\r\ntimber-yard; for lodging, free and accessible, lay there ready to hand.\r\nI boarded one of the empty barges in the backwater, and surveyed my\r\nquarters for the night. It was of a similar pattern to all the others I\r\nhad seen; a lighter, strictly, in the sense that it had no means of\r\nself-propulsion, and no separate quarters for a crew, the whole\r\ninterior of the hull being free for cargo. At both bow and stern there\r\nwere ten feet or so of deck, garnished with bitts and bollards. The\r\nrest was an open well, flanked by waterways of substantial breadth; the\r\nwhole of stout construction and, for a humble lighter, of\r\nwell-proportioned and even graceful design, with a marked forward\r\nsheer, and, as I had observed in the specimen on the stocks, easy lines\r\nat the stern. In short, it was apparent, even to an ignorant landsman\r\nlike myself, that she was designed not merely for canal work but for\r\nrough water; and well she might be, for, though the few miles of sea\r\nshe had to cross in order to reach the islands were both shallow and\r\nsheltered, I knew from experience what a vicious surf they could be\r\nwhipped into by a sudden gale. It must not be supposed that I dwelt on\r\nthis matter. On limited lines I was making progress, but the wings of\r\nimagination still drooped nervelessly at my sides. Otherwise I perhaps\r\nshould have examined this lighter more particularly, instead of\r\nregarding it mainly as a convenient hiding-place. Under the stern-deck\r\nwas stored a massive roll of tarpaulin, a corner of which made an\r\nexcellent blanket, and my bundle a good pillow. It was a descent from\r\nthe luxury of last night; but a spy, I reflected philosophically,\r\ncannot expect a feather bed two nights running, and this one was at any\r\nrate airier and roomier than the coffin-like bunk of the _Dulcibella_,\r\nand not so very much harder.\r\n\r\nWhen snugly ensconced, I studied the map by intermittent match-light.\r\nIt had been dawning on me in the last half-hour that this canal was\r\nonly one of several; that in concentrating myself on Esens and\r\nBensersiel, I had forgotten that there were other villages ending in\r\nsiel, also furnished on the chart with corkscrew streams; and,\r\nmoreover, that B\xc3\xb6hme\xe2\x80\x99s statistics of depth and distance had been\r\nmarshalled in seven categories, A to G. The very first match brought\r\nfull recollection as to the villages. The suffix _siel_ repeated itself\r\nall round the coast-line. Five miles eastward of Bensersiel was\r\nNeuharlingersiel, and farther on Carolinensiel. Four miles westward was\r\nDornumersiel; and farther on Nessmersiel and Hilgenriedersiel. That was\r\nsix on the north coast of the peninsula alone. On the west coast,\r\nfacing the Ems, there was only one, Greetsiel, a good way south of\r\nNorden. But on the east, facing the Jade, there were no less than\r\neight, at very close intervals. A moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought and I disregarded\r\nthis latter group; they had nothing to do with Esens, nor had they any\r\nimaginable _raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tre_ as veins for commerce; differing markedly in\r\nthis respect from the group of six on the north coast, whose outlook\r\nwas the chain of islands, and whose inland centre, almost exactly, was\r\nEsens. I still wanted one to make seven, and as a working hypothesis\r\nadded the solitary Greetsiel. At all seven villages streams debouched,\r\nas at Bensersiel. From all seven points of issue dotted lines were\r\nmarked seaward, intersecting the great tidal sands and leading towards\r\nthe islands. And on the mainland behind the whole sevenfold system ran\r\nthe loop of railway. But there were manifold minor points of\r\ndifference. No stream boasted so deep and decisive a blue lintel as did\r\nBenser Tief; none penetrated so far into the Hinterland. They varied in\r\nlength and sinuosity. Two, those belonging to Hilgenriedersiel and\r\nGreetsiel, appeared not to reach the railway at all. On the other hand,\r\nCarolinensiel, opposite Wangeroog Island, had a branch line all to\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nMatch after match waxed and waned as I puzzled over the mystic seven.\r\nIn the end I puzzled myself to sleep, with the one fixed idea that\r\nto-morrow, on my way back to Norden, I must see more of these budding\r\ncanals, if such they were. My dreams that night were of a mighty chain\r\nof redoubts and masked batteries couching _perdus_ among the sand-dunes\r\nof desolate islets; built, coral-like, by infinitely slow and secret\r\nlabour; fed by lethal cargoes borne in lighters and in charge of\r\nstealthy mutes who, one and all, bore the likeness of Grimm.\r\n\r\nI was up and away at daylight (the weather mild and showery), meeting\r\nsome navvies on my way back to the road, who gave me good morning and a\r\nstare. On the bridge I halted and fell into torments of indecision.\r\nThere was so much to do and so little time to do it in. The whole\r\nproblem seemed to have been multiplied by seven, and the total again\r\ndoubled and redoubled\xe2\x80\x94seven blue lines on land, seven dotted lines on\r\nthe sea, seven islands in the offing. Once I was near deciding to put\r\nmy pretext into practice, and cross to Langeoog; but that meant missing\r\nthe rendezvous, and I was loth to do that.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I wanted breakfast badly; and the best way to get it, and\r\nat the same time to open new ground, was to walk to Dornum. Then I\r\nshould find a blue line called the _Neues Tief_ leading to\r\nDornumersiel, on the coast. That explored, I could pass on to Nesse,\r\nwhere there was another blue line to Nessmersiel. All this was on the\r\nway to Norden, and I should have the railway constantly at my back, to\r\ncarry me there in the evening. The last train (my time-table told me)\r\nwas one reaching Norden at 7.15 p.m. I could catch this at Hage Station\r\nat 7.5.\r\n\r\nA brisk walk of six miles brought me, ravenously hungry, to Dornum.\r\nRoad and railway had clung together all the time, and about half-way\r\nhad been joined on the left by a third companion in the shape of a puny\r\nstream which I knew from the map to be the upper portion of Neues Tief.\r\nWriggling and doubling like an eel, choked with sedges and reeds, it\r\nhad no pretensions to being navigable. At length it looped away into\r\nthe fens out of sight, only to reappear again close to Dornum in a much\r\nmore dignified guise.\r\n\r\nThere was no siding where the railway crossed it, but at the town\r\nitself, which it skirted on the east, a towpath began, and a piled\r\nwharf had been recently constructed. Going on to this was a red-brick\r\nbuilding with the look of a warehouse, roofless as yet, and with\r\nworkmen on its scaffolds. It sharpened the edge of my appetite.\r\n\r\nIf I had been wise I should have been content with a snack bought at a\r\ncounter, but a thirst for hot coffee and clues induced me to repeat the\r\nexperiment of Esens and seek a primitive beer-house. I was less lucky\r\non this occasion. The house I chose was obscure enough, but its\r\nproprietor was no simple Frisian, but an ill-looking rascal with shifty\r\neyes and a debauched complexion, who showed a most unwelcome curiosity\r\nin his customer. As a last fatality, he wore a peaked cap like my own,\r\nand turned out to be an ex-sailor. I should have fled at the sight of\r\nhim had I had the chance, but I was attended to first by a slatternly\r\ngirl who, I am sure, called him up to view me. To explain my muddy\r\nboots and trousers I said I had walked from Esens, and from that I\r\nfound myself involved in a tangle of impromptu lies. Floundering down\r\nan old groove, I placed my sister this time on Baltrum Island, and said\r\nI was going to Dornumersiel (which is opposite Baltrum) to cross from\r\nthere. As this was drawing a bow at a venture, I dared not assume local\r\nknowledge, and spoke of the visit as my first. Dornumersiel was a lucky\r\nshot; there _was_ a ferry-galliot from there to Baltrum; but he knew,\r\nor pretended to know, Baltrum, and had not heard of my sister. I grew\r\nthe more nervous in that I saw from the first that he took me to be of\r\nbetter condition than most merchant seamen; and, to make matters worse,\r\nI was imprudent enough in pleading haste to pull out from an inner\r\npocket my gold watch with the chain and seals attached. He told me\r\nthere was no hurry, that I should miss the tide at Dornumersiel, and\r\nthen fell to pressing strong waters on me, and asking questions whose\r\ninsinuating grossness gave me the key to his biography. He must have\r\nbeen at one stage in his career a dock-side crimp, one of those foul\r\nsharks who prey on discharged seamen, and as often as not are ex-seamen\r\nthemselves, versed in the weaknesses of the tribe. He was now keeping\r\nhis hand in with me, who, unhappily, purported to belong to the very\r\nclass he was used to victimise, and, moreover, had a gold watch, and,\r\ndoubtless, a full purse. Nothing more ridiculously inopportune could\r\nhave befallen me, or more dangerous; for his class are as cosmopolitan\r\nas waiters and _concierges,_ with as facile a gift for language and as\r\nunerring a scent for nationality. Sure enough, the fellow recognised\r\nmine, and positively challenged me with it in fairly fluent English\r\nwith a Yankee twang. Encumbered with the mythical sister, of course I\r\nstuck to my lie, said I had been on an English ship so long that I had\r\npicked up the accent, and also gave him some words in broken English.\r\nAt the same time I showed I thought him an impertinent nuisance, paid\r\nmy score and walked out\xe2\x80\x94quit of him? Not a bit of it! He insisted on\r\nshowing me the way to Dornumersiel, and followed me down the street.\r\nPerceiving that he was in liquor, in spite of the early hour, I dared\r\nnot risk a quarrelsome scene with a man who already knew so much about\r\nme, and might at any moment elicit more. So I melted, and humoured him;\r\ntreated him in a ginshop in the hope of giving him the slip\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndisastrous resource, which was made a precedent for further potations\r\nelsewhere. I would gladly draw a veil over our scandalous progress\r\nthrough peaceable Dornum, of the terrors I experienced when he\r\nintroduced me as his friend, and as his English friend, and of the\r\nabasement I felt, too, as, linked arm in arm, we trod the three miles\r\nof road coastwards. It was his malicious whim that we should talk\r\nEnglish; a fortunate whim, as it turned out, because I knew no fo\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99sle\r\nGerman, but had a smattering of fo\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99sle English, gathered from\r\nCutcliffe Hyne and Kipling. With these I extemporised a disreputable\r\nhybrid, mostly consisting of oaths and blasphemies, and so yarned of\r\nimaginary voyages. Of course he knew every port in the world, but\r\nhappily was none too critical, owing to repeated _schnappsen._\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was a deplorable _contretemps_ from every point of\r\nview. I was wasting my time, for the road took a different direction to\r\nthe Neues Tief, so that I had not even the advantage of inspecting the\r\ncanal and only met with it when we reached the sea. Here it split into\r\ntwo mouths, both furnished with locks, and emptying into two little\r\nmud-hole harbours, replicas of Bensersiel, each owning its cluster of\r\nhouses. I made straight for the _Gasthaus_ at Dornumersiel, primed my\r\ncompanion well, and asked him to wait while I saw about a boat in the\r\nharbour; but, needless to say, I never rejoined him. I just took a\r\ncursory look at the left-hand harbour, saw a lighter locking through\r\n(for the tide was high), and then walked as fast as my legs would carry\r\nme to the outermost dyke, mounted it, and strode along the sea\r\nwestwards in the teeth of a smart shower of rain, full of deep\r\napprehensions as to the stir and gossip my disappearance might cause if\r\nmy odious crimp was sober enough to discover it. As soon as I deemed it\r\nsafe, I dropped on to the sand and ran till I could run no more. Then I\r\nsat on my bundle with my back to the dyke in partial shelter from the\r\nrain, watching the sea recede from the flats and dwindle into slender\r\nmeres, and the laden clouds fly weeping over the islands till those\r\npale shapes were lost in mist.\r\n\r\nThe barge I had seen locking through was creeping across towards\r\nLangeoog behind a tug and a wisp of smoke.\r\n\r\nNo more exploration by daylight! That was my first resolve, for I felt\r\nas if the country must be ringing with reports of an Englishman in\r\ndisguise. I must remain in hiding till dusk, then regain the railway\r\nand slink into that train to Norden. Now directly I began to resign\r\nmyself to temporary inaction, and to centre my thoughts on the\r\nrendezvous, a new doubt assailed me. Nothing had seemed more certain\r\nyesterday than that Norden was the scene of the rendezvous, but that\r\nwas before the seven _siels_ had come into prominence. The name Norden\r\nnow sounded naked and unconvincing. As I wondered why, it suddenly\r\noccurred to me that _all_ the stations along this northern line, though\r\nfarther inland than Norden, were equally \xe2\x80\x9ccoast stations\xe2\x80\x9d, in the sense\r\nthat they were in touch with harbours (of a sort) on the coast. Norden\r\nhad its tidal creek, but Esens and Dornum had their \xe2\x80\x9ctiefs\xe2\x80\x9d or canals.\r\nFool that I had been to put such a narrow and literal construction on\r\nthe phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe tide serves!\xe2\x80\x9d Which was it more likely that my\r\nconspirators would visit\xe2\x80\x94Norden, whose intrusion into our theories was\r\npurely hypothetical, or one of these _siels_ to whose sevenfold systems\r\nall my latest observations gave such transcendent significance?\r\n\r\nThere was only one answer; and it filled me with profound\r\ndiscouragement. Seven possible rendezvous!\xe2\x80\x94eight, counting Norden.\r\nWhich to make for? Out came the time-table and map, and with them hope.\r\nThe case was not so bad after all; it demanded no immediate change of\r\nplan, though it imported grave uncertainties and risks. Norden was\r\nstill the objective, but mainly as a railway junction, only remotely as\r\na seaport. Though the possible rendezvous were eight, the possible\r\nstations were reduced to five\xe2\x80\x94Norden, Hage, Dornum, Esens, Wittmund\xe2\x80\x94all\r\non one single line. Trains from east to west along this line were\r\nnegligible, because there were none that could be called night trains,\r\nthe latest being the one I had this morning fixed on to bring me to\r\nNorden, where it arrived at 7.15. Of trains from west to east there was\r\nonly one that need be considered, the same one that I had travelled by\r\nlast night, leaving Norden at 7.43 and reaching Esens at 8.50, and\r\nWittmund at 9.13. This train, as the reader who was with me in it\r\nknows, was in correspondence with another from Emden and the south, and\r\nalso, I now found, with services from Hanover, Bremen, and Berlin. He\r\nwill also remember that I had to wait three-quarters of an hour at\r\nNorden, from 7 to 7.43.\r\n\r\nThe platform at Norden Junction, therefore, between 7.15, when I should\r\narrive at it _from_ the east, and 7.43 when B\xc3\xb6hme and his unknown\r\nfriend should leave it _for_ the east; there, and in that half-hour,\r\nwas my opportunity for recognising and shadowing two at least of the\r\nconspirators. I must take the train they took, and alight where they\r\nalighted. If I could not find them at all I should be thrown back on\r\nthe rejected view that Norden itself was the rendezvous, and should\r\nwait there till 10.46.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it was all very well to resolve on inaction till dusk;\r\nbut after an hour\xe2\x80\x99s rest, damp clothes and feet, and the absence of\r\npursuers, tempted me to take the field again. Avoiding roads and\r\nvillages as long as it was light, I cut across country\r\nsouth-westwards\xe2\x80\x94a dismal and laborious journey, with oozy fens and\r\nknee-deep drains to course, with circuits to be made to pass clear of\r\npeasants, and many furtive crouchings behind dykes and willows. What\r\nlittle I learnt was in harmony with previous explorations, for my track\r\ncut at right angles the line of the Harke Tief, the stream issuing at\r\nNessmersiel. It, too, was in the nature of a canal, but only in embryo\r\nat the point I touched it, south of Nesse. Works on a deviation were in\r\nprogress, and in a short digression down stream I sighted another\r\nlighter-building yard. As for Hilgenriedersiel, the fourth of the\r\nseven, I had no time to see anything of it at all. At seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock I\r\nwas at Hage Station, very tired, wet, and footsore, after covering\r\nnearly twenty miles all told since I left my bed in the lighter.\r\n\r\nFrom here to Norden it was a run in the train of ten minutes, which I\r\nspent in eating some rye bread and smoked eel, and in scraping the mud\r\noff my boots and trousers. Fatigue vanished when the train drew up at\r\nthe station, and the momentous twenty-eight minutes began to run their\r\ncourse. Having donned a bulky muffler and turned up the collar of my\r\npea-jacket, I crossed over immediately to the up-platform, walked\r\nboldly to the booking-office, and at once sighted\xe2\x80\x94von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x94yes, von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning in mufti; but there was no mistaking his tall athletic figure,\r\npleasant features, and neat brown beard. He was just leaving the\r\nwindow, gathering up a ticket and some coins. I joined a _queue_ of\r\nthree or four persons who were waiting their turn, flattened myself\r\nbetween them and the partition till I heard him walk out. Not having\r\nheard what station he had booked for, I took a fourth-class ticket to\r\nWittmund, which covered all chances. Then, with my chin buried in my\r\nmuffler, I sought the darkest corner of the ill-lit combination of bar\r\nand waiting-room where, by the tiresome custom in Germany, would-be\r\ntravellers are penned till their train is ready. Von Br\xc3\xbcning I\r\nperceived sitting in another corner, with his hat over his eyes and a\r\ncigar between his lips. A boy brought me a tankard of tawny Munich\r\nbeer, and, sipping it, I watched. People passed in and out, but nobody\r\nspoke to the sailor in mufti. When a quarter of an hour elapsed, a\r\nplatform door opened, and a raucous voice shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cHage, Dornum,\r\nEsens, Wittmund!\xe2\x80\x9d A knot of passengers jostled out to the platform,\r\nshowing their tickets. I was slow over my beer, and was last of the\r\nknot, with von Br\xc3\xbcning immediately ahead of me, so close that his\r\ncigar-smoke curled into my face. I looked over his shoulder at the\r\nticket he showed, missed the name, but caught a muttered double\r\nsibilant from the official who checked it; ran over the stations in my\r\nhead, and pounced on _Esens._ That was as much I wanted to know for the\r\npresent; so I made my way to a fourth-class compartment, and lost sight\r\nof my quarry, not venturing, till the last door had banged, to look out\r\nof the window. When I did so two late arrivals were hurrying up to a\r\ncarriage\xe2\x80\x94one tall, one of middle height; both in cloaks and comforters.\r\nTheir features I could not distinguish, but certainly neither of them\r\nwas B\xc3\xb6hme. They had not come through the waiting-room door, but,\r\nplainly, from the dark end of the platform, where they had been\r\nwaiting. A guard, with some surly remonstrances, shut them in, and the\r\ntrain started.\r\n\r\nEsens\xe2\x80\x94the name had not surprised me; it fulfilled a presentiment that\r\nhad been growing in strength all the afternoon. For the last time I\r\nreferred to the map, pulpy and blurred with the day\xe2\x80\x99s exposure, and\r\ntried to etch it into my brain. I marked the road to Bensersiel, and\r\nhow it converged by degrees on the Benser Tief until they met at the\r\nsea. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tide serves!\xe2\x80\x9d Longing for Davies to help me, I reckoned, by\r\nthe aid of my diary, that high tide at Bensersiel would be about\r\neleven, and for two hours, I remembered (say from ten to twelve\r\nto-night), there were from five to six feet of water in the harbour.\r\n\r\nWe should reach Esens at 8.50. Would they drive, as von Br\xc3\xbcning had\r\ndone a week ago? I tightened my belt, stamped my mud-burdened boots,\r\nand thanked God for the Munich beer. Whither were they going from\r\nBensersiel, and in what; and how was I to follow them? These were\r\nnebulous questions, but I was in fettle for anything; boat-stealing was\r\na bagatelle. Fortune, I thought, smiled; Romance beckoned; even the sea\r\nlooked kind. Ay, and I do not know but that Imagination was already\r\nbeginning to unstiffen and flutter those nerveless wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nThe Luck of the Stowaway\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Esens Station I reversed my Norden tactics, jumped out smartly, and\r\ngot to the door of egress first of all, gave up my ticket, and hung\r\nabout the gate of the station under cover of darkness. Fortune smiled\r\nstill; there was no vehicle in waiting at all, and there were only half\r\na dozen passengers. Two of these were the cloaked gentlemen who had\r\nbeen so nearly left behind at Norden, and another was von Br\xc3\xbcning. The\r\nlatter walked well in advance of the first pair, but at the gate on to\r\nthe high road the three showed a common purpose, in that, unlike the\r\nrest, who turned towards Esens town, they turned southwards; much to my\r\nperplexity, for this was the contrary direction to Bensersiel and the\r\nsea. I, with my bundle on my shoulder, had been bringing up the rear,\r\nand, as their faithful shadow, turned to the right too, without\r\nforeseeing the consequence. When it was too late to turn back I saw\r\nthat, fifty yards ahead, the road was barred by the gates of a level\r\ncrossing, and that the four of us must inevitably accumulate at the\r\nbarrier till the train had steamed away. This, in fact, happened, and\r\nfor a minute or two we were all in a group, elaborately indifferent to\r\none another, silent, but I am sure very conscious. As for me, \xe2\x80\x9csecret\r\nlaughter tickled all my soul\xe2\x80\x9d. When the gates were opened the three\r\nseemed disposed to lag, so I tactfully took my cue, trudged briskly on\r\nahead, and stopped after a few minutes to listen. Hearing nothing I\r\nwent cautiously back and found that they had disappeared; in which\r\ndirection was not long in doubt, for I came on a grassy path leading\r\ninto the fields on the left or west of the road, and though I could see\r\nno one I heard the distant murmur of receding voices.\r\n\r\nI took my bearings collectedly, placed one foot on the path, thought\r\nbetter of it, and turned back towards Esens. I knew without reference\r\nto the map that that path would bring them to the Benser Tief at a\r\npoint somewhere near the timber-yard. In a fog I might have followed\r\nthem there; as it was, the night was none too dark, and I had my\r\nstrength to husband; and stamped on my memory were the words \xe2\x80\x9cthe tide\r\nserves\xe2\x80\x9d. I judged it a wiser use of time and sinew to anticipate them\r\nat Bensersiel by the shortest road, leaving them to reach it by way of\r\nthe devious Tief, to examine which was, I felt convinced, one of their\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock of a fresh wild night, a halo round the beclouded\r\nmoon. I passed through quiet Esens, and in an hour I was close to\r\nBensersiel, and could hear the sea. In the rooted idea that I should\r\nfind Grimm on the outskirts, awaiting visitors, I left the road short\r\nof the village, and made a circuit to the harbour by way of the\r\nsea-wall. The lower windows of the inn shed a warm glow into the night,\r\nand within I could see the village circle gathered over cards, and\r\ndominated as of old by the assertive little postmaster, whose\r\nhigh-pitched, excitable voice I could clearly distinguish, as he sat\r\nwith his cap on the back of his head and a \xe2\x80\x9cfeine schnapps\xe2\x80\x9d at his\r\nelbow. The harbour itself looked exactly the same as I remembered it a\r\nweek ago. The post-boat lay in her old berth at the eastern jetty, her\r\nmainsail set and her twin giants spitting over the rail. I hailed them\r\nboldly from the shore (without showing them who I was), and was told\r\nthey were starting for Langeoog in a few minutes; the wind was\r\noff-shore, the mails aboard, and the water just high enough. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I\r\nwant a passage?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I thought I would wait.\xe2\x80\x9d Positive that my party\r\ncould never have got here so soon, I nevertheless kept an eye on the\r\ngalliot till she let go her stern-rope and slid away. One contingency\r\nwas eliminated. Some loiterers dispersed, and all port business\r\nappeared to be ended for the night.\r\n\r\nThree-quarters of an hour of strained suspense ensued. Most of it I\r\nspent on my knees in a dark angle between the dyke and the western\r\njetty, whence I had a strategic survey of the basin; but I was driven\r\nat times to relieve inaction by sallies which increased in audacity. I\r\nscouted on the road beyond the bridge, hovered round the lock, and\r\npeered in at the inn parlour; but nowhere could I see a trace of Grimm.\r\nI examined every floating object in the harbour (they were very few),\r\ndropped on to two lighters and pried under tarpaulins, boarded a\r\ndeserted tug and two or three clumsy rowboats tied up to a\r\nmooring-post. Only one of these had the look of readiness, the rest\r\nbeing devoid of oars and rowlocks; a discouraging state of things for a\r\nprospective boat-lifter. It was the sight of these rowboats that\r\nsuggested a last and most distracting possibility, namely, that the\r\nboat in waiting, if boat there were, might be not in the harbour at\r\nall, but somewhere on the sands outside the dyke, where, at this high\r\nstate of the tide, it would have water and to spare. Back to the dyke\r\nthen; but as I peered seaward on the way, contingencies evaporated and\r\na solid fact supervened, for I saw the lights of a steamboat\r\napproaching the harbour mouth. I had barely time to gain my coign of\r\nvantage before she had swept in between the piers, and with a fitful\r\nswizzling of her screw was turning and backing down to a berth just\r\nahead of one of the lighters, and not fifty feet from my hiding-place.\r\nA deck-hand jumped ashore with a rope, while the man at the wheel gave\r\ngruff directions. The vessel was a small tug, and the man at the wheel\r\ndisclosed his identity when, having rung off his engines, he jumped\r\nashore also, looked at his watch in the beam of the sidelight, and\r\nwalked towards the village. It was Grimm, by the height and build\xe2\x80\x94Grimm\r\nclad in a long tarpaulin coat and a sou\xe2\x80\x99wester. I watched him cross the\r\nshaft of light from the inn window and disappear in the direction of\r\nthe canal.\r\n\r\nAnother sailor now appeared and helped his fellow to tie up the tug.\r\nThe two together then went aft and began to set about some job whose\r\nnature I could not determine. To emerge was perilous, so I set about a\r\njob of my own, tearing open my bundle and pulling an oilskin jacket and\r\ntrousers over my clothes, and discarding my peaked cap for a\r\nsou\xe2\x80\x99-wester. This operation was prompted instantaneously by the garb of\r\ntwo sailors, who in hauling on the forward warp came into the field of\r\nthe mast-head light.\r\n\r\nIt was something of a gymnastic masterpiece, since I was lying\xe2\x80\x94or,\r\nrather, standing aslant\xe2\x80\x94on the rough sea-wall, with crannies of brick\r\nfor foothold and the water plashing below me; but then I had not lived\r\nin the _Dulcibella_ for nothing. My chain of thought, I fancy, was\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94the tug is to carry my party; I cannot shadow a tug in a rowboat,\r\nyet I intend to shadow my party; I must therefore go with them in the\r\ntug, and the first and soundest step is to mimic her crew. But the next\r\nstep was a hard matter, for the crew having finished their job sat side\r\nby side on the bulwarks and lit their pipes. However, a little\r\npantomime soon occurred, as amusing as it was inspiriting. They seemed\r\nto consult together, looking from the tug to the inn and from the inn\r\nto the tug. One of them walked a few paces inn-wards and beckoned to\r\nthe other, who in his turn called something down the engine-room\r\nskylight, and then joined his mate in a scuttle to the inn. Even while\r\nI watched the pantomime I was sliding off my boots, and it had not been\r\nconsummated a second before I had them in my arms and was tripping over\r\nthe mud in my stocking feet. A dozen noiseless steps and I was over the\r\nbulwarks between the wheel and the smoke-stack, casting about for a\r\nhiding-place. The conventional stowaway hides in the hold, but there\r\nwas only a stokehold here, occupied moreover; nor was there an empty\r\napple-barrel, such as Jim of _Treasure Island_ found so useful. As far\r\nas I could see\xe2\x80\x94and I dared not venture far for fear of the skylight\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsurface of the deck offered nothing secure. But on the farther or\r\nstarboard side, rather abaft the beam, there was a small boat in\r\ndavits, swung outboard, to which common sense, and perhaps a vague\r\nprescience of its after utility, pointed irresistibly. In any case,\r\ndiscrimination was out of place, so I mounted the bulwark and gently\r\nentered my refuge. The tackles creaked a trifle, oars and seats impeded\r\nme; but well before the thirsty truants had returned I was settled on\r\nthe floor boards between two thwarts, so placed that I could, if\r\nnecessary, peep over the gunwale.\r\n\r\nThe two sailors returned at a run, and very soon after voices\r\napproached, and I recognised that of Herr Schenkel chattering volubly.\r\nHe and Grimm boarded the tug and went down a companionway aft, near\r\nwhich, as I peeped over, I saw a second skylight, no bigger than the\r\n_Dulcibella_\xe2\x80\x99s, illuminated from below. Then I heard a cork drawn, and\r\nthe kiss of glasses, and in a minute or two they re-emerged. It was\r\napparent that Herr Schenkel was inclined to stay and make merry, and\r\nthat Grimm was anxious to get rid of him, and none too courteous in\r\nshowing it. The former urged that to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s tide would do, the latter\r\ngave orders to cast off, and at length observed with an angry oath that\r\nthe water was falling, and he must start; and, to clinch matters, with\r\na curt good-night, he went to the wheel and rang up his engines. Herr\r\nSchenkel landed and strutted off in high dudgeon, while the tug\xe2\x80\x99s screw\r\nbegan to revolve. We had only glided a few yards on when the engines\r\nstopped, a short blast of the whistle sounded, and, before I had had\r\ntime to recast the future, I heard a scurry of footsteps from the\r\ndirection of the dyke, first on the bank, next on the deck. The last of\r\nthese new arrivals panted audibly as he got aboard and dropped on the\r\nplanks with an unelastic thud.\r\n\r\nHer complement made up, the tug left the harbour, but not alone. While\r\nslowly gathering way the hull checked all at once with a sharp jerk,\r\nrecovered, and increased its speed. We had something in tow\xe2\x80\x94what? The\r\nlighter, of course, that had been lying astern of us.\r\n\r\nNow I knew what was in that lighter, because I had been to see, half an\r\nhour ago. It was no lethal cargo, but coal, common household coal; not\r\na full load of it, I remembered\xe2\x80\x94just a good-sized mound amidships,\r\ntrimmed with battens fore and aft to prevent shifting. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nI, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is intelligible enough. Grimm was ostensibly there to call for\r\na load of coal for Memmert. But does that mean we are going to\r\nMemmert?\xe2\x80\x9d At the same time I recalled a phrase overheard at the dep\xc3\xb4t,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one\xe2\x80\x94half a load.\xe2\x80\x9d Why half a load?\r\n\r\nFor some few minutes there was a good deal of movement on deck, and of\r\norders shouted by Grimm and answered by a voice from far astern on the\r\nlighter. Presently, however, the tug warmed to her work, the hull\r\nvibrated with energy, and an ordered peace reigned on board. I also\r\nrealised that having issued from the boomed channel we had turned\r\nwestward, for the wind, which had been blowing us fair, now blew\r\nstrongly over the port beam.\r\n\r\nI peeped out of my eyrie and was satisfied in a moment that as long as\r\nI made no noise, and observed proper prudence, I was perfectly safe\r\n_until the boat was wanted_. There were no deck lamps; the two\r\nskylights diffused but a sickly radiance, and I was abaft the\r\nside-lights. I was abaft the wheel also, though thrillingly near it in\r\npoint of distance\xe2\x80\x94about twelve feet, I should say; and Grimm was\r\nsteering. The wheel, I should mention here, was raised, as you often\r\nsee them, on a sort of pulpit, approached by two or three steps and\r\nfenced by a breast-high arc of boarding. Only one of the crew was\r\nvisible, and he was acting as look-out in the extreme bows, the rays of\r\nthe masthead lights\xe2\x80\x94for a second had been hoisted in sign of\r\ntowage\xe2\x80\x94glistening on his oilskin back. The other man, I concluded, was\r\nsteering the lighter, which I could dimly locate by the pale foam at\r\nher bow.\r\n\r\nAnd the passengers? They were all together aft, three of them, leaning\r\nover the taffrail, with their backs turned to me. One was short and\r\nstout\xe2\x80\x94B\xc3\xb6hme unquestionably; the panting and the thud on the planks had\r\nprepared me for that, though where he had sprung from I did not know.\r\nTwo were tall, and one of these must be von Br\xc3\xbcning. There ought to be\r\nfour, I reckoned; but three were all I could see. And what of the\r\nthird? It must be he who \xe2\x80\x9cinsists on coming\xe2\x80\x9d, the unknown superior at\r\nwhose instance and for whose behoof this secret expedition had been\r\nplanned. And who could he be? Many times, needless to say, I had asked\r\nmyself that question, but never till now, when I had found the\r\nrendezvous and joined the expedition, did it become one of burning\r\nimport.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny weather\xe2\x80\x9d was another of those stored-up phrases that were _\xc3\xa0\r\npropos._ It was a dirty, squally night, not very cold, for the wind\r\nstill hung in the S.S.W.\xe2\x80\x94an off-shore wind on this coast, causing no\r\nappreciable sea on the shoal spaces we were traversing. In the matter\r\nof our bearings, I set myself doggedly to overcome that paralysing\r\nperplexity, always induced in me by night or fog in these intricate\r\nwaters; and, by screwing round and round, succeeded so far as to\r\ndiscover and identify two flashing lights\xe2\x80\x94one alternately red and\r\nwhite, far and faint astern; the other right ahead and rather stronger,\r\ngiving white flashes only. The first and least familiar was, I made\r\nout, from the lighthouse on Wangeroog; the second, well known to me as\r\nour beacon star in the race from Memmert, was the light on the centre\r\nof Norderney Island, about ten miles away.\r\n\r\nI had no accurate idea of the time, for I could not see my watch, but I\r\nthought we must have started about a quarter past eleven. We were\r\ntravelling fast, the funnel belching out smoke and the bow-wave curling\r\nhigh; for the tug appeared to be a powerful little craft, and her load\r\nwas comparatively light.\r\n\r\nSo much for the general situation. As for my own predicament, I was in\r\nno mood to brood on the hazards of this mad adventure, a hundredfold\r\nmore hazardous than my fog-smothered eavesdropping at Memmert. The\r\ncrisis, I knew, had come, and the reckless impudence that had brought\r\nme here must serve me still and extricate me. Fortune loves rough\r\nwooing. I backed my luck and watched.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the passengers struck me as odd. They remained in a\r\nrow at the taffrail, gazing astern like regretful emigrants, and\r\nsometimes, gesticulating and pointing. Now no vestige of the low land\r\nwas visible, so I was driven to the conclusion that it was the lighter\r\nthey were discussing; and I date my awakening from the moment that I\r\nrealised this. But the thread broke prematurely; for the passengers\r\ntook to pacing the deck, and I had to lie low. When next I was able to\r\nraise my head they were round Grimm at the wheel, engaged, as far as I\r\ncould discover from their gestures, in an argument about our course and\r\nthe time, for Grimm looked at his watch by the light of a hand-lantern.\r\n\r\nWe were heading north, and I knew by the swell that we must be near the\r\nAccumer Ee, the gap between Langeoog and Baltrum. Were we going out to\r\nopen sea? It came over me with a rush that we _must,_ if we were to\r\ndrop this lighter at Memmert. Had I been Davies I should have been\r\nquicker to seize certain rigid conditions of this cruise, which no\r\nhuman power could modify. We had left after high tide. The water\r\ntherefore was falling everywhere; and the tributary channels in rear of\r\nthe islands were slowly growing impassable. It was quite thirty miles\r\nto Memmert, with three watersheds to pass; behind Baltrum, Norderney,\r\nand Juist. A skipper with nerve and perfect confidence might take us\r\nover one of these in the dark, but most of the run would infallibly\r\nhave to be made outside. I now better understood the protests of Herr\r\nSchenkel to Grimm. Never once had we seen a lighter in tow in the open\r\nsea, though plenty behind the barrier of islands; indeed it was the\r\nvery existence of the sheltered byways that created such traffic as\r\nthere was. It was only Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s _m\xc3\xa9tier_ and the incubus of the lighter\r\nthat had suggested Memmert as our destination at all, and I began to\r\ndoubt it now. That tricky hoop of sand had befooled us before.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, and as if to corroborate my thought, the telegraph rang\r\nand the tug slowed down. I effaced myself and heard Grimm shouting to\r\nthe man on the lighter to starboard his helm, and to the look-out to\r\ncome aft. The next order froze my very marrow; it was \xe2\x80\x9clower away\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\nSomeone was at the davits of my boat fingering the tackles; the forward\r\nfall-rope actually slipped in the block and tilted the boat a fraction.\r\nI was just wondering how far it was to swim to Langeoog, when a strong,\r\nimperious voice (unknown to me) rang out, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! We don\xe2\x80\x99t want the\r\nboat. The swell\xe2\x80\x99s nothing; we can jump! Can\xe2\x80\x99t we, B\xc3\xb6hme?\xe2\x80\x9d The speaker\r\nended with a jovial laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cMercy!\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9care _they_ going to\r\nswim to Langeoog?\xe2\x80\x9d but I also gasped for relief. The tug rolled\r\nlifelessly in the swell for a little, and footsteps retreated aft.\r\nThere were cries of \xe2\x80\x9cAchtung!\xe2\x80\x9d and some laughter, one big bump and a\r\ngood deal of grinding; and on we moved again, taking the strain of the\r\ntow-rope gingerly, and then full-speed ahead. The passengers, it\r\nseemed, preferred the lighter to the tug for cruising in; coal-dust and\r\nexposure to clean planks and a warm cuddy. When silence reigned again I\r\npeeped out. Grimm was at the wheel still, impassively twirling the\r\nspokes, with a glance over his shoulder at his precious freight. And,\r\nafter all, we _were_ going outside.\r\n\r\nClose on the port hand lay a black foam-girt shape, the east spit of\r\nBaltrum. It fused with the night, while we swung slowly round to\r\nwindward over the troubled bar. Now we were in the spacious deeps of\r\nthe North Sea; and feeling it too in increase of swell and volleys of\r\nspray.\r\n\r\nAt this point evolutions began. Grimm gave the wheel up to the\r\nlook-out, and himself went to the taffrail, whence he roared back\r\norders of \xe2\x80\x9cPort!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cStarboard!\xe2\x80\x9d in response to signals from the\r\nlighter. We made one complete circle, steering on each point of the\r\nwind in succession, after that worked straight out to sea till the\r\nwater was a good deal rougher, and back again at a tangent, till in\r\nearshot of the surf on the island beach. There the man\xc5\x93uvres, which\r\nwere clearly in the nature of a trial trip, ended; and we hove to, to\r\ntransship our passengers. They, when they came aboard, went straight\r\nbelow, and Grimm, having steadied the tug on a settled course and\r\nentrusted the wheel to the sailor again, stripped off his dripping\r\noilskin coat, threw it down on the cabin skylight, and followed them.\r\nThe course he had set was about west, with Norderney light a couple of\r\npoints off the port bow. The course for Memmert? Possibly; but I cared\r\nnot, for my mind was far from Memmert to-night. _It was the course for\r\nEngland too._ Yes, I understood at last. I was assisting at an\r\nexperimental rehearsal of a great scene, to be enacted, perhaps, in the\r\nnear future\xe2\x80\x94a scene when multitudes of seagoing lighters, carrying full\r\nloads of soldiers, not half loads of coals, should issue\r\nsimultaneously, in seven ordered fleets, from seven shallow outlets,\r\nand, under escort of the Imperial Navy, traverse the North Sea and\r\nthrow themselves bodily upon English shores.\r\n\r\nIndulgent reader, you may be pleased to say that I have been very\r\nobtuse; and yet, with humility, I protest against that verdict.\r\nRemember that, recent as are the events I am describing, it is only\r\nsince they happened that the possibility of an invasion of England by\r\nGermany has become a topic of public discussion. Davies and I had\r\nnever\xe2\x80\x94I was going to say had never considered it; but that would not be\r\naccurate, for we had glanced at it once or twice; and if any single\r\nincident in his or our joint cruise had provided a semblance of\r\nconfirmation, he, at any rate, would have kindled to that spark. But\r\nyou will see how perversely from first to last circumstances drove us\r\ndeeper and deeper into the wrong groove, till the idea became\r\ninveterate that the secret we were seeking was one of defence and not\r\noffence. Hence a complete mental somersault was required, and, as an\r\namateur, I found it difficult; the more so that the method of invasion,\r\nas I darkly comprehended it now, was of such a strange and\r\nunprecedented character; for orthodox invasions start from big ports\r\nand involve a fleet of ocean transports, while none of our clues\r\npointed that way. To neglect obvious methods, to draw on the obscure\r\nresources of an obscure strip of coast, to improve and exploit a\r\nquantity of insignificant streams and tidal outlets, and thence,\r\nscreened by the islands, to despatch an armada of light-draught barges,\r\ncapable of flinging themselves on a correspondingly obscure and\r\ntherefore unexpected portion of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s coast; that was a\r\nconception so daring, aye, and so quixotic in some of its aspects, that\r\neven now I was half incredulous. Yet it must be the true one. Bit by\r\nbit the fragments of the puzzle fell into order till a coherent whole\r\nwas adumbrated. [The reader will find the whole matter dealt with in\r\nthe Epilogue.]\r\n\r\nThe tug surged on into the night; a squall of rain leapt upon us and\r\nswept hissing astern. Baltrum vanished and the strands of Norderney\r\nbeamed under transient moonlight. Drunk with triumph, I cuddled in my\r\nrocking cradle and ransacked every unvisited chamber of the memory,\r\ntossing out their dusty contents, to make a joyous bonfire of some, and\r\nto see the residue take life and meaning in the light of the great\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\nMy reverie was of things, not persons; of vast national issues rather\r\nthan of the poignant human interests so closely linked with them. But\r\non a sudden I was recalled, with a shock, to myself, Davies, and the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWe were changing our course, as I knew by variations in the whirl of\r\ndraughts which whistled about me. I heard Grimm afoot again, and,\r\nchoosing my moment, surveyed the scene. Broad on the port-beam were the\r\ngarish lights of Norderney town and promenade, and the tug, I\r\nperceived, was drawing in to enter the See Gat. _[See Chart B.]_\r\n\r\nRound she came, hustling through the broken water of the bar, till her\r\nnose was south and the wind was on the starboard bow. Not a mile from\r\nme were the villa and the yacht, and the three persons of the\r\ndrama\xe2\x80\x94three, that is, if Davies were safe.\r\n\r\nWere we to land at Norderney harbour? Heavens, what a magnificent\r\nclimax!\xe2\x80\x94if only I could rise to it. My work here was done. At a stroke\r\nto rejoin Davies and be free to consummate our designs!\r\n\r\nA desperate idea of cutting the davit-tackles\xe2\x80\x94I blush to think of the\r\nstupidity\xe2\x80\x94was rejected as soon as it was born, and instead, I\r\nendeavoured to imagine our approach to the pier. My boat hung on the\r\nstarboard side; that would be the side away from the quay, and the tide\r\nwould be low. I could swarm down the davits during the stir of arrival,\r\ndrop into the sea and swim the few yards across the dredged-out\r\nchannel, wade through the mud to within a short distance of the\r\n_Dulcibella_, and swim the rest. I rubbed the salt out of my eyes and\r\nwriggled my cramped legs.... Hullo! why was Grimm leaving the helm\r\nagain? Back he went to the cabin, leaving the sailor at the helm.... We\r\nought to be turning to port now; but no\xe2\x80\x94on we went, south, for the\r\nmainland.\r\n\r\nThough one plan was frustrated, the longing to get to Davies, once\r\nimplanted, waxed apace.\r\n\r\nOur destination was at last beyond dispute. _[See Chart.]_ The channel\r\nwe were in was the same that we had cut across on our blind voyage to\r\nMemmert, and the same my ferry-steamer had followed two days ago. It\r\nwas a _cul-de-sac_ leading to one place only, the landing stage at\r\nNorddeich. The only place on the whole coast, now I came to think of\r\nit, where the tug could land at this tide. There the quay would be on\r\nthe starboard side, and I saw myself tied to my eyrie while the\r\npassengers landed and the tug and lighter turned back for Memmert; at\r\nMemmert, dawn, and discovery.\r\n\r\nThere was some way out\xe2\x80\x94some way out, I repeated to myself; some way to\r\nreap the fruit of Davies\xe2\x80\x99s long tutelage in the lore of this strange\r\nregion. What would _he_ do?\r\n\r\nFor answer there came the familiar _frou-frou_ of gentle surf on drying\r\nsands. The swell was dying away, the channel narrowing; dusky and weird\r\non the starboard hand stretched leagues of new-risen sand. Two men only\r\nwere on deck; the moon was quenched under the vanguard clouds of a\r\nfresh squall.\r\n\r\nA madcap scheme danced before me. The time, I _must_ know the time!\r\nCrouching low and cloaking the flame with my jacket I struck a match;\r\n2.30 a.m.\xe2\x80\x94the tide had been ebbing for about three hours and a half.\r\nLow water about five; they would be aground till 7.30. Danger to life?\r\nNone. Flares and rescuers? Not likely, with \xe2\x80\x9chim who insists\xe2\x80\x9d on board;\r\nbesides, no one could come, there being no danger. I should have a fair\r\nwind and a fair tide for _my_ trip. Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s coat was on the skylight;\r\nwe were both clean-shaved.\r\n\r\nThe helmsman gazed ahead, intent on his difficult course, and the wind\r\nhowled to perfection. I knelt up and examined one of the davit-tackles.\r\nThere was nothing remarkable about it, a double and a single block\r\n(like our own peak halyards), the lower one hooked into a ring in the\r\nboat, the hauling part made fast to a cleat on the davit itself.\r\nSomething there must be to give lateral support or the boat would have\r\nracketed abroad in the roll outside. The support, I found, consisted of\r\ntwo lanyards spliced to the davits and rove through holes in the keel.\r\nThese I leaned over and cut with my pocket-knife; the result being a\r\nbarely perceptible swaying of the boat, for the tug was under the lee\r\nof sands and on an even keel. Then I left my hiding-place, climbing out\r\nof the stern sheets by the after-davit, and preparing every successive\r\nmotion with exquisite tenderness, till I stood on the deck. In another\r\nmoment I was at the cabin skylight, lifting Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s long oilskin coat.\r\n(A second\xe2\x80\x99s yielding to temptation here; but no, the skylight was\r\nground glass, fastened from below. So, on with the coat, up with the\r\ncollar, and forward to the wheel on tiptoe.) As soon as I was up to the\r\nengine-room skylight (that is to say, well ahead of the cabin roof) I\r\nassumed a natural step, went up to the pulpit and touched the helmsman\r\non the arm, as I had seen Grimm do. The man stepped aside, grunting\r\nsomething about a light, and I took the wheel from him. Grimm was a man\r\nof few words, so I just jogged his satellite, and pointed forward. He\r\nwent off like a lamb to his customary place in the bows, not having\r\ndreamt\xe2\x80\x94why should he?\xe2\x80\x94of examining me, but in him I had instantly\r\nrecognised one of the crew of the _Kormoran_.\r\n\r\nMy ruse developed in all its delicious simplicity. We were, I\r\nestimated, about half-way to Norddeich, in the Buse Tief, a channel of\r\na navigable breadth, at the utmost of two hundred yards at this period\r\nof the tide. Two faint lights, one above the other, twinkled far ahead.\r\nWhat they meant I neither knew nor cared, since the only use I put them\r\nto was to test the effect of the wheel, for this was the first time I\r\nhad ever tasted the sweets of command on a steamboat. A few cautious\r\nessays taught me the rudiments, and nothing could hinder the\r\ncatastrophe now.\r\n\r\nI edged over to starboard\xe2\x80\x94that was the side I had selected\xe2\x80\x94and again a\r\nlittle more, till the glistening back of the look-out gave a slight\r\nmovement; but he was a well-drilled minion, with implicit trust in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cold man\xe2\x80\x9d. Now, hard over! and spoke by spoke I gave her the full\r\npressure of the helm. The look-out shouted a warning, and I raised my\r\narm in calm acknowledgement. A cry came from the lighter, and I\r\nremember I was just thinking \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the Dickens\xe2\x80\x99ll happen to her?\xe2\x80\x9d when\r\nthe end came; a _euthanasia_ so mild and gradual (for the sands are\r\nfringed with mud) that the disaster was on us before I was aware of it.\r\nThere was just the tiniest premonitory shuddering as our keel clove the\r\nbuttery medium, a cascade of ripples from either beam, and the wheel\r\njammed to rigidity in my hands, as the tug nestled up to her\r\nresting-place.\r\n\r\nIn the scene of panic that followed, it is safe to say that I was the\r\nonly soul on board who acted with methodical tranquillity. The look-out\r\nflew astern like an arrow, bawling to the lighter. Grimm, with the\r\npassengers tumbling up after him, was on deck in an instant, storming\r\nand cursing; flung himself on the wheel which I had respectfully\r\nabandoned, jangled the telegraph, and wrenched at the spokes. The tug\r\nlisted over under the force of the tide; wind, darkness, and rain\r\naggravated the confusion.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I stepped back behind the smoke stack, threw off my robe\r\nof office, and made for the boat. Long and bitter experience of running\r\naground had told me that that was sure to be wanted. On the way I\r\ncannoned into one of the passengers and pressed him into my service;\r\nincidentally seeing his face, and verifying an old conjecture. It was\r\none who, in Germany, has a better right to insist than anyone else.\r\n\r\nAs we reached the davits there was a report like a pistol-shot from the\r\nport-side\xe2\x80\x94the tow-rope parting, I believe, as the lighter with her\r\nshallower draught swung on past the tug. Fresh tumult arose, in which I\r\nheard: \xe2\x80\x9cLower the boat,\xe2\x80\x9d from Grimm; but the order was already\r\nexecuted. My ally the Passenger and I had each cast off a tackle, and\r\nslacked away with a run; that done, I promptly clutched the wire guy to\r\nsteady myself, and tumbled in. (It was not far to tumble, for the tug\r\nlisted heavily to starboard; think of our course, and the set of the\r\nebb stream, and you will see why.) The forward fall unhooked sweetly;\r\nbut the after one lost play. \xe2\x80\x9cSlack away,\xe2\x80\x9d I called, peremptorily, and\r\nfelt for my knife. My helper above obeyed; the hook yielded; I filliped\r\naway the loose tackle, and the boat floated away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nWe Achieve our Double Aim\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, exactly, the atmosphere of misunderstanding on the stranded tug\r\nwas dissipated, I do not know, for by the time I had fitted the\r\nrowlocks and shipped sculls, tide and wind had caught me, and were\r\nsweeping me merrily back on the road to Norderney, whose lights\r\ntwinkled through the scud in the north. With my first few strokes I\r\nmade towards the lighter\xe2\x80\x94which I could see sagging helplessly to\r\nleeward\xe2\x80\x94but as soon as I thought I was out of sight of the tug, I\r\npulled round and worked out my own salvation. There was an outburst of\r\nshouting which soon died away. Full speed on a falling tide! They were\r\npinned there for five hours sure. It was impossible to miss the way,\r\nand with my stout allies heaving me forward, I made short work of the\r\ntwo-mile passage. There was a sharp tussle at the last, where the Riff\r\nGat poured its stream across my path, and then I was craning over my\r\nshoulder, God knows with what tense anxiety, for the low hull and taper\r\nmast of the _Dulcibella_. Not there! No, not where I had left her. I\r\npulled furiously up the harbour past a sleeping ferry-steamer\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94praise Heaven!\xe2\x80\x94came on her warped alongside the jetty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d came from below, as I stepped on board.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! it\xe2\x80\x99s me.\xe2\x80\x9d And Davies and I were pawing one another in the dark\r\nof the cabin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you all right, old chap?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; are you? A match! What\xe2\x80\x99s the time? Quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens, Carruthers, what the blazes have you done to yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(I suspect I cut a pretty figure after my two days\xe2\x80\x99 outing.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen past three. It\xe2\x80\x99s the invasion of England! Is Dollmann at the\r\nvilla?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInvasion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Dollmann at the villa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the _Medusa_ afloat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, on the mud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! Are _we_ afloat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so still, but they made me shift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink! Track her out! Pole her out! Cut those warps!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a few strenuous minutes we toiled at the sweeps till the\r\n_Dulcibella_ was berthed ahead of the steamer, in deeper water.\r\nMeanwhile I had whispered a few facts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow soon can you get under way?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen\xe2\x80\x99s daylight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSunrise about seven, first dawn about five. Where are we bound?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolland, or England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they invading it now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, only rehearsing!\xe2\x80\x9d I laughed, wildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we can wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can wait exactly an hour and a half. Come ashore and knock up\r\nDollmann; we must denounce him, and get them both aboard; it\xe2\x80\x99s now or\r\nnever. Holy Saints! man, not as you are!\xe2\x80\x9d (He was in pyjamas.) \xe2\x80\x9cSea\r\nclothes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he put on Christian attire, I resumed my facts and sketched a\r\nplan. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you watched?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so; by the _Kormoran_\xe2\x80\x99s men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the _Kormoran_ here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to-night. Grimm called for them in that tug. I was watching. And,\r\nCarruthers, the _Blitz_ is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the roads outside\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t you see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking. Her skipper\xe2\x80\x99s safe anyway; so\xe2\x80\x99s B\xc3\xb6hme, so\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nTertium Quid, and so are the _Kormoran_\xe2\x80\x99s men. The coast\xe2\x80\x99s clear\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnow or never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more we were traversing the long jetty and the silent streets,\r\nrain driving at our backs. We trod on air, I think; I remember no\r\nfatigue. Davies sometimes broke into a little run, muttering\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cscoundrel\xe2\x80\x9d to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was right\xe2\x80\x94only upside down,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured more than once. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways\r\nreally right\xe2\x80\x94those channels are the key to the whole concern. Chatham,\r\nour only eastern base\xe2\x80\x94no North Sea base or squadron\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99d land at one\r\nof those God-forsaken flats off the Crouch and Blackwater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a wild scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWild? In a way. So is _any_ invasion. But it\xe2\x80\x99s thorough; it\xe2\x80\x99s German.\r\nNo other country could do it. It\xe2\x80\x99s all dawning on me\xe2\x80\x94by Jove! It will\r\nbe at the _Wash_\xe2\x80\x94much the nearest, and as sandy as this side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s Dollmann been?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolite, but queer and jumpy. It\xe2\x80\x99s too long a story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClara?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_She\xe2\x80\x99s_ all right. By Jove! Carruthers\xe2\x80\x94never mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe found a night-bell at the villa door and rang it lustily. A window\r\naloft opened, and \xe2\x80\x9cA message from Commander von Br\xc3\xbcning\xe2\x80\x94urgent,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ncalled up.\r\n\r\nThe window shut, and soon after the hall was lighted and the door\r\nopened by Dollmann in a dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Lieutenant X\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, in English. \xe2\x80\x9cStop, we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nfriends, you fool!\xe2\x80\x9d as the door was flung nearly to. It opened very\r\nslowly again, and we walked in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d he hissed. The sweat stood on his steep forehead and a\r\nhectic flush on either cheek, but there was a smile\xe2\x80\x94what a smile!\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nhis lips. Motioning us to tread noiselessly (a vain ideal for me), he\r\nled the way to the sitting-room we knew, switched on the light, and\r\nfaced us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in English, still smiling.\r\n\r\nI consulted my watch, and I may say that if my hand was an index to my\r\ngeneral appearance, I must have looked the most abject ruffian under\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe probably understand one another,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand to explain is to\r\nlose time. We sail for Holland, or perhaps England, at five at the\r\nlatest, and we want the pleasure of your company. We promise you\r\nimmunity\xe2\x80\x94on certain conditions, which can wait. We have only two\r\nberths, so that we can only accommodate Miss Clara besides yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe smiled on through this terse harangue, but the smile froze, as\r\nthough beneath it raged some crucial debate. Suddenly he laughed (a\r\nlow, ironical laugh).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fools,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou confounded meddlesome young idiots; I\r\nthought I had done with you. Promise me immunity? Give me till five? By\r\nGod, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you five minutes to be off to England and be damned to\r\nyou, or else to be locked up for spies! What the devil do you take me\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA traitor in German service,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, none too firmly. We were\r\nboth taken aback by this slashing attack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tr\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94? You pig-headed young marplots! I\xe2\x80\x99m in _British_ service!\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re wrecking the work of years\xe2\x80\x94and on the very threshold of\r\nsuccess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor an instant Davies and I looked at one another in stupefaction. He\r\nlied\xe2\x80\x94I could swear he lied; but how make sure?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you try to wreck Davies?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw! They made me clear him out. I knew he was safe, and safe he\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing for it\xe2\x80\x94a last finesse, to put him to the\r\nproof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, after a moment or two, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll clear out\xe2\x80\x94silence,\r\nDavies!\xe2\x80\x94as it appears we have acted in error; but it\xe2\x80\x99s right to tell\r\nyou that we know everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so loud, curse you! What do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was taking notes at Memmert the other night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks to Davies. Under difficulties, of course, but I heard quite\r\nenough. You were reporting your English tour\xe2\x80\x94Chatham, you know, and the\r\nEnglish scheme of attack, a mythical one, no doubt, as you\xe2\x80\x99re on the\r\nright side! B\xc3\xb6hme and the rest were dealing with the German scheme of\r\ndefence A to G\xe2\x80\x94I heard it all\xe2\x80\x94the seven islands and the seven channels\r\nbetween them (Davies knows every one of them by heart); and then on\r\nland, the ring of railway, Esens the centre, the army corps to mobilise\r\nand entrench\xe2\x80\x94all nugatory, wasted, ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x94as you\xe2\x80\x99re on the right s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so loud, you fiend of mischief!\xe2\x80\x9d He turned his back, and made an\r\nirresolute pace or two towards the door, his hands kneading the folds\r\nof his dressing-gown as they had kneaded the curtain at Memmert. Twice\r\nhe began a question and twice broke off. \xe2\x80\x9cI congratulate you,\r\ngentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, finally, and with more composure, facing us again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou have done marvels in your misplaced zeal; but you have compromised\r\nme too much already. I shall have to have you arrested\xe2\x80\x94purely for\r\nform\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d I broke in. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have wasted five minutes, and time\r\npresses. We sail at five, and\xe2\x80\x94purely for form\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94would rather have\r\nyou with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he snarled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had the advantage of _you_ at Memmert, in spite of acoustic\r\nobstacles. Your friends made an appointment behind your back, and I, in\r\nmy misplaced zeal, have taken some trouble to attend it; so that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad a working demonstration on another matter, the invasion of England\r\nfrom the seven _siels_.\xe2\x80\x9d (Davies nudged me.) \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I should let that\r\npistol alone; and no, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ring the bell. You can arrest us if\r\nyou like, but the secret\xe2\x80\x99s in safe hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lie!\xe2\x80\x9d He was right there; but he could not know it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose I haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken that precaution? But no names are\r\nmentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave a sort of groan, sank into a chair, and seemed to\r\nage and grizzle before our very eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say about immunity, and Clara?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re friends!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Davies, with a gulp in his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nwant to help you both.\xe2\x80\x9d (Through a sudden mist that filmed my eyes I\r\nsaw him impetuously walk over and lay his hand on the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder.) \xe2\x80\x9cThose chaps are on our track and yours. Come with us. Wake\r\nher, tell her. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be too late soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nX\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 shrank from his touch. \xe2\x80\x9cTell her? I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell her. You tell her,\r\nboy.\xe2\x80\x9d He was huddling back into his chair. Davies turned to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s her room?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbove this one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo up, Carruthers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I\xe2\x80\x94I shall frighten her into a fit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, man! We\xe2\x80\x99ll both go then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make a noise,\xe2\x80\x9d said a dazed voice. We left that huddled figure\r\nand stole upstairs\xe2\x80\x94thickly carpeted stairs, luckily. The door we wanted\r\nwas half open, and the room behind it lighted. On the threshold stood a\r\nslim white figure, bare-footed; bare-throated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, father?\xe2\x80\x9d she called in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cWhom have you been\r\ntalking to?\xe2\x80\x9d I pushed Davies forward, but he hung back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s I, Carruthers, and\r\nDavies\xe2\x80\x94and Davies. May we come in, just for one moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gently widened the opening of the door, while she stepped back and\r\nput one hand to her throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease come to your father,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to take you both to\r\nEngland in the _Dulcibella_\xe2\x80\x94now, at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had heard me, but her eyes wandered to Davies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand not,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered, trembling and cowering in such\r\ntouching bewilderment that I could not bear to look at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, say something, Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClara!\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you not trust us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heard a little gasp from her. There was a flutter of lace and cambric\r\nand she was in his arms, sobbing like a tired child, her little white\r\nfeet between his great clumsy sea-boots\xe2\x80\x94her rose-brown cheek on his\r\nrough jersey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s past four, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, brutally. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going down to\r\nhim again. No packing to speak of, mind. They must be out of this in\r\nhalf an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d I stumbled awkwardly on the stairs (again that tiresome\r\nfilm!) and found him stuffing some papers pell-mell into the stove.\r\nThere were only slumbering embers in it, but he did not seem to notice\r\nthat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be dressed in half an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, furtively\r\npocketing a pistol which lay on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you told her? Take her to England, you two boys. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstay.\xe2\x80\x9d He sank into a chair again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, she won\xe2\x80\x99t go without you. You must, for her sake\xe2\x80\x94in half an\r\nhour, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI prefer to pass that half-hour lightly over. Davies left before me to\r\nprepare the yacht for sea, and I had to bear the brunt of what\r\nfollowed, including (as a mere episode) a scene with the step-mother,\r\nthe memory of which rankles in me yet. After all, she was a sensible\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nAs for the other two, the girl when I saw her next, in her short\r\nboating skirt and tam-o\xe2\x80\x99-shanter, was a miracle of coolness and pluck.\r\nBut for her I should never have got him away. And ah! how good it was\r\nto be out in the wholesome rain again, hurrying to the harbour with my\r\ntwo charges, hurrying them down the greasy ladder to that frail atom of\r\nEnglish soil, their first guerdon of home and safety.\r\n\r\nOur flight from the harbour was unmolested, unnoticed. Only the first\r\nghastly evidences of dawn were mingling with the strangled moonlight,\r\nas we tacked round the pier-head and headed close-reefed down the Riff\r\nGat on the lees of the ebb-tide. We had to pass under the very quarter\r\nof the _Blitz_, so Davies said; for, of course, he alone was on deck\r\ntill we reached the open sea. Day was breaking then. It was dead low\r\nwater, and, far away to the south, between dun swathes of sand, I\r\nthought I saw\xe2\x80\x94but probably it was only a fancy\xe2\x80\x94two black stranded\r\nspecks. Rail awash, and decks streaming, we took the outer swell and\r\nclawed close-hauled under the lee of Juist, westward, hurrying\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp the Ems on the flood, and to Dutch Delfzyl,\xe2\x80\x9d I urged. No, thought\r\nDavies; it was too near Germany, and there was a tidal cut through from\r\nBuse Tief. Better to dodge in behind Rottum Island. So on we pressed,\r\npast Memmert, over the Juister Reef and the _Corinne_\xe2\x80\x99s buried\r\nmillions, across the two broad and yeasty mouths of the Ems, till\r\nRottum, a wee lonesome wafer of an islet, the first of the Dutch\r\narchipelago, was close on the weather-bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must get in behind that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davies, \xe2\x80\x9cthen we shall be safe; I\r\nthink I know the way, but get the next chart; and then take a rest, old\r\nchap. Clara and I can manage.\xe2\x80\x9d (She had been on deck most of the time,\r\nas capable a hand as you could wish for, better far than I in my\r\npresent state of exhaustion.) I crawled along the slippery sloping\r\nplanks and went below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dollmann, starting up from the lee sofa, where he\r\nseemed to have been lying in a sort of trance. A book, his own book,\r\nslipped from his knees, and I saw the frontispiece lying on the floor\r\nin a pool of oil; for the stove had gone adrift, and the saloon was in\r\na wretched state of squalor and litter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOff Rottum,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and knelt up to find the chart. There was a look\r\nin his eyes that I suppose I ought to have understood, but I can\r\nscarcely blame myself, for the accumulated strain, not only of the last\r\nthree days and nights, but of the whole arduous month of my cruise with\r\nDavies, was beginning to tell on me, now that safety and success were\r\nat hand. I handed up the chart through the companion, and then crept\r\ninto the reeling fo\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99sle and lay down on the spare sail-bags, with the\r\nthunder and thump of the seas around and above me.\r\n\r\nI must quote Davies for the event that happened now; for by the time I\r\nhad responded to the alarm and climbed up through the fore-hatch, the\r\nwhole tragedy was over and done with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cX\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 came up the companion,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9csoon after you went down. He\r\nheld on by the runner, and stared to windward at Rottum, as though he\r\nknew the place quite well. And then he came towards us, moving so\r\nunsteadily that I gave Clara the tiller, and went to help him. I tried\r\nto make him go down again, but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and came aft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Give me the helm,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, half to himself. \xe2\x80\x98Sea\xe2\x80\x99s too bad\r\noutside\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a short cut here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Thanks,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98I know this one.\xe2\x80\x99 (I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I meant to be\r\nsarcastic.) He said nothing, and settled himself on the counter behind\r\nus, safe enough, with his feet against the lee-rail, and then, to my\r\nastonishment, began to talk over my shoulder jolly sensibly about the\r\ncourse, pointing out a buoy which is wrong on the chart (as I knew),\r\nand telling me it was wrong, and so on. Well, we came to the bar of the\r\nSchild, and had to turn south for that twisty bit of beating between\r\nRottum and Bosch Flat. Clara was at the jib-sheet, I had the chart and\r\nthe tiller (you know how absent I get like that); there was a bobble of\r\nsea, and we both had heaps to do, and\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94I happened to look round,\r\nand he was gone. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken for a minute or two, but I believe\r\nthe last thing I heard him say (I was hardly attending at the time, for\r\nwe were in the thick of it) was something about a \xe2\x80\x98short cut\xe2\x80\x99 again. He\r\nmust have slipped over quietly.... He had an ulster and big boots on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe cruised about for a time, but never found him.\r\n\r\nThat evening, after threading the maze of shoals between the Dutch\r\nmainland and islands, we anchored off the little hamlet of Ostmahorn,\r\n_[See Map A]_ gave the yacht in charge of some astonished fishermen,\r\nand thence by road and rail, hurrying still, gained Harlingen, and took\r\npassage on a steamer to London. From that point our personal history is\r\nof no concern to the outside world, and here, therefore, I bring this\r\nnarrative to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilogue\r\n\r\nBY THE EDITOR\r\n\r\n\r\n[For this chapter see Map A.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting document, somewhat damaged by fire, lies on my study\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nIt is a copy (in cipher) of a confidential memorandum to the German\r\nGovernment embodying a scheme for the invasion of England by Germany.\r\nIt is unsigned, but internal evidence, and the fact that it was taken\r\nby Mr \xe2\x80\x9cCarruthers\xe2\x80\x9d from the stove of the villa at Norderney, leave no\r\ndoubt as to its authorship. For many reasons it is out of the question\r\nto print the textual translation of it, as deciphered; but I propose to\r\ngive an outline of its contents.\r\n\r\nEven this must strain discretion to its uttermost limits, and had I\r\nonly to consider the instructed few who follow the trend of\r\nprofessional opinion on such subjects, I should leave the foregoing\r\nnarrative to speak for itself. But, as was stated in the preface, our\r\nprimary purpose is to reach everyone; and there may be many who, in\r\nspite of able and authoritative warnings frequently uttered since these\r\nevents occurred, are still prone to treat the German danger as an idle\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbogey\xe2\x80\x9d, and may be disposed, in this case, to imagine that a baseless\r\nromance has been foisted on them.\r\n\r\nA few persons (English as well as German) hold that Germany is strong\r\nenough now to meet us single-handed, and throw an army on our shores.\r\nThe memorandum rejects this view, deferring isolated action for at\r\nleast a decade; and supposing, for present purposes, a coalition of\r\nthree Powers against Great Britain. And subsequent researches through\r\nthe usual channels place it beyond dispute that this condition was\r\nrelied on by the German Government in adopting the scheme. They\r\nrealised that even if, owing to our widely scattered forces, they\r\ngained that temporary command of the North Sea which would be essential\r\nfor a successful landing, they would inevitably lose it when our\r\nstanding fleets were concentrated and our reserve ships mobilised. With\r\nits sea-communications cut, the prospects of the invading army would be\r\ntoo dubious. I state it in that mild way, for it seems not to have been\r\nheld that failure was absolutely certain; and rightly, I think, in\r\nspite of the dogmas of the strategists\xe2\x80\x94for the ease transcends all\r\nexperience. No man can calculate the effect on our delicate economic\r\nfabric of a well-timed, well-planned blow at the industrial heart of\r\nthe kingdom, the great northern and midland towns, with their teeming\r\npopulations of peaceful wage-earners. In this instance, however, joint\r\naction (the occasion for which is perhaps not difficult to guess) was\r\ndistinctly contemplated, and Germany\xe2\x80\x99s _r\xc3\xb4le_ in the coalition was\r\nexclusively that of invader. Her fleet was to be kept intact, and she\r\nherself to remain ostensibly neutral until the first shock was over,\r\nand our own battle-fleets either beaten, or, the much more likely\r\nevent, so crippled by a hard-won victory as to be incapable of\r\nwithstanding compact and unscathed forces. Then, holding the balance of\r\npower, she would strike. And the blow? It was not till I read this\r\nmemorandum that I grasped the full merits of that daring scheme, under\r\nwhich every advantage, moral, material, and geographical, possessed by\r\nGermany, is utilised to the utmost, and every disadvantage of our own\r\nturned to account against us.\r\n\r\nTwo root principles pervade it: perfect organisation; perfect secrecy.\r\nUnder the first head come some general considerations. The writer (who\r\nis intimately conversant with conditions on both sides of the North\r\nSea) argued that Germany is pre-eminently fitted to undertake an\r\ninvasion of Great Britain. She has a great army (a mere fraction of\r\nwhich would suffice) in a state of high efficiency, but a useless\r\nweapon, as against us, unless transported over seas. She has a peculiar\r\ngenius for organisation, not only in elaborating minute detail, but in\r\nthe grasp of a coherent whole. She knows the art of giving a brain to a\r\nmachine, of transmitting power to the uttermost cog-wheel, and at the\r\nsame time of concentrating responsibility in a supreme centre. She has\r\na small navy, but very effective for its purpose, built, trained, and\r\nmanned on methodical principles, for defined ends, and backed by an\r\ninexhaustible reserve of men from her maritime conscription. She\r\nstudies and practises co-operation between her army and navy. Her hands\r\nare free for offence in home waters, since she has no distant network\r\nof coveted colonies and dependencies on which to dissipate her\r\ndefensive energies. Finally, she is, compared with ourselves,\r\neconomically independent, having commercial access through her land\r\nfrontiers to the whole of Europe. She has little to lose and much to\r\ngain.\r\n\r\nThe writer pauses here to contrast our own situation, and I summarise\r\nhis points. We have a small army, dispersed over the whole globe, and\r\nadministered on a gravely defective system. We have no settled theory\r\nof national defence, and no competent authority whose business it is to\r\ngive us one. The matter is still at the stage of civilian controversy.\r\nCo-operation between the army and navy is not studied and practised;\r\nmuch less do there exist any plans, worthy of the name, for the repulse\r\nof an invasion, or any readiness worth considering for the prompt\r\nequipment and direction of our home forces to meet a sudden emergency.\r\nWe have a great and, in many respects, a magnificent navy, but not\r\ngreat enough for the interests it insures, and with equally defective\r\ninstitutions; not built or manned methodically, having an utterly\r\ninadequate reserve of men, all classes of which would be absorbed at\r\nthe very outset, without a vestige of preparation for the enrolment of\r\nvolunteers; distracted by the multiplicity of its functions in guarding\r\nour colossal empire and commerce, and conspicuously lacking a brain,\r\nnot merely for the smooth control of its own unwieldy mechanism, but\r\nfor the study of rival aims and systems. We have no North Sea naval\r\nbase, no North Sea Fleet, and no North Sea policy. Lastly, we stand in\r\na highly dangerous economical position.\r\n\r\nThe writer then deals with the method of invasion, and rejects the\r\nobvious one at once, that of sending forth a fleet of transports from\r\none or more of the North Sea ports. He combats especially the idea of\r\nmaking Emden (the nearest to our shores) the port of departure. I\r\nmention this because, since his own scheme was adopted, it is\r\ninstructive to note that Emden had been used (with caution) as a red\r\nherring by the inspired German press, when the subject was mentioned at\r\nall, and industriously dragged across the trail. His objections to the\r\nNorth Sea ports apply, he remarks, in reality to all schemes of\r\ninvasion, whether the conditions be favourable or not. One is that\r\nsecrecy is rendered impossible\xe2\x80\x94and secrecy is vital. The collection of\r\nthe transports would be known in England weeks before the hour was ripe\r\nfor striking; for all large ports are cosmopolitan and swarm with\r\npotential spies. In Germany\xe2\x80\x99s case, moreover, suitable ships are none\r\ntoo plentiful, and the number required would entail a large deduction\r\nfrom her mercantile marine. The other reason concerns the actual\r\nlanding. This must take place on an open part of the east coast of\r\nEngland. No other objective is even considered. Now the difficulty of\r\ntransshipping and landing troops by boats from transports anchored in\r\ndeep water, in a safe, swift, and orderly fashion, on an open beach, is\r\nenormous. The most hastily improvised resistance might cause a\r\nhumiliating disaster. Yet the first stage is the most important of all.\r\nIt is imperative that the invaders should seize and promptly intrench a\r\npre-arranged line of country, to serve as an initial base. This once\r\ndone, they can use other resources; they can bring up transports, land\r\ncavalry and heavy guns, pour in stores, and advance. But unless this is\r\ndone, they are impotent, be their sea-communications never so secure.\r\n\r\nThe only logical alternative is then propounded: to despatch an army of\r\ninfantry with the lightest type of field-guns in big sea-going\r\nlighters, towed by powerful but shallow-draught tugs, under escort of a\r\npowerful composite squadron of warships; and to fling the flotilla, at\r\nhigh tide, if possible, straight upon the shore.\r\n\r\nSuch an expedition could be prepared in absolute secrecy, by turning to\r\naccount the natural features of the German coast. No great port was to\r\nbe concerned in any way. All that was required was sufficient depth of\r\nwater to float the lighters and tugs; and this is supplied by seven\r\ninsignificant streams, issuing from the Frisian littoral, and already\r\nfurnished with small harbours and sluice-gates, with one exception,\r\nnamely, the tidal creek at Norden; for this, it appeared, was one of\r\nthe chosen seven, and not, as \xe2\x80\x9cCarruthers\xe2\x80\x9d supposed, Hilgenriedersiel,\r\nwhich, if you remember, he had no time to visit, and which has, in\r\nfact, no stream of any value at all, and no harbour. All of these\r\nstreams would have to be improved, deepened, and generally canalised;\r\nostensibly with a commercial end, for purposes of traffic with the\r\nislands, which are growing health resorts during a limited summer\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe whole expedition would be organised under seven distinct\r\nsub-divisions\xe2\x80\x94not too great a number in view of its cumbrous character.\r\nSeawards, the whole of the coast is veiled by the fringe of islands and\r\nthe zone of shoals. Landwards, the loop of railway round the Frisian\r\npeninsula would form the line of communication in rear of the seven\r\nstreams. Esens was to be the local centre of administration when the\r\nscheme grew to maturity, but not till then. Every detail for the\r\nmovement of troops under the seven different heads was to be arranged\r\nfor with secrecy and exactitude many months in advance, and from\r\nheadquarters at Berlin. It was not expected that nothing would leak\r\nout, but care was to be taken that anything that did do so should be\r\nattributed to defensive measures\xe2\x80\x94a standing feature in German\r\nmobilisation being the establishment of a corps of observation along\r\nthe Frisian coast; in fact, the same machinery was to be used, and its\r\nconversion for offence concealed up to the latest possible moment. The\r\nsame precautions were to be taken in the preliminary work on the spot.\r\nThere, four men only (it was calculated) need be in full possession of\r\nthe secret. One was to represent the Imperial Navy (a post filled by\r\nour friend von Br\xc3\xbcning). Another (B\xc3\xb6hme) was to superintend the six\r\ncanals and the construction of the lighters. The functions of the third\r\nwere twofold. He was to organise what I may call the local labour\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis, the helpers required for embarkation, the crews of the tugs, and,\r\nmost important of all, the service of pilots for the navigation of the\r\nseven flotillas through the corresponding channels to the open sea. He\r\nmust be a local man, thoroughly acquainted with the coast, of a social\r\nstanding not much above the average of villagers and fishermen, and he\r\nmust be ready when the time was ripe with lists of the right men for\r\nthe right duties, lists to which the conscription authorities could\r\nwhen required, give instant legal effect. His other function was to\r\npolice the coast for spies, and to report anything suspicious to von\r\nBr\xc3\xbcning, who would never be far away. On the whole I think that they\r\nfound the grim Grimm a jewel for their purpose.\r\n\r\nAs fourth personage, the writer designates himself, the promoter of the\r\nscheme, the indispensable link between the two nations. He undertakes\r\nto furnish reliable information as to the disposition of troops in\r\nEngland, as to the hydrography of the coast selected for the landing,\r\nas to the supplies available in its vicinity, and the strategic points\r\nto be seized. He proposes to be guide-in-chief to the expedition during\r\ntransit. And in the meantime (when not otherwise employed) he was to\r\nreside at Norderney, in close touch with the other three, and\r\ncontrolling the commercial undertakings which were to throw dust in the\r\neyes of the curious. [Memmert, by the way, is not mentioned in this\r\nmemorandum.]\r\n\r\nHe speaks of the place \xe2\x80\x9cselected for the landing\xe2\x80\x9d, and proceeds to\r\nconsider this question in detail. I cannot follow him in his review,\r\ndeeply interesting though it is, and shall say at once that he reduces\r\npossible landing-places to two, the flats on the Essex coast between\r\nFoulness and Brightlingsea, and the Wash\xe2\x80\x94with a decided preference for\r\nthe latter. Assuming that the enemy, if they got wind of an invasion at\r\nall, would expect transports to be employed, he chooses the sort of\r\nspot which they would be least likely to defend, and which,\r\nnevertheless, was suitable to the character of the flotillas, and\r\nsimilar to the region they started from. There is such a spot on the\r\nLincolnshire coast, on the north side of the Wash, _[See Map A]_ known\r\nas East Holland. It is low-lying land, dyked against the sea, and\r\nbordered like Frisia with sand-flats which dry off at low water. It is\r\neasy of access from the east, by way of Boston Deeps, a deep-water\r\nchannel formed by a detached bank, called the Long Sand, lying parallel\r\nto the shore for ten miles. This bank makes a natural breakwater\r\nagainst the swell from the east (the only quarter to be feared); and\r\nthe Deeps behind it, where there is an average depth of thirty-four\r\nfeet at low-water, would form an excellent roadstead for the covering\r\nsquadron, whose guns would command the shore within easy range. It is\r\nnoted in passing that this is just the case where German first-class\r\nbattleships would have an advantage over British ships of the same\r\ncalibre. The latter are of just too heavy a draught to navigate such\r\nwaters without peril, if, indeed, they could enter this roadstead at\r\nall, for there is a bar at the mouth of it with only thirty-one feet at\r\nhigh water, spring tides. The former, built as they were with a view to\r\nman\xc5\x93uvring in the North Sea, are just within the margin of safety. East\r\nHolland is within easy striking distance of the manufacturing\r\ndistricts, a vigorous raid on which is, the writer urges, the true\r\npolicy of an invader. He reports positively that there exist (in a\r\nproper military sense) no preparations whatever to meet such an attack.\r\nEast Holland is also the nearest point on the British shores to\r\nGermany, excepting the coast of Norfolk; much nearer, indeed, than the\r\nEssex flats alluded to, and reached by a simple deep-sea passage,\r\nwithout any dangerous region to navigate, like the mouth of the Channel\r\nand the estuary of the Thames from Harwich westwards. The distance is\r\n240 sea-miles, west by south roughly, from Borkum Island, and 280 from\r\nWangeroog. The time estimated for transit after the flotillas had been\r\nassembled outside the islands is from thirty to thirty-four hours.\r\n\r\nEmbarkation is the next topic. This could and must be effected in one\r\ntide. At the six _siels_ there was a mean period of two and a half\r\nhours in every twelve, during which the water was high enough. At\r\nNorden a rather longer time was available. But this should be amply\r\nsufficient if the machinery were in good working order and were\r\npunctually set in motion. High water occurs approximately at the same\r\ntime at all seven outlets, the difference between the two farthest\r\napart, Carolinensiel and Greetsiel, being only half an hour.\r\n\r\nLastly, the special risks attendant on such an expedition are\r\ndispassionately weighed. X\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, though keenly anxious to recommend his\r\nscheme, writes in no blindly sanguine spirit. There are no modern\r\nprecedents for any invasion in the least degree comparable to that of\r\nEngland by Germany. Any such attempt will be a hazardous experiment.\r\nBut he argues that the advantages of his method outweigh the risks, and\r\nthat most of the risks themselves would attach equally to any other\r\nmethod. Whatever skill in prediction was used, bad weather might\r\novertake the expedition. Yes; but if transports were used transhipment\r\ninto boats for landing would in bad weather be fraught with the same\r\nand a greater peril. But transports could stand off and wait. Delay is\r\nfatal in any case; unswerving promptitude is the essence of such an\r\nenterprise. The lighters would be in danger of foundering? Beside the\r\npoint; if the end is worth gaining the risks must be faced. Soldiers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlives are sacrificed in tens of thousands on battlefields. The flotilla\r\nwould be demoralised during transit by the assault of a few\r\ntorpedo-boats? Granted; but the same would apply to a fleet of\r\ntransports, with the added certainty that one lucky shot would send to\r\nthe bottom ten times the number of soldiers, with less hope of rescue.\r\nIn both cases reliance must be placed on the efficiency and vigilance\r\nof the escort. It is admitted, however, in a passage which might well\r\nmake my two adventurers glow with triumph, that if by any mischance the\r\nBritish discovered what was afoot in good time, and were able to send\r\nover a swarm of light-draught boats, which could elude the German\r\nwarships and get amongst the flotillas while they were still in process\r\nof leaving the siels; it is admitted that in that case the expedition\r\nwas doomed. But it is held that such an event was not to be feared.\r\nReckless pluck is abundant in the British Navy, but expert knowledge of\r\nthe tides and shoals in these waters is utterly lacking. The British\r\ncharts are of no value, and there is no evidence (he reports) that the\r\nsubject has been studied in any way by the British Admiralty. Let me\r\nremark here, that I believe Mr \xe2\x80\x9cDavies\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d views, as expressed in the\r\nearlier chapters, when they were still among the great estuaries, are\r\nall absolutely sound. The \xe2\x80\x9cchannel theory\xe2\x80\x9d, though it only bore\r\nindirectly on the grand issue before them, was true, and should be laid\r\nto heart, or I should not have wasted space on it.\r\n\r\nOne word more, in conclusion. There is an axiom, much in fashion now,\r\nthat there is no fear of an invasion of the British Isles, because if\r\nwe lose command of the sea, we can be starved\xe2\x80\x94a cheaper and surer way\r\nof reducing us to submission. It is a loose, valueless axiom, but by\r\nsheer repetition it is becoming an article of faith. It implies that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccommand of the sea\xe2\x80\x9d is a thing to be won or lost definitely; that we\r\nmay have it to-day and lose it for ever to-morrow. On the contrary, the\r\nchances are that in anything like an even struggle the command of the\r\nsea will hang in the balance for an indefinite time. And even against\r\ngreat odds, it would probably be impossible for our enemies so to bar\r\nthe avenues of our commerce, so to blockade the ports of our extensive\r\ncoast-line, and so to overcome the interest which neutrals will have in\r\nsupplying us, as to bring us to our knees in less than two years,\r\nduring which time we can be recuperating and rebuilding from our unique\r\ninternal resources, and endeavouring to regain command.\r\n\r\nNo; the better axiom is that nothing short of a successful invasion\r\ncould finally compel us to make peace. Our hearts are stout, we hope;\r\nbut facts are facts; and a successful raid, such as that here sketched,\r\nif you will think out its consequences, must appal the stoutest heart.\r\nIt was checkmated, but others may be conceived. In any case, we know\r\nthe way in which they look at these things in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostscript (March 1903)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt so happens that while this book was in the press a number of\r\nmeasures have been taken by the Government to counteract some of the\r\nvery weaknesses and dangers which are alluded to above. A Committee of\r\nNational Defence has been set up, and the welcome given to it was a\r\ntruly extraordinary comment on the apathy and confusion which it is\r\ndesigned to supplant. A site on the Forth has been selected for a new\r\nNorth Sea naval base\xe2\x80\x94an excellent if tardy decision; for ten years or\r\nso must elapse before the existing anchorage becomes in any sense a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbase\xe2\x80\x9d. A North Sea fleet has also been created\xe2\x80\x94another good measure;\r\nbut it should be remembered that its ships are not modern, or in the\r\nleast capable of meeting the principal German squadrons under the\r\ncircumstances supposed above.\r\n\r\nLastly, a Manning Committee has (among other matters) reported vaguely\r\nin favour of a Volunteer Reserve. There is no means of knowing what\r\nthis recommendation will lead to; let us hope not to the fiasco of the\r\nlast badly conceived experiment. Is it not becoming patent that the\r\ntime has come for training all Englishmen systematically either for the\r\nsea or for the rifle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RIDDLE OF THE SANDS ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
