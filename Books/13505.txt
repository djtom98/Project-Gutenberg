Ivan Andreitch Laevsky, a thin,\r\nfair young man of twenty-eight, wearing the cap of a clerk in the\r\nMinistry of Finance and with slippers on his feet, coming down to\r\nbathe, found a number of acquaintances on the beach, and among them\r\nhis friend Samoylenko, the army doctor.\r\n\r\nWith his big cropped head, short neck, his red face, his big nose,\r\nhis shaggy black eyebrows and grey whiskers, his stout puffy figure\r\nand his hoarse military bass, this Samoylenko made on every newcomer\r\nthe unpleasant impression of a gruff bully; but two or three days\r\nafter making his acquaintance, one began to think his face\r\nextraordinarily good-natured, kind, and even handsome. In spite of\r\nhis clumsiness and rough manner, he was a peaceable man, of infinite\r\nkindliness and goodness of heart, always ready to be of use. He was\r\non familiar terms with every one in the town, lent every one money,\r\ndoctored every one, made matches, patched up quarrels, arranged\r\npicnics at which he cooked _shashlik_ and an awfully good soup of\r\ngrey mullets. He was always looking after other people\'s affairs\r\nand trying to interest some one on their behalf, and was always\r\ndelighted about something. The general opinion about him was that\r\nhe was without faults of character. He had only two weaknesses: he\r\nwas ashamed of his own good nature, and tried to disguise it by a\r\nsurly expression and an assumed gruffness; and he liked his assistants\r\nand his soldiers to call him "Your Excellency," although he was\r\nonly a civil councillor.\r\n\r\n"Answer one question for me, Alexandr Daviditch," Laevsky began,\r\nwhen both he and Samoylenko were in the water up to their shoulders.\r\n"Suppose you had loved a woman and had been living with her for two\r\nor three years, and then left off caring for her, as one does, and\r\nbegan to feel that you had nothing in common with her. How would\r\nyou behave in that case?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s very simple. \'You go where you please, madam\'--and that\r\nwould be the end of it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s easy to say that! But if she has nowhere to go? A woman with\r\nno friends or relations, without a farthing, who can\'t work . . ."\r\n\r\n"Well? Five hundred roubles down or an allowance of twenty-five\r\nroubles a month--and nothing more. It\'s very simple."\r\n\r\n"Even supposing you have five hundred roubles and can pay twenty-five\r\nroubles a month, the woman I am speaking of is an educated woman\r\nand proud. Could you really bring yourself to offer her money? And\r\nhow would you do it?"\r\n\r\nSamoylenko was going to answer, but at that moment a big wave covered\r\nthem both, then broke on the beach and rolled back noisily over the\r\nshingle. The friends got out and began dressing.\r\n\r\n"Of course, it is difficult to live with a woman if you don\'t love\r\nher," said Samoylenko, shaking the sand out of his boots. "But one\r\nmust look at the thing humanely, Vanya. If it were my case, I should\r\nnever show a sign that I did not love her, and I should go on living\r\nwith her till I died."\r\n\r\nHe was at once ashamed of his own words; he pulled himself up and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"But for aught I care, there might be no females at all. Let them\r\nall go to the devil!"\r\n\r\nThe friends dressed and went into the pavilion. There Samoylenko\r\nwas quite at home, and even had a special cup and saucer. Every\r\nmorning they brought him on a tray a cup of coffee, a tall cut glass\r\nof iced water, and a tiny glass of brandy. He would first drink the\r\nbrandy, then the hot coffee, then the iced water, and this must\r\nhave been very nice, for after drinking it his eyes looked moist\r\nwith pleasure, he would stroke his whiskers with both hands, and\r\nsay, looking at the sea:\r\n\r\n"A wonderfully magnificent view!"\r\n\r\nAfter a long night spent in cheerless, unprofitable thoughts which\r\nprevented him from sleeping, and seemed to intensify the darkness\r\nand sultriness of the night, Laevsky felt listless and shattered.\r\nHe felt no better for the bathe and the coffee.\r\n\r\n"Let us go on with our talk, Alexandr Daviditch," he said. "I won\'t\r\nmake a secret of it; I\'ll speak to you openly as to a friend. Things\r\nare in a bad way with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and me . . . a very bad\r\nway! Forgive me for forcing my private affairs upon you, but I must\r\nspeak out."\r\n\r\nSamoylenko, who had a misgiving of what he was going to speak about,\r\ndropped his eyes and drummed with his fingers on the table.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve lived with her for two years and have ceased to love her,"\r\nLaevsky went on; "or, rather, I realised that I never had felt any\r\nlove for her. . . . These two years have been a mistake."\r\n\r\nIt was Laevsky\'s habit as he talked to gaze attentively at the pink\r\npalms of his hands, to bite his nails, or to pinch his cuffs. And\r\nhe did so now.\r\n\r\n"I know very well you can\'t help me," he said. "But I tell you,\r\nbecause unsuccessful and superfluous people like me find their\r\nsalvation in talking. I have to generalise about everything I do.\r\nI\'m bound to look for an explanation and justification of my absurd\r\nexistence in somebody else\'s theories, in literary types--in the\r\nidea that we, upper-class Russians, are degenerating, for instance,\r\nand so on. Last night, for example, I comforted myself by thinking\r\nall the time: \'Ah, how true Tolstoy is, how mercilessly true!\' And\r\nthat did me good. Yes, really, brother, he is a great writer, say\r\nwhat you like!"\r\n\r\nSamoylenko, who had never read Tolstoy and was intending to do so\r\nevery day of his life, was a little embarrassed, and said:\r\n\r\n"Yes, all other authors write from imagination, but he writes\r\nstraight from nature."\r\n\r\n"My God!" sighed Laevsky; "how distorted we all are by civilisation!\r\nI fell in love with a married woman and she with me. . . . To begin\r\nwith, we had kisses, and calm evenings, and vows, and Spencer, and\r\nideals, and interests in common. . . . What a deception! We really\r\nran away from her husband, but we lied to ourselves and made out\r\nthat we ran away from the emptiness of the life of the educated\r\nclass. We pictured our future like this: to begin with, in the\r\nCaucasus, while we were getting to know the people and the place,\r\nI would put on the Government uniform and enter the service; then\r\nat our leisure we would pick out a plot of ground, would toil in\r\nthe sweat of our brow, would have a vineyard and a field, and so\r\non. If you were in my place, or that zoologist of yours, Von Koren,\r\nyou might live with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna for thirty years, perhaps,\r\nand might leave your heirs a rich vineyard and three thousand acres\r\nof maize; but I felt like a bankrupt from the first day. In the\r\ntown you have insufferable heat, boredom, and no society; if you\r\ngo out into the country, you fancy poisonous spiders, scorpions,\r\nor snakes lurking under every stone and behind every bush, and\r\nbeyond the fields--mountains and the desert. Alien people, an\r\nalien country, a wretched form of civilisation--all that is not\r\nso easy, brother, as walking on the Nevsky Prospect in one\'s fur\r\ncoat, arm-in-arm with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, dreaming of the sunny\r\nSouth. What is needed here is a life and death struggle, and I\'m\r\nnot a fighting man. A wretched neurasthenic, an idle gentleman\r\n. . . . From the first day I knew that my dreams of a life of labour\r\nand of a vineyard were worthless. As for love, I ought to tell you\r\nthat living with a woman who has read Spencer and has followed you\r\nto the ends of the earth is no more interesting than living with\r\nany Anfissa or Akulina. There\'s the same smell of ironing, of powder,\r\nand of medicines, the same curl-papers every morning, the same\r\nself-deception."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t get on in the house without an iron," said Samoylenko,\r\nblushing at Laevsky\'s speaking to him so openly of a lady he knew.\r\n"You are out of humour to-day, Vanya, I notice. Nadyezhda Fyodorovna\r\nis a splendid woman, highly educated, and you are a man of the\r\nhighest intellect. Of course, you are not married," Samoylenko went\r\non, glancing round at the adjacent tables, "but that\'s not your\r\nfault; and besides . . . one ought to be above conventional prejudices\r\nand rise to the level of modern ideas. I believe in free love myself,\r\nyes. . . . But to my thinking, once you have settled together, you\r\nought to go on living together all your life."\r\n\r\n"Without love?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you directly," said Samoylenko. "Eight years ago there\r\nwas an old fellow, an agent, here--a man of very great intelligence.\r\nWell, he used to say that the great thing in married life was\r\npatience. Do you hear, Vanya? Not love, but patience. Love cannot\r\nlast long. You have lived two years in love, and now evidently your\r\nmarried life has reached the period when, in order to preserve\r\nequilibrium, so to speak, you ought to exercise all your\r\npatience. . . ."\r\n\r\n"You believe in your old agent; to me his words are meaningless.\r\nYour old man could be a hypocrite; he could exercise himself in the\r\nvirtue of patience, and, as he did so, look upon a person he did\r\nnot love as an object indispensable for his moral exercises; but I\r\nhave not yet fallen so low. If I want to exercise myself in patience,\r\nI will buy dumb-bells or a frisky horse, but I\'ll leave human beings\r\nalone."\r\n\r\nSamoylenko asked for some white wine with ice. When they had drunk\r\na glass each, Laevsky suddenly asked:\r\n\r\n"Tell me, please, what is the meaning of softening of the brain?"\r\n\r\n"How can I explain it to you? . . . It\'s a disease in which the\r\nbrain becomes softer . . . as it were, dissolves."\r\n\r\n"Is it curable?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if the disease is not neglected. Cold douches, blisters. . . .\r\nSomething internal, too."\r\n\r\n"Oh! . . . Well, you see my position; I can\'t live with her: it is\r\nmore than I can do. While I\'m with you I can be philosophical about\r\nit and smile, but at home I lose heart completely; I am so utterly\r\nmiserable, that if I were told, for instance, that I should have\r\nto live another month with her, I should blow out my brains. At the\r\nsame time, parting with her is out of the question. She has no\r\nfriends or relations; she cannot work, and neither she nor I have\r\nany money. . . . What could become of her? To whom could she go?\r\nThere is nothing one can think of. . . . Come, tell me, what am I\r\nto do?"\r\n\r\n"H\'m! . . ." growled Samoylenko, not knowing what to answer. "Does\r\nshe love you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she loves me in so far as at her age and with her temperament\r\nshe wants a man. It would be as difficult for her to do without me\r\nas to do without her powder or her curl-papers. I am for her an\r\nindispensable, integral part of her boudoir."\r\n\r\nSamoylenko was embarrassed.\r\n\r\n"You are out of humour to-day, Vanya," he said. "You must have had\r\na bad night."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I slept badly. . . . Altogether, I feel horribly out of sorts,\r\nbrother. My head feels empty; there\'s a sinking at my heart, a\r\nweakness. . . . I must run away."\r\n\r\n"Run where?"\r\n\r\n"There, to the North. To the pines and the mushrooms, to people and\r\nideas. . . . I\'d give half my life to bathe now in some little\r\nstream in the province of Moscow or Tula; to feel chilly, you know,\r\nand then to stroll for three hours even with the feeblest student,\r\nand to talk and talk endlessly. . . . And the scent of the hay! Do\r\nyou remember it? And in the evening, when one walks in the garden,\r\nsounds of the piano float from the house; one hears the train\r\npassing. . . ."\r\n\r\nLaevsky laughed with pleasure; tears came into his eyes, and to\r\ncover them, without getting up, he stretched across the next table\r\nfor the matches.\r\n\r\n"I have not been in Russia for eighteen years," said Samoylenko.\r\n"I\'ve forgotten what it is like. To my mind, there is not a country\r\nmore splendid than the Caucasus."\r\n\r\n"Vereshtchagin has a picture in which some men condemned to death\r\nare languishing at the bottom of a very deep well. Your magnificent\r\nCaucasus strikes me as just like that well. If I were offered the\r\nchoice of a chimney-sweep in Petersburg or a prince in the Caucasus,\r\nI should choose the job of chimney-sweep."\r\n\r\nLaevsky grew pensive. Looking at his stooping figure, at his eyes\r\nfixed dreamily at one spot, at his pale, perspiring face and sunken\r\ntemples, at his bitten nails, at the slipper which had dropped off\r\nhis heel, displaying a badly darned sock, Samoylenko was moved to\r\npity, and probably because Laevsky reminded him of a helpless child,\r\nhe asked:\r\n\r\n"Is your mother living?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but we are on bad terms. She could not forgive me for this\r\naffair."\r\n\r\nSamoylenko was fond of his friend. He looked upon Laevsky as a\r\ngood-natured fellow, a student, a man with no nonsense about him,\r\nwith whom one could drink, and laugh, and talk without reserve.\r\nWhat he understood in him he disliked extremely. Laevsky drank a\r\ngreat deal and at unsuitable times; he played cards, despised his\r\nwork, lived beyond his means, frequently made use of unseemly\r\nexpressions in conversation, walked about the streets in his slippers,\r\nand quarrelled with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna before other people--and\r\nSamoylenko did not like this. But the fact that Laevsky had once\r\nbeen a student in the Faculty of Arts, subscribed to two fat reviews,\r\noften talked so cleverly that only a few people understood him, was\r\nliving with a well-educated woman--all this Samoylenko did not\r\nunderstand, and he liked this and respected Laevsky, thinking him\r\nsuperior to himself.\r\n\r\n"There is another point," said Laevsky, shaking his head. "Only it\r\nis between ourselves. I\'m concealing it from Nadyezhda Fyodorovna\r\nfor the time. . . . Don\'t let it out before her. . . . I got a\r\nletter the day before yesterday, telling me that her husband has\r\ndied from softening of the brain."\r\n\r\n"The Kingdom of Heaven be his!" sighed Samoylenko. "Why are you\r\nconcealing it from her?"\r\n\r\n"To show her that letter would be equivalent to \'Come to church to\r\nbe married.\' And we should first have to make our relations clear.\r\nWhen she understands that we can\'t go on living together, I will\r\nshow her the letter. Then there will be no danger in it."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what, Vanya," said Samoylenko, and a sad and imploring\r\nexpression came into his face, as though he were going to ask him\r\nabout something very touching and were afraid of being refused.\r\n"Marry her, my dear boy!"\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Do your duty to that splendid woman! Her husband is dead, and so\r\nProvidence itself shows you what to do!"\r\n\r\n"But do understand, you queer fellow, that it is impossible. To\r\nmarry without love is as base and unworthy of a man as to perform\r\nmass without believing in it."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s your duty to."\r\n\r\n"Why is it my duty?" Laevsky asked irritably.\r\n\r\n"Because you took her away from her husband and made yourself\r\nresponsible for her."\r\n\r\n"But now I tell you in plain Russian, I don\'t love her!"\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'ve no love, show her proper respect, consider her\r\nwishes. . . ."\r\n\r\n"\'Show her respect, consider her wishes,\'" Laevsky mimicked him.\r\n"As though she were some Mother Superior! . . . You are a poor\r\npsychologist and physiologist if you think that living with a woman\r\none can get off with nothing but respect and consideration. What a\r\nwoman thinks most of is her bedroom."\r\n\r\n"Vanya, Vanya!" said Samoylenko, overcome with confusion.\r\n\r\n"You are an elderly child, a theorist, while I am an old man in\r\nspite of my years, and practical, and we shall never understand one\r\nanother. We had better drop this conversation. Mustapha!" Laevsky\r\nshouted to the waiter. "What\'s our bill?"\r\n\r\n"No, no . . ." the doctor cried in dismay, clutching Laevsky\'s arm.\r\n"It is for me to pay. I ordered it. Make it out to me," he cried\r\nto Mustapha.\r\n\r\nThe friends got up and walked in silence along the sea-front. When\r\nthey reached the boulevard, they stopped and shook hands at parting.\r\n\r\n"You are awfully spoilt, my friend!" Samoylenko sighed. "Fate has\r\nsent you a young, beautiful, cultured woman, and you refuse the\r\ngift, while if God were to give me a crooked old woman, how pleased\r\nI should be if only she were kind and affectionate! I would live\r\nwith her in my vineyard and . . ."\r\n\r\nSamoylenko caught himself up and said:\r\n\r\n"And she might get the samovar ready for me there, the old hag."\r\n\r\nAfter parting with Laevsky he walked along the boulevard. When,\r\nbulky and majestic, with a stern expression on his face, he walked\r\nalong the boulevard in his snow-white tunic and superbly polished\r\nboots, squaring his chest, decorated with the Vladimir cross on a\r\nribbon, he was very much pleased with himself, and it seemed as\r\nthough the whole world were looking at him with pleasure. Without\r\nturning his head, he looked to each side and thought that the\r\nboulevard was extremely well laid out; that the young cypress-trees,\r\nthe eucalyptuses, and the ugly, anemic palm-trees were very handsome\r\nand would in time give abundant shade; that the Circassians were\r\nan honest and hospitable people.\r\n\r\n"It\'s strange that Laevsky does not like the Caucasus," he thought,\r\n"very strange."\r\n\r\nFive soldiers, carrying rifles, met him and saluted him. On the\r\nright side of the boulevard the wife of a local official was walking\r\nalong the pavement with her son, a schoolboy.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Marya Konstantinovna," Samoylenko shouted to her\r\nwith a pleasant smile. "Have you been to bathe? Ha, ha, ha! . . .\r\nMy respects to Nikodim Alexandritch!"\r\n\r\nAnd he went on, still smiling pleasantly, but seeing an assistant\r\nof the military hospital coming towards him, he suddenly frowned,\r\nstopped him, and asked:\r\n\r\n"Is there any one in the hospital?"\r\n\r\n"No one, Your Excellency."\r\n\r\n"Eh?"\r\n\r\n"No one, Your Excellency."\r\n\r\n"Very well, run along. . . ."\r\n\r\nSwaying majestically, he made for the lemonade stall, where sat a\r\nfull-bosomed old Jewess, who gave herself out to be a Georgian, and\r\nsaid to her as loudly as though he were giving the word of command\r\nto a regiment:\r\n\r\n"Be so good as to give me some soda-water!"\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLaevsky\'s not loving Nadyezhda Fyodorovna showed itself chiefly in\r\nthe fact that everything she said or did seemed to him a lie, or\r\nequivalent to a lie, and everything he read against women and love\r\nseemed to him to apply perfectly to himself, to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna\r\nand her husband. When he returned home, she was sitting at the\r\nwindow, dressed and with her hair done, and with a preoccupied face\r\nwas drinking coffee and turning over the leaves of a fat magazine;\r\nand he thought the drinking of coffee was not such a remarkable\r\nevent that she need put on a preoccupied expression over it, and\r\nthat she had been wasting her time doing her hair in a fashionable\r\nstyle, as there was no one here to attract and no need to be\r\nattractive. And in the magazine he saw nothing but falsity. He\r\nthought she had dressed and done her hair so as to look handsomer,\r\nand was reading in order to seem clever.\r\n\r\n"Will it be all right for me to go to bathe to-day?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Why? There won\'t be an earthquake whether you go or not, I\r\nsuppose . . . ."\r\n\r\n"No, I only ask in case the doctor should be vexed."\r\n\r\n"Well, ask the doctor, then; I\'m not a doctor."\r\n\r\nOn this occasion what displeased Laevsky most in Nadyezhda Fyodorovna\r\nwas her white open neck and the little curls at the back of her\r\nhead. And he remembered that when Anna Karenin got tired of her\r\nhusband, what she disliked most of all was his ears, and thought:\r\n"How true it is, how true!"\r\n\r\nFeeling weak and as though his head were perfectly empty, he went\r\ninto his study, lay down on his sofa, and covered his face with a\r\nhandkerchief that he might not be bothered by the flies. Despondent\r\nand oppressive thoughts always about the same thing trailed slowly\r\nacross his brain like a long string of waggons on a gloomy autumn\r\nevening, and he sank into a state of drowsy oppression. It seemed\r\nto him that he had wronged Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and her husband,\r\nand that it was through his fault that her husband had died. It\r\nseemed to him that he had sinned against his own life, which he had\r\nruined, against the world of lofty ideas, of learning, and of work,\r\nand he conceived that wonderful world as real and possible, not on\r\nthis sea-front with hungry Turks and lazy mountaineers sauntering\r\nupon it, but there in the North, where there were operas, theatres,\r\nnewspapers, and all kinds of intellectual activity. One could only\r\nthere--not here--be honest, intelligent, lofty, and pure. He\r\naccused himself of having no ideal, no guiding principle in life,\r\nthough he had a dim understanding now what it meant. Two years\r\nbefore, when he fell in love with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, it seemed\r\nto him that he had only to go with her as his wife to the Caucasus,\r\nand he would be saved from vulgarity and emptiness; in the same way\r\nnow, he was convinced that he had only to part from Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna and to go to Petersburg, and he would get everything he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n"Run away," he muttered to himself, sitting up and biting his nails.\r\n"Run away!"\r\n\r\nHe pictured in his imagination how he would go aboard the steamer\r\nand then would have some lunch, would drink some cold beer, would\r\ntalk on deck with ladies, then would get into the train at Sevastopol\r\nand set off. Hurrah for freedom! One station after another would\r\nflash by, the air would keep growing colder and keener, then the\r\nbirches and the fir-trees, then Kursk, Moscow. . . . In the restaurants\r\ncabbage soup, mutton with kasha, sturgeon, beer, no more Asiaticism,\r\nbut Russia, real Russia. The passengers in the train would talk\r\nabout trade, new singers, the Franco-Russian _entente_; on all sides\r\nthere would be the feeling of keen, cultured, intellectual, eager\r\nlife. . . . Hasten on, on! At last Nevsky Prospect, and Great\r\nMorskaya Street, and then Kovensky Place, where he used to live at\r\none time when he was a student, the dear grey sky, the drizzling\r\nrain, the drenched cabmen. . . .\r\n\r\n"Ivan Andreitch!" some one called from the next room. "Are you at\r\nhome?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m here," Laevsky responded. "What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"Papers."\r\n\r\nLaevsky got up languidly, feeling giddy, walked into the other room,\r\nyawning and shuffling with his slippers. There, at the open window\r\nthat looked into the street, stood one of his young fellow-clerks,\r\nlaying out some government documents on the window-sill.\r\n\r\n"One minute, my dear fellow," Laevsky said softly, and he went to\r\nlook for the ink; returning to the window, he signed the papers\r\nwithout looking at them, and said: "It\'s hot!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Are you coming to-day?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so. . . . I\'m not quite well. Tell Sheshkovsky that\r\nI will come and see him after dinner."\r\n\r\nThe clerk went away. Laevsky lay down on his sofa again and began\r\nthinking:\r\n\r\n"And so I must weigh all the circumstances and reflect on them.\r\nBefore I go away from here I ought to pay up my debts. I owe about\r\ntwo thousand roubles. I have no money. . . . Of course, that\'s not\r\nimportant; I shall pay part now, somehow, and I shall send the rest,\r\nlater, from Petersburg. The chief point is Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. . . .\r\nFirst of all we must define our relations. . . . Yes."\r\n\r\nA little later he was considering whether it would not be better\r\nto go to Samoylenko for advice.\r\n\r\n"I might go," he thought, "but what use would there be in it? I\r\nshall only say something inappropriate about boudoirs, about women,\r\nabout what is honest or dishonest. What\'s the use of talking about\r\nwhat is honest or dishonest, if I must make haste to save my life,\r\nif I am suffocating in this cursed slavery and am killing myself?\r\n. . . One must realise at last that to go on leading the life I do\r\nis something so base and so cruel that everything else seems petty\r\nand trivial beside it. To run away," he muttered, sitting down, "to\r\nrun away."\r\n\r\nThe deserted seashore, the insatiable heat, and the monotony of the\r\nsmoky lilac mountains, ever the same and silent, everlastingly\r\nsolitary, overwhelmed him with depression, and, as it were, made\r\nhim drowsy and sapped his energy. He was perhaps very clever,\r\ntalented, remarkably honest; perhaps if the sea and the mountains\r\nhad not closed him in on all sides, he might have become an excellent\r\nZemstvo leader, a statesman, an orator, a political writer, a saint.\r\nWho knows? If so, was it not stupid to argue whether it were honest\r\nor dishonest when a gifted and useful man--an artist or musician,\r\nfor instance--to escape from prison, breaks a wall and deceives\r\nhis jailers? Anything is honest when a man is in such a position.\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sat down to dinner.\r\nWhen the cook gave them rice and tomato soup, Laevsky said:\r\n\r\n"The same thing every day. Why not have cabbage soup?"\r\n\r\n"There are no cabbages."\r\n\r\n"It\'s strange. Samoylenko has cabbage soup and Marya Konstantinovna\r\nhas cabbage soup, and only I am obliged to eat this mawkish mess.\r\nWe can\'t go on like this, darling."\r\n\r\nAs is common with the vast majority of husbands and wives, not a\r\nsingle dinner had in earlier days passed without scenes and\r\nfault-finding between Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and Laevsky; but ever\r\nsince Laevsky had made up his mind that he did not love her, he had\r\ntried to give way to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna in everything, spoke to\r\nher gently and politely, smiled, and called her "darling."\r\n\r\n"This soup tastes like liquorice," he said, smiling; he made an\r\neffort to control himself and seem amiable, but could not refrain\r\nfrom saying: "Nobody looks after the housekeeping. . . . If you are\r\ntoo ill or busy with reading, let me look after the cooking."\r\n\r\nIn earlier days she would have said to him, "Do by all means," or,\r\n"I see you want to turn me into a cook"; but now she only looked\r\nat him timidly and flushed crimson.\r\n\r\n"Well, how do you feel to-day?" he asked kindly.\r\n\r\n"I am all right to-day. There is nothing but a little weakness."\r\n\r\n"You must take care of yourself, darling. I am awfully anxious about\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna was ill in some way. Samoylenko said she had\r\nintermittent fever, and gave her quinine; the other doctor,\r\nUstimovitch, a tall, lean, unsociable man, who used to sit at home\r\nin the daytime, and in the evenings walk slowly up and down on the\r\nsea-front coughing, with his hands folded behind him and a cane\r\nstretched along his back, was of opinion that she had a female\r\ncomplaint, and prescribed warm compresses. In old days, when Laevsky\r\nloved her, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna\'s illness had excited his pity and\r\nterror; now he saw falsity even in her illness. Her yellow, sleepy\r\nface, her lustreless eyes, her apathetic expression, and the yawning\r\nthat always followed her attacks of fever, and the fact that during\r\nthem she lay under a shawl and looked more like a boy than a woman,\r\nand that it was close and stuffy in her room--all this, in his\r\nopinion, destroyed the illusion and was an argument against love\r\nand marriage.\r\n\r\nThe next dish given him was spinach with hard-boiled eggs, while\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna, as an invalid, had jelly and milk. When with\r\na preoccupied face she touched the jelly with a spoon and then began\r\nlanguidly eating it, sipping milk, and he heard her swallowing, he\r\nwas possessed by such an overwhelming aversion that it made his\r\nhead tingle. He recognised that such a feeling would be an insult\r\neven to a dog, but he was angry, not with himself but with Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna, for arousing such a feeling, and he understood why\r\nlovers sometimes murder their mistresses. He would not murder her,\r\nof course, but if he had been on a jury now, he would have acquitted\r\nthe murderer.\r\n\r\n"Merci, darling," he said after dinner, and kissed Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna on the forehead.\r\n\r\nGoing back into his study, he spent five minutes in walking to and\r\nfro, looking at his boots; then he sat down on his sofa and muttered:\r\n\r\n"Run away, run away! We must define the position and run away!"\r\n\r\nHe lay down on the sofa and recalled again that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna\'s\r\nhusband had died, perhaps, by his fault.\r\n\r\n"To blame a man for loving a woman, or ceasing to love a woman, is\r\nstupid," he persuaded himself, lying down and raising his legs in\r\norder to put on his high boots. "Love and hatred are not under our\r\ncontrol. As for her husband, maybe I was in an indirect way one of\r\nthe causes of his death; but again, is it my fault that I fell in\r\nlove with his wife and she with me?"\r\n\r\nThen he got up, and finding his cap, set off to the lodgings of his\r\ncolleague, Sheshkovsky, where the Government clerks met every day\r\nto play _vint_ and drink beer.\r\n\r\n"My indecision reminds me of Hamlet," thought Laevsky on the way.\r\n"How truly Shakespeare describes it! Ah, how truly!"\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFor the sake of sociability and from sympathy for the hard plight\r\nof newcomers without families, who, as there was not an hotel in\r\nthe town, had nowhere to dine, Dr. Samoylenko kept a sort of table\r\nd\'hote. At this time there were only two men who habitually dined\r\nwith him: a young zoologist called Von Koren, who had come for the\r\nsummer to the Black Sea to study the embryology of the medusa, and\r\na deacon called Pobyedov, who had only just left the seminary and\r\nbeen sent to the town to take the duty of the old deacon who had\r\ngone away for a cure. Each of them paid twelve roubles a month for\r\ntheir dinner and supper, and Samoylenko made them promise to turn\r\nup at two o\'clock punctually.\r\n\r\nVon Koren was usually the first to appear. He sat down in the\r\ndrawing-room in silence, and taking an album from the table, began\r\nattentively scrutinising the faded photographs of unknown men in\r\nfull trousers and top-hats, and ladies in crinolines and caps.\r\nSamoylenko only remembered a few of them by name, and of those whom\r\nhe had forgotten he said with a sigh: "A very fine fellow, remarkably\r\nintelligent!" When he had finished with the album, Von Koren took\r\na pistol from the whatnot, and screwing up his left eye, took\r\ndeliberate aim at the portrait of Prince Vorontsov, or stood still\r\nat the looking-glass and gazed a long time at his swarthy face, his\r\nbig forehead, and his black hair, which curled like a negro\'s, and\r\nhis shirt of dull-coloured cotton with big flowers on it like a\r\nPersian rug, and the broad leather belt he wore instead of a\r\nwaistcoat. The contemplation of his own image seemed to afford him\r\nalmost more satisfaction than looking at photographs or playing\r\nwith the pistols. He was very well satisfied with his face, and his\r\nbecomingly clipped beard, and the broad shoulders, which were\r\nunmistakable evidence of his excellent health and physical strength.\r\nHe was satisfied, too, with his stylish get-up, from the cravat,\r\nwhich matched the colour of his shirt, down to his brown boots.\r\n\r\nWhile he was looking at the album and standing before the glass,\r\nat that moment, in the kitchen and in the passage near, Samoylenko,\r\nwithout his coat and waistcoat, with his neck bare, excited and\r\nbathed in perspiration, was bustling about the tables, mixing the\r\nsalad, or making some sauce, or preparing meat, cucumbers, and onion\r\nfor the cold soup, while he glared fiercely at the orderly who was\r\nhelping him, and brandished first a knife and then a spoon at him.\r\n\r\n"Give me the vinegar!" he said. "That\'s not the vinegar--it\'s the\r\nsalad oil!" he shouted, stamping. "Where are you off to, you brute?"\r\n\r\n"To get the butter, Your Excellency," answered the flustered orderly\r\nin a cracked voice.\r\n\r\n"Make haste; it\'s in the cupboard! And tell Daria to put some fennel\r\nin the jar with the cucumbers! Fennel! Cover the cream up, gaping\r\nlaggard, or the flies will get into it!"\r\n\r\nAnd the whole house seemed resounding with his shouts. When it was\r\nten or fifteen minutes to two the deacon would come in; he was a\r\nlanky young man of twenty-two, with long hair, with no beard and a\r\nhardly perceptible moustache. Going into the drawing-room, he crossed\r\nhimself before the ikon, smiled, and held out his hand to Von Koren.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning," the zoologist said coldly. "Where have you been?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been catching sea-gudgeon in the harbour."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course. . . . Evidently, deacon, you will never be busy\r\nwith work."\r\n\r\n"Why not? Work is not like a bear; it doesn\'t run off into the\r\nwoods," said the deacon, smiling and thrusting his hands into the\r\nvery deep pockets of his white cassock.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no one to whip you!" sighed the zoologist.\r\n\r\nAnother fifteen or twenty minutes passed and they were not called\r\nto dinner, and they could still hear the orderly running into the\r\nkitchen and back again, noisily treading with his boots, and\r\nSamoylenko shouting:\r\n\r\n"Put it on the table! Where are your wits? Wash it first."\r\n\r\nThe famished deacon and Von Koren began tapping on the floor with\r\ntheir heels, expressing in this way their impatience like the\r\naudience at a theatre. At last the door opened and the harassed\r\norderly announced that dinner was ready! In the dining-room they\r\nwere met by Samoylenko, crimson in the face, wrathful, perspiring\r\nfrom the heat of the kitchen; he looked at them furiously, and with\r\nan expression of horror, took the lid off the soup tureen and helped\r\neach of them to a plateful; and only when he was convinced that\r\nthey were eating it with relish and liked it, he gave a sigh of\r\nrelief and settled himself in his deep arm-chair. His face looked\r\nblissful and his eyes grew moist. . . . He deliberately poured\r\nhimself out a glass of vodka and said:\r\n\r\n"To the health of the younger generation."\r\n\r\nAfter his conversation with Laevsky, from early morning till dinner\r\nSamoylenko had been conscious of a load at his heart, although he\r\nwas in the best of humours; he felt sorry for Laevsky and wanted\r\nto help him. After drinking a glass of vodka before the soup, he\r\nheaved a sigh and said:\r\n\r\n"I saw Vanya Laevsky to-day. He is having a hard time of it, poor\r\nfellow! The material side of life is not encouraging for him, and\r\nthe worst of it is all this psychology is too much for him. I\'m\r\nsorry for the lad."\r\n\r\n"Well, that is a person I am not sorry for," said Von Koren. "If\r\nthat charming individual were drowning, I would push him under with\r\na stick and say, \'Drown, brother, drown away.\' . . ."\r\n\r\n"That\'s untrue. You wouldn\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"Why do you think that?" The zoologist shrugged his shoulders. "I\'m\r\njust as capable of a good action as you are."\r\n\r\n"Is drowning a man a good action?" asked the deacon, and he laughed.\r\n\r\n"Laevsky? Yes."\r\n\r\n"I think there is something amiss with the soup . . ." said Samoylenko,\r\nanxious to change the conversation.\r\n\r\n"Laevsky is absolutely pernicious and is as dangerous to society\r\nas the cholera microbe," Von Koren went on. "To drown him would be\r\na service."\r\n\r\n"It does not do you credit to talk like that about your neighbour.\r\nTell us: what do you hate him for?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk nonsense, doctor. To hate and despise a microbe is\r\nstupid, but to look upon everybody one meets without distinction\r\nas one\'s neighbour, whatever happens--thanks very much, that is\r\nequivalent to giving up criticism, renouncing a straightforward\r\nattitude to people, washing one\'s hands of responsibility, in fact!\r\nI consider your Laevsky a blackguard; I do not conceal it, and I\r\nam perfectly conscientious in treating him as such. Well, you look\r\nupon him as your neighbour--and you may kiss him if you like: you\r\nlook upon him as your neighbour, and that means that your attitude\r\nto him is the same as to me and to the deacon; that is no attitude\r\nat all. You are equally indifferent to all."\r\n\r\n"To call a man a blackguard!" muttered Samoylenko, frowning with\r\ndistaste--"that is so wrong that I can\'t find words for it!"\r\n\r\n"People are judged by their actions," Von Koren continued. "Now you\r\ndecide, deacon. . . . I am going to talk to you, deacon. Mr. Laevsky\'s\r\ncareer lies open before you, like a long Chinese puzzle, and you\r\ncan read it from beginning to end. What has he been doing these two\r\nyears that he has been living here? We will reckon his doings on\r\nour fingers. First, he has taught the inhabitants of the town to\r\nplay _vint_: two years ago that game was unknown here; now they all\r\nplay it from morning till late at night, even the women and the\r\nboys. Secondly, he has taught the residents to drink beer, which\r\nwas not known here either; the inhabitants are indebted to him for\r\nthe knowledge of various sorts of spirits, so that now they can\r\ndistinguish Kospelov\'s vodka from Smirnov\'s No. 21, blindfold.\r\nThirdly, in former days, people here made love to other men\'s wives\r\nin secret, from the same motives as thieves steal in secret and not\r\nopenly; adultery was considered something they were ashamed to make\r\na public display of. Laevsky has come as a pioneer in that line;\r\nhe lives with another man\'s wife openly. . . . Fourthly . . ."\r\n\r\nVon Koren hurriedly ate up his soup and gave his plate to the\r\norderly.\r\n\r\n"I understood Laevsky from the first month of our acquaintance,"\r\nhe went on, addressing the deacon. "We arrived here at the same\r\ntime. Men like him are very fond of friendship, intimacy, solidarity,\r\nand all the rest of it, because they always want company for _vint_,\r\ndrinking, and eating; besides, they are talkative and must have\r\nlisteners. We made friends--that is, he turned up every day,\r\nhindered me working, and indulged in confidences in regard to his\r\nmistress. From the first he struck me by his exceptional falsity,\r\nwhich simply made me sick. As a friend I pitched into him, asking\r\nhim why he drank too much, why he lived beyond his means and got\r\ninto debt, why he did nothing and read nothing, why he had so little\r\nculture and so little knowledge; and in answer to all my questions\r\nhe used to smile bitterly, sigh, and say: \'I am a failure, a\r\nsuperfluous man\'; or: \'What do you expect, my dear fellow, from us,\r\nthe debris of the serf-owning class?\' or: \'We are degenerate. . . .\'\r\nOr he would begin a long rigmarole about Onyegin, Petchorin,\r\nByron\'s Cain, and Bazarov, of whom he would say: \'They are our\r\nfathers in flesh and in spirit.\' So we are to understand that it\r\nwas not his fault that Government envelopes lay unopened in his\r\noffice for weeks together, and that he drank and taught others to\r\ndrink, but Onyegin, Petchorin, and Turgenev, who had invented the\r\nfailure and the superfluous man, were responsible for it. The cause\r\nof his extreme dissoluteness and unseemliness lies, do you see, not\r\nin himself, but somewhere outside in space. And so--an ingenious\r\nidea!--it is not only he who is dissolute, false, and disgusting,\r\nbut we . . . \'we men of the eighties,\' \'we the spiritless, nervous\r\noffspring of the serf-owning class\'; \'civilisation has crippled us\'\r\n. . . in fact, we are to understand that such a great man as Laevsky\r\nis great even in his fall: that his dissoluteness, his lack of\r\nculture and of moral purity, is a phenomenon of natural history,\r\nsanctified by inevitability; that the causes of it are world-wide,\r\nelemental; and that we ought to hang up a lamp before Laevsky, since\r\nhe is the fated victim of the age, of influences, of heredity, and\r\nso on. All the officials and their ladies were in ecstasies when\r\nthey listened to him, and I could not make out for a long time what\r\nsort of man I had to deal with, a cynic or a clever rogue. Such\r\ntypes as he, on the surface intellectual with a smattering of\r\neducation and a great deal of talk about their own nobility, are\r\nvery clever in posing as exceptionally complex natures."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue!" Samoylenko flared up. "I will not allow a\r\nsplendid fellow to be spoken ill of in my presence!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t interrupt, Alexandr Daviditch," said Von Koren coldly; "I\r\nam just finishing. Laevsky is by no means a complex organism. Here\r\nis his moral skeleton: in the morning, slippers, a bathe, and coffee;\r\nthen till dinner-time, slippers, a constitutional, and conversation;\r\nat two o\'clock slippers, dinner, and wine; at five o\'clock a bathe,\r\ntea and wine, then _vint_ and lying; at ten o\'clock supper and wine;\r\nand after midnight sleep and _la femme_. His existence is confined\r\nwithin this narrow programme like an egg within its shell. Whether\r\nhe walks or sits, is angry, writes, rejoices, it may all be reduced\r\nto wine, cards, slippers, and women. Woman plays a fatal, overwhelming\r\npart in his life. He tells us himself that at thirteen he was in\r\nlove; that when he was a student in his first year he was living\r\nwith a lady who had a good influence over him, and to whom he was\r\nindebted for his musical education. In his second year he bought a\r\nprostitute from a brothel and raised her to his level--that is,\r\ntook her as his kept mistress, and she lived with him for six months\r\nand then ran away back to the brothel-keeper, and her flight caused\r\nhim much spiritual suffering. Alas! his sufferings were so great\r\nthat he had to leave the university and spend two years at home\r\ndoing nothing. But this was all for the best. At home he made friends\r\nwith a widow who advised him to leave the Faculty of Jurisprudence\r\nand go into the Faculty of Arts. And so he did. When he had taken\r\nhis degree, he fell passionately in love with his present . . .\r\nwhat\'s her name? . . . married lady, and was obliged to flee with\r\nher here to the Caucasus for the sake of his ideals, he would have\r\nus believe, seeing that . . . to-morrow, if not to-day, he will be\r\ntired of her and flee back again to Petersburg, and that, too, will\r\nbe for the sake of his ideals."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?" growled Samoylenko, looking angrily at the\r\nzoologist. "You had better eat your dinner."\r\n\r\nThe next course consisted of boiled mullet with Polish sauce.\r\nSamoylenko helped each of his companions to a whole mullet and\r\npoured out the sauce with his own hand. Two minutes passed in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"Woman plays an essential part in the life of every man," said the\r\ndeacon. "You can\'t help that."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but to what degree? For each of us woman means mother, sister,\r\nwife, friend. To Laevsky she is everything, and at the same time\r\nnothing but a mistress. She--that is, cohabitation with her--\r\nis the happiness and object of his life; he is gay, sad, bored,\r\ndisenchanted--on account of woman; his life grows disagreeable\r\n--woman is to blame; the dawn of a new life begins to glow, ideals\r\nturn up--and again look for the woman. . . . He only derives\r\nenjoyment from books and pictures in which there is woman. Our age\r\nis, to his thinking, poor and inferior to the forties and the sixties\r\nonly because we do not know how to abandon ourselves obviously to\r\nthe passion and ecstasy of love. These voluptuaries must have in\r\ntheir brains a special growth of the nature of sarcoma, which stifles\r\nthe brain and directs their whole psychology. Watch Laevsky when\r\nhe is sitting anywhere in company. You notice: when one raises any\r\ngeneral question in his presence, for instance, about the cell or\r\ninstinct, he sits apart, and neither speaks nor listens; he looks\r\nlanguid and disillusioned; nothing has any interest for him,\r\neverything is vulgar and trivial. But as soon as you speak of male\r\nand female--for instance, of the fact that the female spider,\r\nafter fertilisation, devours the male--his eyes glow with curiosity,\r\nhis face brightens, and the man revives, in fact. All his thoughts,\r\nhowever noble, lofty, or neutral they may be, they all have one\r\npoint of resemblance. You walk along the street with him and meet\r\na donkey, for instance. . . . \'Tell me, please,\' he asks, \'what\r\nwould happen if you mated a donkey with a camel?\' And his dreams!\r\nHas he told you of his dreams? It is magnificent! First, he dreams\r\nthat he is married to the moon, then that he is summoned before the\r\npolice and ordered to live with a guitar . . ."\r\n\r\nThe deacon burst into resounding laughter; Samoylenko frowned and\r\nwrinkled up his face angrily so as not to laugh, but could not\r\nrestrain himself, and laughed.\r\n\r\n"And it\'s all nonsense!" he said, wiping his tears. "Yes, by Jove,\r\nit\'s nonsense!"\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe deacon was very easily amused, and laughed at every trifle till\r\nhe got a stitch in his side, till he was helpless. It seemed as\r\nthough he only liked to be in people\'s company because there was a\r\nridiculous side to them, and because they might be given ridiculous\r\nnicknames. He had nicknamed Samoylenko "the tarantula," his orderly\r\n"the drake," and was in ecstasies when on one occasion Von Koren\r\nspoke of Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna as "Japanese monkeys."\r\nHe watched people\'s faces greedily, listened without blinking, and\r\nit could be seen that his eyes filled with laughter and his face\r\nwas tense with expectation of the moment when he could let himself\r\ngo and burst into laughter.\r\n\r\n"He is a corrupt and depraved type," the zoologist continued, while\r\nthe deacon kept his eyes riveted on his face, expecting he would\r\nsay something funny. "It is not often one can meet with such a\r\nnonentity. In body he is inert, feeble, prematurely old, while in\r\nintellect he differs in no respect from a fat shopkeeper\'s wife who\r\ndoes nothing but eat, drink, and sleep on a feather-bed, and who\r\nkeeps her coachman as a lover."\r\n\r\nThe deacon began guffawing again.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t laugh, deacon," said Von Koren. "It grows stupid, at last.\r\nI should not have paid attention to his insignificance," he went\r\non, after waiting till the deacon had left off laughing; "I should\r\nhave passed him by if he were not so noxious and dangerous. His\r\nnoxiousness lies first of all in the fact that he has great success\r\nwith women, and so threatens to leave descendants--that is, to\r\npresent the world with a dozen Laevskys as feeble and as depraved\r\nas himself. Secondly, he is in the highest degree contaminating. I\r\nhave spoken to you already of _vint_ and beer. In another year or\r\ntwo he will dominate the whole Caucasian coast. You know how the\r\nmass, especially its middle stratum, believe in intellectuality,\r\nin a university education, in gentlemanly manners, and in literary\r\nlanguage. Whatever filthy thing he did, they would all believe that\r\nit was as it should be, since he is an intellectual man, of liberal\r\nideas and university education. What is more, he is a failure, a\r\nsuperfluous man, a neurasthenic, a victim of the age, and that means\r\nhe can do anything. He is a charming fellow, a regular good sort,\r\nhe is so genuinely indulgent to human weaknesses; he is compliant,\r\naccommodating, easy and not proud; one can drink with him and gossip\r\nand talk evil of people. . . . The masses, always inclined to\r\nanthropomorphism in religion and morals, like best of all the little\r\ngods who have the same weaknesses as themselves. Only think what a\r\nwide field he has for contamination! Besides, he is not a bad actor\r\nand is a clever hypocrite, and knows very well how to twist things\r\nround. Only take his little shifts and dodges, his attitude to\r\ncivilisation, for instance. He has scarcely sniffed at civilisation,\r\nyet: \'Ah, how we have been crippled by civilisation! Ah, how I envy\r\nthose savages, those children of nature, who know nothing of\r\ncivilisation!\' We are to understand, you see, that at one time, in\r\nancient days, he has been devoted to civilisation with his whole\r\nsoul, has served it, has sounded it to its depths, but it has\r\nexhausted him, disillusioned him, deceived him; he is a Faust, do\r\nyou see?--a second Tolstoy. . . . As for Schopenhauer and Spencer,\r\nhe treats them like small boys and slaps them on the shoulder in a\r\nfatherly way: \'Well, what do you say, old Spencer?\' He has not read\r\nSpencer, of course, but how charming he is when with light, careless\r\nirony he says of his lady friend: \'She has read Spencer!\' And they\r\nall listen to him, and no one cares to understand that this charlatan\r\nhas not the right to kiss the sole of Spencer\'s foot, let alone\r\nspeaking about him in that tone! Sapping the foundations of\r\ncivilisation, of authority, of other people\'s altars, spattering\r\nthem with filth, winking jocosely at them only to justify and conceal\r\none\'s own rottenness and moral poverty is only possible for a very\r\nvain, base, and nasty creature."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what it is you expect of him, Kolya," said Samoylenko,\r\nlooking at the zoologist, not with anger now, but with a guilty\r\nair. "He is a man the same as every one else. Of course, he has his\r\nweaknesses, but he is abreast of modern ideas, is in the service,\r\nis of use to his country. Ten years ago there was an old fellow\r\nserving as agent here, a man of the greatest intelligence . . . and\r\nhe used to say . . ."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, nonsense!" the zoologist interrupted. "You say he is in\r\nthe service; but how does he serve? Do you mean to tell me that\r\nthings have been done better because he is here, and the officials\r\nare more punctual, honest, and civil? On the contrary, he has only\r\nsanctioned their slackness by his prestige as an intellectual\r\nuniversity man. He is only punctual on the 20th of the month, when\r\nhe gets his salary; on the other days he lounges about at home in\r\nslippers and tries to look as if he were doing the Government a\r\ngreat service by living in the Caucasus. No, Alexandr Daviditch,\r\ndon\'t stick up for him. You are insincere from beginning to end.\r\nIf you really loved him and considered him your neighbour, you would\r\nabove all not be indifferent to his weaknesses, you would not be\r\nindulgent to them, but for his own sake would try to make him\r\ninnocuous."\r\n\r\n"That is?"\r\n\r\n"Innocuous. Since he is incorrigible, he can only be made innocuous\r\nin one way. . . ." Von Koren passed his finger round his throat.\r\n"Or he might be drowned . . .", he added. "In the interests of\r\nhumanity and in their own interests, such people ought to be\r\ndestroyed. They certainly ought."\r\n\r\n"What are you saying?" muttered Samoylenko, getting up and looking\r\nwith amazement at the zoologist\'s calm, cold face. "Deacon, what\r\nis he saying? Why--are you in your senses?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t insist on the death penalty," said Von Koren. "If it is\r\nproved that it is pernicious, devise something else. If we can\'t\r\ndestroy Laevsky, why then, isolate him, make him harmless, send him\r\nto hard labour."\r\n\r\n"What are you saying!" said Samoylenko in horror. "With pepper,\r\nwith pepper," he cried in a voice of despair, seeing that the deacon\r\nwas eating stuffed aubergines without pepper. "You with your great\r\nintellect, what are you saying! Send our friend, a proud intellectual\r\nman, to penal servitude!"\r\n\r\n"Well, if he is proud and tries to resist, put him in fetters!"\r\n\r\nSamoylenko could not utter a word, and only twiddled his fingers;\r\nthe deacon looked at his flabbergasted and really absurd face, and\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n"Let us leave off talking of that," said the zoologist. "Only\r\nremember one thing, Alexandr Daviditch: primitive man was preserved\r\nfrom such as Laevsky by the struggle for existence and by natural\r\nselection; now our civilisation has considerably weakened the\r\nstruggle and the selection, and we ought to look after the destruction\r\nof the rotten and worthless for ourselves; otherwise, when the\r\nLaevskys multiply, civilisation will perish and mankind will\r\ndegenerate utterly. It will be our fault."\r\n\r\n"If it depends on drowning and hanging," said Samoylenko, "damnation\r\ntake your civilisation, damnation take your humanity! Damnation\r\ntake it! I tell you what: you are a very learned and intelligent\r\nman and the pride of your country, but the Germans have ruined you.\r\nYes, the Germans! The Germans!"\r\n\r\nSince Samoylenko had left Dorpat, where he had studied medicine,\r\nhe had rarely seen a German and had not read a single German book,\r\nbut, in his opinion, every harmful idea in politics or science was\r\ndue to the Germans. Where he had got this notion he could not have\r\nsaid himself, but he held it firmly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the Germans!" he repeated once more. "Come and have some tea."\r\n\r\nAll three stood up, and putting on their hats, went out into the\r\nlittle garden, and sat there under the shade of the light green\r\nmaples, the pear-trees, and a chestnut-tree. The zoologist and the\r\ndeacon sat on a bench by the table, while Samoylenko sank into a\r\ndeep wicker chair with a sloping back. The orderly handed them tea,\r\njam, and a bottle of syrup.\r\n\r\nIt was very hot, thirty degrees Reaumur in the shade. The sultry\r\nair was stagnant and motionless, and a long spider-web, stretching\r\nfrom the chestnut-tree to the ground, hung limply and did not stir.\r\n\r\nThe deacon took up the guitar, which was constantly lying on the\r\nground near the table, tuned it, and began singing softly in a thin\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n"\'Gathered round the tavern were the seminary lads,\'"\r\n\r\nbut instantly subsided, overcome by the heat, mopped his brow and\r\nglanced upwards at the blazing blue sky. Samoylenko grew drowsy;\r\nthe sultry heat, the stillness and the delicious after-dinner\r\nlanguor, which quickly pervaded all his limbs, made him feel heavy\r\nand sleepy; his arms dropped at his sides, his eyes grew small, his\r\nhead sank on his breast. He looked with almost tearful tenderness\r\nat Von Koren and the deacon, and muttered:\r\n\r\n"The younger generation. . . A scientific star and a luminary of\r\nthe Church. . . . I shouldn\'t wonder if the long-skirted alleluia\r\nwill be shooting up into a bishop; I dare say I may come to kissing\r\nhis hand. . . . Well . . . please God. . . ."\r\n\r\nSoon a snore was heard. Von Koren and the deacon finished their tea\r\nand went out into the street.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to the harbour again to catch sea-gudgeon?" asked\r\nthe zoologist.\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s too hot."\r\n\r\n"Come and see me. You can pack up a parcel and copy something for\r\nme. By the way, we must have a talk about what you are to do. You\r\nmust work, deacon. You can\'t go on like this."\r\n\r\n"Your words are just and logical," said the deacon. "But my laziness\r\nfinds an excuse in the circumstances of my present life. You know\r\nyourself that an uncertain position has a great tendency to make\r\npeople apathetic. God only knows whether I have been sent here for\r\na time or permanently. I am living here in uncertainty, while my\r\nwife is vegetating at her father\'s and is missing me. And I must\r\nconfess my brain is melting with the heat."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all nonsense," said the zoologist. "You can get used to the\r\nheat, and you can get used to being without the deaconess. You\r\nmustn\'t be slack; you must pull yourself together."\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna went to bathe in the morning, and her cook,\r\nOlga, followed her with a jug, a copper basin, towels, and a sponge.\r\nIn the bay stood two unknown steamers with dirty white funnels,\r\nobviously foreign cargo vessels. Some men dressed in white and\r\nwearing white shoes were walking along the harbour, shouting loudly\r\nin French, and were answered from the steamers. The bells were\r\nringing briskly in the little church of the town.\r\n\r\n"To-day is Sunday!" Nadyezhda Fyodorovna remembered with pleasure.\r\n\r\nShe felt perfectly well, and was in a gay holiday humour. In a new\r\nloose-fitting dress of coarse thick tussore silk, and a big\r\nwide-brimmed straw hat which was bent down over her ears, so that\r\nher face looked out as though from a basket, she fancied she looked\r\nvery charming. She thought that in the whole town there was only\r\none young, pretty, intellectual woman, and that was herself, and\r\nthat she was the only one who knew how to dress herself cheaply,\r\nelegantly, and with taste. That dress, for example, cost only\r\ntwenty-two roubles, and yet how charming it was! In the whole town\r\nshe was the only one who could be attractive, while there were\r\nnumbers of men, so they must all, whether they would or not, be\r\nenvious of Laevsky.\r\n\r\nShe was glad that of late Laevsky had been cold to her, reserved\r\nand polite, and at times even harsh and rude; in the past she had\r\nmet all his outbursts, all his contemptuous, cold or strange\r\nincomprehensible glances, with tears, reproaches, and threats to\r\nleave him or to starve herself to death; now she only blushed,\r\nlooked guiltily at him, and was glad he was not affectionate to\r\nher. If he had abused her, threatened her, it would have been better\r\nand pleasanter, since she felt hopelessly guilty towards him. She\r\nfelt she was to blame, in the first place, for not sympathising\r\nwith the dreams of a life of hard work, for the sake of which he\r\nhad given up Petersburg and had come here to the Caucasus, and she\r\nwas convinced that he had been angry with her of late for precisely\r\nthat. When she was travelling to the Caucasus, it seemed that she\r\nwould find here on the first day a cosy nook by the sea, a snug\r\nlittle garden with shade, with birds, with little brooks, where she\r\ncould grow flowers and vegetables, rear ducks and hens, entertain\r\nher neighbours, doctor poor peasants and distribute little books\r\namongst them. It had turned out that the Caucasus was nothing but\r\nbare mountains, forests, and huge valleys, where it took a long\r\ntime and a great deal of effort to find anything and settle down;\r\nthat there were no neighbours of any sort; that it was very hot and\r\none might be robbed. Laevsky had been in no hurry to obtain a piece\r\nof land; she was glad of it, and they seemed to be in a tacit compact\r\nnever to allude to a life of hard work. He was silent about it, she\r\nthought, because he was angry with her for being silent about it.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, she had without his knowledge during those two\r\nyears bought various trifles to the value of three hundred roubles\r\nat Atchmianov\'s shop. She had bought the things by degrees, at one\r\ntime materials, at another time silk or a parasol, and the debt had\r\ngrown imperceptibly.\r\n\r\n"I will tell him about it to-day . . .", she used to decide, but\r\nat once reflected that in Laevsky\'s present mood it would hardly\r\nbe convenient to talk to him of debts.\r\n\r\nThirdly, she had on two occasions in Laevsky\'s absence received a\r\nvisit from Kirilin, the police captain: once in the morning when\r\nLaevsky had gone to bathe, and another time at midnight when he was\r\nplaying cards. Remembering this, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna flushed\r\ncrimson, and looked round at the cook as though she might overhear\r\nher thoughts. The long, insufferably hot, wearisome days, beautiful\r\nlanguorous evenings and stifling nights, and the whole manner of\r\nliving, when from morning to night one is at a loss to fill up the\r\nuseless hours, and the persistent thought that she was the prettiest\r\nyoung woman in the town, and that her youth was passing and being\r\nwasted, and Laevsky himself, though honest and idealistic, always\r\nthe same, always lounging about in his slippers, biting his nails,\r\nand wearying her with his caprices, led by degrees to her becoming\r\npossessed by desire, and as though she were mad, she thought of\r\nnothing else day and night. Breathing, looking, walking, she felt\r\nnothing but desire. The sound of the sea told her she must love;\r\nthe darkness of evening--the same; the mountains--the same. . . .\r\nAnd when Kirilin began paying her attentions, she had neither\r\nthe power nor the wish to resist, and surrendered to him. . . .\r\n\r\nNow the foreign steamers and the men in white reminded her for some\r\nreason of a huge hall; together with the shouts of French she heard\r\nthe strains of a waltz, and her bosom heaved with unaccountable\r\ndelight. She longed to dance and talk French.\r\n\r\nShe reflected joyfully that there was nothing terrible about her\r\ninfidelity. Her soul had no part in her infidelity; she still loved\r\nLaevsky, and that was proved by the fact that she was jealous of\r\nhim, was sorry for him, and missed him when he was away. Kirilin\r\nhad turned out to be very mediocre, rather coarse though handsome;\r\neverything was broken off with him already and there would never\r\nbe anything more. What had happened was over; it had nothing to do\r\nwith any one, and if Laevsky found it out he would not believe in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere was only one bathing-house for ladies on the sea-front; men\r\nbathed under the open sky. Going into the bathing-house, Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna found there an elderly lady, Marya Konstantinovna Bityugov,\r\nand her daughter Katya, a schoolgirl of fifteen; both of them were\r\nsitting on a bench undressing. Marya Konstantinovna was a good-natured,\r\nenthusiastic, and genteel person, who talked in a drawling and\r\npathetic voice. She had been a governess until she was thirty-two,\r\nand then had married Bityugov, a Government official--a bald\r\nlittle man with his hair combed on to his temples and with a very\r\nmeek disposition. She was still in love with him, was jealous,\r\nblushed at the word "love," and told every one she was very happy.\r\n\r\n"My dear," she cried enthusiastically, on seeing Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,\r\nassuming an expression which all her acquaintances called "almond-oily."\r\n"My dear, how delightful that you have come! We\'ll bathe together\r\n--that\'s enchanting!"\r\n\r\nOlga quickly flung off her dress and chemise, and began undressing\r\nher mistress.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not quite so hot to-day as yesterday?" said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,\r\nshrinking at the coarse touch of the naked cook. "Yesterday I almost\r\ndied of the heat."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, my dear; I could hardly breathe myself. Would you believe\r\nit? I bathed yesterday three times! Just imagine, my dear, three\r\ntimes! Nikodim Alexandritch was quite uneasy."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible to be so ugly?" thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, looking\r\nat Olga and the official\'s wife; she glanced at Katya and thought:\r\n"The little girl\'s not badly made."\r\n\r\n"Your Nikodim Alexandritch is very charming!" she said. "I\'m simply\r\nin love with him."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha!" cried Marya Konstantinovna, with a forced laugh;\r\n"that\'s quite enchanting."\r\n\r\nFree from her clothes, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna felt a desire to fly.\r\nAnd it seemed to her that if she were to wave her hands she would\r\nfly upwards. When she was undressed, she noticed that Olga looked\r\nscornfully at her white body. Olga, a young soldier\'s wife, was\r\nliving with her lawful husband, and so considered herself superior\r\nto her mistress. Marya Konstantinovna and Katya were afraid of her,\r\nand did not respect her. This was disagreeable, and to raise herself\r\nin their opinion, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said:\r\n\r\n"At home, in Petersburg, summer villa life is at its height now.\r\nMy husband and I have so many friends! We ought to go and see them."\r\n\r\n"I believe your husband is an engineer?" said Marya Konstantinovna\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n"I am speaking of Laevsky. He has a great many acquaintances. But\r\nunfortunately his mother is a proud aristocrat, not very\r\nintelligent. . . ."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna threw herself into the water without finishing;\r\nMarya Konstantinovna and Katya made their way in after her.\r\n\r\n"There are so many conventional ideas in the world," Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna went on, "and life is not so easy as it seems."\r\n\r\nMarya Konstantinovna, who had been a governess in aristocratic\r\nfamilies and who was an authority on social matters, said:\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! Would you believe me, my dear, at the Garatynskys\' I was\r\nexpected to dress for lunch as well as for dinner, so that, like\r\nan actress, I received a special allowance for my wardrobe in\r\naddition to my salary."\r\n\r\nShe stood between Nadyezhda Fyodorovna and Katya as though to screen\r\nher daughter from the water that washed the former.\r\n\r\nThrough the open doors looking out to the sea they could see some\r\none swimming a hundred paces from their bathing-place.\r\n\r\n"Mother, it\'s our Kostya," said Katya.\r\n\r\n"Ach, ach!" Marya Konstantinovna cackled in her dismay. "Ach,\r\nKostya!" she shouted, "Come back! Kostya, come back!"\r\n\r\nKostya, a boy of fourteen, to show off his prowess before his mother\r\nand sister, dived and swam farther, but began to be exhausted and\r\nhurried back, and from his strained and serious face it could be\r\nseen that he could not trust his own strength.\r\n\r\n"The trouble one has with these boys, my dear!" said Marya\r\nKonstantinovna, growing calmer. "Before you can turn round, he will\r\nbreak his neck. Ah, my dear, how sweet it is, and yet at the same\r\ntime how difficult, to be a mother! One\'s afraid of everything."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna put on her straw hat and dashed out into the\r\nopen sea. She swam some thirty feet and then turned on her back.\r\nShe could see the sea to the horizon, the steamers, the people on\r\nthe sea-front, the town; and all this, together with the sultry\r\nheat and the soft, transparent waves, excited her and whispered\r\nthat she must live, live. . . . A sailing-boat darted by her rapidly\r\nand vigorously, cleaving the waves and the air; the man sitting at\r\nthe helm looked at her, and she liked being looked at. . . .\r\n\r\nAfter bathing, the ladies dressed and went away together.\r\n\r\n"I have fever every alternate day, and yet I don\'t get thin," said\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna, licking her lips, which were salt from the\r\nbathe, and responding with a smile to the bows of her acquaintances.\r\n"I\'ve always been plump, and now I believe I\'m plumper than ever."\r\n\r\n"That, my dear, is constitutional. If, like me, one has no\r\nconstitutional tendency to stoutness, no diet is of any use. . . .\r\nBut you\'ve wetted your hat, my dear."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter; it will dry."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna saw again the men in white who were walking\r\non the sea-front and talking French; and again she felt a sudden\r\nthrill of joy, and had a vague memory of some big hall in which she\r\nhad once danced, or of which, perhaps, she had once dreamed. And\r\nsomething at the bottom of her soul dimly and obscurely whispered\r\nto her that she was a pretty, common, miserable, worthless\r\nwoman. . . .\r\n\r\nMarya Konstantinovna stopped at her gate and asked her to come in\r\nand sit down for a little while.\r\n\r\n"Come in, my dear," she said in an imploring voice, and at the same\r\ntime she looked at Nadyezhda Fyodorovna with anxiety and hope;\r\nperhaps she would refuse and not come in!\r\n\r\n"With pleasure," said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, accepting. "You know\r\nhow I love being with you!"\r\n\r\nAnd she went into the house. Marya Konstantinovna sat her down and\r\ngave her coffee, regaled her with milk rolls, then showed her\r\nphotographs of her former pupils, the Garatynskys, who were by now\r\nmarried. She showed her, too, the examination reports of Kostya and\r\nKatya. The reports were very good, but to make them seem even better,\r\nshe complained, with a sigh, how difficult the lessons at school\r\nwere now. . . . She made much of her visitor, and was sorry for\r\nher, though at the same time she was harassed by the thought that\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna might have a corrupting influence on the morals\r\nof Kostya and Katya, and was glad that her Nikodim Alexandritch was\r\nnot at home. Seeing that in her opinion all men are fond of "women\r\nlike that," Nadyezhda Fyodorovna might have a bad effect on Nikodim\r\nAlexandritch too.\r\n\r\nAs she talked to her visitor, Marya Konstantinovna kept remembering\r\nthat they were to have a picnic that evening, and that Von Koren\r\nhad particularly begged her to say nothing about it to the "Japanese\r\nmonkeys"--that is, Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna; but she\r\ndropped a word about it unawares, crimsoned, and said in confusion:\r\n\r\n"I hope you will come too!"\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIt was agreed to drive about five miles out of town on the road to\r\nthe south, to stop near a _duhan_ at the junction of two streams\r\n--the Black River and the Yellow River--and to cook fish soup.\r\nThey started out soon after five. Foremost of the party in a\r\nchar-a-banc drove Samoylenko and Laevsky; they were followed by\r\nMarya Konstantinovna, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, Katya and Kostya, in a\r\ncoach with three horses, carrying with them the crockery and a\r\nbasket with provisions. In the next carriage came the police captain,\r\nKirilin, and the young Atchmianov, the son of the shopkeeper to\r\nwhom Nadyezhda Fyodorovna owed three hundred roubles; opposite them,\r\nhuddled up on the little seat with his feet tucked under him, sat\r\nNikodim Alexandritch, a neat little man with hair combed on to his\r\ntemples. Last of all came Von Koren and the deacon; at the deacon\'s\r\nfeet stood a basket of fish.\r\n\r\n"R-r-right!" Samoylenko shouted at the top of his voice when he met\r\na cart or a mountaineer riding on a donkey.\r\n\r\n"In two years\' time, when I shall have the means and the people\r\nready, I shall set off on an expedition," Von Koren was telling the\r\ndeacon. "I shall go by the sea-coast from Vladivostok to the Behring\r\nStraits, and then from the Straits to the mouth of the Yenisei. We\r\nshall make the map, study the fauna and the flora, and make detailed\r\ngeological, anthropological, and ethnographical researches. It\r\ndepends upon you to go with me or not."\r\n\r\n"It\'s impossible," said the deacon.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a man with ties and a family."\r\n\r\n"Your wife will let you go; we will provide for her. Better still\r\nif you were to persuade her for the public benefit to go into a\r\nnunnery; that would make it possible for you to become a monk, too,\r\nand join the expedition as a priest. I can arrange it for you."\r\n\r\nThe deacon was silent.\r\n\r\n"Do you know your theology well?" asked the zoologist.\r\n\r\n"No, rather badly."\r\n\r\n"H\'m! . . . I can\'t give you any advice on that score, because I\r\ndon\'t know much about theology myself. You give me a list of books\r\nyou need, and I will send them to you from Petersburg in the winter.\r\nIt will be necessary for you to read the notes of religious travellers,\r\ntoo; among them are some good ethnologists and Oriental scholars.\r\nWhen you are familiar with their methods, it will be easier for you\r\nto set to work. And you needn\'t waste your time till you get the\r\nbooks; come to me, and we will study the compass and go through a\r\ncourse of meteorology. All that\'s indispensable."\r\n\r\n"To be sure . . ." muttered the deacon, and he laughed. "I was\r\ntrying to get a place in Central Russia, and my uncle, the head\r\npriest, promised to help me. If I go with you I shall have troubled\r\nthem for nothing."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand your hesitation. If you go on being an ordinary\r\ndeacon, who is only obliged to hold a service on holidays, and on\r\nthe other days can rest from work, you will be exactly the same as\r\nyou are now in ten years\' time, and will have gained nothing but a\r\nbeard and moustache; while on returning from this expedition in ten\r\nyears\' time you will be a different man, you will be enriched by\r\nthe consciousness that something has been done by you."\r\n\r\nFrom the ladies\' carriage came shrieks of terror and delight. The\r\ncarriages were driving along a road hollowed in a literally overhanging\r\nprecipitous cliff, and it seemed to every one that they were galloping\r\nalong a shelf on a steep wall, and that in a moment the carriages\r\nwould drop into the abyss. On the right stretched the sea; on the\r\nleft was a rough brown wall with black blotches and red veins and\r\nwith climbing roots; while on the summit stood shaggy fir-trees\r\nbent over, as though looking down in terror and curiosity. A minute\r\nlater there were shrieks and laughter again: they had to drive under\r\na huge overhanging rock.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why the devil I\'m coming with you," said Laevsky.\r\n"How stupid and vulgar it is! I want to go to the North, to run\r\naway, to escape; but here I am, for some reason, going to this\r\nstupid picnic."\r\n\r\n"But look, what a view!" said Samoylenko as the horses turned to\r\nthe left, and the valley of the Yellow River came into sight and\r\nthe stream itself gleamed in the sunlight, yellow, turbid, frantic.\r\n\r\n"I see nothing fine in that, Sasha," answered Laevsky. "To be in\r\ncontinual ecstasies over nature shows poverty of imagination. In\r\ncomparison with what my imagination can give me, all these streams\r\nand rocks are trash, and nothing else."\r\n\r\nThe carriages now were by the banks of the stream. The high mountain\r\nbanks gradually grew closer, the valley shrank together and ended\r\nin a gorge; the rocky mountain round which they were driving had\r\nbeen piled together by nature out of huge rocks, pressing upon each\r\nother with such terrible weight, that Samoylenko could not help\r\ngasping every time he looked at them. The dark and beautiful mountain\r\nwas cleft in places by narrow fissures and gorges from which came\r\na breath of dewy moisture and mystery; through the gorges could be\r\nseen other mountains, brown, pink, lilac, smoky, or bathed in vivid\r\nsunlight. From time to time as they passed a gorge they caught the\r\nsound of water falling from the heights and splashing on the stones.\r\n\r\n"Ach, the damned mountains!" sighed Laevsky. "How sick I am of\r\nthem!"\r\n\r\nAt the place where the Black River falls into the Yellow, and the\r\nwater black as ink stains the yellow and struggles with it, stood\r\nthe Tatar Kerbalay\'s _duhan_, with the Russian flag on the roof and\r\nwith an inscription written in chalk: "The Pleasant _duhan_." Near\r\nit was a little garden, enclosed in a hurdle fence, with tables and\r\nchairs set out in it, and in the midst of a thicket of wretched\r\nthornbushes stood a single solitary cypress, dark and beautiful.\r\n\r\nKerbalay, a nimble little Tatar in a blue shirt and a white apron,\r\nwas standing in the road, and, holding his stomach, he bowed low\r\nto welcome the carriages, and smiled, showing his glistening white\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening, Kerbalay," shouted Samoylenko. "We are driving on a\r\nlittle further, and you take along the samovar and chairs! Look\r\nsharp!"\r\n\r\nKerbalay nodded his shaven head and muttered something, and only\r\nthose sitting in the last carriage could hear: "We\'ve got trout,\r\nyour Excellency."\r\n\r\n"Bring them, bring them!" said Von Koren.\r\n\r\nFive hundred paces from the _duhan_ the carriages stopped. Samoylenko\r\nselected a small meadow round which there were scattered stones\r\nconvenient for sitting on, and a fallen tree blown down by the storm\r\nwith roots overgrown by moss and dry yellow needles. Here there was\r\na fragile wooden bridge over the stream, and just opposite on the\r\nother bank there was a little barn for drying maize, standing on\r\nfour low piles, and looking like the hut on hen\'s legs in the fairy\r\ntale; a little ladder sloped from its door.\r\n\r\nThe first impression in all was a feeling that they would never get\r\nout of that place again. On all sides wherever they looked, the\r\nmountains rose up and towered above them, and the shadows of evening\r\nwere stealing rapidly, rapidly from the _duhan_ and dark cypress,\r\nmaking the narrow winding valley of the Black River narrower and\r\nthe mountains higher. They could hear the river murmuring and the\r\nunceasing chirrup of the grasshoppers.\r\n\r\n"Enchanting!" said Marya Konstantinovna, heaving deep sighs of\r\necstasy. "Children, look how fine! What peace!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it really is fine," assented Laevsky, who liked the view, and\r\nfor some reason felt sad as he looked at the sky and then at the\r\nblue smoke rising from the chimney of the _duhan_. "Yes, it is\r\nfine," he repeated.\r\n\r\n"Ivan Andreitch, describe this view," Marya Konstantinovna said\r\ntearfully.\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked Laevsky. "The impression is better than any description.\r\nThe wealth of sights and sounds which every one receives from nature\r\nby direct impression is ranted about by authors in a hideous and\r\nunrecognisable way."\r\n\r\n"Really?" Von Koren asked coldly, choosing the biggest stone by the\r\nside of the water, and trying to clamber up and sit upon it. "Really?"\r\nhe repeated, looking directly at Laevsky. "What of \'Romeo and\r\nJuliet\'? Or, for instance, Pushkin\'s \'Night in the Ukraine\'? Nature\r\nought to come and bow down at their feet."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said Laevsky, who was too lazy to think and oppose him.\r\n"Though what is \'Romeo and Juliet\' after all?" he added after a\r\nshort pause. "The beauty of poetry and holiness of love are simply\r\nthe roses under which they try to hide its rottenness. Romeo is\r\njust the same sort of animal as all the rest of us."\r\n\r\n"Whatever one talks to you about, you always bring it round to\r\n. . ." Von Koren glanced round at Katya and broke off.\r\n\r\n"What do I bring it round to?" asked Laevsky.\r\n\r\n"One tells you, for instance, how beautiful a bunch of grapes is,\r\nand you answer: \'Yes, but how ugly it is when it is chewed and\r\ndigested in one\'s stomach!\' Why say that? It\'s not new, and . . .\r\naltogether it is a queer habit."\r\n\r\nLaevsky knew that Von Koren did not like him, and so was afraid of\r\nhim, and felt in his presence as though every one were constrained\r\nand some one were standing behind his back. He made no answer and\r\nwalked away, feeling sorry he had come.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, quick march for brushwood for the fire!" commanded\r\nSamoylenko.\r\n\r\nThey all wandered off in different directions, and no one was left\r\nbut Kirilin, Atchmianov, and Nikodim Alexandritch. Kerbalay brought\r\nchairs, spread a rug on the ground, and set a few bottles of wine.\r\n\r\nThe police captain, Kirilin, a tall, good-looking man, who in all\r\nweathers wore his great-coat over his tunic, with his haughty\r\ndeportment, stately carriage, and thick, rather hoarse voice, looked\r\nlike a young provincial chief of police; his expression was mournful\r\nand sleepy, as though he had just been waked against his will.\r\n\r\n"What have you brought this for, you brute?" he asked Kerbalay,\r\ndeliberately articulating each word. "I ordered you to give us\r\n_kvarel_, and what have you brought, you ugly Tatar? Eh? What?"\r\n\r\n"We have plenty of wine of our own, Yegor Alekseitch," Nikodim\r\nAlexandritch observed, timidly and politely.\r\n\r\n"What? But I want us to have my wine, too; I\'m taking part in the\r\npicnic and I imagine I have full right to contribute my share. I\r\nim-ma-gine so! Bring ten bottles of _kvarel_."\r\n\r\n"Why so many?" asked Nikodim Alexandritch, in wonder, knowing Kirilin\r\nhad no money.\r\n\r\n"Twenty bottles! Thirty!" shouted Kirilin.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, let him," Atchmianov whispered to Nikodim Alexandritch;\r\n"I\'ll pay."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna was in a light-hearted, mischievous mood; she\r\nwanted to skip and jump, to laugh, to shout, to tease, to flirt.\r\nIn her cheap cotton dress with blue pansies on it, in her red shoes\r\nand the same straw hat, she seemed to herself, little, simple,\r\nlight, ethereal as a butterfly. She ran over the rickety bridge and\r\nlooked for a minute into the water, in order to feel giddy; then,\r\nshrieking and laughing, ran to the other side to the drying-shed,\r\nand she fancied that all the men were admiring her, even Kerbalay.\r\nWhen in the rapidly falling darkness the trees began to melt into\r\nthe mountains and the horses into the carriages, and a light gleamed\r\nin the windows of the _duhan_, she climbed up the mountain by the\r\nlittle path which zigzagged between stones and thorn-bushes and sat\r\non a stone. Down below, the camp-fire was burning. Near the fire,\r\nwith his sleeves tucked up, the deacon was moving to and fro, and\r\nhis long black shadow kept describing a circle round it; he put on\r\nwood, and with a spoon tied to a long stick he stirred the cauldron.\r\nSamoylenko, with a copper-red face, was fussing round the fire just\r\nas though he were in his own kitchen, shouting furiously:\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the salt, gentlemen? I bet you\'ve forgotten it. Why are\r\nyou all sitting about like lords while I do the work?"\r\n\r\nLaevsky and Nikodim Alexandritch were sitting side by side on the\r\nfallen tree looking pensively at the fire. Marya Konstantinovna,\r\nKatya, and Kostya were taking the cups, saucers, and plates out of\r\nthe baskets. Von Koren, with his arms folded and one foot on a\r\nstone, was standing on a bank at the very edge of the water, thinking\r\nabout something. Patches of red light from the fire moved together\r\nwith the shadows over the ground near the dark human figures, and\r\nquivered on the mountain, on the trees, on the bridge, on the\r\ndrying-shed; on the other side the steep, scooped-out bank was all\r\nlighted up and glimmering in the stream, and the rushing turbid\r\nwater broke its reflection into little bits.\r\n\r\nThe deacon went for the fish which Kerbalay was cleaning and washing\r\non the bank, but he stood still half-way and looked about him.\r\n\r\n"My God, how nice it is!" he thought. "People, rocks, the fire, the\r\ntwilight, a monstrous tree--nothing more, and yet how fine it\r\nis!"\r\n\r\nOn the further bank some unknown persons made their appearance near\r\nthe drying-shed. The flickering light and the smoke from the camp-fire\r\npuffing in that direction made it impossible to get a full view of\r\nthem all at once, but glimpses were caught now of a shaggy hat and\r\na grey beard, now of a blue shirt, now of a figure, ragged from\r\nshoulder to knee, with a dagger across the body; then a swarthy\r\nyoung face with black eyebrows, as thick and bold as though they\r\nhad been drawn in charcoal. Five of them sat in a circle on the\r\nground, and the other five went into the drying-shed. One was\r\nstanding at the door with his back to the fire, and with his hands\r\nbehind his back was telling something, which must have been very\r\ninteresting, for when Samoylenko threw on twigs and the fire flared\r\nup, and scattered sparks and threw a glaring light on the shed, two\r\ncalm countenances with an expression on them of deep attention could\r\nbe seen, looking out of the door, while those who were sitting in\r\na circle turned round and began listening to the speaker. Soon\r\nafter, those sitting in a circle began softly singing something\r\nslow and melodious, that sounded like Lenten Church music. . . .\r\nListening to them, the deacon imagined how it would be with him in\r\nten years\' time, when he would come back from the expedition: he\r\nwould be a young priest and monk, an author with a name and a\r\nsplendid past; he would be consecrated an archimandrite, then a\r\nbishop; and he would serve mass in the cathedral; in a golden mitre\r\nhe would come out into the body of the church with the ikon on his\r\nbreast, and blessing the mass of the people with the triple and the\r\ndouble candelabra, would proclaim: "Look down from Heaven, O God,\r\nbehold and visit this vineyard which Thy Hand has planted," and the\r\nchildren with their angel voices would sing in response: "Holy\r\nGod. . ."\r\n\r\n"Deacon, where is that fish?" he heard Samoylenko\'s voice.\r\n\r\nAs he went back to the fire, the deacon imagined the Church procession\r\ngoing along a dusty road on a hot July day; in front the peasants\r\ncarrying the banners and the women and children the ikons, then the\r\nboy choristers and the sacristan with his face tied up and a straw\r\nin his hair, then in due order himself, the deacon, and behind him\r\nthe priest wearing his _calotte_ and carrying a cross, and behind\r\nthem, tramping in the dust, a crowd of peasants--men, women, and\r\nchildren; in the crowd his wife and the priest\'s wife with kerchiefs\r\non their heads. The choristers sing, the babies cry, the corncrakes\r\ncall, the lark carols. . . . Then they make a stand and sprinkle\r\nthe herd with holy water. . . . They go on again, and then kneeling\r\npray for rain. Then lunch and talk. . . .\r\n\r\n"And that\'s nice too . . ." thought the deacon.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nKirilin and Atchmianov climbed up the mountain by the path. Atchmianov\r\ndropped behind and stopped, while Kirilin went up to Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening," he said, touching his cap.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening."\r\n\r\n"Yes!" said Kirilin, looking at the sky and pondering.\r\n\r\n"Why \'yes\'?" asked Nadyezhda Fyodorovna after a brief pause, noticing\r\nthat Atchmianov was watching them both.\r\n\r\n"And so it seems," said the officer, slowly, "that our love has\r\nwithered before it has blossomed, so to speak. How do you wish me\r\nto understand it? Is it a sort of coquetry on your part, or do you\r\nlook upon me as a nincompoop who can be treated as you choose."\r\n\r\n"It was a mistake! Leave me alone!" Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said\r\nsharply, on that beautiful, marvellous evening, looking at him with\r\nterror and asking herself with bewilderment, could there really\r\nhave been a moment when that man attracted her and had been near\r\nto her?\r\n\r\n"So that\'s it!" said Kirilin; he thought in silence for a few minutes\r\nand said: "Well, I\'ll wait till you are in a better humour, and\r\nmeanwhile I venture to assure you I am a gentleman, and I don\'t\r\nallow any one to doubt it. Adieu!"\r\n\r\nHe touched his cap again and walked off, making his way between the\r\nbushes. After a short interval Atchmianov approached hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n"What a fine evening!" he said with a slight Armenian accent.\r\n\r\nHe was nice-looking, fashionably dressed, and behaved unaffectedly\r\nlike a well-bred youth, but Nadyezhda Fyodorovna did not like him\r\nbecause she owed his father three hundred roubles; it was displeasing\r\nto her, too, that a shopkeeper had been asked to the picnic, and\r\nshe was vexed at his coming up to her that evening when her heart\r\nfelt so pure.\r\n\r\n"The picnic is a success altogether," he said, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she agreed, and as though suddenly remembering her debt, she\r\nsaid carelessly: "Oh, tell them in your shop that Ivan Andreitch\r\nwill come round in a day or two and will pay three hundred roubles\r\n. . . . I don\'t remember exactly what it is."\r\n\r\n"I would give another three hundred if you would not mention that\r\ndebt every day. Why be prosaic?"\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna laughed; the amusing idea occurred to her that\r\nif she had been willing and sufficiently immoral she might in one\r\nminute be free from her debt. If she, for instance, were to turn\r\nthe head of this handsome young fool! How amusing, absurd, wild it\r\nwould be really! And she suddenly felt a longing to make him love\r\nher, to plunder him, throw him over, and then to see what would\r\ncome of it.\r\n\r\n"Allow me to give you one piece of advice," Atchmianov said timidly.\r\n"I beg you to beware of Kirilin. He says horrible things about you\r\neverywhere."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t interest me to know what every fool says of me," Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna said coldly, and the amusing thought of playing with\r\nhandsome young Atchmianov suddenly lost its charm.\r\n\r\n"We must go down," she said; "they\'re calling us."\r\n\r\nThe fish soup was ready by now. They were ladling it out by platefuls,\r\nand eating it with the religious solemnity with which this is only\r\ndone at a picnic; and every one thought the fish soup very good,\r\nand thought that at home they had never eaten anything so nice. As\r\nis always the case at picnics, in the mass of dinner napkins,\r\nparcels, useless greasy papers fluttering in the wind, no one knew\r\nwhere was his glass or where his bread. They poured the wine on the\r\ncarpet and on their own knees, spilt the salt, while it was dark\r\nall round them and the fire burnt more dimly, and every one was too\r\nlazy to get up and put wood on. They all drank wine, and even gave\r\nKostya and Katya half a glass each. Nadyezhda Fyodorovna drank one\r\nglass and then another, got a little drunk and forgot about Kirilin.\r\n\r\n"A splendid picnic, an enchanting evening," said Laevsky, growing\r\nlively with the wine. "But I should prefer a fine winter to all\r\nthis. \'His beaver collar is silver with hoar-frost.\'"\r\n\r\n"Every one to his taste," observed Von Koren.\r\n\r\nLaevsky felt uncomfortable; the heat of the campfire was beating\r\nupon his back, and the hatred of Von Koren upon his breast and face:\r\nthis hatred on the part of a decent, clever man, a feeling in which\r\nthere probably lay hid a well-grounded reason, humiliated him and\r\nenervated him, and unable to stand up against it, he said in a\r\npropitiatory tone:\r\n\r\n"I am passionately fond of nature, and I regret that I\'m not a\r\nnaturalist. I envy you."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t envy you, and don\'t regret it," said Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna. "I don\'t understand how any one can seriously interest\r\nhimself in beetles and ladybirds while the people are suffering."\r\n\r\nLaevsky shared her opinion. He was absolutely ignorant of natural\r\nscience, and so could never reconcile himself to the authoritative\r\ntone and the learned and profound air of the people who devoted\r\nthemselves to the whiskers of ants and the claws of beetles, and\r\nhe always felt vexed that these people, relying on these whiskers,\r\nclaws, and something they called protoplasm (he always imagined it\r\nin the form of an oyster), should undertake to decide questions\r\ninvolving the origin and life of man. But in Nadyezhda Fyodorovna\'s\r\nwords he heard a note of falsity, and simply to contradict her he\r\nsaid: "The point is not the ladybirds, but the deductions made from\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nIt was late, eleven o\'clock, when they began to get into the carriages\r\nto go home. They took their seats, and the only ones missing were\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna and Atchmianov, who were running after one\r\nanother, laughing, the other side of the stream.\r\n\r\n"Make haste, my friends," shouted Samoylenko.\r\n\r\n"You oughtn\'t to give ladies wine," said Von Koren in a low voice.\r\n\r\nLaevsky, exhausted by the picnic, by the hatred of Von Koren, and\r\nby his own thoughts, went to meet Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and when,\r\ngay and happy, feeling light as a feather, breathless and laughing,\r\nshe took him by both hands and laid her head on his breast, he\r\nstepped back and said dryly:\r\n\r\n"You are behaving like a . . . cocotte."\r\n\r\nIt sounded horribly coarse, so that he felt sorry for her at once.\r\nOn his angry, exhausted face she read hatred, pity and vexation\r\nwith himself, and her heart sank at once. She realised instantly\r\nthat she had gone too far, had been too free and easy in her\r\nbehaviour, and overcome with misery, feeling herself heavy, stout,\r\ncoarse, and drunk, she got into the first empty carriage together\r\nwith Atchmianov. Laevsky got in with Kirilin, the zoologist with\r\nSamoylenko, the deacon with the ladies, and the party set off.\r\n\r\n"You see what the Japanese monkeys are like," Von Koren began,\r\nrolling himself up in his cloak and shutting his eyes. "You heard\r\nshe doesn\'t care to take an interest in beetles and ladybirds because\r\nthe people are suffering. That\'s how all the Japanese monkeys look\r\nupon people like us. They\'re a slavish, cunning race, terrified by\r\nthe whip and the fist for ten generations; they tremble and burn\r\nincense only before violence; but let the monkey into a free state\r\nwhere there\'s no one to take it by the collar, and it relaxes at\r\nonce and shows itself in its true colours. Look how bold they are\r\nin picture galleries, in museums, in theatres, or when they talk\r\nof science: they puff themselves out and get excited, they are\r\nabusive and critical . . . they are bound to criticise--it\'s the\r\nsign of the slave. You listen: men of the liberal professions are\r\nmore often sworn at than pickpockets--that\'s because three-quarters\r\nof society are made up of slaves, of just such monkeys. It never\r\nhappens that a slave holds out his hand to you and sincerely says\r\n\'Thank you\' to you for your work."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you want," said Samoylenko, yawning; "the poor\r\nthing, in the simplicity of her heart, wanted to talk to you of\r\nscientific subjects, and you draw a conclusion from that. You\'re\r\ncross with him for something or other, and with her, too, to keep\r\nhim company. She\'s a splendid woman."\r\n\r\n"Ah, nonsense! An ordinary kept woman, depraved and vulgar. Listen,\r\nAlexandr Daviditch; when you meet a simple peasant woman, who isn\'t\r\nliving with her husband, who does nothing but giggle, you tell her\r\nto go and work. Why are you timid in this case and afraid to tell\r\nthe truth? Simply because Nadyezhda Fyodorovna is kept, not by a\r\nsailor, but by an official."\r\n\r\n"What am I to do with her?" said Samoylenko, getting angry. "Beat\r\nher or what?\r\n\r\n"Not flatter vice. We curse vice only behind its back, and that\'s\r\nlike making a long nose at it round a corner. I am a zoologist or\r\na sociologist, which is the same thing; you are a doctor; society\r\nbelieves in us; we ought to point out the terrible harm which\r\nthreatens it and the next generation from the existence of ladies\r\nlike Nadyezhda Ivanovna."\r\n\r\n"Fyodorovna," Samoylenko corrected. "But what ought society to do?"\r\n\r\n"Society? That\'s its affair. To my thinking the surest and most\r\ndirect method is--compulsion. _Manu militari_ she ought to be\r\nreturned to her husband; and if her husband won\'t take her in, then\r\nshe ought to be sent to penal servitude or some house of correction."\r\n\r\n"Ouf!" sighed Samoylenko. He paused and asked quietly: "You said\r\nthe other day that people like Laevsky ought to be destroyed. . . .\r\nTell me, if you . . . if the State or society commissioned you\r\nto destroy him, could you . . . bring yourself to it?"\r\n\r\n"My hand would not tremble."\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nWhen they got home, Laevsky and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna went into their\r\ndark, stuffy, dull rooms. Both were silent. Laevsky lighted a candle,\r\nwhile Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sat down, and without taking off her\r\ncloak and hat, lifted her melancholy, guilty eyes to him.\r\n\r\nHe knew that she expected an explanation from him, but an explanation\r\nwould be wearisome, useless and exhausting, and his heart was heavy\r\nbecause he had lost control over himself and been rude to her. He\r\nchanced to feel in his pocket the letter which he had been intending\r\nevery day to read to her, and thought if he were to show her that\r\nletter now, it would turn her thoughts in another direction.\r\n\r\n"It is time to define our relations," he thought. "I will give it\r\nher; what is to be will be."\r\n\r\nHe took out the letter and gave it her.\r\n\r\n"Read it. It concerns you."\r\n\r\nSaying this, he went into his own room and lay down on the sofa in\r\nthe dark without a pillow. Nadyezhda Fyodorovna read the letter,\r\nand it seemed to her as though the ceiling were falling and the\r\nwalls were closing in on her. It seemed suddenly dark and shut in\r\nand terrible. She crossed herself quickly three times and said:\r\n\r\n"Give him peace, O Lord . . . give him peace. . . ."\r\n\r\nAnd she began crying.\r\n\r\n"Vanya," she called. "Ivan Andreitch!"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. Thinking that Laevsky had come in and was\r\nstanding behind her chair, she sobbed like a child, and said:\r\n\r\n"Why did you not tell me before that he was dead? I wouldn\'t have\r\ngone to the picnic; I shouldn\'t have laughed so horribly. . . . The\r\nmen said horrid things to me. What a sin, what a sin! Save me,\r\nVanya, save me. . . . I have been mad. . . . I am lost. . . ."\r\n\r\nLaevsky heard her sobs. He felt stifled and his heart was beating\r\nviolently. In his misery he got up, stood in the middle of the room,\r\ngroped his way in the dark to an easy-chair by the table, and sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n"This is a prison . . ." he thought. "I must get away . . . I can\'t\r\nbear it."\r\n\r\nIt was too late to go and play cards; there were no restaurants in\r\nthe town. He lay down again and covered his ears that he might not\r\nhear her sobbing, and he suddenly remembered that he could go to\r\nSamoylenko. To avoid going near Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, he got out\r\nof the window into the garden, climbed over the garden fence and\r\nwent along the street. It was dark. A steamer, judging by its lights,\r\na big passenger one, had just come in. He heard the clank of the\r\nanchor chain. A red light was moving rapidly from the shore in the\r\ndirection of the steamer: it was the Customs boat going out to it.\r\n\r\n"The passengers are asleep in their cabins . . ." thought Laevsky,\r\nand he envied the peace of mind of other people.\r\n\r\nThe windows in Samoylenko\'s house were open. Laevsky looked in at\r\none of them, then in at another; it was dark and still in the rooms.\r\n\r\n"Alexandr Daviditch, are you asleep?" he called. "Alexandr Daviditch!"\r\n\r\nHe heard a cough and an uneasy shout:\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there? What the devil?"\r\n\r\n"It is I, Alexandr Daviditch; excuse me."\r\n\r\nA little later the door opened; there was a glow of soft light from\r\nthe lamp, and Samoylenko\'s huge figure appeared all in white, with\r\na white nightcap on his head.\r\n\r\n"What now?" he asked, scratching himself and breathing hard from\r\nsleepiness. "Wait a minute; I\'ll open the door directly."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t trouble; I\'ll get in at the window. . . ."\r\n\r\nLaevsky climbed in at the window, and when he reached Samoylenko,\r\nseized him by the hand.\r\n\r\n"Alexandr Daviditch," he said in a shaking voice, "save me! I beseech\r\nyou, I implore you. Understand me! My position is agonising. If it\r\ngoes on for another two days I shall strangle myself like . . .\r\nlike a dog."\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit. . . . What are you talking about exactly?"\r\n\r\n"Light a candle."\r\n\r\n"Oh . . . oh! . . ." sighed Samoylenko, lighting a candle. "My God!\r\nMy God! . . . Why, it\'s past one, brother."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, but I can\'t stay at home," said Laevsky, feeling great\r\ncomfort from the light and the presence of Samoylenko. "You are my\r\nbest, my only friend, Alexandr Daviditch. . . . You are my only\r\nhope. For God\'s sake, come to my rescue, whether you want to or\r\nnot. I must get away from here, come what may! . . . Lend me the\r\nmoney!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my God, my God! . . ." sighed Samoylenko, scratching himself.\r\n"I was dropping asleep and I hear the whistle of the steamer, and\r\nnow you . . . Do you want much?"\r\n\r\n"Three hundred roubles at least. I must leave her a hundred, and I\r\nneed two hundred for the journey. . . . I owe you about four hundred\r\nalready, but I will send it you all . . . all. . . ."\r\n\r\nSamoylenko took hold of both his whiskers in one hand, and standing\r\nwith his legs wide apart, pondered.\r\n\r\n"Yes . . ." he muttered, musing. "Three hundred. . . . Yes. . . .\r\nBut I haven\'t got so much. I shall have to borrow it from some one."\r\n\r\n"Borrow it, for God\'s sake!" said Laevsky, seeing from Samoylenko\'s\r\nface that he wanted to lend him the money and certainly would lend\r\nit. "Borrow it, and I\'ll be sure to pay you back. I will send it\r\nfrom Petersburg as soon as I get there. You can set your mind at\r\nrest about that. I\'ll tell you what, Sasha," he said, growing more\r\nanimated; "let us have some wine."\r\n\r\n"Yes . . . we can have some wine, too."\r\n\r\nThey both went into the dining-room.\r\n\r\n"And how about Nadyezhda Fyodorovna?" asked Samoylenko, setting\r\nthree bottles and a plate of peaches on the table. "Surely she\'s\r\nnot remaining?"\r\n\r\n"I will arrange it all, I will arrange it all," said Laevsky, feeling\r\nan unexpected rush of joy. "I will send her the money afterwards\r\nand she will join me. . . . Then we will define our relations. To\r\nyour health, friend."\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit," said Samoylenko. "Drink this first. . . . This is\r\nfrom my vineyard. This bottle is from Navaridze\'s vineyard and this\r\none is from Ahatulov\'s. . . . Try all three kinds and tell me\r\ncandidly. . . . There seems a little acidity about mine. Eh? Don\'t\r\nyou taste it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. You have comforted me, Alexandr Daviditch. Thank you. . . .\r\nI feel better."\r\n\r\n"Is there any acidity?"\r\n\r\n"Goodness only knows, I don\'t know. But you are a splendid, wonderful\r\nman!"\r\n\r\nLooking at his pale, excited, good-natured face, Samoylenko remembered\r\nVon Koren\'s view that men like that ought to be destroyed, and\r\nLaevsky seemed to him a weak, defenceless child, whom any one could\r\ninjure and destroy.\r\n\r\n"And when you go, make it up with your mother," he said. "It\'s not\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; I certainly shall."\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a while. When they had emptied the first bottle,\r\nSamoylenko said:\r\n\r\n"You ought to make it up with Von Koren too. You are both such\r\nsplendid, clever fellows, and you glare at each other like wolves."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he\'s a fine, very intelligent fellow," Laevsky assented, ready\r\nnow to praise and forgive every one. "He\'s a remarkable man, but\r\nit\'s impossible for me to get on with him. No! Our natures are too\r\ndifferent. I\'m an indolent, weak, submissive nature. Perhaps in a\r\ngood minute I might hold out my hand to him, but he would turn away\r\nfrom me . . . with contempt."\r\n\r\nLaevsky took a sip of wine, walked from corner to corner and went\r\non, standing in the middle of the room:\r\n\r\n"I understand Von Koren very well. His is a resolute, strong,\r\ndespotic nature. You have heard him continually talking of \'the\r\nexpedition,\' and it\'s not mere talk. He wants the wilderness, the\r\nmoonlit night: all around in little tents, under the open sky, lie\r\nsleeping his sick and hungry Cossacks, guides, porters, doctor,\r\npriest, all exhausted with their weary marches, while only he is\r\nawake, sitting like Stanley on a camp-stool, feeling himself the\r\nmonarch of the desert and the master of these men. He goes on and\r\non and on, his men groan and die, one after another, and he goes\r\non and on, and in the end perishes himself, but still is monarch\r\nand ruler of the desert, since the cross upon his tomb can be seen\r\nby the caravans for thirty or forty miles over the desert. I am\r\nsorry the man is not in the army. He would have made a splendid\r\nmilitary genius. He would not have hesitated to drown his cavalry\r\nin the river and make a bridge out of dead bodies. And such hardihood\r\nis more needed in war than any kind of fortification or strategy.\r\nOh, I understand him perfectly! Tell me: why is he wasting his\r\nsubstance here? What does he want here?"\r\n\r\n"He is studying the marine fauna."\r\n\r\n"No, no, brother, no!" Laevsky sighed. "A scientific man who was\r\non the steamer told me the Black Sea was poor in animal life, and\r\nthat in its depths, thanks to the abundance of sulphuric hydrogen,\r\norganic life was impossible. All the serious zoologists work at the\r\nbiological station at Naples or Villefranche. But Von Koren is\r\nindependent and obstinate: he works on the Black Sea because nobody\r\nelse is working there; he is at loggerheads with the university,\r\ndoes not care to know his comrades and other scientific men because\r\nhe is first of all a despot and only secondly a zoologist. And\r\nyou\'ll see he\'ll do something. He is already dreaming that when he\r\ncomes back from his expedition he will purify our universities from\r\nintrigue and mediocrity, and will make the scientific men mind their\r\np\'s and q\'s. Despotism is just as strong in science as in the army.\r\nAnd he is spending his second summer in this stinking little town\r\nbecause he would rather be first in a village than second in a town.\r\nHere he is a king and an eagle; he keeps all the inhabitants under\r\nhis thumb and oppresses them with his authority. He has appropriated\r\nevery one, he meddles in other people\'s affairs; everything is of\r\nuse to him, and every one is afraid of him. I am slipping out of\r\nhis clutches, he feels that and hates me. Hasn\'t he told you that\r\nI ought to be destroyed or sent to hard labour?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," laughed Samoylenko.\r\n\r\nLaevsky laughed too, and drank some wine.\r\n\r\n"His ideals are despotic too," he said, laughing, and biting a\r\npeach. "Ordinary mortals think of their neighbour--me, you, man\r\nin fact--if they work for the common weal. To Von Koren men are\r\npuppets and nonentities, too trivial to be the object of his life.\r\nHe works, will go for his expedition and break his neck there, not\r\nfor the sake of love for his neighbour, but for the sake of such\r\nabstractions as humanity, future generations, an ideal race of men.\r\nHe exerts himself for the improvement of the human race, and we are\r\nin his eyes only slaves, food for the cannon, beasts of burden;\r\nsome he would destroy or stow away in Siberia, others he would break\r\nby discipline, would, like Araktcheev, force them to get up and go\r\nto bed to the sound of the drum; would appoint eunuchs to preserve\r\nour chastity and morality, would order them to fire at any one who\r\nsteps out of the circle of our narrow conservative morality; and\r\nall this in the name of the improvement of the human race. . . .\r\nAnd what is the human race? Illusion, mirage . . . despots have\r\nalways been illusionists. I understand him very well, brother. I\r\nappreciate him and don\'t deny his importance; this world rests on\r\nmen like him, and if the world were left only to such men as us,\r\nfor all our good-nature and good intentions, we should make as great\r\na mess of it as the flies have of that picture. Yes."\r\n\r\nLaevsky sat down beside Samoylenko, and said with genuine feeling:\r\n"I\'m a foolish, worthless, depraved man. The air I breathe, this\r\nwine, love, life in fact--for all that, I have given nothing in\r\nexchange so far but lying, idleness, and cowardice. Till now I have\r\ndeceived myself and other people; I have been miserable about it,\r\nand my misery was cheap and common. I bow my back humbly before Von\r\nKoren\'s hatred because at times I hate and despise myself."\r\n\r\nLaevsky began again pacing from one end of the room to the other\r\nin excitement, and said:\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad I see my faults clearly and am conscious of them. That\r\nwill help me to reform and become a different man. My dear fellow,\r\nif only you knew how passionately, with what anguish, I long for\r\nsuch a change. And I swear to you I\'ll be a man! I will! I don\'t\r\nknow whether it is the wine that is speaking in me, or whether it\r\nreally is so, but it seems to me that it is long since I have spent\r\nsuch pure and lucid moments as I have just now with you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s time to sleep, brother," said Samoylenko.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. . . . Excuse me; I\'ll go directly."\r\n\r\nLaevsky moved hurriedly about the furniture and windows, looking\r\nfor his cap.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," he muttered, sighing. "Thank you. . . . Kind and\r\nfriendly words are better than charity. You have given me new life."\r\n\r\nHe found his cap, stopped, and looked guiltily at Samoylenko.\r\n\r\n"Alexandr Daviditch," he said in an imploring voice.\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Let me stay the night with you, my dear fellow!"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. . . . Why not?"\r\n\r\nLaevsky lay down on the sofa, and went on talking to the doctor for\r\na long time.\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nThree days after the picnic, Marya Konstantinovna unexpectedly\r\ncalled on Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and without greeting her or taking\r\noff her hat, seized her by both hands, pressed them to her breast\r\nand said in great excitement:\r\n\r\n"My dear, I am deeply touched and moved: our dear kind-hearted\r\ndoctor told my Nikodim Alexandritch yesterday that your husband was\r\ndead. Tell me, my dear . . . tell me, is it true?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s true; he is dead," answered Nadyezhda Fyodorovna.\r\n\r\n"That is awful, awful, my dear! But there\'s no evil without some\r\ncompensation; your husband was no doubt a noble, wonderful, holy\r\nman, and such are more needed in Heaven than on earth."\r\n\r\nEvery line and feature in Marya Konstantinovna\'s face began quivering\r\nas though little needles were jumping up and down under her skin;\r\nshe gave an almond-oily smile and said, breathlessly, enthusiastically:\r\n\r\n"And so you are free, my dear. You can hold your head high now, and\r\nlook people boldly in the face. Henceforth God and man will bless\r\nyour union with Ivan Andreitch. It\'s enchanting. I am trembling\r\nwith joy, I can find no words. My dear, I will give you away. . . .\r\nNikodim Alexandritch and I have been so fond of you, you will\r\nallow us to give our blessing to your pure, lawful union. When,\r\nwhen do you think of being married?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t thought of it," said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, freeing her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n"That\'s impossible, my dear. You have thought of it, you have."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I haven\'t," said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, laughing.\r\n"What should we be married for? I see no necessity for it. We\'ll\r\ngo on living as we have lived."\r\n\r\n"What are you saying!" cried Marya Konstantinovna in horror. "For\r\nGod\'s sake, what are you saying!"\r\n\r\n"Our getting married won\'t make things any better. On the contrary,\r\nit will make them even worse. We shall lose our freedom."\r\n\r\n"My dear, my dear, what are you saying!" exclaimed Marya Konstantinovna,\r\nstepping back and flinging up her hands. "You are talking wildly!\r\nThink what you are saying. You must settle down!"\r\n\r\n"\'Settle down.\' How do you mean? I have not lived yet, and you\r\ntell me to settle down."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna reflected that she really had not lived. She\r\nhad finished her studies in a boarding-school and had been married\r\nto a man she did not love; then she had thrown in her lot with\r\nLaevsky, and had spent all her time with him on this empty, desolate\r\ncoast, always expecting something better. Was that life?\r\n\r\n"I ought to be married though," she thought, but remembering Kirilin\r\nand Atchmianov she flushed and said:\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s impossible. Even if Ivan Andreitch begged me to on his\r\nknees--even then I would refuse."\r\n\r\nMarya Konstantinovna sat on the sofa for a minute in silence, grave\r\nand mournful, gazing fixedly into space; then she got up and said\r\ncoldly:\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, my dear! Forgive me for having troubled you. Though it\'s\r\nnot easy for me, it\'s my duty to tell you that from this day all\r\nis over between us, and, in spite of my profound respect for Ivan\r\nAndreitch, the door of my house is closed to you henceforth."\r\n\r\nShe uttered these words with great solemnity and was herself\r\noverwhelmed by her solemn tone. Her face began quivering again; it\r\nassumed a soft almond-oily expression. She held out both hands to\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna, who was overcome with alarm and confusion,\r\nand said in an imploring voice:\r\n\r\n"My dear, allow me if only for a moment to be a mother or an elder\r\nsister to you! I will be as frank with you as a mother."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna felt in her bosom warmth, gladness, and pity\r\nfor herself, as though her own mother had really risen up and were\r\nstanding before her. She impulsively embraced Marya Konstantinovna\r\nand pressed her face to her shoulder. Both of them shed tears. They\r\nsat down on the sofa and for a few minutes sobbed without looking\r\nat one another or being able to utter a word.\r\n\r\n"My dear child," began Marya Konstantinovna, "I will tell you some\r\nharsh truths, without sparing you."\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake, for God\'s sake, do!"\r\n\r\n"Trust me, my dear. You remember of all the ladies here, I was the\r\nonly one to receive you. You horrified me from the very first day,\r\nbut I had not the heart to treat you with disdain like all the rest.\r\nI grieved over dear, good Ivan Andreitch as though he were my son\r\n--a young man in a strange place, inexperienced, weak, with no\r\nmother; and I was worried, dreadfully worried. . . . My husband was\r\nopposed to our making his acquaintance, but I talked him over . . .\r\npersuaded him. . . . We began receiving Ivan Andreitch, and with\r\nhim, of course, you. If we had not, he would have been insulted. I\r\nhave a daughter, a son. . . . You understand the tender mind, the\r\npure heart of childhood . . . \'who so offendeth one of these little\r\nones.\' . . . I received you into my house and trembled for my\r\nchildren. Oh, when you become a mother, you will understand my\r\nfears. And every one was surprised at my receiving you, excuse my\r\nsaying so, as a respectable woman, and hinted to me . . . well, of\r\ncourse, slanders, suppositions. . . . At the bottom of my heart I\r\nblamed you, but you were unhappy, flighty, to be pitied, and my\r\nheart was wrung with pity for you."\r\n\r\n"But why, why?" asked Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, trembling all over.\r\n"What harm have I done any one?"\r\n\r\n"You are a terrible sinner. You broke the vow you made your husband\r\nat the altar. You seduced a fine young man, who perhaps had he not\r\nmet you might have taken a lawful partner for life from a good\r\nfamily in his own circle, and would have been like every one else\r\nnow. You have ruined his youth. Don\'t speak, don\'t speak, my dear!\r\nI never believe that man is to blame for our sins. It is always the\r\nwoman\'s fault. Men are frivolous in domestic life; they are guided\r\nby their minds, and not by their hearts. There\'s a great deal they\r\ndon\'t understand; woman understands it all. Everything depends on\r\nher. To her much is given and from her much will be required. Oh,\r\nmy dear, if she had been more foolish or weaker than man on that\r\nside, God would not have entrusted her with the education of boys\r\nand girls. And then, my dear, you entered on the path of vice,\r\nforgetting all modesty; any other woman in your place would have\r\nhidden herself from people, would have sat shut up at home, and\r\nwould only have been seen in the temple of God, pale, dressed all\r\nin black and weeping, and every one would have said in genuine\r\ncompassion: \'O Lord, this erring angel is coming back again to Thee\r\n. . . .\' But you, my dear, have forgotten all discretion; have lived\r\nopenly, extravagantly; have seemed to be proud of your sin; you\r\nhave been gay and laughing, and I, looking at you, shuddered with\r\nhorror, and have been afraid that thunder from Heaven would strike\r\nour house while you were sitting with us. My dear, don\'t speak,\r\ndon\'t speak," cried Marya Konstantinovna, observing that Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna wanted to speak. "Trust me, I will not deceive you, I\r\nwill not hide one truth from the eyes of your soul. Listen to me,\r\nmy dear. . . . God marks great sinners, and you have been marked-out:\r\nonly think--your costumes have always been appalling."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna, who had always had the highest opinion of her\r\ncostumes, left off crying and looked at her with surprise.\r\n\r\n"Yes, appalling," Marya Konstantinovna went on. "Any one could judge\r\nof your behaviour from the elaboration and gaudiness of your attire.\r\nPeople laughed and shrugged their shoulders as they looked at you,\r\nand I grieved, I grieved. . . . And forgive me, my dear; you are\r\nnot nice in your person! When we met in the bathing-place, you made\r\nme tremble. Your outer clothing was decent enough, but your petticoat,\r\nyour chemise. . . . My dear, I blushed! Poor Ivan Andreitch! No one\r\never ties his cravat properly, and from his linen and his boots,\r\npoor fellow! one can see he has no one at home to look after him.\r\nAnd he is always hungry, my darling, and of course, if there is no\r\none at home to think of the samovar and the coffee, one is forced\r\nto spend half one\'s salary at the pavilion. And it\'s simply awful,\r\nawful in your home! No one else in the town has flies, but there\'s\r\nno getting rid of them in your rooms: all the plates and dishes are\r\nblack with them. If you look at the windows and the chairs, there\'s\r\nnothing but dust, dead flies, and glasses. . . . What do you want\r\nglasses standing about for? And, my dear, the table\'s not cleared\r\ntill this time in the day. And one\'s ashamed to go into your bedroom:\r\nunderclothes flung about everywhere, india-rubber tubes hanging on\r\nthe walls, pails and basins standing about. . . . My dear! A husband\r\nought to know nothing, and his wife ought to be as neat as a little\r\nangel in his presence. I wake up every morning before it is light,\r\nand wash my face with cold water that my Nikodim Alexandritch may\r\nnot see me looking drowsy."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all nonsense," Nadyezhda Fyodorovna sobbed. "If only I were\r\nhappy, but I am so unhappy!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; you are very unhappy!" Marya Konstantinovna sighed,\r\nhardly able to restrain herself from weeping. "And there\'s terrible\r\ngrief in store for you in the future! A solitary old age, ill-health;\r\nand then you will have to answer at the dread judgment seat. . .\r\nIt\'s awful, awful. Now fate itself holds out to you a helping hand,\r\nand you madly thrust it from you. Be married, make haste and be\r\nmarried!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we must, we must," said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna; "but it\'s\r\nimpossible!"\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s impossible. Oh, if only you knew!"\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna had an impulse to tell her about Kirilin, and\r\nhow the evening before she had met handsome young Atchmianov at the\r\nharbour, and how the mad, ridiculous idea had occurred to her of\r\ncancelling her debt for three hundred; it had amused her very much,\r\nand she returned home late in the evening feeling that she had sold\r\nherself and was irrevocably lost. She did not know herself how it\r\nhad happened. And she longed to swear to Marya Konstantinovna that\r\nshe would certainly pay that debt, but sobs and shame prevented her\r\nfrom speaking.\r\n\r\n"I am going away," she said. "Ivan Andreitch may stay, but I am\r\ngoing."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"To Russia."\r\n\r\n"But how will you live there? Why, you have nothing."\r\n\r\n"I will do translation, or . . . or I will open a library . . . ."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let your fancy run away with you, my dear. You must have\r\nmoney for a library. Well, I will leave you now, and you calm\r\nyourself and think things over, and to-morrow come and see me,\r\nbright and happy. That will be enchanting! Well, good-bye, my angel.\r\nLet me kiss you."\r\n\r\nMarya Konstantinovna kissed Nadyezhda Fyodorovna on the forehead,\r\nmade the sign of the cross over her, and softly withdrew. It was\r\ngetting dark, and Olga lighted up in the kitchen. Still crying,\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna went into the bedroom and lay down on the bed.\r\nShe began to be very feverish. She undressed without getting up,\r\ncrumpled up her clothes at her feet, and curled herself up under\r\nthe bedclothes. She was thirsty, and there was no one to give her\r\nsomething to drink.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll pay it back!" she said to herself, and it seemed to her in\r\ndelirium that she was sitting beside some sick woman, and recognised\r\nher as herself. "I\'ll pay it back. It would be stupid to imagine\r\nthat it was for money I . . . I will go away and send him the money\r\nfrom Petersburg. At first a hundred . . . then another hundred . . .\r\nand then the third hundred. . . ."\r\n\r\nIt was late at night when Laevsky came in.\r\n\r\n"At first a hundred . . ." Nadyezhda Fyodorovna said to him, "then\r\nanother hundred . . ."\r\n\r\n"You ought to take some quinine," he said, and thought, "To-morrow\r\nis Wednesday; the steamer goes and I am not going in it. So I shall\r\nhave to go on living here till Saturday."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna knelt up in bed.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say anything just now, did I?" she asked, smiling and\r\nscrewing up her eyes at the light.\r\n\r\n"No, nothing. We shall have to send for the doctor to-morrow morning.\r\nGo to sleep."\r\n\r\nHe took his pillow and went to the door. Ever since he had finally\r\nmade up his mind to go away and leave Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, she had\r\nbegun to raise in him pity and a sense of guilt; he felt a little\r\nashamed in her presence, as though in the presence of a sick or old\r\nhorse whom one has decided to kill. He stopped in the doorway and\r\nlooked round at her.\r\n\r\n"I was out of humour at the picnic and said something rude to you.\r\nForgive me, for God\'s sake!"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he went off to his study, lay down, and for a long\r\nwhile could not get to sleep.\r\n\r\nNext morning when Samoylenko, attired, as it was a holiday, in\r\nfull-dress uniform with epaulettes on his shoulders and decorations\r\non his breast, came out of the bedroom after feeling Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna\'s pulse and looking at her tongue, Laevsky, who was\r\nstanding in the doorway, asked him anxiously: "Well? Well?"\r\n\r\nThere was an expression of terror, of extreme uneasiness, and of\r\nhope on his face.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry yourself; there\'s nothing dangerous," said Samoylenko;\r\n"it\'s the usual fever."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean that." Laevsky frowned impatiently. "Have you got the\r\nmoney?"\r\n\r\n"My dear soul, forgive me," he whispered, looking round at the door\r\nand overcome with confusion.\r\n\r\n"For God\'s sake, forgive me! No one has anything to spare, and I\'ve\r\nonly been able to collect by five- and by ten-rouble notes. . . .\r\nOnly a hundred and ten in all. To-day I\'ll speak to some one else.\r\nHave patience."\r\n\r\n"But Saturday is the latest date," whispered Laevsky, trembling\r\nwith impatience. "By all that\'s sacred, get it by Saturday! If I\r\ndon\'t get away by Saturday, nothing\'s any use, nothing! I can\'t\r\nunderstand how a doctor can be without money!"\r\n\r\n"Lord have mercy on us!" Samoylenko whispered rapidly and intensely,\r\nand there was positively a breaking note in his throat. "I\'ve been\r\nstripped of everything; I am owed seven thousand, and I\'m in debt\r\nall round. Is it my fault?"\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll get it by Saturday? Yes?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try."\r\n\r\n"I implore you, my dear fellow! So that the money may be in my hands\r\nby Friday morning!"\r\n\r\nSamoylenko sat down and prescribed solution of quinine and kalii\r\nbromati and tincture of rhubarb, tincturae gentianae, aquae foeniculi\r\n--all in one mixture, added some pink syrup to sweeten it, and\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n"You look as though you were coming to arrest me," said Von Koren,\r\nseeing Samoylenko coming in, in his full-dress uniform.\r\n\r\n"I was passing by and thought: \'Suppose I go in and pay my respects\r\nto zoology,\'" said Samoylenko, sitting down at the big table,\r\nknocked together by the zoologist himself out of plain boards.\r\n"Good-morning, holy father," he said to the deacon, who was sitting\r\nin the window, copying something. "I\'ll stay a minute and then run\r\nhome to see about dinner. It\'s time. . . . I\'m not hindering you?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least," answered the zoologist, laying out over the\r\ntable slips of paper covered with small writing. "We are busy\r\ncopying."\r\n\r\n"Ah! . . . Oh, my goodness, my goodness! . . ." sighed Samoylenko.\r\nHe cautiously took up from the table a dusty book on which there\r\nwas lying a dead dried spider, and said: "Only fancy, though; some\r\nlittle green beetle is going about its business, when suddenly a\r\nmonster like this swoops down upon it. I can fancy its terror."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"Is poison given it to protect it from its enemies?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to protect it and enable it to attack."\r\n\r\n"To be sure, to be sure. . . . And everything in nature, my dear\r\nfellows, is consistent and can be explained," sighed Samoylenko;\r\n"only I tell you what I don\'t understand. You\'re a man of very great\r\nintellect, so explain it to me, please. There are, you know, little\r\nbeasts no bigger than rats, rather handsome to look at, but nasty\r\nand immoral in the extreme, let me tell you. Suppose such a little\r\nbeast is running in the woods. He sees a bird; he catches it and\r\ndevours it. He goes on and sees in the grass a nest of eggs; he\r\ndoes not want to eat them--he is not hungry, but yet he tastes\r\none egg and scatters the others out of the nest with his paw. Then\r\nhe meets a frog and begins to play with it; when he has tormented\r\nthe frog he goes on licking himself and meets a beetle; he crushes\r\nthe beetle with his paw . . . and so he spoils and destroys everything\r\non his way. . . . He creeps into other beasts\' holes, tears up the\r\nanthills, cracks the snail\'s shell. If he meets a rat, he fights\r\nwith it; if he meets a snake or a mouse, he must strangle it; and\r\nso the whole day long. Come, tell me: what is the use of a beast\r\nlike that? Why was he created?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what animal you are talking of," said Von Koren; "most\r\nlikely one of the insectivora. Well, he got hold of the bird because\r\nit was incautious; he broke the nest of eggs because the bird was\r\nnot skilful, had made the nest badly and did not know how to conceal\r\nit. The frog probably had some defect in its colouring or he would\r\nnot have seen it, and so on. Your little beast only destroys the\r\nweak, the unskilful, the careless--in fact, those who have defects\r\nwhich nature does not think fit to hand on to posterity. Only the\r\ncleverer, the stronger, the more careful and developed survive; and\r\nso your little beast, without suspecting it, is serving the great\r\nends of perfecting creation."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, yes. . . . By the way, brother," said Samoylenko carelessly,\r\n"lend me a hundred roubles."\r\n\r\n"Very good. There are some very interesting types among the\r\ninsectivorous mammals. For instance, the mole is said to be useful\r\nbecause he devours noxious insects. There is a story that some\r\nGerman sent William I. a fur coat made of moleskins, and the Emperor\r\nordered him to be reproved for having destroyed so great a number\r\nof useful animals. And yet the mole is not a bit less cruel than\r\nyour little beast, and is very mischievous besides, as he spoils\r\nmeadows terribly."\r\n\r\nVon Koren opened a box and took out a hundred-rouble note.\r\n\r\n"The mole has a powerful thorax, just like the bat," he went on,\r\nshutting the box; "the bones and muscles are tremendously developed,\r\nthe mouth is extraordinarily powerfully furnished. If it had the\r\nproportions of an elephant, it would be an all-destructive, invincible\r\nanimal. It is interesting when two moles meet underground; they\r\nbegin at once as though by agreement digging a little platform;\r\nthey need the platform in order to have a battle more conveniently.\r\nWhen they have made it they enter upon a ferocious struggle and\r\nfight till the weaker one falls. Take the hundred roubles," said\r\nVon Koren, dropping his voice, "but only on condition that you\'re\r\nnot borrowing it for Laevsky."\r\n\r\n"And if it were for Laevsky," cried Samoylenko, flaring up, "what\r\nis that to you?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t give it to you for Laevsky. I know you like lending people\r\nmoney. You would give it to Kerim, the brigand, if he were to ask\r\nyou; but, excuse me, I can\'t assist you in that direction."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is for Laevsky I am asking it," said Samoylenko, standing\r\nup and waving his right arm. "Yes! For Laevsky! And no one, fiend\r\nor devil, has a right to dictate to me how to dispose of my own\r\nmoney. It doesn\'t suit you to lend it me? No?"\r\n\r\nThe deacon began laughing.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t get excited, but be reasonable," said the zoologist. "To\r\nshower benefits on Mr. Laevsky is, to my thinking, as senseless as\r\nto water weeds or to feed locusts."\r\n\r\n"To my thinking, it is our duty to help our neighbours!" cried\r\nSamoylenko.\r\n\r\n"In that case, help that hungry Turk who is lying under the fence!\r\nHe is a workman and more useful and indispensable than your Laevsky.\r\nGive him that hundred-rouble note! Or subscribe a hundred roubles\r\nto my expedition!"\r\n\r\n"Will you give me the money or not? I ask you!"\r\n\r\n"Tell me openly: what does he want money for?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a secret; he wants to go to Petersburg on Saturday."\r\n\r\n"So that is it!" Von Koren drawled out. "Aha! . . . We understand.\r\nAnd is she going with him, or how is it to be?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s staying here for the time. He\'ll arrange his affairs in\r\nPetersburg and send her the money, and then she\'ll go."\r\n\r\n"That\'s smart!" said the zoologist, and he gave a short tenor laugh.\r\n"Smart, well planned."\r\n\r\nHe went rapidly up to Samoylenko, and standing face to face with\r\nhim, and looking him in the eyes, asked: "Tell me now honestly: is\r\nhe tired of her? Yes? tell me: is he tired of her? Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Samoylenko articulated, beginning to perspire.\r\n\r\n"How repulsive it is!" said Von Koren, and from his face it could\r\nbe seen that he felt repulsion. "One of two things, Alexandr\r\nDaviditch: either you are in the plot with him, or, excuse my saying\r\nso, you are a simpleton. Surely you must see that he is taking you\r\nin like a child in the most shameless way? Why, it\'s as clear as\r\nday that he wants to get rid of her and abandon her here. She\'ll\r\nbe left a burden on you. It is as clear as day that you will have\r\nto send her to Petersburg at your expense. Surely your fine friend\r\ncan\'t have so blinded you by his dazzling qualities that you can\'t\r\nsee the simplest thing?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all supposition," said Samoylenko, sitting down.\r\n\r\n"Supposition? But why is he going alone instead of taking her with\r\nhim? And ask him why he doesn\'t send her off first. The sly beast!"\r\n\r\nOvercome with sudden doubts and suspicions about his friend,\r\nSamoylenko weakened and took a humbler tone.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s impossible," he said, recalling the night Laevsky had\r\nspent at his house. "He is so unhappy!"\r\n\r\n"What of that? Thieves and incendiaries are unhappy too!"\r\n\r\n"Even supposing you are right . . ." said Samoylenko, hesitating.\r\n"Let us admit it. . . . Still, he\'s a young man in a strange place\r\n. . . a student. We have been students, too, and there is no one\r\nbut us to come to his assistance."\r\n\r\n"To help him to do abominable things, because he and you at different\r\ntimes have been at universities, and neither of you did anything\r\nthere! What nonsense!"\r\n\r\n"Stop; let us talk it over coolly. I imagine it will be possible\r\nto make some arrangement. . . ." Samoylenko reflected, twiddling\r\nhis fingers. "I\'ll give him the money, you see, but make him promise\r\non his honour that within a week he\'ll send Nadyezhda Fyodorovna\r\nthe money for the journey."\r\n\r\n"And he\'ll give you his word of honour--in fact, he\'ll shed tears\r\nand believe in it himself; but what\'s his word of honour worth? He\r\nwon\'t keep it, and when in a year or two you meet him on the Nevsky\r\nProspect with a new mistress on his arm, he\'ll excuse himself on\r\nthe ground that he has been crippled by civilisation, and that he\r\nis made after the pattern of Rudin. Drop him, for God\'s sake! Keep\r\naway from the filth; don\'t stir it up with both hands!"\r\n\r\nSamoylenko thought for a minute and said resolutely:\r\n\r\n"But I shall give him the money all the same. As you please. I can\'t\r\nbring myself to refuse a man simply on an assumption."\r\n\r\n"Very fine, too. You can kiss him if you like."\r\n\r\n"Give me the hundred roubles, then," Samoylenko asked timidly.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t."\r\n\r\nA silence followed. Samoylenko was quite crushed; his face wore a\r\nguilty, abashed, and ingratiating expression, and it was strange\r\nto see this pitiful, childish, shamefaced countenance on a huge man\r\nwearing epaulettes and orders of merit.\r\n\r\n"The bishop here goes the round of his diocese on horseback instead\r\nof in a carriage," said the deacon, laying down his pen. "It\'s\r\nextremely touching to see him sit on his horse. His simplicity and\r\nhumility are full of Biblical grandeur."\r\n\r\n"Is he a good man?" asked Von Koren, who was glad to change the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"Of course! If he hadn\'t been a good man, do you suppose he would\r\nhave been consecrated a bishop?"\r\n\r\n"Among the bishops are to be found good and gifted men," said Von\r\nKoren. "The only drawback is that some of them have the weakness\r\nto imagine themselves statesmen. One busies himself with Russification,\r\nanother criticises the sciences. That\'s not their business. They\r\nhad much better look into their consistory a little."\r\n\r\n"A layman cannot judge of bishops."\r\n\r\n"Why so, deacon? A bishop is a man just the same as you or I."\r\n\r\n"The same, but not the same." The deacon was offended and took up\r\nhis pen. "If you had been the same, the Divine Grace would have\r\nrested upon you, and you would have been bishop yourself; and since\r\nyou are not bishop, it follows you are not the same."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk nonsense, deacon," said Samoylenko dejectedly. "Listen\r\nto what I suggest," he said, turning to Von Koren. "Don\'t give me\r\nthat hundred roubles. You\'ll be having your dinners with me for\r\nthree months before the winter, so let me have the money beforehand\r\nfor three months."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t."\r\n\r\nSamoylenko blinked and turned crimson; he mechanically drew towards\r\nhim the book with the spider on it and looked at it, then he got\r\nup and took his hat.\r\n\r\nVon Koren felt sorry for him.\r\n\r\n"What it is to have to live and do with people like this," said the\r\nzoologist, and he kicked a paper into the corner with indignation.\r\n"You must understand that this is not kindness, it is not love, but\r\ncowardice, slackness, poison! What\'s gained by reason is lost by\r\nyour flabby good-for-nothing hearts! When I was ill with typhoid\r\nas a schoolboy, my aunt in her sympathy gave me pickled mushrooms\r\nto eat, and I very nearly died. You, and my aunt too, must understand\r\nthat love for man is not to be found in the heart or the stomach\r\nor the bowels, but here!"\r\n\r\nVon Koren slapped himself on the forehead.\r\n\r\n"Take it," he said, and thrust a hundred-rouble note into his hand.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no need to be angry, Kolya," said Samoylenko mildly, folding\r\nup the note. "I quite understand you, but . . . you must put yourself\r\nin my place."\r\n\r\n"You are an old woman, that\'s what you are."\r\n\r\nThe deacon burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n"Hear my last request, Alexandr Daviditch," said Von Koren hotly.\r\n"When you give that scoundrel the money, make it a condition that\r\nhe takes his lady with him, or sends her on ahead, and don\'t give\r\nit him without. There\'s no need to stand on ceremony with him. Tell\r\nhim so, or, if you don\'t, I give you my word I\'ll go to his office\r\nand kick him downstairs, and I\'ll break off all acquaintance with\r\nyou. So you\'d better know it."\r\n\r\n"Well! To go with her or send her on beforehand will be more\r\nconvenient for him," said Samoylenko. "He\'ll be delighted indeed.\r\nWell, goodbye."\r\n\r\nHe said good-bye affectionately and went out, but before shutting\r\nthe door after him, he looked round at Von Koren and, with a ferocious\r\nface, said:\r\n\r\n"It\'s the Germans who have ruined you, brother! Yes! The Germans!"\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nNext day, Thursday, Marya Konstantinovna was celebrating the birthday\r\nof her Kostya. All were invited to come at midday and eat pies, and\r\nin the evening to drink chocolate. When Laevsky and Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna arrived in the evening, the zoologist, who was already\r\nsitting in the drawing-room, drinking chocolate, asked Samoylenko:\r\n\r\n"Have you talked to him?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet."\r\n\r\n"Mind now, don\'t stand on ceremony. I can\'t understand the insolence\r\nof these people! Why, they know perfectly well the view taken by\r\nthis family of their cohabitation, and yet they force themselves\r\nin here."\r\n\r\n"If one is to pay attention to every prejudice," said Samoylenko,\r\n"one could go nowhere."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that the repugnance felt by the masses for\r\nillicit love and moral laxity is a prejudice?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it is. It\'s prejudice and hate. When the soldiers see a\r\ngirl of light behaviour, they laugh and whistle; but just ask them\r\nwhat they are themselves."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not for nothing they whistle. The fact that girls strangle\r\ntheir illegitimate children and go to prison for it, and that Anna\r\nKarenin flung herself under the train, and that in the villages\r\nthey smear the gates with tar, and that you and I, without knowing\r\nwhy, are pleased by Katya\'s purity, and that every one of us feels\r\na vague craving for pure love, though he knows there is no such\r\nlove--is all that prejudice? That is the one thing, brother, which\r\nhas survived intact from natural selection, and, if it were not for\r\nthat obscure force regulating the relations of the sexes, the\r\nLaevskys would have it all their own way, and mankind would degenerate\r\nin two years."\r\n\r\nLaevsky came into the drawing-room, greeted every one, and shaking\r\nhands with Von Koren, smiled ingratiatingly. He waited for a\r\nfavourable moment and said to Samoylenko:\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Alexandr Daviditch, I must say two words to you."\r\n\r\nSamoylenko got up, put his arm round Laevsky\'s waist, and both of\r\nthem went into Nikodim Alexandritch\'s study.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow\'s Friday," said Laevsky, biting his nails. "Have you got\r\nwhat you promised?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve only got two hundred. I\'ll get the rest to-day or to-morrow.\r\nDon\'t worry yourself."\r\n\r\n"Thank God . . ." sighed Laevsky, and his hands began trembling\r\nwith joy. "You are saving me, Alexandr Daviditch, and I swear to\r\nyou by God, by my happiness and anything you like, I\'ll send you\r\nthe money as soon as I arrive. And I\'ll send you my old debt too."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Vanya . . ." said Samoylenko, turning crimson and taking\r\nhim by the button. "You must forgive my meddling in your private\r\naffairs, but . . . why shouldn\'t you take Nadyezhda Fyodorovna with\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"You queer fellow. How is that possible? One of us must stay, or\r\nour creditors will raise an outcry. You see, I owe seven hundred\r\nor more to the shops. Only wait, and I will send them the money.\r\nI\'ll stop their mouths, and then she can come away."\r\n\r\n"I see. . . . But why shouldn\'t you send her on first?"\r\n\r\n"My goodness, as though that were possible!" Laevsky was horrified.\r\n"Why, she\'s a woman; what would she do there alone? What does she\r\nknow about it? That would only be a loss of time and a useless waste\r\nof money."\r\n\r\n"That\'s reasonable . . ." thought Samoylenko, but remembering his\r\nconversation with Von Koren, he looked down and said sullenly: "I\r\ncan\'t agree with you. Either go with her or send her first; otherwise\r\n. . . otherwise I won\'t give you the money. Those are my last\r\nwords. . ."\r\n\r\nHe staggered back, lurched backwards against the door, and went\r\ninto the drawing-room, crimson, and overcome with confusion.\r\n\r\n"Friday . . . Friday," thought Laevsky, going back into the\r\ndrawing-room. "Friday. . . ."\r\n\r\nHe was handed a cup of chocolate; he burnt his lips and tongue with\r\nthe scalding chocolate and thought: "Friday . . . Friday. . . ."\r\n\r\nFor some reason he could not get the word "Friday" out of his head;\r\nhe could think of nothing but Friday, and the only thing that was\r\nclear to him, not in his brain but somewhere in his heart, was that\r\nhe would not get off on Saturday. Before him stood Nikodim Alexandritch,\r\nvery neat, with his hair combed over his temples, saying:\r\n\r\n"Please take something to eat. . . ."\r\n\r\nMarya Konstantinovna showed the visitors Katya\'s school report and\r\nsaid, drawling:\r\n\r\n"It\'s very, very difficult to do well at school nowadays! So much\r\nis expected . . ."\r\n\r\n"Mamma!" groaned Katya, not knowing where to hide her confusion at\r\nthe praises of the company.\r\n\r\nLaevsky, too, looked at the report and praised it. Scripture, Russian\r\nlanguage, conduct, fives and fours, danced before his eyes, and all\r\nthis, mixed with the haunting refrain of "Friday," with the carefully\r\ncombed locks of Nikodim Alexandritch and the red cheeks of Katya,\r\nproduced on him a sensation of such immense overwhelming boredom\r\nthat he almost shrieked with despair and asked himself: "Is it\r\npossible, is it possible I shall not get away?"\r\n\r\nThey put two card tables side by side and sat down to play post.\r\nLaevsky sat down too.\r\n\r\n"Friday . . . Friday . . ." he kept thinking, as he smiled and took\r\na pencil out of his pocket. "Friday. . . ."\r\n\r\nHe wanted to think over his position, and was afraid to think. It\r\nwas terrible to him to realise that the doctor had detected him in\r\nthe deception which he had so long and carefully concealed from\r\nhimself. Every time he thought of his future he would not let his\r\nthoughts have full rein. He would get into the train and set off,\r\nand thereby the problem of his life would be solved, and he did not\r\nlet his thoughts go farther. Like a far-away dim light in the fields,\r\nthe thought sometimes flickered in his mind that in one of the\r\nside-streets of Petersburg, in the remote future, he would have to\r\nhave recourse to a tiny lie in order to get rid of Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna and pay his debts; he would tell a lie only once, and\r\nthen a completely new life would begin. And that was right: at the\r\nprice of a small lie he would win so much truth.\r\n\r\nNow when by his blunt refusal the doctor had crudely hinted at his\r\ndeception, he began to understand that he would need deception not\r\nonly in the remote future, but to-day, and to-morrow, and in a\r\nmonth\'s time, and perhaps up to the very end of his life. In fact,\r\nin order to get away he would have to lie to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna,\r\nto his creditors, and to his superiors in the Service; then, in\r\norder to get money in Petersburg, he would have to lie to his mother,\r\nto tell her that he had already broken with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna;\r\nand his mother would not give him more than five hundred roubles,\r\nso he had already deceived the doctor, as he would not be in a\r\nposition to pay him back the money within a short time. Afterwards,\r\nwhen Nadyezhda Fyodorovna came to Petersburg, he would have to\r\nresort to a regular series of deceptions, little and big, in order\r\nto get free of her; and again there would be tears, boredom, a\r\ndisgusting existence, remorse, and so there would be no new life.\r\nDeception and nothing more. A whole mountain of lies rose before\r\nLaevsky\'s imagination. To leap over it at one bound and not to do\r\nhis lying piecemeal, he would have to bring himself to stern,\r\nuncompromising action; for instance, to getting up without saying\r\na word, putting on his hat, and at once setting off without money\r\nand without explanation. But Laevsky felt that was impossible for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Friday, Friday . . ." he thought. "Friday. . . ."\r\n\r\nThey wrote little notes, folded them in two, and put them in Nikodim\r\nAlexandritch\'s old top-hat. When there were a sufficient heap of\r\nnotes, Kostya, who acted the part of postman, walked round the table\r\nand delivered them. The deacon, Katya, and Kostya, who received\r\namusing notes and tried to write as funnily as they could, were\r\nhighly delighted.\r\n\r\n"We must have a little talk," Nadyezhda Fyodorovna read in a little\r\nnote; she glanced at Marya Konstantinovna, who gave her an almond-oily\r\nsmile and nodded.\r\n\r\n"Talk of what?" thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. "If one can\'t tell\r\nthe whole, it\'s no use talking."\r\n\r\nBefore going out for the evening she had tied Laevsky\'s cravat for\r\nhim, and that simple action filled her soul with tenderness and\r\nsorrow. The anxiety in his face, his absent-minded looks, his pallor,\r\nand the incomprehensible change that had taken place in him of late,\r\nand the fact that she had a terrible revolting secret from him, and\r\nthe fact that her hands trembled when she tied his cravat--all\r\nthis seemed to tell her that they had not long left to be together.\r\nShe looked at him as though he were an ikon, with terror and\r\npenitence, and thought: "Forgive, forgive."\r\n\r\nOpposite her was sitting Atchmianov, and he never took his black,\r\nlove-sick eyes off her. She was stirred by passion; she was ashamed\r\nof herself, and afraid that even her misery and sorrow would not\r\nprevent her from yielding to impure desire to-morrow, if not to-day\r\n--and that, like a drunkard, she would not have the strength to\r\nstop herself.\r\n\r\nShe made up her mind to go away that she might not continue this\r\nlife, shameful for herself, and humiliating for Laevsky. She would\r\nbeseech him with tears to let her go; and if he opposed her, she\r\nwould go away secretly. She would not tell him what had happened;\r\nlet him keep a pure memory of her.\r\n\r\n"I love you, I love you, I love you," she read. It was from Atchmianov.\r\n\r\nShe would live in some far remote place, would work and send Laevsky,\r\n"anonymously," money, embroidered shirts, and tobacco, and would\r\nreturn to him only in old age or if he were dangerously ill and\r\nneeded a nurse. When in his old age he learned what were her reasons\r\nfor leaving him and refusing to be his wife, he would appreciate\r\nher sacrifice and forgive.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got a long nose." That must be from the deacon or Kostya.\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna imagined how, parting from Laevsky, she would\r\nembrace him warmly, would kiss his hand, and would swear to love\r\nhim all her life, all her life, and then, living in obscurity among\r\nstrangers, she would every day think that somewhere she had a friend,\r\nsome one she loved--a pure, noble, lofty man who kept a pure\r\nmemory of her.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t give me an interview to-day, I shall take measures,\r\nI assure you on my word of honour. You can\'t treat decent people\r\nlike this; you must understand that." That was from Kirilin.\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nLaevsky received two notes; he opened one and read: "Don\'t go away,\r\nmy darling."\r\n\r\n"Who could have written that?" he thought. "Not Samoylenko, of\r\ncourse. And not the deacon, for he doesn\'t know I want to go away.\r\nVon Koren, perhaps?"\r\n\r\nThe zoologist bent over the table and drew a pyramid. Laevsky fancied\r\nthat his eyes were smiling.\r\n\r\n"Most likely Samoylenko . . . has been gossiping," thought Laevsky.\r\n\r\nIn the other note, in the same disguised angular handwriting with\r\nlong tails to the letters, was written: "Somebody won\'t go away on\r\nSaturday."\r\n\r\n"A stupid gibe," thought Laevsky. "Friday, Friday. . . ."\r\n\r\nSomething rose in his throat. He touched his collar and coughed,\r\nbut instead of a cough a laugh broke from his throat.\r\n\r\n"Ha-ha-ha!" he laughed. "Ha-ha-ha! What am I laughing at? Ha-ha-ha!"\r\n\r\nHe tried to restrain himself, covered his mouth with his hand, but\r\nthe laugh choked his chest and throat, and his hand could not cover\r\nhis mouth.\r\n\r\n"How stupid it is!" he thought, rolling with laughter. "Have I gone\r\nout of my mind?"\r\n\r\nThe laugh grew shriller and shriller, and became something like the\r\nbark of a lap-dog. Laevsky tried to get up from the table, but his\r\nlegs would not obey him and his right hand was strangely, without\r\nhis volition, dancing on the table, convulsively clutching and\r\ncrumpling up the bits of paper. He saw looks of wonder, Samoylenko\'s\r\ngrave, frightened face, and the eyes of the zoologist full of cold\r\nirony and disgust, and realised that he was in hysterics.\r\n\r\n"How hideous, how shameful!" he thought, feeling the warmth of tears\r\non his face. ". . . Oh, oh, what a disgrace! It has never happened\r\nto me. . . ."\r\n\r\nThey took him under his arms, and supporting his head from behind,\r\nled him away; a glass gleamed before his eyes and knocked against\r\nhis teeth, and the water was spilt on his breast; he was in a little\r\nroom, with two beds in the middle, side by side, covered by two\r\nsnow-white quilts. He dropped on one of the beds and sobbed.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing, it\'s nothing," Samoylenko kept saying; "it does\r\nhappen . . . it does happen. . . ."\r\n\r\nChill with horror, trembling all over and dreading something awful,\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna stood by the bedside and kept asking:\r\n\r\n"What is it? What is it? For God\'s sake, tell me."\r\n\r\n"Can Kirilin have written him something?" she thought.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing," said Laevsky, laughing and crying; "go away, darling."\r\n\r\nHis face expressed neither hatred nor repulsion: so he knew nothing;\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna was somewhat reassured, and she went into the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t agitate yourself, my dear!" said Marya Konstantinovna, sitting\r\ndown beside her and taking her hand. "It will pass. Men are just\r\nas weak as we poor sinners. You are both going through a crisis. . . .\r\nOne can so well understand it! Well, my dear, I am waiting for\r\nan answer. Let us have a little talk."\r\n\r\n"No, we are not going to talk," said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, listening\r\nto Laevsky\'s sobs. "I feel depressed. . . . You must allow me to\r\ngo home."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, what do you mean, my dear?" cried Marya\r\nKonstantinovna in alarm. "Do you think I could let you go without\r\nsupper? We will have something to eat, and then you may go with my\r\nblessing."\r\n\r\n"I feel miserable . . ." whispered Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and she\r\ncaught at the arm of the chair with both hands to avoid falling.\r\n\r\n"He\'s got a touch of hysterics," said Von Koren gaily, coming into\r\nthe drawing-room, but seeing Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, he was taken\r\naback and retreated.\r\n\r\nWhen the attack was over, Laevsky sat on the strange bed and thought.\r\n\r\n"Disgraceful! I\'ve been howling like some wretched girl! I must\r\nhave been absurd and disgusting. I will go away by the back stairs\r\n. . . . But that would seem as though I took my hysterics too seriously.\r\nI ought to take it as a joke. . . ."\r\n\r\nHe looked in the looking-glass, sat there for some time, and went\r\nback into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Here I am," he said, smiling; he felt agonisingly ashamed, and he\r\nfelt others were ashamed in his presence. "Fancy such a thing\r\nhappening," he said, sitting down. "I was sitting here, and all of\r\na sudden, do you know, I felt a terrible piercing pain in my side\r\n. . . unendurable, my nerves could not stand it, and . . . and it\r\nled to this silly performance. This is the age of nerves; there is\r\nno help for it."\r\n\r\nAt supper he drank some wine, and, from time to time, with an abrupt\r\nsigh rubbed his side as though to suggest that he still felt the\r\npain. And no one, except Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, believed him, and\r\nhe saw that.\r\n\r\nAfter nine o\'clock they went for a walk on the boulevard. Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna, afraid that Kirilin would speak to her, did her best\r\nto keep all the time beside Marya Konstantinovna and the children.\r\nShe felt weak with fear and misery, and felt she was going to be\r\nfeverish; she was exhausted and her legs would hardly move, but she\r\ndid not go home, because she felt sure that she would be followed\r\nby Kirilin or Atchmianov or both at once. Kirilin walked behind her\r\nwith Nikodim Alexandritch, and kept humming in an undertone:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t al-low people to play with me! I don\'t al-low it."\r\n\r\nFrom the boulevard they went back to the pavilion and walked along\r\nthe beach, and looked for a long time at the phosphorescence on the\r\nwater. Von Koren began telling them why it looked phosphorescent.\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n"It\'s time I went to my _vint_. . . . They will be waiting for me,"\r\nsaid Laevsky. "Good-bye, my friends."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come with you; wait a minute," said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and\r\nshe took his arm.\r\n\r\nThey said good-bye to the company and went away. Kirilin took leave\r\ntoo, and saying that he was going the same way, went along beside\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"What will be, will be," thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. "So be\r\nit. . . ."\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to her that all the evil memories in her head had\r\ntaken shape and were walking beside her in the darkness, breathing\r\nheavily, while she, like a fly that had fallen into the inkpot, was\r\ncrawling painfully along the pavement and smirching Laevsky\'s side\r\nand arm with blackness.\r\n\r\nIf Kirilin should do anything horrid, she thought, not he but she\r\nwould be to blame for it. There was a time when no man would have\r\ntalked to her as Kirilin had done, and she had torn up her security\r\nlike a thread and destroyed it irrevocably--who was to blame for\r\nit? Intoxicated by her passions she had smiled at a complete stranger,\r\nprobably just because he was tall and a fine figure. After two\r\nmeetings she was weary of him, had thrown him over, and did not\r\nthat, she thought now, give him the right to treat her as he chose?\r\n\r\n"Here I\'ll say good-bye to you, darling," said Laevsky. "Ilya\r\nMihalitch will see you home."\r\n\r\nHe nodded to Kirilin, and, quickly crossing the boulevard, walked\r\nalong the street to Sheshkovsky\'s, where there were lights in the\r\nwindows, and then they heard the gate bang as he went in.\r\n\r\n"Allow me to have an explanation with you," said Kirilin. "I\'m not\r\na boy, not some Atchkasov or Latchkasov, Zatchkasov. . . . I demand\r\nserious attention."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna\'s heart began beating violently. She made no\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n"The abrupt change in your behaviour to me I put down at first to\r\ncoquetry," Kirilin went on; "now I see that you don\'t know how to\r\nbehave with gentlemanly people. You simply wanted to play with me,\r\nas you are playing with that wretched Armenian boy; but I\'m a\r\ngentleman and I insist on being treated like a gentleman. And so I\r\nam at your service. . . ."\r\n\r\n"I\'m miserable," said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna beginning to cry, and\r\nto hide her tears she turned away.\r\n\r\n"I\'m miserable too," said Kirilin, "but what of that?"\r\n\r\nKirilin was silent for a space, then he said distinctly and\r\nemphatically:\r\n\r\n"I repeat, madam, that if you do not give me an interview this\r\nevening, I\'ll make a scandal this very evening."\r\n\r\n"Let me off this evening," said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and she did\r\nnot recognise her own voice, it was so weak and pitiful.\r\n\r\n"I must give you a lesson. . . . Excuse me for the roughness of my\r\ntone, but it\'s necessary to give you a lesson. Yes, I regret to say\r\nI must give you a lesson. I insist on two interviews--to-day and\r\nto-morrow. After to-morrow you are perfectly free and can go wherever\r\nyou like with any one you choose. To-day and to-morrow."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna went up to her gate and stopped.\r\n\r\n"Let me go," she murmured, trembling all over and seeing nothing\r\nbefore her in the darkness but his white tunic. "You\'re right: I\'m\r\na horrible woman. . . . I\'m to blame, but let me go . . . I beg\r\nyou." She touched his cold hand and shuddered. "I beseech you. . . ."\r\n\r\n"Alas!" sighed Kirilin, "alas! it\'s not part of my plan to let you\r\ngo; I only mean to give you a lesson and make you realise. And\r\nwhat\'s more, madam, I\'ve too little faith in women."\r\n\r\n"I\'m miserable. . . ."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna listened to the even splash of the sea, looked\r\nat the sky studded with stars, and longed to make haste and end it\r\nall, and get away from the cursed sensation of life, with its sea,\r\nstars, men, fever.\r\n\r\n"Only not in my home," she said coldly. "Take me somewhere else."\r\n\r\n"Come to Muridov\'s. That\'s better."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Near the old wall."\r\n\r\nShe walked quickly along the street and then turned into the\r\nside-street that led towards the mountains. It was dark. There were\r\npale streaks of light here and there on the pavement, from the\r\nlighted windows, and it seemed to her that, like a fly, she kept\r\nfalling into the ink and crawling out into the light again. At one\r\npoint he stumbled, almost fell down and burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n"He\'s drunk," thought Nadyezhda Fyodorovna. "Never mind. . . . Never\r\nmind. . . . So be it."\r\n\r\nAtchmianov, too, soon took leave of the party and followed Nadyezhda\r\nFyodorovna to ask her to go for a row. He went to her house and\r\nlooked over the fence: the windows were wide open, there were no\r\nlights.\r\n\r\n"Nadyezhda Fyodorovna!" he called.\r\n\r\nA moment passed, he called again.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there?" he heard Olga\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Is Nadyezhda Fyodorovna at home?"\r\n\r\n"No, she has not come in yet."\r\n\r\n"Strange . . . very strange," thought Atchmianov, feeling very\r\nuneasy. "She went home. . . ."\r\n\r\nHe walked along the boulevard, then along the street, and glanced\r\nin at the windows of Sheshkovsky\'s. Laevsky was sitting at the table\r\nwithout his coat on, looking attentively at his cards.\r\n\r\n"Strange, strange," muttered Atchmianov, and remembering Laevsky\'s\r\nhysterics, he felt ashamed. "If she is not at home, where is she?"\r\n\r\nHe went to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna\'s lodgings again, and looked at the\r\ndark windows.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a cheat, a cheat . . ." he thought, remembering that, meeting\r\nhim at midday at Marya Konstantinovna\'s, she had promised to go in\r\na boat with him that evening.\r\n\r\nThe windows of the house where Kirilin lived were dark, and there\r\nwas a policeman sitting asleep on a little bench at the gate.\r\nEverything was clear to Atchmianov when he looked at the windows\r\nand the policeman. He made up his mind to go home, and set off in\r\nthat direction, but somehow found himself near Nadyezhda Fyodorovna\'s\r\nlodgings again. He sat down on the bench near the gate and took off\r\nhis hat, feeling that his head was burning with jealousy and\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\nThe clock in the town church only struck twice in the twenty-four\r\nhours--at midday and midnight. Soon after it struck midnight he\r\nheard hurried footsteps.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow evening, then, again at Muridov\'s," Atchmianov heard,\r\nand he recognised Kirilin\'s voice. "At eight o\'clock; good-bye!"\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna made her appearance near the garden. Without\r\nnoticing that Atchmianov was sitting on the bench, she passed beside\r\nhim like a shadow, opened the gate, and leaving it open, went into\r\nthe house. In her own room she lighted the candle and quickly\r\nundressed, but instead of getting into bed, she sank on her knees\r\nbefore a chair, flung her arms round it, and rested her head on it.\r\n\r\nIt was past two when Laevsky came home.\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nHaving made up his mind to lie, not all at once but piecemeal,\r\nLaevsky went soon after one o\'clock next day to Samoylenko to ask\r\nfor the money that he might be sure to get off on Saturday. After\r\nhis hysterical attack, which had added an acute feeling of shame\r\nto his depressed state of mind, it was unthinkable to remain in the\r\ntown. If Samoylenko should insist on his conditions, he thought it\r\nwould be possible to agree to them and take the money, and next\r\nday, just as he was starting, to say that Nadyezhda Fyodorovna\r\nrefused to go. He would be able to persuade her that evening that\r\nthe whole arrangement would be for her benefit. If Samoylenko, who\r\nwas obviously under the influence of Von Koren, should refuse the\r\nmoney altogether or make fresh conditions, then he, Laevsky, would\r\ngo off that very evening in a cargo vessel, or even in a sailing-boat,\r\nto Novy Athon or Novorossiisk, would send from there an humiliating\r\ntelegram, and would stay there till his mother sent him the money\r\nfor the journey.\r\n\r\nWhen he went into Samoylenko\'s, he found Von Koren in the drawing-room.\r\nThe zoologist had just arrived for dinner, and, as usual, was turning\r\nover the album and scrutinising the gentlemen in top-hats and the\r\nladies in caps.\r\n\r\n"How very unlucky!" thought Laevsky, seeing him. "He may be in the\r\nway. Good-morning."\r\n\r\n"Good-morning," answered Von Koren, without looking at him.\r\n\r\n"Is Alexandr Daviditch at home?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in the kitchen."\r\n\r\nLaevsky went into the kitchen, but seeing from the door that\r\nSamoylenko was busy over the salad, he went back into the drawing-room\r\nand sat down. He always had a feeling of awkwardness in the zoologist\'s\r\npresence, and now he was afraid there would be talk about his attack\r\nof hysterics. There was more than a minute of silence. Von Koren\r\nsuddenly raised his eyes to Laevsky and asked:\r\n\r\n"How do you feel after yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Very well indeed," said Laevsky, flushing. "It really was nothing\r\nmuch. . . ."\r\n\r\n"Until yesterday I thought it was only ladies who had hysterics,\r\nand so at first I thought you had St. Vitus\'s dance."\r\n\r\nLaevsky smiled ingratiatingly, and thought:\r\n\r\n"How indelicate on his part! He knows quite well how unpleasant it\r\nis for me. . . ."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was a ridiculous performance," he said, still smiling.\r\n"I\'ve been laughing over it the whole morning. What\'s so curious\r\nin an attack of hysterics is that you know it is absurd, and are\r\nlaughing at it in your heart, and at the same time you sob. In our\r\nneurotic age we are the slaves of our nerves; they are our masters\r\nand do as they like with us. Civilisation has done us a bad turn\r\nin that way. . . ."\r\n\r\nAs Laevsky talked, he felt it disagreeable that Von Koren listened\r\nto him gravely, and looked at him steadily and attentively as though\r\nstudying him; and he was vexed with himself that in spite of his\r\ndislike of Von Koren, he could not banish the ingratiating smile\r\nfrom his face.\r\n\r\n"I must admit, though," he added, "that there were immediate causes\r\nfor the attack, and quite sufficient ones too. My health has been\r\nterribly shaky of late. To which one must add boredom, constantly\r\nbeing hard up . . . the absence of people and general interests\r\n. . . . My position is worse than a governor\'s."\r\n\r\n"Yes, your position is a hopeless one," answered Von Koren.\r\n\r\nThese calm, cold words, implying something between a jeer and an\r\nuninvited prediction, offended Laevsky. He recalled the zoologist\'s\r\neyes the evening before, full of mockery and disgust. He was silent\r\nfor a space and then asked, no longer smiling:\r\n\r\n"How do you know anything of my position?"\r\n\r\n"You were only just speaking of it yourself. Besides, your friends\r\ntake such a warm interest in you, that I am hearing about you all\r\nday long."\r\n\r\n"What friends? Samoylenko, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he too."\r\n\r\n"I would ask Alexandr Daviditch and my friends in general not to\r\ntrouble so much about me."\r\n\r\n"Here is Samoylenko; you had better ask him not to trouble so much\r\nabout you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand your tone," Laevsky muttered, suddenly feeling\r\nas though he had only just realised that the zoologist hated and\r\ndespised him, and was jeering at him, and was his bitterest and\r\nmost inveterate enemy.\r\n\r\n"Keep that tone for some one else," he said softly, unable to speak\r\naloud for the hatred with which his chest and throat were choking,\r\nas they had been the night before with laughter.\r\n\r\nSamoylenko came in in his shirt-sleeves, crimson and perspiring\r\nfrom the stifling kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you here?" he said. "Good-morning, my dear boy. Have you had\r\ndinner? Don\'t stand on ceremony. Have you had dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Alexandr Daviditch," said Laevsky, standing up, "though I did\r\nappeal to you to help me in a private matter, it did not follow\r\nthat I released you from the obligation of discretion and respect\r\nfor other people\'s private affairs."\r\n\r\n"What\'s this?" asked Samoylenko, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"If you have no money," Laevsky went on, raising his voice and\r\nshifting from one foot to the other in his excitement, "don\'t give\r\nit; refuse it. But why spread abroad in every back street that my\r\nposition is hopeless, and all the rest of it? I can\'t endure such\r\nbenevolence and friend\'s assistance where there\'s a shilling-worth\r\nof talk for a ha\'p\'orth of help! You can boast of your benevolence\r\nas much as you please, but no one has given you the right to gossip\r\nabout my private affairs!"\r\n\r\n"What private affairs?" asked Samoylenko, puzzled and beginning to\r\nbe angry. "If you\'ve come here to be abusive, you had better clear\r\nout. You can come again afterwards!"\r\n\r\nHe remembered the rule that when one is angry with one\'s neighbour,\r\none must begin to count a hundred, and one will grow calm again;\r\nand he began rapidly counting.\r\n\r\n"I beg you not to trouble yourself about me," Laevsky went on.\r\n"Don\'t pay any attention to me, and whose business is it what I do\r\nand how I live? Yes, I want to go away. Yes, I get into debt, I\r\ndrink, I am living with another man\'s wife, I\'m hysterical, I\'m\r\nordinary. I am not so profound as some people, but whose business\r\nis that? Respect other people\'s privacy."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, brother," said Samoylenko, who had counted up to\r\nthirty-five, "but . . ."\r\n\r\n"Respect other people\'s individuality!" interrupted Laevsky. "This\r\ncontinual gossip about other people\'s affairs, this sighing and\r\ngroaning and everlasting prying, this eavesdropping, this friendly\r\nsympathy . . . damn it all! They lend me money and make conditions\r\nas though I were a schoolboy! I am treated as the devil knows what!\r\nI don\'t want anything," shouted Laevsky, staggering with excitement\r\nand afraid that it might end in another attack of hysterics. "I\r\nshan\'t get away on Saturday, then," flashed through his mind. "I\r\nwant nothing. All I ask of you is to spare me your protecting care.\r\nI\'m not a boy, and I\'m not mad, and I beg you to leave off looking\r\nafter me."\r\n\r\nThe deacon came in, and seeing Laevsky pale and gesticulating,\r\naddressing his strange speech to the portrait of Prince Vorontsov,\r\nstood still by the door as though petrified.\r\n\r\n"This continual prying into my soul," Laevsky went on, "is insulting\r\nto my human dignity, and I beg these volunteer detectives to give\r\nup their spying! Enough!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that . . . what did you say?" said Samoylenko, who had\r\ncounted up to a hundred. He turned crimson and went up to Laevsky.\r\n\r\n"It\'s enough," said Laevsky, breathing hard and snatching up his\r\ncap.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a Russian doctor, a nobleman by birth, and a civil councillor,"\r\nsaid Samoylenko emphatically. "I\'ve never been a spy, and I allow\r\nno one to insult me!" he shouted in a breaking voice, emphasising\r\nthe last word. "Hold your tongue!"\r\n\r\nThe deacon, who had never seen the doctor so majestic, so swelling\r\nwith dignity, so crimson and so ferocious, shut his mouth, ran out\r\ninto the entry and there exploded with laughter.\r\n\r\nAs though through a fog, Laevsky saw Von Koren get up and, putting\r\nhis hands in his trouser-pockets, stand still in an attitude of\r\nexpectancy, as though waiting to see what would happen. This calm\r\nattitude struck Laevsky as insolent and insulting to the last degree.\r\n\r\n"Kindly take back your words," shouted Samoylenko.\r\n\r\nLaevsky, who did not by now remember what his words were, answered:\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone! I ask for nothing. All I ask is that you and German\r\nupstarts of Jewish origin should let me alone! Or I shall take steps\r\nto make you! I will fight you!"\r\n\r\n"Now we understand," said Von Koren, coming from behind the table.\r\n"Mr. Laevsky wants to amuse himself with a duel before he goes away.\r\nI can give him that pleasure. Mr. Laevsky, I accept your challenge."\r\n\r\n"A challenge," said Laevsky, in a low voice, going up to the zoologist\r\nand looking with hatred at his swarthy brow and curly hair. "A\r\nchallenge? By all means! I hate you! I hate you!"\r\n\r\n"Delighted. To-morrow morning early near Kerbalay\'s. I leave all\r\ndetails to your taste. And now, clear out!"\r\n\r\n"I hate you," Laevsky said softly, breathing hard. "I have hated\r\nyou a long while! A duel! Yes!"\r\n\r\n"Get rid of him, Alexandr Daviditch, or else I\'m going," said Von\r\nKoren. "He\'ll bite me."\r\n\r\nVon Koren\'s cool tone calmed the doctor; he seemed suddenly to come\r\nto himself, to recover his reason; he put both arms round Laevsky\'s\r\nwaist, and, leading him away from the zoologist, muttered in a\r\nfriendly voice that shook with emotion:\r\n\r\n"My friends . . . dear, good . . . you\'ve lost your tempers and\r\nthat\'s enough . . . and that\'s enough, my friends."\r\n\r\nHearing his soft, friendly voice, Laevsky felt that something unheard\r\nof, monstrous, had just happened to him, as though he had been\r\nnearly run over by a train; he almost burst into tears, waved his\r\nhand, and ran out of the room.\r\n\r\n"To feel that one is hated, to expose oneself before the man who\r\nhates one, in the most pitiful, contemptible, helpless state. My\r\nGod, how hard it is!" he thought a little while afterwards as he\r\nsat in the pavilion, feeling as though his body were scarred by the\r\nhatred of which he had just been the object.\r\n\r\n"How coarse it is, my God!"\r\n\r\nCold water with brandy in it revived him. He vividly pictured Von\r\nKoren\'s calm, haughty face; his eyes the day before, his shirt like\r\na rug, his voice, his white hand; and heavy, passionate, hungry\r\nhatred rankled in his breast and clamoured for satisfaction. In his\r\nthoughts he felled Von Koren to the ground, and trampled him\r\nunderfoot. He remembered to the minutest detail all that had happened,\r\nand wondered how he could have smiled ingratiatingly to that\r\ninsignificant man, and how he could care for the opinion of wretched\r\npetty people whom nobody knew, living in a miserable little town\r\nwhich was not, it seemed, even on the map, and of which not one\r\ndecent person in Petersburg had heard. If this wretched little town\r\nsuddenly fell into ruins or caught fire, the telegram with the news\r\nwould be read in Russia with no more interest than an advertisement\r\nof the sale of second-hand furniture. Whether he killed Von Koren\r\nnext day or left him alive, it would be just the same, equally\r\nuseless and uninteresting. Better to shoot him in the leg or hand,\r\nwound him, then laugh at him, and let him, like an insect with a\r\nbroken leg lost in the grass--let him be lost with his obscure\r\nsufferings in the crowd of insignificant people like himself.\r\n\r\nLaevsky went to Sheshkovsky, told him all about it, and asked him\r\nto be his second; then they both went to the superintendent of the\r\npostal telegraph department, and asked him, too, to be a second,\r\nand stayed to dinner with him. At dinner there was a great deal of\r\njoking and laughing. Laevsky made jests at his own expense, saying\r\nhe hardly knew how to fire off a pistol, calling himself a royal\r\narcher and William Tell.\r\n\r\n"We must give this gentleman a lesson . . ." he said.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they sat down to cards. Laevsky played, drank wine,\r\nand thought that duelling was stupid and senseless, as it did not\r\ndecide the question but only complicated it, but that it was sometimes\r\nimpossible to get on without it. In the given case, for instance,\r\none could not, of course, bring an action against Von Koren. And\r\nthis duel was so far good in that it made it impossible for Laevsky\r\nto remain in the town afterwards. He got a little drunk and interested\r\nin the game, and felt at ease.\r\n\r\nBut when the sun had set and it grew dark, he was possessed by a\r\nfeeling of uneasiness. It was not fear at the thought of death,\r\nbecause while he was dining and playing cards, he had for some\r\nreason a confident belief that the duel would end in nothing; it\r\nwas dread at the thought of something unknown which was to happen\r\nnext morning for the first time in his life, and dread of the coming\r\nnight. . . . He knew that the night would be long and sleepless,\r\nand that he would have to think not only of Von Koren and his hatred,\r\nbut also of the mountain of lies which he had to get through, and\r\nwhich he had not strength or ability to dispense with. It was as\r\nthough he had been taken suddenly ill; all at once he lost all\r\ninterest in the cards and in people, grew restless, and began asking\r\nthem to let him go home. He was eager to get into bed, to lie without\r\nmoving, and to prepare his thoughts for the night. Sheshkovsky and\r\nthe postal superintendent saw him home and went on to Von Koren\'s\r\nto arrange about the duel.\r\n\r\nNear his lodgings Laevsky met Atchmianov. The young man was breathless\r\nand excited.\r\n\r\n"I am looking for you, Ivan Andreitch," he said. "I beg you to come\r\nquickly. . . ."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"Some one wants to see you, some one you don\'t know, about very\r\nimportant business; he earnestly begs you to come for a minute. He\r\nwants to speak to you of something. . . . For him it\'s a question\r\nof life and death. . . ." In his excitement Atchmianov spoke in a\r\nstrong Armenian accent.\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" asked Laevsky.\r\n\r\n"He asked me not to tell you his name."\r\n\r\n"Tell him I\'m busy; to-morrow, if he likes. . . ."\r\n\r\n"How can you!" Atchmianov was aghast. "He wants to tell you something\r\nvery important for you . . . very important! If you don\'t come,\r\nsomething dreadful will happen."\r\n\r\n"Strange . . ." muttered Laevsky, unable to understand why Atchmianov\r\nwas so excited and what mysteries there could be in this dull,\r\nuseless little town.\r\n\r\n"Strange," he repeated in hesitation. "Come along, though; I don\'t\r\ncare."\r\n\r\nAtchmianov walked rapidly on ahead and Laevsky followed him. They\r\nwalked down a street, then turned into an alley.\r\n\r\n"What a bore this is!" said Laevsky.\r\n\r\n"One minute, one minute . . . it\'s near."\r\n\r\nNear the old rampart they went down a narrow alley between two empty\r\nenclosures, then they came into a sort of large yard and went towards\r\na small house.\r\n\r\n"That\'s Muridov\'s, isn\'t it?" asked Laevsky.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"But why we\'ve come by the back yards I don\'t understand. We might\r\nhave come by the street; it\'s nearer. . . ."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, never mind. . . ."\r\n\r\nIt struck Laevsky as strange, too, that Atchmianov led him to a\r\nback entrance, and motioned to him as though bidding him go quietly\r\nand hold his tongue.\r\n\r\n"This way, this way . . ." said Atchmianov, cautiously opening the\r\ndoor and going into the passage on tiptoe. "Quietly, quietly, I beg\r\nyou . . . they may hear."\r\n\r\nHe listened, drew a deep breath and said in a whisper:\r\n\r\n"Open that door, and go in . . . don\'t be afraid."\r\n\r\nLaevsky, puzzled, opened the door and went into a room with a low\r\nceiling and curtained windows.\r\n\r\nThere was a candle on the table.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" asked some one in the next room. "Is it you,\r\nMuridov?"\r\n\r\nLaevsky turned into that room and saw Kirilin, and beside him\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna.\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t hear what was said to him; he staggered back, and did not\r\nknow how he found himself in the street. His hatred for Von Koren\r\nand his uneasiness--all had vanished from his soul. As he went\r\nhome he waved his right arm awkwardly and looked carefully at the\r\nground under his feet, trying to step where it was smooth. At home\r\nin his study he walked backwards and forwards, rubbing his hands,\r\nand awkwardly shrugging his shoulders and neck, as though his jacket\r\nand shirt were too tight; then he lighted a candle and sat down to\r\nthe table. . . .\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n"The \'humane studies\' of which you speak will only satisfy human\r\nthought when, as they advance, they meet the exact sciences and\r\nprogress side by side with them. Whether they will meet under a new\r\nmicroscope, or in the monologues of a new Hamlet, or in a new\r\nreligion, I do not know, but I expect the earth will be covered\r\nwith a crust of ice before it comes to pass. Of all humane learning\r\nthe most durable and living is, of course, the teaching of Christ;\r\nbut look how differently even that is interpreted! Some teach that\r\nwe must love all our neighbours but make an exception of soldiers,\r\ncriminals, and lunatics. They allow the first to be killed in war,\r\nthe second to be isolated or executed, and the third they forbid\r\nto marry. Other interpreters teach that we must love all our\r\nneighbours without exception, with no distinction of _plus_ or\r\n_minus_. According to their teaching, if a consumptive or a murderer\r\nor an epileptic asks your daughter in marriage, you must let him\r\nhave her. If _cretins_ go to war against the physically and mentally\r\nhealthy, don\'t defend yourselves. This advocacy of love for love\'s\r\nsake, like art for art\'s sake, if it could have power, would bring\r\nmankind in the long run to complete extinction, and so would become\r\nthe vastest crime that has ever been committed upon earth. There\r\nare very many interpretations, and since there are many of them,\r\nserious thought is not satisfied by any one of them, and hastens\r\nto add its own individual interpretation to the mass. For that\r\nreason you should never put a question on a philosophical or so-called\r\nChristian basis; by so doing you only remove the question further\r\nfrom solution."\r\n\r\nThe deacon listened to the zoologist attentively, thought a little,\r\nand asked:\r\n\r\n"Have the philosophers invented the moral law which is innate in\r\nevery man, or did God create it together with the body?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. But that law is so universal among all peoples and\r\nall ages that I fancy we ought to recognise it as organically\r\nconnected with man. It is not invented, but exists and will exist.\r\nI don\'t tell you that one day it will be seen under the microscope,\r\nbut its organic connection is shown, indeed, by evidence: serious\r\naffections of the brain and all so-called mental diseases, to the\r\nbest of my belief, show themselves first of all in the perversion\r\nof the moral law."\r\n\r\n"Good. So then, just as our stomach bids us eat, our moral sense\r\nbids us love our neighbours. Is that it? But our natural man through\r\nself-love opposes the voice of conscience and reason, and this gives\r\nrise to many brain-racking questions. To whom ought we to turn for\r\nthe solution of those questions if you forbid us to put them on the\r\nphilosophic basis?"\r\n\r\n"Turn to what little exact science we have. Trust to evidence and\r\nthe logic of facts. It is true it is but little, but, on the other\r\nhand, it is less fluid and shifting than philosophy. The moral law,\r\nlet us suppose, demands that you love your neighbour. Well? Love\r\nought to show itself in the removal of everything which in one way\r\nor another is injurious to men and threatens them with danger in\r\nthe present or in the future. Our knowledge and the evidence tells\r\nus that the morally and physically abnormal are a menace to humanity.\r\nIf so you must struggle against the abnormal; if you are not able\r\nto raise them to the normal standard you must have strength and\r\nability to render them harmless--that is, to destroy them."\r\n\r\n"So love consists in the strong overcoming the weak."\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly."\r\n\r\n"But you know the strong crucified our Lord Jesus Christ," said the\r\ndeacon hotly.\r\n\r\n"The fact is that those who crucified Him were not the strong but\r\nthe weak. Human culture weakens and strives to nullify the struggle\r\nfor existence and natural selection; hence the rapid advancement\r\nof the weak and their predominance over the strong. Imagine that\r\nyou succeeded in instilling into bees humanitarian ideas in their\r\ncrude and elementary form. What would come of it? The drones who\r\nought to be killed would remain alive, would devour the honey, would\r\ncorrupt and stifle the bees, resulting in the predominance of the\r\nweak over the strong and the degeneration of the latter. The same\r\nprocess is taking place now with humanity; the weak are oppressing\r\nthe strong. Among savages untouched by civilisation the strongest,\r\ncleverest, and most moral takes the lead; he is the chief and the\r\nmaster. But we civilised men have crucified Christ, and we go on\r\ncrucifying Him, so there is something lacking in us. . . . And that\r\nsomething one ought to raise up in ourselves, or there will be no\r\nend to these errors."\r\n\r\n"But what criterion have you to distinguish the strong from the\r\nweak?"\r\n\r\n"Knowledge and evidence. The tuberculous and the scrofulous are\r\nrecognised by their diseases, and the insane and the immoral by\r\ntheir actions."\r\n\r\n"But mistakes may be made!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but it\'s no use to be afraid of getting your feet wet when\r\nyou are threatened with the deluge!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s philosophy," laughed the deacon.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it. You are so corrupted by your seminary philosophy\r\nthat you want to see nothing but fog in everything. The abstract\r\nstudies with which your youthful head is stuffed are called abstract\r\njust because they abstract your minds from what is obvious. Look\r\nthe devil straight in the eye, and if he\'s the devil, tell him he\'s\r\nthe devil, and don\'t go calling to Kant or Hegel for explanations."\r\n\r\nThe zoologist paused and went on:\r\n\r\n"Twice two\'s four, and a stone\'s a stone. Here to-morrow we have a\r\nduel. You and I will say it\'s stupid and absurd, that the duel is\r\nout of date, that there is no real difference between the aristocratic\r\nduel and the drunken brawl in the pot-house, and yet we shall not\r\nstop, we shall go there and fight. So there is some force stronger\r\nthan our reasoning. We shout that war is plunder, robbery, atrocity,\r\nfratricide; we cannot look upon blood without fainting; but the\r\nFrench or the Germans have only to insult us for us to feel at once\r\nan exaltation of spirit; in the most genuine way we shout \'Hurrah!\'\r\nand rush to attack the foe. You will invoke the blessing of God on\r\nour weapons, and our valour will arouse universal and general\r\nenthusiasm. Again it follows that there is a force, if not higher,\r\nat any rate stronger, than us and our philosophy. We can no more\r\nstop it than that cloud which is moving upwards over the sea. Don\'t\r\nbe hypocritical, don\'t make a long nose at it on the sly; and don\'t\r\nsay, \'Ah, old-fashioned, stupid! Ah, it\'s inconsistent with Scripture!\'\r\nbut look it straight in the face, recognise its rational lawfulness,\r\nand when, for instance, it wants to destroy a rotten, scrofulous,\r\ncorrupt race, don\'t hinder it with your pilules and misunderstood\r\nquotations from the Gospel. Leskov has a story of a conscientious\r\nDanila who found a leper outside the town, and fed and warmed him\r\nin the name of love and of Christ. If that Danila had really loved\r\nhumanity, he would have dragged the leper as far as possible from\r\nthe town, and would have flung him in a pit, and would have gone\r\nto save the healthy. Christ, I hope, taught us a rational, intelligent,\r\npractical love."\r\n\r\n"What a fellow you are!" laughed the deacon. "You don\'t believe in\r\nChrist. Why do you mention His name so often?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do believe in Him. Only, of course, in my own way, not in\r\nyours. Oh, deacon, deacon!" laughed the zoologist; he put his arm\r\nround the deacon\'s waist, and said gaily: "Well? Are you coming\r\nwith us to the duel to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"My orders don\'t allow it, or else I should come."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by \'orders\'?"\r\n\r\n"I have been consecrated. I am in a state of grace."\r\n\r\n"Oh, deacon, deacon," repeated Von Koren, laughing, "I love talking\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"You say you have faith," said the deacon. "What sort of faith is\r\nit? Why, I have an uncle, a priest, and he believes so that when\r\nin time of drought he goes out into the fields to pray for rain,\r\nhe takes his umbrella and leather overcoat for fear of getting wet\r\nthrough on his way home. That\'s faith! When he speaks of Christ,\r\nhis face is full of radiance, and all the peasants, men and women,\r\nweep floods of tears. He would stop that cloud and put all those\r\nforces you talk about to flight. Yes . . . faith moves mountains."\r\n\r\nThe deacon laughed and slapped the zoologist on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Yes . . ." he went on; "here you are teaching all the time, fathoming\r\nthe depths of the ocean, dividing the weak and the strong, writing\r\nbooks and challenging to duels--and everything remains as it is;\r\nbut, behold! some feeble old man will mutter just one word with a\r\nholy spirit, or a new Mahomet, with a sword, will gallop from Arabia,\r\nand everything will be topsy-turvy, and in Europe not one stone\r\nwill be left standing upon another."\r\n\r\n"Well, deacon, that\'s on the knees of the gods."\r\n\r\n"Faith without works is dead, but works without faith are worse\r\nstill--mere waste of time and nothing more."\r\n\r\nThe doctor came into sight on the sea-front. He saw the deacon and\r\nthe zoologist, and went up to them.\r\n\r\n"I believe everything is ready," he said, breathing hard. "Govorovsky\r\nand Boyko will be the seconds. They will start at five o\'clock in\r\nthe morning. How it has clouded over," he said, looking at the sky.\r\n"One can see nothing; there will be rain directly."\r\n\r\n"I hope you are coming with us?" said the zoologist.\r\n\r\n"No, God preserve me; I\'m worried enough as it is. Ustimovitch is\r\ngoing instead of me. I\'ve spoken to him already."\r\n\r\nFar over the sea was a flash of lightning, followed by a hollow\r\nroll of thunder.\r\n\r\n"How stifling it is before a storm!" said Von Koren. "I bet you\'ve\r\nbeen to Laevsky already and have been weeping on his bosom."\r\n\r\n"Why should I go to him?" answered the doctor in confusion. "What\r\nnext?"\r\n\r\nBefore sunset he had walked several times along the boulevard and\r\nthe street in the hope of meeting Laevsky. He was ashamed of his\r\nhastiness and the sudden outburst of friendliness which had followed\r\nit. He wanted to apologise to Laevsky in a joking tone, to give him\r\na good talking to, to soothe him and to tell him that the duel was\r\na survival of mediaeval barbarism, but that Providence itself had\r\nbrought them to the duel as a means of reconciliation; that the\r\nnext day, both being splendid and highly intelligent people, they\r\nwould, after exchanging shots, appreciate each other\'s noble qualities\r\nand would become friends. But he could not come across Laevsky.\r\n\r\n"What should I go and see him for?" repeated Samoylenko. "I did not\r\ninsult him; he insulted me. Tell me, please, why he attacked me.\r\nWhat harm had I done him? I go into the drawing-room, and, all of\r\na sudden, without the least provocation: \'Spy!\' There\'s a nice\r\nthing! Tell me, how did it begin? What did you say to him?"\r\n\r\n"I told him his position was hopeless. And I was right. It is only\r\nhonest men or scoundrels who can find an escape from any position,\r\nbut one who wants to be at the same time an honest man and a scoundrel\r\n--it is a hopeless position. But it\'s eleven o\'clock, gentlemen,\r\nand we have to be up early to-morrow."\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden gust of wind; it blew up the dust on the sea-front,\r\nwhirled it round in eddies, with a howl that drowned the roar of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n"A squall," said the deacon. "We must go in, our eyes are getting\r\nfull of dust."\r\n\r\nAs they went, Samoylenko sighed and, holding his hat, said:\r\n\r\n"I suppose I shan\'t sleep to-night."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you agitate yourself," laughed the zoologist. "You can set\r\nyour mind at rest; the duel will end in nothing. Laevsky will\r\nmagnanimously fire into the air--he can do nothing else; and I\r\ndaresay I shall not fire at all. To be arrested and lose my time\r\non Laevsky\'s account--the game\'s not worth the candle. By the\r\nway, what is the punishment for duelling?"\r\n\r\n"Arrest, and in the case of the death of your opponent a maximum\r\nof three years\' imprisonment in the fortress."\r\n\r\n"The fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul?"\r\n\r\n"No, in a military fortress, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Though this fine gentleman ought to have a lesson!"\r\n\r\nBehind them on the sea, there was a flash of lightning, which for\r\nan instant lighted up the roofs of the houses and the mountains.\r\nThe friends parted near the boulevard. When the doctor disappeared\r\nin the darkness and his steps had died away, Von Koren shouted to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n"I only hope the weather won\'t interfere with us to-morrow!"\r\n\r\n"Very likely it will! Please God it may!"\r\n\r\n"Good-night!"\r\n\r\n"What about the night? What do you say?"\r\n\r\nIn the roar of the wind and the sea and the crashes of thunder, it\r\nwas difficult to hear.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing," shouted the zoologist, and hurried home.\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n             "Upon my mind, weighed down with woe,\r\n              Crowd thoughts, a heavy multitude:\r\n              In silence memory unfolds\r\n              Her long, long scroll before my eyes.\r\n              Loathing and shuddering I curse\r\n              And bitterly lament in vain,\r\n              And bitter though the tears I weep\r\n              I do not wash those lines away."\r\n\r\n                                      PUSHKIN.\r\n\r\nWhether they killed him next morning, or mocked at him--that is,\r\nleft him his life--he was ruined, anyway. Whether this disgraced\r\nwoman killed herself in her shame and despair, or dragged on her\r\npitiful existence, she was ruined anyway.\r\n\r\nSo thought Laevsky as he sat at the table late in the evening, still\r\nrubbing his hands. The windows suddenly blew open with a bang; a\r\nviolent gust of wind burst into the room, and the papers fluttered\r\nfrom the table. Laevsky closed the windows and bent down to pick\r\nup the papers. He was aware of something new in his body, a sort\r\nof awkwardness he had not felt before, and his movements were strange\r\nto him. He moved timidly, jerking with his elbows and shrugging his\r\nshoulders; and when he sat down to the table again, he again began\r\nrubbing his hands. His body had lost its suppleness.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of death one ought to write to one\'s nearest relation.\r\nLaevsky thought of this. He took a pen and wrote with a tremulous\r\nhand:\r\n\r\n"Mother!"\r\n\r\nHe wanted to write to beg his mother, for the sake of the merciful\r\nGod in whom she believed, that she would give shelter and bring a\r\nlittle warmth and kindness into the life of the unhappy woman who,\r\nby his doing, had been disgraced and was in solitude, poverty, and\r\nweakness, that she would forgive and forget everything, everything,\r\neverything, and by her sacrifice atone to some extent for her son\'s\r\nterrible sin. But he remembered how his mother, a stout, heavily-built\r\nold woman in a lace cap, used to go out into the garden in the\r\nmorning, followed by her companion with the lap-dog; how she used\r\nto shout in a peremptory way to the gardener and the servants, and\r\nhow proud and haughty her face was--he remembered all this and\r\nscratched out the word he had written.\r\n\r\nThere was a vivid flash of lightning at all three windows, and it\r\nwas followed by a prolonged, deafening roll of thunder, beginning\r\nwith a hollow rumble and ending with a crash so violent that all\r\nthe window-panes rattled. Laevsky got up, went to the window, and\r\npressed his forehead against the pane. There was a fierce, magnificent\r\nstorm. On the horizon lightning-flashes were flung in white streams\r\nfrom the storm-clouds into the sea, lighting up the high, dark waves\r\nover the far-away expanse. And to right and to left, and, no doubt,\r\nover the house too, the lightning flashed.\r\n\r\n"The storm!" whispered Laevsky; he had a longing to pray to some\r\none or to something, if only to the lightning or the storm-clouds.\r\n"Dear storm!"\r\n\r\nHe remembered how as a boy he used to run out into the garden without\r\na hat on when there was a storm, and how two fair-haired girls with\r\nblue eyes used to run after him, and how they got wet through with\r\nthe rain; they laughed with delight, but when there was a loud peal\r\nof thunder, the girls used to nestle up to the boy confidingly,\r\nwhile he crossed himself and made haste to repeat: "Holy, holy,\r\nholy. . . ." Oh, where had they vanished to! In what sea were they\r\ndrowned, those dawning days of pure, fair life? He had no fear of\r\nthe storm, no love of nature now; he had no God. All the confiding\r\ngirls he had ever known had by now been ruined by him and those\r\nlike him. All his life he had not planted one tree in his own garden,\r\nnor grown one blade of grass; and living among the living, he had\r\nnot saved one fly; he had done nothing but destroy and ruin, and\r\nlie, lie. . . .\r\n\r\n"What in my past was not vice?" he asked himself, trying to clutch\r\nat some bright memory as a man falling down a precipice clutches\r\nat the bushes.\r\n\r\nSchool? The university? But that was a sham. He had neglected his\r\nwork and forgotten what he had learnt. The service of his country?\r\nThat, too, was a sham, for he did nothing in the Service, took a\r\nsalary for doing nothing, and it was an abominable swindling of the\r\nState for which one was not punished.\r\n\r\nHe had no craving for truth, and had not sought it; spellbound by\r\nvice and lying, his conscience had slept or been silent. Like a\r\nstranger, like an alien from another planet, he had taken no part\r\nin the common life of men, had been indifferent to their sufferings,\r\ntheir ideas, their religion, their sciences, their strivings, and\r\ntheir struggles. He had not said one good word, not written one\r\nline that was not useless and vulgar; he had not done his fellows\r\none ha\'p\'orth of service, but had eaten their bread, drunk their\r\nwine, seduced their wives, lived on their thoughts, and to justify\r\nhis contemptible, parasitic life in their eyes and in his own, he\r\nhad always tried to assume an air of being higher and better than\r\nthey. Lies, lies, lies. . . .\r\n\r\nHe vividly remembered what he had seen that evening at Muridov\'s,\r\nand he was in an insufferable anguish of loathing and misery. Kirilin\r\nand Atchmianov were loathsome, but they were only continuing what\r\nhe had begun; they were his accomplices and his disciples. This\r\nyoung weak woman had trusted him more than a brother, and he had\r\ndeprived her of her husband, of her friends and of her country, and\r\nhad brought her here--to the heat, to fever, and to boredom; and\r\nfrom day to day she was bound to reflect, like a mirror, his idleness,\r\nhis viciousness and falsity--and that was all she had had to fill\r\nher weak, listless, pitiable life. Then he had grown sick of her,\r\nhad begun to hate her, but had not had the pluck to abandon her,\r\nand he had tried to entangle her more and more closely in a web of\r\nlies. . . . These men had done the rest.\r\n\r\nLaevsky sat at the table, then got up and went to the window; at\r\none minute he put out the candle and then he lighted it again. He\r\ncursed himself aloud, wept and wailed, and asked forgiveness; several\r\ntimes he ran to the table in despair, and wrote:\r\n\r\n"Mother!"\r\n\r\nExcept his mother, he had no relations or near friends; but how\r\ncould his mother help him? And where was she? He had an impulse to\r\nrun to Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, to fall at her feet, to kiss her hands\r\nand feet, to beg her forgiveness; but she was his victim, and he\r\nwas afraid of her as though she were dead.\r\n\r\n"My life is ruined," he repeated, rubbing his hands. "Why am I still\r\nalive, my God! . . ."\r\n\r\nHe had cast out of heaven his dim star; it had fallen, and its track\r\nwas lost in the darkness of night. It would never return to the sky\r\nagain, because life was given only once and never came a second\r\ntime. If he could have turned back the days and years of the past,\r\nhe would have replaced the falsity with truth, the idleness with\r\nwork, the boredom with happiness; he would have given back purity\r\nto those whom he had robbed of it. He would have found God and\r\ngoodness, but that was as impossible as to put back the fallen star\r\ninto the sky, and because it was impossible he was in despair.\r\n\r\nWhen the storm was over, he sat by the open window and thought\r\ncalmly of what was before him. Von Koren would most likely kill\r\nhim. The man\'s clear, cold theory of life justified the destruction\r\nof the rotten and the useless; if it changed at the crucial moment,\r\nit would be the hatred and the repugnance that Laevsky inspired in\r\nhim that would save him. If he missed his aim or, in mockery of his\r\nhated opponent, only wounded him, or fired in the air, what could\r\nhe do then? Where could he go?\r\n\r\n"Go to Petersburg?" Laevsky asked himself. But that would mean\r\nbeginning over again the old life which he cursed. And the man who\r\nseeks salvation in change of place like a migrating bird would find\r\nnothing anywhere, for all the world is alike to him. Seek salvation\r\nin men? In whom and how? Samoylenko\'s kindness and generosity could\r\nno more save him than the deacon\'s laughter or Von Koren\'s hatred.\r\nHe must look for salvation in himself alone, and if there were no\r\nfinding it, why waste time? He must kill himself, that was\r\nall. . . .\r\n\r\nHe heard the sound of a carriage. It was getting light. The carriage\r\npassed by, turned, and crunching on the wet sand, stopped near the\r\nhouse. There were two men in the carriage.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute; I\'m coming directly," Laevsky said to them out of\r\nthe window. "I\'m not asleep. Surely it\'s not time yet?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s four o\'clock. By the time we get there . . . ."\r\n\r\nLaevsky put on his overcoat and cap, put some cigarettes in his\r\npocket, and stood still hesitating. He felt as though there was\r\nsomething else he must do. In the street the seconds talked in low\r\nvoices and the horses snorted, and this sound in the damp, early\r\nmorning, when everybody was asleep and light was hardly dawning in\r\nthe sky, filled Laevsky\'s soul with a disconsolate feeling which\r\nwas like a presentiment of evil. He stood for a little, hesitating,\r\nand went into the bedroom.\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna was lying stretched out on the bed, wrapped\r\nfrom head to foot in a rug. She did not stir, and her whole appearance,\r\nespecially her head, suggested an Egyptian mummy. Looking at her\r\nin silence, Laevsky mentally asked her forgiveness, and thought\r\nthat if the heavens were not empty and there really were a God,\r\nthen He would save her; if there were no God, then she had better\r\nperish--there was nothing for her to live for.\r\n\r\nAll at once she jumped up, and sat up in bed. Lifting her pale face\r\nand looking with horror at Laevsky, she asked:\r\n\r\n"Is it you? Is the storm over?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nShe remembered; put both hands to her head and shuddered all over.\r\n\r\n"How miserable I am!" she said. "If only you knew how miserable I\r\nam! I expected," she went on, half closing her eyes, "that you would\r\nkill me or turn me out of the house into the rain and storm, but\r\nyou delay . . . delay . . ."\r\n\r\nWarmly and impulsively he put his arms round her and covered her\r\nknees and hands with kisses. Then when she muttered something and\r\nshuddered with the thought of the past, he stroked her hair, and\r\nlooking into her face, realised that this unhappy, sinful woman was\r\nthe one creature near and dear to him, whom no one could replace.\r\n\r\nWhen he went out of the house and got into the carriage he wanted\r\nto return home alive.\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nThe deacon got up, dressed, took his thick, gnarled stick and slipped\r\nquietly out of the house. It was dark, and for the first minute\r\nwhen he went into the street, he could not even see his white stick.\r\nThere was not a single star in the sky, and it looked as though\r\nthere would be rain again. There was a smell of wet sand and sea.\r\n\r\n"It\'s to be hoped that the mountaineers won\'t attack us," thought\r\nthe deacon, hearing the tap of the stick on the pavement, and\r\nnoticing how loud and lonely the taps sounded in the stillness of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nWhen he got out of town, he began to see both the road and his\r\nstick. Here and there in the black sky there were dark cloudy\r\npatches, and soon a star peeped out and timidly blinked its one\r\neye. The deacon walked along the high rocky coast and did not see\r\nthe sea; it was slumbering below, and its unseen waves broke languidly\r\nand heavily on the shore, as though sighing "Ouf!" and how slowly!\r\nOne wave broke--the deacon had time to count eight steps; then\r\nanother broke, and six steps; later a third. As before, nothing\r\ncould be seen, and in the darkness one could hear the languid,\r\ndrowsy drone of the sea. One could hear the infinitely faraway,\r\ninconceivable time when God moved above chaos.\r\n\r\nThe deacon felt uncanny. He hoped God would not punish him for\r\nkeeping company with infidels, and even going to look at their\r\nduels. The duel would be nonsensical, bloodless, absurd, but however\r\nthat might be, it was a heathen spectacle, and it was altogether\r\nunseemly for an ecclesiastical person to be present at it. He stopped\r\nand wondered--should he go back? But an intense, restless curiosity\r\ntriumphed over his doubts, and he went on.\r\n\r\n"Though they are infidels they are good people, and will be saved,"\r\nhe assured himself. "They are sure to be saved," he said aloud,\r\nlighting a cigarette.\r\n\r\nBy what standard must one measure men\'s qualities, to judge rightly\r\nof them? The deacon remembered his enemy, the inspector of the\r\nclerical school, who believed in God, lived in chastity, and did\r\nnot fight duels; but he used to feed the deacon on bread with sand\r\nin it, and on one occasion almost pulled off the deacon\'s ear. If\r\nhuman life was so artlessly constructed that every one respected\r\nthis cruel and dishonest inspector who stole the Government flour,\r\nand his health and salvation were prayed for in the schools, was\r\nit just to shun such men as Von Koren and Laevsky, simply because\r\nthey were unbelievers? The deacon was weighing this question, but\r\nhe recalled how absurd Samoylenko had looked yesterday, and that\r\nbroke the thread of his ideas. What fun they would have next day!\r\nThe deacon imagined how he would sit under a bush and look on, and\r\nwhen Von Koren began boasting next day at dinner, he, the deacon,\r\nwould begin laughing and telling him all the details of the duel.\r\n\r\n"How do you know all about it?" the zoologist would ask.\r\n\r\n"Well, there you are! I stayed at home, but I know all about it."\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to write a comic description of the duel. His\r\nfather-in-law would read it and laugh. A good story, told or written,\r\nwas more than meat and drink to his father-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Yellow River opened before him. The stream was\r\nbroader and fiercer for the rain, and instead of murmuring as before,\r\nit was raging. It began to get light. The grey, dingy morning, and\r\nthe clouds racing towards the west to overtake the storm-clouds,\r\nthe mountains girt with mist, and the wet trees, all struck the\r\ndeacon as ugly and sinister. He washed at the brook, repeated his\r\nmorning prayer, and felt a longing for tea and hot rolls, with sour\r\ncream, which were served every morning at his father-in-law\'s. He\r\nremembered his wife and the "Days past Recall," which she played\r\non the piano. What sort of woman was she? His wife had been introduced,\r\nbetrothed, and married to him all in one week: he had lived with\r\nher less than a month when he was ordered here, so that he had not\r\nhad time to find out what she was like. All the same, he rather\r\nmissed her.\r\n\r\n"I must write her a nice letter . . ." he thought. The flag on the\r\n_duhan_ hung limp, soaked by the rain, and the _duhan_ itself with\r\nits wet roof seemed darker and lower than it had been before. Near\r\nthe door was standing a cart; Kerbalay, with two mountaineers and\r\na young Tatar woman in trousers--no doubt Kerbalay\'s wife or\r\ndaughter--were bringing sacks of something out of the _duhan_,\r\nand putting them on maize straw in the cart.\r\n\r\nNear the cart stood a pair of asses hanging their heads. When they\r\nhad put in all the sacks, the mountaineers and the Tatar woman began\r\ncovering them over with straw, while Kerbalay began hurriedly\r\nharnessing the asses.\r\n\r\n"Smuggling, perhaps," thought the deacon.\r\n\r\nHere was the fallen tree with the dried pine-needles, here was the\r\nblackened patch from the fire. He remembered the picnic and all its\r\nincidents, the fire, the singing of the mountaineers, his sweet\r\ndreams of becoming a bishop, and of the Church procession. . . .\r\nThe Black River had grown blacker and broader with the rain. The\r\ndeacon walked cautiously over the narrow bridge, which by now was\r\nreached by the topmost crests of the dirty water, and went up through\r\nthe little copse to the drying-shed.\r\n\r\n"A splendid head," he thought, stretching himself on the straw, and\r\nthinking of Von Koren. "A fine head--God grant him health; only\r\nthere is cruelty in him. . . ."\r\n\r\nWhy did he hate Laevsky and Laevsky hate him? Why were they going\r\nto fight a duel? If from their childhood they had known poverty as\r\nthe deacon had; if they had been brought up among ignorant,\r\nhard-hearted, grasping, coarse and ill-mannered people who grudged\r\nyou a crust of bread, who spat on the floor and hiccoughed at dinner\r\nand at prayers; if they had not been spoilt from childhood by the\r\npleasant surroundings and the select circle of friends they lived\r\nin--how they would have rushed at each other, how readily they\r\nwould have overlooked each other\'s shortcomings and would have\r\nprized each other\'s strong points! Why, how few even outwardly\r\ndecent people there were in the world! It was true that Laevsky was\r\nflighty, dissipated, queer, but he did not steal, did not spit\r\nloudly on the floor; he did not abuse his wife and say, "You\'ll eat\r\ntill you burst, but you don\'t want to work;" he would not beat a\r\nchild with reins, or give his servants stinking meat to eat--\r\nsurely this was reason enough to be indulgent to him? Besides, he\r\nwas the chief sufferer from his failings, like a sick man from his\r\nsores. Instead of being led by boredom and some sort of misunderstanding\r\nto look for degeneracy, extinction, heredity, and other such\r\nincomprehensible things in each other, would they not do better to\r\nstoop a little lower and turn their hatred and anger where whole\r\nstreets resounded with moanings from coarse ignorance, greed,\r\nscolding, impurity, swearing, the shrieks of women. . . .\r\n\r\nThe sound of a carriage interrupted the deacon\'s thoughts. He glanced\r\nout of the door and saw a carriage and in it three persons: Laevsky,\r\nSheshkovsky, and the superintendent of the post-office.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" said Sheshkovsky.\r\n\r\nAll three got out of the carriage and looked at one another.\r\n\r\n"They are not here yet," said Sheshkovsky, shaking the mud off.\r\n"Well? Till the show begins, let us go and find a suitable spot;\r\nthere\'s not room to turn round here."\r\n\r\nThey went further up the river and soon vanished from sight. The\r\nTatar driver sat in the carriage with his head resting on his\r\nshoulder and fell asleep. After waiting ten minutes the deacon came\r\nout of the drying-shed, and taking off his black hat that he might\r\nnot be noticed, he began threading his way among the bushes and\r\nstrips of maize along the bank, crouching and looking about him.\r\nThe grass and maize were wet, and big drops fell on his head from\r\nthe trees and bushes. "Disgraceful!" he muttered, picking up his\r\nwet and muddy skirt. "Had I realised it, I would not have come."\r\n\r\nSoon he heard voices and caught sight of them. Laevsky was walking\r\nrapidly to and fro in the small glade with bowed back and hands\r\nthrust in his sleeves; his seconds were standing at the water\'s\r\nedge, rolling cigarettes.\r\n\r\n"Strange," thought the deacon, not recognising Laevsky\'s walk; "he\r\nlooks like an old man. . . ."\r\n\r\n"How rude it is of them!" said the superintendent of the post-office,\r\nlooking at his watch. "It may be learned manners to be late, but\r\nto my thinking it\'s hoggish."\r\n\r\nSheshkovsky, a stout man with a black beard, listened and said:\r\n\r\n"They\'re coming!"\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n"It\'s the first time in my life I\'ve seen it! How glorious!" said\r\nVon Koren, pointing to the glade and stretching out his hands to\r\nthe east. "Look: green rays!"\r\n\r\nIn the east behind the mountains rose two green streaks of light,\r\nand it really was beautiful. The sun was rising.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning!" the zoologist went on, nodding to Laevsky\'s seconds.\r\n"I\'m not late, am I?"\r\n\r\nHe was followed by his seconds, Boyko and Govorovsky, two very young\r\nofficers of the same height, wearing white tunics, and Ustimovitch,\r\nthe thin, unsociable doctor; in one hand he had a bag of some sort,\r\nand in the other hand, as usual, a cane which he held behind him.\r\nLaying the bag on the ground and greeting no one, he put the other\r\nhand, too, behind his back and began pacing up and down the glade.\r\n\r\nLaevsky felt the exhaustion and awkwardness of a man who is soon\r\nperhaps to die, and is for that reason an object of general attention.\r\nHe wanted to be killed as soon as possible or taken home. He saw\r\nthe sunrise now for the first time in his life; the early morning,\r\nthe green rays of light, the dampness, and the men in wet boots,\r\nseemed to him to have nothing to do with his life, to be superfluous\r\nand embarrassing. All this had no connection with the night he had\r\nbeen through, with his thoughts and his feeling of guilt, and so\r\nhe would have gladly gone away without waiting for the duel.\r\n\r\nVon Koren was noticeably excited and tried to conceal it, pretending\r\nthat he was more interested in the green light than anything. The\r\nseconds were confused, and looked at one another as though wondering\r\nwhy they were here and what they were to do.\r\n\r\n"I imagine, gentlemen, there is no need for us to go further," said\r\nSheshkovsky. "This place will do."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course," Von Koren agreed.\r\n\r\nA silence followed. Ustimovitch, pacing to and fro, suddenly turned\r\nsharply to Laevsky and said in a low voice, breathing into his face:\r\n\r\n"They have very likely not told you my terms yet. Each side is to\r\npay me fifteen roubles, and in the case of the death of one party,\r\nthe survivor is to pay thirty."\r\n\r\nLaevsky was already acquainted with the man, but now for the first\r\ntime he had a distinct view of his lustreless eyes, his stiff\r\nmoustaches, and wasted, consumptive neck; he was a money-grubber,\r\nnot a doctor; his breath had an unpleasant smell of beef.\r\n\r\n"What people there are in the world!" thought Laevsky, and answered:\r\n"Very good."\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded and began pacing to and fro again, and it was\r\nevident he did not need the money at all, but simply asked for it\r\nfrom hatred. Every one felt it was time to begin, or to end what\r\nhad been begun, but instead of beginning or ending, they stood\r\nabout, moved to and fro and smoked. The young officers, who were\r\npresent at a duel for the first time in their lives, and even now\r\nhardly believed in this civilian and, to their thinking, unnecessary\r\nduel, looked critically at their tunics and stroked their sleeves.\r\nSheshkovsky went up to them and said softly: "Gentlemen, we must\r\nuse every effort to prevent this duel; they ought to be reconciled."\r\n\r\nHe flushed crimson and added:\r\n\r\n"Kirilin was at my rooms last night complaining that Laevsky had\r\nfound him with Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and all that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we know that too," said Boyko.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, then . . . Laevsky\'s hands are trembling and all\r\nthat sort of thing . . . he can scarcely hold a pistol now. To fight\r\nwith him is as inhuman as to fight a man who is drunk or who has\r\ntyphoid. If a reconciliation cannot be arranged, we ought to put\r\noff the duel, gentlemen, or something. . . . It\'s such a sickening\r\nbusiness, I can\'t bear to see it."\r\n\r\n"Talk to Von Koren."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know the rules of duelling, damnation take them, and I\r\ndon\'t want to either; perhaps he\'ll imagine Laevsky funks it and\r\nhas sent me to him, but he can think what he likes--I\'ll speak\r\nto him."\r\n\r\nSheshkovsky hesitatingly walked up to Von Koren with a slight limp,\r\nas though his leg had gone to sleep; and as he went towards him,\r\nclearing his throat, his whole figure was a picture of indolence.\r\n\r\n"There\'s something I must say to you, sir," he began, carefully\r\nscrutinising the flowers on the zoologist\'s shirt. "It\'s confidential.\r\nI don\'t know the rules of duelling, damnation take them, and I don\'t\r\nwant to, and I look on the matter not as a second and that sort of\r\nthing, but as a man, and that\'s all about it."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Well?"\r\n\r\n"When seconds suggest reconciliation they are usually not listened\r\nto; it is looked upon as a formality. _Amour propre_ and all that.\r\nBut I humbly beg you to look carefully at Ivan Andreitch. He\'s not\r\nin a normal state, so to speak, to-day--not in his right mind,\r\nand a pitiable object. He has had a misfortune. I can\'t endure\r\ngossip. . . ."\r\n\r\nSheshkovsky flushed crimson and looked round.\r\n\r\n"But in view of the duel, I think it necessary to inform you, Laevsky\r\nfound his madam last night at Muridov\'s with . . . another gentleman."\r\n\r\n"How disgusting!" muttered the zoologist; he turned pale, frowned,\r\nand spat loudly. "Tfoo!"\r\n\r\nHis lower lip quivered, he walked away from Sheshkovsky, unwilling\r\nto hear more, and as though he had accidentally tasted something\r\nbitter, spat loudly again, and for the first time that morning\r\nlooked with hatred at Laevsky. His excitement and awkwardness passed\r\noff; he tossed his head and said aloud:\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, what are we waiting for, I should like to know? Why\r\ndon\'t we begin?"\r\n\r\nSheshkovsky glanced at the officers and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," he said aloud, addressing no one in particular.\r\n"Gentlemen, we propose that you should be reconciled."\r\n\r\n"Let us make haste and get the formalities over," said Von Koren.\r\n"Reconciliation has been discussed already. What is the next\r\nformality? Make haste, gentlemen, time won\'t wait for us."\r\n\r\n"But we insist on reconciliation all the same," said Sheshkovsky\r\nin a guilty voice, as a man compelled to interfere in another man\'s\r\nbusiness; he flushed, laid his hand on his heart, and went on:\r\n"Gentlemen, we see no grounds for associating the offence with the\r\nduel. There\'s nothing in common between duelling and offences against\r\none another of which we are sometimes guilty through human weakness.\r\nYou are university men and men of culture, and no doubt you see in\r\nthe duel nothing but a foolish and out-of-date formality, and all\r\nthat sort of thing. That\'s how we look at it ourselves, or we\r\nshouldn\'t have come, for we cannot allow that in our presence men\r\nshould fire at one another, and all that." Sheshkovsky wiped the\r\nperspiration off his face and went on: "Make an end to your\r\nmisunderstanding, gentlemen; shake hands, and let us go home and\r\ndrink to peace. Upon my honour, gentlemen!"\r\n\r\nVon Koren did not speak. Laevsky, seeing that they were looking at\r\nhim, said:\r\n\r\n"I have nothing against Nikolay Vassilitch; if he considers I\'m to\r\nblame, I\'m ready to apologise to him."\r\n\r\nVon Koren was offended.\r\n\r\n"It is evident, gentlemen," he said, "you want Mr. Laevsky to return\r\nhome a magnanimous and chivalrous figure, but I cannot give you and\r\nhim that satisfaction. And there was no need to get up early and\r\ndrive eight miles out of town simply to drink to peace, to have\r\nbreakfast, and to explain to me that the duel is an out-of-date\r\nformality. A duel is a duel, and there is no need to make it more\r\nfalse and stupid than it is in reality. I want to fight!"\r\n\r\nA silence followed. Boyko took a pair of pistols out of a box; one\r\nwas given to Von Koren and one to Laevsky, and then there followed\r\na difficulty which afforded a brief amusement to the zoologist and\r\nthe seconds. It appeared that of all the people present not one had\r\never in his life been at a duel, and no one knew precisely how they\r\nought to stand, and what the seconds ought to say and do. But then\r\nBoyko remembered and began, with a smile, to explain.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, who remembers the description in Lermontov?" asked Von\r\nKoren, laughing. "In Turgenev, too, Bazarov had a duel with some\r\none. . . ."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no need to remember," said Ustimovitch impatiently. "Measure\r\nthe distance, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nAnd he took three steps as though to show how to measure it. Boyko\r\ncounted out the steps while his companion drew his sabre and scratched\r\nthe earth at the extreme points to mark the barrier. In complete\r\nsilence the opponents took their places.\r\n\r\n"Moles," the deacon thought, sitting in the bushes.\r\n\r\nSheshkovsky said something, Boyko explained something again, but\r\nLaevsky did not hear--or rather heard, but did not understand.\r\nHe cocked his pistol when the time came to do so, and raised the\r\ncold, heavy weapon with the barrel upwards. He forgot to unbutton\r\nhis overcoat, and it felt very tight over his shoulder and under\r\nhis arm, and his arm rose as awkwardly as though the sleeve had\r\nbeen cut out of tin. He remembered the hatred he had felt the night\r\nbefore for the swarthy brow and curly hair, and felt that even\r\nyesterday at the moment of intense hatred and anger he could not\r\nhave shot a man. Fearing that the bullet might somehow hit Von Koren\r\nby accident, he raised the pistol higher and higher, and felt that\r\nthis too obvious magnanimity was indelicate and anything but\r\nmagnanimous, but he did not know how else to do and could do nothing\r\nelse. Looking at the pale, ironically smiling face of Von Koren,\r\nwho evidently had been convinced from the beginning that his opponent\r\nwould fire in the air, Laevsky thought that, thank God, everything\r\nwould be over directly, and all that he had to do was to press the\r\ntrigger rather hard. . . .\r\n\r\nHe felt a violent shock on the shoulder; there was the sound of a\r\nshot and an answering echo in the mountains: ping-ting!\r\n\r\nVon Koren cocked his pistol and looked at Ustimovitch, who was\r\npacing as before with his hands behind his back, taking no notice\r\nof any one.\r\n\r\n"Doctor," said the zoologist, "be so good as not to move to and fro\r\nlike a pendulum. You make me dizzy."\r\n\r\nThe doctor stood still. Von Koren began to take aim at Laevsky.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all over!" thought Laevsky.\r\n\r\nThe barrel of the pistol aimed straight at his face, the expression\r\nof hatred and contempt in Von Koren\'s attitude and whole figure,\r\nand the murder just about to be committed by a decent man in broad\r\ndaylight, in the presence of decent men, and the stillness and the\r\nunknown force that compelled Laevsky to stand still and not to run\r\n--how mysterious it all was, how incomprehensible and terrible!\r\n\r\nThe moment while Von Koren was taking aim seemed to Laevsky longer\r\nthan a night: he glanced imploringly at the seconds; they were pale\r\nand did not stir.\r\n\r\n"Make haste and fire," thought Laevsky, and felt that his pale,\r\nquivering, and pitiful face must arouse even greater hatred in Von\r\nKoren.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll kill him directly," thought Von Koren, aiming at his forehead,\r\nwith his finger already on the catch. "Yes, of course I\'ll kill\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll kill him!" A despairing shout was suddenly heard somewhere\r\nvery close at hand.\r\n\r\nA shot rang out at once. Seeing that Laevsky remained standing where\r\nhe was and did not fall, they all looked in the direction from which\r\nthe shout had come, and saw the deacon. With pale face and wet hair\r\nsticking to his forehead and his cheeks, wet through and muddy, he\r\nwas standing in the maize on the further bank, smiling rather queerly\r\nand waving his wet hat. Sheshkovsky laughed with joy, burst into\r\ntears, and moved away. . . .\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nA little while afterwards, Von Koren and the deacon met near the\r\nlittle bridge. The deacon was excited; he breathed hard, and avoided\r\nlooking in people\'s faces. He felt ashamed both of his terror and\r\nhis muddy, wet garments.\r\n\r\n"I thought you meant to kill him . . ." he muttered. "How contrary\r\nto human nature it is! How utterly unnatural it is!"\r\n\r\n"But how did you come here?" asked the zoologist.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ask," said the deacon, waving his hand. "The evil one tempted\r\nme, saying: \'Go, go. . . .\' So I went and almost died of fright in\r\nthe maize. But now, thank God, thank God. . . . I am awfully pleased\r\nwith you," muttered the deacon. "Old Grandad Tarantula will be glad\r\n. . . . It\'s funny, it\'s too funny! Only I beg of you most earnestly\r\ndon\'t tell anybody I was there, or I may get into hot water with\r\nthe authorities. They will say: \'The deacon was a second.\'"\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said Von Koren, "the deacon asks you not to tell any\r\none you\'ve seen him here. He might get into trouble."\r\n\r\n"How contrary to human nature it is!" sighed the deacon. "Excuse\r\nmy saying so, but your face was so dreadful that I thought you were\r\ngoing to kill him."\r\n\r\n"I was very much tempted to put an end to that scoundrel," said Von\r\nKoren, "but you shouted close by, and I missed my aim. The whole\r\nprocedure is revolting to any one who is not used to it, and it has\r\nexhausted me, deacon. I feel awfully tired. Come along. . . ."\r\n\r\n"No, you must let me walk back. I must get dry, for I am wet and\r\ncold."\r\n\r\n"Well, as you like," said the zoologist, in a weary tone, feeling\r\ndispirited, and, getting into the carriage, he closed his eyes. "As\r\nyou like. . . ."\r\n\r\nWhile they were moving about the carriages and taking their seats,\r\nKerbalay stood in the road, and, laying his hands on his stomach,\r\nhe bowed low, showing his teeth; he imagined that the gentry had\r\ncome to enjoy the beauties of nature and drink tea, and could not\r\nunderstand why they were getting into the carriages. The party set\r\noff in complete silence and only the deacon was left by the _duhan_.\r\n\r\n"Come to the _duhan_, drink tea," he said to Kerbalay. "Me wants\r\nto eat."\r\n\r\nKerbalay spoke good Russian, but the deacon imagined that the Tatar\r\nwould understand him better if he talked to him in broken Russian.\r\n"Cook omelette, give cheese. . . ."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, father," said Kerbalay, bowing. "I\'ll give you everything\r\n. . . . I\'ve cheese and wine. . . . Eat what you like."\r\n\r\n"What is \'God\' in Tatar?" asked the deacon, going into the _duhan_.\r\n\r\n"Your God and my God are the same," said Kerbalay, not understanding\r\nhim. "God is the same for all men, only men are different. Some are\r\nRussian, some are Turks, some are English--there are many sorts\r\nof men, but God is one."\r\n\r\n"Very good. If all men worship the same God, why do you Mohammedans\r\nlook upon Christians as your everlasting enemies?"\r\n\r\n"Why are you angry?" said Kerbalay, laying both hands on his stomach.\r\n"You are a priest; I am a Mussulman: you say, \'I want to eat\'--I\r\ngive it you. . . . Only the rich man distinguishes your God from\r\nmy God; for the poor man it is all the same. If you please, it is\r\nready."\r\n\r\nWhile this theological conversation was taking place at the _duhan_,\r\nLaevsky was driving home thinking how dreadful it had been driving\r\nthere at daybreak, when the roads, the rocks, and the mountains\r\nwere wet and dark, and the uncertain future seemed like a terrible\r\nabyss, of which one could not see the bottom; while now the raindrops\r\nhanging on the grass and on the stones were sparkling in the sun\r\nlike diamonds, nature was smiling joyfully, and the terrible future\r\nwas left behind. He looked at Sheshkovsky\'s sullen, tear-stained\r\nface, and at the two carriages ahead of them in which Von Koren,\r\nhis seconds, and the doctor were sitting, and it seemed to him as\r\nthough they were all coming back from a graveyard in which a\r\nwearisome, insufferable man who was a burden to others had just\r\nbeen buried.\r\n\r\n"Everything is over," he thought of his past, cautiously touching\r\nhis neck with his fingers.\r\n\r\nOn the right side of his neck was a small swelling, of the length\r\nand breadth of his little finger, and he felt a pain, as though\r\nsome one had passed a hot iron over his neck. The bullet had bruised\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when he got home, a strange, long, sweet day began for\r\nhim, misty as forgetfulness. Like a man released from prison or\r\nfrom hospital, he stared at the long-familiar objects and wondered\r\nthat the tables, the windows, the chairs, the light, and the sea\r\nstirred in him a keen, childish delight such as he had not known\r\nfor long, long years. Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, pale and haggard, could\r\nnot understand his gentle voice and strange movements; she made\r\nhaste to tell him everything that had happened to her. . . . It\r\nseemed to her that very likely he scarcely heard and did not\r\nunderstand her, and that if he did know everything he would curse\r\nher and kill her, but he listened to her, stroked her face and hair,\r\nlooked into her eyes and said:\r\n\r\n"I have nobody but you. . . ."\r\n\r\nThen they sat a long while in the garden, huddled close together,\r\nsaying nothing, or dreaming aloud of their happy life in the future,\r\nin brief, broken sentences, while it seemed to him that he had never\r\nspoken at such length or so eloquently.\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nMore than three months had passed.\r\n\r\nThe day came that Von Koren had fixed on for his departure. A cold,\r\nheavy rain had been falling from early morning, a north-east wind\r\nwas blowing, and the waves were high on the sea. It was said that\r\nthe steamer would hardly be able to come into the harbour in such\r\nweather. By the time-table it should have arrived at ten o\'clock\r\nin the morning, but Von Koren, who had gone on to the sea-front at\r\nmidday and again after dinner, could see nothing through the\r\nfield-glass but grey waves and rain covering the horizon.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the day the rain ceased and the wind began to\r\ndrop perceptibly. Von Koren had already made up his mind that he\r\nwould not be able to get off that day, and had settled down to play\r\nchess with Samoylenko; but after dark the orderly announced that\r\nthere were lights on the sea and that a rocket had been seen.\r\n\r\nVon Koren made haste. He put his satchel over his shoulder, and\r\nkissed Samoylenko and the deacon. Though there was not the slightest\r\nnecessity, he went through the rooms again, said good-bye to the\r\norderly and the cook, and went out into the street, feeling that\r\nhe had left something behind, either at the doctor\'s or his lodging.\r\nIn the street he walked beside Samoylenko, behind them came the\r\ndeacon with a box, and last of all the orderly with two portmanteaus.\r\nOnly Samoylenko and the orderly could distinguish the dim lights\r\non the sea. The others gazed into the darkness and saw nothing. The\r\nsteamer had stopped a long way from the coast.\r\n\r\n"Make haste, make haste," Von Koren hurried them. "I am afraid it\r\nwill set off."\r\n\r\nAs they passed the little house with three windows, into which\r\nLaevsky had moved soon after the duel, Von Koren could not resist\r\npeeping in at the window. Laevsky was sitting, writing, bent over\r\nthe table, with his back to the window.\r\n\r\n"I wonder at him!" said the zoologist softly. "What a screw he has\r\nput on himself!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, one may well wonder," said Samoylenko. "He sits from morning\r\ntill night, he\'s always at work. He works to pay off his debts. And\r\nhe lives, brother, worse than a beggar!"\r\n\r\nHalf a minute of silence followed. The zoologist, the doctor, and\r\nthe deacon stood at the window and went on looking at Laevsky.\r\n\r\n"So he didn\'t get away from here, poor fellow," said Samoylenko.\r\n"Do you remember how hard he tried?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he has put a screw on himself," Von Koren repeated. "His\r\nmarriage, the way he works all day long for his daily bread, a new\r\nexpression in his face, and even in his walk--it\'s all so\r\nextraordinary that I don\'t know what to call it."\r\n\r\nThe zoologist took Samoylenko\'s sleeve and went on with emotion in\r\nhis voice:\r\n\r\n"You tell him and his wife that when I went away I was full of\r\nadmiration for them and wished them all happiness . . . and I beg\r\nhim, if he can, not to remember evil against me. He knows me. He\r\nknows that if I could have foreseen this change, then I might have\r\nbecome his best friend."\r\n\r\n"Go in and say good-bye to him."\r\n\r\n"No, that wouldn\'t do."\r\n\r\n"Why? God knows, perhaps you\'ll never see him again."\r\n\r\nThe zoologist reflected, and said:\r\n\r\n"That\'s true."\r\n\r\nSamoylenko tapped softly at the window. Laevsky started and looked\r\nround.\r\n\r\n"Vanya, Nikolay Vassilitch wants to say goodbye to you," said\r\nSamoylenko. "He is just going away."\r\n\r\nLaevsky got up from the table, and went into the passage to open\r\nthe door. Samoylenko, the zoologist, and the deacon went into the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n"I can only come for one minute," began the zoologist, taking off\r\nhis goloshes in the passage, and already wishing he had not given\r\nway to his feelings and come in, uninvited. "It is as though I were\r\nforcing myself on him," he thought, "and that\'s stupid."\r\n\r\n"Forgive me for disturbing you," he said as he went into the room\r\nwith Laevsky, "but I\'m just going away, and I had an impulse to see\r\nyou. God knows whether we shall ever meet again."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to see you. . . . Please come in," said Laevsky,\r\nand he awkwardly set chairs for his visitors as though he wanted\r\nto bar their way, and stood in the middle of the room, rubbing his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n"I should have done better to have left my audience in the street,"\r\nthought Von Koren, and he said firmly: "Don\'t remember evil against\r\nme, Ivan Andreitch. To forget the past is, of course, impossible\r\n--it is too painful, and I\'ve not come here to apologise or to\r\ndeclare that I was not to blame. I acted sincerely, and I have not\r\nchanged my convictions since then. . . . It is true that I see, to\r\nmy great delight, that I was mistaken in regard to you, but it\'s\r\neasy to make a false step even on a smooth road, and, in fact, it\'s\r\nthe natural human lot: if one is not mistaken in the main, one is\r\nmistaken in the details. Nobody knows the real truth."\r\n\r\n"No, no one knows the truth," said Laevsky.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-bye. . . . God give you all happiness."\r\n\r\nVon Koren gave Laevsky his hand; the latter took it and bowed.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t remember evil against me," said Von Koren. "Give my greetings\r\nto your wife, and say I am very sorry not to say good-bye to her."\r\n\r\n"She is at home."\r\n\r\nLaevsky went to the door of the next room, and said:\r\n\r\n"Nadya, Nikolay Vassilitch wants to say goodbye to you."\r\n\r\nNadyezhda Fyodorovna came in; she stopped near the doorway and\r\nlooked shyly at the visitors. There was a look of guilt and dismay\r\non her face, and she held her hands like a schoolgirl receiving a\r\nscolding.\r\n\r\n"I\'m just going away, Nadyezhda Fyodorovna," said Von Koren, "and\r\nhave come to say good-bye."\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand uncertainly, while Laevsky bowed.\r\n\r\n"What pitiful figures they are, though!" thought Von Koren. "The\r\nlife they are living does not come easy to them. I shall be in\r\nMoscow and Petersburg; can I send you anything?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Nadyezhda Fyodorovna, and she looked anxiously at her\r\nhusband. "I don\'t think there\'s anything. . . ."\r\n\r\n"No, nothing . . ." said Laevsky, rubbing his hands. "Our greetings."\r\n\r\nVon Koren did not know what he could or ought to say, though as he\r\nwent in he thought he would say a very great deal that would be\r\nwarm and good and important. He shook hands with Laevsky and his\r\nwife in silence, and left them with a depressed feeling.\r\n\r\n"What people!" said the deacon in a low voice, as he walked behind\r\nthem. "My God, what people! Of a truth, the right hand of God has\r\nplanted this vine! Lord! Lord! One man vanquishes thousands and\r\nanother tens of thousands. Nikolay Vassilitch," he said ecstatically,\r\n"let me tell you that to-day you have conquered the greatest of\r\nman\'s enemies--pride."\r\n\r\n"Hush, deacon! Fine conquerors we are! Conquerors ought to look\r\nlike eagles, while he\'s a pitiful figure, timid, crushed; he bows\r\nlike a Chinese idol, and I, I am sad. . . ."\r\n\r\nThey heard steps behind them. It was Laevsky, hurrying after them\r\nto see him off. The orderly was standing on the quay with the two\r\nportmanteaus, and at a little distance stood four boatmen.\r\n\r\n"There is a wind, though. . . . Brrr!" said Samoylenko. "There must\r\nbe a pretty stiff storm on the sea now! You are not going off at a\r\nnice time, Koyla."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid of sea-sickness."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the point. . . . I only hope these rascals won\'t upset\r\nyou. You ought to have crossed in the agent\'s sloop. Where\'s the\r\nagent\'s sloop?" he shouted to the boatmen.\r\n\r\n"It has gone, Your Excellency."\r\n\r\n"And the Customs-house boat?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s gone, too."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you let us know," said Samoylenko angrily. "You dolts!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all the same, don\'t worry yourself . . ." said Von Koren.\r\n"Well, good-bye. God keep you."\r\n\r\nSamoylenko embraced Von Koren and made the sign of the cross over\r\nhim three times.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t forget us, Kolya. . . . Write. . . . We shall look out for\r\nyou next spring."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, deacon," said Von Koren, shaking hands with the deacon.\r\n"Thank you for your company and for your pleasant conversation.\r\nThink about the expedition."\r\n\r\n"Oh Lord, yes! to the ends of the earth," laughed the deacon. "I\'ve\r\nnothing against it."\r\n\r\nVon Koren recognised Laevsky in the darkness, and held out his hand\r\nwithout speaking. The boatmen were by now below, holding the boat,\r\nwhich was beating against the piles, though the breakwater screened\r\nit from the breakers. Von Koren went down the ladder, jumped into\r\nthe boat, and sat at the helm.\r\n\r\n"Write!" Samoylenko shouted to him. "Take care of yourself."\r\n\r\n"No one knows the real truth," thought Laevsky, turning up the\r\ncollar of his coat and thrusting his hands into his sleeves.\r\n\r\nThe boat turned briskly out of the harbour into the open sea. It\r\nvanished in the waves, but at once from a deep hollow glided up\r\nonto a high breaker, so that they could distinguish the men and\r\neven the oars. The boat moved three yards forward and was sucked\r\ntwo yards back.\r\n\r\n"Write!" shouted Samoylenko; "it\'s devilish weather for you to go\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"Yes, no one knows the real truth . . ." thought Laevsky, looking\r\nwearily at the dark, restless sea.\r\n\r\n"It flings the boat back," he thought; "she makes two steps forward\r\nand one step back; but the boatmen are stubborn, they work the oars\r\nunceasingly, and are not afraid of the high waves. The boat goes\r\non and on. Now she is out of sight, but in half an hour the boatmen\r\nwill see the steamer lights distinctly, and within an hour they\r\nwill be by the steamer ladder. So it is in life. . . . In the search\r\nfor truth man makes two steps forward and one step back. Suffering,\r\nmistakes, and weariness of life thrust them back, but the thirst\r\nfor truth and stubborn will drive them on and on. And who knows?\r\nPerhaps they will reach the real truth at last."\r\n\r\n"Go--o--od-by--e," shouted Samoylenko.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no sight or sound of them," said the deacon. "Good luck\r\non the journey!"\r\n\r\nIt began to spot with rain.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCELLENT PEOPLE\r\n\r\nONCE upon a time there lived in Moscow a man called Vladimir\r\nSemyonitch Liadovsky. He took his degree at the university in the\r\nfaculty of law and had a post on the board of management of some\r\nrailway; but if you had asked him what his work was, he would look\r\ncandidly and openly at you with his large bright eyes through his\r\ngold pincenez, and would answer in a soft, velvety, lisping baritone:\r\n\r\n"My work is literature."\r\n\r\nAfter completing his course at the university, Vladimir Semyonitch\r\nhad had a paragraph of theatrical criticism accepted by a newspaper.\r\nFrom this paragraph he passed on to reviewing, and a year later he\r\nhad advanced to writing a weekly article on literary matters for\r\nthe same paper. But it does not follow from these facts that he was\r\nan amateur, that his literary work was of an ephemeral, haphazard\r\ncharacter. Whenever I saw his neat spare figure, his high forehead\r\nand long mane of hair, when I listened to his speeches, it always\r\nseemed to me that his writing, quite apart from what and how he\r\nwrote, was something organically part of him, like the beating of\r\nhis heart, and that his whole literary programme must have been an\r\nintegral part of his brain while he was a baby in his mother\'s womb.\r\nEven in his walk, his gestures, his manner of shaking off the ash\r\nfrom his cigarette, I could read this whole programme from A to Z,\r\nwith all its claptrap, dulness, and honourable sentiments. He was\r\na literary man all over when with an inspired face he laid a wreath\r\non the coffin of some celebrity, or with a grave and solemn face\r\ncollected signatures for some address; his passion for making the\r\nacquaintance of distinguished literary men, his faculty for finding\r\ntalent even where it was absent, his perpetual enthusiasm, his pulse\r\nthat went at one hundred and twenty a minute, his ignorance of life,\r\nthe genuinely feminine flutter with which he threw himself into\r\nconcerts and literary evenings for the benefit of destitute students,\r\nthe way in which he gravitated towards the young--all this would\r\nhave created for him the reputation of a writer even if he had not\r\nwritten his articles.\r\n\r\nHe was one of those writers to whom phrases like, "We are but few,"\r\nor "What would life be without strife? Forward!" were pre-eminently\r\nbecoming, though he never strove with any one and never did go\r\nforward. It did not even sound mawkish when he fell to discoursing\r\nof ideals. Every anniversary of the university, on St. Tatiana\'s\r\nDay, he got drunk, chanted _Gaudeamus_ out of tune, and his beaming\r\nand perspiring countenance seemed to say: "See, I\'m drunk; I\'m\r\nkeeping it up!" But even that suited him.\r\n\r\nVladimir Semyonitch had genuine faith in his literary vocation and\r\nhis whole programme. He had no doubts, and was evidently very well\r\npleased with himself. Only one thing grieved him--the paper for\r\nwhich he worked had a limited circulation and was not very influential.\r\nBut Vladimir Semyonitch believed that sooner or later he would\r\nsucceed in getting on to a solid magazine where he would have scope\r\nand could display himself--and what little distress he felt on\r\nthis score was pale beside the brilliance of his hopes.\r\n\r\nVisiting this charming man, I made the acquaintance of his sister,\r\nVera Semyonovna, a woman doctor. At first sight, what struck me\r\nabout this woman was her look of exhaustion and extreme ill-health.\r\nShe was young, with a good figure and regular, rather large features,\r\nbut in comparison with her agile, elegant, and talkative brother\r\nshe seemed angular, listless, slovenly, and sullen. There was\r\nsomething strained, cold, apathetic in her movements, smiles, and\r\nwords; she was not liked, and was thought proud and not very\r\nintelligent.\r\n\r\nIn reality, I fancy, she was resting.\r\n\r\n"My dear friend," her brother would often say to me, sighing and\r\nflinging back his hair in his picturesque literary way, "one must\r\nnever judge by appearances! Look at this book: it has long ago been\r\nread. It is warped, tattered, and lies in the dust uncared for; but\r\nopen it, and it will make you weep and turn pale. My sister is like\r\nthat book. Lift the cover and peep into her soul, and you will be\r\nhorror-stricken. Vera passed in some three months through experiences\r\nthat would have been ample for a whole lifetime!"\r\n\r\nVladimir Semyonitch looked round him, took me by the sleeve, and\r\nbegan to whisper:\r\n\r\n"You know, after taking her degree she married, for love, an\r\narchitect. It\'s a complete tragedy! They had hardly been married a\r\nmonth when--whew--her husband died of typhus. But that was not\r\nall. She caught typhus from him, and when, on her recovery, she\r\nlearnt that her Ivan was dead, she took a good dose of morphia. If\r\nit had not been for vigorous measures taken by her friends, my Vera\r\nwould have been by now in Paradise. Tell me, isn\'t it a tragedy?\r\nAnd is not my sister like an _ingenue_, who has played already all\r\nthe five acts of her life? The audience may stay for the farce, but\r\nthe _ingenue_ must go home to rest."\r\n\r\nAfter three months of misery Vera Semyonovna had come to live with\r\nher brother. She was not fitted for the practice of medicine, which\r\nexhausted her and did not satisfy her; she did not give one the\r\nimpression of knowing her subject, and I never once heard her say\r\nanything referring to her medical studies.\r\n\r\nShe gave up medicine, and, silent and unoccupied, as though she\r\nwere a prisoner, spent the remainder of her youth in colourless\r\napathy, with bowed head and hanging hands. The only thing to which\r\nshe was not completely indifferent, and which brought some brightness\r\ninto the twilight of her life, was the presence of her brother,\r\nwhom she loved. She loved him himself and his programme, she was\r\nfull of reverence for his articles; and when she was asked what her\r\nbrother was doing, she would answer in a subdued voice as though\r\nafraid of waking or distracting him: "He is writing. . . ." Usually\r\nwhen he was at his work she used to sit beside him, her eyes fixed\r\non his writing hand. She used at such moments to look like a sick\r\nanimal warming itself in the sun. . . .\r\n\r\nOne winter evening Vladimir Semyonitch was sitting at his table\r\nwriting a critical article for his newspaper: Vera Semyonovna was\r\nsitting beside him, staring as usual at his writing hand. The critic\r\nwrote rapidly, without erasures or corrections. The pen scratched\r\nand squeaked. On the table near the writing hand there lay open a\r\nfreshly-cut volume of a thick magazine, containing a story of peasant\r\nlife, signed with two initials. Vladimir Semyonitch was enthusiastic;\r\nhe thought the author was admirable in his handling of the subject,\r\nsuggested Turgenev in his descriptions of nature, was truthful, and\r\nhad an excellent knowledge of the life of the peasantry. The critic\r\nhimself knew nothing of peasant life except from books and hearsay,\r\nbut his feelings and his inner convictions forced him to believe\r\nthe story. He foretold a brilliant future for the author, assured\r\nhim he should await the conclusion of the story with great impatience,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n"Fine story!" he said, flinging himself back in his chair and closing\r\nhis eyes with pleasure. "The tone is extremely good."\r\n\r\nVera Semyonovna looked at him, yawned aloud, and suddenly asked an\r\nunexpected question. In the evening she had a habit of yawning\r\nnervously and asking short, abrupt questions, not always relevant.\r\n\r\n"Volodya," she asked, "what is the meaning of non-resistance to\r\nevil?"\r\n\r\n"Non-resistance to evil!" repeated her brother, opening his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes. What do you understand by it?"\r\n\r\n"You see, my dear, imagine that thieves or brigands attack you, and\r\nyou, instead of . . ."\r\n\r\n"No, give me a logical definition."\r\n\r\n"A logical definition? Um! Well." Vladimir Semyonitch pondered.\r\n"Non-resistance to evil means an attitude of non-interference with\r\nregard to all that in the sphere of mortality is called evil."\r\n\r\nSaying this, Vladimir Semyonitch bent over the table and took up a\r\nnovel. This novel, written by a woman, dealt with the painfulness\r\nof the irregular position of a society lady who was living under\r\nthe same roof with her lover and her illegitimate child. Vladimir\r\nSemyonitch was pleased with the excellent tendency of the story,\r\nthe plot and the presentation of it. Making a brief summary of the\r\nnovel, he selected the best passages and added to them in his\r\naccount: "How true to reality, how living, how picturesque! The\r\nauthor is not merely an artist; he is also a subtle psychologist\r\nwho can see into the hearts of his characters. Take, for example,\r\nthis vivid description of the emotions of the heroine on meeting\r\nher husband," and so on.\r\n\r\n"Volodya," Vera Semyonovna interrupted his critical effusions, "I\'ve\r\nbeen haunted by a strange idea since yesterday. I keep wondering\r\nwhere we should all be if human life were ordered on the basis of\r\nnon-resistance to evil?"\r\n\r\n"In all probability, nowhere. Non-resistance to evil would give the\r\nfull rein to the criminal will, and, to say nothing of civilisation,\r\nthis would leave not one stone standing upon another anywhere on\r\nearth."\r\n\r\n"What would be left?"\r\n\r\n"Bashi-Bazouke and brothels. In my next article I\'ll talk about\r\nthat perhaps. Thank you for reminding me."\r\n\r\nAnd a week later my friend kept his promise. That was just at the\r\nperiod--in the eighties--when people were beginning to talk and\r\nwrite of non-resistance, of the right to judge, to punish, to make\r\nwar; when some people in our set were beginning to do without\r\nservants, to retire into the country, to work on the land, and to\r\nrenounce animal food and carnal love.\r\n\r\nAfter reading her brother\'s article, Vera Semyonovna pondered and\r\nhardly perceptibly shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Very nice!" she said. "But still there\'s a great deal I don\'t\r\nunderstand. For instance, in Leskov\'s story \'Belonging to the\r\nCathedral\' there is a queer gardener who sows for the benefit of\r\nall--for customers, for beggars, and any who care to steal. Did\r\nhe behave sensibly?"\r\n\r\nFrom his sister\'s tone and expression Vladimir Semyonitch saw that\r\nshe did not like his article, and, almost for the first time in his\r\nlife, his vanity as an author sustained a shock. With a shade of\r\nirritation he answered:\r\n\r\n"Theft is immoral. To sow for thieves is to recognise the right of\r\nthieves to existence. What would you think if I were to establish\r\na newspaper and, dividing it into sections, provide for blackmailing\r\nas well as for liberal ideas? Following the example of that gardener,\r\nI ought, logically, to provide a section for blackmailers, the\r\nintellectual scoundrels? Yes."\r\n\r\nVera Semyonovna made no answer. She got up from the table, moved\r\nlanguidly to the sofa and lay down.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, I know nothing about it," she said musingly. "You\r\nare probably right, but it seems to me, I feel somehow, that there\'s\r\nsomething false in our resistance to evil, as though there were\r\nsomething concealed or unsaid. God knows, perhaps our methods of\r\nresisting evil belong to the category of prejudices which have\r\nbecome so deeply rooted in us, that we are incapable of parting\r\nwith them, and therefore cannot form a correct judgment of them."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how to explain to you. Perhaps man is mistaken in\r\nthinking that he is obliged to resist evil and has a right to do\r\nso, just as he is mistaken in thinking, for instance, that the heart\r\nlooks like an ace of hearts. It is very possible in resisting evil\r\nwe ought not to use force, but to use what is the very opposite of\r\nforce--if you, for instance, don\'t want this picture stolen from\r\nyou, you ought to give it away rather than lock it up. . . ."\r\n\r\n"That\'s clever, very clever! If I want to marry a rich, vulgar\r\nwoman, she ought to prevent me from such a shabby action by hastening\r\nto make me an offer herself!"\r\n\r\nThe brother and sister talked till midnight without understanding\r\neach other. If any outsider had overheard them he would hardly have\r\nbeen able to make out what either of them was driving at.\r\n\r\nThey usually spent the evening at home. There were no friends\'\r\nhouses to which they could go, and they felt no need for friends;\r\nthey only went to the theatre when there was a new play--such was\r\nthe custom in literary circles--they did not go to concerts, for\r\nthey did not care for music.\r\n\r\n"You may think what you like," Vera Semyonovna began again the next\r\nday, "but for me the question is to a great extent settled. I am\r\nfirmly convinced that I have no grounds for resisting evil directed\r\nagainst me personally. If they want to kill me, let them. My defending\r\nmyself will not make the murderer better. All I have now to decide\r\nis the second half of the question: how I ought to behave to evil\r\ndirected against my neighbours?"\r\n\r\n"Vera, mind you don\'t become rabid!" said Vladimir Semyonitch,\r\nlaughing. "I see non-resistance is becoming your _idee fixe_!"\r\n\r\nHe wanted to turn off these tedious conversations with a jest, but\r\nsomehow it was beyond a jest; his smile was artificial and sour.\r\nHis sister gave up sitting beside his table and gazing reverently\r\nat his writing hand, and he felt every evening that behind him on\r\nthe sofa lay a person who did not agree with him. And his back grew\r\nstiff and numb, and there was a chill in his soul. An author\'s\r\nvanity is vindictive, implacable, incapable of forgiveness, and his\r\nsister was the first and only person who had laid bare and disturbed\r\nthat uneasy feeling, which is like a big box of crockery, easy to\r\nunpack but impossible to pack up again as it was before.\r\n\r\nWeeks and months passed by, and his sister clung to her ideas, and\r\ndid not sit down by the table. One spring evening Vladimir Semyonitch\r\nwas sitting at his table writing an article. He was reviewing a\r\nnovel which described how a village schoolmistress refused the man\r\nwhom she loved and who loved her, a man both wealthy and intellectual,\r\nsimply because marriage made her work as a schoolmistress impossible.\r\nVera Semyonovna lay on the sofa and brooded.\r\n\r\n"My God, how slow it is!" she said, stretching. "How insipid and\r\nempty life is! I don\'t know what to do with myself, and you are\r\nwasting your best years in goodness knows what. Like some alchemist,\r\nyou are rummaging in old rubbish that nobody wants. My God!"\r\n\r\nVladimir Semyonitch dropped his pen and slowly looked round at his\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n"It\'s depressing to look at you!" said his sister. "Wagner in \'Faust\'\r\ndug up worms, but he was looking for a treasure, anyway, and you\r\nare looking for worms for the sake of the worms."\r\n\r\n"That\'s vague!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Volodya; all these days I\'ve been thinking, I\'ve been thinking\r\npainfully for a long time, and I have come to the conclusion that\r\nyou are hopelessly reactionary and conventional. Come, ask yourself\r\nwhat is the object of your zealous, conscientious work? Tell me,\r\nwhat is it? Why, everything has long ago been extracted that can\r\nbe extracted from that rubbish in which you are always rummaging.\r\nYou may pound water in a mortar and analyse it as long as you like,\r\nyou\'ll make nothing more of it than the chemists have made\r\nalready. . . ."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" drawled Vladimir Semyonitch, getting up. "Yes, all this\r\nis old rubbish because these ideas are eternal; but what do you\r\nconsider new, then?"\r\n\r\n"You undertake to work in the domain of thought; it is for you to\r\nthink of something new. It\'s not for me to teach you."\r\n\r\n"Me--an alchemist!" the critic cried in wonder and indignation,\r\nscrewing up his eyes ironically. "Art, progress--all that is\r\nalchemy?"\r\n\r\n"You see, Volodya, it seems to me that if all you thinking people\r\nhad set yourselves to solving great problems, all these little\r\nquestions that you fuss about now would solve themselves by the\r\nway. If you go up in a balloon to see a town, you will incidentally,\r\nwithout any effort, see the fields and the villages and the rivers\r\nas well. When stearine is manufactured, you get glycerine as a\r\nby-product. It seems to me that contemporary thought has settled\r\non one spot and stuck to it. It is prejudiced, apathetic, timid,\r\nafraid to take a wide titanic flight, just as you and I are afraid\r\nto climb on a high mountain; it is conservative."\r\n\r\nSuch conversations could not but leave traces. The relations of the\r\nbrother and sister grew more and more strained every day. The brother\r\nbecame unable to work in his sister\'s presence, and grew irritable\r\nwhen he knew his sister was lying on the sofa, looking at his back;\r\nwhile the sister frowned nervously and stretched when, trying to\r\nbring back the past, he attempted to share his enthusiasms with\r\nher. Every evening she complained of being bored, and talked about\r\nindependence of mind and those who are in the rut of tradition.\r\nCarried away by her new ideas, Vera Semyonovna proved that the work\r\nthat her brother was so engrossed in was conventional, that it was\r\na vain effort of conservative minds to preserve what had already\r\nserved its turn and was vanishing from the scene of action. She\r\nmade no end of comparisons. She compared her brother at one time\r\nto an alchemist, then to a musty old Believer who would sooner die\r\nthan listen to reason. By degrees there was a perceptible change\r\nin her manner of life, too. She was capable of lying on the sofa\r\nall day long doing nothing but think, while her face wore a cold,\r\ndry expression such as one sees in one-sided people of strong faith.\r\nShe began to refuse the attentions of the servants, swept and tidied\r\nher own room, cleaned her own boots and brushed her own clothes.\r\nHer brother could not help looking with irritation and even hatred\r\nat her cold face when she went about her menial work. In that work,\r\nwhich was always performed with a certain solemnity, he saw something\r\nstrained and false, he saw something both pharisaical and affected.\r\nAnd knowing he could not touch her by persuasion, he carped at her\r\nand teased her like a schoolboy.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t resist evil, but you resist my having servants!" he\r\ntaunted her. "If servants are an evil, why do you oppose it? That\'s\r\ninconsistent!"\r\n\r\nHe suffered, was indignant and even ashamed. He felt ashamed when\r\nhis sister began doing odd things before strangers.\r\n\r\n"It\'s awful, my dear fellow," he said to me in private, waving his\r\nhands in despair. "It seems that our _ingenue_ has remained to play\r\na part in the farce, too. She\'s become morbid to the marrow of her\r\nbones! I\'ve washed my hands of her, let her think as she likes; but\r\nwhy does she talk, why does she excite me? She ought to think what\r\nit means for me to listen to her. What I feel when in my presence\r\nshe has the effrontery to support her errors by blasphemously quoting\r\nthe teaching of Christ! It chokes me! It makes me hot all over to\r\nhear my sister propounding her doctrines and trying to distort the\r\nGospel to suit her, when she purposely refrains from mentioning how\r\nthe moneychangers were driven out of the Temple. That\'s, my dear\r\nfellow, what comes of being half educated, undeveloped! That\'s what\r\ncomes of medical studies which provide no general culture!"\r\n\r\nOne day on coming home from the office, Vladimir Semyonitch found\r\nhis sister crying. She was sitting on the sofa with her head bowed,\r\nwringing her hands, and tears were flowing freely down her cheeks.\r\nThe critic\'s good heart throbbed with pain. Tears fell from his\r\neyes, too, and he longed to pet his sister, to forgive her, to beg\r\nher forgiveness, and to live as they used to before. . . . He knelt\r\ndown and kissed her head, her hands, her shoulders. . . . She smiled,\r\nsmiled bitterly, unaccountably, while he with a cry of joy jumped\r\nup, seized the magazine from the table and said warmly:\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! We\'ll live as we used to, Verotchka! With God\'s blessing!\r\nAnd I\'ve such a surprise for you here! Instead of celebrating the\r\noccasion with champagne, let us read it together! A splendid,\r\nwonderful thing!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no!" cried Vera Semyonovna, pushing away the book in alarm.\r\n"I\'ve read it already! I don\'t want it, I don\'t want it!"\r\n\r\n"When did you read it?"\r\n\r\n"A year . . . two years ago. . . I read it long ago, and I know it,\r\nI know it!"\r\n\r\n"H\'m! . . . You\'re a fanatic!" her brother said coldly, flinging\r\nthe magazine on to the table.\r\n\r\n"No, you are a fanatic, not I! You!" And Vera Semyonovna dissolved\r\ninto tears again. Her brother stood before her, looked at her\r\nquivering shoulders, and thought. He thought, not of the agonies\r\nof loneliness endured by any one who begins to think in a new way\r\nof their own, not of the inevitable sufferings of a genuine spiritual\r\nrevolution, but of the outrage of his programme, the outrage to his\r\nauthor\'s vanity.\r\n\r\nFrom this time he treated his sister coldly, with careless irony,\r\nand he endured her presence in the room as one endures the presence\r\nof old women that are dependent on one. For her part, she left off\r\ndisputing with him and met all his arguments, jeers, and attacks\r\nwith a condescending silence which irritated him more than ever.\r\n\r\nOne summer morning Vera Semyonovna, dressed for travelling with a\r\nsatchel over her shoulder, went in to her brother and coldly kissed\r\nhim on the forehead.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" he asked with surprise.\r\n\r\n"To the province of N. to do vaccination work." Her brother went\r\nout into the street with her.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s what you\'ve decided upon, you queer girl," he muttered.\r\n"Don\'t you want some money?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you. Good-bye."\r\n\r\nThe sister shook her brother\'s hand and set off.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you have a cab?" cried Vladimir Semyonitch.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. Her brother gazed after her, watched her\r\nrusty-looking waterproof, the swaying of her figure as she slouched\r\nalong, forced himself to sigh, but did not succeed in rousing a\r\nfeeling of regret. His sister had become a stranger to him. And he\r\nwas a stranger to her. Anyway, she did not once look round.\r\n\r\nGoing back to his room, Vladimir Semyonitch at once sat down to the\r\ntable and began to work at his article.\r\n\r\nI never saw Vera Semyonovna again. Where she is now I do not know.\r\nAnd Vladimir Semyonitch went on writing his articles, laying wreaths\r\non coffins, singing _Gaudeamus_, busying himself over the Mutual\r\nAid Society of Moscow Journalists.\r\n\r\nHe fell ill with inflammation of the lungs; he was ill in bed for\r\nthree months--at first at home, and afterwards in the Golitsyn\r\nHospital. An abscess developed in his knee. People said he ought\r\nto be sent to the Crimea, and began getting up a collection for\r\nhim. But he did not go to the Crimea--he died. We buried him in\r\nthe Vagankovsky Cemetery, on the left side, where artists and\r\nliterary men are buried.\r\n\r\nOne day we writers were sitting in the Tatars\' restaurant. I mentioned\r\nthat I had lately been in the Vagankovsky Cemetery and had seen\r\nVladimir Semyonitch\'s grave there. It was utterly neglected and\r\nalmost indistinguishable from the rest of the ground, the cross had\r\nfallen; it was necessary to collect a few roubles to put it in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nBut they listened to what I said unconcernedly, made no answer, and\r\nI could not collect a farthing. No one remembered Vladimir Semyonitch.\r\nHe was utterly forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRE\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nGRACEFULLY swaying in the saddle, a young man wearing the snow-white\r\ntunic of an officer rode into the great yard of the vodka distillery\r\nbelonging to the heirs of M. E. Rothstein. The sun smiled carelessly\r\non the lieutenant\'s little stars, on the white trunks of the\r\nbirch-trees, on the heaps of broken glass scattered here and there\r\nin the yard. The radiant, vigorous beauty of a summer day lay over\r\neverything, and nothing hindered the snappy young green leaves from\r\ndancing gaily and winking at the clear blue sky. Even the dirty and\r\nsoot-begrimed appearance of the bricksheds and the stifling fumes\r\nof the distillery did not spoil the general good impression. The\r\nlieutenant sprang gaily out of the saddle, handed over his horse\r\nto a man who ran up, and stroking with his finger his delicate black\r\nmoustaches, went in at the front door. On the top step of the old\r\nbut light and softly carpeted staircase he was met by a maidservant\r\nwith a haughty, not very youthful face. The lieutenant gave her his\r\ncard without speaking.\r\n\r\nAs she went through the rooms with the card, the maid could see on\r\nit the name "Alexandr Grigoryevitch Sokolsky." A minute later she\r\ncame back and told the lieutenant that her mistress could not see\r\nhim, as she was not feeling quite well. Sokolsky looked at the\r\nceiling and thrust out his lower lip.\r\n\r\n"How vexatious!" he said. "Listen, my dear," he said eagerly. "Go\r\nand tell Susanna Moiseyevna, that it is very necessary for me to\r\nspeak to her--very. I will only keep her one minute. Ask her to\r\nexcuse me."\r\n\r\nThe maid shrugged one shoulder and went off languidly to her mistress.\r\n\r\n"Very well!" she sighed, returning after a brief interval. "Please\r\nwalk in!"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant went with her through five or six large, luxuriously\r\nfurnished rooms and a corridor, and finally found himself in a large\r\nand lofty square room, in which from the first step he was impressed\r\nby the abundance of flowers and plants and the sweet, almost\r\nrevoltingly heavy fragrance of jasmine. Flowers were trained to\r\ntrellis-work along the walls, screening the windows, hung from the\r\nceiling, and were wreathed over the corners, so that the room was\r\nmore like a greenhouse than a place to live in. Tits, canaries, and\r\ngoldfinches chirruped among the green leaves and fluttered against\r\nthe window-panes.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me for receiving you here," the lieutenant heard in a\r\nmellow feminine voice with a burr on the letter _r_ which was not\r\nwithout charm. "Yesterday I had a sick headache, and I\'m trying to\r\nkeep still to prevent its coming on again. What do you want?"\r\n\r\nExactly opposite the entrance, he saw sitting in a big low chair,\r\nsuch as old men use, a woman in an expensive Chinese dressing-gown,\r\nwith her head wrapped up, leaning back on a pillow. Nothing could\r\nbe seen behind the woollen shawl in which she was muffled but a\r\npale, long, pointed, somewhat aquiline nose, and one large dark\r\neye. Her ample dressing-gown concealed her figure, but judging from\r\nher beautiful hand, from her voice, her nose, and her eye, she might\r\nbe twenty-six or twenty-eight.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me for being so persistent . . ." began the lieutenant,\r\nclinking his spurs. "Allow me to introduce myself: Sokolsky! I come\r\nwith a message from my cousin, your neighbour, Alexey Ivanovitch\r\nKryukov, who . . ."\r\n\r\n"I know!" interposed Susanna Moiseyevna. "I know Kryukov. Sit down;\r\nI don\'t like anything big standing before me."\r\n\r\n"My cousin charges me to ask you a favour," the lieutenant went on,\r\nclinking his spurs once more and sitting down. "The fact is, your\r\nlate father made a purchase of oats from my cousin last winter, and\r\na small sum was left owing. The payment only becomes due next week,\r\nbut my cousin begs you most particularly to pay him--if possible,\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\nAs the lieutenant talked, he stole side-glances about him.\r\n\r\n"Surely I\'m not in her bedroom?" he thought.\r\n\r\nIn one corner of the room, where the foliage was thickest and\r\ntallest, under a pink awning like a funeral canopy, stood a bed not\r\nyet made, with the bedclothes still in disorder. Close by on two\r\narm-chairs lay heaps of crumpled feminine garments. Petticoats and\r\nsleeves with rumpled lace and flounces were trailing on the carpet,\r\non which here and there lay bits of white tape, cigarette-ends, and\r\nthe papers of caramels. . . . Under the bed the toes, pointed and\r\nsquare, of slippers of all kinds peeped out in a long row. And it\r\nseemed to the lieutenant that the scent of the jasmine came not\r\nfrom the flowers, but from the bed and the slippers.\r\n\r\n"And what is the sum owing?" asked Susanna Moiseyevna.\r\n\r\n"Two thousand three hundred."\r\n\r\n"Oho!" said the Jewess, showing another large black eye. "And you\r\ncall that--a small sum! However, it\'s just the same paying it\r\nto-day or paying it in a week, but I\'ve had so many payments to\r\nmake in the last two months since my father\'s death. . . . Such a\r\nlot of stupid business, it makes my head go round! A nice idea! I\r\nwant to go abroad, and they keep forcing me to attend to these silly\r\nthings. Vodka, oats . . ." she muttered, half closing her eyes,\r\n"oats, bills, percentages, or, as my head-clerk says, \'percentage.\'\r\n. . . It\'s awful. Yesterday I simply turned the excise officer out.\r\nHe pesters me with his Tralles. I said to him: \'Go to the devil\r\nwith your Tralles! I can\'t see any one!\' He kissed my hand and went\r\naway. I tell you what: can\'t your cousin wait two or three months?"\r\n\r\n"A cruel question!" laughed the lieutenant. "My cousin can wait a\r\nyear, but it\'s I who cannot wait! You see, it\'s on my own account\r\nI\'m acting, I ought to tell you. At all costs I must have money,\r\nand by ill-luck my cousin hasn\'t a rouble to spare. I\'m forced to\r\nride about and collect debts. I\'ve just been to see a peasant, our\r\ntenant; here I\'m now calling on you; from here I shall go on to\r\nsomewhere else, and keep on like that until I get together five\r\nthousand roubles. I need money awfully!"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! What does a young man want with money? Whims, mischief.\r\nWhy, have you been going in for dissipation? Or losing at cards?\r\nOr are you getting married?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve guessed!" laughed the lieutenant, and rising slightly from\r\nhis seat, he clinked his spurs. "I really am going to be married."\r\n\r\nSusanna Moiseyevna looked intently at her visitor, made a wry face,\r\nand sighed.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t make out what possesses people to get married!" she said,\r\nlooking about her for her pocket-handkerchief. "Life is so short,\r\none has so little freedom, and they must put chains on themselves!"\r\n\r\n"Every one has his own way of looking at things. . . ."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, of course; every one has his own way of looking at things\r\n. . . . But, I say, are you really going to marry some one poor? Are\r\nyou passionately in love? And why must you have five thousand? Why\r\nwon\'t four do, or three?"\r\n\r\n"What a tongue she has!" thought the lieutenant, and answered: "The\r\ndifficulty is that an officer is not allowed by law to marry till\r\nhe is twenty-eight; if you choose to marry, you have to leave the\r\nService or else pay a deposit of five thousand."\r\n\r\n"Ah, now I understand. Listen. You said just now that every one has\r\nhis own way of looking at things. . . . Perhaps your fiancee is\r\nsome one special and remarkable, but . . . but I am utterly unable\r\nto understand how any decent man can live with a woman. I can\'t for\r\nthe life of me understand it. I have lived, thank the Lord,\r\ntwenty-seven years, and I have never yet seen an endurable woman.\r\nThey\'re all affected minxes, immoral, liars. . . . The only ones I\r\ncan put up with are cooks and housemaids, but so-called ladies I\r\nwon\'t let come within shooting distance of me. But, thank God, they\r\nhate me and don\'t force themselves on me! If one of them wants money\r\nshe sends her husband, but nothing will induce her to come herself,\r\nnot from pride--no, but from cowardice; she\'s afraid of my making\r\na scene. Oh, I understand their hatred very well! Rather! I openly\r\ndisplay what they do their very utmost to conceal from God and man.\r\nHow can they help hating me? No doubt you\'ve heard bushels of scandal\r\nabout me already. . . ."\r\n\r\n"I only arrived here so lately . . ."\r\n\r\n"Tut, tut, tut! . . . I see from your eyes! But your brother\'s wife,\r\nsurely she primed you for this expedition? Think of letting a young\r\nman come to see such an awful woman without warning him--how could\r\nshe? Ha, ha! . . . But tell me, how is your brother? He\'s a fine\r\nfellow, such a handsome man! . . . I\'ve seen him several times at\r\nmass. Why do you look at me like that? I very often go to church!\r\nWe all have the same God. To an educated person externals matter\r\nless than the idea. . . . That\'s so, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course . . ." smiled the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the idea. . . . But you are not a bit like your brother. You\r\nare handsome, too, but your brother is a great deal better-looking.\r\nThere\'s wonderfully little likeness!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite natural; he\'s not my brother, but my cousin."\r\n\r\n"Ah, to be sure! So you must have the money to-day? Why to-day?"\r\n\r\n"My furlough is over in a few days."\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s to be done with you!" sighed Susanna Moiseyevna. "So\r\nbe it. I\'ll give you the money, though I know you\'ll abuse me for\r\nit afterwards. You\'ll quarrel with your wife after you are married,\r\nand say: \'If that mangy Jewess hadn\'t given me the money, I should\r\nperhaps have been as free as a bird to-day!\' Is your fiancee pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. . . ."\r\n\r\n"H\'m! . . . Anyway, better something, if it\'s only beauty, than\r\nnothing. Though however beautiful a woman is, it can never make up\r\nto her husband for her silliness."\r\n\r\n"That\'s original!" laughed the lieutenant. "You are a woman yourself,\r\nand such a woman-hater!"\r\n\r\n"A woman . . ." smiled Susanna. "It\'s not my fault that God has\r\ncast me into this mould, is it? I\'m no more to blame for it than\r\nyou are for having moustaches. The violin is not responsible for\r\nthe choice of its case. I am very fond of myself, but when any one\r\nreminds me that I am a woman, I begin to hate myself. Well, you can\r\ngo away, and I\'ll dress. Wait for me in the drawing-room."\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant went out, and the first thing he did was to draw a\r\ndeep breath, to get rid of the heavy scent of jasmine, which had\r\nbegun to irritate his throat and to make him feel giddy.\r\n\r\n"What a strange woman!" he thought, looking about him. "She talks\r\nfluently, but . . . far too much, and too freely. She must be\r\nneurotic."\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room, in which he was standing now, was richly furnished,\r\nand had pretensions to luxury and style. There were dark bronze\r\ndishes with patterns in relief, views of Nice and the Rhine on the\r\ntables, old-fashioned sconces, Japanese statuettes, but all this\r\nstriving after luxury and style only emphasised the lack of taste\r\nwhich was glaringly apparent in the gilt cornices, the gaudy\r\nwall-paper, the bright velvet table-cloths, the common oleographs\r\nin heavy frames. The bad taste of the general effect was the more\r\ncomplete from the lack of finish and the overcrowding of the room,\r\nwhich gave one a feeling that something was lacking, and that a\r\ngreat deal should have been thrown away. It was evident that the\r\nfurniture had not been bought all at once, but had been picked up\r\nat auctions and other favourable opportunities.\r\n\r\nHeaven knows what taste the lieutenant could boast of, but even he\r\nnoticed one characteristic peculiarity about the whole place, which\r\nno luxury or style could efface--a complete absence of all trace\r\nof womanly, careful hands, which, as we all know, give a warmth,\r\npoetry, and snugness to the furnishing of a room. There was a\r\nchilliness about it such as one finds in waiting-rooms at stations,\r\nin clubs, and foyers at the theatres.\r\n\r\nThere was scarcely anything in the room definitely Jewish, except,\r\nperhaps, a big picture of the meeting of Jacob and Esau. The\r\nlieutenant looked round about him, and, shrugging his shoulders,\r\nthought of his strange, new acquaintance, of her free-and-easy\r\nmanners, and her way of talking. But then the door opened, and in\r\nthe doorway appeared the lady herself, in a long black dress, so\r\nslim and tightly laced that her figure looked as though it had been\r\nturned in a lathe. Now the lieutenant saw not only the nose and\r\neyes, but also a thin white face, a head black and as curly as\r\nlamb\'s-wool. She did not attract him, though she did not strike him\r\nas ugly. He had a prejudice against un-Russian faces in general,\r\nand he considered, too, that the lady\'s white face, the whiteness\r\nof which for some reason suggested the cloying scent of jasmine,\r\ndid not go well with her little black curls and thick eyebrows;\r\nthat her nose and ears were astoundingly white, as though they\r\nbelonged to a corpse, or had been moulded out of transparent wax.\r\nWhen she smiled she showed pale gums as well as her teeth, and he\r\ndid not like that either.\r\n\r\n"Anaemic debility . . ." he thought; "she\'s probably as nervous as\r\na turkey."\r\n\r\n"Here I am! Come along!" she said, going on rapidly ahead of him\r\nand pulling off the yellow leaves from the plants as she passed.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you the money directly, and if you like I\'ll give you\r\nsome lunch. Two thousand three hundred roubles! After such a good\r\nstroke of business you\'ll have an appetite for your lunch. Do you\r\nlike my rooms? The ladies about here declare that my rooms always\r\nsmell of garlic. With that culinary gibe their stock of wit is\r\nexhausted. I hasten to assure you that I\'ve no garlic even in the\r\ncellar. And one day when a doctor came to see me who smelt of garlic,\r\nI asked him to take his hat and go and spread his fragrance elsewhere.\r\nThere is no smell of garlic here, but the place does smell of drugs.\r\nMy father lay paralyzed for a year and a half, and the whole house\r\nsmelt of medicine. A year and a half! I was sorry to lose him, but\r\nI\'m glad he\'s dead: he suffered so!"\r\n\r\nShe led the officer through two rooms similar to the drawing-room,\r\nthrough a large reception hall, and came to a stop in her study,\r\nwhere there was a lady\'s writing-table covered with little knick-knacks.\r\nOn the carpet near it several books lay strewn about, opened and\r\nfolded back. Through a small door leading from the study he saw a\r\ntable laid for lunch.\r\n\r\nStill chatting, Susanna took out of her pocket a bunch of little\r\nkeys and unlocked an ingeniously made cupboard with a curved, sloping\r\nlid. When the lid was raised the cupboard emitted a plaintive note\r\nwhich made the lieutenant think of an AEolian harp. Susanna picked\r\nout another key and clicked another lock.\r\n\r\n"I have underground passages here and secret doors," she said,\r\ntaking out a small morocco portfolio. "It\'s a funny cupboard, isn\'t\r\nit? And in this portfolio I have a quarter of my fortune. Look how\r\npodgy it is! You won\'t strangle me, will you?"\r\n\r\nSusanna raised her eyes to the lieutenant and laughed good-naturedly.\r\nThe lieutenant laughed too.\r\n\r\n"She\'s rather jolly," he thought, watching the keys flashing between\r\nher fingers.\r\n\r\n"Here it is," she said, picking out the key of the portfolio. "Now,\r\nMr. Creditor, trot out the IOU. What a silly thing money is really!\r\nHow paltry it is, and yet how women love it! I am a Jewess, you\r\nknow, to the marrow of my bones. I am passionately fond of Shmuls\r\nand Yankels, but how I loathe that passion for gain in our Semitic\r\nblood. They hoard and they don\'t know what they are hoarding for.\r\nOne ought to live and enjoy oneself, but they\'re afraid of spending\r\nan extra farthing. In that way I am more like an hussar than a\r\nShmul. I don\'t like money to be kept long in one place. And altogether\r\nI fancy I\'m not much like a Jewess. Does my accent give me away\r\nmuch, eh?"\r\n\r\n"What shall I say?" mumbled the lieutenant. "You speak good Russian,\r\nbut you do roll your _r\'s_."\r\n\r\nSusanna laughed and put the little key in the lock of the portfolio.\r\nThe lieutenant took out of his pocket a little roll of IOUs and\r\nlaid them with a notebook on the table.\r\n\r\n"Nothing betrays a Jew as much as his accent," Susanna went on,\r\nlooking gaily at the lieutenant. "However much he twists himself\r\ninto a Russian or a Frenchman, ask him to say \'feather\' and he will\r\nsay \'fedder\' . . . but I pronounce it correctly: \'Feather! feather!\r\nfeather!\'"\r\n\r\nBoth laughed.\r\n\r\n"By Jove, she\'s very jolly!" thought Sokolsky.\r\n\r\nSusanna put the portfolio on a chair, took a step towards the\r\nlieutenant, and bringing her face close to his, went on gaily:\r\n\r\n"Next to the Jews I love no people so much as the Russian and the\r\nFrench. I did not do much at school and I know no history, but it\r\nseems to me that the fate of the world lies in the hands of those\r\ntwo nations. I lived a long time abroad. . . . I spent six months\r\nin Madrid. . . . I\'ve gazed my fill at the public, and the conclusion\r\nI\'ve come to is that there are no decent peoples except the Russian\r\nand the French. Take the languages, for instance. . . . The German\r\nlanguage is like the neighing of horses; as for the English . . .\r\nyou can\'t imagine anything stupider. Fight--feet--foot! Italian\r\nis only pleasant when they speak it slowly. If you listen to Italians\r\ngabbling, you get the effect of the Jewish jargon. And the Poles?\r\nMercy on us! There\'s no language so disgusting! \'Nie pieprz, Pietrze,\r\npieprzem wieprza bo mozeoz przepieprzye wieprza pieprzem.\' That\r\nmeans: \'Don\'t pepper a sucking pig with pepper, Pyotr, or perhaps\r\nyou\'ll over-pepper the sucking pig with pepper.\' Ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nSusanna Moiseyevna rolled her eyes and broke into such a pleasant,\r\ninfectious laugh that the lieutenant, looking at her, went off into\r\na loud and merry peal of laughter. She took the visitor by the\r\nbutton, and went on:\r\n\r\n"You don\'t like Jews, of course . . . they\'ve many faults, like all\r\nnations. I don\'t dispute that. But are the Jews to blame for it?\r\nNo, it\'s not the Jews who are to blame, but the Jewish women! They\r\nare narrow-minded, greedy; there\'s no sort of poetry about them,\r\nthey\'re dull. . . . You have never lived with a Jewess, so you don\'t\r\nknow how charming it is!" Susanna Moiseyevna pronounced the last\r\nwords with deliberate emphasis and with no eagerness or laughter.\r\nShe paused as though frightened at her own openness, and her face\r\nwas suddenly distorted in a strange, unaccountable way. Her eyes\r\nstared at the lieutenant without blinking, her lips parted and\r\nshowed clenched teeth. Her whole face, her throat, and even her\r\nbosom, seemed quivering with a spiteful, catlike expression. Still\r\nkeeping her eyes fixed on her visitor, she rapidly bent to one side,\r\nand swiftly, like a cat, snatched something from the table. All\r\nthis was the work of a few seconds. Watching her movements, the\r\nlieutenant saw five fingers crumple up his IOUs and caught a glimpse\r\nof the white rustling paper as it disappeared in her clenched fist.\r\nSuch an extraordinary transition from good-natured laughter to crime\r\nso appalled him that he turned pale and stepped back. . . .\r\n\r\nAnd she, still keeping her frightened, searching eyes upon him,\r\nfelt along her hip with her clenched fist for her pocket. Her fist\r\nstruggled convulsively for the pocket, like a fish in the net, and\r\ncould not find the opening. In another moment the IOUs would have\r\nvanished in the recesses of her feminine garments, but at that point\r\nthe lieutenant uttered a faint cry, and, moved more by instinct\r\nthan reflection, seized the Jewess by her arm above the clenched\r\nfist. Showing her teeth more than ever, she struggled with all her\r\nmight and pulled her hand away. Then Sokolsky put his right arm\r\nfirmly round her waist, and the other round her chest and a struggle\r\nfollowed. Afraid of outraging her sex or hurting her, he tried only\r\nto prevent her moving, and to get hold of the fist with the IOUs;\r\nbut she wriggled like an eel in his arms with her supple, flexible\r\nbody, struck him in the chest with her elbows, and scratched him,\r\nso that he could not help touching her all over, and was forced to\r\nhurt her and disregard her modesty.\r\n\r\n"How unusual this is! How strange!" he thought, utterly amazed,\r\nhardly able to believe his senses, and feeling rather sick from the\r\nscent of jasmine.\r\n\r\nIn silence, breathing heavily, stumbling against the furniture,\r\nthey moved about the room. Susanna was carried away by the struggle.\r\nShe flushed, closed her eyes, and forgetting herself, once even\r\npressed her face against the face of the lieutenant, so that there\r\nwas a sweetish taste left on his lips. At last he caught hold of\r\nher clenched hand. . . . Forcing it open, and not finding the papers\r\nin it, he let go the Jewess. With flushed faces and dishevelled\r\nhair, they looked at one another, breathing hard. The spiteful,\r\ncatlike expression on the Jewess\'s face was gradually replaced by\r\na good-natured smile. She burst out laughing, and turning on one\r\nfoot, went towards the room where lunch was ready. The lieutenant\r\nmoved slowly after her. She sat down to the table, and, still flushed\r\nand breathing hard, tossed off half a glass of port.\r\n\r\n"Listen"--the lieutenant broke the silence--"I hope you are\r\njoking?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it," she answered, thrusting a piece of bread into\r\nher mouth.\r\n\r\n"H\'m! . . . How do you wish me to take all this?"\r\n\r\n"As you choose. Sit down and have lunch!"\r\n\r\n"But . . . it\'s dishonest!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps. But don\'t trouble to give me a sermon; I have my own way\r\nof looking at things."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you give them back?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not! If you were a poor unfortunate man, with nothing\r\nto eat, then it would be a different matter. But--he wants to get\r\nmarried!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not my money, you know; it\'s my cousin\'s!"\r\n\r\n"And what does your cousin want with money? To get fashionable\r\nclothes for his wife? But I really don\'t care whether your _belle-soeur_\r\nhas dresses or not."\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant had ceased to remember that he was in a strange house\r\nwith an unknown lady, and did not trouble himself with decorum. He\r\nstrode up and down the room, scowled and nervously fingered his\r\nwaistcoat. The fact that the Jewess had lowered herself in his eyes\r\nby her dishonest action, made him feel bolder and more free-and-easy.\r\n\r\n"The devil knows what to make of it!" he muttered. "Listen. I shan\'t\r\ngo away from here until I get the IOUs!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, so much the better," laughed Susanna. "If you stay here for\r\ngood, it will make it livelier for me."\r\n\r\nExcited by the struggle, the lieutenant looked at Susanna\'s laughing,\r\ninsolent face, at her munching mouth, at her heaving bosom, and\r\ngrew bolder and more audacious. Instead of thinking about the IOU\r\nhe began for some reason recalling with a sort of relish his cousin\'s\r\nstories of the Jewess\'s romantic adventures, of her free way of\r\nlife, and these reminiscences only provoked him to greater audacity.\r\nImpulsively he sat down beside the Jewess and thinking no more of\r\nthe IOUs began to eat. . . .\r\n\r\n"Will you have vodka or wine?" Susanna asked with a laugh. "So you\r\nwill stay till you get the IOUs? Poor fellow! How many days and\r\nnights you will have to spend with me, waiting for those IOUs! Won\'t\r\nyour fiancee have something to say about it?"\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nFive hours had passed. The lieutenant\'s cousin, Alexey Ivanovitch\r\nKryukov was walking about the rooms of his country-house in his\r\ndressing-gown and slippers, and looking impatiently out of window.\r\nHe was a tall, sturdy man, with a large black beard and a manly\r\nface; and as the Jewess had truly said, he was handsome, though he\r\nhad reached the age when men are apt to grow too stout, puffy, and\r\nbald. By mind and temperament he was one of those natures in which\r\nthe Russian intellectual classes are so rich: warm-hearted,\r\ngood-natured, well-bred, having some knowledge of the arts and\r\nsciences, some faith, and the most chivalrous notions about honour,\r\nbut indolent and lacking in depth. He was fond of good eating and\r\ndrinking, was an ideal whist-player, was a connoisseur in women and\r\nhorses, but in other things he was apathetic and sluggish as a seal,\r\nand to rouse him from his lethargy something extraordinary and quite\r\nrevolting was needed, and then he would forget everything in the\r\nworld and display intense activity; he would fume and talk of a\r\nduel, write a petition of seven pages to a Minister, gallop at\r\nbreakneck speed about the district, call some one publicly "a\r\nscoundrel," would go to law, and so on.\r\n\r\n"How is it our Sasha\'s not back yet?" he kept asking his wife,\r\nglancing out of window. "Why, it\'s dinner-time!"\r\n\r\nAfter waiting for the lieutenant till six o\'clock, they sat down\r\nto dinner. When supper-time came, however, Alexey Ivanovitch was\r\nlistening to every footstep, to every sound of the door, and kept\r\nshrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Strange!" he said. "The rascally dandy must have stayed on at the\r\ntenant\'s."\r\n\r\nAs he went to bed after supper, Kryukov made up his mind that the\r\nlieutenant was being entertained at the tenant\'s, where after a\r\nfestive evening he was staying the night.\r\n\r\nAlexandr Grigoryevitch only returned next morning. He looked extremely\r\ncrumpled and confused.\r\n\r\n"I want to speak to you alone . . ." he said mysteriously to his\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\nThey went into the study. The lieutenant shut the door, and he paced\r\nfor a long time up and down before he began to speak.\r\n\r\n"Something\'s happened, my dear fellow," he began, "that I don\'t\r\nknow how to tell you about. You wouldn\'t believe it . . ."\r\n\r\nAnd blushing, faltering, not looking at his cousin, he told what\r\nhad happened with the IOUs. Kryukov, standing with his feet wide\r\napart and his head bent, listened and frowned.\r\n\r\n"Are you joking?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"How the devil could I be joking? It\'s no joking matter!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand!" muttered Kryukov, turning crimson and flinging\r\nup his hands. "It\'s positively . . . immoral on your part. Before\r\nyour very eyes a hussy is up to the devil knows what, a serious\r\ncrime, plays a nasty trick, and you go and kiss her!"\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t understand myself how it happened!" whispered the\r\nlieutenant, blinking guiltily. "Upon my honour, I don\'t understand\r\nit! It\'s the first time in my life I\'ve come across such a monster!\r\nIt\'s not her beauty that does for you, not her mind, but that . . .\r\nyou understand . . . insolence, cynicism. . . ."\r\n\r\n"Insolence, cynicism . . . it\'s unclean! If you\'ve such a longing\r\nfor insolence and cynicism, you might have picked a sow out of the\r\nmire and have devoured her alive. It would have been cheaper, anyway!\r\nInstead of two thousand three hundred!"\r\n\r\n"You do express yourself elegantly!" said the lieutenant, frowning.\r\n"I\'ll pay you back the two thousand three hundred!"\r\n\r\n"I know you\'ll pay it back, but it\'s not a question of money! Damn\r\nthe money! What revolts me is your being such a limp rag . . . such\r\nfilthy feebleness! And engaged! With a fiancee!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak of it . . ." said the lieutenant, blushing. "I loathe\r\nmyself as it is. I should like to sink into the earth. It\'s sickening\r\nand vexatious that I shall have to bother my aunt for that five\r\nthousand. . . ."\r\n\r\nKryukov continued for some time longer expressing his indignation\r\nand grumbling, then, as he grew calmer, he sat down on the sofa and\r\nbegan to jeer at his cousin.\r\n\r\n"You young officers!" he said with contemptuous irony. "Nice\r\nbridegrooms."\r\n\r\nSuddenly he leapt up as though he had been stung, stamped his foot,\r\nand ran about the study.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not going to leave it like that!" he said, shaking his\r\nfist. "I will have those IOUs, I will! I\'ll give it her! One doesn\'t\r\nbeat women, but I\'ll break every bone in her body. . . . I\'ll pound\r\nher to a jelly! I\'m not a lieutenant! You won\'t touch me with\r\ninsolence or cynicism! No-o-o, damn her! Mishka!" he shouted, "run\r\nand tell them to get the racing droshky out for me!"\r\n\r\nKryukov dressed rapidly, and, without heeding the agitated lieutenant,\r\ngot into the droshky, and with a wave of his hand resolutely raced\r\noff to Susanna Moiseyevna. For a long time the lieutenant gazed out\r\nof window at the clouds of dust that rolled after his cousin\'s\r\ndroshky, stretched, yawned, and went to his own room. A quarter of\r\nan hour later he was sound asleep.\r\n\r\nAt six o\'clock he was waked up and summoned to dinner.\r\n\r\n"How nice this is of Alexey!" his cousin\'s wife greeted him in the\r\ndining-room. "He keeps us waiting for dinner."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say he\'s not come back yet?" yawned the lieutenant.\r\n"H\'m! . . . he\'s probably gone round to see the tenant."\r\n\r\nBut Alexey Ivanovitch was not back by supper either. His wife and\r\nSokolsky decided that he was playing cards at the tenant\'s and would\r\nmost likely stay the night there. What had happened was not what\r\nthey had supposed, however.\r\n\r\nKryukov returned next morning, and without greeting any one, without\r\na word, dashed into his study.\r\n\r\n"Well?" whispered the lieutenant, gazing at him round-eyed.\r\n\r\nKryukov waved his hand and gave a snort.\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s the matter? What are you laughing at?"\r\n\r\nKryukov flopped on the sofa, thrust his head in the pillow, and\r\nshook with suppressed laughter. A minute later he got up, and looking\r\nat the surprised lieutenant, with his eyes full of tears from\r\nlaughing, said:\r\n\r\n"Close the door. Well . . . she _is_ a fe-e-male, I beg to inform\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"Did you get the IOUs?"\r\n\r\nKryukov waved his hand and went off into a peal of laughter again.\r\n\r\n"Well! she is a female!" he went on. "_Merci_ for the acquaintance,\r\nmy boy! She\'s a devil in petticoats. I arrived; I walked in like\r\nsuch an avenging Jove, you know, that I felt almost afraid of myself\r\n. . . . I frowned, I scowled, even clenched my fists to be more\r\nawe-inspiring. . . . \'Jokes don\'t pay with me, madam!\' said I, and\r\nmore in that style. And I threatened her with the law and with the\r\nGovernor. To begin with she burst into tears, said she\'d been joking\r\nwith you, and even took me to the cupboard to give me the money.\r\nThen she began arguing that the future of Europe lies in the hands\r\nof the French, and the Russians, swore at women. . . . Like you, I\r\nlistened, fascinated, ass that I was. . . . She kept singing the\r\npraises of my beauty, patted me on the arm near the shoulder, to\r\nsee how strong I was, and . . . and as you see, I\'ve only just got\r\naway from her! Ha, ha! She\'s enthusiastic about you!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a nice fellow!" laughed the lieutenant. "A married man!\r\nhighly respected. . . . Well, aren\'t you ashamed? Disgusted? Joking\r\napart though, old man, you\'ve got your Queen Tamara in your own\r\nneighbourhood. . . ."\r\n\r\n"In my own neighbourhood! Why, you wouldn\'t find another such\r\nchameleon in the whole of Russia! I\'ve never seen anything like it\r\nin my life, though I know a good bit about women, too. I have known\r\nregular devils in my time, but I never met anything like this. It\r\nis, as you say, by insolence and cynicism she gets over you. What\r\nis so attractive in her is the diabolical suddenness, the quick\r\ntransitions, the swift shifting hues. . . . Brrr! And the IOU--\r\nphew! Write it off for lost. We are both great sinners, we\'ll go\r\nhalves in our sin. I shall put down to you not two thousand three\r\nhundred, but half of it. Mind, tell my wife I was at the tenant\'s."\r\n\r\nKryukov and the lieutenant buried their heads in the pillows, and\r\nbroke into laughter; they raised their heads, glanced at one another,\r\nand again subsided into their pillows.\r\n\r\n"Engaged! A lieutenant!" Kryukov jeered.\r\n\r\n"Married!" retorted Sokolsky. "Highly respected! Father of a family!"\r\n\r\nAt dinner they talked in veiled allusions, winked at one another,\r\nand, to the surprise of the others, were continually gushing with\r\nlaughter into their dinner-napkins. After dinner, still in the best\r\nof spirits, they dressed up as Turks, and, running after one another\r\nwith guns, played at soldiers with the children. In the evening\r\nthey had a long argument. The lieutenant maintained that it was\r\nmean and contemptible to accept a dowry with your wife, even when\r\nthere was passionate love on both sides. Kryukov thumped the table\r\nwith his fists and declared that this was absurd, and that a husband\r\nwho did not like his wife to have property of her own was an egoist\r\nand a despot. Both shouted, boiled over, did not understand each\r\nother, drank a good deal, and in the end, picking up the skirts of\r\ntheir dressing-gowns, went to their bedrooms. They soon fell asleep\r\nand slept soundly.\r\n\r\nLife went on as before, even, sluggish and free from sorrow. The\r\nshadows lay on the earth, thunder pealed from the clouds, from time\r\nto time the wind moaned plaintively, as though to prove that nature,\r\ntoo, could lament, but nothing troubled the habitual tranquillity\r\nof these people. Of Susanna Moiseyevna and the IOUs they said\r\nnothing. Both of them felt, somehow, ashamed to speak of the incident\r\naloud. Yet they remembered it and thought of it with pleasure, as\r\nof a curious farce, which life had unexpectedly and casually played\r\nupon them, and which it would be pleasant to recall in old age.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth or seventh day after his visit to the Jewess, Kryukov\r\nwas sitting in his study in the morning writing a congratulatory\r\nletter to his aunt. Alexandr Grigoryevitch was walking to and fro\r\nnear the table in silence. The lieutenant had slept badly that\r\nnight; he woke up depressed, and now he felt bored. He paced up and\r\ndown, thinking of the end of his furlough, of his fiancee, who was\r\nexpecting him, of how people could live all their lives in the\r\ncountry without feeling bored. Standing at the window, for a long\r\ntime he stared at the trees, smoked three cigarettes one after\r\nanother, and suddenly turned to his cousin.\r\n\r\n"I have a favour to ask you, Alyosha," he said. "Let me have a\r\nsaddle-horse for the day. . . ."\r\n\r\nKryukov looked searchingly at him and continued his writing with a\r\nfrown.\r\n\r\n"You will, then?" asked the lieutenant.\r\n\r\nKryukov looked at him again, then deliberately drew out a drawer\r\nin the table, and taking out a thick roll of notes, gave it to his\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s five thousand . . ." he said. "Though it\'s not my money,\r\nyet, God bless you, it\'s all the same. I advise you to send for\r\npost-horses at once and go away. Yes, really!"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant in his turn looked searchingly at Kryukov and laughed.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve guessed right, Alyosha," he said, reddening. "It was to her\r\nI meant to ride. Yesterday evening when the washerwoman gave me\r\nthat damned tunic, the one I was wearing then, and it smelt of\r\njasmine, why . . . I felt I must go!"\r\n\r\n"You must go away."\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly. And my furlough\'s just over. I really will go\r\nto-day! Yes, by Jove! However long one stays, one has to go in the\r\nend. . . . I\'m going!"\r\n\r\nThe post-horses were brought after dinner the same day; the lieutenant\r\nsaid good-bye to the Kryukovs and set off, followed by their good\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nAnother week passed. It was a dull but hot and heavy day. From early\r\nmorning Kryukov walked aimlessly about the house, looking out of\r\nwindow, or turning over the leaves of albums, though he was sick\r\nof the sight of them already. When he came across his wife or\r\nchildren, he began grumbling crossly. It seemed to him, for some\r\nreason that day, that his children\'s manners were revolting, that\r\nhis wife did not know how to look after the servants, that their\r\nexpenditure was quite disproportionate to their income. All this\r\nmeant that "the master" was out of humour.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Kryukov, feeling dissatisfied with the soup and the\r\nroast meat he had eaten, ordered out his racing droshky. He drove\r\nslowly out of the courtyard, drove at a walking pace for a quarter\r\nof a mile, and stopped.\r\n\r\n"Shall I . . . drive to her . . . that devil?" he thought, looking\r\nat the leaden sky.\r\n\r\nAnd Kryukov positively laughed, as though it were the first time\r\nthat day he had asked himself that question. At once the load of\r\nboredom was lifted from his heart, and there rose a gleam of pleasure\r\nin his lazy eyes. He lashed the horse. . . .\r\n\r\nAll the way his imagination was picturing how surprised the Jewess\r\nwould be to see him, how he would laugh and chat, and come home\r\nfeeling refreshed. . . .\r\n\r\n"Once a month one needs something to brighten one up . . . something\r\nout of the common round," he thought, "something that would give\r\nthe stagnant organism a good shaking up, a reaction . . . whether\r\nit\'s a drinking bout, or . . . Susanna. One can\'t get on without\r\nit."\r\n\r\nIt was getting dark when he drove into the yard of the vodka\r\ndistillery. From the open windows of the owner\'s house came sounds\r\nof laughter and singing:\r\n\r\n"\'Brighter than lightning, more burning than flame. . . .\'"\r\n\r\nsang a powerful, mellow, bass voice.\r\n\r\n"Aha! she has visitors," thought Kryukov.\r\n\r\nAnd he was annoyed that she had visitors.\r\n\r\n"Shall I go back?" he thought with his hand on the bell, but he\r\nrang all the same, and went up the familiar staircase. From the\r\nentry he glanced into the reception hall. There were about five men\r\nthere--all landowners and officials of his acquaintance; one, a\r\ntall, thin gentleman, was sitting at the piano, singing, and striking\r\nthe keys with his long, thin fingers. The others were listening and\r\ngrinning with enjoyment. Kryukov looked himself up and down in the\r\nlooking-glass, and was about to go into the hall, when Susanna\r\nMoiseyevna herself darted into the entry, in high spirits and wearing\r\nthe same black dress. . . . Seeing Kryukov, she was petrified for\r\nan instant, then she uttered a little scream and beamed with delight.\r\n\r\n"Is it you?" she said, clutching his hand. "What a surprise!"\r\n\r\n"Here she is!" smiled Kryukov, putting his arm round her waist.\r\n"Well! Does the destiny of Europe still lie in the hands of the\r\nFrench and the Russians?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad," laughed the Jewess, cautiously removing his arm.\r\n"Come, go into the hall; they\'re all friends there. . . . I\'ll go\r\nand tell them to bring you some tea. Your name\'s Alexey, isn\'t it?\r\nWell, go in, I\'ll come directly. . . ."\r\n\r\nShe blew him a kiss and ran out of the entry, leaving behind her\r\nthe same sickly smell of jasmine. Kryukov raised his head and walked\r\ninto the hall. He was on terms of friendly intimacy with all the\r\nmen in the room, but scarcely nodded to them; they, too, scarcely\r\nresponded, as though the places in which they met were not quite\r\ndecent, and as though they were in tacit agreement with one another\r\nthat it was more suitable for them not to recognise one another.\r\n\r\nFrom the hall Kryukov walked into the drawing-room, and from it\r\ninto a second drawing-room. On the way he met three or four other\r\nguests, also men whom he knew, though they barely recognised him.\r\nTheir faces were flushed with drink and merriment. Alexey Ivanovitch\r\nglanced furtively at them and marvelled that these men, respectable\r\nheads of families, who had known sorrow and privation, could demean\r\nthemselves to such pitiful, cheap gaiety! He shrugged his shoulders,\r\nsmiled, and walked on.\r\n\r\n"There are places," he reflected, "where a sober man feels sick,\r\nand a drunken man rejoices. I remember I never could go to the\r\noperetta or the gipsies when I was sober: wine makes a man more\r\ngood-natured and reconciles him with vice. . . ."\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stood still, petrified, and caught hold of the door-post\r\nwith both hands. At the writing-table in Susanna\'s study was sitting\r\nLieutenant Alexandr Grigoryevitch. He was discussing something in\r\nan undertone with a fat, flabby-looking Jew, and seeing his cousin,\r\nflushed crimson and looked down at an album.\r\n\r\nThe sense of decency was stirred in Kryukov and the blood rushed\r\nto his head. Overwhelmed with amazement, shame, and anger, he walked\r\nup to the table without a word. Sokolsky\'s head sank lower than\r\never. His face worked with an expression of agonising shame.\r\n\r\n"Ah, it\'s you, Alyosha!" he articulated, making a desperate effort\r\nto raise his eyes and to smile. "I called here to say good-bye,\r\nand, as you see. . . . But to-morrow I am certainly going."\r\n\r\n"What can I say to him? What?" thought Alexey Ivanovitch. "How can\r\nI judge him since I\'m here myself?"\r\n\r\nAnd clearing his throat without uttering a word, he went out slowly.\r\n\r\n"\'Call her not heavenly, and leave her on earth. . . .\'"\r\n\r\nThe bass was singing in the hall. A little while after, Kryukov\'s\r\nracing droshky was bumping along the dusty road.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEIGHBOURS\r\n\r\nPYOTR MIHALITCH IVASHIN was very much out of humour: his sister, a\r\nyoung girl, had gone away to live with Vlassitch, a married man.\r\nTo shake off the despondency and depression which pursued him at\r\nhome and in the fields, he called to his aid his sense of justice,\r\nhis genuine and noble ideas--he had always defended free-love!\r\n--but this was of no avail, and he always came back to the same\r\nconclusion as their foolish old nurse, that his sister had acted\r\nwrongly and that Vlassitch had abducted his sister. And that was\r\ndistressing.\r\n\r\nHis mother did not leave her room all day long; the old nurse kept\r\nsighing and speaking in whispers; his aunt had been on the point\r\nof taking her departure every day, and her trunks were continually\r\nbeing brought down to the hall and carried up again to her room.\r\nIn the house, in the yard, and in the garden it was as still as\r\nthough there were some one dead in the house. His aunt, the servants,\r\nand even the peasants, so it seemed to Pyotr Mihalitch, looked at\r\nhim enigmatically and with perplexity, as though they wanted to say\r\n"Your sister has been seduced; why are you doing nothing?" And he\r\nreproached himself for inactivity, though he did not know precisely\r\nwhat action he ought to have taken.\r\n\r\nSo passed six days. On the seventh--it was Sunday afternoon--a\r\nmessenger on horseback brought a letter. The address was in a\r\nfamiliar feminine handwriting: "Her Excy. Anna Nikolaevna Ivashin."\r\nPyotr Mihalitch fancied that there was something defiant, provocative,\r\nin the handwriting and in the abbreviation "Excy." And advanced\r\nideas in women are obstinate, ruthless, cruel.\r\n\r\n"She\'d rather die than make any concession to her unhappy mother,\r\nor beg her forgiveness," thought Pyotr Mihalitch, as he went to his\r\nmother with the letter.\r\n\r\nHis mother was lying on her bed, dressed. Seeing her son, she rose\r\nimpulsively, and straightening her grey hair, which had fallen from\r\nunder her cap, asked quickly:\r\n\r\n"What is it? What is it?"\r\n\r\n"This has come . . ." said her son, giving her the letter.\r\n\r\nZina\'s name, and even the pronoun "she" was not uttered in the\r\nhouse. Zina was spoken of impersonally: "this has come," "Gone\r\naway," and so on. . . . The mother recognised her daughter\'s\r\nhandwriting, and her face grew ugly and unpleasant, and her grey\r\nhair escaped again from her cap.\r\n\r\n"No!" she said, with a motion of her hands, as though the letter\r\nscorched her fingers. "No, no, never! Nothing would induce me!"\r\n\r\nThe mother broke into hysterical sobs of grief and shame; she\r\nevidently longed to read the letter, but her pride prevented her.\r\nPyotr Mihalitch realised that he ought to open the letter himself\r\nand read it aloud, but he was overcome by anger such as he had never\r\nfelt before; he ran out into the yard and shouted to the messenger:\r\n\r\n"Say there will be no answer! There will be no answer! Tell them\r\nthat, you beast!"\r\n\r\nAnd he tore up the letter; then tears came into his eyes, and feeling\r\nthat he was cruel, miserable, and to blame, he went out into the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nHe was only twenty-seven, but he was already stout. He dressed like\r\nan old man in loose, roomy clothes, and suffered from asthma. He\r\nalready seemed to be developing the characteristics of an elderly\r\ncountry bachelor. He never fell in love, never thought of marriage,\r\nand loved no one but his mother, his sister, his old nurse, and the\r\ngardener, Vassilitch. He was fond of good fare, of his nap after\r\ndinner, and of talking about politics and exalted subjects. He had\r\nin his day taken his degree at the university, but he now looked\r\nupon his studies as though in them he had discharged a duty incumbent\r\nupon young men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five; at any\r\nrate, the ideas which now strayed every day through his mind had\r\nnothing in common with the university or the subjects he had studied\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn the fields it was hot and still, as though rain were coming. It\r\nwas steaming in the wood, and there was a heavy fragrant scent from\r\nthe pines and rotting leaves. Pyotr Mihalitch stopped several times\r\nand wiped his wet brow. He looked at his winter corn and his spring\r\noats, walked round the clover-field, and twice drove away a partridge\r\nwith its chicks which had strayed in from the wood. And all the\r\nwhile he was thinking that this insufferable state of things could\r\nnot go on for ever, and that he must end it one way or another. End\r\nit stupidly, madly, but he must end it.\r\n\r\n"But how? What can I do?" he asked himself, and looked imploringly\r\nat the sky and at the trees, as though begging for their help.\r\n\r\nBut the sky and the trees were mute. His noble ideas were no help,\r\nand his common sense whispered that the agonising question could\r\nhave no solution but a stupid one, and that to-day\'s scene with the\r\nmessenger was not the last one of its kind. It was terrible to think\r\nwhat was in store for him!\r\n\r\nAs he returned home the sun was setting. By now it seemed to him\r\nthat the problem was incapable of solution. He could not accept the\r\naccomplished fact, and he could not refuse to accept it, and there\r\nwas no intermediate course. When, taking off his hat and fanning\r\nhimself with his handkerchief, he was walking along the road, and\r\nhad only another mile and a half to go before he would reach home,\r\nhe heard bells behind him. It was a very choice and successful\r\ncombination of bells, which gave a clear crystal note. No one had\r\nsuch bells on his horses but the police captain, Medovsky, formerly\r\nan officer in the hussars, a man in broken-down health, who had\r\nbeen a great rake and spendthrift, and was a distant relation of\r\nPyotr Mihalitch. He was like one of the family at the Ivashins\' and\r\nhad a tender, fatherly affection for Zina, as well as a great\r\nadmiration for her.\r\n\r\n"I was coming to see you," he said, overtaking Pyotr Mihalitch.\r\n"Get in; I\'ll give you a lift."\r\n\r\nHe was smiling and looked cheerful. Evidently he did not yet know\r\nthat Zina had gone to live with Vlassitch; perhaps he had been told\r\nof it already, but did not believe it. Pyotr Mihalitch felt in a\r\ndifficult position.\r\n\r\n"You are very welcome," he muttered, blushing till the tears came\r\ninto his eyes, and not knowing how to lie or what to say. "I am\r\ndelighted," he went on, trying to smile, "but . . . Zina is away\r\nand mother is ill."\r\n\r\n"How annoying!" said the police captain, looking pensively at Pyotr\r\nMihalitch. "And I was meaning to spend the evening with you. Where\r\nhas Zinaida Mihalovna gone?"\r\n\r\n"To the Sinitskys\', and I believe she meant to go from there to the\r\nmonastery. I don\'t quite know."\r\n\r\nThe police captain talked a little longer and then turned back.\r\nPyotr Mihalitch walked home, and thought with horror what the police\r\ncaptain\'s feelings would be when he learned the truth. And Pyotr\r\nMihalitch imagined his feelings, and actually experiencing them\r\nhimself, went into the house.\r\n\r\n"Lord help us," he thought, "Lord help us!"\r\n\r\nAt evening tea the only one at the table was his aunt. As usual,\r\nher face wore the expression that seemed to say that though she was\r\na weak, defenceless woman, she would allow no one to insult her.\r\nPyotr Mihalitch sat down at the other end of the table (he did not\r\nlike his aunt) and began drinking tea in silence.\r\n\r\n"Your mother has had no dinner again to-day," said his aunt. "You\r\nought to do something about it, Petrusha. Starving oneself is no\r\nhelp in sorrow."\r\n\r\nIt struck Pyotr Mihalitch as absurd that his aunt should meddle in\r\nother people\'s business and should make her departure depend on\r\nZina\'s having gone away. He was tempted to say something rude to\r\nher, but restrained himself. And as he restrained himself he felt\r\nthe time had come for action, and that he could not bear it any\r\nlonger. Either he must act at once or fall on the ground, and scream\r\nand bang his head upon the floor. He pictured Vlassitch and Zina,\r\nboth of them progressive and self-satisfied, kissing each other\r\nsomewhere under a maple tree, and all the anger and bitterness that\r\nhad been accumulating in him for the last seven days fastened upon\r\nVlassitch.\r\n\r\n"One has seduced and abducted my sister," he thought, "another will\r\ncome and murder my mother, a third will set fire to the house and\r\nsack the place. . . . And all this under the mask of friendship,\r\nlofty ideas, unhappiness!"\r\n\r\n"No, it shall not be!" Pyotr Mihalitch cried suddenly, and he brought\r\nhis fist down on the table.\r\n\r\nHe jumped up and ran out of the dining-room. In the stable the\r\nsteward\'s horse was standing ready saddled. He got on it and galloped\r\noff to Vlassitch.\r\n\r\nThere was a perfect tempest within him. He felt a longing to do\r\nsomething extraordinary, startling, even if he had to repent of it\r\nall his life afterwards. Should he call Vlassitch a blackguard,\r\nslap him in the face, and then challenge him to a duel? But Vlassitch\r\nwas not one of those men who do fight duels; being called a blackguard\r\nand slapped in the face would only make him more unhappy, and would\r\nmake him shrink into himself more than ever. These unhappy, defenceless\r\npeople are the most insufferable, the most tiresome creatures in\r\nthe world. They can do anything with impunity. When the luckless\r\nman responds to well-deserved reproach by looking at you with eyes\r\nfull of deep and guilty feeling, and with a sickly smile bends his\r\nhead submissively, even justice itself could not lift its hand\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n"No matter. I\'ll horsewhip him before her eyes and tell him what I\r\nthink of him," Pyotr Mihalitch decided.\r\n\r\nHe was riding through his wood and waste land, and he imagined Zina\r\nwould try to justify her conduct by talking about the rights of\r\nwomen and individual freedom, and about there being no difference\r\nbetween legal marriage and free union. Like a woman, she would argue\r\nabout what she did not understand. And very likely at the end she\r\nwould ask, "How do you come in? What right have you to interfere?"\r\n\r\n"No, I have no right," muttered Pyotr Mihalitch. "But so much the\r\nbetter. . . . The harsher I am, the less right I have to interfere,\r\nthe better."\r\n\r\nIt was sultry. Clouds of gnats hung over the ground and in the waste\r\nplaces the peewits called plaintively. Everything betokened rain,\r\nbut he could not see a cloud in the sky. Pyotr Mihalitch crossed\r\nthe boundary of his estate and galloped over a smooth, level field.\r\nHe often went along this road and knew every bush, every hollow in\r\nit. What now in the far distance looked in the dusk like a dark\r\ncliff was a red church; he could picture it all down to the smallest\r\ndetail, even the plaster on the gate and the calves that were always\r\ngrazing in the church enclosure. Three-quarters of a mile to the\r\nright of the church there was a copse like a dark blur--it was\r\nCount Koltonovitch\'s. And beyond the church Vlassitch\'s estate\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nFrom behind the church and the count\'s copse a huge black storm-cloud\r\nwas rising, and there were ashes of white lightning.\r\n\r\n"Here it is!" thought Pyotr Mihalitch. "Lord help us, Lord help\r\nus!"\r\n\r\nThe horse was soon tired after its quick gallop, and Pyotr Mihalitch\r\nwas tired too. The storm-cloud looked at him angrily and seemed to\r\nadvise him to go home. He felt a little scared.\r\n\r\n"I will prove to them they are wrong," he tried to reassure himself.\r\n"They will say that it is free-love, individual freedom; but freedom\r\nmeans self-control and not subjection to passion. It\'s not liberty\r\nbut license!"\r\n\r\nHe reached the count\'s big pond; it looked dark blue and frowning\r\nunder the cloud, and a smell of damp and slime rose from it. Near\r\nthe dam, two willows, one old and one young, drooped tenderly towards\r\none another. Pyotr Mihalitch and Vlassitch had been walking near\r\nthis very spot only a fortnight before, humming a students\' song:\r\n\r\n"\'Youth is wasted, life is nought, when the heart is cold and\r\nloveless.\'"\r\n\r\nA wretched song!\r\n\r\nIt was thundering as Pyotr Mihalitch rode through the copse, and\r\nthe trees were bending and rustling in the wind. He had to make\r\nhaste. It was only three-quarters of a mile through a meadow from\r\nthe copse to Vlassitch\'s house. Here there were old birch-trees on\r\neach side of the road. They had the same melancholy and unhappy air\r\nas their owner Vlassitch, and looked as tall and lanky as he. Big\r\ndrops of rain pattered on the birches and on the grass; the wind\r\nhad suddenly dropped, and there was a smell of wet earth and poplars.\r\nBefore him he saw Vlassitch\'s fence with a row of yellow acacias,\r\nwhich were tall and lanky too; where the fence was broken he could\r\nsee the neglected orchard.\r\n\r\nPyotr Mihalitch was not thinking now of the horsewhip or of a slap\r\nin the face, and did not know what he would do at Vlassitch\'s. He\r\nfelt nervous. He felt frightened on his own account and on his\r\nsister\'s, and was terrified at the thought of seeing her. How would\r\nshe behave with her brother? What would they both talk about? And\r\nhad he not better go back before it was too late? As he made these\r\nreflections, he galloped up the avenue of lime-trees to the house,\r\nrode round the big clumps of lilacs, and suddenly saw Vlassitch.\r\n\r\nVlassitch, wearing a cotton shirt, and top-boots, bending forward,\r\nwith no hat on in the rain, was coming from the corner of the house\r\nto the front door. He was followed by a workman with a hammer and\r\na box of nails. They must have been mending a shutter which had\r\nbeen banging in the wind. Seeing Pyotr Mihalitch, Vlassitch stopped.\r\n\r\n"It\'s you!" he said, smiling. "That\'s nice."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve come, as you see," said Pyotr Mihalitch, brushing the\r\nrain off himself with both hands.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s capital! I\'m very glad," said Vlassitch, but he did\r\nnot hold out his hand: evidently he did not venture, but waited for\r\nPyotr Mihalitch to hold out his. "It will do the oats good," he\r\nsaid, looking at the sky.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nThey went into the house in silence. To the right of the hall was\r\na door leading to another hall and then to the drawing-room, and\r\non the left was a little room which in winter was used by the\r\nsteward. Pyotr Mihalitch and Vlassitch went into this little room.\r\n\r\n"Where were you caught in the rain?"\r\n\r\n"Not far off, quite close to the house."\r\n\r\nPyotr Mihalitch sat down on the bed. He was glad of the noise of\r\nthe rain and the darkness of the room. It was better: it made it\r\nless dreadful, and there was no need to see his companion\'s face.\r\nThere was no anger in his heart now, nothing but fear and vexation\r\nwith himself. He felt he had made a bad beginning, and that nothing\r\nwould come of this visit.\r\n\r\nBoth were silent for some time and affected to be listening to the\r\nrain.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Petrusha," Vlassitch began, clearing his throat. "I am\r\nvery grateful to you for coming. It\'s generous and noble of you. I\r\nunderstand it, and, believe me, I appreciate it. Believe me."\r\n\r\nHe looked out of the window and went on, standing in the middle of\r\nthe room:\r\n\r\n"Everything happened so secretly, as though we were concealing it\r\nall from you. The feeling that you might be wounded and angry has\r\nbeen a blot on our happiness all these days. But let me justify\r\nmyself. We kept it secret not because we did not trust you. To begin\r\nwith, it all happened suddenly, by a kind of inspiration; there was\r\nno time to discuss it. Besides, it\'s such a private, delicate matter,\r\nand it was awkward to bring a third person in, even some one as\r\nintimate as you. Above all, in all this we reckoned on your generosity.\r\nYou are a very noble and generous person. I am infinitely grateful\r\nto you. If you ever need my life, come and take it."\r\n\r\nVlassitch talked in a quiet, hollow bass, always on the same droning\r\nnote; he was evidently agitated. Pyotr Mihalitch felt it was his\r\nturn to speak, and that to listen and keep silent would really mean\r\nplaying the part of a generous and noble simpleton, and that had\r\nnot been his idea in coming. He got up quickly and said, breathlessly\r\nin an undertone:\r\n\r\n"Listen, Grigory. You know I liked you and could have desired no\r\nbetter husband for my sister; but what has happened is awful! It\'s\r\nterrible to think of it!"\r\n\r\n"Why is it terrible?" asked Vlassitch, with a quiver in his voice.\r\n"It would be terrible if we had done wrong, but that isn\'t so."\r\n\r\n"Listen, Grigory. You know I have no prejudices; but, excuse my\r\nfrankness, to my mind you have both acted selfishly. Of course, I\r\nshan\'t say so to my sister--it will distress her; but you ought\r\nto know: mother is miserable beyond all description."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s sad," sighed Vlassitch. "We foresaw that, Petrusha,\r\nbut what could we have done? Because one\'s actions hurt other people,\r\nit doesn\'t prove that they are wrong. What\'s to be done! Every\r\nimportant step one takes is bound to distress somebody. If you went\r\nto fight for freedom, that would distress your mother, too. What\'s\r\nto be done! Any one who puts the peace of his family before everything\r\nhas to renounce the life of ideas completely."\r\n\r\nThere was a vivid flash of lightning at the window, and the lightning\r\nseemed to change the course of Vlassitch\'s thoughts. He sat down\r\nbeside Pyotr Mihalitch and began saying what was utterly beside the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n"I have such a reverence for your sister, Petrusha," he said. "When\r\nI used to come and see you, I felt as though I were going to a holy\r\nshrine, and I really did worship Zina. Now my reverence for her\r\ngrows every day. For me she is something higher than a wife--yes,\r\nhigher!" Vlassitch waved his hands. "She is my holy of holies. Since\r\nshe is living with me, I enter my house as though it were a temple.\r\nShe is an extraordinary, rare, most noble woman!"\r\n\r\n"Well, he\'s off now!" thought Pyotr Mihalitch; he disliked the word\r\n"woman."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t you be married properly?" he asked. "How much does\r\nyour wife want for a divorce?"\r\n\r\n"Seventy-five thousand."\r\n\r\n"It\'s rather a lot. But if we were to negotiate with her?"\r\n\r\n"She won\'t take a farthing less. She is an awful woman, brother,"\r\nsighed Vlassitch. "I\'ve never talked to you about her before--it\r\nwas unpleasant to think of her; but now that the subject has come\r\nup, I\'ll tell you about her. I married her on the impulse of the\r\nmoment--a fine, honourable impulse. An officer in command of a\r\nbattalion of our regiment--if you care to hear the details--had\r\nan affair with a girl of eighteen; that is, to put it plainly, he\r\nseduced her, lived with her for two months, and abandoned her. She\r\nwas in an awful position, brother. She was ashamed to go home to\r\nher parents; besides, they wouldn\'t have received her. Her lover\r\nhad abandoned her; there was nothing left for her but to go to the\r\nbarracks and sell herself. The other officers in the regiment were\r\nindignant. They were by no means saints themselves, but the baseness\r\nof it was so striking. Besides, no one in the regiment could endure\r\nthe man. And to spite him, you understand, the indignant lieutenants\r\nand ensigns began getting up a subscription for the unfortunate\r\ngirl. And when we subalterns met together and began to subscribe\r\nfive or ten roubles each, I had a sudden inspiration. I felt it was\r\nan opportunity to do something fine. I hastened to the girl and\r\nwarmly expressed my sympathy. And while I was on my way to her, and\r\nwhile I was talking to her, I loved her fervently as a woman insulted\r\nand injured. Yes. . . . Well, a week later I made her an offer. The\r\ncolonel and my comrades thought my marriage out of keeping with the\r\ndignity of an officer. That roused me more than ever. I wrote a\r\nlong letter, do you know, in which I proved that my action ought\r\nto be inscribed in the annals of the regiment in letters of gold,\r\nand so on. I sent the letter to my colonel and copies to my comrades.\r\nWell, I was excited, and, of course, I could not avoid being rude.\r\nI was asked to leave the regiment. I have a rough copy of it put\r\naway somewhere; I\'ll give it to you to read sometime. It was written\r\nwith great feeling. You will see what lofty and noble sentiments I\r\nwas experiencing. I resigned my commission and came here with my\r\nwife. My father had left a few debts, I had no money, and from the\r\nfirst day my wife began making acquaintances, dressing herself\r\nsmartly, and playing cards, and I was obliged to mortgage the estate.\r\nShe led a bad life, you understand, and you are the only one of the\r\nneighbours who hasn\'t been her lover. After two years I gave her\r\nall I had to set me free and she went off to town. Yes. . . . And\r\nnow I pay her twelve hundred roubles a year. She is an awful woman!\r\nThere is a fly, brother, which lays an egg in the back of a spider\r\nso that the spider can\'t shake it off: the grub fastens upon the\r\nspider and drinks its heart\'s blood. That was how this woman fastened\r\nupon me and sucks the blood of my heart. She hates and despises me\r\nfor being so stupid; that is, for marrying a woman like her. My\r\nchivalry seems to her despicable. \'A wise man cast me off,\' she\r\nsays, \'and a fool picked me up.\' To her thinking no one but a pitiful\r\nidiot could have behaved as I did. And that is insufferably bitter\r\nto me, brother. Altogether, I may say in parenthesis, fate has been\r\nhard upon me, very hard."\r\n\r\nPyotr Mihalitch listened to Vlassitch and wondered in perplexity\r\nwhat it was in this man that had so charmed his sister. He was not\r\nyoung--he was forty-one--lean and lanky, narrow-chested, with\r\na long nose, and grey hairs in his beard. He talked in a droning\r\nvoice, had a sickly smile, and waved his hands awkwardly as he\r\ntalked. He had neither health, nor pleasant, manly manners, nor\r\n_savoir-faire_, nor gaiety, and in all his exterior there was\r\nsomething colourless and indefinite. He dressed without taste, his\r\nsurroundings were depressing, he did not care for poetry or painting\r\nbecause "they have no answer to give to the questions of the day"\r\n--that is, he did not understand them; music did not touch him.\r\nHe was a poor farmer.\r\n\r\nHis estate was in a wretched condition and was mortgaged; he was\r\npaying twelve percent on the second mortgage and owed ten thousand\r\non personal securities as well. When the time came to pay the\r\ninterest on the mortgage or to send money to his wife, he asked\r\nevery one to lend him money with as much agitation as though his\r\nhouse were on fire, and, at the same time losing his head, he would\r\nsell the whole of his winter store of fuel for five roubles and a\r\nstack of straw for three roubles, and then have his garden fence\r\nor old cucumber-frames chopped up to heat his stoves. His meadows\r\nwere ruined by pigs, the peasants\' cattle strayed in the undergrowth\r\nin his woods, and every year the old trees were fewer and fewer:\r\nbeehives and rusty pails lay about in his garden and kitchen-garden.\r\nHe had neither talents nor abilities, nor even ordinary capacity\r\nfor living like other people. In practical life he was a weak, naive\r\nman, easy to deceive and to cheat, and the peasants with good reason\r\ncalled him "simple."\r\n\r\nHe was a Liberal, and in the district was regarded as a "Red," but\r\neven his progressiveness was a bore. There was no originality nor\r\nmoving power about his independent views: he was revolted, indignant,\r\nand delighted always on the same note; it was always spiritless and\r\nineffective. Even in moments of strong enthusiasm he never raised\r\nhis head or stood upright. But the most tiresome thing of all was\r\nthat he managed to express even his best and finest ideas so that\r\nthey seemed in him commonplace and out of date. It reminded one of\r\nsomething old one had read long ago, when slowly and with an air\r\nof profundity he would begin discoursing of his noble, lofty moments,\r\nof his best years; or when he went into raptures over the younger\r\ngeneration, which has always been, and still is, in advance of\r\nsociety; or abused Russians for donning their dressing-gowns at\r\nthirty and forgetting the principles of their _alma mater_. If you\r\nstayed the night with him, he would put Pissarev or Darwin on your\r\nbedroom table; if you said you had read it, he would go and bring\r\nDobrolubov.\r\n\r\nIn the district this was called free-thinking, and many people\r\nlooked upon this free-thinking as an innocent and harmless eccentricity;\r\nit made him profoundly unhappy, however. It was for him the maggot\r\nof which he had just been speaking; it had fastened upon him and\r\nwas sucking his life-blood. In his past there had been the strange\r\nmarriage in the style of Dostoevsky; long letters and copies written\r\nin a bad, unintelligible hand-writing, but with great feeling,\r\nendless misunderstandings, explanations, disappointments, then\r\ndebts, a second mortgage, the allowance to his wife, the monthly\r\nborrowing of money--and all this for no benefit to any one, either\r\nhimself or others. And in the present, as in the past, he was still\r\nin a nervous flurry, on the lookout for heroic actions, and poking\r\nhis nose into other people\'s affairs; as before, at every favourable\r\nopportunity there were long letters and copies, wearisome, stereotyped\r\nconversations about the village community, or the revival of\r\nhandicrafts or the establishment of cheese factories--conversations\r\nas like one another as though he had prepared them, not in his\r\nliving brain, but by some mechanical process. And finally this\r\nscandal with Zina of which one could not see the end!\r\n\r\nAnd meanwhile Zina was young--she was only twenty-two--good-looking,\r\nelegant, gay; she was fond of laughing, chatter, argument, a\r\npassionate musician; she had good taste in dress, in furniture, in\r\nbooks, and in her own home she would not have put up with a room\r\nlike this, smelling of boots and cheap vodka. She, too, had advanced\r\nideas, but in her free-thinking one felt the overflow of energy,\r\nthe vanity of a young, strong, spirited girl, passionately eager\r\nto be better and more original than others. . . . How had it happened\r\nthat she had fallen in love with Vlassitch?\r\n\r\n"He is a Quixote, an obstinate fanatic, a maniac," thought Pyotr\r\nMihalitch, "and she is as soft, yielding, and weak in character as\r\nI am. . . . She and I give in easily, without resistance. She loves\r\nhim; but, then, I, too, love him in spite of everything."\r\n\r\nPyotr Mihalitch considered Vlassitch a good, straightforward man,\r\nbut narrow and one-sided. In his perturbations and his sufferings,\r\nand in fact in his whole life, he saw no lofty aims, remote or\r\nimmediate; he saw nothing but boredom and incapacity for life. His\r\nself-sacrifice and all that Vlassitch himself called heroic actions\r\nor noble impulses seemed to him a useless waste of force, unnecessary\r\nblank shots which consumed a great deal of powder. And Vlassitch\'s\r\nfanatical belief in the extraordinary loftiness and faultlessness\r\nof his own way of thinking struck him as naive and even morbid; and\r\nthe fact that Vlassitch all his life had contrived to mix the trivial\r\nwith the exalted, that he had made a stupid marriage and looked\r\nupon it as an act of heroism, and then had affairs with other women\r\nand regarded that as a triumph of some idea or other was simply\r\nincomprehensible.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Pyotr Mihalitch was fond of Vlassitch; he was conscious\r\nof a sort of power in him, and for some reason he had never had the\r\nheart to contradict him.\r\n\r\nVlassitch sat down quite close to him for a talk in the dark, to\r\nthe accompaniment of the rain, and he had cleared his throat as a\r\nprelude to beginning on something lengthy, such as the history of\r\nhis marriage. But it was intolerable for Pyotr Mihalitch to listen\r\nto him; he was tormented by the thought that he would see his sister\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you\'ve had bad luck," he said gently; "but, excuse me, we\'ve\r\nbeen wandering from the point. That\'s not what we are talking about."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, quite so. Well, let us come back to the point," said\r\nVlassitch, and he stood up. "I tell you, Petrusha, our conscience\r\nis clear. We are not married, but there is no need for me to prove\r\nto you that our marriage is perfectly legitimate. You are as free\r\nin your ideas as I am, and, happily, there can be no disagreement\r\nbetween us on that point. As for our future, that ought not to alarm\r\nyou. I\'ll work in the sweat of my brow, I\'ll work day and night--\r\nin fact, I will strain every nerve to make Zina happy. Her life\r\nwill be a splendid one! You may ask, am I able to do it. I am,\r\nbrother! When a man devotes every minute to one thought, it\'s not\r\ndifficult for him to attain his object. But let us go to Zina; it\r\nwill be a joy to her to see you."\r\n\r\nPyotr Mihalitch\'s heart began to beat. He got up and followed\r\nVlassitch into the hall, and from there into the drawing-room. There\r\nwas nothing in the huge gloomy room but a piano and a long row of\r\nold chairs ornamented with bronze, on which no one ever sat. There\r\nwas a candle alight on the piano. From the drawing-room they went\r\nin silence into the dining-room. This room, too, was large and\r\ncomfortless; in the middle of the room there was a round table with\r\ntwo leaves with six thick legs, and only one candle. A clock in a\r\nlarge mahogany case like an ikon stand pointed to half-past two.\r\n\r\nVlassitch opened the door into the next room and said:\r\n\r\n"Zina, here is Petrusha come to see us!"\r\n\r\nAt once there was the sound of hurried footsteps and Zina came into\r\nthe dining-room. She was tall, plump, and very pale, and, just as\r\nwhen he had seen her for the last time at home, she was wearing a\r\nblack skirt and a red blouse, with a large buckle on her belt. She\r\nflung one arm round her brother and kissed him on the temple.\r\n\r\n"What a storm!" she said. "Grigory went off somewhere and I was\r\nleft quite alone in the house."\r\n\r\nShe was not embarrassed, and looked at her brother as frankly and\r\ncandidly as at home; looking at her, Pyotr Mihalitch, too, lost his\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n"But you are not afraid of storms," he said, sitting down at the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"No," she said, "but here the rooms are so big, the house is so\r\nold, and when there is thunder it all rattles like a cupboard full\r\nof crockery. It\'s a charming house altogether," she went on, sitting\r\ndown opposite her brother. "There\'s some pleasant memory in every\r\nroom. In my room, only fancy, Grigory\'s grandfather shot himself."\r\n\r\n"In August we shall have the money to do up the lodge in the garden,"\r\nsaid Vlassitch.\r\n\r\n"For some reason when it thunders I think of that grandfather,"\r\nZina went on. "And in this dining-room somebody was flogged to\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\n"That\'s an actual fact," said Vlassitch, and he looked with wide-open\r\neyes at Pyotr Mihalitch. "Sometime in the forties this place was\r\nlet to a Frenchman called Olivier. The portrait of his daughter is\r\nlying in an attic now--a very pretty girl. This Olivier, so my\r\nfather told me, despised Russians for their ignorance and treated\r\nthem with cruel derision. Thus, for instance, he insisted on the\r\npriest walking without his hat for half a mile round his house, and\r\non the church bells being rung when the Olivier family drove through\r\nthe village. The serfs and altogether the humble of this world, of\r\ncourse, he treated with even less ceremony. Once there came along\r\nthis road one of the simple-hearted sons of wandering Russia,\r\nsomewhat after the style of Gogol\'s divinity student, Homa Brut.\r\nHe asked for a night\'s lodging, pleased the bailiffs, and was given\r\na job at the office of the estate. There are many variations of the\r\nstory. Some say the divinity student stirred up the peasants, others\r\nthat Olivier\' s daughter fell in love with him. I don\'t know which\r\nis true, only one fine evening Olivier called him in here and\r\ncross-examined him, then ordered him to be beaten. Do you know, he\r\nsat here at this table drinking claret while the stable-boys beat\r\nthe man. He must have tried to wring something out of him. Towards\r\nmorning the divinity student died of the torture and his body was\r\nhidden. They say it was thrown into Koltovitch\'s pond. There was\r\nan inquiry, but the Frenchman paid some thousands to some one in\r\nauthority and went away to Alsace. His lease was up just then, and\r\nso the matter ended."\r\n\r\n"What scoundrels!" said Zina, shuddering.\r\n\r\n"My father remembered Olivier and his daughter well. He used to say\r\nshe was remarkably beautiful and eccentric. I imagine the divinity\r\nstudent had done both--stirred up the peasants and won the\r\ndaughter\'s heart. Perhaps he wasn\'t a divinity student at all, but\r\nsome one travelling incognito."\r\n\r\nZina grew thoughtful; the story of the divinity student and the\r\nbeautiful French girl had evidently carried her imagination far\r\naway. It seemed to Pyotr Mihalitch that she had not changed in the\r\nleast during the last week, except that she was a little paler. She\r\nlooked calm and just as usual, as though she had come with her\r\nbrother to visit Vlassitch. But Pyotr Mihalitch felt that some\r\nchange had taken place in himself. Before, when she was living at\r\nhome, he could have spoken to her about anything, and now he did\r\nnot feel equal to asking her the simple question, "How do you like\r\nbeing here?" The question seemed awkward and unnecessary. Probably\r\nthe same change had taken place in her. She was in no haste to turn\r\nthe conversation to her mother, to her home, to her relations with\r\nVlassitch; she did not defend herself, she did not say that free\r\nunions are better than marriages in the church; she was not agitated,\r\nand calmly brooded over the story of Olivier. . . . And why had\r\nthey suddenly begun talking of Olivier?\r\n\r\n"You are both of you wet with the rain," said Zina, and she smiled\r\njoyfully; she was touched by this point of resemblance between her\r\nbrother and Vlassitch.\r\n\r\nAnd Pyotr Mihalitch felt all the bitterness and horror of his\r\nposition. He thought of his deserted home, the closed piano, and\r\nZina\'s bright little room into which no one went now; he thought\r\nthere were no prints of little feet on the garden-paths, and that\r\nbefore tea no one went off, laughing gaily, to bathe. What he had\r\nclung to more and more from his childhood upwards, what he had loved\r\nthinking about when he used to sit in the stuffy class-room or the\r\nlecture theatre--brightness, purity, and joy, everything that\r\nfilled the house with life and light, had gone never to return, had\r\nvanished, and was mixed up with a coarse, clumsy story of some\r\nbattalion officer, a chivalrous lieutenant, a depraved woman and a\r\ngrandfather who had shot himself. . . . And to begin to talk about\r\nhis mother or to think that the past could ever return would mean\r\nnot understanding what was clear.\r\n\r\nPyotr Mihalitch\'s eyes filled with tears and his hand began to\r\ntremble as it lay on the table. Zina guessed what he was thinking\r\nabout, and her eyes, too, glistened and looked red.\r\n\r\n"Grigory, come here," she said to Vlassitch.\r\n\r\nThey walked away to the window and began talking of something in a\r\nwhisper. From the way that Vlassitch stooped down to her and the\r\nway she looked at him, Pyotr Mihalitch realised again that everything\r\nwas irreparably over, and that it was no use to talk of anything.\r\nZina went out of the room.\r\n\r\n"Well, brother!" Vlassitch began, after a brief silence, rubbing\r\nhis hands and smiling. "I called our life happiness just now, but\r\nthat was, so to speak, poetical license. In reality, there has not\r\nbeen a sense of happiness so far. Zina has been thinking all the\r\ntime of you, of her mother, and has been worrying; looking at her,\r\nI, too, felt worried. Hers is a bold, free nature, but, you know,\r\nit\'s difficult when you\'re not used to it, and she is young, too.\r\nThe servants call her \'Miss\'; it seems a trifle, but it upsets her.\r\nThere it is, brother."\r\n\r\nZina brought in a plateful of strawberries. She was followed by a\r\nlittle maidservant, looking crushed and humble, who set a jug of\r\nmilk on the table and made a very low bow: she had something about\r\nher that was in keeping with the old furniture, something petrified\r\nand dreary.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the rain had ceased. Pyotr Mihalitch ate strawberries\r\nwhile Vlassitch and Zina looked at him in silence. The moment of\r\nthe inevitable but useless conversation was approaching, and all\r\nthree felt the burden of it. Pyotr Mihalitch\'s eyes filled with\r\ntears again; he pushed away his plate and said that he must be going\r\nhome, or it would be getting late, and perhaps it would rain again.\r\nThe time had come when common decency required Zina to speak of\r\nthose at home and of her new life.\r\n\r\n"How are things at home?" she asked rapidly, and her pale face\r\nquivered. "How is mother?"\r\n\r\n"You know mother . . ." said Pyotr Mihalitch, not looking at her.\r\n\r\n"Petrusha, you\'ve thought a great deal about what has happened,"\r\nshe said, taking hold of her brother\'s sleeve, and he knew how hard\r\nit was for her to speak. "You\'ve thought a great deal: tell me, can\r\nwe reckon on mother\'s accepting Grigory . . . and the whole position,\r\none day?"\r\n\r\nShe stood close to her brother, face to face with him, and he was\r\nastonished that she was so beautiful, and that he seemed not to\r\nhave noticed it before. And it seemed to him utterly absurd that\r\nhis sister, so like his mother, pampered, elegant, should be living\r\nwith Vlassitch and in Vlassitch\'s house, with the petrified servant,\r\nand the table with six legs--in the house where a man had been\r\nflogged to death, and that she was not going home with him, but was\r\nstaying here to sleep.\r\n\r\n"You know mother," he said, not answering her question. "I think\r\nyou ought to have . . . to do something, to ask her forgiveness or\r\nsomething. . . ."\r\n\r\n"But to ask her forgiveness would mean pretending we had done wrong.\r\nI\'m ready to tell a lie to comfort mother, but it won\'t lead anywhere.\r\nI know mother. Well, what will be, must be!" said Zina, growing\r\nmore cheerful now that the most unpleasant had been said. "We\'ll\r\nwait for five years, ten years, and be patient, and then God\'s will\r\nbe done."\r\n\r\nShe took her brother\'s arm, and when she walked through the dark\r\nhall she squeezed close to him. They went out on the steps. Pyotr\r\nMihalitch said good-bye, got on his horse, and set off at a walk;\r\nZina and Vlassitch walked a little way with him. It was still and\r\nwarm, with a delicious smell of hay; stars were twinkling brightly\r\nbetween the clouds. Vlassitch\'s old garden, which had seen so many\r\ngloomy stories in its time, lay slumbering in the darkness, and for\r\nsome reason it was mournful riding through it.\r\n\r\n"Zina and I to-day after dinner spent some really exalted moments,"\r\nsaid Vlassitch. "I read aloud to her an excellent article on the\r\nquestion of emigration. You must read it, brother! You really must.\r\nIt\'s remarkable for its lofty tone. I could not resist writing a\r\nletter to the editor to be forwarded to the author. I wrote only a\r\nsingle line: \'I thank you and warmly press your noble hand.\'"\r\n\r\nPyotr Mihalitch was tempted to say, "Don\'t meddle in what does not\r\nconcern you," but he held his tongue.\r\n\r\nVlassitch walked by his right stirrup and Zina by the left; both\r\nseemed to have forgotten that they had to go home. It was damp, and\r\nthey had almost reached Koltovitch\'s copse. Pyotr Mihalitch felt\r\nthat they were expecting something from him, though they hardly\r\nknew what it was, and he felt unbearably sorry for them. Now as\r\nthey walked by the horse with submissive faces, lost in thought,\r\nhe had a deep conviction that they were unhappy, and could not be\r\nhappy, and their love seemed to him a melancholy, irreparable\r\nmistake. Pity and the sense that he could do nothing to help them\r\nreduced him to that state of spiritual softening when he was ready\r\nto make any sacrifice to get rid of the painful feeling of sympathy.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come over sometimes for a night," he said.\r\n\r\nBut it sounded as though he were making a concession, and did not\r\nsatisfy him. When they stopped near Koltovitch\'s copse to say\r\ngood-bye, he bent down to Zina, touched her shoulder, and said:\r\n\r\n"You are right, Zina! You have done well." To avoid saying more and\r\nbursting into tears, he lashed his horse and galloped into the wood.\r\nAs he rode into the darkness, he looked round and saw Vlassitch and\r\nZina walking home along the road--he taking long strides, while\r\nshe walked with a hurried, jerky step beside him--talking eagerly\r\nabout something.\r\n\r\n"I am an old woman!" thought Pyotr Mihalitch. "I went to solve the\r\nquestion and I have only made it more complicated--there it is!"\r\n\r\nHe was heavy at heart. When he got out of the copse he rode at a\r\nwalk and then stopped his horse near the pond. He wanted to sit and\r\nthink without moving. The moon was rising and was reflected in a\r\nstreak of red on the other side of the pond. There were low rumbles\r\nof thunder in the distance. Pyotr Mihalitch looked steadily at the\r\nwater and imagined his sister\'s despair, her martyr-like pallor,\r\nthe tearless eyes with which she would conceal her humiliation from\r\nothers. He imagined her with child, imagined the death of their\r\nmother, her funeral, Zina\'s horror. . . . The proud, superstitious\r\nold woman would be sure to die of grief. Terrible pictures of the\r\nfuture rose before him on the background of smooth, dark water, and\r\namong pale feminine figures he saw himself, a weak, cowardly man\r\nwith a guilty face.\r\n\r\nA hundred paces off on the right bank of the pond, something dark\r\nwas standing motionless: was it a man or a tall post? Pyotr Mihalitch\r\nthought of the divinity student who had been killed and thrown into\r\nthe pond.\r\n\r\n"Olivier behaved inhumanly, but one way or another he did settle\r\nthe question, while I have settled nothing and have only made it\r\nworse," he thought, gazing at the dark figure that looked like a\r\nghost. "He said and did what he thought right while I say and do\r\nwhat I don\'t think right; and I don\'t know really what I do\r\nthink. . . ."\r\n\r\nHe rode up to the dark figure: it was an old rotten post, the relic\r\nof some shed.\r\n\r\nFrom Koltovitch\'s copse and garden there came a strong fragrant\r\nscent of lilies of the valley and honey-laden flowers. Pyotr Mihalitch\r\nrode along the bank of the pond and looked mournfully into the\r\nwater. And thinking about his life, he came to the conclusion he\r\nhad never said or acted upon what he really thought, and other\r\npeople had repaid him in the same way. And so the whole of life\r\nseemed to him as dark as this water in which the night sky was\r\nreflected and water-weeds grew in a tangle. And it seemed to him\r\nthat nothing could ever set it right.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT HOME\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE Don railway. A quiet, cheerless station, white and solitary in\r\nthe steppe, with its walls baking in the sun, without a speck of\r\nshade, and, it seems, without a human being. The train goes on after\r\nleaving one here; the sound of it is scarcely audible and dies away\r\nat last. Outside the station it is a desert, and there are no horses\r\nbut one\'s own. One gets into the carriage--which is so pleasant\r\nafter the train--and is borne along the road through the steppe,\r\nand by degrees there are unfolded before one views such as one does\r\nnot see near Moscow--immense, endless, fascinating in their\r\nmonotony. The steppe, the steppe, and nothing more; in the distance\r\nan ancient barrow or a windmill; ox-waggons laden with coal trail\r\nby. . . . Solitary birds fly low over the plain, and a drowsy feeling\r\ncomes with the monotonous beat of their wings. It is hot. Another\r\nhour or so passes, and still the steppe, the steppe, and still in\r\nthe distance the barrow. The driver tells you something, some long\r\nunnecessary tale, pointing into the distance with his whip. And\r\ntranquillity takes possession of the soul; one is loth to think of\r\nthe past. . . .\r\n\r\nA carriage with three horses had been sent to fetch Vera Ivanovna\r\nKardin. The driver put in her luggage and set the harness to rights.\r\n\r\n"Everything just as it always has been," said Vera, looking about\r\nher. "I was a little girl when I was here last, ten years ago. I\r\nremember old Boris came to fetch me then. Is he still living, I\r\nwonder?"\r\n\r\nThe driver made no reply, but, like a Little Russian, looked at her\r\nangrily and clambered on to the box.\r\n\r\nIt was a twenty-mile drive from the station, and Vera, too, abandoned\r\nherself to the charm of the steppe, forgot the past, and thought\r\nonly of the wide expanse, of the freedom. Healthy, clever, beautiful,\r\nand young--she was only three-and-twenty--she had hitherto\r\nlacked nothing in her life but just this space and freedom.\r\n\r\nThe steppe, the steppe. . . . The horses trotted, the sun rose\r\nhigher and higher; and it seemed to Vera that never in her childhood\r\nhad the steppe been so rich, so luxuriant in June; the wild flowers\r\nwere green, yellow, lilac, white, and a fragrance rose from them\r\nand from the warmed earth; and there were strange blue birds along\r\nthe roadside. . . . Vera had long got out of the habit of praying,\r\nbut now, struggling with drowsiness, she murmured:\r\n\r\n"Lord, grant that I may be happy here."\r\n\r\nAnd there was peace and sweetness in her soul, and she felt as\r\nthough she would have been glad to drive like that all her life,\r\nlooking at the steppe.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a deep ravine overgrown with oak saplings and\r\nalder-trees; there was a moist feeling in the air--there must\r\nhave been a spring at the bottom. On the near side, on the very\r\nedge of the ravine, a covey of partridges rose noisily. Vera\r\nremembered that in old days they used to go for evening walks to\r\nthis ravine; so it must be near home! And now she could actually\r\nsee the poplars, the barn, black smoke rising on one side--they\r\nwere burning old straw. And there was Auntie Dasha coming to meet\r\nher and waving her handkerchief; grandfather was on the terrace.\r\nOh dear, how happy she was!\r\n\r\n"My darling, my darling!" cried her aunt, shrieking as though she\r\nwere in hysterics. "Our real mistress has come! You must understand\r\nyou are our mistress, you are our queen! Here everything is yours!\r\nMy darling, my beauty, I am not your aunt, but your willing slave!"\r\n\r\nVera had no relations but her aunt and her grandfather; her mother\r\nhad long been dead; her father, an engineer, had died three months\r\nbefore at Kazan, on his way from Siberia. Her grandfather had a big\r\ngrey beard. He was stout, red-faced, and asthmatic, and walked\r\nleaning on a cane and sticking his stomach out. Her aunt, a lady\r\nof forty-two, drawn in tightly at the waist and fashionably dressed\r\nwith sleeves high on the shoulder, evidently tried to look young\r\nand was still anxious to be charming; she walked with tiny steps\r\nwith a wriggle of her spine.\r\n\r\n"Will you love us?" she said, embracing Vera, "You are not proud?"\r\n\r\nAt her grandfather\'s wish there was a thanksgiving service, then\r\nthey spent a long while over dinner--and Vera\'s new life began.\r\nShe was given the best room. All the rugs in the house had been put\r\nin it, and a great many flowers; and when at night she lay down in\r\nher snug, wide, very soft bed and covered herself with a silk quilt\r\nthat smelt of old clothes long stored away, she laughed with pleasure.\r\nAuntie Dasha came in for a minute to wish her good-night.\r\n\r\n"Here you are home again, thank God," she said, sitting down on the\r\nbed. "As you see, we get along very well and have everything we\r\nwant. There\'s only one thing: your grandfather is in a poor way! A\r\nterribly poor way! He is short of breath and he has begun to lose\r\nhis memory. And you remember how strong, how vigorous, he used to\r\nbe! There was no doing anything with him. . . . In old days, if the\r\nservants didn\'t please him or anything else went wrong, he would\r\njump up at once and shout: \'Twenty-five strokes! The birch!\' But\r\nnow he has grown milder and you never hear him. And besides, times\r\nare changed, my precious; one mayn\'t beat them nowadays. Of course,\r\nthey oughtn\'t to be beaten, but they need looking after."\r\n\r\n"And are they beaten now, auntie?" asked Vera.\r\n\r\n"The steward beats them sometimes, but I never do, bless their\r\nhearts! And your grandfather sometimes lifts his stick from old\r\nhabit, but he never beats them."\r\n\r\nAuntie Dasha yawned and crossed herself over her mouth and her right\r\near.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not dull here?" Vera inquired.\r\n\r\n"What shall I say? There are no landowners living here now, but\r\nthere have been works built near, darling, and there are lots of\r\nengineers, doctors, and mine managers. Of course, we have theatricals\r\nand concerts, but we play cards more than anything. They come to\r\nus, too. Dr. Neshtchapov from the works comes to see us--such a\r\nhandsome, interesting man! He fell in love with your photograph. I\r\nmade up my mind: he is Verotchka\'s destiny, I thought. He\'s young,\r\nhandsome, he has means--a good match, in fact. And of course\r\nyou\'re a match for any one. You\'re of good family. The place is\r\nmortgaged, it\'s true, but it\'s in good order and not neglected;\r\nthere is my share in it, but it will all come to you; I am your\r\nwilling slave. And my brother, your father, left you fifteen thousand\r\nroubles. . . . But I see you can\'t keep your eyes open. Sleep, my\r\nchild."\r\n\r\nNext day Vera spent a long time walking round the house. The garden,\r\nwhich was old and unattractive, lying inconveniently upon the slope,\r\nhad no paths, and was utterly neglected; probably the care of it\r\nwas regarded as an unnecessary item in the management. There were\r\nnumbers of grass-snakes. Hoopoes flew about under the trees calling\r\n"Oo-too-toot!" as though they were trying to remind her of something.\r\nAt the bottom of the hill there was a river overgrown with tall\r\nreeds, and half a mile beyond the river was the village. From the\r\ngarden Vera went out into the fields; looking into the distance,\r\nthinking of her new life in her own home, she kept trying to grasp\r\nwhat was in store for her. The space, the lovely peace of the steppe,\r\ntold her that happiness was near at hand, and perhaps was here\r\nalready; thousands of people, in fact, would have said: "What\r\nhappiness to be young, healthy, well-educated, to be living on one\'s\r\nown estate!" And at the same time the endless plain, all alike,\r\nwithout one living soul, frightened her, and at moments it was clear\r\nto her that its peaceful green vastness would swallow up her life\r\nand reduce it to nothingness. She was very young, elegant, fond of\r\nlife; she had finished her studies at an aristocratic boarding-school,\r\nhad learnt three languages, had read a great deal, had travelled\r\nwith her father--and could all this have been meant to lead to\r\nnothing but settling down in a remote country-house in the steppe,\r\nand wandering day after day from the garden into the fields and\r\nfrom the fields into the garden to while away the time, and then\r\nsitting at home listening to her grandfather\'s breathing? But what\r\ncould she do? Where could she go? She could find no answer, and as\r\nshe was returning home she doubted whether she would be happy here,\r\nand thought that driving from the station was far more interesting\r\nthan living here.\r\n\r\nDr. Neshtchapov drove over from the works. He was a doctor, but\r\nthree years previously he had taken a share in the works, and had\r\nbecome one of the partners; and now he no longer looked upon medicine\r\nas his chief vocation, though he still practised. In appearance he\r\nwas a pale, dark man in a white waistcoat, with a good figure; but\r\nto guess what there was in his heart and his brain was difficult.\r\nHe kissed Auntie Dasha\'s hand on greeting her, and was continually\r\nleaping up to set a chair or give his seat to some one. He was very\r\nsilent and grave all the while, and, when he did speak, it was for\r\nsome reason impossible to hear and understand his first sentence,\r\nthough he spoke correctly and not in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"You play the piano?" he asked Vera, and immediately leapt up, as\r\nshe had dropped her handkerchief.\r\n\r\nHe stayed from midday to midnight without speaking, and Vera found\r\nhim very unattractive. She thought that a white waistcoat in the\r\ncountry was bad form, and his elaborate politeness, his manners,\r\nand his pale, serious face with dark eyebrows, were mawkish; and\r\nit seemed to her that he was perpetually silent, probably because\r\nhe was stupid. When he had gone her aunt said enthusiastically:\r\n\r\n"Well? Isn\'t he charming?"\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAuntie Dasha looked after the estate. Tightly laced, with jingling\r\nbracelets on her wrists, she went into the kitchen, the granary,\r\nthe cattle-yard, tripping along with tiny steps, wriggling her\r\nspine; and whenever she talked to the steward or to the peasants,\r\nshe used, for some reason, to put on a pince-nez. Vera\'s grandfather\r\nalways sat in the same place, playing patience or dozing. He ate a\r\nvery great deal at dinner and supper; they gave him the dinner\r\ncooked to-day and what was left from yesterday, and cold pie left\r\nfrom Sunday, and salt meat from the servants\' dinner, and he ate\r\nit all greedily. And every dinner left on Vera such an impression,\r\nthat when she saw afterwards a flock of sheep driven by, or flour\r\nbeing brought from the mill, she thought, "Grandfather will eat\r\nthat." For the most part he was silent, absorbed in eating or in\r\npatience; but it sometimes happened at dinner that at the sight of\r\nVera he would be touched and say tenderly:\r\n\r\n"My only grandchild! Verotchka!"\r\n\r\nAnd tears would glisten in his eyes. Or his face would turn suddenly\r\ncrimson, his neck would swell, he would look with fury at the\r\nservants, and ask, tapping with his stick:\r\n\r\n"Why haven\'t you brought the horse-radish?"\r\n\r\nIn winter he led a perfectly inactive existence; in summer he\r\nsometimes drove out into the fields to look at the oats and the\r\nhay; and when he came back he would flourish his stick and declare\r\nthat everything was neglected now that he was not there to look\r\nafter it.\r\n\r\n"Your grandfather is out of humour," Auntie Dasha would whisper.\r\n"But it\'s nothing now to what it used to be in the old days:\r\n\'Twenty-five strokes! The birch!\'"\r\n\r\nHer aunt complained that every one had grown lazy, that no one did\r\nanything, and that the estate yielded no profit. Indeed, there was\r\nno systematic farming; they ploughed and sowed a little simply from\r\nhabit, and in reality did nothing and lived in idleness. Meanwhile\r\nthere was a running to and fro, reckoning and worrying all day long;\r\nthe bustle in the house began at five o\'clock in the morning; there\r\nwere continual sounds of "Bring it," "Fetch it," "Make haste," and\r\nby the evening the servants were utterly exhausted. Auntie Dasha\r\nchanged her cooks and her housemaids every week; sometimes she\r\ndischarged them for immorality; sometimes they went of their own\r\naccord, complaining that they were worked to death. None of the\r\nvillage people would come to the house as servants; Auntie Dasha\r\nhad to hire them from a distance. There was only one girl from the\r\nvillage living in the house, Alyona, and she stayed because her\r\nwhole family--old people and children--were living upon her\r\nwages. This Alyona, a pale, rather stupid little thing, spent the\r\nwhole day turning out the rooms, waiting at table, heating the\r\nstoves, sewing, washing; but it always seemed as though she were\r\nonly pottering about, treading heavily with her boots, and were\r\nnothing but a hindrance in the house. In her terror that she might\r\nbe dismissed and sent home, she often dropped and broke the crockery,\r\nand they stopped the value of it out of her wages, and then her\r\nmother and grandmother would come and bow down at Auntie Dasha\'s\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nOnce a week or sometimes oftener visitors would arrive. Her aunt\r\nwould come to Vera and say:\r\n\r\n"You should sit a little with the visitors, or else they\'ll think\r\nthat you are stuck up."\r\n\r\nVera would go in to the visitors and play _vint_ with them for hours\r\ntogether, or play the piano for the visitors to dance; her aunt,\r\nin high spirits and breathless from dancing, would come up and\r\nwhisper to her:\r\n\r\n"Be nice to Marya Nikiforovna."\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of December, St. Nikolay\'s Day, a large party of about\r\nthirty arrived all at once; they played _vint_ until late at night,\r\nand many of them stayed the night. In the morning they sat down to\r\ncards again, then they had dinner, and when Vera went to her room\r\nafter dinner to rest from conversation and tobacco smoke, there\r\nwere visitors there too, and she almost wept in despair. And when\r\nthey began to get ready to go in the evening, she was so pleased\r\nthey were going at last, that she said:\r\n\r\n"Do stay a little longer."\r\n\r\nShe felt exhausted by the visitors and constrained by their presence;\r\nyet every day, as soon as it began to grow dark, something drew her\r\nout of the house, and she went out to pay visits either at the works\r\nor at some neighbours\', and then there were cards, dancing, forfeits,\r\nsuppers. . . .The young people in the works or in the mines sometimes\r\nsang Little Russian songs, and sang them very well. It made one sad\r\nto hear them sing. Or they all gathered together in one room and\r\ntalked in the dusk of the mines, of the treasures that had once\r\nbeen buried in the steppes, of Saur\'s Grave. . . . Later on, as\r\nthey talked, a shout of "Help!" sometimes reached them. It was a\r\ndrunken man going home, or some one was being robbed by the pit\r\nnear by. Or the wind howled in the chimneys, the shutters banged;\r\nthen, soon afterwards, they would hear the uneasy church bell, as\r\nthe snow-storm began.\r\n\r\nAt all the evening parties, picnics, and dinners, Auntie Dasha was\r\ninvariably the most interesting woman and the doctor the most\r\ninteresting man. There was very little reading either at the works\r\nor at the country-houses; they played only marches and polkas; and\r\nthe young people always argued hotly about things they did not\r\nunderstand, and the effect was crude. The discussions were loud and\r\nheated, but, strange to say, Vera had nowhere else met people so\r\nindifferent and careless as these. They seemed to have no fatherland,\r\nno religion, no public interests. When they talked of literature\r\nor debated some abstract question, it could be seen from Dr.\r\nNeshtchapov\'s face that the question had no interest for him whatever,\r\nand that for long, long years he had read nothing and cared to read\r\nnothing. Serious and expressionless, like a badly painted portrait,\r\nfor ever in his white waistcoat, he was silent and incomprehensible\r\nas before; but the ladies, young and old, thought him interesting\r\nand were enthusiastic over his manners. They envied Vera, who\r\nappeared to attract him very much. And Vera always came away from\r\nthe visits with a feeling of vexation, vowing inwardly to remain\r\nat home; but the day passed, the evening came, and she hurried off\r\nto the works again, and it was like that almost all the winter.\r\n\r\nShe ordered books and magazines, and used to read them in her room.\r\nAnd she read at night, lying in bed. When the clock in the corridor\r\nstruck two or three, and her temples were beginning to ache from\r\nreading, she sat up in bed and thought, "What am I to do? Where am\r\nI to go?" Accursed, importunate question, to which there were a\r\nnumber of ready-made answers, and in reality no answer at all.\r\n\r\nOh, how noble, how holy, how picturesque it must be to serve the\r\npeople, to alleviate their sufferings, to enlighten them! But she,\r\nVera, did not know the people. And how could she go to them? They\r\nwere strange and uninteresting to her; she could not endure the\r\nstuffy smell of the huts, the pot-house oaths, the unwashed children,\r\nthe women\'s talk of illnesses. To walk over the snow-drifts, to\r\nfeel cold, then to sit in a stifling hut, to teach children she\r\ndisliked--no, she would rather die! And to teach the peasants\'\r\nchildren while Auntie Dasha made money out of the pot-houses and\r\nfined the peasants--it was too great a farce! What a lot of talk\r\nthere was of schools, of village libraries, of universal education;\r\nbut if all these engineers, these mine-owners and ladies of her\r\nacquaintance, had not been hypocrites, and really had believed that\r\nenlightenment was necessary, they would not have paid the schoolmasters\r\nfifteen roubles a month as they did now, and would not have let\r\nthem go hungry. And the schools and the talk about ignorance--it\r\nwas all only to stifle the voice of conscience because they were\r\nashamed to own fifteen or thirty thousand acres and to be indifferent\r\nto the peasants\' lot. Here the ladies said about Dr. Neshtchapov\r\nthat he was a kind man and had built a school at the works. Yes,\r\nhe had built a school out of the old bricks at the works for some\r\neight hundred roubles, and they sang the prayer for "long life" to\r\nhim when the building was opened, but there was no chance of his\r\ngiving up his shares, and it certainly never entered his head that\r\nthe peasants were human beings like himself, and that they, too,\r\nneeded university teaching, and not merely lessons in these wretched\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nAnd Vera felt full of anger against herself and every one else. She\r\ntook up a book again and tried to read it, but soon afterwards sat\r\ndown and thought again. To become a doctor? But to do that one must\r\npass an examination in Latin; besides, she had an invincible\r\nrepugnance to corpses and disease. It would be nice to become a\r\nmechanic, a judge, a commander of a steamer, a scientist; to do\r\nsomething into which she could put all her powers, physical and\r\nspiritual, and to be tired out and sleep soundly at night; to give\r\nup her life to something that would make her an interesting person,\r\nable to attract interesting people, to love, to have a real family\r\nof her own. . . . But what was she to do? How was she to begin?\r\n\r\nOne Sunday in Lent her aunt came into her room early in the morning\r\nto fetch her umbrella. Vera was sitting up in bed clasping her head\r\nin her hands, thinking.\r\n\r\n"You ought to go to church, darling," said her aunt, "or people\r\nwill think you are not a believer."\r\n\r\nVera made no answer.\r\n\r\n"I see you are dull, poor child," said Auntie Dasha, sinking on her\r\nknees by the bedside; she adored Vera. "Tell me the truth, are you\r\nbored?"\r\n\r\n"Dreadfully."\r\n\r\n"My beauty, my queen, I am your willing slave, I wish you nothing\r\nbut good and happiness. . . . Tell me, why don\'t you want to marry\r\nNestchapov? What more do you want, my child? You must forgive me,\r\ndarling; you can\'t pick and choose like this, we are not princes\r\n. . . . Time is passing, you are not seventeen. . . . And I don\'t\r\nunderstand it! He loves you, idolises you!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mercy!" said Vera with vexation. "How can I tell? He sits dumb\r\nand never says a word."\r\n\r\n"He\'s shy, darling. . . . He\'s afraid you\'ll refuse him!"\r\n\r\nAnd when her aunt had gone away, Vera remained standing in the\r\nmiddle of her room uncertain whether to dress or to go back to bed.\r\nThe bed was hateful; if one looked out of the window there were the\r\nbare trees, the grey snow, the hateful jackdaws, the pigs that her\r\ngrandfather would eat. . . .\r\n\r\n"Yes, after all, perhaps I\'d better get married!" she thought.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFor two days Auntie Dasha went about with a tear-stained and heavily\r\npowdered face, and at dinner she kept sighing and looking towards\r\nthe ikon. And it was impossible to make out what was the matter\r\nwith her. But at last she made up her mind, went in to Vera, and\r\nsaid in a casual way:\r\n\r\n"The fact is, child, we have to pay interest on the bank loan, and\r\nthe tenant hasn\'t paid his rent. Will you let me pay it out of the\r\nfifteen thousand your papa left you?"\r\n\r\nAll day afterwards Auntie Dasha spent in making cherry jam in the\r\ngarden. Alyona, with her cheeks flushed with the heat, ran to and\r\nfrom the garden to the house and back again to the cellar.\r\n\r\nWhen Auntie Dasha was making jam with a very serious face as though\r\nshe were performing a religious rite, and her short sleeves displayed\r\nher strong, little, despotic hands and arms, and when the servants\r\nran about incessantly, bustling about the jam which they would never\r\ntaste, there was always a feeling of martyrdom in the air. . . .\r\n\r\nThe garden smelt of hot cherries. The sun had set, the charcoal\r\nstove had been carried away, but the pleasant, sweetish smell still\r\nlingered in the air. Vera sat on a bench in the garden and watched\r\na new labourer, a young soldier, not of the neighbourhood, who was,\r\nby her express orders, making new paths. He was cutting the turf\r\nwith a spade and heaping it up on a barrow.\r\n\r\n"Where were you serving?" Vera asked him.\r\n\r\n"At Berdyansk."\r\n\r\n"And where are you going now? Home?"\r\n\r\n"No," answered the labourer. "I have no home."\r\n\r\n"But where were you born and brought up?"\r\n\r\n"In the province of Oryol. Till I went into the army I lived with\r\nmy mother, in my step-father\'s house; my mother was the head of the\r\nhouse, and people looked up to her, and while she lived I was cared\r\nfor. But while I was in the army I got a letter telling me my mother\r\nwas dead. . . . And now I don\'t seem to care to go home. It\'s not\r\nmy own father, so it\'s not like my own home."\r\n\r\n"Then your father is dead?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I am illegitimate."\r\n\r\nAt that moment Auntie Dasha appeared at the window and said:\r\n\r\n"_Il ne faut pas parler aux gens . . . ._ Go into the kitchen, my\r\ngood man. You can tell your story there," she said to the soldier.\r\n\r\nAnd then came as yesterday and every day supper, reading, a sleepless\r\nnight, and endless thinking about the same thing. At three o\'clock\r\nthe sun rose; Alyona was already busy in the corridor, and Vera was\r\nnot asleep yet and was trying to read. She heard the creak of the\r\nbarrow: it was the new labourer at work in the garden. . . . Vera\r\nsat at the open window with a book, dozed, and watched the soldier\r\nmaking the paths for her, and that interested her. The paths were\r\nas even and level as a leather strap, and it was pleasant to imagine\r\nwhat they would be like when they were strewn with yellow sand.\r\n\r\nShe could see her aunt come out of the house soon after five o\'clock,\r\nin a pink wrapper and curl-papers. She stood on the steps for three\r\nminutes without speaking, and then said to the soldier:\r\n\r\n"Take your passport and go in peace. I can\'t have any one illegitimate\r\nin my house."\r\n\r\nAn oppressive, angry feeling sank like a stone on Vera\'s heart. She\r\nwas indignant with her aunt, she hated her; she was so sick of her\r\naunt that her heart was full of misery and loathing. But what was\r\nshe to do? To stop her mouth? To be rude to her? But what would be\r\nthe use? Suppose she struggled with her, got rid of her, made her\r\nharmless, prevented her grandfather from flourishing his stick--\r\nwhat would be the use of it? It would be like killing one mouse or\r\none snake in the boundless steppe. The vast expanse, the long\r\nwinters, the monotony and dreariness of life, instil a sense of\r\nhelplessness; the position seems hopeless, and one wants to do\r\nnothing--everything is useless.\r\n\r\nAlyona came in, and bowing low to Vera, began carrying out the\r\narm-chairs to beat the dust out of them.\r\n\r\n"You have chosen a time to clean up," said Vera with annoyance. "Go\r\naway."\r\n\r\nAlyona was overwhelmed, and in her terror could not understand what\r\nwas wanted of her. She began hurriedly tidying up the dressing-table.\r\n\r\n"Go out of the room, I tell you," Vera shouted, turning cold; she\r\nhad never had such an oppressive feeling before. "Go away!"\r\n\r\nAlyona uttered a sort of moan, like a bird, and dropped Vera\'s gold\r\nwatch on the carpet.\r\n\r\n"Go away!" Vera shrieked in a voice not her own, leaping up and\r\ntrembling all over. "Send her away; she worries me to death!" she\r\nwent on, walking rapidly after Alyona down the passage, stamping\r\nher feet. "Go away! Birch her! Beat her!" Then suddenly she came\r\nto herself, and just as she was, unwashed, uncombed, in her\r\ndressing-gown and slippers, she rushed out of the house. She ran\r\nto the familiar ravine and hid herself there among the sloe-trees,\r\nso that she might see no one and be seen by no one. Lying there\r\nmotionless on the grass, she did not weep, she was not horror-stricken,\r\nbut gazing at the sky open-eyed, she reflected coldly and clearly\r\nthat something had happened which she could never forget and for\r\nwhich she could never forgive herself all her life.\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t go on like this," she thought. "It\'s time to take\r\nmyself in hand, or there\'ll be no end to it. . . . I can\'t go on\r\nlike this. . . ."\r\n\r\nAt midday Dr. Neshtchapov drove by the ravine on his way to the\r\nhouse. She saw him and made up her mind that she would begin a new\r\nlife, and that she would make herself begin it, and this decision\r\ncalmed her. And following with her eyes the doctor\'s well-built\r\nfigure, she said, as though trying to soften the crudity of her\r\ndecision:\r\n\r\n"He\'s a nice man. . . . We shall get through life somehow."\r\n\r\nShe returned home. While she was dressing, Auntie Dasha came into\r\nthe room, and said:\r\n\r\n"Alyona upset you, darling; I\'ve sent her home to the village. Her\r\nmother\'s given her a good beating and has come here, crying."\r\n\r\n"Auntie," said Vera quickly, "I\'m going to marry Dr. Neshtchapov.\r\nOnly talk to him yourself . . . I can\'t."\r\n\r\nAnd again she went out into the fields. And wandering aimlessly\r\nabout, she made up her mind that when she was married she would\r\nlook after the house, doctor the peasants, teach in the school,\r\nthat she would do all the things that other women of her circle\r\ndid. And this perpetual dissatisfaction with herself and every one\r\nelse, this series of crude mistakes which stand up like a mountain\r\nbefore one whenever one looks back upon one\'s past, she would accept\r\nas her real life to which she was fated, and she would expect nothing\r\nbetter. . . . Of course there was nothing better! Beautiful nature,\r\ndreams, music, told one story, but reality another. Evidently truth\r\nand happiness existed somewhere outside real life. . . . One must\r\ngive up one\'s own life and merge oneself into this luxuriant steppe,\r\nboundless and indifferent as eternity, with its flowers, its ancient\r\nbarrows, and its distant horizon, and then it would be well with\r\none. . . .\r\n\r\nA month later Vera was living at the works.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENSIVE LESSONS\r\n\r\nFOR a cultivated man to be ignorant of foreign languages is a great\r\ninconvenience. Vorotov became acutely conscious of it when, after\r\ntaking his degree, he began upon a piece of research work.\r\n\r\n"It\'s awful," he said, breathing hard (although he was only twenty-six\r\nhe was fat, heavy, and suffered from shortness of breath).\r\n\r\n"It\'s awful! Without languages I\'m like a bird without wings. I\r\nmight just as well give up the work."\r\n\r\nAnd he made up his mind at all costs to overcome his innate laziness,\r\nand to learn French and German; and began to look out for a teacher.\r\n\r\nOne winter noon, as Vorotov was sitting in his study at work, the\r\nservant told him that a young lady was inquiring for him.\r\n\r\n"Ask her in," said Vorotov.\r\n\r\nAnd a young lady elaborately dressed in the last fashion walked in.\r\nShe introduced herself as a teacher of French, Alice Osipovna\r\nEnquete, and told Vorotov that she had been sent to him by one of\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\n"Delighted! Please sit down," said Vorotov, breathing hard and\r\nputting his hand over the collar of his nightshirt (to breathe more\r\nfreely he always wore a nightshirt at work instead of a stiff linen\r\none with collar). "It was Pyotr Sergeitch sent you? Yes, yes . . .\r\nI asked him about it. Delighted!"\r\n\r\nAs he talked to Mdlle. Enquete he looked at her shyly and with\r\ncuriosity. She was a genuine Frenchwoman, very elegant and still\r\nquite young. Judging from her pale, languid face, her short curly\r\nhair, and her unnaturally slim waist, she might have been eighteen;\r\nbut looking at her broad, well-developed shoulders, the elegant\r\nlines of her back and her severe eyes, Vorotov thought that she was\r\nnot less than three-and-twenty and might be twenty-five; but then\r\nagain he began to think she was not more than eighteen. Her face\r\nlooked as cold and business-like as the face of a person who has\r\ncome to speak about money. She did not once smile or frown, and\r\nonly once a look of perplexity flitted over her face when she learnt\r\nthat she was not required to teach children, but a stout grown-up\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"So, Alice Osipovna," said Vorotov, "we\'ll have a lesson every\r\nevening from seven to eight. As regards your terms--a rouble a\r\nlesson--I\'ve nothing to say against that. By all means let it be\r\na rouble. . . ."\r\n\r\nAnd he asked her if she would not have some tea or coffee, whether\r\nit was a fine day, and with a good-natured smile, stroking the baize\r\nof the table, he inquired in a friendly voice who she was, where\r\nshe had studied, and what she lived on.\r\n\r\nWith a cold, business-like expression, Alice Osipovna answered that\r\nshe had completed her studies at a private school and had the diploma\r\nof a private teacher, that her father had died lately of scarlet\r\nfever, that her mother was alive and made artificial flowers; that\r\nshe, Mdlle. Enquete, taught in a private school till dinnertime,\r\nand after dinner was busy till evening giving lessons in different\r\ngood families.\r\n\r\nShe went away leaving behind her the faint fragrance of a woman\'s\r\nclothes. For a long time afterwards Vorotov could not settle to\r\nwork, but, sitting at the table stroking its green baize surface,\r\nhe meditated.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very pleasant to see a girl working to earn her own living,"\r\nhe thought. "On the other hand, it\'s very unpleasant to think that\r\npoverty should not spare such elegant and pretty girls as Alice\r\nOsipovna, and that she, too, should have to struggle for existence.\r\nIt\'s a sad thing!"\r\n\r\nHaving never seen virtuous Frenchwomen before, he reflected also\r\nthat this elegantly dressed young lady with her well-developed\r\nshoulders and exaggeratedly small waist in all probability followed\r\nanother calling as well as giving French lessons.\r\n\r\nThe next evening when the clock pointed to five minutes to seven,\r\nMdlle. Enquete appeared, rosy from the frost. She opened Margot,\r\nwhich she had brought with her, and without introduction began:\r\n\r\n"French grammar has twenty-six letters. The first letter is called\r\n_A_, the second _B_ . . ."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," Vorotov interrupted, smiling. "I must warn you,\r\nmademoiselle, that you must change your method a little in my case.\r\nYou see, I know Russian, Greek, and Latin well. . . . I\'ve studied\r\ncomparative philology, and I think we might omit Margot and pass\r\nstraight to reading some author."\r\n\r\nAnd he explained to the French girl how grown-up people learn\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n"A friend of mine," he said, "wanting to learn modern languages,\r\nlaid before him the French, German, and Latin gospels, and read\r\nthem side by side, carefully analysing each word, and would you\r\nbelieve it, he attained his object in less than a year. Let us do\r\nthe same. We\'ll take some author and read him."\r\n\r\nThe French girl looked at him in perplexity. Evidently the suggestion\r\nseemed to her very naive and ridiculous. If this strange proposal\r\nhad been made to her by a child, she would certainly have been angry\r\nand have scolded it, but as he was a grown-up man and very stout\r\nand she could not scold him, she only shrugged her shoulders hardly\r\nperceptibly and said:\r\n\r\n"As you please."\r\n\r\nVorotov rummaged in his bookcase and picked out a dog\'s-eared French\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n"Will this do?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all the same," she said.\r\n\r\n"In that case let us begin, and good luck to it! Let\'s begin with\r\nthe title . . . \'Memoires.\'"\r\n\r\n"Reminiscences," Mdlle. Enquete translated.\r\n\r\nWith a good-natured smile, breathing hard, he spent a quarter of\r\nan hour over the word "Memoires," and as much over the word _de_,\r\nand this wearied the young lady. She answered his questions languidly,\r\ngrew confused, and evidently did not understand her pupil well, and\r\ndid not attempt to understand him. Vorotov asked her questions, and\r\nat the same time kept looking at her fair hair and thinking:\r\n\r\n"Her hair isn\'t naturally curly; she curls it. It\'s a strange thing!\r\nShe works from morning to night, and yet she has time to curl her\r\nhair."\r\n\r\nAt eight o\'clock precisely she got up, and saying coldly and dryly,\r\n"Au revoir, monsieur," walked out of the study, leaving behind her\r\nthe same tender, delicate, disturbing fragrance. For a long time\r\nagain her pupil did nothing; he sat at the table meditating.\r\n\r\nDuring the days that followed he became convinced that his teacher\r\nwas a charming, conscientious, and precise young lady, but that she\r\nwas very badly educated, and incapable of teaching grown-up people,\r\nand he made up his mind not to waste his time, to get rid of her,\r\nand to engage another teacher. When she came the seventh time he\r\ntook out of his pocket an envelope with seven roubles in it, and\r\nholding it in his hand, became very confused and began:\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Alice Osipovna, but I ought to tell you . . . I\'m under\r\npainful necessity . . ."\r\n\r\nSeeing the envelope, the French girl guessed what was meant, and\r\nfor the first time during their lessons her face quivered and her\r\ncold, business-like expression vanished. She coloured a little, and\r\ndropping her eyes, began nervously fingering her slender gold chain.\r\nAnd Vorotov, seeing her perturbation, realised how much a rouble\r\nmeant to her, and how bitter it would be to her to lose what she\r\nwas earning.\r\n\r\n"I ought to tell you," he muttered, growing more and more confused,\r\nand quavering inwardly; he hurriedly stuffed the envelope into his\r\npocket and went on: "Excuse me, I . . . I must leave you for ten\r\nminutes."\r\n\r\nAnd trying to appear as though he had not in the least meant to get\r\nrid of her, but only to ask her permission to leave her for a short\r\ntime, he went into the next room and sat there for ten minutes. And\r\nthen he returned more embarrassed than ever: it struck him that she\r\nmight have interpreted his brief absence in some way of her own,\r\nand he felt awkward.\r\n\r\nThe lessons began again. Yorotov felt no interest in them. Realising\r\nthat he would gain nothing from the lessons, he gave the French\r\ngirl liberty to do as she liked, asking her nothing and not\r\ninterrupting her. She translated away as she pleased ten pages\r\nduring a lesson, and he did not listen, breathed hard, and having\r\nnothing better to do, gazed at her curly head, or her soft white\r\nhands or her neck and sniffed the fragrance of her clothes. He\r\ncaught himself thinking very unsuitable thoughts, and felt ashamed,\r\nor he was moved to tenderness, and then he felt vexed and wounded\r\nthat she was so cold and business-like with him, and treated him\r\nas a pupil, never smiling and seeming afraid that he might accidentally\r\ntouch her. He kept wondering how to inspire her with confidence and\r\nget to know her better, and to help her, to make her understand how\r\nbadly she taught, poor thing.\r\n\r\nOne day Mdlle. Enquete came to the lesson in a smart pink dress,\r\nslightly _decollete_, and surrounded by such a fragrance that she\r\nseemed to be wrapped in a cloud, and, if one blew upon her, ready\r\nto fly away into the air or melt away like smoke. She apologised\r\nand said she could stay only half an hour for the lesson, as she\r\nwas going straight from the lesson to a dance.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her throat and the back of her bare neck, and thought\r\nhe understood why Frenchwomen had the reputation of frivolous\r\ncreatures easily seduced; he was carried away by this cloud of\r\nfragrance, beauty, and bare flesh, while she, unconscious of his\r\nthoughts and probably not in the least interested in them, rapidly\r\nturned over the pages and translated at full steam:\r\n\r\n"\'He was walking the street and meeting a gentleman his friend and\r\nsaying, "Where are you striving to seeing your face so pale it makes\r\nme sad."\'"\r\n\r\nThe "Memoires" had long been finished, and now Alice was translating\r\nsome other book. One day she came an hour too early for the lesson,\r\napologizing and saying that she wanted to leave at seven and go to\r\nthe Little Theatre. Seeing her out after the lesson, Vorotov dressed\r\nand went to the theatre himself. He went, and fancied that he was\r\ngoing simply for change and amusement, and that he was not thinking\r\nabout Alice at all. He could not admit that a serious man, preparing\r\nfor a learned career, lethargic in his habits, could fling up his\r\nwork and go to the theatre simply to meet there a girl he knew very\r\nlittle, who was unintelligent and utterly unintellectual.\r\n\r\nYet for some reason his heart was beating during the intervals, and\r\nwithout realizing what he was doing, he raced about the corridors\r\nand foyer like a boy impatiently looking for some one, and he was\r\ndisappointed when the interval was over. And when he saw the familiar\r\npink dress and the handsome shoulders under the tulle, his heart\r\nquivered as though with a foretaste of happiness; he smiled joyfully,\r\nand for the first time in his life experienced the sensation of\r\njealousy.\r\n\r\nAlice was walking with two unattractive-looking students and an\r\nofficer. She was laughing, talking loudly, and obviously flirting.\r\nVorotov had never seen her like that. She was evidently happy,\r\ncontented, warm, sincere. What for? Why? Perhaps because these men\r\nwere her friends and belonged to her own circle. And Vorotov felt\r\nthere was a terrible gulf between himself and that circle. He bowed\r\nto his teacher, but she gave him a chilly nod and walked quickly\r\nby; she evidently did not care for her friends to know that she had\r\npupils, and that she had to give lessons to earn money.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting at the theatre Vorotov realised that he was in\r\nlove. . . . During the subsequent lessons he feasted his eyes on\r\nhis elegant teacher, and without struggling with himself, gave full\r\nrein to his imaginations, pure and impure. Mdlle. Enquete\'s face\r\ndid not cease to be cold; precisely at eight o\'clock every evening\r\nshe said coldly, "Au revoir, monsieur," and he felt she cared nothing\r\nabout him, and never would care anything about him, and that his\r\nposition was hopeless.\r\n\r\nSometimes in the middle of a lesson he would begin dreaming, hoping,\r\nmaking plans. He inwardly composed declarations of love, remembered\r\nthat Frenchwomen were frivolous and easily won, but it was enough\r\nfor him to glance at the face of his teacher for his ideas to be\r\nextinguished as a candle is blown out when you bring it into the\r\nwind on the verandah. Once, overcome, forgetting himself as though\r\nin delirium, he could not restrain himself, and barred her way as\r\nshe was going from the study into the entry after the lesson, and,\r\ngasping for breath and stammering, began to declare his love:\r\n\r\n"You are dear to me! I . . . I love you! Allow me to speak."\r\n\r\nAnd Alice turned pale--probably from dismay, reflecting that after\r\nthis declaration she could not come here again and get a rouble a\r\nlesson. With a frightened look in her eyes she said in a loud\r\nwhisper:\r\n\r\n"Ach, you mustn\'t! Don\'t speak, I entreat you! You mustn\'t!"\r\n\r\nAnd Vorotov did not sleep all night afterwards; he was tortured by\r\nshame; he blamed himself and thought intensely. It seemed to him\r\nthat he had insulted the girl by his declaration, that she would\r\nnot come to him again.\r\n\r\nHe resolved to find out her address from the address bureau in the\r\nmorning, and to write her a letter of apology. But Alice came without\r\na letter. For the first minute she felt uncomfortable, then she\r\nopened a book and began briskly and rapidly translating as usual:\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, young gentleman, don\'t tear those flowers in my garden which\r\nI want to be giving to my ill daughter. . . .\'"\r\n\r\nShe still comes to this day. Four books have already been translated,\r\nbut Vorotov knows no French but the word "Memoires," and when he\r\nis asked about his literary researches, he waves his hand, and\r\nwithout answering, turns the conversation to the weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCESS\r\n\r\nA CARRIAGE with four fine sleek horses drove in at the big so-called\r\nRed Gate of the N--- Monastery. While it was still at a distance,\r\nthe priests and monks who were standing in a group round the part\r\nof the hostel allotted to the gentry, recognised by the coachman\r\nand horses that the lady in the carriage was Princess Vera Gavrilovna,\r\nwhom they knew very well.\r\n\r\nAn old man in livery jumped off the box and helped the princess to\r\nget out of the carriage. She raised her dark veil and moved in a\r\nleisurely way up to the priests to receive their blessing; then she\r\nnodded pleasantly to the rest of the monks and went into the hostel.\r\n\r\n"Well, have you missed your princess?" she said to the monk who\r\nbrought in her things. "It\'s a whole month since I\'ve been to see\r\nyou. But here I am; behold your princess. And where is the Father\r\nSuperior? My goodness, I am burning with impatience! Wonderful,\r\nwonderful old man! You must be proud of having such a Superior."\r\n\r\nWhen the Father Superior came in, the princess uttered a shriek of\r\ndelight, crossed her arms over her bosom, and went up to receive\r\nhis blessing.\r\n\r\n"No, no, let me kiss your hand," she said, snatching it and eagerly\r\nkissing it three times. "How glad I am to see you at last, holy\r\nFather! I\'m sure you\'ve forgotten your princess, but my thoughts\r\nhave been in your dear monastery every moment. How delightful it\r\nis here! This living for God far from the busy, giddy world has a\r\nspecial charm of its own, holy Father, which I feel with my whole\r\nsoul although I cannot express it!"\r\n\r\nThe princess\'s cheeks glowed and tears came into her eyes. She\r\ntalked incessantly, fervently, while the Father Superior, a grave,\r\nplain, shy old man of seventy, remained mute or uttered abruptly,\r\nlike a soldier on duty, phrases such as:\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Your Excellency. . . . Quite so. I understand."\r\n\r\n"Has Your Excellency come for a long stay?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"I shall stay the night here, and to-morrow I\'m going on to Klavdia\r\nNikolaevna\'s--it\'s a long time since I\'ve seen her--and the day\r\nafter to-morrow I\'ll come back to you and stay three or four days.\r\nI want to rest my soul here among you, holy Father. . . ."\r\n\r\nThe princess liked being at the monastery at N---. For the last two\r\nyears it had been a favourite resort of hers; she used to go there\r\nalmost every month in the summer and stay two or three days, even\r\nsometimes a week. The shy novices, the stillness, the low ceilings,\r\nthe smell of cypress, the modest fare, the cheap curtains on the\r\nwindows--all this touched her, softened her, and disposed her to\r\ncontemplation and good thoughts. It was enough for her to be half\r\nan hour in the hostel for her to feel that she, too, was timid and\r\nmodest, and that she, too, smelt of cypress-wood. The past retreated\r\ninto the background, lost its significance, and the princess began\r\nto imagine that in spite of her twenty-nine years she was very much\r\nlike the old Father Superior, and that, like him, she was created\r\nnot for wealth, not for earthly grandeur and love, but for a peaceful\r\nlife secluded from the world, a life in twilight like the hostel.\r\n\r\nIt happens that a ray of light gleams in the dark cell of the\r\nanchorite absorbed in prayer, or a bird alights on the window and\r\nsings its song; the stern anchorite will smile in spite of himself,\r\nand a gentle, sinless joy will pierce through the load of grief\r\nover his sins, like water flowing from under a stone. The princess\r\nfancied she brought from the outside world just such comfort as the\r\nray of light or the bird. Her gay, friendly smile, her gentle eyes,\r\nher voice, her jests, her whole personality in fact, her little\r\ngraceful figure always dressed in simple black, must arouse in\r\nsimple, austere people a feeling of tenderness and joy. Every one,\r\nlooking at her, must think: "God has sent us an angel. . . ." And\r\nfeeling that no one could help thinking this, she smiled still more\r\ncordially, and tried to look like a bird.\r\n\r\nAfter drinking tea and resting, she went for a walk. The sun was\r\nalready setting. From the monastery garden came a moist fragrance\r\nof freshly watered mignonette, and from the church floated the soft\r\nsinging of men\'s voices, which seemed very pleasant and mournful\r\nin the distance. It was the evening service. In the dark windows\r\nwhere the little lamps glowed gently, in the shadows, in the figure\r\nof the old monk sitting at the church door with a collecting-box,\r\nthere was such unruffled peace that the princess felt moved to\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nOutside the gate, in the walk between the wall and the birch-trees\r\nwhere there were benches, it was quite evening. The air grew rapidly\r\ndarker and darker. The princess went along the walk, sat on a seat,\r\nand sank into thought.\r\n\r\nShe thought how good it would be to settle down for her whole life\r\nin this monastery where life was as still and unruffled as a summer\r\nevening; how good it would be to forget the ungrateful, dissipated\r\nprince; to forget her immense estates, the creditors who worried\r\nher every day, her misfortunes, her maid Dasha, who had looked at\r\nher impertinently that morning. It would be nice to sit here on the\r\nbench all her life and watch through the trunks of the birch-trees\r\nthe evening mist gathering in wreaths in the valley below; the rooks\r\nflying home in a black cloud like a veil far, far away above the\r\nforest; two novices, one astride a piebald horse, another on foot\r\ndriving out the horses for the night and rejoicing in their freedom,\r\nplaying pranks like little children; their youthful voices rang out\r\nmusically in the still air, and she could distinguish every word.\r\nIt is nice to sit and listen to the silence: at one moment the wind\r\nblows and stirs the tops of the birch-trees, then a frog rustles\r\nin last year\'s leaves, then the clock on the belfry strikes the\r\nquarter. . . . One might sit without moving, listen and think, and\r\nthink. . . .\r\n\r\nAn old woman passed by with a wallet on her back. The princess\r\nthought that it would be nice to stop the old woman and to say\r\nsomething friendly and cordial to her, to help her. . . . But the\r\nold woman turned the corner without once looking round.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards a tall man with a grey beard and a straw hat\r\ncame along the walk. When he came up to the princess, he took off\r\nhis hat and bowed. From the bald patch on his head and his sharp,\r\nhooked nose the princess recognised him as the doctor, Mihail\r\nIvanovitch, who had been in her service at Dubovki. She remembered\r\nthat some one had told her that his wife had died the year before,\r\nand she wanted to sympathise with him, to console him.\r\n\r\n"Doctor, I expect you don\'t recognise me?" she said with an affable\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Princess, I recognised you," said the doctor, taking off his\r\nhat again.\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you; I was afraid that you, too, had forgotten your\r\nprincess. People only remember their enemies, but they forget their\r\nfriends. Have you, too, come to pray?"\r\n\r\n"I am the doctor here, and I have to spend the night at the monastery\r\nevery Saturday."\r\n\r\n"Well, how are you?" said the princess, sighing. "I hear that you\r\nhave lost your wife. What a calamity!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Princess, for me it is a great calamity."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing for it! We must bear our troubles with resignation.\r\nNot one hair of a man\'s head is lost without the Divine Will."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Princess."\r\n\r\nTo the princess\'s friendly, gentle smile and her sighs the doctor\r\nresponded coldly and dryly: "Yes, Princess." And the expression of\r\nhis face was cold and dry.\r\n\r\n"What else can I say to him?" she wondered.\r\n\r\n"How long it is since we met!" she said. "Five years! How much water\r\nhas flowed under the bridge, how many changes in that time; it quite\r\nfrightens one to think of it! You know, I am married. . . . I am\r\nnot a countess now, but a princess. And by now I am separated from\r\nmy husband too."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I heard so."\r\n\r\n"God has sent me many trials. No doubt you have heard, too, that I\r\nam almost ruined. My Dubovki, Sofyino, and Kiryakovo have all been\r\nsold for my unhappy husband\'s debts. And I have only Baranovo and\r\nMihaltsevo left. It\'s terrible to look back: how many changes and\r\nmisfortunes of all kinds, how many mistakes!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Princess, many mistakes."\r\n\r\nThe princess was a little disconcerted. She knew her mistakes; they\r\nwere all of such a private character that no one but she could think\r\nor speak of them. She could not resist asking:\r\n\r\n"What mistakes are you thinking about?"\r\n\r\n"You referred to them, so you know them . . ." answered the doctor,\r\nand he smiled. "Why talk about them!"\r\n\r\n"No; tell me, doctor. I shall be very grateful to you. And please\r\ndon\'t stand on ceremony with me. I love to hear the truth."\r\n\r\n"I am not your judge, Princess."\r\n\r\n"Not my judge! What a tone you take! You must know something about\r\nme. Tell me!"\r\n\r\n"If you really wish it, very well. Only I regret to say I\'m not\r\nclever at talking, and people can\'t always understand me."\r\n\r\nThe doctor thought a moment and began:\r\n\r\n"A lot of mistakes; but the most important of them, in my opinion,\r\nwas the general spirit that prevailed on all your estates. You see,\r\nI don\'t know how to express myself. I mean chiefly the lack of love,\r\nthe aversion for people that was felt in absolutely everything.\r\nYour whole system of life was built upon that aversion. Aversion\r\nfor the human voice, for faces, for heads, steps . . . in fact, for\r\neverything that makes up a human being. At all the doors and on the\r\nstairs there stand sleek, rude, and lazy grooms in livery to prevent\r\nbadly dressed persons from entering the house; in the hall there\r\nare chairs with high backs so that the footmen waiting there, during\r\nballs and receptions, may not soil the walls with their heads; in\r\nevery room there are thick carpets that no human step may be heard;\r\nevery one who comes in is infallibly warned to speak as softly and\r\nas little as possible, and to say nothing that might have a\r\ndisagreeable effect on the nerves or the imagination. And in your\r\nroom you don\'t shake hands with any one or ask him to sit down--\r\njust as you didn\'t shake hands with me or ask me to sit down. . . ."\r\n\r\n"By all means, if you like," said the princess, smiling and holding\r\nout her hand. "Really, to be cross about such trifles. . . ."\r\n\r\n"But I am not cross," laughed the doctor, but at once he flushed,\r\ntook off his hat, and waving it about, began hotly: "To be candid,\r\nI\'ve long wanted an opportunity to tell you all I think. . . . That\r\nis, I want to tell you that you look upon the mass of mankind from\r\nthe Napoleonic standpoint as food for the cannon. But Napoleon had\r\nat least some idea; you have nothing except aversion."\r\n\r\n"I have an aversion for people?" smiled the princess, shrugging her\r\nshoulders in astonishment. "I have!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you! You want facts? By all means. In Mihaltsevo three former\r\ncooks of yours, who have gone blind in your kitchens from the heat\r\nof the stove, are living upon charity. All the health and strength\r\nand good looks that is found on your hundreds of thousands of acres\r\nis taken by you and your parasites for your grooms, your footmen,\r\nand your coachmen. All these two-legged cattle are trained to be\r\nflunkeys, overeat themselves, grow coarse, lose the \'image and\r\nlikeness,\' in fact. . . . Young doctors, agricultural experts,\r\nteachers, intellectual workers generally--think of it!--are\r\ntorn away from their honest work and forced for a crust of bread\r\nto take part in all sorts of mummeries which make every decent man\r\nfeel ashamed! Some young men cannot be in your service for three\r\nyears without becoming hypocrites, toadies, sneaks. . . . Is that\r\na good thing? Your Polish superintendents, those abject spies, all\r\nthose Kazimers and Kaetans, go hunting about on your hundreds of\r\nthousands of acres from morning to night, and to please you try to\r\nget three skins off one ox. Excuse me, I speak disconnectedly, but\r\nthat doesn\'t matter. You don\'t look upon the simple people as human\r\nbeings. And even the princes, counts, and bishops who used to come\r\nand see you, you looked upon simply as decorative figures, not as\r\nliving beings. But the worst of all, the thing that most revolts\r\nme, is having a fortune of over a million and doing nothing for\r\nother people, nothing!"\r\n\r\nThe princess sat amazed, aghast, offended, not knowing what to say\r\nor how to behave. She had never before been spoken to in such a\r\ntone. The doctor\'s unpleasant, angry voice and his clumsy, faltering\r\nphrases made a harsh clattering noise in her ears and her head.\r\nThen she began to feel as though the gesticulating doctor was hitting\r\nher on the head with his hat.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not true!" she articulated softly, in an imploring voice.\r\n"I\'ve done a great deal of good for other people; you know it\r\nyourself!"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" cried the doctor. "Can you possibly go on thinking of\r\nyour philanthropic work as something genuine and useful, and not a\r\nmere mummery? It was a farce from beginning to end; it was playing\r\nat loving your neighbour, the most open farce which even children\r\nand stupid peasant women saw through! Take for instance your--\r\nwhat was it called?--house for homeless old women without relations,\r\nof which you made me something like a head doctor, and of which you\r\nwere the patroness. Mercy on us! What a charming institution it\r\nwas! A house was built with parquet floors and a weathercock on the\r\nroof; a dozen old women were collected from the villages and made\r\nto sleep under blankets and sheets of Dutch linen, and given toffee\r\nto eat."\r\n\r\nThe doctor gave a malignant chuckle into his hat, and went on\r\nspeaking rapidly and stammering:\r\n\r\n"It was a farce! The attendants kept the sheets and the blankets\r\nunder lock and key, for fear the old women should soil them--\'Let\r\nthe old devil\'s pepper-pots sleep on the floor.\' The old women did\r\nnot dare to sit down on the beds, to put on their jackets, to walk\r\nover the polished floors. Everything was kept for show and hidden\r\naway from the old women as though they were thieves, and the old\r\nwomen were clothed and fed on the sly by other people\'s charity,\r\nand prayed to God night and day to be released from their prison\r\nand from the canting exhortations of the sleek rascals to whose\r\ncare you committed them. And what did the managers do? It was simply\r\ncharming! About twice a week there would be thirty-five thousand\r\nmessages to say that the princess--that is, you--were coming\r\nto the home next day. That meant that next day I had to abandon my\r\npatients, dress up and be on parade. Very good; I arrive. The old\r\nwomen, in everything clean and new, are already drawn up in a row,\r\nwaiting. Near them struts the old garrison rat--the superintendent\r\nwith his mawkish, sneaking smile. The old women yawn and exchange\r\nglances, but are afraid to complain. We wait. The junior steward\r\ngallops up. Half an hour later the senior steward; then the\r\nsuperintendent of the accounts\' office, then another, and then\r\nanother of them . . . they keep arriving endlessly. They all have\r\nmysterious, solemn faces. We wait and wait, shift from one leg to\r\nanother, look at the clock--all this in monumental silence because\r\nwe all hate each other like poison. One hour passes, then a second,\r\nand then at last the carriage is seen in the distance, and . . .\r\nand . . ."\r\n\r\nThe doctor went off into a shrill laugh and brought out in a shrill\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n"You get out of the carriage, and the old hags, at the word of\r\ncommand from the old garrison rat, begin chanting: \'The Glory of\r\nour Lord in Zion the tongue of man cannot express. . .\' A pretty\r\nscene, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor went off into a bass chuckle, and waved his hand as\r\nthough to signify that he could not utter another word for laughing.\r\nHe laughed heavily, harshly, with clenched teeth, as ill-natured\r\npeople laugh; and from his voice, from his face, from his glittering,\r\nrather insolent eyes it could be seen that he had a profound contempt\r\nfor the princess, for the home, and for the old women. There was\r\nnothing amusing or laughable in all that he described so clumsily\r\nand coarsely, but he laughed with satisfaction, even with delight.\r\n\r\n"And the school?" he went on, panting from laughter. "Do you remember\r\nhow you wanted to teach peasant children yourself? You must have\r\ntaught them very well, for very soon the children all ran away, so\r\nthat they had to be thrashed and bribed to come and be taught. And\r\nyou remember how you wanted to feed with your own hands the infants\r\nwhose mothers were working in the fields. You went about the village\r\ncrying because the infants were not at your disposal, as the mothers\r\nwould take them to the fields with them. Then the village foreman\r\nordered the mothers by turns to leave their infants behind for your\r\nentertainment. A strange thing! They all ran away from your benevolence\r\nlike mice from a cat! And why was it? It\'s very simple. Not because\r\nour people are ignorant and ungrateful, as you always explained it\r\nto yourself, but because in all your fads, if you\'ll excuse the\r\nword, there wasn\'t a ha\'p\'orth of love and kindness! There was\r\nnothing but the desire to amuse yourself with living puppets, nothing\r\nelse. . . . A person who does not feel the difference between a\r\nhuman being and a lap-dog ought not to go in for philanthropy. I\r\nassure you, there\'s a great difference between human beings and\r\nlap-dogs!"\r\n\r\nThe princess\'s heart was beating dreadfully; there was a thudding\r\nin her ears, and she still felt as though the doctor were beating\r\nher on the head with his hat. The doctor talked quickly, excitedly,\r\nand uncouthly, stammering and gesticulating unnecessarily. All she\r\ngrasped was that she was spoken to by a coarse, ill-bred, spiteful,\r\nand ungrateful man; but what he wanted of her and what he was talking\r\nabout, she could not understand.\r\n\r\n"Go away!" she said in a tearful voice, putting up her hands to\r\nprotect her head from the doctor\'s hat; "go away!"\r\n\r\n"And how you treat your servants!" the doctor went on, indignantly.\r\n"You treat them as the lowest scoundrels, and don\'t look upon them\r\nas human beings. For example, allow me to ask, why did you dismiss\r\nme? For ten years I worked for your father and afterwards for you,\r\nhonestly, without vacations or holidays. I gained the love of all\r\nfor more than seventy miles round, and suddenly one fine day I am\r\ninformed that I am no longer wanted. What for? I\'ve no idea to this\r\nday. I, a doctor of medicine, a gentleman by birth, a student of\r\nthe Moscow University, father of a family--am such a petty,\r\ninsignificant insect that you can kick me out without explaining\r\nthe reason! Why stand on ceremony with me! I heard afterwards that\r\nmy wife went without my knowledge three times to intercede with you\r\nfor me--you wouldn\'t receive her. I am told she cried in your\r\nhall. And I shall never forgive her for it, never!"\r\n\r\nThe doctor paused and clenched his teeth, making an intense effort\r\nto think of something more to say, very unpleasant and vindictive.\r\nHe thought of something, and his cold, frowning face suddenly\r\nbrightened.\r\n\r\n"Take your attitude to this monastery!" he said with avidity. "You\'ve\r\nnever spared any one, and the holier the place, the more chance of\r\nits suffering from your loving-kindness and angelic sweetness. Why\r\ndo you come here? What do you want with the monks here, allow me\r\nto ask you? What is Hecuba to you or you to Hecuba? It\'s another\r\nfarce, another amusement for you, another sacrilege against human\r\ndignity, and nothing more. Why, you don\'t believe in the monks\'\r\nGod; you\'ve a God of your own in your heart, whom you\'ve evolved\r\nfor yourself at spiritualist seances. You look with condescension\r\nupon the ritual of the Church; you don\'t go to mass or vespers; you\r\nsleep till midday. . . . Why do you come here? . . . You come with\r\na God of your own into a monastery you have nothing to do with, and\r\nyou imagine that the monks look upon it as a very great honour. To\r\nbe sure they do! You\'d better ask, by the way, what your visits\r\ncost the monastery. You were graciously pleased to arrive here this\r\nevening, and a messenger from your estate arrived on horseback the\r\nday before yesterday to warn them of your coming. They were the\r\nwhole day yesterday getting the rooms ready and expecting you. This\r\nmorning your advance-guard arrived--an insolent maid, who keeps\r\nrunning across the courtyard, rustling her skirts, pestering them\r\nwith questions, giving orders. . . . I can\'t endure it! The monks\r\nhave been on the lookout all day, for if you were not met with due\r\nceremony, there would be trouble! You\'d complain to the bishop!\r\n\'The monks don\'t like me, your holiness; I don\'t know what I\'ve\r\ndone to displease them. It\'s true I\'m a great sinner, but I\'m so\r\nunhappy!\' Already one monastery has been in hot water over you. The\r\nFather Superior is a busy, learned man; he hasn\'t a free moment,\r\nand you keep sending for him to come to your rooms. Not a trace of\r\nrespect for age or for rank! If at least you were a bountiful giver\r\nto the monastery, one wouldn\'t resent it so much, but all this time\r\nthe monks have not received a hundred roubles from you!"\r\n\r\nWhenever people worried the princess, misunderstood her, or mortified\r\nher, and when she did not know what to say or do, she usually began\r\nto cry. And on this occasion, too, she ended by hiding her face in\r\nher hands and crying aloud in a thin treble like a child. The doctor\r\nsuddenly stopped and looked at her. His face darkened and grew\r\nstern.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, Princess," he said in a hollow voice. "I\'ve given way\r\nto a malicious feeling and forgotten myself. It was not right."\r\n\r\nAnd coughing in an embarrassed way, he walked away quickly, without\r\nremembering to put his hat on.\r\n\r\nStars were already twinkling in the sky. The moon must have been\r\nrising on the further side of the monastery, for the sky was clear,\r\nsoft, and transparent. Bats were flitting noiselessly along the\r\nwhite monastery wall.\r\n\r\nThe clock slowly struck three quarters, probably a quarter to nine.\r\nThe princess got up and walked slowly to the gate. She felt wounded\r\nand was crying, and she felt that the trees and the stars and even\r\nthe bats were pitying her, and that the clock struck musically only\r\nto express its sympathy with her. She cried and thought how nice\r\nit would be to go into a monastery for the rest of her life. On\r\nstill summer evenings she would walk alone through the avenues,\r\ninsulted, injured, misunderstood by people, and only God and the\r\nstarry heavens would see the martyr\'s tears. The evening service\r\nwas still going on in the church. The princess stopped and listened\r\nto the singing; how beautiful the singing sounded in the still\r\ndarkness! How sweet to weep and suffer to the sound of that singing!\r\n\r\nGoing into her rooms, she looked at her tear-stained face in the\r\nglass and powdered it, then she sat down to supper. The monks knew\r\nthat she liked pickled sturgeon, little mushrooms, Malaga and plain\r\nhoney-cakes that left a taste of cypress in the mouth, and every\r\ntime she came they gave her all these dishes. As she ate the mushrooms\r\nand drank the Malaga, the princess dreamed of how she would be\r\nfinally ruined and deserted--how all her stewards, bailiffs,\r\nclerks, and maid-servants for whom she had done so much, would be\r\nfalse to her, and begin to say rude things; how people all the world\r\nover would set upon her, speak ill of her, jeer at her. She would\r\nrenounce her title, would renounce society and luxury, and would\r\ngo into a convent without one word of reproach to any one; she would\r\npray for her enemies--and then they would all understand her and\r\ncome to beg her forgiveness, but by that time it would be too\r\nlate. . . .\r\n\r\nAfter supper she knelt down in the corner before the ikon and read\r\ntwo chapters of the Gospel. Then her maid made her bed and she got\r\ninto it. Stretching herself under the white quilt, she heaved a\r\nsweet, deep sigh, as one sighs after crying, closed her eyes, and\r\nbegan to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning she waked up and glanced at her watch. It was half-past\r\nnine. On the carpet near the bed was a bright, narrow streak of\r\nsunlight from a ray which came in at the window and dimly lighted\r\nup the room. Flies were buzzing behind the black curtain at the\r\nwindow. "It\'s early," thought the princess, and she closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nStretching and lying snug in her bed, she recalled her meeting\r\nyesterday with the doctor and all the thoughts with which she had\r\ngone to sleep the night before: she remembered she was unhappy.\r\nThen she thought of her husband living in Petersburg, her stewards,\r\ndoctors, neighbours, the officials of her acquaintance . . . a long\r\nprocession of familiar masculine faces passed before her imagination.\r\nShe smiled and thought, if only these people could see into her\r\nheart and understand her, they would all be at her feet.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past eleven she called her maid.\r\n\r\n"Help me to dress, Dasha," she said languidly. "But go first and\r\ntell them to get out the horses. I must set off for Klavdia\r\nNikolaevna\'s."\r\n\r\nGoing out to get into the carriage, she blinked at the glaring\r\ndaylight and laughed with pleasure: it was a wonderfully fine day!\r\nAs she scanned from her half-closed eyes the monks who had gathered\r\nround the steps to see her off, she nodded graciously and said:\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, my friends! Till the day after tomorrow."\r\n\r\nIt was an agreeable surprise to her that the doctor was with the\r\nmonks by the steps. His face was pale and severe.\r\n\r\n"Princess," he said with a guilty smile, taking off his hat, "I\'ve\r\nbeen waiting here a long time to see you. Forgive me, for God\'s\r\nsake. . . . I was carried away yesterday by an evil, vindictive\r\nfeeling and I talked . . . nonsense. In short, I beg your pardon."\r\n\r\nThe princess smiled graciously, and held out her hand for him to\r\nkiss. He kissed it, turning red.\r\n\r\nTrying to look like a bird, the princess fluttered into the carriage\r\nand nodded in all directions. There was a gay, warm, serene feeling\r\nin her heart, and she felt herself that her smile was particularly\r\nsoft and friendly. As the carriage rolled towards the gates, and\r\nafterwards along the dusty road past huts and gardens, past long\r\ntrains of waggons and strings of pilgrims on their way to the\r\nmonastery, she still screwed up her eyes and smiled softly. She was\r\nthinking there was no higher bliss than to bring warmth, light, and\r\njoy wherever one went, to forgive injuries, to smile graciously on\r\none\'s enemies. The peasants she passed bowed to her, the carriage\r\nrustled softly, clouds of dust rose from under the wheels and floated\r\nover the golden rye, and it seemed to the princess that her body\r\nwas swaying not on carriage cushions but on clouds, and that she\r\nherself was like a light, transparent little cloud. . . .\r\n\r\n"How happy I am!" she murmured, shutting her eyes. "How happy I\r\nam!"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMIST\'S WIFE\r\n\r\nTHE little town of B----, consisting of two or three crooked streets,\r\nwas sound asleep. There was a complete stillness in the motionless\r\nair. Nothing could be heard but far away, outside the town no doubt,\r\nthe barking of a dog in a thin, hoarse tenor. It was close upon\r\ndaybreak.\r\n\r\nEverything had long been asleep. The only person not asleep was the\r\nyoung wife of Tchernomordik, a qualified dispenser who kept a\r\nchemist\'s shop at B----. She had gone to bed and got up again three\r\ntimes, but could not sleep, she did not know why. She sat at the\r\nopen window in her nightdress and looked into the street. She felt\r\nbored, depressed, vexed . . . so vexed that she felt quite inclined\r\nto cry--again she did not know why. There seemed to be a lump in\r\nher chest that kept rising into her throat. . . . A few paces behind\r\nher Tchernomordik lay curled up close to the wall, snoring sweetly.\r\nA greedy flea was stabbing the bridge of his nose, but he did not\r\nfeel it, and was positively smiling, for he was dreaming that every\r\none in the town had a cough, and was buying from him the King of\r\nDenmark\'s cough-drops. He could not have been wakened now by pinpricks\r\nor by cannon or by caresses.\r\n\r\nThe chemist\'s shop was almost at the extreme end of the town, so\r\nthat the chemist\'s wife could see far into the fields. She could\r\nsee the eastern horizon growing pale by degrees, then turning crimson\r\nas though from a great fire. A big broad-faced moon peeped out\r\nunexpectedly from behind bushes in the distance. It was red (as a\r\nrule when the moon emerges from behind bushes it appears to be\r\nblushing).\r\n\r\nSuddenly in the stillness of the night there came the sounds of\r\nfootsteps and a jingle of spurs. She could hear voices.\r\n\r\n"That must be the officers going home to the camp from the Police\r\nCaptain\'s," thought the chemist\'s wife.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards two figures wearing officers\' white tunics came\r\ninto sight: one big and tall, the other thinner and shorter. . . .\r\nThey slouched along by the fence, dragging one leg after the other\r\nand talking loudly together. As they passed the chemist\'s shop,\r\nthey walked more slowly than ever, and glanced up at the windows.\r\n\r\n"It smells like a chemist\'s," said the thin one. "And so it is! Ah,\r\nI remember. . . . I came here last week to buy some castor-oil.\r\nThere\'s a chemist here with a sour face and the jawbone of an ass!\r\nSuch a jawbone, my dear fellow! It must have been a jawbone like\r\nthat Samson killed the Philistines with."\r\n\r\n"M\'yes," said the big one in a bass voice. "The pharmacist is asleep.\r\nAnd his wife is asleep too. She is a pretty woman, Obtyosov."\r\n\r\n"I saw her. I liked her very much. . . . Tell me, doctor, can she\r\npossibly love that jawbone of an ass? Can she?"\r\n\r\n"No, most likely she does not love him," sighed the doctor, speaking\r\nas though he were sorry for the chemist. "The little woman is asleep\r\nbehind the window, Obtyosov, what? Tossing with the heat, her little\r\nmouth half open . . . and one little foot hanging out of bed. I bet\r\nthat fool the chemist doesn\'t realise what a lucky fellow he is. . . .\r\nNo doubt he sees no difference between a woman and a bottle of\r\ncarbolic!"\r\n\r\n"I say, doctor," said the officer, stopping. "Let us go into the\r\nshop and buy something. Perhaps we shall see her."\r\n\r\n"What an idea--in the night!"\r\n\r\n"What of it? They are obliged to serve one even at night. My dear\r\nfellow, let us go in!"\r\n\r\n"If you like. . . ."\r\n\r\nThe chemist\'s wife, hiding behind the curtain, heard a muffled ring.\r\nLooking round at her husband, who was smiling and snoring sweetly\r\nas before, she threw on her dress, slid her bare feet into her\r\nslippers, and ran to the shop.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the glass door she could see two shadows. The\r\nchemist\'s wife turned up the lamp and hurried to the door to open\r\nit, and now she felt neither vexed nor bored nor inclined to cry,\r\nthough her heart was thumping. The big doctor and the slender\r\nObtyosov walked in. Now she could get a view of them. The doctor\r\nwas corpulent and swarthy; he wore a beard and was slow in his\r\nmovements. At the slightest motion his tunic seemed as though it\r\nwould crack, and perspiration came on to his face. The officer was\r\nrosy, clean-shaven, feminine-looking, and as supple as an English\r\nwhip.\r\n\r\n"What may I give you?" asked the chemist\'s wife, holding her dress\r\nacross her bosom.\r\n\r\n"Give us . . . er-er . . . four pennyworth of peppermint lozenges!"\r\n\r\nWithout haste the chemist\'s wife took down a jar from a shelf and\r\nbegan weighing out lozenges. The customers stared fixedly at her\r\nback; the doctor screwed up his eyes like a well-fed cat, while the\r\nlieutenant was very grave.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the first time I\'ve seen a lady serving in a chemist\'s shop,"\r\nobserved the doctor.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing out of the way in it," replied the chemist\'s wife,\r\nlooking out of the corner of her eye at the rosy-cheeked officer.\r\n"My husband has no assistant, and I always help him."\r\n\r\n"To be sure. . . . You have a charming little shop! What a number\r\nof different . . . jars! And you are not afraid of moving about\r\namong the poisons? Brrr!"\r\n\r\nThe chemist\'s wife sealed up the parcel and handed it to the doctor.\r\nObtyosov gave her the money. Half a minute of silence followed. . . .\r\nThe men exchanged glances, took a step towards the door, then\r\nlooked at one another again.\r\n\r\n"Will you give me two pennyworth of soda?" said the doctor.\r\n\r\nAgain the chemist\'s wife slowly and languidly raised her hand to\r\nthe shelf.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you in the shop anything . . . such as . . ." muttered\r\nObtyosov, moving his fingers, "something, so to say, allegorical\r\n. . . revivifying . . . seltzer-water, for instance. Have you any\r\nseltzer-water?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered the chemist\'s wife.\r\n\r\n"Bravo! You\'re a fairy, not a woman! Give us three bottles!"\r\n\r\nThe chemist\'s wife hurriedly sealed up the soda and vanished through\r\nthe door into the darkness.\r\n\r\n"A peach!" said the doctor, with a wink. "You wouldn\'t find a\r\npineapple like that in the island of Madeira! Eh? What do you say?\r\nDo you hear the snoring, though? That\'s his worship the chemist\r\nenjoying sweet repose."\r\n\r\nA minute later the chemist\'s wife came back and set five bottles\r\non the counter. She had just been in the cellar, and so was flushed\r\nand rather excited.\r\n\r\n"Sh-sh! . . . quietly!" said Obtyosov when, after uncorking the\r\nbottles, she dropped the corkscrew. "Don\'t make such a noise; you\'ll\r\nwake your husband."\r\n\r\n"Well, what if I do wake him?"\r\n\r\n"He is sleeping so sweetly . . . he must be dreaming of you. . . .\r\nTo your health!"\r\n\r\n"Besides," boomed the doctor, hiccupping after the seltzer-water,\r\n"husbands are such a dull business that it would be very nice of\r\nthem to be always asleep. How good a drop of red wine would be in\r\nthis water!"\r\n\r\n"What an idea!" laughed the chemist\'s wife.\r\n\r\n"That would be splendid. What a pity they don\'t sell spirits in\r\nchemist\'s shops! Though you ought to sell wine as a medicine. Have\r\nyou any _vinum gallicum rubrum_?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, give us some! Bring it here, damn it!"\r\n\r\n"How much do you want?"\r\n\r\n"_Quantum satis_. . . . Give us an ounce each in the water, and\r\nafterwards we\'ll see. . . . Obtyosov, what do you say? First with\r\nwater and afterwards _per se_. . . ."\r\n\r\nThe doctor and Obtyosov sat down to the counter, took off their\r\ncaps, and began drinking the wine.\r\n\r\n"The wine, one must admit, is wretched stuff! _Vinum nastissimum!_\r\nThough in the presence of . . . er . . . it tastes like nectar. You\r\nare enchanting, madam! In imagination I kiss your hand."\r\n\r\n"I would give a great deal to do so not in imagination," said\r\nObtyosov. "On my honour, I\'d give my life."\r\n\r\n"That\'s enough," said Madame Tchernomordik, flushing and assuming\r\na serious expression.\r\n\r\n"What a flirt you are, though!" the doctor laughed softly, looking\r\nslyly at her from under his brows. "Your eyes seem to be firing\r\nshot: piff-paff! I congratulate you: you\'ve conquered! We are\r\nvanquished!"\r\n\r\nThe chemist\'s wife looked at their ruddy faces, listened to their\r\nchatter, and soon she, too, grew quite lively. Oh, she felt so gay!\r\nShe entered into the conversation, she laughed, flirted, and even,\r\nafter repeated requests from the customers, drank two ounces of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n"You officers ought to come in oftener from the camp," she said;\r\n"it\'s awful how dreary it is here. I\'m simply dying of it."\r\n\r\n"I should think so!" said the doctor indignantly. "Such a peach, a\r\nmiracle of nature, thrown away in the wilds! How well Griboyedov\r\nsaid, \'Into the wilds, to Saratov\'! It\'s time for us to be off,\r\nthough. Delighted to have made your acquaintance . . . very. How\r\nmuch do we owe you?"\r\n\r\nThe chemist\'s wife raised her eyes to the ceiling and her lips moved\r\nfor some time.\r\n\r\n"Twelve roubles forty-eight kopecks," she said.\r\n\r\nObtyosov took out of his pocket a fat pocket-book, and after fumbling\r\nfor some time among the notes, paid.\r\n\r\n"Your husband\'s sleeping sweetly . . . he must be dreaming," he\r\nmuttered, pressing her hand at parting.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to hear silly remarks. . . ."\r\n\r\n"What silly remarks? On the contrary, it\'s not silly at all . . .\r\neven Shakespeare said: \'Happy is he who in his youth is young.\'"\r\n\r\n"Let go of my hand."\r\n\r\nAt last after much talk and after kissing the lady\'s hand at parting,\r\nthe customers went out of the shop irresolutely, as though they\r\nwere wondering whether they had not forgotten something.\r\n\r\nShe ran quickly into the bedroom and sat down in the same place.\r\nShe saw the doctor and the officer, on coming out of the shop, walk\r\nlazily away a distance of twenty paces; then they stopped and began\r\nwhispering together. What about? Her heart throbbed, there was a\r\npulsing in her temples, and why she did not know. . . . Her heart\r\nbeat violently as though those two whispering outside were deciding\r\nher fate.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later the doctor parted from Obtyosov and walked on,\r\nwhile Obtyosov came back. He walked past the shop once and a second\r\ntime. . . . He would stop near the door and then take a few steps\r\nagain. At last the bell tinkled discreetly.\r\n\r\n"What? Who is there?" the chemist\'s wife heard her husband\'s voice\r\nsuddenly. "There\'s a ring at the bell, and you don\'t hear it," he\r\nsaid severely. "Is that the way to do things?"\r\n\r\nHe got up, put on his dressing-gown, and staggering, half asleep,\r\nflopped in his slippers to the shop.\r\n\r\n"What . . . is it?" he asked Obtyosov.\r\n\r\n"Give me . . . give me four pennyworth of peppermint lozenges."\r\n\r\nSniffing continually, yawning, dropping asleep as he moved, and\r\nknocking his knees against the counter, the chemist went to the\r\nshelf and reached down the jar.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later the chemist\'s wife saw Obtyosov go out of the\r\nshop, and, after he had gone some steps, she saw him throw the\r\npacket of peppermints on the dusty road. The doctor came from behind\r\na corner to meet him. . . . They met and, gesticulating, vanished\r\nin the morning mist.\r\n\r\n"How unhappy I am!" said the chemist\'s wife, looking angrily at her\r\nhusband, who was undressing quickly to get into bed again. "Oh, how\r\nunhappy I am!" she repeated, suddenly melting into bitter tears.\r\n"And nobody knows, nobody knows. . . ."\r\n\r\n"I forgot fourpence on the counter," muttered the chemist, pulling\r\nthe quilt over him. "Put it away in the till, please. . . ."\r\n\r\nAnd at once he fell asleep again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DUEL AND OTHER STORIES***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 13505.txt or 13505.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/3/5/0/13505\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
