I believe this is the first English country house you\r\nhave stayed at, Miss Worsley?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  We have not many.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady\r\nCaroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as\r\nbig as France and England put together.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.\r\n[_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of\r\nmy always knitting mufflers for you if you won\xe2\x80\x99t wear them?\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to a more\r\ncharming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively\r\ndamp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a\r\nlittle lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane\r\nmixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high\r\ndistinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of\r\nParliament, Mr. Kettle\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his\r\nname before in the whole course of one\xe2\x80\x99s life, which speaks volumes for a\r\nman, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like\r\nyourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are\r\ninvited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord\r\nBrancaster\xe2\x80\x99s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she\r\nwas married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve she ran away more than once.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady\r\nHunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to\r\nhave taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is\r\nright in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,\r\none never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not\r\nconsidered the thing.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  In America those are the people we respect most.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I have no doubt of it.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so\r\nsincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come\r\nacross.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young\r\nlady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.\r\nEnglish women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They\r\nshow them then.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young\r\nman and a young girl?\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a\r\ncushion_.]\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying\r\nwhat a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful\r\npower of selection.  It is quite a gift.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit\r\nin very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will\r\ncarry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.  [_To\r\nFootman_.]  The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland.\r\nGet the Shetland.  [_Exit Footman for shawl_.]\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord\r\nIllingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.  It\r\nmeans a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear mother will be\r\ndelighted.  I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.\r\nDo you think she would, Gerald?  I know how difficult it is to get her to\r\ngo anywhere.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord\r\nIllingworth had made me such an offer.\r\n\r\n[_Enter Footman with shawl_.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come\r\nup and meet him.  [_To Footman_.]  Just wait, Francis.  [_Writes\r\nletter_.]\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as\r\nyou are, Mr. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show\r\nmyself worthy of it.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I trust so.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  [_To_ HESTER.]  _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss\r\nWorsley.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Are you very pleased about it?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Of course I am.  It means everything to me\xe2\x80\x94things that were out\r\nof the reach of hope before may be within hope\xe2\x80\x99s reach now.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.  Life is a hope.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord\r\nIllingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that\r\nmay not be true.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that England should be represented abroad\r\nby an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you are too\r\nnervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I was in hopes he\r\nwould have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he said her family was too\r\nlarge.  Or was it her feet?  I forget which.  I regret it very much.  She\r\nwas made to be an ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s names, and forgetting their faces.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?  [_To\r\nFootman_.]  Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a line to\r\nyour dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she\r\nreally must come to dinner.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Footman_.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.  [_To_ HESTER.]\r\nWill you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  With pleasure.  [_Exit with_ GERALD.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nfortune.  He is quite a _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_ of mine.  And I am particularly pleased\r\nthat Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord\r\nwithout my suggesting anything.  Nobody likes to be asked favours.  I\r\nremember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season,\r\nbecause she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to me.\r\nIt was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking to be in\r\nany respectable household.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to\r\nget rid of her.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that explains it.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, the grass is too damp for you.  You had better go\r\nand put on your overshoes at once.\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  You must allow me to be the best judge of that, John.\r\nPray do as I tell you.\r\n\r\n[SIR JOHN _gets up and goes off_.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\r\n\r\n[_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  Well, dear, I hope you like the park.  It is said\r\nto be well timbered.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Quite, quite wonderful.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country\r\nfor six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take\r\nthe slightest notice of me.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I assure you, dear, that the country has not that\r\neffect at all.  Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from\r\nhere, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.  I remember the\r\noccurrence perfectly.  Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of\r\njoy, or gout.  I forget which.  We had a large party staying here at the\r\ntime, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I think to elope is cowardly.  It\xe2\x80\x99s running away from\r\ndanger.  And danger has become so rare in modern life.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can make out, the young women of the present\r\nday seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing\r\nwith fire.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is\r\nthat one never gets even singed.  It is the people who don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to\r\nplay with it who get burned up.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the world would get on with such a\r\ntheory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Ah!  The world was made for men and not for women.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Lady Stutfield.  We have a much better\r\ntime than they have.  There are far more things forbidden to us than are\r\nforbidden to them.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; that is quite, quite true.  I had not thought of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.  It has\r\nbeen an arduous task.  The demands on the time of a public man are very\r\nheavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.  And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they meet with\r\nadequate recognition.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, have you got your overshoes on?\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN.  Yes, my love.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think you had better come over here, John.  It is more\r\nsheltered.\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  You had better sit beside me.  [SIR\r\nJOHN _rises and goes across_.]\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been writing about this morning, Mr.\r\nKelvil?\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield.  On Purity.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That must be such a very, very interesting thing to\r\nwrite about.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  It is the one subject of really national importance, nowadays,\r\nLady Stutfield.  I purpose addressing my constituents on the question\r\nbefore Parliament meets.  I find that the poorer classes of this country\r\ndisplay a marked desire for a higher ethical standard.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How quite, quite nice of them.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Are you in favour of women taking part in politics, Mr.\r\nKettle?\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in\r\nour political life, Lady Caroline.  Women are always on the side of\r\nmorality, public and private.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It is so very, very gratifying to hear you say that.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes!\xe2\x80\x94the moral qualities in women\xe2\x80\x94that is the\r\nimportant thing.  I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord Illingworth\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t value the moral qualities in women as much as he should.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, very\r\nwicked.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  But what world says that, Lady Stutfield?  It must be\r\nthe next world.  This world and I are on excellent terms.  [_Sits down\r\nbeside_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Every one _I_ know says you are very, very wicked.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about,\r\nnowadays, saying things against one behind one\xe2\x80\x99s back that are absolutely\r\nand entirely true.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless, Lady\r\nStutfield.  I have given up trying to reform him.  It would take a Public\r\nCompany with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that.  But\r\nyou have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?  Gerald\r\nArbuthnot has told us of his good fortune; it is really most kind of you.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Lady Hunstanton.  Kind is a\r\ndreadful word.  I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I met\r\nhim, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be of considerable use to me in something I am foolish\r\nenough to think of doing.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  He is an admirable young man.  And his mother is one of\r\nmy dearest friends.  He has just gone for a walk with our pretty\r\nAmerican.  She is very pretty, is she not?\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Far too pretty.  These American girls carry off all the\r\ngood matches.  Why can\xe2\x80\x99t they stay in their own country?  They are always\r\ntelling us it is the Paradise of women.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is, Lady Caroline.  That is why, like Eve, they are\r\nso extremely anxious to get out of it.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Who are Miss Worsley\xe2\x80\x99s parents?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American women are wonderfully clever in concealing\r\ntheir parents.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean?  Miss\r\nWorsley, Caroline, is an orphan.  Her father was a very wealthy\r\nmillionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained my son\r\nquite hospitably, when he visited Boston.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how he made his\r\nmoney, originally.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  I fancy in American dry goods.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are American dry goods?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American novels.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How very singular! . . . Well, from whatever source her\r\nlarge fortune came, I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley.  She dresses\r\nexceedingly well.  All Americans do dress well.  They get their clothes\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans die\r\nthey go to Paris.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Indeed?  And when bad Americans die, where do they go\r\nto?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, they go to America.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  I am afraid you don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate America, Lord Illingworth.  It\r\nis a very remarkable country, especially considering its youth.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The youth of America is their oldest tradition.  It\r\nhas been going on now for three hundred years.  To hear them talk one\r\nwould imagine they were in their first childhood.  As far as civilisation\r\ngoes they are in their second.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in American\r\npolitics.  I suppose you allude to that?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I wonder.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.  They\r\ncertainly are in England.  Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country.  I\r\nwonder Mrs. Cardew allows him.  I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I think they are the only people who should.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  Do you take no side then in modern politics, Lord Illingworth?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil.\r\nTaking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows\r\nshortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore.  However, the\r\nHouse of Commons really does very little harm.  You can\xe2\x80\x99t make people\r\ngood by Act of Parliament,\xe2\x80\x94that is something.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown great\r\nsympathy with the sufferings of the poor.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is its special vice.  That is the special vice of\r\nthe age.  One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of\r\nlife.  The less said about life\xe2\x80\x99s sores the better, Mr. Kelvil.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  Still our East End is a very important problem.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  It is the problem of slavery.  And we are\r\ntrying to solve it by amusing the slaves.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, a great deal may be done by means of cheap\r\nentertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth.  Dear Dr. Daubeny, our\r\nrector here, provides, with the assistance of his curates, really\r\nadmirable recreations for the poor during the winter.  And much good may\r\nbe done by means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some popular\r\namusement of that kind.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not at all in favour of amusements for the poor,\r\nJane.  Blankets and coals are sufficient.  There is too much love of\r\npleasure amongst the upper classes as it is.  Health is what we want in\r\nmodern life.  The tone is not healthy, not healthy at all.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  You are quite right, Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I believe I am usually right.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Horrid word \xe2\x80\x98health.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Silliest word in our language, and one knows so well\r\nthe popular idea of health.  The English country gentleman galloping\r\nafter a fox\xe2\x80\x94the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House of Lords as\r\na better institution than the House of Commons?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A much better institution, of course.  We in the House\r\nof Lords are never in touch with public opinion.  That makes us a\r\ncivilised body.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  Are you serious in putting forward such a view?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\r\nVulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after one has\r\ngiven them an idea, whether one is serious or not.  Nothing is serious\r\nexcept passion.  The intellect is not a serious thing, and never has\r\nbeen.  It is an instrument on which one plays, that is all.  The only\r\nserious form of intellect I know is the British intellect.  And on the\r\nBritish intellect the illiterates play the drum.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are you saying, Lord Illingworth, about the drum?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about the leading\r\narticles in the London newspapers.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you believe all that is written in the\r\nnewspapers?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do.  Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs.\r\n[_Rises with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Are you going, Mrs. Allonby?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Just as far as the conservatory.  Lord Illingworth told me\r\nthis morning that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven\r\ndeadly sins.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind.  I will\r\ncertainly speak to the gardener.\r\n\r\n[_Exit_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She lets her clever tongue run away with her sometimes.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows to run\r\naway with her?\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope so, Caroline, I am sure.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.]\r\n\r\nDear Lord Alfred, do join us.  [LORD ALFRED _sits down beside_ LADY\r\nSTUTFIELD.]\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  You believe good of every one, Jane.  It is a great\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, that one\r\nshould believe evil of every one?\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think it is much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield.\r\nUntil, of course, people are found out to be good.  But that requires a\r\ngreat deal of investigation nowadays.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But there is so much unkind scandal in modern life.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner that\r\nthe basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant man, but he\r\nseems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and purity\r\nof life which is so important in this century.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, quite, quite important, is it not?\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  He gives me the impression of a man who does not appreciate the\r\nbeauty of our English home-life.  I would say that he was tainted with\r\nforeign ideas on the subject.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of home-life,\r\nis there?\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  It is the mainstay of our moral system in England, Lady\r\nStutfield.  Without it we would become like our neighbours.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That would be so, so sad, would it not?\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards woman simply as\r\na toy.  Now, I have never regarded woman as a toy.  Woman is the\r\nintellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life.  Without her\r\nwe should forget the true ideals.  [_Sits down beside_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I am so very, very glad to hear you say that.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  You a married man, Mr. Kettle?\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, dear, Kelvil.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  I am married, Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Family?\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  Yes.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  How many?\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  Eight.\r\n\r\n[LADY STUTFIELD _turns her attention to_ LORD ALFRED.]\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at the\r\nseaside?  [SIR JOHN _shrugs his shoulders_.]\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  My wife is at the seaside with the children, Lady Caroline.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  You will join them later on, no doubt?\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  If my public engagements permit me.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Your public life must be a great source of gratification\r\nto Mrs. Kettle.\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_To_ LORD ALFRED.]  How very, very charming those\r\ngold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord Alfred.\r\n\r\nLORD ALFRED.  They are awfully expensive.  I can only afford them when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m in debt.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be in debt.\r\n\r\nLORD ALFRED.  One must have some occupation nowadays.  If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t my\r\ndebts I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to think about.  All the chaps I know are\r\nin debt.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But don\xe2\x80\x99t the people to whom you owe the money give you\r\na great, great deal of annoyance?\r\n\r\n[_Enter Footman_.]\r\n\r\nLORD ALFRED.  Oh, no, they write; I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very strange.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot.  She won\xe2\x80\x99t dine.  I am so sorry.  But she will come in the\r\nevening.  I am very pleased indeed.  She is one of the sweetest of women.\r\nWrites a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm.  [_Hands letter to_ LADY\r\nCAROLINE.]\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Looking at it_.]  A little lacking in femininity, Jane.\r\nFemininity is the quality I admire most in women.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Taking back letter and leaving it on table_.]  Oh!\r\nshe is very feminine, Caroline, and so good too.  You should hear what\r\nthe Archdeacon says of her.  He regards her as his right hand in the\r\nparish.  [_Footman speaks to her_.]  In the Yellow Drawing-room.  Shall\r\nwe all go in?  Lady Stutfield, shall we go in to tea?\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton.  [_They rise and proceed\r\nto go off_.  SIR JOHN offers to carry LADY STUTFIELD\xe2\x80\x99S cloak.]\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!  If you would allow your nephew to look after Lady\r\nStutfield\xe2\x80\x99s cloak, you might help me with my workbasket.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN.  Certainly, my love.  [_Exeunt_.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Curious thing, plain women are always jealous of their\r\nhusbands, beautiful women never are!\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Beautiful women never have time.  They are always so\r\noccupied in being jealous of other people\xe2\x80\x99s husbands.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should have thought Lady Caroline would have grown tired\r\nof conjugal anxiety by this time!  Sir John is her fourth!\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So much marriage is certainly not becoming.  Twenty\r\nyears of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of\r\nmarriage make her something like a public building.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Twenty years of romance!  Is there such a thing?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Not in our day.  Women have become too brilliant.\r\nNothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Or the want of it in the man.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are quite right.  In a Temple every one should be\r\nserious, except the thing that is worshipped.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And that should be man?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Women kneel so gracefully; men don\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for\r\nthe last quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Is she such a mystery?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is more than a mystery\xe2\x80\x94she is a mood.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Moods don\xe2\x80\x99t last.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is their chief charm.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me, Lady\r\nHunstanton and Lady Caroline, and . . . every one.  I hope I shall make a\r\ngood secretary.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald.  [_Talks to\r\nhim_.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You enjoy country life, Miss Worsley?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Very much indeed.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t find yourself longing for a London dinner-party?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  I dislike London dinner-parties.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I adore them.  The clever people never listen, and the\r\nstupid people never talk.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  I think the stupid people talk a great deal.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, I never listen!\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like you I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made\r\nyou the offer.  It is because I like you so much that I want to have you\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\n[_Exit_ HESTER _with_ GERALD.]\r\n\r\nCharming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot!\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He is very nice; very nice indeed.  But I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand the\r\nAmerican young lady.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud voice too, that\r\nshe was only eighteen.  It was most annoying.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never trust a woman who tells one her real\r\nage.  A woman who would tell one that, would tell one anything.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She is a Puritan besides\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah, that is inexcusable.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind plain women\r\nbeing Puritans.  It is the only excuse they have for being plain.  But\r\nshe is decidedly pretty.  I admire her immensely.  [_Looks steadfastly\r\nat_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a thoroughly bad man you must be!\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you call a bad man?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The sort of man who admires innocence.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And a bad woman?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are severe\xe2\x80\x94on yourself.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Define us as a sex.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Sphinxes without secrets.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Does that include the Puritan women?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the existence of\r\nPuritan women?  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is a woman in the world who would not\r\nbe a little flattered if one made love to her.  It is that which makes\r\nwomen so irresistibly adorable.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You think there is no woman in the world who would object\r\nto being kissed?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Very few.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you sure?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Quite.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you think she\xe2\x80\x99d do if I kissed her?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her\r\nglove.  What would you do if she struck you across the face with her\r\nglove?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Fall in love with her, probably.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her!\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Is that a challenge?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is an arrow shot into the air.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that I always succeed in whatever I\r\ntry?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I am sorry to hear it.  We women adore failures.  They\r\nlean on us.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You worship successes.  You cling to them.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We are the laurels to hide their baldness.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And they need you always, except at the moment of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They are uninteresting then.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How tantalising you are!  [_A pause_.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like\r\nyou for.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only one thing?  And I have so many bad qualities.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, don\xe2\x80\x99t be too conceited about them.  You may lose them\r\nas you grow old.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I never intend to grow old.  The soul is born old but\r\ngrows young.  That is the comedy of life.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And the body is born young and grows old.  That is life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Its comedy also, sometimes.  But what is the\r\nmysterious reason why you will always like me?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is that you have never made love to me.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have never done anything else.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Really?  I have not noticed it.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How fortunate!  It might have been a tragedy for both\r\nof us.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We should each have survived.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One can survive everything nowadays, except death, and\r\nlive down anything except a good reputation.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Have you tried a good reputation?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of the many annoyances to which I have never\r\nbeen subjected.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It may come.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why do you threaten me?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan.\r\n\r\n[_Enter Footman_.]\r\n\r\nFRANCIS.  Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Tell her ladyship we are coming in.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS.  Yes, my lord.\r\n\r\n[_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Shall we go in to tea?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you like such simple pleasures?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I adore simple pleasures.  They are the last refuge of\r\nthe complex.  But, if you wish, let us stay here.  Yes, let us stay here.\r\nThe Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It ends with Revelations.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You fence divinely.  But the button has come off your\r\nfoil.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I have still the mask.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It makes your eyes lovelier.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Thank you.  Come.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT\xe2\x80\x99S _letter on table_, _and takes\r\nit up and looks at envelope_.]  What a curious handwriting!  It reminds\r\nme of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Who?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! no one.  No one in particular.  A woman of no\r\nimportance.  [_Throws letter down_, _and passes up the steps of the\r\nterrace with_ MRS. ALLONBY.  _They smile at each other_.]\r\n\r\n                                ACT DROP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ACT\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  SCENE\r\n\r\n _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.\r\n                               _Door_ R.C.\r\n\r\n[_Ladies seated on sofas_.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a\r\nlittle!\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly\r\nhappy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman\xe2\x80\x99s duty never to\r\nleave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing\r\nspace after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be\r\nabsolutely worn to shadows.\r\n\r\n[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up\r\nto the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to\r\nescape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their\r\npower and use it.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense\r\nall this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnot married?\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a\r\nwife.  It\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going\r\nabout society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry\r\nwithin twelve months.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they\xe2\x80\x99re in love with some\r\none who, perhaps, is tied to another?\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off\r\nin a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to\r\nmeddle with other people\xe2\x80\x99s property.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that we should ever be spoken of as other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s property.  All men are married women\xe2\x80\x99s property.  That is the\r\nonly true definition of what married women\xe2\x80\x99s property really is.  But we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t belong to any one.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you really think, dear Caroline, that\r\nlegislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,\r\nall the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like\r\nmarried men.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I certainly never know one from the other.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man\r\nhas home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad\r\nexpression in the eyes of so many married men.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly\r\ntedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they\r\nare not.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely\r\nchanged since my young days, but I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to state that poor dear\r\nHunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of\r\nmeeting him.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you renew him from time to time, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh no, Lady Caroline.  I have only had one husband as yet.\r\nI suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  With your views on life I wonder you married at all.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  So do I.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, I believe you are really very happy in\r\nyour married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from others.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, I hope not, dear.  I knew his mother quite well.\r\nShe was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland\xe2\x80\x99s daughters.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Victoria Stratton?  I remember her perfectly.  A silly\r\nfair-haired woman with no chin.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, Ernest has a chin.  He has a very strong chin, a\r\nsquare chin.  Ernest\xe2\x80\x99s chin is far too square.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But do you really think a man\xe2\x80\x99s chin can be too square?\r\nI think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be\r\nquite, quite square.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield.  It\r\nis only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I adore silent men.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Ernest isn\xe2\x80\x99t silent.  He talks the whole time.  But he\r\nhas got no conversation.  What he talks about I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.  I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlistened to him for years.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Have you never forgiven him then?  How sad that seems!\r\nBut all life is very, very sad, is it not?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a _mauvais quart d\xe2\x80\x99heure_\r\nmade up of exquisite moments.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, there are moments, certainly.  But was it something\r\nvery, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did?  Did he become angry with you, and\r\nsay anything that was unkind or true?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh dear, no.  Ernest is invariably calm.  That is one of\r\nthe reasons he always gets on my nerves.  Nothing is so aggravating as\r\ncalmness.  There is something positively brutal about the good temper of\r\nmost modern men.  I wonder we women stand it as well as we do.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men\xe2\x80\x99s good temper shows they are not so sensitive\r\nas we are, not so finely strung.  It makes a great barrier often between\r\nhusband and wife, does it not?  But I would so much like to know what was\r\nthe wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell\r\neverybody else.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  I will make a point of repeating\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively\r\non his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course\r\nof his life.  I was very young at the time, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe him, I\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.  Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any\r\nkind till after I had been actually married four or five months.  I found\r\nout then that what he had told me was perfectly true.  And that sort of\r\nthing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Men always want to be a woman\xe2\x80\x99s first love.  That is their\r\nclumsy vanity.  We women have a more subtle instinct about things.  What\r\nwe like is to be a man\xe2\x80\x99s last romance.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I see what you mean.  It\xe2\x80\x99s very, very beautiful.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell me that you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforgive your husband because he never loved any one else?  Did you ever\r\nhear such a thing, Caroline?  I am quite surprised.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that\r\nnothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages.  They\r\napparently are getting remarkably rare.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, they\xe2\x80\x99re quite out of date.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  How like the middle classes!\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes\xe2\x80\x94is it not?\xe2\x80\x94very, very like them.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  If what you tell us about the middle classes is true,\r\nLady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit.  It is much to be\r\nregretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently\r\nfrivolous, under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to\r\nbe.  It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we\r\nall know of in society.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the frivolity of\r\nthe wife has ever anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined\r\nnowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else.  How\r\ncan a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating\r\nher as if she were a perfectly rational being?\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a\r\nsex that has been rational for millions and millions of years.  He can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp himself.  It is in his race.  The History of Woman is very\r\ndifferent.  We have always been picturesque protests against the mere\r\nexistence of common sense.  We saw its dangers from the first.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly most,\r\nmost trying.  Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband.  I think\r\nit would be so very, very helpful.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Husband?  There couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be such a thing.  The\r\ninstitution is wrong.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to _us_.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  He would probably be extremely realistic.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Man!  Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if\r\nwe were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.  He should refuse\r\nall our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims.  He should\r\nencourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions.  He should\r\nalways say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he\r\nsays.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But how could he do both, dear?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should never run down other pretty women.  That would\r\nshow he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much.  No; he\r\nshould be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don\xe2\x80\x99t attract\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about\r\nother women.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us\r\nan answer all about ourselves.  He should invariably praise us for\r\nwhatever qualities he knows we haven\xe2\x80\x99t got.  But he should be pitiless,\r\nquite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never\r\ndreamed of possessing.  He should never believe that we know the use of\r\nuseful things.  That would be unforgiveable.  But he should shower on us\r\neverything we don\xe2\x80\x99t want.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills\r\nand compliments.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat\r\nus with absolute respect when we are alone.  And yet he should be always\r\nready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to\r\nbecome miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, and to\r\noverwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be\r\npositively violent at the end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever\r\nat a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner.  And\r\nwhen, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has\r\nrefused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised\r\nnever to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters,\r\nhe should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long,\r\nand send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine\r\nquite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he\r\nwas.  And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about\r\neverywhere with one\xe2\x80\x99s husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one\r\nwas, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if\r\nhis conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really\r\nbadly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in\r\nthe wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman\xe2\x80\x99s duty to\r\nforgive, and one can do it all over again from the beginning, with\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How clever you are, my dear!  You never mean a single\r\nword you say.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  It has been quite, quite\r\nentrancing.  I must try and remember it all.  There are such a number of\r\ndetails that are so very, very important.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you have not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal\r\nMan is to be.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  His reward?  Oh, infinite expectation.  That is quite\r\nenough for him.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But men are so terribly, terribly exacting, are they\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  That makes no matter.  One should never surrender.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Not even to the Ideal Man?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Certainly not to him.  Unless, of course, one wants to\r\ngrow tired of him.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh! . . . yes.  I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\r\nDo you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?  Or are\r\nthere more than one?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, my dear!\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Going over to her_.]  What has happened?  Do tell me.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_in a low voice_]  I had completely forgotten that the\r\nAmerican young lady has been in the room all the time.  I am afraid some\r\nof this clever talk may have shocked her a little.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that will do her so much good!\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Let us hope she didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand much.  I think I had\r\nbetter go over and talk to her.  [_Rises and goes across to_ HESTER\r\nWORSLEY.]  Well, dear Miss Worsley. [_Sitting down beside her_.]  How\r\nquiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time!  I suppose\r\nyou have been reading a book?  There are so many books here in the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  No, I have been listening to the conversation.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t believe everything that was said, you know,\r\ndear.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe any of it.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That is quite right, dear.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  [_Continuing_.]  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that any women could really\r\nhold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your\r\nguests.  [_An awkward pause_.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hear you have such pleasant society in America.\r\nQuite like our own in places, my son wrote to me.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  There are cliques in America as elsewhere, Lady Hunstanton.  But\r\ntrue American society consists simply of all the good women and good men\r\nwe have in our country.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What a sensible system, and I dare say quite pleasant\r\ntoo.  I am afraid in England we have too many artificial social barriers.\r\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  In America we have no lower classes.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a very strange arrangement!\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What is that dreadful girl talking about?\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  She is painfully natural, is she not?\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  There are a great many things you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got in America,\r\nI am told, Miss Worsley.  They say you have no ruins, and no curiosities.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_To_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  What nonsense!  They have their\r\nmothers and their manners.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities, Lady\r\nCaroline.  They are sent over to us every summer, regularly, in the\r\nsteamers, and propose to us the day after they land.  As for ruins, we\r\nare trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or\r\nstone.  [_Gets up to take her fan from table_.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What is that, dear?  Ah, yes, an iron Exhibition, is it\r\nnot, at that place that has the curious name?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  [_Standing by table_.]  We are trying to build up life, Lady\r\nHunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests on here.\r\nThis sounds strange to you all, no doubt.  How could it sound other than\r\nstrange?  You rich people in England, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you are living.\r\nHow could you know?  You shut out from your society the gentle and the\r\ngood.  You laugh at the simple and the pure.  Living, as you all do, on\r\nothers and by them, you sneer at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread\r\nto the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season.  With all your\r\npomp and wealth and art you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to live\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know\r\nthat.  You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the\r\nbeauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of\r\nlife, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing.  You have\r\nlost life\xe2\x80\x99s secret.  Oh, your English society seems to me shallow,\r\nselfish, foolish.  It has blinded its eyes, and stopped its ears.  It\r\nlies like a leper in purple.  It sits like a dead thing smeared with\r\ngold.  It is all wrong, all wrong.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think one should know of these things.  It is\r\nnot very, very nice, is it?\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English\r\nsociety so much.  You were such a success in it.  And you were so much\r\nadmired by the best people.  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said\r\nof you\xe2\x80\x94but it was most complimentary, and you know what an authority he\r\nis on beauty.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Lord Henry Weston!  I remember him, Lady Hunstanton.  A man with\r\na hideous smile and a hideous past.  He is asked everywhere.  No\r\ndinner-party is complete without him.  What of those whose ruin is due to\r\nhim?  They are outcasts.  They are nameless.  If you met them in the\r\nstreet you would turn your head away.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain of their\r\npunishment.  Let all women who have sinned be punished.\r\n\r\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters from terrace behind in a cloak with a lace veil\r\nover her head_.  _She hears the last words and starts_.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady!\r\n\r\nHESTER.  It is right that they should be punished, but don\xe2\x80\x99t let them be\r\nthe only ones to suffer.  If a man and woman have sinned, let them both\r\ngo forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there.  Let them\r\nboth be branded.  Set a mark, if you wish, on each, but don\xe2\x80\x99t punish the\r\none and let the other go free.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t have one law for men and another\r\nfor women.  You are unjust to women in England.  And till you count what\r\nis a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man, you will always be\r\nunjust, and Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of cloud,\r\nwill be made dim to your eyes, or be not seen at all, or if seen, not\r\nregarded.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Might I, dear Miss Worsley, as you are standing up, ask\r\nyou for my cotton that is just behind you?  Thank you.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Mrs. Arbuthnot!  I am so pleased you have come\r\nup.  But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear you announced.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, I came straight in from the terrace, Lady Hunstanton,\r\njust as I was.  You didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you had a party.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Not a party.  Only a few guests who are staying in the\r\nhouse, and whom you must know.  Allow me.  [_Tries to help her_.  _Rings\r\nbell_.]  Caroline, this is Mrs. Arbuthnot, one of my sweetest friends.\r\nLady Caroline Pontefract, Lady Stutfield, Mrs. Allonby, and my young\r\nAmerican friend, Miss Worsley, who has just been telling us all how\r\nwicked we are.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly, Lady Hunstanton.\r\nBut there are some things in England\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth, I\r\ndare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it,\r\nwhich is much more important, Lord Illingworth would tell us.  The only\r\npoint where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother, about poor Lord Henry.  He is really such good company.\r\n\r\n[_Enter Footman_.]\r\n\r\nTake Mrs. Arbuthnot\xe2\x80\x99s things.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Footman with wraps_.]\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Lady Caroline, I had no idea it was your brother.  I am sorry\r\nfor the pain I must have caused you\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  My dear Miss Worsley, the only part of your little\r\nspeech, if I may so term it, with which I thoroughly agreed, was the part\r\nabout my brother.  Nothing that you could possibly say could be too bad\r\nfor him.  I regard Henry as infamous, absolutely infamous.  But I am\r\nbound to state, as you were remarking, Jane, that he is excellent\r\ncompany, and he has one of the best cooks in London, and after a good\r\ndinner one can forgive anybody, even one\xe2\x80\x99s own relations.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_to_ MISS WORSLEY]  Now, do come, dear, and make friends\r\nwith Mrs. Arbuthnot.  She is one of the good, sweet, simple people you\r\ntold us we never admitted into society.  I am sorry to say Mrs. Arbuthnot\r\ncomes very rarely to me.  But that is not my fault.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a bore it is the men staying so long after dinner!  I\r\nexpect they are saying the most dreadful things about us.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really think so?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I was sure of it.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very horrid of them!  Shall we go onto the\r\nterrace?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, anything to get away from the dowagers and the\r\ndowdies.  [_Rises and goes with_ LADY STUTFIELD _to door_ L.C.]  We are\r\nonly going to look at the stars, Lady Hunstanton.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You will find a great many, dear, a great many.  But\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t catch cold.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  We shall all miss Gerald so\r\nmuch, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But has Lord Illingworth really offered to make Gerald\r\nhis secretary?\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, yes!  He has been most charming about it.  He has\r\nthe highest possible opinion of your boy.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t know Lord\r\nIllingworth, I believe, dear.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have never met him.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You know him by name, no doubt?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am afraid I don\xe2\x80\x99t.  I live so much out of the world,\r\nand see so few people.  I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord\r\nIllingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes.  That would be the last Earl but one.  He was\r\na very curious man.  He wanted to marry beneath him.  Or wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, I\r\nbelieve.  There was some scandal about it.  The present Lord Illingworth\r\nis quite different.  He is very distinguished.  He does\xe2\x80\x94well, he does\r\nnothing, which I am afraid our pretty American visitor here thinks very\r\nwrong of anybody, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he cares much for the subjects in\r\nwhich you are so interested, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Do you think,\r\nCaroline, that Lord Illingworth is interested in the Housing of the Poor?\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I should fancy not at all, Jane.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  We all have our different tastes, have we not?  But\r\nLord Illingworth has a very high position, and there is nothing he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get if he chose to ask for it.  Of course, he is comparatively a\r\nyoung man still, and he has only come to his title within\xe2\x80\x94how long\r\nexactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworth succeeded?\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  About four years, I think, Jane.  I know it was the same\r\nyear in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I remember.  That would be about four years ago.\r\nOf course, there were a great many people between the present Lord\r\nIllingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  There was\xe2\x80\x94who was there,\r\nCaroline?\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  There was poor Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s baby.  You remember how anxious\r\nshe was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and her husband\r\ndied shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of Lord\r\nAscot\xe2\x80\x99s sons, who, I am told, beats her.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the family.\r\nAnd there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic,\r\nor a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know the\r\nCourt of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that he was quite\r\nsane.  And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumstead\xe2\x80\x99s with straws in\r\nhis hair, or something very odd about him.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t recall what.  I often\r\nregret, Lady Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son\r\nget the title.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Cecilia?\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Lord Illingworth\xe2\x80\x99s mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, was one\r\nof the Duchess of Jerningham\xe2\x80\x99s pretty daughters, and she married Sir\r\nThomas Harford, who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t considered a very good match for her at the\r\ntime, though he was said to be the handsomest man in London.  I knew them\r\nall quite intimately, and both the sons, Arthur and George.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course, Lady\r\nHunstanton?\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field.  Or was\r\nit fishing, Caroline?  I forget.  But George came in for everything.  I\r\nalways tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once.\r\nMight I see him?  Can he be sent for?\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, dear.  I will send one of the servants into\r\nthe dining-room to fetch him.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what keeps the gentlemen so\r\nlong.  [_Rings bell_.]  When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain\r\nGeorge Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young man about town, with\r\nnot a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him.  She\r\nwas quite devoted to him.  Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms\r\nwith his father.  Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon.  [_To Servant_.]  It\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ DOCTOR DAUBENY.  SIR JOHN _goes over to_ LADY\r\nSTUTFIELD, DOCTOR DAUBENY _to_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining.  I have\r\nnever enjoyed myself more.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_To_ DOCTOR BAUBENY.]  You see I have got Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot to come to me at last.\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton.  Mrs. Daubeny\r\nwill be quite jealous of you.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come with you\r\nto-night.  Headache as usual, I suppose.\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.  But she is\r\nhappiest alone.  She is happiest alone.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_To her husband_.]  John!  [SIR JOHN _goes over to his\r\nwife_.  DOCTOR BAUBENY _talks to_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\r\n\r\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT watches LORD ILLINGWORTH the whole time.  He has passed\r\nacross the room without noticing her, and approaches MRS. ALLONBY, who\r\nwith LADY STUTFIELD is standing by the door looking on to the terrace.]\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How is the most charming woman in the world?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [Taking LADY STUTFIELD by the hand.]  We are both quite\r\nwell, thank you, Lord Illingworth.  But what a short time you have been\r\nin the dining-room!  It seems as if we had only just left.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was bored to death.  Never opened my lips the whole\r\ntime.  Absolutely longing to come in to you.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You should have.  The American girl has been giving us a\r\nlecture.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Really?  All Americans lecture, I believe.  I suppose\r\nit is something in their climate.  What did she lecture about?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Puritanism, of course.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am going to convert her, am I not?  How long do you\r\ngive me?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  A week.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A week is more than enough.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  [_Going to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Dear mother!\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel at all well.  See me home, Gerald.\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I am so sorry, mother.  Certainly.  But you must know Lord\r\nIllingworth first.  [_Goes across room_.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Not to-night, Gerald.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know my mother.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  With the greatest pleasure.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in a moment.  People\xe2\x80\x99s mothers always bore me to death.  All\r\nwomen become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  No man does.  That is his.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a delightful mood you are in to-night!  [_Turns\r\nround and goes across with_ GERALD _to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  _When he sees\r\nher_, _he starts back in wonder_.  _Then slowly his eyes turn towards_\r\nGERALD.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has offered to take me as\r\nhis private secretary.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _bows coldly_.]  It is a\r\nwonderful opening for me, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?  I hope he won\xe2\x80\x99t be disappointed in\r\nme, that is all.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll thank Lord Illingworth, mother, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth in very good, I am sure, to interest\r\nhimself in you for the moment.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Putting his hand on_ GERALD\xe2\x80\x99S _shoulder_.]  Oh,\r\nGerald and I are great friends already, Mrs . . . Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There can be nothing in common between you and my son,\r\nLord Illingworth.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Dear mother, how can you say so?  Of course Lord Illingworth is\r\nawfully clever and that sort of thing.  There is nothing Lord Illingworth\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy!\r\n\r\nGERALD.  He knows more about life than any one I have ever met.  I feel\r\nan awful duffer when I am with you, Lord Illingworth.  Of course, I have\r\nhad so few advantages.  I have not been to Eton or Oxford like other\r\nchaps.  But Lord Illingworth doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to mind that.  He has been\r\nawfully good to me, mother.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth may change his mind.  He may not really\r\nwant you as his secretary.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother!\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You must remember, as you said yourself, you have had so\r\nfew advantages.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for a moment.  Do\r\ncome over.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Will you excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot?  Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nyour charming mother make any more difficulties, Gerald.  The thing is\r\nquite settled, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I hope so.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _goes across to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I thought you were never going to leave the lady in black\r\nvelvet.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is excessively handsome.  [_Looks at_ MRS.\r\nARBUTHNOT.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room?\r\nMiss Worsley is going to play.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t you?  You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a treat is in store for you.  [_To_\r\nDOCTOR BAUBENY.]  I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to\r\nthe rectory.  I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the\r\nviolin.  Ah, I forgot.  Dear Mrs. Daubeny\xe2\x80\x99s hearing is a little\r\ndefective, is it not?\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Her deafness is a great privation to her.  She can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven hear my sermons now.  She reads them at home.  But she has many\r\nresources in herself, many resources.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She reads a good deal, I suppose?\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Just the very largest print.  The eyesight is rapidly\r\ngoing.  But she\xe2\x80\x99s never morbid, never morbid.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  Do speak to my mother, Lord\r\nIllingworth, before you go into the music-room.  She seems to think,\r\nsomehow, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean what you said to me.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you coming?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  In a few moments.  Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot\r\nwould allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join\r\nyou later on.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, of course.  You will have a great deal to say to\r\nher, and she will have a great deal to thank you for.  It is not every\r\nson who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  But I know you appreciate\r\nthat, dear.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord\r\nIllingworth.  We can\xe2\x80\x99t spare her.\r\n\r\n[_Exit following the other guests_.  _Sound of violin heard from\r\nmusic-room_.]\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So that is our son, Rachel!  Well, I am very proud of\r\nhim.  He in a Harford, every inch of him.  By the way, why Arbuthnot,\r\nRachel?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  One name is as good as another, when one has no right to\r\nany name.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose so\xe2\x80\x94but why Gerald?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  After a man whose heart I broke\xe2\x80\x94after my father.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Well, Rachel, what is over is over.  All I have got to\r\nsay now in that I am very, very much pleased with our boy.  The world\r\nwill know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will be\r\nsomething very near, and very dear.  It is a curious thing, Rachel; my\r\nlife seemed to be quite complete.  It was not so.  It lacked something,\r\nit lacked a son.  I have found my son now, I am glad I have found him.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You have no right to claim him, or the smallest part of\r\nhim.  The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over\r\ntwenty years.  Why not let me have him for a little now?  He is quite as\r\nmuch mine as yours.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Are you talking of the child you abandoned?  Of the\r\nchild who, as far as you are concerned, might have died of hunger and of\r\nwant?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me.  It was\r\nnot I who left you.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I left you because you refused to give the child a name.\r\nBefore my son was born, I implored you to marry me.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I had no expectations then.  And besides, Rachel, I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t much older than you were.  I was only twenty-two.  I was\r\ntwenty-one, I believe, when the whole thing began in your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old\r\nenough to do right also.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities are always\r\ninteresting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.  As for\r\nsaying I left our child to starve, that, of course, is untrue and silly.\r\nMy mother offered you six hundred a year.  But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nanything.  You simply disappeared, and carried the child away with you.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have accepted a penny from her.  Your father\r\nwas different.  He told you, in my presence, when we were in Paris, that\r\nit was your duty to marry me.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, duty is what one expects from others, it is not\r\nwhat one does oneself.  Of course, I was influenced by my mother.  Every\r\nman is when he is young.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am glad to hear you say so.  Gerald shall certainly\r\nnot go away with you.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What nonsense, Rachel!\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Do you think I would allow my son\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  _Our_ son.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son [LORD ILLINGWORTH _shrugs his shoulders_]\xe2\x80\x94to go\r\naway with the man who spoiled my youth, who ruined my life, who has\r\ntainted every moment of my days?  You don\xe2\x80\x99t realise what my past has been\r\nin suffering and in shame.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, I must candidly say that I think\r\nGerald\xe2\x80\x99s future considerably more important than your past.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald cannot separate his future from my past.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is exactly what he should do.  That is exactly\r\nwhat you should help him to do.  What a typical woman you are!  You talk\r\nsentimentally, and you are thoroughly selfish the whole time.  But don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet us have a scene.  Rachel, I want you to look at this matter from the\r\ncommon-sense point of view, from the point of view of what is best for\r\nour son, leaving you and me out of the question.  What is our son at\r\npresent?  An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank in a third-rate\r\nEnglish town.  If you imagine he is quite happy in such a position, you\r\nare mistaken.  He is thoroughly discontented.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He was not discontented till he met you.  You have made\r\nhim so.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Of course, I made him so.  Discontent is the first\r\nstep in the progress of a man or a nation.  But I did not leave him with\r\na mere longing for things he could not get.  No, I made him a charming\r\noffer.  He jumped at it, I need hardly say.  Any young man would.  And\r\nnow, simply because it turns out that I am the boy\xe2\x80\x99s own father and he my\r\nown son, you propose practically to ruin his career.  That is to say, if\r\nI were a perfect stranger, you would allow Gerald to go away with me, but\r\nas he is my own flesh and blood you won\xe2\x80\x99t.  How utterly illogical you\r\nare!\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not allow him to go.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How can you prevent it?  What excuse can you give to\r\nhim for making him decline such an offer as mine?  I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell him in\r\nwhat relations I stand to him, I need hardly say.  But you daren\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nhim.  You know that.  Look how you have brought him up.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have brought him up to be a good man.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  And what is the result?  You have educated\r\nhim to be your judge if he ever finds you out.  And a bitter, an unjust\r\njudge he will be to you.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t be deceived, Rachel.  Children begin by\r\nloving their parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely, if ever, do\r\nthey forgive them.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  George, don\xe2\x80\x99t take my son away from me.  I have had\r\ntwenty years of sorrow, and I have only had one thing to love me, only\r\none thing to love.  You have had a life of joy, and pleasure, and\r\nsuccess.  You have been quite happy, you have never thought of us.  There\r\nwas no reason, according to your views of life, why you should have\r\nremembered us at all.  Your meeting us was a mere accident, a horrible\r\naccident.  Forget it.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t come now, and rob me of . . . of all I have\r\nin the whole world.  You are so rich in other things.  Leave me the\r\nlittle vineyard of my life; leave me the walled-in garden and the well of\r\nwater; the ewe-lamb God sent me, in pity or in wrath, oh! leave me that.\r\nGeorge, don\xe2\x80\x99t take Gerald from me.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, at the present moment you are not necessary to\r\nGerald\xe2\x80\x99s career; I am.  There is nothing more to be said on the subject.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not let him go.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Here is Gerald.  He has a right to decide for himself.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ GERALD.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother, I hope you have settled it all with Lord\r\nIllingworth?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have not, Gerald.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother seems not to like your coming with me, for\r\nsome reason.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Why, mother?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I thought you were quite happy here with me, Gerald.  I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were so anxious to leave me.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, how can you talk like that?  Of course I have been quite\r\nhappy with you.  But a man can\xe2\x80\x99t stay always with his mother.  No chap\r\ndoes.  I want to make myself a position, to do something.  I thought you\r\nwould have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth\xe2\x80\x99s secretary.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not think you would be suitable as a private\r\nsecretary to Lord Illingworth.  You have no qualifications.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I surely am\r\nthe best judge.  And I can only tell you that your son has all the\r\nqualifications I had hoped for.  He has more, in fact, than I had even\r\nthought of.  Far more.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _remains silent_.]  Have you any\r\nother reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don\xe2\x80\x99t wish your son to accept this\r\npost?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Have you, mother?  Do answer.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.  We\r\nare quite by ourselves here.  Whatever it is, I need not say I will not\r\nrepeat it.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you would like to be alone with your son, I will\r\nleave you.  You may have some other reason you don\xe2\x80\x99t wish me to hear.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have no other reason.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing as\r\nsettled.  Come, you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together.\r\nAnd Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I think you have acted\r\nvery, very wisely.\r\n\r\n[_Exit with_ GERALD.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is left alone_.  _She stands\r\nimmobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face_.]\r\n\r\n                                 ACT DROP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ACT\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  SCENE\r\n\r\n    _The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_.  _Door at back leading on to\r\n                                terrace_.\r\n\r\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a\r\nsofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I\r\nknew she would come round in the end.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know\r\nshe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is\r\nperfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass an examination now to save my life.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value\r\nwhatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is\r\nnot a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got on\r\nyour side the most wonderful thing in the world\xe2\x80\x94youth!  There is nothing\r\nlike youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom\r\nwaiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,\r\nlike most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\xe2\x80\x94except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  But you don\xe2\x80\x99t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember my father; he died years ago.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.\r\nI sometimes think she must have married beneath her.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts\r\nhis hand on_ GERALD\xe2\x80\x99S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father,\r\nI suppose, Gerald?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such\r\na mother as I have had.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that\r\nmost mothers don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand their sons.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t realise, I mean,\r\nthat a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.\r\nAfter all, Gerald, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to pass all your life in such\r\na hole as Wrockley, could you?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A mother\xe2\x80\x99s love is very touching, of course, but it is\r\noften curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  [_Slowly_.]  I suppose there is.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good\r\nwomen have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their\r\ninterests are so petty, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nmuch about.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort\r\nof thing.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Oh, yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s always going to church.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only\r\nthing worth being nowadays.  You want to be modern, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Gerald?\r\nYou want to know life as it really is.  Not to be put off with any\r\nold-fashioned theories about life.  Well, what you have to do at present\r\nis simply to fit yourself for the best society.  A man who can dominate a\r\nLondon dinner-table can dominate the world.  The future belongs to the\r\ndandy.  It is the exquisites who are going to rule.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always\r\nbeen told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the philosophy of the superficial.  By the way,\r\nGerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.  Sentiment is all\r\nvery well for the button-hole.  But the essential thing for a necktie is\r\nstyle.  A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  [_Laughing_.]  I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord\r\nIllingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow to talk.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to\r\nevery man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you\r\nwill have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  But it is very difficult to get into society isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either\r\nto feed people, amuse people, or shock people\xe2\x80\x94that is all!\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of it\r\nsimply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any real\r\nsuccess in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule\r\nsociety.  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.  You\r\nmight just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You should never try to understand them.  Women are\r\npictures.  Men are problems.  If you want to know what a woman really\r\nmeans\xe2\x80\x94which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do\xe2\x80\x94look at her,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t listen to her.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  But women are awfully clever, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always tell them so.  But, to the\r\nphilosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  How then can women have so much power as you say they have?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The history of women is the history of the worst form\r\nof tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak over the\r\nstrong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  But haven\xe2\x80\x99t women got a refining influence?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Nothing refines but the intellect.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren\xe2\x80\x99t there?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  But there are good women in society, aren\xe2\x80\x99t there?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Far too many.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  But do you think women shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never tell them so, they\xe2\x80\x99d all become good\r\nat once.  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.  Every woman is a rebel,\r\nand usually in wild revolt against herself.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Men marry because they are tired; women because they\r\nare curious.  Both are disappointed.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  But don\xe2\x80\x99t you think one can be happy when one is married?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Perfectly happy.  But the happiness of a married man,\r\nmy dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  But if one is in love?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always be in love.  That is the reason one\r\nshould never marry.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Love is a very wonderful thing, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself.\r\nAnd one ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a\r\nromance.  But a really _grande passion_ is comparatively rare nowadays.\r\nIt is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.  That is the one\r\nuse of the idle classes in a country, and the only possible explanation\r\nof us Harfords.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Harfords, Lord Illingworth?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is my family name.  You should study the Peerage,\r\nGerald.  It is the one book a young man about town should know\r\nthoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever\r\ndone.  And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectly new life with me,\r\nand I want you to know how to live.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _appears on terrace\r\nbehind_.]  For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live\r\nin it!\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ L.C. LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ DR. DAUBENY.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! here you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  Well, I\r\nsuppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new\r\nduties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good advice over a\r\npleasant cigarette.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady\r\nHunstanton, and the best of cigarettes.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I\r\nsuppose I am too old now to learn.  Except from you, dear Archdeacon,\r\nwhen you are in your nice pulpit.  But then I always know what you are\r\ngoing to say, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel alarmed.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah!\r\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.  Come, dear.  [_Enter_ MRS.\r\nARBUTHNOT.]  Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord\r\nIllingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant\r\nway in which everything has turned out for him.  Let us sit down.  [_They\r\nsit down_.]  And how is your beautiful embroidery going on?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas.\r\nBut the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal.  She has not touched\r\nthe tambour frame for nine or ten years.  But she has many other\r\namusements.  She is very much interested in her own health.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that is always a nice distraction, in it not?  Now,\r\nwhat are you talking about, Lord Illingworth?  Do tell us.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the\r\nworld has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in\r\nwhich it has been able to bear them.  And that, consequently, whatever\r\nthe world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now I am quite out of my depth.  I usually am when Lord\r\nIllingworth says anything.  And the Humane Society is most careless.\r\nThey never rescue me.  I am left to sink.  I have a dim idea, dear Lord\r\nIllingworth, that you are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I\r\nalways try to be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get.\r\nAnd after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The only difference between the saint and the sinner\r\nis that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that quite does for me.  I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a word to say.\r\nYou and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age.  We can\xe2\x80\x99t follow Lord\r\nIllingworth.  Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid.\r\nTo have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays.  It shuts one\r\nout from so much.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of\r\nhis opinions.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are quite right, dear.\r\n\r\n[GERALD _shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother_.\r\n_Enter_ LADY CAROLINE.]\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Jane, have you seen John anywhere?\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You needn\xe2\x80\x99t be anxious about him, dear.  He is with\r\nLady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room.\r\nThey seem quite happy together.  You are not going, Caroline?  Pray sit\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think I had better look after John.\r\n\r\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do to pay men so much attention.  And\r\nCaroline has really nothing to be anxious about.  Lady Stutfield is very\r\nsympathetic.  She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about\r\nanother.  A beautiful nature.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\r\n\r\nAh! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs. Allonby too!  I suppose it was Mrs.\r\nAllonby I saw him with.  Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady\r\nHunstanton.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! the Music-room, of course.  I thought it was the\r\nYellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.  [_To the_\r\nARCHDEACON.]  Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She used to be quite remarkable for her memory, but\r\nsince her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early\r\nchildhood.  But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ LADY STUTFIELD _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil been\r\ntalking to you about?\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Bimetallism!  Is that quite a nice subject?  However, I\r\nknow people discuss everything very freely nowadays.  What did Sir John\r\ntalk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  About Patagonia.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a remote topic!  But very improving, I\r\nhave no doubt.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia.\r\nSavages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost\r\nall subjects.  They are excessively advanced.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What do they do?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Apparently everything.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it\r\nnot, to find that Human Nature is permanently one.\xe2\x80\x94On the whole, the\r\nworld is the same world, is it not?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The world is simply divided into two classes\xe2\x80\x94those who\r\nbelieve the incredible, like the public\xe2\x80\x94and those who do the improbable\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Like yourself?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Yes; I am always astonishing myself.  It is the only\r\nthing that makes life worth living.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful\r\nqualities in my own nature.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah! don\xe2\x80\x99t become quite perfect all at once.  Do it\r\ngradually!\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to grow perfect at all.  At least, I\r\nhope I shan\xe2\x80\x99t.  It would be most inconvenient.  Women love us for our\r\ndefects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything,\r\neven our gigantic intellects.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis.  We forgive\r\nadoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from us.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.  _He joins_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we,\r\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot?  I am sure you agree with me in that.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many\r\nthings women should never forgive.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What sort of things?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The ruin of another woman\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\n[_Moves slowly away to back of stage_.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe\r\nthere are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and\r\nreformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take\r\nthings very, very easily.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is\r\nunbecoming.\r\n\r\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of\r\nbeing terribly, terribly deceived.\r\n\r\nKELVIL.  The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  There is no secret of life.  Life\xe2\x80\x99s aim, if it has\r\none, is simply to be always looking for temptations.  There are not\r\nnearly enough.  I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a\r\nsingle one.  It is quite dreadful.  It makes one so nervous about the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Shakes her fan at him_.]  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it is,\r\ndear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me\r\nexcessively immoral.  It has been most interesting, listening to you.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  All thought is immoral.  Its very essence is\r\ndestruction.  If you think of anything, you kill it.  Nothing survives\r\nbeing thought of.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand a word, Lord Illingworth.  But I\r\nhave no doubt it is all quite true.  Personally, I have very little to\r\nreproach myself with, on the score of thinking.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in women\r\nthinking too much.  Women should think in moderation, as they should do\r\nall things in moderation.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.  Nothing\r\nsucceeds like excess.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope I shall remember that.  It sounds an admirable\r\nmaxim.  But I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to forget everything.  It\xe2\x80\x99s a great misfortune.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady\r\nHunstanton.  No woman should have a memory.  Memory in a woman is the\r\nbeginning of dowdiness.  One can always tell from a woman\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet\r\nwhether she has got a memory or not.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  You\r\nalways find out that one\xe2\x80\x99s most glaring fault is one\xe2\x80\x99s most important\r\nvirtue.  You have the most comforting views of life.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ FARQUHAR.]\r\n\r\nFARQUHAR.  Doctor Daubeny\xe2\x80\x99s carriage!\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Archdeacon!  It is only half-past ten.\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  [_Rising_.]  I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton.\r\nTuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny\xe2\x80\x99s bad nights.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t keep you from her.  [_Goes\r\nwith him towards door_.]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of\r\npartridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never touches\r\nsolids now.  Lives entirely on jellies.  But she is wonderfully cheerful,\r\nwonderfully cheerful.  She has nothing to complain of.\r\n\r\n[_Exit with_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Goes over to_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  There is a beautiful\r\nmoon to-night.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Let us go and look at it.  To look at anything that is\r\ninconstant is charming nowadays.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You have your looking-glass.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is unkind.  It merely shows me my wrinkles.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Mine is better behaved.  It never tells me the truth.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then it is in love with you.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt_ SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH]  May I come too?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do, my dear boy.  [_Moves towards door with_ MRS.\r\nALLONBY _and_ GERALD.]\r\n\r\n[LADY CAROLINE _enters_, _looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite\r\ndirection to that taken by_ SIR JOHN _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\r\n\r\nGERALD.  What, mother!\r\n\r\n[_Exit_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is getting late.  Let us go home.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  My dear mother.  Do let us wait a little longer.  Lord\r\nIllingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a great\r\nsurprise for you.  We are starting for India at the end of this month.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let us go home.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid\r\ngood-bye to Lord Illingworth first.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in five minutes.\r\n[_Exit_.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nwith him!  I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear it.  [_Walks up and down_.]\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ HESTER.]\r\n\r\nHESTER.  What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Is it?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You are so\r\ndifferent from the other women here.  When you came into the Drawing-room\r\nthis evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and\r\npure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are things that are right to\r\nsay, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you had heard it.  But I knew you would agree with\r\nme.  A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  She shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to come into the society of good men\r\nand women?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  She should not.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  And the man should be punished in the same way?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  In the same way.  And the children, if there are\r\nchildren, in the same way also?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited\r\non the children.  It is a just law.  It is God\xe2\x80\x99s law.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is one of God\xe2\x80\x99s terrible laws.\r\n\r\n[_Moves away to fireplace_.]\r\n\r\nHESTER.  You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth?  Of course\r\nthere is position, no doubt, and money, but position and money are not\r\neverything, are they?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  They are nothing; they bring misery.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Then why do you let your son go with him?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He wishes it himself.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  But if you asked him he would stay, would he not?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He has set his heart on going.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t refuse you anything.  He loves you too much.  Ask\r\nhim to stay.  Let me send him in to you.  He is on the terrace at this\r\nmoment with Lord Illingworth.  I heard them laughing together as I passed\r\nthrough the Music-room.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.  It is of no\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him you want him.  Do\xe2\x80\x94do ask him to stay.  [_Exit_\r\nHESTER.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He won\xe2\x80\x99t come\xe2\x80\x94I know he won\xe2\x80\x99t come.\r\n\r\n[Enter LADY CAROLINE.  _She looks round anxiously_.  _Enter_ GERALD.]\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the\r\nterrace?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace.\r\n\r\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is very curious.  It is time for him to retire.\r\n\r\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting.  I forgot all about\r\nit.  I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so happy.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  At the prospect of going away?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t put it like that, mother.  Of course I am sorry to leave\r\nyou.  Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.  But after all, as\r\nLord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a place as\r\nWrockley.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it.  But I\xe2\x80\x99m ambitious; I want something more\r\nthan that.  I want to have a career.  I want to do something that will\r\nmake you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth is going to help me.  He is\r\ngoing to do everything for me.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, don\xe2\x80\x99t go away with Lord Illingworth.  I implore\r\nyou not to.  Gerald, I beg you!\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, how changeable you are!  You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to know your own\r\nmind for a single moment.  An hour and a half ago in the Drawing-room you\r\nagreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and make objections, and\r\ntry to force me to give up my one chance in life.  Yes, my one chance.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every\r\nday, do you, mother?  It is very strange that when I have had such a\r\nwonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties in my\r\nway should be my own mother.  Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester\r\nWorsley.  Who could help loving her?  I love her more than I have ever\r\ntold you, far more.  And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I\r\ncould\xe2\x80\x94I could ask her to\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand now, mother, what it means\r\nto me to be Lord Illingworth\xe2\x80\x99s secretary?  To start like that is to find\r\na career ready for one\xe2\x80\x94before one\xe2\x80\x94waiting for one.  If I were Lord\r\nIllingworth\xe2\x80\x99s secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.  As a wretched\r\nbank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.  I know\r\nher views on life.  She has just told them to me.  [_A pause_.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Then I have my ambition left, at any rate.  That is something\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nam glad I have that!  You have always tried to crush my ambition,\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?  You have told me that the world is a wicked place,\r\nthat success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that\r\nsort of thing\xe2\x80\x94well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, mother.  I think the world must\r\nbe delightful.  I think society must be exquisite.  I think success is a\r\nthing worth having.  You have been wrong in all that you taught me,\r\nmother, quite wrong.  Lord Illingworth is a successful man.  He is a\r\nfashionable man.  He is a man who lives in the world and for it.  Well, I\r\nwould give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I would sooner see you dead.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth?  Tell\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94tell me right out.  What is it?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is a bad man.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  In what way bad?  I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you mean.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will tell you.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I suppose you think him bad, because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe the same\r\nthings as you do.  Well, men are different from women, mother.  It is\r\nnatural that they should have different views.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is not what Lord Illingworth believes, or what he\r\ndoes not believe, that makes him bad.  It is what he is.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, is it something you know of him?  Something you actually\r\nknow?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is something I know.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Something you are quite sure of?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Quite sure of.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  How long have you known it?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For twenty years.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Is it fair to go back twenty years in any man\xe2\x80\x99s career?  And\r\nwhat have you or I to do with Lord Illingworth\xe2\x80\x99s early life?  What\r\nbusiness is it of ours?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What this man has been, he is now, and will be always.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did?  If he did anything\r\nshameful, I will not go away with him.  Surely you know me well enough\r\nfor that?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, come near to me.  Quite close to me, as you used\r\nto do when you were a little boy, when you were mother\xe2\x80\x99s own boy.\r\n[GERALD _sits down beside his mother_.  _She runs her fingers through his\r\nhair_, _and strokes his hands_.]  Gerald, there was a girl once, she was\r\nvery young, she was little over eighteen at the time.  George\r\nHarford\xe2\x80\x94that was Lord Illingworth\xe2\x80\x99s name then\xe2\x80\x94George Harford met her.\r\nShe knew nothing about life.  He\xe2\x80\x94knew everything.  He made this girl love\r\nhim.  He made her love him so much that she left her father\xe2\x80\x99s house with\r\nhim one morning.  She loved him so much, and he had promised to marry\r\nher!  He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him.\r\nShe was very young, and\xe2\x80\x94and ignorant of what life really is.  But he put\r\nthe marriage off from week to week, and month to month.\xe2\x80\x94She trusted in\r\nhim all the while.  She loved him.\xe2\x80\x94Before her child was born\xe2\x80\x94for she had\r\na child\xe2\x80\x94she implored him for the child\xe2\x80\x99s sake to marry her, that the\r\nchild might have a name, that her sin might not be visited on the child,\r\nwho was innocent.  He refused.  After the child was born she left him,\r\ntaking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and\r\nall that was sweet, and good, and pure in her ruined also.  She suffered\r\nterribly\xe2\x80\x94she suffers now.  She will always suffer.  For her there is no\r\njoy, no peace, no atonement.  She is a woman who drags a chain like a\r\nguilty thing.  She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing that is a\r\nleper.  The fire cannot purify her.  The waters cannot quench her\r\nanguish.  Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her sleep! no poppies\r\nforgetfulness!  She is lost!  She is a lost soul!\xe2\x80\x94That is why I call Lord\r\nIllingworth a bad man.  That is why I don\xe2\x80\x99t want my boy to be with him.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of course.  But I\r\ndare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth\r\nwas.\xe2\x80\x94After all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice feelings\r\nat all, go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married, and\r\nlive with him as his wife?  No nice girl would.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_After a pause_.]  Gerald, I withdraw all my\r\nobjections.  You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth, when\r\nand where you choose.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I knew you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand in my way.  You are the\r\nbest woman God ever made.  And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nhe is capable of anything infamous or base.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it of him\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  [_Outside_.]  Let me go!  Let me go!  [_Enter_ HESTER _in\r\nterror_, _and rushes over to_ GERALD _and flings herself in his arms_.]\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Oh! save me\xe2\x80\x94save me from him!\r\n\r\nGERALD.  From whom?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  He has insulted me!  Horribly insulted me!  Save me!\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Who?  Who has dared\xe2\x80\x94?\r\n\r\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters at back of stage_.  HESTER _breaks from_\r\nGERALD\xe2\x80\x99S _arms and points to him_.]\r\n\r\nGERALD  [_He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation_.]  Lord\r\nIllingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God\xe2\x80\x99s earth, a thing\r\nas pure as my own mother.  You have insulted the woman I love most in the\r\nworld with my own mother.  As there is a God in Heaven, I will kill you!\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rushing across and catching hold of him_]  No! no!\r\n\r\nGERALD.  [_Thrusting her back_.]  Don\xe2\x80\x99t hold me, mother.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t hold\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill him!\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Let me go, I say!\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Stop, Gerald, stop!  He is your own father!\r\n\r\n[GERALD _clutches his mother\xe2\x80\x99s hands and looks into her face_.  _She\r\nsinks slowly on the ground in shame_.

ALLONBY.]\r\n\r\nALICE.  Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.\r\n\r\n[_Exit_ L.C.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Good morning, Gerald.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  [_Rising_.]  Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs.\r\nAllonby.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  We came to inquire for your dear\r\nmother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last\r\nnight.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it\r\nwas the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic\xe2\x80\x94at least it always gets\r\non one\xe2\x80\x99s nerves.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing, nowadays.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so glad I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean, dear.  I am\r\nafraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you\xe2\x80\x99re examining Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot\xe2\x80\x99s pretty room.  Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it nice and old-fashioned?\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]  It looks\r\nquite the happy English home.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That\xe2\x80\x99s just the word, dear; that just describes it.\r\nOne feels your mother\xe2\x80\x99s good influence in everything she has about her,\r\nGerald.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that\r\na good influence is the worst in the world.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he\r\nwill change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women\r\nin London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but\r\norchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a\r\nsweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don\xe2\x80\x99t shock one, pictures\r\nthat one can look at without blushing.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But I like blushing.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,\r\nif one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell\r\nme I didn\xe2\x80\x99t blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very\r\nparticular.  He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me know any of his men friends, except those\r\nwho were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,\r\nwas brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the\r\ndevotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\r\nBy-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more\r\noften now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Surely not, Gerald!  It would be most unwise of you.\r\nWhat reason can you have?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should be suitable for the post.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.\r\nBut he says I am not serious enough.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, you really mustn\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that in this\r\nhouse.  Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about the wicked society in\r\nwhich we all live.  She won\xe2\x80\x99t go into it.  She is far too good.  I\r\nconsider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.  It gave\r\nquite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, how can you say that?  There is no resemblance\r\nbetween the two things at all.  But really, Gerald, what do you mean by\r\nnot being suitable?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth\xe2\x80\x99s views of life and mine are too different.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any\r\nviews of life.  They are quite out of place.  You must be guided by\r\nothers in this matter.  Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering\r\noffer, and travelling with him you would see the world\xe2\x80\x94as much of it, at\r\nleast, as one should look at\xe2\x80\x94under the best auspices possible, and stay\r\nwith all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in\r\nyour career.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see the world: I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen enough of it.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have exhausted life, Mr.\r\nArbuthnot.  When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to leave my mother.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part.  Not\r\nleave your mother!  If I were your mother I would insist on your going.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ ALICE L.C.]\r\n\r\nALICE.  Mrs. Arbuthnot\xe2\x80\x99s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad\r\nheadache, and cannot see any one this morning.  [_Exit_ R.C.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better,\r\nGerald.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, to-morrow, then.  Ah, if you had a father,\r\nGerald, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let you waste your life here.  He would send you off\r\nwith Lord Illingworth at once.  But mothers are so weak.  They give up to\r\ntheir sons in everything.  We are all heart, all heart.  Come, dear, I\r\nmust call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid,\r\nis far from well.  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite\r\nwonderful.  He is the most sympathetic of husbands.  Quite a model.\r\nGood-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Good-bye.\r\n\r\n[_Exit_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.  GERALD _sits down and reads\r\nover his letter_.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  What name can I sign?  I, who have no right to any name.\r\n[_Signs name_, _puts letter into envelope_, _addresses it_, _and is about\r\nto seal it_, _when door_ L.C. _opens and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters_.\r\nGERALD _lays down sealing-wax_.  _Mother and son look at each other_.]\r\n\r\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Through French window at the back_.]  Good-bye again,\r\nGerald.  We are taking the short cut across your pretty garden.  Now,\r\nremember my advice to you\xe2\x80\x94start at once with Lord Illingworth.\r\n\r\nMRS. ALLONBY.  _Au revoir_, Mr. Arbuthnot.  Mind you bring me back\r\nsomething nice from your travels\xe2\x80\x94not an Indian shawl\xe2\x80\x94on no account an\r\nIndian shawl.\r\n\r\n[_Exeunt_.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, I have just written to him.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  To whom?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  To my father.  I have written to tell him to come here at four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock this afternoon.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He shall not come here.  He shall not cross the\r\nthreshold of my house.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  He must come.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, if you are going away with Lord Illingworth, go\r\nat once.  Go before it kills me: but don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to meet him.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.  Nothing in the world would induce\r\nme to go away with Lord Illingworth, or to leave you.  Surely you know me\r\nwell enough for that.  No: I have written to him to say\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What can you have to say to him?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Can\xe2\x80\x99t you guess, mother, what I have written in this letter?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, surely you can.  Think, think what must be done, now, at\r\nonce, within the next few days.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is nothing to be done.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him that he must\r\nmarry you.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Marry me?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, I will force him to do it.  The wrong that has been done\r\nyou must be repaired.  Atonement must be made.  Justice may be slow,\r\nmother, but it comes in the end.  In a few days you shall be Lord\r\nIllingworth\xe2\x80\x99s lawful wife.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I will insist upon his doing it.  I will make him do it: he will\r\nnot dare to refuse.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald, it is I who refuse.  I will not marry Lord\r\nIllingworth.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Not marry him?  Mother!\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  But you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand: it is for your sake I am talking, not\r\nfor mine.  This marriage, this necessary marriage, this marriage which\r\nfor obvious reasons must inevitably take place, will not help me, will\r\nnot give me a name that will be really, rightly mine to bear.  But surely\r\nit will be something for you, that you, my mother, should, however late,\r\nbecome the wife of the man who is my father.  Will not that be something?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, you must.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not.  You talk of atonement for a wrong done.\r\nWhat atonement can be made to me?  There is no atonement possible.  I am\r\ndisgraced: he is not.  That is all.  It is the usual history of a man and\r\na woman as it usually happens, as it always happens.  And the ending is\r\nthe ordinary ending.  The woman suffers.  The man goes free.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that is the ordinary ending, mother: I hope it\r\nis not.  But your life, at any rate, shall not end like that.  The man\r\nshall make whatever reparation is possible.  It is not enough.  It does\r\nnot wipe out the past, I know that.  But at least it makes the future\r\nbetter, better for you, mother.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would\r\ngive him a different answer.  Remember, he is my father.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  If he came himself, which he will not do, my answer\r\nwould be the same.  Remember I am your mother.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, you make it terribly difficult for me by talking like\r\nthat; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you won\xe2\x80\x99t look at this matter from the\r\nright, from the only proper standpoint.  It is to take away the\r\nbitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow that lies on your\r\nname, that this marriage must take place.  There is no alternative: and\r\nafter the marriage you and I can go away together.  But the marriage must\r\ntake place first.  It is a duty that you owe, not merely to yourself, but\r\nto all other women\xe2\x80\x94yes: to all the other women in the world, lest he\r\nbetray more.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I owe nothing to other women.  There is not one of them\r\nto help me.  There is not one woman in the world to whom I could go for\r\npity, if I would take it, or for sympathy, if I could win it.  Women are\r\nhard on each other.  That girl, last night, good though she is, fled from\r\nthe room as though I were a tainted thing.  She was right.  I am a\r\ntainted thing.  But my wrongs are my own, and I will bear them alone.  I\r\nmust bear them alone.  What have women who have not sinned to do with me,\r\nor I with them?  We do not understand each other.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ HESTER _behind_.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I implore you to do what I ask you.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What son has ever asked of his mother to make so hideous\r\na sacrifice?  None.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  What mother has ever refused to marry the father of her own\r\nchild?  None.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let me be the first, then.  I will not do it.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, you believe in religion, and you brought me up to\r\nbelieve in it also.  Well, surely your religion, the religion that you\r\ntaught me when I was a boy, mother, must tell you that I am right.  You\r\nknow it, you feel it.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not know it.  I do not feel it, nor will I ever\r\nstand before God\xe2\x80\x99s altar and ask God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing on so hideous a mockery\r\nas a marriage between me and George Harford.  I will not say the words\r\nthe Church bids us to say.  I will not say them.  I dare not.  How could\r\nI swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you\r\ndishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin?  No: marriage\r\nis a sacrament for those who love each other.  It is not for such as him,\r\nor such as me.  Gerald, to save you from the world\xe2\x80\x99s sneers and taunts I\r\nhave lied to the world.  For twenty years I have lied to the world.  I\r\ncould not tell the world the truth.  Who can, ever?  But not for my own\r\nsake will I lie to God, and in God\xe2\x80\x99s presence.  No, Gerald, no ceremony,\r\nChurch-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to George Harford.  It\r\nmay be that I am too bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left me\r\nricher, so that in the mire of my life I found the pearl of price, or\r\nwhat I thought would be so.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you now.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Men don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what mothers are.  I am no\r\ndifferent from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I\r\ndid, and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace.  And yet, to bear\r\nyou I had to look on death.  To nurture you I had to wrestle with it.\r\nDeath fought with me for you.  All women have to fight with death to keep\r\ntheir children.  Death, being childless, wants our children from us.\r\nGerald, when you were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave\r\nyou food.  Night and day all that long winter I tended you.  No office is\r\ntoo mean, no care too lowly for the thing we women love\xe2\x80\x94and oh! how _I_\r\nloved _you_.  Not Hannah, Samuel more.  And you needed love, for you were\r\nweakly, and only love could have kept you alive.  Only love can keep any\r\none alive.  And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain,\r\nand we always fancy that when they come to man\xe2\x80\x99s estate and know us\r\nbetter they will repay us.  But it is not so.  The world draws them from\r\nour side, and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are\r\nwith us, and have amusements from which we are barred, and interests that\r\nare not ours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life\r\nbitter they blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste\r\nits sweetness with them . . . You made many friends and went into their\r\nhouses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to\r\nfollow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat\r\nin darkness.  What should I have done in honest households?  My past was\r\never with me. . . . And you thought I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for the pleasant things\r\nof life.  I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them,\r\nfeeling I had no right.  You thought I was happier working amongst the\r\npoor.  That was my mission, you imagined.  It was not, but where else was\r\nI to go?  The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is\r\npure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the\r\nkiss of sin.  It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the\r\nlove you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . .\r\nAnd you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in\r\nChurch duties.  But where else could I turn?  God\xe2\x80\x99s house is the only\r\nhouse where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart,\r\nGerald, too much in my heart.  For, though day after day, at morn or\r\nevensong, I have knelt in God\xe2\x80\x99s house, I have never repented of my sin.\r\nHow could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit!  Even now\r\nthat you are bitter to me I cannot repent.  I do not.  You are more to me\r\nthan innocence.  I would rather be your mother\xe2\x80\x94oh! much rather!\xe2\x80\x94than have\r\nbeen always pure . . . Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand?  It is my\r\ndishonour that has made you so dear to me.  It is my disgrace that has\r\nbound you so closely to me.  It is the price I paid for you\xe2\x80\x94the price of\r\nsoul and body\xe2\x80\x94that makes me love you as I do.  Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to do\r\nthis horrible thing.  Child of my shame, be still the child of my shame!\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you loved me so much as that.  And I will\r\nbe a better son to you than I have been.  And you and I must never leave\r\neach other . . . but, mother . . . I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it . . . you must become\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s wife.  You must marry him.  It is your duty.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  [_Running forwards and embracing_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  No, no; you\r\nshall not.  That would be real dishonour, the first you have ever known.\r\nThat would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.  Leave him and come\r\nwith me.  There are other countries than England . . . Oh! other\r\ncountries over sea, better, wiser, and less unjust lands.  The world is\r\nvery wide and very big.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No, not for me.  For me the world is shrivelled to a\r\npalm\xe2\x80\x99s breadth, and where I walk there are thorns.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  It shall not be so.  We shall somewhere find green valleys and\r\nfresh waters, and if we weep, well, we shall weep together.  Have we not\r\nboth loved him?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Hester!\r\n\r\nHESTER.  [_Waving him back_.]  Don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t!  You cannot love me at all,\r\nunless you love her also.  You cannot honour me, unless she\xe2\x80\x99s holier to\r\nyou.  In her all womanhood is martyred.  Not she alone, but all of us are\r\nstricken in her house.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Hester, Hester, what shall I do?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Do you respect the man who is your father?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Respect him?  I despise him!  He is infamous.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  I thank you for saving me from him last night.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Ah, that is nothing.  I would die to save you.  But you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell me what to do now!\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Have I not thanked you for saving _me_?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  But what should I do?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Ask your own heart, not mine.  I never had a mother to save, or\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is hard\xe2\x80\x94he is hard.  Let me go away.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  [_Rushes over and kneels down bedside his mother_.]  Mother,\r\nforgive me: I have been to blame.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t kiss my hands: they are cold.  My heart is cold:\r\nsomething has broken it.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Ah, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that.  Hearts live by being wounded.  Pleasure may\r\nturn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but sorrow\xe2\x80\x94oh, sorrow\r\ncannot break it.  Besides, what sorrows have you now?  Why, at this\r\nmoment you are more dear to him than ever, _dear_ though you have _been_,\r\nand oh! how dear you _have_ been always.  Ah! be kind to him.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  You are my mother and my father all in one.  I need no second\r\nparent.  It was for you I spoke, for you alone.  Oh, say something,\r\nmother.  Have I but found one love to lose another?  Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that.\r\nO mother, you are cruel.  [_Gets up and flings himself sobbing on a\r\nsofa_.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_To_ HESTER.]  But has he found indeed another love?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  You know I have loved him always.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are very poor.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Who, being loved, is poor?  Oh, no one.  I hate my riches.  They\r\nare a burden.  Let him share it with me.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are disgraced.  We rank among the outcasts.\r\nGerald is nameless.  The sins of the parents should be visited on the\r\nchildren. It is God\xe2\x80\x99s law.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  I was wrong.  God\xe2\x80\x99s law is only Love.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rises_, _and taking_ HESTER _by the hand_, _goes\r\nslowly over to where_ GERALD _is lying on the sofa with his head buried\r\nin his hands_.  _She touches him and he looks up_.]  Gerald, I cannot\r\ngive you a father, but I have brought you a wife.\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  So she comes first, you are worthy.  And when you are\r\naway, Gerald . . . with . . . her\xe2\x80\x94oh, think of me sometimes.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforget me.  And when you pray, pray for me.  We should pray when we are\r\nhappiest, and you will be happy, Gerald.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think of leaving us?\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother, you won\xe2\x80\x99t leave us?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I might bring shame upon you!\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Mother!\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For a little then: and if you let me, near you always.\r\n\r\nHESTER.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Come out with us to the garden.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Later on, later on.  [_Exeunt_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT _goes towards door_ L.C.   _Stops at looking-glass over\r\nmantelpiece and looks into it_.  _Enter_ ALICE R.C.]\r\n\r\nALICE.  A gentleman to see you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Say I am not at home.  Show me the card.  [_Takes card\r\nfrom salver and looks at it_.]  Say I will not see him.\r\n\r\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _sees him in the glass and\r\nstarts_, _but does not turn round_.  _Exit_ ALICE.]  What can you have to\r\nsay to me to-day, George Harford?  You can have nothing to say to me.\r\nYou must leave this house.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you and me now,\r\nso some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three.  I\r\nassure you, he will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son may come in at any moment.  I saved you last\r\nnight.  I may not be able to save you again.  My son feels my dishonour\r\nstrongly, terribly strongly.  I beg you to go.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sitting down_.]  Last night was excessively\r\nunfortunate.  That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I\r\nwanted to kiss her.  What harm is there in a kiss?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  A kiss may ruin a human life, George\r\nHarford.  _I_ know that.  _I_ know that too well.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  We won\xe2\x80\x99t discuss that at present.  What is of\r\nimportance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son.  I am extremely fond\r\nof him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired his\r\nconduct last night immensely.  He took up the cudgels for that pretty\r\nprude with wonderful promptitude.  He is just what I should have liked a\r\nson of mine to be.  Except that no son of mine should ever take the side\r\nof the Puritans: that is always an error.  Now, what I propose is this.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  According to our ridiculous English laws, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlegitimise Gerald.  But I can leave him my property.  Illingworth is\r\nentailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a place.  He can have\r\nAshby, which is much prettier, Harborough, which has the best shooting in\r\nthe north of England, and the house in St. James Square.  What more can a\r\ngentleman require in this world?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing more, I am quite sure.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in\r\nthese democratic days.  As George Harford I had everything I wanted.  Now\r\nI have merely everything that other people want, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly so\r\npleasant.  Well, my proposal is this.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I told you I was not interested, and I beg you to go.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The boy is to be with you for six months in the year,\r\nand with me for the other six.  That is perfectly fair, is it not?  You\r\ncan have whatever allowance you like, and live where you choose.  As for\r\nyour past, no one knows anything about it except myself and Gerald.\r\nThere is the Puritan, of course, the Puritan in white muslin, but she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t count.  She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the story without explaining that she\r\nobjected to being kissed, could she?  And all the women would think her a\r\nfool and the men think her a bore.  And you need not be afraid that\r\nGerald won\xe2\x80\x99t be my heir.  I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you I have not the slightest\r\nintention of marrying.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You come too late.  My son has no need of you.  You are\r\nnot necessary.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you mean, Rachel?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That you are not necessary to Gerald\xe2\x80\x99s career.  He does\r\nnot require you.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do not understand you.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Look into the garden.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _rises and goes\r\ntowards window_.]  You had better not let them see you: you bring\r\nunpleasant memories.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _looks out and starts_.]  She\r\nloves him.  They love each other.  We are safe from you, and we are going\r\naway.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Where?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  We will not tell you, and if you find us we will not\r\nknow you.  You seem surprised.  What welcome would you get from the girl\r\nwhose lips you tried to soil, from the boy whose life you have shamed,\r\nfrom the mother whose dishonour comes from you?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You have grown hard, Rachel.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I was too weak once.  It is well for me that I have\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was very young at the time.  We men know life too\r\nearly.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  And we women know life too late.  That is the difference\r\nbetween men and women.  [_A pause_.]\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, I want my son.  My money may be of no use to\r\nhim now.  I may be of no use to him, but I want my son.  Bring us\r\ntogether, Rachel.  You can do it if you choose.  [_Sees letter on\r\ntable_.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is no room in my boy\xe2\x80\x99s life for you.  He is not\r\ninterested in _you_.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then why does he write to me?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What do you mean?\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What letter is this?  [_Takes up letter_.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That\xe2\x80\x94is nothing.  Give it to me.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is addressed to _me_.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are not to open it.  I forbid you to open it.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And in Gerald\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not to have been sent.  It is a letter he wrote\r\nto you this morning, before he saw me.  But he is sorry now he wrote it,\r\nvery sorry.  You are not to open it.  Give it to me.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It belongs to me.  [_Opens it_, _sits down and reads\r\nit slowly_. MRS. ARBUTHNOT _watches him all the time_.]  You have read\r\nthis letter, I suppose, Rachel?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You know what is in it?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes!\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t admit for a moment that the boy is right in\r\nwhat he says.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t admit that it is any duty of mine to marry you.  I\r\ndeny it entirely.  But to get my son back I am ready\xe2\x80\x94yes, I am ready to\r\nmarry you, Rachel\xe2\x80\x94and to treat you always with the deference and respect\r\ndue to my wife.  I will marry you as soon as you choose.  I give you my\r\nword of honour.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You made that promise to me once before and broke it.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I will keep it now.  And that will show you that I\r\nlove my son, at least as much as you love him.  For when I marry you,\r\nRachel, there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender.  High\r\nambitions, too, if any ambition is high.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I decline to marry you, Lord Illingworth.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you serious?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do tell me your reasons.  They would interest me\r\nenormously.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have already explained them to my son.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose they were intensely sentimental, weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey?  You women live by your emotions and for them.  You have no\r\nphilosophy of life.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are right.  We women live by our emotions and for\r\nthem.  By our passions, and for them, if you will.  I have two passions,\r\nLord Illingworth: my love of him, my hate of you.  You cannot kill those.\r\nThey feed each other.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What sort of love is that which needs to have hate as\r\nits brother?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is the sort of love I have for Gerald.  Do you think\r\nthat terrible?  Well it is terrible.  All love is terrible.  All love is\r\na tragedy.  I loved you once, Lord Illingworth.  Oh, what a tragedy for a\r\nwoman to have loved you!\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So you really refuse to marry me?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Because you hate me?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And does my son hate me as you do?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am glad of that, Rachel.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He merely despises you.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a pity!  What a pity for him, I mean.\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t be deceived, George.  Children begin by loving\r\ntheir parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely if ever do they\r\nforgive them.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Reads letter over again_, _very slowly_.]  May I ask\r\nby what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter, this beautiful,\r\npassionate letter, believe that you should not marry his father, the\r\nfather of your own child?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not I who made him see it.  It was another.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What _fin-de-si\xc3\xa8cle_ person?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The Puritan, Lord Illingworth.  [_A pause_.]\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces_, _then rises slowly and goes over to table\r\nwhere his hat and gloves are_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is standing close to the\r\ntable_.  _He picks up one of the gloves, and begins pulling it on_.]\r\nThere is not much then for me to do here, Rachel?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is good-bye, is it?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For ever, I hope, this time, Lord Illingworth.\r\n\r\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How curious!  At this moment you look exactly as you\r\nlooked the night you left me twenty years ago.  You have just the same\r\nexpression in your mouth.  Upon my word, Rachel, no woman ever loved me\r\nas you did.  Why, you gave yourself to me like a flower, to do anything I\r\nliked with.  You were the prettiest of playthings, the most fascinating\r\nof small romances . . . [_Pulls out watch_.]  Quarter to two!  Must be\r\nstrolling back to Hunstanton.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I shall see you there again.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I am, really.  It\xe2\x80\x99s been an amusing experience to have met\r\namongst people of one\xe2\x80\x99s own rank, and treated quite seriously too, one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmistress, and one\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _snatches up glove and strikes_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _across\r\nthe face with it_.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _starts_.  _He is dazed by the\r\ninsult of his punishment_.  _Then he controls himself_, _and goes to\r\nwindow and looks out at his son_.  _Sighs and leaves the room_.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Falls sobbing on the sofa_.]  He would have said it.\r\nHe would have said it.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ HESTER _from the garden_.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother.  You never came out after all.  So we have\r\ncome in to fetch you.  Mother, you have not been crying?  [_Kneels down\r\nbeside her_.]\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My boy!  My boy!  My boy!  [_Running her fingers through\r\nhis hair_.]\r\n\r\nHESTER.  [_Coming over_.]  But you have two children now.  You\xe2\x80\x99ll let me\r\nbe your daughter?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Looking up_.]  Would you choose me for a mother?\r\n\r\nHESTER.  You of all women I have ever known.\r\n\r\n[_They move towards the door leading into garden with their arms round\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s waists_.  GERALD _goes to table_ L.C. _for his hat_.  _On\r\nturning round he sees_ LORD ILLINGWORTH\xe2\x80\x99S _glove lying on the floor_,\r\n_and picks it up_.]\r\n\r\nGERALD.  Hallo, mother, whose glove is this?  You have had a visitor.\r\nWho was it?\r\n\r\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  Oh! no one.  No one in particular.\r\nA man of no importance.\r\n\r\n                                 CURTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
