He wore rough clothes that\r\nsmacked of the sea, and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious\r\nhall in which he found himself. He did not know what to do with his\r\ncap, and was stuffing it into his coat pocket when the other took it\r\nfrom him. The act was done quietly and naturally, and the awkward young\r\nfellow appreciated it. \xe2\x80\x9cHe understands,\xe2\x80\x9d was his thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll see me\r\nthrough all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked at the other\xe2\x80\x99s heels with a swing to his shoulders, and his\r\nlegs spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting up and\r\nsinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea. The wide rooms seemed\r\ntoo narrow for his rolling gait, and to himself he was in terror lest\r\nhis broad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the\r\nbric-a-brac from the low mantel. He recoiled from side to side between\r\nthe various objects and multiplied the hazards that in reality lodged\r\nonly in his mind. Between a grand piano and a centre-table piled high\r\nwith books was space for a half a dozen to walk abreast, yet he essayed\r\nit with trepidation. His heavy arms hung loosely at his sides. He did\r\nnot know what to do with those arms and hands, and when, to his excited\r\nvision, one arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table,\r\nhe lurched away like a frightened horse, barely missing the piano\r\nstool. He watched the easy walk of the other in front of him, and for\r\nthe first time realized that his walk was different from that of other\r\nmen. He experienced a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so\r\nuncouthly. The sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny\r\nbeads, and he paused and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on, Arthur, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, attempting to mask his anxiety with\r\nfacetious utterance. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is too much all at once for yours truly.\r\nGive me a chance to get my nerve. You know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to come, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nguess your fam\xe2\x80\x99ly ain\xe2\x80\x99t hankerin\xe2\x80\x99 to see me neither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reassuring answer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nfrightened at us. We\xe2\x80\x99re just homely people\xe2\x80\x94Hello, there\xe2\x80\x99s a letter for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stepped back to the table, tore open the envelope, and began to\r\nread, giving the stranger an opportunity to recover himself. And the\r\nstranger understood and appreciated. His was the gift of sympathy,\r\nunderstanding; and beneath his alarmed exterior that sympathetic\r\nprocess went on. He mopped his forehead dry and glanced about him with\r\na controlled face, though in the eyes there was an expression such as\r\nwild animals betray when they fear the trap. He was surrounded by the\r\nunknown, apprehensive of what might happen, ignorant of what he should\r\ndo, aware that he walked and bore himself awkwardly, fearful that every\r\nattribute and power of him was similarly afflicted. He was keenly\r\nsensitive, hopelessly self-conscious, and the amused glance that the\r\nother stole privily at him over the top of the letter burned into him\r\nlike a dagger-thrust. He saw the glance, but he gave no sign, for among\r\nthe things he had learned was discipline. Also, that dagger-thrust went\r\nto his pride. He cursed himself for having come, and at the same time\r\nresolved that, happen what would, having come, he would carry it\r\nthrough. The lines of his face hardened, and into his eyes came a\r\nfighting light. He looked about more unconcernedly, sharply observant,\r\nevery detail of the pretty interior registering itself on his brain.\r\nHis eyes were wide apart; nothing in their field of vision escaped; and\r\nas they drank in the beauty before them the fighting light died out and\r\na warm glow took its place. He was responsive to beauty, and here was\r\ncause to respond.\r\n\r\nAn oil painting caught and held him. A heavy surf thundered and burst\r\nover an outjutting rock; lowering storm-clouds covered the sky; and,\r\noutside the line of surf, a pilot-schooner, close-hauled, heeled over\r\ntill every detail of her deck was visible, was surging along against a\r\nstormy sunset sky. There was beauty, and it drew him irresistibly. He\r\nforgot his awkward walk and came closer to the painting, very close.\r\nThe beauty faded out of the canvas. His face expressed his\r\nbepuzzlement. He stared at what seemed a careless daub of paint, then\r\nstepped away. Immediately all the beauty flashed back into the canvas.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA trick picture,\xe2\x80\x9d was his thought, as he dismissed it, though in the\r\nmidst of the multitudinous impressions he was receiving he found time\r\nto feel a prod of indignation that so much beauty should be sacrificed\r\nto make a trick. He did not know painting. He had been brought up on\r\nchromos and lithographs that were always definite and sharp, near or\r\nfar. He had seen oil paintings, it was true, in the show windows of\r\nshops, but the glass of the windows had prevented his eager eyes from\r\napproaching too near.\r\n\r\nHe glanced around at his friend reading the letter and saw the books on\r\nthe table. Into his eyes leaped a wistfulness and a yearning as\r\npromptly as the yearning leaps into the eyes of a starving man at sight\r\nof food. An impulsive stride, with one lurch to right and left of the\r\nshoulders, brought him to the table, where he began affectionately\r\nhandling the books. He glanced at the titles and the authors\xe2\x80\x99 names,\r\nread fragments of text, caressing the volumes with his eyes and hands,\r\nand, once, recognized a book he had read. For the rest, they were\r\nstrange books and strange authors. He chanced upon a volume of\r\nSwinburne and began reading steadily, forgetful of where he was, his\r\nface glowing. Twice he closed the book on his forefinger to look at the\r\nname of the author. Swinburne! he would remember that name. That fellow\r\nhad eyes, and he had certainly seen color and flashing light. But who\r\nwas Swinburne? Was he dead a hundred years or so, like most of the\r\npoets? Or was he alive still, and writing? He turned to the title-page\r\n. . . yes, he had written other books; well, he would go to the free\r\nlibrary the first thing in the morning and try to get hold of some of\r\nSwinburne\xe2\x80\x99s stuff. He went back to the text and lost himself. He did\r\nnot notice that a young woman had entered the room. The first he knew\r\nwas when he heard Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s voice saying:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth, this is Mr. Eden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe book was closed on his forefinger, and before he turned he was\r\nthrilling to the first new impression, which was not of the girl, but\r\nof her brother\xe2\x80\x99s words. Under that muscled body of his he was a mass of\r\nquivering sensibilities. At the slightest impact of the outside world\r\nupon his consciousness, his thoughts, sympathies, and emotions leapt\r\nand played like lambent flame. He was extraordinarily receptive and\r\nresponsive, while his imagination, pitched high, was ever at work\r\nestablishing relations of likeness and difference. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Eden,\xe2\x80\x9d was what\r\nhe had thrilled to\xe2\x80\x94he who had been called \xe2\x80\x9cEden,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cMartin Eden,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\njust \xe2\x80\x9cMartin,\xe2\x80\x9d all his life. And \xe2\x80\x9c_Mister_!\xe2\x80\x9d It was certainly going\r\nsome, was his internal comment. His mind seemed to turn, on the\r\ninstant, into a vast camera obscura, and he saw arrayed around his\r\nconsciousness endless pictures from his life, of stoke-holes and\r\nforecastles, camps and beaches, jails and boozing-kens, fever-hospitals\r\nand slum streets, wherein the thread of association was the fashion in\r\nwhich he had been addressed in those various situations.\r\n\r\nAnd then he turned and saw the girl. The phantasmagoria of his brain\r\nvanished at sight of her. She was a pale, ethereal creature, with wide,\r\nspiritual blue eyes and a wealth of golden hair. He did not know how\r\nshe was dressed, except that the dress was as wonderful as she. He\r\nlikened her to a pale gold flower upon a slender stem. No, she was a\r\nspirit, a divinity, a goddess; such sublimated beauty was not of the\r\nearth. Or perhaps the books were right, and there were many such as she\r\nin the upper walks of life. She might well be sung by that chap,\r\nSwinburne. Perhaps he had had somebody like her in mind when he painted\r\nthat girl, Iseult, in the book there on the table. All this plethora of\r\nsight, and feeling, and thought occurred on the instant. There was no\r\npause of the realities wherein he moved. He saw her hand coming out to\r\nhis, and she looked him straight in the eyes as she shook hands,\r\nfrankly, like a man. The women he had known did not shake hands that\r\nway. For that matter, most of them did not shake hands at all. A flood\r\nof associations, visions of various ways he had made the acquaintance\r\nof women, rushed into his mind and threatened to swamp it. But he shook\r\nthem aside and looked at her. Never had he seen such a woman. The women\r\nhe had known! Immediately, beside her, on either hand, ranged the women\r\nhe had known. For an eternal second he stood in the midst of a portrait\r\ngallery, wherein she occupied the central place, while about her were\r\nlimned many women, all to be weighed and measured by a fleeting glance,\r\nherself the unit of weight and measure. He saw the weak and sickly\r\nfaces of the girls of the factories, and the simpering, boisterous\r\ngirls from the south of Market. There were women of the cattle camps,\r\nand swarthy cigarette-smoking women of Old Mexico. These, in turn, were\r\ncrowded out by Japanese women, doll-like, stepping mincingly on wooden\r\nclogs; by Eurasians, delicate featured, stamped with degeneracy; by\r\nfull-bodied South-Sea-Island women, flower-crowned and brown-skinned.\r\nAll these were blotted out by a grotesque and terrible nightmare\r\nbrood\xe2\x80\x94frowsy, shuffling creatures from the pavements of Whitechapel,\r\ngin-bloated hags of the stews, and all the vast hell\xe2\x80\x99s following of\r\nharpies, vile-mouthed and filthy, that under the guise of monstrous\r\nfemale form prey upon sailors, the scrapings of the ports, the scum and\r\nslime of the human pit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down, Mr. Eden?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nlooking forward to meeting you ever since Arthur told us. It was brave\r\nof you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand deprecatingly and muttered that it was nothing at\r\nall, what he had done, and that any fellow would have done it. She\r\nnoticed that the hand he waved was covered with fresh abrasions, in the\r\nprocess of healing, and a glance at the other loose-hanging hand showed\r\nit to be in the same condition. Also, with quick, critical eye, she\r\nnoted a scar on his cheek, another that peeped out from under the hair\r\nof the forehead, and a third that ran down and disappeared under the\r\nstarched collar. She repressed a smile at sight of the red line that\r\nmarked the chafe of the collar against the bronzed neck. He was\r\nevidently unused to stiff collars. Likewise her feminine eye took in\r\nthe clothes he wore, the cheap and unaesthetic cut, the wrinkling of\r\nthe coat across the shoulders, and the series of wrinkles in the\r\nsleeves that advertised bulging biceps muscles.\r\n\r\nWhile he waved his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at all,\r\nhe was obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair. He found time\r\nto admire the ease with which she sat down, then lurched toward a chair\r\nfacing her, overwhelmed with consciousness of the awkward figure he was\r\ncutting. This was a new experience for him. All his life, up to then,\r\nhe had been unaware of being either graceful or awkward. Such thoughts\r\nof self had never entered his mind. He sat down gingerly on the edge of\r\nthe chair, greatly worried by his hands. They were in the way wherever\r\nhe put them. Arthur was leaving the room, and Martin Eden followed his\r\nexit with longing eyes. He felt lost, alone there in the room with that\r\npale spirit of a woman. There was no bar-keeper upon whom to call for\r\ndrinks, no small boy to send around the corner for a can of beer and by\r\nmeans of that social fluid start the amenities of friendship flowing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have such a scar on your neck, Mr. Eden,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl was saying.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did it happen? I am sure it must have been some adventure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Mexican with a knife, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, moistening his parched\r\nlips and clearing his throat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was just a fight. After I got the\r\nknife away, he tried to bite off my nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBaldly as he had stated it, in his eyes was a rich vision of that hot,\r\nstarry night at Salina Cruz, the white strip of beach, the lights of\r\nthe sugar steamers in the harbor, the voices of the drunken sailors in\r\nthe distance, the jostling stevedores, the flaming passion in the\r\nMexican\xe2\x80\x99s face, the glint of the beast-eyes in the starlight, the sting\r\nof the steel in his neck, and the rush of blood, the crowd and the\r\ncries, the two bodies, his and the Mexican\xe2\x80\x99s, locked together, rolling\r\nover and over and tearing up the sand, and from away off somewhere the\r\nmellow tinkling of a guitar. Such was the picture, and he thrilled to\r\nthe memory of it, wondering if the man could paint it who had painted\r\nthe pilot-schooner on the wall. The white beach, the stars, and the\r\nlights of the sugar steamers would look great, he thought, and midway\r\non the sand the dark group of figures that surrounded the fighters. The\r\nknife occupied a place in the picture, he decided, and would show well,\r\nwith a sort of gleam, in the light of the stars. But of all this no\r\nhint had crept into his speech. \xe2\x80\x9cHe tried to bite off my nose,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said, in a faint, far voice, and he noticed the shock in\r\nher sensitive face.\r\n\r\nHe felt a shock himself, and a blush of embarrassment shone faintly on\r\nhis sunburned cheeks, though to him it burned as hotly as when his\r\ncheeks had been exposed to the open furnace-door in the fire-room. Such\r\nsordid things as stabbing affrays were evidently not fit subjects for\r\nconversation with a lady. People in the books, in her walk of life, did\r\nnot talk about such things\xe2\x80\x94perhaps they did not know about them,\r\neither.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief pause in the conversation they were trying to get\r\nstarted. Then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek. Even\r\nas she asked, he realized that she was making an effort to talk his\r\ntalk, and he resolved to get away from it and talk hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just an accident,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting his hand to his cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\r\nnight, in a calm, with a heavy sea running, the main-boom-lift carried\r\naway, an\xe2\x80\x99 next the tackle. The lift was wire, an\xe2\x80\x99 it was threshin\xe2\x80\x99\r\naround like a snake. The whole watch was tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to grab it, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nrushed in an\xe2\x80\x99 got swatted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, this time with an accent of comprehension, though\r\nsecretly his speech had been so much Greek to her and she was wondering\r\nwhat a _lift_ was and what _swatted_ meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis man Swineburne,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, attempting to put his plan into\r\nexecution and pronouncing the _i_ long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwineburne,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, with the same mispronunciation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwinburne,\xe2\x80\x9d she corrected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the chap,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered, his cheeks hot again. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long\r\nsince he died?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that he was dead.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him curiously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you make his acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never clapped eyes on him,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I read some of his\r\npoetry out of that book there on the table just before you come in. How\r\ndo you like his poetry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd thereat she began to talk quickly and easily upon the subject he\r\nhad suggested. He felt better, and settled back slightly from the edge\r\nof the chair, holding tightly to its arms with his hands, as if it\r\nmight get away from him and buck him to the floor. He had succeeded in\r\nmaking her talk her talk, and while she rattled on, he strove to follow\r\nher, marvelling at all the knowledge that was stowed away in that\r\npretty head of hers, and drinking in the pale beauty of her face.\r\nFollow her he did, though bothered by unfamiliar words that fell glibly\r\nfrom her lips and by critical phrases and thought-processes that were\r\nforeign to his mind, but that nevertheless stimulated his mind and set\r\nit tingling. Here was intellectual life, he thought, and here was\r\nbeauty, warm and wonderful as he had never dreamed it could be. He\r\nforgot himself and stared at her with hungry eyes. Here was something\r\nto live for, to win to, to fight for\xe2\x80\x94ay, and die for. The books were\r\ntrue. There were such women in the world. She was one of them. She lent\r\nwings to his imagination, and great, luminous canvases spread\r\nthemselves before him whereon loomed vague, gigantic figures of love\r\nand romance, and of heroic deeds for woman\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94for a pale woman, a\r\nflower of gold. And through the swaying, palpitant vision, as through a\r\nfairy mirage, he stared at the real woman, sitting there and talking of\r\nliterature and art. He listened as well, but he stared, unconscious of\r\nthe fixity of his gaze or of the fact that all that was essentially\r\nmasculine in his nature was shining in his eyes. But she, who knew\r\nlittle of the world of men, being a woman, was keenly aware of his\r\nburning eyes. She had never had men look at her in such fashion, and it\r\nembarrassed her. She stumbled and halted in her utterance. The thread\r\nof argument slipped from her. He frightened her, and at the same time\r\nit was strangely pleasant to be so looked upon. Her training warned her\r\nof peril and of wrong, subtle, mysterious, luring; while her instincts\r\nrang clarion-voiced through her being, impelling her to hurdle caste\r\nand place and gain to this traveller from another world, to this\r\nuncouth young fellow with lacerated hands and a line of raw red caused\r\nby the unaccustomed linen at his throat, who, all too evidently, was\r\nsoiled and tainted by ungracious existence. She was clean, and her\r\ncleanness revolted; but she was woman, and she was just beginning to\r\nlearn the paradox of woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I was saying\xe2\x80\x94what was I saying?\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off abruptly and laughed\r\nmerrily at her predicament.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was saying that this man Swinburne failed bein\xe2\x80\x99 a great poet\r\nbecause\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 that was as far as you got, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he prompted, while to\r\nhimself he seemed suddenly hungry, and delicious little thrills crawled\r\nup and down his spine at the sound of her laughter. Like silver, he\r\nthought to himself, like tinkling silver bells; and on the instant, and\r\nfor an instant, he was transported to a far land, where under pink\r\ncherry blossoms, he smoked a cigarette and listened to the bells of the\r\npeaked pagoda calling straw-sandalled devotees to worship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSwinburne fails, when all is said, because\r\nhe is, well, indelicate. There are many of his poems that should never\r\nbe read. Every line of the really great poets is filled with beautiful\r\ntruth, and calls to all that is high and noble in the human. Not a line\r\nof the great poets can be spared without impoverishing the world by\r\nthat much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was great,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hesitatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe little I read. I\r\nhad no idea he was such a\xe2\x80\x94a scoundrel. I guess that crops out in his\r\nother books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are many lines that could be spared from the book you were\r\nreading,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, her voice primly firm and dogmatic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 missed \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I read was the real goods.\r\nIt was all lighted up an\xe2\x80\x99 shining, an\xe2\x80\x99 it shun right into me an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlighted me up inside, like the sun or a searchlight. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way it\r\nlanded on me, but I guess I ain\xe2\x80\x99t up much on poetry, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off lamely. He was confused, painfully conscious of his\r\ninarticulateness. He had felt the bigness and glow of life in what he\r\nhad read, but his speech was inadequate. He could not express what he\r\nfelt, and to himself he likened himself to a sailor, in a strange ship,\r\non a dark night, groping about in the unfamiliar running rigging. Well,\r\nhe decided, it was up to him to get acquainted in this new world. He\r\nhad never seen anything that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the hang of when he wanted\r\nto and it was about time for him to want to learn to talk the things\r\nthat were inside of him so that she could understand. _She_ was bulking\r\nlarge on his horizon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow Longfellow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read \xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke in impulsively, spurred on to exhibit and\r\nmake the most of his little store of book knowledge, desirous of\r\nshowing her that he was not wholly a stupid clod. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Psalm of Life,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excelsior,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 . . . I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head and smiled, and he felt, somehow, that her smile\r\nwas tolerant, pitifully tolerant. He was a fool to attempt to make a\r\npretence that way. That Longfellow chap most likely had written\r\ncountless books of poetry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, miss, for buttin\xe2\x80\x99 in that way. I guess the real facts is\r\nthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothin\xe2\x80\x99 much about such things. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t in my class.\r\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to make it in my class.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt sounded like a threat. His voice was determined, his eyes were\r\nflashing, the lines of his face had grown harsh. And to her it seemed\r\nthat the angle of his jaw had changed; its pitch had become\r\nunpleasantly aggressive. At the same time a wave of intense virility\r\nseemed to surge out from him and impinge upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you could make it in\xe2\x80\x94in your class,\xe2\x80\x9d she finished with a\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer gaze rested for a moment on the muscular neck, heavy corded, almost\r\nbull-like, bronzed by the sun, spilling over with rugged health and\r\nstrength. And though he sat there, blushing and humble, again she felt\r\ndrawn to him. She was surprised by a wanton thought that rushed into\r\nher mind. It seemed to her that if she could lay her two hands upon\r\nthat neck that all its strength and vigor would flow out to her. She\r\nwas shocked by this thought. It seemed to reveal to her an undreamed\r\ndepravity in her nature. Besides, strength to her was a gross and\r\nbrutish thing. Her ideal of masculine beauty had always been slender\r\ngracefulness. Yet the thought still persisted. It bewildered her that\r\nshe should desire to place her hands on that sunburned neck. In truth,\r\nshe was far from robust, and the need of her body and mind was for\r\nstrength. But she did not know it. She knew only that no man had ever\r\naffected her before as this one had, who shocked her from moment to\r\nmoment with his awful grammar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t no invalid,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes down to hard-pan, I\r\ncan digest scrap-iron. But just now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got dyspepsia. Most of what\r\nyou was sayin\xe2\x80\x99 I can\xe2\x80\x99t digest. Never trained that way, you see. I like\r\nbooks and poetry, and what time I\xe2\x80\x99ve had I\xe2\x80\x99ve read \xe2\x80\x99em, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\nthought about \xe2\x80\x99em the way you have. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m like a navigator adrift on a strange sea without chart or compass.\r\nNow I want to get my bearin\xe2\x80\x99s. Mebbe you can put me right. How did you\r\nlearn all this you\xe2\x80\x99ve ben talkin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy going to school, I fancy, and by studying,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to school when I was a kid,\xe2\x80\x9d he began to object.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but I mean high school, and lectures, and the university.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to the university?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded in frank amazement. He\r\nfelt that she had become remoter from him by at least a million miles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going there now. I\xe2\x80\x99m taking special courses in English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not know what \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish\xe2\x80\x9d meant, but he made a mental note of that\r\nitem of ignorance and passed on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long would I have to study before I could go to the university?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\nShe beamed encouragement upon his desire for knowledge, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\ndepends upon how much studying you have already done. You have never\r\nattended high school? Of course not. But did you finish grammar\r\nschool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had two years to run, when I left,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I was always\r\nhonorably promoted at school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next moment, angry with himself for the boast, he had gripped the\r\narms of the chair so savagely that every finger-end was stinging. At\r\nthe same moment he became aware that a woman was entering the room. He\r\nsaw the girl leave her chair and trip swiftly across the floor to the\r\nnewcomer. They kissed each other, and, with arms around each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwaists, they advanced toward him. That must be her mother, he thought.\r\nShe was a tall, blond woman, slender, and stately, and beautiful. Her\r\ngown was what he might expect in such a house. His eyes delighted in\r\nthe graceful lines of it. She and her dress together reminded him of\r\nwomen on the stage. Then he remembered seeing similar grand ladies and\r\ngowns entering the London theatres while he stood and watched and the\r\npolicemen shoved him back into the drizzle beyond the awning. Next his\r\nmind leaped to the Grand Hotel at Yokohama, where, too, from the\r\nsidewalk, he had seen grand ladies. Then the city and the harbor of\r\nYokohama, in a thousand pictures, began flashing before his eyes. But\r\nhe swiftly dismissed the kaleidoscope of memory, oppressed by the\r\nurgent need of the present. He knew that he must stand up to be\r\nintroduced, and he struggled painfully to his feet, where he stood with\r\ntrousers bagging at the knees, his arms loose-hanging and ludicrous,\r\nhis face set hard for the impending ordeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process of getting into the dining room was a nightmare to him.\r\nBetween halts and stumbles, jerks and lurches, locomotion had at times\r\nseemed impossible. But at last he had made it, and was seated alongside\r\nof Her. The array of knives and forks frightened him. They bristled\r\nwith unknown perils, and he gazed at them, fascinated, till their\r\ndazzle became a background across which moved a succession of\r\nforecastle pictures, wherein he and his mates sat eating salt beef with\r\nsheath-knives and fingers, or scooping thick pea-soup out of pannikins\r\nby means of battered iron spoons. The stench of bad beef was in his\r\nnostrils, while in his ears, to the accompaniment of creaking timbers\r\nand groaning bulkheads, echoed the loud mouth-noises of the eaters. He\r\nwatched them eating, and decided that they ate like pigs. Well, he\r\nwould be careful here. He would make no noise. He would keep his mind\r\nupon it all the time.\r\n\r\nHe glanced around the table. Opposite him was Arthur, and Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother, Norman. They were her brothers, he reminded himself, and his\r\nheart warmed toward them. How they loved each other, the members of\r\nthis family! There flashed into his mind the picture of her mother, of\r\nthe kiss of greeting, and of the pair of them walking toward him with\r\narms entwined. Not in his world were such displays of affection between\r\nparents and children made. It was a revelation of the heights of\r\nexistence that were attained in the world above. It was the finest\r\nthing yet that he had seen in this small glimpse of that world. He was\r\nmoved deeply by appreciation of it, and his heart was melting with\r\nsympathetic tenderness. He had starved for love all his life. His\r\nnature craved love. It was an organic demand of his being. Yet he had\r\ngone without, and hardened himself in the process. He had not known\r\nthat he needed love. Nor did he know it now. He merely saw it in\r\noperation, and thrilled to it, and thought it fine, and high, and\r\nsplendid.\r\n\r\nHe was glad that Mr. Morse was not there. It was difficult enough\r\ngetting acquainted with her, and her mother, and her brother, Norman.\r\nArthur he already knew somewhat. The father would have been too much\r\nfor him, he felt sure. It seemed to him that he had never worked so\r\nhard in his life. The severest toil was child\xe2\x80\x99s play compared with\r\nthis. Tiny nodules of moisture stood out on his forehead, and his shirt\r\nwas wet with sweat from the exertion of doing so many unaccustomed\r\nthings at once. He had to eat as he had never eaten before, to handle\r\nstrange tools, to glance surreptitiously about and learn how to\r\naccomplish each new thing, to receive the flood of impressions that was\r\npouring in upon him and being mentally annotated and classified; to be\r\nconscious of a yearning for her that perturbed him in the form of a\r\ndull, aching restlessness; to feel the prod of desire to win to the\r\nwalk in life whereon she trod, and to have his mind ever and again\r\nstraying off in speculation and vague plans of how to reach to her.\r\nAlso, when his secret glance went across to Norman opposite him, or to\r\nany one else, to ascertain just what knife or fork was to be used in\r\nany particular occasion, that person\xe2\x80\x99s features were seized upon by his\r\nmind, which automatically strove to appraise them and to divine what\r\nthey were\xe2\x80\x94all in relation to her. Then he had to talk, to hear what was\r\nsaid to him and what was said back and forth, and to answer, when it\r\nwas necessary, with a tongue prone to looseness of speech that required\r\na constant curb. And to add confusion to confusion, there was the\r\nservant, an unceasing menace, that appeared noiselessly at his\r\nshoulder, a dire Sphinx that propounded puzzles and conundrums\r\ndemanding instantaneous solution. He was oppressed throughout the meal\r\nby the thought of finger-bowls. Irrelevantly, insistently, scores of\r\ntimes, he wondered when they would come on and what they looked like.\r\nHe had heard of such things, and now, sooner or later, somewhere in the\r\nnext few minutes, he would see them, sit at table with exalted beings\r\nwho used them\xe2\x80\x94ay, and he would use them himself. And most important of\r\nall, far down and yet always at the surface of his thought, was the\r\nproblem of how he should comport himself toward these persons. What\r\nshould his attitude be? He wrestled continually and anxiously with the\r\nproblem. There were cowardly suggestions that he should make believe,\r\nassume a part; and there were still more cowardly suggestions that\r\nwarned him he would fail in such course, that his nature was not fitted\r\nto live up to it, and that he would make a fool of himself.\r\n\r\nIt was during the first part of the dinner, struggling to decide upon\r\nhis attitude, that he was very quiet. He did not know that his\r\nquietness was giving the lie to Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s words of the day before, when\r\nthat brother of hers had announced that he was going to bring a wild\r\nman home to dinner and for them not to be alarmed, because they would\r\nfind him an interesting wild man. Martin Eden could not have found it\r\nin him, just then, to believe that her brother could be guilty of such\r\ntreachery\xe2\x80\x94especially when he had been the means of getting this\r\nparticular brother out of an unpleasant row. So he sat at table,\r\nperturbed by his own unfitness and at the same time charmed by all that\r\nwent on about him. For the first time he realized that eating was\r\nsomething more than a utilitarian function. He was unaware of what he\r\nate. It was merely food. He was feasting his love of beauty at this\r\ntable where eating was an aesthetic function. It was an intellectual\r\nfunction, too. His mind was stirred. He heard words spoken that were\r\nmeaningless to him, and other words that he had seen only in books and\r\nthat no man or woman he had known was of large enough mental caliber to\r\npronounce. When he heard such words dropping carelessly from the lips\r\nof the members of this marvellous family, her family, he thrilled with\r\ndelight. The romance, and beauty, and high vigor of the books were\r\ncoming true. He was in that rare and blissful state wherein a man sees\r\nhis dreams stalk out from the crannies of fantasy and become fact.\r\n\r\nNever had he been at such an altitude of living, and he kept himself in\r\nthe background, listening, observing, and pleasuring, replying in\r\nreticent monosyllables, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNo, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d to her,\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d to her mother. He curbed the\r\nimpulse, arising out of his sea-training, to say \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x9d to her brothers. He felt that it would be inappropriate and a\r\nconfession of inferiority on his part\xe2\x80\x94which would never do if he was to\r\nwin to her. Also, it was a dictate of his pride. \xe2\x80\x9cBy God!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried to\r\nhimself, once; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just as good as them, and if they do know lots that\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t, I could learn \xe2\x80\x99m a few myself, all the same!\xe2\x80\x9d And the next\r\nmoment, when she or her mother addressed him as \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Eden,\xe2\x80\x9d his\r\naggressive pride was forgotten, and he was glowing and warm with\r\ndelight. He was a civilized man, that was what he was, shoulder to\r\nshoulder, at dinner, with people he had read about in books. He was in\r\nthe books himself, adventuring through the printed pages of bound\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nBut while he belied Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s description, and appeared a gentle lamb\r\nrather than a wild man, he was racking his brains for a course of\r\naction. He was no gentle lamb, and the part of second fiddle would\r\nnever do for the high-pitched dominance of his nature. He talked only\r\nwhen he had to, and then his speech was like his walk to the table,\r\nfilled with jerks and halts as he groped in his polyglot vocabulary for\r\nwords, debating over words he knew were fit but which he feared he\r\ncould not pronounce, rejecting other words he knew would not be\r\nunderstood or would be raw and harsh. But all the time he was oppressed\r\nby the consciousness that this carefulness of diction was making a\r\nbooby of him, preventing him from expressing what he had in him. Also,\r\nhis love of freedom chafed against the restriction in much the same way\r\nhis neck chafed against the starched fetter of a collar. Besides, he\r\nwas confident that he could not keep it up. He was by nature powerful\r\nof thought and sensibility, and the creative spirit was restive and\r\nurgent. He was swiftly mastered by the concept or sensation in him that\r\nstruggled in birth-throes to receive expression and form, and then he\r\nforgot himself and where he was, and the old words\xe2\x80\x94the tools of speech\r\nhe knew\xe2\x80\x94slipped out.\r\n\r\nOnce, he declined something from the servant who interrupted and\r\npestered at his shoulder, and he said, shortly and emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cPow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the instant those at the table were keyed up and expectant, the\r\nservant was smugly pleased, and he was wallowing in mortification. But\r\nhe recovered himself quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the Kanaka for \xe2\x80\x98finish,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cand it just come out\r\nnaturally. It\xe2\x80\x99s spelt p-a-u.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe caught her curious and speculative eyes fixed on his hands, and,\r\nbeing in explanatory mood, he said:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just come down the Coast on one of the Pacific mail steamers. She\r\nwas behind time, an\xe2\x80\x99 around the Puget Sound ports we worked like\r\nniggers, storing cargo\xe2\x80\x94mixed freight, if you know what that means.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how the skin got knocked off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that,\xe2\x80\x9d she hastened to explain, in turn. \xe2\x80\x9cYour hands\r\nseemed too small for your body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis cheeks were hot. He took it as an exposure of another of his\r\ndeficiencies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said depreciatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t big enough to stand the\r\nstrain. I can hit like a mule with my arms and shoulders. They are too\r\nstrong, an\xe2\x80\x99 when I smash a man on the jaw the hands get smashed, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not happy at what he had said. He was filled with disgust at\r\nhimself. He had loosed the guard upon his tongue and talked about\r\nthings that were not nice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was brave of you to help Arthur the way you did\xe2\x80\x94and you a\r\nstranger,\xe2\x80\x9d she said tactfully, aware of his discomfiture though not of\r\nthe reason for it.\r\n\r\nHe, in turn, realized what she had done, and in the consequent warm\r\nsurge of gratefulness that overwhelmed him forgot his loose-worded\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nothin\xe2\x80\x99 at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAny guy \xe2\x80\x99ud do it for another.\r\nThat bunch of hoodlums was lookin\xe2\x80\x99 for trouble, an\xe2\x80\x99 Arthur wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbotherin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em none. They butted in on \xe2\x80\x99m, an\xe2\x80\x99 then I butted in on them\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 poked a few. That\xe2\x80\x99s where some of the skin off my hands went, along\r\nwith some of the teeth of the gang. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 missed it for\r\nanything. When I seen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, open-mouthed, on the verge of the pit of his own depravity\r\nand utter worthlessness to breathe the same air she did. And while\r\nArthur took up the tale, for the twentieth time, of his adventure with\r\nthe drunken hoodlums on the ferry-boat and of how Martin Eden had\r\nrushed in and rescued him, that individual, with frowning brows,\r\nmeditated upon the fool he had made of himself, and wrestled more\r\ndeterminedly with the problem of how he should conduct himself toward\r\nthese people. He certainly had not succeeded so far. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t of their\r\ntribe, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk their lingo, was the way he put it to\r\nhimself. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fake being their kind. The masquerade would fail,\r\nand besides, masquerade was foreign to his nature. There was no room in\r\nhim for sham or artifice. Whatever happened, he must be real. He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk their talk just yet, though in time he would. Upon that\r\nhe was resolved. But in the meantime, talk he must, and it must be his\r\nown talk, toned down, of course, so as to be comprehensible to them and\r\nso as not to shock them too much. And furthermore, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t claim,\r\nnot even by tacit acceptance, to be familiar with anything that was\r\nunfamiliar. In pursuance of this decision, when the two brothers,\r\ntalking university shop, had used \xe2\x80\x9ctrig\xe2\x80\x9d several times, Martin Eden\r\ndemanded:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is _trig_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrignometry,\xe2\x80\x9d Norman said; \xe2\x80\x9ca higher form of math.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is math?\xe2\x80\x9d was the next question, which, somehow, brought the\r\nlaugh on Norman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMathematics, arithmetic,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\nMartin Eden nodded. He had caught a glimpse of the apparently\r\nillimitable vistas of knowledge. What he saw took on tangibility. His\r\nabnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form. In\r\nthe alchemy of his brain, trigonometry and mathematics and the whole\r\nfield of knowledge which they betokened were transmuted into so much\r\nlandscape. The vistas he saw were vistas of green foliage and forest\r\nglades, all softly luminous or shot through with flashing lights. In\r\nthe distance, detail was veiled and blurred by a purple haze, but\r\nbehind this purple haze, he knew, was the glamour of the unknown, the\r\nlure of romance. It was like wine to him. Here was adventure, something\r\nto do with head and hand, a world to conquer\xe2\x80\x94and straightway from the\r\nback of his consciousness rushed the thought, _conquering, to win to\r\nher, that lily-pale spirit sitting beside him_.\r\n\r\nThe glimmering vision was rent asunder and dissipated by Arthur, who,\r\nall evening, had been trying to draw his wild man out. Martin Eden\r\nremembered his decision. For the first time he became himself,\r\nconsciously and deliberately at first, but soon lost in the joy of\r\ncreating in making life as he knew it appear before his listeners\xe2\x80\x99\r\neyes. He had been a member of the crew of the smuggling schooner\r\n_Halcyon_ when she was captured by a revenue cutter. He saw with wide\r\neyes, and he could tell what he saw. He brought the pulsing sea before\r\nthem, and the men and the ships upon the sea. He communicated his power\r\nof vision, till they saw with his eyes what he had seen. He selected\r\nfrom the vast mass of detail with an artist\xe2\x80\x99s touch, drawing pictures\r\nof life that glowed and burned with light and color, injecting movement\r\nso that his listeners surged along with him on the flood of rough\r\neloquence, enthusiasm, and power. At times he shocked them with the\r\nvividness of the narrative and his terms of speech, but beauty always\r\nfollowed fast upon the heels of violence, and tragedy was relieved by\r\nhumor, by interpretations of the strange twists and quirks of sailors\xe2\x80\x99\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nAnd while he talked, the girl looked at him with startled eyes. His\r\nfire warmed her. She wondered if she had been cold all her days. She\r\nwanted to lean toward this burning, blazing man that was like a volcano\r\nspouting forth strength, robustness, and health. She felt that she must\r\nlean toward him, and resisted by an effort. Then, too, there was the\r\ncounter impulse to shrink away from him. She was repelled by those\r\nlacerated hands, grimed by toil so that the very dirt of life was\r\ningrained in the flesh itself, by that red chafe of the collar and\r\nthose bulging muscles. His roughness frightened her; each roughness of\r\nspeech was an insult to her ear, each rough phase of his life an insult\r\nto her soul. And ever and again would come the draw of him, till she\r\nthought he must be evil to have such power over her. All that was most\r\nfirmly established in her mind was rocking. His romance and adventure\r\nwere battering at the conventions. Before his facile perils and ready\r\nlaugh, life was no longer an affair of serious effort and restraint,\r\nbut a toy, to be played with and turned topsy-turvy, carelessly to be\r\nlived and pleasured in, and carelessly to be flung aside. \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore,\r\nplay!\xe2\x80\x9d was the cry that rang through her. \xe2\x80\x9cLean toward him, if so you\r\nwill, and place your two hands upon his neck!\xe2\x80\x9d She wanted to cry out at\r\nthe recklessness of the thought, and in vain she appraised her own\r\ncleanness and culture and balanced all that she was against what he was\r\nnot. She glanced about her and saw the others gazing at him with rapt\r\nattention; and she would have despaired had not she seen horror in her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\xe2\x80\x94fascinated horror, it was true, but none the less horror.\r\nThis man from outer darkness was evil. Her mother saw it, and her\r\nmother was right. She would trust her mother\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in this as she\r\nhad always trusted it in all things. The fire of him was no longer\r\nwarm, and the fear of him was no longer poignant.\r\n\r\nLater, at the piano, she played for him, and at him, aggressively, with\r\nthe vague intent of emphasizing the impassableness of the gulf that\r\nseparated them. Her music was a club that she swung brutally upon his\r\nhead; and though it stunned him and crushed him down, it incited him.\r\nHe gazed upon her in awe. In his mind, as in her own, the gulf widened;\r\nbut faster than it widened, towered his ambition to win across it. But\r\nhe was too complicated a plexus of sensibilities to sit staring at a\r\ngulf a whole evening, especially when there was music. He was\r\nremarkably susceptible to music. It was like strong drink, firing him\r\nto audacities of feeling,\xe2\x80\x94a drug that laid hold of his imagination and\r\nwent cloud-soaring through the sky. It banished sordid fact, flooded\r\nhis mind with beauty, loosed romance and to its heels added wings. He\r\ndid not understand the music she played. It was different from the\r\ndance-hall piano-banging and blatant brass bands he had heard. But he\r\nhad caught hints of such music from the books, and he accepted her\r\nplaying largely on faith, patiently waiting, at first, for the lilting\r\nmeasures of pronounced and simple rhythm, puzzled because those\r\nmeasures were not long continued. Just as he caught the swing of them\r\nand started, his imagination attuned in flight, always they vanished\r\naway in a chaotic scramble of sounds that was meaningless to him, and\r\nthat dropped his imagination, an inert weight, back to earth.\r\n\r\nOnce, it entered his mind that there was a deliberate rebuff in all\r\nthis. He caught her spirit of antagonism and strove to divine the\r\nmessage that her hands pronounced upon the keys. Then he dismissed the\r\nthought as unworthy and impossible, and yielded himself more freely to\r\nthe music. The old delightful condition began to be induced. His feet\r\nwere no longer clay, and his flesh became spirit; before his eyes and\r\nbehind his eyes shone a great glory; and then the scene before him\r\nvanished and he was away, rocking over the world that was to him a very\r\ndear world. The known and the unknown were commingled in the\r\ndream-pageant that thronged his vision. He entered strange ports of\r\nsun-washed lands, and trod market-places among barbaric peoples that no\r\nman had ever seen. The scent of the spice islands was in his nostrils\r\nas he had known it on warm, breathless nights at sea, or he beat up\r\nagainst the southeast trades through long tropic days, sinking\r\npalm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea behind and lifting\r\npalm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea ahead. Swift as thought\r\nthe pictures came and went. One instant he was astride a broncho and\r\nflying through the fairy-colored Painted Desert country; the next\r\ninstant he was gazing down through shimmering heat into the whited\r\nsepulchre of Death Valley, or pulling an oar on a freezing ocean where\r\ngreat ice islands towered and glistened in the sun. He lay on a coral\r\nbeach where the cocoanuts grew down to the mellow-sounding surf. The\r\nhulk of an ancient wreck burned with blue fires, in the light of which\r\ndanced the _hula_ dancers to the barbaric love-calls of the singers,\r\nwho chanted to tinkling _ukuleles_ and rumbling tom-toms. It was a\r\nsensuous, tropic night. In the background a volcano crater was\r\nsilhouetted against the stars. Overhead drifted a pale crescent moon,\r\nand the Southern Cross burned low in the sky.\r\n\r\nHe was a harp; all life that he had known and that was his\r\nconsciousness was the strings; and the flood of music was a wind that\r\npoured against those strings and set them vibrating with memories and\r\ndreams. He did not merely feel. Sensation invested itself in form and\r\ncolor and radiance, and what his imagination dared, it objectified in\r\nsome sublimated and magic way. Past, present, and future mingled; and\r\nhe went on oscillating across the broad, warm world, through high\r\nadventure and noble deeds to Her\xe2\x80\x94ay, and with her, winning her, his arm\r\nabout her, and carrying her on in flight through the empery of his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nAnd she, glancing at him across her shoulder, saw something of all this\r\nin his face. It was a transfigured face, with great shining eyes that\r\ngazed beyond the veil of sound and saw behind it the leap and pulse of\r\nlife and the gigantic phantoms of the spirit. She was startled. The\r\nraw, stumbling lout was gone. The ill-fitting clothes, battered hands,\r\nand sunburned face remained; but these seemed the prison-bars through\r\nwhich she saw a great soul looking forth, inarticulate and dumb because\r\nof those feeble lips that would not give it speech. Only for a flashing\r\nmoment did she see this, then she saw the lout returned, and she\r\nlaughed at the whim of her fancy. But the impression of that fleeting\r\nglimpse lingered, and when the time came for him to beat a stumbling\r\nretreat and go, she lent him the volume of Swinburne, and another of\r\nBrowning\xe2\x80\x94she was studying Browning in one of her English courses. He\r\nseemed such a boy, as he stood blushing and stammering his thanks, that\r\na wave of pity, maternal in its prompting, welled up in her. She did\r\nnot remember the lout, nor the imprisoned soul, nor the man who had\r\nstared at her in all masculineness and delighted and frightened her.\r\nShe saw before her only a boy, who was shaking her hand with a hand so\r\ncalloused that it felt like a nutmeg-grater and rasped her skin, and\r\nwho was saying jerkily:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest time of my life. You see, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t used to things. . . \xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe looked about him helplessly. \xe2\x80\x9cTo people and houses like this. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall new to me, and I like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll call again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as he was saying good night to\r\nher brothers.\r\n\r\nHe pulled on his cap, lurched desperately through the doorway, and was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you think of him?\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is most interesting, a whiff of ozone,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow old is\r\nhe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty\xe2\x80\x94almost twenty-one. I asked him this afternoon. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nhe was that young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I am three years older, was the thought in her mind as she kissed\r\nher brothers goodnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Martin Eden went down the steps, his hand dropped into his coat\r\npocket. It came out with a brown rice paper and a pinch of Mexican\r\ntobacco, which were deftly rolled together into a cigarette. He drew\r\nthe first whiff of smoke deep into his lungs and expelled it in a long\r\nand lingering exhalation. \xe2\x80\x9cBy God!\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud, in a voice of awe\r\nand wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cBy God!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. And yet again he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cBy God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen his hand went to his collar, which he ripped out of the shirt and\r\nstuffed into his pocket. A cold drizzle was falling, but he bared his\r\nhead to it and unbuttoned his vest, swinging along in splendid\r\nunconcern. He was only dimly aware that it was raining. He was in an\r\necstasy, dreaming dreams and reconstructing the scenes just past.\r\n\r\nHe had met the woman at last\xe2\x80\x94the woman that he had thought little\r\nabout, not being given to thinking about women, but whom he had\r\nexpected, in a remote way, he would sometime meet. He had sat next to\r\nher at table. He had felt her hand in his, he had looked into her eyes\r\nand caught a vision of a beautiful spirit;\xe2\x80\x94but no more beautiful than\r\nthe eyes through which it shone, nor than the flesh that gave it\r\nexpression and form. He did not think of her flesh as flesh,\xe2\x80\x94which was\r\nnew to him; for of the women he had known that was the only way he\r\nthought. Her flesh was somehow different. He did not conceive of her\r\nbody as a body, subject to the ills and frailties of bodies. Her body\r\nwas more than the garb of her spirit. It was an emanation of her\r\nspirit, a pure and gracious crystallization of her divine essence. This\r\nfeeling of the divine startled him. It shocked him from his dreams to\r\nsober thought. No word, no clew, no hint, of the divine had ever\r\nreached him before. He had never believed in the divine. He had always\r\nbeen irreligious, scoffing good-naturedly at the sky-pilots and their\r\nimmortality of the soul. There was no life beyond, he had contended; it\r\nwas here and now, then darkness everlasting. But what he had seen in\r\nher eyes was soul\xe2\x80\x94immortal soul that could never die. No man he had\r\nknown, nor any woman, had given him the message of immortality. But she\r\nhad. She had whispered it to him the first moment she looked at him.\r\nHer face shimmered before his eyes as he walked along,\xe2\x80\x94pale and\r\nserious, sweet and sensitive, smiling with pity and tenderness as only\r\na spirit could smile, and pure as he had never dreamed purity could be.\r\nHer purity smote him like a blow. It startled him. He had known good\r\nand bad; but purity, as an attribute of existence, had never entered\r\nhis mind. And now, in her, he conceived purity to be the superlative of\r\ngoodness and of cleanness, the sum of which constituted eternal life.\r\n\r\nAnd promptly urged his ambition to grasp at eternal life. He was not\r\nfit to carry water for her\xe2\x80\x94he knew that; it was a miracle of luck and a\r\nfantastic stroke that had enabled him to see her and be with her and\r\ntalk with her that night. It was accidental. There was no merit in it.\r\nHe did not deserve such fortune. His mood was essentially religious. He\r\nwas humble and meek, filled with self-disparagement and abasement. In\r\nsuch frame of mind sinners come to the penitent form. He was convicted\r\nof sin. But as the meek and lowly at the penitent form catch splendid\r\nglimpses of their future lordly existence, so did he catch similar\r\nglimpses of the state he would gain to by possessing her. But this\r\npossession of her was dim and nebulous and totally different from\r\npossession as he had known it. Ambition soared on mad wings, and he saw\r\nhimself climbing the heights with her, sharing thoughts with her,\r\npleasuring in beautiful and noble things with her. It was a\r\nsoul-possession he dreamed, refined beyond any grossness, a free\r\ncomradeship of spirit that he could not put into definite thought. He\r\ndid not think it. For that matter, he did not think at all. Sensation\r\nusurped reason, and he was quivering and palpitant with emotions he had\r\nnever known, drifting deliciously on a sea of sensibility where feeling\r\nitself was exalted and spiritualized and carried beyond the summits of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHe staggered along like a drunken man, murmuring fervently aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cBy\r\nGod! By God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA policeman on a street corner eyed him suspiciously, then noted his\r\nsailor roll.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get it?\xe2\x80\x9d the policeman demanded.\r\n\r\nMartin Eden came back to earth. His was a fluid organism, swiftly\r\nadjustable, capable of flowing into and filling all sorts of nooks and\r\ncrannies. With the policeman\xe2\x80\x99s hail he was immediately his ordinary\r\nself, grasping the situation clearly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a beaut, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed back. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was talkin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nout loud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be singing next,\xe2\x80\x9d was the policeman\xe2\x80\x99s diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t. Gimme a match an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch the next car home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lighted his cigarette, said good night, and went on. \xe2\x80\x9cNow wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthat rattle you?\xe2\x80\x9d he ejaculated under his breath. \xe2\x80\x9cThat copper thought\r\nI was drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled to himself and meditated. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess I was,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think a woman\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x99d do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe caught a Telegraph Avenue car that was going to Berkeley. It was\r\ncrowded with youths and young men who were singing songs and ever and\r\nagain barking out college yells. He studied them curiously. They were\r\nuniversity boys. They went to the same university that she did, were in\r\nher class socially, could know her, could see her every day if they\r\nwanted to. He wondered that they did not want to, that they had been\r\nout having a good time instead of being with her that evening, talking\r\nwith her, sitting around her in a worshipful and adoring circle. His\r\nthoughts wandered on. He noticed one with narrow-slitted eyes and a\r\nloose-lipped mouth. That fellow was vicious, he decided. On shipboard\r\nhe would be a sneak, a whiner, a tattler. He, Martin Eden, was a better\r\nman than that fellow. The thought cheered him. It seemed to draw him\r\nnearer to Her. He began comparing himself with the students. He grew\r\nconscious of the muscled mechanism of his body and felt confident that\r\nhe was physically their master. But their heads were filled with\r\nknowledge that enabled them to talk her talk,\xe2\x80\x94the thought depressed\r\nhim. But what was a brain for? he demanded passionately. What they had\r\ndone, he could do. They had been studying about life from the books\r\nwhile he had been busy living life. His brain was just as full of\r\nknowledge as theirs, though it was a different kind of knowledge. How\r\nmany of them could tie a lanyard knot, or take a wheel or a lookout?\r\nHis life spread out before him in a series of pictures of danger and\r\ndaring, hardship and toil. He remembered his failures and scrapes in\r\nthe process of learning. He was that much to the good, anyway. Later on\r\nthey would have to begin living life and going through the mill as he\r\nhad gone. Very well. While they were busy with that, he could be\r\nlearning the other side of life from the books.\r\n\r\nAs the car crossed the zone of scattered dwellings that separated\r\nOakland from Berkeley, he kept a lookout for a familiar, two-story\r\nbuilding along the front of which ran the proud sign, HIGGINBOTHAM\xe2\x80\x99S\r\nCASH STORE. Martin Eden got off at this corner. He stared up for a\r\nmoment at the sign. It carried a message to him beyond its mere\r\nwording. A personality of smallness and egotism and petty\r\nunderhandedness seemed to emanate from the letters themselves. Bernard\r\nHigginbotham had married his sister, and he knew him well. He let\r\nhimself in with a latch-key and climbed the stairs to the second floor.\r\nHere lived his brother-in-law. The grocery was below. There was a smell\r\nof stale vegetables in the air. As he groped his way across the hall he\r\nstumbled over a toy-cart, left there by one of his numerous nephews and\r\nnieces, and brought up against a door with a resounding bang. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\npincher,\xe2\x80\x9d was his thought; \xe2\x80\x9ctoo miserly to burn two cents\xe2\x80\x99 worth of gas\r\nand save his boarders\xe2\x80\x99 necks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fumbled for the knob and entered a lighted room, where sat his\r\nsister and Bernard Higginbotham. She was patching a pair of his\r\ntrousers, while his lean body was distributed over two chairs, his feet\r\ndangling in dilapidated carpet-slippers over the edge of the second\r\nchair. He glanced across the top of the paper he was reading, showing a\r\npair of dark, insincere, sharp-staring eyes. Martin Eden never looked\r\nat him without experiencing a sense of repulsion. What his sister had\r\nseen in the man was beyond him. The other affected him as so much\r\nvermin, and always aroused in him an impulse to crush him under his\r\nfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cSome day I\xe2\x80\x99ll beat the face off of him,\xe2\x80\x9d was the way he often\r\nconsoled himself for enduring the man\xe2\x80\x99s existence. The eyes,\r\nweasel-like and cruel, were looking at him complainingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cOut with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had that door painted only last week,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Higginbotham half whined,\r\nhalf bullied; \xe2\x80\x9cand you know what union wages are. You should be more\r\ncareful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin had intended to reply, but he was struck by the hopelessness of\r\nit. He gazed across the monstrous sordidness of soul to a chromo on the\r\nwall. It surprised him. He had always liked it, but it seemed that now\r\nhe was seeing it for the first time. It was cheap, that was what it\r\nwas, like everything else in this house. His mind went back to the\r\nhouse he had just left, and he saw, first, the paintings, and next,\r\nHer, looking at him with melting sweetness as she shook his hand at\r\nleaving. He forgot where he was and Bernard Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s existence,\r\ntill that gentleman demanded:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeen a ghost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin came back and looked at the beady eyes, sneering, truculent,\r\ncowardly, and there leaped into his vision, as on a screen, the same\r\neyes when their owner was making a sale in the store below\xe2\x80\x94subservient\r\neyes, smug, and oily, and flattering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI seen a ghost. Good night. Good night,\r\nGertrude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started to leave the room, tripping over a loose seam in the\r\nslatternly carpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bang the door,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Higginbotham cautioned him.\r\n\r\nHe felt the blood crawl in his veins, but controlled himself and closed\r\nthe door softly behind him.\r\n\r\nMr. Higginbotham looked at his wife exultantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s ben drinkin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he proclaimed in a hoarse whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you he\r\nwould.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head resignedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis eyes was pretty shiny,\xe2\x80\x9d she confessed; \xe2\x80\x9cand he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have no\r\ncollar, though he went away with one. But mebbe he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have more\xe2\x80\x99n a\r\ncouple of glasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand up straight,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cI watched him.\r\nHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk across the floor without stumblin\xe2\x80\x99. You heard \xe2\x80\x99m\r\nyourself almost fall down in the hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it was over Alice\xe2\x80\x99s cart,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see it in\r\nthe dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s voice and wrath began to rise. All day he effaced\r\nhimself in the store, reserving for the evening, with his family, the\r\nprivilege of being himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you that precious brother of yours was drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice was cold, sharp, and final, his lips stamping the enunciation\r\nof each word like the die of a machine. His wife sighed and remained\r\nsilent. She was a large, stout woman, always dressed slatternly and\r\nalways tired from the burdens of her flesh, her work, and her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got it in him, I tell you, from his father,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Higginbotham\r\nwent on accusingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99ll croak in the gutter the same way. You\r\nknow that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded, sighed, and went on stitching. They were agreed that Martin\r\nhad come home drunk. They did not have it in their souls to know\r\nbeauty, or they would have known that those shining eyes and that\r\nglowing face betokened youth\xe2\x80\x99s first vision of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSettin\xe2\x80\x99 a fine example to the children,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Higginbotham snorted,\r\nsuddenly, in the silence for which his wife was responsible and which\r\nhe resented. Sometimes he almost wished she would oppose him more. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nhe does it again, he\xe2\x80\x99s got to get out. Understand! I won\xe2\x80\x99t put up with\r\nhis shinanigan\xe2\x80\x94debotchin\xe2\x80\x99 innocent children with his boozing.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nHigginbotham liked the word, which was a new one in his vocabulary,\r\nrecently gleaned from a newspaper column. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it is,\r\ndebotchin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no other name for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill his wife sighed, shook her head sorrowfully, and stitched on. Mr.\r\nHigginbotham resumed the newspaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he paid last week\xe2\x80\x99s board?\xe2\x80\x9d he shot across the top of the\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\nShe nodded, then added, \xe2\x80\x9cHe still has some money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is he goin\xe2\x80\x99 to sea again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen his pay-day\xe2\x80\x99s spent, I guess,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was over to San\r\nFrancisco yesterday looking for a ship. But he\xe2\x80\x99s got money, yet, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s particular about the kind of ship he signs for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not for a deck-swab like him to put on airs,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Higginbotham\r\nsnorted. \xe2\x80\x9cParticular! Him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said something about a schooner that\xe2\x80\x99s gettin\xe2\x80\x99 ready to go off to\r\nsome outlandish place to look for buried treasure, that he\xe2\x80\x99d sail on\r\nher if his money held out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he only wanted to steady down, I\xe2\x80\x99d give him a job drivin\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nwagon,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband said, but with no trace of benevolence in his\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cTom\xe2\x80\x99s quit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis wife looked alarm and interrogation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuit to-night. Is goin\xe2\x80\x99 to work for Carruthers. They paid \xe2\x80\x99m more\xe2\x80\x99n I\r\ncould afford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you you\xe2\x80\x99d lose \xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was worth more\xe2\x80\x99n you was\r\ngiving him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here, old woman,\xe2\x80\x9d Higginbotham bullied, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the thousandth\r\ntime I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you to keep your nose out of the business. I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nyou again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d she sniffled. \xe2\x80\x9cTom was a good boy.\xe2\x80\x9d Her husband glared\r\nat her. This was unqualified defiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that brother of yours was worth his salt, he could take the wagon,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe snorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe pays his board, just the same,\xe2\x80\x9d was the retort. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nbrother, an\xe2\x80\x99 so long as he don\xe2\x80\x99t owe you money you\xe2\x80\x99ve got no right to\r\nbe jumping on him all the time. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some feelings, if I have been\r\nmarried to you for seven years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you tell \xe2\x80\x99m you\xe2\x80\x99d charge him for gas if he goes on readin\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nbed?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\nMrs. Higginbotham made no reply. Her revolt faded away, her spirit\r\nwilting down into her tired flesh. Her husband was triumphant. He had\r\nher. His eyes snapped vindictively, while his ears joyed in the\r\nsniffles she emitted. He extracted great happiness from squelching her,\r\nand she squelched easily these days, though it had been different in\r\nthe first years of their married life, before the brood of children and\r\nhis incessant nagging had sapped her energy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you tell \xe2\x80\x99m to-morrow, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I just want to\r\ntell you, before I forget it, that you\xe2\x80\x99d better send for Marian\r\nto-morrow to take care of the children. With Tom quit, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be\r\nout on the wagon, an\xe2\x80\x99 you can make up your mind to it to be down below\r\nwaitin\xe2\x80\x99 on the counter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s wash day,\xe2\x80\x9d she objected weakly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up early, then, an\xe2\x80\x99 do it first. I won\xe2\x80\x99t start out till ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe crinkled the paper viciously and resumed his reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Eden, with blood still crawling from contact with his\r\nbrother-in-law, felt his way along the unlighted back hall and entered\r\nhis room, a tiny cubbyhole with space for a bed, a wash-stand, and one\r\nchair. Mr. Higginbotham was too thrifty to keep a servant when his wife\r\ncould do the work. Besides, the servant\xe2\x80\x99s room enabled them to take in\r\ntwo boarders instead of one. Martin placed the Swinburne and Browning\r\non the chair, took off his coat, and sat down on the bed. A screeching\r\nof asthmatic springs greeted the weight of his body, but he did not\r\nnotice them. He started to take off his shoes, but fell to staring at\r\nthe white plaster wall opposite him, broken by long streaks of dirty\r\nbrown where rain had leaked through the roof. On this befouled\r\nbackground visions began to flow and burn. He forgot his shoes and\r\nstared long, till his lips began to move and he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cRuth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth.\xe2\x80\x9d He had not thought a simple sound could be so beautiful. It\r\ndelighted his ear, and he grew intoxicated with the repetition of it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a talisman, a magic word to conjure with. Each time he\r\nmurmured it, her face shimmered before him, suffusing the foul wall\r\nwith a golden radiance. This radiance did not stop at the wall. It\r\nextended on into infinity, and through its golden depths his soul went\r\nquesting after hers. The best that was in him was out in splendid\r\nflood. The very thought of her ennobled and purified him, made him\r\nbetter, and made him want to be better. This was new to him. He had\r\nnever known women who had made him better. They had always had the\r\ncounter effect of making him beastly. He did not know that many of them\r\nhad done their best, bad as it was. Never having been conscious of\r\nhimself, he did not know that he had that in his being that drew love\r\nfrom women and which had been the cause of their reaching out for his\r\nyouth. Though they had often bothered him, he had never bothered about\r\nthem; and he would never have dreamed that there were women who had\r\nbeen better because of him. Always in sublime carelessness had he\r\nlived, till now, and now it seemed to him that they had always reached\r\nout and dragged at him with vile hands. This was not just to them, nor\r\nto himself. But he, who for the first time was becoming conscious of\r\nhimself, was in no condition to judge, and he burned with shame as he\r\nstared at the vision of his infamy.\r\n\r\nHe got up abruptly and tried to see himself in the dirty looking-glass\r\nover the wash-stand. He passed a towel over it and looked again, long\r\nand carefully. It was the first time he had ever really seen himself.\r\nHis eyes were made for seeing, but up to that moment they had been\r\nfilled with the ever changing panorama of the world, at which he had\r\nbeen too busy gazing, ever to gaze at himself. He saw the head and face\r\nof a young fellow of twenty, but, being unused to such appraisement, he\r\ndid not know how to value it. Above a square-domed forehead he saw a\r\nmop of brown hair, nut-brown, with a wave to it and hints of curls that\r\nwere a delight to any woman, making hands tingle to stroke it and\r\nfingers tingle to pass caresses through it. But he passed it by as\r\nwithout merit, in Her eyes, and dwelt long and thoughtfully on the\r\nhigh, square forehead,\xe2\x80\x94striving to penetrate it and learn the quality\r\nof its content. What kind of a brain lay behind there? was his\r\ninsistent interrogation. What was it capable of? How far would it take\r\nhim? Would it take him to her?\r\n\r\nHe wondered if there was soul in those steel-gray eyes that were often\r\nquite blue of color and that were strong with the briny airs of the\r\nsun-washed deep. He wondered, also, how his eyes looked to her. He\r\ntried to imagine himself she, gazing into those eyes of his, but failed\r\nin the jugglery. He could successfully put himself inside other men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nminds, but they had to be men whose ways of life he knew. He did not\r\nknow her way of life. She was wonder and mystery, and how could he\r\nguess one thought of hers? Well, they were honest eyes, he concluded,\r\nand in them was neither smallness nor meanness. The brown sunburn of\r\nhis face surprised him. He had not dreamed he was so black. He rolled\r\nup his shirt-sleeve and compared the white underside of the arm with\r\nhis face. Yes, he was a white man, after all. But the arms were\r\nsunburned, too. He twisted his arm, rolled the biceps over with his\r\nother hand, and gazed underneath where he was least touched by the sun.\r\nIt was very white. He laughed at his bronzed face in the glass at the\r\nthought that it was once as white as the underside of his arm; nor did\r\nhe dream that in the world there were few pale spirits of women who\r\ncould boast fairer or smoother skins than he\xe2\x80\x94fairer than where he had\r\nescaped the ravages of the sun.\r\n\r\nHis might have been a cherub\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, had not the full, sensuous lips a\r\ntrick, under stress, of drawing firmly across the teeth. At times, so\r\ntightly did they draw, the mouth became stern and harsh, even ascetic.\r\nThey were the lips of a fighter and of a lover. They could taste the\r\nsweetness of life with relish, and they could put the sweetness aside\r\nand command life. The chin and jaw, strong and just hinting of square\r\naggressiveness, helped the lips to command life. Strength balanced\r\nsensuousness and had upon it a tonic effect, compelling him to love\r\nbeauty that was healthy and making him vibrate to sensations that were\r\nwholesome. And between the lips were teeth that had never known nor\r\nneeded the dentist\xe2\x80\x99s care. They were white and strong and regular, he\r\ndecided, as he looked at them. But as he looked, he began to be\r\ntroubled. Somewhere, stored away in the recesses of his mind and\r\nvaguely remembered, was the impression that there were people who\r\nwashed their teeth every day. They were the people from up above\xe2\x80\x94people\r\nin her class. She must wash her teeth every day, too. What would she\r\nthink if she learned that he had never washed his teeth in all the days\r\nof his life? He resolved to get a tooth-brush and form the habit. He\r\nwould begin at once, to-morrow. It was not by mere achievement that he\r\ncould hope to win to her. He must make a personal reform in all things,\r\neven to tooth-washing and neck-gear, though a starched collar affected\r\nhim as a renunciation of freedom.\r\n\r\nHe held up his hand, rubbing the ball of the thumb over the calloused\r\npalm and gazing at the dirt that was ingrained in the flesh itself and\r\nwhich no brush could scrub away. How different was her palm! He\r\nthrilled deliciously at the remembrance. Like a rose-petal, he thought;\r\ncool and soft as a snowflake. He had never thought that a mere woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand could be so sweetly soft. He caught himself imagining the wonder\r\nof a caress from such a hand, and flushed guiltily. It was too gross a\r\nthought for her. In ways it seemed to impugn her high spirituality. She\r\nwas a pale, slender spirit, exalted far beyond the flesh; but\r\nnevertheless the softness of her palm persisted in his thoughts. He was\r\nused to the harsh callousness of factory girls and working women. Well\r\nhe knew why their hands were rough; but this hand of hers . . . It was\r\nsoft because she had never used it to work with. The gulf yawned\r\nbetween her and him at the awesome thought of a person who did not have\r\nto work for a living. He suddenly saw the aristocracy of the people who\r\ndid not labor. It towered before him on the wall, a figure in brass,\r\narrogant and powerful. He had worked himself; his first memories seemed\r\nconnected with work, and all his family had worked. There was Gertrude.\r\nWhen her hands were not hard from the endless housework, they were\r\nswollen and red like boiled beef, what of the washing. And there was\r\nhis sister Marian. She had worked in the cannery the preceding summer,\r\nand her slim, pretty hands were all scarred with the tomato-knives.\r\nBesides, the tips of two of her fingers had been left in the cutting\r\nmachine at the paper-box factory the preceding winter. He remembered\r\nthe hard palms of his mother as she lay in her coffin. And his father\r\nhad worked to the last fading gasp; the horned growth on his hands must\r\nhave been half an inch thick when he died. But Her hands were soft, and\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and her brothers\xe2\x80\x99. This last came to him as a\r\nsurprise; it was tremendously indicative of the highness of their\r\ncaste, of the enormous distance that stretched between her and him.\r\n\r\nHe sat back on the bed with a bitter laugh, and finished taking off his\r\nshoes. He was a fool; he had been made drunken by a woman\xe2\x80\x99s face and by\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s soft, white hands. And then, suddenly, before his eyes, on\r\nthe foul plaster-wall appeared a vision. He stood in front of a gloomy\r\ntenement house. It was night-time, in the East End of London, and\r\nbefore him stood Margey, a little factory girl of fifteen. He had seen\r\nher home after the bean-feast. She lived in that gloomy tenement, a\r\nplace not fit for swine. His hand was going out to hers as he said good\r\nnight. She had put her lips up to be kissed, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to\r\nkiss her. Somehow he was afraid of her. And then her hand closed on his\r\nand pressed feverishly. He felt her callouses grind and grate on his,\r\nand a great wave of pity welled over him. He saw her yearning, hungry\r\neyes, and her ill-fed female form which had been rushed from childhood\r\ninto a frightened and ferocious maturity; then he put his arms about\r\nher in large tolerance and stooped and kissed her on the lips. Her glad\r\nlittle cry rang in his ears, and he felt her clinging to him like a\r\ncat. Poor little starveling! He continued to stare at the vision of\r\nwhat had happened in the long ago. His flesh was crawling as it had\r\ncrawled that night when she clung to him, and his heart was warm with\r\npity. It was a gray scene, greasy gray, and the rain drizzled greasily\r\non the pavement stones. And then a radiant glory shone on the wall, and\r\nup through the other vision, displacing it, glimmered Her pale face\r\nunder its crown of golden hair, remote and inaccessible as a star.\r\n\r\nHe took the Browning and the Swinburne from the chair and kissed them.\r\nJust the same, she told me to call again, he thought. He took another\r\nlook at himself in the glass, and said aloud, with great solemnity:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartin Eden, the first thing to-morrow you go to the free library an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nread up on etiquette. Understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned off the gas, and the springs shrieked under his body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to quit cussin\xe2\x80\x99, Martin, old boy; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to quit\r\ncussin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud.\r\n\r\nThen he dozed off to sleep and to dream dreams that for madness and\r\naudacity rivalled those of poppy-eaters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe awoke next morning from rosy scenes of dream to a steamy atmosphere\r\nthat smelled of soapsuds and dirty clothes, and that was vibrant with\r\nthe jar and jangle of tormented life. As he came out of his room he\r\nheard the slosh of water, a sharp exclamation, and a resounding smack\r\nas his sister visited her irritation upon one of her numerous progeny.\r\nThe squall of the child went through him like a knife. He was aware\r\nthat the whole thing, the very air he breathed, was repulsive and mean.\r\nHow different, he thought, from the atmosphere of beauty and repose of\r\nthe house wherein Ruth dwelt. There it was all spiritual. Here it was\r\nall material, and meanly material.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Alfred,\xe2\x80\x9d he called to the crying child, at the same time\r\nthrusting his hand into his trousers pocket, where he carried his money\r\nloose in the same large way that he lived life in general. He put a\r\nquarter in the youngster\xe2\x80\x99s hand and held him in his arms a moment,\r\nsoothing his sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cNow run along and get some candy, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget\r\nto give some to your brothers and sisters. Be sure and get the kind\r\nthat lasts longest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sister lifted a flushed face from the wash-tub and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nickel\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 ben enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just like you, no idea of\r\nthe value of money. The child\xe2\x80\x99ll eat himself sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, sis,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered jovially. \xe2\x80\x9cMy money\xe2\x80\x99ll take care\r\nof itself. If you weren\xe2\x80\x99t so busy, I\xe2\x80\x99d kiss you good morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wanted to be affectionate to this sister, who was good, and who, in\r\nher way, he knew, loved him. But, somehow, she grew less herself as the\r\nyears went by, and more and more baffling. It was the hard work, the\r\nmany children, and the nagging of her husband, he decided, that had\r\nchanged her. It came to him, in a flash of fancy, that her nature\r\nseemed taking on the attributes of stale vegetables, smelly soapsuds,\r\nand of the greasy dimes, nickels, and quarters she took in over the\r\ncounter of the store.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo along an\xe2\x80\x99 get your breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d she said roughly, though secretly\r\npleased. Of all her wandering brood of brothers he had always been her\r\nfavorite. \xe2\x80\x9cI declare I _will_ kiss you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a sudden stir\r\nat her heart.\r\n\r\nWith thumb and forefinger she swept the dripping suds first from one\r\narm and then from the other. He put his arms round her massive waist\r\nand kissed her wet steamy lips. The tears welled into her eyes\xe2\x80\x94not so\r\nmuch from strength of feeling as from the weakness of chronic overwork.\r\nShe shoved him away from her, but not before he caught a glimpse of her\r\nmoist eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find breakfast in the oven,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cJim ought to\r\nbe up now. I had to get up early for the washing. Now get along with\r\nyou and get out of the house early. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be nice to-day, what of\r\nTom quittin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 nobody but Bernard to drive the wagon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin went into the kitchen with a sinking heart, the image of her red\r\nface and slatternly form eating its way like acid into his brain. She\r\nmight love him if she only had some time, he concluded. But she was\r\nworked to death. Bernard Higginbotham was a brute to work her so hard.\r\nBut he could not help but feel, on the other hand, that there had not\r\nbeen anything beautiful in that kiss. It was true, it was an unusual\r\nkiss. For years she had kissed him only when he returned from voyages\r\nor departed on voyages. But this kiss had tasted of soapsuds, and the\r\nlips, he had noticed, were flabby. There had been no quick, vigorous\r\nlip-pressure such as should accompany any kiss. Hers was the kiss of a\r\ntired woman who had been tired so long that she had forgotten how to\r\nkiss. He remembered her as a girl, before her marriage, when she would\r\ndance with the best, all night, after a hard day\xe2\x80\x99s work at the laundry,\r\nand think nothing of leaving the dance to go to another day\xe2\x80\x99s hard\r\nwork. And then he thought of Ruth and the cool sweetness that must\r\nreside in her lips as it resided in all about her. Her kiss would be\r\nlike her hand-shake or the way she looked at one, firm and frank. In\r\nimagination he dared to think of her lips on his, and so vividly did he\r\nimagine that he went dizzy at the thought and seemed to rift through\r\nclouds of rose-petals, filling his brain with their perfume.\r\n\r\nIn the kitchen he found Jim, the other boarder, eating mush very\r\nlanguidly, with a sick, far-away look in his eyes. Jim was a plumber\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napprentice whose weak chin and hedonistic temperament, coupled with a\r\ncertain nervous stupidity, promised to take him nowhere in the race for\r\nbread and butter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you eat?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, as Martin dipped dolefully into the\r\ncold, half-cooked oatmeal mush. \xe2\x80\x9cWas you drunk again last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin shook his head. He was oppressed by the utter squalidness of it\r\nall. Ruth Morse seemed farther removed than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was,\xe2\x80\x9d Jim went on with a boastful, nervous giggle. \xe2\x80\x9cI was loaded\r\nright to the neck. Oh, she was a daisy. Billy brought me home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin nodded that he heard,\xe2\x80\x94it was a habit of nature with him to pay\r\nheed to whoever talked to him,\xe2\x80\x94and poured a cup of lukewarm coffee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoin\xe2\x80\x99 to the Lotus Club dance to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d Jim demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto have beer, an\xe2\x80\x99 if that Temescal bunch comes, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a\r\nrough-house. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, though. I\xe2\x80\x99m takin\xe2\x80\x99 my lady friend just the\r\nsame. Cripes, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a taste in my mouth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a wry face and attempted to wash the taste away with coffee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye know Julia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s my lady friend,\xe2\x80\x9d Jim explained, \xe2\x80\x9cand she\xe2\x80\x99s a peach. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nintroduce you to her, only you\xe2\x80\x99d win her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what the girls\r\nsee in you, honest I don\xe2\x80\x99t; but the way you win them away from the\r\nfellers is sickenin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never got any away from you,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered uninterestedly. The\r\nbreakfast had to be got through somehow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you did, too,\xe2\x80\x9d the other asserted warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was Maggie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever had anything to do with her. Never danced with her except that\r\none night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, an\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s just what did it,\xe2\x80\x9d Jim cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just danced\r\nwith her an\xe2\x80\x99 looked at her, an\xe2\x80\x99 it was all off. Of course you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean nothin\xe2\x80\x99 by it, but it settled me for keeps. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at me\r\nagain. Always askin\xe2\x80\x99 about you. She\xe2\x80\x99d have made fast dates enough with\r\nyou if you\xe2\x80\x99d wanted to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary. I was left at the pole.\xe2\x80\x9d Jim looked at him\r\nadmiringly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99ye do it, anyway, Mart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy not carin\xe2\x80\x99 about \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean makin\xe2\x80\x99 b\xe2\x80\x99lieve you don\xe2\x80\x99t care about them?\xe2\x80\x9d Jim queried\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\nMartin considered for a moment, then answered, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that will do,\r\nbut with me I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s different. I never have cared\xe2\x80\x94much. If you can\r\nput it on, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, most likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 ben up at Riley\xe2\x80\x99s barn last night,\xe2\x80\x9d Jim announced\r\ninconsequently. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of the fellers put on the gloves. There was a\r\npeach from West Oakland. They called \xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x98The Rat.\xe2\x80\x99 Slick as silk. No\r\none could touch \xe2\x80\x99m. We was all wishin\xe2\x80\x99 you was there. Where was you\r\nanyway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown in Oakland,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the show?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin shoved his plate away and got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComin\xe2\x80\x99 to the dance to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d the other called after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think not,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nHe went downstairs and out into the street, breathing great breaths of\r\nair. He had been suffocating in that atmosphere, while the apprentice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchatter had driven him frantic. There had been times when it was all he\r\ncould do to refrain from reaching over and mopping Jim\xe2\x80\x99s face in the\r\nmush-plate. The more he had chattered, the more remote had Ruth seemed\r\nto him. How could he, herding with such cattle, ever become worthy of\r\nher? He was appalled at the problem confronting him, weighted down by\r\nthe incubus of his working-class station. Everything reached out to\r\nhold him down\xe2\x80\x94his sister, his sister\xe2\x80\x99s house and family, Jim the\r\napprentice, everybody he knew, every tie of life. Existence did not\r\ntaste good in his mouth. Up to then he had accepted existence, as he\r\nhad lived it with all about him, as a good thing. He had never\r\nquestioned it, except when he read books; but then, they were only\r\nbooks, fairy stories of a fairer and impossible world. But now he had\r\nseen that world, possible and real, with a flower of a woman called\r\nRuth in the midmost centre of it; and thenceforth he must know bitter\r\ntastes, and longings sharp as pain, and hopelessness that tantalized\r\nbecause it fed on hope.\r\n\r\nHe had debated between the Berkeley Free Library and the Oakland Free\r\nLibrary, and decided upon the latter because Ruth lived in Oakland. Who\r\ncould tell?\xe2\x80\x94a library was a most likely place for her, and he might see\r\nher there. He did not know the way of libraries, and he wandered\r\nthrough endless rows of fiction, till the delicate-featured\r\nFrench-looking girl who seemed in charge, told him that the reference\r\ndepartment was upstairs. He did not know enough to ask the man at the\r\ndesk, and began his adventures in the philosophy alcove. He had heard\r\nof book philosophy, but had not imagined there had been so much written\r\nabout it. The high, bulging shelves of heavy tomes humbled him and at\r\nthe same time stimulated him. Here was work for the vigor of his brain.\r\nHe found books on trigonometry in the mathematics section, and ran the\r\npages, and stared at the meaningless formulas and figures. He could\r\nread English, but he saw there an alien speech. Norman and Arthur knew\r\nthat speech. He had heard them talking it. And they were her brothers.\r\nHe left the alcove in despair. From every side the books seemed to\r\npress upon him and crush him.\r\n\r\nHe had never dreamed that the fund of human knowledge bulked so big. He\r\nwas frightened. How could his brain ever master it all? Later, he\r\nremembered that there were other men, many men, who had mastered it;\r\nand he breathed a great oath, passionately, under his breath, swearing\r\nthat his brain could do what theirs had done.\r\n\r\nAnd so he wandered on, alternating between depression and elation as he\r\nstared at the shelves packed with wisdom. In one miscellaneous section\r\nhe came upon a \xe2\x80\x9cNorrie\xe2\x80\x99s Epitome.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned the pages reverently. In a\r\nway, it spoke a kindred speech. Both he and it were of the sea. Then he\r\nfound a \xe2\x80\x9cBowditch\xe2\x80\x9d and books by Lecky and Marshall. There it was; he\r\nwould teach himself navigation. He would quit drinking, work up, and\r\nbecome a captain. Ruth seemed very near to him in that moment. As a\r\ncaptain, he could marry her (if she would have him). And if she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, well\xe2\x80\x94he would live a good life among men, because of Her, and\r\nhe would quit drinking anyway. Then he remembered the underwriters and\r\nthe owners, the two masters a captain must serve, either of which could\r\nand would break him and whose interests were diametrically opposed. He\r\ncast his eyes about the room and closed the lids down on a vision of\r\nten thousand books. No; no more of the sea for him. There was power in\r\nall that wealth of books, and if he would do great things, he must do\r\nthem on the land. Besides, captains were not allowed to take their\r\nwives to sea with them.\r\n\r\nNoon came, and afternoon. He forgot to eat, and sought on for the books\r\non etiquette; for, in addition to career, his mind was vexed by a\r\nsimple and very concrete problem: _When you meet a young lady and she\r\nasks you to call, how soon can you call_? was the way he worded it to\r\nhimself. But when he found the right shelf, he sought vainly for the\r\nanswer. He was appalled at the vast edifice of etiquette, and lost\r\nhimself in the mazes of visiting-card conduct between persons in polite\r\nsociety. He abandoned his search. He had not found what he wanted,\r\nthough he had found that it would take all of a man\xe2\x80\x99s time to be\r\npolite, and that he would have to live a preliminary life in which to\r\nlearn how to be polite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you find what you wanted?\xe2\x80\x9d the man at the desk asked him as he was\r\nleaving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a fine library here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should be glad to see you here often. Are you a\r\nsailor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, how did he know that? he asked himself as he went down the stairs.\r\n\r\nAnd for the first block along the street he walked very stiff and\r\nstraight and awkwardly, until he forgot himself in his thoughts,\r\nwhereupon his rolling gait gracefully returned to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA terrible restlessness that was akin to hunger afflicted Martin Eden.\r\nHe was famished for a sight of the girl whose slender hands had gripped\r\nhis life with a giant\xe2\x80\x99s grasp. He could not steel himself to call upon\r\nher. He was afraid that he might call too soon, and so be guilty of an\r\nawful breach of that awful thing called etiquette. He spent long hours\r\nin the Oakland and Berkeley libraries, and made out application blanks\r\nfor membership for himself, his sisters Gertrude and Marian, and Jim,\r\nthe latter\xe2\x80\x99s consent being obtained at the expense of several glasses\r\nof beer. With four cards permitting him to draw books, he burned the\r\ngas late in the servant\xe2\x80\x99s room, and was charged fifty cents a week for\r\nit by Mr. Higginbotham.\r\n\r\nThe many books he read but served to whet his unrest. Every page of\r\nevery book was a peep-hole into the realm of knowledge. His hunger fed\r\nupon what he read, and increased. Also, he did not know where to begin,\r\nand continually suffered from lack of preparation. The commonest\r\nreferences, that he could see plainly every reader was expected to\r\nknow, he did not know. And the same was true of the poetry he read\r\nwhich maddened him with delight. He read more of Swinburne than was\r\ncontained in the volume Ruth had lent him; and \xe2\x80\x9cDolores\xe2\x80\x9d he understood\r\nthoroughly. But surely Ruth did not understand it, he concluded. How\r\ncould she, living the refined life she did? Then he chanced upon\r\nKipling\xe2\x80\x99s poems, and was swept away by the lilt and swing and glamour\r\nwith which familiar things had been invested. He was amazed at the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy with life and at his incisive psychology. _Psychology_\r\nwas a new word in Martin\xe2\x80\x99s vocabulary. He had bought a dictionary,\r\nwhich deed had decreased his supply of money and brought nearer the day\r\non which he must sail in search of more. Also, it incensed Mr.\r\nHigginbotham, who would have preferred the money taking the form of\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nHe dared not go near Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood in the daytime, but night\r\nfound him lurking like a thief around the Morse home, stealing glimpses\r\nat the windows and loving the very walls that sheltered her. Several\r\ntimes he barely escaped being caught by her brothers, and once he\r\ntrailed Mr. Morse down town and studied his face in the lighted\r\nstreets, longing all the while for some quick danger of death to\r\nthreaten so that he might spring in and save her father. On another\r\nnight, his vigil was rewarded by a glimpse of Ruth through a\r\nsecond-story window. He saw only her head and shoulders, and her arms\r\nraised as she fixed her hair before a mirror. It was only for a moment,\r\nbut it was a long moment to him, during which his blood turned to wine\r\nand sang through his veins. Then she pulled down the shade. But it was\r\nher room\xe2\x80\x94he had learned that; and thereafter he strayed there often,\r\nhiding under a dark tree on the opposite side of the street and smoking\r\ncountless cigarettes. One afternoon he saw her mother coming out of a\r\nbank, and received another proof of the enormous distance that\r\nseparated Ruth from him. She was of the class that dealt with banks. He\r\nhad never been inside a bank in his life, and he had an idea that such\r\ninstitutions were frequented only by the very rich and the very\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\nIn one way, he had undergone a moral revolution. Her cleanness and\r\npurity had reacted upon him, and he felt in his being a crying need to\r\nbe clean. He must be that if he were ever to be worthy of breathing the\r\nsame air with her. He washed his teeth, and scrubbed his hands with a\r\nkitchen scrub-brush till he saw a nail-brush in a drug-store window and\r\ndivined its use. While purchasing it, the clerk glanced at his nails,\r\nsuggested a nail-file, and so he became possessed of an additional\r\ntoilet-tool. He ran across a book in the library on the care of the\r\nbody, and promptly developed a penchant for a cold-water bath every\r\nmorning, much to the amazement of Jim, and to the bewilderment of Mr.\r\nHigginbotham, who was not in sympathy with such high-fangled notions\r\nand who seriously debated whether or not he should charge Martin extra\r\nfor the water. Another stride was in the direction of creased trousers.\r\nNow that Martin was aroused in such matters, he swiftly noted the\r\ndifference between the baggy knees of the trousers worn by the working\r\nclass and the straight line from knee to foot of those worn by the men\r\nabove the working class. Also, he learned the reason why, and invaded\r\nhis sister\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen in search of irons and ironing-board. He had\r\nmisadventures at first, hopelessly burning one pair and buying another,\r\nwhich expenditure again brought nearer the day on which he must put to\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nBut the reform went deeper than mere outward appearance. He still\r\nsmoked, but he drank no more. Up to that time, drinking had seemed to\r\nhim the proper thing for men to do, and he had prided himself on his\r\nstrong head which enabled him to drink most men under the table.\r\nWhenever he encountered a chance shipmate, and there were many in San\r\nFrancisco, he treated them and was treated in turn, as of old, but he\r\nordered for himself root beer or ginger ale and good-naturedly endured\r\ntheir chaffing. And as they waxed maudlin he studied them, watching the\r\nbeast rise and master them and thanking God that he was no longer as\r\nthey. They had their limitations to forget, and when they were drunk,\r\ntheir dim, stupid spirits were even as gods, and each ruled in his\r\nheaven of intoxicated desire. With Martin the need for strong drink had\r\nvanished. He was drunken in new and more profound ways\xe2\x80\x94with Ruth, who\r\nhad fired him with love and with a glimpse of higher and eternal life;\r\nwith books, that had set a myriad maggots of desire gnawing in his\r\nbrain; and with the sense of personal cleanliness he was achieving,\r\nthat gave him even more superb health than what he had enjoyed and that\r\nmade his whole body sing with physical well-being.\r\n\r\nOne night he went to the theatre, on the blind chance that he might see\r\nher there, and from the second balcony he did see her. He saw her come\r\ndown the aisle, with Arthur and a strange young man with a football mop\r\nof hair and eyeglasses, the sight of whom spurred him to instant\r\napprehension and jealousy. He saw her take her seat in the orchestra\r\ncircle, and little else than her did he see that night\xe2\x80\x94a pair of\r\nslender white shoulders and a mass of pale gold hair, dim with\r\ndistance. But there were others who saw, and now and again, glancing at\r\nthose about him, he noted two young girls who looked back from the row\r\nin front, a dozen seats along, and who smiled at him with bold eyes. He\r\nhad always been easy-going. It was not in his nature to give rebuff. In\r\nthe old days he would have smiled back, and gone further and encouraged\r\nsmiling. But now it was different. He did smile back, then looked away,\r\nand looked no more deliberately. But several times, forgetting the\r\nexistence of the two girls, his eyes caught their smiles. He could not\r\nre-thumb himself in a day, nor could he violate the intrinsic\r\nkindliness of his nature; so, at such moments, he smiled at the girls\r\nin warm human friendliness. It was nothing new to him. He knew they\r\nwere reaching out their woman\xe2\x80\x99s hands to him. But it was different now.\r\nFar down there in the orchestra circle was the one woman in all the\r\nworld, so different, so terrifically different, from these two girls of\r\nhis class, that he could feel for them only pity and sorrow. He had it\r\nin his heart to wish that they could possess, in some small measure,\r\nher goodness and glory. And not for the world could he hurt them\r\nbecause of their outreaching. He was not flattered by it; he even felt\r\na slight shame at his lowliness that permitted it. He knew, did he\r\nbelong in Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s class, that there would be no overtures from these\r\ngirls; and with each glance of theirs he felt the fingers of his own\r\nclass clutching at him to hold him down.\r\n\r\nHe left his seat before the curtain went down on the last act, intent\r\non seeing Her as she passed out. There were always numbers of men who\r\nstood on the sidewalk outside, and he could pull his cap down over his\r\neyes and screen himself behind some one\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder so that she should\r\nnot see him. He emerged from the theatre with the first of the crowd;\r\nbut scarcely had he taken his position on the edge of the sidewalk when\r\nthe two girls appeared. They were looking for him, he knew; and for the\r\nmoment he could have cursed that in him which drew women. Their casual\r\nedging across the sidewalk to the curb, as they drew near, apprised him\r\nof discovery. They slowed down, and were in the thick of the crowd as\r\nthey came up with him. One of them brushed against him and apparently\r\nfor the first time noticed him. She was a slender, dark girl, with\r\nblack, defiant eyes. But they smiled at him, and he smiled back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nIt was automatic; he had said it so often before under similar\r\ncircumstances of first meetings. Besides, he could do no less. There\r\nwas that large tolerance and sympathy in his nature that would permit\r\nhim to do no less. The black-eyed girl smiled gratification and\r\ngreeting, and showed signs of stopping, while her companion, arm linked\r\nin arm, giggled and likewise showed signs of halting. He thought\r\nquickly. It would never do for Her to come out and see him talking\r\nthere with them. Quite naturally, as a matter of course, he swung in\r\nalong-side the dark-eyed one and walked with her. There was no\r\nawkwardness on his part, no numb tongue. He was at home here, and he\r\nheld his own royally in the badinage, bristling with slang and\r\nsharpness, that was always the preliminary to getting acquainted in\r\nthese swift-moving affairs. At the corner where the main stream of\r\npeople flowed onward, he started to edge out into the cross street. But\r\nthe girl with the black eyes caught his arm, following him and dragging\r\nher companion after her, as she cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on, Bill! What\xe2\x80\x99s yer rush? You\xe2\x80\x99re not goin\xe2\x80\x99 to shake us so sudden\r\nas all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe halted with a laugh, and turned, facing them. Across their shoulders\r\nhe could see the moving throng passing under the street lamps. Where he\r\nstood it was not so light, and, unseen, he would be able to see Her as\r\nshe passed by. She would certainly pass by, for that way led home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s her name?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of the giggling girl, nodding at the\r\ndark-eyed one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask her,\xe2\x80\x9d was the convulsed response.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, turning squarely on the girl in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t told me yours, yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never asked it,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, you guessed the first\r\nrattle. It\xe2\x80\x99s Bill, all right, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAw, go \xe2\x80\x99long with you.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked him in the eyes, her own sharply\r\npassionate and inviting. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, honest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she looked. All the centuries of woman since sex began were\r\neloquent in her eyes. And he measured her in a careless way, and knew,\r\nbold now, that she would begin to retreat, coyly and delicately, as he\r\npursued, ever ready to reverse the game should he turn fainthearted.\r\nAnd, too, he was human, and could feel the draw of her, while his ego\r\ncould not but appreciate the flattery of her kindness. Oh, he knew it\r\nall, and knew them well, from A to Z. Good, as goodness might be\r\nmeasured in their particular class, hard-working for meagre wages and\r\nscorning the sale of self for easier ways, nervously desirous for some\r\nsmall pinch of happiness in the desert of existence, and facing a\r\nfuture that was a gamble between the ugliness of unending toil and the\r\nblack pit of more terrible wretchedness, the way whereto being briefer\r\nthough better paid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, nodding his head. \xe2\x80\x9cSure, Pete, Bill an\xe2\x80\x99 no other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo joshin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d she queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t Bill at all,\xe2\x80\x9d the other broke in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never laid eyes on me before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo need to, to know you\xe2\x80\x99re lyin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d was the retort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStraight, Bill, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d the first girl asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBill\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d he confessed.\r\n\r\nShe reached out to his arm and shook him playfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you was\r\nlyin\xe2\x80\x99, but you look good to me just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe captured the hand that invited, and felt on the palm familiar\r\nmarkings and distortions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen\xe2\x80\x99d you chuck the cannery?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99d yeh know?\xe2\x80\x9d and, \xe2\x80\x9cMy, ain\xe2\x80\x99t cheh a mind-reader!\xe2\x80\x9d the girls\r\nchorussed.\r\n\r\nAnd while he exchanged the stupidities of stupid minds with them,\r\nbefore his inner sight towered the book-shelves of the library, filled\r\nwith the wisdom of the ages. He smiled bitterly at the incongruity of\r\nit, and was assailed by doubts. But between inner vision and outward\r\npleasantry he found time to watch the theatre crowd streaming by. And\r\nthen he saw Her, under the lights, between her brother and the strange\r\nyoung man with glasses, and his heart seemed to stand still. He had\r\nwaited long for this moment. He had time to note the light, fluffy\r\nsomething that hid her queenly head, the tasteful lines of her wrapped\r\nfigure, the gracefulness of her carriage and of the hand that caught up\r\nher skirts; and then she was gone and he was left staring at the two\r\ngirls of the cannery, at their tawdry attempts at prettiness of dress,\r\ntheir tragic efforts to be clean and trim, the cheap cloth, the cheap\r\nribbons, and the cheap rings on the fingers. He felt a tug at his arm,\r\nand heard a voice saying:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWake up, Bill! What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was you sayin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d the dark girl answered, with a toss of her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nonly remarkin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I was whisperin\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99d be a good idea if you could dig up a\r\ngentleman friend\xe2\x80\x94for her\xe2\x80\x9d (indicating her companion), \xe2\x80\x9cand then, we\r\ncould go off an\xe2\x80\x99 have ice-cream soda somewhere, or coffee, or\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was afflicted by a sudden spiritual nausea. The transition from Ruth\r\nto this had been too abrupt. Ranged side by side with the bold, defiant\r\neyes of the girl before him, he saw Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s clear, luminous eyes, like a\r\nsaint\xe2\x80\x99s, gazing at him out of unplumbed depths of purity. And, somehow,\r\nhe felt within him a stir of power. He was better than this. Life meant\r\nmore to him than it meant to these two girls whose thoughts did not go\r\nbeyond ice-cream and a gentleman friend. He remembered that he had led\r\nalways a secret life in his thoughts. These thoughts he had tried to\r\nshare, but never had he found a woman capable of understanding\xe2\x80\x94nor a\r\nman. He had tried, at times, but had only puzzled his listeners. And as\r\nhis thoughts had been beyond them, so, he argued now, he must be beyond\r\nthem. He felt power move in him, and clenched his fists. If life meant\r\nmore to him, then it was for him to demand more from life, but he could\r\nnot demand it from such companionship as this. Those bold black eyes\r\nhad nothing to offer. He knew the thoughts behind them\xe2\x80\x94of ice-cream and\r\nof something else. But those saint\xe2\x80\x99s eyes alongside\xe2\x80\x94they offered all he\r\nknew and more than he could guess. They offered books and painting,\r\nbeauty and repose, and all the fine elegance of higher existence.\r\nBehind those black eyes he knew every thought process. It was like\r\nclockwork. He could watch every wheel go around. Their bid was low\r\npleasure, narrow as the grave, that palled, and the grave was at the\r\nend of it. But the bid of the saint\xe2\x80\x99s eyes was mystery, and wonder\r\nunthinkable, and eternal life. He had caught glimpses of the soul in\r\nthem, and glimpses of his own soul, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing wrong with the programme,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a date already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes blazed her disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo sit up with a sick friend, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d she sneered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, a real, honest date with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he faltered, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not stringin\xe2\x80\x99 me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked earnestly.\r\n\r\nHe looked her in the eyes and answered: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s straight, all right. But\r\nwhy can\xe2\x80\x99t we meet some other time? You ain\xe2\x80\x99t told me your name yet. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhere d\xe2\x80\x99ye live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLizzie,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, softening toward him, her hand pressing his arm,\r\nwhile her body leaned against his. \xe2\x80\x9cLizzie Connolly. And I live at\r\nFifth an\xe2\x80\x99 Market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe talked on a few minutes before saying good night. He did not go home\r\nimmediately; and under the tree where he kept his vigils he looked up\r\nat a window and murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cThat date was with you, Ruth. I kept it for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA week of heavy reading had passed since the evening he first met Ruth\r\nMorse, and still he dared not call. Time and again he nerved himself up\r\nto call, but under the doubts that assailed him his determination died\r\naway. He did not know the proper time to call, nor was there any one to\r\ntell him, and he was afraid of committing himself to an irretrievable\r\nblunder. Having shaken himself free from his old companions and old\r\nways of life, and having no new companions, nothing remained for him\r\nbut to read, and the long hours he devoted to it would have ruined a\r\ndozen pairs of ordinary eyes. But his eyes were strong, and they were\r\nbacked by a body superbly strong. Furthermore, his mind was fallow. It\r\nhad lain fallow all his life so far as the abstract thought of the\r\nbooks was concerned, and it was ripe for the sowing. It had never been\r\njaded by study, and it bit hold of the knowledge in the books with\r\nsharp teeth that would not let go.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him, by the end of the week, that he had lived centuries,\r\nso far behind were the old life and outlook. But he was baffled by lack\r\nof preparation. He attempted to read books that required years of\r\npreliminary specialization. One day he would read a book of antiquated\r\nphilosophy, and the next day one that was ultra-modern, so that his\r\nhead would be whirling with the conflict and contradiction of ideas. It\r\nwas the same with the economists. On the one shelf at the library he\r\nfound Karl Marx, Ricardo, Adam Smith, and Mill, and the abstruse\r\nformulas of the one gave no clew that the ideas of another were\r\nobsolete. He was bewildered, and yet he wanted to know. He had become\r\ninterested, in a day, in economics, industry, and politics. Passing\r\nthrough the City Hall Park, he had noticed a group of men, in the\r\ncentre of which were half a dozen, with flushed faces and raised\r\nvoices, earnestly carrying on a discussion. He joined the listeners,\r\nand heard a new, alien tongue in the mouths of the philosophers of the\r\npeople. One was a tramp, another was a labor agitator, a third was a\r\nlaw-school student, and the remainder was composed of wordy workingmen.\r\nFor the first time he heard of socialism, anarchism, and single tax,\r\nand learned that there were warring social philosophies. He heard\r\nhundreds of technical words that were new to him, belonging to fields\r\nof thought that his meagre reading had never touched upon. Because of\r\nthis he could not follow the arguments closely, and he could only guess\r\nat and surmise the ideas wrapped up in such strange expressions. Then\r\nthere was a black-eyed restaurant waiter who was a theosophist, a union\r\nbaker who was an agnostic, an old man who baffled all of them with the\r\nstrange philosophy that _what is is right_, and another old man who\r\ndiscoursed interminably about the cosmos and the father-atom and the\r\nmother-atom.\r\n\r\nMartin Eden\xe2\x80\x99s head was in a state of addlement when he went away after\r\nseveral hours, and he hurried to the library to look up the definitions\r\nof a dozen unusual words. And when he left the library, he carried\r\nunder his arm four volumes: Madam Blavatsky\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSecret Doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProgress and Poverty,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Quintessence of Socialism,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWarfare\r\nof Religion and Science.\xe2\x80\x9d Unfortunately, he began on the \xe2\x80\x9cSecret\r\nDoctrine.\xe2\x80\x9d Every line bristled with many-syllabled words he did not\r\nunderstand. He sat up in bed, and the dictionary was in front of him\r\nmore often than the book. He looked up so many new words that when they\r\nrecurred, he had forgotten their meaning and had to look them up again.\r\nHe devised the plan of writing the definitions in a note-book, and\r\nfilled page after page with them. And still he could not understand. He\r\nread until three in the morning, and his brain was in a turmoil, but\r\nnot one essential thought in the text had he grasped. He looked up, and\r\nit seemed that the room was lifting, heeling, and plunging like a ship\r\nupon the sea. Then he hurled the \xe2\x80\x9cSecret Doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d and many curses\r\nacross the room, turned off the gas, and composed himself to sleep. Nor\r\ndid he have much better luck with the other three books. It was not\r\nthat his brain was weak or incapable; it could think these thoughts\r\nwere it not for lack of training in thinking and lack of the\r\nthought-tools with which to think. He guessed this, and for a while\r\nentertained the idea of reading nothing but the dictionary until he had\r\nmastered every word in it.\r\n\r\nPoetry, however, was his solace, and he read much of it, finding his\r\ngreatest joy in the simpler poets, who were more understandable. He\r\nloved beauty, and there he found beauty. Poetry, like music, stirred\r\nhim profoundly, and, though he did not know it, he was preparing his\r\nmind for the heavier work that was to come. The pages of his mind were\r\nblank, and, without effort, much he read and liked, stanza by stanza,\r\nwas impressed upon those pages, so that he was soon able to extract\r\ngreat joy from chanting aloud or under his breath the music and the\r\nbeauty of the printed words he had read. Then he stumbled upon Gayley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClassic Myths\xe2\x80\x9d and Bulfinch\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAge of Fable,\xe2\x80\x9d side by side on a\r\nlibrary shelf. It was illumination, a great light in the darkness of\r\nhis ignorance, and he read poetry more avidly than ever.\r\n\r\nThe man at the desk in the library had seen Martin there so often that\r\nhe had become quite cordial, always greeting him with a smile and a nod\r\nwhen he entered. It was because of this that Martin did a daring thing.\r\nDrawing out some books at the desk, and while the man was stamping the\r\ncards, Martin blurted out:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, there\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man smiled and paid attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you meet a young lady an\xe2\x80\x99 she asks you to call, how soon can you\r\ncall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin felt his shirt press and cling to his shoulders, what of the\r\nsweat of the effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I\xe2\x80\x99d say any time,\xe2\x80\x9d the man answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but this is different,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin objected. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94well, you see,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s this way: maybe she won\xe2\x80\x99t be there. She goes to the university.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen call again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I said ain\xe2\x80\x99t what I meant,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin confessed falteringly, while\r\nhe made up his mind to throw himself wholly upon the other\xe2\x80\x99s mercy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just a rough sort of a fellow, an\xe2\x80\x99 I ain\xe2\x80\x99t never seen anything of\r\nsociety. This girl is all that I ain\xe2\x80\x99t, an\xe2\x80\x99 I ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything that she\r\nis. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m playin\xe2\x80\x99 the fool, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; not at all, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d the other protested. \xe2\x80\x9cYour request\r\nis not exactly in the scope of the reference department, but I shall be\r\nonly too pleased to assist you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin looked at him admiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could tear it off that way, I\xe2\x80\x99d be all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean if I could talk easy that way, an\xe2\x80\x99 polite, an\xe2\x80\x99 all the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, with comprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the best time to call? The afternoon?\xe2\x80\x94not too close to\r\nmeal-time? Or the evening? Or Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d the librarian said with a brightening face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou call\r\nher up on the telephone and find out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, picking up his books and starting away.\r\n\r\nHe turned back and asked:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re speakin\xe2\x80\x99 to a young lady\xe2\x80\x94say, for instance, Miss Lizzie\r\nSmith\xe2\x80\x94do you say \xe2\x80\x98Miss Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99? or \xe2\x80\x98Miss Smith\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay \xe2\x80\x98Miss Smith,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d the librarian stated authoritatively. \xe2\x80\x9cSay \xe2\x80\x98Miss\r\nSmith\xe2\x80\x99 always\xe2\x80\x94until you come to know her better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo it was that Martin Eden solved the problem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down any time; I\xe2\x80\x99ll be at home all afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d was Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s reply\r\nover the telephone to his stammered request as to when he could return\r\nthe borrowed books.\r\n\r\nShe met him at the door herself, and her woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes took in\r\nimmediately the creased trousers and the certain slight but indefinable\r\nchange in him for the better. Also, she was struck by his face. It was\r\nalmost violent, this health of his, and it seemed to rush out of him\r\nand at her in waves of force. She felt the urge again of the desire to\r\nlean toward him for warmth, and marvelled again at the effect his\r\npresence produced upon her. And he, in turn, knew again the swimming\r\nsensation of bliss when he felt the contact of her hand in greeting.\r\nThe difference between them lay in that she was cool and self-possessed\r\nwhile his face flushed to the roots of the hair. He stumbled with his\r\nold awkwardness after her, and his shoulders swung and lurched\r\nperilously.\r\n\r\nOnce they were seated in the living-room, he began to get on\r\neasily\xe2\x80\x94more easily by far than he had expected. She made it easy for\r\nhim; and the gracious spirit with which she did it made him love her\r\nmore madly than ever. They talked first of the borrowed books, of the\r\nSwinburne he was devoted to, and of the Browning he did not understand;\r\nand she led the conversation on from subject to subject, while she\r\npondered the problem of how she could be of help to him. She had\r\nthought of this often since their first meeting. She wanted to help\r\nhim. He made a call upon her pity and tenderness that no one had ever\r\nmade before, and the pity was not so much derogatory of him as maternal\r\nin her. Her pity could not be of the common sort, when the man who drew\r\nit was so much man as to shock her with maidenly fears and set her mind\r\nand pulse thrilling with strange thoughts and feelings. The old\r\nfascination of his neck was there, and there was sweetness in the\r\nthought of laying her hands upon it. It seemed still a wanton impulse,\r\nbut she had grown more used to it. She did not dream that in such guise\r\nnew-born love would epitomize itself. Nor did she dream that the\r\nfeeling he excited in her was love. She thought she was merely\r\ninterested in him as an unusual type possessing various potential\r\nexcellencies, and she even felt philanthropic about it.\r\n\r\nShe did not know she desired him; but with him it was different. He\r\nknew that he loved her, and he desired her as he had never before\r\ndesired anything in his life. He had loved poetry for beauty\xe2\x80\x99s sake;\r\nbut since he met her the gates to the vast field of love-poetry had\r\nbeen opened wide. She had given him understanding even more than\r\nBulfinch and Gayley. There was a line that a week before he would not\r\nhave favored with a second thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s own mad lover dying on a\r\nkiss\xe2\x80\x9d; but now it was ever insistent in his mind. He marvelled at the\r\nwonder of it and the truth; and as he gazed upon her he knew that he\r\ncould die gladly upon a kiss. He felt himself God\xe2\x80\x99s own mad lover, and\r\nno accolade of knighthood could have given him greater pride. And at\r\nlast he knew the meaning of life and why he had been born.\r\n\r\nAs he gazed at her and listened, his thoughts grew daring. He reviewed\r\nall the wild delight of the pressure of her hand in his at the door,\r\nand longed for it again. His gaze wandered often toward her lips, and\r\nhe yearned for them hungrily. But there was nothing gross or earthly\r\nabout this yearning. It gave him exquisite delight to watch every\r\nmovement and play of those lips as they enunciated the words she spoke;\r\nyet they were not ordinary lips such as all men and women had. Their\r\nsubstance was not mere human clay. They were lips of pure spirit, and\r\nhis desire for them seemed absolutely different from the desire that\r\nhad led him to other women\xe2\x80\x99s lips. He could kiss her lips, rest his own\r\nphysical lips upon them, but it would be with the lofty and awful\r\nfervor with which one would kiss the robe of God. He was not conscious\r\nof this transvaluation of values that had taken place in him, and was\r\nunaware that the light that shone in his eyes when he looked at her was\r\nquite the same light that shines in all men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes when the desire of\r\nlove is upon them. He did not dream how ardent and masculine his gaze\r\nwas, nor that the warm flame of it was affecting the alchemy of her\r\nspirit. Her penetrative virginity exalted and disguised his own\r\nemotions, elevating his thoughts to a star-cool chastity, and he would\r\nhave been startled to learn that there was that shining out of his\r\neyes, like warm waves, that flowed through her and kindled a kindred\r\nwarmth. She was subtly perturbed by it, and more than once, though she\r\nknew not why, it disrupted her train of thought with its delicious\r\nintrusion and compelled her to grope for the remainder of ideas partly\r\nuttered. Speech was always easy with her, and these interruptions would\r\nhave puzzled her had she not decided that it was because he was a\r\nremarkable type. She was very sensitive to impressions, and it was not\r\nstrange, after all, that this aura of a traveller from another world\r\nshould so affect her.\r\n\r\nThe problem in the background of her consciousness was how to help him,\r\nand she turned the conversation in that direction; but it was Martin\r\nwho came to the point first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if I can get some advice from you,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, and received an\r\nacquiescence of willingness that made his heart bound. \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember\r\nthe other time I was here I said I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about books an\xe2\x80\x99 things\r\nbecause I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve ben doin\xe2\x80\x99 a lot of thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 ever\r\nsince. I\xe2\x80\x99ve ben to the library a whole lot, but most of the books I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntackled have ben over my head. Mebbe I\xe2\x80\x99d better begin at the beginnin\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nI ain\xe2\x80\x99t never had no advantages. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked pretty hard ever since I\r\nwas a kid, an\xe2\x80\x99 since I\xe2\x80\x99ve ben to the library, lookin\xe2\x80\x99 with new eyes at\r\nbooks\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 lookin\xe2\x80\x99 at new books, too\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve just about concluded that I\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t ben reading the right kind. You know the books you find in\r\ncattle-camps an\xe2\x80\x99 fo\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99ls ain\xe2\x80\x99t the same you\xe2\x80\x99ve got in this house, for\r\ninstance. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of readin\xe2\x80\x99 matter I\xe2\x80\x99ve ben accustomed\r\nto. And yet\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 I ain\xe2\x80\x99t just makin\xe2\x80\x99 a brag of it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve ben different\r\nfrom the people I\xe2\x80\x99ve herded with. Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m any better than the\r\nsailors an\xe2\x80\x99 cow-punchers I travelled with,\xe2\x80\x94I was cow-punchin\xe2\x80\x99 for a\r\nshort time, you know,\xe2\x80\x94but I always liked books, read everything I could\r\nlay hands on, an\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94well, I guess I think differently from most of \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, to come to what I\xe2\x80\x99m drivin\xe2\x80\x99 at. I was never inside a house like\r\nthis. When I come a week ago, an\xe2\x80\x99 saw all this, an\xe2\x80\x99 you, an\xe2\x80\x99 your\r\nmother, an\xe2\x80\x99 brothers, an\xe2\x80\x99 everything\xe2\x80\x94well, I liked it. I\xe2\x80\x99d heard about\r\nsuch things an\xe2\x80\x99 read about such things in some of the books, an\xe2\x80\x99 when I\r\nlooked around at your house, why, the books come true. But the thing\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m after is I liked it. I wanted it. I want it now. I want to breathe\r\nair like you get in this house\xe2\x80\x94air that is filled with books, and\r\npictures, and beautiful things, where people talk in low voices an\xe2\x80\x99 are\r\nclean, an\xe2\x80\x99 their thoughts are clean. The air I always breathed was\r\nmixed up with grub an\xe2\x80\x99 house-rent an\xe2\x80\x99 scrappin\xe2\x80\x99 an booze an\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nthey talked about, too. Why, when you was crossin\xe2\x80\x99 the room to kiss\r\nyour mother, I thought it was the most beautiful thing I ever seen.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a whole lot of life, an\xe2\x80\x99 somehow I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a whole lot more\r\nof it than most of them that was with me. I like to see, an\xe2\x80\x99 I want to\r\nsee more, an\xe2\x80\x99 I want to see it different.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got to the point yet. Here it is. I want to make my way to\r\nthe kind of life you have in this house. There\xe2\x80\x99s more in life than\r\nbooze, an\xe2\x80\x99 hard work, an\xe2\x80\x99 knockin\xe2\x80\x99 about. Now, how am I goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get\r\nit? Where do I take hold an\xe2\x80\x99 begin? I\xe2\x80\x99m willin\xe2\x80\x99 to work my passage, you\r\nknow, an\xe2\x80\x99 I can make most men sick when it comes to hard work. Once I\r\nget started, I\xe2\x80\x99ll work night an\xe2\x80\x99 day. Mebbe you think it\xe2\x80\x99s funny, me\r\naskin\xe2\x80\x99 you about all this. I know you\xe2\x80\x99re the last person in the world I\r\nought to ask, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anybody else I could ask\xe2\x80\x94unless it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nArthur. Mebbe I ought to ask him. If I was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice died away. His firmly planned intention had come to a halt on\r\nthe verge of the horrible probability that he should have asked Arthur\r\nand that he had made a fool of himself. Ruth did not speak immediately.\r\nShe was too absorbed in striving to reconcile the stumbling, uncouth\r\nspeech and its simplicity of thought with what she saw in his face. She\r\nhad never looked in eyes that expressed greater power. Here was a man\r\nwho could do anything, was the message she read there, and it accorded\r\nill with the weakness of his spoken thought. And for that matter so\r\ncomplex and quick was her own mind that she did not have a just\r\nappreciation of simplicity. And yet she had caught an impression of\r\npower in the very groping of this mind. It had seemed to her like a\r\ngiant writhing and straining at the bonds that held him down. Her face\r\nwas all sympathy when she did speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you need, you realize yourself, and it is education. You should\r\ngo back and finish grammar school, and then go through to high school\r\nand university.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that takes money,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI had not thought of that. But then you have\r\nrelatives, somebody who could assist you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father and mother are dead. I\xe2\x80\x99ve two sisters, one married, an\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99ll get married soon, I suppose. Then I\xe2\x80\x99ve a string of\r\nbrothers,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m the youngest,\xe2\x80\x94but they never helped nobody. They\xe2\x80\x99ve just\r\nknocked around over the world, lookin\xe2\x80\x99 out for number one. The oldest\r\ndied in India. Two are in South Africa now, an\xe2\x80\x99 another\xe2\x80\x99s on a whaling\r\nvoyage, an\xe2\x80\x99 one\xe2\x80\x99s travellin\xe2\x80\x99 with a circus\xe2\x80\x94he does trapeze work. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nguess I\xe2\x80\x99m just like them. I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken care of myself since I was\r\neleven\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s when my mother died. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to study by myself, I\r\nguess, an\xe2\x80\x99 what I want to know is where to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say the first thing of all would be to get a grammar. Your\r\ngrammar is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She had intended saying \xe2\x80\x9cawful,\xe2\x80\x9d but she amended it to \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nnot particularly good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flushed and sweated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I must talk a lot of slang an\xe2\x80\x99 words you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. But\r\nthen they\xe2\x80\x99re the only words I know\xe2\x80\x94how to speak. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got other words\r\nin my mind, picked \xe2\x80\x99em up from books, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t pronounce \xe2\x80\x99em, so I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t use \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t what you say, so much as how you say it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my\r\nbeing frank, do you? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, while he secretly blessed her for her kindness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire away. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to know, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner know from you than anybody\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you say, \xe2\x80\x98You was\xe2\x80\x99; it should be, \xe2\x80\x98You were.\xe2\x80\x99 You say \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nseen\xe2\x80\x99 for \xe2\x80\x98I saw.\xe2\x80\x99 You use the double negative\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the double negative?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded; then added humbly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t even understand your explanations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I didn\xe2\x80\x99t explain that,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cA double negative\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94let me see\xe2\x80\x94well, you say, \xe2\x80\x98never helped nobody.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Never\xe2\x80\x99 is a\r\nnegative. \xe2\x80\x98Nobody\xe2\x80\x99 is another negative. It is a rule that two negatives\r\nmake a positive. \xe2\x80\x98Never helped nobody\xe2\x80\x99 means that, not helping nobody,\r\nthey must have helped somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of it before. But it\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean they _must_ have helped somebody, does it? Seems to me that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98never helped nobody\xe2\x80\x99 just naturally fails to say whether or not they\r\nhelped somebody. I never thought of it before, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll never say it\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was pleased and surprised with the quickness and surety of his\r\nmind. As soon as he had got the clew he not only understood but\r\ncorrected her error.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find it all in the grammar,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nelse I noticed in your speech. You say \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99 when you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99 is a contraction and stands for two words. Do you know them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment, then answered, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do not.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you use \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99 when you mean \xe2\x80\x98does\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was puzzled over this, and did not get it so quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me an illustration,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She puckered her brows and pursed up her mouth as she thought,\r\nwhile he looked on and decided that her expression was most adorable.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It don\xe2\x80\x99t do to be hasty.\xe2\x80\x99 Change \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98do not,\xe2\x80\x99 and it reads,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It do not do to be hasty,\xe2\x80\x99 which is perfectly absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned it over in his mind and considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it jar on your ear?\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t say that it does,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied judicially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say, \xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t say that it do\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d she queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for the other I can\xe2\x80\x99t make up\r\nmy mind.

What you need is the\r\ngrammar. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get one and show you how to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she arose, there shot through his mind something that he had read in\r\nthe etiquette books, and he stood up awkwardly, worrying as to whether\r\nhe was doing the right thing, and fearing that she might take it as a\r\nsign that he was about to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, Mr. Eden,\xe2\x80\x9d she called back, as she was leaving the room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is _booze_? You used it several times, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, booze,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s slang. It means whiskey an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbeer\xe2\x80\x94anything that will make you drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd another thing,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed back. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t use \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99 when you are\r\nimpersonal. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99 is very personal, and your use of it just now was not\r\nprecisely what you meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t just see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you said just now, to me, \xe2\x80\x98whiskey and beer\xe2\x80\x94anything that will\r\nmake you drunk\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94make me drunk, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it would, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it would be nicer not to bring me\r\ninto it. Substitute \xe2\x80\x98one\xe2\x80\x99 for \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99 and see how much better it sounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she returned with the grammar, she drew a chair near his\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwondered if he should have helped her with the chair\xe2\x80\x94and sat down\r\nbeside him. She turned the pages of the grammar, and their heads were\r\ninclined toward each other. He could hardly follow her outlining of the\r\nwork he must do, so amazed was he by her delightful propinquity. But\r\nwhen she began to lay down the importance of conjugation, he forgot all\r\nabout her. He had never heard of conjugation, and was fascinated by the\r\nglimpse he was catching into the tie-ribs of language. He leaned closer\r\nto the page, and her hair touched his cheek. He had fainted but once in\r\nhis life, and he thought he was going to faint again. He could scarcely\r\nbreathe, and his heart was pounding the blood up into his throat and\r\nsuffocating him. Never had she seemed so accessible as now. For the\r\nmoment the great gulf that separated them was bridged. But there was no\r\ndiminution in the loftiness of his feeling for her. She had not\r\ndescended to him. It was he who had been caught up into the clouds and\r\ncarried to her. His reverence for her, in that moment, was of the same\r\norder as religious awe and fervor. It seemed to him that he had\r\nintruded upon the holy of holies, and slowly and carefully he moved his\r\nhead aside from the contact which thrilled him like an electric shock\r\nand of which she had not been aware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks went by, during which Martin Eden studied his grammar,\r\nreviewed the books on etiquette, and read voraciously the books that\r\ncaught his fancy. Of his own class he saw nothing. The girls of the\r\nLotus Club wondered what had become of him and worried Jim with\r\nquestions, and some of the fellows who put on the glove at Riley\xe2\x80\x99s were\r\nglad that Martin came no more. He made another discovery of\r\ntreasure-trove in the library. As the grammar had shown him the\r\ntie-ribs of language, so that book showed him the tie-ribs of poetry,\r\nand he began to learn metre and construction and form, beneath the\r\nbeauty he loved finding the why and wherefore of that beauty. Another\r\nmodern book he found treated poetry as a representative art, treated it\r\nexhaustively, with copious illustrations from the best in literature.\r\nNever had he read fiction with so keen zest as he studied these books.\r\nAnd his fresh mind, untaxed for twenty years and impelled by maturity\r\nof desire, gripped hold of what he read with a virility unusual to the\r\nstudent mind.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked back now from his vantage-ground, the old world he had\r\nknown, the world of land and sea and ships, of sailor-men and\r\nharpy-women, seemed a very small world; and yet it blended in with this\r\nnew world and expanded. His mind made for unity, and he was surprised\r\nwhen at first he began to see points of contact between the two worlds.\r\nAnd he was ennobled, as well, by the loftiness of thought and beauty he\r\nfound in the books. This led him to believe more firmly than ever that\r\nup above him, in society like Ruth and her family, all men and women\r\nthought these thoughts and lived them. Down below where he lived was\r\nthe ignoble, and he wanted to purge himself of the ignoble that had\r\nsoiled all his days, and to rise to that sublimated realm where dwelt\r\nthe upper classes. All his childhood and youth had been troubled by a\r\nvague unrest; he had never known what he wanted, but he had wanted\r\nsomething that he had hunted vainly for until he met Ruth. And now his\r\nunrest had become sharp and painful, and he knew at last, clearly and\r\ndefinitely, that it was beauty, and intellect, and love that he must\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nDuring those several weeks he saw Ruth half a dozen times, and each\r\ntime was an added inspiration. She helped him with his English,\r\ncorrected his pronunciation, and started him on arithmetic. But their\r\nintercourse was not all devoted to elementary study. He had seen too\r\nmuch of life, and his mind was too matured, to be wholly content with\r\nfractions, cube root, parsing, and analysis; and there were times when\r\ntheir conversation turned on other themes\xe2\x80\x94the last poetry he had read,\r\nthe latest poet she had studied. And when she read aloud to him her\r\nfavorite passages, he ascended to the topmost heaven of delight. Never,\r\nin all the women he had heard speak, had he heard a voice like hers.\r\nThe least sound of it was a stimulus to his love, and he thrilled and\r\nthrobbed with every word she uttered. It was the quality of it, the\r\nrepose, and the musical modulation\xe2\x80\x94the soft, rich, indefinable product\r\nof culture and a gentle soul. As he listened to her, there rang in the\r\nears of his memory the harsh cries of barbarian women and of hags, and,\r\nin lesser degrees of harshness, the strident voices of working women\r\nand of the girls of his own class. Then the chemistry of vision would\r\nbegin to work, and they would troop in review across his mind, each, by\r\ncontrast, multiplying Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s glories. Then, too, his bliss was\r\nheightened by the knowledge that her mind was comprehending what she\r\nread and was quivering with appreciation of the beauty of the written\r\nthought. She read to him much from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Princess,\xe2\x80\x9d and often he saw her\r\neyes swimming with tears, so finely was her aesthetic nature strung. At\r\nsuch moments her own emotions elevated him till he was as a god, and,\r\nas he gazed at her and listened, he seemed gazing on the face of life\r\nand reading its deepest secrets. And then, becoming aware of the\r\nheights of exquisite sensibility he attained, he decided that this was\r\nlove and that love was the greatest thing in the world. And in review\r\nwould pass along the corridors of memory all previous thrills and\r\nburnings he had known,\xe2\x80\x94the drunkenness of wine, the caresses of women,\r\nthe rough play and give and take of physical contests,\xe2\x80\x94and they seemed\r\ntrivial and mean compared with this sublime ardor he now enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe situation was obscured to Ruth. She had never had any experiences\r\nof the heart. Her only experiences in such matters were of the books,\r\nwhere the facts of ordinary day were translated by fancy into a fairy\r\nrealm of unreality; and she little knew that this rough sailor was\r\ncreeping into her heart and storing there pent forces that would some\r\nday burst forth and surge through her in waves of fire. She did not\r\nknow the actual fire of love. Her knowledge of love was purely\r\ntheoretical, and she conceived of it as lambent flame, gentle as the\r\nfall of dew or the ripple of quiet water, and cool as the velvet-dark\r\nof summer nights. Her idea of love was more that of placid affection,\r\nserving the loved one softly in an atmosphere, flower-scented and\r\ndim-lighted, of ethereal calm. She did not dream of the volcanic\r\nconvulsions of love, its scorching heat and sterile wastes of parched\r\nashes. She knew neither her own potencies, nor the potencies of the\r\nworld; and the deeps of life were to her seas of illusion. The conjugal\r\naffection of her father and mother constituted her ideal of\r\nlove-affinity, and she looked forward some day to emerging, without\r\nshock or friction, into that same quiet sweetness of existence with a\r\nloved one.\r\n\r\nSo it was that she looked upon Martin Eden as a novelty, a strange\r\nindividual, and she identified with novelty and strangeness the effects\r\nhe produced upon her. It was only natural. In similar ways she had\r\nexperienced unusual feelings when she looked at wild animals in the\r\nmenagerie, or when she witnessed a storm of wind, or shuddered at the\r\nbright-ribbed lightning. There was something cosmic in such things, and\r\nthere was something cosmic in him. He came to her breathing of large\r\nairs and great spaces. The blaze of tropic suns was in his face, and in\r\nhis swelling, resilient muscles was the primordial vigor of life. He\r\nwas marred and scarred by that mysterious world of rough men and\r\nrougher deeds, the outposts of which began beyond her horizon. He was\r\nuntamed, wild, and in secret ways her vanity was touched by the fact\r\nthat he came so mildly to her hand. Likewise she was stirred by the\r\ncommon impulse to tame the wild thing. It was an unconscious impulse,\r\nand farthest from her thoughts that her desire was to re-thumb the clay\r\nof him into a likeness of her father\xe2\x80\x99s image, which image she believed\r\nto be the finest in the world. Nor was there any way, out of her\r\ninexperience, for her to know that the cosmic feel she caught of him\r\nwas that most cosmic of things, love, which with equal power drew men\r\nand women together across the world, compelled stags to kill each other\r\nin the rutting season, and drove even the elements irresistibly to\r\nunite.\r\n\r\nHis swift development was a source of surprise and interest. She\r\ndetected unguessed finenesses in him that seemed to bud, day by day,\r\nlike flowers in congenial soil. She read Browning aloud to him, and was\r\noften puzzled by the strange interpretations he gave to mooted\r\npassages. It was beyond her to realize that, out of his experience of\r\nmen and women and life, his interpretations were far more frequently\r\ncorrect than hers. His conceptions seemed naive to her, though she was\r\noften fired by his daring flights of comprehension, whose orbit-path\r\nwas so wide among the stars that she could not follow and could only\r\nsit and thrill to the impact of unguessed power. Then she played to\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94no longer at him\xe2\x80\x94and probed him with music that sank to depths\r\nbeyond her plumb-line. His nature opened to music as a flower to the\r\nsun, and the transition was quick from his working-class rag-time and\r\njingles to her classical display pieces that she knew nearly by heart.\r\nYet he betrayed a democratic fondness for Wagner, and the \xe2\x80\x9cTannh\xc3\xa4user\xe2\x80\x9d\r\noverture, when she had given him the clew to it, claimed him as nothing\r\nelse she played. In an immediate way it personified his life. All his\r\npast was the _Venusburg_ motif, while her he identified somehow with\r\nthe _Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s Chorus_ motif; and from the exalted state this elevated\r\nhim to, he swept onward and upward into that vast shadow-realm of\r\nspirit-groping, where good and evil war eternally.\r\n\r\nSometimes he questioned, and induced in her mind temporary doubts as to\r\nthe correctness of her own definitions and conceptions of music. But\r\nher singing he did not question. It was too wholly her, and he sat\r\nalways amazed at the divine melody of her pure soprano voice. And he\r\ncould not help but contrast it with the weak pipings and shrill\r\nquaverings of factory girls, ill-nourished and untrained, and with the\r\nraucous shriekings from gin-cracked throats of the women of the seaport\r\ntowns. She enjoyed singing and playing to him. In truth, it was the\r\nfirst time she had ever had a human soul to play with, and the plastic\r\nclay of him was a delight to mould; for she thought she was moulding\r\nit, and her intentions were good. Besides, it was pleasant to be with\r\nhim. He did not repel her. That first repulsion had been really a fear\r\nof her undiscovered self, and the fear had gone to sleep. Though she\r\ndid not know it, she had a feeling in him of proprietary right. Also,\r\nhe had a tonic effect upon her. She was studying hard at the\r\nuniversity, and it seemed to strengthen her to emerge from the dusty\r\nbooks and have the fresh sea-breeze of his personality blow upon her.\r\nStrength! Strength was what she needed, and he gave it to her in\r\ngenerous measure. To come into the same room with him, or to meet him\r\nat the door, was to take heart of life. And when he had gone, she would\r\nreturn to her books with a keener zest and fresh store of energy.\r\n\r\nShe knew her Browning, but it had never sunk into her that it was an\r\nawkward thing to play with souls. As her interest in Martin increased,\r\nthe remodelling of his life became a passion with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d she said one afternoon, when grammar and\r\narithmetic and poetry had been put aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had comparatively no advantages at first. His father had been a\r\nbank cashier, but he lingered for years, dying of consumption in\r\nArizona, so that when he was dead, Mr. Butler, Charles Butler he was\r\ncalled, found himself alone in the world. His father had come from\r\nAustralia, you know, and so he had no relatives in California. He went\r\nto work in a printing-office,\xe2\x80\x94I have heard him tell of it many\r\ntimes,\xe2\x80\x94and he got three dollars a week, at first. His income to-day is\r\nat least thirty thousand a year. How did he do it? He was honest, and\r\nfaithful, and industrious, and economical. He denied himself the\r\nenjoyments that most boys indulge in. He made it a point to save so\r\nmuch every week, no matter what he had to do without in order to save\r\nit. Of course, he was soon earning more than three dollars a week, and\r\nas his wages increased he saved more and more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe worked in the daytime, and at night he went to night school. He had\r\nhis eyes fixed always on the future. Later on he went to night high\r\nschool. When he was only seventeen, he was earning excellent wages at\r\nsetting type, but he was ambitious. He wanted a career, not a\r\nlivelihood, and he was content to make immediate sacrifices for his\r\nultimate gain. He decided upon the law, and he entered father\xe2\x80\x99s office\r\nas an office boy\xe2\x80\x94think of that!\xe2\x80\x94and got only four dollars a week. But\r\nhe had learned how to be economical, and out of that four dollars he\r\nwent on saving money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused for breath, and to note how Martin was receiving it. His\r\nface was lighted up with interest in the youthful struggles of Mr.\r\nButler; but there was a frown upon his face as well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d say they was pretty hard lines for a young fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour dollars a week! How could he live on it? You can bet he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave any frills. Why, I pay five dollars a week for board now, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99 excitin\xe2\x80\x99 about it, you can lay to that. He must have\r\nlived like a dog. The food he ate\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cooked for himself,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9con a little kerosene stove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe food he ate must have been worse than what a sailor gets on the\r\nworst-feedin\xe2\x80\x99 deep-water ships, than which there ain\xe2\x80\x99t much that can be\r\npossibly worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut think of him now!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried enthusiastically. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of what his\r\nincome affords him. His early denials are paid for a thousand-fold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin looked at her sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is that Mr. Butler\r\nis nothin\xe2\x80\x99 gay-hearted now in his fat days. He fed himself like that\r\nfor years an\xe2\x80\x99 years, on a boy\xe2\x80\x99s stomach, an\xe2\x80\x99 I bet his stomach\xe2\x80\x99s none\r\ntoo good now for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes dropped before his searching gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet he\xe2\x80\x99s got dyspepsia right now!\xe2\x80\x9d Martin challenged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he has,\xe2\x80\x9d she confessed; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I bet,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin dashed on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\xe2\x80\x99s solemn an\xe2\x80\x99 serious as an old\r\nowl, an\xe2\x80\x99 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care a rap for a good time, for all his thirty\r\nthousand a year. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet he\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly joyful at seein\xe2\x80\x99\r\nothers have a good time. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head in agreement, and hastened to explain:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is not that type of man. By nature he is sober and serious. He\r\nalways was that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can bet he was,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin proclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThree dollars a week, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfour dollars a week, an\xe2\x80\x99 a young boy cookin\xe2\x80\x99 for himself on an\r\noil-burner an\xe2\x80\x99 layin\xe2\x80\x99 up money, workin\xe2\x80\x99 all day an\xe2\x80\x99 studyin\xe2\x80\x99 all night,\r\njust workin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 never playin\xe2\x80\x99, never havin\xe2\x80\x99 a good time, an\xe2\x80\x99 never\r\nlearnin\xe2\x80\x99 how to have a good time\xe2\x80\x94of course his thirty thousand came\r\nalong too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sympathetic imagination was flashing upon his inner sight all the\r\nthousands of details of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s existence and of his narrow spiritual\r\ndevelopment into a thirty-thousand-dollar-a-year man. With the\r\nswiftness and wide-reaching of multitudinous thought Charles Butler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhole life was telescoped upon his vision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel sorry for Mr. Butler. He was too young\r\nto know better, but he robbed himself of life for the sake of thirty\r\nthousand a year that\xe2\x80\x99s clean wasted upon him. Why, thirty thousand,\r\nlump sum, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy for him right now what ten cents he was layin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nup would have bought him, when he was a kid, in the way of candy an\xe2\x80\x99\r\npeanuts or a seat in nigger heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was just such uniqueness of points of view that startled Ruth. Not\r\nonly were they new to her, and contrary to her own beliefs, but she\r\nalways felt in them germs of truth that threatened to unseat or modify\r\nher own convictions. Had she been fourteen instead of twenty-four, she\r\nmight have been changed by them; but she was twenty-four, conservative\r\nby nature and upbringing, and already crystallized into the cranny of\r\nlife where she had been born and formed. It was true, his bizarre\r\njudgments troubled her in the moments they were uttered, but she\r\nascribed them to his novelty of type and strangeness of living, and\r\nthey were soon forgotten. Nevertheless, while she disapproved of them,\r\nthe strength of their utterance, and the flashing of eyes and\r\nearnestness of face that accompanied them, always thrilled her and drew\r\nher toward him. She would never have guessed that this man who had come\r\nfrom beyond her horizon, was, in such moments, flashing on beyond her\r\nhorizon with wider and deeper concepts. Her own limits were the limits\r\nof her horizon; but limited minds can recognize limitations only in\r\nothers. And so she felt that her outlook was very wide indeed, and that\r\nwhere his conflicted with hers marked his limitations; and she dreamed\r\nof helping him to see as she saw, of widening his horizon until it was\r\nidentified with hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have not finished my story,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe worked, so father\r\nsays, as no other office boy he ever had. Mr. Butler was always eager\r\nto work. He never was late, and he was usually at the office a few\r\nminutes before his regular time. And yet he saved his time. Every spare\r\nmoment was devoted to study. He studied book-keeping and type-writing,\r\nand he paid for lessons in shorthand by dictating at night to a court\r\nreporter who needed practice. He quickly became a clerk, and he made\r\nhimself invaluable. Father appreciated him and saw that he was bound to\r\nrise. It was on father\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that he went to law college. He\r\nbecame a lawyer, and hardly was he back in the office when father took\r\nhim in as junior partner. He is a great man. He refused the United\r\nStates Senate several times, and father says he could become a justice\r\nof the Supreme Court any time a vacancy occurs, if he wants to. Such a\r\nlife is an inspiration to all of us. It shows us that a man with will\r\nmay rise superior to his environment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a great man,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said sincerely.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed to him there was something in the recital that jarred\r\nupon his sense of beauty and life. He could not find an adequate motive\r\nin Mr. Butler\xe2\x80\x99s life of pinching and privation. Had he done it for love\r\nof a woman, or for attainment of beauty, Martin would have understood.\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s own mad lover should do anything for the kiss, but not for thirty\r\nthousand dollars a year. He was dissatisfied with Mr. Butler\xe2\x80\x99s career.\r\nThere was something paltry about it, after all. Thirty thousand a year\r\nwas all right, but dyspepsia and inability to be humanly happy robbed\r\nsuch princely income of all its value.\r\n\r\nMuch of this he strove to express to Ruth, and shocked her and made it\r\nclear that more remodelling was necessary. Hers was that common\r\ninsularity of mind that makes human creatures believe that their color,\r\ncreed, and politics are best and right and that other human creatures\r\nscattered over the world are less fortunately placed than they. It was\r\nthe same insularity of mind that made the ancient Jew thank God he was\r\nnot born a woman, and sent the modern missionary god-substituting to\r\nthe ends of the earth; and it made Ruth desire to shape this man from\r\nother crannies of life into the likeness of the men who lived in her\r\nparticular cranny of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack from sea Martin Eden came, homing for California with a lover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesire. His store of money exhausted, he had shipped before the mast on\r\nthe treasure-hunting schooner; and the Solomon Islands, after eight\r\nmonths of failure to find treasure, had witnessed the breaking up of\r\nthe expedition. The men had been paid off in Australia, and Martin had\r\nimmediately shipped on a deep-water vessel for San Francisco. Not alone\r\nhad those eight months earned him enough money to stay on land for many\r\nweeks, but they had enabled him to do a great deal of studying and\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nHis was the student\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and behind his ability to learn was the\r\nindomitability of his nature and his love for Ruth. The grammar he had\r\ntaken along he went through again and again until his unjaded brain had\r\nmastered it. He noticed the bad grammar used by his shipmates, and made\r\na point of mentally correcting and reconstructing their crudities of\r\nspeech. To his great joy he discovered that his ear was becoming\r\nsensitive and that he was developing grammatical nerves. A double\r\nnegative jarred him like a discord, and often, from lack of practice,\r\nit was from his own lips that the jar came. His tongue refused to learn\r\nnew tricks in a day.\r\n\r\nAfter he had been through the grammar repeatedly, he took up the\r\ndictionary and added twenty words a day to his vocabulary. He found\r\nthat this was no light task, and at wheel or lookout he steadily went\r\nover and over his lengthening list of pronunciations and definitions,\r\nwhile he invariably memorized himself to sleep. \xe2\x80\x9cNever did anything,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif I were,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthose things,\xe2\x80\x9d were phrases, with many variations,\r\nthat he repeated under his breath in order to accustom his tongue to\r\nthe language spoken by Ruth. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cing,\xe2\x80\x9d with the \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cg\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npronounced emphatically, he went over thousands of times; and to his\r\nsurprise he noticed that he was beginning to speak cleaner and more\r\ncorrect English than the officers themselves and the\r\ngentleman-adventurers in the cabin who had financed the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe captain was a fishy-eyed Norwegian who somehow had fallen into\r\npossession of a complete Shakespeare, which he never read, and Martin\r\nhad washed his clothes for him and in return been permitted access to\r\nthe precious volumes. For a time, so steeped was he in the plays and in\r\nthe many favorite passages that impressed themselves almost without\r\neffort on his brain, that all the world seemed to shape itself into\r\nforms of Elizabethan tragedy or comedy and his very thoughts were in\r\nblank verse. It trained his ear and gave him a fine appreciation for\r\nnoble English; withal it introduced into his mind much that was archaic\r\nand obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe eight months had been well spent, and, in addition to what he had\r\nlearned of right speaking and high thinking, he had learned much of\r\nhimself. Along with his humbleness because he knew so little, there\r\narose a conviction of power. He felt a sharp gradation between himself\r\nand his shipmates, and was wise enough to realize that the difference\r\nlay in potentiality rather than achievement. What he could do,\xe2\x80\x94they\r\ncould do; but within him he felt a confused ferment working that told\r\nhim there was more in him than he had done. He was tortured by the\r\nexquisite beauty of the world, and wished that Ruth were there to share\r\nit with him. He decided that he would describe to her many of the bits\r\nof South Sea beauty. The creative spirit in him flamed up at the\r\nthought and urged that he recreate this beauty for a wider audience\r\nthan Ruth. And then, in splendor and glory, came the great idea. He\r\nwould write. He would be one of the eyes through which the world saw,\r\none of the ears through which it heard, one of the hearts through which\r\nit felt. He would write\xe2\x80\x94everything\xe2\x80\x94poetry and prose, fiction and\r\ndescription, and plays like Shakespeare. There was career and the way\r\nto win to Ruth. The men of literature were the world\xe2\x80\x99s giants, and he\r\nconceived them to be far finer than the Mr. Butlers who earned thirty\r\nthousand a year and could be Supreme Court justices if they wanted to.\r\n\r\nOnce the idea had germinated, it mastered him, and the return voyage to\r\nSan Francisco was like a dream. He was drunken with unguessed power and\r\nfelt that he could do anything. In the midst of the great and lonely\r\nsea he gained perspective. Clearly, and for the first time, he saw Ruth\r\nand her world. It was all visualized in his mind as a concrete thing\r\nwhich he could take up in his two hands and turn around and about and\r\nexamine. There was much that was dim and nebulous in that world, but he\r\nsaw it as a whole and not in detail, and he saw, also, the way to\r\nmaster it. To write! The thought was fire in him. He would begin as\r\nsoon as he got back. The first thing he would do would be to describe\r\nthe voyage of the treasure-hunters. He would sell it to some San\r\nFrancisco newspaper. He would not tell Ruth anything about it, and she\r\nwould be surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print. While he\r\nwrote, he could go on studying. There were twenty-four hours in each\r\nday. He was invincible. He knew how to work, and the citadels would go\r\ndown before him. He would not have to go to sea again\xe2\x80\x94as a sailor; and\r\nfor the instant he caught a vision of a steam yacht. There were other\r\nwriters who possessed steam yachts. Of course, he cautioned himself, it\r\nwould be slow succeeding at first, and for a time he would be content\r\nto earn enough money by his writing to enable him to go on studying.\r\nAnd then, after some time,\xe2\x80\x94a very indeterminate time,\xe2\x80\x94when he had\r\nlearned and prepared himself, he would write the great things and his\r\nname would be on all men\xe2\x80\x99s lips. But greater than that, infinitely\r\ngreater and greatest of all, he would have proved himself worthy of\r\nRuth. Fame was all very well, but it was for Ruth that his splendid\r\ndream arose. He was not a fame-monger, but merely one of God\xe2\x80\x99s mad\r\nlovers.\r\n\r\nArrived in Oakland, with his snug pay-day in his pocket, he took up his\r\nold room at Bernard Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s and set to work. He did not even let\r\nRuth know he was back. He would go and see her when he finished the\r\narticle on the treasure-hunters. It was not so difficult to abstain\r\nfrom seeing her, because of the violent heat of creative fever that\r\nburned in him. Besides, the very article he was writing would bring her\r\nnearer to him. He did not know how long an article he should write, but\r\nhe counted the words in a double-page article in the Sunday supplement\r\nof the _San Francisco Examiner_, and guided himself by that. Three\r\ndays, at white heat, completed his narrative; but when he had copied it\r\ncarefully, in a large scrawl that was easy to read, he learned from a\r\nrhetoric he picked up in the library that there were such things as\r\nparagraphs and quotation marks. He had never thought of such things\r\nbefore; and he promptly set to work writing the article over, referring\r\ncontinually to the pages of the rhetoric and learning more in a day\r\nabout composition than the average schoolboy in a year. When he had\r\ncopied the article a second time and rolled it up carefully, he read in\r\na newspaper an item on hints to beginners, and discovered the iron law\r\nthat manuscripts should never be rolled and that they should be written\r\non one side of the paper. He had violated the law on both counts. Also,\r\nhe learned from the item that first-class papers paid a minimum of ten\r\ndollars a column. So, while he copied the manuscript a third time, he\r\nconsoled himself by multiplying ten columns by ten dollars. The product\r\nwas always the same, one hundred dollars, and he decided that that was\r\nbetter than seafaring. If it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for his blunders, he would\r\nhave finished the article in three days. One hundred dollars in three\r\ndays! It would have taken him three months and longer on the sea to\r\nearn a similar amount. A man was a fool to go to sea when he could\r\nwrite, he concluded, though the money in itself meant nothing to him.\r\nIts value was in the liberty it would get him, the presentable garments\r\nit would buy him, all of which would bring him nearer, swiftly nearer,\r\nto the slender, pale girl who had turned his life back upon itself and\r\ngiven him inspiration.\r\n\r\nHe mailed the manuscript in a flat envelope, and addressed it to the\r\neditor of the _San Francisco Examiner_. He had an idea that anything\r\naccepted by a paper was published immediately, and as he had sent the\r\nmanuscript in on Friday he expected it to come out on the following\r\nSunday. He conceived that it would be fine to let that event apprise\r\nRuth of his return. Then, Sunday afternoon, he would call and see her.\r\nIn the meantime he was occupied by another idea, which he prided\r\nhimself upon as being a particularly sane, careful, and modest idea. He\r\nwould write an adventure story for boys and sell it to _The Youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCompanion_. He went to the free reading-room and looked through the\r\nfiles of _The Youth\xe2\x80\x99s Companion_. Serial stories, he found, were\r\nusually published in that weekly in five instalments of about three\r\nthousand words each. He discovered several serials that ran to seven\r\ninstalments, and decided to write one of that length.\r\n\r\nHe had been on a whaling voyage in the Arctic, once\xe2\x80\x94a voyage that was\r\nto have been for three years and which had terminated in shipwreck at\r\nthe end of six months. While his imagination was fanciful, even\r\nfantastic at times, he had a basic love of reality that compelled him\r\nto write about the things he knew. He knew whaling, and out of the real\r\nmaterials of his knowledge he proceeded to manufacture the fictitious\r\nadventures of the two boys he intended to use as joint heroes. It was\r\neasy work, he decided on Saturday evening. He had completed on that day\r\nthe first instalment of three thousand words\xe2\x80\x94much to the amusement of\r\nJim, and to the open derision of Mr. Higginbotham, who sneered\r\nthroughout meal-time at the \xe2\x80\x9clitery\xe2\x80\x9d person they had discovered in the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nMartin contented himself by picturing his brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s surprise on\r\nSunday morning when he opened his _Examiner_ and saw the article on the\r\ntreasure-hunters. Early that morning he was out himself to the front\r\ndoor, nervously racing through the many-sheeted newspaper. He went\r\nthrough it a second time, very carefully, then folded it up and left it\r\nwhere he had found it. He was glad he had not told any one about his\r\narticle. On second thought he concluded that he had been wrong about\r\nthe speed with which things found their way into newspaper columns.\r\nBesides, there had not been any news value in his article, and most\r\nlikely the editor would write to him about it first.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast he went on with his serial. The words flowed from his\r\npen, though he broke off from the writing frequently to look up\r\ndefinitions in the dictionary or to refer to the rhetoric. He often\r\nread or re-read a chapter at a time, during such pauses; and he\r\nconsoled himself that while he was not writing the great things he felt\r\nto be in him, he was learning composition, at any rate, and training\r\nhimself to shape up and express his thoughts. He toiled on till dark,\r\nwhen he went out to the reading-room and explored magazines and\r\nweeklies until the place closed at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. This was his programme\r\nfor a week. Each day he did three thousand words, and each evening he\r\npuzzled his way through the magazines, taking note of the stories,\r\narticles, and poems that editors saw fit to publish. One thing was\r\ncertain: What these multitudinous writers did he could do, and only\r\ngive him time and he would do what they could not do. He was cheered to\r\nread in _Book News_, in a paragraph on the payment of magazine writers,\r\nnot that Rudyard Kipling received a dollar per word, but that the\r\nminimum rate paid by first-class magazines was two cents a word. _The\r\nYouth\xe2\x80\x99s Companion_ was certainly first class, and at that rate the\r\nthree thousand words he had written that day would bring him sixty\r\ndollars\xe2\x80\x94two months\xe2\x80\x99 wages on the sea!\r\n\r\nOn Friday night he finished the serial, twenty-one thousand words long.\r\nAt two cents a word, he calculated, that would bring him four hundred\r\nand twenty dollars. Not a bad week\xe2\x80\x99s work. It was more money than he\r\nhad ever possessed at one time. He did not know how he could spend it\r\nall. He had tapped a gold mine. Where this came from he could always\r\nget more. He planned to buy some more clothes, to subscribe to many\r\nmagazines, and to buy dozens of reference books that at present he was\r\ncompelled to go to the library to consult. And still there was a large\r\nportion of the four hundred and twenty dollars unspent. This worried\r\nhim until the thought came to him of hiring a servant for Gertrude and\r\nof buying a bicycle for Marian.\r\n\r\nHe mailed the bulky manuscript to _The Youth\xe2\x80\x99s Companion_, and on\r\nSaturday afternoon, after having planned an article on pearl-diving, he\r\nwent to see Ruth. He had telephoned, and she went herself to greet him\r\nat the door. The old familiar blaze of health rushed out from him and\r\nstruck her like a blow. It seemed to enter into her body and course\r\nthrough her veins in a liquid glow, and to set her quivering with its\r\nimparted strength. He flushed warmly as he took her hand and looked\r\ninto her blue eyes, but the fresh bronze of eight months of sun hid the\r\nflush, though it did not protect the neck from the gnawing chafe of the\r\nstiff collar. She noted the red line of it with amusement which quickly\r\nvanished as she glanced at his clothes. They really fitted him,\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nhis first made-to-order suit,\xe2\x80\x94and he seemed slimmer and better\r\nmodelled. In addition, his cloth cap had been replaced by a soft hat,\r\nwhich she commanded him to put on and then complimented him on his\r\nappearance. She did not remember when she had felt so happy. This\r\nchange in him was her handiwork, and she was proud of it and fired with\r\nambition further to help him.\r\n\r\nBut the most radical change of all, and the one that pleased her most,\r\nwas the change in his speech. Not only did he speak more correctly, but\r\nhe spoke more easily, and there were many new words in his vocabulary.\r\nWhen he grew excited or enthusiastic, however, he dropped back into the\r\nold slurring and the dropping of final consonants. Also, there was an\r\nawkward hesitancy, at times, as he essayed the new words he had\r\nlearned. On the other hand, along with his ease of expression, he\r\ndisplayed a lightness and facetiousness of thought that delighted her.\r\nIt was his old spirit of humor and badinage that had made him a\r\nfavorite in his own class, but which he had hitherto been unable to use\r\nin her presence through lack of words and training. He was just\r\nbeginning to orientate himself and to feel that he was not wholly an\r\nintruder. But he was very tentative, fastidiously so, letting Ruth set\r\nthe pace of sprightliness and fancy, keeping up with her but never\r\ndaring to go beyond her.\r\n\r\nHe told her of what he had been doing, and of his plan to write for a\r\nlivelihood and of going on with his studies. But he was disappointed at\r\nher lack of approval. She did not think much of his plan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d she said frankly, \xe2\x80\x9cwriting must be a trade, like anything\r\nelse. Not that I know anything about it, of course. I only bring common\r\njudgment to bear. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hope to be a blacksmith without spending\r\nthree years at learning the trade\xe2\x80\x94or is it five years! Now writers are\r\nso much better paid than blacksmiths that there must be ever so many\r\nmore men who would like to write, who\xe2\x80\x94try to write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, may not I be peculiarly constituted to write?\xe2\x80\x9d he queried,\r\nsecretly exulting at the language he had used, his swift imagination\r\nthrowing the whole scene and atmosphere upon a vast screen along with a\r\nthousand other scenes from his life\xe2\x80\x94scenes that were rough and raw,\r\ngross and bestial.\r\n\r\nThe whole composite vision was achieved with the speed of light,\r\nproducing no pause in the conversation, nor interrupting his calm train\r\nof thought. On the screen of his imagination he saw himself and this\r\nsweet and beautiful girl, facing each other and conversing in good\r\nEnglish, in a room of books and paintings and tone and culture, and all\r\nilluminated by a bright light of steadfast brilliance; while ranged\r\nabout and fading away to the remote edges of the screen were\r\nantithetical scenes, each scene a picture, and he the onlooker, free to\r\nlook at will upon what he wished. He saw these other scenes through\r\ndrifting vapors and swirls of sullen fog dissolving before shafts of\r\nred and garish light. He saw cowboys at the bar, drinking fierce\r\nwhiskey, the air filled with obscenity and ribald language, and he saw\r\nhimself with them drinking and cursing with the wildest, or sitting at\r\ntable with them, under smoking kerosene lamps, while the chips clicked\r\nand clattered and the cards were dealt around. He saw himself, stripped\r\nto the waist, with naked fists, fighting his great fight with Liverpool\r\nRed in the forecastle of the _Susquehanna_; and he saw the bloody deck\r\nof the _John Rogers_, that gray morning of attempted mutiny, the mate\r\nkicking in death-throes on the main-hatch, the revolver in the old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s hand spitting fire and smoke, the men with passion-wrenched\r\nfaces, of brutes screaming vile blasphemies and falling about him\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen he returned to the central scene, calm and clean in the steadfast\r\nlight, where Ruth sat and talked with him amid books and paintings; and\r\nhe saw the grand piano upon which she would later play to him; and he\r\nheard the echoes of his own selected and correct words, \xe2\x80\x9cBut then, may\r\nI not be peculiarly constituted to write?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no matter how peculiarly constituted a man may be for\r\nblacksmithing,\xe2\x80\x9d she was laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of one becoming a\r\nblacksmith without first serving his apprenticeship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you advise?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that I feel in me\r\nthis capacity to write\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain it; I just know that it is in\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must get a thorough education,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not\r\nyou ultimately become a writer. This education is indispensable for\r\nwhatever career you select, and it must not be slipshod or sketchy. You\r\nshould go to high school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began; but she interrupted with an afterthought:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you could go on with your writing, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have to,\xe2\x80\x9d he said grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him, prettily puzzled, for she did not quite like\r\nthe persistence with which he clung to his notion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, without writing there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any high school. I must\r\nlive and buy books and clothes, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten that,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy weren\xe2\x80\x99t you born with an\r\nincome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather have good health and imagination,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI can make\r\ngood on the income, but the other things have to be made good for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nalmost said \xe2\x80\x9cyou,\xe2\x80\x9d then amended his sentence to, \xe2\x80\x9chave to be made good\r\nfor one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98make good,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, sweetly petulant. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s slang, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s horrid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flushed, and stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, and I only wish you\xe2\x80\x99d correct\r\nme every time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d like to,\xe2\x80\x9d she said haltingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have so much in you that is\r\ngood that I want to see you perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was clay in her hands immediately, as passionately desirous of being\r\nmoulded by her as she was desirous of shaping him into the image of her\r\nideal of man. And when she pointed out the opportuneness of the time,\r\nthat the entrance examinations to high school began on the following\r\nMonday, he promptly volunteered that he would take them.\r\n\r\nThen she played and sang to him, while he gazed with hungry yearning at\r\nher, drinking in her loveliness and marvelling that there should not be\r\na hundred suitors listening there and longing for her as he listened\r\nand longed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stopped to dinner that evening, and, much to Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction,\r\nmade a favorable impression on her father. They talked about the sea as\r\na career, a subject which Martin had at his finger-ends, and Mr. Morse\r\nremarked afterward that he seemed a very clear-headed young man. In his\r\navoidance of slang and his search after right words, Martin was\r\ncompelled to talk slowly, which enabled him to find the best thoughts\r\nthat were in him. He was more at ease than that first night at dinner,\r\nnearly a year before, and his shyness and modesty even commended him to\r\nMrs. Morse, who was pleased at his manifest improvement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is the first man that ever drew passing notice from Ruth,\xe2\x80\x9d she told\r\nher husband. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has been so singularly backward where men are\r\nconcerned that I have been worried greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Morse looked at his wife curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to use this young sailor to wake her up?\xe2\x80\x9d he questioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that she is not to die an old maid if I can help it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nanswer. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this young Eden can arouse her interest in mankind in\r\ngeneral, it will be a good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very good thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he commented. \xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose,\xe2\x80\x94and we must suppose,\r\nsometimes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x94suppose he arouses her interest too particularly in\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Morse laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is three years older than he,\r\nand, besides, it is impossible. Nothing will ever come of it. Trust\r\nthat to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so Martin\xe2\x80\x99s r\xc3\xb4le was arranged for him, while he, led on by Arthur\r\nand Norman, was meditating an extravagance. They were going out for a\r\nride into the hills Sunday morning on their wheels, which did not\r\ninterest Martin until he learned that Ruth, too, rode a wheel and was\r\ngoing along. He did not ride, nor own a wheel, but if Ruth rode, it was\r\nup to him to begin, was his decision; and when he said good night, he\r\nstopped in at a cyclery on his way home and spent forty dollars for a\r\nwheel. It was more than a month\xe2\x80\x99s hard-earned wages, and it reduced his\r\nstock of money amazingly; but when he added the hundred dollars he was\r\nto receive from the _Examiner_ to the four hundred and twenty dollars\r\nthat was the least _The Youth\xe2\x80\x99s Companion_ could pay him, he felt that\r\nhe had reduced the perplexity the unwonted amount of money had caused\r\nhim. Nor did he mind, in the course of learning to ride the wheel home,\r\nthe fact that he ruined his suit of clothes. He caught the tailor by\r\ntelephone that night from Mr. Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s store and ordered another\r\nsuit. Then he carried the wheel up the narrow stairway that clung like\r\na fire-escape to the rear wall of the building, and when he had moved\r\nhis bed out from the wall, found there was just space enough in the\r\nsmall room for himself and the wheel.\r\n\r\nSunday he had intended to devote to studying for the high school\r\nexamination, but the pearl-diving article lured him away, and he spent\r\nthe day in the white-hot fever of re-creating the beauty and romance\r\nthat burned in him. The fact that the _Examiner_ of that morning had\r\nfailed to publish his treasure-hunting article did not dash his\r\nspirits. He was at too great a height for that, and having been deaf to\r\na twice-repeated summons, he went without the heavy Sunday dinner with\r\nwhich Mr. Higginbotham invariably graced his table. To Mr. Higginbotham\r\nsuch a dinner was advertisement of his worldly achievement and\r\nprosperity, and he honored it by delivering platitudinous sermonettes\r\nupon American institutions and the opportunity said institutions gave\r\nto any hard-working man to rise\xe2\x80\x94the rise, in his case, which he pointed\r\nout unfailingly, being from a grocer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk to the ownership of\r\nHigginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s Cash Store.\r\n\r\nMartin Eden looked with a sigh at his unfinished \xe2\x80\x9cPearl-diving\xe2\x80\x9d on\r\nMonday morning, and took the car down to Oakland to the high school.\r\nAnd when, days later, he applied for the results of his examinations,\r\nhe learned that he had failed in everything save grammar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour grammar is excellent,\xe2\x80\x9d Professor Hilton informed him, staring at\r\nhim through heavy spectacles; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you know nothing, positively\r\nnothing, in the other branches, and your United States history is\r\nabominable\xe2\x80\x94there is no other word for it, abominable. I should advise\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProfessor Hilton paused and glared at him, unsympathetic and\r\nunimaginative as one of his own test-tubes. He was professor of physics\r\nin the high school, possessor of a large family, a meagre salary, and a\r\nselect fund of parrot-learned knowledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said humbly, wishing somehow that the man at the\r\ndesk in the library was in Professor Hilton\xe2\x80\x99s place just then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I should advise you to go back to the grammar school for at least\r\ntwo years. Good day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin was not deeply affected by his failure, though he was surprised\r\nat Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s shocked expression when he told her Professor Hilton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadvice. Her disappointment was so evident that he was sorry he had\r\nfailed, but chiefly so for her sake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see I was right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know far more than any of the\r\nstudents entering high school, and yet you can\xe2\x80\x99t pass the examinations.\r\nIt is because what education you have is fragmentary, sketchy. You need\r\nthe discipline of study, such as only skilled teachers can give you.\r\nYou must be thoroughly grounded. Professor Hilton is right, and if I\r\nwere you, I\xe2\x80\x99d go to night school. A year and a half of it might enable\r\nyou to catch up that additional six months. Besides, that would leave\r\nyou your days in which to write, or, if you could not make your living\r\nby your pen, you would have your days in which to work in some\r\nposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut if my days are taken up with work and my nights with school, when\r\nam I going to see you?\xe2\x80\x94was Martin\xe2\x80\x99s first thought, though he refrained\r\nfrom uttering it. Instead, he said:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems so babyish for me to be going to night school. But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind that if I thought it would pay. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will pay. I\r\ncan do the work quicker than they can teach me. It would be a loss of\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he thought of her and his desire to have her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford\r\nthe time. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the time to spare, in fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is so much that is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him gently, and he\r\nwas a brute to oppose her. \xe2\x80\x9cPhysics and chemistry\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t do them\r\nwithout laboratory study; and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find algebra and geometry almost\r\nhopeless without instruction. You need the skilled teachers, the\r\nspecialists in the art of imparting knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a minute, casting about for the least vainglorious\r\nway in which to express himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m bragging,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t intend it that\r\nway at all. But I have a feeling that I am what I may call a natural\r\nstudent. I can study by myself. I take to it kindly, like a duck to\r\nwater. You see yourself what I did with grammar. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned much\r\nof other things\xe2\x80\x94you would never dream how much. And I\xe2\x80\x99m only getting\r\nstarted. Wait till I get\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated and assured himself of the\r\npronunciation before he said \xe2\x80\x9cmomentum. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting my first real feel\r\nof things now. I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to size up the situation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98size up,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get a line on things,\xe2\x80\x9d he hastily amended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything in correct English,\xe2\x80\x9d she objected.\r\n\r\nHe floundered for a fresh start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\xe2\x80\x99m driving at is that I\xe2\x80\x99m beginning to get the lay of the land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOut of pity she forebore, and he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnowledge seems to me like a chart-room. Whenever I go into the\r\nlibrary, I am impressed that way. The part played by teachers is to\r\nteach the student the contents of the chart-room in a systematic way.\r\nThe teachers are guides to the chart-room, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. It\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nsomething that they have in their own heads. They don\xe2\x80\x99t make it up,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t create it. It\xe2\x80\x99s all in the chart-room and they know their way\r\nabout in it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s their business to show the place to strangers who\r\nmight else get lost. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t get lost easily. I have the bump of\r\nlocation. I usually know where I\xe2\x80\x99m at\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98where I\xe2\x80\x99m at.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gratefully, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere I am. But where am I at\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmean, where am I? Oh, yes, in the chart-room. Well, some people\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPersons,\xe2\x80\x9d she corrected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome persons need guides, most persons do; but I think I can get along\r\nwithout them. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of time in the chart-room now, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\non the edge of knowing my way about, what charts I want to refer to,\r\nwhat coasts I want to explore. And from the way I line it up, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nexplore a whole lot more quickly by myself. The speed of a fleet, you\r\nknow, is the speed of the slowest ship, and the speed of the teachers\r\nis affected the same way. They can\xe2\x80\x99t go any faster than the ruck of\r\ntheir scholars, and I can set a faster pace for myself than they set\r\nfor a whole schoolroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He travels the fastest who travels alone,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she quoted at him.\r\n\r\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99d travel faster with you just the same, was what he wanted to\r\nblurt out, as he caught a vision of a world without end of sunlit\r\nspaces and starry voids through which he drifted with her, his arm\r\naround her, her pale gold hair blowing about his face. In the same\r\ninstant he was aware of the pitiful inadequacy of speech. God! If he\r\ncould so frame words that she could see what he then saw! And he felt\r\nthe stir in him, like a throe of yearning pain, of the desire to paint\r\nthese visions that flashed unsummoned on the mirror of his mind. Ah,\r\nthat was it! He caught at the hem of the secret. It was the very thing\r\nthat the great writers and master-poets did. That was why they were\r\ngiants. They knew how to express what they thought, and felt, and saw.\r\nDogs asleep in the sun often whined and barked, but they were unable to\r\ntell what they saw that made them whine and bark. He had often wondered\r\nwhat it was. And that was all he was, a dog asleep in the sun. He saw\r\nnoble and beautiful visions, but he could only whine and bark at Ruth.\r\nBut he would cease sleeping in the sun. He would stand up, with open\r\neyes, and he would struggle and toil and learn until, with eyes\r\nunblinded and tongue untied, he could share with her his visioned\r\nwealth. Other men had discovered the trick of expression, of making\r\nwords obedient servitors, and of making combinations of words mean more\r\nthan the sum of their separate meanings. He was stirred profoundly by\r\nthe passing glimpse at the secret, and he was again caught up in the\r\nvision of sunlit spaces and starry voids\xe2\x80\x94until it came to him that it\r\nwas very quiet, and he saw Ruth regarding him with an amused expression\r\nand a smile in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had a great visioning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and at the sound of his words\r\nin his own ears his heart gave a leap. Where had those words come from?\r\nThey had adequately expressed the pause his vision had put in the\r\nconversation. It was a miracle. Never had he so loftily framed a lofty\r\nthought. But never had he attempted to frame lofty thoughts in words.\r\nThat was it. That explained it. He had never tried. But Swinburne had,\r\nand Tennyson, and Kipling, and all the other poets. His mind flashed on\r\nto his \xe2\x80\x9cPearl-diving.\xe2\x80\x9d He had never dared the big things, the spirit of\r\nthe beauty that was a fire in him. That article would be a different\r\nthing when he was done with it. He was appalled by the vastness of the\r\nbeauty that rightfully belonged in it, and again his mind flashed and\r\ndared, and he demanded of himself why he could not chant that beauty in\r\nnoble verse as the great poets did. And there was all the mysterious\r\ndelight and spiritual wonder of his love for Ruth. Why could he not\r\nchant that, too, as the poets did? They had sung of love. So would he.\r\nBy God!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAnd in his frightened ears he heard his exclamation echoing. Carried\r\naway, he had breathed it aloud. The blood surged into his face, wave\r\nupon wave, mastering the bronze of it till the blush of shame flaunted\r\nitself from collar-rim to the roots of his hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounded as if you were praying,\xe2\x80\x9d she said bravely, but she felt\r\nherself inside to be withering and shrinking. It was the first time she\r\nhad heard an oath from the lips of a man she knew, and she was shocked,\r\nnot merely as a matter of principle and training, but shocked in spirit\r\nby this rough blast of life in the garden of her sheltered maidenhood.\r\n\r\nBut she forgave, and with surprise at the ease of her forgiveness.\r\nSomehow it was not so difficult to forgive him anything. He had not had\r\na chance to be as other men, and he was trying so hard, and succeeding,\r\ntoo. It never entered her head that there could be any other reason for\r\nher being kindly disposed toward him. She was tenderly disposed toward\r\nhim, but she did not know it. She had no way of knowing it. The placid\r\npoise of twenty-four years without a single love affair did not fit her\r\nwith a keen perception of her own feelings, and she who had never\r\nwarmed to actual love was unaware that she was warming now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin went back to his pearl-diving article, which would have been\r\nfinished sooner if it had not been broken in upon so frequently by his\r\nattempts to write poetry. His poems were love poems, inspired by Ruth,\r\nbut they were never completed. Not in a day could he learn to chant in\r\nnoble verse. Rhyme and metre and structure were serious enough in\r\nthemselves, but there was, over and beyond them, an intangible and\r\nevasive something that he caught in all great poetry, but which he\r\ncould not catch and imprison in his own. It was the elusive spirit of\r\npoetry itself that he sensed and sought after but could not capture. It\r\nseemed a glow to him, a warm and trailing vapor, ever beyond his\r\nreaching, though sometimes he was rewarded by catching at shreds of it\r\nand weaving them into phrases that echoed in his brain with haunting\r\nnotes or drifted across his vision in misty wafture of unseen beauty.\r\nIt was baffling. He ached with desire to express and could but gibber\r\nprosaically as everybody gibbered. He read his fragments aloud. The\r\nmetre marched along on perfect feet, and the rhyme pounded a longer and\r\nequally faultless rhythm, but the glow and high exaltation that he felt\r\nwithin were lacking. He could not understand, and time and again, in\r\ndespair, defeated and depressed, he returned to his article. Prose was\r\ncertainly an easier medium.\r\n\r\nFollowing the \xe2\x80\x9cPearl-diving,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote an article on the sea as a\r\ncareer, another on turtle-catching, and a third on the northeast\r\ntrades. Then he tried, as an experiment, a short story, and before he\r\nbroke his stride he had finished six short stories and despatched them\r\nto various magazines. He wrote prolifically, intensely, from morning\r\ntill night, and late at night, except when he broke off to go to the\r\nreading-room, draw books from the library, or to call on Ruth. He was\r\nprofoundly happy. Life was pitched high. He was in a fever that never\r\nbroke. The joy of creation that is supposed to belong to the gods was\r\nhis. All the life about him\xe2\x80\x94the odors of stale vegetables and soapsuds,\r\nthe slatternly form of his sister, and the jeering face of Mr.\r\nHigginbotham\xe2\x80\x94was a dream. The real world was in his mind, and the\r\nstories he wrote were so many pieces of reality out of his mind.\r\n\r\nThe days were too short. There was so much he wanted to study. He cut\r\nhis sleep down to five hours and found that he could get along upon it.\r\nHe tried four hours and a half, and regretfully came back to five. He\r\ncould joyfully have spent all his waking hours upon any one of his\r\npursuits. It was with regret that he ceased from writing to study, that\r\nhe ceased from study to go to the library, that he tore himself away\r\nfrom that chart-room of knowledge or from the magazines in the\r\nreading-room that were filled with the secrets of writers who succeeded\r\nin selling their wares. It was like severing heart strings, when he was\r\nwith Ruth, to stand up and go; and he scorched through the dark streets\r\nso as to get home to his books at the least possible expense of time.\r\nAnd hardest of all was it to shut up the algebra or physics, put\r\nnote-book and pencil aside, and close his tired eyes in sleep. He hated\r\nthe thought of ceasing to live, even for so short a time, and his sole\r\nconsolation was that the alarm clock was set five hours ahead. He would\r\nlose only five hours anyway, and then the jangling bell would jerk him\r\nout of unconsciousness and he would have before him another glorious\r\nday of nineteen hours.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the weeks were passing, his money was ebbing low, and\r\nthere was no money coming in. A month after he had mailed it, the\r\nadventure serial for boys was returned to him by _The Youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCompanion_. The rejection slip was so tactfully worded that he felt\r\nkindly toward the editor. But he did not feel so kindly toward the\r\neditor of the _San Francisco Examiner_. After waiting two whole weeks,\r\nMartin had written to him. A week later he wrote again. At the end of\r\nthe month, he went over to San Francisco and personally called upon the\r\neditor. But he did not meet that exalted personage, thanks to a\r\nCerberus of an office boy, of tender years and red hair, who guarded\r\nthe portals. At the end of the fifth week the manuscript came back to\r\nhim, by mail, without comment. There was no rejection slip, no\r\nexplanation, nothing. In the same way his other articles were tied up\r\nwith the other leading San Francisco papers. When he recovered them, he\r\nsent them to the magazines in the East, from which they were returned\r\nmore promptly, accompanied always by the printed rejection slips.\r\n\r\nThe short stories were returned in similar fashion. He read them over\r\nand over, and liked them so much that he could not puzzle out the cause\r\nof their rejection, until, one day, he read in a newspaper that\r\nmanuscripts should always be typewritten. That explained it. Of course\r\neditors were so busy that they could not afford the time and strain of\r\nreading handwriting. Martin rented a typewriter and spent a day\r\nmastering the machine. Each day he typed what he composed, and he typed\r\nhis earlier manuscripts as fast as they were returned him. He was\r\nsurprised when the typed ones began to come back. His jaw seemed to\r\nbecome squarer, his chin more aggressive, and he bundled the\r\nmanuscripts off to new editors.\r\n\r\nThe thought came to him that he was not a good judge of his own work.\r\nHe tried it out on Gertrude. He read his stories aloud to her. Her eyes\r\nglistened, and she looked at him proudly as she said:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t it grand, you writin\xe2\x80\x99 those sort of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the story\xe2\x80\x94how did you like\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust grand,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cJust grand, an\xe2\x80\x99 thrilling, too. I was all\r\nworked up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could see that her mind was not clear. The perplexity was strong in\r\nher good-natured face. So he waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, say, Mart,\xe2\x80\x9d after a long pause, \xe2\x80\x9chow did it end? Did that young\r\nman who spoke so highfalutin\xe2\x80\x99 get her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, after he had explained the end, which he thought he had made\r\nartistically obvious, she would say:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I wanted to know. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you write that way in the\r\nstory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne thing he learned, after he had read her a number of stories,\r\nnamely, that she liked happy endings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat story was perfectly grand,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced, straightening up from\r\nthe wash-tub with a tired sigh and wiping the sweat from her forehead\r\nwith a red, steamy hand; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it makes me sad. I want to cry. There is\r\ntoo many sad things in the world anyway. It makes me happy to think\r\nabout happy things. Now if he\xe2\x80\x99d married her, and\xe2\x80\x94You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, Mart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe queried apprehensively. \xe2\x80\x9cI just happen to feel that way, because\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m tired, I guess. But the story was grand just the same, perfectly\r\ngrand. Where are you goin\xe2\x80\x99 to sell it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a horse of another color,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you _did_ sell it, what do you think you\xe2\x80\x99d get for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a hundred dollars. That would be the least, the way prices go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy! I do hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll sell it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasy money, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d Then he added proudly: \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote it in two days.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s fifty dollars a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe longed to read his stories to Ruth, but did not dare. He would wait\r\ntill some were published, he decided, then she would understand what he\r\nhad been working for. In the meantime he toiled on. Never had the\r\nspirit of adventure lured him more strongly than on this amazing\r\nexploration of the realm of mind. He bought the text-books on physics\r\nand chemistry, and, along with his algebra, worked out problems and\r\ndemonstrations. He took the laboratory proofs on faith, and his intense\r\npower of vision enabled him to see the reactions of chemicals more\r\nunderstandingly than the average student saw them in the laboratory.\r\nMartin wandered on through the heavy pages, overwhelmed by the clews he\r\nwas getting to the nature of things. He had accepted the world as the\r\nworld, but now he was comprehending the organization of it, the play\r\nand interplay of force and matter. Spontaneous explanations of old\r\nmatters were continually arising in his mind. Levers and purchases\r\nfascinated him, and his mind roved backward to hand-spikes and blocks\r\nand tackles at sea. The theory of navigation, which enabled the ships\r\nto travel unerringly their courses over the pathless ocean, was made\r\nclear to him. The mysteries of storm, and rain, and tide were revealed,\r\nand the reason for the existence of trade-winds made him wonder whether\r\nhe had written his article on the northeast trade too soon. At any rate\r\nhe knew he could write it better now. One afternoon he went out with\r\nArthur to the University of California, and, with bated breath and a\r\nfeeling of religious awe, went through the laboratories, saw\r\ndemonstrations, and listened to a physics professor lecturing to his\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nBut he did not neglect his writing. A stream of short stories flowed\r\nfrom his pen, and he branched out into the easier forms of verse\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nkind he saw printed in the magazines\xe2\x80\x94though he lost his head and wasted\r\ntwo weeks on a tragedy in blank verse, the swift rejection of which, by\r\nhalf a dozen magazines, dumfounded him. Then he discovered Henley and\r\nwrote a series of sea-poems on the model of \xe2\x80\x9cHospital Sketches.\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\nwere simple poems, of light and color, and romance and adventure. \xe2\x80\x9cSea\r\nLyrics,\xe2\x80\x9d he called them, and he judged them to be the best work he had\r\nyet done. There were thirty, and he completed them in a month, doing\r\none a day after having done his regular day\xe2\x80\x99s work on fiction, which\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work was the equivalent to a week\xe2\x80\x99s work of the average\r\nsuccessful writer. The toil meant nothing to him. It was not toil. He\r\nwas finding speech, and all the beauty and wonder that had been pent\r\nfor years behind his inarticulate lips was now pouring forth in a wild\r\nand virile flood.\r\n\r\nHe showed the \xe2\x80\x9cSea Lyrics\xe2\x80\x9d to no one, not even to the editors. He had\r\nbecome distrustful of editors. But it was not distrust that prevented\r\nhim from submitting the \xe2\x80\x9cLyrics.\xe2\x80\x9d They were so beautiful to him that he\r\nwas impelled to save them to share with Ruth in some glorious, far-off\r\ntime when he would dare to read to her what he had written. Against\r\nthat time he kept them with him, reading them aloud, going over them\r\nuntil he knew them by heart.\r\n\r\nHe lived every moment of his waking hours, and he lived in his sleep,\r\nhis subjective mind rioting through his five hours of surcease and\r\ncombining the thoughts and events of the day into grotesque and\r\nimpossible marvels. In reality, he never rested, and a weaker body or a\r\nless firmly poised brain would have been prostrated in a general\r\nbreak-down. His late afternoon calls on Ruth were rarer now, for June\r\nwas approaching, when she would take her degree and finish with the\r\nuniversity. Bachelor of Arts!\xe2\x80\x94when he thought of her degree, it seemed\r\nshe fled beyond him faster than he could pursue.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon a week she gave to him, and arriving late, he usually\r\nstayed for dinner and for music afterward. Those were his red-letter\r\ndays. The atmosphere of the house, in such contrast with that in which\r\nhe lived, and the mere nearness to her, sent him forth each time with a\r\nfirmer grip on his resolve to climb the heights. In spite of the beauty\r\nin him, and the aching desire to create, it was for her that he\r\nstruggled. He was a lover first and always. All other things he\r\nsubordinated to love.\r\n\r\nGreater than his adventure in the world of thought was his\r\nlove-adventure. The world itself was not so amazing because of the\r\natoms and molecules that composed it according to the propulsions of\r\nirresistible force; what made it amazing was the fact that Ruth lived\r\nin it. She was the most amazing thing he had ever known, or dreamed, or\r\nguessed.\r\n\r\nBut he was oppressed always by her remoteness. She was so far from him,\r\nand he did not know how to approach her. He had been a success with\r\ngirls and women in his own class; but he had never loved any of them,\r\nwhile he did love her, and besides, she was not merely of another\r\nclass. His very love elevated her above all classes. She was a being\r\napart, so far apart that he did not know how to draw near to her as a\r\nlover should draw near. It was true, as he acquired knowledge and\r\nlanguage, that he was drawing nearer, talking her speech, discovering\r\nideas and delights in common; but this did not satisfy his lover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyearning. His lover\xe2\x80\x99s imagination had made her holy, too holy, too\r\nspiritualized, to have any kinship with him in the flesh. It was his\r\nown love that thrust her from him and made her seem impossible for him.\r\nLove itself denied him the one thing that it desired.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one day, without warning, the gulf between them was bridged\r\nfor a moment, and thereafter, though the gulf remained, it was ever\r\nnarrower. They had been eating cherries\xe2\x80\x94great, luscious, black cherries\r\nwith a juice of the color of dark wine. And later, as she read aloud to\r\nhim from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Princess,\xe2\x80\x9d he chanced to notice the stain of the cherries\r\non her lips. For the moment her divinity was shattered. She was clay,\r\nafter all, mere clay, subject to the common law of clay as his clay was\r\nsubject, or anybody\xe2\x80\x99s clay. Her lips were flesh like his, and cherries\r\ndyed them as cherries dyed his. And if so with her lips, then was it so\r\nwith all of her. She was woman, all woman, just like any woman. It came\r\nupon him abruptly. It was a revelation that stunned him. It was as if\r\nhe had seen the sun fall out of the sky, or had seen worshipped purity\r\npolluted.\r\n\r\nThen he realized the significance of it, and his heart began pounding\r\nand challenging him to play the lover with this woman who was not a\r\nspirit from other worlds but a mere woman with lips a cherry could\r\nstain. He trembled at the audacity of his thought; but all his soul was\r\nsinging, and reason, in a triumphant paean, assured him he was right.\r\nSomething of this change in him must have reached her, for she paused\r\nfrom her reading, looked up at him, and smiled. His eyes dropped from\r\nher blue eyes to her lips, and the sight of the stain maddened him. His\r\narms all but flashed out to her and around her, in the way of his old\r\ncareless life. She seemed to lean toward him, to wait, and all his will\r\nfought to hold him back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not following a word,\xe2\x80\x9d she pouted.\r\n\r\nThen she laughed at him, delighting in his confusion, and as he looked\r\ninto her frank eyes and knew that she had divined nothing of what he\r\nfelt, he became abashed. He had indeed in thought dared too far. Of all\r\nthe women he had known there was no woman who would not have\r\nguessed\xe2\x80\x94save her. And she had not guessed. There was the difference.\r\nShe was different. He was appalled by his own grossness, awed by her\r\nclear innocence, and he gazed again at her across the gulf. The bridge\r\nhad broken down.\r\n\r\nBut still the incident had brought him nearer. The memory of it\r\npersisted, and in the moments when he was most cast down, he dwelt upon\r\nit eagerly. The gulf was never again so wide. He had accomplished a\r\ndistance vastly greater than a bachelorship of arts, or a dozen\r\nbachelorships. She was pure, it was true, as he had never dreamed of\r\npurity; but cherries stained her lips. She was subject to the laws of\r\nthe universe just as inexorably as he was. She had to eat to live, and\r\nwhen she got her feet wet, she caught cold. But that was not the point.\r\nIf she could feel hunger and thirst, and heat and cold, then could she\r\nfeel love\xe2\x80\x94and love for a man. Well, he was a man. And why could he not\r\nbe the man? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s up to me to make good,\xe2\x80\x9d he would murmur fervently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill be _the_ man. I will make myself _the_ man. I will make good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly one evening, struggling with a sonnet that twisted all awry the\r\nbeauty and thought that trailed in glow and vapor through his brain,\r\nMartin was called to the telephone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lady\xe2\x80\x99s voice, a fine lady\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Higginbotham, who had called\r\nhim, jeered.\r\n\r\nMartin went to the telephone in the corner of the room, and felt a wave\r\nof warmth rush through him as he heard Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s voice. In his battle with\r\nthe sonnet he had forgotten her existence, and at the sound of her\r\nvoice his love for her smote him like a sudden blow. And such a\r\nvoice!\xe2\x80\x94delicate and sweet, like a strain of music heard far off and\r\nfaint, or, better, like a bell of silver, a perfect tone, crystal-pure.\r\nNo mere woman had a voice like that. There was something celestial\r\nabout it, and it came from other worlds. He could scarcely hear what it\r\nsaid, so ravished was he, though he controlled his face, for he knew\r\nthat Mr. Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s ferret eyes were fixed upon him.\r\n\r\nIt was not much that Ruth wanted to say\xe2\x80\x94merely that Norman had been\r\ngoing to take her to a lecture that night, but that he had a headache,\r\nand she was so disappointed, and she had the tickets, and that if he\r\nhad no other engagement, would he be good enough to take her?\r\n\r\nWould he! He fought to suppress the eagerness in his voice. It was\r\namazing. He had always seen her in her own house. And he had never\r\ndared to ask her to go anywhere with him. Quite irrelevantly, still at\r\nthe telephone and talking with her, he felt an overpowering desire to\r\ndie for her, and visions of heroic sacrifice shaped and dissolved in\r\nhis whirling brain. He loved her so much, so terribly, so hopelessly.\r\nIn that moment of mad happiness that she should go out with him, go to\r\na lecture with him\xe2\x80\x94with him, Martin Eden\xe2\x80\x94she soared so far above him\r\nthat there seemed nothing else for him to do than die for her. It was\r\nthe only fit way in which he could express the tremendous and lofty\r\nemotion he felt for her. It was the sublime abnegation of true love\r\nthat comes to all lovers, and it came to him there, at the telephone,\r\nin a whirlwind of fire and glory; and to die for her, he felt, was to\r\nhave lived and loved well. And he was only twenty-one, and he had never\r\nbeen in love before.\r\n\r\nHis hand trembled as he hung up the receiver, and he was weak from the\r\norgan which had stirred him. His eyes were shining like an angel\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nhis face was transfigured, purged of all earthly dross, and pure and\r\nholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMakin\xe2\x80\x99 dates outside, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d his brother-in-law sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what\r\nthat means. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the police court yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Martin could not come down from the height. Not even the bestiality\r\nof the allusion could bring him back to earth. Anger and hurt were\r\nbeneath him. He had seen a great vision and was as a god, and he could\r\nfeel only profound and awful pity for this maggot of a man. He did not\r\nlook at him, and though his eyes passed over him, he did not see him;\r\nand as in a dream he passed out of the room to dress. It was not until\r\nhe had reached his own room and was tying his necktie that he became\r\naware of a sound that lingered unpleasantly in his ears. On\r\ninvestigating this sound he identified it as the final snort of Bernard\r\nHigginbotham, which somehow had not penetrated to his brain before.\r\n\r\nAs Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s front door closed behind them and he came down the steps with\r\nher, he found himself greatly perturbed. It was not unalloyed bliss,\r\ntaking her to the lecture. He did not know what he ought to do. He had\r\nseen, on the streets, with persons of her class, that the women took\r\nthe men\xe2\x80\x99s arms. But then, again, he had seen them when they didn\xe2\x80\x99t; and\r\nhe wondered if it was only in the evening that arms were taken, or only\r\nbetween husbands and wives and relatives.\r\n\r\nJust before he reached the sidewalk, he remembered Minnie. Minnie had\r\nalways been a stickler. She had called him down the second time she\r\nwalked out with him, because he had gone along on the inside, and she\r\nhad laid the law down to him that a gentleman always walked on the\r\noutside\xe2\x80\x94when he was with a lady. And Minnie had made a practice of\r\nkicking his heels, whenever they crossed from one side of the street to\r\nthe other, to remind him to get over on the outside. He wondered where\r\nshe had got that item of etiquette, and whether it had filtered down\r\nfrom above and was all right.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do any harm to try it, he decided, by the time they had\r\nreached the sidewalk; and he swung behind Ruth and took up his station\r\non the outside. Then the other problem presented itself. Should he\r\noffer her his arm? He had never offered anybody his arm in his life.\r\nThe girls he had known never took the fellows\xe2\x80\x99 arms. For the first\r\nseveral times they walked freely, side by side, and after that it was\r\narms around the waists, and heads against the fellows\xe2\x80\x99 shoulders where\r\nthe streets were unlighted. But this was different. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\nkind of a girl. He must do something.\r\n\r\nHe crooked the arm next to her\xe2\x80\x94crooked it very slightly and with secret\r\ntentativeness, not invitingly, but just casually, as though he was\r\naccustomed to walk that way. And then the wonderful thing happened. He\r\nfelt her hand upon his arm. Delicious thrills ran through him at the\r\ncontact, and for a few sweet moments it seemed that he had left the\r\nsolid earth and was flying with her through the air. But he was soon\r\nback again, perturbed by a new complication. They were crossing the\r\nstreet. This would put him on the inside. He should be on the outside.\r\nShould he therefore drop her arm and change over? And if he did so,\r\nwould he have to repeat the manoeuvre the next time? And the next?\r\nThere was something wrong about it, and he resolved not to caper about\r\nand play the fool. Yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion, and\r\nwhen he found himself on the inside, he talked quickly and earnestly,\r\nmaking a show of being carried away by what he was saying, so that, in\r\ncase he was wrong in not changing sides, his enthusiasm would seem the\r\ncause for his carelessness.\r\n\r\nAs they crossed Broadway, he came face to face with a new problem. In\r\nthe blaze of the electric lights, he saw Lizzie Connolly and her giggly\r\nfriend. Only for an instant he hesitated, then his hand went up and his\r\nhat came off. He could not be disloyal to his kind, and it was to more\r\nthan Lizzie Connolly that his hat was lifted. She nodded and looked at\r\nhim boldly, not with soft and gentle eyes like Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s, but with eyes\r\nthat were handsome and hard, and that swept on past him to Ruth and\r\nitemized her face and dress and station. And he was aware that Ruth\r\nlooked, too, with quick eyes that were timid and mild as a dove\xe2\x80\x99s, but\r\nwhich saw, in a look that was a flutter on and past, the working-class\r\ngirl in her cheap finery and under the strange hat that all\r\nworking-class girls were wearing just then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pretty girl!\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth said a moment later.\r\n\r\nMartin could have blessed her, though he said:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s all a matter of personal taste, but she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t strike me as being particularly pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t one woman in ten thousand with features as regular as\r\nhers. They are splendid. Her face is as clear-cut as a cameo. And her\r\neyes are beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin queried absently, for to him there was only\r\none beautiful woman in the world, and she was beside him, her hand upon\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I think so? If that girl had proper opportunity to dress, Mr. Eden,\r\nand if she were taught how to carry herself, you would be fairly\r\ndazzled by her, and so would all men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would have to be taught how to speak,\xe2\x80\x9d he commented, \xe2\x80\x9cor else most\r\nof the men wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand her. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand a\r\nquarter of what she said if she just spoke naturally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! You are as bad as Arthur when you try to make your point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget how I talked when you first met me. I have learned a new\r\nlanguage since then. Before that time I talked as that girl talks. Now\r\nI can manage to make myself understood sufficiently in your language to\r\nexplain that you do not know that other girl\xe2\x80\x99s language. And do you\r\nknow why she carries herself the way she does? I think about such\r\nthings now, though I never used to think about them, and I am beginning\r\nto understand\xe2\x80\x94much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why does she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has worked long hours for years at machines. When one\xe2\x80\x99s body is\r\nyoung, it is very pliable, and hard work will mould it like putty\r\naccording to the nature of the work. I can tell at a glance the trades\r\nof many workingmen I meet on the street. Look at me. Why am I rolling\r\nall about the shop? Because of the years I put in on the sea. If I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nput in the same years cow-punching, with my body young and pliable, I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be rolling now, but I\xe2\x80\x99d be bow-legged. And so with that girl.\r\nYou noticed that her eyes were what I might call hard. She has never\r\nbeen sheltered. She has had to take care of herself, and a young girl\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t take care of herself and keep her eyes soft and gentle like\xe2\x80\x94like\r\nyours, for example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are right,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth said in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is too bad.\r\nShe is such a pretty girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her and saw her eyes luminous with pity. And then he\r\nremembered that he loved her and was lost in amazement at his fortune\r\nthat permitted him to love her and to take her on his arm to a lecture.\r\n\r\nWho are you, Martin Eden? he demanded of himself in the looking-glass,\r\nthat night when he got back to his room. He gazed at himself long and\r\ncuriously. Who are you? What are you? Where do you belong? You belong\r\nby rights to girls like Lizzie Connolly. You belong with the legions of\r\ntoil, with all that is low, and vulgar, and unbeautiful. You belong\r\nwith the oxen and the drudges, in dirty surroundings among smells and\r\nstenches. There are the stale vegetables now. Those potatoes are\r\nrotting. Smell them, damn you, smell them. And yet you dare to open the\r\nbooks, to listen to beautiful music, to learn to love beautiful\r\npaintings, to speak good English, to think thoughts that none of your\r\nown kind thinks, to tear yourself away from the oxen and the Lizzie\r\nConnollys and to love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles\r\nbeyond you and who lives in the stars! Who are you? and what are you?\r\ndamn you! And are you going to make good?\r\n\r\nHe shook his fist at himself in the glass, and sat down on the edge of\r\nthe bed to dream for a space with wide eyes. Then he got out note-book\r\nand algebra and lost himself in quadratic equations, while the hours\r\nslipped by, and the stars dimmed, and the gray of dawn flooded against\r\nhis window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the knot of wordy socialists and working-class philosophers that\r\nheld forth in the City Hall Park on warm afternoons that was\r\nresponsible for the great discovery. Once or twice in the month, while\r\nriding through the park on his way to the library, Martin dismounted\r\nfrom his wheel and listened to the arguments, and each time he tore\r\nhimself away reluctantly. The tone of discussion was much lower than at\r\nMr. Morse\xe2\x80\x99s table. The men were not grave and dignified. They lost\r\ntheir tempers easily and called one another names, while oaths and\r\nobscene allusions were frequent on their lips. Once or twice he had\r\nseen them come to blows. And yet, he knew not why, there seemed\r\nsomething vital about the stuff of these men\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. Their\r\nlogomachy was far more stimulating to his intellect than the reserved\r\nand quiet dogmatism of Mr. Morse. These men, who slaughtered English,\r\ngesticulated like lunatics, and fought one another\xe2\x80\x99s ideas with\r\nprimitive anger, seemed somehow to be more alive than Mr. Morse and his\r\ncrony, Mr. Butler.\r\n\r\nMartin had heard Herbert Spencer quoted several times in the park, but\r\none afternoon a disciple of Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s appeared, a seedy tramp with a\r\ndirty coat buttoned tightly at the throat to conceal the absence of a\r\nshirt. Battle royal was waged, amid the smoking of many cigarettes and\r\nthe expectoration of much tobacco-juice, wherein the tramp successfully\r\nheld his own, even when a socialist workman sneered, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no god\r\nbut the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is his prophet.\xe2\x80\x9d Martin was\r\npuzzled as to what the discussion was about, but when he rode on to the\r\nlibrary he carried with him a new-born interest in Herbert Spencer, and\r\nbecause of the frequency with which the tramp had mentioned \xe2\x80\x9cFirst\r\nPrinciples,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin drew out that volume.\r\n\r\nSo the great discovery began. Once before he had tried Spencer, and\r\nchoosing the \xe2\x80\x9cPrinciples of Psychology\xe2\x80\x9d to begin with, he had failed as\r\nabjectly as he had failed with Madam Blavatsky. There had been no\r\nunderstanding the book, and he had returned it unread. But this night,\r\nafter algebra and physics, and an attempt at a sonnet, he got into bed\r\nand opened \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Principles.\xe2\x80\x9d Morning found him still reading. It was\r\nimpossible for him to sleep. Nor did he write that day. He lay on the\r\nbed till his body grew tired, when he tried the hard floor, reading on\r\nhis back, the book held in the air above him, or changing from side to\r\nside. He slept that night, and did his writing next morning, and then\r\nthe book tempted him and he fell, reading all afternoon, oblivious to\r\neverything and oblivious to the fact that that was the afternoon Ruth\r\ngave to him. His first consciousness of the immediate world about him\r\nwas when Bernard Higginbotham jerked open the door and demanded to know\r\nif he thought they were running a restaurant.\r\n\r\nMartin Eden had been mastered by curiosity all his days. He wanted to\r\nknow, and it was this desire that had sent him adventuring over the\r\nworld. But he was now learning from Spencer that he never had known,\r\nand that he never could have known had he continued his sailing and\r\nwandering forever. He had merely skimmed over the surface of things,\r\nobserving detached phenomena, accumulating fragments of facts, making\r\nsuperficial little generalizations\xe2\x80\x94and all and everything quite\r\nunrelated in a capricious and disorderly world of whim and chance. The\r\nmechanism of the flight of birds he had watched and reasoned about with\r\nunderstanding; but it had never entered his head to try to explain the\r\nprocess whereby birds, as organic flying mechanisms, had been\r\ndeveloped. He had never dreamed there was such a process. That birds\r\nshould have come to be, was unguessed. They always had been. They just\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nAnd as it was with birds, so had it been with everything. His ignorant\r\nand unprepared attempts at philosophy had been fruitless. The medieval\r\nmetaphysics of Kant had given him the key to nothing, and had served\r\nthe sole purpose of making him doubt his own intellectual powers. In\r\nsimilar manner his attempt to study evolution had been confined to a\r\nhopelessly technical volume by Romanes. He had understood nothing, and\r\nthe only idea he had gathered was that evolution was a dry-as-dust\r\ntheory, of a lot of little men possessed of huge and unintelligible\r\nvocabularies. And now he learned that evolution was no mere theory but\r\nan accepted process of development; that scientists no longer disagreed\r\nabout it, their only differences being over the method of evolution.\r\n\r\nAnd here was the man Spencer, organizing all knowledge for him,\r\nreducing everything to unity, elaborating ultimate realities, and\r\npresenting to his startled gaze a universe so concrete of realization\r\nthat it was like the model of a ship such as sailors make and put into\r\nglass bottles. There was no caprice, no chance. All was law. It was in\r\nobedience to law that the bird flew, and it was in obedience to the\r\nsame law that fermenting slime had writhed and squirmed and put out\r\nlegs and wings and become a bird.\r\n\r\nMartin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living, and\r\nhere he was at a higher pitch than ever. All the hidden things were\r\nlaying their secrets bare. He was drunken with comprehension. At night,\r\nasleep, he lived with the gods in colossal nightmare; and awake, in the\r\nday, he went around like a somnambulist, with absent stare, gazing upon\r\nthe world he had just discovered. At table he failed to hear the\r\nconversation about petty and ignoble things, his eager mind seeking out\r\nand following cause and effect in everything before him. In the meat on\r\nthe platter he saw the shining sun and traced its energy back through\r\nall its transformations to its source a hundred million miles away, or\r\ntraced its energy ahead to the moving muscles in his arms that enabled\r\nhim to cut the meat, and to the brain wherewith he willed the muscles\r\nto move to cut the meat, until, with inward gaze, he saw the same sun\r\nshining in his brain. He was entranced by illumination, and did not\r\nhear the \xe2\x80\x9cBughouse,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered by Jim, nor see the anxiety on his\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s face, nor notice the rotary motion of Bernard Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinger, whereby he imparted the suggestion of wheels revolving in his\r\nbrother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\nWhat, in a way, most profoundly impressed Martin, was the correlation\r\nof knowledge\xe2\x80\x94of all knowledge. He had been curious to know things, and\r\nwhatever he acquired he had filed away in separate memory compartments\r\nin his brain. Thus, on the subject of sailing he had an immense store.\r\nOn the subject of woman he had a fairly large store. But these two\r\nsubjects had been unrelated. Between the two memory compartments there\r\nhad been no connection. That, in the fabric of knowledge, there should\r\nbe any connection whatever between a woman with hysterics and a\r\nschooner carrying a weather-helm or heaving to in a gale, would have\r\nstruck him as ridiculous and impossible. But Herbert Spencer had shown\r\nhim not only that it was not ridiculous, but that it was impossible for\r\nthere to be no connection. All things were related to all other things\r\nfrom the farthermost star in the wastes of space to the myriads of\r\natoms in the grain of sand under one\xe2\x80\x99s foot. This new concept was a\r\nperpetual amazement to Martin, and he found himself engaged continually\r\nin tracing the relationship between all things under the sun and on the\r\nother side of the sun. He drew up lists of the most incongruous things\r\nand was unhappy until he succeeded in establishing kinship between them\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94kinship between love, poetry, earthquake, fire, rattlesnakes,\r\nrainbows, precious gems, monstrosities, sunsets, the roaring of lions,\r\nilluminating gas, cannibalism, beauty, murder, lovers, fulcrums, and\r\ntobacco. Thus, he unified the universe and held it up and looked at it,\r\nor wandered through its byways and alleys and jungles, not as a\r\nterrified traveller in the thick of mysteries seeking an unknown goal,\r\nbut observing and charting and becoming familiar with all there was to\r\nknow. And the more he knew, the more passionately he admired the\r\nuniverse, and life, and his own life in the midst of it all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fool!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried at his image in the looking-glass. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted to\r\nwrite, and you tried to write, and you had nothing in you to write\r\nabout. What did you have in you?\xe2\x80\x94some childish notions, a few\r\nhalf-baked sentiments, a lot of undigested beauty, a great black mass\r\nof ignorance, a heart filled to bursting with love, and an ambition as\r\nbig as your love and as futile as your ignorance. And you wanted to\r\nwrite! Why, you\xe2\x80\x99re just on the edge of beginning to get something in\r\nyou to write about. You wanted to create beauty, but how could you when\r\nyou knew nothing about the nature of beauty? You wanted to write about\r\nlife when you knew nothing of the essential characteristics of life.\r\nYou wanted to write about the world and the scheme of existence when\r\nthe world was a Chinese puzzle to you and all that you could have\r\nwritten would have been about what you did not know of the scheme of\r\nexistence. But cheer up, Martin, my boy. You\xe2\x80\x99ll write yet. You know a\r\nlittle, a very little, and you\xe2\x80\x99re on the right road now to know more.\r\nSome day, if you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky, you may come pretty close to knowing all\r\nthat may be known. Then you will write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe brought his great discovery to Ruth, sharing with her all his joy\r\nand wonder in it. But she did not seem to be so enthusiastic over it.\r\nShe tacitly accepted it and, in a way, seemed aware of it from her own\r\nstudies. It did not stir her deeply, as it did him, and he would have\r\nbeen surprised had he not reasoned it out that it was not new and fresh\r\nto her as it was to him. Arthur and Norman, he found, believed in\r\nevolution and had read Spencer, though it did not seem to have made any\r\nvital impression upon them, while the young fellow with the glasses and\r\nthe mop of hair, Will Olney, sneered disagreeably at Spencer and\r\nrepeated the epigram, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert\r\nSpencer is his prophet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Martin forgave him the sneer, for he had begun to discover that\r\nOlney was not in love with Ruth. Later, he was dumfounded to learn from\r\nvarious little happenings not only that Olney did not care for Ruth,\r\nbut that he had a positive dislike for her. Martin could not understand\r\nthis. It was a bit of phenomena that he could not correlate with all\r\nthe rest of the phenomena in the universe. But nevertheless he felt\r\nsorry for the young fellow because of the great lack in his nature that\r\nprevented him from a proper appreciation of Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s fineness and beauty.\r\nThey rode out into the hills several Sundays on their wheels, and\r\nMartin had ample opportunity to observe the armed truce that existed\r\nbetween Ruth and Olney. The latter chummed with Norman, throwing Arthur\r\nand Martin into company with Ruth, for which Martin was duly grateful.\r\n\r\nThose Sundays were great days for Martin, greatest because he was with\r\nRuth, and great, also, because they were putting him more on a par with\r\nthe young men of her class. In spite of their long years of disciplined\r\neducation, he was finding himself their intellectual equal, and the\r\nhours spent with them in conversation was so much practice for him in\r\nthe use of the grammar he had studied so hard. He had abandoned the\r\netiquette books, falling back upon observation to show him the right\r\nthings to do. Except when carried away by his enthusiasm, he was always\r\non guard, keenly watchful of their actions and learning their little\r\ncourtesies and refinements of conduct.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Spencer was very little read was for some time a source\r\nof surprise to Martin. \xe2\x80\x9cHerbert Spencer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man at the desk in\r\nthe library, \xe2\x80\x9coh, yes, a great mind.\xe2\x80\x9d But the man did not seem to know\r\nanything of the content of that great mind. One evening, at dinner,\r\nwhen Mr. Butler was there, Martin turned the conversation upon Spencer.\r\nMr. Morse bitterly arraigned the English philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s agnosticism, but\r\nconfessed that he had not read \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Principles\xe2\x80\x9d; while Mr. Butler\r\nstated that he had no patience with Spencer, had never read a line of\r\nhim, and had managed to get along quite well without him. Doubts arose\r\nin Martin\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and had he been less strongly individual he would\r\nhave accepted the general opinion and given Herbert Spencer up. As it\r\nwas, he found Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of things convincing; and, as he\r\nphrased it to himself, to give up Spencer would be equivalent to a\r\nnavigator throwing the compass and chronometer overboard. So Martin\r\nwent on into a thorough study of evolution, mastering more and more the\r\nsubject himself, and being convinced by the corroborative testimony of\r\na thousand independent writers. The more he studied, the more vistas he\r\ncaught of fields of knowledge yet unexplored, and the regret that days\r\nwere only twenty-four hours long became a chronic complaint with him.\r\n\r\nOne day, because the days were so short, he decided to give up algebra\r\nand geometry. Trigonometry he had not even attempted. Then he cut\r\nchemistry from his study-list, retaining only physics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a specialist,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in defence, to Ruth. \xe2\x80\x9cNor am I going\r\nto try to be a specialist. There are too many special fields for any\r\none man, in a whole lifetime, to master a tithe of them. I must pursue\r\ngeneral knowledge. When I need the work of specialists, I shall refer\r\nto their books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not like having the knowledge yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is unnecessary to have it. We profit from the work of the\r\nspecialists. That\xe2\x80\x99s what they are for. When I came in, I noticed the\r\nchimney-sweeps at work. They\xe2\x80\x99re specialists, and when they get done,\r\nyou will enjoy clean chimneys without knowing anything about the\r\nconstruction of chimneys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s far-fetched, I am afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him curiously, and he felt a reproach in her gaze and\r\nmanner. But he was convinced of the rightness of his position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll thinkers on general subjects, the greatest minds in the world, in\r\nfact, rely on the specialists. Herbert Spencer did that. He generalized\r\nupon the findings of thousands of investigators. He would have had to\r\nlive a thousand lives in order to do it all himself. And so with\r\nDarwin. He took advantage of all that had been learned by the florists\r\nand cattle-breeders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right, Martin,\xe2\x80\x9d Olney said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what you\xe2\x80\x99re after, and\r\nRuth doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what she is after for herself even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Oh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Olney rushed on, heading off her objection, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you\r\ncall it general culture. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what you study if you\r\nwant general culture. You can study French, or you can study German, or\r\ncut them both out and study Esperanto, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get the culture tone just\r\nthe same. You can study Greek or Latin, too, for the same purpose,\r\nthough it will never be any use to you. It will be culture, though.\r\nWhy, Ruth studied Saxon, became clever in it,\xe2\x80\x94that was two years\r\nago,\xe2\x80\x94and all that she remembers of it now is \xe2\x80\x98Whan that sweet Aprile\r\nwith his schowers soote\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the way it goes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s given you the culture tone just the same,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, again\r\nheading her off. \xe2\x80\x9cI know. We were in the same classes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you speak of culture as if it should be a means to something,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRuth cried out. Her eyes were flashing, and in her cheeks were two\r\nspots of color. \xe2\x80\x9cCulture is the end in itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not what Martin wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, Martin?\xe2\x80\x9d Olney demanded, turning squarely upon him.\r\n\r\nMartin felt very uncomfortable, and looked entreaty at Ruth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will settle it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course, I want culture,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cI love beauty, and\r\nculture will give me a finer and keener appreciation of beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head and looked triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot, and you know it,\xe2\x80\x9d was Olney\xe2\x80\x99s comment. \xe2\x80\x9cMartin\xe2\x80\x99s after career,\r\nnot culture. It just happens that culture, in his case, is incidental\r\nto career. If he wanted to be a chemist, culture would be unnecessary.\r\nMartin wants to write, but he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid to say so because it will put\r\nyou in the wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why does Martin want to write?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause he isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrolling in wealth. Why do you fill your head with Saxon and general\r\nculture? Because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to make your way in the world. Your\r\nfather sees to that. He buys your clothes for you, and all the rest.\r\nWhat rotten good is our education, yours and mine and Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nNorman\xe2\x80\x99s? We\xe2\x80\x99re soaked in general culture, and if our daddies went\r\nbroke to-day, we\xe2\x80\x99d be falling down to-morrow on teachers\xe2\x80\x99 examinations.\r\nThe best job you could get, Ruth, would be a country school or music\r\nteacher in a girls\xe2\x80\x99 boarding-school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray what would you do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a blessed thing. I could earn a dollar and a half a day, common\r\nlabor, and I might get in as instructor in Hanley\xe2\x80\x99s cramming joint\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsay might, mind you, and I might be chucked out at the end of the week\r\nfor sheer inability.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin followed the discussion closely, and while he was convinced that\r\nOlney was right, he resented the rather cavalier treatment he accorded\r\nRuth. A new conception of love formed in his mind as he listened.\r\nReason had nothing to do with love. It mattered not whether the woman\r\nhe loved reasoned correctly or incorrectly. Love was above reason. If\r\nit just happened that she did not fully appreciate his necessity for a\r\ncareer, that did not make her a bit less lovable. She was all lovable,\r\nand what she thought had nothing to do with her lovableness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied to a question from Olney that broke in upon\r\nhis train of thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was saying that I hoped you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be fool enough to tackle\r\nLatin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Latin is more than culture,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth broke in. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is equipment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you going to tackle it?\xe2\x80\x9d Olney persisted.\r\n\r\nMartin was sore beset. He could see that Ruth was hanging eagerly upon\r\nhis answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I won\xe2\x80\x99t have time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to, but I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Martin\xe2\x80\x99s not seeking culture,\xe2\x80\x9d Olney exulted. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s trying to\r\nget somewhere, to do something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but it\xe2\x80\x99s mental training. It\xe2\x80\x99s mind discipline. It\xe2\x80\x99s what makes\r\ndisciplined minds.\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth looked expectantly at Martin, as if waiting\r\nfor him to change his judgment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, the foot-ball players have\r\nto train before the big game. And that is what Latin does for the\r\nthinker. It trains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot and bosh! That\xe2\x80\x99s what they told us when we were kids. But there is\r\none thing they didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us then. They let us find it out for\r\nourselves afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d Olney paused for effect, then added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\r\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us was that every gentleman should have studied Latin,\r\nbut that no gentleman should know Latin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that\xe2\x80\x99s unfair,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you were turning the\r\nconversation just in order to get off something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s clever all right,\xe2\x80\x9d was the retort, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s fair, too. The only\r\nmen who know their Latin are the apothecaries, the lawyers, and the\r\nLatin professors. And if Martin wants to be one of them, I miss my\r\nguess. But what\xe2\x80\x99s all that got to do with Herbert Spencer anyway?\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s just discovered Spencer, and he\xe2\x80\x99s wild over him. Why? Because\r\nSpencer is taking him somewhere. Spencer couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take me anywhere, nor\r\nyou. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t got anywhere to go. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get married some day, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have nothing to do but keep track of the lawyers and business\r\nagents who will take care of the money my father\xe2\x80\x99s going to leave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnley got up to go, but turned at the door and delivered a parting\r\nshot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou leave Martin alone, Ruth. He knows what\xe2\x80\x99s best for himself. Look\r\nat what he\xe2\x80\x99s done already. He makes me sick sometimes, sick and ashamed\r\nof myself. He knows more now about the world, and life, and man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace, and all the rest, than Arthur, or Norman, or I, or you, too, for\r\nthat matter, and in spite of all our Latin, and French, and Saxon, and\r\nculture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Ruth is my teacher,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered chivalrously. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\r\nresponsible for what little I have learned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRats!\xe2\x80\x9d Olney looked at Ruth, and his expression was malicious. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll be telling me next that you read Spencer on her\r\nrecommendation\xe2\x80\x94only you didn\xe2\x80\x99t. And she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything more\r\nabout Darwin and evolution than I do about King Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s mines. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat jawbreaker definition about something or other, of Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s, that\r\nyou sprang on us the other day\xe2\x80\x94that indefinite, incoherent homogeneity\r\nthing? Spring it on her, and see if she understands a word of it. That\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t culture, you see. Well, tra la, and if you tackle Latin, Martin,\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t have any respect for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd all the while, interested in the discussion, Martin had been aware\r\nof an irk in it as well. It was about studies and lessons, dealing with\r\nthe rudiments of knowledge, and the schoolboyish tone of it conflicted\r\nwith the big things that were stirring in him\xe2\x80\x94with the grip upon life\r\nthat was even then crooking his fingers like eagle\xe2\x80\x99s talons, with the\r\ncosmic thrills that made him ache, and with the inchoate consciousness\r\nof mastery of it all. He likened himself to a poet, wrecked on the\r\nshores of a strange land, filled with power of beauty, stumbling and\r\nstammering and vainly trying to sing in the rough, barbaric tongue of\r\nhis brethren in the new land. And so with him. He was alive, painfully\r\nalive, to the great universal things, and yet he was compelled to\r\npotter and grope among schoolboy topics and debate whether or not he\r\nshould study Latin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in hell has Latin to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded before his mirror\r\nthat night. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish dead people would stay dead. Why should I and the\r\nbeauty in me be ruled by the dead? Beauty is alive and everlasting.\r\nLanguages come and go. They are the dust of the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd his next thought was that he had been phrasing his ideas very well,\r\nand he went to bed wondering why he could not talk in similar fashion\r\nwhen he was with Ruth. He was only a schoolboy, with a schoolboy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntongue, when he was in her presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly give me time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTime! Time! Time! was his unending plaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not because of Olney, but in spite of Ruth, and his love for\r\nRuth, that he finally decided not to take up Latin. His money meant\r\ntime. There was so much that was more important than Latin, so many\r\nstudies that clamored with imperious voices. And he must write. He must\r\nearn money. He had had no acceptances. Twoscore of manuscripts were\r\ntravelling the endless round of the magazines. How did the others do\r\nit? He spent long hours in the free reading-room, going over what\r\nothers had written, studying their work eagerly and critically,\r\ncomparing it with his own, and wondering, wondering, about the secret\r\ntrick they had discovered which enabled them to sell their work.\r\n\r\nHe was amazed at the immense amount of printed stuff that was dead. No\r\nlight, no life, no color, was shot through it. There was no breath of\r\nlife in it, and yet it sold, at two cents a word, twenty dollars a\r\nthousand\xe2\x80\x94the newspaper clipping had said so. He was puzzled by\r\ncountless short stories, written lightly and cleverly he confessed, but\r\nwithout vitality or reality. Life was so strange and wonderful, filled\r\nwith an immensity of problems, of dreams, and of heroic toils, and yet\r\nthese stories dealt only with the commonplaces of life. He felt the\r\nstress and strain of life, its fevers and sweats and wild\r\ninsurgences\xe2\x80\x94surely this was the stuff to write about! He wanted to\r\nglorify the leaders of forlorn hopes, the mad lovers, the giants that\r\nfought under stress and strain, amid terror and tragedy, making life\r\ncrackle with the strength of their endeavor. And yet the magazine short\r\nstories seemed intent on glorifying the Mr. Butlers, the sordid\r\ndollar-chasers, and the commonplace little love affairs of commonplace\r\nlittle men and women. Was it because the editors of the magazines were\r\ncommonplace? he demanded. Or were they afraid of life, these writers\r\nand editors and readers?\r\n\r\nBut his chief trouble was that he did not know any editors or writers.\r\nAnd not merely did he not know any writers, but he did not know anybody\r\nwho had ever attempted to write. There was nobody to tell him, to hint\r\nto him, to give him the least word of advice. He began to doubt that\r\neditors were real men. They seemed cogs in a machine. That was what it\r\nwas, a machine. He poured his soul into stories, articles, and poems,\r\nand intrusted them to the machine. He folded them just so, put the\r\nproper stamps inside the long envelope along with the manuscript,\r\nsealed the envelope, put more stamps outside, and dropped it into the\r\nmail-box. It travelled across the continent, and after a certain lapse\r\nof time the postman returned him the manuscript in another long\r\nenvelope, on the outside of which were the stamps he had enclosed.\r\nThere was no human editor at the other end, but a mere cunning\r\narrangement of cogs that changed the manuscript from one envelope to\r\nanother and stuck on the stamps. It was like the slot machines wherein\r\none dropped pennies, and, with a metallic whirl of machinery had\r\ndelivered to him a stick of chewing-gum or a tablet of chocolate. It\r\ndepended upon which slot one dropped the penny in, whether he got\r\nchocolate or gum. And so with the editorial machine. One slot brought\r\nchecks and the other brought rejection slips. So far he had found only\r\nthe latter slot.\r\n\r\nIt was the rejection slips that completed the horrible machinelikeness\r\nof the process. These slips were printed in stereotyped forms and he\r\nhad received hundreds of them\xe2\x80\x94as many as a dozen or more on each of his\r\nearlier manuscripts. If he had received one line, one personal line,\r\nalong with one rejection of all his rejections, he would have been\r\ncheered. But not one editor had given that proof of existence. And he\r\ncould conclude only that there were no warm human men at the other end,\r\nonly mere cogs, well oiled and running beautifully in the machine.\r\n\r\nHe was a good fighter, whole-souled and stubborn, and he would have\r\nbeen content to continue feeding the machine for years; but he was\r\nbleeding to death, and not years but weeks would determine the fight.\r\nEach week his board bill brought him nearer destruction, while the\r\npostage on forty manuscripts bled him almost as severely. He no longer\r\nbought books, and he economized in petty ways and sought to delay the\r\ninevitable end; though he did not know how to economize, and brought\r\nthe end nearer by a week when he gave his sister Marian five dollars\r\nfor a dress.\r\n\r\nHe struggled in the dark, without advice, without encouragement, and in\r\nthe teeth of discouragement. Even Gertrude was beginning to look\r\naskance. At first she had tolerated with sisterly fondness what she\r\nconceived to be his foolishness; but now, out of sisterly solicitude,\r\nshe grew anxious. To her it seemed that his foolishness was becoming a\r\nmadness. Martin knew this and suffered more keenly from it than from\r\nthe open and nagging contempt of Bernard Higginbotham. Martin had faith\r\nin himself, but he was alone in this faith. Not even Ruth had faith.\r\nShe had wanted him to devote himself to study, and, though she had not\r\nopenly disapproved of his writing, she had never approved.\r\n\r\nHe had never offered to show her his work. A fastidious delicacy had\r\nprevented him. Besides, she had been studying heavily at the\r\nuniversity, and he felt averse to robbing her of her time. But when she\r\nhad taken her degree, she asked him herself to let her see something of\r\nwhat he had been doing. Martin was elated and diffident. Here was a\r\njudge. She was a bachelor of arts. She had studied literature under\r\nskilled instructors. Perhaps the editors were capable judges, too. But\r\nshe would be different from them. She would not hand him a stereotyped\r\nrejection slip, nor would she inform him that lack of preference for\r\nhis work did not necessarily imply lack of merit in his work. She would\r\ntalk, a warm human being, in her quick, bright way, and, most important\r\nof all, she would catch glimpses of the real Martin Eden. In his work\r\nshe would discern what his heart and soul were like, and she would come\r\nto understand something, a little something, of the stuff of his dreams\r\nand the strength of his power.\r\n\r\nMartin gathered together a number of carbon copies of his short\r\nstories, hesitated a moment, then added his \xe2\x80\x9cSea Lyrics.\xe2\x80\x9d They mounted\r\ntheir wheels on a late June afternoon and rode for the hills. It was\r\nthe second time he had been out with her alone, and as they rode along\r\nthrough the balmy warmth, just chilled by she sea-breeze to refreshing\r\ncoolness, he was profoundly impressed by the fact that it was a very\r\nbeautiful and well-ordered world and that it was good to be alive and\r\nto love. They left their wheels by the roadside and climbed to the\r\nbrown top of an open knoll where the sunburnt grass breathed a harvest\r\nbreath of dry sweetness and content.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIts work is done,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, as they seated themselves, she upon\r\nhis coat, and he sprawling close to the warm earth. He sniffed the\r\nsweetness of the tawny grass, which entered his brain and set his\r\nthoughts whirling on from the particular to the universal. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has\r\nachieved its reason for existence,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, patting the dry grass\r\naffectionately. \xe2\x80\x9cIt quickened with ambition under the dreary downpour\r\nof last winter, fought the violent early spring, flowered, and lured\r\nthe insects and the bees, scattered its seeds, squared itself with its\r\nduty and the world, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you always look at things with such dreadfully practical eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve been studying evolution, I guess. It\xe2\x80\x99s only recently that\r\nI got my eyesight, if the truth were told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it seems to me you lose sight of beauty by being so practical,\r\nthat you destroy beauty like the boys who catch butterflies and rub the\r\ndown off their beautiful wings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeauty has significance, but I never knew its significance before. I\r\njust accepted beauty as something meaningless, as something that was\r\njust beautiful without rhyme or reason. I did not know anything about\r\nbeauty. But now I know, or, rather, am just beginning to know. This\r\ngrass is more beautiful to me now that I know why it is grass, and all\r\nthe hidden chemistry of sun and rain and earth that makes it become\r\ngrass. Why, there is romance in the life-history of any grass, yes, and\r\nadventure, too. The very thought of it stirs me. When I think of the\r\nplay of force and matter, and all the tremendous struggle of it, I feel\r\nas if I could write an epic on the grass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow well you talk,\xe2\x80\x9d she said absently, and he noted that she was\r\nlooking at him in a searching way.\r\n\r\nHe was all confusion and embarrassment on the instant, the blood\r\nflushing red on his neck and brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I am learning to talk,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere seems to be so\r\nmuch in me I want to say. But it is all so big. I can\xe2\x80\x99t find ways to\r\nsay what is really in me. Sometimes it seems to me that all the world,\r\nall life, everything, had taken up residence inside of me and was\r\nclamoring for me to be the spokesman. I feel\xe2\x80\x94oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t describe it\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nfeel the bigness of it, but when I speak, I babble like a little child.\r\nIt is a great task to transmute feeling and sensation into speech,\r\nwritten or spoken, that will, in turn, in him who reads or listens,\r\ntransmute itself back into the selfsame feeling and sensation. It is a\r\nlordly task. See, I bury my face in the grass, and the breath I draw in\r\nthrough my nostrils sets me quivering with a thousand thoughts and\r\nfancies. It is a breath of the universe I have breathed. I know song\r\nand laughter, and success and pain, and struggle and death; and I see\r\nvisions that arise in my brain somehow out of the scent of the grass,\r\nand I would like to tell them to you, to the world. But how can I? My\r\ntongue is tied. I have tried, by the spoken word, just now, to describe\r\nto you the effect on me of the scent of the grass. But I have not\r\nsucceeded. I have no more than hinted in awkward speech. My words seem\r\ngibberish to me. And yet I am stifled with desire to tell. Oh!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthrew up his hands with a despairing gesture\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit is impossible! It is\r\nnot understandable! It is incommunicable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you do talk well,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cJust think how you have improved\r\nin the short time I have known you. Mr. Butler is a noted public\r\nspeaker. He is always asked by the State Committee to go out on stump\r\nduring campaign. Yet you talked just as well as he the other night at\r\ndinner. Only he was more controlled. You get too excited; but you will\r\nget over that with practice. Why, you would make a good public speaker.\r\nYou can go far\xe2\x80\x94if you want to. You are masterly. You can lead men, I am\r\nsure, and there is no reason why you should not succeed at anything you\r\nset your hand to, just as you have succeeded with grammar. You would\r\nmake a good lawyer. You should shine in politics. There is nothing to\r\nprevent you from making as great a success as Mr. Butler has made. And\r\nminus the dyspepsia,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a smile.\r\n\r\nThey talked on; she, in her gently persistent way, returning always to\r\nthe need of thorough grounding in education and to the advantages of\r\nLatin as part of the foundation for any career. She drew her ideal of\r\nthe successful man, and it was largely in her father\xe2\x80\x99s image, with a\r\nfew unmistakable lines and touches of color from the image of Mr.\r\nButler. He listened eagerly, with receptive ears, lying on his back and\r\nlooking up and joying in each movement of her lips as she talked. But\r\nhis brain was not receptive. There was nothing alluring in the pictures\r\nshe drew, and he was aware of a dull pain of disappointment and of a\r\nsharper ache of love for her. In all she said there was no mention of\r\nhis writing, and the manuscripts he had brought to read lay neglected\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\nAt last, in a pause, he glanced at the sun, measured its height above\r\nthe horizon, and suggested his manuscripts by picking them up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am so anxious to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read to her a story, one that he flattered himself was among his\r\nvery best. He called it \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wine of Life,\xe2\x80\x9d and the wine of it, that\r\nhad stolen into his brain when he wrote it, stole into his brain now as\r\nhe read it. There was a certain magic in the original conception, and\r\nhe had adorned it with more magic of phrase and touch. All the old fire\r\nand passion with which he had written it were reborn in him, and he was\r\nswayed and swept away so that he was blind and deaf to the faults of\r\nit. But it was not so with Ruth. Her trained ear detected the\r\nweaknesses and exaggerations, the overemphasis of the tyro, and she was\r\ninstantly aware each time the sentence-rhythm tripped and faltered. She\r\nscarcely noted the rhythm otherwise, except when it became too pompous,\r\nat which moments she was disagreeably impressed with its\r\namateurishness. That was her final judgment on the story as a\r\nwhole\xe2\x80\x94amateurish, though she did not tell him so. Instead, when he had\r\ndone, she pointed out the minor flaws and said that she liked the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nBut he was disappointed. Her criticism was just. He acknowledged that,\r\nbut he had a feeling that he was not sharing his work with her for the\r\npurpose of schoolroom correction. The details did not matter. They\r\ncould take care of themselves. He could mend them, he could learn to\r\nmend them. Out of life he had captured something big and attempted to\r\nimprison it in the story. It was the big thing out of life he had read\r\nto her, not sentence-structure and semicolons. He wanted her to feel\r\nwith him this big thing that was his, that he had seen with his own\r\neyes, grappled with his own brain, and placed there on the page with\r\nhis own hands in printed words. Well, he had failed, was his secret\r\ndecision. Perhaps the editors were right. He had felt the big thing,\r\nbut he had failed to transmute it. He concealed his disappointment, and\r\njoined so easily with her in her criticism that she did not realize\r\nthat deep down in him was running a strong undercurrent of\r\ndisagreement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis next thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve called \xe2\x80\x98The Pot\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, unfolding the\r\nmanuscript. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been refused by four or five magazines now, but\r\nstill I think it is good. In fact, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think of it,\r\nexcept that I\xe2\x80\x99ve caught something there. Maybe it won\xe2\x80\x99t affect you as\r\nit does me. It\xe2\x80\x99s a short thing\xe2\x80\x94only two thousand words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, when he had finished. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is horrible,\r\nunutterably horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe noted her pale face, her eyes wide and tense, and her clenched\r\nhands, with secret satisfaction. He had succeeded. He had communicated\r\nthe stuff of fancy and feeling from out of his brain. It had struck\r\nhome. No matter whether she liked it or not, it had gripped her and\r\nmastered her, made her sit there and listen and forget details.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand life is not always beautiful. And yet,\r\nperhaps because I am strangely made, I find something beautiful there.\r\nIt seems to me that the beauty is tenfold enhanced because it is\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the poor woman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she broke in disconnectedly. Then\r\nshe left the revolt of her thought unexpressed to cry out: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! It is\r\ndegrading! It is not nice! It is nasty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the moment it seemed to him that his heart stood still. _Nasty_! He\r\nhad never dreamed it. He had not meant it. The whole sketch stood\r\nbefore him in letters of fire, and in such blaze of illumination he\r\nsought vainly for nastiness. Then his heart began to beat again. He was\r\nnot guilty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you select a nice subject?\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know there\r\nare nasty things in the world, but that is no reason\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe talked on in her indignant strain, but he was not following her. He\r\nwas smiling to himself as he looked up into her virginal face, so\r\ninnocent, so penetratingly innocent, that its purity seemed always to\r\nenter into him, driving out of him all dross and bathing him in some\r\nethereal effulgence that was as cool and soft and velvety as starshine.\r\n_We know there are nasty things in the world_! He cuddled to him the\r\nnotion of her knowing, and chuckled over it as a love joke. The next\r\nmoment, in a flashing vision of multitudinous detail, he sighted the\r\nwhole sea of life\xe2\x80\x99s nastiness that he had known and voyaged over and\r\nthrough, and he forgave her for not understanding the story. It was\r\nthrough no fault of hers that she could not understand. He thanked God\r\nthat she had been born and sheltered to such innocence. But he knew\r\nlife, its foulness as well as its fairness, its greatness in spite of\r\nthe slime that infested it, and by God he was going to have his say on\r\nit to the world. Saints in heaven\xe2\x80\x94how could they be anything but fair\r\nand pure? No praise to them. But saints in slime\xe2\x80\x94ah, that was the\r\neverlasting wonder! That was what made life worth while. To see moral\r\ngrandeur rising out of cesspools of iniquity; to rise himself and first\r\nglimpse beauty, faint and far, through mud-dripping eyes; to see out of\r\nweakness, and frailty, and viciousness, and all abysmal brutishness,\r\narising strength, and truth, and high spiritual endowment\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe caught a stray sequence of sentences she was uttering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tone of it all is low. And there is so much that is high. Take \xe2\x80\x98In\r\nMemoriam.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was impelled to suggest \xe2\x80\x9cLocksley Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d and would have done so, had\r\nnot his vision gripped him again and left him staring at her, the\r\nfemale of his kind, who, out of the primordial ferment, creeping and\r\ncrawling up the vast ladder of life for a thousand thousand centuries,\r\nhad emerged on the topmost rung, having become one Ruth, pure, and\r\nfair, and divine, and with power to make him know love, and to aspire\r\ntoward purity, and to desire to taste divinity\xe2\x80\x94him, Martin Eden, who,\r\ntoo, had come up in some amazing fashion from out of the ruck and the\r\nmire and the countless mistakes and abortions of unending creation.\r\nThere was the romance, and the wonder, and the glory. There was the\r\nstuff to write, if he could only find speech. Saints in heaven!\xe2\x80\x94They\r\nwere only saints and could not help themselves. But he was a man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have strength,\xe2\x80\x9d he could hear her saying, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is untutored\r\nstrength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a bull in a china shop,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested, and won a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you must develop discrimination. You must consult taste, and\r\nfineness, and tone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare too much,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\r\n\r\nShe smiled approbation, and settled herself to listen to another story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99ll make of this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said apologetically. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na funny thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I got beyond my depth in it, but my\r\nintentions were good. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother about the little features of it.\r\nJust see if you catch the feel of the big thing in it. It is big, and\r\nit is true, though the chance is large that I have failed to make it\r\nintelligible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read, and as he read he watched her. At last he had reached her, he\r\nthought. She sat without movement, her eyes steadfast upon him,\r\nscarcely breathing, caught up and out of herself, he thought, by the\r\nwitchery of the thing he had created. He had entitled the story\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdventure,\xe2\x80\x9d and it was the apotheosis of adventure\xe2\x80\x94not of the\r\nadventure of the storybooks, but of real adventure, the savage\r\ntaskmaster, awful of punishment and awful of reward, faithless and\r\nwhimsical, demanding terrible patience and heartbreaking days and\r\nnights of toil, offering the blazing sunlight glory or dark death at\r\nthe end of thirst and famine or of the long drag and monstrous delirium\r\nof rotting fever, through blood and sweat and stinging insects leading\r\nup by long chains of petty and ignoble contacts to royal culminations\r\nand lordly achievements.\r\n\r\nIt was this, all of it, and more, that he had put into his story, and\r\nit was this, he believed, that warmed her as she sat and listened. Her\r\neyes were wide, color was in her pale cheeks, and before he finished it\r\nseemed to him that she was almost panting. Truly, she was warmed; but\r\nshe was warmed, not by the story, but by him. She did not think much of\r\nthe story; it was Martin\xe2\x80\x99s intensity of power, the old excess of\r\nstrength that seemed to pour from his body and on and over her. The\r\nparadox of it was that it was the story itself that was freighted with\r\nhis power, that was the channel, for the time being, through which his\r\nstrength poured out to her. She was aware only of the strength, and not\r\nof the medium, and when she seemed most carried away by what he had\r\nwritten, in reality she had been carried away by something quite\r\nforeign to it\xe2\x80\x94by a thought, terrible and perilous, that had formed\r\nitself unsummoned in her brain. She had caught herself wondering what\r\nmarriage was like, and the becoming conscious of the waywardness and\r\nardor of the thought had terrified her. It was unmaidenly. It was not\r\nlike her. She had never been tormented by womanhood, and she had lived\r\nin a dreamland of Tennysonian poesy, dense even to the full\r\nsignificance of that delicate master\xe2\x80\x99s delicate allusions to the\r\ngrossnesses that intrude upon the relations of queens and knights. She\r\nhad been asleep, always, and now life was thundering imperatively at\r\nall her doors. Mentally she was in a panic to shoot the bolts and drop\r\nthe bars into place, while wanton instincts urged her to throw wide her\r\nportals and bid the deliciously strange visitor to enter in.\r\n\r\nMartin waited with satisfaction for her verdict. He had no doubt of\r\nwhat it would be, and he was astounded when he heard her say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, with emphasis, after a pause.\r\n\r\nOf course it was beautiful; but there was something more than mere\r\nbeauty in it, something more stingingly splendid which had made beauty\r\nits handmaiden. He sprawled silently on the ground, watching the grisly\r\nform of a great doubt rising before him. He had failed. He was\r\ninarticulate. He had seen one of the greatest things in the world, and\r\nhe had not expressed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you think of the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated, abashed at his first attempt\r\nto use a strange word. \xe2\x80\x9cOf the _motif_?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was confused,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is my only criticism in the\r\nlarge way. I followed the story, but there seemed so much else. It is\r\ntoo wordy. You clog the action by introducing so much extraneous\r\nmaterial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the major _motif_,\xe2\x80\x9d he hurriedly explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe big\r\nunderrunning _motif_, the cosmic and universal thing. I tried to make\r\nit keep time with the story itself, which was only superficial after\r\nall. I was on the right scent, but I guess I did it badly. I did not\r\nsucceed in suggesting what I was driving at. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll learn in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not follow him. She was a bachelor of arts, but he had gone\r\nbeyond her limitations. This she did not comprehend, attributing her\r\nincomprehension to his incoherence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were too voluble,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was beautiful, in places.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe heard her voice as from far off, for he was debating whether he\r\nwould read her the \xe2\x80\x9cSea Lyrics.\xe2\x80\x9d He lay in dull despair, while she\r\nwatched him searchingly, pondering again upon unsummoned and wayward\r\nthoughts of marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to be famous?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a little bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he confessed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is part of the adventure. It\r\nis not the being famous, but the process of becoming so, that counts.\r\nAnd after all, to be famous would be, for me, only a means to something\r\nelse. I want to be famous very much, for that matter, and for that\r\nreason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor your sake,\xe2\x80\x9d he wanted to add, and might have added had she proved\r\nenthusiastic over what he had read to her.\r\n\r\nBut she was too busy in her mind, carving out a career for him that\r\nwould at least be possible, to ask what the ultimate something was\r\nwhich he had hinted at. There was no career for him in literature. Of\r\nthat she was convinced. He had proved it to-day, with his amateurish\r\nand sophomoric productions. He could talk well, but he was incapable of\r\nexpressing himself in a literary way. She compared Tennyson, and\r\nBrowning, and her favorite prose masters with him, and to his hopeless\r\ndiscredit. Yet she did not tell him her whole mind. Her strange\r\ninterest in him led her to temporize. His desire to write was, after\r\nall, a little weakness which he would grow out of in time. Then he\r\nwould devote himself to the more serious affairs of life. And he would\r\nsucceed, too. She knew that. He was so strong that he could not fail\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nonly he would drop writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would show me all you write, Mr. Eden,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe flushed with pleasure. She was interested, that much was sure. And\r\nat least she had not given him a rejection slip. She had called certain\r\nportions of his work beautiful, and that was the first encouragement he\r\nhad ever received from any one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I promise you, Miss Morse, that I\r\nwill make good. I have come far, I know that; and I have far to go, and\r\nI will cover it if I have to do it on my hands and knees.\xe2\x80\x9d He held up a\r\nbunch of manuscript. \xe2\x80\x9cHere are the \xe2\x80\x98Sea Lyrics.\xe2\x80\x99 When you get home,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll turn them over to you to read at your leisure. And you must be\r\nsure to tell me just what you think of them. What I need, you know,\r\nabove all things, is criticism. And do, please, be frank with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be perfectly frank,\xe2\x80\x9d she promised, with an uneasy conviction\r\nthat she had not been frank with him and with a doubt if she could be\r\nquite frank with him the next time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first battle, fought and finished,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said to the\r\nlooking-glass ten days later. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there will be a second battle, and a\r\nthird battle, and battles to the end of time, unless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not finished the sentence, but looked about the mean little room\r\nand let his eyes dwell sadly upon a heap of returned manuscripts, still\r\nin their long envelopes, which lay in a corner on the floor. He had no\r\nstamps with which to continue them on their travels, and for a week\r\nthey had been piling up. More of them would come in on the morrow, and\r\non the next day, and the next, till they were all in. And he would be\r\nunable to start them out again. He was a month\xe2\x80\x99s rent behind on the\r\ntypewriter, which he could not pay, having barely enough for the week\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboard which was due and for the employment office fees.\r\n\r\nHe sat down and regarded the table thoughtfully. There were ink stains\r\nupon it, and he suddenly discovered that he was fond of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old table,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve spent some happy hours with you, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been a pretty good friend when all is said and done. You never\r\nturned me down, never passed me out a reward-of-unmerit rejection slip,\r\nnever complained about working overtime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped his arms upon the table and buried his face in them. His\r\nthroat was aching, and he wanted to cry. It reminded him of his first\r\nfight, when he was six years old, when he punched away with the tears\r\nrunning down his cheeks while the other boy, two years his elder, had\r\nbeaten and pounded him into exhaustion. He saw the ring of boys,\r\nhowling like barbarians as he went down at last, writhing in the throes\r\nof nausea, the blood streaming from his nose and the tears from his\r\nbruised eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little shaver,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re just as badly licked\r\nnow. You\xe2\x80\x99re beaten to a pulp. You\xe2\x80\x99re down and out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the vision of that first fight still lingered under his eyelids,\r\nand as he watched he saw it dissolve and reshape into the series of\r\nfights which had followed. Six months later Cheese-Face (that was the\r\nboy) had whipped him again. But he had blacked Cheese-Face\xe2\x80\x99s eye that\r\ntime. That was going some. He saw them all, fight after fight, himself\r\nalways whipped and Cheese-Face exulting over him. But he had never run\r\naway. He felt strengthened by the memory of that. He had always stayed\r\nand taken his medicine. Cheese-Face had been a little fiend at\r\nfighting, and had never once shown mercy to him. But he had stayed! He\r\nhad stayed with it!\r\n\r\nNext, he saw a narrow alley, between ramshackle frame buildings. The\r\nend of the alley was blocked by a one-story brick building, out of\r\nwhich issued the rhythmic thunder of the presses, running off the first\r\nedition of the _Enquirer_. He was eleven, and Cheese-Face was thirteen,\r\nand they both carried the _Enquirer_. That was why they were there,\r\nwaiting for their papers. And, of course, Cheese-Face had picked on him\r\nagain, and there was another fight that was indeterminate, because at\r\nquarter to four the door of the press-room was thrown open and the gang\r\nof boys crowded in to fold their papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll lick you to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard Cheese-Face promise; and he heard\r\nhis own voice, piping and trembling with unshed tears, agreeing to be\r\nthere on the morrow.\r\n\r\nAnd he had come there the next day, hurrying from school to be there\r\nfirst, and beating Cheese-Face by two minutes. The other boys said he\r\nwas all right, and gave him advice, pointing out his faults as a\r\nscrapper and promising him victory if he carried out their\r\ninstructions. The same boys gave Cheese-Face advice, too. How they had\r\nenjoyed the fight! He paused in his recollections long enough to envy\r\nthem the spectacle he and Cheese-Face had put up. Then the fight was\r\non, and it went on, without rounds, for thirty minutes, until the\r\npress-room door was opened.\r\n\r\nHe watched the youthful apparition of himself, day after day, hurrying\r\nfrom school to the _Enquirer_ alley. He could not walk very fast. He\r\nwas stiff and lame from the incessant fighting. His forearms were black\r\nand blue from wrist to elbow, what of the countless blows he had warded\r\noff, and here and there the tortured flesh was beginning to fester. His\r\nhead and arms and shoulders ached, the small of his back ached,\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nached all over, and his brain was heavy and dazed. He did not play at\r\nschool. Nor did he study. Even to sit still all day at his desk, as he\r\ndid, was a torment. It seemed centuries since he had begun the round of\r\ndaily fights, and time stretched away into a nightmare and infinite\r\nfuture of daily fights. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t Cheese-Face be licked? he often\r\nthought; that would put him, Martin, out of his misery. It never\r\nentered his head to cease fighting, to allow Cheese-Face to whip him.\r\n\r\nAnd so he dragged himself to the _Enquirer_ alley, sick in body and\r\nsoul, but learning the long patience, to confront his eternal enemy,\r\nCheese-Face, who was just as sick as he, and just a bit willing to quit\r\nif it were not for the gang of newsboys that looked on and made pride\r\npainful and necessary. One afternoon, after twenty minutes of desperate\r\nefforts to annihilate each other according to set rules that did not\r\npermit kicking, striking below the belt, nor hitting when one was down,\r\nCheese-Face, panting for breath and reeling, offered to call it quits.\r\nAnd Martin, head on arms, thrilled at the picture he caught of himself,\r\nat that moment in the afternoon of long ago, when he reeled and panted\r\nand choked with the blood that ran into his mouth and down his throat\r\nfrom his cut lips; when he tottered toward Cheese-Face, spitting out a\r\nmouthful of blood so that he could speak, crying out that he would\r\nnever quit, though Cheese-Face could give in if he wanted to. And\r\nCheese-Face did not give in, and the fight went on.\r\n\r\nThe next day and the next, days without end, witnessed the afternoon\r\nfight. When he put up his arms, each day, to begin, they pained\r\nexquisitely, and the first few blows, struck and received, racked his\r\nsoul; after that things grew numb, and he fought on blindly, seeing as\r\nin a dream, dancing and wavering, the large features and burning,\r\nanimal-like eyes of Cheese-Face. He concentrated upon that face; all\r\nelse about him was a whirling void. There was nothing else in the world\r\nbut that face, and he would never know rest, blessed rest, until he had\r\nbeaten that face into a pulp with his bleeding knuckles, or until the\r\nbleeding knuckles that somehow belonged to that face had beaten him\r\ninto a pulp. And then, one way or the other, he would have rest. But to\r\nquit,\xe2\x80\x94for him, Martin, to quit,\xe2\x80\x94that was impossible!\r\n\r\nCame the day when he dragged himself into the _Enquirer_ alley, and\r\nthere was no Cheese-Face. Nor did Cheese-Face come. The boys\r\ncongratulated him, and told him that he had licked Cheese-Face. But\r\nMartin was not satisfied. He had not licked Cheese-Face, nor had\r\nCheese-Face licked him. The problem had not been solved. It was not\r\nuntil afterward that they learned that Cheese-Face\xe2\x80\x99s father had died\r\nsuddenly that very day.\r\n\r\nMartin skipped on through the years to the night in the nigger heaven\r\nat the Auditorium. He was seventeen and just back from sea. A row\r\nstarted. Somebody was bullying somebody, and Martin interfered, to be\r\nconfronted by Cheese-Face\xe2\x80\x99s blazing eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll fix you after de show,\xe2\x80\x9d his ancient enemy hissed.\r\n\r\nMartin nodded. The nigger-heaven bouncer was making his way toward the\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll meet you outside, after the last act,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin whispered, the\r\nwhile his face showed undivided interest in the buck-and-wing dancing\r\non the stage.\r\n\r\nThe bouncer glared and went away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot a gang?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Cheese-Face, at the end of the act.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I got to get one,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin announced.\r\n\r\nBetween the acts he mustered his following\xe2\x80\x94three fellows he knew from\r\nthe nail works, a railroad fireman, and half a dozen of the Boo Gang,\r\nalong with as many more from the dread Eighteen-and-Market Gang.\r\n\r\nWhen the theatre let out, the two gangs strung along inconspicuously on\r\nopposite sides of the street. When they came to a quiet corner, they\r\nunited and held a council of war.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighth Street Bridge is the place,\xe2\x80\x9d said a red-headed fellow belonging\r\nto Cheese-Face\xe2\x80\x99s Gang. \xe2\x80\x9cYou kin fight in the middle, under the electric\r\nlight, an\xe2\x80\x99 whichever way the bulls come in we kin sneak the other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s agreeable to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, after consulting with the\r\nleaders of his own gang.\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Street Bridge, crossing an arm of San Antonio Estuary, was\r\nthe length of three city blocks. In the middle of the bridge, and at\r\neach end, were electric lights. No policeman could pass those\r\nend-lights unseen. It was the safe place for the battle that revived\r\nitself under Martin\xe2\x80\x99s eyelids. He saw the two gangs, aggressive and\r\nsullen, rigidly keeping apart from each other and backing their\r\nrespective champions; and he saw himself and Cheese-Face stripping. A\r\nshort distance away lookouts were set, their task being to watch the\r\nlighted ends of the bridge. A member of the Boo Gang held Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoat, and shirt, and cap, ready to race with them into safety in case\r\nthe police interfered. Martin watched himself go into the centre,\r\nfacing Cheese-Face, and he heard himself say, as he held up his hand\r\nwarningly:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no hand-shakin\xe2\x80\x99 in this. Understand? They ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothin\xe2\x80\x99 but\r\nscrap. No throwin\xe2\x80\x99 up the sponge. This is a grudge-fight an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s to a\r\nfinish. Understand? Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get licked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCheese-Face wanted to demur,\xe2\x80\x94Martin could see that,\xe2\x80\x94but Cheese-Face\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nold perilous pride was touched before the two gangs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAw, come on,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWot\xe2\x80\x99s the good of chewin\xe2\x80\x99 de rag about it?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m wit\xe2\x80\x99 cheh to de finish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they fell upon each other, like young bulls, in all the glory of\r\nyouth, with naked fists, with hatred, with desire to hurt, to maim, to\r\ndestroy. All the painful, thousand years\xe2\x80\x99 gains of man in his upward\r\nclimb through creation were lost. Only the electric light remained, a\r\nmilestone on the path of the great human adventure. Martin and\r\nCheese-Face were two savages, of the stone age, of the squatting place\r\nand the tree refuge. They sank lower and lower into the muddy abyss,\r\nback into the dregs of the raw beginnings of life, striving blindly and\r\nchemically, as atoms strive, as the star-dust of the heavens strives,\r\ncolliding, recoiling, and colliding again and eternally again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod! We are animals! Brute-beasts!\xe2\x80\x9d Martin muttered aloud, as he\r\nwatched the progress of the fight. It was to him, with his splendid\r\npower of vision, like gazing into a kinetoscope. He was both onlooker\r\nand participant. His long months of culture and refinement shuddered at\r\nthe sight; then the present was blotted out of his consciousness and\r\nthe ghosts of the past possessed him, and he was Martin Eden, just\r\nreturned from sea and fighting Cheese-Face on the Eighth Street Bridge.\r\nHe suffered and toiled and sweated and bled, and exulted when his naked\r\nknuckles smashed home.\r\n\r\nThey were twin whirlwinds of hatred, revolving about each other\r\nmonstrously. The time passed, and the two hostile gangs became very\r\nquiet. They had never witnessed such intensity of ferocity, and they\r\nwere awed by it. The two fighters were greater brutes than they. The\r\nfirst splendid velvet edge of youth and condition wore off, and they\r\nfought more cautiously and deliberately. There had been no advantage\r\ngained either way. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s anybody\xe2\x80\x99s fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin heard some one\r\nsaying. Then he followed up a feint, right and left, was fiercely\r\ncountered, and felt his cheek laid open to the bone. No bare knuckle\r\nhad done that. He heard mutters of amazement at the ghastly damage\r\nwrought, and was drenched with his own blood. But he gave no sign. He\r\nbecame immensely wary, for he was wise with knowledge of the low\r\ncunning and foul vileness of his kind. He watched and waited, until he\r\nfeigned a wild rush, which he stopped midway, for he had seen the glint\r\nof metal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold up yer hand!\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed. \xe2\x80\x9cThem\xe2\x80\x99s brass knuckles, an\xe2\x80\x99 you hit me\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth gangs surged forward, growling and snarling. In a second there\r\nwould be a free-for-all fight, and he would be robbed of his vengeance.\r\nHe was beside himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou guys keep out!\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed hoarsely. \xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand? Say, d\xe2\x80\x99ye\r\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey shrank away from him. They were brutes, but he was the arch-brute,\r\na thing of terror that towered over them and dominated them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my scrap, an\xe2\x80\x99 they ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be no buttin\xe2\x80\x99 in. Gimme them\r\nknuckles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCheese-Face, sobered and a bit frightened, surrendered the foul weapon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou passed \xe2\x80\x99em to him, you red-head sneakin\xe2\x80\x99 in behind the push\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin went on, as he tossed the knuckles into the water. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nseen you, an\xe2\x80\x99 I was wonderin\xe2\x80\x99 what you was up to. If you try anything\r\nlike that again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll beat cheh to death. Understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey fought on, through exhaustion and beyond, to exhaustion\r\nimmeasurable and inconceivable, until the crowd of brutes, its\r\nblood-lust sated, terrified by what it saw, begged them impartially to\r\ncease. And Cheese-Face, ready to drop and die, or to stay on his legs\r\nand die, a grisly monster out of whose features all likeness to\r\nCheese-Face had been beaten, wavered and hesitated; but Martin sprang\r\nin and smashed him again and again.\r\n\r\nNext, after a seeming century or so, with Cheese-Face weakening fast,\r\nin a mix-up of blows there was a loud snap, and Martin\xe2\x80\x99s right arm\r\ndropped to his side. It was a broken bone. Everybody heard it and knew;\r\nand Cheese-Face knew, rushing like a tiger in the other\xe2\x80\x99s extremity and\r\nraining blow on blow. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s gang surged forward to interfere. Dazed\r\nby the rapid succession of blows, Martin warned them back with vile and\r\nearnest curses sobbed out and groaned in ultimate desolation and\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nHe punched on, with his left hand only, and as he punched, doggedly,\r\nonly half-conscious, as from a remote distance he heard murmurs of fear\r\nin the gangs, and one who said with shaking voice: \xe2\x80\x9cThis ain\xe2\x80\x99t a scrap,\r\nfellows. It\xe2\x80\x99s murder, an\xe2\x80\x99 we ought to stop it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no one stopped it, and he was glad, punching on wearily and\r\nendlessly with his one arm, battering away at a bloody something before\r\nhim that was not a face but a horror, an oscillating, hideous,\r\ngibbering, nameless thing that persisted before his wavering vision and\r\nwould not go away. And he punched on and on, slower and slower, as the\r\nlast shreds of vitality oozed from him, through centuries and aeons and\r\nenormous lapses of time, until, in a dim way, he became aware that the\r\nnameless thing was sinking, slowly sinking down to the rough\r\nboard-planking of the bridge. And the next moment he was standing over\r\nit, staggering and swaying on shaky legs, clutching at the air for\r\nsupport, and saying in a voice he did not recognize:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye want any more? Say, d\xe2\x80\x99ye want any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was still saying it, over and over,\xe2\x80\x94demanding, entreating,\r\nthreatening, to know if it wanted any more,\xe2\x80\x94when he felt the fellows of\r\nhis gang laying hands on him, patting him on the back and trying to put\r\nhis coat on him. And then came a sudden rush of blackness and oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe tin alarm-clock on the table ticked on, but Martin Eden, his face\r\nburied on his arms, did not hear it. He heard nothing. He did not\r\nthink. So absolutely had he relived life that he had fainted just as he\r\nfainted years before on the Eighth Street Bridge. For a full minute the\r\nblackness and the blankness endured. Then, like one from the dead, he\r\nsprang upright, eyes flaming, sweat pouring down his face, shouting:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI licked you, Cheese-Face! It took me eleven years, but I licked you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis knees were trembling under him, he felt faint, and he staggered\r\nback to the bed, sinking down and sitting on the edge of it. He was\r\nstill in the clutch of the past. He looked about the room, perplexed,\r\nalarmed, wondering where he was, until he caught sight of the pile of\r\nmanuscripts in the corner. Then the wheels of memory slipped ahead\r\nthrough four years of time, and he was aware of the present, of the\r\nbooks he had opened and the universe he had won from their pages, of\r\nhis dreams and ambitions, and of his love for a pale wraith of a girl,\r\nsensitive and sheltered and ethereal, who would die of horror did she\r\nwitness but one moment of what he had just lived through\xe2\x80\x94one moment of\r\nall the muck of life through which he had waded.\r\n\r\nHe arose to his feet and confronted himself in the looking-glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you arise from the mud, Martin Eden,\xe2\x80\x9d he said solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyou cleanse your eyes in a great brightness, and thrust your shoulders\r\namong the stars, doing what all life has done, letting the \xe2\x80\x98ape and\r\ntiger die\xe2\x80\x99 and wresting highest heritage from all powers that be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked more closely at himself and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bit of hysteria and melodrama, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he queried. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind.\r\nYou licked Cheese-Face, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll lick the editors if it takes twice\r\neleven years to do it in. You can\xe2\x80\x99t stop here. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go on.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s to a finish, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alarm-clock went off, jerking Martin out of sleep with a suddenness\r\nthat would have given headache to one with less splendid constitution.\r\nThough he slept soundly, he awoke instantly, like a cat, and he awoke\r\neagerly, glad that the five hours of unconsciousness were gone. He\r\nhated the oblivion of sleep. There was too much to do, too much of life\r\nto live. He grudged every moment of life sleep robbed him of, and\r\nbefore the clock had ceased its clattering he was head and ears in the\r\nwashbasin and thrilling to the cold bite of the water.\r\n\r\nBut he did not follow his regular programme. There was no unfinished\r\nstory waiting his hand, no new story demanding articulation. He had\r\nstudied late, and it was nearly time for breakfast. He tried to read a\r\nchapter in Fiske, but his brain was restless and he closed the book.\r\nTo-day witnessed the beginning of the new battle, wherein for some time\r\nthere would be no writing. He was aware of a sadness akin to that with\r\nwhich one leaves home and family. He looked at the manuscripts in the\r\ncorner. That was it. He was going away from them, his pitiful,\r\ndishonored children that were welcome nowhere. He went over and began\r\nto rummage among them, reading snatches here and there, his favorite\r\nportions. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pot\xe2\x80\x9d he honored with reading aloud, as he did\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdventure.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cJoy,\xe2\x80\x9d his latest-born, completed the day before and\r\ntossed into the corner for lack of stamps, won his keenest approbation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cOr maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s the editors who can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with that. They publish worse every\r\nmonth. Everything they publish is worse\xe2\x80\x94nearly everything, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast he put the type-writer in its case and carried it down\r\ninto Oakland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owe a month on it,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the clerk in the store. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you tell\r\nthe manager I\xe2\x80\x99m going to work and that I\xe2\x80\x99ll be in in a month or so and\r\nstraighten up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe crossed on the ferry to San Francisco and made his way to an\r\nemployment office. \xe2\x80\x9cAny kind of work, no trade,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the agent; and\r\nwas interrupted by a new-comer, dressed rather foppishly, as some\r\nworkingmen dress who have instincts for finer things. The agent shook\r\nhis head despondently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothin\xe2\x80\x99 doin\xe2\x80\x99 eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I got to get somebody\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned and stared at Martin, and Martin, staring back, noted the\r\npuffed and discolored face, handsome and weak, and knew that he had\r\nbeen making a night of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookin\xe2\x80\x99 for a job?\xe2\x80\x9d the other queried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard labor, sailorizing, run a type-writer, no shorthand, can sit on a\r\nhorse, willing to do anything and tackle anything,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\nThe other nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSounds good to me. My name\xe2\x80\x99s Dawson, Joe Dawson, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nscare up a laundryman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much for me.\xe2\x80\x9d Martin caught an amusing glimpse of himself ironing\r\nfluffy white things that women wear. But he had taken a liking to the\r\nother, and he added: \xe2\x80\x9cI might do the plain washing. I learned that much\r\nat sea.\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Dawson thought visibly for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, let\xe2\x80\x99s get together an\xe2\x80\x99 frame it up. Willin\xe2\x80\x99 to listen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a small laundry, up country, belongs to Shelly Hot\r\nSprings,\xe2\x80\x94hotel, you know. Two men do the work, boss and assistant. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nthe boss. You don\xe2\x80\x99t work for me, but you work under me. Think you\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nwillin\xe2\x80\x99 to learn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin paused to think. The prospect was alluring. A few months of it,\r\nand he would have time to himself for study. He could work hard and\r\nstudy hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood grub an\xe2\x80\x99 a room to yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe said.\r\n\r\nThat settled it. A room to himself where he could burn the midnight oil\r\nunmolested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut work like hell,\xe2\x80\x9d the other added.\r\n\r\nMartin caressed his swelling shoulder-muscles significantly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat came\r\nfrom hard work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let\xe2\x80\x99s get to it.\xe2\x80\x9d Joe held his hand to his head for a moment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a stem-winder. Can hardly see. I went down the line last\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94everything\xe2\x80\x94everything. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the frame-up. The wages for two is\r\na hundred and board. I\xe2\x80\x99ve ben drawin\xe2\x80\x99 down sixty, the second man forty.\r\nBut he knew the biz. You\xe2\x80\x99re green. If I break you in, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing\r\nplenty of your work at first. Suppose you begin at thirty, an\xe2\x80\x99 work up\r\nto the forty. I\xe2\x80\x99ll play fair. Just as soon as you can do your share you\r\nget the forty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go you,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin announced, stretching out his hand, which the\r\nother shook. \xe2\x80\x9cAny advance?\xe2\x80\x94for rail-road ticket and extras?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI blew it in,\xe2\x80\x9d was Joe\xe2\x80\x99s sad answer, with another reach at his aching\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I got is a return ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m broke\xe2\x80\x94when I pay my board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJump it,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe advised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t. Owe it to my sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe whistled a long, perplexed whistle, and racked his brains to little\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got the price of the drinks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said desperately. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmebbe we\xe2\x80\x99ll cook up something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin declined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWater-wagon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Martin nodded, and Joe lamented, \xe2\x80\x9cWish I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I somehow just can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in extenuation. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter I\xe2\x80\x99ve ben\r\nworkin\xe2\x80\x99 like hell all week I just got to booze up. If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99d cut\r\nmy throat or burn up the premises. But I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99re on the wagon.\r\nStay with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin knew of the enormous gulf between him and this man\xe2\x80\x94the gulf the\r\nbooks had made; but he found no difficulty in crossing back over that\r\ngulf. He had lived all his life in the working-class world, and the\r\n_camaraderie_ of labor was second nature with him. He solved the\r\ndifficulty of transportation that was too much for the other\xe2\x80\x99s aching\r\nhead. He would send his trunk up to Shelly Hot Springs on Joe\xe2\x80\x99s ticket.\r\nAs for himself, there was his wheel. It was seventy miles, and he could\r\nride it on Sunday and be ready for work Monday morning. In the meantime\r\nhe would go home and pack up. There was no one to say good-by to. Ruth\r\nand her whole family were spending the long summer in the Sierras, at\r\nLake Tahoe.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at Shelly Hot Springs, tired and dusty, on Sunday night. Joe\r\ngreeted him exuberantly. With a wet towel bound about his aching brow,\r\nhe had been at work all day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPart of last week\xe2\x80\x99s washin\xe2\x80\x99 mounted up, me bein\xe2\x80\x99 away to get you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexplained. \xe2\x80\x9cYour box arrived all right. It\xe2\x80\x99s in your room. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nhell of a thing to call a trunk. An\xe2\x80\x99 what\xe2\x80\x99s in it? Gold bricks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe sat on the bed while Martin unpacked. The box was a packing-case\r\nfor breakfast food, and Mr. Higginbotham had charged him half a dollar\r\nfor it. Two rope handles, nailed on by Martin, had technically\r\ntransformed it into a trunk eligible for the baggage-car. Joe watched,\r\nwith bulging eyes, a few shirts and several changes of underclothes\r\ncome out of the box, followed by books, and more books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBooks clean to the bottom?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMartin nodded, and went on arranging the books on a kitchen table which\r\nserved in the room in place of a wash-stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee!\xe2\x80\x9d Joe exploded, then waited in silence for the deduction to arise\r\nin his brain. At last it came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, you don\xe2\x80\x99t care for the girls\xe2\x80\x94much?\xe2\x80\x9d he queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to chase a lot before I tackled the\r\nbooks. But since then there\xe2\x80\x99s no time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any time here. All you can do is work an\xe2\x80\x99 sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin thought of his five hours\xe2\x80\x99 sleep a night, and smiled. The room\r\nwas situated over the laundry and was in the same building with the\r\nengine that pumped water, made electricity, and ran the laundry\r\nmachinery. The engineer, who occupied the adjoining room, dropped in to\r\nmeet the new hand and helped Martin rig up an electric bulb, on an\r\nextension wire, so that it travelled along a stretched cord from over\r\nthe table to the bed.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at quarter-past six, Martin was routed out for a\r\nquarter-to-seven breakfast. There happened to be a bath-tub for the\r\nservants in the laundry building, and he electrified Joe by taking a\r\ncold bath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee, but you\xe2\x80\x99re a hummer!\xe2\x80\x9d Joe announced, as they sat down to\r\nbreakfast in a corner of the hotel kitchen.\r\n\r\nWith them was the engineer, the gardener, and the assistant gardener,\r\nand two or three men from the stable. They ate hurriedly and gloomily,\r\nwith but little conversation, and as Martin ate and listened he\r\nrealized how far he had travelled from their status. Their small mental\r\ncaliber was depressing to him, and he was anxious to get away from\r\nthem. So he bolted his breakfast, a sickly, sloppy affair, as rapidly\r\nas they, and heaved a sigh of relief when he passed out through the\r\nkitchen door.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfectly appointed, small steam laundry, wherein the most\r\nmodern machinery did everything that was possible for machinery to do.\r\nMartin, after a few instructions, sorted the great heaps of soiled\r\nclothes, while Joe started the masher and made up fresh supplies of\r\nsoft-soap, compounded of biting chemicals that compelled him to swathe\r\nhis mouth and nostrils and eyes in bath-towels till he resembled a\r\nmummy. Finished the sorting, Martin lent a hand in wringing the\r\nclothes. This was done by dumping them into a spinning receptacle that\r\nwent at a rate of a few thousand revolutions a minute, tearing the\r\nwater from the clothes by centrifugal force. Then Martin began to\r\nalternate between the dryer and the wringer, between times \xe2\x80\x9cshaking\r\nout\xe2\x80\x9d socks and stockings. By the afternoon, one feeding and one\r\nstacking up, they were running socks and stockings through the mangle\r\nwhile the irons were heating. Then it was hot irons and underclothes\r\ntill six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at which time Joe shook his head dubiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWay behind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGot to work after supper.\xe2\x80\x9d And after supper\r\nthey worked until ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, under the blazing electric lights, until\r\nthe last piece of under-clothing was ironed and folded away in the\r\ndistributing room. It was a hot California night, and though the\r\nwindows were thrown wide, the room, with its red-hot ironing-stove, was\r\na furnace. Martin and Joe, down to undershirts, bare armed, sweated and\r\npanted for air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike trimming cargo in the tropics,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, when they went\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou take hold like a good fellow. If you\r\nkeep up the pace, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be on thirty dollars only one month. The\r\nsecond month you\xe2\x80\x99ll be gettin\xe2\x80\x99 your forty. But don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you never\r\nironed before. I know better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever ironed a rag in my life, honestly, until to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin\r\nprotested.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised at his weariness when he got into his room, forgetful\r\nof the fact that he had been on his feet and working without let up for\r\nfourteen hours. He set the alarm clock at six, and measured back five\r\nhours to one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He could read until then. Slipping off his shoes,\r\nto ease his swollen feet, he sat down at the table with his books. He\r\nopened Fiske, where he had left off to read. But he found trouble and\r\nbegan to read it through a second time. Then he awoke, in pain from his\r\nstiffened muscles and chilled by the mountain wind that had begun to\r\nblow in through the window. He looked at the clock. It marked two. He\r\nhad been asleep four hours. He pulled off his clothes and crawled into\r\nbed, where he was asleep the moment after his head touched the pillow.\r\n\r\nTuesday was a day of similar unremitting toil. The speed with which Joe\r\nworked won Martin\xe2\x80\x99s admiration. Joe was a dozen of demons for work. He\r\nwas keyed up to concert pitch, and there was never a moment in the long\r\nday when he was not fighting for moments. He concentrated himself upon\r\nhis work and upon how to save time, pointing out to Martin where he did\r\nin five motions what could be done in three, or in three motions what\r\ncould be done in two. \xe2\x80\x9cElimination of waste motion,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin phrased it\r\nas he watched and patterned after. He was a good workman himself, quick\r\nand deft, and it had always been a point of pride with him that no man\r\nshould do any of his work for him or outwork him. As a result, he\r\nconcentrated with a similar singleness of purpose, greedily snapping up\r\nthe hints and suggestions thrown out by his working mate. He \xe2\x80\x9crubbed\r\nout\xe2\x80\x9d collars and cuffs, rubbing the starch out from between the double\r\nthicknesses of linen so that there would be no blisters when it came to\r\nthe ironing, and doing it at a pace that elicited Joe\xe2\x80\x99s praise.\r\n\r\nThere was never an interval when something was not at hand to be done.\r\nJoe waited for nothing, waited on nothing, and went on the jump from\r\ntask to task. They starched two hundred white shirts, with a single\r\ngathering movement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands, neckband,\r\nyoke, and bosom protruded beyond the circling right hand. At the same\r\nmoment the left hand held up the body of the shirt so that it would not\r\nenter the starch, and at the same moment the right hand dipped into the\r\nstarch\xe2\x80\x94starch so hot that, in order to wring it out, their hands had to\r\nthrust, and thrust continually, into a bucket of cold water. And that\r\nnight they worked till half-past ten, dipping \xe2\x80\x9cfancy starch\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94all the\r\nfrilled and airy, delicate wear of ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe for the tropics and no clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me out of a job,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe answered seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbut laundrying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to. Began in the Contra Costa in Oakland when I was eleven,\r\nshakin\xe2\x80\x99 out for the mangle. That was eighteen years ago, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\ndone a tap of anything else. But this job is the fiercest I ever had.\r\nOught to be one more man on it at least. We work to-morrow night.\r\nAlways run the mangle Wednesday nights\xe2\x80\x94collars an\xe2\x80\x99 cuffs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin set his alarm, drew up to the table, and opened Fiske. He did\r\nnot finish the first paragraph. The lines blurred and ran together and\r\nhis head nodded. He walked up and down, batting his head savagely with\r\nhis fists, but he could not conquer the numbness of sleep. He propped\r\nthe book before him, and propped his eyelids with his fingers, and fell\r\nasleep with his eyes wide open. Then he surrendered, and, scarcely\r\nconscious of what he did, got off his clothes and into bed. He slept\r\nseven hours of heavy, animal-like sleep, and awoke by the alarm,\r\nfeeling that he had not had enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoin\xe2\x80\x99 much readin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe asked.\r\n\r\nMartin shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. We got to run the mangle to-night, but Thursday we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nknock off at six. That\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin washed woollens that day, by hand, in a large barrel, with\r\nstrong soft-soap, by means of a hub from a wagon wheel, mounted on a\r\nplunger-pole that was attached to a spring-pole overhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy invention,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe said proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cBeats a washboard an\xe2\x80\x99 your knuckles,\r\nand, besides, it saves at least fifteen minutes in the week, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfifteen minutes ain\xe2\x80\x99t to be sneezed at in this shebang.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRunning the collars and cuffs through the mangle was also Joe\xe2\x80\x99s idea.\r\nThat night, while they toiled on under the electric lights, he\r\nexplained it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething no laundry ever does, except this one. An\xe2\x80\x99 I got to do it if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get done Saturday afternoon at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. But I know\r\nhow, an\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s the difference. Got to have right heat, right pressure,\r\nand run \xe2\x80\x99em through three times. Look at that!\xe2\x80\x9d He held a cuff aloft.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it better by hand or on a tiler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThursday, Joe was in a rage. A bundle of extra \xe2\x80\x9cfancy starch\xe2\x80\x9d had come\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to quit,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t stand for it. I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nquit it cold. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of me workin\xe2\x80\x99 like a slave all week,\r\na-savin\xe2\x80\x99 minutes, an\xe2\x80\x99 them a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 ringin\xe2\x80\x99 in fancy-starch extras\r\non me? This is a free country, an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m to tell that fat Dutchman what I\r\nthink of him. An\xe2\x80\x99 I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell \xe2\x80\x99m in French. Plain United States is\r\ngood enough for me. Him a-ringin\xe2\x80\x99 in fancy starch extras!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe got to work to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said the next moment, reversing his\r\njudgment and surrendering to fate.\r\n\r\nAnd Martin did no reading that night. He had seen no daily paper all\r\nweek, and, strangely to him, felt no desire to see one. He was not\r\ninterested in the news. He was too tired and jaded to be interested in\r\nanything, though he planned to leave Saturday afternoon, if they\r\nfinished at three, and ride on his wheel to Oakland. It was seventy\r\nmiles, and the same distance back on Sunday afternoon would leave him\r\nanything but rested for the second week\xe2\x80\x99s work. It would have been\r\neasier to go on the train, but the round trip was two dollars and a\r\nhalf, and he was intent on saving money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin learned to do many things. In the course of the first week, in\r\none afternoon, he and Joe accounted for the two hundred white shirts.\r\nJoe ran the tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel\r\nstring which furnished the pressure. By this means he ironed the yoke,\r\nwristbands, and neckband, setting the latter at right angles to the\r\nshirt, and put the glossy finish on the bosom. As fast as he finished\r\nthem, he flung the shirts on a rack between him and Martin, who caught\r\nthem up and \xe2\x80\x9cbacked\xe2\x80\x9d them. This task consisted of ironing all the\r\nunstarched portions of the shirts.\r\n\r\nIt was exhausting work, carried on, hour after hour, at top speed. Out\r\non the broad verandas of the hotel, men and women, in cool white,\r\nsipped iced drinks and kept their circulation down. But in the laundry\r\nthe air was sizzling. The huge stove roared red hot and white hot,\r\nwhile the irons, moving over the damp cloth, sent up clouds of steam.\r\nThe heat of these irons was different from that used by housewives. An\r\niron that stood the ordinary test of a wet finger was too cold for Joe\r\nand Martin, and such test was useless. They went wholly by holding the\r\nirons close to their cheeks, gauging the heat by some secret mental\r\nprocess that Martin admired but could not understand. When the fresh\r\nirons proved too hot, they hooked them on iron rods and dipped them\r\ninto cold water. This again required a precise and subtle judgment. A\r\nfraction of a second too long in the water and the fine and silken edge\r\nof the proper heat was lost, and Martin found time to marvel at the\r\naccuracy he developed\xe2\x80\x94an automatic accuracy, founded upon criteria that\r\nwere machine-like and unerring.\r\n\r\nBut there was little time in which to marvel. All Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsciousness was concentrated in the work. Ceaselessly active, head\r\nand hand, an intelligent machine, all that constituted him a man was\r\ndevoted to furnishing that intelligence. There was no room in his brain\r\nfor the universe and its mighty problems. All the broad and spacious\r\ncorridors of his mind were closed and hermetically sealed. The echoing\r\nchamber of his soul was a narrow room, a conning tower, whence were\r\ndirected his arm and shoulder muscles, his ten nimble fingers, and the\r\nswift-moving iron along its steaming path in broad, sweeping strokes,\r\njust so many strokes and no more, just so far with each stroke and not\r\na fraction of an inch farther, rushing along interminable sleeves,\r\nsides, backs, and tails, and tossing the finished shirts, without\r\nrumpling, upon the receiving frame. And even as his hurrying soul\r\ntossed, it was reaching for another shirt. This went on, hour after\r\nhour, while outside all the world swooned under the overhead California\r\nsun. But there was no swooning in that superheated room. The cool\r\nguests on the verandas needed clean linen.\r\n\r\nThe sweat poured from Martin. He drank enormous quantities of water,\r\nbut so great was the heat of the day and of his exertions, that the\r\nwater sluiced through the interstices of his flesh and out at all his\r\npores. Always, at sea, except at rare intervals, the work he performed\r\nhad given him ample opportunity to commune with himself. The master of\r\nthe ship had been lord of Martin\xe2\x80\x99s time; but here the manager of the\r\nhotel was lord of Martin\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts as well. He had no thoughts save\r\nfor the nerve-racking, body-destroying toil. Outside of that it was\r\nimpossible to think. He did not know that he loved Ruth. She did not\r\neven exist, for his driven soul had no time to remember her. It was\r\nonly when he crawled to bed at night, or to breakfast in the morning,\r\nthat she asserted herself to him in fleeting memories.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is hell, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe remarked once.\r\n\r\nMartin nodded, but felt a rasp of irritation. The statement had been\r\nobvious and unnecessary. They did not talk while they worked.\r\nConversation threw them out of their stride, as it did this time,\r\ncompelling Martin to miss a stroke of his iron and to make two extra\r\nmotions before he caught his stride again.\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning the washer ran. Twice a week they had to put through\r\nhotel linen,\xe2\x80\x94the sheets, pillow-slips, spreads, table-cloths, and\r\nnapkins. This finished, they buckled down to \xe2\x80\x9cfancy starch.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\nslow work, fastidious and delicate, and Martin did not learn it so\r\nreadily. Besides, he could not take chances. Mistakes were disastrous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee that,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe said, holding up a filmy corset-cover that he could\r\nhave crumpled from view in one hand. \xe2\x80\x9cScorch that an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s twenty\r\ndollars out of your wages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Martin did not scorch that, and eased down on his muscular tension,\r\nthough nervous tension rose higher than ever, and he listened\r\nsympathetically to the other\xe2\x80\x99s blasphemies as he toiled and suffered\r\nover the beautiful things that women wear when they do not have to do\r\ntheir own laundrying. \xe2\x80\x9cFancy starch\xe2\x80\x9d was Martin\xe2\x80\x99s nightmare, and it was\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s, too. It was \xe2\x80\x9cfancy starch\xe2\x80\x9d that robbed them of their hard-won\r\nminutes. They toiled at it all day. At seven in the evening they broke\r\noff to run the hotel linen through the mangle. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, while\r\nthe hotel guests slept, the two laundrymen sweated on at \xe2\x80\x9cfancy starch\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ntill midnight, till one, till two. At half-past two they knocked off.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning it was \xe2\x80\x9cfancy starch,\xe2\x80\x9d and odds and ends, and at three\r\nin the afternoon the week\xe2\x80\x99s work was done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to ride them seventy miles into Oakland on top of\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe demanded, as they sat on the stairs and took a triumphant\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot to,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you goin\xe2\x80\x99 for?\xe2\x80\x94a girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; to save two and a half on the railroad ticket. I want to renew\r\nsome books at the library.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you send \xe2\x80\x99em down an\xe2\x80\x99 up by express? That\xe2\x80\x99ll cost only a\r\nquarter each way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin considered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 take a rest to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d the other urged. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need it. I know I\r\ndo. I\xe2\x80\x99m plumb tuckered out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked it. Indomitable, never resting, fighting for seconds and\r\nminutes all week, circumventing delays and crushing down obstacles, a\r\nfount of resistless energy, a high-driven human motor, a demon for\r\nwork, now that he had accomplished the week\xe2\x80\x99s task he was in a state of\r\ncollapse. He was worn and haggard, and his handsome face drooped in\r\nlean exhaustion. He pulled his cigarette spiritlessly, and his voice\r\nwas peculiarly dead and monotonous. All the snap and fire had gone out\r\nof him. His triumph seemed a sorry one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 next week we got to do it all over again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of it all, hey? Sometimes I wish I was a hobo. They\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t work, an\xe2\x80\x99 they get their livin\xe2\x80\x99. Gee! I wish I had a glass of\r\nbeer; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t get up the gumption to go down to the village an\xe2\x80\x99 get\r\nit. You\xe2\x80\x99ll stay over, an\xe2\x80\x99 send your books down by express, or else\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a damn fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what can I do here all day Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how tired you are. Why, I\xe2\x80\x99m that tired Sunday I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t even read the papers. I was sick once\xe2\x80\x94typhoid. In the hospital\r\ntwo months an\xe2\x80\x99 a half. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t do a tap of work all that time. It was\r\nbeautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated dreamily, a minute later.\r\n\r\nMartin took a bath, after which he found that the head laundryman had\r\ndisappeared. Most likely he had gone for a glass of beer Martin\r\ndecided, but the half-mile walk down to the village to find out seemed\r\na long journey to him. He lay on his bed with his shoes off, trying to\r\nmake up his mind. He did not reach out for a book. He was too tired to\r\nfeel sleepy, and he lay, scarcely thinking, in a semi-stupor of\r\nweariness, until it was time for supper. Joe did not appear for that\r\nfunction, and when Martin heard the gardener remark that most likely he\r\nwas ripping the slats off the bar, Martin understood. He went to bed\r\nimmediately afterward, and in the morning decided that he was greatly\r\nrested. Joe being still absent, Martin procured a Sunday paper and lay\r\ndown in a shady nook under the trees. The morning passed, he knew not\r\nhow. He did not sleep, nobody disturbed him, and he did not finish the\r\npaper. He came back to it in the afternoon, after dinner, and fell\r\nasleep over it.\r\n\r\nSo passed Sunday, and Monday morning he was hard at work, sorting\r\nclothes, while Joe, a towel bound tightly around his head, with groans\r\nand blasphemies, was running the washer and mixing soft-soap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI simply can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cI got to drink when Saturday\r\nnight comes around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother week passed, a great battle that continued under the electric\r\nlights each night and that culminated on Saturday afternoon at three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, when Joe tasted his moment of wilted triumph and then drifted\r\ndown to the village to forget. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday was the same as before.\r\nHe slept in the shade of the trees, toiled aimlessly through the\r\nnewspaper, and spent long hours lying on his back, doing nothing,\r\nthinking nothing. He was too dazed to think, though he was aware that\r\nhe did not like himself. He was self-repelled, as though he had\r\nundergone some degradation or was intrinsically foul. All that was\r\ngod-like in him was blotted out. The spur of ambition was blunted; he\r\nhad no vitality with which to feel the prod of it. He was dead. His\r\nsoul seemed dead. He was a beast, a work-beast. He saw no beauty in the\r\nsunshine sifting down through the green leaves, nor did the azure vault\r\nof the sky whisper as of old and hint of cosmic vastness and secrets\r\ntrembling to disclosure. Life was intolerably dull and stupid, and its\r\ntaste was bad in his mouth. A black screen was drawn across his mirror\r\nof inner vision, and fancy lay in a darkened sick-room where entered no\r\nray of light. He envied Joe, down in the village, rampant, tearing the\r\nslats off the bar, his brain gnawing with maggots, exulting in maudlin\r\nways over maudlin things, fantastically and gloriously drunk and\r\nforgetful of Monday morning and the week of deadening toil to come.\r\n\r\nA third week went by, and Martin loathed himself, and loathed life. He\r\nwas oppressed by a sense of failure. There was reason for the editors\r\nrefusing his stuff. He could see that clearly now, and laugh at himself\r\nand the dreams he had dreamed. Ruth returned his \xe2\x80\x9cSea Lyrics\xe2\x80\x9d by mail.\r\nHe read her letter apathetically. She did her best to say how much she\r\nliked them and that they were beautiful. But she could not lie, and she\r\ncould not disguise the truth from herself. She knew they were failures,\r\nand he read her disapproval in every perfunctory and unenthusiastic\r\nline of her letter. And she was right. He was firmly convinced of it as\r\nhe read the poems over. Beauty and wonder had departed from him, and as\r\nhe read the poems he caught himself puzzling as to what he had had in\r\nmind when he wrote them. His audacities of phrase struck him as\r\ngrotesque, his felicities of expression were monstrosities, and\r\neverything was absurd, unreal, and impossible. He would have burned the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSea Lyrics\xe2\x80\x9d on the spot, had his will been strong enough to set them\r\naflame. There was the engine-room, but the exertion of carrying them to\r\nthe furnace was not worth while. All his exertion was used in washing\r\nother persons\xe2\x80\x99 clothes. He did not have any left for private affairs.\r\n\r\nHe resolved that when Sunday came he would pull himself together and\r\nanswer Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s letter. But Saturday afternoon, after work was finished\r\nand he had taken a bath, the desire to forget overpowered him. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go down and see how Joe\xe2\x80\x99s getting on,\xe2\x80\x9d was the way he put it to\r\nhimself; and in the same moment he knew that he lied. But he did not\r\nhave the energy to consider the lie. If he had had the energy, he would\r\nhave refused to consider the lie, because he wanted to forget. He\r\nstarted for the village slowly and casually, increasing his pace in\r\nspite of himself as he neared the saloon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you was on the water-wagon,\xe2\x80\x9d was Joe\xe2\x80\x99s greeting.\r\n\r\nMartin did not deign to offer excuses, but called for whiskey, filling\r\nhis own glass brimming before he passed the bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take all night about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said roughly.\r\n\r\nThe other was dawdling with the bottle, and Martin refused to wait for\r\nhim, tossing the glass off in a gulp and refilling it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I can wait for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said grimly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut hurry up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe hurried, and they drank together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe work did it, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe queried.\r\n\r\nMartin refused to discuss the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fair hell, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d the other went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I kind of hate to see\r\nyou come off the wagon, Mart. Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s how!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin drank on silently, biting out his orders and invitations and\r\nawing the barkeeper, an effeminate country youngster with watery blue\r\neyes and hair parted in the middle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something scandalous the way they work us poor devils,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe was\r\nremarking. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bowl up, I\xe2\x80\x99d break loose an\xe2\x80\x99 burn down the\r\nshebang. My bowlin\xe2\x80\x99 up is all that saves \xe2\x80\x99em, I can tell you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Martin made no answer. A few more drinks, and in his brain he felt\r\nthe maggots of intoxication beginning to crawl. Ah, it was living, the\r\nfirst breath of life he had breathed in three weeks. His dreams came\r\nback to him. Fancy came out of the darkened room and lured him on, a\r\nthing of flaming brightness. His mirror of vision was silver-clear, a\r\nflashing, dazzling palimpsest of imagery. Wonder and beauty walked with\r\nhim, hand in hand, and all power was his. He tried to tell it to Joe,\r\nbut Joe had visions of his own, infallible schemes whereby he would\r\nescape the slavery of laundry-work and become himself the owner of a\r\ngreat steam laundry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell yeh, Mart, they won\xe2\x80\x99t be no kids workin\xe2\x80\x99 in my laundry\xe2\x80\x94not on\r\nyer life. An\xe2\x80\x99 they won\xe2\x80\x99t be no workin\xe2\x80\x99 a livin\xe2\x80\x99 soul after six P.M. You\r\nhear me talk! They\xe2\x80\x99ll be machinery enough an\xe2\x80\x99 hands enough to do it all\r\nin decent workin\xe2\x80\x99 hours, an\xe2\x80\x99 Mart, s\xe2\x80\x99help me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make yeh\r\nsuperintendent of the shebang\xe2\x80\x94the whole of it, all of it. Now here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe scheme. I get on the water-wagon an\xe2\x80\x99 save my money for two\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94save an\xe2\x80\x99 then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Martin turned away, leaving him to tell it to the barkeeper, until\r\nthat worthy was called away to furnish drinks to two farmers who,\r\ncoming in, accepted Martin\xe2\x80\x99s invitation. Martin dispensed royal\r\nlargess, inviting everybody up, farm-hands, a stableman, and the\r\ngardener\xe2\x80\x99s assistant from the hotel, the barkeeper, and the furtive\r\nhobo who slid in like a shadow and like a shadow hovered at the end of\r\nthe bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday morning, Joe groaned over the first truck load of clothes to the\r\nwasher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin snarled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at noon, when they knocked off for dinner.\r\n\r\nTears came into the other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in hell, an\xe2\x80\x99 we can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nourselves. An\xe2\x80\x99, you know, I kind of like you a whole lot. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nmade it\xe2\x80\x94hurt. I cottoned to you from the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin shook his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s quit,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s chuck it, an\xe2\x80\x99 go hoboin\xe2\x80\x99. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnever tried it, but it must be dead easy. An\xe2\x80\x99 nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to do. Just think\r\nof it, nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to do. I was sick once, typhoid, in the hospital, an\xe2\x80\x99 it\r\nwas beautiful. I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d get sick again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe week dragged on. The hotel was full, and extra \xe2\x80\x9cfancy starch\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npoured in upon them. They performed prodigies of valor. They fought\r\nlate each night under the electric lights, bolted their meals, and even\r\ngot in a half hour\xe2\x80\x99s work before breakfast. Martin no longer took his\r\ncold baths. Every moment was drive, drive, drive, and Joe was the\r\nmasterful shepherd of moments, herding them carefully, never losing\r\none, counting them over like a miser counting gold, working on in a\r\nfrenzy, toil-mad, a feverish machine, aided ably by that other machine\r\nthat thought of itself as once having been one Martin Eden, a man.\r\n\r\nBut it was only at rare moments that Martin was able to think. The\r\nhouse of thought was closed, its windows boarded up, and he was its\r\nshadowy caretaker. He was a shadow. Joe was right. They were both\r\nshadows, and this was the unending limbo of toil. Or was it a dream?\r\nSometimes, in the steaming, sizzling heat, as he swung the heavy irons\r\nback and forth over the white garments, it came to him that it was a\r\ndream. In a short while, or maybe after a thousand years or so, he\r\nwould awake, in his little room with the ink-stained table, and take up\r\nhis writing where he had left off the day before. Or maybe that was a\r\ndream, too, and the awakening would be the changing of the watches,\r\nwhen he would drop down out of his bunk in the lurching forecastle and\r\ngo up on deck, under the tropic stars, and take the wheel and feel the\r\ncool tradewind blowing through his flesh.\r\n\r\nCame Saturday and its hollow victory at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down an\xe2\x80\x99 get a glass of beer,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe said, in the queer,\r\nmonotonous tones that marked his week-end collapse.\r\n\r\nMartin seemed suddenly to wake up. He opened the kit bag and oiled his\r\nwheel, putting graphite on the chain and adjusting the bearings. Joe\r\nwas halfway down to the saloon when Martin passed by, bending low over\r\nthe handle-bars, his legs driving the ninety-six gear with rhythmic\r\nstrength, his face set for seventy miles of road and grade and dust. He\r\nslept in Oakland that night, and on Sunday covered the seventy miles\r\nback. And on Monday morning, weary, he began the new week\xe2\x80\x99s work, but\r\nhe had kept sober.\r\n\r\nA fifth week passed, and a sixth, during which he lived and toiled as a\r\nmachine, with just a spark of something more in him, just a glimmering\r\nbit of soul, that compelled him, at each week-end, to scorch off the\r\nhundred and forty miles. But this was not rest. It was\r\nsuper-machinelike, and it helped to crush out the glimmering bit of\r\nsoul that was all that was left him from former life. At the end of the\r\nseventh week, without intending it, too weak to resist, he drifted down\r\nto the village with Joe and drowned life and found life until Monday\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nAgain, at the week-ends, he ground out the one hundred and forty miles,\r\nobliterating the numbness of too great exertion by the numbness of\r\nstill greater exertion. At the end of three months he went down a third\r\ntime to the village with Joe. He forgot, and lived again, and, living,\r\nhe saw, in clear illumination, the beast he was making of himself\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nby the drink, but by the work. The drink was an effect, not a cause. It\r\nfollowed inevitably upon the work, as the night follows upon the day.\r\nNot by becoming a toil-beast could he win to the heights, was the\r\nmessage the whiskey whispered to him, and he nodded approbation. The\r\nwhiskey was wise. It told secrets on itself.\r\n\r\nHe called for paper and pencil, and for drinks all around, and while\r\nthey drank his very good health, he clung to the bar and scribbled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA telegram, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cRead it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe read it with a drunken, quizzical leer. But what he read seemed to\r\nsober him. He looked at the other reproachfully, tears oozing into his\r\neyes and down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 back on me, Mart?\xe2\x80\x9d he queried hopelessly.\r\n\r\nMartin nodded, and called one of the loungers to him to take the\r\nmessage to the telegraph office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe muttered thickly. \xe2\x80\x9cLemme think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held on to the bar, his legs wobbling under him, Martin\xe2\x80\x99s arm around\r\nhim and supporting him, while he thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake that two laundrymen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, lemme fix it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you quitting for?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSame reason as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m going to sea. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNope,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can hobo all right, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin looked at him searchingly for a moment, then cried:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re right! Better a hobo than a beast of toil. Why,\r\nman, you\xe2\x80\x99ll live. And that\xe2\x80\x99s more than you ever did before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in hospital, once,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe corrected. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was beautiful.\r\nTyphoid\xe2\x80\x94did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Martin changed the telegram to \xe2\x80\x9ctwo laundrymen,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe went on:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never wanted to drink when I was in hospital. Funny, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? But\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99ve ben workin\xe2\x80\x99 like a slave all week, I just got to bowl up.\r\nEver noticed that cooks drink like hell?\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 bakers, too? It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nwork. They\xe2\x80\x99ve sure got to. Here, lemme pay half of that telegram.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll shake you for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin offered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, everybody drink,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe called, as they rattled the dice and\r\nrolled them out on the damp bar.\r\n\r\nMonday morning Joe was wild with anticipation. He did not mind his\r\naching head, nor did he take interest in his work. Whole herds of\r\nmoments stole away and were lost while their careless shepherd gazed\r\nout of the window at the sunshine and the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look at it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s all mine! It\xe2\x80\x99s free. I can lie\r\ndown under them trees an\xe2\x80\x99 sleep for a thousan\xe2\x80\x99 years if I want to. Aw,\r\ncome on, Mart, let\xe2\x80\x99s chuck it. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of waitin\xe2\x80\x99 another\r\nmoment. That\xe2\x80\x99s the land of nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to do out there, an\xe2\x80\x99 I got a ticket\r\nfor it\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no return ticket, b\xe2\x80\x99gosh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, filling the truck with soiled clothes for the\r\nwasher, Joe spied the hotel manager\xe2\x80\x99s shirt. He knew its mark, and with\r\na sudden glorious consciousness of freedom he threw it on the floor and\r\nstamped on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you was in it, you pig-headed Dutchman!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cIn it,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 right there where I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you! Take that! an\xe2\x80\x99 that! an\xe2\x80\x99 that! damn\r\nyou! Hold me back, somebody! Hold me back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin laughed and held him to his work. On Tuesday night the new\r\nlaundrymen arrived, and the rest of the week was spent breaking them\r\ninto the routine. Joe sat around and explained his system, but he did\r\nno more work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a tap,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a tap. They can fire me if they want\r\nto, but if they do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll quit. No more work in mine, thank you kindly.\r\nMe for the freight cars an\xe2\x80\x99 the shade under the trees. Go to it, you\r\nslaves! That\xe2\x80\x99s right. Slave an\xe2\x80\x99 sweat! Slave an\xe2\x80\x99 sweat! An\xe2\x80\x99 when you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndead, you\xe2\x80\x99ll rot the same as me, an\xe2\x80\x99 what\xe2\x80\x99s it matter how you live?\xe2\x80\x94eh?\r\nTell me that\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s it matter in the long run?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn Saturday they drew their pay and came to the parting of the ways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use in me askin\xe2\x80\x99 you to change your mind an\xe2\x80\x99 hit the\r\nroad with me?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe asked hopelessly:\r\n\r\nMartin shook his head. He was standing by his wheel, ready to start.\r\nThey shook hands, and Joe held on to his for a moment, as he said:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to see you again, Mart, before you an\xe2\x80\x99 me die. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstraight dope. I feel it in my bones. Good-by, Mart, an\xe2\x80\x99 be good. I\r\nlike you like hell, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood, a forlorn figure, in the middle of the road, watching until\r\nMartin turned a bend and was gone from sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a good Indian, that boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cA good Indian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he plodded down the road himself, to the water tank, where half a\r\ndozen empties lay on a side-track waiting for the up freight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nRuth and her family were home again, and Martin, returned to Oakland,\r\nsaw much of her. Having gained her degree, she was doing no more\r\nstudying; and he, having worked all vitality out of his mind and body,\r\nwas doing no writing. This gave them time for each other that they had\r\nnever had before, and their intimacy ripened fast.\r\n\r\nAt first, Martin had done nothing but rest. He had slept a great deal,\r\nand spent long hours musing and thinking and doing nothing. He was like\r\none recovering from some terrible bout of hardship. The first signs of\r\nreawakening came when he discovered more than languid interest in the\r\ndaily paper. Then he began to read again\xe2\x80\x94light novels, and poetry; and\r\nafter several days more he was head over heels in his long-neglected\r\nFiske. His splendid body and health made new vitality, and he possessed\r\nall the resiliency and rebound of youth.\r\n\r\nRuth showed her disappointment plainly when he announced that he was\r\ngoing to sea for another voyage as soon as he was well rested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to lay in a supply for my next\r\nattack on the editors. Money is the sinews of war, in my case\xe2\x80\x94money and\r\npatience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if all you wanted was money, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you stay in the laundry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the laundry was making a beast of me. Too much work of that\r\nsort drives to drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared at him with horror in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d she quavered.\r\n\r\nIt would have been easy for him to get out of it; but his natural\r\nimpulse was for frankness, and he remembered his old resolve to be\r\nfrank, no matter what happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cJust that. Several times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shivered and drew away from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo man that I have ever known did that\xe2\x80\x94ever did that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they never worked in the laundry at Shelly Hot Springs,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nlaughed bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cToil is a good thing. It is necessary for human\r\nhealth, so all the preachers say, and Heaven knows I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been\r\nafraid of it. But there is such a thing as too much of a good thing,\r\nand the laundry up there is one of them. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\nsea one more voyage. It will be my last, I think, for when I come back,\r\nI shall break into the magazines. I am certain of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent, unsympathetic, and he watched her moodily, realizing\r\nhow impossible it was for her to understand what he had been through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome day I shall write it up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98The Degradation of Toil\xe2\x80\x99 or the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Psychology of Drink in the Working-class,\xe2\x80\x99 or something like that for\r\na title.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever, since the first meeting, had they seemed so far apart as that\r\nday. His confession, told in frankness, with the spirit of revolt\r\nbehind, had repelled her. But she was more shocked by the repulsion\r\nitself than by the cause of it. It pointed out to her how near she had\r\ndrawn to him, and once accepted, it paved the way for greater intimacy.\r\nPity, too, was aroused, and innocent, idealistic thoughts of reform.\r\nShe would save this raw young man who had come so far. She would save\r\nhim from the curse of his early environment, and she would save him\r\nfrom himself in spite of himself. And all this affected her as a very\r\nnoble state of consciousness; nor did she dream that behind it and\r\nunderlying it were the jealousy and desire of love.\r\n\r\nThey rode on their wheels much in the delightful fall weather, and out\r\nin the hills they read poetry aloud, now one and now the other, noble,\r\nuplifting poetry that turned one\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts to higher things.\r\nRenunciation, sacrifice, patience, industry, and high endeavor were the\r\nprinciples she thus indirectly preached\xe2\x80\x94such abstractions being\r\nobjectified in her mind by her father, and Mr. Butler, and by Andrew\r\nCarnegie, who, from a poor immigrant boy had arisen to be the\r\nbook-giver of the world. All of which was appreciated and enjoyed by\r\nMartin. He followed her mental processes more clearly now, and her soul\r\nwas no longer the sealed wonder it had been. He was on terms of\r\nintellectual equality with her. But the points of disagreement did not\r\naffect his love. His love was more ardent than ever, for he loved her\r\nfor what she was, and even her physical frailty was an added charm in\r\nhis eyes. He read of sickly Elizabeth Barrett, who for years had not\r\nplaced her feet upon the ground, until that day of flame when she\r\neloped with Browning and stood upright, upon the earth, under the open\r\nsky; and what Browning had done for her, Martin decided he could do for\r\nRuth. But first, she must love him. The rest would be easy. He would\r\ngive her strength and health. And he caught glimpses of their life, in\r\nthe years to come, wherein, against a background of work and comfort\r\nand general well-being, he saw himself and Ruth reading and discussing\r\npoetry, she propped amid a multitude of cushions on the ground while\r\nshe read aloud to him. This was the key to the life they would live.\r\nAnd always he saw that particular picture. Sometimes it was she who\r\nleaned against him while he read, one arm about her, her head upon his\r\nshoulder. Sometimes they pored together over the printed pages of\r\nbeauty. Then, too, she loved nature, and with generous imagination he\r\nchanged the scene of their reading\xe2\x80\x94sometimes they read in closed-in\r\nvalleys with precipitous walls, or in high mountain meadows, and,\r\nagain, down by the gray sand-dunes with a wreath of billows at their\r\nfeet, or afar on some volcanic tropic isle where waterfalls descended\r\nand became mist, reaching the sea in vapor veils that swayed and\r\nshivered to every vagrant wisp of wind. But always, in the foreground,\r\nlords of beauty and eternally reading and sharing, lay he and Ruth, and\r\nalways in the background that was beyond the background of nature, dim\r\nand hazy, were work and success and money earned that made them free of\r\nthe world and all its treasures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should recommend my little girl to be careful,\xe2\x80\x9d her mother warned\r\nher one day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you mean. But it is impossible. He is not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth was blushing, but it was the blush of maidenhood called upon for\r\nthe first time to discuss the sacred things of life with a mother held\r\nequally sacred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour kind.\xe2\x80\x9d Her mother finished the sentence for her.\r\n\r\nRuth nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not want to say it, but he is not. He is rough, brutal,\r\nstrong\xe2\x80\x94too strong. He has not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated and could not go on. It was a new experience, talking\r\nover such matters with her mother. And again her mother completed her\r\nthought for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not lived a clean life, is what you wanted to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Ruth nodded, and again a blush mantled her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has not been his fault, but he has\r\nplayed much with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, with pitch. And he frightens me. Sometimes I am positively in\r\nterror of him, when he talks in that free and easy way of the things he\r\nhas done\xe2\x80\x94as if they did not matter. They do matter, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat with their arms twined around each other, and in the pause her\r\nmother patted her hand and waited for her to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am interested in him dreadfully,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a way he is\r\nmy prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9. Then, too, he is my first boy friend\xe2\x80\x94but not exactly\r\nfriend; rather prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 and friend combined. Sometimes, too, when he\r\nfrightens me, it seems that he is a bulldog I have taken for a\r\nplaything, like some of the \xe2\x80\x98frat\xe2\x80\x99 girls, and he is tugging hard, and\r\nshowing his teeth, and threatening to break loose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain her mother waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe interests me, I suppose, like the bulldog. And there is much good\r\nin him, too; but there is much in him that I would not like in\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nother way. You see, I have been thinking. He swears, he smokes, he\r\ndrinks, he has fought with his fists (he has told me so, and he likes\r\nit; he says so). He is all that a man should not be\xe2\x80\x94a man I would want\r\nfor my\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d her voice sank very low\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chusband. Then he is too strong. My\r\nprince must be tall, and slender, and dark\xe2\x80\x94a graceful, bewitching\r\nprince. No, there is no danger of my falling in love with Martin Eden.\r\nIt would be the worst fate that could befall me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not that that I spoke about,\xe2\x80\x9d her mother equivocated. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou thought about him? He is so ineligible in every way, you know, and\r\nsuppose he should come to love you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he does\xe2\x80\x94already,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was to be expected,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Morse said gently. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could it be\r\notherwise with any one who knew you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOlney hates me!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I hate Olney. I feel\r\nalways like a cat when he is around. I feel that I must be nasty to\r\nhim, and even when I don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to feel that way, why, he\xe2\x80\x99s nasty to\r\nme, anyway. But I am happy with Martin Eden. No one ever loved me\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94no man, I mean, in that way. And it is sweet to be loved\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nway. You know what I mean, mother dear. It is sweet to feel that you\r\nare really and truly a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d She buried her face in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s lap,\r\nsobbing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think I am dreadful, I know, but I am honest, and I tell\r\nyou just how I feel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Morse was strangely sad and happy. Her child-daughter, who was a\r\nbachelor of arts, was gone; but in her place was a woman-daughter. The\r\nexperiment had succeeded. The strange void in Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s nature had been\r\nfilled, and filled without danger or penalty. This rough sailor-fellow\r\nhad been the instrument, and, though Ruth did not love him, he had made\r\nher conscious of her womanhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis hand trembles,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth was confessing, her face, for shame\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nstill buried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is most amusing and ridiculous, but I feel sorry for\r\nhim, too. And when his hands are too trembly, and his eyes too shiny,\r\nwhy, I lecture him about his life and the wrong way he is going about\r\nit to mend it. But he worships me, I know. His eyes and his hands do\r\nnot lie. And it makes me feel grown-up, the thought of it, the very\r\nthought of it; and I feel that I am possessed of something that is by\r\nrights my own\xe2\x80\x94that makes me like the other girls\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and young women.\r\nAnd, then, too, I knew that I was not like them before, and I knew that\r\nit worried you. You thought you did not let me know that dear worry of\r\nyours, but I did, and I wanted to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98to make good,\xe2\x80\x99 as Martin Eden says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a holy hour for mother and daughter, and their eyes were wet as\r\nthey talked on in the twilight, Ruth all white innocence and frankness,\r\nher mother sympathetic, receptive, yet calmly explaining and guiding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is four years younger than you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has no place in the\r\nworld. He has neither position nor salary. He is impractical. Loving\r\nyou, he should, in the name of common sense, be doing something that\r\nwould give him the right to marry, instead of paltering around with\r\nthose stories of his and with childish dreams. Martin Eden, I am\r\nafraid, will never grow up. He does not take to responsibility and a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s work in the world like your father did, or like all our friends,\r\nMr. Butler for one. Martin Eden, I am afraid, will never be a\r\nmoney-earner. And this world is so ordered that money is necessary to\r\nhappiness\xe2\x80\x94oh, no, not these swollen fortunes, but enough of money to\r\npermit of common comfort and decency. He\xe2\x80\x94he has never spoken?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not breathed a word. He has not attempted to; but if he did, I\r\nwould not let him, because, you see, I do not love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of that. I should not care to see my daughter, my one\r\ndaughter, who is so clean and pure, love a man like him. There are\r\nnoble men in the world who are clean and true and manly. Wait for them.\r\nYou will find one some day, and you will love him and be loved by him,\r\nand you will be happy with him as your father and I have been happy\r\nwith each other. And there is one thing you must always carry in mind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Morse\xe2\x80\x99s voice was low and sweet as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is the\r\nchildren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94have thought about them,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth confessed, remembering the wanton\r\nthoughts that had vexed her in the past, her face again red with maiden\r\nshame that she should be telling such things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is that, the children, that makes Mr. Eden impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nMorse went on incisively. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir heritage must be clean, and he is, I\r\nam afraid, not clean. Your father has told me of sailors\xe2\x80\x99 lives,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94and you understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth pressed her mother\xe2\x80\x99s hand in assent, feeling that she really did\r\nunderstand, though her conception was of something vague, remote, and\r\nterrible that was beyond the scope of imagination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I do nothing without telling you,\xe2\x80\x9d she began. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Only,\r\nsometimes you must ask me, like this time. I wanted to tell you, but I\r\ndid not know how. It is false modesty, I know it is that, but you can\r\nmake it easy for me. Sometimes, like this time, you must ask me, you\r\nmust give me a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, mother, you are a woman, too!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried exultantly, as they\r\nstood up, catching her mother\xe2\x80\x99s hands and standing erect, facing her in\r\nthe twilight, conscious of a strangely sweet equality between them. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould never have thought of you in that way if we had not had this\r\ntalk. I had to learn that I was a woman to know that you were one,\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are women together,\xe2\x80\x9d her mother said, drawing her to her and\r\nkissing her. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are women together,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, as they went out of\r\nthe room, their arms around each other\xe2\x80\x99s waists, their hearts swelling\r\nwith a new sense of companionship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur little girl has become a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Morse said proudly to her\r\nhusband an hour later.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a long look at his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cthat means she\r\nis in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but that she is loved,\xe2\x80\x9d was the smiling rejoinder. \xe2\x80\x9cThe experiment\r\nhas succeeded. She is awakened at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get rid of him.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Morse spoke briskly, in\r\nmatter-of-fact, businesslike tones.\r\n\r\nBut his wife shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will not be necessary. Ruth says he is\r\ngoing to sea in a few days. When he comes back, she will not be here.\r\nWe will send her to Aunt Clara\xe2\x80\x99s. And, besides, a year in the East,\r\nwith the change in climate, people, ideas, and everything, is just the\r\nthing she needs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe desire to write was stirring in Martin once more. Stories and poems\r\nwere springing into spontaneous creation in his brain, and he made\r\nnotes of them against the future time when he would give them\r\nexpression. But he did not write. This was his little vacation; he had\r\nresolved to devote it to rest and love, and in both matters he\r\nprospered. He was soon spilling over with vitality, and each day he saw\r\nRuth, at the moment of meeting, she experienced the old shock of his\r\nstrength and health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful,\xe2\x80\x9d her mother warned her once again. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you are\r\nseeing too much of Martin Eden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Ruth laughed from security. She was sure of herself, and in a few\r\ndays he would be off to sea. Then, by the time he returned, she would\r\nbe away on her visit East. There was a magic, however, in the strength\r\nand health of Martin. He, too, had been told of her contemplated\r\nEastern trip, and he felt the need for haste. Yet he did not know how\r\nto make love to a girl like Ruth. Then, too, he was handicapped by the\r\npossession of a great fund of experience with girls and women who had\r\nbeen absolutely different from her. They had known about love and life\r\nand flirtation, while she knew nothing about such things. Her\r\nprodigious innocence appalled him, freezing on his lips all ardors of\r\nspeech, and convincing him, in spite of himself, of his own\r\nunworthiness. Also he was handicapped in another way. He had himself\r\nnever been in love before. He had liked women in that turgid past of\r\nhis, and been fascinated by some of them, but he had not known what it\r\nwas to love them. He had whistled in a masterful, careless way, and\r\nthey had come to him. They had been diversions, incidents, part of the\r\ngame men play, but a small part at most. And now, and for the first\r\ntime, he was a suppliant, tender and timid and doubting. He did not\r\nknow the way of love, nor its speech, while he was frightened at his\r\nloved one\xe2\x80\x99s clear innocence.\r\n\r\nIn the course of getting acquainted with a varied world, whirling on\r\nthrough the ever changing phases of it, he had learned a rule of\r\nconduct which was to the effect that when one played a strange game, he\r\nshould let the other fellow play first. This had stood him in good\r\nstead a thousand times and trained him as an observer as well. He knew\r\nhow to watch the thing that was strange, and to wait for a weakness,\r\nfor a place of entrance, to divulge itself. It was like sparring for an\r\nopening in fist-fighting. And when such an opening came, he knew by\r\nlong experience to play for it and to play hard.\r\n\r\nSo he waited with Ruth and watched, desiring to speak his love but not\r\ndaring. He was afraid of shocking her, and he was not sure of himself.\r\nHad he but known it, he was following the right course with her. Love\r\ncame into the world before articulate speech, and in its own early\r\nyouth it had learned ways and means that it had never forgotten. It was\r\nin this old, primitive way that Martin wooed Ruth. He did not know he\r\nwas doing it at first, though later he divined it. The touch of his\r\nhand on hers was vastly more potent than any word he could utter, the\r\nimpact of his strength on her imagination was more alluring than the\r\nprinted poems and spoken passions of a thousand generations of lovers.\r\nWhatever his tongue could express would have appealed, in part, to her\r\njudgment; but the touch of hand, the fleeting contact, made its way\r\ndirectly to her instinct. Her judgment was as young as she, but her\r\ninstincts were as old as the race and older. They had been young when\r\nlove was young, and they were wiser than convention and opinion and all\r\nthe new-born things. So her judgment did not act. There was no call\r\nupon it, and she did not realize the strength of the appeal Martin made\r\nfrom moment to moment to her love-nature. That he loved her, on the\r\nother hand, was as clear as day, and she consciously delighted in\r\nbeholding his love-manifestations\xe2\x80\x94the glowing eyes with their tender\r\nlights, the trembling hands, and the never failing swarthy flush that\r\nflooded darkly under his sunburn. She even went farther, in a timid way\r\ninciting him, but doing it so delicately that he never suspected, and\r\ndoing it half-consciously, so that she scarcely suspected herself. She\r\nthrilled with these proofs of her power that proclaimed her a woman,\r\nand she took an Eve-like delight in tormenting him and playing upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTongue-tied by inexperience and by excess of ardor, wooing unwittingly\r\nand awkwardly, Martin continued his approach by contact. The touch of\r\nhis hand was pleasant to her, and something deliciously more than\r\npleasant. Martin did not know it, but he did know that it was not\r\ndistasteful to her. Not that they touched hands often, save at meeting\r\nand parting; but that in handling the bicycles, in strapping on the\r\nbooks of verse they carried into the hills, and in conning the pages of\r\nbooks side by side, there were opportunities for hand to stray against\r\nhand. And there were opportunities, too, for her hair to brush his\r\ncheek, and for shoulder to touch shoulder, as they leaned together over\r\nthe beauty of the books. She smiled to herself at vagrant impulses\r\nwhich arose from nowhere and suggested that she rumple his hair; while\r\nhe desired greatly, when they tired of reading, to rest his head in her\r\nlap and dream with closed eyes about the future that was to be theirs.\r\nOn Sunday picnics at Shellmound Park and Schuetzen Park, in the past,\r\nhe had rested his head on many laps, and, usually, he had slept soundly\r\nand selfishly while the girls shaded his face from the sun and looked\r\ndown and loved him and wondered at his lordly carelessness of their\r\nlove. To rest his head in a girl\xe2\x80\x99s lap had been the easiest thing in\r\nthe world until now, and now he found Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s lap inaccessible and\r\nimpossible. Yet it was right here, in his reticence, that the strength\r\nof his wooing lay. It was because of this reticence that he never\r\nalarmed her. Herself fastidious and timid, she never awakened to the\r\nperilous trend of their intercourse. Subtly and unaware she grew toward\r\nhim and closer to him, while he, sensing the growing closeness, longed\r\nto dare but was afraid.\r\n\r\nOnce he dared, one afternoon, when he found her in the darkened living\r\nroom with a blinding headache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing can do it any good,\xe2\x80\x9d she had answered his inquiries. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nbesides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t take headache powders. Doctor Hall won\xe2\x80\x99t permit me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can cure it, I think, and without drugs,\xe2\x80\x9d was Martin\xe2\x80\x99s answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nnot sure, of course, but I\xe2\x80\x99d like to try. It\xe2\x80\x99s simply massage. I\r\nlearned the trick first from the Japanese. They are a race of masseurs,\r\nyou know. Then I learned it all over again with variations from the\r\nHawaiians. They call it _lomi-lomi_. It can accomplish most of the\r\nthings drugs accomplish and a few things that drugs can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScarcely had his hands touched her head when she sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so good,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe spoke once again, half an hour later, when she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ntired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was perfunctory, and she knew what the answer would be.\r\nThen she lost herself in drowsy contemplation of the soothing balm of\r\nhis strength: Life poured from the ends of his fingers, driving the\r\npain before it, or so it seemed to her, until with the easement of\r\npain, she fell asleep and he stole away.\r\n\r\nShe called him up by telephone that evening to thank him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slept until dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cured me completely, Mr. Eden,\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was warm, and bungling of speech, and very happy, as he replied to\r\nher, and there was dancing in his mind, throughout the telephone\r\nconversation, the memory of Browning and of sickly Elizabeth Barrett.\r\nWhat had been done could be done again, and he, Martin Eden, could do\r\nit and would do it for Ruth Morse. He went back to his room and to the\r\nvolume of Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSociology\xe2\x80\x9d lying open on the bed. But he could not\r\nread. Love tormented him and overrode his will, so that, despite all\r\ndetermination, he found himself at the little ink-stained table. The\r\nsonnet he composed that night was the first of a love-cycle of fifty\r\nsonnets which was completed within two months. He had the \xe2\x80\x9cLove-sonnets\r\nfrom the Portuguese\xe2\x80\x9d in mind as he wrote, and he wrote under the best\r\nconditions for great work, at a climacteric of living, in the throes of\r\nhis own sweet love-madness.\r\n\r\nThe many hours he was not with Ruth he devoted to the \xe2\x80\x9cLove-cycle,\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nreading at home, or to the public reading-rooms, where he got more\r\nclosely in touch with the magazines of the day and the nature of their\r\npolicy and content. The hours he spent with Ruth were maddening alike\r\nin promise and in inconclusiveness. It was a week after he cured her\r\nheadache that a moonlight sail on Lake Merritt was proposed by Norman\r\nand seconded by Arthur and Olney. Martin was the only one capable of\r\nhandling a boat, and he was pressed into service. Ruth sat near him in\r\nthe stern, while the three young fellows lounged amidships, deep in a\r\nwordy wrangle over \xe2\x80\x9cfrat\xe2\x80\x9d affairs.\r\n\r\nThe moon had not yet risen, and Ruth, gazing into the starry vault of\r\nthe sky and exchanging no speech with Martin, experienced a sudden\r\nfeeling of loneliness. She glanced at him. A puff of wind was heeling\r\nthe boat over till the deck was awash, and he, one hand on tiller and\r\nthe other on main-sheet, was luffing slightly, at the same time peering\r\nahead to make out the near-lying north shore. He was unaware of her\r\ngaze, and she watched him intently, speculating fancifully about the\r\nstrange warp of soul that led him, a young man with signal powers, to\r\nfritter away his time on the writing of stories and poems foredoomed to\r\nmediocrity and failure.\r\n\r\nHer eyes wandered along the strong throat, dimly seen in the starlight,\r\nand over the firm-poised head, and the old desire to lay her hands upon\r\nhis neck came back to her. The strength she abhorred attracted her. Her\r\nfeeling of loneliness became more pronounced, and she felt tired. Her\r\nposition on the heeling boat irked her, and she remembered the headache\r\nhe had cured and the soothing rest that resided in him. He was sitting\r\nbeside her, quite beside her, and the boat seemed to tilt her toward\r\nhim. Then arose in her the impulse to lean against him, to rest herself\r\nagainst his strength\xe2\x80\x94a vague, half-formed impulse, which, even as she\r\nconsidered it, mastered her and made her lean toward him. Or was it the\r\nheeling of the boat? She did not know. She never knew. She knew only\r\nthat she was leaning against him and that the easement and soothing\r\nrest were very good. Perhaps it had been the boat\xe2\x80\x99s fault, but she made\r\nno effort to retrieve it. She leaned lightly against his shoulder, but\r\nshe leaned, and she continued to lean when he shifted his position to\r\nmake it more comfortable for her.\r\n\r\nIt was a madness, but she refused to consider the madness. She was no\r\nlonger herself but a woman, with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s clinging need; and though\r\nshe leaned ever so lightly, the need seemed satisfied. She was no\r\nlonger tired. Martin did not speak. Had he, the spell would have been\r\nbroken. But his reticence of love prolonged it. He was dazed and dizzy.\r\nHe could not understand what was happening. It was too wonderful to be\r\nanything but a delirium. He conquered a mad desire to let go sheet and\r\ntiller and to clasp her in his arms. His intuition told him it was the\r\nwrong thing to do, and he was glad that sheet and tiller kept his hands\r\noccupied and fended off temptation. But he luffed the boat less\r\ndelicately, spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to\r\nprolong the tack to the north shore. The shore would compel him to go\r\nabout, and the contact would be broken. He sailed with skill, stopping\r\nway on the boat without exciting the notice of the wranglers, and\r\nmentally forgiving his hardest voyages in that they had made this\r\nmarvellous night possible, giving him mastery over sea and boat and\r\nwind so that he could sail with her beside him, her dear weight against\r\nhim on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhen the first light of the rising moon touched the sail, illuminating\r\nthe boat with pearly radiance, Ruth moved away from him. And, even as\r\nshe moved, she felt him move away. The impulse to avoid detection was\r\nmutual. The episode was tacitly and secretly intimate. She sat apart\r\nfrom him with burning cheeks, while the full force of it came home to\r\nher. She had been guilty of something she would not have her brothers\r\nsee, nor Olney see. Why had she done it? She had never done anything\r\nlike it in her life, and yet she had been moonlight-sailing with young\r\nmen before. She had never desired to do anything like it. She was\r\novercome with shame and with the mystery of her own burgeoning\r\nwomanhood. She stole a glance at Martin, who was busy putting the boat\r\nabout on the other tack, and she could have hated him for having made\r\nher do an immodest and shameful thing. And he, of all men! Perhaps her\r\nmother was right, and she was seeing too much of him. It would never\r\nhappen again, she resolved, and she would see less of him in the\r\nfuture. She entertained a wild idea of explaining to him the first time\r\nthey were alone together, of lying to him, of mentioning casually the\r\nattack of faintness that had overpowered her just before the moon came\r\nup. Then she remembered how they had drawn mutually away before the\r\nrevealing moon, and she knew he would know it for a lie.\r\n\r\nIn the days that swiftly followed she was no longer herself but a\r\nstrange, puzzling creature, wilful over judgment and scornful of\r\nself-analysis, refusing to peer into the future or to think about\r\nherself and whither she was drifting. She was in a fever of tingling\r\nmystery, alternately frightened and charmed, and in constant\r\nbewilderment. She had one idea firmly fixed, however, which insured her\r\nsecurity. She would not let Martin speak his love. As long as she did\r\nthis, all would be well. In a few days he would be off to sea. And even\r\nif he did speak, all would be well. It could not be otherwise, for she\r\ndid not love him. Of course, it would be a painful half hour for him,\r\nand an embarrassing half hour for her, because it would be her first\r\nproposal. She thrilled deliciously at the thought. She was really a\r\nwoman, with a man ripe to ask for her in marriage. It was a lure to all\r\nthat was fundamental in her sex. The fabric of her life, of all that\r\nconstituted her, quivered and grew tremulous. The thought fluttered in\r\nher mind like a flame-attracted moth. She went so far as to imagine\r\nMartin proposing, herself putting the words into his mouth; and she\r\nrehearsed her refusal, tempering it with kindness and exhorting him to\r\ntrue and noble manhood. And especially he must stop smoking cigarettes.\r\nShe would make a point of that. But no, she must not let him speak at\r\nall. She could stop him, and she had told her mother that she would.\r\nAll flushed and burning, she regretfully dismissed the conjured\r\nsituation. Her first proposal would have to be deferred to a more\r\npropitious time and a more eligible suitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCame a beautiful fall day, warm and languid, palpitant with the hush of\r\nthe changing season, a California Indian summer day, with hazy sun and\r\nwandering wisps of breeze that did not stir the slumber of the air.\r\nFilmy purple mists, that were not vapors but fabrics woven of color,\r\nhid in the recesses of the hills. San Francisco lay like a blur of\r\nsmoke upon her heights. The intervening bay was a dull sheen of molten\r\nmetal, whereon sailing craft lay motionless or drifted with the lazy\r\ntide. Far Tamalpais, barely seen in the silver haze, bulked hugely by\r\nthe Golden Gate, the latter a pale gold pathway under the westering\r\nsun. Beyond, the Pacific, dim and vast, was raising on its sky-line\r\ntumbled cloud-masses that swept landward, giving warning of the first\r\nblustering breath of winter.\r\n\r\nThe erasure of summer was at hand. Yet summer lingered, fading and\r\nfainting among her hills, deepening the purple of her valleys, spinning\r\na shroud of haze from waning powers and sated raptures, dying with the\r\ncalm content of having lived and lived well. And among the hills, on\r\ntheir favorite knoll, Martin and Ruth sat side by side, their heads\r\nbent over the same pages, he reading aloud from the love-sonnets of the\r\nwoman who had loved Browning as it is given to few men to be loved.\r\n\r\nBut the reading languished. The spell of passing beauty all about them\r\nwas too strong. The golden year was dying as it had lived, a beautiful\r\nand unrepentant voluptuary, and reminiscent rapture and content\r\nfreighted heavily the air. It entered into them, dreamy and languorous,\r\nweakening the fibres of resolution, suffusing the face of morality, or\r\nof judgment, with haze and purple mist. Martin felt tender and melting,\r\nand from time to time warm glows passed over him. His head was very\r\nnear to hers, and when wandering phantoms of breeze stirred her hair so\r\nthat it touched his face, the printed pages swam before his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you know a word of what you are reading,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nonce when he had lost his place.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with burning eyes, and was on the verge of becoming\r\nawkward, when a retort came to his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you know either. What was the last sonnet about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed frankly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve already forgotten. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nus read any more. The day is too beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be our last in the hills for some time,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced gravely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a storm gathering out there on the sea-rim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe book slipped from his hands to the ground, and they sat idly and\r\nsilently, gazing out over the dreamy bay with eyes that dreamed and did\r\nnot see. Ruth glanced sidewise at his neck. She did not lean toward\r\nhim. She was drawn by some force outside of herself and stronger than\r\ngravitation, strong as destiny. It was only an inch to lean, and it was\r\naccomplished without volition on her part. Her shoulder touched his as\r\nlightly as a butterfly touches a flower, and just as lightly was the\r\ncounter-pressure. She felt his shoulder press hers, and a tremor run\r\nthrough him. Then was the time for her to draw back. But she had become\r\nan automaton. Her actions had passed beyond the control of her will\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nnever thought of control or will in the delicious madness that was upon\r\nher. His arm began to steal behind her and around her. She waited its\r\nslow progress in a torment of delight. She waited, she knew not for\r\nwhat, panting, with dry, burning lips, a leaping pulse, and a fever of\r\nexpectancy in all her blood. The girdling arm lifted higher and drew\r\nher toward him, drew her slowly and caressingly. She could wait no\r\nlonger. With a tired sigh, and with an impulsive movement all her own,\r\nunpremeditated, spasmodic, she rested her head upon his breast. His\r\nhead bent over swiftly, and, as his lips approached, hers flew to meet\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis must be love, she thought, in the one rational moment that was\r\nvouchsafed her. If it was not love, it was too shameful. It could be\r\nnothing else than love. She loved the man whose arms were around her\r\nand whose lips were pressed to hers. She pressed more tightly to him,\r\nwith a snuggling movement of her body. And a moment later, tearing\r\nherself half out of his embrace, suddenly and exultantly she reached up\r\nand placed both hands upon Martin Eden\xe2\x80\x99s sunburnt neck. So exquisite\r\nwas the pang of love and desire fulfilled that she uttered a low moan,\r\nrelaxed her hands, and lay half-swooning in his arms.\r\n\r\nNot a word had been spoken, and not a word was spoken for a long time.\r\nTwice he bent and kissed her, and each time her lips met his shyly and\r\nher body made its happy, nestling movement. She clung to him, unable to\r\nrelease herself, and he sat, half supporting her in his arms, as he\r\ngazed with unseeing eyes at the blur of the great city across the bay.\r\nFor once there were no visions in his brain. Only colors and lights and\r\nglows pulsed there, warm as the day and warm as his love. He bent over\r\nher. She was speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the first, the very first, the first moment I laid eye on you. I\r\nwas mad for love of you then, and in all the time that has passed since\r\nthen I have only grown the madder. I am maddest, now, dear. I am almost\r\na lunatic, my head is so turned with joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad I am a woman, Martin\xe2\x80\x94dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a long sigh.\r\n\r\nHe crushed her in his arms again and again, and then asked:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you? When did you first know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I knew it all the time, almost, from the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have been as blind as a bat!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, a ring of vexation in\r\nhis voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI never dreamed it until just how, when I\xe2\x80\x94when I kissed\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that.\xe2\x80\x9d She drew herself partly away and looked at him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant I knew you loved almost from the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came to me suddenly.\xe2\x80\x9d She was speaking very slowly, her eyes warm\r\nand fluttery and melting, a soft flush on her cheeks that did not go\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew until just now when\xe2\x80\x94you put your arms around me.\r\nAnd I never expected to marry you, Martin, not until just now. How did\r\nyou make me love you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cunless just by loving you, for I loved you\r\nhard enough to melt the heart of a stone, much less the heart of the\r\nliving, breathing woman you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is so different from what I thought love would be,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced\r\nirrelevantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you think it would be like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be like this.\xe2\x80\x9d She was looking into his eyes\r\nat the moment, but her own dropped as she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what this was like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe offered to draw her toward him again, but it was no more than a\r\ntentative muscular movement of the girdling arm, for he feared that he\r\nmight be greedy. Then he felt her body yielding, and once again she was\r\nclose in his arms and lips were pressed on lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will my people say?\xe2\x80\x9d she queried, with sudden apprehension, in\r\none of the pauses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. We can find out very easily any time we are so minded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if mamma objects? I am sure I am afraid to tell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell her,\xe2\x80\x9d he volunteered valiantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI think your mother does\r\nnot like me, but I can win her around. A fellow who can win you can win\r\nanything. And if we don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have each other. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no danger not winning your\r\nmother to our marriage. She loves you too well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not like to break her heart,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth said pensively.\r\n\r\nHe felt like assuring her that mothers\xe2\x80\x99 hearts were not so easily\r\nbroken, but instead he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd love is the greatest thing in the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Martin, you sometimes frighten me. I am frightened now,\r\nwhen I think of you and of what you have been. You must be very, very\r\ngood to me. Remember, after all, that I am only a child. I never loved\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I. We are both children together. And we are fortunate above most,\r\nfor we have found our first love in each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, withdrawing herself from his arms\r\nwith a swift, passionate movement. \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible for you. You have been a\r\nsailor, and sailors, I have heard, are\xe2\x80\x94are\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice faltered and died away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre addicted to having a wife in every port?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that\r\nwhat you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not love.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke authoritatively. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been in many\r\nports, but I never knew a passing touch of love until I saw you that\r\nfirst night. Do you know, when I said good night and went away, I was\r\nalmost arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArrested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The policeman thought I was drunk; and I was, too\xe2\x80\x94with love for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said we were children, and I said it was impossible, for you,\r\nand we have strayed away from the point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said that I never loved anybody but you,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are my\r\nfirst, my very first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you have been a sailor,\xe2\x80\x9d she objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent me from loving you the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there have been women\xe2\x80\x94other women\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd to Martin Eden\xe2\x80\x99s supreme surprise, she burst into a storm of tears\r\nthat took more kisses than one and many caresses to drive away. And all\r\nthe while there was running through his head Kipling\xe2\x80\x99s line: \xe2\x80\x9c_And the\r\nColonel\xe2\x80\x99s lady and Judy O\xe2\x80\x99Grady are sisters under their skins_.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\ntrue, he decided; though the novels he had read had led him to believe\r\notherwise. His idea, for which the novels were responsible, had been\r\nthat only formal proposals obtained in the upper classes. It was all\r\nright enough, down whence he had come, for youths and maidens to win\r\neach other by contact; but for the exalted personages up above on the\r\nheights to make love in similar fashion had seemed unthinkable. Yet the\r\nnovels were wrong. Here was a proof of it. The same pressures and\r\ncaresses, unaccompanied by speech, that were efficacious with the girls\r\nof the working-class, were equally efficacious with the girls above the\r\nworking-class. They were all of the same flesh, after all, sisters\r\nunder their skins; and he might have known as much himself had he\r\nremembered his Spencer. As he held Ruth in his arms and soothed her, he\r\ntook great consolation in the thought that the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s lady and Judy\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Grady were pretty much alike under their skins. It brought Ruth\r\ncloser to him, made her possible. Her dear flesh was as anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflesh, as his flesh. There was no bar to their marriage. Class\r\ndifference was the only difference, and class was extrinsic. It could\r\nbe shaken off. A slave, he had read, had risen to the Roman purple.\r\nThat being so, then he could rise to Ruth. Under her purity, and\r\nsaintliness, and culture, and ethereal beauty of soul, she was, in\r\nthings fundamentally human, just like Lizzie Connolly and all Lizzie\r\nConnollys. All that was possible of them was possible of her. She could\r\nlove, and hate, maybe have hysterics; and she could certainly be\r\njealous, as she was jealous now, uttering her last sobs in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, I am older than you,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked suddenly, opening her eyes\r\nand looking up at him, \xe2\x80\x9cthree years older.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, you are only a child, and I am forty years older than you, in\r\nexperience,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer.\r\n\r\nIn truth, they were children together, so far as love was concerned,\r\nand they were as naive and immature in the expression of their love as\r\na pair of children, and this despite the fact that she was crammed with\r\na university education and that his head was full of scientific\r\nphilosophy and the hard facts of life.\r\n\r\nThey sat on through the passing glory of the day, talking as lovers are\r\nprone to talk, marvelling at the wonder of love and at destiny that had\r\nflung them so strangely together, and dogmatically believing that they\r\nloved to a degree never attained by lovers before. And they returned\r\ninsistently, again and again, to a rehearsal of their first impressions\r\nof each other and to hopeless attempts to analyze just precisely what\r\nthey felt for each other and how much there was of it.\r\n\r\nThe cloud-masses on the western horizon received the descending sun,\r\nand the circle of the sky turned to rose, while the zenith glowed with\r\nthe same warm color. The rosy light was all about them, flooding over\r\nthem, as she sang, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Sweet Day.\xe2\x80\x9d She sang softly, leaning in\r\nthe cradle of his arm, her hands in his, their hearts in each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Morse did not require a mother\xe2\x80\x99s intuition to read the\r\nadvertisement in Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s face when she returned home. The flush that\r\nwould not leave the cheeks told the simple story, and more eloquently\r\ndid the eyes, large and bright, reflecting an unmistakable inward\r\nglory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Morse asked, having bided her time till Ruth\r\nhad gone to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know?\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth queried, with trembling lips.\r\n\r\nFor reply, her mother\xe2\x80\x99s arm went around her, and a hand was softly\r\ncaressing her hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not speak,\xe2\x80\x9d she blurted out. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not intend that it should\r\nhappen, and I would never have let him speak\xe2\x80\x94only he didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he did not speak, then nothing could have happened, could it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it did, just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of goodness, child, what are you babbling about?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nMorse was bewildered. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I know what happened, after all.\r\nWhat did happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth looked at her mother in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you knew. Why, we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged, Martin and I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Morse laughed with incredulous vexation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth explained. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just loved me, that was all.\r\nI was as surprised as you are. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. He just put his\r\narm around me. And\xe2\x80\x94and I was not myself. And he kissed me, and I kissed\r\nhim. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I just had to. And then I knew I loved him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, waiting with expectancy the benediction of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkiss, but Mrs. Morse was coldly silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a dreadful accident, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth recommenced with a sinking\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you will ever forgive me. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it. I did not dream that I loved him until that moment. And you\r\nmust tell father for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it not be better not to tell your father? Let me see Martin\r\nEden, and talk with him, and explain. He will understand and release\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no!\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth cried, starting up. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not want to be released. I\r\nlove him, and love is very sweet. I am going to marry him\xe2\x80\x94of course, if\r\nyou will let me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have other plans for you, Ruth, dear, your father and I\xe2\x80\x94oh, no, no;\r\nno man picked out for you, or anything like that. Our plans go no\r\nfarther than your marrying some man in your own station in life, a good\r\nand honorable gentleman, whom you will select yourself, when you love\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I love Martin already,\xe2\x80\x9d was the plaintive protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe would not influence your choice in any way; but you are our\r\ndaughter, and we could not bear to see you make a marriage such as\r\nthis. He has nothing but roughness and coarseness to offer you in\r\nexchange for all that is refined and delicate in you. He is no match\r\nfor you in any way. He could not support you. We have no foolish ideas\r\nabout wealth, but comfort is another matter, and our daughter should at\r\nleast marry a man who can give her that\xe2\x80\x94and not a penniless adventurer,\r\na sailor, a cowboy, a smuggler, and Heaven knows what else, who, in\r\naddition to everything, is hare-brained and irresponsible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth was silent. Every word she recognized as true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wastes his time over his writing, trying to accomplish what\r\ngeniuses and rare men with college educations sometimes accomplish. A\r\nman thinking of marriage should be preparing for marriage. But not he.\r\nAs I have said, and I know you agree with me, he is irresponsible. And\r\nwhy should he not be? It is the way of sailors. He has never learned to\r\nbe economical or temperate. The spendthrift years have marked him. It\r\nis not his fault, of course, but that does not alter his nature. And\r\nhave you thought of the years of licentiousness he inevitably has\r\nlived? Have you thought of that, daughter? You know what marriage\r\nmeans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth shuddered and clung close to her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought.\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth waited a long time for the thought to frame\r\nitself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is terrible. It sickens me to think of it. I told you\r\nit was a dreadful accident, my loving him; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help myself.\r\nCould you help loving father? Then it is the same with me. There is\r\nsomething in me, in him\xe2\x80\x94I never knew it was there until to-day\xe2\x80\x94but it\r\nis there, and it makes me love him. I never thought to love him, but,\r\nyou see, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, a certain faint triumph in her voice.\r\n\r\nThey talked long, and to little purpose, in conclusion agreeing to wait\r\nan indeterminate time without doing anything.\r\n\r\nThe same conclusion was reached, a little later that night, between\r\nMrs. Morse and her husband, after she had made due confession of the\r\nmiscarriage of her plans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt could hardly have come otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d was Mr. Morse\xe2\x80\x99s judgment. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nsailor-fellow has been the only man she was in touch with. Sooner or\r\nlater she was going to awaken anyway; and she did awaken, and lo! here\r\nwas this sailor-fellow, the only accessible man at the moment, and of\r\ncourse she promptly loved him, or thought she did, which amounts to the\r\nsame thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Morse took it upon herself to work slowly and indirectly upon\r\nRuth, rather than to combat her. There would be plenty of time for\r\nthis, for Martin was not in position to marry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her see all she wants of him,\xe2\x80\x9d was Mr. Morse\xe2\x80\x99s advice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more\r\nshe knows him, the less she\xe2\x80\x99ll love him, I wager. And give her plenty\r\nof contrast. Make a point of having young people at the house. Young\r\nwomen and young men, all sorts of young men, clever men, men who have\r\ndone something or who are doing things, men of her own class,\r\ngentlemen. She can gauge him by them. They will show him up for what he\r\nis. And after all, he is a mere boy of twenty-one. Ruth is no more than\r\na child. It is calf love with the pair of them, and they will grow out\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the matter rested. Within the family it was accepted that Ruth and\r\nMartin were engaged, but no announcement was made. The family did not\r\nthink it would ever be necessary. Also, it was tacitly understood that\r\nit was to be a long engagement. They did not ask Martin to go to work,\r\nnor to cease writing. They did not intend to encourage him to mend\r\nhimself. And he aided and abetted them in their unfriendly designs, for\r\ngoing to work was farthest from his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99ll like what I have done!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Ruth several\r\ndays later. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve decided that boarding with my sister is too\r\nexpensive, and I am going to board myself. I\xe2\x80\x99ve rented a little room\r\nout in North Oakland, retired neighborhood and all the rest, you know,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ve bought an oil-burner on which to cook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth was overjoyed. The oil-burner especially pleased her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the way Mr. Butler began his start,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nMartin frowned inwardly at the citation of that worthy gentleman, and\r\nwent on: \xe2\x80\x9cI put stamps on all my manuscripts and started them off to\r\nthe editors again. Then to-day I moved in, and to-morrow I start to\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA position!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, betraying the gladness of her surprise in all\r\nher body, nestling closer to him, pressing his hand, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\r\nnever told me! What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant that I was going to work at my writing.\xe2\x80\x9d Her face fell, and he\r\nwent on hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t misjudge me. I am not going in this time with\r\nany iridescent ideas. It is to be a cold, prosaic, matter-of-fact\r\nbusiness proposition. It is better than going to sea again, and I shall\r\nearn more money than any position in Oakland can bring an unskilled\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, this vacation I have taken has given me perspective. I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t been working the life out of my body, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nwriting, at least not for publication. All I\xe2\x80\x99ve done has been to love\r\nyou and to think. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read some, too, but it has been part of my\r\nthinking, and I have read principally magazines. I have generalized\r\nabout myself, and the world, my place in it, and my chance to win to a\r\nplace that will be fit for you. Also, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philosophy of Style,\xe2\x80\x99 and found out a lot of what was the matter with\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94or my writing, rather; and for that matter with most of the writing\r\nthat is published every month in the magazines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the upshot of it all\xe2\x80\x94of my thinking and reading and loving\xe2\x80\x94is that\r\nI am going to move to Grub Street. I shall leave masterpieces alone and\r\ndo hack-work\xe2\x80\x94jokes, paragraphs, feature articles, humorous verse, and\r\nsociety verse\xe2\x80\x94all the rot for which there seems so much demand. Then\r\nthere are the newspaper syndicates, and the newspaper short-story\r\nsyndicates, and the syndicates for the Sunday supplements. I can go\r\nahead and hammer out the stuff they want, and earn the equivalent of a\r\ngood salary by it. There are free-lances, you know, who earn as much as\r\nfour or five hundred a month. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to become as they; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nearn a good living, and have plenty of time to myself, which I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave in any position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have my spare time for study and for real work. In between\r\nthe grind I\xe2\x80\x99ll try my hand at masterpieces, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll study and prepare\r\nmyself for the writing of masterpieces. Why, I am amazed at the\r\ndistance I have come already. When I first tried to write, I had\r\nnothing to write about except a few paltry experiences which I neither\r\nunderstood nor appreciated. But I had no thoughts. I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t even have the words with which to think. My experiences were so\r\nmany meaningless pictures. But as I began to add to my knowledge, and\r\nto my vocabulary, I saw something more in my experiences than mere\r\npictures. I retained the pictures and I found their interpretation.\r\nThat was when I began to do good work, when I wrote \xe2\x80\x98Adventure,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Joy,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Pot,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98The Wine of Life,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98The Jostling Street,\xe2\x80\x99 the \xe2\x80\x98Love-cycle,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand the \xe2\x80\x98Sea Lyrics.\xe2\x80\x99 I shall write more like them, and better; but I\r\nshall do it in my spare time. My feet are on the solid earth, now.\r\nHack-work and income first, masterpieces afterward. Just to show you, I\r\nwrote half a dozen jokes last night for the comic weeklies; and just as\r\nI was going to bed, the thought struck me to try my hand at a triolet\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhumorous one; and inside an hour I had written four. They ought to be\r\nworth a dollar apiece. Four dollars right there for a few afterthoughts\r\non the way to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s all valueless, just so much dull and sordid plodding;\r\nbut it is no more dull and sordid than keeping books at sixty dollars a\r\nmonth, adding up endless columns of meaningless figures until one dies.\r\nAnd furthermore, the hack-work keeps me in touch with things literary\r\nand gives me time to try bigger things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what good are these bigger things, these masterpieces?\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth\r\ndemanded. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t sell them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I can,\xe2\x80\x9d he began; but she interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll those you named, and which you say yourself are good\xe2\x80\x94you have not\r\nsold any of them. We can\xe2\x80\x99t get married on masterpieces that won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we\xe2\x80\x99ll get married on triolets that will sell,\xe2\x80\x9d he asserted\r\nstoutly, putting his arm around her and drawing a very unresponsive\r\nsweetheart toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to this,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on in attempted gayety. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not art, but\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a dollar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came in\r\n    When I was out,\r\nTo borrow some tin\r\nWas why he came in,\r\n    And he went without;\r\nSo I was in\r\n    And he was out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe merry lilt with which he had invested the jingle was at variance\r\nwith the dejection that came into his face as he finished. He had drawn\r\nno smile from Ruth. She was looking at him in an earnest and troubled\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a dollar,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is a jester\xe2\x80\x99s dollar, the fee\r\nof a clown. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, Martin, the whole thing is lowering. I want\r\nthe man I love and honor to be something finer and higher than a\r\nperpetrator of jokes and doggerel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want him to be like\xe2\x80\x94say Mr. Butler?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you don\xe2\x80\x99t like Mr. Butler,\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Butler\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only his indigestion I\r\nfind fault with. But to save me I can\xe2\x80\x99t see any difference between\r\nwriting jokes or comic verse and running a type-writer, taking\r\ndictation, or keeping sets of books. It is all a means to an end. Your\r\ntheory is for me to begin with keeping books in order to become a\r\nsuccessful lawyer or man of business. Mine is to begin with hack-work\r\nand develop into an able author.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a difference,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, your good work, what you yourself call good, you can\xe2\x80\x99t sell. You\r\nhave tried, you know that,\xe2\x80\x94but the editors won\xe2\x80\x99t buy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me time, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe hack-work is only makeshift, and\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t take it seriously. Give me two years. I shall succeed in that\r\ntime, and the editors will be glad to buy my good work. I know what I\r\nam saying; I have faith in myself. I know what I have in me; I know\r\nwhat literature is, now; I know the average rot that is poured out by a\r\nlot of little men; and I know that at the end of two years I shall be\r\non the highroad to success. As for business, I shall never succeed at\r\nit. I am not in sympathy with it. It strikes me as dull, and stupid,\r\nand mercenary, and tricky. Anyway I am not adapted for it. I\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\nget beyond a clerkship, and how could you and I be happy on the paltry\r\nearnings of a clerk? I want the best of everything in the world for\r\nyou, and the only time when I won\xe2\x80\x99t want it will be when there is\r\nsomething better. And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get it, going to get all of it. The\r\nincome of a successful author makes Mr. Butler look cheap. A\r\n\xe2\x80\x98best-seller\xe2\x80\x99 will earn anywhere between fifty and a hundred thousand\r\ndollars\xe2\x80\x94sometimes more and sometimes less; but, as a rule, pretty close\r\nto those figures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained silent; her disappointment was apparent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had hoped and planned otherwise. I had thought, and I still think,\r\nthat the best thing for you would be to study shorthand\xe2\x80\x94you already\r\nknow type-writing\xe2\x80\x94and go into father\xe2\x80\x99s office. You have a good mind,\r\nand I am confident you would succeed as a lawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Ruth had little faith in his power as a writer, did not alter her\r\nnor diminish her in Martin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. In the breathing spell of the\r\nvacation he had taken, he had spent many hours in self-analysis, and\r\nthereby learned much of himself. He had discovered that he loved beauty\r\nmore than fame, and that what desire he had for fame was largely for\r\nRuth\xe2\x80\x99s sake. It was for this reason that his desire for fame was\r\nstrong. He wanted to be great in the world\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cto make good,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nhe expressed it, in order that the woman he loved should be proud of\r\nhim and deem him worthy.\r\n\r\nAs for himself, he loved beauty passionately, and the joy of serving\r\nher was to him sufficient wage. And more than beauty he loved Ruth. He\r\nconsidered love the finest thing in the world. It was love that had\r\nworked the revolution in him, changing him from an uncouth sailor to a\r\nstudent and an artist; therefore, to him, the finest and greatest of\r\nthe three, greater than learning and artistry, was love. Already he had\r\ndiscovered that his brain went beyond Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s, just as it went beyond\r\nthe brains of her brothers, or the brain of her father. In spite of\r\nevery advantage of university training, and in the face of her\r\nbachelorship of arts, his power of intellect overshadowed hers, and his\r\nyear or so of self-study and equipment gave him a mastery of the\r\naffairs of the world and art and life that she could never hope to\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nAll this he realized, but it did not affect his love for her, nor her\r\nlove for him. Love was too fine and noble, and he was too loyal a lover\r\nfor him to besmirch love with criticism. What did love have to do with\r\nRuth\xe2\x80\x99s divergent views on art, right conduct, the French Revolution, or\r\nequal suffrage? They were mental processes, but love was beyond reason;\r\nit was superrational. He could not belittle love. He worshipped it.\r\nLove lay on the mountain-tops beyond the valley-land of reason. It was\r\na sublimated condition of existence, the topmost peak of living, and it\r\ncame rarely. Thanks to the school of scientific philosophers he\r\nfavored, he knew the biological significance of love; but by a refined\r\nprocess of the same scientific reasoning he reached the conclusion that\r\nthe human organism achieved its highest purpose in love, that love must\r\nnot be questioned, but must be accepted as the highest guerdon of life.\r\nThus, he considered the lover blessed over all creatures, and it was a\r\ndelight to him to think of \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s own mad lover,\xe2\x80\x9d rising above the\r\nthings of earth, above wealth and judgment, public opinion and\r\napplause, rising above life itself and \xe2\x80\x9cdying on a kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch of this Martin had already reasoned out, and some of it he\r\nreasoned out later. In the meantime he worked, taking no recreation\r\nexcept when he went to see Ruth, and living like a Spartan. He paid two\r\ndollars and a half a month rent for the small room he got from his\r\nPortuguese landlady, Maria Silva, a virago and a widow, hard working\r\nand harsher tempered, rearing her large brood of children somehow, and\r\ndrowning her sorrow and fatigue at irregular intervals in a gallon of\r\nthe thin, sour wine that she bought from the corner grocery and saloon\r\nfor fifteen cents. From detesting her and her foul tongue at first,\r\nMartin grew to admire her as he observed the brave fight she made.\r\nThere were but four rooms in the little house\xe2\x80\x94three, when Martin\xe2\x80\x99s was\r\nsubtracted. One of these, the parlor, gay with an ingrain carpet and\r\ndolorous with a funeral card and a death-picture of one of her numerous\r\ndeparted babes, was kept strictly for company. The blinds were always\r\ndown, and her barefooted tribe was never permitted to enter the sacred\r\nprecinct save on state occasions. She cooked, and all ate, in the\r\nkitchen, where she likewise washed, starched, and ironed clothes on all\r\ndays of the week except Sunday; for her income came largely from taking\r\nin washing from her more prosperous neighbors. Remained the bedroom,\r\nsmall as the one occupied by Martin, into which she and her seven\r\nlittle ones crowded and slept. It was an everlasting miracle to Martin\r\nhow it was accomplished, and from her side of the thin partition he\r\nheard nightly every detail of the going to bed, the squalls and\r\nsquabbles, the soft chattering, and the sleepy, twittering noises as of\r\nbirds. Another source of income to Maria were her cows, two of them,\r\nwhich she milked night and morning and which gained a surreptitious\r\nlivelihood from vacant lots and the grass that grew on either side the\r\npublic side walks, attended always by one or more of her ragged boys,\r\nwhose watchful guardianship consisted chiefly in keeping their eyes out\r\nfor the poundmen.\r\n\r\nIn his own small room Martin lived, slept, studied, wrote, and kept\r\nhouse. Before the one window, looking out on the tiny front porch, was\r\nthe kitchen table that served as desk, library, and type-writing stand.\r\nThe bed, against the rear wall, occupied two-thirds of the total space\r\nof the room. The table was flanked on one side by a gaudy bureau,\r\nmanufactured for profit and not for service, the thin veneer of which\r\nwas shed day by day. This bureau stood in the corner, and in the\r\nopposite corner, on the table\xe2\x80\x99s other flank, was the kitchen\xe2\x80\x94the\r\noil-stove on a dry-goods box, inside of which were dishes and cooking\r\nutensils, a shelf on the wall for provisions, and a bucket of water on\r\nthe floor. Martin had to carry his water from the kitchen sink, there\r\nbeing no tap in his room. On days when there was much steam to his\r\ncooking, the harvest of veneer from the bureau was unusually generous.\r\nOver the bed, hoisted by a tackle to the ceiling, was his bicycle. At\r\nfirst he had tried to keep it in the basement; but the tribe of Silva,\r\nloosening the bearings and puncturing the tires, had driven him out.\r\nNext he attempted the tiny front porch, until a howling southeaster\r\ndrenched the wheel a night-long. Then he had retreated with it to his\r\nroom and slung it aloft.\r\n\r\nA small closet contained his clothes and the books he had accumulated\r\nand for which there was no room on the table or under the table. Hand\r\nin hand with reading, he had developed the habit of making notes, and\r\nso copiously did he make them that there would have been no existence\r\nfor him in the confined quarters had he not rigged several\r\nclothes-lines across the room on which the notes were hung. Even so, he\r\nwas crowded until navigating the room was a difficult task. He could\r\nnot open the door without first closing the closet door, and _vice\r\nversa_. It was impossible for him anywhere to traverse the room in a\r\nstraight line. To go from the door to the head of the bed was a zigzag\r\ncourse that he was never quite able to accomplish in the dark without\r\ncollisions. Having settled the difficulty of the conflicting doors, he\r\nhad to steer sharply to the right to avoid the kitchen. Next, he\r\nsheered to the left, to escape the foot of the bed; but this sheer, if\r\ntoo generous, brought him against the corner of the table. With a\r\nsudden twitch and lurch, he terminated the sheer and bore off to the\r\nright along a sort of canal, one bank of which was the bed, the other\r\nthe table. When the one chair in the room was at its usual place before\r\nthe table, the canal was unnavigable. When the chair was not in use, it\r\nreposed on top of the bed, though sometimes he sat on the chair when\r\ncooking, reading a book while the water boiled, and even becoming\r\nskilful enough to manage a paragraph or two while steak was frying.\r\nAlso, so small was the little corner that constituted the kitchen, he\r\nwas able, sitting down, to reach anything he needed. In fact, it was\r\nexpedient to cook sitting down; standing up, he was too often in his\r\nown way.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with a perfect stomach that could digest anything, he\r\npossessed knowledge of the various foods that were at the same time\r\nnutritious and cheap. Pea-soup was a common article in his diet, as\r\nwell as potatoes and beans, the latter large and brown and cooked in\r\nMexican style. Rice, cooked as American housewives never cook it and\r\ncan never learn to cook it, appeared on Martin\xe2\x80\x99s table at least once a\r\nday. Dried fruits were less expensive than fresh, and he had usually a\r\npot of them, cooked and ready at hand, for they took the place of\r\nbutter on his bread. Occasionally he graced his table with a piece of\r\nround-steak, or with a soup-bone. Coffee, without cream or milk, he had\r\ntwice a day, in the evening substituting tea; but both coffee and tea\r\nwere excellently cooked.\r\n\r\nThere was need for him to be economical. His vacation had consumed\r\nnearly all he had earned in the laundry, and he was so far from his\r\nmarket that weeks must elapse before he could hope for the first\r\nreturns from his hack-work. Except at such times as he saw Ruth, or\r\ndropped in to see his sister Gertude, he lived a recluse, in each day\r\naccomplishing at least three days\xe2\x80\x99 labor of ordinary men. He slept a\r\nscant five hours, and only one with a constitution of iron could have\r\nheld himself down, as Martin did, day after day, to nineteen\r\nconsecutive hours of toil. He never lost a moment. On the looking-glass\r\nwere lists of definitions and pronunciations; when shaving, or\r\ndressing, or combing his hair, he conned these lists over. Similar\r\nlists were on the wall over the oil-stove, and they were similarly\r\nconned while he was engaged in cooking or in washing the dishes. New\r\nlists continually displaced the old ones. Every strange or partly\r\nfamiliar word encountered in his reading was immediately jotted down,\r\nand later, when a sufficient number had been accumulated, were typed\r\nand pinned to the wall or looking-glass. He even carried them in his\r\npockets, and reviewed them at odd moments on the street, or while\r\nwaiting in butcher shop or grocery to be served.\r\n\r\nHe went farther in the matter. Reading the works of men who had\r\narrived, he noted every result achieved by them, and worked out the\r\ntricks by which they had been achieved\xe2\x80\x94the tricks of narrative, of\r\nexposition, of style, the points of view, the contrasts, the epigrams;\r\nand of all these he made lists for study. He did not ape. He sought\r\nprinciples. He drew up lists of effective and fetching mannerisms, till\r\nout of many such, culled from many writers, he was able to induce the\r\ngeneral principle of mannerism, and, thus equipped, to cast about for\r\nnew and original ones of his own, and to weigh and measure and appraise\r\nthem properly. In similar manner he collected lists of strong phrases,\r\nthe phrases of living language, phrases that bit like acid and scorched\r\nlike flame, or that glowed and were mellow and luscious in the midst of\r\nthe arid desert of common speech. He sought always for the principle\r\nthat lay behind and beneath. He wanted to know how the thing was done;\r\nafter that he could do it for himself. He was not content with the fair\r\nface of beauty. He dissected beauty in his crowded little bedroom\r\nlaboratory, where cooking smells alternated with the outer bedlam of\r\nthe Silva tribe; and, having dissected and learned the anatomy of\r\nbeauty, he was nearer being able to create beauty itself.\r\n\r\nHe was so made that he could work only with understanding. He could not\r\nwork blindly, in the dark, ignorant of what he was producing and\r\ntrusting to chance and the star of his genius that the effect produced\r\nshould be right and fine. He had no patience with chance effects. He\r\nwanted to know why and how. His was deliberate creative genius, and,\r\nbefore he began a story or poem, the thing itself was already alive in\r\nhis brain, with the end in sight and the means of realizing that end in\r\nhis conscious possession. Otherwise the effort was doomed to failure.\r\nOn the other hand, he appreciated the chance effects in words and\r\nphrases that came lightly and easily into his brain, and that later\r\nstood all tests of beauty and power and developed tremendous and\r\nincommunicable connotations. Before such he bowed down and marvelled,\r\nknowing that they were beyond the deliberate creation of any man. And\r\nno matter how much he dissected beauty in search of the principles that\r\nunderlie beauty and make beauty possible, he was aware, always, of the\r\ninnermost mystery of beauty to which he did not penetrate and to which\r\nno man had ever penetrated. He knew full well, from his Spencer, that\r\nman can never attain ultimate knowledge of anything, and that the\r\nmystery of beauty was no less than that of life\xe2\x80\x94nay, more\xe2\x80\x94that the\r\nfibres of beauty and life were intertwisted, and that he himself was\r\nbut a bit of the same nonunderstandable fabric, twisted of sunshine and\r\nstar-dust and wonder.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was when filled with these thoughts that he wrote his essay\r\nentitled \xe2\x80\x9cStar-dust,\xe2\x80\x9d in which he had his fling, not at the principles\r\nof criticism, but at the principal critics. It was brilliant, deep,\r\nphilosophical, and deliciously touched with laughter. Also it was\r\npromptly rejected by the magazines as often as it was submitted. But\r\nhaving cleared his mind of it, he went serenely on his way. It was a\r\nhabit he developed, of incubating and maturing his thought upon a\r\nsubject, and of then rushing into the type-writer with it. That it did\r\nnot see print was a matter of small moment with him. The writing of it\r\nwas the culminating act of a long mental process, the drawing together\r\nof scattered threads of thought and the final generalizing upon all the\r\ndata with which his mind was burdened. To write such an article was the\r\nconscious effort by which he freed his mind and made it ready for fresh\r\nmaterial and problems. It was in a way akin to that common habit of men\r\nand women troubled by real or fancied grievances, who periodically and\r\nvolubly break their long-suffering silence and \xe2\x80\x9chave their say\xe2\x80\x9d till\r\nthe last word is said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weeks passed. Martin ran out of money, and publishers\xe2\x80\x99 checks were\r\nfar away as ever. All his important manuscripts had come back and been\r\nstarted out again, and his hack-work fared no better. His little\r\nkitchen was no longer graced with a variety of foods. Caught in the\r\npinch with a part sack of rice and a few pounds of dried apricots, rice\r\nand apricots was his menu three times a day for five days hand-running.\r\nThen he startled to realize on his credit. The Portuguese grocer, to\r\nwhom he had hitherto paid cash, called a halt when Martin\xe2\x80\x99s bill\r\nreached the magnificent total of three dollars and eighty-five cents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the grocer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou no catcha da work, I losa da\r\nmon\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Martin could reply nothing. There was no way of explaining. It was\r\nnot true business principle to allow credit to a strong-bodied young\r\nfellow of the working-class who was too lazy to work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou catcha da job, I let you have mora da grub,\xe2\x80\x9d the grocer assured\r\nMartin. \xe2\x80\x9cNo job, no grub. Thata da business.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, to show that it\r\nwas purely business foresight and not prejudice, \xe2\x80\x9cHava da drink on da\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94good friends justa da same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Martin drank, in his easy way, to show that he was good friends with\r\nthe house, and then went supperless to bed.\r\n\r\nThe fruit store, where Martin had bought his vegetables, was run by an\r\nAmerican whose business principles were so weak that he let Martin run\r\na bill of five dollars before stopping his credit. The baker stopped at\r\ntwo dollars, and the butcher at four dollars. Martin added his debts\r\nand found that he was possessed of a total credit in all the world of\r\nfourteen dollars and eighty-five cents. He was up with his type-writer\r\nrent, but he estimated that he could get two months\xe2\x80\x99 credit on that,\r\nwhich would be eight dollars. When that occurred, he would have\r\nexhausted all possible credit.\r\n\r\nThe last purchase from the fruit store had been a sack of potatoes, and\r\nfor a week he had potatoes, and nothing but potatoes, three times a\r\nday. An occasional dinner at Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s helped to keep strength in his\r\nbody, though he found it tantalizing enough to refuse further helping\r\nwhen his appetite was raging at sight of so much food spread before it.\r\nNow and again, though afflicted with secret shame, he dropped in at his\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s at meal-time and ate as much as he dared\xe2\x80\x94more than he dared at\r\nthe Morse table.\r\n\r\nDay by day he worked on, and day by day the postman delivered to him\r\nrejected manuscripts. He had no money for stamps, so the manuscripts\r\naccumulated in a heap under the table. Came a day when for forty hours\r\nhe had not tasted food. He could not hope for a meal at Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s, for she\r\nwas away to San Rafael on a two weeks\xe2\x80\x99 visit; and for very shame\xe2\x80\x99s sake\r\nhe could not go to his sister\xe2\x80\x99s. To cap misfortune, the postman, in his\r\nafternoon round, brought him five returned manuscripts. Then it was\r\nthat Martin wore his overcoat down into Oakland, and came back without\r\nit, but with five dollars tinkling in his pocket. He paid a dollar each\r\non account to the four tradesmen, and in his kitchen fried steak and\r\nonions, made coffee, and stewed a large pot of prunes. And having\r\ndined, he sat down at his table-desk and completed before midnight an\r\nessay which he entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dignity of Usury.\xe2\x80\x9d Having typed it out, he\r\nflung it under the table, for there had been nothing left from the five\r\ndollars with which to buy stamps.\r\n\r\nLater on he pawned his watch, and still later his wheel, reducing the\r\namount available for food by putting stamps on all his manuscripts and\r\nsending them out. He was disappointed with his hack-work. Nobody cared\r\nto buy. He compared it with what he found in the newspapers, weeklies,\r\nand cheap magazines, and decided that his was better, far better, than\r\nthe average; yet it would not sell. Then he discovered that most of the\r\nnewspapers printed a great deal of what was called \xe2\x80\x9cplate\xe2\x80\x9d stuff, and\r\nhe got the address of the association that furnished it. His own work\r\nthat he sent in was returned, along with a stereotyped slip informing\r\nhim that the staff supplied all the copy that was needed.\r\n\r\nIn one of the great juvenile periodicals he noted whole columns of\r\nincident and anecdote. Here was a chance. His paragraphs were returned,\r\nand though he tried repeatedly he never succeeded in placing one. Later\r\non, when it no longer mattered, he learned that the associate editors\r\nand sub-editors augmented their salaries by supplying those paragraphs\r\nthemselves. The comic weeklies returned his jokes and humorous verse,\r\nand the light society verse he wrote for the large magazines found no\r\nabiding-place. Then there was the newspaper storiette. He knew that he\r\ncould write better ones than were published. Managing to obtain the\r\naddresses of two newspaper syndicates, he deluged them with storiettes.\r\nWhen he had written twenty and failed to place one of them, he ceased.\r\nAnd yet, from day to day, he read storiettes in the dailies and\r\nweeklies, scores and scores of storiettes, not one of which would\r\ncompare with his. In his despondency, he concluded that he had no\r\njudgment whatever, that he was hypnotized by what he wrote, and that he\r\nwas a self-deluded pretender.\r\n\r\nThe inhuman editorial machine ran smoothly as ever. He folded the\r\nstamps in with his manuscript, dropped it into the letter-box, and from\r\nthree weeks to a month afterward the postman came up the steps and\r\nhanded him the manuscript. Surely there were no live, warm editors at\r\nthe other end. It was all wheels and cogs and oil-cups\xe2\x80\x94a clever\r\nmechanism operated by automatons. He reached stages of despair wherein\r\nhe doubted if editors existed at all. He had never received a sign of\r\nthe existence of one, and from absence of judgment in rejecting all he\r\nwrote it seemed plausible that editors were myths, manufactured and\r\nmaintained by office boys, typesetters, and pressmen.\r\n\r\nThe hours he spent with Ruth were the only happy ones he had, and they\r\nwere not all happy. He was afflicted always with a gnawing\r\nrestlessness, more tantalizing than in the old days before he possessed\r\nher love; for now that he did possess her love, the possession of her\r\nwas far away as ever. He had asked for two years; time was flying, and\r\nhe was achieving nothing. Again, he was always conscious of the fact\r\nthat she did not approve what he was doing. She did not say so\r\ndirectly. Yet indirectly she let him understand it as clearly and\r\ndefinitely as she could have spoken it. It was not resentment with her,\r\nbut disapproval; though less sweet-natured women might have resented\r\nwhere she was no more than disappointed. Her disappointment lay in that\r\nthis man she had taken to mould, refused to be moulded. To a certain\r\nextent she had found his clay plastic, then it had developed\r\nstubbornness, declining to be shaped in the image of her father or of\r\nMr. Butler.\r\n\r\nWhat was great and strong in him, she missed, or, worse yet,\r\nmisunderstood. This man, whose clay was so plastic that he could live\r\nin any number of pigeonholes of human existence, she thought wilful and\r\nmost obstinate because she could not shape him to live in her\r\npigeonhole, which was the only one she knew. She could not follow the\r\nflights of his mind, and when his brain got beyond her, she deemed him\r\nerratic. Nobody else\xe2\x80\x99s brain ever got beyond her. She could always\r\nfollow her father and mother, her brothers and Olney; wherefore, when\r\nshe could not follow Martin, she believed the fault lay with him. It\r\nwas the old tragedy of insularity trying to serve as mentor to the\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou worship at the shrine of the established,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her once, in a\r\ndiscussion they had over Praps and Vanderwater. \xe2\x80\x9cI grant that as\r\nauthorities to quote they are most excellent\xe2\x80\x94the two foremost literary\r\ncritics in the United States. Every school teacher in the land looks up\r\nto Vanderwater as the Dean of American criticism. Yet I read his stuff,\r\nand it seems to me the perfection of the felicitous expression of the\r\ninane. Why, he is no more than a ponderous bromide, thanks to Gelett\r\nBurgess. And Praps is no better. His \xe2\x80\x98Hemlock Mosses,\xe2\x80\x99 for instance is\r\nbeautifully written. Not a comma is out of place; and the tone\xe2\x80\x94ah!\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nlofty, so lofty. He is the best-paid critic in the United States.\r\nThough, Heaven forbid! he\xe2\x80\x99s not a critic at all. They do criticism\r\nbetter in England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the point is, they sound the popular note, and they sound it so\r\nbeautifully and morally and contentedly. Their reviews remind me of a\r\nBritish Sunday. They are the popular mouthpieces. They back up your\r\nprofessors of English, and your professors of English back them up. And\r\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t an original idea in any of their skulls. They know only the\r\nestablished,\xe2\x80\x94in fact, they are the established. They are weak minded,\r\nand the established impresses itself upon them as easily as the name of\r\nthe brewery is impressed on a beer bottle. And their function is to\r\ncatch all the young fellows attending the university, to drive out of\r\ntheir minds any glimmering originality that may chance to be there, and\r\nto put upon them the stamp of the established.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I am nearer the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I stand by the\r\nestablished, than you are, raging around like an iconoclastic South Sea\r\nIslander.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the missionary who did the image breaking,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nunfortunately, all the missionaries are off among the heathen, so there\r\nare none left at home to break those old images, Mr. Vanderwater and\r\nMr. Praps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the college professors, as well,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; the science professors should\r\nlive. They\xe2\x80\x99re really great. But it would be a good deed to break the\r\nheads of nine-tenths of the English professors\xe2\x80\x94little,\r\nmicroscopic-minded parrots!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhich was rather severe on the professors, but which to Ruth was\r\nblasphemy. She could not help but measure the professors, neat,\r\nscholarly, in fitting clothes, speaking in well-modulated voices,\r\nbreathing of culture and refinement, with this almost indescribable\r\nyoung fellow whom somehow she loved, whose clothes never would fit him,\r\nwhose heavy muscles told of damning toil, who grew excited when he\r\ntalked, substituting abuse for calm statement and passionate utterance\r\nfor cool self-possession. They at least earned good salaries and\r\nwere\xe2\x80\x94yes, she compelled herself to face it\xe2\x80\x94were gentlemen; while he\r\ncould not earn a penny, and he was not as they.\r\n\r\nShe did not weigh Martin\xe2\x80\x99s words nor judge his argument by them. Her\r\nconclusion that his argument was wrong was reached\xe2\x80\x94unconsciously, it is\r\ntrue\xe2\x80\x94by a comparison of externals. They, the professors, were right in\r\ntheir literary judgments because they were successes. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s literary\r\njudgments were wrong because he could not sell his wares. To use his\r\nown phrase, they made good, and he did not make good. And besides, it\r\ndid not seem reasonable that he should be right\xe2\x80\x94he who had stood, so\r\nshort a time before, in that same living room, blushing and awkward,\r\nacknowledging his introduction, looking fearfully about him at the\r\nbric-a-brac his swinging shoulders threatened to break, asking how long\r\nsince Swinburne died, and boastfully announcing that he had read\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcelsior\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cPsalm of Life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnwittingly, Ruth herself proved his point that she worshipped the\r\nestablished. Martin followed the processes of her thoughts, but forbore\r\nto go farther. He did not love her for what she thought of Praps and\r\nVanderwater and English professors, and he was coming to realize, with\r\nincreasing conviction, that he possessed brain-areas and stretches of\r\nknowledge which she could never comprehend nor know existed.\r\n\r\nIn music she thought him unreasonable, and in the matter of opera not\r\nonly unreasonable but wilfully perverse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked him one night, on the way home from\r\nthe opera.\r\n\r\nIt was a night when he had taken her at the expense of a month\xe2\x80\x99s rigid\r\neconomizing on food. After vainly waiting for him to speak about it,\r\nherself still tremulous and stirred by what she had just seen and\r\nheard, she had asked the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI liked the overture,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was splendid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but the opera itself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was splendid too; that is, the orchestra was, though I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nenjoyed it more if those jumping-jacks had kept quiet or gone off the\r\nstage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth was aghast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean Tetralani or Barillo?\xe2\x80\x9d she queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of them\xe2\x80\x94the whole kit and crew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are great artists,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey spoiled the music just the same, with their antics and\r\nunrealities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you like Barillo\xe2\x80\x99s voice?\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is next to\r\nCaruso, they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I liked him, and I liked Tetralani even better. Her voice is\r\nexquisite\xe2\x80\x94or at least I think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean, then. You\r\nadmire their voices, yet say they spoiled the music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely that. I\xe2\x80\x99d give anything to hear them in concert, and I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngive even a bit more not to hear them when the orchestra is playing.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I am a hopeless realist. Great singers are not great actors.\r\nTo hear Barillo sing a love passage with the voice of an angel, and to\r\nhear Tetralani reply like another angel, and to hear it all accompanied\r\nby a perfect orgy of glowing and colorful music\xe2\x80\x94is ravishing, most\r\nravishing. I do not admit it. I assert it. But the whole effect is\r\nspoiled when I look at them\xe2\x80\x94at Tetralani, five feet ten in her stocking\r\nfeet and weighing a hundred and ninety pounds, and at Barillo, a scant\r\nfive feet four, greasy-featured, with the chest of a squat, undersized\r\nblacksmith, and at the pair of them, attitudinizing, clasping their\r\nbreasts, flinging their arms in the air like demented creatures in an\r\nasylum; and when I am expected to accept all this as the faithful\r\nillusion of a love-scene between a slender and beautiful princess and a\r\nhandsome, romantic, young prince\xe2\x80\x94why, I can\xe2\x80\x99t accept it, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s rot; it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd; it\xe2\x80\x99s unreal. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with it.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not real. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that anybody in this world ever made love\r\nthat way. Why, if I\xe2\x80\x99d made love to you in such fashion, you\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nboxed my ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you misunderstand,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth protested. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery form of art has its\r\nlimitations.\xe2\x80\x9d (She was busy recalling a lecture she had heard at the\r\nuniversity on the conventions of the arts.) \xe2\x80\x9cIn painting there are only\r\ntwo dimensions to the canvas, yet you accept the illusion of three\r\ndimensions which the art of a painter enables him to throw into the\r\ncanvas. In writing, again, the author must be omnipotent. You accept as\r\nperfectly legitimate the author\xe2\x80\x99s account of the secret thoughts of the\r\nheroine, and yet all the time you know that the heroine was alone when\r\nthinking these thoughts, and that neither the author nor any one else\r\nwas capable of hearing them. And so with the stage, with sculpture,\r\nwith opera, with every art form. Certain irreconcilable things must be\r\naccepted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I understood that,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the arts have their\r\nconventions.\xe2\x80\x9d (Ruth was surprised at his use of the word. It was as if\r\nhe had studied at the university himself, instead of being ill-equipped\r\nfrom browsing at haphazard through the books in the library.) \xe2\x80\x9cBut even\r\nthe conventions must be real. Trees, painted on flat cardboard and\r\nstuck up on each side of the stage, we accept as a forest. It is a real\r\nenough convention. But, on the other hand, we would not accept a sea\r\nscene as a forest. We can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. It violates our senses. Nor would\r\nyou, or, rather, should you, accept the ravings and writhings and\r\nagonized contortions of those two lunatics to-night as a convincing\r\nportrayal of love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t hold yourself superior to all the judges of music?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nprotested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not for a moment. I merely maintain my right as an individual.\r\nI have just been telling you what I think, in order to explain why the\r\nelephantine gambols of Madame Tetralani spoil the orchestra for me. The\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s judges of music may all be right. But I am I, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsubordinate my taste to the unanimous judgment of mankind. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike a thing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, that\xe2\x80\x99s all; and there is no reason under\r\nthe sun why I should ape a liking for it just because the majority of\r\nmy fellow-creatures like it, or make believe they like it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfollow the fashions in the things I like or dislike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut music, you know, is a matter of training,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth argued; \xe2\x80\x9cand opera\r\nis even more a matter of training. May it not be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I am not trained in opera?\xe2\x80\x9d he dashed in.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I consider I am fortunate in not\r\nhaving been caught when I was young. If I had, I could have wept\r\nsentimental tears to-night, and the clownish antics of that precious\r\npair would have but enhanced the beauty of their voices and the beauty\r\nof the accompanying orchestra. You are right. It\xe2\x80\x99s mostly a matter of\r\ntraining. And I am too old, now. I must have the real or nothing. An\r\nillusion that won\xe2\x80\x99t convince is a palpable lie, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what grand\r\nopera is to me when little Barillo throws a fit, clutches mighty\r\nTetralani in his arms (also in a fit), and tells her how passionately\r\nhe adores her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Ruth measured his thoughts by comparison of externals and in\r\naccordance with her belief in the established. Who was he that he\r\nshould be right and all the cultured world wrong? His words and\r\nthoughts made no impression upon her. She was too firmly intrenched in\r\nthe established to have any sympathy with revolutionary ideas. She had\r\nalways been used to music, and she had enjoyed opera ever since she was\r\na child, and all her world had enjoyed it, too. Then by what right did\r\nMartin Eden emerge, as he had so recently emerged, from his rag-time\r\nand working-class songs, and pass judgment on the world\xe2\x80\x99s music? She\r\nwas vexed with him, and as she walked beside him she had a vague\r\nfeeling of outrage. At the best, in her most charitable frame of mind,\r\nshe considered the statement of his views to be a caprice, an erratic\r\nand uncalled-for prank. But when he took her in his arms at the door\r\nand kissed her good night in tender lover-fashion, she forgot\r\neverything in the outrush of her own love to him. And later, on a\r\nsleepless pillow, she puzzled, as she had often puzzled of late, as to\r\nhow it was that she loved so strange a man, and loved him despite the\r\ndisapproval of her people.\r\n\r\nAnd next day Martin Eden cast hack-work aside, and at white heat\r\nhammered out an essay to which he gave the title, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Philosophy of\r\nIllusion.\xe2\x80\x9d A stamp started it on its travels, but it was destined to\r\nreceive many stamps and to be started on many travels in the months\r\nthat followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaria Silva was poor, and all the ways of poverty were clear to her.\r\nPoverty, to Ruth, was a word signifying a not-nice condition of\r\nexistence. That was her total knowledge on the subject. She knew Martin\r\nwas poor, and his condition she associated in her mind with the boyhood\r\nof Abraham Lincoln, of Mr. Butler, and of other men who had become\r\nsuccesses. Also, while aware that poverty was anything but delectable,\r\nshe had a comfortable middle-class feeling that poverty was salutary,\r\nthat it was a sharp spur that urged on to success all men who were not\r\ndegraded and hopeless drudges. So that her knowledge that Martin was so\r\npoor that he had pawned his watch and overcoat did not disturb her. She\r\neven considered it the hopeful side of the situation, believing that\r\nsooner or later it would arouse him and compel him to abandon his\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nRuth never read hunger in Martin\xe2\x80\x99s face, which had grown lean and had\r\nenlarged the slight hollows in the cheeks. In fact, she marked the\r\nchange in his face with satisfaction. It seemed to refine him, to\r\nremove from him much of the dross of flesh and the too animal-like\r\nvigor that lured her while she detested it. Sometimes, when with her,\r\nshe noted an unusual brightness in his eyes, and she admired it, for it\r\nmade him appear more the poet and the scholar\xe2\x80\x94the things he would have\r\nliked to be and which she would have liked him to be. But Maria Silva\r\nread a different tale in the hollow cheeks and the burning eyes, and\r\nshe noted the changes in them from day to day, by them following the\r\nebb and flow of his fortunes. She saw him leave the house with his\r\novercoat and return without it, though the day was chill and raw, and\r\npromptly she saw his cheeks fill out slightly and the fire of hunger\r\nleave his eyes. In the same way she had seen his wheel and watch go,\r\nand after each event she had seen his vigor bloom again.\r\n\r\nLikewise she watched his toils, and knew the measure of the midnight\r\noil he burned. Work! She knew that he outdid her, though his work was\r\nof a different order. And she was surprised to behold that the less\r\nfood he had, the harder he worked. On occasion, in a casual sort of\r\nway, when she thought hunger pinched hardest, she would send him in a\r\nloaf of new baking, awkwardly covering the act with banter to the\r\neffect that it was better than he could bake. And again, she would send\r\none of her toddlers in to him with a great pitcher of hot soup,\r\ndebating inwardly the while whether she was justified in taking it from\r\nthe mouths of her own flesh and blood. Nor was Martin ungrateful,\r\nknowing as he did the lives of the poor, and that if ever in the world\r\nthere was charity, this was it.\r\n\r\nOn a day when she had filled her brood with what was left in the house,\r\nMaria invested her last fifteen cents in a gallon of cheap wine.\r\nMartin, coming into her kitchen to fetch water, was invited to sit down\r\nand drink. He drank her very-good health, and in return she drank his.\r\nThen she drank to prosperity in his undertakings, and he drank to the\r\nhope that James Grant would show up and pay her for his washing. James\r\nGrant was a journeymen carpenter who did not always pay his bills and\r\nwho owed Maria three dollars.\r\n\r\nBoth Maria and Martin drank the sour new wine on empty stomachs, and it\r\nwent swiftly to their heads. Utterly differentiated creatures that they\r\nwere, they were lonely in their misery, and though the misery was\r\ntacitly ignored, it was the bond that drew them together. Maria was\r\namazed to learn that he had been in the Azores, where she had lived\r\nuntil she was eleven. She was doubly amazed that he had been in the\r\nHawaiian Islands, whither she had migrated from the Azores with her\r\npeople. But her amazement passed all bounds when he told her he had\r\nbeen on Maui, the particular island whereon she had attained womanhood\r\nand married. Kahului, where she had first met her husband,\xe2\x80\x94he, Martin,\r\nhad been there twice! Yes, she remembered the sugar steamers, and he\r\nhad been on them\xe2\x80\x94well, well, it was a small world. And Wailuku! That\r\nplace, too! Did he know the head-luna of the plantation? Yes, and had\r\nhad a couple of drinks with him.\r\n\r\nAnd so they reminiscenced and drowned their hunger in the raw, sour\r\nwine. To Martin the future did not seem so dim. Success trembled just\r\nbefore him. He was on the verge of clasping it. Then he studied the\r\ndeep-lined face of the toil-worn woman before him, remembered her soups\r\nand loaves of new baking, and felt spring up in him the warmest\r\ngratitude and philanthropy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaria,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you like to have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, bepuzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you like to have now, right now, if you could get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShoe alla da roun\xe2\x80\x99 for da childs\xe2\x80\x94seven pairs da shoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have them,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, while she nodded her head gravely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I mean a big wish, something big that you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes sparkled good-naturedly. He was choosing to make fun with her,\r\nMaria, with whom few made fun these days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink hard,\xe2\x80\x9d he cautioned, just as she was opening her mouth to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlla right,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI thinka da hard. I lika da house, dis\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94all mine, no paya da rent, seven dollar da month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have it,\xe2\x80\x9d he granted, \xe2\x80\x9cand in a short time. Now wish the\r\ngreat wish. Make believe I am God, and I say to you anything you want\r\nyou can have. Then you wish that thing, and I listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria considered solemnly for a space.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou no \xe2\x80\x99fraid?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked warningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid. Go ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost verra big,\xe2\x80\x9d she warned again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Fire away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, den\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She drew a big breath like a child, as she voiced to the\r\nuttermost all she cared to demand of life. \xe2\x80\x9cI lika da have one milka\r\nranch\xe2\x80\x94good milka ranch. Plenty cow, plenty land, plenty grass. I lika\r\nda have near San Le-an; my sister liva dere. I sella da milk in\r\nOakland. I maka da plentee mon. Joe an\xe2\x80\x99 Nick no runna da cow. Dey go-a\r\nto school. Bimeby maka da good engineer, worka da railroad. Yes, I lika\r\nda milka ranch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused and regarded Martin with twinkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have it,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered promptly.\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head and touched her lips courteously to the wine-glass\r\nand to the giver of the gift she knew would never be given. His heart\r\nwas right, and in her own heart she appreciated his intention as much\r\nas if the gift had gone with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Maria,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on; \xe2\x80\x9cNick and Joe won\xe2\x80\x99t have to peddle milk, and\r\nall the kids can go to school and wear shoes the whole year round. It\r\nwill be a first-class milk ranch\xe2\x80\x94everything complete. There will be a\r\nhouse to live in and a stable for the horses, and cow-barns, of course.\r\nThere will be chickens, pigs, vegetables, fruit trees, and everything\r\nlike that; and there will be enough cows to pay for a hired man or two.\r\nThen you won\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do but take care of the children. For\r\nthat matter, if you find a good man, you can marry and take it easy\r\nwhile he runs the ranch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd from such largess, dispensed from his future, Martin turned and\r\ntook his one good suit of clothes to the pawnshop. His plight was\r\ndesperate for him to do this, for it cut him off from Ruth. He had no\r\nsecond-best suit that was presentable, and though he could go to the\r\nbutcher and the baker, and even on occasion to his sister\xe2\x80\x99s, it was\r\nbeyond all daring to dream of entering the Morse home so disreputably\r\napparelled.\r\n\r\nHe toiled on, miserable and well-nigh hopeless. It began to appear to\r\nhim that the second battle was lost and that he would have to go to\r\nwork. In doing this he would satisfy everybody\xe2\x80\x94the grocer, his sister,\r\nRuth, and even Maria, to whom he owed a month\xe2\x80\x99s room rent. He was two\r\nmonths behind with his type-writer, and the agency was clamoring for\r\npayment or for the return of the machine. In desperation, all but ready\r\nto surrender, to make a truce with fate until he could get a fresh\r\nstart, he took the civil service examinations for the Railway Mail. To\r\nhis surprise, he passed first. The job was assured, though when the\r\ncall would come to enter upon his duties nobody knew.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, at the lowest ebb, that the smooth-running\r\neditorial machine broke down. A cog must have slipped or an oil-cup run\r\ndry, for the postman brought him one morning a short, thin envelope.\r\nMartin glanced at the upper left-hand corner and read the name and\r\naddress of the _Transcontinental Monthly_. His heart gave a great leap,\r\nand he suddenly felt faint, the sinking feeling accompanied by a\r\nstrange trembling of the knees. He staggered into his room and sat down\r\non the bed, the envelope still unopened, and in that moment came\r\nunderstanding to him how people suddenly fall dead upon receipt of\r\nextraordinarily good news.\r\n\r\nOf course this was good news. There was no manuscript in that thin\r\nenvelope, therefore it was an acceptance. He knew the story in the\r\nhands of the _Transcontinental_. It was \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ring of Bells,\xe2\x80\x9d one of his\r\nhorror stories, and it was an even five thousand words. And, since\r\nfirst-class magazines always paid on acceptance, there was a check\r\ninside. Two cents a word\xe2\x80\x94twenty dollars a thousand; the check must be a\r\nhundred dollars. One hundred dollars! As he tore the envelope open,\r\nevery item of all his debts surged in his brain\xe2\x80\x94$3.85 to the grocer;\r\nbutcher $4.00 flat; baker, $2.00; fruit store, $5.00; total, $14.85.\r\nThen there was room rent, $2.50; another month in advance, $2.50; two\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x99 type-writer, $8.00; a month in advance, $4.00; total, $31.85.\r\nAnd finally to be added, his pledges, plus interest, with the\r\npawnbroker\xe2\x80\x94watch, $5.50; overcoat, $5.50; wheel, $7.75; suit of\r\nclothes, $5.50 (60 % interest, but what did it matter?)\xe2\x80\x94grand total,\r\n$56.10. He saw, as if visible in the air before him, in illuminated\r\nfigures, the whole sum, and the subtraction that followed and that gave\r\na remainder of $43.90. When he had squared every debt, redeemed every\r\npledge, he would still have jingling in his pockets a princely $43.90.\r\nAnd on top of that he would have a month\xe2\x80\x99s rent paid in advance on the\r\ntype-writer and on the room.\r\n\r\nBy this time he had drawn the single sheet of type-written letter out\r\nand spread it open. There was no check. He peered into the envelope,\r\nheld it to the light, but could not trust his eyes, and in trembling\r\nhaste tore the envelope apart. There was no check. He read the letter,\r\nskimming it line by line, dashing through the editor\xe2\x80\x99s praise of his\r\nstory to the meat of the letter, the statement why the check had not\r\nbeen sent. He found no such statement, but he did find that which made\r\nhim suddenly wilt. The letter slid from his hand. His eyes went\r\nlack-lustre, and he lay back on the pillow, pulling the blanket about\r\nhim and up to his chin.\r\n\r\nFive dollars for \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ring of Bells\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94five dollars for five thousand\r\nwords! Instead of two cents a word, ten words for a cent! And the\r\neditor had praised it, too. And he would receive the check when the\r\nstory was published. Then it was all poppycock, two cents a word for\r\nminimum rate and payment upon acceptance. It was a lie, and it had led\r\nhim astray. He would never have attempted to write had he known that.\r\nHe would have gone to work\xe2\x80\x94to work for Ruth. He went back to the day he\r\nfirst attempted to write, and was appalled at the enormous waste of\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94and all for ten words for a cent. And the other high rewards of\r\nwriters, that he had read about, must be lies, too. His second-hand\r\nideas of authorship were wrong, for here was the proof of it.\r\n\r\nThe _Transcontinental_ sold for twenty-five cents, and its dignified\r\nand artistic cover proclaimed it as among the first-class magazines. It\r\nwas a staid, respectable magazine, and it had been published\r\ncontinuously since long before he was born. Why, on the outside cover\r\nwere printed every month the words of one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s great writers,\r\nwords proclaiming the inspired mission of the _Transcontinental_ by a\r\nstar of literature whose first coruscations had appeared inside those\r\nself-same covers. And the high and lofty, heaven-inspired\r\n_Transcontinental_ paid five dollars for five thousand words! The great\r\nwriter had recently died in a foreign land\xe2\x80\x94in dire poverty, Martin\r\nremembered, which was not to be wondered at, considering the\r\nmagnificent pay authors receive.\r\n\r\nWell, he had taken the bait, the newspaper lies about writers and their\r\npay, and he had wasted two years over it. But he would disgorge the\r\nbait now. Not another line would he ever write. He would do what Ruth\r\nwanted him to do, what everybody wanted him to do\xe2\x80\x94get a job. The\r\nthought of going to work reminded him of Joe\xe2\x80\x94Joe, tramping through the\r\nland of nothing-to-do. Martin heaved a great sigh of envy. The reaction\r\nof nineteen hours a day for many days was strong upon him. But then,\r\nJoe was not in love, had none of the responsibilities of love, and he\r\ncould afford to loaf through the land of nothing-to-do. He, Martin, had\r\nsomething to work for, and go to work he would. He would start out\r\nearly next morning to hunt a job. And he would let Ruth know, too, that\r\nhe had mended his ways and was willing to go into her father\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\nFive dollars for five thousand words, ten words for a cent, the market\r\nprice for art. The disappointment of it, the lie of it, the infamy of\r\nit, were uppermost in his thoughts; and under his closed eyelids, in\r\nfiery figures, burned the \xe2\x80\x9c$3.85\xe2\x80\x9d he owed the grocer. He shivered, and\r\nwas aware of an aching in his bones. The small of his back ached\r\nespecially. His head ached, the top of it ached, the back of it ached,\r\nthe brains inside of it ached and seemed to be swelling, while the ache\r\nover his brows was intolerable. And beneath the brows, planted under\r\nhis lids, was the merciless \xe2\x80\x9c$3.85.\xe2\x80\x9d He opened his eyes to escape it,\r\nbut the white light of the room seemed to sear the balls and forced him\r\nto close his eyes, when the \xe2\x80\x9c$3.85\xe2\x80\x9d confronted him again.\r\n\r\nFive dollars for five thousand words, ten words for a cent\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nparticular thought took up its residence in his brain, and he could no\r\nmore escape it than he could the \xe2\x80\x9c$3.85\xe2\x80\x9d under his eyelids. A change\r\nseemed to come over the latter, and he watched curiously, till \xe2\x80\x9c$2.00\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nburned in its stead. Ah, he thought, that was the baker. The next sum\r\nthat appeared was \xe2\x80\x9c$2.50.\xe2\x80\x9d It puzzled him, and he pondered it as if\r\nlife and death hung on the solution. He owed somebody two dollars and a\r\nhalf, that was certain, but who was it? To find it was the task set him\r\nby an imperious and malignant universe, and he wandered through the\r\nendless corridors of his mind, opening all manner of lumber rooms and\r\nchambers stored with odds and ends of memories and knowledge as he\r\nvainly sought the answer. After several centuries it came to him,\r\neasily, without effort, that it was Maria. With a great relief he\r\nturned his soul to the screen of torment under his lids. He had solved\r\nthe problem; now he could rest. But no, the \xe2\x80\x9c$2.50\xe2\x80\x9d faded away, and in\r\nits place burned \xe2\x80\x9c$8.00.\xe2\x80\x9d Who was that? He must go the dreary round of\r\nhis mind again and find out.\r\n\r\nHow long he was gone on this quest he did not know, but after what\r\nseemed an enormous lapse of time, he was called back to himself by a\r\nknock at the door, and by Maria\xe2\x80\x99s asking if he was sick. He replied in\r\na muffled voice he did not recognize, saying that he was merely taking\r\na nap. He was surprised when he noted the darkness of night in the\r\nroom. He had received the letter at two in the afternoon, and he\r\nrealized that he was sick.\r\n\r\nThen the \xe2\x80\x9c$8.00\xe2\x80\x9d began to smoulder under his lids again, and he\r\nreturned himself to servitude. But he grew cunning. There was no need\r\nfor him to wander through his mind. He had been a fool. He pulled a\r\nlever and made his mind revolve about him, a monstrous wheel of\r\nfortune, a merry-go-round of memory, a revolving sphere of wisdom.\r\nFaster and faster it revolved, until its vortex sucked him in and he\r\nwas flung whirling through black chaos.\r\n\r\nQuite naturally he found himself at a mangle, feeding starched cuffs.\r\nBut as he fed he noticed figures printed in the cuffs. It was a new way\r\nof marking linen, he thought, until, looking closer, he saw \xe2\x80\x9c$3.85\xe2\x80\x9d on\r\none of the cuffs. Then it came to him that it was the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s bill,\r\nand that these were his bills flying around on the drum of the mangle.\r\nA crafty idea came to him. He would throw the bills on the floor and so\r\nescape paying them. No sooner thought than done, and he crumpled the\r\ncuffs spitefully as he flung them upon an unusually dirty floor. Ever\r\nthe heap grew, and though each bill was duplicated a thousand times, he\r\nfound only one for two dollars and a half, which was what he owed\r\nMaria. That meant that Maria would not press for payment, and he\r\nresolved generously that it would be the only one he would pay; so he\r\nbegan searching through the cast-out heap for hers. He sought it\r\ndesperately, for ages, and was still searching when the manager of the\r\nhotel entered, the fat Dutchman. His face blazed with wrath, and he\r\nshouted in stentorian tones that echoed down the universe, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\ndeduct the cost of those cuffs from your wages!\xe2\x80\x9d The pile of cuffs grew\r\ninto a mountain, and Martin knew that he was doomed to toil for a\r\nthousand years to pay for them. Well, there was nothing left to do but\r\nkill the manager and burn down the laundry. But the big Dutchman\r\nfrustrated him, seizing him by the nape of the neck and dancing him up\r\nand down. He danced him over the ironing tables, the stove, and the\r\nmangles, and out into the wash-room and over the wringer and washer.\r\nMartin was danced until his teeth rattled and his head ached, and he\r\nmarvelled that the Dutchman was so strong.\r\n\r\nAnd then he found himself before the mangle, this time receiving the\r\ncuffs an editor of a magazine was feeding from the other side. Each\r\ncuff was a check, and Martin went over them anxiously, in a fever of\r\nexpectation, but they were all blanks. He stood there and received the\r\nblanks for a million years or so, never letting one go by for fear it\r\nmight be filled out. At last he found it. With trembling fingers he\r\nheld it to the light. It was for five dollars. \xe2\x80\x9cHa! Ha!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the\r\neditor across the mangle. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I shall kill you,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said.\r\nHe went out into the wash-room to get the axe, and found Joe starching\r\nmanuscripts. He tried to make him desist, then swung the axe for him.\r\nBut the weapon remained poised in mid-air, for Martin found himself\r\nback in the ironing room in the midst of a snow-storm. No, it was not\r\nsnow that was falling, but checks of large denomination, the smallest\r\nnot less than a thousand dollars. He began to collect them and sort\r\nthem out, in packages of a hundred, tying each package securely with\r\ntwine.\r\n\r\nHe looked up from his task and saw Joe standing before him juggling\r\nflat-irons, starched shirts, and manuscripts. Now and again he reached\r\nout and added a bundle of checks to the flying miscellany that soared\r\nthrough the roof and out of sight in a tremendous circle. Martin struck\r\nat him, but he seized the axe and added it to the flying circle. Then\r\nhe plucked Martin and added him. Martin went up through the roof,\r\nclutching at manuscripts, so that by the time he came down he had a\r\nlarge armful. But no sooner down than up again, and a second and a\r\nthird time and countless times he flew around the circle. From far off\r\nhe could hear a childish treble singing: \xe2\x80\x9cWaltz me around again,\r\nWillie, around, around, around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe recovered the axe in the midst of the Milky Way of checks, starched\r\nshirts, and manuscripts, and prepared, when he came down, to kill Joe.\r\nBut he did not come down. Instead, at two in the morning, Maria, having\r\nheard his groans through the thin partition, came into his room, to put\r\nhot flat-irons against his body and damp cloths upon his aching eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Eden did not go out to hunt for a job in the morning. It was\r\nlate afternoon before he came out of his delirium and gazed with aching\r\neyes about the room. Mary, one of the tribe of Silva, eight years old,\r\nkeeping watch, raised a screech at sight of his returning\r\nconsciousness. Maria hurried into the room from the kitchen. She put\r\nher work-calloused hand upon his hot forehead and felt his pulse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lika da eat?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. Eating was farthest from his desire, and he wondered\r\nthat he should ever have been hungry in his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sick, Maria,\xe2\x80\x9d he said weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrip,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo or three days you alla da right. Better you\r\nno eat now. Bimeby plenty can eat, to-morrow can eat maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin was not used to sickness, and when Maria and her little girl\r\nleft him, he essayed to get up and dress. By a supreme exertion of\r\nwill, with rearing brain and eyes that ached so that he could not keep\r\nthem open, he managed to get out of bed, only to be left stranded by\r\nhis senses upon the table. Half an hour later he managed to regain the\r\nbed, where he was content to lie with closed eyes and analyze his\r\nvarious pains and weaknesses. Maria came in several times to change the\r\ncold cloths on his forehead. Otherwise she left him in peace, too wise\r\nto vex him with chatter. This moved him to gratitude, and he murmured\r\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9cMaria, you getta da milka ranch, all righta, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he remembered his long-buried past of yesterday.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a life-time since he had received that letter from the\r\n_Transcontinental_, a life-time since it was all over and done with and\r\na new page turned. He had shot his bolt, and shot it hard, and now he\r\nwas down on his back. If he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t starved himself, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nbeen caught by La Grippe. He had been run down, and he had not had the\r\nstrength to throw off the germ of disease which had invaded his system.\r\nThis was what resulted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it profit a man to write a whole library and lose his own\r\nlife?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is no place for me. No more literature\r\nin mine. Me for the counting-house and ledger, the monthly salary, and\r\nthe little home with Ruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo days later, having eaten an egg and two slices of toast and drunk a\r\ncup of tea, he asked for his mail, but found his eyes still hurt too\r\nmuch to permit him to read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou read for me, Maria,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the big, long letters.\r\nThrow them under the table. Read me the small letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo can,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cTeresa, she go to school, she can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Teresa Silva, aged nine, opened his letters and read them to him. He\r\nlistened absently to a long dun from the type-writer people, his mind\r\nbusy with ways and means of finding a job. Suddenly he was shocked back\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We offer you forty dollars for all serial rights in your story,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTeresa slowly spelled out, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98provided you allow us to make the\r\nalterations suggested.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat magazine is that?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, give it to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could see to read, now, and he was unaware of the pain of the\r\naction. It was the _White Mouse_ that was offering him forty dollars,\r\nand the story was \xe2\x80\x9cThe Whirlpool,\xe2\x80\x9d another of his early horror stories.\r\nHe read the letter through again and again. The editor told him plainly\r\nthat he had not handled the idea properly, but that it was the idea\r\nthey were buying because it was original. If they could cut the story\r\ndown one-third, they would take it and send him forty dollars on\r\nreceipt of his answer.\r\n\r\nHe called for pen and ink, and told the editor he could cut the story\r\ndown three-thirds if he wanted to, and to send the forty dollars right\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nThe letter despatched to the letter-box by Teresa, Martin lay back and\r\nthought. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a lie, after all. The _White Mouse_ paid on\r\nacceptance. There were three thousand words in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Whirlpool.\xe2\x80\x9d Cut\r\ndown a third, there would be two thousand. At forty dollars that would\r\nbe two cents a word. Pay on acceptance and two cents a word\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nnewspapers had told the truth. And he had thought the _White Mouse_ a\r\nthird-rater! It was evident that he did not know the magazines. He had\r\ndeemed the _Transcontinental_ a first-rater, and it paid a cent for ten\r\nwords. He had classed the _White Mouse_ as of no account, and it paid\r\ntwenty times as much as the_ Transcontinental_ and also had paid on\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\nWell, there was one thing certain: when he got well, he would not go\r\nout looking for a job. There were more stories in his head as good as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Whirlpool,\xe2\x80\x9d and at forty dollars apiece he could earn far more\r\nthan in any job or position. Just when he thought the battle lost, it\r\nwas won. He had proved for his career. The way was clear. Beginning\r\nwith the _White Mouse_ he would add magazine after magazine to his\r\ngrowing list of patrons. Hack-work could be put aside. For that matter,\r\nit had been wasted time, for it had not brought him a dollar. He would\r\ndevote himself to work, good work, and he would pour out the best that\r\nwas in him. He wished Ruth was there to share in his joy, and when he\r\nwent over the letters left lying on his bed, he found one from her. It\r\nwas sweetly reproachful, wondering what had kept him away for so\r\ndreadful a length of time. He reread the letter adoringly, dwelling\r\nover her handwriting, loving each stroke of her pen, and in the end\r\nkissing her signature.\r\n\r\nAnd when he answered, he told her recklessly that he had not been to\r\nsee her because his best clothes were in pawn. He told her that he had\r\nbeen sick, but was once more nearly well, and that inside ten days or\r\ntwo weeks (as soon as a letter could travel to New York City and\r\nreturn) he would redeem his clothes and be with her.\r\n\r\nBut Ruth did not care to wait ten days or two weeks. Besides, her lover\r\nwas sick. The next afternoon, accompanied by Arthur, she arrived in the\r\nMorse carriage, to the unqualified delight of the Silva tribe and of\r\nall the urchins on the street, and to the consternation of Maria. She\r\nboxed the ears of the Silvas who crowded about the visitors on the tiny\r\nfront porch, and in more than usual atrocious English tried to\r\napologize for her appearance. Sleeves rolled up from soap-flecked arms\r\nand a wet gunny-sack around her waist told of the task at which she had\r\nbeen caught. So flustered was she by two such grand young people asking\r\nfor her lodger, that she forgot to invite them to sit down in the\r\nlittle parlor. To enter Martin\xe2\x80\x99s room, they passed through the kitchen,\r\nwarm and moist and steamy from the big washing in progress. Maria, in\r\nher excitement, jammed the bedroom and bedroom-closet doors together,\r\nand for five minutes, through the partly open door, clouds of steam,\r\nsmelling of soap-suds and dirt, poured into the sick chamber.\r\n\r\nRuth succeeded in veering right and left and right again, and in\r\nrunning the narrow passage between table and bed to Martin\xe2\x80\x99s side; but\r\nArthur veered too wide and fetched up with clatter and bang of pots and\r\npans in the corner where Martin did his cooking. Arthur did not linger\r\nlong. Ruth occupied the only chair, and having done his duty, he went\r\noutside and stood by the gate, the centre of seven marvelling Silvas,\r\nwho watched him as they would have watched a curiosity in a side-show.\r\nAll about the carriage were gathered the children from a dozen blocks,\r\nwaiting and eager for some tragic and terrible d\xc3\xa9nouement. Carriages\r\nwere seen on their street only for weddings and funerals. Here was\r\nneither marriage nor death: therefore, it was something transcending\r\nexperience and well worth waiting for.\r\n\r\nMartin had been wild to see Ruth. His was essentially a love-nature,\r\nand he possessed more than the average man\xe2\x80\x99s need for sympathy. He was\r\nstarving for sympathy, which, with him, meant intelligent\r\nunderstanding; and he had yet to learn that Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy was largely\r\nsentimental and tactful, and that it proceeded from gentleness of\r\nnature rather than from understanding of the objects of her sympathy.\r\nSo it was while Martin held her hand and gladly talked, that her love\r\nfor him prompted her to press his hand in return, and that her eyes\r\nwere moist and luminous at sight of his helplessness and of the marks\r\nsuffering had stamped upon his face.\r\n\r\nBut while he told her of his two acceptances, of his despair when he\r\nreceived the one from the _Transcontinental_, and of the corresponding\r\ndelight with which he received the one from the _White Mouse_, she did\r\nnot follow him. She heard the words he uttered and understood their\r\nliteral import, but she was not with him in his despair and his\r\ndelight. She could not get out of herself. She was not interested in\r\nselling stories to magazines. What was important to her was matrimony.\r\nShe was not aware of it, however, any more than she was aware that her\r\ndesire that Martin take a position was the instinctive and preparative\r\nimpulse of motherhood. She would have blushed had she been told as much\r\nin plain, set terms, and next, she might have grown indignant and\r\nasserted that her sole interest lay in the man she loved and her desire\r\nfor him to make the best of himself. So, while Martin poured out his\r\nheart to her, elated with the first success his chosen work in the\r\nworld had received, she paid heed to his bare words only, gazing now\r\nand again about the room, shocked by what she saw.\r\n\r\nFor the first time Ruth gazed upon the sordid face of poverty. Starving\r\nlovers had always seemed romantic to her,\xe2\x80\x94but she had had no idea how\r\nstarving lovers lived. She had never dreamed it could be like this.\r\nEver her gaze shifted from the room to him and back again. The steamy\r\nsmell of dirty clothes, which had entered with her from the kitchen,\r\nwas sickening. Martin must be soaked with it, Ruth concluded, if that\r\nawful woman washed frequently. Such was the contagiousness of\r\ndegradation. When she looked at Martin, she seemed to see the smirch\r\nleft upon him by his surroundings. She had never seen him unshaven, and\r\nthe three days\xe2\x80\x99 growth of beard on his face was repulsive to her. Not\r\nalone did it give him the same dark and murky aspect of the Silva\r\nhouse, inside and out, but it seemed to emphasize that animal-like\r\nstrength of his which she detested. And here he was, being confirmed in\r\nhis madness by the two acceptances he took such pride in telling her\r\nabout. A little longer and he would have surrendered and gone to work.\r\nNow he would continue on in this horrible house, writing and starving\r\nfor a few more months.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that smell?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of Maria\xe2\x80\x99s washing smells, I imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngrowing quite accustomed to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; not that. It is something else. A stale, sickish smell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin sampled the air before replying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t smell anything else, except stale tobacco smoke,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. It is terrible. Why do you smoke so much, Martin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, except that I smoke more than usual when I am lonely.\r\nAnd then, too, it\xe2\x80\x99s such a long-standing habit. I learned when I was\r\nonly a youngster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a nice habit, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she reproved. \xe2\x80\x9cIt smells to\r\nheaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the fault of the tobacco. I can afford only the cheapest. But\r\nwait until I get that forty-dollar check. I\xe2\x80\x99ll use a brand that is not\r\noffensive even to the angels. But that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad, was it, two\r\nacceptances in three days? That forty-five dollars will pay about all\r\nmy debts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor two years\xe2\x80\x99 work?\xe2\x80\x9d she queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, for less than a week\xe2\x80\x99s work. Please pass me that book over on the\r\nfar corner of the table, the account book with the gray cover.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nopened it and began turning over the pages rapidly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was right.\r\nFour days for \xe2\x80\x98The Ring of Bells,\xe2\x80\x99 two days for \xe2\x80\x98The Whirlpool.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforty-five dollars for a week\xe2\x80\x99s work, one hundred and eighty dollars a\r\nmonth. That beats any salary I can command. And, besides, I\xe2\x80\x99m just\r\nbeginning. A thousand dollars a month is not too much to buy for you\r\nall I want you to have. A salary of five hundred a month would be too\r\nsmall. That forty-five dollars is just a starter. Wait till I get my\r\nstride. Then watch my smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth misunderstood his slang, and reverted to cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou smoke more than enough as it is, and the brand of tobacco will\r\nmake no difference. It is the smoking itself that is not nice, no\r\nmatter what the brand may be. You are a chimney, a living volcano, a\r\nperambulating smoke-stack, and you are a perfect disgrace, Martin dear,\r\nyou know you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe leaned toward him, entreaty in her eyes, and as he looked at her\r\ndelicate face and into her pure, limpid eyes, as of old he was struck\r\nwith his own unworthiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t smoke any more,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, for\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nsake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything you ask, dear love,\r\nanything; you know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA great temptation assailed her. In an insistent way she had caught\r\nglimpses of the large, easy-going side of his nature, and she felt\r\nsure, if she asked him to cease attempting to write, that he would\r\ngrant her wish. In the swift instant that elapsed, the words trembled\r\non her lips. But she did not utter them. She was not quite brave\r\nenough; she did not quite dare. Instead, she leaned toward him to meet\r\nhim, and in his arms murmured:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, it is really not for my sake, Martin, but for your own. I am\r\nsure smoking hurts you; and besides, it is not good to be a slave to\r\nanything, to a drug least of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall always be your slave,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn which case, I shall begin issuing my commands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him mischievously, though deep down she was already\r\nregretting that she had not preferred her largest request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI live but to obey, your majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, my first commandment is, Thou shalt not omit to shave\r\nevery day. Look how you have scratched my cheek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so it ended in caresses and love-laughter. But she had made one\r\npoint, and she could not expect to make more than one at a time. She\r\nfelt a woman\xe2\x80\x99s pride in that she had made him stop smoking. Another\r\ntime she would persuade him to take a position, for had he not said he\r\nwould do anything she asked?\r\n\r\nShe left his side to explore the room, examining the clothes-lines of\r\nnotes overhead, learning the mystery of the tackle used for suspending\r\nhis wheel under the ceiling, and being saddened by the heap of\r\nmanuscripts under the table which represented to her just so much\r\nwasted time. The oil-stove won her admiration, but on investigating the\r\nfood shelves she found them empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t anything to eat, you poor dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with tender\r\ncompassion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be starving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI store my food in Maria\xe2\x80\x99s safe and in her pantry,\xe2\x80\x9d he lied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt keeps\r\nbetter there. No danger of my starving. Look at that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had come back to his side, and she saw him double his arm at the\r\nelbow, the biceps crawling under his shirt-sleeve and swelling into a\r\nknot of muscle, heavy and hard. The sight repelled her. Sentimentally,\r\nshe disliked it. But her pulse, her blood, every fibre of her, loved it\r\nand yearned for it, and, in the old, inexplicable way, she leaned\r\ntoward him, not away from him. And in the moment that followed, when he\r\ncrushed her in his arms, the brain of her, concerned with the\r\nsuperficial aspects of life, was in revolt; while the heart of her, the\r\nwoman of her, concerned with life itself, exulted triumphantly. It was\r\nin moments like this that she felt to the uttermost the greatness of\r\nher love for Martin, for it was almost a swoon of delight to her to\r\nfeel his strong arms about her, holding her tightly, hurting her with\r\nthe grip of their fervor. At such moments she found justification for\r\nher treason to her standards, for her violation of her own high ideals,\r\nand, most of all, for her tacit disobedience to her mother and father.\r\nThey did not want her to marry this man. It shocked them that she\r\nshould love him. It shocked her, too, sometimes, when she was apart\r\nfrom him, a cool and reasoning creature. With him, she loved him\xe2\x80\x94in\r\ntruth, at times a vexed and worried love; but love it was, a love that\r\nwas stronger than she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis La Grippe is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts a bit, and gives\r\none a nasty headache, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t compare with break-bone fever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you had that, too?\xe2\x80\x9d she queried absently, intent on the\r\nheaven-sent justification she was finding in his arms.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with absent queries, she led him on, till suddenly his words\r\nstartled her.\r\n\r\nHe had had the fever in a secret colony of thirty lepers on one of the\r\nHawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why did you go there?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\nSuch royal carelessness of body seemed criminal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI never dreamed of lepers. When\r\nI deserted the schooner and landed on the beach, I headed inland for\r\nsome place of hiding. For three days I lived off guavas, _ohia_-apples,\r\nand bananas, all of which grew wild in the jungle. On the fourth day I\r\nfound the trail\xe2\x80\x94a mere foot-trail. It led inland, and it led up. It was\r\nthe way I wanted to go, and it showed signs of recent travel. At one\r\nplace it ran along the crest of a ridge that was no more than a\r\nknife-edge. The trail wasn\xe2\x80\x99t three feet wide on the crest, and on\r\neither side the ridge fell away in precipices hundreds of feet deep.\r\nOne man, with plenty of ammunition, could have held it against a\r\nhundred thousand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the only way in to the hiding-place. Three hours after I found\r\nthe trail I was there, in a little mountain valley, a pocket in the\r\nmidst of lava peaks. The whole place was terraced for taro-patches,\r\nfruit trees grew there, and there were eight or ten grass huts. But as\r\nsoon as I saw the inhabitants I knew what I\xe2\x80\x99d struck. One sight of them\r\nwas enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do?\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth demanded breathlessly, listening, like any\r\nDesdemona, appalled and fascinated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing for me to do. Their leader was a kind old fellow, pretty far\r\ngone, but he ruled like a king. He had discovered the little valley and\r\nfounded the settlement\xe2\x80\x94all of which was against the law. But he had\r\nguns, plenty of ammunition, and those Kanakas, trained to the shooting\r\nof wild cattle and wild pig, were dead shots. No, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nrunning away for Martin Eden. He stayed\xe2\x80\x94for three months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did you escape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have been there yet, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for a girl there, a\r\nhalf-Chinese, quarter-white, and quarter-Hawaiian. She was a beauty,\r\npoor thing, and well educated. Her mother, in Honolulu, was worth a\r\nmillion or so. Well, this girl got me away at last. Her mother financed\r\nthe settlement, you see, so the girl wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of being punished\r\nfor letting me go. But she made me swear, first, never to reveal the\r\nhiding-place; and I never have. This is the first time I have even\r\nmentioned it. The girl had just the first signs of leprosy. The fingers\r\nof her right hand were slightly twisted, and there was a small spot on\r\nher arm. That was all. I guess she is dead, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut weren\xe2\x80\x99t you frightened? And weren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad to get away without\r\ncatching that dreadful disease?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he confessed, \xe2\x80\x9cI was a bit shivery at first; but I got used to\r\nit. I used to feel sorry for that poor girl, though. That made me\r\nforget to be afraid. She was such a beauty, in spirit as well as in\r\nappearance, and she was only slightly touched; yet she was doomed to\r\nlie there, living the life of a primitive savage and rotting slowly\r\naway. Leprosy is far more terrible than you can imagine it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth murmured softly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder she let you get\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin asked unwittingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she must have loved you,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth said, still softly. \xe2\x80\x9cCandidly,\r\nnow, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s sunburn had been bleached by his work in the laundry and by\r\nthe indoor life he was living, while the hunger and the sickness had\r\nmade his face even pale; and across this pallor flowed the slow wave of\r\na blush. He was opening his mouth to speak, but Ruth shut him off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, don\xe2\x80\x99t answer; it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed to him there was something metallic in her laughter, and\r\nthat the light in her eyes was cold. On the spur of the moment it\r\nreminded him of a gale he had once experienced in the North Pacific.\r\nAnd for the moment the apparition of the gale rose before his eyes\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngale at night, with a clear sky and under a full moon, the huge seas\r\nglinting coldly in the moonlight. Next, he saw the girl in the leper\r\nrefuge and remembered it was for love of him that she had let him go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was noble,\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply. \xe2\x80\x9cShe gave me life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was all of the incident, but he heard Ruth muffle a dry sob in her\r\nthroat, and noticed that she turned her face away to gaze out of the\r\nwindow. When she turned it back to him, it was composed, and there was\r\nno hint of the gale in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m such a silly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said plaintively. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I do so\r\nlove you, Martin, I do, I do. I shall grow more catholic in time, but\r\nat present I can\xe2\x80\x99t help being jealous of those ghosts of the past, and\r\nyou know your past is full of ghosts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be,\xe2\x80\x9d she silenced his protest. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could not be otherwise. And\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s poor Arthur motioning me to come. He\xe2\x80\x99s tired waiting. And now\r\ngood-by, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s some kind of a mixture, put up by the druggists, that helps\r\nmen to stop the use of tobacco,\xe2\x80\x9d she called back from the door, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nam going to send you some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door closed, but opened again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered to him; and this time she was really gone.\r\n\r\nMaria, with worshipful eyes that none the less were keen to note the\r\ntexture of Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s garments and the cut of them (a cut unknown that\r\nproduced an effect mysteriously beautiful), saw her to the carriage.\r\nThe crowd of disappointed urchins stared till the carriage disappeared\r\nfrom view, then transferred their stare to Maria, who had abruptly\r\nbecome the most important person on the street. But it was one of her\r\nprogeny who blasted Maria\xe2\x80\x99s reputation by announcing that the grand\r\nvisitors had been for her lodger. After that Maria dropped back into\r\nher old obscurity and Martin began to notice the respectful manner in\r\nwhich he was regarded by the small fry of the neighborhood. As for\r\nMaria, Martin rose in her estimation a full hundred per cent, and had\r\nthe Portuguese grocer witnessed that afternoon carriage-call he would\r\nhave allowed Martin an additional three-dollars-and-eighty-five-cents\xe2\x80\x99\r\nworth of credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun of Martin\xe2\x80\x99s good fortune rose. The day after Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s visit, he\r\nreceived a check for three dollars from a New York scandal weekly in\r\npayment for three of his triolets. Two days later a newspaper published\r\nin Chicago accepted his \xe2\x80\x9cTreasure Hunters,\xe2\x80\x9d promising to pay ten\r\ndollars for it on publication. The price was small, but it was the\r\nfirst article he had written, his very first attempt to express his\r\nthought on the printed page. To cap everything, the adventure serial\r\nfor boys, his second attempt, was accepted before the end of the week\r\nby a juvenile monthly calling itself _Youth and Age_. It was true the\r\nserial was twenty-one thousand words, and they offered to pay him\r\nsixteen dollars on publication, which was something like seventy-five\r\ncents a thousand words; but it was equally true that it was the second\r\nthing he had attempted to write and that he was himself thoroughly\r\naware of its clumsy worthlessness.\r\n\r\nBut even his earliest efforts were not marked with the clumsiness of\r\nmediocrity. What characterized them was the clumsiness of too great\r\nstrength\xe2\x80\x94the clumsiness which the tyro betrays when he crushes\r\nbutterflies with battering rams and hammers out vignettes with a\r\nwar-club. So it was that Martin was glad to sell his early efforts for\r\nsongs. He knew them for what they were, and it had not taken him long\r\nto acquire this knowledge. What he pinned his faith to was his later\r\nwork. He had striven to be something more than a mere writer of\r\nmagazine fiction. He had sought to equip himself with the tools of\r\nartistry. On the other hand, he had not sacrificed strength. His\r\nconscious aim had been to increase his strength by avoiding excess of\r\nstrength. Nor had he departed from his love of reality. His work was\r\nrealism, though he had endeavored to fuse with it the fancies and\r\nbeauties of imagination. What he sought was an impassioned realism,\r\nshot through with human aspiration and faith. What he wanted was life\r\nas it was, with all its spirit-groping and soul-reaching left in.\r\n\r\nHe had discovered, in the course of his reading, two schools of\r\nfiction. One treated of man as a god, ignoring his earthly origin; the\r\nother treated of man as a clod, ignoring his heaven-sent dreams and\r\ndivine possibilities. Both the god and the clod schools erred, in\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s estimation, and erred through too great singleness of sight\r\nand purpose. There was a compromise that approximated the truth, though\r\nit flattered not the school of god, while it challenged the\r\nbrute-savageness of the school of clod. It was his story, \xe2\x80\x9cAdventure,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich had dragged with Ruth, that Martin believed had achieved his\r\nideal of the true in fiction; and it was in an essay, \xe2\x80\x9cGod and Clod,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthat he had expressed his views on the whole general subject.\r\n\r\nBut \xe2\x80\x9cAdventure,\xe2\x80\x9d and all that he deemed his best work, still went\r\nbegging among the editors. His early work counted for nothing in his\r\neyes except for the money it brought, and his horror stories, two of\r\nwhich he had sold, he did not consider high work nor his best work. To\r\nhim they were frankly imaginative and fantastic, though invested with\r\nall the glamour of the real, wherein lay their power. This investiture\r\nof the grotesque and impossible with reality, he looked upon as a\r\ntrick\xe2\x80\x94a skilful trick at best. Great literature could not reside in\r\nsuch a field. Their artistry was high, but he denied the worthwhileness\r\nof artistry when divorced from humanness. The trick had been to fling\r\nover the face of his artistry a mask of humanness, and this he had done\r\nin the half-dozen or so stories of the horror brand he had written\r\nbefore he emerged upon the high peaks of \xe2\x80\x9cAdventure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cJoy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pot,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wine of Life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three dollars he received for the triolets he used to eke out a\r\nprecarious existence against the arrival of the _White Mouse_ check. He\r\ncashed the first check with the suspicious Portuguese grocer, paying a\r\ndollar on account and dividing the remaining two dollars between the\r\nbaker and the fruit store. Martin was not yet rich enough to afford\r\nmeat, and he was on slim allowance when the _White Mouse_ check\r\narrived. He was divided on the cashing of it. He had never been in a\r\nbank in his life, much less been in one on business, and he had a naive\r\nand childlike desire to walk into one of the big banks down in Oakland\r\nand fling down his indorsed check for forty dollars. On the other hand,\r\npractical common sense ruled that he should cash it with his grocer and\r\nthereby make an impression that would later result in an increase of\r\ncredit. Reluctantly Martin yielded to the claims of the grocer, paying\r\nhis bill with him in full, and receiving in change a pocketful of\r\njingling coin. Also, he paid the other tradesmen in full, redeemed his\r\nsuit and his bicycle, paid one month\xe2\x80\x99s rent on the type-writer, and\r\npaid Maria the overdue month for his room and a month in advance. This\r\nleft him in his pocket, for emergencies, a balance of nearly three\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nIn itself, this small sum seemed a fortune. Immediately on recovering\r\nhis clothes he had gone to see Ruth, and on the way he could not\r\nrefrain from jingling the little handful of silver in his pocket. He\r\nhad been so long without money that, like a rescued starving man who\r\ncannot let the unconsumed food out of his sight, Martin could not keep\r\nhis hand off the silver. He was not mean, nor avaricious, but the money\r\nmeant more than so many dollars and cents. It stood for success, and\r\nthe eagles stamped upon the coins were to him so many winged victories.\r\n\r\nIt came to him insensibly that it was a very good world. It certainly\r\nappeared more beautiful to him. For weeks it had been a very dull and\r\nsombre world; but now, with nearly all debts paid, three dollars\r\njingling in his pocket, and in his mind the consciousness of success,\r\nthe sun shone bright and warm, and even a rain-squall that soaked\r\nunprepared pedestrians seemed a merry happening to him. When he\r\nstarved, his thoughts had dwelt often upon the thousands he knew were\r\nstarving the world over; but now that he was feasted full, the fact of\r\nthe thousands starving was no longer pregnant in his brain. He forgot\r\nabout them, and, being in love, remembered the countless lovers in the\r\nworld. Without deliberately thinking about it, _motifs_ for love-lyrics\r\nbegan to agitate his brain. Swept away by the creative impulse, he got\r\noff the electric car, without vexation, two blocks beyond his crossing.\r\n\r\nHe found a number of persons in the Morse home. Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s two girl-cousins\r\nwere visiting her from San Rafael, and Mrs. Morse, under pretext of\r\nentertaining them, was pursuing her plan of surrounding Ruth with young\r\npeople. The campaign had begun during Martin\xe2\x80\x99s enforced absence, and\r\nwas already in full swing. She was making a point of having at the\r\nhouse men who were doing things. Thus, in addition to the cousins\r\nDorothy and Florence, Martin encountered two university professors, one\r\nof Latin, the other of English; a young army officer just back from the\r\nPhilippines, one-time school-mate of Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s; a young fellow named\r\nMelville, private secretary to Joseph Perkins, head of the San\r\nFrancisco Trust Company; and finally of the men, a live bank cashier,\r\nCharles Hapgood, a youngish man of thirty-five, graduate of Stanford\r\nUniversity, member of the Nile Club and the Unity Club, and a\r\nconservative speaker for the Republican Party during campaigns\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nshort, a rising young man in every way. Among the women was one who\r\npainted portraits, another who was a professional musician, and still\r\nanother who possessed the degree of Doctor of Sociology and who was\r\nlocally famous for her social settlement work in the slums of San\r\nFrancisco. But the women did not count for much in Mrs. Morse\xe2\x80\x99s plan.\r\nAt the best, they were necessary accessories. The men who did things\r\nmust be drawn to the house somehow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t get excited when you talk,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth admonished Martin, before the\r\nordeal of introduction began.\r\n\r\nHe bore himself a bit stiffly at first, oppressed by a sense of his own\r\nawkwardness, especially of his shoulders, which were up to their old\r\ntrick of threatening destruction to furniture and ornaments. Also, he\r\nwas rendered self-conscious by the company. He had never before been in\r\ncontact with such exalted beings nor with so many of them. Melville,\r\nthe bank cashier, fascinated him, and he resolved to investigate him at\r\nthe first opportunity. For underneath Martin\xe2\x80\x99s awe lurked his assertive\r\nego, and he felt the urge to measure himself with these men and women\r\nand to find out what they had learned from the books and life which he\r\nhad not learned.\r\n\r\nRuth\xe2\x80\x99s eyes roved to him frequently to see how he was getting on, and\r\nshe was surprised and gladdened by the ease with which he got\r\nacquainted with her cousins. He certainly did not grow excited, while\r\nbeing seated removed from him the worry of his shoulders. Ruth knew\r\nthem for clever girls, superficially brilliant, and she could scarcely\r\nunderstand their praise of Martin later that night at going to bed. But\r\nhe, on the other hand, a wit in his own class, a gay quizzer and\r\nlaughter-maker at dances and Sunday picnics, had found the making of\r\nfun and the breaking of good-natured lances simple enough in this\r\nenvironment. And on this evening success stood at his back, patting him\r\non the shoulder and telling him that he was making good, so that he\r\ncould afford to laugh and make laughter and remain unabashed.\r\n\r\nLater, Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety found justification. Martin and Professor\r\nCaldwell had got together in a conspicuous corner, and though Martin no\r\nlonger wove the air with his hands, to Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s critical eye he permitted\r\nhis own eyes to flash and glitter too frequently, talked too rapidly\r\nand warmly, grew too intense, and allowed his aroused blood to redden\r\nhis cheeks too much. He lacked decorum and control, and was in decided\r\ncontrast to the young professor of English with whom he talked.\r\n\r\nBut Martin was not concerned with appearances! He had been swift to\r\nnote the other\xe2\x80\x99s trained mind and to appreciate his command of\r\nknowledge. Furthermore, Professor Caldwell did not realize Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconcept of the average English professor. Martin wanted him to talk\r\nshop, and, though he seemed averse at first, succeeded in making him do\r\nit. For Martin did not see why a man should not talk shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s absurd and unfair,\xe2\x80\x9d he had told Ruth weeks before, \xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\nobjection to talking shop. For what reason under the sun do men and\r\nwomen come together if not for the exchange of the best that is in\r\nthem? And the best that is in them is what they are interested in, the\r\nthing by which they make their living, the thing they\xe2\x80\x99ve specialized on\r\nand sat up days and nights over, and even dreamed about. Imagine Mr.\r\nButler living up to social etiquette and enunciating his views on Paul\r\nVerlaine or the German drama or the novels of D\xe2\x80\x99Annunzio. We\xe2\x80\x99d be bored\r\nto death. I, for one, if I must listen to Mr. Butler, prefer to hear\r\nhim talk about his law. It\xe2\x80\x99s the best that is in him, and life is so\r\nshort that I want the best of every man and woman I meet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth had objected, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are the topics of general interest to\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d he had rushed on. \xe2\x80\x9cAll persons in society, all\r\ncliques in society\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, nearly all persons and cliques\xe2\x80\x94ape their\r\nbetters. Now, who are the best betters? The idlers, the wealthy idlers.\r\nThey do not know, as a rule, the things known by the persons who are\r\ndoing something in the world. To listen to conversation about such\r\nthings would mean to be bored, wherefore the idlers decree that such\r\nthings are shop and must not be talked about. Likewise they decree the\r\nthings that are not shop and which may be talked about, and those\r\nthings are the latest operas, latest novels, cards, billiards,\r\ncocktails, automobiles, horse shows, trout fishing, tuna-fishing,\r\nbig-game shooting, yacht sailing, and so forth\xe2\x80\x94and mark you, these are\r\nthe things the idlers know. In all truth, they constitute the shop-talk\r\nof the idlers. And the funniest part of it is that many of the clever\r\npeople, and all the would-be clever people, allow the idlers so to\r\nimpose upon them. As for me, I want the best a man\xe2\x80\x99s got in him, call\r\nit shop vulgarity or anything you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Ruth had not understood. This attack of his on the established had\r\nseemed to her just so much wilfulness of opinion.\r\n\r\nSo Martin contaminated Professor Caldwell with his own earnestness,\r\nchallenging him to speak his mind. As Ruth paused beside them she heard\r\nMartin saying:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surely don\xe2\x80\x99t pronounce such heresies in the University of\r\nCalifornia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProfessor Caldwell shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cThe honest taxpayer and the\r\npolitician, you know. Sacramento gives us our appropriations and\r\ntherefore we kowtow to Sacramento, and to the Board of Regents, and to\r\nthe party press, or to the press of both parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s clear; but how about you?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin urged. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be a\r\nfish out of the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFew like me, I imagine, in the university pond. Sometimes I am fairly\r\nsure I am out of water, and that I should belong in Paris, in Grub\r\nStreet, in a hermit\xe2\x80\x99s cave, or in some sadly wild Bohemian crowd,\r\ndrinking claret,\xe2\x80\x94dago-red they call it in San Francisco,\xe2\x80\x94dining in\r\ncheap restaurants in the Latin Quarter, and expressing vociferously\r\nradical views upon all creation. Really, I am frequently almost sure\r\nthat I was cut out to be a radical. But then, there are so many\r\nquestions on which I am not sure. I grow timid when I am face to face\r\nwith my human frailty, which ever prevents me from grasping all the\r\nfactors in any problem\xe2\x80\x94human, vital problems, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as he talked on, Martin became aware that to his own lips had come\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cSong of the Trade Wind\xe2\x80\x9d:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am strongest at noon,\r\nBut under the moon\r\n    I stiffen the bunt of the sail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was almost humming the words, and it dawned upon him that the other\r\nreminded him of the trade wind, of the Northeast Trade, steady, and\r\ncool, and strong. He was equable, he was to be relied upon, and withal\r\nthere was a certain bafflement about him. Martin had the feeling that\r\nhe never spoke his full mind, just as he had often had the feeling that\r\nthe trades never blew their strongest but always held reserves of\r\nstrength that were never used. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s trick of visioning was active\r\nas ever. His brain was a most accessible storehouse of remembered fact\r\nand fancy, and its contents seemed ever ordered and spread for his\r\ninspection. Whatever occurred in the instant present, Martin\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nimmediately presented associated antithesis or similitude which\r\nordinarily expressed themselves to him in vision. It was sheerly\r\nautomatic, and his visioning was an unfailing accompaniment to the\r\nliving present. Just as Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s face, in a momentary jealousy had called\r\nbefore his eyes a forgotten moonlight gale, and as Professor Caldwell\r\nmade him see again the Northeast Trade herding the white billows across\r\nthe purple sea, so, from moment to moment, not disconcerting but rather\r\nidentifying and classifying, new memory-visions rose before him, or\r\nspread under his eyelids, or were thrown upon the screen of his\r\nconsciousness. These visions came out of the actions and sensations of\r\nthe past, out of things and events and books of yesterday and last\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x94a countless host of apparitions that, waking or sleeping, forever\r\nthronged his mind.\r\n\r\nSo it was, as he listened to Professor Caldwell\xe2\x80\x99s easy flow of\r\nspeech\xe2\x80\x94the conversation of a clever, cultured man\xe2\x80\x94that Martin kept\r\nseeing himself down all his past. He saw himself when he had been quite\r\nthe hoodlum, wearing a \xe2\x80\x9cstiff-rim\xe2\x80\x9d Stetson hat and a square-cut,\r\ndouble-breasted coat, with a certain swagger to the shoulders and\r\npossessing the ideal of being as tough as the police permitted. He did\r\nnot disguise it to himself, nor attempt to palliate it. At one time in\r\nhis life he had been just a common hoodlum, the leader of a gang that\r\nworried the police and terrorized honest, working-class householders.\r\nBut his ideals had changed. He glanced about him at the well-bred,\r\nwell-dressed men and women, and breathed into his lungs the atmosphere\r\nof culture and refinement, and at the same moment the ghost of his\r\nearly youth, in stiff-rim and square-cut, with swagger and toughness,\r\nstalked across the room. This figure, of the corner hoodlum, he saw\r\nmerge into himself, sitting and talking with an actual university\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\nFor, after all, he had never found his permanent abiding place. He had\r\nfitted in wherever he found himself, been a favorite always and\r\neverywhere by virtue of holding his own at work and at play and by his\r\nwillingness and ability to fight for his rights and command respect.\r\nBut he had never taken root. He had fitted in sufficiently to satisfy\r\nhis fellows but not to satisfy himself. He had been perturbed always by\r\na feeling of unrest, had heard always the call of something from\r\nbeyond, and had wandered on through life seeking it until he found\r\nbooks and art and love. And here he was, in the midst of all this, the\r\nonly one of all the comrades he had adventured with who could have made\r\nthemselves eligible for the inside of the Morse home.\r\n\r\nBut such thoughts and visions did not prevent him from following\r\nProfessor Caldwell closely. And as he followed, comprehendingly and\r\ncritically, he noted the unbroken field of the other\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge. As\r\nfor himself, from moment to moment the conversation showed him gaps and\r\nopen stretches, whole subjects with which he was unfamiliar.\r\nNevertheless, thanks to his Spencer, he saw that he possessed the\r\noutlines of the field of knowledge. It was a matter only of time, when\r\nhe would fill in the outline. Then watch out, he thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99ware shoal,\r\neverybody! He felt like sitting at the feet of the professor,\r\nworshipful and absorbent; but, as he listened, he began to discern a\r\nweakness in the other\xe2\x80\x99s judgments\xe2\x80\x94a weakness so stray and elusive that\r\nhe might not have caught it had it not been ever present. And when he\r\ndid catch it, he leapt to equality at once.\r\n\r\nRuth came up to them a second time, just as Martin began to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you where you are wrong, or, rather, what weakens your\r\njudgments,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou lack biology. It has no place in your scheme\r\nof things.\xe2\x80\x94Oh, I mean the real interpretative biology, from the ground\r\nup, from the laboratory and the test-tube and the vitalized inorganic\r\nright on up to the widest aesthetic and sociological generalizations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth was appalled. She had sat two lecture courses under Professor\r\nCaldwell and looked up to him as the living repository of all\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI scarcely follow you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said dubiously.\r\n\r\nMartin was not so sure but what he had followed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to explain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember reading in Egyptian\r\nhistory something to the effect that understanding could not be had of\r\nEgyptian art without first studying the land question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d the professor nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat knowledge of the land\r\nquestion, in turn, of all questions, for that matter, cannot be had\r\nwithout previous knowledge of the stuff and the constitution of life.\r\nHow can we understand laws and institutions, religions and customs,\r\nwithout understanding, not merely the nature of the creatures that made\r\nthem, but the nature of the stuff out of which the creatures are made?\r\nIs literature less human than the architecture and sculpture of Egypt?\r\nIs there one thing in the known universe that is not subject to the law\r\nof evolution?\xe2\x80\x94Oh, I know there is an elaborate evolution of the various\r\narts laid down, but it seems to me to be too mechanical. The human\r\nhimself is left out. The evolution of the tool, of the harp, of music\r\nand song and dance, are all beautifully elaborated; but how about the\r\nevolution of the human himself, the development of the basic and\r\nintrinsic parts that were in him before he made his first tool or\r\ngibbered his first chant? It is that which you do not consider, and\r\nwhich I call biology. It is biology in its largest aspects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I express myself incoherently, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to hammer out the\r\nidea. It came to me as you were talking, so I was not primed and ready\r\nto deliver it. You spoke yourself of the human frailty that prevented\r\none from taking all the factors into consideration. And you, in\r\nturn,\xe2\x80\x94or so it seems to me,\xe2\x80\x94leave out the biological factor, the very\r\nstuff out of which has been spun the fabric of all the arts, the warp\r\nand the woof of all human actions and achievements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s amazement, Martin was not immediately crushed, and that the\r\nprofessor replied in the way he did struck her as forbearance for\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s youth. Professor Caldwell sat for a full minute, silent and\r\nfingering his watch chain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had that same criticism passed on\r\nme once before\xe2\x80\x94by a very great man, a scientist and evolutionist,\r\nJoseph Le Conte. But he is dead, and I thought to remain undetected;\r\nand now you come along and expose me. Seriously, though\xe2\x80\x94and this is\r\nconfession\xe2\x80\x94I think there is something in your contention\xe2\x80\x94a great deal,\r\nin fact. I am too classical, not enough up-to-date in the\r\ninterpretative branches of science, and I can only plead the\r\ndisadvantages of my education and a temperamental slothfulness that\r\nprevents me from doing the work. I wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever been inside a physics or chemistry laboratory? It is true,\r\nnevertheless. Le Conte was right, and so are you, Mr. Eden, at least to\r\nan extent\xe2\x80\x94how much I do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth drew Martin away with her on a pretext; when she had got him\r\naside, whispering:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have monopolized Professor Caldwell that way. There may\r\nbe others who want to talk with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin admitted contritely. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99d got him stirred up,\r\nand he was so interesting that I did not think. Do you know, he is the\r\nbrightest, the most intellectual, man I have ever talked with. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you something else. I once thought that everybody who went to\r\nuniversities, or who sat in the high places in society, was just as\r\nbrilliant and intelligent as he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an exception,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say so. Whom do you want me to talk to now?\xe2\x80\x94Oh, say, bring me\r\nup against that cashier-fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin talked for fifteen minutes with him, nor could Ruth have wished\r\nbetter behavior on her lover\xe2\x80\x99s part. Not once did his eyes flash nor\r\nhis cheeks flush, while the calmness and poise with which he talked\r\nsurprised her. But in Martin\xe2\x80\x99s estimation the whole tribe of bank\r\ncashiers fell a few hundred per cent, and for the rest of the evening\r\nhe labored under the impression that bank cashiers and talkers of\r\nplatitudes were synonymous phrases. The army officer he found\r\ngood-natured and simple, a healthy, wholesome young fellow, content to\r\noccupy the place in life into which birth and luck had flung him. On\r\nlearning that he had completed two years in the university, Martin was\r\npuzzled to know where he had stored it away. Nevertheless Martin liked\r\nhim better than the platitudinous bank cashier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t object to platitudes,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Ruth later; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what\r\nworries me into nervousness is the pompous, smugly complacent, superior\r\ncertitude with which they are uttered and the time taken to do it. Why,\r\nI could give that man the whole history of the Reformation in the time\r\nhe took to tell me that the Union-Labor Party had fused with the\r\nDemocrats. Do you know, he skins his words as a professional\r\npoker-player skins the cards that are dealt out to him. Some day I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nshow you what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you don\xe2\x80\x99t like him,\xe2\x80\x9d was her reply. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a favorite of Mr.\r\nButler\xe2\x80\x99s. Mr. Butler says he is safe and honest\xe2\x80\x94calls him the Rock,\r\nPeter, and says that upon him any banking institution can well be\r\nbuilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt it\xe2\x80\x94from the little I saw of him and the less I heard\r\nfrom him; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so much of banks as I did. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nmy speaking my mind this way, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; it is most interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin went on heartily, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no more than a barbarian getting\r\nmy first impressions of civilization. Such impressions must be\r\nentertainingly novel to the civilized person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you think of my cousins?\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI liked them better than the other women. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of fun in\r\nthem along with paucity of pretence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you did like the other women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat social-settlement woman is no more than a sociological\r\npoll-parrot. I swear, if you winnowed her out between the stars, like\r\nTomlinson, there would be found in her not one original thought. As for\r\nthe portrait-painter, she was a positive bore. She\xe2\x80\x99d make a good wife\r\nfor the cashier. And the musician woman! I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how nimble her\r\nfingers are, how perfect her technique, how wonderful her\r\nexpression\xe2\x80\x94the fact is, she knows nothing about music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe plays beautifully,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s undoubtedly gymnastic in the externals of music, but the\r\nintrinsic spirit of music is unguessed by her. I asked her what music\r\nmeant to her\xe2\x80\x94you know I\xe2\x80\x99m always curious to know that particular thing;\r\nand she did not know what it meant to her, except that she adored it,\r\nthat it was the greatest of the arts, and that it meant more than life\r\nto her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were making them talk shop,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth charged him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess it. And if they were failures on shop, imagine my sufferings\r\nif they had discoursed on other subjects. Why, I used to think that up\r\nhere, where all the advantages of culture were enjoyed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He paused for\r\na moment, and watched the youthful shade of himself, in stiff-rim and\r\nsquare-cut, enter the door and swagger across the room. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I was\r\nsaying, up here I thought all men and women were brilliant and radiant.\r\nBut now, from what little I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of them, they strike me as a pack\r\nof ninnies, most of them, and ninety percent of the remainder as bores.\r\nNow there\xe2\x80\x99s Professor Caldwell\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s different. He\xe2\x80\x99s a man, every inch\r\nof him and every atom of his gray matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth\xe2\x80\x99s face brightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about him,\xe2\x80\x9d she urged. \xe2\x80\x9cNot what is large and brilliant\xe2\x80\x94I know\r\nthose qualities; but whatever you feel is adverse. I am most curious to\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll get myself in a pickle.\xe2\x80\x9d Martin debated humorously for a\r\nmoment. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you tell me first. Or maybe you find in him nothing\r\nless than the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI attended two lecture courses under him, and I have known him for two\r\nyears; that is why I am anxious for your first impression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad impression, you mean? Well, here goes. He is all the fine things\r\nyou think about him, I guess. At least, he is the finest specimen of\r\nintellectual man I have met; but he is a man with a secret shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d he hastened to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing paltry nor vulgar. What I\r\nmean is that he strikes me as a man who has gone to the bottom of\r\nthings, and is so afraid of what he saw that he makes believe to\r\nhimself that he never saw it. Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s not the clearest way to\r\nexpress it. Here\xe2\x80\x99s another way. A man who has found the path to the\r\nhidden temple but has not followed it; who has, perhaps, caught\r\nglimpses of the temple and striven afterward to convince himself that\r\nit was only a mirage of foliage. Yet another way. A man who could have\r\ndone things but who placed no value on the doing, and who, all the\r\ntime, in his innermost heart, is regretting that he has not done them;\r\nwho has secretly laughed at the rewards for doing, and yet, still more\r\nsecretly, has yearned for the rewards and for the joy of doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t read him that way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for that matter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee just what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only a vague feeling on my part,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin temporized. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no\r\nreason for it. It is only a feeling, and most likely it is wrong. You\r\ncertainly should know him better than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the evening at Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s Martin brought away with him strange\r\nconfusions and conflicting feelings. He was disappointed in his goal,\r\nin the persons he had climbed to be with. On the other hand, he was\r\nencouraged with his success. The climb had been easier than he\r\nexpected. He was superior to the climb, and (he did not, with false\r\nmodesty, hide it from himself) he was superior to the beings among whom\r\nhe had climbed\xe2\x80\x94with the exception, of course, of Professor Caldwell.\r\nAbout life and the books he knew more than they, and he wondered into\r\nwhat nooks and crannies they had cast aside their educations. He did\r\nnot know that he was himself possessed of unusual brain vigor; nor did\r\nhe know that the persons who were given to probing the depths and to\r\nthinking ultimate thoughts were not to be found in the drawing rooms of\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s Morses; nor did he dream that such persons were as lonely\r\neagles sailing solitary in the azure sky far above the earth and its\r\nswarming freight of gregarious life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut success had lost Martin\xe2\x80\x99s address, and her messengers no longer\r\ncame to his door. For twenty-five days, working Sundays and holidays,\r\nhe toiled on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun,\xe2\x80\x9d a long essay of some thirty\r\nthousand words. It was a deliberate attack on the mysticism of the\r\nMaeterlinck school\xe2\x80\x94an attack from the citadel of positive science upon\r\nthe wonder-dreamers, but an attack nevertheless that retained much of\r\nbeauty and wonder of the sort compatible with ascertained fact. It was\r\na little later that he followed up the attack with two short essays,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Wonder-Dreamers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Yardstick of the Ego.\xe2\x80\x9d And on essays,\r\nlong and short, he began to pay the travelling expenses from magazine\r\nto magazine.\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty-five days spent on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun,\xe2\x80\x9d he sold\r\nhack-work to the extent of six dollars and fifty cents. A joke had\r\nbrought in fifty cents, and a second one, sold to a high-grade comic\r\nweekly, had fetched a dollar. Then two humorous poems had earned two\r\ndollars and three dollars respectively. As a result, having exhausted\r\nhis credit with the tradesmen (though he had increased his credit with\r\nthe grocer to five dollars), his wheel and suit of clothes went back to\r\nthe pawnbroker. The type-writer people were again clamoring for money,\r\ninsistently pointing out that according to the agreement rent was to be\r\npaid strictly in advance.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by his several small sales, Martin went back to hack-work.\r\nPerhaps there was a living in it, after all. Stored away under his\r\ntable were the twenty storiettes which had been rejected by the\r\nnewspaper short-story syndicate. He read them over in order to find out\r\nhow not to write newspaper storiettes, and so doing, reasoned out the\r\nperfect formula. He found that the newspaper storiette should never be\r\ntragic, should never end unhappily, and should never contain beauty of\r\nlanguage, subtlety of thought, nor real delicacy of sentiment.\r\nSentiment it must contain, plenty of it, pure and noble, of the sort\r\nthat in his own early youth had brought his applause from \xe2\x80\x9cnigger\r\nheaven\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cFor-God-my-country-and-the-Czar\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI-may-be-poor-but-I-am-honest\xe2\x80\x9d brand of sentiment.\r\n\r\nHaving learned such precautions, Martin consulted \xe2\x80\x9cThe Duchess\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\ntone, and proceeded to mix according to formula. The formula consists\r\nof three parts: (1) a pair of lovers are jarred apart; (2) by some deed\r\nor event they are reunited; (3) marriage bells. The third part was an\r\nunvarying quantity, but the first and second parts could be varied an\r\ninfinite number of times. Thus, the pair of lovers could be jarred\r\napart by misunderstood motives, by accident of fate, by jealous rivals,\r\nby irate parents, by crafty guardians, by scheming relatives, and so\r\nforth and so forth; they could be reunited by a brave deed of the man\r\nlover, by a similar deed of the woman lover, by change of heart in one\r\nlover or the other, by forced confession of crafty guardian, scheming\r\nrelative, or jealous rival, by voluntary confession of same, by\r\ndiscovery of some unguessed secret, by lover storming girl\xe2\x80\x99s heart, by\r\nlover making long and noble self-sacrifice, and so on, endlessly. It\r\nwas very fetching to make the girl propose in the course of being\r\nreunited, and Martin discovered, bit by bit, other decidedly piquant\r\nand fetching ruses. But marriage bells at the end was the one thing he\r\ncould take no liberties with; though the heavens rolled up as a scroll\r\nand the stars fell, the wedding bells must go on ringing just the same.\r\nIn quantity, the formula prescribed twelve hundred words minimum dose,\r\nfifteen hundred words maximum dose.\r\n\r\nBefore he got very far along in the art of the storiette, Martin worked\r\nout half a dozen stock forms, which he always consulted when\r\nconstructing storiettes. These forms were like the cunning tables used\r\nby mathematicians, which may be entered from top, bottom, right, and\r\nleft, which entrances consist of scores of lines and dozens of columns,\r\nand from which may be drawn, without reasoning or thinking, thousands\r\nof different conclusions, all unchallengably precise and true. Thus, in\r\nthe course of half an hour with his forms, Martin could frame up a\r\ndozen or so storiettes, which he put aside and filled in at his\r\nconvenience. He found that he could fill one in, after a day of serious\r\nwork, in the hour before going to bed. As he later confessed to Ruth,\r\nhe could almost do it in his sleep. The real work was in constructing\r\nthe frames, and that was merely mechanical.\r\n\r\nHe had no doubt whatever of the efficacy of his formula, and for once\r\nhe knew the editorial mind when he said positively to himself that the\r\nfirst two he sent off would bring checks. And checks they brought, for\r\nfour dollars each, at the end of twelve days.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he was making fresh and alarming discoveries concerning\r\nthe magazines. Though the _Transcontinental_ had published \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ring of\r\nBells,\xe2\x80\x9d no check was forthcoming. Martin needed it, and he wrote for\r\nit. An evasive answer and a request for more of his work was all he\r\nreceived. He had gone hungry two days waiting for the reply, and it was\r\nthen that he put his wheel back in pawn. He wrote regularly, twice a\r\nweek, to the _Transcontinental_ for his five dollars, though it was\r\nonly semi-occasionally that he elicited a reply. He did not know that\r\nthe _Transcontinental_ had been staggering along precariously for\r\nyears, that it was a fourth-rater, or tenth-rater, without standing,\r\nwith a crazy circulation that partly rested on petty bullying and\r\npartly on patriotic appealing, and with advertisements that were\r\nscarcely more than charitable donations. Nor did he know that the\r\n_Transcontinental_ was the sole livelihood of the editor and the\r\nbusiness manager, and that they could wring their livelihood out of it\r\nonly by moving to escape paying rent and by never paying any bill they\r\ncould evade. Nor could he have guessed that the particular five dollars\r\nthat belonged to him had been appropriated by the business manager for\r\nthe painting of his house in Alameda, which painting he performed\r\nhimself, on week-day afternoons, because he could not afford to pay\r\nunion wages and because the first scab he had employed had had a ladder\r\njerked out from under him and been sent to the hospital with a broken\r\ncollar-bone.\r\n\r\nThe ten dollars for which Martin had sold \xe2\x80\x9cTreasure Hunters\xe2\x80\x9d to the\r\nChicago newspaper did not come to hand. The article had been published,\r\nas he had ascertained at the file in the Central Reading-room, but no\r\nword could he get from the editor. His letters were ignored. To satisfy\r\nhimself that they had been received, he registered several of them. It\r\nwas nothing less than robbery, he concluded\xe2\x80\x94a cold-blooded steal; while\r\nhe starved, he was pilfered of his merchandise, of his goods, the sale\r\nof which was the sole way of getting bread to eat.\r\n\r\n_Youth and Age_ was a weekly, and it had published two-thirds of his\r\ntwenty-one-thousand-word serial when it went out of business. With it\r\nwent all hopes of getting his sixteen dollars.\r\n\r\nTo cap the situation, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pot,\xe2\x80\x9d which he looked upon as one of the\r\nbest things he had written, was lost to him. In despair, casting about\r\nfrantically among the magazines, he had sent it to _The Billow_, a\r\nsociety weekly in San Francisco. His chief reason for submitting it to\r\nthat publication was that, having only to travel across the bay from\r\nOakland, a quick decision could be reached. Two weeks later he was\r\noverjoyed to see, in the latest number on the news-stand, his story\r\nprinted in full, illustrated, and in the place of honor. He went home\r\nwith leaping pulse, wondering how much they would pay him for one of\r\nthe best things he had done. Also, the celerity with which it had been\r\naccepted and published was a pleasant thought to him. That the editor\r\nhad not informed him of the acceptance made the surprise more complete.\r\nAfter waiting a week, two weeks, and half a week longer, desperation\r\nconquered diffidence, and he wrote to the editor of _The Billow_,\r\nsuggesting that possibly through some negligence of the business\r\nmanager his little account had been overlooked.\r\n\r\nEven if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t more than five dollars, Martin thought to himself, it\r\nwill buy enough beans and pea-soup to enable me to write half a dozen\r\nlike it, and possibly as good.\r\n\r\nBack came a cool letter from the editor that at least elicited Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d it ran, \xe2\x80\x9cfor your excellent contribution. All of us in\r\nthe office enjoyed it immensely, and, as you see, it was given the\r\nplace of honor and immediate publication. We earnestly hope that you\r\nliked the illustrations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn rereading your letter it seems to us that you are laboring under\r\nthe misapprehension that we pay for unsolicited manuscripts. This is\r\nnot our custom, and of course yours was unsolicited. We assumed,\r\nnaturally, when we received your story, that you understood the\r\nsituation. We can only deeply regret this unfortunate misunderstanding,\r\nand assure you of our unfailing regard. Again, thanking you for your\r\nkind contribution, and hoping to receive more from you in the near\r\nfuture, we remain, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was also a postscript to the effect that though _The Billow_\r\ncarried no free-list, it took great pleasure in sending him a\r\ncomplimentary subscription for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nAfter that experience, Martin typed at the top of the first sheet of\r\nall his manuscripts: \xe2\x80\x9cSubmitted at your usual rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome day, he consoled himself, they will be submitted at _my_ usual\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nHe discovered in himself, at this period, a passion for perfection,\r\nunder the sway of which he rewrote and polished \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jostling Street,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Wine of Life,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cJoy,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cSea Lyrics,\xe2\x80\x9d and others of his earlier\r\nwork. As of old, nineteen hours of labor a day was all too little to\r\nsuit him. He wrote prodigiously, and he read prodigiously, forgetting\r\nin his toil the pangs caused by giving up his tobacco. Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s promised\r\ncure for the habit, flamboyantly labelled, he stowed away in the most\r\ninaccessible corner of his bureau. Especially during his stretches of\r\nfamine he suffered from lack of the weed; but no matter how often he\r\nmastered the craving, it remained with him as strong as ever. He\r\nregarded it as the biggest thing he had ever achieved. Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s point of\r\nview was that he was doing no more than was right. She brought him the\r\nanti-tobacco remedy, purchased out of her glove money, and in a few\r\ndays forgot all about it.\r\n\r\nHis machine-made storiettes, though he hated them and derided them,\r\nwere successful. By means of them he redeemed all his pledges, paid\r\nmost of his bills, and bought a new set of tires for his wheel. The\r\nstoriettes at least kept the pot a-boiling and gave him time for\r\nambitious work; while the one thing that upheld him was the forty\r\ndollars he had received from _The White Mouse_. He anchored his faith\r\nto that, and was confident that the really first-class magazines would\r\npay an unknown writer at least an equal rate, if not a better one. But\r\nthe thing was, how to get into the first-class magazines. His best\r\nstories, essays, and poems went begging among them, and yet, each\r\nmonth, he read reams of dull, prosy, inartistic stuff between all their\r\nvarious covers. If only one editor, he sometimes thought, would descend\r\nfrom his high seat of pride to write me one cheering line! No matter if\r\nmy work is unusual, no matter if it is unfit, for prudential reasons,\r\nfor their pages, surely there must be some sparks in it, somewhere, a\r\nfew, to warm them to some sort of appreciation. And thereupon he would\r\nget out one or another of his manuscripts, such as \xe2\x80\x9cAdventure,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nread it over and over in a vain attempt to vindicate the editorial\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nAs the sweet California spring came on, his period of plenty came to an\r\nend. For several weeks he had been worried by a strange silence on the\r\npart of the newspaper storiette syndicate. Then, one day, came back to\r\nhim through the mail ten of his immaculate machine-made storiettes.\r\nThey were accompanied by a brief letter to the effect that the\r\nsyndicate was overstocked, and that some months would elapse before it\r\nwould be in the market again for manuscripts. Martin had even been\r\nextravagant on the strength of those ten storiettes. Toward the last\r\nthe syndicate had been paying him five dollars each for them and\r\naccepting every one he sent. So he had looked upon the ten as good as\r\nsold, and he had lived accordingly, on a basis of fifty dollars in the\r\nbank. So it was that he entered abruptly upon a lean period, wherein he\r\ncontinued selling his earlier efforts to publications that would not\r\npay and submitting his later work to magazines that would not buy.\r\nAlso, he resumed his trips to the pawn-broker down in Oakland. A few\r\njokes and snatches of humorous verse, sold to the New York weeklies,\r\nmade existence barely possible for him. It was at this time that he\r\nwrote letters of inquiry to the several great monthly and quarterly\r\nreviews, and learned in reply that they rarely considered unsolicited\r\narticles, and that most of their contents were written upon order by\r\nwell-known specialists who were authorities in their various fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a hard summer for Martin. Manuscript readers and editors were\r\naway on vacation, and publications that ordinarily returned a decision\r\nin three weeks now retained his manuscript for three months or more.\r\nThe consolation he drew from it was that a saving in postage was\r\neffected by the deadlock. Only the robber-publications seemed to remain\r\nactively in business, and to them Martin disposed of all his early\r\nefforts, such as \xe2\x80\x9cPearl-diving,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sea as a Career,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurtle-catching,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Northeast Trades.\xe2\x80\x9d For these manuscripts he\r\nnever received a penny. It is true, after six months\xe2\x80\x99 correspondence,\r\nhe effected a compromise, whereby he received a safety razor for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurtle-catching,\xe2\x80\x9d and that _The Acropolis_, having agreed to give him\r\nfive dollars cash and five yearly subscriptions: for \xe2\x80\x9cThe Northeast\r\nTrades,\xe2\x80\x9d fulfilled the second part of the agreement.\r\n\r\nFor a sonnet on Stevenson he managed to wring two dollars out of a\r\nBoston editor who was running a magazine with a Matthew Arnold taste\r\nand a penny-dreadful purse. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Peri and the Pearl,\xe2\x80\x9d a clever skit of\r\na poem of two hundred lines, just finished, white hot from his brain,\r\nwon the heart of the editor of a San Francisco magazine published in\r\nthe interest of a great railroad. When the editor wrote, offering him\r\npayment in transportation, Martin wrote back to inquire if the\r\ntransportation was transferable. It was not, and so, being prevented\r\nfrom peddling it, he asked for the return of the poem. Back it came,\r\nwith the editor\xe2\x80\x99s regrets, and Martin sent it to San Francisco again,\r\nthis time to _The Hornet_, a pretentious monthly that had been fanned\r\ninto a constellation of the first magnitude by the brilliant journalist\r\nwho founded it. But _The Hornet\xe2\x80\x99s_ light had begun to dim long before\r\nMartin was born. The editor promised Martin fifteen dollars for the\r\npoem, but, when it was published, seemed to forget about it. Several of\r\nhis letters being ignored, Martin indicted an angry one which drew a\r\nreply. It was written by a new editor, who coolly informed Martin that\r\nhe declined to be held responsible for the old editor\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes, and\r\nthat he did not think much of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Peri and the Pearl\xe2\x80\x9d anyway.\r\n\r\nBut _The Globe_, a Chicago magazine, gave Martin the most cruel\r\ntreatment of all. He had refrained from offering his \xe2\x80\x9cSea Lyrics\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\npublication, until driven to it by starvation. After having been\r\nrejected by a dozen magazines, they had come to rest in _The Globe_\r\noffice. There were thirty poems in the collection, and he was to\r\nreceive a dollar apiece for them. The first month four were published,\r\nand he promptly received a check for four dollars; but when he looked\r\nover the magazine, he was appalled at the slaughter. In some cases the\r\ntitles had been altered: \xe2\x80\x9cFinis,\xe2\x80\x9d for instance, being changed to \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nFinish,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Song of the Outer Reef\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Song of the Coral\r\nReef.\xe2\x80\x9d In one case, an absolutely different title, a misappropriate\r\ntitle, was substituted. In place of his own, \xe2\x80\x9cMedusa Lights,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\neditor had printed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Backward Track.\xe2\x80\x9d But the slaughter in the body\r\nof the poems was terrifying. Martin groaned and sweated and thrust his\r\nhands through his hair. Phrases, lines, and stanzas were cut out,\r\ninterchanged, or juggled about in the most incomprehensible manner.\r\nSometimes lines and stanzas not his own were substituted for his. He\r\ncould not believe that a sane editor could be guilty of such\r\nmaltreatment, and his favorite hypothesis was that his poems must have\r\nbeen doctored by the office boy or the stenographer. Martin wrote\r\nimmediately, begging the editor to cease publishing the lyrics and to\r\nreturn them to him.\r\n\r\nHe wrote again and again, begging, entreating, threatening, but his\r\nletters were ignored. Month by month the slaughter went on till the\r\nthirty poems were published, and month by month he received a check for\r\nthose which had appeared in the current number.\r\n\r\nDespite these various misadventures, the memory of the _White Mouse_\r\nforty-dollar check sustained him, though he was driven more and more to\r\nhack-work. He discovered a bread-and-butter field in the agricultural\r\nweeklies and trade journals, though among the religious weeklies he\r\nfound he could easily starve. At his lowest ebb, when his black suit\r\nwas in pawn, he made a ten-strike\xe2\x80\x94or so it seemed to him\xe2\x80\x94in a prize\r\ncontest arranged by the County Committee of the Republican Party. There\r\nwere three branches of the contest, and he entered them all, laughing\r\nat himself bitterly the while in that he was driven to such straits to\r\nlive. His poem won the first prize of ten dollars, his campaign song\r\nthe second prize of five dollars, his essay on the principles of the\r\nRepublican Party the first prize of twenty-five dollars. Which was very\r\ngratifying to him until he tried to collect. Something had gone wrong\r\nin the County Committee, and, though a rich banker and a state senator\r\nwere members of it, the money was not forthcoming. While this affair\r\nwas hanging fire, he proved that he understood the principles of the\r\nDemocratic Party by winning the first prize for his essay in a similar\r\ncontest. And, moreover, he received the money, twenty-five dollars. But\r\nthe forty dollars won in the first contest he never received.\r\n\r\nDriven to shifts in order to see Ruth, and deciding that the long walk\r\nfrom north Oakland to her house and back again consumed too much time,\r\nhe kept his black suit in pawn in place of his bicycle. The latter gave\r\nhim exercise, saved him hours of time for work, and enabled him to see\r\nRuth just the same. A pair of knee duck trousers and an old sweater\r\nmade him a presentable wheel costume, so that he could go with Ruth on\r\nafternoon rides. Besides, he no longer had opportunity to see much of\r\nher in her own home, where Mrs. Morse was thoroughly prosecuting her\r\ncampaign of entertainment. The exalted beings he met there, and to whom\r\nhe had looked up but a short time before, now bored him. They were no\r\nlonger exalted. He was nervous and irritable, what of his hard times,\r\ndisappointments, and close application to work, and the conversation of\r\nsuch people was maddening. He was not unduly egotistic. He measured the\r\nnarrowness of their minds by the minds of the thinkers in the books he\r\nread. At Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s home he never met a large mind, with the exception of\r\nProfessor Caldwell, and Caldwell he had met there only once. As for the\r\nrest, they were numskulls, ninnies, superficial, dogmatic, and\r\nignorant. It was their ignorance that astounded him. What was the\r\nmatter with them? What had they done with their educations? They had\r\nhad access to the same books he had. How did it happen that they had\r\ndrawn nothing from them?\r\n\r\nHe knew that the great minds, the deep and rational thinkers, existed.\r\nHe had his proofs from the books, the books that had educated him\r\nbeyond the Morse standard. And he knew that higher intellects than\r\nthose of the Morse circle were to be found in the world. He read\r\nEnglish society novels, wherein he caught glimpses of men and women\r\ntalking politics and philosophy. And he read of salons in great cities,\r\neven in the United States, where art and intellect congregated.\r\nFoolishly, in the past, he had conceived that all well-groomed persons\r\nabove the working class were persons with power of intellect and vigor\r\nof beauty. Culture and collars had gone together, to him, and he had\r\nbeen deceived into believing that college educations and mastery were\r\nthe same things.\r\n\r\nWell, he would fight his way on and up higher. And he would take Ruth\r\nwith him. Her he dearly loved, and he was confident that she would\r\nshine anywhere. As it was clear to him that he had been handicapped by\r\nhis early environment, so now he perceived that she was similarly\r\nhandicapped. She had not had a chance to expand. The books on her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s shelves, the paintings on the walls, the music on the\r\npiano\xe2\x80\x94all was just so much meretricious display. To real literature,\r\nreal painting, real music, the Morses and their kind, were dead. And\r\nbigger than such things was life, of which they were densely,\r\nhopelessly ignorant. In spite of their Unitarian proclivities and their\r\nmasks of conservative broadmindedness, they were two generations behind\r\ninterpretative science: their mental processes were mediaeval, while\r\ntheir thinking on the ultimate data of existence and of the universe\r\nstruck him as the same metaphysical method that was as young as the\r\nyoungest race, as old as the cave-man, and older\xe2\x80\x94the same that moved\r\nthe first Pleistocene ape-man to fear the dark; that moved the first\r\nhasty Hebrew savage to incarnate Eve from Adam\xe2\x80\x99s rib; that moved\r\nDescartes to build an idealistic system of the universe out of the\r\nprojections of his own puny ego; and that moved the famous British\r\necclesiastic to denounce evolution in satire so scathing as to win\r\nimmediate applause and leave his name a notorious scrawl on the page of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nSo Martin thought, and he thought further, till it dawned upon him that\r\nthe difference between these lawyers, officers, business men, and bank\r\ncashiers he had met and the members of the working class he had known\r\nwas on a par with the difference in the food they ate, clothes they\r\nwore, neighborhoods in which they lived. Certainly, in all of them was\r\nlacking the something more which he found in himself and in the books.\r\nThe Morses had shown him the best their social position could produce,\r\nand he was not impressed by it. A pauper himself, a slave to the\r\nmoney-lender, he knew himself the superior of those he met at the\r\nMorses\xe2\x80\x99; and, when his one decent suit of clothes was out of pawn, he\r\nmoved among them a lord of life, quivering with a sense of outrage akin\r\nto what a prince would suffer if condemned to live with goat-herds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hate and fear the socialists,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked to Mr. Morse, one\r\nevening at dinner; \xe2\x80\x9cbut why? You know neither them nor their\r\ndoctrines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation had been swung in that direction by Mrs. Morse, who\r\nhad been invidiously singing the praises of Mr. Hapgood. The cashier\r\nwas Martin\xe2\x80\x99s black beast, and his temper was a trifle short where the\r\ntalker of platitudes was concerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said, \xe2\x80\x9cCharley Hapgood is what they call a rising young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94somebody told me as much. And it is true. He\xe2\x80\x99ll make the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nChair before he dies, and, who knows? maybe the United States Senate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Morse had inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him make a campaign speech. It was so cleverly stupid and\r\nunoriginal, and also so convincing, that the leaders cannot help but\r\nregard him as safe and sure, while his platitudes are so much like the\r\nplatitudes of the average voter that\xe2\x80\x94oh, well, you know you flatter any\r\nman by dressing up his own thoughts for him and presenting them to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI actually think you are jealous of Mr. Hapgood,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth had chimed in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe look of horror on Martin\xe2\x80\x99s face stirred Mrs. Morse to belligerence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surely don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say that Mr. Hapgood is stupid?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded\r\nicily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more than the average Republican,\xe2\x80\x9d was the retort, \xe2\x80\x9cor average\r\nDemocrat, either. They are all stupid when they are not crafty, and\r\nvery few of them are crafty. The only wise Republicans are the\r\nmillionnaires and their conscious henchmen. They know which side their\r\nbread is buttered on, and they know why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a Republican,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Morse put in lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cPray, how do you\r\nclassify me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are an unconscious henchman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenchman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes. You do corporation work. You have no working-class nor\r\ncriminal practice. You don\xe2\x80\x99t depend upon wife-beaters and pickpockets\r\nfor your income. You get your livelihood from the masters of society,\r\nand whoever feeds a man is that man\xe2\x80\x99s master. Yes, you are a henchman.\r\nYou are interested in advancing the interests of the aggregations of\r\ncapital you serve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Morse\xe2\x80\x99s face was a trifle red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you talk like a scoundrelly\r\nsocialist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen it was that Martin made his remark:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hate and fear the socialists; but why? You know neither them nor\r\ntheir doctrines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour doctrine certainly sounds like socialism,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Morse replied,\r\nwhile Ruth gazed anxiously from one to the other, and Mrs. Morse beamed\r\nhappily at the opportunity afforded of rousing her liege lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nantagonism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I say Republicans are stupid, and hold that liberty, equality,\r\nand fraternity are exploded bubbles, does not make me a socialist,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMartin said with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I question Jefferson and the\r\nunscientific Frenchmen who informed his mind, does not make me a\r\nsocialist. Believe me, Mr. Morse, you are far nearer socialism than I\r\nwho am its avowed enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you please to be facetious,\xe2\x80\x9d was all the other could say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I speak in all seriousness. You still believe in equality,\r\nand yet you do the work of the corporations, and the corporations, from\r\nday to day, are busily engaged in burying equality. And you call me a\r\nsocialist because I deny equality, because I affirm just what you live\r\nup to. The Republicans are foes to equality, though most of them fight\r\nthe battle against equality with the very word itself the slogan on\r\ntheir lips. In the name of equality they destroy equality. That was why\r\nI called them stupid. As for myself, I am an individualist. I believe\r\nthe race is to the swift, the battle to the strong. Such is the lesson\r\nI have learned from biology, or at least think I have learned. As I\r\nsaid, I am an individualist, and individualism is the hereditary and\r\neternal foe of socialism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you frequent socialist meetings,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Morse challenged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, just as spies frequent hostile camps. How else are you to\r\nlearn about the enemy? Besides, I enjoy myself at their meetings. They\r\nare good fighters, and, right or wrong, they have read the books. Any\r\none of them knows far more about sociology and all the other ologies\r\nthan the average captain of industry. Yes, I have been to half a dozen\r\nof their meetings, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me a socialist any more than\r\nhearing Charley Hapgood orate made me a Republican.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Morse said feebly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I still believe you\r\nincline that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBless me, Martin thought to himself, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what I was talking\r\nabout. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t understood a word of it. What did he do with his\r\neducation, anyway?\r\n\r\nThus, in his development, Martin found himself face to face with\r\neconomic morality, or the morality of class; and soon it became to him\r\na grisly monster. Personally, he was an intellectual moralist, and more\r\noffending to him than platitudinous pomposity was the morality of those\r\nabout him, which was a curious hotchpotch of the economic, the\r\nmetaphysical, the sentimental, and the imitative.\r\n\r\nA sample of this curious messy mixture he encountered nearer home. His\r\nsister Marian had been keeping company with an industrious young\r\nmechanic, of German extraction, who, after thoroughly learning the\r\ntrade, had set up for himself in a bicycle-repair shop. Also, having\r\ngot the agency for a low-grade make of wheel, he was prosperous. Marian\r\nhad called on Martin in his room a short time before to announce her\r\nengagement, during which visit she had playfully inspected Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npalm and told his fortune. On her next visit she brought Hermann von\r\nSchmidt along with her. Martin did the honors and congratulated both of\r\nthem in language so easy and graceful as to affect disagreeably the\r\npeasant-mind of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s lover. This bad impression was further\r\nheightened by Martin\xe2\x80\x99s reading aloud the half-dozen stanzas of verse\r\nwith which he had commemorated Marian\xe2\x80\x99s previous visit. It was a bit of\r\nsociety verse, airy and delicate, which he had named \xe2\x80\x9cThe Palmist.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nwas surprised, when he finished reading it, to note no enjoyment in his\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s face. Instead, her eyes were fixed anxiously upon her\r\nbetrothed, and Martin, following her gaze, saw spread on that worthy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nasymmetrical features nothing but black and sullen disapproval. The\r\nincident passed over, they made an early departure, and Martin forgot\r\nall about it, though for the moment he had been puzzled that any woman,\r\neven of the working class, should not have been flattered and delighted\r\nby having poetry written about her.\r\n\r\nSeveral evenings later Marian again visited him, this time alone. Nor\r\ndid she waste time in coming to the point, upbraiding him sorrowfully\r\nfor what he had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Marian,\xe2\x80\x9d he chided, \xe2\x80\x9cyou talk as though you were ashamed of your\r\nrelatives, or of your brother at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am, too,\xe2\x80\x9d she blurted out.\r\n\r\nMartin was bewildered by the tears of mortification he saw in her eyes.\r\nThe mood, whatever it was, was genuine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Marian, why should your Hermann be jealous of my writing poetry\r\nabout my own sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ain\xe2\x80\x99t jealous,\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says it was indecent, ob\xe2\x80\x94obscene.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin emitted a long, low whistle of incredulity, then proceeded to\r\nresurrect and read a carbon copy of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Palmist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally, proffering the manuscript to her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead it yourself and show me whatever strikes you as obscene\xe2\x80\x94that was\r\nthe word, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says so, and he ought to know,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, with a wave aside\r\nof the manuscript, accompanied by a look of loathing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he says\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tear it up. He says he won\xe2\x80\x99t have no wife of his with\r\nsuch things written about her which anybody can read. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndisgrace, an\xe2\x80\x99 he won\xe2\x80\x99t stand for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, look here, Marian, this is nothing but nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin began;\r\nthen abruptly changed his mind.\r\n\r\nHe saw before him an unhappy girl, knew the futility of attempting to\r\nconvince her husband or her, and, though the whole situation was absurd\r\nand preposterous, he resolved to surrender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, tearing the manuscript into half a dozen\r\npieces and throwing it into the waste-basket.\r\n\r\nHe contented himself with the knowledge that even then the original\r\ntype-written manuscript was reposing in the office of a New York\r\nmagazine. Marian and her husband would never know, and neither himself\r\nnor they nor the world would lose if the pretty, harmless poem ever\r\nwere published.\r\n\r\nMarian, starting to reach into the waste-basket, refrained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I?\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded.\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head, regarding her thoughtfully as she gathered the torn\r\npieces of manuscript and tucked them into the pocket of her\r\njacket\xe2\x80\x94ocular evidence of the success of her mission. She reminded him\r\nof Lizzie Connolly, though there was less of fire and gorgeous\r\nflaunting life in her than in that other girl of the working class whom\r\nhe had seen twice. But they were on a par, the pair of them, in dress\r\nand carriage, and he smiled with inward amusement at the caprice of his\r\nfancy which suggested the appearance of either of them in Mrs. Morse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrawing-room. The amusement faded, and he was aware of a great\r\nloneliness. This sister of his and the Morse drawing-room were\r\nmilestones of the road he had travelled. And he had left them behind.\r\nHe glanced affectionately about him at his few books. They were all the\r\ncomrades left to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded in startled surprise.\r\n\r\nMarian repeated her question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t I go to work?\xe2\x80\x9d He broke into a laugh that was only\r\nhalf-hearted. \xe2\x80\x9cThat Hermann of yours has been talking to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded, and the nod of her head affirmed his charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you tell that Hermann of yours to mind his own business; that\r\nwhen I write poetry about the girl he\xe2\x80\x99s keeping company with it\xe2\x80\x99s his\r\nbusiness, but that outside of that he\xe2\x80\x99s got no say so. Understand?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll succeed as a writer, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99m no good?\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen down and am a disgrace to the\r\nfamily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be much better if you got a job,\xe2\x80\x9d she said firmly,\r\nand he saw she was sincere. \xe2\x80\x9cHermann says\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn Hermann!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out good-naturedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want to know is\r\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get married. Also, you find out from your Hermann\r\nif he will deign to permit you to accept a wedding present from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe mused over the incident after she had gone, and once or twice broke\r\nout into laughter that was bitter as he saw his sister and her\r\nbetrothed, all the members of his own class and the members of Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclass, directing their narrow little lives by narrow little\r\nformulas\xe2\x80\x94herd-creatures, flocking together and patterning their lives\r\nby one another\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, failing of being individuals and of really\r\nliving life because of the childlike formulas by which they were\r\nenslaved. He summoned them before him in apparitional procession:\r\nBernard Higginbotham arm in arm with Mr. Butler, Hermann von Schmidt\r\ncheek by jowl with Charley Hapgood, and one by one and in pairs he\r\njudged them and dismissed them\xe2\x80\x94judged them by the standards of\r\nintellect and morality he had learned from the books. Vainly he asked:\r\nWhere are the great souls, the great men and women? He found them not\r\namong the careless, gross, and stupid intelligences that answered the\r\ncall of vision to his narrow room. He felt a loathing for them such as\r\nCirce must have felt for her swine. When he had dismissed the last one\r\nand thought himself alone, a late-comer entered, unexpected and\r\nunsummoned. Martin watched him and saw the stiff-rim, the square-cut,\r\ndouble-breasted coat and the swaggering shoulders, of the youthful\r\nhoodlum who had once been he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were like all the rest, young fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin sneered. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nmorality and your knowledge were just the same as theirs. You did not\r\nthink and act for yourself. Your opinions, like your clothes, were\r\nready made; your acts were shaped by popular approval. You were cock of\r\nyour gang because others acclaimed you the real thing. You fought and\r\nruled the gang, not because you liked to,\xe2\x80\x94you know you really despised\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x94but because the other fellows patted you on the shoulder. You\r\nlicked Cheese-Face because you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give in, and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nin partly because you were an abysmal brute and for the rest because\r\nyou believed what every one about you believed, that the measure of\r\nmanhood was the carnivorous ferocity displayed in injuring and marring\r\nfellow-creatures\xe2\x80\x99 anatomies. Why, you whelp, you even won other\r\nfellows\xe2\x80\x99 girls away from them, not because you wanted the girls, but\r\nbecause in the marrow of those about you, those who set your moral\r\npace, was the instinct of the wild stallion and the bull-seal. Well,\r\nthe years have passed, and what do you think about it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if in reply, the vision underwent a swift metamorphosis. The\r\nstiff-rim and the square-cut vanished, being replaced by milder\r\ngarments; the toughness went out of the face, the hardness out of the\r\neyes; and, the face, chastened and refined, was irradiated from an\r\ninner life of communion with beauty and knowledge. The apparition was\r\nvery like his present self, and, as he regarded it, he noted the\r\nstudent-lamp by which it was illuminated, and the book over which it\r\npored. He glanced at the title and read, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Science of \xc3\x86sthetics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nNext, he entered into the apparition, trimmed the student-lamp, and\r\nhimself went on reading \xe2\x80\x9cThe Science of \xc3\x86sthetics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a beautiful fall day, a day of similar Indian summer to that which\r\nhad seen their love declared the year before, Martin read his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove-cycle\xe2\x80\x9d to Ruth. It was in the afternoon, and, as before, they had\r\nridden out to their favorite knoll in the hills. Now and again she had\r\ninterrupted his reading with exclamations of pleasure, and now, as he\r\nlaid the last sheet of manuscript with its fellows, he waited her\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nShe delayed to speak, and at last she spoke haltingly, hesitating to\r\nframe in words the harshness of her thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think they are beautiful, very beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsell them, can you? You see what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost pleaded.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis writing of yours is not practical. Something is the matter\xe2\x80\x94maybe\r\nit is with the market\xe2\x80\x94that prevents you from earning a living by it.\r\nAnd please, dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand me. I am flattered, and made\r\nproud, and all that\xe2\x80\x94I could not be a true woman were it otherwise\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nyou should write these poems to me. But they do not make our marriage\r\npossible. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, Martin? Don\xe2\x80\x99t think me mercenary. It is love,\r\nthe thought of our future, with which I am burdened. A whole year has\r\ngone by since we learned we loved each other, and our wedding day is no\r\nnearer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think me immodest in thus talking about our wedding, for\r\nreally I have my heart, all that I am, at stake. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you try to\r\nget work on a newspaper, if you are so bound up in your writing? Why\r\nnot become a reporter?\xe2\x80\x94for a while, at least?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would spoil my style,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer, in a low, monotonous voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no idea how I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked for style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut those storiettes,\xe2\x80\x9d she argued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou called them hack-work. You\r\nwrote many of them. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t they spoil your style?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the cases are different. The storiettes were ground out, jaded, at\r\nthe end of a long day of application to style. But a reporter\xe2\x80\x99s work is\r\nall hack from morning till night, is the one paramount thing of life.\r\nAnd it is a whirlwind life, the life of the moment, with neither past\r\nnor future, and certainly without thought of any style but reportorial\r\nstyle, and that certainly is not literature. To become a reporter now,\r\njust as my style is taking form, crystallizing, would be to commit\r\nliterary suicide. As it is, every storiette, every word of every\r\nstoriette, was a violation of myself, of my self-respect, of my respect\r\nfor beauty. I tell you it was sickening. I was guilty of sin. And I was\r\nsecretly glad when the markets failed, even if my clothes did go into\r\npawn. But the joy of writing the \xe2\x80\x98Love-cycle\xe2\x80\x99! The creative joy in its\r\nnoblest form! That was compensation for everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin did not know that Ruth was unsympathetic concerning the creative\r\njoy. She used the phrase\xe2\x80\x94it was on her lips he had first heard it. She\r\nhad read about it, studied about it, in the university in the course of\r\nearning her Bachelorship of Arts; but she was not original, not\r\ncreative, and all manifestations of culture on her part were but\r\nharpings of the harpings of others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay not the editor have been right in his revision of your \xe2\x80\x98Sea\r\nLyrics\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d she questioned. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, an editor must have proved\r\nqualifications or else he would not be an editor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s in line with the persistence of the established,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined,\r\nhis heat against the editor-folk getting the better of him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is,\r\nis not only right, but is the best possible. The existence of anything\r\nis sufficient vindication of its fitness to exist\xe2\x80\x94to exist, mark you,\r\nas the average person unconsciously believes, not merely in present\r\nconditions, but in all conditions. It is their ignorance, of course,\r\nthat makes them believe such rot\xe2\x80\x94their ignorance, which is nothing more\r\nnor less than the henidical mental process described by Weininger. They\r\nthink they think, and such thinkless creatures are the arbiters of the\r\nlives of the few who really think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, overcome by the consciousness that he had been talking over\r\nRuth\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who this Weininger is,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\r\nare so dreadfully general that I fail to follow you. What I was\r\nspeaking of was the qualification of editors\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe chief qualification of\r\nninety-nine per cent of all editors is failure. They have failed as\r\nwriters. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think they prefer the drudgery of the desk and the\r\nslavery to their circulation and to the business manager to the joy of\r\nwriting. They have tried to write, and they have failed. And right\r\nthere is the cursed paradox of it. Every portal to success in\r\nliterature is guarded by those watch-dogs, the failures in literature.\r\nThe editors, sub-editors, associate editors, most of them, and the\r\nmanuscript-readers for the magazines and book-publishers, most of them,\r\nnearly all of them, are men who wanted to write and who have failed.\r\nAnd yet they, of all creatures under the sun the most unfit, are the\r\nvery creatures who decide what shall and what shall not find its way\r\ninto print\xe2\x80\x94they, who have proved themselves not original, who have\r\ndemonstrated that they lack the divine fire, sit in judgment upon\r\noriginality and genius. And after them come the reviewers, just so many\r\nmore failures. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that they have not dreamed the dream and\r\nattempted to write poetry or fiction; for they have, and they have\r\nfailed. Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod-liver oil.\r\nBut you know my opinion on the reviewers and the alleged critics. There\r\nare great critics, but they are as rare as comets. If I fail as a\r\nwriter, I shall have proved for the career of editorship. There\xe2\x80\x99s bread\r\nand butter and jam, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth\xe2\x80\x99s mind was quick, and her disapproval of her lover\xe2\x80\x99s views was\r\nbuttressed by the contradiction she found in his contention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Martin, if that be so, if all the doors are closed as you have\r\nshown so conclusively, how is it possible that any of the great writers\r\never arrived?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey arrived by achieving the impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThey did such\r\nblazing, glorious work as to burn to ashes those that opposed them.\r\nThey arrived by course of miracle, by winning a thousand-to-one wager\r\nagainst them. They arrived because they were Carlyle\xe2\x80\x99s battle-scarred\r\ngiants who will not be kept down. And that is what I must do; I must\r\nachieve the impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you fail? You must consider me as well, Martin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I fail?\xe2\x80\x9d He regarded her for a moment as though the thought she had\r\nuttered was unthinkable. Then intelligence illumined his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nfail, I shall become an editor, and you will be an editor\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe frowned at his facetiousness\xe2\x80\x94a pretty, adorable frown that made him\r\nput his arm around her and kiss it away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she urged, by an effort of will withdrawing\r\nherself from the fascination of his strength. \xe2\x80\x9cI have talked with\r\nfather and mother. I never before asserted myself so against them. I\r\ndemanded to be heard. I was very undutiful. They are against you, you\r\nknow; but I assured them over and over of my abiding love for you, and\r\nat last father agreed that if you wanted to, you could begin right away\r\nin his office. And then, of his own accord, he said he would pay you\r\nenough at the start so that we could get married and have a little\r\ncottage somewhere. Which I think was very fine of him\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin, with the dull pain of despair at his heart, mechanically\r\nreaching for the tobacco and paper (which he no longer carried) to roll\r\na cigarette, muttered something inarticulate, and Ruth went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrankly, though, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let it hurt you\xe2\x80\x94I tell you, to show you\r\nprecisely how you stand with him\xe2\x80\x94he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like your radical views,\r\nand he thinks you are lazy. Of course I know you are not. I know you\r\nwork hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow hard, even she did not know, was the thought in Martin\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chow about my views? Do you think they are so\r\nradical?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held her eyes and waited the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think them, well, very disconcerting,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\nThe question was answered for him, and so oppressed was he by the\r\ngrayness of life that he forgot the tentative proposition she had made\r\nfor him to go to work. And she, having gone as far as she dared, was\r\nwilling to wait the answer till she should bring the question up again.\r\n\r\nShe had not long to wait. Martin had a question of his own to propound\r\nto her. He wanted to ascertain the measure of her faith in him, and\r\nwithin the week each was answered. Martin precipitated it by reading to\r\nher his \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you become a reporter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked when he had finished. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nlove writing so, and I am sure you would succeed. You could rise in\r\njournalism and make a name for yourself. There are a number of great\r\nspecial correspondents. Their salaries are large, and their field is\r\nthe world. They are sent everywhere, to the heart of Africa, like\r\nStanley, or to interview the Pope, or to explore unknown Thibet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t like my essay?\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cYou believe that I have\r\nsome show in journalism but none in literature?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I do like it. It reads well. But I am afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s over the\r\nheads of your readers. At least it is over mine. It sounds beautiful,\r\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. Your scientific slang is beyond me. You are\r\nan extremist, you know, dear, and what may be intelligible to you may\r\nnot be intelligible to the rest of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s the philosophic slang that bothers you,\xe2\x80\x9d was all he\r\ncould say.\r\n\r\nHe was flaming from the fresh reading of the ripest thought he had\r\nexpressed, and her verdict stunned him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter how poorly it is done,\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you see\r\nanything in it?\xe2\x80\x94in the thought of it, I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is so different from anything I have read. I read Maeterlinck\r\nand understand him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis mysticism, you understand that?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin flashed out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but this of yours, which is supposed to be an attack upon him, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Of course, if originality counts\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped her with an impatient gesture that was not followed by\r\nspeech. He became suddenly aware that she was speaking and that she had\r\nbeen speaking for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, your writing has been a toy to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you have played with it long enough. It is time to take up life\r\nseriously\xe2\x80\x94_our_ life, Martin. Hitherto you have lived solely your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want me to go to work?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Father has offered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand all that,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke in; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what I want to know is\r\nwhether or not you have lost faith in me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pressed his hand mutely, her eyes dim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn your writing, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted in a half-whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve read lots of my stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on brutally. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think\r\nof it? Is it utterly hopeless? How does it compare with other men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they sell theirs, and you\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer my question. Do you think that literature is not\r\nat all my vocation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will answer.\xe2\x80\x9d She steeled herself to do it. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\r\nwere made to write. Forgive me, dear. You compel me to say it; and you\r\nknow I know more about literature than you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are a Bachelor of Arts,\xe2\x80\x9d he said meditatively; \xe2\x80\x9cand you ought\r\nto know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is more to be said,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, after a pause painful to\r\nboth. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what I have in me. No one knows that so well as I. I know\r\nI shall succeed. I will not be kept down. I am afire with what I have\r\nto say in verse, and fiction, and essay. I do not ask you to have faith\r\nin that, though. I do not ask you to have faith in me, nor in my\r\nwriting. What I do ask of you is to love me and have faith in love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA year ago I begged for two years. One of those years is yet to run.\r\nAnd I do believe, upon my honor and my soul, that before that year is\r\nrun I shall have succeeded. You remember what you told me long ago,\r\nthat I must serve my apprenticeship to writing. Well, I have served it.\r\nI have crammed it and telescoped it. With you at the end awaiting me, I\r\nhave never shirked. Do you know, I have forgotten what it is to fall\r\npeacefully asleep. A few million years ago I knew what it was to sleep\r\nmy fill and to awake naturally from very glut of sleep. I am awakened\r\nalways now by an alarm clock. If I fall asleep early or late, I set the\r\nalarm accordingly; and this, and the putting out of the lamp, are my\r\nlast conscious actions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I begin to feel drowsy, I change the heavy book I am reading for\r\na lighter one. And when I doze over that, I beat my head with my\r\nknuckles in order to drive sleep away. Somewhere I read of a man who\r\nwas afraid to sleep. Kipling wrote the story. This man arranged a spur\r\nso that when unconsciousness came, his naked body pressed against the\r\niron teeth. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done the same. I look at the time, and I resolve\r\nthat not until midnight, or not until one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, or two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, or\r\nthree o\xe2\x80\x99clock, shall the spur be removed. And so it rowels me awake\r\nuntil the appointed time. That spur has been my bed-mate for months. I\r\nhave grown so desperate that five and a half hours of sleep is an\r\nextravagance. I sleep four hours now. I am starved for sleep. There are\r\ntimes when I am light-headed from want of sleep, times when death, with\r\nits rest and sleep, is a positive lure to me, times when I am haunted\r\nby Longfellow\xe2\x80\x99s lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The sea is still and deep;\r\nAll things within its bosom sleep;\r\nA single step and all is o\xe2\x80\x99er,\r\nA plunge, a bubble, and no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, this is sheer nonsense. It comes from nervousness, from an\r\noverwrought mind. But the point is: Why have I done this? For you. To\r\nshorten my apprenticeship. To compel Success to hasten. And my\r\napprenticeship is now served. I know my equipment. I swear that I learn\r\nmore each month than the average college man learns in a year. I know\r\nit, I tell you. But were my need for you to understand not so desperate\r\nI should not tell you. It is not boasting. I measure the results by the\r\nbooks. Your brothers, to-day, are ignorant barbarians compared with me\r\nand the knowledge I have wrung from the books in the hours they were\r\nsleeping. Long ago I wanted to be famous. I care very little for fame\r\nnow. What I want is you; I am more hungry for you than for food, or\r\nclothing, or recognition. I have a dream of laying my head on your\r\nbreast and sleeping an aeon or so, and the dream will come true ere\r\nanother year is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis power beat against her, wave upon wave; and in the moment his will\r\nopposed hers most she felt herself most strongly drawn toward him. The\r\nstrength that had always poured out from him to her was now flowering\r\nin his impassioned voice, his flashing eyes, and the vigor of life and\r\nintellect surging in him. And in that moment, and for the moment, she\r\nwas aware of a rift that showed in her certitude\xe2\x80\x94a rift through which\r\nshe caught sight of the real Martin Eden, splendid and invincible; and\r\nas animal-trainers have their moments of doubt, so she, for the\r\ninstant, seemed to doubt her power to tame this wild spirit of a man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd another thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he swept on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou love me. But why do you love me?\r\nThe thing in me that compels me to write is the very thing that draws\r\nyour love. You love me because I am somehow different from the men you\r\nhave known and might have loved. I was not made for the desk and\r\ncounting-house, for petty business squabbling, and legal jangling. Make\r\nme do such things, make me like those other men, doing the work they\r\ndo, breathing the air they breathe, developing the point of view they\r\nhave developed, and you have destroyed the difference, destroyed me,\r\ndestroyed the thing you love. My desire to write is the most vital\r\nthing in me. Had I been a mere clod, neither would I have desired to\r\nwrite, nor would you have desired me for a husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you forget,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted, the quick surface of her mind\r\nglimpsing a parallel. \xe2\x80\x9cThere have been eccentric inventors, starving\r\ntheir families while they sought such chimeras as perpetual motion.\r\nDoubtless their wives loved them, and suffered with them and for them,\r\nnot because of but in spite of their infatuation for perpetual motion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there have been inventors who were not\r\neccentric and who starved while they sought to invent practical things;\r\nand sometimes, it is recorded, they succeeded. Certainly I do not seek\r\nany impossibilities\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have called it \xe2\x80\x98achieving the impossible,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she interpolated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke figuratively. I seek to do what men have done before me\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nwrite and to live by my writing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer silence spurred him on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo you, then, my goal is as much a chimera as perpetual motion?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nHe read her answer in the pressure of her hand on his\xe2\x80\x94the pitying\r\nmother-hand for the hurt child. And to her, just then, he was the hurt\r\nchild, the infatuated man striving to achieve the impossible.\r\n\r\nToward the close of their talk she warned him again of the antagonism\r\nof her father and mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do! I do!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I love you, not them, and nothing they do can hurt me.\xe2\x80\x9d Triumph\r\nsounded in his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cFor I have faith in your love, not fear of their\r\nenmity. All things may go astray in this world, but not love. Love\r\ncannot go wrong unless it be a weakling that faints and stumbles by the\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin had encountered his sister Gertrude by chance on Broadway\xe2\x80\x94as it\r\nproved, a most propitious yet disconcerting chance. Waiting on the\r\ncorner for a car, she had seen him first, and noted the eager, hungry\r\nlines of his face and the desperate, worried look of his eyes. In\r\ntruth, he was desperate and worried. He had just come from a fruitless\r\ninterview with the pawnbroker, from whom he had tried to wring an\r\nadditional loan on his wheel. The muddy fall weather having come on,\r\nMartin had pledged his wheel some time since and retained his black\r\nsuit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the black suit,\xe2\x80\x9d the pawnbroker, who knew his every asset, had\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone and pledged it with that\r\nJew, Lipka. Because if you have\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man had looked the threat, and Martin hastened to cry:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it. But I want to wear it on a matter of business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d the mollified usurer had replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I want it on a\r\nmatter of business before I can let you have any more money. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99m in it for my health?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s a forty-dollar wheel, in good condition,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin had argued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve only let me have seven dollars on it. No, not even seven.\r\nSix and a quarter; you took the interest in advance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want some more, bring the suit,\xe2\x80\x9d had been the reply that sent\r\nMartin out of the stuffy little den, so desperate at heart as to\r\nreflect it in his face and touch his sister to pity.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they met when the Telegraph Avenue car came along and\r\nstopped to take on a crowd of afternoon shoppers. Mrs. Higginbotham\r\ndivined from the grip on her arm as he helped her on, that he was not\r\ngoing to follow her. She turned on the step and looked down upon him.\r\nHis haggard face smote her to the heart again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t you comin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\n\r\nThe next moment she had descended to his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m walking\xe2\x80\x94exercise, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll go along for a few blocks,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced. \xe2\x80\x9cMebbe it\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nme good. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t ben feelin\xe2\x80\x99 any too spry these last few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin glanced at her and verified her statement in her general\r\nslovenly appearance, in the unhealthy fat, in the drooping shoulders,\r\nthe tired face with the sagging lines, and in the heavy fall of her\r\nfeet, without elasticity\xe2\x80\x94a very caricature of the walk that belongs to\r\na free and happy body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better stop here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, though she had already come to a\r\nhalt at the first corner, \xe2\x80\x9cand take the next car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy goodness!\xe2\x80\x94if I ain\xe2\x80\x99t all tired a\xe2\x80\x99ready!\xe2\x80\x9d she panted. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m just\r\nas able to walk as you in them soles. They\xe2\x80\x99re that thin they\xe2\x80\x99ll bu\xe2\x80\x99st\r\nlong before you git out to North Oakland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a better pair at home,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome out to dinner to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she invited irrelevantly. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nHigginbotham won\xe2\x80\x99t be there. He\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99 to San Leandro on business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin shook his head, but he had failed to keep back the wolfish,\r\nhungry look that leapt into his eyes at the suggestion of dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t a penny, Mart, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99re walkin\xe2\x80\x99. Exercise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe tried to sniff contemptuously, but succeeded in producing only a\r\nsniffle. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, lemme see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, fumbling in her satchel, she pressed a five-dollar piece into his\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess I forgot your last birthday, Mart,\xe2\x80\x9d she mumbled lamely.\r\n\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s hand instinctively closed on the piece of gold. In the same\r\ninstant he knew he ought not to accept, and found himself struggling in\r\nthe throes of indecision. That bit of gold meant food, life, and light\r\nin his body and brain, power to go on writing, and\xe2\x80\x94who was to\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x94maybe to write something that would bring in many pieces of gold.\r\nClear on his vision burned the manuscripts of two essays he had just\r\ncompleted. He saw them under the table on top of the heap of returned\r\nmanuscripts for which he had no stamps, and he saw their titles, just\r\nas he had typed them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe High Priests of Mystery,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cradle of\r\nBeauty.\xe2\x80\x9d He had never submitted them anywhere. They were as good as\r\nanything he had done in that line. If only he had stamps for them! Then\r\nthe certitude of his ultimate success rose up in him, an able ally of\r\nhunger, and with a quick movement he slipped the coin into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you back, Gertrude, a hundred times over,\xe2\x80\x9d he gulped out, his\r\nthroat painfully contracted and in his eyes a swift hint of moisture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMark my words!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried with abrupt positiveness. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore the year is\r\nout I\xe2\x80\x99ll put an even hundred of those little yellow-boys into your\r\nhand. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to believe me. All you have to do is wait and\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNor did she believe. Her incredulity made her uncomfortable, and\r\nfailing of other expedient, she said:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry, Mart. It\xe2\x80\x99s sticking out all over you. Come in to\r\nmeals any time. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send one of the children to tell you when Mr.\r\nHigginbotham ain\xe2\x80\x99t to be there. An\xe2\x80\x99 Mart\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited, though he knew in his secret heart what she was about to\r\nsay, so visible was her thought process to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s about time you got a job?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll win out?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody has faith in me, Gertrude, except myself.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was\r\npassionately rebellious. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done good work already, plenty of it,\r\nand sooner or later it will sell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know it is good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He faltered as the whole vast field of literature and the\r\nhistory of literature stirred in his brain and pointed the futility of\r\nhis attempting to convey to her the reasons for his faith. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s better than ninety-nine per cent of what is published in\r\nthe magazines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x99d listen to reason,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered feebly, but with\r\nunwavering belief in the correctness of her diagnosis of what was\r\nailing him. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x99d listen to reason,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 come\r\nto dinner to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter Martin had helped her on the car, he hurried to the post-office\r\nand invested three of the five dollars in stamps; and when, later in\r\nthe day, on the way to the Morse home, he stopped in at the post-office\r\nto weigh a large number of long, bulky envelopes, he affixed to them\r\nall the stamps save three of the two-cent denomination.\r\n\r\nIt proved a momentous night for Martin, for after dinner he met Russ\r\nBrissenden. How he chanced to come there, whose friend he was or what\r\nacquaintance brought him, Martin did not know. Nor had he the curiosity\r\nto inquire about him of Ruth. In short, Brissenden struck Martin as\r\nanaemic and feather-brained, and was promptly dismissed from his mind.\r\nAn hour later he decided that Brissenden was a boor as well, what of\r\nthe way he prowled about from one room to another, staring at the\r\npictures or poking his nose into books and magazines he picked up from\r\nthe table or drew from the shelves. Though a stranger in the house he\r\nfinally isolated himself in the midst of the company, huddling into a\r\ncapacious Morris chair and reading steadily from a thin volume he had\r\ndrawn from his pocket. As he read, he abstractedly ran his fingers,\r\nwith a caressing movement, through his hair. Martin noticed him no more\r\nthat evening, except once when he observed him chaffing with great\r\napparent success with several of the young women.\r\n\r\nIt chanced that when Martin was leaving, he overtook Brissenden already\r\nhalf down the walk to the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, is that you?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said.\r\n\r\nThe other replied with an ungracious grunt, but swung alongside. Martin\r\nmade no further attempt at conversation, and for several blocks\r\nunbroken silence lay upon them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPompous old ass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suddenness and the virulence of the exclamation startled Martin. He\r\nfelt amused, and at the same time was aware of a growing dislike for\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you go to such a place for?\xe2\x80\x9d was abruptly flung at him after\r\nanother block of silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin countered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d came back. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least this is my first\r\nindiscretion. There are twenty-four hours in each day, and I must spend\r\nthem somehow. Come and have a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered.\r\n\r\nThe next moment he was nonplussed by the readiness of his acceptance.\r\nAt home was several hours\xe2\x80\x99 hack-work waiting for him before he went to\r\nbed, and after he went to bed there was a volume of Weismann waiting\r\nfor him, to say nothing of Herbert Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s Autobiography, which was\r\nas replete for him with romance as any thrilling novel. Why should he\r\nwaste any time with this man he did not like? was his thought. And yet,\r\nit was not so much the man nor the drink as was it what was associated\r\nwith the drink\xe2\x80\x94the bright lights, the mirrors and dazzling array of\r\nglasses, the warm and glowing faces and the resonant hum of the voices\r\nof men. That was it, it was the voices of men, optimistic men, men who\r\nbreathed success and spent their money for drinks like men. He was\r\nlonely, that was what was the matter with him; that was why he had\r\nsnapped at the invitation as a bonita strikes at a white rag on a hook.\r\nNot since with Joe, at Shelly Hot Springs, with the one exception of\r\nthe wine he took with the Portuguese grocer, had Martin had a drink at\r\na public bar. Mental exhaustion did not produce a craving for liquor\r\nsuch as physical exhaustion did, and he had felt no need for it. But\r\njust now he felt desire for the drink, or, rather, for the atmosphere\r\nwherein drinks were dispensed and disposed of. Such a place was the\r\nGrotto, where Brissenden and he lounged in capacious leather chairs and\r\ndrank Scotch and soda.\r\n\r\nThey talked. They talked about many things, and now Brissenden and now\r\nMartin took turn in ordering Scotch and soda. Martin, who was extremely\r\nstrong-headed, marvelled at the other\xe2\x80\x99s capacity for liquor, and ever\r\nand anon broke off to marvel at the other\xe2\x80\x99s conversation. He was not\r\nlong in assuming that Brissenden knew everything, and in deciding that\r\nhere was the second intellectual man he had met. But he noted that\r\nBrissenden had what Professor Caldwell lacked\xe2\x80\x94namely, fire, the\r\nflashing insight and perception, the flaming uncontrol of genius.\r\nLiving language flowed from him. His thin lips, like the dies of a\r\nmachine, stamped out phrases that cut and stung; or again, pursing\r\ncaressingly about the inchoate sound they articulated, the thin lips\r\nshaped soft and velvety things, mellow phrases of glow and glory, of\r\nhaunting beauty, reverberant of the mystery and inscrutableness of\r\nlife; and yet again the thin lips were like a bugle, from which rang\r\nthe crash and tumult of cosmic strife, phrases that sounded clear as\r\nsilver, that were luminous as starry spaces, that epitomized the final\r\nword of science and yet said something more\xe2\x80\x94the poet\xe2\x80\x99s word, the\r\ntranscendental truth, elusive and without words which could express,\r\nand which none the less found expression in the subtle and all but\r\nungraspable connotations of common words. He, by some wonder of vision,\r\nsaw beyond the farthest outpost of empiricism, where was no language\r\nfor narration, and yet, by some golden miracle of speech, investing\r\nknown words with unknown significances, he conveyed to Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsciousness messages that were incommunicable to ordinary souls.\r\n\r\nMartin forgot his first impression of dislike. Here was the best the\r\nbooks had to offer coming true. Here was an intelligence, a living man\r\nfor him to look up to. \xe2\x80\x9cI am down in the dirt at your feet,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin\r\nrepeated to himself again and again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve studied biology,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud, in significant allusion.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise Brissenden shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are stating truths that are substantiated only by biology,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMartin insisted, and was rewarded by a blank stare. \xe2\x80\x9cYour conclusions\r\nare in line with the books which you must have read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cThat my smattering of\r\nknowledge should enable me to short-cut my way to truth is most\r\nreassuring. As for myself, I never bother to find out if I am right or\r\nnot. It is all valueless anyway. Man can never know the ultimate\r\nverities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a disciple of Spencer!\xe2\x80\x9d Martin cried triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t read him since adolescence, and all I read then was his\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Education.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could gather knowledge as carelessly,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin broke out half\r\nan hour later. He had been closely analyzing Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s mental\r\nequipment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a sheer dogmatist, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes it so\r\nmarvellous. You state dogmatically the latest facts which science has\r\nbeen able to establish only by _\xc3\xa0 posteriori_ reasoning. You jump at\r\ncorrect conclusions. You certainly short-cut with a vengeance. You feel\r\nyour way with the speed of light, by some hyperrational process, to\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that was what used to bother Father Joseph, and Brother Dutton,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBrissenden replied. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9cI am not anything. It was a\r\nlucky trick of fate that sent me to a Catholic college for my\r\neducation. Where did you pick up what you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd while Martin told him, he was busy studying Brissenden, ranging\r\nfrom a long, lean, aristocratic face and drooping shoulders to the\r\novercoat on a neighboring chair, its pockets sagged and bulged by the\r\nfreightage of many books. Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s face and long, slender hands\r\nwere browned by the sun\xe2\x80\x94excessively browned, Martin thought. This\r\nsunburn bothered Martin. It was patent that Brissenden was no outdoor\r\nman. Then how had he been ravaged by the sun? Something morbid and\r\nsignificant attached to that sunburn, was Martin\xe2\x80\x99s thought as he\r\nreturned to a study of the face, narrow, with high cheek-bones and\r\ncavernous hollows, and graced with as delicate and fine an aquiline\r\nnose as Martin had ever seen. There was nothing remarkable about the\r\nsize of the eyes. They were neither large nor small, while their color\r\nwas a nondescript brown; but in them smouldered a fire, or, rather,\r\nlurked an expression dual and strangely contradictory. Defiant,\r\nindomitable, even harsh to excess, they at the same time aroused pity.\r\nMartin found himself pitying him he knew not why, though he was soon to\r\nlearn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m a lunger,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden announced, offhand, a little later,\r\nhaving already stated that he came from Arizona. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been down there\r\na couple of years living on the climate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid to venture it up in this climate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no special emphasis of his repetition of Martin\xe2\x80\x99s word. But\r\nMartin saw in that ascetic face the advertisement that there was\r\nnothing of which it was afraid. The eyes had narrowed till they were\r\neagle-like, and Martin almost caught his breath as he noted the eagle\r\nbeak with its dilated nostrils, defiant, assertive, aggressive.\r\nMagnificent, was what he commented to himself, his blood thrilling at\r\nthe sight. Aloud, he quoted:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Under the bludgeoning of Chance\r\n    My head is bloody but unbowed.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like Henley,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden said, his expression changing swiftly to\r\nlarge graciousness and tenderness. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have expected\r\nanything else of you. Ah, Henley! A brave soul. He stands out among\r\ncontemporary rhymesters\xe2\x80\x94magazine rhymesters\xe2\x80\x94as a gladiator stands out\r\nin the midst of a band of eunuchs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like the magazines,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin softly impeached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d was snarled back at him so savagely as to startle him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I write, or, rather, try to write, for the magazines,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin\r\nfaltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s better,\xe2\x80\x9d was the mollified rejoinder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou try to write, but\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t succeed. I respect and admire your failure. I know what you\r\nwrite. I can see it with half an eye, and there\xe2\x80\x99s one ingredient in it\r\nthat shuts it out of the magazines. It\xe2\x80\x99s guts, and magazines have no\r\nuse for that particular commodity. What they want is wish-wash and\r\nslush, and God knows they get it, but not from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not above hack-work,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin contended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden paused and ran an insolent eye over\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s objective poverty, passing from the well-worn tie and the\r\nsaw-edged collar to the shiny sleeves of the coat and on to the slight\r\nfray of one cuff, winding up and dwelling upon Martin\xe2\x80\x99s sunken cheeks.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, hack-work is above you, so far above you that you can\r\nnever hope to rise to it. Why, man, I could insult you by asking you to\r\nhave something to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin felt the heat in his face of the involuntary blood, and\r\nBrissenden laughed triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA full man is not insulted by such an invitation,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a devil,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin cried irritably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that. I invite you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrissenden half rose from his chair as he spoke, as if with the\r\nintention of departing to the restaurant forthwith.\r\n\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s fists were tight-clenched, and his blood was drumming in his\r\ntemples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBosco! He eats \xe2\x80\x99em alive! Eats \xe2\x80\x99em alive!\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden exclaimed,\r\nimitating the _spieler_ of a locally famous snake-eater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could certainly eat you alive,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, in turn running\r\ninsolent eyes over the other\xe2\x80\x99s disease-ravaged frame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly I\xe2\x80\x99m not worthy of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin considered, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the incident is not\r\nworthy.\xe2\x80\x9d He broke into a laugh, hearty and wholesome. \xe2\x80\x9cI confess you\r\nmade a fool of me, Brissenden. That I am hungry and you are aware of it\r\nare only ordinary phenomena, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no disgrace. You see, I laugh\r\nat the conventional little moralities of the herd; then you drift by,\r\nsay a sharp, true word, and immediately I am the slave of the same\r\nlittle moralities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were insulted,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden affirmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly was, a moment ago. The prejudice of early youth, you know.\r\nI learned such things then, and they cheapen what I have since learned.\r\nThey are the skeletons in my particular closet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the door shut on them now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let\xe2\x80\x99s go and get something to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go you,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered, attempting to pay for the current\r\nScotch and soda with the last change from his two dollars and seeing\r\nthe waiter bullied by Brissenden into putting that change back on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nMartin pocketed it with a grimace, and felt for a moment the kindly\r\nweight of Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPromptly, the next afternoon, Maria was excited by Martin\xe2\x80\x99s second\r\nvisitor. But she did not lose her head this time, for she seated\r\nBrissenden in her parlor\xe2\x80\x99s grandeur of respectability.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my coming?\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered, shaking hands and waving him to\r\nthe solitary chair, himself taking to the bed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how did you know\r\nwhere I lived?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalled up the Morses. Miss Morse answered the \xe2\x80\x99phone. And here I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe tugged at his coat pocket and flung a thin volume on the table.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a book, by a poet. Read it and keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, in reply to\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s protest: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I to do with books? I had another\r\nhemorrhage this morning. Got any whiskey? No, of course not. Wait a\r\nminute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was off and away. Martin watched his long figure go down the outside\r\nsteps, and, on turning to close the gate, noted with a pang the\r\nshoulders, which had once been broad, drawn in now over the collapsed\r\nruin of the chest. Martin got two tumblers, and fell to reading the\r\nbook of verse, Henry Vaughn Marlow\xe2\x80\x99s latest collection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo Scotch,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden announced on his return. \xe2\x80\x9cThe beggar sells\r\nnothing but American whiskey. But here\xe2\x80\x99s a quart of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send one of the youngsters for lemons, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make a toddy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMartin offered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what a book like that will earn Marlow?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, holding\r\nup the volume in question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly fifty dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d came the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cThough he\xe2\x80\x99s lucky if he\r\npulls even on it, or if he can inveigle a publisher to risk bringing it\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen one can\xe2\x80\x99t make a living out of poetry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s tone and face alike showed his dejection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. What fool expects to? Out of rhyming, yes. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBruce, and Virginia Spring, and Sedgwick. They do very nicely. But\r\npoetry\xe2\x80\x94do you know how Vaughn Marlow makes his living?\xe2\x80\x94teaching in a\r\nboys\xe2\x80\x99 cramming-joint down in Pennsylvania, and of all private little\r\nhells such a billet is the limit. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trade places with him if\r\nhe had fifty years of life before him. And yet his work stands out from\r\nthe ruck of the contemporary versifiers as a balas ruby among carrots.\r\nAnd the reviews he gets! Damn them, all of them, the crass manikins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much is written by the men who can\xe2\x80\x99t write about the men who do\r\nwrite,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin concurred. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I was appalled at the quantities of\r\nrubbish written about Stevenson and his work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGhouls and harpies!\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden snapped out with clicking teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nI know the spawn\xe2\x80\x94complacently pecking at him for his Father Damien\r\nletter, analyzing him, weighing him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeasuring him by the yardstick of their own miserable egos,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin\r\nbroke in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, a good phrase,\xe2\x80\x94mouthing and besliming the True, and\r\nBeautiful, and Good, and finally patting him on the back and saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good dog, Fido.\xe2\x80\x99 Faugh! \xe2\x80\x98The little chattering daws of men,\xe2\x80\x99 Richard\r\nRealf called them the night he died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPecking at star-dust,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin took up the strain warmly; \xe2\x80\x9cat the\r\nmeteoric flight of the master-men. I once wrote a squib on them\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncritics, or the reviewers, rather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see it,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden begged eagerly.\r\n\r\nSo Martin unearthed a carbon copy of \xe2\x80\x9cStar-dust,\xe2\x80\x9d and during the\r\nreading of it Brissenden chuckled, rubbed his hands, and forgot to sip\r\nhis toddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrikes me you\xe2\x80\x99re a bit of star-dust yourself, flung into a world of\r\ncowled gnomes who cannot see,\xe2\x80\x9d was his comment at the end of it. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse it was snapped up by the first magazine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin ran over the pages of his manuscript book. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been refused\r\nby twenty-seven of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrissenden essayed a long and hearty laugh, but broke down in a fit of\r\ncoughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you haven\xe2\x80\x99t tackled poetry,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nme see some of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t read it now,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to talk with you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake up a bundle and you can take it home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrissenden departed with the \xe2\x80\x9cLove-cycle,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Peri and the\r\nPearl,\xe2\x80\x9d returning next day to greet Martin with:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot only did he assure Martin that he was a poet, but Martin learned\r\nthat Brissenden also was one. He was swept off his feet by the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, and astounded that no attempt had been made to publish it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA plague on all their houses!\xe2\x80\x9d was Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s answer to Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvolunteering to market his work for him. \xe2\x80\x9cLove Beauty for its own\r\nsake,\xe2\x80\x9d was his counsel, \xe2\x80\x9cand leave the magazines alone. Back to your\r\nships and your sea\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s my advice to you, Martin Eden. What do you\r\nwant in these sick and rotten cities of men? You are cutting your\r\nthroat every day you waste in them trying to prostitute beauty to the\r\nneeds of magazinedom. What was it you quoted me the other day?\xe2\x80\x94Oh, yes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Man, the latest of the ephemera.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, what do you, the latest of the\r\nephemera, want with fame? If you got it, it would be poison to you. You\r\nare too simple, too elemental, and too rational, by my faith, to\r\nprosper on such pap. I hope you never do sell a line to the magazines.\r\nBeauty is the only master to serve. Serve her and damn the multitude!\r\nSuccess! What in hell\xe2\x80\x99s success if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t right there in your\r\nStevenson sonnet, which outranks Henley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Apparition,\xe2\x80\x99 in that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Love-cycle,\xe2\x80\x99 in those sea-poems?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not in what you succeed in doing that you get your joy, but in\r\nthe doing of it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. I know it. You know it. Beauty\r\nhurts you. It is an everlasting pain in you, a wound that does not\r\nheal, a knife of flame. Why should you palter with magazines? Let\r\nbeauty be your end. Why should you mint beauty into gold? Anyway, you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t; so there\xe2\x80\x99s no use in my getting excited over it. You can read\r\nthe magazines for a thousand years and you won\xe2\x80\x99t find the value of one\r\nline of Keats. Leave fame and coin alone, sign away on a ship\r\nto-morrow, and go back to your sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for fame, but for love,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cLove seems to have no\r\nplace in your Cosmos; in mine, Beauty is the handmaiden of Love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrissenden looked at him pityingly and admiringly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are so young,\r\nMartin boy, so young. You will flutter high, but your wings are of the\r\nfinest gauze, dusted with the fairest pigments. Do not scorch them. But\r\nof course you have scorched them already. It required some glorified\r\npetticoat to account for that \xe2\x80\x98Love-cycle,\xe2\x80\x99 and that\xe2\x80\x99s the shame of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt glorifies love as well as the petticoat,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe philosophy of madness,\xe2\x80\x9d was the retort. \xe2\x80\x9cSo have I assured myself\r\nwhen wandering in hasheesh dreams. But beware. These bourgeois cities\r\nwill kill you. Look at that den of traitors where I met you. Dry rot is\r\nno name for it. One can\xe2\x80\x99t keep his sanity in such an atmosphere. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndegrading. There\xe2\x80\x99s not one of them who is not degrading, man and woman,\r\nall of them animated stomachs guided by the high intellectual and\r\nartistic impulses of clams\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off suddenly and regarded Martin. Then, with a flash of\r\ndivination, he saw the situation. The expression on his face turned to\r\nwondering horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you wrote that tremendous \xe2\x80\x98Love-cycle\xe2\x80\x99 to her\xe2\x80\x94that pale,\r\nshrivelled, female thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next instant Martin\xe2\x80\x99s right hand had shot to a throttling clutch on\r\nhis throat, and he was being shaken till his teeth rattled. But Martin,\r\nlooking into his eyes, saw no fear there,\xe2\x80\x94naught but a curious and\r\nmocking devil. Martin remembered himself, and flung Brissenden, by the\r\nneck, sidelong upon the bed, at the same moment releasing his hold.\r\n\r\nBrissenden panted and gasped painfully for a moment, then began to\r\nchuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had made me eternally your debtor had you shaken out the flame,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy nerves are on a hair-trigger these days,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin apologized. \xe2\x80\x9cHope\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you. Here, let me mix a fresh toddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you young Greek!\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you take just\r\npride in that body of yours. You are devilish strong. You are a young\r\npanther, a lion cub. Well, well, it is you who must pay for that\r\nstrength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin asked curiously, passing him a glass. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\r\ndown this and be good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden sipped his toddy and smiled appreciation of it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the women. They will worry you until you die, as they have\r\nalready worried you, or else I was born yesterday. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s no use\r\nin your choking me; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have my say. This is undoubtedly your\r\ncalf love; but for Beauty\xe2\x80\x99s sake show better taste next time. What\r\nunder heaven do you want with a daughter of the bourgeoisie? Leave them\r\nalone. Pick out some great, wanton flame of a woman, who laughs at life\r\nand jeers at death and loves one while she may. There are such women,\r\nand they will love you just as readily as any pusillanimous product of\r\nbourgeois sheltered life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPusillanimous?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so, pusillanimous; prattling out little moralities that have been\r\nprattled into them, and afraid to live life. They will love you,\r\nMartin, but they will love their little moralities more. What you want\r\nis the magnificent abandon of life, the great free souls, the blazing\r\nbutterflies and not the little gray moths. Oh, you will grow tired of\r\nthem, too, of all the female things, if you are unlucky enough to live.\r\nBut you won\xe2\x80\x99t live. You won\xe2\x80\x99t go back to your ships and sea; therefore,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll hang around these pest-holes of cities until your bones are\r\nrotten, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ll die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can lecture me, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t make me talk back,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, you have but the wisdom of your temperament, and the wisdom\r\nof my temperament is just as unimpeachable as yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey disagreed about love, and the magazines, and many things, but they\r\nliked each other, and on Martin\xe2\x80\x99s part it was no less than a profound\r\nliking. Day after day they were together, if for no more than the hour\r\nBrissenden spent in Martin\xe2\x80\x99s stuffy room. Brissenden never arrived\r\nwithout his quart of whiskey, and when they dined together down-town,\r\nhe drank Scotch and soda throughout the meal. He invariably paid the\r\nway for both, and it was through him that Martin learned the\r\nrefinements of food, drank his first champagne, and made acquaintance\r\nwith Rhenish wines.\r\n\r\nBut Brissenden was always an enigma. With the face of an ascetic, he\r\nwas, in all the failing blood of him, a frank voluptuary. He was\r\nunafraid to die, bitter and cynical of all the ways of living; and yet,\r\ndying, he loved life, to the last atom of it. He was possessed by a\r\nmadness to live, to thrill, \xe2\x80\x9cto squirm my little space in the cosmic\r\ndust whence I came,\xe2\x80\x9d as he phrased it once himself. He had tampered\r\nwith drugs and done many strange things in quest of new thrills, new\r\nsensations. As he told Martin, he had once gone three days without\r\nwater, had done so voluntarily, in order to experience the exquisite\r\ndelight of such a thirst assuaged. Who or what he was, Martin never\r\nlearned. He was a man without a past, whose future was the imminent\r\ngrave and whose present was a bitter fever of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin was steadily losing his battle. Economize as he would, the\r\nearnings from hack-work did not balance expenses. Thanksgiving found\r\nhim with his black suit in pawn and unable to accept the Morses\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninvitation to dinner. Ruth was not made happy by his reason for not\r\ncoming, and the corresponding effect on him was one of desperation. He\r\ntold her that he would come, after all; that he would go over to San\r\nFrancisco, to the _Transcontinental_ office, collect the five dollars\r\ndue him, and with it redeem his suit of clothes.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he borrowed ten cents from Maria. He would have borrowed\r\nit, by preference, from Brissenden, but that erratic individual had\r\ndisappeared. Two weeks had passed since Martin had seen him, and he\r\nvainly cudgelled his brains for some cause of offence. The ten cents\r\ncarried Martin across the ferry to San Francisco, and as he walked up\r\nMarket Street he speculated upon his predicament in case he failed to\r\ncollect the money. There would then be no way for him to return to\r\nOakland, and he knew no one in San Francisco from whom to borrow\r\nanother ten cents.\r\n\r\nThe door to the _Transcontinental_ office was ajar, and Martin, in the\r\nact of opening it, was brought to a sudden pause by a loud voice from\r\nwithin, which exclaimed:- \xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not the question, Mr. Ford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(Ford, Martin knew, from his correspondence, to be the editor\xe2\x80\x99s name.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question is, are you prepared to pay?\xe2\x80\x94cash, and cash down, I mean?\r\nI am not interested in the prospects of the _Transcontinental_ and what\r\nyou expect to make it next year. What I want is to be paid for what I\r\ndo. And I tell you, right now, the Christmas _Transcontinental_ don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo to press till I have the money in my hand. Good day. When you get\r\nthe money, come and see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door jerked open, and the man flung past Martin, with an angry\r\ncountenance and went down the corridor, muttering curses and clenching\r\nhis fists. Martin decided not to enter immediately, and lingered in the\r\nhallways for a quarter of an hour. Then he shoved the door open and\r\nwalked in. It was a new experience, the first time he had been inside\r\nan editorial office. Cards evidently were not necessary in that office,\r\nfor the boy carried word to an inner room that there was a man who\r\nwanted to see Mr. Ford. Returning, the boy beckoned him from halfway\r\nacross the room and led him to the private office, the editorial\r\nsanctum. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s first impression was of the disorder and cluttered\r\nconfusion of the room. Next he noticed a bewhiskered, youthful-looking\r\nman, sitting at a roll-top desk, who regarded him curiously. Martin\r\nmarvelled at the calm repose of his face. It was evident that the\r\nsquabble with the printer had not affected his equanimity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I am Martin Eden,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin began the conversation. (\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I want my\r\nfive dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d was what he would have liked to say.)\r\n\r\nBut this was his first editor, and under the circumstances he did not\r\ndesire to scare him too abruptly. To his surprise, Mr. Ford leaped into\r\nthe air with a \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d and the next moment, with both\r\nhands, was shaking Martin\xe2\x80\x99s hand effusively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t say how glad I am to see you, Mr. Eden. Often wondered what you\r\nwere like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere he held Martin off at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length and ran his beaming eyes over\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s second-best suit, which was also his worst suit, and which was\r\nragged and past repair, though the trousers showed the careful crease\r\nhe had put in with Maria\xe2\x80\x99s flat-irons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess, though, I conceived you to be a much older man than you\r\nare. Your story, you know, showed such breadth, and vigor, such\r\nmaturity and depth of thought. A masterpiece, that story\xe2\x80\x94I knew it when\r\nI had read the first half-dozen lines. Let me tell you how I first read\r\nit. But no; first let me introduce you to the staff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill talking, Mr. Ford led him into the general office, where he\r\nintroduced him to the associate editor, Mr. White, a slender, frail\r\nlittle man whose hand seemed strangely cold, as if he were suffering\r\nfrom a chill, and whose whiskers were sparse and silky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Ends, Mr. Eden. Mr. Ends is our business manager, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin found himself shaking hands with a cranky-eyed, bald-headed man,\r\nwhose face looked youthful enough from what little could be seen of it,\r\nfor most of it was covered by a snow-white beard, carefully trimmed\xe2\x80\x94by\r\nhis wife, who did it on Sundays, at which times she also shaved the\r\nback of his neck.\r\n\r\nThe three men surrounded Martin, all talking admiringly and at once,\r\nuntil it seemed to him that they were talking against time for a wager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe often wondered why you didn\xe2\x80\x99t call,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. White was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the carfare, and I live across the Bay,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered\r\nbluntly, with the idea of showing them his imperative need for the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nSurely, he thought to himself, my glad rags in themselves are eloquent\r\nadvertisement of my need. Time and again, whenever opportunity offered,\r\nhe hinted about the purpose of his business. But his admirers\xe2\x80\x99 ears\r\nwere deaf. They sang his praises, told him what they had thought of his\r\nstory at first sight, what they subsequently thought, what their wives\r\nand families thought; but not one hint did they breathe of intention to\r\npay him for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I tell you how I first read your story?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ford said. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I was coming west from New York, and when the train stopped\r\nat Ogden, the train-boy on the new run brought aboard the current\r\nnumber of the _Transcontinental_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy God! Martin thought; you can travel in a Pullman while I starve for\r\nthe paltry five dollars you owe me. A wave of anger rushed over him.\r\nThe wrong done him by the _Transcontinental_ loomed colossal, for\r\nstrong upon him were all the dreary months of vain yearning, of hunger\r\nand privation, and his present hunger awoke and gnawed at him,\r\nreminding him that he had eaten nothing since the day before, and\r\nlittle enough then. For the moment he saw red. These creatures were not\r\neven robbers. They were sneak-thieves. By lies and broken promises they\r\nhad tricked him out of his story. Well, he would show them. And a great\r\nresolve surged into his will to the effect that he would not leave the\r\noffice until he got his money. He remembered, if he did not get it,\r\nthat there was no way for him to go back to Oakland. He controlled\r\nhimself with an effort, but not before the wolfish expression of his\r\nface had awed and perturbed them.\r\n\r\nThey became more voluble than ever. Mr. Ford started anew to tell how\r\nhe had first read \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ring of Bells,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Ends at the same time\r\nwas striving to repeat his niece\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ring of Bells,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid niece being a school-teacher in Alameda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I came for,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said finally. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be paid for\r\nthat story all of you like so well. Five dollars, I believe, is what\r\nyou promised me would be paid on publication.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Ford, with an expression on his mobile features of mediate and\r\nhappy acquiescence, started to reach for his pocket, then turned\r\nsuddenly to Mr. Ends, and said that he had left his money home. That\r\nMr. Ends resented this, was patent; and Martin saw the twitch of his\r\narm as if to protect his trousers pocket. Martin knew that the money\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Ends, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I paid the printer not an hour ago,\r\nand he took my ready change. It was careless of me to be so short; but\r\nthe bill was not yet due, and the printer\xe2\x80\x99s request, as a favor, to\r\nmake an immediate advance, was quite unexpected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth men looked expectantly at Mr. White, but that gentleman laughed\r\nand shrugged his shoulders. His conscience was clean at any rate. He\r\nhad come into the _Transcontinental_ to learn magazine-literature,\r\ninstead of which he had principally learned finance. The\r\n_Transcontinental_ owed him four months\xe2\x80\x99 salary, and he knew that the\r\nprinter must be appeased before the associate editor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather absurd, Mr. Eden, to have caught us in this shape,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nFord preambled airily. \xe2\x80\x9cAll carelessness, I assure you. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do. We\xe2\x80\x99ll mail you a check the first thing in the\r\nmorning. You have Mr. Eden\xe2\x80\x99s address, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mr. Ends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, Mr. Ends had the address, and the check would be mailed the first\r\nthing in the morning. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of banks and checks was hazy,\r\nbut he could see no reason why they should not give him the check on\r\nthis day just as well as on the next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is understood, Mr. Eden, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll mail you the check\r\nto-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ford said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need the money to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered stolidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe unfortunate circumstances\xe2\x80\x94if you had chanced here any other day,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMr. Ford began suavely, only to be interrupted by Mr. Ends, whose\r\ncranky eyes justified themselves in his shortness of temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Ford has already explained the situation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with asperity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so have I. The check will be mailed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also have explained,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin broke in, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have explained that I\r\nwant the money to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had felt his pulse quicken a trifle at the business manager\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrusqueness, and upon him he kept an alert eye, for it was in that\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s trousers pocket that he divined the _Transcontinental\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\nready cash was reposing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too bad\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ford began.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment, with an impatient movement, Mr. Ends turned as if\r\nabout to leave the room. At the same instant Martin sprang for him,\r\nclutching him by the throat with one hand in such fashion that Mr.\r\nEnds\xe2\x80\x99 snow-white beard, still maintaining its immaculate trimness,\r\npointed ceilingward at an angle of forty-five degrees. To the horror of\r\nMr. White and Mr. Ford, they saw their business manager shaken like an\r\nAstrakhan rug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDig up, you venerable discourager of rising young talent!\xe2\x80\x9d Martin\r\nexhorted. \xe2\x80\x9cDig up, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll shake it out of you, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s all in\r\nnickels.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, to the two affrighted onlookers: \xe2\x80\x9cKeep away! If you\r\ninterfere, somebody\xe2\x80\x99s liable to get hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Ends was choking, and it was not until the grip on his throat was\r\neased that he was able to signify his acquiescence in the digging-up\r\nprogramme. All together, after repeated digs, its trousers pocket\r\nyielded four dollars and fifteen cents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInside out with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin commanded.\r\n\r\nAn additional ten cents fell out. Martin counted the result of his raid\r\na second time to make sure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou next!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted at Mr. Ford. \xe2\x80\x9cI want seventy-five cents more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Ford did not wait, but ransacked his pockets, with the result of\r\nsixty cents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure that is all?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin demanded menacingly, possessing himself of\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got in your vest pockets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn token of his good faith, Mr. Ford turned two of his pockets inside\r\nout. A strip of cardboard fell to the floor from one of them. He\r\nrecovered it and was in the act of returning it, when Martin cried:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x94A ferry ticket? Here, give it to me. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth ten\r\ncents. I\xe2\x80\x99ll credit you with it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve now got four dollars and\r\nninety-five cents, including the ticket. Five cents is still due me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked fiercely at Mr. White, and found that fragile creature in the\r\nact of handing him a nickel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, addressing them collectively. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you a\r\ngood day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobber!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ends snarled after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSneak-thief!\xe2\x80\x9d Martin retorted, slamming the door as he passed out.\r\n\r\nMartin was elated\xe2\x80\x94so elated that when he recollected that _The Hornet_\r\nowed him fifteen dollars for \xe2\x80\x9cThe Peri and the Pearl,\xe2\x80\x9d he decided\r\nforthwith to go and collect it. But _The Hornet_ was run by a set of\r\nclean-shaven, strapping young men, frank buccaneers who robbed\r\neverything and everybody, not excepting one another. After some\r\nbreakage of the office furniture, the editor (an ex-college athlete),\r\nably assisted by the business manager, an advertising agent, and the\r\nporter, succeeded in removing Martin from the office and in\r\naccelerating, by initial impulse, his descent of the first flight of\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome again, Mr. Eden; glad to see you any time,\xe2\x80\x9d they laughed down at\r\nhim from the landing above.\r\n\r\nMartin grinned as he picked himself up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhew!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured back. \xe2\x80\x9cThe _Transcontinental_ crowd were\r\nnanny-goats, but you fellows are a lot of prize-fighters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore laughter greeted this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say, Mr. Eden,\xe2\x80\x9d the editor of _The Hornet_ called down, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nfor a poet you can go some yourself. Where did you learn that right\r\ncross\xe2\x80\x94if I may ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you learned that half-Nelson,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngoing to have a black eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope your neck doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stiffen up,\xe2\x80\x9d the editor wished solicitously:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say we all go out and have a drink on it\xe2\x80\x94not the neck, of\r\ncourse, but the little rough-house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go you if I lose,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin accepted.\r\n\r\nAnd robbers and robbed drank together, amicably agreeing that the\r\nbattle was to the strong, and that the fifteen dollars for \xe2\x80\x9cThe Peri\r\nand the Pearl\xe2\x80\x9d belonged by right to _The Hornet\xe2\x80\x99s_ editorial staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur remained at the gate while Ruth climbed Maria\xe2\x80\x99s front steps. She\r\nheard the rapid click of the type-writer, and when Martin let her in,\r\nfound him on the last page of a manuscript. She had come to make\r\ncertain whether or not he would be at their table for Thanksgiving\r\ndinner; but before she could broach the subject Martin plunged into the\r\none with which he was full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, let me read you this,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, separating the carbon copies\r\nand running the pages of manuscript into shape. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my latest, and\r\ndifferent from anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve done. It is so altogether different that I\r\nam almost afraid of it, and yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve a sneaking idea it is good. You be\r\njudge. It\xe2\x80\x99s an Hawaiian story. I\xe2\x80\x99ve called it \xe2\x80\x98Wiki-wiki.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face was bright with the creative glow, though she shivered in the\r\ncold room and had been struck by the coldness of his hands at greeting.\r\nShe listened closely while he read, and though he from time to time had\r\nseen only disapprobation in her face, at the close he asked:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrankly, what do you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she, answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWill it\xe2\x80\x94do you think it will sell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not,\xe2\x80\x9d was the confession. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too strong for the\r\nmagazines. But it\xe2\x80\x99s true, on my word it\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why do you persist in writing such things when you know they won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsell?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on inexorably. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reason for your writing is to make\r\na living, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right; but the miserable story got away with me. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help writing it. It demanded to be written.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that character, that Wiki-Wiki, why do you make him talk so\r\nroughly? Surely it will offend your readers, and surely that is why the\r\neditors are justified in refusing your work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the real Wiki-Wiki would have talked that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not good taste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is life,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied bluntly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is real. It is true. And I must\r\nwrite life as I see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no answer, and for an awkward moment they sat silent. It was\r\nbecause he loved her that he did not quite understand her, and she\r\ncould not understand him because he was so large that he bulked beyond\r\nher horizon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve collected from the _Transcontinental_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in an\r\neffort to shift the conversation to a more comfortable subject. The\r\npicture of the bewhiskered trio, as he had last seen them, mulcted of\r\nfour dollars and ninety cents and a ferry ticket, made him chuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll come!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was what I came to find\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered absently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to dinner to-morrow. You know you said you\xe2\x80\x99d recover your suit if\r\nyou got that money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot all about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said humbly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, this morning the\r\npoundman got Maria\xe2\x80\x99s two cows and the baby calf, and\xe2\x80\x94well, it happened\r\nthat Maria didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any money, and so I had to recover her cows for\r\nher. That\xe2\x80\x99s where the _Transcontinental_ fiver went\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98The Ring of Bells\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwent into the poundman\xe2\x80\x99s pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you won\xe2\x80\x99t come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked down at his clothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTears of disappointment and reproach glistened in her blue eyes, but\r\nshe said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext Thanksgiving you\xe2\x80\x99ll have dinner with me in Delmonico\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\ncheerily; \xe2\x80\x9cor in London, or Paris, or anywhere you wish. I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw in the paper a few days ago,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthere had been several local appointments to the Railway Mail. You\r\npassed first, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was compelled to admit that the call had come for him, but that he\r\nhad declined it. \xe2\x80\x9cI was so sure\xe2\x80\x94I am so sure\xe2\x80\x94of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA year from now I\xe2\x80\x99ll be earning more than a dozen men in the Railway\r\nMail. You wait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d was all she said, when he finished. She stood up, pulling at her\r\ngloves. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go, Martin. Arthur is waiting for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms and kissed her, but she proved a passive\r\nsweetheart. There was no tenseness in her body, her arms did not go\r\naround him, and her lips met his without their wonted pressure.\r\n\r\nShe was angry with him, he concluded, as he returned from the gate. But\r\nwhy? It was unfortunate that the poundman had gobbled Maria\xe2\x80\x99s cows. But\r\nit was only a stroke of fate. Nobody could be blamed for it. Nor did it\r\nenter his head that he could have done aught otherwise than what he had\r\ndone. Well, yes, he was to blame a little, was his next thought, for\r\nhaving refused the call to the Railway Mail. And she had not liked\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWiki-Wiki.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned at the head of the steps to meet the letter-carrier on his\r\nafternoon round. The ever recurrent fever of expectancy assailed Martin\r\nas he took the bundle of long envelopes. One was not long. It was short\r\nand thin, and outside was printed the address of _The New York\r\nOutview_. He paused in the act of tearing the envelope open. It could\r\nnot be an acceptance. He had no manuscripts with that publication.\r\nPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94his heart almost stood still at the\xe2\x80\x94wild thought\xe2\x80\x94perhaps they\r\nwere ordering an article from him; but the next instant he dismissed\r\nthe surmise as hopelessly impossible.\r\n\r\nIt was a short, formal letter, signed by the office editor, merely\r\ninforming him that an anonymous letter which they had received was\r\nenclosed, and that he could rest assured the _Outview\xe2\x80\x99s_ staff never\r\nunder any circumstances gave consideration to anonymous correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed letter Martin found to be crudely printed by hand. It was\r\na hotchpotch of illiterate abuse of Martin, and of assertion that the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cso-called Martin Eden\xe2\x80\x9d who was selling stories to magazines was no\r\nwriter at all, and that in reality he was stealing stories from old\r\nmagazines, typing them, and sending them out as his own. The envelope\r\nwas postmarked \xe2\x80\x9cSan Leandro.\xe2\x80\x9d Martin did not require a second thought\r\nto discover the author. Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s grammar, Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncolloquialisms, Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s mental quirks and processes, were\r\napparent throughout. Martin saw in every line, not the fine Italian\r\nhand, but the coarse grocer\xe2\x80\x99s fist, of his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nBut why? he vainly questioned. What injury had he done Bernard\r\nHigginbotham? The thing was so unreasonable, so wanton. There was no\r\nexplaining it. In the course of the week a dozen similar letters were\r\nforwarded to Martin by the editors of various Eastern magazines. The\r\neditors were behaving handsomely, Martin concluded. He was wholly\r\nunknown to them, yet some of them had even been sympathetic. It was\r\nevident that they detested anonymity. He saw that the malicious attempt\r\nto hurt him had failed. In fact, if anything came of it, it was bound\r\nto be good, for at least his name had been called to the attention of a\r\nnumber of editors. Sometime, perhaps, reading a submitted manuscript of\r\nhis, they might remember him as the fellow about whom they had received\r\nan anonymous letter. And who was to say that such a remembrance might\r\nnot sway the balance of their judgment just a trifle in his favor?\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Martin took a great slump in Maria\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestimation. He found her in the kitchen one morning groaning with pain,\r\ntears of weakness running down her cheeks, vainly endeavoring to put\r\nthrough a large ironing. He promptly diagnosed her affliction as La\r\nGrippe, dosed her with hot whiskey (the remnants in the bottles for\r\nwhich Brissenden was responsible), and ordered her to bed. But Maria\r\nwas refractory. The ironing had to be done, she protested, and\r\ndelivered that night, or else there would be no food on the morrow for\r\nthe seven small and hungry Silvas.\r\n\r\nTo her astonishment (and it was something that she never ceased from\r\nrelating to her dying day), she saw Martin Eden seize an iron from the\r\nstove and throw a fancy shirt-waist on the ironing-board. It was Kate\r\nFlanagan\xe2\x80\x99s best Sunday waist, than whom there was no more exacting and\r\nfastidiously dressed woman in Maria\xe2\x80\x99s world. Also, Miss Flanagan had\r\nsent special instruction that said waist must be delivered by that\r\nnight. As every one knew, she was keeping company with John Collins,\r\nthe blacksmith, and, as Maria knew privily, Miss Flanagan and Mr.\r\nCollins were going next day to Golden Gate Park. Vain was Maria\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattempt to rescue the garment. Martin guided her tottering footsteps to\r\na chair, from where she watched him with bulging eyes. In a quarter of\r\nthe time it would have taken her she saw the shirt-waist safely ironed,\r\nand ironed as well as she could have done it, as Martin made her grant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could work faster,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cif your irons were only hotter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo her, the irons he swung were much hotter than she ever dared to use.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sprinkling is all wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he complained next. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, let me teach\r\nyou how to sprinkle. Pressure is what\xe2\x80\x99s wanted. Sprinkle under pressure\r\nif you want to iron fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe procured a packing-case from the woodpile in the cellar, fitted a\r\ncover to it, and raided the scrap-iron the Silva tribe was collecting\r\nfor the junkman. With fresh-sprinkled garments in the box, covered with\r\nthe board and pressed by the iron, the device was complete and in\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you watch me, Maria,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stripping off to his undershirt and\r\ngripping an iron that was what he called \xe2\x80\x9creally hot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 when he feenish da iron\xe2\x80\x99 he washa da wools,\xe2\x80\x9d as she described it\r\nafterward. \xe2\x80\x9cHe say, \xe2\x80\x98Maria, you are da greata fool. I showa you how to\r\nwasha da wools,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 he shows me, too. Ten minutes he maka da\r\nmachine\xe2\x80\x94one barrel, one wheel-hub, two poles, justa like dat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin had learned the contrivance from Joe at the Shelly Hot Springs.\r\nThe old wheel-hub, fixed on the end of the upright pole, constituted\r\nthe plunger. Making this, in turn, fast to the spring-pole attached to\r\nthe kitchen rafters, so that the hub played upon the woollens in the\r\nbarrel, he was able, with one hand, thoroughly to pound them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more Maria washa da wools,\xe2\x80\x9d her story always ended. \xe2\x80\x9cI maka da kids\r\nworka da pole an\xe2\x80\x99 da hub an\xe2\x80\x99 da barrel. Him da smarta man, Mister\r\nEden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, by his masterly operation and improvement of her\r\nkitchen-laundry he fell an immense distance in her regard. The glamour\r\nof romance with which her imagination had invested him faded away in\r\nthe cold light of fact that he was an ex-laundryman. All his books, and\r\nhis grand friends who visited him in carriages or with countless\r\nbottles of whiskey, went for naught. He was, after all, a mere\r\nworkingman, a member of her own class and caste. He was more human and\r\napproachable, but, he was no longer mystery.\r\n\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s alienation from his family continued. Following upon Mr.\r\nHigginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s unprovoked attack, Mr. Hermann von Schmidt showed his\r\nhand. The fortunate sale of several storiettes, some humorous verse,\r\nand a few jokes gave Martin a temporary splurge of prosperity. Not only\r\ndid he partially pay up his bills, but he had sufficient balance left\r\nto redeem his black suit and wheel. The latter, by virtue of a twisted\r\ncrank-hanger, required repairing, and, as a matter of friendliness with\r\nhis future brother-in-law, he sent it to Von Schmidt\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon of the same day Martin was pleased by the wheel being\r\ndelivered by a small boy. Von Schmidt was also inclined to be friendly,\r\nwas Martin\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion from this unusual favor. Repaired wheels\r\nusually had to be called for. But when he examined the wheel, he\r\ndiscovered no repairs had been made. A little later in the day he\r\ntelephoned his sister\xe2\x80\x99s betrothed, and learned that that person didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant anything to do with him in \xe2\x80\x9cany shape, manner, or form.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHermann von Schmidt,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a good mind to\r\ncome over and punch that Dutch nose of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come to my shop,\xe2\x80\x9d came the reply, \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll send for the police.\r\nAn\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll put you through, too. Oh, I know you, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t make no\r\nrough-house with me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to do with the likes of you.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a loafer, that\xe2\x80\x99s what, an\xe2\x80\x99 I ain\xe2\x80\x99t asleep. You ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to do\r\nno spongin\xe2\x80\x99 off me just because I\xe2\x80\x99m marryin\xe2\x80\x99 your sister. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ngo to work an\xe2\x80\x99 earn an honest livin\xe2\x80\x99, eh? Answer me that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy asserted itself, dissipating his anger, and he hung\r\nup the receiver with a long whistle of incredulous amusement. But after\r\nthe amusement came the reaction, and he was oppressed by his\r\nloneliness. Nobody understood him, nobody seemed to have any use for\r\nhim, except Brissenden, and Brissenden had disappeared, God alone knew\r\nwhere.\r\n\r\nTwilight was falling as Martin left the fruit store and turned\r\nhomeward, his marketing on his arm. At the corner an electric car had\r\nstopped, and at sight of a lean, familiar figure alighting, his heart\r\nleapt with joy. It was Brissenden, and in the fleeting glimpse, ere the\r\ncar started up, Martin noted the overcoat pockets, one bulging with\r\nbooks, the other bulging with a quart bottle of whiskey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrissenden gave no explanation of his long absence, nor did Martin pry\r\ninto it. He was content to see his friend\xe2\x80\x99s cadaverous face opposite\r\nhim through the steam rising from a tumbler of toddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, too, have not been idle,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden proclaimed, after hearing\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s account of the work he had accomplished.\r\n\r\nHe pulled a manuscript from his inside coat pocket and passed it to\r\nMartin, who looked at the title and glanced up curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty good title, eh?\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ephemera\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94it is the one word. And you\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for it, what of\r\nyour _man_, who is always the erected, the vitalized inorganic, the\r\nlatest of the ephemera, the creature of temperature strutting his\r\nlittle space on the thermometer. It got into my head and I had to write\r\nit to get rid of it. Tell me what you think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s face, flushed at first, paled as he read on. It was perfect\r\nart. Form triumphed over substance, if triumph it could be called where\r\nthe last conceivable atom of substance had found expression in so\r\nperfect construction as to make Martin\xe2\x80\x99s head swim with delight, to put\r\npassionate tears into his eyes, and to send chills creeping up and down\r\nhis back. It was a long poem of six or seven hundred lines, and it was\r\na fantastic, amazing, unearthly thing. It was terrific, impossible; and\r\nyet there it was, scrawled in black ink across the sheets of paper. It\r\ndealt with man and his soul-gropings in their ultimate terms, plumbing\r\nthe abysses of space for the testimony of remotest suns and rainbow\r\nspectrums. It was a mad orgy of imagination, wassailing in the skull of\r\na dying man who half sobbed under his breath and was quick with the\r\nwild flutter of fading heart-beats. The poem swung in majestic rhythm\r\nto the cool tumult of interstellar conflict, to the onset of starry\r\nhosts, to the impact of cold suns and the flaming up of nebulae in the\r\ndarkened void; and through it all, unceasing and faint, like a silver\r\nshuttle, ran the frail, piping voice of man, a querulous chirp amid the\r\nscreaming of planets and the crash of systems.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing like it in literature,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, when at last he\r\nwas able to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful!\xe2\x80\x94wonderful! It has gone to my head.\r\nI am drunken with it. That great, infinitesimal question\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t shake\r\nit out of my thoughts. That questing, eternal, ever recurring, thin\r\nlittle wailing voice of man is still ringing in my ears. It is like the\r\ndead-march of a gnat amid the trumpeting of elephants and the roaring\r\nof lions. It is insatiable with microscopic desire. I now I\xe2\x80\x99m making a\r\nfool of myself, but the thing has obsessed me. You are\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat you are\xe2\x80\x94you are wonderful, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. But how do you do it? How\r\ndo you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin paused from his rhapsody, only to break out afresh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never write again. I am a dauber in clay. You have shown me\r\nthe work of the real artificer-artisan. Genius! This is something more\r\nthan genius. It transcends genius. It is truth gone mad. It is true,\r\nman, every line of it. I wonder if you realize that, you dogmatist.\r\nScience cannot give you the lie. It is the truth of the sneer, stamped\r\nout from the black iron of the Cosmos and interwoven with mighty\r\nrhythms of sound into a fabric of splendor and beauty. And now I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay another word. I am overwhelmed, crushed. Yes, I will, too. Let me\r\nmarket it for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrissenden grinned. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a magazine in Christendom that would\r\ndare to publish it\xe2\x80\x94you know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing of the sort. I know there\xe2\x80\x99s not a magazine in\r\nChristendom that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t jump at it. They don\xe2\x80\x99t get things like that\r\nevery day. That\xe2\x80\x99s no mere poem of the year. It\xe2\x80\x99s the poem of the\r\ncentury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to take you up on the proposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t get cynical,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin exhorted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe magazine editors are not\r\nwholly fatuous. I know that. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll close with you on the bet. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwager anything you want that \xe2\x80\x98Ephemera\xe2\x80\x99 is accepted either on the first\r\nor second offering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s just one thing that prevents me from taking you.\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden\r\nwaited a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is big\xe2\x80\x94the biggest I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done. I know\r\nthat. It\xe2\x80\x99s my swan song. I am almighty proud of it. I worship it. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbetter than whiskey. It is what I dreamed of\xe2\x80\x94the great and perfect\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94when I was a simple young man, with sweet illusions and clean\r\nideals. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it, now, in my last grasp, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll not have it\r\npawed over and soiled by a lot of swine. No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t take the bet. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmine. I made it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve shared it with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut think of the rest of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin protested. \xe2\x80\x9cThe function\r\nof beauty is joy-making.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be selfish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not selfish.\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden grinned soberly in the way he had when\r\npleased by the thing his thin lips were about to shape. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as\r\nunselfish as a famished hog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn vain Martin strove to shake him from his decision. Martin told him\r\nthat his hatred of the magazines was rabid, fanatical, and that his\r\nconduct was a thousand times more despicable than that of the youth who\r\nburned the temple of Diana at Ephesus. Under the storm of denunciation\r\nBrissenden complacently sipped his toddy and affirmed that everything\r\nthe other said was quite true, with the exception of the magazine\r\neditors. His hatred of them knew no bounds, and he excelled Martin in\r\ndenunciation when he turned upon them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d type it for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know how a thousand times\r\nbetter than any stenographer. And now I want to give you some advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe drew a bulky manuscript from his outside coat pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shame of the Sun.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve read it not once, but twice and three\r\ntimes\xe2\x80\x94the highest compliment I can pay you. After what you\xe2\x80\x99ve said\r\nabout \xe2\x80\x98Ephemera\xe2\x80\x99 I must be silent. But this I will say: when \xe2\x80\x98The Shame\r\nof the Sun\xe2\x80\x99 is published, it will make a hit. It will start a\r\ncontroversy that will be worth thousands to you just in advertising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose your next advice will be to submit it to the\r\nmagazines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means no\xe2\x80\x94that is, if you want to see it in print. Offer it to\r\nthe first-class houses. Some publisher\xe2\x80\x99s reader may be mad enough or\r\ndrunk enough to report favorably on it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve read the books. The meat\r\nof them has been transmuted in the alembic of Martin Eden\xe2\x80\x99s mind and\r\npoured into \xe2\x80\x98The Shame of the Sun,\xe2\x80\x99 and one day Martin Eden will be\r\nfamous, and not the least of his fame will rest upon that work. So you\r\nmust get a publisher for it\xe2\x80\x94the sooner the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrissenden went home late that night; and just as he mounted the first\r\nstep of the car, he swung suddenly back on Martin and thrust into his\r\nhand a small, tightly crumpled wad of paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, take this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was out to the races to-day, and I had\r\nthe right dope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bell clanged and the car pulled out, leaving Martin wondering as to\r\nthe nature of the crinkly, greasy wad he clutched in his hand. Back in\r\nhis room he unrolled it and found a hundred-dollar bill.\r\n\r\nHe did not scruple to use it. He knew his friend had always plenty of\r\nmoney, and he knew also, with profound certitude, that his success\r\nwould enable him to repay it. In the morning he paid every bill, gave\r\nMaria three months\xe2\x80\x99 advance on the room, and redeemed every pledge at\r\nthe pawnshop. Next he bought Marian\xe2\x80\x99s wedding present, and simpler\r\npresents, suitable to Christmas, for Ruth and Gertrude. And finally, on\r\nthe balance remaining to him, he herded the whole Silva tribe down into\r\nOakland. He was a winter late in redeeming his promise, but redeemed it\r\nwas, for the last, least Silva got a pair of shoes, as well as Maria\r\nherself. Also, there were horns, and dolls, and toys of various sorts,\r\nand parcels and bundles of candies and nuts that filled the arms of all\r\nthe Silvas to overflowing.\r\n\r\nIt was with this extraordinary procession trooping at his and Maria\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheels into a confectioner\xe2\x80\x99s in quest of the biggest candy-cane ever\r\nmade, that he encountered Ruth and her mother. Mrs. Morse was shocked.\r\nEven Ruth was hurt, for she had some regard for appearances, and her\r\nlover, cheek by jowl with Maria, at the head of that army of Portuguese\r\nragamuffins, was not a pretty sight. But it was not that which hurt so\r\nmuch as what she took to be his lack of pride and self-respect.\r\nFurther, and keenest of all, she read into the incident the\r\nimpossibility of his living down his working-class origin. There was\r\nstigma enough in the fact of it, but shamelessly to flaunt it in the\r\nface of the world\xe2\x80\x94her world\xe2\x80\x94was going too far. Though her engagement to\r\nMartin had been kept secret, their long intimacy had not been\r\nunproductive of gossip; and in the shop, glancing covertly at her lover\r\nand his following, had been several of her acquaintances. She lacked\r\nthe easy largeness of Martin and could not rise superior to her\r\nenvironment. She had been hurt to the quick, and her sensitive nature\r\nwas quivering with the shame of it. So it was, when Martin arrived\r\nlater in the day, that he kept her present in his breast-pocket,\r\ndeferring the giving of it to a more propitious occasion. Ruth in\r\ntears\xe2\x80\x94passionate, angry tears\xe2\x80\x94was a revelation to him. The spectacle of\r\nher suffering convinced him that he had been a brute, yet in the soul\r\nof him he could not see how nor why. It never entered his head to be\r\nashamed of those he knew, and to take the Silvas out to a Christmas\r\ntreat could in no way, so it seemed to him, show lack of consideration\r\nfor Ruth. On the other hand, he did see Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, after she\r\nhad explained it; and he looked upon it as a feminine weakness, such as\r\nafflicted all women and the best of women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the real dirt,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden said to him, one\r\nevening in January.\r\n\r\nThey had dined together in San Francisco, and were at the Ferry\r\nBuilding, returning to Oakland, when the whim came to him to show\r\nMartin the \xe2\x80\x9creal dirt.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned and fled across the water-front, a\r\nmeagre shadow in a flapping overcoat, with Martin straining to keep up\r\nwith him. At a wholesale liquor store he bought two gallon-demijohns of\r\nold port, and with one in each hand boarded a Mission Street car,\r\nMartin at his heels burdened with several quart-bottles of whiskey.\r\n\r\nIf Ruth could see me now, was his thought, while he wondered as to what\r\nconstituted the real dirt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe nobody will be there,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden said, when they dismounted and\r\nplunged off to the right into the heart of the working-class ghetto,\r\nsouth of Market Street. \xe2\x80\x9cIn which case you\xe2\x80\x99ll miss what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nlooking for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what the deuce is that?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen, intelligent men, and not the gibbering nonentities I found you\r\nconsorting with in that trader\xe2\x80\x99s den. You read the books and you found\r\nyourself all alone. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to show you to-night some other men\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99ve read the books, so that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be lonely any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I bother my head about their everlasting discussions,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid at the end of a block. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not interested in book philosophy. But\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find these fellows intelligences and not bourgeois swine. But\r\nwatch out, they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk an arm off of you on any subject under the\r\nsun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHope Norton\xe2\x80\x99s there,\xe2\x80\x9d he panted a little later, resisting Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neffort to relieve him of the two demijohns. \xe2\x80\x9cNorton\xe2\x80\x99s an idealist\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nHarvard man. Prodigious memory. Idealism led him to philosophic\r\nanarchy, and his family threw him off. Father\xe2\x80\x99s a railroad president\r\nand many times millionnaire, but the son\xe2\x80\x99s starving in \xe2\x80\x99Frisco, editing\r\nan anarchist sheet for twenty-five a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin was little acquainted in San Francisco, and not at all south of\r\nMarket; so he had no idea of where he was being led.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9ctell me about them beforehand. What do they do\r\nfor a living? How do they happen to be here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHope Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden paused and rested his hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrawn-Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s his name\xe2\x80\x94hyphenated, you know\xe2\x80\x94comes of old Southern\r\nstock. He\xe2\x80\x99s a tramp\xe2\x80\x94laziest man I ever knew, though he\xe2\x80\x99s clerking, or\r\ntrying to, in a socialist co\xc3\xb6perative store for six dollars a week. But\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a confirmed hobo. Tramped into town. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him sit all day on\r\na bench and never a bite pass his lips, and in the evening, when I\r\ninvited him to dinner\xe2\x80\x94restaurant two blocks away\xe2\x80\x94have him say, \xe2\x80\x98Too\r\nmuch trouble, old man. Buy me a package of cigarettes instead.\xe2\x80\x99 He was\r\na Spencerian like you till Kreis turned him to materialistic monism.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll start him on monism if I can. Norton\xe2\x80\x99s another monist\xe2\x80\x94only he\r\naffirms naught but spirit. He can give Kreis and Hamilton all they\r\nwant, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Kreis?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis rooms we\xe2\x80\x99re going to. One time professor\xe2\x80\x94fired from\r\nuniversity\xe2\x80\x94usual story. A mind like a steel trap. Makes his living any\r\nold way. I know he\xe2\x80\x99s been a street fakir when he was down.\r\nUnscrupulous. Rob a corpse of a shroud\xe2\x80\x94anything. Difference between him\r\nand the bourgeoisie is that he robs without illusion. He\xe2\x80\x99ll talk\r\nNietzsche, or Schopenhauer, or Kant, or anything, but the only thing in\r\nthis world, not excepting Mary, that he really cares for, is his\r\nmonism. Haeckel is his little tin god. The only way to insult him is to\r\ntake a slap at Haeckel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the hang-out.\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden rested his demijohn at the upstairs\r\nentrance, preliminary to the climb. It was the usual two-story corner\r\nbuilding, with a saloon and grocery underneath. \xe2\x80\x9cThe gang lives\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94got the whole upstairs to themselves. But Kreis is the only one\r\nwho has two rooms. Come on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo lights burned in the upper hall, but Brissenden threaded the utter\r\nblackness like a familiar ghost. He stopped to speak to Martin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one fellow\xe2\x80\x94Stevens\xe2\x80\x94a theosophist. Makes a pretty tangle when\r\nhe gets going. Just now he\xe2\x80\x99s dish-washer in a restaurant. Likes a good\r\ncigar. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him eat in a ten-cent hash-house and pay fifty cents\r\nfor the cigar he smoked afterward. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple in my pocket for\r\nhim, if he shows up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s another fellow\xe2\x80\x94Parry\xe2\x80\x94an Australian, a statistician and a\r\nsporting encyclopaedia. Ask him the grain output of Paraguay for 1903,\r\nor the English importation of sheetings into China for 1890, or at what\r\nweight Jimmy Britt fought Battling Nelson, or who was welter-weight\r\nchampion of the United States in \xe2\x80\x9968, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get the correct answer\r\nwith the automatic celerity of a slot-machine. And there\xe2\x80\x99s Andy, a\r\nstone-mason, has ideas on everything, a good chess-player; and another\r\nfellow, Harry, a baker, red hot socialist and strong union man. By the\r\nway, you remember Cooks\xe2\x80\x99 and Waiters\xe2\x80\x99 strike\xe2\x80\x94Hamilton was the chap who\r\norganized that union and precipitated the strike\xe2\x80\x94planned it all out in\r\nadvance, right here in Kreis\xe2\x80\x99s rooms. Did it just for the fun of it,\r\nbut was too lazy to stay by the union. Yet he could have risen high if\r\nhe wanted to. There\xe2\x80\x99s no end to the possibilities in that man\xe2\x80\x94if he\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t so insuperably lazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrissenden advanced through the darkness till a thread of light marked\r\nthe threshold of a door. A knock and an answer opened it, and Martin\r\nfound himself shaking hands with Kreis, a handsome brunette man, with\r\ndazzling white teeth, a drooping black mustache, and large, flashing\r\nblack eyes. Mary, a matronly young blonde, was washing dishes in the\r\nlittle back room that served for kitchen and dining room. The front\r\nroom served as bedchamber and living room. Overhead was the week\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwashing, hanging in festoons so low that Martin did not see at first\r\nthe two men talking in a corner. They hailed Brissenden and his\r\ndemijohns with acclamation, and, on being introduced, Martin learned\r\nthey were Andy and Parry. He joined them and listened attentively to\r\nthe description of a prize-fight Parry had seen the night before; while\r\nBrissenden, in his glory, plunged into the manufacture of a toddy and\r\nthe serving of wine and whiskey-and-sodas. At his command, \xe2\x80\x9cBring in\r\nthe clan,\xe2\x80\x9d Andy departed to go the round of the rooms for the lodgers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re lucky that most of them are here,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden whispered to\r\nMartin. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Norton and Hamilton; come on and meet them. Stevens\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t around, I hear. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get them started on monism if I can.\r\nWait till they get a few jolts in them and they\xe2\x80\x99ll warm up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first the conversation was desultory. Nevertheless Martin could not\r\nfail to appreciate the keen play of their minds. They were men with\r\nopinions, though the opinions often clashed, and, though they were\r\nwitty and clever, they were not superficial. He swiftly saw, no matter\r\nupon what they talked, that each man applied the correlation of\r\nknowledge and had also a deep-seated and unified conception of society\r\nand the Cosmos. Nobody manufactured their opinions for them; they were\r\nall rebels of one variety or another, and their lips were strangers to\r\nplatitudes. Never had Martin, at the Morses\xe2\x80\x99, heard so amazing a range\r\nof topics discussed. There seemed no limit save time to the things they\r\nwere alive to. The talk wandered from Mrs. Humphry Ward\xe2\x80\x99s new book to\r\nShaw\xe2\x80\x99s latest play, through the future of the drama to reminiscences of\r\nMansfield. They appreciated or sneered at the morning editorials,\r\njumped from labor conditions in New Zealand to Henry James and Brander\r\nMatthews, passed on to the German designs in the Far East and the\r\neconomic aspect of the Yellow Peril, wrangled over the German elections\r\nand Bebel\xe2\x80\x99s last speech, and settled down to local politics, the latest\r\nplans and scandals in the union labor party administration, and the\r\nwires that were pulled to bring about the Coast Seamen\xe2\x80\x99s strike. Martin\r\nwas struck by the inside knowledge they possessed. They knew what was\r\nnever printed in the newspapers\xe2\x80\x94the wires and strings and the hidden\r\nhands that made the puppets dance. To Martin\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, the girl,\r\nMary, joined in the conversation, displaying an intelligence he had\r\nnever encountered in the few women he had met. They talked together on\r\nSwinburne and Rossetti, after which she led him beyond his depth into\r\nthe by-paths of French literature. His revenge came when she defended\r\nMaeterlinck and he brought into action the carefully-thought-out thesis\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral other men had dropped in, and the air was thick with tobacco\r\nsmoke, when Brissenden waved the red flag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s fresh meat for your axe, Kreis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9ca rose-white youth\r\nwith the ardor of a lover for Herbert Spencer. Make a Haeckelite of\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKreis seemed to wake up and flash like some metallic, magnetic thing,\r\nwhile Norton looked at Martin sympathetically, with a sweet, girlish\r\nsmile, as much as to say that he would be amply protected.\r\n\r\nKreis began directly on Martin, but step by step Norton interfered,\r\nuntil he and Kreis were off and away in a personal battle. Martin\r\nlistened and fain would have rubbed his eyes. It was impossible that\r\nthis should be, much less in the labor ghetto south of Market. The\r\nbooks were alive in these men. They talked with fire and enthusiasm,\r\nthe intellectual stimulant stirring them as he had seen drink and anger\r\nstir other men. What he heard was no longer the philosophy of the dry,\r\nprinted word, written by half-mythical demigods like Kant and Spencer.\r\nIt was living philosophy, with warm, red blood, incarnated in these two\r\nmen till its very features worked with excitement. Now and again other\r\nmen joined in, and all followed the discussion with cigarettes going\r\nout in their hands and with alert, intent faces.\r\n\r\nIdealism had never attracted Martin, but the exposition it now received\r\nat the hands of Norton was a revelation. The logical plausibility of\r\nit, that made an appeal to his intellect, seemed missed by Kreis and\r\nHamilton, who sneered at Norton as a metaphysician, and who, in turn,\r\nsneered back at them as metaphysicians. _Phenomenon_ and _noumenon_\r\nwere bandied back and forth. They charged him with attempting to\r\nexplain consciousness by itself. He charged them with word-jugglery,\r\nwith reasoning from words to theory instead of from facts to theory. At\r\nthis they were aghast. It was the cardinal tenet of their mode of\r\nreasoning to start with facts and to give names to the facts.\r\n\r\nWhen Norton wandered into the intricacies of Kant, Kreis reminded him\r\nthat all good little German philosophies when they died went to Oxford.\r\nA little later Norton reminded them of Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s Law of Parsimony, the\r\napplication of which they immediately claimed for every reasoning\r\nprocess of theirs. And Martin hugged his knees and exulted in it all.\r\nBut Norton was no Spencerian, and he, too, strove for Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nphilosophic soul, talking as much at him as to his two opponents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know Berkeley has never been answered,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking directly\r\nat Martin. \xe2\x80\x9cHerbert Spencer came the nearest, which was not very near.\r\nEven the stanchest of Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s followers will not go farther. I was\r\nreading an essay of Saleeby\xe2\x80\x99s the other day, and the best Saleeby could\r\nsay was that Herbert Spencer _nearly_ succeeded in answering Berkeley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what Hume said?\xe2\x80\x9d Hamilton asked. Norton nodded, but Hamilton\r\ngave it for the benefit of the rest. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said that Berkeley\xe2\x80\x99s arguments\r\nadmit of no answer and produce no conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn his, Hume\xe2\x80\x99s, mind,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Hume\xe2\x80\x99s mind was the same as\r\nyours, with this difference: he was wise enough to admit there was no\r\nanswering Berkeley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNorton was sensitive and excitable, though he never lost his head,\r\nwhile Kreis and Hamilton were like a pair of cold-blooded savages,\r\nseeking out tender places to prod and poke. As the evening grew late,\r\nNorton, smarting under the repeated charges of being a metaphysician,\r\nclutching his chair to keep from jumping to his feet, his gray eyes\r\nsnapping and his girlish face grown harsh and sure, made a grand attack\r\nupon their position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, you Haeckelites, I may reason like a medicine man, but,\r\npray, how do you reason? You have nothing to stand on, you unscientific\r\ndogmatists with your positive science which you are always lugging\r\nabout into places it has no right to be. Long before the school of\r\nmaterialistic monism arose, the ground was removed so that there could\r\nbe no foundation. Locke was the man, John Locke. Two hundred years\r\nago\xe2\x80\x94more than that, even in his \xe2\x80\x98Essay concerning the Human\r\nUnderstanding,\xe2\x80\x99 he proved the non-existence of innate ideas. The best\r\nof it is that that is precisely what you claim. To-night, again and\r\nagain, you have asserted the non-existence of innate ideas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does that mean? It means that you can never know ultimate\r\nreality. Your brains are empty when you are born. Appearances, or\r\nphenomena, are all the content your minds can receive from your five\r\nsenses. Then noumena, which are not in your minds when you are born,\r\nhave no way of getting in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI deny\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Kreis started to interrupt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wait till I\xe2\x80\x99m done,\xe2\x80\x9d Norton shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can know only that much\r\nof the play and interplay of force and matter as impinges in one way or\r\nanother on our senses. You see, I am willing to admit, for the sake of\r\nthe argument, that matter exists; and what I am about to do is to\r\nefface you by your own argument. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it any other way, for you\r\nare both congenitally unable to understand a philosophic abstraction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, what do you know of matter, according to your own positive\r\nscience? You know it only by its phenomena, its appearances. You are\r\naware only of its changes, or of such changes in it as cause changes in\r\nyour consciousness. Positive science deals only with phenomena, yet you\r\nare foolish enough to strive to be ontologists and to deal with\r\nnoumena. Yet, by the very definition of positive science, science is\r\nconcerned only with appearances. As somebody has said, phenomenal\r\nknowledge cannot transcend phenomena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot answer Berkeley, even if you have annihilated Kant, and\r\nyet, perforce, you assume that Berkeley is wrong when you affirm that\r\nscience proves the non-existence of God, or, as much to the point, the\r\nexistence of matter.\xe2\x80\x94You know I granted the reality of matter only in\r\norder to make myself intelligible to your understanding. Be positive\r\nscientists, if you please; but ontology has no place in positive\r\nscience, so leave it alone. Spencer is right in his agnosticism, but if\r\nSpencer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was time to catch the last ferry-boat for Oakland, and\r\nBrissenden and Martin slipped out, leaving Norton still talking and\r\nKreis and Hamilton waiting to pounce on him like a pair of hounds as\r\nsoon as he finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have given me a glimpse of fairyland,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said on the\r\nferry-boat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes life worth while to meet people like that. My\r\nmind is all worked up. I never appreciated idealism before. Yet I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\naccept it. I know that I shall always be a realist. I am so made, I\r\nguess. But I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have made a reply to Kreis and Hamilton, and I\r\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99d have had a word or two for Norton. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that Spencer\r\nwas damaged any. I\xe2\x80\x99m as excited as a child on its first visit to the\r\ncircus. I see I must read up some more. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get hold of\r\nSaleeby. I still think Spencer is unassailable, and next time I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto take a hand myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Brissenden, breathing painfully, had dropped off to sleep, his chin\r\nburied in a scarf and resting on his sunken chest, his body wrapped in\r\nthe long overcoat and shaking to the vibration of the propellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing Martin did next morning was to go counter both to\r\nBrissenden\xe2\x80\x99s advice and command. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun\xe2\x80\x9d he wrapped and\r\nmailed to _The Acropolis_. He believed he could find magazine\r\npublication for it, and he felt that recognition by the magazines would\r\ncommend him to the book-publishing houses. \xe2\x80\x9cEphemera\xe2\x80\x9d he likewise\r\nwrapped and mailed to a magazine. Despite Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice\r\nagainst the magazines, which was a pronounced mania with him, Martin\r\ndecided that the great poem should see print. He did not intend,\r\nhowever, to publish it without the other\xe2\x80\x99s permission. His plan was to\r\nget it accepted by one of the high magazines, and, thus armed, again to\r\nwrestle with Brissenden for consent.\r\n\r\nMartin began, that morning, a story which he had sketched out a number\r\nof weeks before and which ever since had been worrying him with its\r\ninsistent clamor to be created. Apparently it was to be a rattling sea\r\nstory, a tale of twentieth-century adventure and romance, handling real\r\ncharacters, in a real world, under real conditions. But beneath the\r\nswing and go of the story was to be something else\xe2\x80\x94something that the\r\nsuperficial reader would never discern and which, on the other hand,\r\nwould not diminish in any way the interest and enjoyment for such a\r\nreader. It was this, and not the mere story, that impelled Martin to\r\nwrite it. For that matter, it was always the great, universal motif\r\nthat suggested plots to him. After having found such a motif, he cast\r\nabout for the particular persons and particular location in time and\r\nspace wherewith and wherein to utter the universal thing. \xe2\x80\x9cOverdue\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nthe title he had decided for it, and its length he believed would not\r\nbe more than sixty thousand words\xe2\x80\x94a bagatelle for him with his splendid\r\nvigor of production. On this first day he took hold of it with\r\nconscious delight in the mastery of his tools. He no longer worried for\r\nfear that the sharp, cutting edges should slip and mar his work. The\r\nlong months of intense application and study had brought their reward.\r\nHe could now devote himself with sure hand to the larger phases of the\r\nthing he shaped; and as he worked, hour after hour, he felt, as never\r\nbefore, the sure and cosmic grasp with which he held life and the\r\naffairs of life. \xe2\x80\x9cOverdue\xe2\x80\x9d would tell a story that would be true of its\r\nparticular characters and its particular events; but it would tell,\r\ntoo, he was confident, great vital things that would be true of all\r\ntime, and all sea, and all life\xe2\x80\x94thanks to Herbert Spencer, he thought,\r\nleaning back for a moment from the table. Ay, thanks to Herbert Spencer\r\nand to the master-key of life, evolution, which Spencer had placed in\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nHe was conscious that it was great stuff he was writing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will go!\r\nIt will go!\xe2\x80\x9d was the refrain that kept sounding in his ears. Of course\r\nit would go. At last he was turning out the thing at which the\r\nmagazines would jump. The whole story worked out before him in\r\nlightning flashes. He broke off from it long enough to write a\r\nparagraph in his note-book. This would be the last paragraph in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOverdue\xe2\x80\x9d; but so thoroughly was the whole book already composed in his\r\nbrain that he could write, weeks before he had arrived at the end, the\r\nend itself. He compared the tale, as yet unwritten, with the tales of\r\nthe sea-writers, and he felt it to be immeasurably superior. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly one man who could touch it,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nConrad. And it ought to make even him sit up and shake hands with me,\r\nand say, \xe2\x80\x98Well done, Martin, my boy.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe toiled on all day, recollecting, at the last moment, that he was to\r\nhave dinner at the Morses\xe2\x80\x99. Thanks to Brissenden, his black suit was\r\nout of pawn and he was again eligible for dinner parties. Down town he\r\nstopped off long enough to run into the library and search for\r\nSaleeby\xe2\x80\x99s books. He drew out \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cycle of Life,\xe2\x80\x9d and on the car turned\r\nto the essay Norton had mentioned on Spencer. As Martin read, he grew\r\nangry. His face flushed, his jaw set, and unconsciously his hand\r\nclenched, unclenched, and clenched again as if he were taking fresh\r\ngrips upon some hateful thing out of which he was squeezing the life.\r\nWhen he left the car, he strode along the sidewalk as a wrathful man\r\nwill stride, and he rang the Morse bell with such viciousness that it\r\nroused him to consciousness of his condition, so that he entered in\r\ngood nature, smiling with amusement at himself. No sooner, however, was\r\nhe inside than a great depression descended upon him. He fell from the\r\nheight where he had been up-borne all day on the wings of inspiration.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBourgeois,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctrader\xe2\x80\x99s den\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s epithets repeated themselves\r\nin his mind. But what of that? he demanded angrily. He was marrying\r\nRuth, not her family.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that he had never seen Ruth more beautiful, more\r\nspiritual and ethereal and at the same time more healthy. There was\r\ncolor in her cheeks, and her eyes drew him again and again\xe2\x80\x94the eyes in\r\nwhich he had first read immortality. He had forgotten immortality of\r\nlate, and the trend of his scientific reading had been away from it;\r\nbut here, in Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, he read an argument without words that\r\ntranscended all worded arguments. He saw that in her eyes before which\r\nall discussion fled away, for he saw love there. And in his own eyes\r\nwas love; and love was unanswerable. Such was his passionate doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe half hour he had with her, before they went in to dinner, left him\r\nsupremely happy and supremely satisfied with life. Nevertheless, at\r\ntable, the inevitable reaction and exhaustion consequent upon the hard\r\nday seized hold of him. He was aware that his eyes were tired and that\r\nhe was irritable. He remembered it was at this table, at which he now\r\nsneered and was so often bored, that he had first eaten with civilized\r\nbeings in what he had imagined was an atmosphere of high culture and\r\nrefinement. He caught a glimpse of that pathetic figure of him, so long\r\nago, a self-conscious savage, sprouting sweat at every pore in an agony\r\nof apprehension, puzzled by the bewildering minutiae of\r\neating-implements, tortured by the ogre of a servant, striving at a\r\nleap to live at such dizzy social altitude, and deciding in the end to\r\nbe frankly himself, pretending no knowledge and no polish he did not\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Ruth for reassurance, much in the same manner that a\r\npassenger, with sudden panic thought of possible shipwreck, will strive\r\nto locate the life preservers. Well, that much had come out of it\xe2\x80\x94love\r\nand Ruth. All the rest had failed to stand the test of the books. But\r\nRuth and love had stood the test; for them he found a biological\r\nsanction. Love was the most exalted expression of life. Nature had been\r\nbusy designing him, as she had been busy with all normal men, for the\r\npurpose of loving. She had spent ten thousand centuries\xe2\x80\x94ay, a hundred\r\nthousand and a million centuries\xe2\x80\x94upon the task, and he was the best she\r\ncould do. She had made love the strongest thing in him, increased its\r\npower a myriad per cent with her gift of imagination, and sent him\r\nforth into the ephemera to thrill and melt and mate. His hand sought\r\nRuth\xe2\x80\x99s hand beside him hidden by the table, and a warm pressure was\r\ngiven and received. She looked at him a swift instant, and her eyes\r\nwere radiant and melting. So were his in the thrill that pervaded him;\r\nnor did he realize how much that was radiant and melting in her eyes\r\nhad been aroused by what she had seen in his.\r\n\r\nAcross the table from him, cater-cornered, at Mr. Morse\xe2\x80\x99s right, sat\r\nJudge Blount, a local superior court judge. Martin had met him a number\r\nof times and had failed to like him. He and Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s father were\r\ndiscussing labor union politics, the local situation, and socialism,\r\nand Mr. Morse was endeavoring to twit Martin on the latter topic. At\r\nlast Judge Blount looked across the table with benignant and fatherly\r\npity. Martin smiled to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll grow out of it, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cTime is the\r\nbest cure for such youthful distempers.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to Mr. Morse. \xe2\x80\x9cI do\r\nnot believe discussion is good in such cases. It makes the patient\r\nobstinate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d the other assented gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is well to warn the\r\npatient occasionally of his condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin laughed merrily, but it was with an effort. The day had been too\r\nlong, the day\xe2\x80\x99s effort too intense, and he was deep in the throes of\r\nthe reaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly you are both excellent doctors,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you care\r\na whit for the opinion of the patient, let him tell you that you are\r\npoor diagnosticians. In fact, you are both suffering from the disease\r\nyou think you find in me. As for me, I am immune. The socialist\r\nphilosophy that riots half-baked in your veins has passed me by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClever, clever,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the judge. \xe2\x80\x9cAn excellent ruse in\r\ncontroversy, to reverse positions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of your mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d Martin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were sparkling, but he kept control\r\nof himself. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Judge, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard your campaign speeches. By some\r\nhenidical process\xe2\x80\x94henidical, by the way is a favorite word of mine\r\nwhich nobody understands\xe2\x80\x94by some henidical process you persuade\r\nyourself that you believe in the competitive system and the survival of\r\nthe strong, and at the same time you indorse with might and main all\r\nsorts of measures to shear the strength from the strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy young man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard your campaign speeches,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin warned. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s on\r\nrecord, your position on interstate commerce regulation, on regulation\r\nof the railway trust and Standard Oil, on the conservation of the\r\nforests, on a thousand and one restrictive measures that are nothing\r\nelse than socialistic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to tell me that you do not believe in regulating these\r\nvarious outrageous exercises of power?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the point. I mean to tell you that you are a poor\r\ndiagnostician. I mean to tell you that I am not suffering from the\r\nmicrobe of socialism. I mean to tell you that it is you who are\r\nsuffering from the emasculating ravages of that same microbe. As for\r\nme, I am an inveterate opponent of socialism just as I am an inveterate\r\nopponent of your own mongrel democracy that is nothing else than\r\npseudo-socialism masquerading under a garb of words that will not stand\r\nthe test of the dictionary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a reactionary\xe2\x80\x94so complete a reactionary that my position is\r\nincomprehensible to you who live in a veiled lie of social organization\r\nand whose sight is not keen enough to pierce the veil. You make believe\r\nthat you believe in the survival of the strong and the rule of the\r\nstrong. I believe. That is the difference. When I was a trifle\r\nyounger,\xe2\x80\x94a few months younger,\xe2\x80\x94I believed the same thing. You see, the\r\nideas of you and yours had impressed me. But merchants and traders are\r\ncowardly rulers at best; they grunt and grub all their days in the\r\ntrough of money-getting, and I have swung back to aristocracy, if you\r\nplease. I am the only individualist in this room. I look to the state\r\nfor nothing. I look only to the strong man, the man on horseback, to\r\nsave the state from its own rotten futility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNietzsche was right. I won\xe2\x80\x99t take the time to tell you who Nietzsche\r\nwas, but he was right. The world belongs to the strong\xe2\x80\x94to the strong\r\nwho are noble as well and who do not wallow in the swine-trough of\r\ntrade and exchange. The world belongs to the true nobleman, to the\r\ngreat blond beasts, to the noncompromisers, to the \xe2\x80\x98yes-sayers.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nthey will eat you up, you socialists\xe2\x80\x94who are afraid of socialism and\r\nwho think yourselves individualists. Your slave-morality of the meek\r\nand lowly will never save you.\xe2\x80\x94Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all Greek, I know, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbother you any more with it. But remember one thing. There aren\xe2\x80\x99t half\r\na dozen individualists in Oakland, but Martin Eden is one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe signified that he was done with the discussion, and turned to Ruth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m wrought up to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in an undertone. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I want to do is\r\nto love, not talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ignored Mr. Morse, who said:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am unconvinced. All socialists are Jesuits. That is the way to tell\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll make a good Republican out of you yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Judge Blount.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man on horseback will arrive before that time,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin retorted\r\nwith good humor, and returned to Ruth.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Morse was not content. He did not like the laziness and the\r\ndisinclination for sober, legitimate work of this prospective\r\nson-in-law of his, for whose ideas he had no respect and of whose\r\nnature he had no understanding. So he turned the conversation to\r\nHerbert Spencer. Judge Blount ably seconded him, and Martin, whose ears\r\nhad pricked at the first mention of the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s name, listened to\r\nthe judge enunciate a grave and complacent diatribe against Spencer.\r\nFrom time to time Mr. Morse glanced at Martin, as much as to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, my boy, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChattering daws,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin muttered under his breath, and went on\r\ntalking with Ruth and Arthur.\r\n\r\nBut the long day and the \xe2\x80\x9creal dirt\xe2\x80\x9d of the night before were telling\r\nupon him; and, besides, still in his burnt mind was what had made him\r\nangry when he read it on the car.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth asked suddenly alarmed by the effort he was\r\nmaking to contain himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is its\r\nprophet,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Blount was saying at that moment.\r\n\r\nMartin turned upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cheap judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard it first in the City\r\nHall Park, on the lips of a workingman who ought to have known better.\r\nI have heard it often since, and each time the clap-trap of it\r\nnauseates me. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. To hear that great\r\nand noble man\xe2\x80\x99s name upon your lips is like finding a dew-drop in a\r\ncesspool. You are disgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was like a thunderbolt. Judge Blount glared at him with apoplectic\r\ncountenance, and silence reigned. Mr. Morse was secretly pleased. He\r\ncould see that his daughter was shocked. It was what he wanted to do\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nbring out the innate ruffianism of this man he did not like.\r\n\r\nRuth\xe2\x80\x99s hand sought Martin\xe2\x80\x99s beseechingly under the table, but his blood\r\nwas up. He was inflamed by the intellectual pretence and fraud of those\r\nwho sat in the high places. A Superior Court Judge! It was only several\r\nyears before that he had looked up from the mire at such glorious\r\nentities and deemed them gods.\r\n\r\nJudge Blount recovered himself and attempted to go on, addressing\r\nhimself to Martin with an assumption of politeness that the latter\r\nunderstood was for the benefit of the ladies. Even this added to his\r\nanger. Was there no honesty in the world?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss Spencer with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know any\r\nmore about Spencer than do his own countrymen. But it is no fault of\r\nyours, I grant. It is just a phase of the contemptible ignorance of the\r\ntimes. I ran across a sample of it on my way here this evening. I was\r\nreading an essay by Saleeby on Spencer. You should read it. It is\r\naccessible to all men. You can buy it in any book-store or draw it from\r\nthe public library. You would feel ashamed of your paucity of abuse and\r\nignorance of that noble man compared with what Saleeby has collected on\r\nthe subject. It is a record of shame that would shame your shame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The philosopher of the half-educated,\xe2\x80\x99 he was called by an academic\r\nPhilosopher who was not worthy to pollute the atmosphere he breathed. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think you have read ten pages of Spencer, but there have been\r\ncritics, assumably more intelligent than you, who have read no more\r\nthan you of Spencer, who publicly challenged his followers to adduce\r\none single idea from all his writings\xe2\x80\x94from Herbert Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s writings,\r\nthe man who has impressed the stamp of his genius over the whole field\r\nof scientific research and modern thought; the father of psychology;\r\nthe man who revolutionized pedagogy, so that to-day the child of the\r\nFrench peasant is taught the three R\xe2\x80\x99s according to principles laid\r\ndown by him. And the little gnats of men sting his memory when they get\r\ntheir very bread and butter from the technical application of his\r\nideas. What little of worth resides in their brains is largely due to\r\nhim. It is certain that had he never lived, most of what is correct in\r\ntheir parrot-learned knowledge would be absent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet a man like Principal Fairbanks of Oxford\xe2\x80\x94a man who sits in an\r\neven higher place than you, Judge Blount\xe2\x80\x94has said that Spencer will be\r\ndismissed by posterity as a poet and dreamer rather than a thinker.\r\nYappers and blatherskites, the whole brood of them! \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cFirst Principles\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nis not wholly destitute of a certain literary power,\xe2\x80\x99 said one of them.\r\nAnd others of them have said that he was an industrious plodder rather\r\nthan an original thinker. Yappers and blatherskites! Yappers and\r\nblatherskites!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin ceased abruptly, in a dead silence. Everybody in Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\nlooked up to Judge Blount as a man of power and achievement, and they\r\nwere horrified at Martin\xe2\x80\x99s outbreak. The remainder of the dinner passed\r\nlike a funeral, the judge and Mr. Morse confining their talk to each\r\nother, and the rest of the conversation being extremely desultory. Then\r\nafterward, when Ruth and Martin were alone, there was a scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are unbearable,\xe2\x80\x9d she wept.\r\n\r\nBut his anger still smouldered, and he kept muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cThe beasts! The\r\nbeasts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she averred he had insulted the judge, he retorted:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy telling the truth about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether it was true or not,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are\r\ncertain bounds of decency, and you had no license to insult anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where did Judge Blount get the license to assault truth?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin\r\ndemanded. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely to assault truth is a more serious misdemeanor than\r\nto insult a pygmy personality such as the judge\xe2\x80\x99s. He did worse than\r\nthat. He blackened the name of a great, noble man who is dead. Oh, the\r\nbeasts! The beasts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis complex anger flamed afresh, and Ruth was in terror of him. Never\r\nhad she seen him so angry, and it was all mystified and unreasonable to\r\nher comprehension. And yet, through her very terror ran the fibres of\r\nfascination that had drawn and that still drew her to him\xe2\x80\x94that had\r\ncompelled her to lean towards him, and, in that mad, culminating\r\nmoment, lay her hands upon his neck. She was hurt and outraged by what\r\nhad taken place, and yet she lay in his arms and quivered while he went\r\non muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cThe beasts! The beasts!\xe2\x80\x9d And she still lay there when he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not bother your table again, dear. They do not like me, and\r\nit is wrong of me to thrust my objectionable presence upon them.\r\nBesides, they are just as objectionable to me. Faugh! They are\r\nsickening. And to think of it, I dreamed in my innocence that the\r\npersons who sat in the high places, who lived in fine houses and had\r\neducations and bank accounts, were worth while!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, let\xe2\x80\x99s go down to the local.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke Brissenden, faint from a hemorrhage of half an hour before\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsecond hemorrhage in three days. The perennial whiskey glass was in his\r\nhands, and he drained it with shaking fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I want with socialism?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOutsiders are allowed five-minute speeches,\xe2\x80\x9d the sick man urged. \xe2\x80\x9cGet\r\nup and spout. Tell them why you don\xe2\x80\x99t want socialism. Tell them what\r\nyou think about them and their ghetto ethics. Slam Nietzsche into them\r\nand get walloped for your pains. Make a scrap of it. It will do them\r\ngood. Discussion is what they want, and what you want, too. You see,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see you a socialist before I\xe2\x80\x99m gone. It will give you a\r\nsanction for your existence. It is the one thing that will save you in\r\nthe time of disappointment that is coming to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never can puzzle out why you, of all men, are a socialist,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin\r\npondered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou detest the crowd so. Surely there is nothing in the\r\ncanaille to recommend it to your aesthetic soul.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed an\r\naccusing finger at the whiskey glass which the other was refilling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSocialism doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to save you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sick,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWith you it is different. You have\r\nhealth and much to live for, and you must be handcuffed to life\r\nsomehow. As for me, you wonder why I am a socialist. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. It\r\nis because Socialism is inevitable; because the present rotten and\r\nirrational system cannot endure; because the day is past for your man\r\non horseback. The slaves won\xe2\x80\x99t stand for it. They are too many, and\r\nwilly-nilly they\xe2\x80\x99ll drag down the would-be equestrian before ever he\r\ngets astride. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get away from them, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to swallow\r\nthe whole slave-morality. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a nice mess, I\xe2\x80\x99ll allow. But it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen a-brewing and swallow it you must. You are antediluvian anyway,\r\nwith your Nietzsche ideas. The past is past, and the man who says\r\nhistory repeats itself is a liar. Of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the crowd, but\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s a poor chap to do? We can\xe2\x80\x99t have the man on horseback, and\r\nanything is preferable to the timid swine that now rule. But come on,\r\nanyway. I\xe2\x80\x99m loaded to the guards now, and if I sit here any longer,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll get drunk. And you know the doctor says\xe2\x80\x94damn the doctor! I\xe2\x80\x99ll fool\r\nhim yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday night, and they found the small hall packed by the\r\nOakland socialists, chiefly members of the working class. The speaker,\r\na clever Jew, won Martin\xe2\x80\x99s admiration at the same time that he aroused\r\nhis antagonism. The man\xe2\x80\x99s stooped and narrow shoulders and weazened\r\nchest proclaimed him the true child of the crowded ghetto, and strong\r\non Martin was the age-long struggle of the feeble, wretched slaves\r\nagainst the lordly handful of men who had ruled over them and would\r\nrule over them to the end of time. To Martin this withered wisp of a\r\ncreature was a symbol. He was the figure that stood forth\r\nrepresentative of the whole miserable mass of weaklings and\r\ninefficients who perished according to biological law on the ragged\r\nconfines of life. They were the unfit. In spite of their cunning\r\nphilosophy and of their antlike proclivities for co\xc3\xb6peration, Nature\r\nrejected them for the exceptional man. Out of the plentiful spawn of\r\nlife she flung from her prolific hand she selected only the best. It\r\nwas by the same method that men, aping her, bred race-horses and\r\ncucumbers. Doubtless, a creator of a Cosmos could have devised a better\r\nmethod; but creatures of this particular Cosmos must put up with this\r\nparticular method. Of course, they could squirm as they perished, as\r\nthe socialists squirmed, as the speaker on the platform and the\r\nperspiring crowd were squirming even now as they counselled together\r\nfor some new device with which to minimize the penalties of living and\r\noutwit the Cosmos.\r\n\r\nSo Martin thought, and so he spoke when Brissenden urged him to give\r\nthem hell. He obeyed the mandate, walking up to the platform, as was\r\nthe custom, and addressing the chairman. He began in a low voice,\r\nhaltingly, forming into order the ideas which had surged in his brain\r\nwhile the Jew was speaking. In such meetings five minutes was the time\r\nallotted to each speaker; but when Martin\xe2\x80\x99s five minutes were up, he\r\nwas in full stride, his attack upon their doctrines but half completed.\r\nHe had caught their interest, and the audience urged the chairman by\r\nacclamation to extend Martin\xe2\x80\x99s time. They appreciated him as a foeman\r\nworthy of their intellect, and they listened intently, following every\r\nword. He spoke with fire and conviction, mincing no words in his attack\r\nupon the slaves and their morality and tactics and frankly alluding to\r\nhis hearers as the slaves in question. He quoted Spencer and Malthus,\r\nand enunciated the biological law of development.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, in a swift r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9, \xe2\x80\x9cno state composed of the\r\nslave-types can endure. The old law of development still holds. In the\r\nstruggle for existence, as I have shown, the strong and the progeny of\r\nthe strong tend to survive, while the weak and the progeny of the weak\r\nare crushed and tend to perish. The result is that the strong and the\r\nprogeny of the strong survive, and, so long as the struggle obtains,\r\nthe strength of each generation increases. That is development. But you\r\nslaves\xe2\x80\x94it is too bad to be slaves, I grant\xe2\x80\x94but you slaves dream of a\r\nsociety where the law of development will be annulled, where no\r\nweaklings and inefficients will perish, where every inefficient will\r\nhave as much as he wants to eat as many times a day as he desires, and\r\nwhere all will marry and have progeny\xe2\x80\x94the weak as well as the strong.\r\nWhat will be the result? No longer will the strength and life-value of\r\neach generation increase. On the contrary, it will diminish. There is\r\nthe Nemesis of your slave philosophy. Your society of slaves\xe2\x80\x94of, by,\r\nand for, slaves\xe2\x80\x94must inevitably weaken and go to pieces as the life\r\nwhich composes it weakens and goes to pieces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, I am enunciating biology and not sentimental ethics. No\r\nstate of slaves can stand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about the United States?\xe2\x80\x9d a man yelled from the audience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how about it?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thirteen colonies threw off\r\ntheir rulers and formed the Republic so-called. The slaves were their\r\nown masters. There were no more masters of the sword. But you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget along without masters of some sort, and there arose a new set of\r\nmasters\xe2\x80\x94not the great, virile, noble men, but the shrewd and spidery\r\ntraders and money-lenders. And they enslaved you over again\xe2\x80\x94but not\r\nfrankly, as the true, noble men would do with weight of their own right\r\narms, but secretly, by spidery machinations and by wheedling and\r\ncajolery and lies. They have purchased your slave judges, they have\r\ndebauched your slave legislatures, and they have forced to worse\r\nhorrors than chattel slavery your slave boys and girls. Two million of\r\nyour children are toiling to-day in this trader-oligarchy of the United\r\nStates. Ten millions of you slaves are not properly sheltered nor\r\nproperly fed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to return. I have shown that no society of slaves can endure,\r\nbecause, in its very nature, such society must annul the law of\r\ndevelopment. No sooner can a slave society be organized than\r\ndeterioration sets in. It is easy for you to talk of annulling the law\r\nof development, but where is the new law of development that will\r\nmaintain your strength? Formulate it. Is it already formulated? Then\r\nstate it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin took his seat amidst an uproar of voices. A score of men were on\r\ntheir feet clamoring for recognition from the chair. And one by one,\r\nencouraged by vociferous applause, speaking with fire and enthusiasm\r\nand excited gestures, they replied to the attack. It was a wild\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94but it was wild intellectually, a battle of ideas. Some strayed\r\nfrom the point, but most of the speakers replied directly to Martin.\r\nThey shook him with lines of thought that were new to him; and gave him\r\ninsights, not into new biological laws, but into new applications of\r\nthe old laws. They were too earnest to be always polite, and more than\r\nonce the chairman rapped and pounded for order.\r\n\r\nIt chanced that a cub reporter sat in the audience, detailed there on a\r\nday dull of news and impressed by the urgent need of journalism for\r\nsensation. He was not a bright cub reporter. He was merely facile and\r\nglib. He was too dense to follow the discussion. In fact, he had a\r\ncomfortable feeling that he was vastly superior to these wordy maniacs\r\nof the working class. Also, he had a great respect for those who sat in\r\nthe high places and dictated the policies of nations and newspapers.\r\nFurther, he had an ideal, namely, of achieving that excellence of the\r\nperfect reporter who is able to make something\xe2\x80\x94even a great deal\xe2\x80\x94out of\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nHe did not know what all the talk was about. It was not necessary.\r\nWords like _revolution_ gave him his cue. Like a paleontologist, able\r\nto reconstruct an entire skeleton from one fossil bone, he was able to\r\nreconstruct a whole speech from the one word _revolution_. He did it\r\nthat night, and he did it well; and since Martin had made the biggest\r\nstir, he put it all into his mouth and made him the arch-anarch of the\r\nshow, transforming his reactionary individualism into the most lurid,\r\nred-shirt socialist utterance. The cub reporter was an artist, and it\r\nwas a large brush with which he laid on the local color\xe2\x80\x94wild-eyed\r\nlong-haired men, neurasthenic and degenerate types of men, voices\r\nshaken with passion, clenched fists raised on high, and all projected\r\nagainst a background of oaths, yells, and the throaty rumbling of angry\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the coffee, in his little room, Martin read next morning\xe2\x80\x99s paper.\r\nIt was a novel experience to find himself head-lined, on the first page\r\nat that; and he was surprised to learn that he was the most notorious\r\nleader of the Oakland socialists. He ran over the violent speech the\r\ncub reporter had constructed for him, and, though at first he was\r\nangered by the fabrication, in the end he tossed the paper aside with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither the man was drunk or criminally malicious,\xe2\x80\x9d he said that\r\nafternoon, from his perch on the bed, when Brissenden had arrived and\r\ndropped limply into the one chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you care?\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden asked. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely you don\xe2\x80\x99t desire the\r\napproval of the bourgeois swine that read the newspapers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin thought for a while, then said:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t care for their approval, not a whit. On the other\r\nhand, it\xe2\x80\x99s very likely to make my relations with Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s family a trifle\r\nawkward. Her father always contended I was a socialist, and this\r\nmiserable stuff will clinch his belief. Not that I care for his\r\nopinion\xe2\x80\x94but what\xe2\x80\x99s the odds? I want to read you what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing\r\nto-day. It\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Overdue,\xe2\x80\x99 of course, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just about halfway through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was reading aloud when Maria thrust open the door and ushered in a\r\nyoung man in a natty suit who glanced briskly about him, noting the\r\noil-burner and the kitchen in the corner before his gaze wandered on to\r\nMartin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden said.\r\n\r\nMartin made room for the young man on the bed and waited for him to\r\nbroach his business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you speak last night, Mr. Eden, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to interview\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\nBrissenden burst out in a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA brother socialist?\xe2\x80\x9d the reporter asked, with a quick glance at\r\nBrissenden that appraised the color-value of that cadaverous and dying\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he wrote that report,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he is only a\r\nboy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you poke him?\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give a thousand\r\ndollars to have my lungs back for five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cub reporter was a trifle perplexed by this talking over him and\r\naround him and at him. But he had been commended for his brilliant\r\ndescription of the socialist meeting and had further been detailed to\r\nget a personal interview with Martin Eden, the leader of the organized\r\nmenace to society.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not object to having your picture taken, Mr. Eden?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a staff photographer outside, you see, and he says it will be\r\nbetter to take you right away before the sun gets lower. Then we can\r\nhave the interview afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA photographer,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden said meditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cPoke him, Martin! Poke\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess I\xe2\x80\x99m getting old,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I ought, but I\r\nreally haven\xe2\x80\x99t the heart. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor his mother\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden urged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worth considering,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem worth\r\nwhile enough to rouse sufficient energy in me. You see, it does take\r\nenergy to give a fellow a poking. Besides, what does it matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the way to take it,\xe2\x80\x9d the cub announced airily,\r\nthough he had already begun to glance anxiously at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true, not a word of what he wrote,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin went on,\r\nconfining his attention to Brissenden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just in a general way a description, you understand,\xe2\x80\x9d the cub\r\nventured, \xe2\x80\x9cand besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s good advertising. That\xe2\x80\x99s what counts. It\r\nwas a favor to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good advertising, Martin, old boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden repeated solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it was a favor to me\xe2\x80\x94think of that!\xe2\x80\x9d was Martin\xe2\x80\x99s contribution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see\xe2\x80\x94where were you born, Mr. Eden?\xe2\x80\x9d the cub asked, assuming an\r\nair of expectant attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take notes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brissenden. \xe2\x80\x9cHe remembers it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is sufficient for me.\xe2\x80\x9d The cub was trying not to look worried.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo decent reporter needs to bother with notes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was sufficient\xe2\x80\x94for last night.\xe2\x80\x9d But Brissenden was not a disciple\r\nof quietism, and he changed his attitude abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cMartin, if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t poke him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it myself, if I fall dead on the floor the next\r\nmoment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will a spanking do?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin asked.\r\n\r\nBrissenden considered judicially, and nodded his head.\r\n\r\nThe next instant Martin was seated on the edge of the bed with the cub\r\nface downward across his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t bite,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin warned, \xe2\x80\x9cor else I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to punch your face.\r\nIt would be a pity, for it is such a pretty face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis uplifted hand descended, and thereafter rose and fell in a swift\r\nand steady rhythm. The cub struggled and cursed and squirmed, but did\r\nnot offer to bite. Brissenden looked on gravely, though once he grew\r\nexcited and gripped the whiskey bottle, pleading, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, just let me\r\nswat him once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry my hand played out,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, when at last he desisted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis quite numb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe uprighted the cub and perched him on the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have you arrested for this,\xe2\x80\x9d he snarled, tears of boyish\r\nindignation running down his flushed cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make you sweat for\r\nthis. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pretty thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t realize that he has\r\nentered upon the downward path. It is not honest, it is not square, it\r\nis not manly, to tell lies about one\xe2\x80\x99s fellow-creatures the way he has\r\ndone, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has to come to us to be told,\xe2\x80\x9d Brissenden filled in a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to me whom he has maligned and injured. My grocery will\r\nundoubtedly refuse me credit now. The worst of it is that the poor boy\r\nwill keep on this way until he deteriorates into a first-class\r\nnewspaper man and also a first-class scoundrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is yet time,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Brissenden. \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows but what you may\r\nprove the humble instrument to save him. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you let me swat him\r\njust once? I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have had a hand in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have you arrested, the pair of you, you b-b-big brutes,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed\r\nthe erring soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, his mouth is too pretty and too weak.\xe2\x80\x9d Martin shook his head\r\nlugubriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve numbed my hand in vain. The young man\r\ncannot reform. He will become eventually a very great and successful\r\nnewspaper man. He has no conscience. That alone will make him great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that the cub passed out the door in trepidation to the last for\r\nfear that Brissenden would hit him in the back with the bottle he still\r\nclutched.\r\n\r\nIn the next morning\xe2\x80\x99s paper Martin learned a great deal more about\r\nhimself that was new to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are the sworn enemies of society,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nfound himself quoted as saying in a column interview. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, we are not\r\nanarchists but socialists.\xe2\x80\x9d When the reporter pointed out to him that\r\nthere seemed little difference between the two schools, Martin had\r\nshrugged his shoulders in silent affirmation. His face was described as\r\nbilaterally asymmetrical, and various other signs of degeneration were\r\ndescribed. Especially notable were his thuglike hands and the fiery\r\ngleams in his blood-shot eyes.\r\n\r\nHe learned, also, that he spoke nightly to the workmen in the City Hall\r\nPark, and that among the anarchists and agitators that there inflamed\r\nthe minds of the people he drew the largest audiences and made the most\r\nrevolutionary speeches. The cub painted a high-light picture of his\r\npoor little room, its oil-stove and the one chair, and of the\r\ndeath\xe2\x80\x99s-head tramp who kept him company and who looked as if he had\r\njust emerged from twenty years of solitary confinement in some fortress\r\ndungeon.\r\n\r\nThe cub had been industrious. He had scurried around and nosed out\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s family history, and procured a photograph of Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCash Store with Bernard Higginbotham himself standing out in front.\r\nThat gentleman was depicted as an intelligent, dignified businessman\r\nwho had no patience with his brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s socialistic views, and no\r\npatience with the brother-in-law, either, whom he was quoted as\r\ncharacterizing as a lazy good-for-nothing who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take a job when\r\nit was offered to him and who would go to jail yet. Hermann von\r\nSchmidt, Marian\xe2\x80\x99s husband, had likewise been interviewed. He had called\r\nMartin the black sheep of the family and repudiated him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe tried to\r\nsponge off of me, but I put a stop to that good and quick,\xe2\x80\x9d Von Schmidt\r\nhad said to the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows better than to come bumming around\r\nhere. A man who won\xe2\x80\x99t work is no good, take that from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Martin was genuinely angry. Brissenden looked upon the affair\r\nas a good joke, but he could not console Martin, who knew that it would\r\nbe no easy task to explain to Ruth. As for her father, he knew that he\r\nmust be overjoyed with what had happened and that he would make the\r\nmost of it to break off the engagement. How much he would make of it he\r\nwas soon to realize. The afternoon mail brought a letter from Ruth.\r\nMartin opened it with a premonition of disaster, and read it standing\r\nat the open door when he had received it from the postman. As he read,\r\nmechanically his hand sought his pocket for the tobacco and brown paper\r\nof his old cigarette days. He was not aware that the pocket was empty\r\nor that he had even reached for the materials with which to roll a\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\nIt was not a passionate letter. There were no touches of anger in it.\r\nBut all the way through, from the first sentence to the last, was\r\nsounded the note of hurt and disappointment. She had expected better of\r\nhim. She had thought he had got over his youthful wildness, that her\r\nlove for him had been sufficiently worth while to enable him to live\r\nseriously and decently. And now her father and mother had taken a firm\r\nstand and commanded that the engagement be broken. That they were\r\njustified in this she could not but admit. Their relation could never\r\nbe a happy one. It had been unfortunate from the first. But one regret\r\nshe voiced in the whole letter, and it was a bitter one to Martin. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nonly you had settled down to some position and attempted to make\r\nsomething of yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was not to be. Your past\r\nlife had been too wild and irregular. I can understand that you are not\r\nto be blamed. You could act only according to your nature and your\r\nearly training. So I do not blame you, Martin. Please remember that. It\r\nwas simply a mistake. As father and mother have contended, we were not\r\nmade for each other, and we should both be happy because it was\r\ndiscovered not too late.\xe2\x80\x9d . . \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no use trying to see me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid toward the last. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be an unhappy meeting for both of us,\r\nas well as for my mother. I feel, as it is, that I have caused her\r\ngreat pain and worry. I shall have to do much living to atone for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read it through to the end, carefully, a second time, then sat down\r\nand replied. He outlined the remarks he had uttered at the socialist\r\nmeeting, pointing out that they were in all ways the converse of what\r\nthe newspaper had put in his mouth. Toward the end of the letter he was\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s own lover pleading passionately for love. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease answer,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand in your answer you have to tell me but one thing. Do you\r\nlove me? That is all\xe2\x80\x94the answer to that one question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no answer came the next day, nor the next. \xe2\x80\x9cOverdue\xe2\x80\x9d lay untouched\r\nupon the table, and each day the heap of returned manuscripts under the\r\ntable grew larger. For the first time Martin\xe2\x80\x99s glorious sleep was\r\ninterrupted by insomnia, and he tossed through long, restless nights.\r\nThree times he called at the Morse home, but was turned away by the\r\nservant who answered the bell. Brissenden lay sick in his hotel, too\r\nfeeble to stir out, and, though Martin was with him often, he did not\r\nworry him with his troubles.\r\n\r\nFor Martin\xe2\x80\x99s troubles were many. The aftermath of the cub reporter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeed was even wider than Martin had anticipated. The Portuguese grocer\r\nrefused him further credit, while the greengrocer, who was an American\r\nand proud of it, had called him a traitor to his country and refused\r\nfurther dealings with him\xe2\x80\x94carrying his patriotism to such a degree that\r\nhe cancelled Martin\xe2\x80\x99s account and forbade him ever to attempt to pay\r\nit. The talk in the neighborhood reflected the same feeling, and\r\nindignation against Martin ran high. No one would have anything to do\r\nwith a socialist traitor. Poor Maria was dubious and frightened, but\r\nshe remained loyal. The children of the neighborhood recovered from the\r\nawe of the grand carriage which once had visited Martin, and from safe\r\ndistances they called him \xe2\x80\x9chobo\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbum.\xe2\x80\x9d The Silva tribe, however,\r\nstanchly defended him, fighting more than one pitched battle for his\r\nhonor, and black eyes and bloody noses became quite the order of the\r\nday and added to Maria\xe2\x80\x99s perplexities and troubles.\r\n\r\nOnce, Martin met Gertrude on the street, down in Oakland, and learned\r\nwhat he knew could not be otherwise\xe2\x80\x94that Bernard Higginbotham was\r\nfurious with him for having dragged the family into public disgrace,\r\nand that he had forbidden him the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you go away, Martin?\xe2\x80\x9d Gertrude had begged. \xe2\x80\x9cGo away and get\r\na job somewhere and steady down. Afterwards, when this all blows over,\r\nyou can come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin shook his head, but gave no explanations. How could he explain?\r\nHe was appalled at the awful intellectual chasm that yawned between him\r\nand his people. He could never cross it and explain to them his\r\nposition,\xe2\x80\x94the Nietzschean position, in regard to socialism. There were\r\nnot words enough in the English language, nor in any language, to make\r\nhis attitude and conduct intelligible to them. Their highest concept of\r\nright conduct, in his case, was to get a job. That was their first word\r\nand their last. It constituted their whole lexicon of ideas. Get a job!\r\nGo to work! Poor, stupid slaves, he thought, while his sister talked.\r\nSmall wonder the world belonged to the strong. The slaves were obsessed\r\nby their own slavery. A job was to them a golden fetich before which\r\nthey fell down and worshipped.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head again, when Gertrude offered him money, though he\r\nknew that within the day he would have to make a trip to the\r\npawnbroker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t come near Bernard now,\xe2\x80\x9d she admonished him. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter a few months,\r\nwhen he is cooled down, if you want to, you can get the job of drivin\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndelivery-wagon for him. Any time you want me, just send for me an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went away weeping audibly, and he felt a pang of sorrow shoot\r\nthrough him at sight of her heavy body and uncouth gait. As he watched\r\nher go, the Nietzschean edifice seemed to shake and totter. The\r\nslave-class in the abstract was all very well, but it was not wholly\r\nsatisfactory when it was brought home to his own family. And yet, if\r\nthere was ever a slave trampled by the strong, that slave was his\r\nsister Gertrude. He grinned savagely at the paradox. A fine\r\nNietzsche-man he was, to allow his intellectual concepts to be shaken\r\nby the first sentiment or emotion that strayed along\xe2\x80\x94ay, to be shaken\r\nby the slave-morality itself, for that was what his pity for his sister\r\nreally was. The true noble men were above pity and compassion. Pity and\r\ncompassion had been generated in the subterranean barracoons of the\r\nslaves and were no more than the agony and sweat of the crowded\r\nmiserables and weaklings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOverdue\xe2\x80\x9d still continued to lie forgotten on the table. Every\r\nmanuscript that he had had out now lay under the table. Only one\r\nmanuscript he kept going, and that was Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEphemera.\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\nbicycle and black suit were again in pawn, and the type-writer people\r\nwere once more worrying about the rent. But such things no longer\r\nbothered him. He was seeking a new orientation, and until that was\r\nfound his life must stand still.\r\n\r\nAfter several weeks, what he had been waiting for happened. He met Ruth\r\non the street. It was true, she was accompanied by her brother, Norman,\r\nand it was true that they tried to ignore him and that Norman attempted\r\nto wave him aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you interfere with my sister, I\xe2\x80\x99ll call an officer,\xe2\x80\x9d Norman\r\nthreatened. \xe2\x80\x9cShe does not wish to speak with you, and your insistence\r\nis insult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you persist, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to call that officer, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nyour name in the papers,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered grimly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, get out of\r\nmy way and get the officer if you want to. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to talk with\r\nRuth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to have it from your own lips,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her.\r\n\r\nShe was pale and trembling, but she held up and looked inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question I asked in my letter,\xe2\x80\x9d he prompted.\r\n\r\nNorman made an impatient movement, but Martin checked him with a swift\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs all this of your own free will?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke in a low, firm voice and with deliberation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nof my own free will. You have disgraced me so that I am ashamed to meet\r\nmy friends. They are all talking about me, I know. That is all I can\r\ntell you. You have made me very unhappy, and I never wish to see you\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriends! Gossip! Newspaper misreports! Surely such things are not\r\nstronger than love! I can only believe that you never loved me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA blush drove the pallor from her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what has passed?\xe2\x80\x9d she said faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cMartin, you do not know\r\nwhat you are saying. I am not common.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have anything to do with you,\xe2\x80\x9d Norman\r\nblurted out, starting on with her.\r\n\r\nMartin stood aside and let them pass, fumbling unconsciously in his\r\ncoat pocket for the tobacco and brown papers that were not there.\r\n\r\nIt was a long walk to North Oakland, but it was not until he went up\r\nthe steps and entered his room that he knew he had walked it. He found\r\nhimself sitting on the edge of the bed and staring about him like an\r\nawakened somnambulist. He noticed \xe2\x80\x9cOverdue\xe2\x80\x9d lying on the table and drew\r\nup his chair and reached for his pen. There was in his nature a logical\r\ncompulsion toward completeness. Here was something undone. It had been\r\ndeferred against the completion of something else. Now that something\r\nelse had been finished, and he would apply himself to this task until\r\nit was finished. What he would do next he did not know. All that he did\r\nknow was that a climacteric in his life had been attained. A period had\r\nbeen reached, and he was rounding it off in workman-like fashion. He\r\nwas not curious about the future. He would soon enough find out what it\r\nheld in store for him. Whatever it was, it did not matter. Nothing\r\nseemed to matter.\r\n\r\nFor five days he toiled on at \xe2\x80\x9cOverdue,\xe2\x80\x9d going nowhere, seeing nobody,\r\nand eating meagrely. On the morning of the sixth day the postman\r\nbrought him a thin letter from the editor of _The Parthenon_. A glance\r\ntold him that \xe2\x80\x9cEphemera\xe2\x80\x9d was accepted. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have submitted the poem to\r\nMr. Cartwright Bruce,\xe2\x80\x9d the editor went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cand he has reported\r\nso favorably upon it that we cannot let it go. As an earnest of our\r\npleasure in publishing the poem, let me tell you that we have set it\r\nfor the August number, our July number being already made up. Kindly\r\nextend our pleasure and our thanks to Mr. Brissenden. Please send by\r\nreturn mail his photograph and biographical data. If our honorarium is\r\nunsatisfactory, kindly telegraph us at once and state what you consider\r\na fair price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSince the honorarium they had offered was three hundred and fifty\r\ndollars, Martin thought it not worth while to telegraph. Then, too,\r\nthere was Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s consent to be gained. Well, he had been right,\r\nafter all. Here was one magazine editor who knew real poetry when he\r\nsaw it. And the price was splendid, even though it was for the poem of\r\na century. As for Cartwright Bruce, Martin knew that he was the one\r\ncritic for whose opinions Brissenden had any respect.\r\n\r\nMartin rode down town on an electric car, and as he watched the houses\r\nand cross-streets slipping by he was aware of a regret that he was not\r\nmore elated over his friend\xe2\x80\x99s success and over his own signal victory.\r\nThe one critic in the United States had pronounced favorably on the\r\npoem, while his own contention that good stuff could find its way into\r\nthe magazines had proved correct. But enthusiasm had lost its spring in\r\nhim, and he found that he was more anxious to see Brissenden than he\r\nwas to carry the good news. The acceptance of _The Parthenon_ had\r\nrecalled to him that during his five days\xe2\x80\x99 devotion to \xe2\x80\x9cOverdue\xe2\x80\x9d he had\r\nnot heard from Brissenden nor even thought about him. For the first\r\ntime Martin realized the daze he had been in, and he felt shame for\r\nhaving forgotten his friend. But even the shame did not burn very\r\nsharply. He was numb to emotions of any sort save the artistic ones\r\nconcerned in the writing of \xe2\x80\x9cOverdue.\xe2\x80\x9d So far as other affairs were\r\nconcerned, he had been in a trance. For that matter, he was still in a\r\ntrance. All this life through which the electric car whirred seemed\r\nremote and unreal, and he would have experienced little interest and\r\nless shock if the great stone steeple of the church he passed had\r\nsuddenly crumbled to mortar-dust upon his head.\r\n\r\nAt the hotel he hurried up to Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s room, and hurried down\r\nagain. The room was empty. All luggage was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Mr. Brissenden leave any address?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the clerk, who looked\r\nat him curiously for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMartin shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the papers were full of it. He was found dead in bed. Suicide.\r\nShot himself through the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he buried yet?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin seemed to hear his voice, like some one\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s voice, from a long way off, asking the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. The body was shipped East after the inquest. Lawyers engaged by\r\nhis people saw to the arrangements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were quick about it, I must say,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin commented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It happened five days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive days ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, five days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said as he turned and went out.\r\n\r\nAt the corner he stepped into the Western Union and sent a telegram to\r\n_The Parthenon_, advising them to proceed with the publication of the\r\npoem. He had in his pocket but five cents with which to pay his carfare\r\nhome, so he sent the message collect.\r\n\r\nOnce in his room, he resumed his writing. The days and nights came and\r\nwent, and he sat at his table and wrote on. He went nowhere, save to\r\nthe pawnbroker, took no exercise, and ate methodically when he was\r\nhungry and had something to cook, and just as methodically went without\r\nwhen he had nothing to cook. Composed as the story was, in advance,\r\nchapter by chapter, he nevertheless saw and developed an opening that\r\nincreased the power of it, though it necessitated twenty thousand\r\nadditional words. It was not that there was any vital need that the\r\nthing should be well done, but that his artistic canons compelled him\r\nto do it well. He worked on in the daze, strangely detached from the\r\nworld around him, feeling like a familiar ghost among these literary\r\ntrappings of his former life. He remembered that some one had said that\r\na ghost was the spirit of a man who was dead and who did not have sense\r\nenough to know it; and he paused for the moment to wonder if he were\r\nreally dead and unaware of it.\r\n\r\nCame the day when \xe2\x80\x9cOverdue\xe2\x80\x9d was finished. The agent of the type-writer\r\nfirm had come for the machine, and he sat on the bed while Martin, on\r\nthe one chair, typed the last pages of the final chapter. \xe2\x80\x9cFinis,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwrote, in capitals, at the end, and to him it was indeed finis. He\r\nwatched the type-writer carried out the door with a feeling of relief,\r\nthen went over and lay down on the bed. He was faint from hunger. Food\r\nhad not passed his lips in thirty-six hours, but he did not think about\r\nit. He lay on his back, with closed eyes, and did not think at all,\r\nwhile the daze or stupor slowly welled up, saturating his\r\nconsciousness. Half in delirium, he began muttering aloud the lines of\r\nan anonymous poem Brissenden had been fond of quoting to him. Maria,\r\nlistening anxiously outside his door, was perturbed by his monotonous\r\nutterance. The words in themselves were not significant to her, but the\r\nfact that he was saying them was. \xe2\x80\x9cI have done,\xe2\x80\x9d was the burden of the\r\npoem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I have done\xe2\x80\x94\r\nPut by the lute.\r\nSong and singing soon are over\r\nAs the airy shades that hover\r\nIn among the purple clover.\r\nI have done\xe2\x80\x94\r\nPut by the lute.\r\nOnce I sang as early thrushes\r\nSing among the dewy bushes;\r\nNow I\xe2\x80\x99m mute.\r\nI am like a weary linnet,\r\nFor my throat has no song in it;\r\nI have had my singing minute.\r\nI have done.\r\nPut by the lute.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMaria could stand it no longer, and hurried away to the stove, where\r\nshe filled a quart-bowl with soup, putting into it the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of\r\nchopped meat and vegetables which her ladle scraped from the bottom of\r\nthe pot. Martin roused himself and sat up and began to eat, between\r\nspoonfuls reassuring Maria that he had not been talking in his sleep\r\nand that he did not have any fever.\r\n\r\nAfter she left him he sat drearily, with drooping shoulders, on the\r\nedge of the bed, gazing about him with lack-lustre eyes that saw\r\nnothing until the torn wrapper of a magazine, which had come in the\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x99s mail and which lay unopened, shot a gleam of light into his\r\ndarkened brain. It is _The Parthenon_, he thought, the August\r\n_Parthenon_, and it must contain \xe2\x80\x9cEphemera.\xe2\x80\x9d If only Brissenden were\r\nhere to see!\r\n\r\nHe was turning the pages of the magazine, when suddenly he stopped.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEphemera\xe2\x80\x9d had been featured, with gorgeous head-piece and\r\nBeardsley-like margin decorations. On one side of the head-piece was\r\nBrissenden\xe2\x80\x99s photograph, on the other side was the photograph of Sir\r\nJohn Value, the British Ambassador. A preliminary editorial note quoted\r\nSir John Value as saying that there were no poets in America, and the\r\npublication of \xe2\x80\x9cEphemera\xe2\x80\x9d was _The Parthenon\xe2\x80\x99s_. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, take that, Sir\r\nJohn Value!\xe2\x80\x9d Cartwright Bruce was described as the greatest critic in\r\nAmerica, and he was quoted as saying that \xe2\x80\x9cEphemera\xe2\x80\x9d was the greatest\r\npoem ever written in America. And finally, the editor\xe2\x80\x99s foreword ended\r\nwith: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have not yet made up our minds entirely as to the merits of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEphemera\xe2\x80\x9d; perhaps we shall never be able to do so. But we have read\r\nit often, wondering at the words and their arrangement, wondering where\r\nMr. Brissenden got them, and how he could fasten them together.\xe2\x80\x9d Then\r\nfollowed the poem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty good thing you died, Briss, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin murmured, letting\r\nthe magazine slip between his knees to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe cheapness and vulgarity of it was nauseating, and Martin noted\r\napathetically that he was not nauseated very much. He wished he could\r\nget angry, but did not have energy enough to try. He was too numb. His\r\nblood was too congealed to accelerate to the swift tidal flow of\r\nindignation. After all, what did it matter? It was on a par with all\r\nthe rest that Brissenden had condemned in bourgeois society.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Briss,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin communed; \xe2\x80\x9che would never have forgiven me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRousing himself with an effort, he possessed himself of a box which had\r\nonce contained type-writer paper. Going through its contents, he drew\r\nforth eleven poems which his friend had written. These he tore\r\nlengthwise and crosswise and dropped into the waste basket. He did it\r\nlanguidly, and, when he had finished, sat on the edge of the bed\r\nstaring blankly before him.\r\n\r\nHow long he sat there he did not know, until, suddenly, across his\r\nsightless vision he saw form a long horizontal line of white. It was\r\ncurious. But as he watched it grow in definiteness he saw that it was a\r\ncoral reef smoking in the white Pacific surges. Next, in the line of\r\nbreakers he made out a small canoe, an outrigger canoe. In the stern he\r\nsaw a young bronzed god in scarlet hip-cloth dipping a flashing paddle.\r\nHe recognized him. He was Moti, the youngest son of Tati, the chief,\r\nand this was Tahiti, and beyond that smoking reef lay the sweet land of\r\nPapara and the chief\xe2\x80\x99s grass house by the river\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. It was the end\r\nof the day, and Moti was coming home from the fishing. He was waiting\r\nfor the rush of a big breaker whereon to jump the reef. Then he saw\r\nhimself, sitting forward in the canoe as he had often sat in the past,\r\ndipping a paddle that waited Moti\xe2\x80\x99s word to dig in like mad when the\r\nturquoise wall of the great breaker rose behind them. Next, he was no\r\nlonger an onlooker but was himself in the canoe, Moti was crying out,\r\nthey were both thrusting hard with their paddles, racing on the steep\r\nface of the flying turquoise. Under the bow the water was hissing as\r\nfrom a steam jet, the air was filled with driven spray, there was a\r\nrush and rumble and long-echoing roar, and the canoe floated on the\r\nplacid water of the lagoon. Moti laughed and shook the salt water from\r\nhis eyes, and together they paddled in to the pounded-coral beach where\r\nTati\xe2\x80\x99s grass walls through the cocoanut-palms showed golden in the\r\nsetting sun.\r\n\r\nThe picture faded, and before his eyes stretched the disorder of his\r\nsqualid room. He strove in vain to see Tahiti again. He knew there was\r\nsinging among the trees and that the maidens were dancing in the\r\nmoonlight, but he could not see them. He could see only the littered\r\nwriting-table, the empty space where the type-writer had stood, and the\r\nunwashed window-pane. He closed his eyes with a groan, and slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe slept heavily all night, and did not stir until aroused by the\r\npostman on his morning round. Martin felt tired and passive, and went\r\nthrough his letters aimlessly. One thin envelope, from a robber\r\nmagazine, contained a check for twenty-two dollars. He had been dunning\r\nfor it for a year and a half. He noted its amount apathetically. The\r\nold-time thrill at receiving a publisher\xe2\x80\x99s check was gone. Unlike his\r\nearlier checks, this one was not pregnant with promise of great things\r\nto come. To him it was a check for twenty-two dollars, that was all,\r\nand it would buy him something to eat.\r\n\r\nAnother check was in the same mail, sent from a New York weekly in\r\npayment for some humorous verse which had been accepted months before.\r\nIt was for ten dollars. An idea came to him, which he calmly\r\nconsidered. He did not know what he was going to do, and he felt in no\r\nhurry to do anything. In the meantime he must live. Also he owed\r\nnumerous debts. Would it not be a paying investment to put stamps on\r\nthe huge pile of manuscripts under the table and start them on their\r\ntravels again? One or two of them might be accepted. That would help\r\nhim to live. He decided on the investment, and, after he had cashed the\r\nchecks at the bank down in Oakland, he bought ten dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of\r\npostage stamps. The thought of going home to cook breakfast in his\r\nstuffy little room was repulsive to him. For the first time he refused\r\nto consider his debts. He knew that in his room he could manufacture a\r\nsubstantial breakfast at a cost of from fifteen to twenty cents. But,\r\ninstead, he went into the Forum Caf\xc3\xa9 and ordered a breakfast that cost\r\ntwo dollars. He tipped the waiter a quarter, and spent fifty cents for\r\na package of Egyptian cigarettes. It was the first time he had smoked\r\nsince Ruth had asked him to stop. But he could see now no reason why he\r\nshould not, and besides, he wanted to smoke. And what did the money\r\nmatter? For five cents he could have bought a package of Durham and\r\nbrown papers and rolled forty cigarettes\xe2\x80\x94but what of it? Money had no\r\nmeaning to him now except what it would immediately buy. He was\r\nchartless and rudderless, and he had no port to make, while drifting\r\ninvolved the least living, and it was living that hurt.\r\n\r\nThe days slipped along, and he slept eight hours regularly every night.\r\nThough now, while waiting for more checks, he ate in the Japanese\r\nrestaurants where meals were served for ten cents, his wasted body\r\nfilled out, as did the hollows in his cheeks. He no longer abused\r\nhimself with short sleep, overwork, and overstudy. He wrote nothing,\r\nand the books were closed. He walked much, out in the hills, and loafed\r\nlong hours in the quiet parks. He had no friends nor acquaintances, nor\r\ndid he make any. He had no inclination. He was waiting for some\r\nimpulse, from he knew not where, to put his stopped life into motion\r\nagain. In the meantime his life remained run down, planless, and empty\r\nand idle.\r\n\r\nOnce he made a trip to San Francisco to look up the \xe2\x80\x9creal dirt.\xe2\x80\x9d But at\r\nthe last moment, as he stepped into the upstairs entrance, he recoiled\r\nand turned and fled through the swarming ghetto. He was frightened at\r\nthe thought of hearing philosophy discussed, and he fled furtively, for\r\nfear that some one of the \xe2\x80\x9creal dirt\xe2\x80\x9d might chance along and recognize\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSometimes he glanced over the magazines and newspapers to see how\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEphemera\xe2\x80\x9d was being maltreated. It had made a hit. But what a hit!\r\nEverybody had read it, and everybody was discussing whether or not it\r\nwas really poetry. The local papers had taken it up, and daily there\r\nappeared columns of learned criticisms, facetious editorials, and\r\nserious letters from subscribers. Helen Della Delmar (proclaimed with a\r\nflourish of trumpets and rolling of tomtoms to be the greatest woman\r\npoet in the United States) denied Brissenden a seat beside her on\r\nPegasus and wrote voluminous letters to the public, proving that he was\r\nno poet.\r\n\r\n_The Parthenon_ came out in its next number patting itself on the back\r\nfor the stir it had made, sneering at Sir John Value, and exploiting\r\nBrissenden\xe2\x80\x99s death with ruthless commercialism. A newspaper with a\r\nsworn circulation of half a million published an original and\r\nspontaneous poem by Helen Della Delmar, in which she gibed and sneered\r\nat Brissenden. Also, she was guilty of a second poem, in which she\r\nparodied him.\r\n\r\nMartin had many times to be glad that Brissenden was dead. He had hated\r\nthe crowd so, and here all that was finest and most sacred of him had\r\nbeen thrown to the crowd. Daily the vivisection of Beauty went on.\r\nEvery nincompoop in the land rushed into free print, floating their\r\nwizened little egos into the public eye on the surge of Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreatness. Quoth one paper: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have received a letter from a gentleman\r\nwho wrote a poem just like it, only better, some time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d Another\r\npaper, in deadly seriousness, reproving Helen Della Delmar for her\r\nparody, said: \xe2\x80\x9cBut unquestionably Miss Delmar wrote it in a moment of\r\nbadinage and not quite with the respect that one great poet should show\r\nto another and perhaps to the greatest. However, whether Miss Delmar be\r\njealous or not of the man who invented \xe2\x80\x98Ephemera,\xe2\x80\x99 it is certain that\r\nshe, like thousands of others, is fascinated by his work, and that the\r\nday may come when she will try to write lines like his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMinisters began to preach sermons against \xe2\x80\x9cEphemera,\xe2\x80\x9d and one, who too\r\nstoutly stood for much of its content, was expelled for heresy. The\r\ngreat poem contributed to the gayety of the world. The comic\r\nverse-writers and the cartoonists took hold of it with screaming\r\nlaughter, and in the personal columns of society weeklies jokes were\r\nperpetrated on it to the effect that Charley Frensham told Archie\r\nJennings, in confidence, that five lines of \xe2\x80\x9cEphemera\xe2\x80\x9d would drive a\r\nman to beat a cripple, and that ten lines would send him to the bottom\r\nof the river.\r\n\r\nMartin did not laugh; nor did he grit his teeth in anger. The effect\r\nproduced upon him was one of great sadness. In the crash of his whole\r\nworld, with love on the pinnacle, the crash of magazinedom and the dear\r\npublic was a small crash indeed. Brissenden had been wholly right in\r\nhis judgment of the magazines, and he, Martin, had spent arduous and\r\nfutile years in order to find it out for himself. The magazines were\r\nall Brissenden had said they were and more. Well, he was done, he\r\nsolaced himself. He had hitched his wagon to a star and been landed in\r\na pestiferous marsh. The visions of Tahiti\xe2\x80\x94clean, sweet Tahiti\xe2\x80\x94were\r\ncoming to him more frequently. And there were the low Paumotus, and the\r\nhigh Marquesas; he saw himself often, now, on board trading schooners\r\nor frail little cutters, slipping out at dawn through the reef at\r\nPapeete and beginning the long beat through the pearl-atolls to\r\nNukahiva and the Bay of Taiohae, where Tamari, he knew, would kill a\r\npig in honor of his coming, and where Tamari\xe2\x80\x99s flower-garlanded\r\ndaughters would seize his hands and with song and laughter garland him\r\nwith flowers. The South Seas were calling, and he knew that sooner or\r\nlater he would answer the call.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he drifted, resting and recuperating after the long\r\ntraverse he had made through the realm of knowledge. When _The\r\nParthenon_ check of three hundred and fifty dollars was forwarded to\r\nhim, he turned it over to the local lawyer who had attended to\r\nBrissenden\xe2\x80\x99s affairs for his family. Martin took a receipt for the\r\ncheck, and at the same time gave a note for the hundred dollars\r\nBrissenden had let him have.\r\n\r\nThe time was not long when Martin ceased patronizing the Japanese\r\nrestaurants. At the very moment when he had abandoned the fight, the\r\ntide turned. But it had turned too late. Without a thrill he opened a\r\nthick envelope from _The Millennium_, scanned the face of a check that\r\nrepresented three hundred dollars, and noted that it was the payment on\r\nacceptance for \xe2\x80\x9cAdventure.\xe2\x80\x9d Every debt he owed in the world, including\r\nthe pawnshop, with its usurious interest, amounted to less than a\r\nhundred dollars. And when he had paid everything, and lifted the\r\nhundred-dollar note with Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, he still had over a\r\nhundred dollars in pocket. He ordered a suit of clothes from the tailor\r\nand ate his meals in the best caf\xc3\xa9s in town. He still slept in his\r\nlittle room at Maria\xe2\x80\x99s, but the sight of his new clothes caused the\r\nneighborhood children to cease from calling him \xe2\x80\x9chobo\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctramp\xe2\x80\x9d from\r\nthe roofs of woodsheds and over back fences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWiki-Wiki,\xe2\x80\x9d his Hawaiian short story, was bought by _Warren\xe2\x80\x99s Monthly_\r\nfor two hundred and fifty dollars. _The Northern Review_ took his\r\nessay, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cradle of Beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d and _Mackintosh\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine_ took \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nPalmist\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the poem he had written to Marian. The editors and readers\r\nwere back from their summer vacations, and manuscripts were being\r\nhandled quickly. But Martin could not puzzle out what strange whim\r\nanimated them to this general acceptance of the things they had\r\npersistently rejected for two years. Nothing of his had been published.\r\nHe was not known anywhere outside of Oakland, and in Oakland, with the\r\nfew who thought they knew him, he was notorious as a red-shirt and a\r\nsocialist. So there was no explaining this sudden acceptability of his\r\nwares. It was sheer jugglery of fate.\r\n\r\nAfter it had been refused by a number of magazines, he had taken\r\nBrissenden\xe2\x80\x99s rejected advice and started \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun\xe2\x80\x9d on the\r\nround of publishers. After several refusals, Singletree, Darnley & Co.\r\naccepted it, promising fall publication. When Martin asked for an\r\nadvance on royalties, they wrote that such was not their custom, that\r\nbooks of that nature rarely paid for themselves, and that they doubted\r\nif his book would sell a thousand copies. Martin figured what the book\r\nwould earn him on such a sale. Retailed at a dollar, on a royalty of\r\nfifteen per cent, it would bring him one hundred and fifty dollars. He\r\ndecided that if he had it to do over again he would confine himself to\r\nfiction. \xe2\x80\x9cAdventure,\xe2\x80\x9d one-fourth as long, had brought him twice as much\r\nfrom _The Millennium_. That newspaper paragraph he had read so long ago\r\nhad been true, after all. The first-class magazines did not pay on\r\nacceptance, and they paid well. Not two cents a word, but four cents a\r\nword, had _The Millennium_ paid him. And, furthermore, they bought good\r\nstuff, too, for were they not buying his? This last thought he\r\naccompanied with a grin.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Singletree, Darnley & Co., offering to sell out his rights\r\nin \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun\xe2\x80\x9d for a hundred dollars, but they did not care\r\nto take the risk. In the meantime he was not in need of money, for\r\nseveral of his later stories had been accepted and paid for. He\r\nactually opened a bank account, where, without a debt in the world, he\r\nhad several hundred dollars to his credit. \xe2\x80\x9cOverdue,\xe2\x80\x9d after having been\r\ndeclined by a number of magazines, came to rest at the Meredith-Lowell\r\nCompany. Martin remembered the five dollars Gertrude had given him, and\r\nhis resolve to return it to her a hundred times over; so he wrote for\r\nan advance on royalties of five hundred dollars. To his surprise a\r\ncheck for that amount, accompanied by a contract, came by return mail.\r\nHe cashed the check into five-dollar gold pieces and telephoned\r\nGertrude that he wanted to see her.\r\n\r\nShe arrived at the house panting and short of breath from the haste she\r\nhad made. Apprehensive of trouble, she had stuffed the few dollars she\r\npossessed into her hand-satchel; and so sure was she that disaster had\r\novertaken her brother, that she stumbled forward, sobbing, into his\r\narms, at the same time thrusting the satchel mutely at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have come myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a row with Mr.\r\nHigginbotham, and that is what would have surely happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right after a time,\xe2\x80\x9d she assured him, while she wondered\r\nwhat the trouble was that Martin was in. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99d best get a job\r\nfirst an\xe2\x80\x99 steady down. Bernard does like to see a man at honest work.\r\nThat stuff in the newspapers broke \xe2\x80\x99m all up. I never saw \xe2\x80\x99m so mad\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get a job,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you can\r\ntell him so from me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need a job, and there\xe2\x80\x99s the proof of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe emptied the hundred gold pieces into her lap in a glinting, tinkling\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember that fiver you gave me the time I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have carfare?\r\nWell, there it is, with ninety-nine brothers of different ages but all\r\nof the same size.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Gertrude had been frightened when she arrived, she was now in a\r\npanic of fear. Her fear was such that it was certitude. She was not\r\nsuspicious. She was convinced. She looked at Martin in horror, and her\r\nheavy limbs shrank under the golden stream as though it were burning\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s yours,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed.\r\n\r\nShe burst into tears, and began to moan, \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor boy, my poor boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was puzzled for a moment. Then he divined the cause of her agitation\r\nand handed her the Meredith-Lowell letter which had accompanied the\r\ncheck. She stumbled through it, pausing now and again to wipe her eyes,\r\nand when she had finished, said:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 does it mean that you come by the money honestly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore honestly than if I\xe2\x80\x99d won it in a lottery. I earned it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly faith came back to her, and she reread the letter carefully. It\r\ntook him long to explain to her the nature of the transaction which had\r\nput the money into his possession, and longer still to get her to\r\nunderstand that the money was really hers and that he did not need it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put it in the bank for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said finally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll do nothing of the sort. It\xe2\x80\x99s yours, to do with as you please,\r\nand if you won\xe2\x80\x99t take it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to Maria. She\xe2\x80\x99ll know what to do\r\nwith it. I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest, though, that you hire a servant and take a good\r\nlong rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to tell Bernard all about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced, when she was\r\nleaving.\r\n\r\nMartin winced, then grinned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, maybe, he\xe2\x80\x99ll invite me to dinner again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he will\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed fervently, as she drew\r\nhim to her and kissed and hugged him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day Martin became aware that he was lonely. He was healthy and\r\nstrong, and had nothing to do. The cessation from writing and studying,\r\nthe death of Brissenden, and the estrangement from Ruth had made a big\r\nhole in his life; and his life refused to be pinned down to good living\r\nin caf\xc3\xa9s and the smoking of Egyptian cigarettes. It was true the South\r\nSeas were calling to him, but he had a feeling that the game was not\r\nyet played out in the United States. Two books were soon to be\r\npublished, and he had more books that might find publication. Money\r\ncould be made out of them, and he would wait and take a sackful of it\r\ninto the South Seas. He knew a valley and a bay in the Marquesas that\r\nhe could buy for a thousand Chili dollars. The valley ran from the\r\nhorseshoe, land-locked bay to the tops of the dizzy, cloud-capped peaks\r\nand contained perhaps ten thousand acres. It was filled with tropical\r\nfruits, wild chickens, and wild pigs, with an occasional herd of wild\r\ncattle, while high up among the peaks were herds of wild goats harried\r\nby packs of wild dogs. The whole place was wild. Not a human lived in\r\nit. And he could buy it and the bay for a thousand Chili dollars.\r\n\r\nThe bay, as he remembered it, was magnificent, with water deep enough\r\nto accommodate the largest vessel afloat, and so safe that the South\r\nPacific Directory recommended it as the best careening place for ships\r\nfor hundreds of miles around. He would buy a schooner\xe2\x80\x94one of those\r\nyacht-like, coppered crafts that sailed like witches\xe2\x80\x94and go trading\r\ncopra and pearling among the islands. He would make the valley and the\r\nbay his headquarters. He would build a patriarchal grass house like\r\nTati\xe2\x80\x99s, and have it and the valley and the schooner filled with\r\ndark-skinned servitors. He would entertain there the factor of Taiohae,\r\ncaptains of wandering traders, and all the best of the South Pacific\r\nriffraff. He would keep open house and entertain like a prince. And he\r\nwould forget the books he had opened and the world that had proved an\r\nillusion.\r\n\r\nTo do all this he must wait in California to fill the sack with money.\r\nAlready it was beginning to flow in. If one of the books made a strike,\r\nit might enable him to sell the whole heap of manuscripts. Also he\r\ncould collect the stories and the poems into books, and make sure of\r\nthe valley and the bay and the schooner. He would never write again.\r\nUpon that he was resolved. But in the meantime, awaiting the\r\npublication of the books, he must do something more than live dazed and\r\nstupid in the sort of uncaring trance into which he had fallen.\r\n\r\nHe noted, one Sunday morning, that the Bricklayers\xe2\x80\x99 Picnic took place\r\nthat day at Shell Mound Park, and to Shell Mound Park he went. He had\r\nbeen to the working-class picnics too often in his earlier life not to\r\nknow what they were like, and as he entered the park he experienced a\r\nrecrudescence of all the old sensations. After all, they were his kind,\r\nthese working people. He had been born among them, he had lived among\r\nthem, and though he had strayed for a time, it was well to come back\r\namong them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it ain\xe2\x80\x99t Mart!\xe2\x80\x9d he heard some one say, and the next moment a hearty\r\nhand was on his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere you ben all the time? Off to sea? Come\r\non an\xe2\x80\x99 have a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the old crowd in which he found himself\xe2\x80\x94the old crowd, with here\r\nand there a gap, and here and there a new face. The fellows were not\r\nbricklayers, but, as in the old days, they attended all Sunday picnics\r\nfor the dancing, and the fighting, and the fun. Martin drank with them,\r\nand began to feel really human once more. He was a fool to have ever\r\nleft them, he thought; and he was very certain that his sum of\r\nhappiness would have been greater had he remained with them and let\r\nalone the books and the people who sat in the high places. Yet the beer\r\nseemed not so good as of yore. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t taste as it used to taste.\r\nBrissenden had spoiled him for steam beer, he concluded, and wondered\r\nif, after all, the books had spoiled him for companionship with these\r\nfriends of his youth. He resolved that he would not be so spoiled, and\r\nhe went on to the dancing pavilion. Jimmy, the plumber, he met there,\r\nin the company of a tall, blond girl who promptly forsook him for\r\nMartin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee, it\xe2\x80\x99s like old times,\xe2\x80\x9d Jimmy explained to the gang that gave him\r\nthe laugh as Martin and the blonde whirled away in a waltz. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t give a rap. I\xe2\x80\x99m too damned glad to see \xe2\x80\x99m back. Watch \xe2\x80\x99m waltz,\r\neh? It\xe2\x80\x99s like silk. Who\xe2\x80\x99d blame any girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Martin restored the blonde to Jimmy, and the three of them, with\r\nhalf a dozen friends, watched the revolving couples and laughed and\r\njoked with one another. Everybody was glad to see Martin back. No book\r\nof his been published; he carried no fictitious value in their eyes.\r\nThey liked him for himself. He felt like a prince returned from excile,\r\nand his lonely heart burgeoned in the geniality in which it bathed. He\r\nmade a mad day of it, and was at his best. Also, he had money in his\r\npockets, and, as in the old days when he returned from sea with a\r\npay-day, he made the money fly.\r\n\r\nOnce, on the dancing-floor, he saw Lizzie Connolly go by in the arms of\r\na young workingman; and, later, when he made the round of the pavilion,\r\nhe came upon her sitting by a refreshment table. Surprise and greetings\r\nover, he led her away into the grounds, where they could talk without\r\nshouting down the music. From the instant he spoke to her, she was his.\r\nHe knew it. She showed it in the proud humility of her eyes, in every\r\ncaressing movement of her proudly carried body, and in the way she hung\r\nupon his speech. She was not the young girl as he had known her. She\r\nwas a woman, now, and Martin noted that her wild, defiant beauty had\r\nimproved, losing none of its wildness, while the defiance and the fire\r\nseemed more in control. \xe2\x80\x9cA beauty, a perfect beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured\r\nadmiringly under his breath. And he knew she was his, that all he had\r\nto do was to say \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d and she would go with him over the world\r\nwherever he led.\r\n\r\nEven as the thought flashed through his brain he received a heavy blow\r\non the side of his head that nearly knocked him down. It was a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfist, directed by a man so angry and in such haste that the fist had\r\nmissed the jaw for which it was aimed. Martin turned as he staggered,\r\nand saw the fist coming at him in a wild swing. Quite as a matter of\r\ncourse he ducked, and the fist flew harmlessly past, pivoting the man\r\nwho had driven it. Martin hooked with his left, landing on the pivoting\r\nman with the weight of his body behind the blow. The man went to the\r\nground sidewise, leaped to his feet, and made a mad rush. Martin saw\r\nhis passion-distorted face and wondered what could be the cause of the\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s anger. But while he wondered, he shot in a straight left, the\r\nweight of his body behind the blow. The man went over backward and fell\r\nin a crumpled heap. Jimmy and others of the gang were running toward\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMartin was thrilling all over. This was the old days with a vengeance,\r\nwith their dancing, and their fighting, and their fun. While he kept a\r\nwary eye on his antagonist, he glanced at Lizzie. Usually the girls\r\nscreamed when the fellows got to scrapping, but she had not screamed.\r\nShe was looking on with bated breath, leaning slightly forward, so keen\r\nwas her interest, one hand pressed to her breast, her cheek flushed,\r\nand in her eyes a great and amazed admiration.\r\n\r\nThe man had gained his feet and was struggling to escape the\r\nrestraining arms that were laid on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was waitin\xe2\x80\x99 for me to come back!\xe2\x80\x9d he was proclaiming to all and\r\nsundry. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was waitin\xe2\x80\x99 for me to come back, an\xe2\x80\x99 then that fresh guy\r\ncomes buttin\xe2\x80\x99 in. Let go o\xe2\x80\x99 me, I tell yeh. I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to fix \xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s eatin\xe2\x80\x99 yer?\xe2\x80\x9d Jimmy was demanding, as he helped hold the young\r\nfellow back. \xe2\x80\x9cThat guy\xe2\x80\x99s Mart Eden. He\xe2\x80\x99s nifty with his mits, lemme\r\ntell you that, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99ll eat you alive if you monkey with \xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t steal her on me that way,\xe2\x80\x9d the other interjected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe licked the Flyin\xe2\x80\x99 Dutchman, an\xe2\x80\x99 you know _him_,\xe2\x80\x9d Jimmy went on\r\nexpostulating. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 he did it in five rounds. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t last a\r\nminute against him. See?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis information seemed to have a mollifying effect, and the irate\r\nyoung man favored Martin with a measuring stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe don\xe2\x80\x99t look it,\xe2\x80\x9d he sneered; but the sneer was without passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what the Flyin\xe2\x80\x99 Dutchman thought,\xe2\x80\x9d Jimmy assured him. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\r\nnow, let\xe2\x80\x99s get outa this. There\xe2\x80\x99s lots of other girls. Come on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young fellow allowed himself to be led away toward the pavilion,\r\nand the gang followed after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin asked Lizzie. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s it all about, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlready the zest of combat, which of old had been so keen and lasting,\r\nhad died down, and he discovered that he was self-analytical, too much\r\nso to live, single heart and single hand, so primitive an existence.\r\n\r\nLizzie tossed her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s nobody,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just ben keepin\xe2\x80\x99 company with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cI was gettin\xe2\x80\x99 pretty\r\nlonesome. But I never forgot.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice sank lower, and she looked\r\nstraight before her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d throw \xe2\x80\x99m down for you any time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin looking at her averted face, knowing that all he had to do was\r\nto reach out his hand and pluck her, fell to pondering whether, after\r\nall, there was any real worth in refined, grammatical English, and, so,\r\nforgot to reply to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou put it all over him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said tentatively, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a husky young fellow, though,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted generously. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken him away, he might have given me my hands full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was that lady friend I seen you with that night?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just a lady friend,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a long time ago,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured contemplatively. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like\r\na thousand years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Martin went no further into the matter. He led the conversation off\r\ninto other channels. They had lunch in the restaurant, where he ordered\r\nwine and expensive delicacies and afterward he danced with her and with\r\nno one but her, till she was tired. He was a good dancer, and she\r\nwhirled around and around with him in a heaven of delight, her head\r\nagainst his shoulder, wishing that it could last forever. Later in the\r\nafternoon they strayed off among the trees, where, in the good old\r\nfashion, she sat down while he sprawled on his back, his head in her\r\nlap. He lay and dozed, while she fondled his hair, looked down on his\r\nclosed eyes, and loved him without reserve. Looking up suddenly, he\r\nread the tender advertisement in her face. Her eyes fluttered down,\r\nthen they opened and looked into his with soft defiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve kept straight all these years,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, her voice so low that\r\nit was almost a whisper.\r\n\r\nIn his heart Martin knew that it was the miraculous truth. And at his\r\nheart pleaded a great temptation. It was in his power to make her\r\nhappy. Denied happiness himself, why should he deny happiness to her?\r\nHe could marry her and take her down with him to dwell in the\r\ngrass-walled castle in the Marquesas. The desire to do it was strong,\r\nbut stronger still was the imperative command of his nature not to do\r\nit. In spite of himself he was still faithful to Love. The old days of\r\nlicense and easy living were gone. He could not bring them back, nor\r\ncould he go back to them. He was changed\xe2\x80\x94how changed he had not\r\nrealized until now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a marrying man, Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said lightly.\r\n\r\nThe hand caressing his hair paused perceptibly, then went on with the\r\nsame gentle stroke. He noticed her face harden, but it was with the\r\nhardness of resolution, for still the soft color was in her cheeks and\r\nshe was all glowing and melting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not mean that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she began, then faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cOr anyway I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m proud to be your friend. I\xe2\x80\x99d do\r\nanything for you. I\xe2\x80\x99m made that way, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin sat up. He took her hand in his. He did it deliberately, with\r\nwarmth but without passion; and such warmth chilled her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a great and noble woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is I who should be\r\nproud to know you. And I am, I am. You are a ray of light to me in a\r\nvery dark world, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be straight with you, just as straight\r\nas you have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether you\xe2\x80\x99re straight with me or not. You could do\r\nanything with me. You could throw me in the dirt an\xe2\x80\x99 walk on me. An\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re the only man in the world that can,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a defiant\r\nflash. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t taken care of myself ever since I was a kid for\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s just because of that that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so big and generous that you challenge me to equal\r\ngenerousness. I\xe2\x80\x99m not marrying, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not\xe2\x80\x94well, loving without\r\nmarrying, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my share of that in the past. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I\r\ncame here to-day and met you. But it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped now, and I never\r\nexpected it would turn out this way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut look here, Lizzie. I can\xe2\x80\x99t begin to tell you how much I like you.\r\nI do more than like you. I admire and respect you. You are magnificent,\r\nand you are magnificently good. But what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of words? Yet\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do. You\xe2\x80\x99ve had a hard life; let me make\r\nit easy for you.\xe2\x80\x9d (A joyous light welled into her eyes, then faded out\r\nagain.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure of getting hold of some money soon\xe2\x80\x94lots of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn that moment he abandoned the idea of the valley and the bay, the\r\ngrass-walled castle and the trim, white schooner. After all, what did\r\nit matter? He could go away, as he had done so often, before the mast,\r\non any ship bound anywhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to turn it over to you. There must be something you want\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ngo to school or business college. You might like to study and be a\r\nstenographer. I could fix it for you. Or maybe your father and mother\r\nare living\xe2\x80\x94I could set them up in a grocery store or something.\r\nAnything you want, just name it, and I can fix it for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, but sat, gazing straight before her, dry-eyed and\r\nmotionless, but with an ache in the throat which Martin divined so\r\nstrongly that it made his own throat ache. He regretted that he had\r\nspoken. It seemed so tawdry what he had offered her\xe2\x80\x94mere money\xe2\x80\x94compared\r\nwith what she offered him. He offered her an extraneous thing with\r\nwhich he could part without a pang, while she offered him herself,\r\nalong with disgrace and shame, and sin, and all her hopes of heaven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a catch in her voice that\r\nshe changed to a cough. She stood up. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, let\xe2\x80\x99s go home. I\xe2\x80\x99m all\r\ntired out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day was done, and the merrymakers had nearly all departed. But as\r\nMartin and Lizzie emerged from the trees they found the gang waiting\r\nfor them. Martin knew immediately the meaning of it. Trouble was\r\nbrewing. The gang was his body-guard. They passed out through the gates\r\nof the park with, straggling in the rear, a second gang, the friends\r\nthat Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s young man had collected to avenge the loss of his lady.\r\nSeveral constables and special police officers, anticipating trouble,\r\ntrailed along to prevent it, and herded the two gangs separately aboard\r\nthe train for San Francisco. Martin told Jimmy that he would get off at\r\nSixteenth Street Station and catch the electric car into Oakland.\r\nLizzie was very quiet and without interest in what was impending. The\r\ntrain pulled in to Sixteenth Street Station, and the waiting electric\r\ncar could be seen, the conductor of which was impatiently clanging the\r\ngong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere she is,\xe2\x80\x9d Jimmy counselled. \xe2\x80\x9cMake a run for it, an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ll hold\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em back. Now you go! Hit her up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hostile gang was temporarily disconcerted by the manoeuvre, then it\r\ndashed from the train in pursuit. The staid and sober Oakland folk who\r\nsat upon the car scarcely noted the young fellow and the girl who ran\r\nfor it and found a seat in front on the outside. They did not connect\r\nthe couple with Jimmy, who sprang on the steps, crying to the\r\nmotorman:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlam on the juice, old man, and beat it outa here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next moment Jimmy whirled about, and the passengers saw him land\r\nhis fist on the face of a running man who was trying to board the car.\r\nBut fists were landing on faces the whole length of the car. Thus,\r\nJimmy and his gang, strung out on the long, lower steps, met the\r\nattacking gang. The car started with a great clanging of its gong, and,\r\nas Jimmy\xe2\x80\x99s gang drove off the last assailants, they, too, jumped off to\r\nfinish the job. The car dashed on, leaving the flurry of combat far\r\nbehind, and its dumfounded passengers never dreamed that the quiet\r\nyoung man and the pretty working-girl sitting in the corner on the\r\noutside seat had been the cause of the row.\r\n\r\nMartin had enjoyed the fight, with a recrudescence of the old fighting\r\nthrills. But they quickly died away, and he was oppressed by a great\r\nsadness. He felt very old\xe2\x80\x94centuries older than those careless,\r\ncare-free young companions of his others days. He had travelled far,\r\ntoo far to go back. Their mode of life, which had once been his, was\r\nnow distasteful to him. He was disappointed in it all. He had developed\r\ninto an alien. As the steam beer had tasted raw, so their companionship\r\nseemed raw to him. He was too far removed. Too many thousands of opened\r\nbooks yawned between them and him. He had exiled himself. He had\r\ntravelled in the vast realm of intellect until he could no longer\r\nreturn home. On the other hand, he was human, and his gregarious need\r\nfor companionship remained unsatisfied. He had found no new home. As\r\nthe gang could not understand him, as his own family could not\r\nunderstand him, as the bourgeoisie could not understand him, so this\r\ngirl beside him, whom he honored high, could not understand him nor the\r\nhonor he paid her. His sadness was not untouched with bitterness as he\r\nthought it over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake it up with him,\xe2\x80\x9d he advised Lizzie, at parting, as they stood in\r\nfront of the workingman\xe2\x80\x99s shack in which she lived, near Sixth and\r\nMarket. He referred to the young fellow whose place he had usurped that\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said jovially. \xe2\x80\x9cAll you have to do is whistle and he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome running.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said simply.\r\n\r\nAnd he knew what she had meant.\r\n\r\nShe leaned toward him as he was about to say good night. But she leaned\r\nnot imperatively, not seductively, but wistfully and humbly. He was\r\ntouched to the heart. His large tolerance rose up in him. He put his\r\narms around her, and kissed her, and knew that upon his own lips rested\r\nas true a kiss as man ever received.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cI could die for you. I could die for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tore herself from him suddenly and ran up the steps. He felt a\r\nquick moisture in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartin Eden,\xe2\x80\x9d he communed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not a brute, and you\xe2\x80\x99re a damn poor\r\nNietzscheman. You\xe2\x80\x99d marry her if you could and fill her quivering heart\r\nfull with happiness. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t, you can\xe2\x80\x99t. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a damn shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered,\r\nremembering his Henly. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Life is, I think, a blunder and a shame.\xe2\x80\x99 It\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94a blunder and a shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun\xe2\x80\x9d was published in October. As Martin cut the\r\ncords of the express package and the half-dozen complimentary copies\r\nfrom the publishers spilled out on the table, a heavy sadness fell upon\r\nhim. He thought of the wild delight that would have been his had this\r\nhappened a few short months before, and he contrasted that delight that\r\nshould have been with his present uncaring coldness. His book, his\r\nfirst book, and his pulse had not gone up a fraction of a beat, and he\r\nwas only sad. It meant little to him now. The most it meant was that it\r\nmight bring some money, and little enough did he care for money.\r\n\r\nHe carried a copy out into the kitchen and presented it to Maria.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, in order to clear up her bewilderment. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwrote it in the room there, and I guess some few quarts of your\r\nvegetable soup went into the making of it. Keep it. It\xe2\x80\x99s yours. Just to\r\nremember me by, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not bragging, not showing off. His sole motive was to make her\r\nhappy, to make her proud of him, to justify her long faith in him. She\r\nput the book in the front room on top of the family Bible. A sacred\r\nthing was this book her lodger had made, a fetich of friendship. It\r\nsoftened the blow of his having been a laundryman, and though she could\r\nnot understand a line of it, she knew that every line of it was great.\r\nShe was a simple, practical, hard-working woman, but she possessed\r\nfaith in large endowment.\r\n\r\nJust as emotionlessly as he had received \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun\xe2\x80\x9d did he\r\nread the reviews of it that came in weekly from the clipping bureau.\r\nThe book was making a hit, that was evident. It meant more gold in the\r\nmoney sack. He could fix up Lizzie, redeem all his promises, and still\r\nhave enough left to build his grass-walled castle.\r\n\r\nSingletree, Darnley & Co. had cautiously brought out an edition of\r\nfifteen hundred copies, but the first reviews had started a second\r\nedition of twice the size through the presses; and ere this was\r\ndelivered a third edition of five thousand had been ordered. A London\r\nfirm made arrangements by cable for an English edition, and hot-footed\r\nupon this came the news of French, German, and Scandinavian\r\ntranslations in progress. The attack upon the Maeterlinck school could\r\nnot have been made at a more opportune moment. A fierce controversy was\r\nprecipitated. Saleeby and Haeckel indorsed and defended \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of\r\nthe Sun,\xe2\x80\x9d for once finding themselves on the same side of a question.\r\nCrookes and Wallace ranged up on the opposing side, while Sir Oliver\r\nLodge attempted to formulate a compromise that would jibe with his\r\nparticular cosmic theories. Maeterlinck\xe2\x80\x99s followers rallied around the\r\nstandard of mysticism. Chesterton set the whole world laughing with a\r\nseries of alleged non-partisan essays on the subject, and the whole\r\naffair, controversy and controversialists, was well-nigh swept into the\r\npit by a thundering broadside from George Bernard Shaw. Needless to say\r\nthe arena was crowded with hosts of lesser lights, and the dust and\r\nsweat and din became terrific.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a most marvellous happening,\xe2\x80\x9d Singletree, Darnley & Co. wrote\r\nMartin, \xe2\x80\x9ca critical philosophic essay selling like a novel. You could\r\nnot have chosen your subject better, and all contributory factors have\r\nbeen unwarrantedly propitious. We need scarcely to assure you that we\r\nare making hay while the sun shines. Over forty thousand copies have\r\nalready been sold in the United States and Canada, and a new edition of\r\ntwenty thousand is on the presses. We are overworked, trying to supply\r\nthe demand. Nevertheless we have helped to create that demand. We have\r\nalready spent five thousand dollars in advertising. The book is bound\r\nto be a record-breaker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease find herewith a contract in duplicate for your next book which\r\nwe have taken the liberty of forwarding to you. You will please note\r\nthat we have increased your royalties to twenty per cent, which is\r\nabout as high as a conservative publishing house dares go. If our offer\r\nis agreeable to you, please fill in the proper blank space with the\r\ntitle of your book. We make no stipulations concerning its nature. Any\r\nbook on any subject. If you have one already written, so much the\r\nbetter. Now is the time to strike. The iron could not be hotter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn receipt of signed contract we shall be pleased to make you an\r\nadvance on royalties of five thousand dollars. You see, we have faith\r\nin you, and we are going in on this thing big. We should like, also, to\r\ndiscuss with you the drawing up of a contract for a term of years, say\r\nten, during which we shall have the exclusive right of publishing in\r\nbook-form all that you produce. But more of this anon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin laid down the letter and worked a problem in mental arithmetic,\r\nfinding the product of fifteen cents times sixty thousand to be nine\r\nthousand dollars. He signed the new contract, inserting \xe2\x80\x9cThe Smoke of\r\nJoy\xe2\x80\x9d in the blank space, and mailed it back to the publishers along\r\nwith the twenty storiettes he had written in the days before he\r\ndiscovered the formula for the newspaper storiette. And promptly as the\r\nUnited States mail could deliver and return, came Singletree, Darnley &\r\nCo.\xe2\x80\x99s check for five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to come down town with me, Maria, this afternoon about two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, the morning the check arrived. \xe2\x80\x9cOr, better, meet\r\nme at Fourteenth and Broadway at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking out for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time she was there; but _shoes_ was the only clew to\r\nthe mystery her mind had been capable of evolving, and she suffered a\r\ndistinct shock of disappointment when Martin walked her right by a\r\nshoe-store and dived into a real estate office. What happened thereupon\r\nresided forever after in her memory as a dream. Fine gentlemen smiled\r\nat her benevolently as they talked with Martin and one another; a\r\ntype-writer clicked; signatures were affixed to an imposing document;\r\nher own landlord was there, too, and affixed his signature; and when\r\nall was over and she was outside on the sidewalk, her landlord spoke to\r\nher, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Maria, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay me no seven dollars\r\nand a half this month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria was too stunned for speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr next month, or the next, or the next,\xe2\x80\x9d her landlord said.\r\n\r\nShe thanked him incoherently, as if for a favor. And it was not until\r\nshe had returned home to North Oakland and conferred with her own kind,\r\nand had the Portuguese grocer investigate, that she really knew that\r\nshe was the owner of the little house in which she had lived and for\r\nwhich she had paid rent so long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you trade with me no more?\xe2\x80\x9d the Portuguese grocer asked\r\nMartin that evening, stepping out to hail him when he got off the car;\r\nand Martin explained that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing his own cooking any more, and\r\nthen went in and had a drink of wine on the house. He noted it was the\r\nbest wine the grocer had in stock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaria,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin announced that night, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave you. And\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re going to leave here yourself soon. Then you can rent the house\r\nand be a landlord yourself. You\xe2\x80\x99ve a brother in San Leandro or\r\nHaywards, and he\xe2\x80\x99s in the milk business. I want you to send all your\r\nwashing back unwashed\xe2\x80\x94understand?\xe2\x80\x94unwashed, and to go out to San\r\nLeandro to-morrow, or Haywards, or wherever it is, and see that brother\r\nof yours. Tell him to come to see me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be stopping at the Metropole\r\ndown in Oakland. He\xe2\x80\x99ll know a good milk-ranch when he sees one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that Maria became a landlord and the sole owner of a\r\ndairy, with two hired men to do the work for her and a bank account\r\nthat steadily increased despite the fact that her whole brood wore\r\nshoes and went to school. Few persons ever meet the fairy princes they\r\ndream about; but Maria, who worked hard and whose head was hard, never\r\ndreaming about fairy princes, entertained hers in the guise of an\r\nex-laundryman.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the world had begun to ask: \xe2\x80\x9cWho is this Martin Eden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe had declined to give any biographical data to his publishers, but\r\nthe newspapers were not to be denied. Oakland was his own town, and the\r\nreporters nosed out scores of individuals who could supply information.\r\nAll that he was and was not, all that he had done and most of what he\r\nhad not done, was spread out for the delectation of the public,\r\naccompanied by snapshots and photographs\xe2\x80\x94the latter procured from the\r\nlocal photographer who had once taken Martin\xe2\x80\x99s picture and who promptly\r\ncopyrighted it and put it on the market. At first, so great was his\r\ndisgust with the magazines and all bourgeois society, Martin fought\r\nagainst publicity; but in the end, because it was easier than not to,\r\nhe surrendered. He found that he could not refuse himself to the\r\nspecial writers who travelled long distances to see him. Then again,\r\neach day was so many hours long, and, since he no longer was occupied\r\nwith writing and studying, those hours had to be occupied somehow; so\r\nhe yielded to what was to him a whim, permitted interviews, gave his\r\nopinions on literature and philosophy, and even accepted invitations of\r\nthe bourgeoisie. He had settled down into a strange and comfortable\r\nstate of mind. He no longer cared. He forgave everybody, even the cub\r\nreporter who had painted him red and to whom he now granted a full page\r\nwith specially posed photographs.\r\n\r\nHe saw Lizzie occasionally, and it was patent that she regretted the\r\ngreatness that had come to him. It widened the space between them.\r\nPerhaps it was with the hope of narrowing it that she yielded to his\r\npersuasions to go to night school and business college and to have\r\nherself gowned by a wonderful dressmaker who charged outrageous prices.\r\nShe improved visibly from day to day, until Martin wondered if he was\r\ndoing right, for he knew that all her compliance and endeavor was for\r\nhis sake. She was trying to make herself of worth in his eyes\xe2\x80\x94of the\r\nsort of worth he seemed to value. Yet he gave her no hope, treating her\r\nin brotherly fashion and rarely seeing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOverdue\xe2\x80\x9d was rushed upon the market by the Meredith-Lowell Company in\r\nthe height of his popularity, and being fiction, in point of sales it\r\nmade even a bigger strike than \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun.\xe2\x80\x9d Week after week\r\nhis was the credit of the unprecedented performance of having two books\r\nat the head of the list of best-sellers. Not only did the story take\r\nwith the fiction-readers, but those who read \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith avidity were likewise attracted to the sea-story by the cosmic\r\ngrasp of mastery with which he had handled it. First he had attacked\r\nthe literature of mysticism, and had done it exceeding well; and, next,\r\nhe had successfully supplied the very literature he had exposited, thus\r\nproving himself to be that rare genius, a critic and a creator in one.\r\n\r\nMoney poured in on him, fame poured in on him; he flashed, comet-like,\r\nthrough the world of literature, and he was more amused than interested\r\nby the stir he was making. One thing was puzzling him, a little thing\r\nthat would have puzzled the world had it known. But the world would\r\nhave puzzled over his bepuzzlement rather than over the little thing\r\nthat to him loomed gigantic. Judge Blount invited him to dinner. That\r\nwas the little thing, or the beginning of the little thing, that was\r\nsoon to become the big thing. He had insulted Judge Blount, treated him\r\nabominably, and Judge Blount, meeting him on the street, invited him to\r\ndinner. Martin bethought himself of the numerous occasions on which he\r\nhad met Judge Blount at the Morses\xe2\x80\x99 and when Judge Blount had not\r\ninvited him to dinner. Why had he not invited him to dinner then? he\r\nasked himself. He had not changed. He was the same Martin Eden. What\r\nmade the difference? The fact that the stuff he had written had\r\nappeared inside the covers of books? But it was work performed. It was\r\nnot something he had done since. It was achievement accomplished at the\r\nvery time Judge Blount was sharing this general view and sneering at\r\nhis Spencer and his intellect. Therefore it was not for any real value,\r\nbut for a purely fictitious value that Judge Blount invited him to\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nMartin grinned and accepted the invitation, marvelling the while at his\r\ncomplacence. And at the dinner, where, with their womankind, were half\r\na dozen of those that sat in high places, and where Martin found\r\nhimself quite the lion, Judge Blount, warmly seconded by Judge Hanwell,\r\nurged privately that Martin should permit his name to be put up for the\r\nStyx\xe2\x80\x94the ultra-select club to which belonged, not the mere men of\r\nwealth, but the men of attainment. And Martin declined, and was more\r\npuzzled than ever.\r\n\r\nHe was kept busy disposing of his heap of manuscripts. He was\r\noverwhelmed by requests from editors. It had been discovered that he\r\nwas a stylist, with meat under his style. _The Northern Review_, after\r\npublishing \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cradle of Beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d had written him for half a dozen\r\nsimilar essays, which would have been supplied out of the heap, had not\r\n_Burton\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine_, in a speculative mood, offered him five hundred\r\ndollars each for five essays. He wrote back that he would supply the\r\ndemand, but at a thousand dollars an essay. He remembered that all\r\nthese manuscripts had been refused by the very magazines that were now\r\nclamoring for them. And their refusals had been cold-blooded,\r\nautomatic, stereotyped. They had made him sweat, and now he intended to\r\nmake them sweat. _Burton\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine_ paid his price for five essays,\r\nand the remaining four, at the same rate, were snapped up by\r\n_Mackintosh\xe2\x80\x99s Monthly, The Northern Review_ being too poor to stand the\r\npace. Thus went out to the world \xe2\x80\x9cThe High Priests of Mystery,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nWonder-Dreamers,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Yardstick of the Ego,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPhilosophy of Illusion,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod and Clod,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cArt and Biology,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCritics and Test-tubes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStar-dust,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dignity of Usury,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to raise storms and rumblings\r\nand mutterings that were many a day in dying down.\r\n\r\nEditors wrote to him telling him to name his own terms, which he did,\r\nbut it was always for work performed. He refused resolutely to pledge\r\nhimself to any new thing. The thought of again setting pen to paper\r\nmaddened him. He had seen Brissenden torn to pieces by the crowd, and\r\ndespite the fact that him the crowd acclaimed, he could not get over\r\nthe shock nor gather any respect for the crowd. His very popularity\r\nseemed a disgrace and a treason to Brissenden. It made him wince, but\r\nhe made up his mind to go on and fill the money-bag.\r\n\r\nHe received letters from editors like the following: \xe2\x80\x9cAbout a year ago\r\nwe were unfortunate enough to refuse your collection of love-poems. We\r\nwere greatly impressed by them at the time, but certain arrangements\r\nalready entered into prevented our taking them. If you still have them,\r\nand if you will be kind enough to forward them, we shall be glad to\r\npublish the entire collection on your own terms. We are also prepared\r\nto make a most advantageous offer for bringing them out in book-form.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin recollected his blank-verse tragedy, and sent it instead. He\r\nread it over before mailing, and was particularly impressed by its\r\nsophomoric amateurishness and general worthlessness. But he sent it;\r\nand it was published, to the everlasting regret of the editor. The\r\npublic was indignant and incredulous. It was too far a cry from Martin\r\nEden\xe2\x80\x99s high standard to that serious bosh. It was asserted that he had\r\nnever written it, that the magazine had faked it very clumsily, or that\r\nMartin Eden was emulating the elder Dumas and at the height of success\r\nwas hiring his writing done for him. But when he explained that the\r\ntragedy was an early effort of his literary childhood, and that the\r\nmagazine had refused to be happy unless it got it, a great laugh went\r\nup at the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s expense and a change in the editorship followed.\r\nThe tragedy was never brought out in book-form, though Martin pocketed\r\nthe advance royalties that had been paid.\r\n\r\n_Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s Weekly_ sent Martin a lengthy telegram, costing nearly three\r\nhundred dollars, offering him a thousand dollars an article for twenty\r\narticles. He was to travel over the United States, with all expenses\r\npaid, and select whatever topics interested him. The body of the\r\ntelegram was devoted to hypothetical topics in order to show him the\r\nfreedom of range that was to be his. The only restriction placed upon\r\nhim was that he must confine himself to the United States. Martin sent\r\nhis inability to accept and his regrets by wire \xe2\x80\x9ccollect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWiki-Wiki,\xe2\x80\x9d published in _Warren\xe2\x80\x99s Monthly_, was an instantaneous\r\nsuccess. It was brought out forward in a wide-margined, beautifully\r\ndecorated volume that struck the holiday trade and sold like wildfire.\r\nThe critics were unanimous in the belief that it would take its place\r\nwith those two classics by two great writers, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bottle Imp\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nMagic Skin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe public, however, received the \xe2\x80\x9cSmoke of Joy\xe2\x80\x9d collection rather\r\ndubiously and coldly. The audacity and unconventionality of the\r\nstoriettes was a shock to bourgeois morality and prejudice; but when\r\nParis went mad over the immediate translation that was made, the\r\nAmerican and English reading public followed suit and bought so many\r\ncopies that Martin compelled the conservative house of Singletree,\r\nDarnley & Co. to pay a flat royalty of twenty-five per cent for a third\r\nbook, and thirty per cent flat for a fourth. These two volumes\r\ncomprised all the short stories he had written and which had received,\r\nor were receiving, serial publication. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ring of Bells\xe2\x80\x9d and his\r\nhorror stories constituted one collection; the other collection was\r\ncomposed of \xe2\x80\x9cAdventure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pot,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wine of Life,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nWhirlpool,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jostling Street,\xe2\x80\x9d and four other stories. The\r\nLowell-Meredith Company captured the collection of all his essays, and\r\nthe Maxmillian Company got his \xe2\x80\x9cSea Lyrics\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cLove-cycle,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nlatter receiving serial publication in the _Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Home Companion_\r\nafter the payment of an extortionate price.\r\n\r\nMartin heaved a sigh of relief when he had disposed of the last\r\nmanuscript. The grass-walled castle and the white, coppered schooner\r\nwere very near to him. Well, at any rate he had discovered Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontention that nothing of merit found its way into the magazines. His\r\nown success demonstrated that Brissenden had been wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, somehow, he had a feeling that Brissenden had been right,\r\nafter all. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun\xe2\x80\x9d had been the cause of his success\r\nmore than the stuff he had written. That stuff had been merely\r\nincidental. It had been rejected right and left by the magazines. The\r\npublication of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun\xe2\x80\x9d had started a controversy and\r\nprecipitated the landslide in his favor. Had there been no \xe2\x80\x9cShame of\r\nthe Sun\xe2\x80\x9d there would have been no landslide, and had there been no\r\nmiracle in the go of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the Sun\xe2\x80\x9d there would have been no\r\nlandslide. Singletree, Darnley & Co. attested that miracle. They had\r\nbrought out a first edition of fifteen hundred copies and been dubious\r\nof selling it. They were experienced publishers and no one had been\r\nmore astounded than they at the success which had followed. To them it\r\nhad been in truth a miracle. They never got over it, and every letter\r\nthey wrote him reflected their reverent awe of that first mysterious\r\nhappening. They did not attempt to explain it. There was no explaining\r\nit. It had happened. In the face of all experience to the contrary, it\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nSo it was, reasoning thus, that Martin questioned the validity of his\r\npopularity. It was the bourgeoisie that bought his books and poured its\r\ngold into his money-sack, and from what little he knew of the\r\nbourgeoisie it was not clear to him how it could possibly appreciate or\r\ncomprehend what he had written. His intrinsic beauty and power meant\r\nnothing to the hundreds of thousands who were acclaiming him and buying\r\nhis books. He was the fad of the hour, the adventurer who had stormed\r\nParnassus while the gods nodded. The hundreds of thousands read him and\r\nacclaimed him with the same brute non-understanding with which they had\r\nflung themselves on Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEphemera\xe2\x80\x9d and torn it to pieces\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nwolf-rabble that fawned on him instead of fanging him. Fawn or fang, it\r\nwas all a matter of chance. One thing he knew with absolute certitude:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEphemera\xe2\x80\x9d was infinitely greater than anything he had done. It was\r\ninfinitely greater than anything he had in him. It was a poem of\r\ncenturies. Then the tribute the mob paid him was a sorry tribute\r\nindeed, for that same mob had wallowed \xe2\x80\x9cEphemera\xe2\x80\x9d into the mire. He\r\nsighed heavily and with satisfaction. He was glad the last manuscript\r\nwas sold and that he would soon be done with it all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Morse met Martin in the office of the Hotel Metropole. Whether he\r\nhad happened there just casually, intent on other affairs, or whether\r\nhe had come there for the direct purpose of inviting him to dinner,\r\nMartin never could quite make up his mind, though he inclined toward\r\nthe second hypothesis. At any rate, invited to dinner he was by Mr.\r\nMorse\xe2\x80\x94Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s father, who had forbidden him the house and broken off the\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nMartin was not angry. He was not even on his dignity. He tolerated Mr.\r\nMorse, wondering the while how it felt to eat such humble pie. He did\r\nnot decline the invitation. Instead, he put it off with vagueness and\r\nindefiniteness and inquired after the family, particularly after Mrs.\r\nMorse and Ruth. He spoke her name without hesitancy, naturally, though\r\nsecretly surprised that he had had no inward quiver, no old, familiar\r\nincrease of pulse and warm surge of blood.\r\n\r\nHe had many invitations to dinner, some of which he accepted. Persons\r\ngot themselves introduced to him in order to invite him to dinner. And\r\nhe went on puzzling over the little thing that was becoming a great\r\nthing. Bernard Higginbotham invited him to dinner. He puzzled the\r\nharder. He remembered the days of his desperate starvation when no one\r\ninvited him to dinner. That was the time he needed dinners, and went\r\nweak and faint for lack of them and lost weight from sheer famine. That\r\nwas the paradox of it. When he wanted dinners, no one gave them to him,\r\nand now that he could buy a hundred thousand dinners and was losing his\r\nappetite, dinners were thrust upon him right and left. But why? There\r\nwas no justice in it, no merit on his part. He was no different. All\r\nthe work he had done was even at that time work performed. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMorse had condemned him for an idler and a shirk and through Ruth had\r\nurged that he take a clerk\xe2\x80\x99s position in an office. Furthermore, they\r\nhad been aware of his work performed. Manuscript after manuscript of\r\nhis had been turned over to them by Ruth. They had read them. It was\r\nthe very same work that had put his name in all the papers, and, it was\r\nhis name being in all the papers that led them to invite him.\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain: the Morses had not cared to have him for himself\r\nor for his work. Therefore they could not want him now for himself or\r\nfor his work, but for the fame that was his, because he was somebody\r\namongst men, and\xe2\x80\x94why not?\xe2\x80\x94because he had a hundred thousand dollars or\r\nso. That was the way bourgeois society valued a man, and who was he to\r\nexpect it otherwise? But he was proud. He disdained such valuation. He\r\ndesired to be valued for himself, or for his work, which, after all,\r\nwas an expression of himself. That was the way Lizzie valued him. The\r\nwork, with her, did not even count. She valued him, himself. That was\r\nthe way Jimmy, the plumber, and all the old gang valued him. That had\r\nbeen proved often enough in the days when he ran with them; it had been\r\nproved that Sunday at Shell Mound Park. His work could go hang. What\r\nthey liked, and were willing to scrap for, was just Mart Eden, one of\r\nthe bunch and a pretty good guy.\r\n\r\nThen there was Ruth. She had liked him for himself, that was\r\nindisputable. And yet, much as she had liked him she had liked the\r\nbourgeois standard of valuation more. She had opposed his writing, and\r\nprincipally, it seemed to him, because it did not earn money. That had\r\nbeen her criticism of his \xe2\x80\x9cLove-cycle.\xe2\x80\x9d She, too, had urged him to get\r\na job. It was true, she refined it to \xe2\x80\x9cposition,\xe2\x80\x9d but it meant the same\r\nthing, and in his own mind the old nomenclature stuck. He had read her\r\nall that he wrote\xe2\x80\x94poems, stories, essays\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWiki-Wiki,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shame of the\r\nSun,\xe2\x80\x9d everything. And she had always and consistently urged him to get\r\na job, to go to work\xe2\x80\x94good God!\xe2\x80\x94as if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been working, robbing\r\nsleep, exhausting life, in order to be worthy of her.\r\n\r\nSo the little thing grew bigger. He was healthy and normal, ate\r\nregularly, slept long hours, and yet the growing little thing was\r\nbecoming an obsession. _Work performed_. The phrase haunted his brain.\r\nHe sat opposite Bernard Higginbotham at a heavy Sunday dinner over\r\nHigginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s Cash Store, and it was all he could do to restrain\r\nhimself from shouting out:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was work performed! And now you feed me, when then you let me\r\nstarve, forbade me your house, and damned me because I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a\r\njob. And the work was already done, all done. And now, when I speak,\r\nyou check the thought unuttered on your lips and hang on my lips and\r\npay respectful attention to whatever I choose to say. I tell you your\r\nparty is rotten and filled with grafters, and instead of flying into a\r\nrage you hum and haw and admit there is a great deal in what I say. And\r\nwhy? Because I\xe2\x80\x99m famous; because I\xe2\x80\x99ve a lot of money. Not because I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nMartin Eden, a pretty good fellow and not particularly a fool. I could\r\ntell you the moon is made of green cheese and you would subscribe to\r\nthe notion, at least you would not repudiate it, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\ndollars, mountains of them. And it was all done long ago; it was work\r\nperformed, I tell you, when you spat upon me as the dirt under your\r\nfeet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Martin did not shout out. The thought gnawed in his brain, an\r\nunceasing torment, while he smiled and succeeded in being tolerant. As\r\nhe grew silent, Bernard Higginbotham got the reins and did the talking.\r\nHe was a success himself, and proud of it. He was self-made. No one had\r\nhelped him. He owed no man. He was fulfilling his duty as a citizen and\r\nbringing up a large family. And there was Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s Cash Store,\r\nthat monument of his own industry and ability. He loved Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCash Store as some men loved their wives. He opened up his heart to\r\nMartin, showed with what keenness and with what enormous planning he\r\nhad made the store. And he had plans for it, ambitious plans. The\r\nneighborhood was growing up fast. The store was really too small. If he\r\nhad more room, he would be able to put in a score of labor-saving and\r\nmoney-saving improvements. And he would do it yet. He was straining\r\nevery effort for the day when he could buy the adjoining lot and put up\r\nanother two-story frame building. The upstairs he could rent, and the\r\nwhole ground-floor of both buildings would be Higginbotham\xe2\x80\x99s Cash\r\nStore. His eyes glistened when he spoke of the new sign that would\r\nstretch clear across both buildings.\r\n\r\nMartin forgot to listen. The refrain of \xe2\x80\x9cWork performed,\xe2\x80\x9d in his own\r\nbrain, was drowning the other\xe2\x80\x99s clatter. The refrain maddened him, and\r\nhe tried to escape from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much did you say it would cost?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nHis brother-in-law paused in the middle of an expatiation on the\r\nbusiness opportunities of the neighborhood. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said how much it\r\nwould cost. But he knew. He had figured it out a score of times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the way lumber is now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfour thousand could do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIncluding the sign?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t count on that. It\xe2\x80\x99d just have to come, onc\xe2\x80\x99t the buildin\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the ground?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree thousand more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward, licking his lips, nervously spreading and closing\r\nhis fingers, while he watched Martin write a check. When it was passed\r\nover to him, he glanced at the amount-seven thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to pay more than six per cent,\xe2\x80\x9d he said huskily.\r\n\r\nMartin wanted to laugh, but, instead, demanded:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much would that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLemme see. Six per cent\xe2\x80\x94six times seven\xe2\x80\x94four hundred an\xe2\x80\x99 twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be thirty-five dollars a month, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHigginbotham nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve no objection, we\xe2\x80\x99ll arrange it this way.\xe2\x80\x9d Martin\r\nglanced at Gertrude. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can have the principal to keep for yourself,\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ll use the thirty-five dollars a month for cooking and washing\r\nand scrubbing. The seven thousand is yours if you\xe2\x80\x99ll guarantee that\r\nGertrude does no more drudgery. Is it a go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Higginbotham swallowed hard. That his wife should do no more\r\nhousework was an affront to his thrifty soul. The magnificent present\r\nwas the coating of a pill, a bitter pill. That his wife should not\r\nwork! It gagged him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay the thirty-five a month,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reached across the table for the check. But Bernard Higginbotham got\r\nhis hand on it first, crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accept! I accept!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Martin got on the electric car, he was very sick and tired. He\r\nlooked up at the assertive sign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe swine,\xe2\x80\x9d he groaned. \xe2\x80\x9cThe swine, the swine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen _Mackintosh\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine_ published \xe2\x80\x9cThe Palmist,\xe2\x80\x9d featuring it with\r\ndecorations by Berthier and with two pictures by Wenn, Hermann von\r\nSchmidt forgot that he had called the verses obscene. He announced that\r\nhis wife had inspired the poem, saw to it that the news reached the\r\nears of a reporter, and submitted to an interview by a staff writer who\r\nwas accompanied by a staff photographer and a staff artist. The result\r\nwas a full page in a Sunday supplement, filled with photographs and\r\nidealized drawings of Marian, with many intimate details of Martin Eden\r\nand his family, and with the full text of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Palmist\xe2\x80\x9d in large type,\r\nand republished by special permission of _Mackintosh\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine_. It\r\ncaused quite a stir in the neighborhood, and good housewives were proud\r\nto have the acquaintances of the great writer\xe2\x80\x99s sister, while those who\r\nhad not made haste to cultivate it. Hermann von Schmidt chuckled in his\r\nlittle repair shop and decided to order a new lathe. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter than\r\nadvertising,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Marian, \xe2\x80\x9cand it costs nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d better have him to dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested.\r\n\r\nAnd to dinner Martin came, making himself agreeable with the fat\r\nwholesale butcher and his fatter wife\xe2\x80\x94important folk, they, likely to\r\nbe of use to a rising young man like Hermann von Schmidt. No less a\r\nbait, however, had been required to draw them to his house than his\r\ngreat brother-in-law. Another man at table who had swallowed the same\r\nbait was the superintendent of the Pacific Coast agencies for the Asa\r\nBicycle Company. Him Von Schmidt desired to please and propitiate\r\nbecause from him could be obtained the Oakland agency for the bicycle.\r\nSo Hermann von Schmidt found it a goodly asset to have Martin for a\r\nbrother-in-law, but in his heart of hearts he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand where\r\nit all came in. In the silent watches of the night, while his wife\r\nslept, he had floundered through Martin\xe2\x80\x99s books and poems, and decided\r\nthat the world was a fool to buy them.\r\n\r\nAnd in his heart of hearts Martin understood the situation only too\r\nwell, as he leaned back and gloated at Von Schmidt\xe2\x80\x99s head, in fancy\r\npunching it well-nigh off of him, sending blow after blow home just\r\nright\xe2\x80\x94the chuckle-headed Dutchman! One thing he did like about him,\r\nhowever. Poor as he was, and determined to rise as he was, he\r\nnevertheless hired one servant to take the heavy work off of Marian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. Martin talked with the superintendent of the Asa agencies, and\r\nafter dinner he drew him aside with Hermann, whom he backed financially\r\nfor the best bicycle store with fittings in Oakland. He went further,\r\nand in a private talk with Hermann told him to keep his eyes open for\r\nan automobile agency and garage, for there was no reason that he should\r\nnot be able to run both establishments successfully.\r\n\r\nWith tears in her eyes and her arms around his neck, Marian, at\r\nparting, told Martin how much she loved him and always had loved him.\r\nIt was true, there was a perceptible halt midway in her assertion,\r\nwhich she glossed over with more tears and kisses and incoherent\r\nstammerings, and which Martin inferred to be her appeal for forgiveness\r\nfor the time she had lacked faith in him and insisted on his getting a\r\njob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t never keep his money, that\xe2\x80\x99s sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Hermann von Schmidt\r\nconfided to his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cHe got mad when I spoke of interest, an\xe2\x80\x99 he said\r\ndamn the principal and if I mentioned it again, he\xe2\x80\x99d punch my Dutch\r\nhead off. That\xe2\x80\x99s what he said\xe2\x80\x94my Dutch head. But he\xe2\x80\x99s all right, even\r\nif he ain\xe2\x80\x99t no business man. He\xe2\x80\x99s given me my chance, an\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInvitations to dinner poured in on Martin; and the more they poured,\r\nthe more he puzzled. He sat, the guest of honor, at an Arden Club\r\nbanquet, with men of note whom he had heard about and read about all\r\nhis life; and they told him how, when they had read \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ring of Bells\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin the _Transcontinental_, and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Peri and the Pearl\xe2\x80\x9d in _The\r\nHornet_, they had immediately picked him for a winner. My God! and I\r\nwas hungry and in rags, he thought to himself. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you give me a\r\ndinner then? Then was the time. It was work performed. If you are\r\nfeeding me now for work performed, why did you not feed me then when I\r\nneeded it? Not one word in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ring of Bells,\xe2\x80\x9d nor in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Peri and\r\nthe Pearl\xe2\x80\x9d has been changed. No; you\xe2\x80\x99re not feeding me now for work\r\nperformed. You are feeding me because everybody else is feeding me and\r\nbecause it is an honor to feed me. You are feeding me now because you\r\nare herd animals; because you are part of the mob; because the one\r\nblind, automatic thought in the mob-mind just now is to feed me. And\r\nwhere does Martin Eden and the work Martin Eden performed come in in\r\nall this? he asked himself plaintively, then arose to respond cleverly\r\nand wittily to a clever and witty toast.\r\n\r\nSo it went. Wherever he happened to be\xe2\x80\x94at the Press Club, at the\r\nRedwood Club, at pink teas and literary gatherings\xe2\x80\x94always were\r\nremembered \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ring of Bells\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Peri and the Pearl\xe2\x80\x9d when they\r\nwere first published. And always was Martin\xe2\x80\x99s maddening and unuttered\r\ndemand: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you feed me then? It was work performed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ring\r\nof Bells\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Peri and the Pearl\xe2\x80\x9d are not changed one iota. They\r\nwere just as artistic, just as worth while, then as now. But you are\r\nnot feeding me for their sake, nor for the sake of anything else I have\r\nwritten. You\xe2\x80\x99re feeding me because it is the style of feeding just now,\r\nbecause the whole mob is crazy with the idea of feeding Martin Eden.\r\n\r\nAnd often, at such times, he would abruptly see slouch in among the\r\ncompany a young hoodlum in square-cut coat and under a stiff-rim\r\nStetson hat. It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one\r\nafternoon. As he rose from his chair and stepped forward across the\r\nplatform, he saw stalk through the wide door at the rear of the great\r\nroom the young hoodlum with the square-cut coat and stiff-rim hat. Five\r\nhundred fashionably gowned women turned their heads, so intent and\r\nsteadfast was Martin\xe2\x80\x99s gaze, to see what he was seeing. But they saw\r\nonly the empty centre aisle. He saw the young tough lurching down that\r\naisle and wondered if he would remove the stiff-rim which never yet had\r\nhe seen him without. Straight down the aisle he came, and up the\r\nplatform. Martin could have wept over that youthful shade of himself,\r\nwhen he thought of all that lay before him. Across the platform he\r\nswaggered, right up to Martin, and into the foreground of Martin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsciousness disappeared. The five hundred women applauded softly with\r\ngloved hands, seeking to encourage the bashful great man who was their\r\nguest. And Martin shook the vision from his brain, smiled, and began to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent of Schools, good old man, stopped Martin on the\r\nstreet and remembered him, recalling seances in his office when Martin\r\nwas expelled from school for fighting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read your \xe2\x80\x98Ring of Bells\xe2\x80\x99 in one of the magazines quite a time ago,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was as good as Poe. Splendid, I said at the time,\r\nsplendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, and twice in the months that followed you passed me on the street\r\nand did not know me, Martin almost said aloud. Each time I was hungry\r\nand heading for the pawnbroker. Yet it was work performed. You did not\r\nknow me then. Why do you know me now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was remarking to my wife only the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d the other was saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be a good idea to have you out to dinner some time? And\r\nshe quite agreed with me. Yes, she quite agreed with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinner?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said so sharply that it was almost a snarl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, yes, dinner, you know\xe2\x80\x94just pot luck with us, with your old\r\nsuperintendent, you rascal,\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered nervously, poking Martin in an\r\nattempt at jocular fellowship.\r\n\r\nMartin went down the street in a daze. He stopped at the corner and\r\nlooked about him vacantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be damned!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured at last. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old fellow was afraid\r\nof me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\nKreis came to Martin one day\xe2\x80\x94Kreis, of the \xe2\x80\x9creal dirt\xe2\x80\x9d; and Martin\r\nturned to him with relief, to receive the glowing details of a scheme\r\nsufficiently wild-catty to interest him as a fictionist rather than an\r\ninvestor. Kreis paused long enough in the midst of his exposition to\r\ntell him that in most of his \xe2\x80\x9cShame of the Sun\xe2\x80\x9d he had been a chump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here to spout philosophy,\xe2\x80\x9d Kreis went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\r\nwant to know is whether or not you will put a thousand dollars in on\r\nthis deal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not chump enough for that, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I will do. You gave me the greatest night of my\r\nlife. You gave me what money cannot buy. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got money, and it\r\nmeans nothing to me. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to turn over to you a thousand dollars of\r\nwhat I don\xe2\x80\x99t value for what you gave me that night and which was beyond\r\nprice. You need the money. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got more than I need. You want it. You\r\ncame for it. There\xe2\x80\x99s no use scheming it out of me. Take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKreis betrayed no surprise. He folded the check away in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that rate I\xe2\x80\x99d like the contract of providing you with many such\r\nnights,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late.\xe2\x80\x9d Martin shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThat night was the one night for\r\nme. I was in paradise. It\xe2\x80\x99s commonplace with you, I know. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nto me. I shall never live at such a pitch again. I\xe2\x80\x99m done with\r\nphilosophy. I want never to hear another word of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first dollar I ever made in my life out of my philosophy,\xe2\x80\x9d Kreis\r\nremarked, as he paused in the doorway. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then the market broke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Morse drove by Martin on the street one day, and smiled and\r\nnodded. He smiled back and lifted his hat. The episode did not affect\r\nhim. A month before it might have disgusted him, or made him curious\r\nand set him to speculating about her state of consciousness at that\r\nmoment. But now it was not provocative of a second thought. He forgot\r\nabout it the next moment. He forgot about it as he would have forgotten\r\nthe Central Bank Building or the City Hall after having walked past\r\nthem. Yet his mind was preternaturally active. His thoughts went ever\r\naround and around in a circle. The centre of that circle was \xe2\x80\x9cwork\r\nperformed\xe2\x80\x9d; it ate at his brain like a deathless maggot. He awoke to it\r\nin the morning. It tormented his dreams at night. Every affair of life\r\naround him that penetrated through his senses immediately related\r\nitself to \xe2\x80\x9cwork performed.\xe2\x80\x9d He drove along the path of relentless logic\r\nto the conclusion that he was nobody, nothing. Mart Eden, the hoodlum,\r\nand Mart Eden, the sailor, had been real, had been he; but Martin Eden!\r\nthe famous writer, did not exist. Martin Eden, the famous writer, was a\r\nvapor that had arisen in the mob-mind and by the mob-mind had been\r\nthrust into the corporeal being of Mart Eden, the hoodlum and sailor.\r\nBut it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fool him. He was not that sun-myth that the mob was\r\nworshipping and sacrificing dinners to. He knew better.\r\n\r\nHe read the magazines about himself, and pored over portraits of\r\nhimself published therein until he was unable to associate his identity\r\nwith those portraits. He was the fellow who had lived and thrilled and\r\nloved; who had been easy-going and tolerant of the frailties of life;\r\nwho had served in the forecastle, wandered in strange lands, and led\r\nhis gang in the old fighting days. He was the fellow who had been\r\nstunned at first by the thousands of books in the free library, and who\r\nhad afterward learned his way among them and mastered them; he was the\r\nfellow who had burned the midnight oil and bedded with a spur and\r\nwritten books himself. But the one thing he was not was that colossal\r\nappetite that all the mob was bent upon feeding.\r\n\r\nThere were things, however, in the magazines that amused him. All the\r\nmagazines were claiming him. _Warren\xe2\x80\x99s Monthly_ advertised to its\r\nsubscribers that it was always on the quest after new writers, and\r\nthat, among others, it had introduced Martin Eden to the reading\r\npublic. _The White Mouse_ claimed him; so did _The Northern Review_ and\r\n_Mackintosh\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine_, until silenced by _The Globe_, which pointed\r\ntriumphantly to its files where the mangled \xe2\x80\x9cSea Lyrics\xe2\x80\x9d lay buried.\r\n_Youth and Age_, which had come to life again after having escaped\r\npaying its bills, put in a prior claim, which nobody but farmers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nchildren ever read. The _Transcontinental_ made a dignified and\r\nconvincing statement of how it first discovered Martin Eden, which was\r\nwarmly disputed by _The Hornet_, with the exhibit of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Peri and the\r\nPearl.\xe2\x80\x9d The modest claim of Singletree, Darnley & Co. was lost in the\r\ndin. Besides, that publishing firm did not own a magazine wherewith to\r\nmake its claim less modest.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers calculated Martin\xe2\x80\x99s royalties. In some way the\r\nmagnificent offers certain magazines had made him leaked out, and\r\nOakland ministers called upon him in a friendly way, while professional\r\nbegging letters began to clutter his mail. But worse than all this were\r\nthe women. His photographs were published broadcast, and special\r\nwriters exploited his strong, bronzed face, his scars, his heavy\r\nshoulders, his clear, quiet eyes, and the slight hollows in his cheeks\r\nlike an ascetic\xe2\x80\x99s. At this last he remembered his wild youth and\r\nsmiled. Often, among the women he met, he would see now one, now\r\nanother, looking at him, appraising him, selecting him. He laughed to\r\nhimself. He remembered Brissenden\xe2\x80\x99s warning and laughed again. The\r\nwomen would never destroy him, that much was certain. He had gone past\r\nthat stage.\r\n\r\nOnce, walking with Lizzie toward night school, she caught a glance\r\ndirected toward him by a well-gowned, handsome woman of the\r\nbourgeoisie. The glance was a trifle too long, a shade too\r\nconsiderative. Lizzie knew it for what it was, and her body tensed\r\nangrily. Martin noticed, noticed the cause of it, told her how used he\r\nwas becoming to it and that he did not care anyway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to care,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered with blazing eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sick.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever healthier in my life. I weigh five pounds more than I ever did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t your body. It\xe2\x80\x99s your head. Something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with your\r\nthink-machine. Even I can see that, an\xe2\x80\x99 I ain\xe2\x80\x99t nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked on beside her, reflecting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give anything to see you get over it,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out impulsively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to care when women look at you that way, a man like you.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not natural. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right enough for sissy-boys. But you ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmade that way. So help me, I\xe2\x80\x99d be willing an\xe2\x80\x99 glad if the right woman\r\ncame along an\xe2\x80\x99 made you care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he left Lizzie at night school, he returned to the Metropole.\r\n\r\nOnce in his rooms, he dropped into a Morris chair and sat staring\r\nstraight before him. He did not doze. Nor did he think. His mind was a\r\nblank, save for the intervals when unsummoned memory pictures took form\r\nand color and radiance just under his eyelids. He saw these pictures,\r\nbut he was scarcely conscious of them\xe2\x80\x94no more so than if they had been\r\ndreams. Yet he was not asleep. Once, he roused himself and glanced at\r\nhis watch. It was just eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He had nothing to do, and it was\r\ntoo early for bed. Then his mind went blank again, and the pictures\r\nbegan to form and vanish under his eyelids. There was nothing\r\ndistinctive about the pictures. They were always masses of leaves and\r\nshrub-like branches shot through with hot sunshine.\r\n\r\nA knock at the door aroused him. He was not asleep, and his mind\r\nimmediately connected the knock with a telegram, or letter, or perhaps\r\none of the servants bringing back clean clothes from the laundry. He\r\nwas thinking about Joe and wondering where he was, as he said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was still thinking about Joe, and did not turn toward the door. He\r\nheard it close softly. There was a long silence. He forgot that there\r\nhad been a knock at the door, and was still staring blankly before him\r\nwhen he heard a woman\xe2\x80\x99s sob. It was involuntary, spasmodic, checked,\r\nand stifled\xe2\x80\x94he noted that as he turned about. The next instant he was\r\non his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, amazed and bewildered.\r\n\r\nHer face was white and strained. She stood just inside the door, one\r\nhand against it for support, the other pressed to her side. She\r\nextended both hands toward him piteously, and started forward to meet\r\nhim. As he caught her hands and led her to the Morris chair he noticed\r\nhow cold they were. He drew up another chair and sat down on the broad\r\narm of it. He was too confused to speak. In his own mind his affair\r\nwith Ruth was closed and sealed. He felt much in the same way that he\r\nwould have felt had the Shelly Hot Springs Laundry suddenly invaded the\r\nHotel Metropole with a whole week\xe2\x80\x99s washing ready for him to pitch\r\ninto. Several times he was about to speak, and each time he hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one knows I am here,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth said in a faint voice, with an appealing\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was surprised at the sound of his own voice.\r\n\r\nShe repeated her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, then wondered what more he could possibly say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw you come in, and I waited a few minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said again.\r\n\r\nHe had never been so tongue-tied in his life. Positively he did not\r\nhave an idea in his head. He felt stupid and awkward, but for the life\r\nof him he could think of nothing to say. It would have been easier had\r\nthe intrusion been the Shelly Hot Springs laundry. He could have rolled\r\nup his sleeves and gone to work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you came in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally.\r\n\r\nShe nodded, with a slightly arch expression, and loosened the scarf at\r\nher throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw you first from across the street when you were with that girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply. \xe2\x80\x9cI took her down to night school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said at the end of another\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it rash of you to come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slipped in. Nobody knows I am here. I wanted to see you. I came to\r\ntell you I have been very foolish. I came because I could no longer\r\nstay away, because my heart compelled me to come, because\xe2\x80\x94because I\r\nwanted to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe came forward, out of her chair and over to him. She rested her hand\r\non his shoulder a moment, breathing quickly, and then slipped into his\r\narms. And in his large, easy way, desirous of not inflicting hurt,\r\nknowing that to repulse this proffer of herself was to inflict the most\r\ngrievous hurt a woman could receive, he folded his arms around her and\r\nheld her close. But there was no warmth in the embrace, no caress in\r\nthe contact. She had come into his arms, and he held her, that was all.\r\nShe nestled against him, and then, with a change of position, her hands\r\ncrept up and rested upon his neck. But his flesh was not fire beneath\r\nthose hands, and he felt awkward and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you tremble so?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it a chill? Shall I light\r\nthe grate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made a movement to disengage himself, but she clung more closely to\r\nhim, shivering violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is merely nervousness,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with chattering teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncontrol myself in a minute. There, I am better already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly her shivering died away. He continued to hold her, but he was no\r\nlonger puzzled. He knew now for what she had come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother wanted me to marry Charley Hapgood,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharley Hapgood, that fellow who speaks always in platitudes?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin\r\ngroaned. Then he added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, I suppose, your mother wants you to\r\nmarry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not put it in the form of a question. He stated it as a\r\ncertitude, and before his eyes began to dance the rows of figures of\r\nhis royalties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will not object, I know that much,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe considers me quite eligible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I am not a bit more eligible now than I was when she broke our\r\nengagement,\xe2\x80\x9d he meditated. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed any. I\xe2\x80\x99m the same Martin\r\nEden, though for that matter I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit worse\xe2\x80\x94I smoke now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsmell my breath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn reply she pressed her open fingers against his lips, placed them\r\ngraciously and playfully, and in expectancy of the kiss that of old had\r\nalways been a consequence. But there was no caressing answer of\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s lips. He waited until the fingers were removed and then went\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not changed. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a job. I\xe2\x80\x99m not looking for a job.\r\nFurthermore, I am not going to look for a job. And I still believe that\r\nHerbert Spencer is a great and noble man and that Judge Blount is an\r\nunmitigated ass. I had dinner with him the other night, so I ought to\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t accept father\xe2\x80\x99s invitation,\xe2\x80\x9d she chided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you know about that? Who sent him? Your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she did send him. I thought so. And now I suppose she has sent\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one knows that I am here,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think my mother\r\nwould permit this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d permit you to marry me, that\xe2\x80\x99s certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a sharp cry. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Martin, don\xe2\x80\x99t be cruel. You have not kissed\r\nme once. You are as unresponsive as a stone. And think what I have\r\ndared to do.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked about her with a shiver, though half the look\r\nwas curiosity. \xe2\x80\x9cJust think of where I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I could die for you! I could die for you_!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s words were\r\nringing in his ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you dare it before?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked harshly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\njob? When I was starving? When I was just as I am now, as a man, as an\r\nartist, the same Martin Eden? That\xe2\x80\x99s the question I\xe2\x80\x99ve been propounding\r\nto myself for many a day\xe2\x80\x94not concerning you merely, but concerning\r\neverybody. You see I have not changed, though my sudden apparent\r\nappreciation in value compels me constantly to reassure myself on that\r\npoint. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the same flesh on my bones, the same ten fingers and\r\ntoes. I am the same. I have not developed any new strength nor virtue.\r\nMy brain is the same old brain. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made even one new\r\ngeneralization on literature or philosophy. I am personally of the same\r\nvalue that I was when nobody wanted me. And what is puzzling me is why\r\nthey want me now. Surely they don\xe2\x80\x99t want me for myself, for myself is\r\nthe same old self they did not want. Then they must want me for\r\nsomething else, for something that is outside of me, for something that\r\nis not I! Shall I tell you what that something is? It is for the\r\nrecognition I have received. That recognition is not I. It resides in\r\nthe minds of others. Then again for the money I have earned and am\r\nearning. But that money is not I. It resides in banks and in the\r\npockets of Tom, Dick, and Harry. And is it for that, for the\r\nrecognition and the money, that you now want me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are breaking my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I love you, that I\r\nam here because I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you don\xe2\x80\x99t see my point,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I mean is:\r\nif you love me, how does it happen that you love me now so much more\r\nthan you did when your love was weak enough to deny me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForget and forgive,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cI loved you all the\r\ntime, remember that, and I am here, now, in your arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I am a shrewd merchant, peering into the scales, trying to\r\nweigh your love and find out what manner of thing it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe withdrew herself from his arms, sat upright, and looked at him long\r\nand searchingly. She was about to speak, then faltered and changed her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, it appears this way to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was all that\r\nI am now, nobody out of my own class seemed to care for me. When my\r\nbooks were all written, no one who had read the manuscripts seemed to\r\ncare for them. In point of fact, because of the stuff I had written\r\nthey seemed to care even less for me. In writing the stuff it seemed\r\nthat I had committed acts that were, to say the least, derogatory. \xe2\x80\x98Get\r\na job,\xe2\x80\x99 everybody said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made a movement of dissent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cexcept in your case you told me to get a\r\nposition. The homely word _job_, like much that I have written, offends\r\nyou. It is brutal. But I assure you it was no less brutal to me when\r\neverybody I knew recommended it to me as they would recommend right\r\nconduct to an immoral creature. But to return. The publication of what\r\nI had written, and the public notice I received, wrought a change in\r\nthe fibre of your love. Martin Eden, with his work all performed, you\r\nwould not marry. Your love for him was not strong enough to enable you\r\nto marry him. But your love is now strong enough, and I cannot avoid\r\nthe conclusion that its strength arises from the publication and the\r\npublic notice. In your case I do not mention royalties, though I am\r\ncertain that they apply to the change wrought in your mother and\r\nfather. Of course, all this is not flattering to me. But worst of all,\r\nit makes me question love, sacred love. Is love so gross a thing that\r\nit must feed upon publication and public notice? It would seem so. I\r\nhave sat and thought upon it till my head went around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor, dear head.\xe2\x80\x9d She reached up a hand and passed the fingers\r\nsoothingly through his hair. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it go around no more. Let us begin\r\nanew, now. I loved you all the time. I know that I was weak in yielding\r\nto my mother\xe2\x80\x99s will. I should not have done so. Yet I have heard you\r\nspeak so often with broad charity of the fallibility and frailty of\r\nhumankind. Extend that charity to me. I acted mistakenly. Forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I do forgive,\xe2\x80\x9d he said impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is easy to forgive where\r\nthere is really nothing to forgive. Nothing that you have done requires\r\nforgiveness. One acts according to one\xe2\x80\x99s lights, and more than that one\r\ncannot do. As well might I ask you to forgive me for my not getting a\r\njob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant well,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that I could not have loved\r\nyou and not meant well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue; but you would have destroyed me out of your well-meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he shut off her attempted objection. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would have\r\ndestroyed my writing and my career. Realism is imperative to my nature,\r\nand the bourgeois spirit hates realism. The bourgeoisie is cowardly. It\r\nis afraid of life. And all your effort was to make me afraid of life.\r\nYou would have formalized me. You would have compressed me into a\r\ntwo-by-four pigeonhole of life, where all life\xe2\x80\x99s values are unreal, and\r\nfalse, and vulgar.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt her stir protestingly. \xe2\x80\x9cVulgarity\xe2\x80\x94a hearty\r\nvulgarity, I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit\xe2\x80\x94is the basis of bourgeois refinement and culture.\r\nAs I say, you wanted to formalize me, to make me over into one of your\r\nown class, with your class-ideals, class-values, and class-prejudices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe shook his head sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you do not understand, even now, what I\r\nam saying. My words do not mean to you what I endeavor to make them\r\nmean. What I say is so much fantasy to you. Yet to me it is vital\r\nreality. At the best you are a trifle puzzled and amused that this raw\r\nboy, crawling up out of the mire of the abyss, should pass judgment\r\nupon your class and call it vulgar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe leaned her head wearily against his shoulder, and her body shivered\r\nwith recurrent nervousness. He waited for a time for her to speak, and\r\nthen went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you want to renew our love. You want us to be married. You\r\nwant me. And yet, listen\xe2\x80\x94if my books had not been noticed, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnevertheless have been just what I am now. And you would have stayed\r\naway. It is all those damned books\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t swear,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted.\r\n\r\nHer reproof startled him. He broke into a harsh laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cat a high moment, when what seems your life\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappiness is at stake, you are afraid of life in the same old\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94afraid of life and a healthy oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was stung by his words into realization of the puerility of her\r\nact, and yet she felt that he had magnified it unduly and was\r\nconsequently resentful. They sat in silence for a long time, she\r\nthinking desperately and he pondering upon his love which had departed.\r\nHe knew, now, that he had not really loved her. It was an idealized\r\nRuth he had loved, an ethereal creature of his own creating, the bright\r\nand luminous spirit of his love-poems. The real bourgeois Ruth, with\r\nall the bourgeois failings and with the hopeless cramp of the bourgeois\r\npsychology in her mind, he had never loved.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly began to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that much you have said is so. I have been afraid of life. I\r\ndid not love you well enough. I have learned to love better. I love you\r\nfor what you are, for what you were, for the ways even by which you\r\nhave become. I love you for the ways wherein you differ from what you\r\ncall my class, for your beliefs which I do not understand but which I\r\nknow I can come to understand. I shall devote myself to understanding\r\nthem. And even your smoking and your swearing\xe2\x80\x94they are part of you and\r\nI will love you for them, too. I can still learn. In the last ten\r\nminutes I have learned much. That I have dared to come here is a token\r\nof what I have already learned. Oh, Martin!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was sobbing and nestling close against him.\r\n\r\nFor the first time his arms folded her gently and with sympathy, and\r\nshe acknowledged it with a happy movement and a brightening face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He remembered Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s words. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a sick\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94oh, not my body. It is my soul, my brain. I seem to have lost all\r\nvalues. I care for nothing. If you had been this way a few months ago,\r\nit would have been different. It is too late, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not too late,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI will show you. I will prove to you\r\nthat my love has grown, that it is greater to me than my class and all\r\nthat is dearest to me. All that is dearest to the bourgeoisie I will\r\nflout. I am no longer afraid of life. I will leave my father and\r\nmother, and let my name become a by-word with my friends. I will come\r\nto you here and now, in free love if you will, and I will be proud and\r\nglad to be with you. If I have been a traitor to love, I will now, for\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x99s sake, be a traitor to all that made that earlier treason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood before him, with shining eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting, Martin,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cwaiting for you to accept me.\r\nLook at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was splendid, he thought, looking at her. She had redeemed herself\r\nfor all that she had lacked, rising up at last, true woman, superior to\r\nthe iron rule of bourgeois convention. It was splendid, magnificent,\r\ndesperate. And yet, what was the matter with him? He was not thrilled\r\nnor stirred by what she had done. It was splendid and magnificent only\r\nintellectually. In what should have been a moment of fire, he coldly\r\nappraised her. His heart was untouched. He was unaware of any desire\r\nfor her. Again he remembered Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sick, very sick,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a despairing gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cHow sick I\r\ndid not know till now. Something has gone out of me. I have always been\r\nunafraid of life, but I never dreamed of being sated with life. Life\r\nhas so filled me that I am empty of any desire for anything. If there\r\nwere room, I should want you, now. You see how sick I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned his head back and closed his eyes; and like a child, crying,\r\nthat forgets its grief in watching the sunlight percolate through the\r\ntear-dimmed films over the pupils, so Martin forgot his sickness, the\r\npresence of Ruth, everything, in watching the masses of vegetation,\r\nshot through hotly with sunshine that took form and blazed against this\r\nbackground of his eyelids. It was not restful, that green foliage. The\r\nsunlight was too raw and glaring. It hurt him to look at it, and yet he\r\nlooked, he knew not why.\r\n\r\nHe was brought back to himself by the rattle of the door-knob. Ruth was\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I get out?\xe2\x80\x9d she questioned tearfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, springing to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not myself, you\r\nknow. I forgot you were here.\xe2\x80\x9d He put his hand to his head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not just right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you home. We can go out by the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nentrance. No one will see us. Pull down that veil and everything will\r\nbe all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clung to his arm through the dim-lighted passages and down the\r\nnarrow stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am safe now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when they emerged on the sidewalk, at the\r\nsame time starting to take her hand from his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you home,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, please don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she objected. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is unnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she started to remove her hand. He felt a momentary curiosity.\r\nNow that she was out of danger she was afraid. She was in almost a\r\npanic to be quit of him. He could see no reason for it and attributed\r\nit to her nervousness. So he restrained her withdrawing hand and\r\nstarted to walk on with her. Halfway down the block, he saw a man in a\r\nlong overcoat shrink back into a doorway. He shot a glance in as he\r\npassed by, and, despite the high turned-up collar, he was certain that\r\nhe recognized Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Norman.\r\n\r\nDuring the walk Ruth and Martin held little conversation. She was\r\nstunned. He was apathetic. Once, he mentioned that he was going away,\r\nback to the South Seas, and, once, she asked him to forgive her having\r\ncome to him. And that was all. The parting at her door was\r\nconventional. They shook hands, said good night, and he lifted his hat.\r\nThe door swung shut, and he lighted a cigarette and turned back for his\r\nhotel. When he came to the doorway into which he had seen Norman\r\nshrink, he stopped and looked in in a speculative humor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lied,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cShe made believe to me that she had dared\r\ngreatly, and all the while she knew the brother that brought her was\r\nwaiting to take her back.\xe2\x80\x9d He burst into laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, these\r\nbourgeois! When I was broke, I was not fit to be seen with his sister.\r\nWhen I have a bank account, he brings her to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he swung on his heel to go on, a tramp, going in the same direction,\r\nbegged him over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, mister, can you give me a quarter to get a bed?\xe2\x80\x9d were the words.\r\n\r\nBut it was the voice that made Martin turn around. The next instant he\r\nhad Joe by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye remember that time we parted at the Hot Springs?\xe2\x80\x9d the other was\r\nsaying. \xe2\x80\x9cI said then we\xe2\x80\x99d meet again. I felt it in my bones. An\xe2\x80\x99 here\r\nwe are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re looking good,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said admiringly, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99ve put on\r\nweight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sure have.\xe2\x80\x9d Joe\xe2\x80\x99s face was beaming. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew what it was to\r\nlive till I hit hoboin\xe2\x80\x99. I\xe2\x80\x99m thirty pounds heavier an\xe2\x80\x99 feel tiptop all\r\nthe time. Why, I was worked to skin an\xe2\x80\x99 bone in them old days. Hoboin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsure agrees with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a bed just the same,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin chided, \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na cold night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh? Lookin\xe2\x80\x99 for a bed?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe shot a hand into his hip pocket and\r\nbrought it out filled with small change. \xe2\x80\x9cThat beats hard graft,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexulted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just looked good; that\xe2\x80\x99s why I battered you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin laughed and gave in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve several full-sized drunks right there,\xe2\x80\x9d he insinuated.\r\n\r\nJoe slid the money back into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced. \xe2\x80\x9cNo gettin\xe2\x80\x99 oryide for me, though there\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t nothin\xe2\x80\x99 to stop me except I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. I\xe2\x80\x99ve ben drunk once\r\nsince I seen you last, an\xe2\x80\x99 then it was unexpected, bein\xe2\x80\x99 on an empty\r\nstomach. When I work like a beast, I drink like a beast. When I live\r\nlike a man, I drink like a man\xe2\x80\x94a jolt now an\xe2\x80\x99 again when I feel like\r\nit, an\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin arranged to meet him next day, and went on to the hotel. He\r\npaused in the office to look up steamer sailings. The _Mariposa_ sailed\r\nfor Tahiti in five days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTelephone over to-morrow and reserve a stateroom for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the\r\nclerk. \xe2\x80\x9cNo deck-stateroom, but down below, on the weather-side,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nport-side, remember that, the port-side. You\xe2\x80\x99d better write it down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce in his room he got into bed and slipped off to sleep as gently as\r\na child. The occurrences of the evening had made no impression on him.\r\nHis mind was dead to impressions. The glow of warmth with which he met\r\nJoe had been most fleeting. The succeeding minute he had been bothered\r\nby the ex-laundryman\xe2\x80\x99s presence and by the compulsion of conversation.\r\nThat in five more days he sailed for his loved South Seas meant nothing\r\nto him. So he closed his eyes and slept normally and comfortably for\r\neight uninterrupted hours. He was not restless. He did not change his\r\nposition, nor did he dream. Sleep had become to him oblivion, and each\r\nday that he awoke, he awoke with regret. Life worried and bored him,\r\nand time was a vexation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d was his greeting to his old-time working-mate next morning,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a Frenchman out on Twenty-eighth Street. He\xe2\x80\x99s made a pot of\r\nmoney, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going back to France. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dandy, well-appointed,\r\nsmall steam laundry. There\xe2\x80\x99s a start for you if you want to settle\r\ndown. Here, take this; buy some clothes with it and be at this man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice by ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He looked up the laundry for me, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nyou out and show you around. If you like it, and think it is worth the\r\nprice\xe2\x80\x94twelve thousand\xe2\x80\x94let me know and it is yours. Now run along. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nbusy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here, Mart,\xe2\x80\x9d the other said slowly, with kindling anger, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncome here this mornin\xe2\x80\x99 to see you. Savve? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here to get no\r\nlaundry. I come here for a talk for old friends\xe2\x80\x99 sake, and you shove a\r\nlaundry at me. I tell you what you can do. You can take that laundry\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 go to hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was out of the room when Martin caught him and whirled him around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cif you act that way, I\xe2\x80\x99ll punch your\r\nhead. And for old friends\xe2\x80\x99 sake I\xe2\x80\x99ll punch it hard. Savve?\xe2\x80\x94you will,\r\nwill you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe had clinched and attempted to throw him, and he was twisting and\r\nwrithing out of the advantage of the other\xe2\x80\x99s hold. They reeled about\r\nthe room, locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and came down with a crash\r\nacross the splintered wreckage of a wicker chair. Joe was underneath,\r\nwith arms spread out and held and with Martin\xe2\x80\x99s knee on his chest. He\r\nwas panting and gasping for breath when Martin released him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t get fresh with me. I\r\nwant that laundry business finished first of all. Then you can come\r\nback and we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk for old sake\xe2\x80\x99s sake. I told you I was busy. Look at\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA servant had just come in with the morning mail, a great mass of\r\nletters and magazines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I wade through that and talk with you? You go and fix up that\r\nlaundry, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe admitted reluctantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you was turnin\xe2\x80\x99 me\r\ndown, but I guess I was mistaken. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t lick me, Mart, in a\r\nstand-up fight. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the reach on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll put on the gloves sometime and see,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure; as soon as I get that laundry going.\xe2\x80\x9d Joe extended his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsee that reach? It\xe2\x80\x99ll make you go a few.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin heaved a sigh of relief when the door closed behind the\r\nlaundryman. He was becoming anti-social. Daily he found it a severer\r\nstrain to be decent with people. Their presence perturbed him, and the\r\neffort of conversation irritated him. They made him restless, and no\r\nsooner was he in contact with them than he was casting about for\r\nexcuses to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nHe did not proceed to attack his mail, and for a half hour he lolled in\r\nhis chair, doing nothing, while no more than vague, half-formed\r\nthoughts occasionally filtered through his intelligence, or rather, at\r\nwide intervals, themselves constituted the flickering of his\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nHe roused himself and began glancing through his mail. There were a\r\ndozen requests for autographs\xe2\x80\x94he knew them at sight; there were\r\nprofessional begging letters; and there were letters from cranks,\r\nranging from the man with a working model of perpetual motion, and the\r\nman who demonstrated that the surface of the earth was the inside of a\r\nhollow sphere, to the man seeking financial aid to purchase the\r\nPeninsula of Lower California for the purpose of communist\r\ncolonization. There were letters from women seeking to know him, and\r\nover one such he smiled, for enclosed was her receipt for pew-rent,\r\nsent as evidence of her good faith and as proof of her respectability.\r\n\r\nEditors and publishers contributed to the daily heap of letters, the\r\nformer on their knees for his manuscripts, the latter on their knees\r\nfor his books\xe2\x80\x94his poor disdained manuscripts that had kept all he\r\npossessed in pawn for so many dreary months in order to fund them in\r\npostage. There were unexpected checks for English serial rights and for\r\nadvance payments on foreign translations. His English agent announced\r\nthe sale of German translation rights in three of his books, and\r\ninformed him that Swedish editions, from which he could expect nothing\r\nbecause Sweden was not a party to the Berne Convention, were already on\r\nthe market. Then there was a nominal request for his permission for a\r\nRussian translation, that country being likewise outside the Berne\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the huge bundle of clippings which had come in from his\r\npress bureau, and read about himself and his vogue, which had become a\r\nfurore. All his creative output had been flung to the public in one\r\nmagnificent sweep. That seemed to account for it. He had taken the\r\npublic off its feet, the way Kipling had, that time when he lay near to\r\ndeath and all the mob, animated by a mob-mind thought, began suddenly\r\nto read him. Martin remembered how that same world-mob, having read him\r\nand acclaimed him and not understood him in the least, had, abruptly, a\r\nfew months later, flung itself upon him and torn him to pieces. Martin\r\ngrinned at the thought. Who was he that he should not be similarly\r\ntreated in a few more months? Well, he would fool the mob. He would be\r\naway, in the South Seas, building his grass house, trading for pearls\r\nand copra, jumping reefs in frail outriggers, catching sharks and\r\nbonitas, hunting wild goats among the cliffs of the valley that lay\r\nnext to the valley of Taiohae.\r\n\r\nIn the moment of that thought the desperateness of his situation dawned\r\nupon him. He saw, cleared eyed, that he was in the Valley of the\r\nShadow. All the life that was in him was fading, fainting, making\r\ntoward death.\r\n\r\nHe realized how much he slept, and how much he desired to sleep. Of\r\nold, he had hated sleep. It had robbed him of precious moments of\r\nliving. Four hours of sleep in the twenty-four had meant being robbed\r\nof four hours of life. How he had grudged sleep! Now it was life he\r\ngrudged. Life was not good; its taste in his mouth was without tang,\r\nand bitter. This was his peril. Life that did not yearn toward life was\r\nin fair way toward ceasing. Some remote instinct for preservation\r\nstirred in him, and he knew he must get away. He glanced about the\r\nroom, and the thought of packing was burdensome. Perhaps it would be\r\nbetter to leave that to the last. In the meantime he might be getting\r\nan outfit.\r\n\r\nHe put on his hat and went out, stopping in at a gun-store, where he\r\nspent the remainder of the morning buying automatic rifles, ammunition,\r\nand fishing tackle. Fashions changed in trading, and he knew he would\r\nhave to wait till he reached Tahiti before ordering his trade-goods.\r\nThey could come up from Australia, anyway. This solution was a source\r\nof pleasure. He had avoided doing something, and the doing of anything\r\njust now was unpleasant. He went back to the hotel gladly, with a\r\nfeeling of satisfaction in that the comfortable Morris chair was\r\nwaiting for him; and he groaned inwardly, on entering his room, at\r\nsight of Joe in the Morris chair.\r\n\r\nJoe was delighted with the laundry. Everything was settled, and he\r\nwould enter into possession next day. Martin lay on the bed, with\r\nclosed eyes, while the other talked on. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts were far\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94so far away that he was rarely aware that he was thinking. It was\r\nonly by an effort that he occasionally responded. And yet this was Joe,\r\nwhom he had always liked. But Joe was too keen with life. The\r\nboisterous impact of it on Martin\xe2\x80\x99s jaded mind was a hurt. It was an\r\naching probe to his tired sensitiveness. When Joe reminded him that\r\nsometime in the future they were going to put on the gloves together,\r\nhe could almost have screamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, Joe, you\xe2\x80\x99re to run the laundry according to those old rules\r\nyou used to lay down at Shelly Hot Springs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo overworking.\r\nNo working at night. And no children at the mangles. No children\r\nanywhere. And a fair wage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe nodded and pulled out a note-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at here. I was workin\xe2\x80\x99 out them rules before breakfast this A.M.\r\nWhat d\xe2\x80\x99ye think of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read them aloud, and Martin approved, worrying at the same time as\r\nto when Joe would take himself off.\r\n\r\nIt was late afternoon when he awoke. Slowly the fact of life came back\r\nto him. He glanced about the room. Joe had evidently stolen away after\r\nhe had dozed off. That was considerate of Joe, he thought. Then he\r\nclosed his eyes and slept again.\r\n\r\nIn the days that followed Joe was too busy organizing and taking hold\r\nof the laundry to bother him much; and it was not until the day before\r\nsailing that the newspapers made the announcement that he had taken\r\npassage on the _Mariposa_. Once, when the instinct of preservation\r\nfluttered, he went to a doctor and underwent a searching physical\r\nexamination. Nothing could be found the matter with him. His heart and\r\nlungs were pronounced magnificent. Every organ, so far as the doctor\r\ncould know, was normal and was working normally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing the matter with you, Mr. Eden,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cpositively\r\nnothing the matter with you. You are in the pink of condition.\r\nCandidly, I envy you your health. It is superb. Look at that chest.\r\nThere, and in your stomach, lies the secret of your remarkable\r\nconstitution. Physically, you are a man in a thousand\xe2\x80\x94in ten thousand.\r\nBarring accidents, you should live to be a hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Martin knew that Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s diagnosis had been correct. Physically he\r\nwas all right. It was his \xe2\x80\x9cthink-machine\xe2\x80\x9d that had gone wrong, and\r\nthere was no cure for that except to get away to the South Seas. The\r\ntrouble was that now, on the verge of departure, he had no desire to\r\ngo. The South Seas charmed him no more than did bourgeois civilization.\r\nThere was no zest in the thought of departure, while the act of\r\ndeparture appalled him as a weariness of the flesh. He would have felt\r\nbetter if he were already on board and gone.\r\n\r\nThe last day was a sore trial. Having read of his sailing in the\r\nmorning papers, Bernard Higginbotham, Gertrude, and all the family came\r\nto say good-by, as did Hermann von Schmidt and Marian. Then there was\r\nbusiness to be transacted, bills to be paid, and everlasting reporters\r\nto be endured. He said good-by to Lizzie Connolly, abruptly, at the\r\nentrance to night school, and hurried away. At the hotel he found Joe,\r\ntoo busy all day with the laundry to have come to him earlier. It was\r\nthe last straw, but Martin gripped the arms of his chair and talked and\r\nlistened for half an hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are not tied down to that laundry.\r\nThere are no strings on it. You can sell it any time and blow the\r\nmoney. Any time you get sick of it and want to hit the road, just pull\r\nout. Do what will make you the happiest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more road in mine, thank you kindly. Hoboin\xe2\x80\x99s all right, exceptin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfor one thing\xe2\x80\x94the girls. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a ladies\xe2\x80\x99 man. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get along without \xe2\x80\x99em, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get along without \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re hoboin\xe2\x80\x99. The times I\xe2\x80\x99ve passed by houses where dances an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nparties was goin\xe2\x80\x99 on, an\xe2\x80\x99 heard the women laugh, an\xe2\x80\x99 saw their white\r\ndresses and smiling faces through the windows\xe2\x80\x94Gee! I tell you them\r\nmoments was plain hell. I like dancin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 picnics, an\xe2\x80\x99 walking in the\r\nmoonlight, an\xe2\x80\x99 all the rest too well. Me for the laundry, and a good\r\nfront, with big iron dollars clinkin\xe2\x80\x99 in my jeans. I seen a girl\r\nalready, just yesterday, and, d\xe2\x80\x99ye know, I\xe2\x80\x99m feelin\xe2\x80\x99 already I\xe2\x80\x99d just\r\nas soon marry her as not. I\xe2\x80\x99ve ben whistlin\xe2\x80\x99 all day at the thought of\r\nit. She\xe2\x80\x99s a beaut, with the kindest eyes and softest voice you ever\r\nheard. Me for her, you can stack on that. Say, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you get\r\nmarried with all this money to burn? You could get the finest girl in\r\nthe land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMartin shook his head with a smile, but in his secret heart he was\r\nwondering why any man wanted to marry. It seemed an amazing and\r\nincomprehensible thing.\r\n\r\nFrom the deck of the _Mariposa_, at the sailing hour, he saw Lizzie\r\nConnolly hiding in the skirts of the crowd on the wharf. Take her with\r\nyou, came the thought. It is easy to be kind. She will be supremely\r\nhappy. It was almost a temptation one moment, and the succeeding moment\r\nit became a terror. He was in a panic at the thought of it. His tired\r\nsoul cried out in protest. He turned away from the rail with a groan,\r\nmuttering, \xe2\x80\x9cMan, you are too sick, you are too sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fled to his stateroom, where he lurked until the steamer was clear\r\nof the dock. In the dining saloon, at luncheon, he found himself in the\r\nplace of honor, at the captain\xe2\x80\x99s right; and he was not long in\r\ndiscovering that he was the great man on board. But no more\r\nunsatisfactory great man ever sailed on a ship. He spent the afternoon\r\nin a deck-chair, with closed eyes, dozing brokenly most of the time,\r\nand in the evening went early to bed.\r\n\r\nAfter the second day, recovered from seasickness, the full passenger\r\nlist was in evidence, and the more he saw of the passengers the more he\r\ndisliked them. Yet he knew that he did them injustice. They were good\r\nand kindly people, he forced himself to acknowledge, and in the moment\r\nof acknowledgment he qualified\xe2\x80\x94good and kindly like all the\r\nbourgeoisie, with all the psychological cramp and intellectual futility\r\nof their kind, they bored him when they talked with him, their little\r\nsuperficial minds were so filled with emptiness; while the boisterous\r\nhigh spirits and the excessive energy of the younger people shocked\r\nhim. They were never quiet, ceaselessly playing deck-quoits, tossing\r\nrings, promenading, or rushing to the rail with loud cries to watch the\r\nleaping porpoises and the first schools of flying fish.\r\n\r\nHe slept much. After breakfast he sought his deck-chair with a magazine\r\nhe never finished. The printed pages tired him. He puzzled that men\r\nfound so much to write about, and, puzzling, dozed in his chair. When\r\nthe gong awoke him for luncheon, he was irritated that he must awaken.\r\nThere was no satisfaction in being awake.\r\n\r\nOnce, he tried to arouse himself from his lethargy, and went forward\r\ninto the forecastle with the sailors. But the breed of sailors seemed\r\nto have changed since the days he had lived in the forecastle. He could\r\nfind no kinship with these stolid-faced, ox-minded bestial creatures.\r\nHe was in despair. Up above nobody had wanted Martin Eden for his own\r\nsake, and he could not go back to those of his own class who had wanted\r\nhim in the past. He did not want them. He could not stand them any more\r\nthan he could stand the stupid first-cabin passengers and the riotous\r\nyoung people.\r\n\r\nLife was to him like strong, white light that hurts the tired eyes of a\r\nsick person. During every conscious moment life blazed in a raw glare\r\naround him and upon him. It hurt. It hurt intolerably. It was the first\r\ntime in his life that Martin had travelled first class. On ships at sea\r\nhe had always been in the forecastle, the steerage, or in the black\r\ndepths of the coal-hold, passing coal. In those days, climbing up the\r\niron ladders out the pit of stifling heat, he had often caught glimpses\r\nof the passengers, in cool white, doing nothing but enjoy themselves,\r\nunder awnings spread to keep the sun and wind away from them, with\r\nsubservient stewards taking care of their every want and whim, and it\r\nhad seemed to him that the realm in which they moved and had their\r\nbeing was nothing else than paradise. Well, here he was, the great man\r\non board, in the midmost centre of it, sitting at the captain\xe2\x80\x99s right\r\nhand, and yet vainly harking back to forecastle and stoke-hole in quest\r\nof the Paradise he had lost. He had found no new one, and now he could\r\nnot find the old one.\r\n\r\nHe strove to stir himself and find something to interest him. He\r\nventured the petty officers\xe2\x80\x99 mess, and was glad to get away. He talked\r\nwith a quartermaster off duty, an intelligent man who promptly prodded\r\nhim with the socialist propaganda and forced into his hands a bunch of\r\nleaflets and pamphlets. He listened to the man expounding the\r\nslave-morality, and as he listened, he thought languidly of his own\r\nNietzsche philosophy. But what was it worth, after all? He remembered\r\none of Nietzsche\xe2\x80\x99s mad utterances wherein that madman had doubted\r\ntruth. And who was to say? Perhaps Nietzsche had been right. Perhaps\r\nthere was no truth in anything, no truth in truth\xe2\x80\x94no such thing as\r\ntruth. But his mind wearied quickly, and he was content to go back to\r\nhis chair and doze.\r\n\r\nMiserable as he was on the steamer, a new misery came upon him. What\r\nwhen the steamer reached Tahiti? He would have to go ashore. He would\r\nhave to order his trade-goods, to find a passage on a schooner to the\r\nMarquesas, to do a thousand and one things that were awful to\r\ncontemplate. Whenever he steeled himself deliberately to think, he\r\ncould see the desperate peril in which he stood. In all truth, he was\r\nin the Valley of the Shadow, and his danger lay in that he was not\r\nafraid. If he were only afraid, he would make toward life. Being\r\nunafraid, he was drifting deeper into the shadow. He found no delight\r\nin the old familiar things of life. The _Mariposa_ was now in the\r\nnortheast trades, and this wine of wind, surging against him, irritated\r\nhim. He had his chair moved to escape the embrace of this lusty comrade\r\nof old days and nights.\r\n\r\nThe day the _Mariposa_ entered the doldrums, Martin was more miserable\r\nthan ever. He could no longer sleep. He was soaked with sleep, and\r\nperforce he must now stay awake and endure the white glare of life. He\r\nmoved about restlessly. The air was sticky and humid, and the\r\nrain-squalls were unrefreshing. He ached with life. He walked around\r\nthe deck until that hurt too much, then sat in his chair until he was\r\ncompelled to walk again. He forced himself at last to finish the\r\nmagazine, and from the steamer library he culled several volumes of\r\npoetry. But they could not hold him, and once more he took to walking.\r\n\r\nHe stayed late on deck, after dinner, but that did not help him, for\r\nwhen he went below, he could not sleep. This surcease from life had\r\nfailed him. It was too much. He turned on the electric light and tried\r\nto read. One of the volumes was a Swinburne. He lay in bed, glancing\r\nthrough its pages, until suddenly he became aware that he was reading\r\nwith interest. He finished the stanza, attempted to read on, then came\r\nback to it. He rested the book face downward on his breast and fell to\r\nthinking. That was it. The very thing. Strange that it had never come\r\nto him before. That was the meaning of it all; he had been drifting\r\nthat way all the time, and now Swinburne showed him that it was the\r\nhappy way out. He wanted rest, and here was rest awaiting him. He\r\nglanced at the open port-hole. Yes, it was large enough. For the first\r\ntime in weeks he felt happy. At last he had discovered the cure of his\r\nill. He picked up the book and read the stanza slowly aloud:-\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98From too much love of living,\r\n    From hope and fear set free,\r\nWe thank with brief thanksgiving\r\n    Whatever gods may be\r\nThat no life lives forever;\r\nThat dead men rise up never;\r\n    That even the weariest river\r\n    Winds somewhere safe to sea.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe looked again at the open port. Swinburne had furnished the key. Life\r\nwas ill, or, rather, it had become ill\xe2\x80\x94an unbearable thing. \xe2\x80\x9cThat dead\r\nmen rise up never!\xe2\x80\x9d That line stirred him with a profound feeling of\r\ngratitude. It was the one beneficent thing in the universe. When life\r\nbecame an aching weariness, death was ready to soothe away to\r\neverlasting sleep. But what was he waiting for? It was time to go.\r\n\r\nHe arose and thrust his head out the port-hole, looking down into the\r\nmilky wash. The _Mariposa_ was deeply loaded, and, hanging by his\r\nhands, his feet would be in the water. He could slip in noiselessly. No\r\none would hear. A smother of spray dashed up, wetting his face. It\r\ntasted salt on his lips, and the taste was good. He wondered if he\r\nought to write a swan-song, but laughed the thought away. There was no\r\ntime. He was too impatient to be gone.\r\n\r\nTurning off the light in his room so that it might not betray him, he\r\nwent out the port-hole feet first. His shoulders stuck, and he forced\r\nhimself back so as to try it with one arm down by his side. A roll of\r\nthe steamer aided him, and he was through, hanging by his hands. When\r\nhis feet touched the sea, he let go. He was in a milky froth of water.\r\nThe side of the _Mariposa_ rushed past him like a dark wall, broken\r\nhere and there by lighted ports. She was certainly making time. Almost\r\nbefore he knew it, he was astern, swimming gently on the foam-crackling\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nA bonita struck at his white body, and he laughed aloud. It had taken a\r\npiece out, and the sting of it reminded him of why he was there. In the\r\nwork to do he had forgotten the purpose of it. The lights of the\r\n_Mariposa_ were growing dim in the distance, and there he was, swimming\r\nconfidently, as though it were his intention to make for the nearest\r\nland a thousand miles or so away.\r\n\r\nIt was the automatic instinct to live. He ceased swimming, but the\r\nmoment he felt the water rising above his mouth the hands struck out\r\nsharply with a lifting movement. The will to live, was his thought, and\r\nthe thought was accompanied by a sneer. Well, he had will,\xe2\x80\x94ay, will\r\nstrong enough that with one last exertion it could destroy itself and\r\ncease to be.\r\n\r\nHe changed his position to a vertical one. He glanced up at the quiet\r\nstars, at the same time emptying his lungs of air. With swift, vigorous\r\npropulsion of hands and feet, he lifted his shoulders and half his\r\nchest out of water. This was to gain impetus for the descent. Then he\r\nlet himself go and sank without movement, a white statue, into the sea.\r\nHe breathed in the water deeply, deliberately, after the manner of a\r\nman taking an anaesthetic. When he strangled, quite involuntarily his\r\narms and legs clawed the water and drove him up to the surface and into\r\nthe clear sight of the stars.\r\n\r\nThe will to live, he thought disdainfully, vainly endeavoring not to\r\nbreathe the air into his bursting lungs. Well, he would have to try a\r\nnew way. He filled his lungs with air, filled them full. This supply\r\nwould take him far down. He turned over and went down head first,\r\nswimming with all his strength and all his will. Deeper and deeper he\r\nwent. His eyes were open, and he watched the ghostly, phosphorescent\r\ntrails of the darting bonita. As he swam, he hoped that they would not\r\nstrike at him, for it might snap the tension of his will. But they did\r\nnot strike, and he found time to be grateful for this last kindness of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nDown, down, he swam till his arms and legs grew tired and hardly moved.\r\nHe knew that he was deep. The pressure on his ear-drums was a pain, and\r\nthere was a buzzing in his head. His endurance was faltering, but he\r\ncompelled his arms and legs to drive him deeper until his will snapped\r\nand the air drove from his lungs in a great explosive rush. The bubbles\r\nrubbed and bounded like tiny balloons against his cheeks and eyes as\r\nthey took their upward flight. Then came pain and strangulation. This\r\nhurt was not death, was the thought that oscillated through his reeling\r\nconsciousness. Death did not hurt. It was life, the pangs of life, this\r\nawful, suffocating feeling; it was the last blow life could deal him.\r\n\r\nHis wilful hands and feet began to beat and churn about, spasmodically\r\nand feebly. But he had fooled them and the will to live that made them\r\nbeat and churn. He was too deep down. They could never bring him to the\r\nsurface. He seemed floating languidly in a sea of dreamy vision. Colors\r\nand radiances surrounded him and bathed him and pervaded him. What was\r\nthat? It seemed a lighthouse; but it was inside his brain\xe2\x80\x94a flashing,\r\nbright white light. It flashed swifter and swifter. There was a long\r\nrumble of sound, and it seemed to him that he was falling down a vast\r\nand interminable stairway. And somewhere at the bottom he fell into\r\ndarkness. That much he knew. He had fallen into darkness. And at the\r\ninstant he knew, he ceased to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MARTIN EDEN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1056-0.txt or 1056-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/5/1056/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
