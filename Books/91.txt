I\r\nmean the adventures we had down the river, and the time we set the\r\ndarky Jim free and Tom got shot in the leg. No, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. It only just\r\np\xe2\x80\x99isoned him for more. That was all the effect it had. You see, when we\r\nthree came back up the river in glory, as you may say, from that long\r\ntravel, and the village received us with a torchlight procession and\r\nspeeches, and everybody hurrah\xe2\x80\x99d and shouted, it made us heroes, and\r\nthat was what Tom Sawyer had always been hankering to be.\r\n\r\nFor a while he _was_ satisfied. Everybody made much of him, and he\r\ntilted up his nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it.\r\nSome called him Tom Sawyer the Traveler, and that just swelled him up\r\nfit to bust. You see he laid over me and Jim considerable, because we\r\nonly went down the river on a raft and came back by the steamboat, but\r\nTom went by the steamboat both ways. The boys envied me and Jim a good\r\ndeal, but land! they just knuckled to the dirt before TOM.\r\n\r\nWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; maybe he might have been satisfied if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen for old Nat Parsons, which was postmaster, and powerful long and\r\nslim, and kind o\xe2\x80\x99 good-hearted and silly, and bald-headed, on account\r\nof his age, and about the talkiest old cretur I ever see. For as much\r\nas thirty years he\xe2\x80\x99d been the only man in the village that had a\r\nreputation\xe2\x80\x94I mean a reputation for being a traveler, and of course he\r\nwas mortal proud of it, and it was reckoned that in the course of that\r\nthirty years he had told about that journey over a million times and\r\nenjoyed it every time. And now comes along a boy not quite fifteen, and\r\nsets everybody admiring and gawking over _his_ travels, and it just\r\ngive the poor old man the high strikes. It made him sick to listen to\r\nTom, and to hear the people say \xe2\x80\x9cMy land!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy goodness\r\nsakes alive!\xe2\x80\x9d and all such things; but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pull away from it,\r\nany more than a fly that\xe2\x80\x99s got its hind leg fast in the molasses. And\r\nalways when Tom come to a rest, the poor old cretur would chip in on\r\n_his_ same old travels and work them for all they were worth; but they\r\nwere pretty faded, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t go for much, and it was pitiful to see.\r\nAnd then Tom would take another innings, and then the old man again\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nso on, and so on, for an hour and more, each trying to beat out the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nYou see, Parsons\xe2\x80\x99 travels happened like this: When he first got to be\r\npostmaster and was green in the business, there come a letter for\r\nsomebody he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any such person in the\r\nvillage. Well, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do, nor how to act, and there the\r\nletter stayed and stayed, week in and week out, till the bare sight of\r\nit gave him a conniption. The postage wasn\xe2\x80\x99t paid on it, and that was\r\nanother thing to worry about. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any way to collect that ten\r\ncents, and he reckon\xe2\x80\x99d the gov\xe2\x80\x99ment would hold him responsible for it\r\nand maybe turn him out besides, when they found he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t collected it.\r\nWell, at last he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it any longer. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep\r\nnights, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat, he was thinned down to a shadder, yet he\r\nda\xe2\x80\x99sn\xe2\x80\x99t ask anybody\xe2\x80\x99s advice, for the very person he asked for advice\r\nmight go back on him and let the gov\xe2\x80\x99ment know about the letter. He had\r\nthe letter buried under the floor, but that did no good; if he happened\r\nto see a person standing over the place it\xe2\x80\x99d give him the cold shivers,\r\nand loaded him up with suspicions, and he would sit up that night till\r\nthe town was still and dark, and then he would sneak there and get it\r\nout and bury it in another place. Of course, people got to avoiding him\r\nand shaking their heads and whispering, because, the way he was looking\r\nand acting, they judged he had killed somebody or done something\r\nterrible, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what, and if he had been a stranger they\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x99ve lynched him.\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying, it got so he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it any longer; so he\r\nmade up his mind to pull out for Washington, and just go to the\r\nPresident of the United States and make a clean breast of the whole\r\nthing, not keeping back an atom, and then fetch the letter out and lay\r\nit before the whole gov\xe2\x80\x99ment, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, there she is\xe2\x80\x94do with me\r\nwhat you\xe2\x80\x99re a mind to; though as heaven is my judge I am an innocent\r\nman and not deserving of the full penalties of the law and leaving\r\nbehind me a family that must starve and yet hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a thing to do\r\nwith it, which is the whole truth and I can swear to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he did it. He had a little wee bit of steamboating, and some\r\nstage-coaching, but all the rest of the way was horseback, and it took\r\nhim three weeks to get to Washington. He saw lots of land and lots of\r\nvillages and four cities. He was gone \xe2\x80\x99most eight weeks, and there\r\nnever was such a proud man in the village as he when he got back. His\r\ntravels made him the greatest man in all that region, and the most\r\ntalked about; and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the\r\ncountry, and from over in the Illinois bottoms, too, just to look at\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94and there they\xe2\x80\x99d stand and gawk, and he\xe2\x80\x99d gabble. You never see\r\nanything like it.\r\n\r\nWell, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any way now to settle which was the greatest\r\ntraveler; some said it was Nat, some said it was Tom. Everybody allowed\r\nthat Nat had seen the most longitude, but they had to give in that\r\nwhatever Tom was short in longitude he had made up in latitude and\r\nclimate. It was about a stand-off; so both of them had to whoop up\r\ntheir dangerous adventures, and try to get ahead _that_ way. That\r\nbullet-wound in Tom\xe2\x80\x99s leg was a tough thing for Nat Parsons to buck\r\nagainst, but he bucked the best he could; and at a disadvantage, too,\r\nfor Tom didn\xe2\x80\x99t set still as he\xe2\x80\x99d orter done, to be fair, but always got\r\nup and sauntered around and worked his limp while Nat was painting up\r\nthe adventure that _he_ had in Washington; for Tom never let go that\r\nlimp when his leg got well, but practiced it nights at home, and kept\r\nit good as new right along.\r\n\r\nNat\xe2\x80\x99s adventure was like this; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how true it is; maybe he\r\ngot it out of a paper, or somewhere, but I will say this for him, that\r\nhe _did_ know how to tell it. He could make anybody\xe2\x80\x99s flesh crawl, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d turn pale and hold his breath when he told it, and sometimes women\r\nand girls got so faint they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stick it out. Well, it was this\r\nway, as near as I can remember:\r\n\r\nHe come a-loping into Washington, and put up his horse and shoved out\r\nto the President\xe2\x80\x99s house with his letter, and they told him the\r\nPresident was up to the Capitol, and just going to start for\r\nPhiladelphia\xe2\x80\x94not a minute to lose if he wanted to catch him. Nat \xe2\x80\x99most\r\ndropped, it made him so sick. His horse was put up, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat to do. But just then along comes a darky driving an old ramshackly\r\nhack, and he see his chance. He rushes out and shouts: \xe2\x80\x9cA half a dollar\r\nif you git me to the Capitol in half an hour, and a quarter extra if\r\nyou do it in twenty minutes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone!\xe2\x80\x9d says the darky.\r\n\r\nNat he jumped in and slammed the door, and away they went a-ripping and\r\na-tearing over the roughest road a body ever see, and the racket of it\r\nwas something awful. Nat passed his arms through the loops and hung on\r\nfor life and death, but pretty soon the hack hit a rock and flew up in\r\nthe air, and the bottom fell out, and when it come down Nat\xe2\x80\x99s feet was\r\non the ground, and he see he was in the most desperate danger if he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep up with the hack. He was horrible scared, but he laid\r\ninto his work for all he was worth, and hung tight to the arm-loops and\r\nmade his legs fairly fly. He yelled and shouted to the driver to stop,\r\nand so did the crowds along the street, for they could see his legs\r\nspinning along under the coach, and his head and shoulders bobbing\r\ninside through the windows, and he was in awful danger; but the more\r\nthey all shouted the more the nigger whooped and yelled and lashed the\r\nhorses and shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you fret, I\xe2\x80\x99se gwine to git you dah in time,\r\nboss; I\xe2\x80\x99s gwine to do it, sho\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d for you see he thought they were all\r\nhurrying him up, and, of course, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything for the\r\nracket he was making. And so they went ripping along, and everybody\r\njust petrified to see it; and when they got to the Capitol at last it\r\nwas the quickest trip that ever was made, and everybody said so. The\r\nhorses laid down, and Nat dropped, all tuckered out, and he was all\r\ndust and rags and barefooted; but he was in time and just in time, and\r\ncaught the President and give him the letter, and everything was all\r\nright, and the President give him a free pardon on the spot, and Nat\r\ngive the nigger two extra quarters instead of one, because he could see\r\nthat if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had the hack he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 got there in time, nor\r\nanywhere near it.\r\n\r\nIt _was_ a powerful good adventure, and Tom Sawyer had to work his\r\nbullet-wound mighty lively to hold his own against it.\r\n\r\nWell, by and by Tom\xe2\x80\x99s glory got to paling down gradu\xe2\x80\x99ly, on account of\r\nother things turning up for the people to talk about\xe2\x80\x94first a\r\nhorse-race, and on top of that a house afire, and on top of that the\r\ncircus, and on top of that the eclipse; and that started a revival,\r\nsame as it always does, and by that time there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any more talk\r\nabout Tom, so to speak, and you never see a person so sick and\r\ndisgusted.\r\n\r\nPretty soon he got to worrying and fretting right along day in and day\r\nout, and when I asked him what _was_ he in such a state about, he said\r\nit \xe2\x80\x99most broke his heart to think how time was slipping away, and him\r\ngetting older and older, and no wars breaking out and no way of making\r\na name for himself that he could see. Now that is the way boys is\r\nalways thinking, but he was the first one I ever heard come out and say\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo then he set to work to get up a plan to make him celebrated; and\r\npretty soon he struck it, and offered to take me and Jim in. Tom Sawyer\r\nwas always free and generous that way. There\xe2\x80\x99s a-plenty of boys that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmighty good and friendly when _you\xe2\x80\x99ve_ got a good thing, but when a\r\ngood thing happens to come their way they don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word to you, and\r\ntry to hog it all. That warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x99s way, I can say that\r\nfor him. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of boys that will come hankering and groveling\r\naround you when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got an apple and beg the core off of you; but\r\nwhen they\xe2\x80\x99ve got one, and you beg for the core and remind them how you\r\ngive them a core one time, they say thank you \xe2\x80\x99most to death, but there\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to be no core. But I notice they always git come up with;\r\nall you got to do is to wait.\r\n\r\nWell, we went out in the woods on the hill, and Tom told us what it\r\nwas. It was a crusade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cWe went out in the woods on the hill, and Tom told us\r\nwhat it was. It was a crusade.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a crusade?\xe2\x80\x9d I says.\r\n\r\nHe looked scornful, the way he\xe2\x80\x99s always done when he was ashamed of a\r\nperson, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck Finn, do you mean to tell me you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a crusade is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to, nuther. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived till\r\nnow and done without it, and had my health, too. But as soon as you\r\ntell me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll know, and that\xe2\x80\x99s soon enough. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any use in\r\nfinding out things and clogging up my head with them when I mayn\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nhave any occasion to use \xe2\x80\x99em. There was Lance Williams, he learned how\r\nto talk Choctaw here till one come and dug his grave for him. Now,\r\nthen, what\xe2\x80\x99s a crusade? But I can tell you one thing before you begin;\r\nif it\xe2\x80\x99s a patent-right, there\xe2\x80\x99s no money in it. Bill Thompson he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatent-right!\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cI never see such an idiot. Why, a crusade is\r\na kind of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought he must be losing his mind. But no, he was in real earnest,\r\nand went right on, perfectly ca\xe2\x80\x99m.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA crusade is a war to recover the Holy Land from the paynim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich Holy Land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the Holy Land\xe2\x80\x94there ain\xe2\x80\x99t but one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we want of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, can\xe2\x80\x99t you understand? It\xe2\x80\x99s in the hands of the paynim, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nour duty to take it away from them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did we come to let them git hold of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to let them git hold of it. They always had it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom, then it must belong to them, don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy of course it does. Who said it didn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI studied over it, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to git at the right of it, no way.\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too many for me, Tom Sawyer. If I had a farm and it was mine, and\r\nanother person wanted it, would it be right for him to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shucks! you don\xe2\x80\x99t know enough to come in when it rains, Huck Finn.\r\nIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t a farm, it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely different. You see, it\xe2\x80\x99s like this. They\r\nown the land, just the mere land, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all they _do_ own; but it\r\nwas our folks, our Jews and Christians, that made it holy, and so they\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t any business to be there defiling it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, and we\r\nought not to stand it a minute. We ought to march against them and take\r\nit away from them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it does seem to me it\xe2\x80\x99s the most mixed-up thing I ever see! Now,\r\nif I had a farm and another person\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got anything to do with farming? Farming is\r\nbusiness, just common low-down business: that\xe2\x80\x99s all it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s all you\r\ncan say for it; but this is higher, this is religious, and totally\r\ndifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReligious to go and take the land away from people that owns it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; it\xe2\x80\x99s always been considered so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim he shook his head, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, I reckon dey\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake about it somers\xe2\x80\x94dey mos\xe2\x80\x99 sholy is.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99s religious myself, en I knows plenty religious people, but I hain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrun across none dat acts like dat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made Tom hot, and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to make a body sick, such mullet-headed ignorance!\r\nIf either of you\xe2\x80\x99d read anything about history, you\xe2\x80\x99d know that Richard\r\nCur de Loon, and the Pope, and Godfrey de Bulleyn, and lots more of the\r\nmost noble-hearted and pious people in the world, hacked and hammered\r\nat the paynims for more than two hundred years trying to take their\r\nland away from them, and swum neck-deep in blood the whole time\xe2\x80\x94and yet\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of sap-headed country yahoos out in the backwoods of\r\nMissouri setting themselves up to know more about the rights and wrongs\r\nof it than they did! Talk about cheek!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, of course, that put a more different light on it, and me and Jim\r\nfelt pretty cheap and ignorant, and wished we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been quite so\r\nchipper. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing, and Jim he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t for a while; then\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, den, I reckon it\xe2\x80\x99s all right; beca\xe2\x80\x99se ef dey didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, dey\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t no use for po\xe2\x80\x99 ignorant folks like us to be trying to know; en\r\nso, ef it\xe2\x80\x99s our duty, we got to go en tackle it en do de bes\xe2\x80\x99 we can.\r\nSame time, I feel as sorry for dem paynims as Mars Tom. De hard part\r\ngwine to be to kill folks dat a body hain\xe2\x80\x99t been \xe2\x80\x99quainted wid and dat\r\nhain\xe2\x80\x99t done him no harm. Dat\xe2\x80\x99s it, you see. Ef we wuz to go \xe2\x80\x99mongst\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, jist we three, en say we\xe2\x80\x99s hungry, en ast \xe2\x80\x99em for a bite to eat,\r\nwhy, maybe dey\xe2\x80\x99s jist like yuther people. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you reckon dey is? Why,\r\n_dey\xe2\x80\x99d_ give it, I know dey would, en den\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mars Tom, my idea is like dis. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use, we _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ kill\r\ndem po\xe2\x80\x99 strangers dat ain\xe2\x80\x99t doin\xe2\x80\x99 us no harm, till we\xe2\x80\x99ve had practice\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknows it perfectly well, Mars Tom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99deed I knows it perfectly well. But\r\nef we takes a\xe2\x80\x99 axe or two, jist you en me en Huck, en slips acrost de\r\nriver to-night arter de moon\xe2\x80\x99s gone down, en kills dat sick fam\xe2\x80\x99ly\r\ndat\xe2\x80\x99s over on the Sny, en burns dey house down, en\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you make me tired!\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to argue any more with\r\npeople like you and Huck Finn, that\xe2\x80\x99s always wandering from the\r\nsubject, and ain\xe2\x80\x99t got any more sense than to try to reason out a thing\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s pure theology by the laws that protect real estate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow that\xe2\x80\x99s just where Tom Sawyer warn\xe2\x80\x99t fair. Jim didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean no harm,\r\nand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean no harm. We knowed well enough that he was right and\r\nwe was wrong, and all we was after was to get at the _how_ of it, and\r\nthat was all; and the only reason he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain it so we could\r\nunderstand it was because we was ignorant\xe2\x80\x94yes, and pretty dull, too, I\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t denying that; but, land! that ain\xe2\x80\x99t no crime, I should think.\r\n\r\nBut he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear no more about it\xe2\x80\x94just said if we had tackled the\r\nthing in the proper spirit, he would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 raised a couple of thousand\r\nknights and put them in steel armor from head to heel, and made me a\r\nlieutenant and Jim a sutler, and took the command himself and brushed\r\nthe whole paynim outfit into the sea like flies and come back across\r\nthe world in a glory like sunset. But he said we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know enough to\r\ntake the chance when we had it, and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever offer it again.\r\nAnd he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. When he once got set, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t budge him.\r\n\r\nBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care much. I am peaceable, and don\xe2\x80\x99t get up rows with\r\npeople that ain\xe2\x80\x99t doing nothing to me. I allowed if the paynim was\r\nsatisfied I was, and we would let it stand at that.\r\n\r\nNow Tom he got all that notion out of Walter Scott\xe2\x80\x99s book, which he was\r\nalways reading. And it _was_ a wild notion, because in my opinion he\r\nnever could\xe2\x80\x99ve raised the men, and if he did, as like as not he\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x99ve got licked. I took the book and read all about it, and as near\r\nas I could make it out, most of the folks that shook farming to go\r\ncrusading had a mighty rocky time of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTHE BALLOON ASCENSION\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, Tom got up one thing after another, but they all had tender spots\r\nabout \xe2\x80\x99em somewheres, and he had to shove \xe2\x80\x99em aside. So at last he was\r\nabout in despair. Then the St. Louis papers begun to talk a good deal\r\nabout the balloon that was going to sail to Europe, and Tom sort of\r\nthought he wanted to go down and see what it looked like, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake up his mind. But the papers went on talking, and so he allowed\r\nthat maybe if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t ever have another chance to see\r\na balloon; and next, he found out that Nat Parsons was going down to\r\nsee it, and that decided him, of course. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to have Nat\r\nParsons coming back bragging about seeing the balloon, and him having\r\nto listen to it and keep quiet. So he wanted me and Jim to go too, and\r\nwe went.\r\n\r\nIt was a noble big balloon, and had wings and fans and all sorts of\r\nthings, and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like any balloon you see in pictures. It was away\r\nout toward the edge of town, in a vacant lot, corner of Twelfth street;\r\nand there was a big crowd around it, making fun of it, and making fun\r\nof the man,\xe2\x80\x94a lean pale feller with that soft kind of moonlight in his\r\neyes, you know,\xe2\x80\x94and they kept saying it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go. It made him hot to\r\nhear them, and he would turn on them and shake his fist and say they\r\nwas animals and blind, but some day they would find they had stood face\r\nto face with one of the men that lifts up nations and makes\r\ncivilizations, and was too dull to know it; and right here on this spot\r\ntheir own children and grandchildren would build a monument to him that\r\nwould outlast a thousand years, but his name would outlast the\r\nmonument. And then the crowd would burst out in a laugh again, and yell\r\nat him, and ask him what was his name before he was married, and what\r\nhe would take to not do it, and what was his sister\xe2\x80\x99s cat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrandmother\xe2\x80\x99s name, and all the things that a crowd says when they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot hold of a feller that they see they can plague. Well, some things\r\nthey said _was_ funny,\xe2\x80\x94yes, and mighty witty too, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t denying\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x94but all the same it warn\xe2\x80\x99t fair nor brave, all them people\r\npitching on one, and they so glib and sharp, and him without any gift\r\nof talk to answer back with. But, good land! what did he want to sass\r\nback for? You see, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do him no good, and it was just nuts for\r\nthem. They _had_ him, you know. But that was his way. I reckon he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it; he was made so, I judge. He was a good enough sort of\r\ncretur, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t no harm in him, and was just a genius, as the papers\r\nsaid, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his fault. We can\xe2\x80\x99t all be sound: we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be\r\nthe way we\xe2\x80\x99re made. As near as I can make out, geniuses think they know\r\nit all, and so they won\xe2\x80\x99t take people\xe2\x80\x99s advice, but always go their own\r\nway, which makes everybody forsake them and despise them, and that is\r\nperfectly natural. If they was humbler, and listened and tried to\r\nlearn, it would be better for them.\r\n\r\nThe part the professor was in was like a boat, and was big and roomy,\r\nand had water-tight lockers around the inside to keep all sorts of\r\nthings in, and a body could sit on them, and make beds on them, too. We\r\nwent aboard, and there was twenty people there, snooping around and\r\nexamining, and old Nat Parsons was there, too. The professor kept\r\nfussing around getting ready, and the people went ashore, drifting out\r\none at a time, and old Nat he was the last. Of course it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to\r\nlet him go out behind _us_. We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t budge till he was gone, so we\r\ncould be last ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut he was gone now, so it was time for us to follow. I heard a big\r\nshout, and turned around\xe2\x80\x94the city was dropping from under us like a\r\nshot! It made me sick all through, I was so scared. Jim turned gray and\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word, and Tom didn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing, but looked excited.\r\nThe city went on dropping down, and down, and down; but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\nto be doing nothing but just hang in the air and stand still. The\r\nhouses got smaller and smaller, and the city pulled itself together,\r\ncloser and closer, and the men and wagons got to looking like ants and\r\nbugs crawling around, and the streets like threads and cracks; and then\r\nit all kind of melted together, and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any city any more it\r\nwas only a big scar on the earth, and it seemed to me a body could see\r\nup the river and down the river about a thousand miles, though of\r\ncourse it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much. By and by the earth was a ball\xe2\x80\x94just a round\r\nball, of a dull color, with shiny stripes wriggling and winding around\r\nover it, which was rivers. The Widder Douglas always told me the earth\r\nwas round like a ball, but I never took any stock in a lot of them\r\nsuperstitions o\xe2\x80\x99 hers, and of course I paid no attention to that one,\r\nbecause I could see myself that the world was the shape of a plate, and\r\nflat. I used to go up on the hill, and take a look around and prove it\r\nfor myself, because I reckon the best way to get a sure thing on a fact\r\nis to go and examine for yourself, and not take anybody\xe2\x80\x99s say-so. But I\r\nhad to give in now that the widder was right. That is, she was right as\r\nto the rest of the world, but she warn\xe2\x80\x99t right about the part our\r\nvillage is in; that part is the shape of a plate, and flat, I take my\r\noath!\r\n\r\nThe professor had been quiet all this time, as if he was asleep; but he\r\nbroke loose now, and he was mighty bitter. He says something like this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIdiots! They said it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go; and they wanted to examine it, and\r\nspy around and get the secret of it out of me. But I beat them. Nobody\r\nknows the secret but me. Nobody knows what makes it move but me; and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a new power\xe2\x80\x94a new power, and a thousand times the strongest in the\r\nearth! Steam\xe2\x80\x99s foolishness to it! They said I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Europe. To\r\nEurope! Why, there\xe2\x80\x99s power aboard to last five years, and feed for\r\nthree months. They are fools! What do they know about it? Yes, and they\r\nsaid my air-ship was flimsy. Why, she\xe2\x80\x99s good for fifty years! I can\r\nsail the skies all my life if I want to, and steer where I please,\r\nthough they laughed at that, and said I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t steer! Come\r\nhere, boy; we\xe2\x80\x99ll see. You press these buttons as I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made Tom steer the ship all about and every which way, and learnt\r\nhim the whole thing in nearly no time; and Tom said it was perfectly\r\neasy. He made him fetch the ship down \xe2\x80\x99most to the earth, and had him\r\nspin her along so close to the Illinois prairies that a body could talk\r\nto the farmers, and hear everything they said perfectly plain; and he\r\nflung out printed bills to them that told about the balloon, and said\r\nit was going to Europe. Tom got so he could steer straight for a tree\r\ntill he got nearly to it, and then dart up and skin right along over\r\nthe top of it. Yes, and he showed Tom how to land her; and he done it\r\nfirst-rate, too, and set her down in the prairies as soft as wool. But\r\nthe minute we started to skip out the professor says, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand shot her up in the air again. It was awful. I begun to beg, and so\r\ndid Jim; but it only give his temper a rise, and he begun to rage\r\naround and look wild out of his eyes, and I was scared of him.\r\n\r\nWell, then he got on to his troubles again, and mourned and grumbled\r\nabout the way he was treated, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to git over it, and\r\nespecially people\xe2\x80\x99s saying his ship was flimsy. He scoffed at that, and\r\nat their saying she warn\xe2\x80\x99t simple and would be always getting out of\r\norder. Get out of order! That graveled him; he said that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nany more get out of order than the solar sister.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he would sail his balloon around the world\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nHe got worse and worse, and I never see a person take on so. It give me\r\nthe cold shivers to see him, and so it did Jim. By and by he got to\r\nyelling and screaming, and then he swore the world shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever have\r\nhis secret at all now, it had treated him so mean. He said he would\r\nsail his balloon around the globe just to show what he could do, and\r\nthen he would sink it in the sea, and sink us all along with it, too.\r\nWell, it was the awfulest fix to be in, and here was night coming on!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here was night coming on!\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nHe give us something to eat, and made us go to the other end of the\r\nboat, and he laid down on a locker, where he could boss all the works,\r\nand put his old pepper-box revolver under his head, and said if anybody\r\ncome fooling around there trying to land her, he would kill him.\r\n\r\nWe set scrunched up together, and thought considerable, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94only just a word once in a while when a body had to say something\r\nor bust, we was so scared and worried. The night dragged along slow and\r\nlonesome. We was pretty low down, and the moonshine made everything\r\nsoft and pretty, and the farmhouses looked snug and homeful, and we\r\ncould hear the farm sounds, and wished we could be down there; but,\r\nlaws! we just slipped along over them like a ghost, and never left a\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\nAway in the night, when all the sounds was late sounds, and the air had\r\na late feel, and a late smell, too\xe2\x80\x94about a two-o\xe2\x80\x99clock feel, as near as\r\nI could make out\xe2\x80\x94Tom said the professor was so quiet this time he must\r\nbe asleep, and we\xe2\x80\x99d better\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter what?\xe2\x80\x9d I says in a whisper, and feeling sick all over, because\r\nI knowed what he was thinking about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter slip back there and tie him, and land the ship,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\r\nI says: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir! Don\xe2\x80\x99 you budge, Tom Sawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Jim\xe2\x80\x94well, Jim was kind o\xe2\x80\x99 gasping, he was so scared. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mars Tom, _don\xe2\x80\x99t!_ Ef you teches him, we\xe2\x80\x99s gone\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99s gone sho\xe2\x80\x99! I\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t gwine anear him, not for nothin\xe2\x80\x99 in dis worl\xe2\x80\x99. Mars Tom, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplumb crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom whispers and says\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s _why_ we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do something. If he\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t crazy I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give shucks to be anywhere but here; you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hire me to get out\xe2\x80\x94now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got used to this balloon and\r\nover the scare of being cut loose from the solid ground\xe2\x80\x94if he was in\r\nhis right mind. But it\xe2\x80\x99s no good politics, sailing around like this\r\nwith a person that\xe2\x80\x99s out of his head, and says he\xe2\x80\x99s going round the\r\nworld and then drown us all. We\xe2\x80\x99ve _got_ to do something, I tell you,\r\nand do it before he wakes up, too, or we mayn\xe2\x80\x99t ever get another\r\nchance. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it made us turn cold and creepy just to think of it, and we said we\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t budge. So Tom was for slipping back there by himself to see if\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get at the steering-gear and land the ship. We begged and\r\nbegged him not to, but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use; so he got down on his hands\r\nand knees, and begun to crawl an inch at a time, we a-holding our\r\nbreath and watching. After he got to the middle of the boat he crept\r\nslower than ever, and it did seem like years to me. But at last we see\r\nhim get to the professor\xe2\x80\x99s head, and sort of raise up soft and look a\r\ngood spell in his face and listen. Then we see him begin to inch along\r\nagain toward the professor\xe2\x80\x99s feet where the steering-buttons was. Well,\r\nhe got there all safe, and was reaching slow and steady toward the\r\nbuttons, but he knocked down something that made a noise, and we see\r\nhim slump down flat an\xe2\x80\x99 soft in the bottom, and lay still. The\r\nprofessor stirred, and says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d But everybody kept dead\r\nstill and quiet, and he begun to mutter and mumble and nestle, like a\r\nperson that\xe2\x80\x99s going to wake up, and I thought I was going to die, I was\r\nso worried and scared.\r\n\r\nThen a cloud slid over the moon, and I \xe2\x80\x99most cried, I was so glad. She\r\nburied herself deeper and deeper into the cloud, and it got so dark we\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see Tom. Then it began to sprinkle rain, and we could hear the\r\nprofessor fussing at his ropes and things and abusing the weather. We\r\nwas afraid every minute he would touch Tom, and then we would be\r\ngoners, and no help; but Tom was already on his way back, and when we\r\nfelt his hands on our knees my breath stopped sudden, and my heart fell\r\ndown \xe2\x80\x99mongst my other works, because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell in the dark but it\r\nmight be the professor! which I thought it _was_.\r\n\r\nDear! I was so glad to have him back that I was just as near happy as a\r\nperson could be that was up in the air that way with a deranged man.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t land a balloon in the dark, and so I hoped it would keep on\r\nraining, for I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want Tom to go meddling any more and make us so\r\nawful uncomfortable. Well, I got my wish. It drizzled and drizzled\r\nalong the rest of the night, which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long, though it did seem so;\r\nand at daybreak it cleared, and the world looked mighty soft and gray\r\nand pretty, and the forests and fields so good to see again, and the\r\nhorses and cattle standing sober and thinking. Next, the sun come\r\na-blazing up gay and splendid, and then we began to feel rusty and\r\nstretchy, and first we knowed we was all asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTOM EXPLAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went to sleep about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and woke up about eight. The\r\nprofessor was setting back there at his end, looking glum. He pitched\r\nus some breakfast, but he told us not to come abaft the midship\r\ncompass. That was about the middle of the boat. Well, when you are\r\nsharp-set, and you eat and satisfy yourself, everything looks pretty\r\ndifferent from what it done before. It makes a body feel pretty near\r\ncomfortable, even when he is up in a balloon with a genius. We got to\r\ntalking together.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing that kept bothering me, and by and by I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we start east?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fast have we been going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you heard what the professor said when he was raging round.\r\nSometimes, he said, we was making fifty miles an hour, sometimes\r\nninety, sometimes a hundred; said that with a gale to help he could\r\nmake three hundred any time, and said if he wanted the gale, and wanted\r\nit blowing the right direction, he only had to go up higher or down\r\nlower to find it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, it\xe2\x80\x99s just as I reckoned. The professor lied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause if we was going so fast we ought to be past Illinois, oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the reason we ain\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know by the color. We\xe2\x80\x99re right over Illinois yet. And you can see\r\nfor yourself that Indiana ain\xe2\x80\x99t in sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you, Huck. You know by the _color?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the color got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s got everything to do with it. Illinois is green, Indiana is pink.\r\nYou show me any pink down here, if you can. No, sir; it\xe2\x80\x99s green.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndiana _pink?_ Why, what a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t no lie; I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it on the map, and it\xe2\x80\x99s pink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou never see a person so aggravated and disgusted. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I was such a numbskull as you, Huck Finn, I would jump over.\r\nSeen it on the map! Huck Finn, did you reckon the States was the same\r\ncolor out-of-doors as they are on the map?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer, what\xe2\x80\x99s a map for? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it to learn you facts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, how\xe2\x80\x99s it going to do that if it tells lies? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nwant to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks, you muggins! It don\xe2\x80\x99t tell lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then; if it don\xe2\x80\x99t, there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no two States the same\r\ncolor. You git around _that_ if you can, Tom Sawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe see I had him, and Jim see it too; and I tell you, I felt pretty\r\ngood, for Tom Sawyer was always a hard person to git ahead of. Jim\r\nslapped his leg and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell _you!_ dat\xe2\x80\x99s smart, dat\xe2\x80\x99s right down smart. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use, Mars\r\nTom; he got you _dis_ time, sho\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d He slapped his leg again, and says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy _lan_\xe2\x80\x99, but it was smart one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never felt so good in my life; and yet I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was saying\r\nanything much till it was out. I was just mooning along, perfectly\r\ncareless, and not expecting anything was going to happen, and never\r\n_thinking_ of such a thing at all, when, all of a sudden, out it came.\r\nWhy, it was just as much a surprise to me as it was to any of them. It\r\nwas just the same way it is when a person is munching along on a hunk\r\nof corn-pone, and not thinking about anything, and all of a sudden\r\nbites into a di\xe2\x80\x99mond. Now all that _he_ knows first off is that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsome kind of gravel he\xe2\x80\x99s bit into; but he don\xe2\x80\x99t find out it\xe2\x80\x99s a di\xe2\x80\x99mond\r\ntill he gits it out and brushes off the sand and crumbs and one thing\r\nor another, and has a look at it, and then he\xe2\x80\x99s surprised and glad\xe2\x80\x94yes,\r\nand proud too; though when you come to look the thing straight in the\r\neye, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t entitled to as much credit as he would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been if he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen _hunting_ di\xe2\x80\x99monds. You can see the difference easy if you think\r\nit over. You see, an accident, that way, ain\xe2\x80\x99t fairly as big a thing as\r\na thing that\xe2\x80\x99s done a-purpose. Anybody could find that di\xe2\x80\x99mond in that\r\ncorn-pone; but mind you, it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be somebody that\xe2\x80\x99s got _that kind\r\nof a corn-pone_. That\xe2\x80\x99s where that feller\xe2\x80\x99s credit comes in, you see;\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s where mine comes in. I don\xe2\x80\x99t claim no great things\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreckon I could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done it again\xe2\x80\x94but I done it that time; that\xe2\x80\x99s all I\r\nclaim. And I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t no more idea I could do such a thing, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nany more thinking about it or trying to, than you be this minute. Why,\r\nI was just as ca\xe2\x80\x99m, a body couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be any ca\xe2\x80\x99mer, and yet, all of a\r\nsudden, out it come. I\xe2\x80\x99ve often thought of that time, and I can\r\nremember just the way everything looked, same as if it was only last\r\nweek. I can see it all: beautiful rolling country with woods and fields\r\nand lakes for hundreds and hundreds of miles all around, and towns and\r\nvillages scattered everywheres under us, here and there and yonder; and\r\nthe professor mooning over a chart on his little table, and Tom\xe2\x80\x99s cap\r\nflopping in the rigging where it was hung up to dry. And one thing in\r\nparticular was a bird right alongside, not ten foot off, going our way\r\nand trying to keep up, but losing ground all the time; and a railroad\r\ntrain doing the same thing down there, sliding among the trees and\r\nfarms, and pouring out a long cloud of black smoke and now and then a\r\nlittle puff of white; and when the white was gone so long you had\r\nalmost forgot it, you would hear a little faint toot, and that was the\r\nwhistle. And we left the bird and the train both behind, \xe2\x80\x99_way_ behind,\r\nand done it easy, too.\r\n\r\nBut Tom he was huffy, and said me and Jim was a couple of ignorant\r\nblatherskites, and then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose there\xe2\x80\x99s a brown calf and a big brown dog, and an artist is\r\nmaking a picture of them. What is the _main_ thing that that artist has\r\ngot to do? He has got to paint them so you can tell them apart the\r\nminute you look at them, hain\xe2\x80\x99t he? Of course. Well, then, do you want\r\nhim to go and paint _both_ of them brown? Certainly you don\xe2\x80\x99t. He\r\npaints one of them blue, and then you can\xe2\x80\x99t make no mistake. It\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nthe same with the maps. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they make every State a different\r\ncolor; it ain\xe2\x80\x99t to deceive you, it\xe2\x80\x99s to keep you from deceiving\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no argument about that, and neither could Jim. Jim\r\nshook his head, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mars Tom, if you knowed what chuckle-heads dem painters is, you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwait a long time before you\xe2\x80\x99d fetch one er _dem_ in to back up a fac\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99s gwine to tell you, den you kin see for you\xe2\x80\x99self. I see one of \xe2\x80\x99em\r\na-paintin\xe2\x80\x99 away, one day, down in ole Hank Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s back lot, en I went\r\ndown to see, en he was paintin\xe2\x80\x99 dat old brindle cow wid de near horn\r\ngone\xe2\x80\x94you knows de one I means. En I ast him what he\xe2\x80\x99s paintin\xe2\x80\x99 her for,\r\nen he say when he git her painted, de picture\xe2\x80\x99s wuth a hundred dollars.\r\nMars Tom, he could a got de cow fer fifteen, en I tole him so. Well,\r\nsah, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll b\xe2\x80\x99lieve me, he jes\xe2\x80\x99 shuck his head, dat painter did, en\r\nwent on a-dobbin\xe2\x80\x99. Bless you, Mars Tom, _dey_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom lost his temper. I notice a person \xe2\x80\x99most always does that\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nlaid out in an argument. He told us to shut up, and maybe we\xe2\x80\x99d feel\r\nbetter. Then he see a town clock away off down yonder, and he took up\r\nthe glass and looked at it, and then looked at his silver turnip, and\r\nthen at the clock, and then at the turnip again, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s funny! That clock\xe2\x80\x99s near about an hour fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he put up his turnip. Then he see another clock, and took a look,\r\nand it was an hour fast too. That puzzled him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a mighty curious thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he took the glass and hunted up another clock, and sure enough it\r\nwas an hour fast too. Then his eyes began to spread and his breath to\r\ncome out kinder gaspy like, and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGer-reat Scott, it\xe2\x80\x99s the _longitude!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says, considerably scared:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s been and gone and happened now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s happened is that this old bladder has slid over\r\nIllinois and Indiana and Ohio like nothing, and this is the east end of\r\nPennsylvania or New York, or somewheres around there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do, and it\xe2\x80\x99s dead sure. We\xe2\x80\x99ve covered about fifteen degrees of\r\nlongitude since we left St. Louis yesterday afternoon, and them clocks\r\nare right. We\xe2\x80\x99ve come close on to eight hundred miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, but it made the cold streaks trickle down my back\r\njust the same. In my experience I knowed it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take much short of\r\ntwo weeks to do it down the Mississippi on a raft. Jim was working his\r\nmind and studying. Pretty soon he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, did you say dem clocks uz right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t yo\xe2\x80\x99 watch right, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s right for St. Louis, but she\xe2\x80\x99s an hour wrong for here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, is you tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to let on dat de time ain\xe2\x80\x99t de _same_\r\neverywheres?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t the same everywheres, by a long shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim looked distressed, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt grieves me to hear you talk like dat, Mars Tom; I\xe2\x80\x99s right down\r\nashamed to hear you talk like dat, arter de way you\xe2\x80\x99s been raised.\r\nYassir, it\xe2\x80\x99d break yo\xe2\x80\x99 Aunt Polly\xe2\x80\x99s heart to hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was astonished. He looked Jim over wondering, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nnothing, and Jim went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, who put de people out yonder in St. Louis? De Lord done it.\r\nWho put de people here whar we is? De Lord done it. Ain\xe2\x80\x99 dey bofe his\r\nchildren? \xe2\x80\x99Cose dey is. _Well_, den! is he gwine to _scriminate_ \xe2\x80\x99twixt\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScriminate! I never heard such ignorance. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\ndiscriminating about it. When he makes you and some more of his\r\nchildren black, and makes the rest of us white, what do you call that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim see the p\xe2\x80\x99int. He was stuck. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer. Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does discriminate, you see, when he wants to; but this case _here_\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t no discrimination of his, it\xe2\x80\x99s man\xe2\x80\x99s. The Lord made the day, and\r\nhe made the night; but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t invent the hours, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndistribute them around. Man did that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, is dat so? Man done it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho tole him he could?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody. He never asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim studied a minute, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dat do beat me. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 tuck no sich resk. But some\r\npeople ain\xe2\x80\x99t scared o\xe2\x80\x99 nothin\xe2\x80\x99. Dey bangs right ahead; _dey_ don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nwhat happens. So den dey\xe2\x80\x99s allays an hour\xe2\x80\x99s diff\xe2\x80\x99unce everywhah, Mars\r\nTom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour? No! It\xe2\x80\x99s four minutes difference for every degree of\r\nlongitude, you know. Fifteen of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x99s an hour, thirty of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x99s two\r\nhours, and so on. When it\xe2\x80\x99s one clock Tuesday morning in England, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock the night before in New York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim moved a little way along the locker, and you could see he was\r\ninsulted. He kept shaking his head and muttering, and so I slid along\r\nto him and patted him on the leg, and petted him up, and got him over\r\nthe worst of his feelings, and then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom talkin\xe2\x80\x99 sich talk as dat! Choosday in one place en Monday in\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other, bofe in the same day! Huck, dis ain\xe2\x80\x99t no place to joke\xe2\x80\x94up here\r\nwhah we is. Two days in one day! How you gwine to get two days inter\r\none day? Can\xe2\x80\x99t git two hours inter one hour, kin you? Can\xe2\x80\x99t git two\r\nniggers inter one nigger skin, kin you? Can\xe2\x80\x99t git two gallons of whisky\r\ninter a one-gallon jug, kin you? No, sir, \xe2\x80\x99twould strain de jug. Yes,\r\nen even den you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe. Why, looky here, Huck,\r\ns\xe2\x80\x99posen de Choosday was New Year\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94now den! is you gwine to tell me\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s dis year in one place en las\xe2\x80\x99 year in t\xe2\x80\x99other, bofe in de\r\nidentical same minute? It\xe2\x80\x99s de beatenest rubbage! I can\xe2\x80\x99t stan\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stan\xe2\x80\x99 to hear tell \xe2\x80\x99bout it.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he begun to shiver and turn\r\ngray, and Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? What\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim could hardly speak, but he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, you ain\xe2\x80\x99t jokin\xe2\x80\x99, en it\xe2\x80\x99s _so?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not, and it is so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim shivered again, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDen dat Monday could be de las\xe2\x80\x99 day, en dey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be no las\xe2\x80\x99 day in\r\nEngland, en de dead wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be called. We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go over dah, Mars\r\nTom. Please git him to turn back; I wants to be whah\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden we see something, and all jumped up, and forgot\r\neverything and begun to gaze. Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t that the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He catched his breath, then says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_, sure as\r\nyou live! It\xe2\x80\x99s the ocean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat made me and Jim catch our breath, too. Then we all stood petrified\r\nbut happy, for none of us had ever seen an ocean, or ever expected to.\r\nTom kept muttering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAtlantic Ocean\xe2\x80\x94Atlantic. Land, don\xe2\x80\x99t it sound great! And that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_it_\xe2\x80\x94and _we_ are looking at it\xe2\x80\x94we! Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s just too splendid to\r\nbelieve!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen we see a big bank of black smoke; and when we got nearer, it was a\r\ncity\xe2\x80\x94and a monster she was, too, with a thick fringe of ships around\r\none edge; and we wondered if it was New York, and begun to jaw and\r\ndispute about it, and, first we knowed, it slid from under us and went\r\nflying behind, and here we was, out over the very ocean itself, and\r\ngoing like a cyclone. Then we woke up, I tell you!\r\n\r\nWe made a break aft and raised a wail, and begun to beg the professor\r\nto turn back and land us, but he jerked out his pistol and motioned us\r\nback, and we went, but nobody will ever know how bad we felt.\r\n\r\nThe land was gone, all but a little streak, like a snake, away off on\r\nthe edge of the water, and down under us was just ocean, ocean,\r\nocean\xe2\x80\x94millions of miles of it, heaving and pitching and squirming, and\r\nwhite sprays blowing from the wave-tops, and only a few ships in sight,\r\nwallowing around and laying over, first on one side and then on\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other, and sticking their bows under and then their sterns; and\r\nbefore long there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no ships at all, and we had the sky and the\r\nwhole ocean all to ourselves, and the roomiest place I ever see and the\r\nlonesomest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nSTORM\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it got lonesomer and lonesomer. There was the big sky up there,\r\nempty and awful deep; and the ocean down there without a thing on it\r\nbut just the waves. All around us was a ring, where the sky and the\r\nwater come together; yes, a monstrous big ring it was, and we right in\r\nthe dead center of it\xe2\x80\x94plumb in the center. We was racing along like a\r\nprairie fire, but it never made any difference, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to git\r\npast that center no way. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see that we ever gained an inch on\r\nthat ring. It made a body feel creepy, it was so curious and\r\nunaccountable.\r\n\r\nWell, everything was so awful still that we got to talking in a very\r\nlow voice, and kept on getting creepier and lonesomer and less and less\r\ntalky, till at last the talk ran dry altogether, and we just set there\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cthunk,\xe2\x80\x9d as Jim calls it, and never said a word the longest time.\r\n\r\nThe professor never stirred till the sun was overhead, then he stood up\r\nand put a kind of triangle to his eye, and Tom said it was a sextant\r\nand he was taking the sun to see whereabouts the balloon was. Then he\r\nciphered a little and looked in a book, and then he begun to carry on\r\nagain. He said lots of wild things, and, among others, he said he would\r\nkeep up this hundred-mile gait till the middle of to-morrow afternoon,\r\nand then he\xe2\x80\x99d land in London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cThe professor said he would keep up this hundred-mile\r\ngait till tomorrow\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nWe said we would be humbly thankful.\r\n\r\nHe was turning away, but he whirled around when we said that, and give\r\nus a long look of his blackest kind\xe2\x80\x94one of the maliciousest and\r\nsuspiciousest looks I ever see. Then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to leave me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to deny it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to leave me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to deny it.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say, so we held in and didn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHe went aft and set down, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to git that thing out of\r\nhis mind. Every now and then he would rip out something about it, and\r\ntry to make us answer him, but we dasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nIt got lonesomer and lonesomer right along, and it did seem to me I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it. It was still worse when night begun to come on. By\r\nand by Tom pinched me and whispers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took a glance aft, and see the professor taking a whet out of a\r\nbottle. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the looks of that. By and by he took another\r\ndrink, and pretty soon he begun to sing. It was dark now, and getting\r\nblack and stormy. He went on singing, wilder and wilder, and the\r\nthunder begun to mutter, and the wind to wheeze and moan among the\r\nropes, and altogether it was awful. It got so black we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see him\r\nany more, and wished we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear him, but we could. Then he got\r\nstill; but he warn\xe2\x80\x99t still ten minutes till we got suspicious, and\r\nwished he would start up his noise again, so we could tell where he\r\nwas. By and by there was a flash of lightning, and we see him start to\r\nget up, but he staggered and fell down. We heard him scream out in the\r\ndark:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to England. All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll change the course.\r\nThey want to leave me. I know they do. Well, they shall\xe2\x80\x94and _now!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI \xe2\x80\x99most died when he said that. Then he was still again\xe2\x80\x94still so long I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear it, and it did seem to me the lightning wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _ever_\r\ncome again. But at last there was a blessed flash, and there he was, on\r\nhis hands and knees crawling, and not four feet from us. My, but his\r\neyes was terrible! He made a lunge for Tom, and says, \xe2\x80\x9cOverboard _you_\r\ngo!\xe2\x80\x9d but it was already pitch-dark again, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see whether he\r\ngot him or not, and Tom didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a sound.\r\n\r\nThere was another long, horrible wait; then there was a flash, and I\r\nsee Tom\xe2\x80\x99s head sink down outside the boat and disappear. He was on the\r\nrope-ladder that dangled down in the air from the gunnel. The professor\r\nlet off a shout and jumped for him, and straight off it was pitch-dark\r\nagain, and Jim groaned out, \xe2\x80\x9cPo\xe2\x80\x99 Mars Tom, he\xe2\x80\x99s a goner!\xe2\x80\x9d and made a\r\njump for the professor, but the professor warn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\r\n\r\nThen we heard a couple of terrible screams, and then another not so\r\nloud, and then another that was \xe2\x80\x99way below, and you could only _just_\r\nhear it; and I heard Jim say, \xe2\x80\x9cPo\xe2\x80\x99 Mars Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen it was awful still, and I reckon a person could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 counted four\r\nthousand before the next flash come. When it come I see Jim on his\r\nknees, with his arms on the locker and his face buried in them, and he\r\nwas crying. Before I could look over the edge it was all dark again,\r\nand I was glad, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see. But when the next flash\r\ncome, I was watching, and down there I see somebody a-swinging in the\r\nwind on the ladder, and it was Tom!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome up!\xe2\x80\x9d I shouts; \xe2\x80\x9ccome up, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice was so weak, and the wind roared so, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out what\r\nhe said, but I thought he asked was the professor up there. I shouts:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\xe2\x80\x99s down in the ocean! Come up! Can we help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course, all this in the dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck, who is you hollerin\xe2\x80\x99 at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hollerin\xe2\x80\x99 at Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Huck, how kin you act so, when you know po\xe2\x80\x99 Mars Tom\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Then he let\r\noff an awful scream, and flung his head and his arms back and let off\r\nanother one, because there was a white glare just then, and he had\r\nraised up his face just in time to see Tom\xe2\x80\x99s, as white as snow, rise\r\nabove the gunnel and look him right in the eye. He thought it was Tom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nghost, you see.\r\n\r\nTom clumb aboard, and when Jim found it _was_ him, and not his ghost,\r\nhe hugged him, and called him all sorts of loving names, and carried on\r\nlike he was gone crazy, he was so glad. Says I:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you wait for, Tom? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you come up at first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dasn\xe2\x80\x99t, Huck. I knowed somebody plunged down past me, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow who it was in the dark. It could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been you, it could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\nJim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was the way with Tom Sawyer\xe2\x80\x94always sound. He warn\xe2\x80\x99t coming up till\r\nhe knowed where the professor was.\r\n\r\nThe storm let go about this time with all its might; and it was\r\ndreadful the way the thunder boomed and tore, and the lightning glared\r\nout, and the wind sung and screamed in the rigging, and the rain come\r\ndown. One second you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see your hand before you, and the next\r\nyou could count the threads in your coat-sleeve, and see a whole wide\r\ndesert of waves pitching and tossing through a kind of veil of rain. A\r\nstorm like that is the loveliest thing there is, but it ain\xe2\x80\x99t at its\r\nbest when you are up in the sky and lost, and it\xe2\x80\x99s wet and lonesome,\r\nand there\xe2\x80\x99s just been a death in the family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cThe thunder boomed, and the lightning glared, and the\r\nwind screamed in the rigging\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nWe set there huddled up in the bow, and talked low about the poor\r\nprofessor; and everybody was sorry for him, and sorry the world had\r\nmade fun of him and treated him so harsh, when he was doing the best he\r\ncould, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a friend nor nobody to encourage him and keep him\r\nfrom brooding his mind away and going deranged. There was plenty of\r\nclothes and blankets and everything at the other end, but we thought\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d ruther take the rain than go meddling back there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWe tried to make some plans, but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to no agreement. Me\r\nand Jim was for turning around and going back home, but Tom allowed\r\nthat by the time daylight come, so we could see our way, we would be so\r\nfar toward England that we might as well go there, and come back in a\r\nship, and have the glory of saying we done it.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight the storm quit and the moon come out and lit up the\r\nocean, and we begun to feel comfortable and drowsy; so we stretched out\r\non the lockers and went to sleep, and never woke up again till sun-up.\r\nThe sea was sparkling like di\xe2\x80\x99monds, and it was nice weather, and\r\npretty soon our things was all dry again.\r\n\r\nWe went aft to find some breakfast, and the first thing we noticed was\r\nthat there was a dim light burning in a compass back there under a\r\nhood. Then Tom was disturbed. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what that means, easy enough. It means that somebody has got\r\nto stay on watch and steer this thing the same as he would a ship, or\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll wander around and go wherever the wind wants her to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s she been doing since\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94since we had the\r\naccident?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWandering,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, kinder troubled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwandering, without any doubt.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s in a wind now that\xe2\x80\x99s blowing her south of east. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nlong that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo then he p\xe2\x80\x99inted her east, and said he would hold her there till we\r\nrousted out the breakfast. The professor had laid in everything a body\r\ncould want; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been better fixed. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t no milk for\r\nthe coffee, but there was water, and everything else you could want,\r\nand a charcoal stove and the fixings for it, and pipes and cigars and\r\nmatches; and wine and liquor, which warn\xe2\x80\x99t in our line; and books, and\r\nmaps, and charts, and an accordion; and furs, and blankets, and no end\r\nof rubbish, like brass beads and brass jewelry, which Tom said was a\r\nsure sign that he had an idea of visiting among savages. There was\r\nmoney, too. Yes, the professor was well enough fixed.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Tom learned me and Jim how to steer, and divided us all\r\nup into four-hour watches, turn and turn about; and when his watch was\r\nout I took his place, and he got out the professor\xe2\x80\x99s papers and pens\r\nand wrote a letter home to his aunt Polly, telling her everything that\r\nhad happened to us, and dated it \xe2\x80\x9c_In the Welkin, approaching\r\nEngland_,\xe2\x80\x9d and folded it together and stuck it fast with a red wafer,\r\nand directed it, and wrote above the direction, in big writing, \xe2\x80\x9c_From\r\nTom Sawyer, the Erronort_,\xe2\x80\x9d and said it would stump old Nat Parsons,\r\nthe postmaster, when it come along in the mail. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer, this ain\xe2\x80\x99t no welkin, it\xe2\x80\x99s a balloon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, who _said_ it was a welkin, smarty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve wrote it on the letter, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it? That don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the balloon\xe2\x80\x99s the welkin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I thought it did. Well, then, what is a welkin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI see in a minute he was stuck. He raked and scraped around in his\r\nmind, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find nothing, so he had to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, and nobody don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a word, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmighty good word, too. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t many that lays over it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve there\xe2\x80\x99s _any_ that does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks!\xe2\x80\x9d I says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what does it _mean?_\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the p\xe2\x80\x99int.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it means, I tell you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a word that people uses\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94for\xe2\x80\x94well, it\xe2\x80\x99s ornamental. They don\xe2\x80\x99t put ruffles on a shirt to\r\nkeep a person warm, do they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse they don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they put them _on_, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then; that letter I wrote is a shirt, and the welkin\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nruffle on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI judged that that would gravel Jim, and it did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mars Tom, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use to talk like dat; en, moreover, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsinful. You knows a letter ain\xe2\x80\x99t no shirt, en dey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no ruffles on\r\nit, nuther. Dey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no place to put \xe2\x80\x99em on; you can\xe2\x80\x99t put em on, and\r\ndey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay ef you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh _do_ shut up, and wait till something\xe2\x80\x99s started that you know\r\nsomething about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mars Tom, sholy you can\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about shirts,\r\nwhen, goodness knows, I\xe2\x80\x99s toted home de washin\xe2\x80\x99 ever sence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got anything to do with shirts. I only\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mars Tom, you said yo\xe2\x80\x99self dat a letter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to drive me crazy? Keep still. I only used it as a\r\nmetaphor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat word kinder bricked us up for a minute. Then Jim says\xe2\x80\x94rather\r\ntimid, because he see Tom was getting pretty tetchy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, what is a metaphor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA metaphor\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\x94well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94a metaphor\xe2\x80\x99s an illustration.\xe2\x80\x9d He see\r\n_that_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t git home, so he tried again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I say birds of a\r\nfeather flocks together, it\xe2\x80\x99s a metaphorical way of saying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut dey _don\xe2\x80\x99t!_, Mars Tom. No, sir, \xe2\x80\x99deed dey don\xe2\x80\x99t. Dey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nfeathers dat\xe2\x80\x99s more alike den a bluebird en a jaybird, but ef you waits\r\ntill you catches dem birds together, you\xe2\x80\x99ll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, give us a rest! You can\xe2\x80\x99t get the simplest little thing through\r\nyour thick skull. Now don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim was satisfied to stop. He was dreadful pleased with himself for\r\ncatching Tom out. The minute Tom begun to talk about birds I judged he\r\nwas a goner, because Jim knowed more about birds than both of us put\r\ntogether. You see, he had killed hundreds and hundreds of them, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the way to find out about birds. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way people does that\r\nwrites books about birds, and loves them so that they\xe2\x80\x99ll go hungry and\r\ntired and take any amount of trouble to find a new bird and kill it.\r\nTheir name is ornithologers, and I could have been an ornithologer\r\nmyself, because I always loved birds and creatures; and I started out\r\nto learn how to be one, and I see a bird setting on a limb of a high\r\ntree, singing with its head tilted back and its mouth open, and before\r\nI thought I fired, and his song stopped and he fell straight down from\r\nthe limb, all limp like a rag, and I run and picked him up and he was\r\ndead, and his body was warm in my hand, and his head rolled about this\r\nway and that, like his neck was broke, and there was a little white\r\nskin over his eyes, and one little drop of blood on the side of his\r\nhead; and, laws! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see nothing more for the tears; and I\r\nhain\xe2\x80\x99t never murdered no creature since that warn\xe2\x80\x99t doing me no harm,\r\nand I ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to.\r\n\r\nBut I was aggravated about that welkin. I wanted to know. I got the\r\nsubject up again, and then Tom explained, the best he could. He said\r\nwhen a person made a big speech the newspapers said the shouts of the\r\npeople made the welkin ring. He said they always said that, but none of\r\nthem ever told what it was, so he allowed it just meant outdoors and up\r\nhigh. Well, that seemed sensible enough, so I was satisfied, and said\r\nso. That pleased Tom and put him in a good humor again, and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right, then; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let bygones be bygones. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow for certain what a welkin is, but when we land in London we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake it ring, anyway, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said an erronort was a person who sailed around in balloons; and\r\nsaid it was a mighty sight finer to be Tom Sawyer the Erronort than to\r\nbe Tom Sawyer the Traveler, and we would be heard of all round the\r\nworld, if we pulled through all right, and so he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give shucks\r\nto be a traveler now.\r\n\r\nToward the middle of the afternoon we got everything ready to land, and\r\nwe felt pretty good, too, and proud; and we kept watching with the\r\nglasses, like Columbus discovering America. But we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see nothing\r\nbut ocean. The afternoon wasted out and the sun shut down, and still\r\nthere warn\xe2\x80\x99t no land anywheres. We wondered what was the matter, but\r\nreckoned it would come out all right, so we went on steering east, but\r\nwent up on a higher level so we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hit any steeples or mountains\r\nin the dark.\r\n\r\nIt was my watch till midnight, and then it was Jim\xe2\x80\x99s; but Tom stayed\r\nup, because he said ship captains done that when they was making the\r\nland, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t stand no regular watch.\r\n\r\nWell, when daylight come, Jim give a shout, and we jumped up and looked\r\nover, and there was the land sure enough\xe2\x80\x94land all around, as far as you\r\ncould see, and perfectly level and yaller. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how long we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen over it. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t no trees, nor hills, nor rocks, nor towns,\r\nand Tom and Jim had took it for the sea. They took it for the sea in a\r\ndead ca\xe2\x80\x99m; but we was so high up, anyway, that if it had been the sea\r\nand rough, it would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 looked smooth, all the same, in the night, that\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWe was all in a powerful excitement now, and grabbed the glasses and\r\nhunted everywheres for London, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find hair nor hide of it,\r\nnor any other settlement\xe2\x80\x94nor any sign of a lake or a river, either. Tom\r\nwas clean beat. He said it warn\xe2\x80\x99t his notion of England; he thought\r\nEngland looked like America, and always had that idea. So he said we\r\nbetter have breakfast, and then drop down and inquire the quickest way\r\nto London. We cut the breakfast pretty short, we was so impatient. As\r\nwe slanted along down, the weather began to moderate, and pretty soon\r\nwe shed our furs. But it kept _on_ moderating, and in a precious little\r\nwhile it was \xe2\x80\x99most too moderate. We was close down now, and just\r\nblistering!\r\n\r\nWe settled down to within thirty foot of the land\xe2\x80\x94that is, it was land\r\nif sand is land; for this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything but pure sand. Tom and me\r\nclumb down the ladder and took a run to stretch our legs, and it felt\r\namazing good\xe2\x80\x94that is, the stretching did, but the sand scorched our\r\nfeet like hot embers. Next, we see somebody coming, and started to meet\r\nhim; but we heard Jim shout, and looked around and he was fairly\r\ndancing, and making signs, and yelling. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out what he\r\nsaid, but we was scared anyway, and begun to heel it back to the\r\nballoon. When we got close enough, we understood the words, and they\r\nmade me sick:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun! Run fo\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99 life! Hit\xe2\x80\x99s a lion; I kin see him thoo de glass! Run,\r\nboys; do please heel it de bes\xe2\x80\x99 you kin. He\xe2\x80\x99s bu\xe2\x80\x99sted outen de\r\nmenagerie, en dey ain\xe2\x80\x99t nobody to stop him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cRun! Run fo\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99 life!\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nIt made Tom fly, but it took the stiffening all out of my legs. I could\r\nonly just gasp along the way you do in a dream when there\xe2\x80\x99s a ghost\r\ngaining on you.\r\n\r\nTom got to the ladder and shinned up it a piece and waited for me; and\r\nas soon as I got a foothold on it he shouted to Jim to soar away. But\r\nJim had clean lost his head, and said he had forgot how. So Tom shinned\r\nalong up and told me to follow; but the lion was arriving, fetching a\r\nmost ghastly roar with every lope, and my legs shook so I dasn\xe2\x80\x99t try to\r\ntake one of them out of the rounds for fear the other one would give\r\nway under me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there was the lion, a-ripping around under me\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nBut Tom was aboard by this time, and he started the balloon up a\r\nlittle, and stopped it again as soon as the end of the ladder was ten\r\nor twelve feet above ground. And there was the lion, a-ripping around\r\nunder me, and roaring and springing up in the air at the ladder, and\r\nonly missing it about a quarter of an inch, it seemed to me. It was\r\ndelicious to be out of his reach, perfectly delicious, and made me feel\r\ngood and thankful all up one side; but I was hanging there helpless and\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t climb, and that made me feel perfectly wretched and miserable\r\nall down the other. It is most seldom that a person feels so mixed like\r\nthat; and it is not to be recommended, either.\r\n\r\nTom asked me what he\xe2\x80\x99d better do, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. He asked me if I\r\ncould hold on whilst he sailed away to a safe place and left the lion\r\nbehind. I said I could if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go no higher than he was now; but\r\nif he went higher I would lose my head and fall, sure. So he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a good grip,\xe2\x80\x9d and he started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go so fast,\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes my head swim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had started like a lightning express. He slowed down, and we glided\r\nover the sand slower, but still in a kind of sickening way; for it _is_\r\nuncomfortable to see things sliding and gliding under you like that,\r\nand not a sound.\r\n\r\nBut pretty soon there was plenty of sound, for the lion was catching\r\nup. His noise fetched others. You could see them coming on the lope\r\nfrom every direction, and pretty soon there was a couple of dozen of\r\nthem under me, jumping up at the ladder and snarling and snapping at\r\neach other; and so we went skimming along over the sand, and these\r\nfellers doing what they could to help us to not forgit the occasion;\r\nand then some other beasts come, without an invite, and they started a\r\nregular riot down there.\r\n\r\nWe see this plan was a mistake. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever git away from them at\r\nthis gait, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold on forever. So Tom took a think, and\r\nstruck another idea. That was, to kill a lion with the pepper-box\r\nrevolver, and then sail away while the others stopped to fight over the\r\ncarcass. So he stopped the balloon still, and done it, and then we\r\nsailed off while the fuss was going on, and come down a quarter of a\r\nmile off, and they helped me aboard; but by the time we was out of\r\nreach again, that gang was on hand once more. And when they see we was\r\nreally gone and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get us, they sat down on their hams and\r\nlooked up at us so kind of disappointed that it was as much as a person\r\ncould do not to see _their_ side of the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nIT\xe2\x80\x99S A CARAVAN\r\n\r\n\r\nI was so weak that the only thing I wanted was a chance to lay down, so\r\nI made straight for my locker-bunk, and stretched myself out there. But\r\na body couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get back his strength in no such oven as that, so Tom\r\ngive the command to soar, and Jim started her aloft.\r\n\r\nWe had to go up a mile before we struck comfortable weather where it\r\nwas breezy and pleasant and just right, and pretty soon I was all\r\nstraight again. Tom had been setting quiet and thinking; but now he\r\njumps up and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet you a thousand to one I know where we are. We\xe2\x80\x99re in the Great\r\nSahara, as sure as guns!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was so excited he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold still; but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, where\xe2\x80\x99s the Great Sahara? In England or in Scotland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t in either; it\xe2\x80\x99s in Africa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim\xe2\x80\x99s eyes bugged out, and he begun to stare down with no end of\r\ninterest, because that was where his originals come from; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmore than half believe it. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, you know; it seemed too awful\r\nfar away for us to have traveled.\r\n\r\nBut Tom was full of his discovery, as he called it, and said the lions\r\nand the sand meant the Great Desert, sure. He said he could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 found\r\nout, before we sighted land, that we was crowding the land somewheres,\r\nif he had thought of one thing; and when we asked him what, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese clocks. They\xe2\x80\x99re chronometers. You always read about them in sea\r\nvoyages. One of them is keeping Grinnage time, and the other is keeping\r\nSt. Louis time, like my watch. When we left St. Louis it was four in\r\nthe afternoon by my watch and this clock, and it was ten at night by\r\nthis Grinnage clock. Well, at this time of the year the sun sets at\r\nabout seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Now I noticed the time yesterday evening when the\r\nsun went down, and it was half-past five o\xe2\x80\x99clock by the Grinnage clock,\r\nand half past 11 A.M. by my watch and the other clock. You see, the sun\r\nrose and set by my watch in St. Louis, and the Grinnage clock was six\r\nhours fast; but we\xe2\x80\x99ve come so far east that it comes within less than\r\nhalf an hour of setting by the Grinnage clock now, and I\xe2\x80\x99m away\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94more than four hours and a half out. You see, that meant that we\r\nwas closing up on the longitude of Ireland, and would strike it before\r\nlong if we was p\xe2\x80\x99inted right\xe2\x80\x94which we wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. No, sir, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\na-wandering\xe2\x80\x94wandering \xe2\x80\x99way down south of east, and it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion we\r\nare in Africa. Look at this map. You see how the shoulder of Africa\r\nsticks out to the west. Think how fast we\xe2\x80\x99ve traveled; if we had gone\r\nstraight east we would be long past England by this time. You watch for\r\nnoon, all of you, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll stand up, and when we can\xe2\x80\x99t cast a shadow\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll find that this Grinnage clock is coming mighty close to marking\r\ntwelve. Yes, sir, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in Africa; and it\xe2\x80\x99s just bully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim was gazing down with the glass. He shook his head and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, I reckon dey\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake som\xe2\x80\x99er\xe2\x80\x99s, hain\xe2\x80\x99t seen no niggers\r\nyit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing; they don\xe2\x80\x99t live in the desert. What is that, \xe2\x80\x99way off\r\nyonder? Gimme a glass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took a long look, and said it was like a black string stretched\r\nacross the sand, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t guess what it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a chance now to find out\r\nwhereabouts this balloon is, because as like as not that is one of\r\nthese lines here, that\xe2\x80\x99s on the map, that you call meridians of\r\nlongitude, and we can drop down and look at its number, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shucks, Huck Finn, I never see such a lunkhead as you. Did you\r\ns\xe2\x80\x99pose there\xe2\x80\x99s meridians of longitude on the _earth?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer, they\xe2\x80\x99re set down on the map, and you know it perfectly\r\nwell, and here they are, and you can see for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they\xe2\x80\x99re on the map, but that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing; there ain\xe2\x80\x99t any on\r\nthe _ground_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, do you know that to be so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, that map\xe2\x80\x99s a liar again. I never see such a liar as that\r\nmap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fired up at that, and I was ready for him, and Jim was warming his\r\nopinion, too, and next minute we\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 broke loose on another argument,\r\nif Tom hadn\xe2\x80\x99t dropped the glass and begun to clap his hands like a\r\nmaniac and sing out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCamels!\xe2\x80\x94Camels!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I grabbed a glass and Jim, too, and took a look, but I was\r\ndisappointed, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCamels your granny; they\xe2\x80\x99re spiders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpiders in a desert, you shad? Spiders walking in a procession? You\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ever reflect, Huck Finn, and I reckon you really haven\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nanything to reflect _with_. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know we\xe2\x80\x99re as much as a mile up\r\nin the air, and that that string of crawlers is two or three miles\r\naway? Spiders, good land! Spiders as big as a cow? Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nto go down and milk one of \xe2\x80\x99em. But they\xe2\x80\x99re camels, just the same. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na caravan, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a mile long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, let\xe2\x80\x99s go down and look at it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in it, and\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t going to till I see it and know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, and give the command:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLower away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we come slanting down into the hot weather, we could see that it was\r\ncamels, sure enough, plodding along, an everlasting string of them,\r\nwith bales strapped to them, and several hundred men in long white\r\nrobes, and a thing like a shawl bound over their heads and hanging down\r\nwith tassels and fringes; and some of the men had long guns and some\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t, and some was riding and some was walking. And the weather\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nit was just roasting. And how slow they did creep along! We swooped\r\ndown now, all of a sudden, and stopped about a hundred yards over their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cWe swooped down, now, all of a sudden\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nThe men all set up a yell, and some of them fell flat on their\r\nstomachs, some begun to fire their guns at us, and the rest broke and\r\nscampered every which way, and so did the camels.\r\n\r\nWe see that we was making trouble, so we went up again about a mile, to\r\nthe cool weather, and watched them from there. It took them an hour to\r\nget together and form the procession again; then they started along,\r\nbut we could see by the glasses that they wasn\xe2\x80\x99t paying much attention\r\nto anything but us. We poked along, looking down at them with the\r\nglasses, and by and by we see a big sand mound, and something like\r\npeople the other side of it, and there was something like a man laying\r\non top of the mound that raised his head up every now and then, and\r\nseemed to be watching the caravan or us, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know which. As the\r\ncaravan got nearer, he sneaked down on the other side and rushed to the\r\nother men and horses\xe2\x80\x94for that is what they was\xe2\x80\x94and we see them mount in\r\na hurry; and next, here they come, like a house afire, some with lances\r\nand some with long guns, and all of them yelling the best they could.\r\n\r\nThey come a-tearing down on to the caravan, and the next minute both\r\nsides crashed together and was all mixed up, and there was such another\r\npopping of guns as you never heard, and the air got so full of smoke\r\nyou could only catch glimpses of them struggling together. There must\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been six hundred men in that battle, and it was terrible to see.\r\nThen they broke up into gangs and groups, fighting tooth and nail, and\r\nscurrying and scampering around, and laying into each other like\r\neverything; and whenever the smoke cleared a little you could see dead\r\nand wounded people and camels scattered far and wide and all about, and\r\ncamels racing off in every direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cThe last man to go snatched up a child, and carried it\r\noff in front of him on his horse\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nAt last the robbers see they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t win, so their chief sounded a\r\nsignal, and all that was left of them broke away and went scampering\r\nacross the plain. The last man to go snatched up a child and carried it\r\noff in front of him on his horse, and a woman run screaming and begging\r\nafter him, and followed him away off across the plain till she was\r\nseparated a long ways from her people; but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use, and she\r\nhad to give it up, and we see her sink down on the sand and cover her\r\nface with her hands. Then Tom took the hellum, and started for that\r\nyahoo, and we come a-whizzing down and made a swoop, and knocked him\r\nout of the saddle, child and all; and he was jarred considerable, but\r\nthe child wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt, but laid there working its hands and legs in the\r\nair like a tumble-bug that\xe2\x80\x99s on its back and can\xe2\x80\x99t turn over. The man\r\nwent staggering off to overtake his horse, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what had hit\r\nhim, for we was three or four hundred yards up in the air by this time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cWe come a-whizzing down, and made a swoop, and knocked\r\nhim out of the saddle, child and all\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nWe judged the woman would go and get the child now; but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t. We\r\ncould see her, through the glass, still setting there, with her head\r\nbowed down on her knees; so of course she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the performance,\r\nand thought her child was clean gone with the man. She was nearly a\r\nhalf a mile from her people, so we thought we might go down to the\r\nchild, which was about a quarter of a mile beyond her, and snake it to\r\nher before the caravan people could git to us to do us any harm; and\r\nbesides, we reckoned they had enough business on their hands for one\r\nwhile, anyway, with the wounded. We thought we\xe2\x80\x99d chance it, and we did.\r\nWe swooped down and stopped, and Jim shinned down the ladder and\r\nfetched up the kid, which was a nice fat little thing, and in a noble\r\ngood humor, too, considering it was just out of a battle and been\r\ntumbled off of a horse; and then we started for the mother, and stopped\r\nback of her and tolerable near by, and Jim slipped down and crept up\r\neasy, and when he was close back of her the child goo-goo\xe2\x80\x99d, the way a\r\nchild does, and she heard it, and whirled and fetched a shriek of joy,\r\nand made a jump for the kid and snatched it and hugged it, and dropped\r\nit and hugged Jim, and then snatched off a gold chain and hung it\r\naround Jim\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and hugged him again, and jerked up the child again,\r\na-sobbing and glorifying all the time; and Jim he shoved for the ladder\r\nand up it, and in a minute we was back up in the sky and the woman was\r\nstaring up, with the back of her head between her shoulders and the\r\nchild with its arms locked around her neck. And there she stood, as\r\nlong as we was in sight a-sailing away in the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTOM RESPECTS THE FLEA\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoon!\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom, and so it was. His shadder was just a blot around his\r\nfeet. We looked, and the Grinnage clock was so close to twelve the\r\ndifference didn\xe2\x80\x99t amount to nothing. So Tom said London was right north\r\nof us or right south of us, one or t\xe2\x80\x99other, and he reckoned by the\r\nweather and the sand and the camels it was north; and a good many miles\r\nnorth, too; as many as from New York to the city of Mexico, he guessed.\r\n\r\nJim said he reckoned a balloon was a good deal the fastest thing in the\r\nworld, unless it might be some kinds of birds\xe2\x80\x94a wild pigeon, maybe, or\r\na railroad.\r\n\r\nBut Tom said he had read about railroads in England going nearly a\r\nhundred miles an hour for a little ways, and there never was a bird in\r\nthe world that could do that\xe2\x80\x94except one, and that was a flea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA flea? Why, Mars Tom, in de fust place he ain\xe2\x80\x99t a bird, strickly\r\nspeakin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ain\xe2\x80\x99t a bird, eh? Well, then, what is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t rightly know, Mars Tom, but I speck he\xe2\x80\x99s only jist a\xe2\x80\x99 animal.\r\nNo, I reckon dat won\xe2\x80\x99t do, nuther, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t big enough for a\xe2\x80\x99 animal.\r\nHe mus\xe2\x80\x99 be a bug. Yassir, dat\xe2\x80\x99s what he is, he\xe2\x80\x99s a bug.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet he ain\xe2\x80\x99t, but let it go. What\xe2\x80\x99s your second place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in de second place, birds is creturs dat goes a long ways, but a\r\nflea don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t he? Come, now, what _is_ a long distance, if you\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s miles, and lots of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94anybody knows dat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t a man walk miles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYassir, he kin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs many as a railroad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYassir, if you give him time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t a flea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I s\xe2\x80\x99pose so\xe2\x80\x94ef you gives him heaps of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you begin to see, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, that _distance_ ain\xe2\x80\x99t the thing to\r\njudge by, at all; it\xe2\x80\x99s the time it takes to go the distance _in_ that\r\n_counts_, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, hit do look sorter so, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 b\xe2\x80\x99lieved it, Mars\r\nTom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where\xe2\x80\x99s your railroad, alongside of a flea?\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of _proportion_, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is; and when you come to\r\ngauge a thing\xe2\x80\x99s speed by its size, where\xe2\x80\x99s your bird and your man and\r\nyour railroad, alongside of a flea? The fastest man can\xe2\x80\x99t run more than\r\nabout ten miles in an hour\xe2\x80\x94not much over ten thousand times his own\r\nlength. But all the books says any common ordinary third-class flea can\r\njump a hundred and fifty times his own length; yes, and he can make\r\nfive jumps a second too\xe2\x80\x94seven hundred and fifty times his own length,\r\nin one little second\xe2\x80\x94for he don\xe2\x80\x99t fool away any time stopping and\r\nstarting\xe2\x80\x94he does them both at the same time; you\xe2\x80\x99ll see, if you try to\r\nput your finger on him. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s a common, ordinary, third-class\r\nflea\xe2\x80\x99s gait; but you take an Eyetalian _first_-class, that\xe2\x80\x99s been the\r\npet of the nobility all his life, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ever knowed what want or\r\nsickness or exposure was, and he can jump more than three hundred times\r\nhis own length, and keep it up all day, five such jumps every second,\r\nwhich is fifteen hundred times his own length. Well, suppose a man\r\ncould go fifteen hundred times his own length in a second\xe2\x80\x94say, a mile\r\nand a half. It\xe2\x80\x99s ninety miles a minute; it\xe2\x80\x99s considerable more than\r\nfive thousand miles an hour. Where\xe2\x80\x99s your man _now?_\xe2\x80\x94yes, and your\r\nbird, and your railroad, and your balloon? Laws, they don\xe2\x80\x99t amount to\r\nshucks \xe2\x80\x99longside of a flea. A flea is just a comet b\xe2\x80\x99iled down small.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your man now?\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nJim was a good deal astonished, and so was I. Jim said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs dem figgers jist edjackly true, en no jokin\xe2\x80\x99 en no lies, Mars Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they are; they\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, den, honey, a body\xe2\x80\x99s got to respec\xe2\x80\x99 a flea. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t had no\r\nrespec\xe2\x80\x99 for um befo\xe2\x80\x99, sca\xe2\x80\x99sely, but dey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no gittin\xe2\x80\x99 roun\xe2\x80\x99 it, dey\r\ndo deserve it, dat\xe2\x80\x99s certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I bet they do. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got ever so much more sense, and brains,\r\nand brightness, in proportion to their size, than any other cretur in\r\nthe world. A person can learn them \xe2\x80\x99most anything; and they learn it\r\nquicker than any other cretur, too. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been learnt to haul little\r\ncarriages in harness, and go this way and that way and t\xe2\x80\x99other way\r\naccording to their orders; yes, and to march and drill like soldiers,\r\ndoing it as exact, according to orders, as soldiers does it. They\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen learnt to do all sorts of hard and troublesome things. S\xe2\x80\x99pose you\r\ncould cultivate a flea up to the size of a man, and keep his natural\r\nsmartness a-growing and a-growing right along up, bigger and bigger,\r\nand keener and keener, in the same proportion\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x99d the human race\r\nbe, do you reckon? That flea would be President of the United States,\r\nand you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t any more prevent it than you can prevent lightning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cThat flea would be President of the United States, and\r\nyou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent it\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lan\xe2\x80\x99, Mars Tom, I never knowed dey was so much _to_ de beas\xe2\x80\x99. No,\r\nsir, I never had no idea of it, and dat\xe2\x80\x99s de fac\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s more to him, by a long sight, than there is to any other\r\ncretur, man or beast, in proportion to size. He\xe2\x80\x99s the interestingest of\r\nthem all. People have so much to say about an ant\xe2\x80\x99s strength, and an\r\nelephant\xe2\x80\x99s, and a locomotive\xe2\x80\x99s. Shucks, they don\xe2\x80\x99t begin with a flea.\r\nHe can lift two or three hundred times his own weight. And none of them\r\ncan come anywhere near it. And, moreover, he has got notions of his\r\nown, and is very particular, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t fool him; his instinct, or\r\nhis judgment, or whatever it is, is perfectly sound and clear, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ever make a mistake. People think all humans are alike to a flea.\r\nIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t so. There\xe2\x80\x99s folks that he won\xe2\x80\x99t go near, hungry or not hungry,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had one of them on me in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so; I ain\xe2\x80\x99t joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sah, I hain\xe2\x80\x99t ever heard de likes o\xe2\x80\x99 dat befo\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d Jim couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve it, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t; so we had to drop down to the sand and git\r\na supply and see. Tom was right. They went for me and Jim by the\r\nthousand, but not a one of them lit on Tom. There warn\xe2\x80\x99t no explaining\r\nit, but there it was and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no getting around it. He said it\r\nhad always been just so, and he\xe2\x80\x99d just as soon be where there was a\r\nmillion of them as not; they\xe2\x80\x99d never touch him nor bother him.\r\n\r\nWe went up to the cold weather to freeze \xe2\x80\x99em out, and stayed a little\r\nspell, and then come back to the comfortable weather and went lazying\r\nalong twenty or twenty-five miles an hour, the way we\xe2\x80\x99d been doing for\r\nthe last few hours. The reason was, that the longer we was in that\r\nsolemn, peaceful desert, the more the hurry and fuss got kind of\r\nsoothed down in us, and the more happier and contented and satisfied we\r\ngot to feeling, and the more we got to liking the desert, and then\r\nloving it. So we had cramped the speed down, as I was saying, and was\r\nhaving a most noble good lazy time, sometimes watching through the\r\nglasses, sometimes stretched out on the lockers reading, sometimes\r\ntaking a nap.\r\n\r\nIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like we was the same lot that was in such a state to\r\nfind land and git ashore, but it was. But we had got over that\xe2\x80\x94clean\r\nover it. We was used to the balloon now and not afraid any more, and\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be anywheres else. Why, it seemed just like home; it\r\n\xe2\x80\x99most seemed as if I had been born and raised in it, and Jim and Tom\r\nsaid the same. And always I had had hateful people around me, a-nagging\r\nat me, and pestering of me, and scolding, and finding fault, and\r\nfussing and bothering, and sticking to me, and keeping after me, and\r\nmaking me do this, and making me do that and t\xe2\x80\x99other, and always\r\nselecting out the things I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do, and then giving me Sam\r\nHill because I shirked and done something else, and just aggravating\r\nthe life out of a body all the time; but up here in the sky it was so\r\nstill and sunshiny and lovely, and plenty to eat, and plenty of sleep,\r\nand strange things to see, and no nagging and no pestering, and no good\r\npeople, and just holiday all the time. Land, I warn\xe2\x80\x99t in no hurry to\r\ngit out and buck at civilization again. Now, one of the worst things\r\nabout civilization is, that anybody that gits a letter with trouble in\r\nit comes and tells you all about it and makes you feel bad, and the\r\nnewspapers fetches you the troubles of everybody all over the world,\r\nand keeps you downhearted and dismal \xe2\x80\x99most all the time, and it\xe2\x80\x99s such\r\na heavy load for a person. I hate them newspapers; and I hate letters;\r\nand if I had my way I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow nobody to load his troubles on to\r\nother folks he ain\xe2\x80\x99t acquainted with, on t\xe2\x80\x99other side of the world,\r\nthat way. Well, up in a balloon there ain\xe2\x80\x99t any of that, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndarlingest place there is.\r\n\r\nWe had supper, and that night was one of the prettiest nights I ever\r\nsee. The moon made it just like daylight, only a heap softer; and once\r\nwe see a lion standing all alone by himself, just all alone on the\r\nearth, it seemed like, and his shadder laid on the sand by him like a\r\npuddle of ink. That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of moonlight to have.\r\n\r\nMainly we laid on our backs and talked; we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to sleep.\r\nTom said we was right in the midst of the Arabian Nights now. He said\r\nit was right along here that one of the cutest things in that book\r\nhappened; so we looked down and watched while he told about it, because\r\nthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything that is so interesting to look at as a place that\r\na book has talked about. It was a tale about a camel-driver that had\r\nlost his camel, and he come along in the desert and met a man, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you run across a stray camel to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the man says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he blind in his left eye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad he lost an upper front tooth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas his off hind leg lame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he loaded with millet-seed on one side and honey on the other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you needn\xe2\x80\x99t go into no more details\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the one, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin a hurry. Where did you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hain\xe2\x80\x99t seen him at all,\xe2\x80\x9d the man says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHain\xe2\x80\x99t seen him at all? How can you describe him so close, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause when a person knows how to use his eyes, everything has got a\r\nmeaning to it; but most people\xe2\x80\x99s eyes ain\xe2\x80\x99t any good to them. I knowed\r\na camel had been along, because I seen his track. I knowed he was lame\r\nin his off hind leg because he had favored that foot and trod light on\r\nit, and his track showed it. I knowed he was blind on his left side\r\nbecause he only nibbled the grass on the right side of the trail. I\r\nknowed he had lost an upper front tooth because where he bit into the\r\nsod his teeth-print showed it. The millet-seed sifted out on one\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94the ants told me that; the honey leaked out on the other\xe2\x80\x94the flies\r\ntold me that. I know all about your camel, but I hain\xe2\x80\x99t seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Mars Tom, hit\xe2\x80\x99s a mighty good tale, and powerful interestin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_All?_\xe2\x80\x9d says Jim, astonished. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat \xe2\x80\x99come o\xe2\x80\x99 de camel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, don\xe2\x80\x99t de tale say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim puzzled a minute, then he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Ef dat ain\xe2\x80\x99t de beatenes\xe2\x80\x99 tale ever I struck. Jist gits to de\r\nplace whah de intrust is gittin\xe2\x80\x99 red-hot, en down she breaks. Why, Mars\r\nTom, dey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no _sense_ in a tale dat acts like dat. Hain\xe2\x80\x99t you got\r\nno _idea_ whether de man got de camel back er not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI see myself there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no sense in the tale, to chop square off that\r\nway before it come to anything, but I warn\xe2\x80\x99t going to say so, because I\r\ncould see Tom was souring up pretty fast over the way it flatted out\r\nand the way Jim had popped on to the weak place in it, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s fair for everybody to pile on to a feller when he\xe2\x80\x99s down.\r\nBut Tom he whirls on me and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do _you_ think of the tale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course, then, I had to come out and make a clean breast and say it\r\ndid seem to me, too, same as it did to Jim, that as long as the tale\r\nstopped square in the middle and never got to no place, it really\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t worth the trouble of telling.\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s chin dropped on his breast, and \xe2\x80\x99stead of being mad, as I\r\nreckoned he\xe2\x80\x99d be, to hear me scoff at his tale that way, he seemed to\r\nbe only sad; and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome people can see, and some can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94just as that man said. Let alone a\r\ncamel, if a cyclone had gone by, _you_ duffers wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 noticed the\r\ntrack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he meant by that, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say; it was just one\r\nof his irrulevances, I reckon\xe2\x80\x94he was full of them, sometimes, when he\r\nwas in a close place and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see no other way out\xe2\x80\x94but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind. We\xe2\x80\x99d spotted the soft place in that tale sharp enough, he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t git away from that little fact. It graveled him like the\r\nnation, too, I reckon, much as he tried not to let on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTHE DISAPPEARING LAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had an early breakfast in the morning, and set looking down on the\r\ndesert, and the weather was ever so bammy and lovely, although we\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t high up. You have to come down lower and lower after sundown in\r\nthe desert, because it cools off so fast; and so, by the time it is\r\ngetting toward dawn, you are skimming along only a little ways above\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\nWe was watching the shadder of the balloon slide along the ground, and\r\nnow and then gazing off across the desert to see if anything was\r\nstirring, and then down on the shadder again, when all of a sudden\r\nalmost right under us we see a lot of men and camels laying scattered\r\nabout, perfectly quiet, like they was asleep.\r\n\r\nWe shut off the power, and backed up and stood over them, and then we\r\nsee that they was all dead. It give us the cold shivers. And it made us\r\nhush down, too, and talk low, like people at a funeral. We dropped down\r\nslow and stopped, and me and Tom clumb down and went among them. There\r\nwas men, and women, and children. They was dried by the sun and dark\r\nand shriveled and leathery, like the pictures of mummies you see in\r\nbooks. And yet they looked just as human, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 believed it;\r\njust like they was asleep.\r\n\r\nSome of the people and animals was partly covered with sand, but most\r\nof them not, for the sand was thin there, and the bed was gravel and\r\nhard. Most of the clothes had rotted away; and when you took hold of a\r\nrag, it tore with a touch, like spiderweb. Tom reckoned they had been\r\nlaying there for years.\r\n\r\nSome of the men had rusty guns by them, some had swords on and had\r\nshawl belts with long, silver-mounted pistols stuck in them. All the\r\ncamels had their loads on yet, but the packs had busted or rotted and\r\nspilt the freight out on the ground. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t reckon the swords was\r\nany good to the dead people any more, so we took one apiece, and some\r\npistols. We took a small box, too, because it was so handsome and\r\ninlaid so fine; and then we wanted to bury the people; but there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nno way to do it that we could think of, and nothing to do it with but\r\nsand, and that would blow away again, of course.\r\n\r\nThen we mounted high and sailed away, and pretty soon that black spot\r\non the sand was out of sight, and we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever see them poor people\r\nagain in this world. We wondered, and reasoned, and tried to guess how\r\nthey come to be there, and how it all happened to them, but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake it out. First we thought maybe they got lost, and wandered around\r\nand about till their food and water give out and they starved to death;\r\nbut Tom said no wild animals nor vultures hadn\xe2\x80\x99t meddled with them, and\r\nso that guess wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. So at last we give it up, and judged we\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think about it no more, because it made us low-spirited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cWe opened the box, and it had gems and jewels in it\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nThen we opened the box, and it had gems and jewels in it, quite a pile,\r\nand some little veils of the kind the dead women had on, with fringes\r\nmade out of curious gold money that we warn\xe2\x80\x99t acquainted with. We\r\nwondered if we better go and try to find them again and give it back;\r\nbut Tom thought it over and said no, it was a country that was full of\r\nrobbers, and they would come and steal it; and then the sin would be on\r\nus for putting the temptation in their way. So we went on; but I wished\r\nwe had took all they had, so there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been no temptation at\r\nall left.\r\n\r\nWe had had two hours of that blazing weather down there, and was\r\ndreadful thirsty when we got aboard again. We went straight for the\r\nwater, but it was spoiled and bitter, besides being pretty near hot\r\nenough to scald your mouth. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t drink it. It was Mississippi\r\nriver water, the best in the world, and we stirred up the mud in it to\r\nsee if that would help, but no, the mud wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any better than the\r\nwater. Well, we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so very, very thirsty before, while we was\r\ninterested in the lost people, but we was now, and as soon as we found\r\nwe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a drink, we was more than thirty-five times as thirsty\r\nas we was a quarter of a minute before. Why, in a little while we\r\nwanted to hold our mouths open and pant like a dog.\r\n\r\nTom said to keep a sharp lookout, all around, everywheres, because we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngot to find an oasis or there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no telling what would happen. So\r\nwe done it. We kept the glasses gliding around all the time, till our\r\narms got so tired we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold them any more. Two hours\xe2\x80\x94three\r\nhours\xe2\x80\x94just gazing and gazing, and nothing but sand, sand, SAND, and you\r\ncould see the quivering heat-shimmer playing over it. Dear, dear, a\r\nbody don\xe2\x80\x99t know what real misery is till he is thirsty all the way\r\nthrough and is certain he ain\xe2\x80\x99t ever going to come to any water any\r\nmore. At last I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it to look around on them baking plains;\r\nI laid down on the locker, and give it up.\r\n\r\nBut by and by Tom raised a whoop, and there she was! A lake, wide and\r\nshiny, with pa\xe2\x80\x99m-trees leaning over it asleep, and their shadders in\r\nthe water just as soft and delicate as ever you see. I never see\r\nanything look so good. It was a long ways off, but that warn\xe2\x80\x99t anything\r\nto us; we just slapped on a hundred-mile gait, and calculated to be\r\nthere in seven minutes; but she stayed the same old distance away, all\r\nthe time; we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to gain on her; yes, sir, just as far, and\r\nshiny, and like a dream; but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get no nearer; and at last,\r\nall of a sudden, she was gone!\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s eyes took a spread, and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys, it was a _my_ridge!\xe2\x80\x9d Said it like he was glad. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nnothing to be glad about. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care nothing about its name, the thing I want to know\r\nis, what\xe2\x80\x99s become of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim was trembling all over, and so scared he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak, but he\r\nwanted to ask that question himself if he could \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done it. Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s _become_ of it? Why, you see yourself it\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know; but where\xe2\x80\x99s it gone _to?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked me over and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, Huck Finn, where _would_ it go to! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know what a\r\nmyridge is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything but imagination. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything _to_ it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt warmed me up a little to hear him talk like that, and I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use you talking that kind of stuff, Tom Sawyer? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nsee the lake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94you think you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think nothing about it, I _did_ see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you you _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ see it either\xe2\x80\x94because it warn\xe2\x80\x99t there to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt astonished Jim to hear him talk so, and he broke in and says, kind\r\nof pleading and distressed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, _please_ don\xe2\x80\x99t say sich things in sich an awful time as dis.\r\nYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t only reskin\xe2\x80\x99 yo\xe2\x80\x99 own self, but you\xe2\x80\x99s reskin\xe2\x80\x99 us\xe2\x80\x94same way like\r\nAnna Nias en Siffra. De lake _wuz_ dah\xe2\x80\x94I seen it jis\xe2\x80\x99 as plain as I\r\nsees you en Huck dis minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he seen it himself! He was the very one that seen it first.\r\n_Now_, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mars Tom, hit\xe2\x80\x99s so\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it. We all seen it, en dat\r\n_prove_ it was dah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProves it! How does it prove it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSame way it does in de courts en everywheres, Mars Tom. One pusson\r\nmight be drunk, or dreamy or suthin\xe2\x80\x99, en he could be mistaken; en two\r\nmight, maybe; but I tell you, sah, when three sees a thing, drunk er\r\nsober, it\xe2\x80\x99s _so_. Dey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no gittin\xe2\x80\x99 aroun\xe2\x80\x99 dat, en you knows it,\r\nMars Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know nothing of the kind. There used to be forty thousand\r\nmillion people that seen the sun move from one side of the sky to the\r\nother every day. Did that prove that the sun _done_ it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse it did. En besides, dey warn\xe2\x80\x99t no \xe2\x80\x99casion to prove it. A body\r\n\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s got any sense ain\xe2\x80\x99t gwine to doubt it. Dah she is now\xe2\x80\x94a sailin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthoo de sky, like she allays done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom turned on me, then, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do _you_ say\xe2\x80\x94is the sun standing still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use to ask such a jackass question? Anybody\r\nthat ain\xe2\x80\x99t blind can see it don\xe2\x80\x99t stand still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m lost in the sky with no company but a passel of\r\nlow-down animals that don\xe2\x80\x99t know no more than the head boss of a\r\nuniversity did three or four hundred years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt warn\xe2\x80\x99t fair play, and I let him know it. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrowin\xe2\x80\x99 mud ain\xe2\x80\x99t arguin\xe2\x80\x99, Tom Sawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my goodness, oh, my goodness gracious, dah\xe2\x80\x99s de lake agi\xe2\x80\x99n!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nyelled Jim, just then. \xe2\x80\x9c_Now_, Mars Tom, what you gwine to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, sir, there was the lake again, away yonder across the desert,\r\nperfectly plain, trees and all, just the same as it was before. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon you\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied now, Tom Sawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he says, perfectly ca\xe2\x80\x99m:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, satisfied there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no lake there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Don\xe2\x80\x99t!_ talk so, Mars Tom\xe2\x80\x94it sk\xe2\x80\x99yers me to hear you. It\xe2\x80\x99s so hot, en\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99s so thirsty, dat you ain\xe2\x80\x99t in yo\xe2\x80\x99 right mine, Mars Tom. Oh, but\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t she look good! \xe2\x80\x99clah I doan\xe2\x80\x99 know how I\xe2\x80\x99s gwine to wait tell we\r\ngits dah, I\xe2\x80\x99s _so_ thirsty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait; and it won\xe2\x80\x99t do you no good, either,\r\nbecause there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no lake there, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim, don\xe2\x80\x99t you take your eye off of it, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Deed I won\xe2\x80\x99t; en bless you, honey, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ef I wanted to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went a-tearing along toward it, piling the miles behind us like\r\nnothing, but never gaining an inch on it\xe2\x80\x94and all of a sudden it was\r\ngone again! Jim staggered, and \xe2\x80\x99most fell down. When he got his breath\r\nhe says, gasping like a fish:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, hit\xe2\x80\x99s a _ghos_\xe2\x80\x99, dat\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, en I hopes to goodness we\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t gwine to see it no mo\xe2\x80\x99. Dey\xe2\x80\x99s _been_ a lake, en suthin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappened, en de lake\xe2\x80\x99s dead, en we\xe2\x80\x99s seen its ghos\xe2\x80\x99; we\xe2\x80\x99s seen it\r\ntwiste, en dat\xe2\x80\x99s proof. De desert\xe2\x80\x99s ha\xe2\x80\x99nted, it\xe2\x80\x99s ha\xe2\x80\x99nted, sho; oh,\r\nMars Tom, le\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99s git outen it; I\xe2\x80\x99d ruther die den have de night ketch\r\nus in it ag\xe2\x80\x99in en de ghos\xe2\x80\x99 er dat lake come a-mournin\xe2\x80\x99 aroun\xe2\x80\x99 us en we\r\nasleep en doan\xe2\x80\x99 know de danger we\xe2\x80\x99s in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGhost, you gander! It ain\xe2\x80\x99t anything but air and heat and thirstiness\r\npasted together by a person\xe2\x80\x99s imagination. If I\xe2\x80\x94gimme the glass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe grabbed it and begun to gaze off to the right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a flock of birds,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s getting toward sundown, and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re making a bee-line across our track for somewheres. They mean\r\nbusiness\xe2\x80\x94maybe they\xe2\x80\x99re going for food or water, or both. Let her go to\r\nstarboard!\xe2\x80\x94Port your hellum! Hard down! There\xe2\x80\x94ease up\xe2\x80\x94steady, as you\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe shut down some of the power, so as not to outspeed them, and took\r\nout after them. We went skimming along a quarter of a mile behind them,\r\nand when we had followed them an hour and a half and was getting pretty\r\ndiscouraged, and was thirsty clean to unendurableness, Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the glass, one of you, and see what that is, away ahead of the\r\nbirds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim got the first glimpse, and slumped down on the locker sick. He was\r\nmost crying, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s dah ag\xe2\x80\x99in, Mars Tom, she\xe2\x80\x99s dah ag\xe2\x80\x99in, en I knows I\xe2\x80\x99s gwine to\r\ndie, \xe2\x80\x99case when a body sees a ghos\xe2\x80\x99 de third time, dat\xe2\x80\x99s what it means.\r\nI wisht I\xe2\x80\x99d never come in dis balloon, dat I does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look no more, and what he said made me afraid, too, because\r\nI knowed it was true, for that has always been the way with ghosts; so\r\nthen I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look any more, either. Both of us begged Tom to turn\r\noff and go some other way, but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and said we was ignorant\r\nsuperstitious blatherskites. Yes, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll git come up with, one of\r\nthese days, I says to myself, insulting ghosts that way. They\xe2\x80\x99ll stand\r\nit for a while, maybe, but they won\xe2\x80\x99t stand it always, for anybody that\r\nknows about ghosts knows how easy they are hurt, and how revengeful\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\nSo we was all quiet and still, Jim and me being scared, and Tom busy.\r\nBy and by Tom fetched the balloon to a standstill, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ get up and look, you sapheads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe done it, and there was the sure-enough water right under us!\xe2\x80\x94clear,\r\nand blue, and cool, and deep, and wavy with the breeze, the loveliest\r\nsight that ever was. And all about it was grassy banks, and flowers,\r\nand shady groves of big trees, looped together with vines, and all\r\nlooking so peaceful and comfortable\xe2\x80\x94enough to make a body cry, it was\r\nso beautiful.\r\n\r\nJim _did_ cry, and rip and dance and carry on, he was so thankful and\r\nout of his mind for joy. It was my watch, so I had to stay by the\r\nworks, but Tom and Jim clumb down and drunk a barrel apiece, and\r\nfetched me up a lot, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve tasted a many a good thing in my life,\r\nbut nothing that ever begun with that water.\r\n\r\nThen we went down and had a swim, and then Tom came up and spelled me,\r\nand me and Jim had a swim, and then Jim spelled Tom, and me and Tom had\r\na foot-race and a boxing-mill, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon I ever had such a\r\ngood time in my life. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t so very hot, because it was close on to\r\nevening, and we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any clothes on, anyway. Clothes is well enough\r\nin school, and in towns, and at balls, too, but there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no sense in\r\nthem when there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no civilization nor other kinds of bothers and\r\nfussiness around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLions a-comin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x94lions! Quick, Mars Tom! Jump for yo\xe2\x80\x99 life, Huck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t we! We never stopped for clothes, but waltzed up the\r\nladder just so. Jim lost his head straight off\xe2\x80\x94he always done it\r\nwhenever he got excited and scared; and so now, \xe2\x80\x99stead of just easing\r\nthe ladder up from the ground a little, so the animals couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach\r\nit, he turned on a raft of power, and we went whizzing up and was\r\ndangling in the sky before he got his wits together and seen what a\r\nfoolish thing he was doing. Then he stopped her, but he had clean\r\nforgot what to do next; so there we was, so high that the lions looked\r\nlike pups, and we was drifting off on the wind.\r\n\r\nBut Tom he shinned up and went for the works and begun to slant her\r\ndown, and back toward the lake, where the animals was gathering like a\r\ncamp-meeting, and I judged he had lost _his_ head, too; for he knowed I\r\nwas too scared to climb, and did he want to dump me among the tigers\r\nand things?\r\n\r\nBut no, his head was level, he knowed what he was about. He swooped\r\ndown to within thirty or forty feet of the lake, and stopped right over\r\nthe center, and sung out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeggo, and drop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI done it, and shot down, feet first, and seemed to go about a mile\r\ntoward the bottom; and when I come up, he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow lay on your back and float till you\xe2\x80\x99re rested and got your pluck\r\nback, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll dip the ladder in the water and you can climb aboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI done it. Now that was ever so smart in Tom, because if he had started\r\noff somewheres else to drop down on the sand, the menagerie would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncome along, too, and might \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 kept us hunting a safe place till I got\r\ntuckered out and fell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all this time the lions and tigers was sorting out\r\nthe clothes\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nAnd all this time the lions and tigers was sorting out the clothes, and\r\ntrying to divide them up so there would be some for all, but there was\r\na misunderstanding about it somewheres, on account of some of them\r\ntrying to hog more than their share; so there was another insurrection,\r\nand you never see anything like it in the world. There must \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\nfifty of them, all mixed up together, snorting and roaring and snapping\r\nand biting and tearing, legs and tails in the air, and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell which was which, and the sand and fur a-flying. And when they got\r\ndone, some was dead and some was limping off crippled, and the rest was\r\nsetting around on the battlefield, some of them licking their sore\r\nplaces and the others looking up at us and seemed to be kind of\r\ninviting us to come down and have some fun, but which we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nany.\r\n\r\nAs for the clothes, they warn\xe2\x80\x99t any, any more. Every last rag of them\r\nwas inside of the animals; and not agreeing with them very well, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t reckon, for there was considerable many brass buttons on them,\r\nand there was knives in the pockets, too, and smoking tobacco, and\r\nnails and chalk and marbles and fishhooks and things. But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncaring. All that was bothering me was, that all we had now was the\r\nprofessor\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, a big enough assortment, but not suitable to go\r\ninto company with, if we came across any, because the britches was as\r\nlong as tunnels, and the coats and things according. Still, there was\r\neverything a tailor needed, and Jim was a kind of jack legged tailor,\r\nand he allowed he could soon trim a suit or two down for us that would\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTOM DISCOURSES ON THE DESERT\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, we thought we would drop down there a minute, but on another\r\nerrand. Most of the professor\xe2\x80\x99s cargo of food was put up in cans, in\r\nthe new way that somebody had just invented; the rest was fresh. When\r\nyou fetch Missouri beefsteak to the Great Sahara, you want to be\r\nparticular and stay up in the coolish weather. So we reckoned we would\r\ndrop down into the lion market and see how we could make out there.\r\n\r\nWe hauled in the ladder and dropped down till we was just above the\r\nreach of the animals, then we let down a rope with a slip-knot in it\r\nand hauled up a dead lion, a small tender one, then yanked up a cub\r\ntiger. We had to keep the congregation off with the revolver, or they\r\nwould \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 took a hand in the proceedings and helped.\r\n\r\nWe carved off a supply from both, and saved the skins, and hove the\r\nrest overboard. Then we baited some of the professor\xe2\x80\x99s hooks with the\r\nfresh meat and went a-fishing. We stood over the lake just a convenient\r\ndistance above the water, and catched a lot of the nicest fish you ever\r\nsee. It was a most amazing good supper we had; lion steak, tiger steak,\r\nfried fish, and hot corn-pone. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want nothing better than that.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cWe catched a lot of the nicest fish you ever see.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nWe had some fruit to finish off with. We got it out of the top of a\r\nmonstrous tall tree. It was a very slim tree that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a branch on it\r\nfrom the bottom plumb to the top, and there it bursted out like a\r\nfeather-duster. It was a pa\xe2\x80\x99m-tree, of course; anybody knows a\r\npa\xe2\x80\x99m-tree the minute he see it, by the pictures. We went for cocoanuts\r\nin this one, but there warn\xe2\x80\x99t none. There was only big loose bunches of\r\nthings like oversized grapes, and Tom allowed they was dates, because\r\nhe said they answered the description in the Arabian Nights and the\r\nother books. Of course they mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be, and they might be poison; so\r\nwe had to wait a spell, and watch and see if the birds et them. They\r\ndone it; so we done it, too, and they was most amazing good.\r\n\r\nBy this time monstrous big birds begun to come and settle on the dead\r\nanimals. They was plucky creturs; they would tackle one end of a lion\r\nthat was being gnawed at the other end by another lion. If the lion\r\ndrove the bird away, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t do no good; he was back again the minute\r\nthe lion was busy.\r\n\r\nThe big birds come out of every part of the sky\xe2\x80\x94you could make them out\r\nwith the glass while they was still so far away you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see them\r\nwith your naked eye. Tom said the birds didn\xe2\x80\x99t find out the meat was\r\nthere by the smell; they had to find it out by seeing it. Oh, but ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthat an eye for you! Tom said at the distance of five mile a patch of\r\ndead lions couldn\xe2\x80\x99t look any bigger than a person\xe2\x80\x99s finger-nail, and he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how the birds could notice such a little thing so far\r\noff.\r\n\r\nIt was strange and unnatural to see lion eat lion, and we thought maybe\r\nthey warn\xe2\x80\x99t kin. But Jim said that didn\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference. He said a\r\nhog was fond of her own children, and so was a spider, and he reckoned\r\nmaybe a lion was pretty near as unprincipled though maybe not quite. He\r\nthought likely a lion wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat his own father, if he knowed which\r\nwas him, but reckoned he would eat his brother-in-law if he was\r\nuncommon hungry, and eat his mother-in-law any time. But _reckoning_\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t settle nothing. You can reckon till the cows come home, but that\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t fetch you to no decision. So we give it up and let it drop.\r\n\r\nGenerly it was very still in the Desert nights, but this time there was\r\nmusic. A lot of other animals come to dinner; sneaking yelpers that Tom\r\nallowed was jackals, and roached-backed ones that he said was hyenas;\r\nand all the whole biling of them kept up a racket all the time. They\r\nmade a picture in the moonlight that was more different than any\r\npicture I ever see. We had a line out and made fast to the top of a\r\ntree, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t stand no watch, but all turned in and slept; but I was\r\nup two or three times to look down at the animals and hear the music.\r\nIt was like having a front seat at a menagerie for nothing, which I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever had before, and so it seemed foolish to sleep and not make\r\nthe most of it; I mightn\xe2\x80\x99t ever have such a chance again.\r\n\r\nWe went a-fishing again in the early dawn, and then lazied around all\r\nday in the deep shade on an island, taking turn about to watch and see\r\nthat none of the animals come a-snooping around there after erronorts\r\nfor dinner. We was going to leave the next day, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, it was\r\ntoo lovely.\r\n\r\nThe day after, when we rose up toward the sky and sailed off eastward,\r\nwe looked back and watched that place till it warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing but just a\r\nspeck in the Desert, and I tell you it was like saying good-bye to a\r\nfriend that you ain\xe2\x80\x99t ever going to see any more.\r\n\r\nJim was thinking to himself, and at last he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, we\xe2\x80\x99s mos\xe2\x80\x99 to de end er de Desert now, I speck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, hit stan\xe2\x80\x99 to reason we is. You knows how long we\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\na-skimmin\xe2\x80\x99 over it. Mus\xe2\x80\x99 be mos\xe2\x80\x99 out o\xe2\x80\x99 san\xe2\x80\x99. Hit\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder to me dat\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s hilt out as long as it has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty sand, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t worry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-worryin\xe2\x80\x99, Mars Tom, only wonderin\xe2\x80\x99, dat\xe2\x80\x99s all. De Lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot plenty san\xe2\x80\x99, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t doubtin\xe2\x80\x99 dat; but nemmine, He ain\xe2\x80\x99t gwyne to\r\n_was\xe2\x80\x99e_ it jist on dat account; en I allows dat dis Desert\xe2\x80\x99s plenty big\r\nenough now, jist de way she is, en you can\xe2\x80\x99t spread her out no mo\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x99dout was\xe2\x80\x99in\xe2\x80\x99 san\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go \xe2\x80\x99long! we ain\xe2\x80\x99t much more than fairly _started_ across this\r\nDesert yet. The United States is a pretty big country, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit, Huck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no bigger one, I don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cthis Desert is about the shape of the United States,\r\nand if you was to lay it down on top of the United States, it would\r\ncover the land of the free out of sight like a blanket. There\xe2\x80\x99d be a\r\nlittle corner sticking out, up at Maine and away up northwest, and\r\nFlorida sticking out like a turtle\xe2\x80\x99s tail, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all. We\xe2\x80\x99ve took\r\nCalifornia away from the Mexicans two or three years ago, so that part\r\nof the Pacific coast is ours now, and if you laid the Great Sahara down\r\nwith her edge on the Pacific, she would cover the United States and\r\nstick out past New York six hundred miles into the Atlantic ocean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood land! have you got the documents for that, Tom Sawyer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and they\xe2\x80\x99re right here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been studying them. You can look\r\nfor yourself. From New York to the Pacific is 2,600 miles. From one end\r\nof the Great Desert to the other is 3,200. The United States contains\r\n3,600,000 square miles, the Desert contains 4,162,000. With the\r\nDesert\xe2\x80\x99s bulk you could cover up every last inch of the United States,\r\nand in under where the edges projected out, you could tuck England,\r\nScotland, Ireland, France, Denmark, and all Germany. Yes, sir, you\r\ncould hide the home of the brave and all of them countries clean out of\r\nsight under the Great Sahara, and you would still have 2,000 square\r\nmiles of sand left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cit clean beats me. Why, Tom, it shows that the Lord\r\ntook as much pains makin\xe2\x80\x99 this Desert as makin\xe2\x80\x99 the United States and\r\nall them other countries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim says: \xe2\x80\x9cHuck, dat don\xe2\x80\x99 stan\xe2\x80\x99 to reason. I reckon dis Desert wa\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmade at all. Now you take en look at it like dis\xe2\x80\x94you look at it, and\r\nsee ef I\xe2\x80\x99s right. What\xe2\x80\x99s a desert good for? \xe2\x80\x99Taint good for nuthin\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nDey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no way to make it pay. Hain\xe2\x80\x99t dat so, Huck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHain\xe2\x80\x99t it so, Mars Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess so. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEf a thing ain\xe2\x80\x99t no good, it\xe2\x80\x99s made in vain, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_, den! Do de Lord make anything in vain? You answer me dat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94no, He don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDen how come He make a desert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go on. How _did_ He come to make it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, I b\xe2\x80\x99lieve it uz jes like when you\xe2\x80\x99s buildin\xe2\x80\x99 a house; dey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nallays a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 truck en rubbish lef\xe2\x80\x99 over. What does you do wid it?\r\nDoan\xe2\x80\x99 you take en k\xe2\x80\x99yart it off en dump it into a ole vacant back lot?\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Course. Now, den, it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion hit was jes like dat\xe2\x80\x94dat de Great\r\nSahara warn\xe2\x80\x99t made at all, she jes _happen_\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said it was a real good argument, and I believed it was the best one\r\nJim ever made. Tom he said the same, but said the trouble about\r\narguments is, they ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing but _theories_, after all, and\r\ntheories don\xe2\x80\x99t prove nothing, they only give you a place to rest on, a\r\nspell, when you are tuckered out butting around and around trying to\r\nfind out something there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no way _to_ find out. And he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s another trouble about theories: there\xe2\x80\x99s always a hole in them\r\nsomewheres, sure, if you look close enough. It\xe2\x80\x99s just so with this one\r\nof Jim\xe2\x80\x99s. Look what billions and billions of stars there is. How does\r\nit come that there was just exactly enough star-stuff, and none left\r\nover? How does it come there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no sand-pile up there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Jim was fixed for him and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s de Milky Way?\xe2\x80\x94dat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know. What\xe2\x80\x99s de Milky Way?\r\nAnswer me dat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it was just a sockdologer. It\xe2\x80\x99s only an opinion, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly _my_ opinion and others may think different; but I said it then\r\nand I stand to it now\xe2\x80\x94it was a sockdologer. And moreover, besides, it\r\nlanded Tom Sawyer. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. He had that stunned look of\r\na person that\xe2\x80\x99s been shot in the back with a kag of nails. All he said\r\nwas, as for people like me and Jim, he\xe2\x80\x99d just as soon have intellectual\r\nintercourse with a catfish. But anybody can say that\xe2\x80\x94and I notice they\r\nalways do, when somebody has fetched them a lifter. Tom Sawyer was\r\ntired of that end of the subject.\r\n\r\nSo we got back to talking about the size of the Desert again, and the\r\nmore we compared it with this and that and t\xe2\x80\x99other thing, the more\r\nnobler and bigger and grander it got to look right along. And so,\r\nhunting among the figgers, Tom found, by and by, that it was just the\r\nsame size as the Empire of China. Then he showed us the spread the\r\nEmpire of China made on the map, and the room she took up in the world.\r\nWell, it was wonderful to think of, and I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard talk about this Desert plenty of times, but I never\r\nknowed before how important she was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImportant! Sahara important! That\xe2\x80\x99s just the way with some people. If\r\na thing\xe2\x80\x99s big, it\xe2\x80\x99s important. That\xe2\x80\x99s all the sense they\xe2\x80\x99ve got. All\r\nthey can see is _size_. Why, look at England. It\xe2\x80\x99s the most important\r\ncountry in the world; and yet you could put it in China\xe2\x80\x99s vest-pocket;\r\nand not only that, but you\xe2\x80\x99d have the dickens\xe2\x80\x99s own time to find it\r\nagain the next time you wanted it. And look at Russia. It spreads all\r\naround and everywhere, and yet ain\xe2\x80\x99t no more important in this world\r\nthan Rhode Island is, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got half as much in it that\xe2\x80\x99s worth\r\nsaving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAway off now we see a little hill, a-standing up just on the edge of\r\nthe world. Tom broke off his talk, and reached for a glass very much\r\nexcited, and took a look, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the one I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for, sure. If I\xe2\x80\x99m right, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe one the dervish took the man into and showed him all the\r\ntreasures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we begun to gaze, and he begun to tell about it out of the Arabian\r\nNights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nTHE TREASURE-HILL\r\n\r\n\r\nTom said it happened like this.\r\n\r\nA dervish was stumping it along through the Desert, on foot, one\r\nblazing hot day, and he had come a thousand miles and was pretty poor,\r\nand hungry, and ornery and tired, and along about where we are now he\r\nrun across a camel-driver with a hundred camels, and asked him for some\r\na\xe2\x80\x99ms. But the cameldriver he asked to be excused. The dervish said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you own these camels?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they\xe2\x80\x99re mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in debt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x94me? No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a man that owns a hundred camels and ain\xe2\x80\x99t in debt is rich\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnot only rich, but very rich. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel-driver owned up that it was so. Then the dervish says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod has made you rich, and He has made me poor. He has His reasons,\r\nand they are wise, blessed be His name. But He has willed that His rich\r\nshall help His poor, and you have turned away from me, your brother, in\r\nmy need, and He will remember this, and you will lose by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat made the camel-driver feel shaky, but all the same he was born\r\nhoggish after money and didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to let go a cent; so he begun to\r\nwhine and explain, and said times was hard, and although he had took a\r\nfull freight down to Balsora and got a fat rate for it, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t git\r\nno return freight, and so he warn\xe2\x80\x99t making no great things out of his\r\ntrip. So the dervish starts along again, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, if you want to take the risk; but I reckon you\xe2\x80\x99ve made a\r\nmistake this time, and missed a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course the camel-driver wanted to know what kind of a chance he had\r\nmissed, because maybe there was money in it; so he run after the\r\ndervish, and begged him so hard and earnest to take pity on him that at\r\nlast the dervish gave in, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see that hill yonder? Well, in that hill is all the treasures\r\nof the earth, and I was looking around for a man with a particular good\r\nkind heart and a noble, generous disposition, because if I could find\r\njust that man, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a kind of a salve I could put on his eyes and\r\nhe could see the treasures and get them out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cThe camel-driver in the treasure-cave\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nSo then the camel-driver was in a sweat; and he cried, and begged, and\r\ntook on, and went down on his knees, and said he was just that kind of\r\na man, and said he could fetch a thousand people that would say he\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t ever described so exact before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d says the dervish, \xe2\x80\x9call right. If we load the hundred\r\ncamels, can I have half of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe driver was so glad he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hardly hold in, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99re shouting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they shook hands on the bargain, and the dervish got out his box and\r\nrubbed the salve on the driver\xe2\x80\x99s right eye, and the hill opened and he\r\nwent in, and there, sure enough, was piles and piles of gold and jewels\r\nsparkling like all the stars in heaven had fell down.\r\n\r\nSo him and the dervish laid into it, and they loaded every camel till\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t carry no more; then they said good-bye, and each of them\r\nstarted off with his fifty. But pretty soon the camel-driver come\r\na-running and overtook the dervish and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t in society, you know, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t really need all you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you be good, and let me have ten of your camels?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d the dervish says, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know but what you say is reasonable\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he done it, and they separated and the dervish started off again\r\nwith his forty. But pretty soon here comes the camel-driver bawling\r\nafter him again, and whines and slobbers around and begs another ten\r\noff of him, saying thirty camel loads of treasures was enough to see a\r\ndervish through, because they live very simple, you know, and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nkeep house, but board around and give their note.\r\n\r\nBut that warn\xe2\x80\x99t the end yet. That ornery hound kept coming and coming\r\ntill he had begged back all the camels and had the whole hundred. Then\r\nhe was satisfied, and ever so grateful, and said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nforgit the dervish as long as he lived, and nobody hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so good\r\nto him before, and liberal. So they shook hands good-bye, and separated\r\nand started off again.\r\n\r\nBut do you know, it warn\xe2\x80\x99t ten minutes till the camel-driver was\r\nunsatisfied again\xe2\x80\x94he was the lowdownest reptyle in seven counties\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhe come a-running again. And this time the thing he wanted was to get\r\nthe dervish to rub some of the salve on his other eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the dervish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d says the driver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can\xe2\x80\x99t fool me,\xe2\x80\x9d says the driver. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re trying to keep back\r\nsomething from me, you know it mighty well. You know, I reckon, that if\r\nI had the salve on the other eye I could see a lot more things that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvaluable. Come\xe2\x80\x94please put it on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dervish says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t keeping anything back from you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you what\r\nwould happen if I put it on. You\xe2\x80\x99d never see again. You\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nstone-blind the rest of your days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut do you know that beat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe him. No, he begged and\r\nbegged, and whined and cried, till at last the dervish opened his box\r\nand told him to put it on, if he wanted to. So the man done it, and\r\nsure enough he was as blind as a bat in a minute.\r\n\r\nThen the dervish laughed at him and mocked at him and made fun of him;\r\nand says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye\xe2\x80\x94a man that\xe2\x80\x99s blind hain\xe2\x80\x99t got no use for jewelry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he cleared out with the hundred camels, and left that man to wander\r\naround poor and miserable and friendless the rest of his days in the\r\nDesert.\r\n\r\nJim said he\xe2\x80\x99d bet it was a lesson to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom says, \xe2\x80\x9cand like a considerable many lessons a body gets.\r\nThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no account, because the thing don\xe2\x80\x99t ever happen the same way\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94and can\xe2\x80\x99t. The time Hen Scovil fell down the chimbly and crippled\r\nhis back for life, everybody said it would be a lesson to him. What\r\nkind of a lesson? How was he going to use it? He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t climb\r\nchimblies no more, and he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t no more backs to break.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll de same, Mars Tom, dey _is_ sich a thing as learnin\xe2\x80\x99 by expe\xe2\x80\x99ence.\r\nDe Good Book say de burnt chile shun de fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t denying that a thing\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson if it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing that can\r\nhappen twice just the same way. There\xe2\x80\x99s lots of such things, and _they_\r\neducate a person, that\xe2\x80\x99s what Uncle Abner always said; but there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforty _million_ lots of the other kind\xe2\x80\x94the kind that don\xe2\x80\x99t happen the\r\nsame way twice\xe2\x80\x94and they ain\xe2\x80\x99t no real use, they ain\xe2\x80\x99t no more\r\ninstructive than the small-pox. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no good to\r\nfind out you ought to been vaccinated, and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no good to git\r\nvaccinated afterward, because the small-pox don\xe2\x80\x99t come but once. But,\r\non the other hand, Uncle Abner said that the person that had took a\r\nbull by the tail once had learnt sixty or seventy times as much as a\r\nperson that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, and said a person that started in to carry a cat\r\nhome by the tail was gitting knowledge that was always going to be\r\nuseful to him, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t ever going to grow dim or doubtful. But I can\r\ntell you, Jim, Uncle Abner was down on them people that\xe2\x80\x99s all the time\r\ntrying to dig a lesson out of everything that happens, no matter\r\nwhether\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Jim was asleep. Tom looked kind of ashamed, because you know a\r\nperson always feels bad when he is talking uncommon fine and thinks the\r\nother person is admiring, and that other person goes to sleep that way.\r\nOf course he oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to go to sleep, because it\xe2\x80\x99s shabby; but the\r\nfiner a person talks the certainer it is to make you sleep, and so when\r\nyou come to look at it it ain\xe2\x80\x99t nobody\xe2\x80\x99s fault in particular; both of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x99s to blame.\r\n\r\nJim begun to snore\xe2\x80\x94soft and blubbery at first, then a long rasp, then a\r\nstronger one, then a half a dozen horrible ones like the last water\r\nsucking down the plug-hole of a bath-tub, then the same with more power\r\nto it, and some big coughs and snorts flung in, the way a cow does that\r\nis choking to death; and when the person has got to that point he is at\r\nhis level best, and can wake up a man that is in the next block with a\r\ndipperful of loddanum in him, but can\xe2\x80\x99t wake himself up although all\r\nthat awful noise of his\xe2\x80\x99n ain\xe2\x80\x99t but three inches from his own ears. And\r\nthat is the curiosest thing in the world, seems to me. But you rake a\r\nmatch to light the candle, and that little bit of a noise will fetch\r\nhim. I wish I knowed what was the reason of that, but there don\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\nto be no way to find out. Now there was Jim alarming the whole Desert,\r\nand yanking the animals out, for miles and miles around, to see what in\r\nthe nation was going on up there; there warn\xe2\x80\x99t nobody nor nothing that\r\nwas as close to the noise as _he_ was, and yet he was the only cretur\r\nthat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t disturbed by it. We yelled at him and whooped at him, it\r\nnever done no good; but the first time there come a little wee noise\r\nthat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t of a usual kind it woke him up. No, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought it\r\nall over, and so has Tom, and there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no way to find out why a\r\nsnorer can\xe2\x80\x99t hear himself snore.\r\n\r\nJim said he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been asleep; he just shut his eyes so he could\r\nlisten better.\r\n\r\nTom said nobody warn\xe2\x80\x99t accusing him.\r\n\r\nThat made him look like he wished he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything. And he\r\nwanted to git away from the subject, I reckon, because he begun to\r\nabuse the camel-driver, just the way a person does when he has got\r\ncatched in something and wants to take it out of somebody else. He let\r\ninto the camel-driver the hardest he knowed how, and I had to agree\r\nwith him; and he praised up the dervish the highest he could, and I had\r\nto agree with him there, too. But Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t so sure. You call that dervish so dreadful liberal and good\r\nand unselfish, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see it. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t hunt up another poor\r\ndervish, did he? No, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. If he was so unselfish, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\ngo in there himself and take a pocketful of jewels and go along and be\r\nsatisfied? No, sir, the person he was hunting for was a man with a\r\nhundred camels. He wanted to get away with all the treasure he could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mars Tom, he was willin\xe2\x80\x99 to divide, fair and square; he only\r\nstruck for fifty camels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he knowed how he was going to get all of them by and by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, he _tole_ de man de truck would make him bline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, because he knowed the man\xe2\x80\x99s character. It was just the kind of a\r\nman he was hunting for\xe2\x80\x94a man that never believes in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s word or\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x99s honorableness, because he ain\xe2\x80\x99t got none of his own. I reckon\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s lots of people like that dervish. They swindle, right and left,\r\nbut they always make the other person SEEM to swindle himself. They\r\nkeep inside of the letter of the law all the time, and there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nway to git hold of them. _They_ don\xe2\x80\x99t put the salve on\xe2\x80\x94oh, no, that\r\nwould be sin; but they know how to fool _you_ into putting it on, then\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s you that blinds yourself. I reckon the dervish and the\r\ncamel-driver was just a pair\xe2\x80\x94a fine, smart, brainy rascal, and a dull,\r\ncoarse, ignorant one, but both of them rascals, just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, does you reckon dey\xe2\x80\x99s any o\xe2\x80\x99 dat kind o\xe2\x80\x99 salve in de worl\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Uncle Abner says there is. He says they\xe2\x80\x99ve got it in New York,\r\nand they put it on country people\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and show them all the\r\nrailroads in the world, and they go in and git them, and then when they\r\nrub the salve on the other eye the other man bids them goodbye and goes\r\noff with their railroads. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the treasure-hill now. Lower away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe landed, but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t as interesting as I thought it was going to\r\nbe, because we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the place where they went in to git the\r\ntreasure. Still, it was plenty interesting enough, just to see the mere\r\nhill itself where such a wonderful thing happened. Jim said he wou\xe2\x80\x99dn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 missed it for three dollars, and I felt the same way.\r\n\r\nAnd to me and Jim, as wonderful a thing as any was the way Tom could\r\ncome into a strange big country like this and go straight and find a\r\nlittle hump like that and tell it in a minute from a million other\r\nhumps that was almost just like it, and nothing to help him but only\r\nhis own learning and his own natural smartness. We talked and talked it\r\nover together, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out how he done it. He had the best\r\nhead on him I ever see; and all he lacked was age, to make a name for\r\nhimself equal to Captain Kidd or George Washington. I bet you it would\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 crowded either of _them_ to find that hill, with all their gifts,\r\nbut it warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing to Tom Sawyer; he went across Sahara and put his\r\nfinger on it as easy as you could pick a nigger out of a bunch of\r\nangels.\r\n\r\nWe found a pond of salt water close by and scraped up a raft of salt\r\naround the edges, and loaded up the lion\xe2\x80\x99s skin and the tiger\xe2\x80\x99s so as\r\nthey would keep till Jim could tan them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE SAND-STORM\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went a-fooling along for a day or two, and then just as the full\r\nmoon was touching the ground on the other side of the desert, we see a\r\nstring of little black figgers moving across its big silver face. You\r\ncould see them as plain as if they was painted on the moon with ink. It\r\nwas another caravan. We cooled down our speed and tagged along after\r\nit, just to have company, though it warn\xe2\x80\x99t going our way. It was a\r\nrattler, that caravan, and a most bully sight to look at next morning\r\nwhen the sun come a-streaming across the desert and flung the long\r\nshadders of the camels on the gold sand like a thousand\r\ngrand-daddy-long-legses marching in procession. We never went very near\r\nit, because we knowed better now than to act like that and scare\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s camels and break up their caravans. It was the gayest outfit\r\nyou ever see, for rich clothes and nobby style. Some of the chiefs rode\r\non dromedaries, the first we ever see, and very tall, and they go\r\nplunging along like they was on stilts, and they rock the man that is\r\non them pretty violent and churn up his dinner considerable, I bet you,\r\nbut they make noble good time, and a camel ain\xe2\x80\x99t nowheres with them for\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nThe caravan camped, during the middle part of the day, and then started\r\nagain about the middle of the afternoon. Before long the sun begun to\r\nlook very curious. First it kind of turned to brass, and then to\r\ncopper, and after that it begun to look like a blood-red ball, and the\r\nair got hot and close, and pretty soon all the sky in the west darkened\r\nup and looked thick and foggy, but fiery and dreadful\xe2\x80\x94like it looks\r\nthrough a piece of red glass, you know. We looked down and see a big\r\nconfusion going on in the caravan, and a rushing every which way like\r\nthey was scared; and then they all flopped down flat in the sand and\r\nlaid there perfectly still.\r\n\r\nPretty soon we see something coming that stood up like an amazing wide\r\nwall, and reached from the Desert up into the sky and hid the sun, and\r\nit was coming like the nation, too. Then a little faint breeze struck\r\nus, and then it come harder, and grains of sand begun to sift against\r\nour faces and sting like fire, and Tom sung out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a sand-storm\xe2\x80\x94turn your backs to it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the sand-storm\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nWe done it; and in another minute it was blowing a gale, and the sand\r\nbeat against us by the shovelful, and the air was so thick with it we\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see a thing. In five minutes the boat was level full, and we\r\nwas setting on the lockers buried up to the chin in sand, and only our\r\nheads out and could hardly breathe.\r\n\r\nThen the storm thinned, and we see that monstrous wall go a-sailing off\r\nacross the desert, awful to look at, I tell you. We dug ourselves out\r\nand looked down, and where the caravan was before there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything\r\nbut just the sand ocean now, and all still and quiet. All them people\r\nand camels was smothered and dead and buried\xe2\x80\x94buried under ten foot of\r\nsand, we reckoned, and Tom allowed it might be years before the wind\r\nuncovered them, and all that time their friends wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever know what\r\nbecome of that caravan. Tom said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ we know what it was that happened to the people we got the\r\nswords and pistols from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, sir, that was just it. It was as plain as day now. They got buried\r\nin a sand-storm, and the wild animals couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get at them, and the\r\nwind never uncovered them again until they was dried to leather and\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t fit to eat. It seemed to me we had felt as sorry for them poor\r\npeople as a person could for anybody, and as mournful, too, but we was\r\nmistaken; this last caravan\xe2\x80\x99s death went harder with us, a good deal\r\nharder. You see, the others was total strangers, and we never got to\r\nfeeling acquainted with them at all, except, maybe, a little with the\r\nman that was watching the girl, but it was different with this last\r\ncaravan. We was huvvering around them a whole night and \xe2\x80\x99most a whole\r\nday, and had got to feeling real friendly with them, and acquainted. I\r\nhave found out that there ain\xe2\x80\x99t no surer way to find out whether you\r\nlike people or hate them than to travel with them. Just so with these.\r\nWe kind of liked them from the start, and traveling with them put on\r\nthe finisher. The longer we traveled with them, and the more we got\r\nused to their ways, the better and better we liked them, and the\r\ngladder and gladder we was that we run across them. We had come to know\r\nsome of them so well that we called them by name when we was talking\r\nabout them, and soon got so familiar and sociable that we even dropped\r\nthe Miss and Mister and just used their plain names without any handle,\r\nand it did not seem unpolite, but just the right thing. Of course, it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t their own names, but names we give them. There was Mr. Elexander\r\nRobinson and Miss Adaline Robinson, and Colonel Jacob McDougal and Miss\r\nHarryet McDougal, and Judge Jeremiah Butler and young Bushrod Butler,\r\nand these was big chiefs mostly that wore splendid great turbans and\r\nsimmeters, and dressed like the Grand Mogul, and their families. But as\r\nsoon as we come to know them good, and like them very much, it warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nMister, nor Judge, nor nothing, any more, but only Elleck, and Addy,\r\nand Jake, and Hattie, and Jerry, and Buck, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd you know the more you join in with people in their joys and their\r\nsorrows, the more nearer and dearer they come to be to you. Now we\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t cold and indifferent, the way most travelers is, we was right\r\ndown friendly and sociable, and took a chance in everything that was\r\ngoing, and the caravan could depend on us to be on hand every time, it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference what it was.\r\n\r\nWhen they camped, we camped right over them, ten or twelve hundred feet\r\nup in the air. When they et a meal, we et ourn, and it made it ever so\r\nmuch home-liker to have their company. When they had a wedding that\r\nnight, and Buck and Addy got married, we got ourselves up in the very\r\nstarchiest of the professor\xe2\x80\x99s duds for the blow-out, and when they\r\ndanced we jined in and shook a foot up there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they danced we joined in and shook a foot up\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nBut it is sorrow and trouble that brings you the nearest, and it was a\r\nfuneral that done it with us. It was next morning, just in the still\r\ndawn. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the diseased, and he warn\xe2\x80\x99t in our set, but that\r\nnever made no difference; he belonged to the caravan, and that was\r\nenough, and there warn\xe2\x80\x99t no more sincerer tears shed over him than the\r\nones we dripped on him from up there eleven hundred foot on high.\r\n\r\nYes, parting with this caravan was much more bitterer than it was to\r\npart with them others, which was comparative strangers, and been dead\r\nso long, anyway. We had knowed these in their lives, and was fond of\r\nthem, too, and now to have death snatch them from right before our\r\nfaces while we was looking, and leave us so lonesome and friendless in\r\nthe middle of that big desert, it did hurt so, and we wished we\r\nmightn\xe2\x80\x99t ever make any more friends on that voyage if we was going to\r\nlose them again like that.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cThe wedding procession\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep from talking about them, and they was all the time\r\ncoming up in our memory, and looking just the way they looked when we\r\nwas all alive and happy together. We could see the line marching, and\r\nthe shiny spearheads a-winking in the sun; we could see the dromedaries\r\nlumbering along; we could see the wedding and the funeral; and more\r\noftener than anything else we could see them praying, because they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t allow nothing to prevent that; whenever the call come, several\r\ntimes a day, they would stop right there, and stand up and face to the\r\neast, and lift back their heads, and spread out their arms and begin,\r\nand four or five times they would go down on their knees, and then fall\r\nforward and touch their forehead to the ground.\r\n\r\nWell, it warn\xe2\x80\x99t good to go on talking about them, lovely as they was in\r\ntheir life, and dear to us in their life and death both, because it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t do no good, and made us too down-hearted. Jim allowed he was\r\ngoing to live as good a life as he could, so he could see them again in\r\na better world; and Tom kept still and didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him they was only\r\nMohammedans; it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use to disappoint him, he was feeling bad\r\nenough just as it was.\r\n\r\nWhen we woke up next morning we was feeling a little cheerfuller, and\r\nhad had a most powerful good sleep, because sand is the comfortablest\r\nbed there is, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why people that can afford it don\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nit more. And it\xe2\x80\x99s terrible good ballast, too; I never see the balloon\r\nso steady before.\r\n\r\nTom allowed we had twenty tons of it, and wondered what we better do\r\nwith it; it was good sand, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem good sense to throw it\r\naway. Jim says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, can\xe2\x80\x99t we tote it back home en sell it? How long\xe2\x80\x99ll it take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDepends on the way we go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sah, she\xe2\x80\x99s wuth a quarter of a dollar a load at home, en I\r\nreckon we\xe2\x80\x99s got as much as twenty loads, hain\xe2\x80\x99t we? How much would dat\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy jings, Mars Tom, le\xe2\x80\x99s shove for home right on de spot! Hit\xe2\x80\x99s more\xe2\x80\x99n\r\na dollar en a half apiece, hain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ef dat ain\xe2\x80\x99t makin\xe2\x80\x99 money de easiest ever _I_ struck! She jes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrained in\xe2\x80\x94never cos\xe2\x80\x99 us a lick o\xe2\x80\x99 work. Le\xe2\x80\x99s mosey right along, Mars\r\nTom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Tom was thinking and ciphering away so busy and excited he never\r\nheard him. Pretty soon he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive dollars\xe2\x80\x94sho! Look here, this sand\xe2\x80\x99s worth\xe2\x80\x94worth\xe2\x80\x94why, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth\r\nno end of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is dat, Mars Tom? Go on, honey, go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the minute people knows it\xe2\x80\x99s genuwyne sand from the genuwyne\r\nDesert of Sahara, they\xe2\x80\x99ll just be in a perfect state of mind to git\r\nhold of some of it to keep on the what-not in a vial with a label on it\r\nfor a curiosity. All we got to do is to put it up in vials and float\r\naround all over the United States and peddle them out at ten cents\r\napiece. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got all of ten thousand dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of sand in this\r\nboat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMe and Jim went all to pieces with joy, and begun to shout\r\nwhoopjamboreehoo, and Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we can keep on coming back and fetching sand, and coming back and\r\nfetching more sand, and just keep it a-going till we\xe2\x80\x99ve carted this\r\nwhole Desert over there and sold it out; and there ain\xe2\x80\x99t ever going to\r\nbe any opposition, either, because we\xe2\x80\x99ll take out a patent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy goodness,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll be as rich as Creosote, won\xe2\x80\x99t we, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94Creesus, you mean. Why, that dervish was hunting in that little\r\nhill for the treasures of the earth, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was walking\r\nover the real ones for a thousand miles. He was blinder than he made\r\nthe driver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, how much is we gwyne to be worth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet. It\xe2\x80\x99s got to be ciphered, and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\neasiest job to do, either, because it\xe2\x80\x99s over four million square miles\r\nof sand at ten cents a vial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim was awful excited, but this faded it out considerable, and he shook\r\nhis head and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, we can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ford all dem vials\xe2\x80\x94a king couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. We better not\r\ntry to take de whole Desert, Mars Tom, de vials gwyne to bust us,\r\nsho\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s excitement died out, too, now, and I reckoned it was on account\r\nof the vials, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. He set there thinking, and got bluer and\r\nbluer, and at last he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys, it won\xe2\x80\x99t work; we got to give it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn account of the duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make nothing out of that, neither could Jim. I says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ our duty, Tom? Because if we can\xe2\x80\x99t git around it, why can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe just _do_ it? People often has to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t that kind of duty. The kind I mean is a tax. Whenever you\r\nstrike a frontier\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the border of a country, you know\xe2\x80\x94you find a\r\ncustom-house there, and the gov\xe2\x80\x99ment officers comes and rummages among\r\nyour things and charges a big tax, which they call a duty because it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntheir duty to bust you if they can, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t pay the duty\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll hog your sand. They call it confiscating, but that don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeceive nobody, it\xe2\x80\x99s just hogging, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all it is. Now if we try\r\nto carry this sand home the way we\xe2\x80\x99re pointed now, we got to climb\r\nfences till we git tired\xe2\x80\x94just frontier after frontier\xe2\x80\x94Egypt, Arabia,\r\nHindostan, and so on, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll all whack on a duty, and so you see,\r\neasy enough, we _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ go _that_ road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can sail right over their old frontiers; how\r\nare _they_ going to stop us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked sorrowful at me, and says, very grave:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuck Finn, do you think that would be honest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hate them kind of interruptions. I never said nothing, and he went\r\non:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99re shut off the other way, too. If we go back the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ncome, there\xe2\x80\x99s the New York custom-house, and that is worse than all of\r\nthem others put together, on account of the kind of cargo we\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they can\xe2\x80\x99t raise Sahara sand in America, of course, and when\r\nthey can\xe2\x80\x99t raise a thing there, the duty is fourteen hundred thousand\r\nper cent. on it if you try to fetch it in from where they do raise it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no sense in that, Tom Sawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho said there _was?_ What do you talk to me like that for, Huck Finn?\r\nYou wait till I say a thing\xe2\x80\x99s got sense in it before you go to accusing\r\nme of saying it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, consider me crying about it, and sorry. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, do dey jam dat duty onto everything we can\xe2\x80\x99t raise in\r\nAmerica, en don\xe2\x80\x99t make no \xe2\x80\x99stinction \xe2\x80\x99twix\xe2\x80\x99 anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, ain\xe2\x80\x99t de blessin\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 de Lord de mos\xe2\x80\x99 valuable thing dey is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t de preacher stan\xe2\x80\x99 up in de pulpit en call it down on de people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhah do it come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYassir! you\xe2\x80\x99s jes\xe2\x80\x99 right, \xe2\x80\x99deed you is, honey\xe2\x80\x94it come from heaven, en\r\ndat\xe2\x80\x99s a foreign country. _Now_, den! do dey put a tax on dat blessin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse dey don\xe2\x80\x99t; en so it stan\xe2\x80\x99 to reason dat you\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken, Mars\r\nTom. Dey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put de tax on po\xe2\x80\x99 truck like san\xe2\x80\x99, dat everybody\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99bleeged to have, en leave it off\xe2\x80\x99n de bes\xe2\x80\x99 thing dey is, which\r\nnobody can\xe2\x80\x99t git along widout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom Sawyer was stumped; he see Jim had got him where he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t budge.\r\nHe tried to wiggle out by saying they had _forgot_ to put on that tax,\r\nbut they\xe2\x80\x99d be sure to remember about it, next session of Congress, and\r\nthen they\xe2\x80\x99d put it on, but that was a poor lame come-off, and he knowed\r\nit. He said there warn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing foreign that warn\xe2\x80\x99t taxed but just\r\nthat one, and so they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be consistent without taxing it, and to\r\nbe consistent was the first law of politics. So he stuck to it that\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d left it out unintentional and would be certain to do their best\r\nto fix it before they got caught and laughed at.\r\n\r\nBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel no more interest in such things, as long as we\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t git our sand through, and it made me low-spirited, and Jim the\r\nsame. Tom he tried to cheer us up by saying he would think up another\r\nspeculation for us that would be just as good as this one and better,\r\nbut it didn\xe2\x80\x99t do no good, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe there was any as big as\r\nthis. It was mighty hard; such a little while ago we was so rich, and\r\ncould \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 bought a country and started a kingdom and been celebrated\r\nand happy, and now we was so poor and ornery again, and had our sand\r\nleft on our hands. The sand was looking so lovely before, just like\r\ngold and di\xe2\x80\x99monds, and the feel of it was so soft and so silky and\r\nnice, but now I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear the sight of it, it made me sick to look\r\nat it, and I knowed I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever feel comfortable again till we got\r\nshut of it, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it there no more to remind us of what we\r\nhad been and what we had got degraded down to. The others was feeling\r\nthe same way about it that I was. I knowed it, because they cheered up\r\nso, the minute I says le\xe2\x80\x99s throw this truck overboard.\r\n\r\nWell, it was going to be work, you know, and pretty solid work, too; so\r\nTom he divided it up according to fairness and strength. He said me and\r\nhim would clear out a fifth apiece of the sand, and Jim three-fifths.\r\nJim he didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite like that arrangement. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourse I\xe2\x80\x99s de stronges\xe2\x80\x99, en I\xe2\x80\x99s willin\xe2\x80\x99 to do a share accordin\xe2\x80\x99, but\r\nby jings you\xe2\x80\x99s kinder pilin\xe2\x80\x99 it onto ole Jim, Mars Tom, hain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so, Jim, but you try your hand at fixing it, and\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Jim reckoned it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be no more than fair if me and Tom done a\r\n_tenth_ apiece. Tom he turned his back to git room and be private, and\r\nthen he smole a smile that spread around and covered the whole Sahara\r\nto the westward, back to the Atlantic edge of it where we come from.\r\nThen he turned around again and said it was a good enough arrangement,\r\nand we was satisfied if Jim was. Jim said he was.\r\n\r\nSo then Tom measured off our two-tenths in the bow and left the rest\r\nfor Jim, and it surprised Jim a good deal to see how much difference\r\nthere was and what a raging lot of sand his share come to, and said he\r\nwas powerful glad now that he had spoke up in time and got the first\r\narrangement altered, for he said that even the way it was now, there\r\nwas more sand than enjoyment in his end of the contract, he believed.\r\n\r\nThen we laid into it. It was mighty hot work, and tough; so hot we had\r\nto move up into cooler weather or we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 stood it. Me and Tom\r\ntook turn about, and one worked while t\xe2\x80\x99other rested, but there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnobody to spell poor old Jim, and he made all that part of Africa damp,\r\nhe sweated so. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t work good, we was so full of laugh, and Jim\r\nhe kept fretting and wanting to know what tickled us so, and we had to\r\nkeep making up things to account for it, and they was pretty poor\r\ninventions, but they done well enough, Jim didn\xe2\x80\x99t see through them. At\r\nlast when we got done we was \xe2\x80\x99most dead, but not with work but with\r\nlaughing. By and by Jim was \xe2\x80\x99most dead, too, but: it was with work;\r\nthen we took turns and spelled him, and he was as thankfull as he could\r\nbe, and would set on the gunnel and swab the sweat, and heave and pant,\r\nand say how good we was to a poor old nigger, and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nforgit us. He was always the gratefulest nigger I ever see, for any\r\nlittle thing you done for him. He was only nigger outside; inside he\r\nwas as white as you be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nJIM STANDING SIEGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next few meals was pretty sandy, but that don\xe2\x80\x99t make no difference\r\nwhen you are hungry; and when you ain\xe2\x80\x99t it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no satisfaction to\r\neat, anyway, and so a little grit in the meat ain\xe2\x80\x99t no particular\r\ndrawback, as far as I can see.\r\n\r\nThen we struck the east end of the Desert at last, sailing on a\r\nnortheast course. Away off on the edge of the sand, in a soft pinky\r\nlight, we see three little sharp roofs like tents, and Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the pyramids of Egypt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt made my heart fairly jump. You see, I had seen a many and a many a\r\npicture of them, and heard tell about them a hundred times, and yet to\r\ncome on them all of a sudden, that way, and find they was _real_,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99stead of imaginations, \xe2\x80\x99most knocked the breath out of me with\r\nsurprise. It\xe2\x80\x99s a curious thing, that the more you hear about a grand\r\nand big and bully thing or person, the more it kind of dreamies out, as\r\nyou may say, and gets to be a big dim wavery figger made out of\r\nmoonshine and nothing solid to it. It\xe2\x80\x99s just so with George Washington,\r\nand the same with them pyramids.\r\n\r\nAnd moreover, besides, the thing they always said about them seemed to\r\nme to be stretchers. There was a feller come to the Sunday-school once,\r\nand had a picture of them, and made a speech, and said the biggest\r\npyramid covered thirteen acres, and was most five hundred foot high,\r\njust a steep mountain, all built out of hunks of stone as big as a\r\nbureau, and laid up in perfectly regular layers, like stair-steps.\r\nThirteen acres, you see, for just one building; it\xe2\x80\x99s a farm. If it\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been in Sunday-school, I would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 judged it was a lie; and\r\noutside I was certain of it. And he said there was a hole in the\r\npyramid, and you could go in there with candles, and go ever so far up\r\na long slanting tunnel, and come to a large room in the stomach of that\r\nstone mountain, and there you would find a big stone chest with a king\r\nin it, four thousand years old. I said to myself, then, if that ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nlie I will eat that king if they will fetch him, for even Methusalem\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t that old, and nobody claims it.\r\n\r\nAs we come a little nearer we see the yaller sand come to an end in a\r\nlong straight edge like a blanket, and on to it was joined, edge to\r\nedge, a wide country of bright green, with a snaky stripe crooking\r\nthrough it, and Tom said it was the Nile. It made my heart jump again,\r\nfor the Nile was another thing that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t real to me. Now I can tell\r\nyou one thing which is dead certain: if you will fool along over three\r\nthousand miles of yaller sand, all glimmering with heat so that it\r\nmakes your eyes water to look at it, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a considerable\r\npart of a week doing it, the green country will look so like home and\r\nheaven to you that it will make your eyes water _again_.\r\n\r\nIt was just so with me, and the same with Jim.\r\n\r\nAnd when Jim got so he could believe it _was_ the land of Egypt he was\r\nlooking at, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t enter it standing up, but got down on his knees\r\nand took off his hat, because he said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fitten\xe2\x80\x99 for a humble\r\npoor nigger to come any other way where such men had been as Moses and\r\nJoseph and Pharaoh and the other prophets. He was a Presbyterian, and\r\nhad a most deep respect for Moses which was a Presbyterian, too, he\r\nsaid. He was all stirred up, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHit\xe2\x80\x99s de lan\xe2\x80\x99 of Egypt, de lan\xe2\x80\x99 of Egypt, en I\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99lowed to look at it\r\nwid my own eyes! En dah\xe2\x80\x99s de river dat was turn\xe2\x80\x99 to blood, en I\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlooking at de very same groun\xe2\x80\x99 whah de plagues was, en de lice, en de\r\nfrogs, en de locus\xe2\x80\x99, en de hail, en whah dey marked de door-pos\xe2\x80\x99, en de\r\nangel o\xe2\x80\x99 de Lord come by in de darkness o\xe2\x80\x99 de night en slew de\r\nfust-born in all de lan\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 Egypt. Ole Jim ain\xe2\x80\x99t worthy to see dis\r\nday!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he just broke down and cried, he was so thankful. So between\r\nhim and Tom there was talk enough, Jim being excited because the land\r\nwas so full of history\xe2\x80\x94Joseph and his brethren, Moses in the\r\nbulrushers, Jacob coming down into Egypt to buy corn, the silver cup in\r\nthe sack, and all them interesting things; and Tom just as excited too,\r\nbecause the land was so full of history that was in _his_ line, about\r\nNoureddin, and Bedreddin, and such like monstrous giants, that made\r\nJim\xe2\x80\x99s wool rise, and a raft of other Arabian Nights folks, which the\r\nhalf of them never done the things they let on they done, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nThen we struck a disappointment, for one of them early morning fogs\r\nstarted up, and it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use to sail over the top of it, because we\r\nwould go by Egypt, sure, so we judged it was best to set her by compass\r\nstraight for the place where the pyramids was gitting blurred and\r\nblotted out, and then drop low and skin along pretty close to the\r\nground and keep a sharp lookout. Tom took the hellum, I stood by to let\r\ngo the anchor, and Jim he straddled the bow to dig through the fog with\r\nhis eyes and watch out for danger ahead. We went along a steady gait,\r\nbut not very fast, and the fog got solider and solider, so solid that\r\nJim looked dim and ragged and smoky through it. It was awful still, and\r\nwe talked low and was anxious. Now and then Jim would say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHighst her a p\xe2\x80\x99int, Mars Tom, highst her!\xe2\x80\x9d and up she would skip, a\r\nfoot or two, and we would slide right over a flat-roofed mud cabin,\r\nwith people that had been asleep on it just beginning to turn out and\r\ngap and stretch; and once when a feller was clear up on his hind legs\r\nso he could gap and stretch better, we took him a blip in the back and\r\nknocked him off. By and by, after about an hour, and everything dead\r\nstill and we a-straining our ears for sounds and holding our breath,\r\nthe fog thinned a little, very sudden, and Jim sung out in an awful\r\nscare:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for de lan\xe2\x80\x99s sake, set her back, Mars Tom, here\xe2\x80\x99s de biggest giant\r\nouten de \xe2\x80\x99Rabian Nights a-comin\xe2\x80\x99 for us!\xe2\x80\x9d and he went over backwards in\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\nTom slammed on the back-action, and as we slowed to a standstill a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s face as big as our house at home looked in over the gunnel, same\r\nas a house looks out of its windows, and I laid down and died. I must\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 been clear dead and gone for as much as a minute or more; then I\r\ncome to, and Tom had hitched a boat-hook on to the lower lip of the\r\ngiant and was holding the balloon steady with it whilst he canted his\r\nhead back and got a good long look up at that awful face.\r\n\r\nJim was on his knees with his hands clasped, gazing up at the thing in\r\na begging way, and working his lips, but not getting anything out. I\r\ntook only just a glimpse, and was fading out again, but Tom says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ain\xe2\x80\x99t alive, you fools; it\xe2\x80\x99s the Sphinx!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never see Tom look so little and like a fly; but that was because the\r\ngiant\xe2\x80\x99s head was so big and awful. Awful, yes, so it was, but not\r\ndreadful any more, because you could see it was a noble face, and kind\r\nof sad, and not thinking about you, but about other things and larger.\r\nIt was stone, reddish stone, and its nose and ears battered, and that\r\ngive it an abused look, and you felt sorrier for it for that.\r\n\r\nWe stood off a piece, and sailed around it and over it, and it was just\r\ngrand. It was a man\xe2\x80\x99s head, or maybe a woman\xe2\x80\x99s, on a tiger\xe2\x80\x99s body a\r\nhundred and twenty-five foot long, and there was a dear little temple\r\nbetween its front paws. All but the head used to be under the sand, for\r\nhundreds of years, maybe thousands, but they had just lately dug the\r\nsand away and found that little temple. It took a power of sand to bury\r\nthat cretur; most as much as it would to bury a steamboat, I reckon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cJim standing a siege\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nWe landed Jim on top of the head, with an American flag to protect him,\r\nit being a foreign land; then we sailed off to this and that and\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other distance, to git what Tom called effects and perspectives and\r\nproportions, and Jim he done the best he could, striking all the\r\ndifferent kinds of attitudes and positions he could study up, but\r\nstanding on his head and working his legs the way a frog does was the\r\nbest. The further we got away, the littler Jim got, and the grander the\r\nSphinx got, till at last it was only a clothespin on a dome, as you\r\nmight say. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way perspective brings out the correct\r\nproportions, Tom said; he said Julus Cesar\xe2\x80\x99s niggers didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nbig he was, they was too close to him.\r\n\r\nThen we sailed off further and further, till we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see Jim at all\r\nany more, and then that great figger was at its noblest, a-gazing out\r\nover the Nile Valley so still and solemn and lonesome, and all the\r\nlittle shabby huts and things that was scattered about it clean\r\ndisappeared and gone, and nothing around it now but a soft wide spread\r\nof yaller velvet, which was the sand.\r\n\r\nThat was the right place to stop, and we done it. We set there\r\na-looking and a-thinking for a half an hour, nobody a-saying anything,\r\nfor it made us feel quiet and kind of solemn to remember it had been\r\nlooking over that valley just that same way, and thinking its awful\r\nthoughts all to itself for thousands of years, and nobody can\xe2\x80\x99t find\r\nout what they are to this day.\r\n\r\nAt last I took up the glass and see some little black things a-capering\r\naround on that velvet carpet, and some more a-climbing up the cretur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nback, and then I see two or three wee puffs of white smoke, and told\r\nTom to look. He done it, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re bugs. No\xe2\x80\x94hold on; they\xe2\x80\x94why, I believe they\xe2\x80\x99re men. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x94men and horses both. They\xe2\x80\x99re hauling a long ladder up onto the\r\nSphinx\xe2\x80\x99s back\xe2\x80\x94now ain\xe2\x80\x99t that odd? And now they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to lean it up\r\na\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s some more puffs of smoke\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s guns! Huck, they\xe2\x80\x99re after Jim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cRescue of Jim\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nWe clapped on the power, and went for them a-biling. We was there in no\r\ntime, and come a-whizzing down amongst them, and they broke and\r\nscattered every which way, and some that was climbing the ladder after\r\nJim let go all holts and fell. We soared up and found him laying on top\r\nof the head panting and most tuckered out, partly from howling for help\r\nand partly from scare. He had been standing a siege a long time\xe2\x80\x94a week,\r\n_he_ said, but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t so, it only just seemed so to him because they\r\nwas crowding him so. They had shot at him, and rained the bullets all\r\naround him, but he warn\xe2\x80\x99t hit, and when they found he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand up\r\nand the bullets couldn\xe2\x80\x99t git at him when he was laying down, they went\r\nfor the ladder, and then he knowed it was all up with him if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome pretty quick. Tom was very indignant, and asked him why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshow the flag and command them to _git_, in the name of the United\r\nStates. Jim said he done it, but they never paid no attention. Tom said\r\nhe would have this thing looked into at Washington, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to apologize for insulting the flag, and\r\npay an indemnity, too, on top of it even if they git off _that_ easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s an indemnity, Mars Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s cash, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gits it, Mars Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, _we_ do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEn who gits de apology?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe United States. Or, we can take whichever we please. We can take\r\nthe apology, if we want to, and let the gov\xe2\x80\x99ment take the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much money will it be, Mars Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in an aggravated case like this one, it will be at least three\r\ndollars apiece, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know but more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, den, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take de money, Mars Tom, blame de \xe2\x80\x99pology. Hain\xe2\x80\x99t dat\r\nyo\xe2\x80\x99 notion, too? En hain\xe2\x80\x99t it yourn, Huck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe talked it over a little and allowed that that was as good a way as\r\nany, so we agreed to take the money. It was a new business to me, and I\r\nasked Tom if countries always apologized when they had done wrong, and\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; the little ones does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe was sailing around examining the pyramids, you know, and now we\r\nsoared up and roosted on the flat top of the biggest one, and found it\r\nwas just like what the man said in the Sunday-school. It was like four\r\npairs of stairs that starts broad at the bottom and slants up and comes\r\ntogether in a point at the top, only these stair-steps couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nclumb the way you climb other stairs; no, for each step was as high as\r\nyour chin, and you have to be boosted up from behind. The two other\r\npyramids warn\xe2\x80\x99t far away, and the people moving about on the sand\r\nbetween looked like bugs crawling, we was so high above them.\r\n\r\nTom he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold himself he was so worked up with gladness and\r\nastonishment to be in such a celebrated place, and he just dripped\r\nhistory from every pore, seemed to me. He said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t scarcely\r\nbelieve he was standing on the very identical spot the prince flew from\r\non the Bronze Horse. It was in the Arabian Night times, he said.\r\nSomebody give the prince a bronze horse with a peg in its shoulder, and\r\nhe could git on him and fly through the air like a bird, and go all\r\nover the world, and steer it by turning the peg, and fly high or low\r\nand land wherever he wanted to.\r\n\r\nWhen he got done telling it there was one of them uncomfortable\r\nsilences that comes, you know, when a person has been telling a whopper\r\nand you feel sorry for him and wish you could think of some way to\r\nchange the subject and let him down easy, but git stuck and don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nno way, and before you can pull your mind together and _do_ something,\r\nthat silence has got in and spread itself and done the business. I was\r\nembarrassed, Jim he was embarrassed, and neither of us couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say a\r\nword. Well, Tom he glowered at me a minute, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, out with it. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer, _you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that, yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the reason I don\xe2\x80\x99t? What\xe2\x80\x99s to hender me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to hender you: it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the reason it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tell me the reason it _could_ happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis balloon is a good enough reason it could happen, I should\r\nreckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Why_ is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Why_ is it? I never saw such an idiot. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t this balloon and the\r\nbronze horse the same thing under different names?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they\xe2\x80\x99re not. One is a balloon and the other\xe2\x80\x99s a horse. It\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\ndifferent. Next you\xe2\x80\x99ll be saying a house and a cow is the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jackson, Huck\xe2\x80\x99s got him ag\xe2\x80\x99in! Dey ain\xe2\x80\x99t no wigglin\xe2\x80\x99 outer dat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut your head, Jim; you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. And\r\nHuck don\xe2\x80\x99t. Look here, Huck, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it plain to you, so you can\r\nunderstand. You see, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t the mere _form_ that\xe2\x80\x99s got anything to do\r\nwith their being similar or unsimilar, it\xe2\x80\x99s the _principle_ involved;\r\nand the principle is the same in both. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned it over in my mind, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use. Principles is all very well, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t git\r\naround that one big fact, that the thing that a balloon can do ain\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nsort of proof of what a horse can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks, Huck, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get the idea at all. Now look here a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly plain. Don\xe2\x80\x99t we fly through the air?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Don\xe2\x80\x99t we fly high or fly low, just as we please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t we steer whichever way we want to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t we land when and where we please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do we move the balloon and steer it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy touching the buttons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ I reckon the thing is clear to you at last. In the other case\r\nthe moving and steering was done by turning a peg. We touch a button,\r\nthe prince turned a peg. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t an atom of difference, you see. I\r\nknowed I could git it through your head if I stuck to it long enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt so happy he begun to whistle. But me and Jim was silent, so he\r\nbroke off surprised, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooky here, Huck Finn, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see it _yet?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Sawyer, I want to ask you some questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, and I see Jim chirk up to listen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I understand it, the whole thing is in the buttons and the peg\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nrest ain\xe2\x80\x99t of no consequence. A button is one shape, a peg is another\r\nshape, but that ain\xe2\x80\x99t any matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that ain\xe2\x80\x99t any matter, as long as they\xe2\x80\x99ve both got the same\r\npower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then. What is the power that\xe2\x80\x99s in a candle and in a match?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same in both, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, just the same in both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Suppose I set fire to a carpenter shop with a match, what\r\nwill happen to that carpenter shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll burn up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd suppose I set fire to this pyramid with a candle\xe2\x80\x94will she burn\r\nup?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course she won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Now the fire\xe2\x80\x99s the same, both times. _Why_ does the shop\r\nburn, and the pyramid don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the pyramid _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ burn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! and _a horse can\xe2\x80\x99t fly!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lan\xe2\x80\x99, ef Huck ain\xe2\x80\x99t got him ag\xe2\x80\x99in! Huck\xe2\x80\x99s landed him high en dry\r\ndis time, I tell you! Hit\xe2\x80\x99s de smartes\xe2\x80\x99 trap I ever see a body walk\r\ninter\xe2\x80\x94en ef I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Jim was so full of laugh he got to strangling and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on,\r\nand Tom was that mad to see how neat I had floored him, and turned his\r\nown argument ag\xe2\x80\x99in him and knocked him all to rags and flinders with\r\nit, that all he could manage to say was that whenever he heard me and\r\nJim try to argue it made him ashamed of the human race. I never said\r\nnothing; I was feeling pretty well satisfied. When I have got the best\r\nof a person that way, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t my way to go around crowing about it the\r\nway some people does, for I consider that if I was in his place I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish him to crow over me. It\xe2\x80\x99s better to be generous, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nGOING FOR TOM\xe2\x80\x99S PIPE:\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by we left Jim to float around up there in the neighborhood of\r\nthe pyramids, and we clumb down to the hole where you go into the\r\ntunnel, and went in with some Arabs and candles, and away in there in\r\nthe middle of the pyramid we found a room and a big stone box in it\r\nwhere they used to keep that king, just as the man in the Sunday-school\r\nsaid; but he was gone, now; somebody had got him. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take no\r\ninterest in the place, because there could be ghosts there, of course;\r\nnot fresh ones, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like no kind.\r\n\r\nSo then we come out and got some little donkeys and rode a piece, and\r\nthen went in a boat another piece, and then more donkeys, and got to\r\nCairo; and all the way the road was as smooth and beautiful a road as\r\never I see, and had tall date-pa\xe2\x80\x99ms on both sides, and naked children\r\neverywhere, and the men was as red as copper, and fine and strong and\r\nhandsome. And the city was a curiosity. Such narrow streets\xe2\x80\x94why, they\r\nwere just lanes, and crowded with people with turbans, and women with\r\nveils, and everybody rigged out in blazing bright clothes and all sorts\r\nof colors, and you wondered how the camels and the people got by each\r\nother in such narrow little cracks, but they done it\xe2\x80\x94a perfect jam, you\r\nsee, and everybody noisy. The stores warn\xe2\x80\x99t big enough to turn around\r\nin, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to go in; the storekeeper sat tailor fashion on\r\nhis counter, smoking his snaky long pipe, and had his things where he\r\ncould reach them to sell, and he was just as good as in the street, for\r\nthe camel-loads brushed him as they went by.\r\n\r\nNow and then a grand person flew by in a carriage with fancy dressed\r\nmen running and yelling in front of it and whacking anybody with a long\r\nrod that didn\xe2\x80\x99t get out of the way. And by and by along comes the\r\nSultan riding horseback at the head of a procession, and fairly took\r\nyour breath away his clothes was so splendid; and everybody fell flat\r\nand laid on his stomach while he went by. I forgot, but a feller helped\r\nme to remember. He was one that had a rod and run in front.\r\n\r\nThere was churches, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t know enough to keep Sunday; they\r\nkeep Friday and break the Sabbath. You have to take off your shoes when\r\nyou go in. There was crowds of men and boys in the church, setting in\r\ngroups on the stone floor and making no end of noise\xe2\x80\x94getting their\r\nlessons by heart, Tom said, out of the Koran, which they think is a\r\nBible, and people that knows better knows enough to not let on. I never\r\nsee such a big church in my life before, and most awful high, it was;\r\nit made you dizzy to look up; our village church at home ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ncircumstance to it; if you was to put it in there, people would think\r\nit was a drygoods box.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to see was a dervish, because I was interested in\r\ndervishes on accounts of the one that played the trick on the\r\ncamel-driver. So we found a lot in a kind of a church, and they called\r\nthemselves Whirling Dervishes; and they did whirl, too. I never see\r\nanything like it. They had tall sugar-loaf hats on, and linen\r\npetticoats; and they spun and spun and spun, round and round like tops,\r\nand the petticoats stood out on a slant, and it was the prettiest thing\r\nI ever see, and made me drunk to look at it. They was all Moslems, Tom\r\nsaid, and when I asked him what a Moslem was, he said it was a person\r\nthat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a Presbyterian. So there is plenty of them in Missouri,\r\nthough I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it before.\r\n\r\nWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t see half there was to see in Cairo, because Tom was in such a\r\nsweat to hunt out places that was celebrated in history. We had a most\r\ntiresome time to find the granary where Joseph stored up the grain\r\nbefore the famine, and when we found it it warn\xe2\x80\x99t worth much to look\r\nat, being such an old tumble-down wreck; but Tom was satisfied, and\r\nmade more fuss over it than I would make if I stuck a nail in my foot.\r\nHow he ever found that place was too many for me. We passed as much as\r\nforty just like it before we come to it, and any of them would \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 done\r\nfor me, but none but just the right one would suit him; I never see\r\nanybody so particular as Tom Sawyer. The minute he struck the right one\r\nhe reconnized it as easy as I would reconnize my other shirt if I had\r\none, but how he done it he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t any more tell than he could fly; he\r\nsaid so himself.\r\n\r\nThen we hunted a long time for the house where the boy lived that\r\nlearned the cadi how to try the case of the old olives and the new\r\nones, and said it was out of the Arabian Nights, and he would tell me\r\nand Jim about it when he got time. Well, we hunted and hunted till I\r\nwas ready to drop, and I wanted Tom to give it up and come next day and\r\ngit somebody that knowed the town and could talk Missourian and could\r\ngo straight to the place; but no, he wanted to find it himself, and\r\nnothing else would answer. So on we went. Then at last the remarkablest\r\nthing happened I ever see. The house was gone\xe2\x80\x94gone hundreds of years\r\nago\xe2\x80\x94every last rag of it gone but just one mud brick. Now a person\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever believe that a backwoods Missouri boy that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever\r\nbeen in that town before could go and hunt that place over and find\r\nthat brick, but Tom Sawyer done it. I know he done it, because I see\r\nhim do it. I was right by his very side at the time, and see him see\r\nthe brick and see him reconnize it. Well, I says to myself, how _does_\r\nhe do it? Is it knowledge, or is it instink?\r\n\r\nNow there\xe2\x80\x99s the facts, just as they happened: let everybody explain it\r\ntheir own way. I\xe2\x80\x99ve ciphered over it a good deal, and it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion\r\nthat some of it is knowledge but the main bulk of it is instink. The\r\nreason is this: Tom put the brick in his pocket to give to a museum\r\nwith his name on it and the facts when he went home, and I slipped it\r\nout and put another brick considerable like it in its place, and he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know the difference\xe2\x80\x94but there was a difference, you see. I think\r\nthat settles it\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s mostly instink, not knowledge. Instink tells him\r\nwhere the exact _place_ is for the brick to be in, and so he reconnizes\r\nit by the place it\xe2\x80\x99s in, not by the look of the brick. If it was\r\nknowledge, not instink, he would know the brick again by the look of it\r\nthe next time he seen it\xe2\x80\x94which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. So it shows that for all the\r\nbrag you hear about knowledge being such a wonderful thing, instink is\r\nworth forty of it for real unerringness. Jim says the same.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back Jim dropped down and took us in, and there was a young\r\nman there with a red skullcap and tassel on and a beautiful silk jacket\r\nand baggy trousers with a shawl around his waist and pistols in it that\r\ncould talk English and wanted to hire to us as guide and take us to\r\nMecca and Medina and Central Africa and everywheres for a half a dollar\r\na day and his keep, and we hired him and left, and piled on the power,\r\nand by the time we was through dinner we was over the place where the\r\nIsraelites crossed the Red Sea when Pharaoh tried to overtake them and\r\nwas caught by the waters. We stopped, then, and had a good look at the\r\nplace, and it done Jim good to see it. He said he could see it all,\r\nnow, just the way it happened; he could see the Israelites walking\r\nalong between the walls of water, and the Egyptians coming, from away\r\noff yonder, hurrying all they could, and see them start in as the\r\nIsraelites went out, and then when they was all in, see the walls\r\ntumble together and drown the last man of them. Then we piled on the\r\npower again and rushed away and huvvered over Mount Sinai, and saw the\r\nplace where Moses broke the tables of stone, and where the children of\r\nIsrael camped in the plain and worshiped the golden calf, and it was\r\nall just as interesting as could be, and the guide knowed every place\r\nas well as I knowed the village at home.\r\n\r\nBut we had an accident, now, and it fetched all the plans to a\r\nstandstill. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s old ornery corn-cob pipe had got so old and swelled\r\nand warped that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold together any longer, notwithstanding\r\nthe strings and bandages, but caved in and went to pieces. Tom he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know _what_ to do. The professor\xe2\x80\x99s pipe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer; it\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t anything but a mershum, and a person that\xe2\x80\x99s got used to a cob\r\npipe knows it lays a long ways over all the other pipes in this world,\r\nand you can\xe2\x80\x99t git him to smoke any other. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take mine, I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t persuade him. So there he was.\r\n\r\nHe thought it over, and said we must scour around and see if we could\r\nroust out one in Egypt or Arabia or around in some of these countries,\r\nbut the guide said no, it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have them. So Tom\r\nwas pretty glum for a little while, then he chirked up and said he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngot the idea and knowed what to do. He says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got another corn-cob pipe, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a prime one, too, and nearly\r\nnew. It\xe2\x80\x99s laying on the rafter that\xe2\x80\x99s right over the kitchen stove at\r\nhome in the village. Jim, you and the guide will go and get it, and me\r\nand Huck will camp here on Mount Sinai till you come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mars Tom, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever find de village. I could find de pipe,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99case I knows de kitchen, but my lan\xe2\x80\x99, we can\xe2\x80\x99t ever find de village,\r\nnur Sent Louis, nur none o\xe2\x80\x99 dem places. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know de way, Mars\r\nTom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was a fact, and it stumped Tom for a minute. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooky here, it can be done, sure; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how. You set your\r\ncompass and sail west as straight as a dart, till you find the United\r\nStates. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t any trouble, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the first land you\xe2\x80\x99ll strike\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic. If it\xe2\x80\x99s daytime when you strike it,\r\nbulge right on, straight west from the upper part of the Florida coast,\r\nand in an hour and three quarters you\xe2\x80\x99ll hit the mouth of the\r\nMississippi\xe2\x80\x94at the speed that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to send you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be so high\r\nup in the air that the earth will be curved considerable\xe2\x80\x94sorter like a\r\nwashbowl turned upside down\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a raft of rivers crawling\r\naround every which way, long before you get there, and you can pick out\r\nthe Mississippi without any trouble. Then you can follow the river\r\nnorth nearly, an hour and three quarters, till you see the Ohio come\r\nin; then you want to look sharp, because you\xe2\x80\x99re getting near. Away up\r\nto your left you\xe2\x80\x99ll see another thread coming in\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the Missouri\r\nand is a little above St. Louis. You\xe2\x80\x99ll come down low then, so as you\r\ncan examine the villages as you spin along. You\xe2\x80\x99ll pass about\r\ntwenty-five in the next fifteen minutes, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll recognize ours when\r\nyou see it\xe2\x80\x94and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you can yell down and ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cMap of the trip made by Tom Sawyer Erronott 1850\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEf it\xe2\x80\x99s dat easy, Mars Tom, I reckon we kin do it\xe2\x80\x94yassir, I knows we\r\nkin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe guide was sure of it, too, and thought that he could learn to stand\r\nhis watch in a little while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim can learn you the whole thing in a half an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nballoon\xe2\x80\x99s as easy to manage as a canoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom got out the chart and marked out the course and measured it, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go back west is the shortest way, you see. It\xe2\x80\x99s only about seven\r\nthousand miles. If you went east, and so on around, it\xe2\x80\x99s over twice as\r\nfar.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he says to the guide, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you both to watch the\r\ntell-tale all through the watches, and whenever it don\xe2\x80\x99t mark three\r\nhundred miles an hour, you go higher or drop lower till you find a\r\nstorm-current that\xe2\x80\x99s going your way. There\xe2\x80\x99s a hundred miles an hour in\r\nthis old thing without any wind to help. There\xe2\x80\x99s two-hundred-mile gales\r\nto be found, any time you want to hunt for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll hunt for them, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee that you do. Sometimes you may have to go up a couple of miles,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99ll be p\xe2\x80\x99ison cold, but most of the time you\xe2\x80\x99ll find your storm a\r\ngood deal lower. If you can only strike a cyclone\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the ticket for\r\nyou! You\xe2\x80\x99ll see by the professor\xe2\x80\x99s books that they travel west in these\r\nlatitudes; and they travel low, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he ciphered on the time, and says\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven thousand miles, three hundred miles an hour\xe2\x80\x94you can make the\r\ntrip in a day\xe2\x80\x94twenty-four hours. This is Thursday; you\xe2\x80\x99ll be back here\r\nSaturday afternoon. Come, now, hustle out some blankets and food and\r\nbooks and things for me and Huck, and you can start right along. There\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t no occasion to fool around\xe2\x80\x94I want a smoke, and the quicker you\r\nfetch that pipe the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll hands jumped for the things, and in eight minutes our things was\r\nout and the balloon was ready for America. So we shook hands good-bye,\r\nand Tom gave his last orders:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s 10 minutes to 2 P.M. now, Mount Sinai time. In 24 hours you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nhome, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be 6 to-morrow morning, village time. When you strike\r\nthe village, land a little back of the top of the hill, in the woods,\r\nout of sight; then you rush down, Jim, and shove these letters in the\r\npost-office, and if you see anybody stirring, pull your slouch down\r\nover your face so they won\xe2\x80\x99t know you. Then you go and slip in the back\r\nway to the kitchen and git the pipe, and lay this piece of paper on the\r\nkitchen table, and put something on it to hold it, and then slide out\r\nand git away, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let Aunt Polly catch a sight of you, nor nobody\r\nelse. Then you jump for the balloon and shove for Mount Sinai three\r\nhundred miles an hour. You won\xe2\x80\x99t have lost more than an hour. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstart back at 7 or 8 A.M., village time, and be here in 24 hours,\r\narriving at 2 or 3 P.M., Mount Sinai time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom he read the piece of paper to us. He had wrote on it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHURSDAY AFTERNOON. Tom Sawyer the Erronort sends his love to Aunt\r\nPolly from Mount Sinai where the Ark was, and so does Huck Finn, and\r\nshe will get it to-morrow morning half-past six.\xe2\x80\x9d*\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTOM SAWYER THE ERRONORT\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n* This misplacing of the Ark is probably Huck\xe2\x80\x99s error, not Tom\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x94M.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll make her eyes bulge out and the tears come,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. Then he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by! One\xe2\x80\x94two\xe2\x80\x94three\xe2\x80\x94away you go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd away she _did_ go! Why, she seemed to whiz out of sight in a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThen we found a most comfortable cave that looked out over the whole\r\nbig plain, and there we camped to wait for the pipe.\r\n\r\nThe balloon come back all right, and brung the pipe; but Aunt Polly had\r\ncatched Jim when he was getting it, and anybody can guess what\r\nhappened: she sent for Tom. So Jim he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMars Tom, she\xe2\x80\x99s out on de porch wid her eye sot on de sky a-layin\xe2\x80\x99 for\r\nyou, en she say she ain\xe2\x80\x99t gwyne to budge from dah tell she gits hold of\r\nyou. Dey\xe2\x80\x99s gwyne to be trouble, Mars Tom, \xe2\x80\x99deed dey is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo then we shoved for home, and not feeling very gay, neither.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cHomeward bound\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOM SAWYER ABROAD ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
