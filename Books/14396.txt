Not of _old_ New York--he had\r\nheard of that from old, old men when he himself had still been young and\r\nhad smiled at their garrulity. He was thinking of a _young_ New York, the\r\nmighty throbbing city to which he had come long ago as a lad from the New\r\nHampshire mountains. A place of turbulent thoroughfares, of shouting\r\ndrivers, hurrying crowds, the crack of whips and the clatter of wheels; an\r\nuproarious, thrilling town of enterprise, adventure, youth; a city of\r\npulsing energies, the center of a boundless land; a port of commerce with\r\nall the world, of stately ships with snowy sails; a fascinating pleasure\r\ntown, with throngs of eager travellers hurrying from the ferry boats and\r\nrolling off in hansom cabs to the huge hotels on Madison Square. A city\r\nwhere American faces were still to be seen upon all its streets, a cleaner\r\nand a kindlier town, with more courtesy in its life, less of the vulgar\r\nscramble. A city of houses, separate homes, of quiet streets with rustling\r\ntrees, with people on the doorsteps upon warm summer evenings and groups of\r\nyoungsters singing as they came trooping by in the dark. A place of music\r\nand romance. At the old opera house downtown, on those dazzling evenings\r\nwhen as a boy he had ushered there for the sake of hearing the music, how\r\nthe rich joy of being alive, of being young, of being loved, had shone out\r\nof women\'s eyes. Shimmering satins, dainty gloves and little jewelled\r\nslippers, shapely arms and shoulders, vivacious movements, nods and smiles,\r\nswift glances, ripples, bursts of laughter, an exciting hum of voices.\r\nThen silence, sudden darkness--and music, and the curtain. The great wide\r\ncurtain slowly rising....\r\n\r\nBut all that had passed away.\r\n\r\nRoger Gale was a rugged heavy man not quite sixty years of age. His broad,\r\nmassive features were already deeply furrowed, and there were two big\r\nflecks of white in his close-curling, grayish hair. He lived in a narrow\r\nred brick house down on the lower west side of the town, in a neighborhood\r\nswiftly changing. His wife was dead. He had no sons, but three grown\r\ndaughters, of whom the oldest, Edith, had been married many years. Laura\r\nand Deborah lived at home, but they were both out this evening. It was\r\nFriday, Edith\'s evening, and as was her habit she had come from her\r\napartment uptown to dine with her father and play chess. In the living\r\nroom, a cheerful place, with its lamp light and its shadows, its\r\nold-fashioned high-back chairs, its sofa, its book cases, its low marble\r\nmantel with the gilt mirror overhead, they sat at a small oval table in\r\nfront of a quiet fire of coals. And through the smoke of his cigar Roger\r\nwatched his daughter.\r\n\r\nEdith had four children, and was soon to have another. A small demure woman\r\nof thirty-five, with light soft hair and clear blue eyes and limbs softly\r\nrounded, the contour of her features was full with approaching maternity,\r\nbut there was a decided firmness in the lines about her little mouth. As he\r\nwatched her now, her father\'s eyes, deep set and gray and with signs of\r\nlong years of suffering in them, displayed a grave whimsical wistfulness.\r\nFor by the way she was playing the game he saw how old she thought him. Her\r\nplay was slow and absent-minded, and there came long periods when she did\r\nnot make a move. Then she would recall herself and look up with a little\r\naffectionate smile that showed she looked upon him as too heavy with his\r\nage to have noticed her small lapses.\r\n\r\nHe was grimly amused at her attitude, for he did not feel old at all. With\r\nthat whimsical hint of a smile which had grown to be a part of him, he\r\ntried various moves on the board to see how far he could go without\r\ninterrupting her reveries. He checkmated her, re-lit his cigar and waited\r\nuntil she should notice it. And when she did not notice, gravely he moved\r\nback his queen and let the game continue. How many hundreds of games, he\r\nthought, Edith must have played with him in the long years when his spirit\r\nwas dead, for her now to take such chances. Nearly every Friday evening for\r\nnearly sixteen years.\r\n\r\nBefore that, Judith his wife had been here. It was then that the city had\r\nbeen young, for to Roger it had always seemed as though he were just\r\nbeginning life. Into its joys and sorrows too he had groped his way as most\r\nof us do, and had never penetrated deep. But he had meant to, later on.\r\nWhen in his busy city days distractions had arisen, always he had promised\r\nhimself that sooner or later he would return to this interest or passion,\r\nfor the world still lay before him with its enthralling interests, its\r\nbeauties and its pleasures, its tasks and all its puzzles, intricate and\r\nbaffling, all some day to be explored.\r\n\r\nThis deep zest in Roger Gale had been bred in his boyhood on a farm up in\r\nthe New Hampshire mountains. There his family had lived for many\r\ngenerations. And from the old house, the huge shadowy barn and the crude\r\nlittle sawmill down the road; from animals, grown people and still more\r\nfrom other boys, from the meadows and the mountain above with its cliffs\r\nand caves and forests of pine, young Roger had discovered, even in those\r\nearly years, that life was fresh, abundant, new, with countless glad\r\nbeginnings.\r\n\r\nAt seventeen he had come to New York. There had followed hard struggles in\r\nlean years, but his rugged health had buoyed him up. And there had been\r\ngenial friendships and dreams and explorations, a search for romance, the\r\nstrange glory of love, a few furtive ventures that left him dismayed. But\r\nthough love had seemed sordid at such times it had brought him crude\r\nexultations. And if his existence had grown more obscure, it had been\r\nsomber only in patches, the main picture dazzling still. And still he had\r\nbeen just making starts.\r\n\r\nHe had ventured into the business world, clerking now at this, now at that,\r\nand always looking about him for some big opportunity. It had come and he\r\nhad seized it, despite the warnings of his friends. What a wild adventure\r\nit had been a bureau of news clippings, a business new and unheard of but\r\nhe had been sure that here was growth, he had worked at it day and night,\r\nand the business widening fast had revealed long ramifications which went\r\nwinding and stretching away into every phase of American life. And this\r\nlife was like a forest, boundless and impenetrable, up-springing,\r\nintertwining. How much could _he_ ever know of it all?\r\n\r\nThen had come his marriage. Judith\'s family had lived long in New York, but\r\nsome had died and others had scattered until only she was left. This house\r\nhad been hers, but she had been poor, so she had leased it to some friends.\r\nIt was through them he had met her here, and within a few weeks he had\r\nfallen in love. He had felt profound disgust for the few wild oats he had\r\nsown, and in his swift reaction he had overworshipped the girl, her beauty\r\nand her purity, until in a delicate way of her own she had hinted that he\r\nwas going too far, that she, too, was human and a passionate lover of\r\nliving, in spite of her low quiet voice and her demure and sober eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd what beginnings for Roger now, what a piling up of intimate joys,\r\nsurprises, shocks of happiness. There had come disappointments, too, sudden\r\nsevere little checks from his wife which had brought him occasional\r\nquestionings. This love had not been quite _all_ he had dreamed, this woman\r\nnot so ardent. He had glimpsed couples here and there that set him to\r\nimagining more consuming passions. Here again he had not explored very\r\ndeep. But he had dismissed regrets like these with only a slight\r\nreluctance. For if they had settled down a bit with the coming of their\r\nchildren, their love had grown rich in sympathies and silent\r\nunderstandings, in humorous enjoyment of their funny little daughters\'\r\nchattering like magpies in the genial old house. And they had looked\r\nhappily far ahead. What a woman she had been for plans. It had not been all\r\nsmooth sailing. There had come reverses in business, and at home one baby,\r\na boy, had died. But on they had gone and the years had swept by until he\r\nhad reached his forties. Absorbed in his growing business and in his\r\nthriving family, it had seemed to Roger still as though he were just\r\nstarting out.\r\n\r\nBut one day, quite suddenly, the house had become a strange place to him\r\nwith a strange remote figure in it, his wife. For he had learned that she\r\nmust die. There had followed terrible weeks. Then Judith had faced their\r\ndisaster. Little by little she had won back the old intimacy with her\r\nhusband; and through the slow but inexorable progress of her ailment, again\r\nthey had come together in long talks and plans for their children. At this\r\nsame chessboard, in this room, repeatedly she would stop the game and\r\nsmiling she would look into the future. At one such time she had said to\r\nhim,\r\n\r\n"I wonder if it won\'t be the same with the children as it has been with us.\r\nNo matter how long each one of them lives, won\'t their lives feel to them\r\nunfinished like ours, only just beginning? I wonder how far they will go.\r\nAnd then their children will grow up and it will be the same with them.\r\nUnfinished lives. Oh, dearie, what children all of us are."\r\n\r\nHe had put his arm around her then and had held her very tight. And feeling\r\nthe violent trembling of her husband\'s fierce revolt, slowly bending back\r\nher head and looking up into his eyes she had continued steadily:\r\n\r\n"And when you come after me, my dear, oh, how hungry I shall be for all you\r\nwill tell me. For you will live on in our children\'s lives."\r\n\r\nAnd she had asked him to promise her that.\r\n\r\nBut he had not kept his promise. For after Judith\'s dying he had felt\r\nhimself terribly alone, with eternity around him, his wife slipping far\r\naway. And the universe had grown stark and hard, impersonal, relentless,\r\ncold. A storm of doubts had attacked his faith. And though he had resisted\r\nlong, for his faith in God had been rooted deep in the mountains of New\r\nEngland, in the end it had been wrenched away, and with it he had lost all\r\nhope that either for Judith or himself was there any existence beyond the\r\ngrave. So death had come to Roger\'s soul. He had been deaf and blind to his\r\nchildren. Nights by the thousand spent alone. Like a gray level road in his\r\nmemory now was the story of his family.\r\n\r\nWhen had his spirit begun to awaken? He could not tell, it had been so\r\nslow. His second daughter, Deborah, who had stayed at home with her father\r\nwhen Laura had gone away to school, had done little things continually to\r\nrouse his interest in life. Edith\'s winsome babies had attracted him when\r\nthey came to the house. Laura had returned from school, a joyous creature,\r\ntall and slender, with snapping black eyes, and had soon made her presence\r\nfelt. One day in the early afternoon, as he entered the house there had\r\nburst on his ears a perfect gale of laughter; and peering through the\r\nporti\xe8res he had seen the dining-room full of young girls, a crew as wild\r\nas Laura herself. Hastily he had retreated upstairs. But he had enjoyed\r\nsuch glimpses. He had liked to see her fresh pretty gowns and to have her\r\ncome in and kiss him good-night.\r\n\r\nThen had come a sharp heavy jolt. His business had suffered from long\r\nneglect, and suddenly for two anxious weeks he had found himself facing\r\nbankruptcy. Edith\'s husband, a lawyer, had come to his aid and together\r\nthey had pulled out of the hole. But he had been forced to mortgage the\r\nhouse. And this had brought to a climax all the feelings of guiltiness\r\nwhich had so long been stirring within him over his failure to live up to\r\nthe promise he had made his wife.\r\n\r\nAnd so Roger had looked at his children.\r\n\r\nAnd at first to his profound surprise he had had it forced upon him that\r\nthese were three grown women, each equipped with her own peculiar feminine\r\ntraits and desires, the swift accumulations of lives which had expanded in\r\na city that had reared to the skies in the many years of his long sleep.\r\nBut very slowly, month by month, he had gained a second impression which\r\nseemed to him deeper and more real. To the eye they were grown women all,\r\nbut inwardly they were children still, each groping for her happiness and\r\neach held back as he had been, either by checks within herself or by the\r\ngay distractions of the absorbing city. He saw each of his daughters, parts\r\nof himself. And he remembered what Judith had said: "You will live on in\r\nour children\'s lives." And he began to get glimmerings of a new\r\nimmortality, made up of generations, an endless succession of other lives\r\nextending into the future.\r\n\r\nSome of all this he remembered now, in scattered fragments here and there.\r\nThen from somewhere far away a great bell began booming the hour, and it\r\nroused him from his revery. He had often heard the bell of late. A calm\r\ndeep-toned intruder, it had first struck in upon his attention something\r\nover two years ago. Vaguely he had wondered about it. Soon he had found it\r\nwas on the top of a tower a little to the north, one of the highest\r\npinnacles of this tumultuous modern town. But the bell was not tumultuous.\r\nAnd as he listened it seemed to say, "There is still time, but you have not\r\nlong."\r\n\r\nEdith, sitting opposite him, looked up at the sound with a stir of relief.\r\nTen o\'clock. It was time to go home.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what\'s keeping Bruce," she said. Bruce was still in his office\r\ndowntown. As a rule on Friday evenings he came with his wife to supper\r\nhere, but this week he had some new business on hand. Edith was vague about\r\nit. As she tried to explain she knitted her brows and said that Bruce was\r\nworking too hard. And her father grunted assent.\r\n\r\n"Bruce ought to knock off every summer," he said, "for a good solid month,\r\nor better two. Can\'t you bring him up to the mountains this year?" He\r\nreferred to the old New Hampshire home which he had kept as a summer place.\r\nBut Edith smiled at the idea.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I could bring him," she replied, "and in a week he\'d be perfectly\r\ncrazy to get back to his office again." She compressed her lips. "I know\r\nwhat he needs--and we\'ll do it some day, in spite of him."\r\n\r\n"A suburb, eh," her father said, and his face took on a look of dislike.\r\nThey had often talked of suburbs.\r\n\r\n"Yes," his daughter answered, "I\'ve picked out the very house." He threw at\r\nher a glance of impatience. He knew what had started her on this line.\r\nEdith\'s friend, Madge Deering, was living out in Morristown. All very well,\r\nhe reflected, but her case was not at all the same. He had known Madge\r\npretty well. Although the death of her husband had left her a widow at\r\ntwenty-nine, with four small daughters to bring up, she had gone on\r\ndeterminedly. Naturally smart and able, Madge was always running to town,\r\nkeeping up with all her friends and with every new fad and movement there,\r\nalthough she made fun of most of them. Twice she had taken her girls\r\nabroad. But Edith was quite different. In a suburb she would draw into her\r\nhouse and never grow another inch. And Bruce, poor devil, would commute and\r\ntake work home from the office. But Roger couldn\'t tell her that.\r\n\r\n"I\'d be sorry to see you do it," he said. "I\'d miss you up in the\r\nmountains."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'d come up in the summer," she answered. "I wouldn\'t miss the\r\nmountains for worlds!"\r\n\r\nThen they talked of summer plans. And soon again Edith\'s smooth pretty\r\nbrows were wrinkling absorbedly. It was hard in her planning not to be sure\r\nwhether her new baby would come in May or early June. It was only the first\r\nof April now. While she talked her father watched her. He liked her quiet\r\nfearlessness in facing the ordeal ahead. Into the bewildering city he felt\r\nher searching anxiously to find good things for her small brood, to make\r\nevery dollar count, to keep their little bodies strong, to guard their\r\nhungry little souls from many things she thought were bad. Of all his\r\ndaughters, he told himself, she was the one most like his wife.\r\n\r\nWhile she was talking Bruce came in. Of medium height and a wiry build, his\r\nquick kindly smile of greeting did not conceal the fine tight lines about\r\nhis mouth and between his eyes. His small trim moustache was black, but his\r\nhair already showed streaks of gray although he was not quite thirty-eight,\r\nand as he lit a cigarette his right hand twitched perceptibly.\r\n\r\nBruce Cunningham had married just after he left law school. He had worked\r\nin a law office which took receiverships by the score, and through managing\r\nbankrupt concerns by slow degrees he had made himself a financial surgeon.\r\nHe had set up an office of his own and was doing splendidly. But he worked\r\nunder fearful tension. Bruce had to deal with bankrupts who had barely\r\nclosed their eyes for weeks, men half out of their minds from the strain,\r\nthe struggle to keep up their heads in those angry waters of finance which\r\nRoger vaguely pictured as a giant whirlpool. Though honest enough in his\r\nown affairs, Bruce showed a genial relish for all the tricks of the savage\r\nworld which was as the breath to his nostrils. And at times he appeared so\r\nwise and keen he made Roger feel like a child. But again it was Bruce who\r\nseemed the child. He seemed to be so na\xefve at times, and Edith had him so\r\nunder her thumb. Roger liked to hear Bruce\'s stories of business, when\r\nEdith would let her husband talk. But this she would not often do, for she\r\nsaid Bruce needed rest at night. She reproved him now for staying so late,\r\nshe wrung from him the fact that he\'d had no supper.\r\n\r\n"Well, Bruce," she exclaimed impatiently, "now isn\'t that just like you?\r\nYou\'re going straight home--that\'s where you\'re going--"\r\n\r\n"To be fed up and put to bed," her husband grumbled good-naturedly. And\r\nwhile she made ready to bundle him off he turned to his father-in-law.\r\n\r\n"What do you think\'s my latest?" he asked, and he gave a low chuckle which\r\nRoger liked. "Last week I was a brewer, to-day I\'m an engineer," he said.\r\n"Can you beat it? A building contractor. Me." And as he smoked his\r\ncigarette, in laconic phrases he explained how a huge steel construction\r\nconcern had gone to the wall, through building skyscrapers "on spec" and\r\noutstripping even the growth of New York. "They got into court last week,"\r\nhe said, "and the judge handed me the receivership. The judge and I have\r\nbeen chums for years. He has hay fever--so do I."\r\n\r\n"Come, Bruce, I\'m ready," said his wife.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been in their office all day," he went on. "Their general manager was\r\nstark mad. He hadn\'t been out of the office since last Sunday night, he\r\nsaid. You had to ask him a question and wait--while he looked at you and\r\nheld onto his chair. He broke down and blubbered--the poor damn fool--he\'ll\r\nbe in Matteawan in a week--"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be there yourself if you don\'t come home," broke in Edith\'s voice\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n"And out of that poor devil, and out of the mess his books are in, I\'ve\r\nbeen learning engineering!"\r\n\r\nHe had followed his wife out on the steps. He turned back with a quick\r\nappealing smile:\r\n\r\n"Well, good-night--see you soon--"\r\n\r\n"Good-night, my boy," said Roger. "Good luck to the engineering."\r\n\r\n"Oh, father dear," cried Edith, from the taxi down below. "Remember supper\r\nSunday night--"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t forget," said Roger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe watched them start off up the street. The night was soft, refreshing,\r\nand the place was quiet and personal. The house was one of a dozen others,\r\nsome of red brick and some of brown stone, that stood in an uneven row on a\r\nstreet but a few rods in length, one side of a little triangular park\r\nenclosed by a low iron fence, inside of which were a few gnarled trees and\r\nthree or four park benches. On one of these benches his eye was caught by\r\nthe figure of an old woman there, and he stood a moment watching her, some\r\nmemory stirring in his mind.\r\n\r\nOccasionally somebody passed. Otherwise it was silent here. But even in the\r\nsilence could be felt the throes of change; the very atmosphere seemed\r\ncharged with drastic things impending. Already the opposite house line had\r\nbeen broken near the center by a high apartment building, and another still\r\nhigher rose like a cliff just back of the house in which Roger lived. Still\r\nothers, and many factory lofts, reared shadowy bulks on every hand. From\r\nthe top of one an enormous sign, a corset pictured forth in lights, flashed\r\nout at regular intervals; and from farther off, high up in the misty haze\r\nof the night, could be seen the gleaming pinnacle where hour by hour that\r\ngreat bell slowly boomed the time away. Yes, here the old was passing.\r\nAlready the tiny parklet was like the dark bottom of a pit, with the hard\r\nsparkling modern town towering on every side, slowly pressing, pressing in\r\nand glaring down with yellow eyes.\r\n\r\nBut Roger noticed none of these things. He watched the old woman on the\r\nbench and groped for the memory she had stirred. Ah, now at last he had it.\r\nAn April night long, long ago, when he had sat where she was now, while\r\nhere in the house his wife\'s first baby, Edith, had begun her life....\r\n\r\nSlowly he turned and went inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nRoger\'s hearing was extremely acute. Though the room where he was sitting,\r\nhis study, was at the back of the house, he heard Deborah\'s key at the\r\nstreet door and he heard the door softly open and close.\r\n\r\n"Are you there, dearie?" Her voice from the hallway was low; and his\r\nanswer, "Yes, child," was in the same tone, as though she were with him in\r\nthe room. This keen sense of hearing had long been a peculiar bond between\r\nthem. To her father, Deborah\'s voice was the most distinctive part of her,\r\nfor often as he listened the memory came of her voice as a girl,\r\nunpleasant, hurried and stammering. But she had overcome all that. "No\r\ngrown woman," she had declared, when she was eighteen, "has any excuse for\r\na voice like mine." That was eleven years ago; and the voice she had\r\nacquired since, with its sweet magnetic quality, its clear and easy\r\narticulation, was to him an expression of Deborah\'s growth. As she took off\r\nher coat and hat in the hall she said, in the same low tone as before,\r\n\r\n"Edith has been here, I suppose--"\r\n\r\n"Yes--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry I missed her. I tried to get home early, but it has been a\r\nbusy night."\r\n\r\nHer voice sounded tired, comfortably so, and she looked that way as she\r\ncame in. Though only a little taller than Edith, she was of a sturdier\r\nbuild and more decided features. Her mouth was large with a humorous droop\r\nand her face rather broad with high cheekbones. As she put her soft black\r\nhair up over her high forehead, her father noticed her birthmark, a faint\r\ncurving line of red running up from between her eyes. Imperceptible as a\r\nrule, it showed when she was tired. In the big school in the tenements\r\nwhere she had taught for many years, she gave herself hard without stint to\r\nher work, but she had such a good time through it all. She had a way, too,\r\nhe reflected, of always putting things in their place. As now she came in\r\nand kissed him and sank back on his leather lounge with a tranquil breath\r\nof relief, she seemed to be dropping school out of her life.\r\n\r\nRoger picked up his paper and continued his reading. Presently they would\r\nhave a talk, but first he knew that she wanted to lie quite still for a\r\nlittle while. Vaguely he pictured her work that night, her class-room\r\npacked to bursting with small Jews and Italians, and Deborah at the\r\nblackboard with a long pointer in her hand. The fact that for the last two\r\nyears she had been the principal of her school had made little impression\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nAnd meanwhile, as she lay back with eyes closed, her mind still taut from\r\nthe evening called up no simple class-room but far different places--a mass\r\nmeeting in Carnegie Hall where she had just been speaking, some schools\r\nwhich she had visited out in Indiana, a block of tenements far downtown and\r\nthe private office of the mayor. For her school had long curious arms these\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n"Was Bruce here too this evening?" she asked her father presently. Roger\r\nfinished what he was reading, then looked over to the lounge, which was in\r\na shadowy corner.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he came in late." And he went on to tell her of Bruce\'s\r\n"engineering." At once she was interested. Rising on one elbow she\r\nquestioned him good-humoredly, for Deborah was fond of Bruce.\r\n\r\n"Has he bought that automobile he wanted?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied her father. "Edith said they couldn\'t afford it."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"This time it\'s the dentist\'s bills. Young Betsy\'s teeth aren\'t\r\nstraightened yet--and as soon as she\'s been beautified they\'re going to put\r\nthe clamps on George."\r\n\r\n"Poor Georgie," Deborah murmured. At the look of pain and disapproval on\r\nher father\'s heavy face, she smiled quietly to herself. George, who was\r\nEdith\'s oldest and the worry of her days, was Roger\'s favorite grandson.\r\n"Has he been bringing home any more sick dogs?"\r\n\r\n"No, this time it was a rat--a white one," Roger answered. A glint of dry\r\nrelish appeared in his eyes. "George brought it home the other night. He\r\nhad on a pair of ragged old pants."\r\n\r\n"What on earth--"\r\n\r\n"He had traded his own breeches for the rat," said Roger placidly.\r\n\r\n"No! Oh, father! Really!" And she sank back laughing on the lounge.\r\n\r\n"His school report," said Roger, "was quite as bad as ever."\r\n\r\n"Of course it was," said Deborah. And she spoke so sharply that her father\r\nglanced at her in surprise. She was up again on one elbow, and there was an\r\neager expression on her bright attractive face. "Do you know what we\'re\r\ngoing to do some day? We\'re going to put the rat in the school," Deborah\r\nsaid impatiently. "We\'re going to take a boy like George and study him till\r\nwe think we know just what interests him most. And if in his case it\'s\r\nanimals, we\'ll have a regular zoo in school. And for other boys we\'ll have\r\nother things they really want to know about. And we\'ll keep them until five\r\no\'clock--when their mothers will have to drag them away." Her father looked\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\n"But arithmetic, my dear."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find they\'ll have learned their arithmetic without knowing it,"\r\nDeborah answered.\r\n\r\n"Sounds a bit wild," murmured Roger. Again to his mind came the picture of\r\nhordes of little Italians and Jews. "My dear, if I had _your children_ to\r\nteach, I don\'t think I\'d add a zoo," he said. And with a breath of\r\ndiscomfort he turned back to his reading. He knew that he ought to question\r\nher, to show an interest in her work. But he had a deep aversion for those\r\nmillions of foreign tenement people, always shoving, shoving upward through\r\nthe filth of their surroundings. They had already spoiled his neighborhood,\r\nthey had flowed up like an ocean tide. And so he read his paper, frowning\r\nguiltily down at the page. He glanced up in a little while and saw Deborah\r\nsmiling across at him, reading his dislike of such talk. The smile which he\r\nsent back at her was half apologetic, half an appeal for mercy. And Deborah\r\nseemed to understand. She went into the living room, and there at the piano\r\nshe was soon playing softly. Listening from his study, again the feeling\r\ncame to him of her fresh and abundant vitality. He mused a little enviously\r\non how it must feel to be strong like that, never really tired.\r\n\r\nAnd while her father thought in this wise, Deborah at the piano, leaning\r\nback with eyes half closed, could feel her tortured nerves relax, could\r\nfeel her pulse stop throbbing so and the dull aching at her temples little\r\nby little pass away. She played like this so many nights. Soon she would be\r\nready for sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter she had gone to bed, Roger rose heavily from his chair. By long habit\r\nhe went about the house trying the windows and turning out lights. Last he\r\ncame to the front door. There were double outer doors with a ponderous\r\nsystem of locks and bolts and a heavy chain. Mechanically he fastened them\r\nall; and putting out the light in the hall, in the darkness he went up the\r\nstairs. He could so easily feel his way. He put his hand lightly, first on\r\nthe foot of the banister, then on a curve in it halfway up, again on the\r\nsharper curve at the top and last on the knob of his bedroom door. And it\r\nwas as though these guiding objects came out to meet him like old friends.\r\n\r\nIn his bedroom, while he slowly undressed, his glance was caught by the\r\npicture upon the wall opposite his bed, a little landscape poster done in\r\nrestful tones of blue, of two herdsmen and their cattle far up on a\r\nmountainside in the hour just before the dawn, tiny clear-cut silhouettes\r\nagainst the awakening eastern sky. So immense and still, this birth of the\r\nday--the picture always gave him the feeling of life everlasting. Judith\r\nhis wife had placed it there.\r\n\r\nFrom his bed through the window close beside him he looked up at the\r\ncliff-like wall of the new apartment building, with tier upon tier of\r\nwindows from which murmurous voices dropped out of the dark: now soft, now\r\nsuddenly angry, loud; now droning, sullen, bitter, hard; now gay with\r\nlittle screams of mirth; now low and amorous, drowsy sounds. Tier upon tier\r\nof modern homes, all overhanging Roger\'s house as though presently to crush\r\nit down.\r\n\r\nBut Roger was not thinking of that. He was thinking of his children--of\r\nEdith\'s approaching confinement and all her anxious hunting about to find\r\nwhat was best for her family, of Bruce and the way he was driving himself\r\nin the unnatural world downtown where men were at each other\'s throats, of\r\nDeborah and that school of hers in the heart of a vast foul region of\r\ntenement buildings swarming with strange, dirty little urchins. And last he\r\nthought of Laura, his youngest daughter, wild as a hawk, gadding about the\r\nLord knew where. She even danced in restaurants! Through his children he\r\nfelt flowing into his house the seething life of this new town. And\r\ndrowsily he told himself he must make a real effort, and make it soon, to\r\nknow his family better. For in spite of the storm of long ago which had\r\nswept away his faith in God, the feeling had come to him of late that\r\nsomewhere, in some manner, he was to meet his wife again. He rarely tried\r\nto think this out, for as soon as he did it became a mere wish, a hungry\r\nlonging, nothing more. So he had learned to let it lie, deep down inside of\r\nhim. Sometimes he vividly saw her face. After all, who could tell? And she\r\nwould want to hear of her children. Yes, he must know them better. Some day\r\nsoon he must begin.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he remembered that Laura had not yet come home. With a sigh of\r\ndiscomfort he got out of bed and went downstairs, re-lit the gas in the\r\nhallway, unfastened the locks and the chain at the door. He came back and\r\nwas soon asleep. He must have dozed for an hour or two. He was roused by\r\nhearing the front door close and a big motor thundering. And then like a\r\nflash of light in the dark came Laura\'s rippling laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next evening, Saturday, while Roger ate his dinner, Laura came to\r\nsit with him. She herself was dining out. That she should have dressed so\r\nearly in order to keep him company had caused her father some surprise, and\r\na faint suspicion entered his mind that she had overdrawn at the bank, as\r\nshe had the last time she sat with him like this. Her manner certainly was\r\na bit strange.\r\n\r\nBut Roger put the thought aside. Whatever she wanted, Laura was worth it.\r\nIn a tingling fashion he felt what a glorious time she was having, what a\r\ngorgeous town she knew. It was difficult to realize she was his own\r\ndaughter, this dashing stranger sitting here, playing idly with a knife and\r\ncaressing him with her voice and her eyes. The blue evening gown she was\r\nwearing to-night (doubtless not yet paid for) made her figure even more\r\nsupple and lithe, set off her splendid bosom, her slender neck, her creamy\r\nskin. Her hair, worn low over her temples, was brown with just a tinge of\r\nred. Her eyes were black, with gleaming lights; her lips were warm and\r\nrich, alive. He did not approve of her lips. Once when she had kissed him\r\nRoger had started slightly back. For his daughter\'s lips were rouged, and\r\nthey had reminded him of his youth. He had asked her sister to speak to\r\nher. But Deborah had told him she did not care to speak to people in that\r\nway--"especially women--especially sisters," she had said, with a quiet\r\nsmile. All very well, he reflected, but somebody ought to take Laura in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nShe had been his favorite as a child, his pet, his tiny daughter. He\r\nremembered her on his lap like a kitten. How she had liked to cuddle there.\r\nAnd she had liked to bite his hand, a curious habit in a child. "I hurt\r\ndaddy!" He could still recollect the gay little laugh with which she said\r\nthat, looking up brightly into his face.\r\n\r\nAnd here she was already grown, and like a light in the sober old house,\r\nfascinating while she disturbed him. He liked to hear her high pitched\r\nvoice, gossiping in Deborah\'s room or in her own dainty chamber chatting\r\nwith the adoring maid who was dressing her to go out. He loved her joyous\r\nthrilling laugh. And he would have missed her from the house as he would\r\nhave missed Fifth Avenue if it had been dropped from the city. For the\r\npicture Roger had formed of this daughter was more of a symbol than of a\r\ngirl, a symbol of the ardent town, spending, wasting, dancing mad. It was\r\nLaura who had kept him living right up to his income.\r\n\r\n"Where are you dining to-night?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"With the Raymonds." He wondered who they were. "Oh, Sarah," she added to\r\nthe maid. "Call up Mrs. Raymond\'s apartment and ask what time is dinner\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to dance later on?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I guess so," she replied. "On the Astor Roof, I think they said--"\r\n\r\nHer father went on with his dinner. These hotel dances, he had heard, ran\r\nwell into Sunday morning. How Judith would have disapproved. He hesitated\r\nuneasily.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t especially care for this dancing into Sunday," he said. For a\r\nmoment he did not look up from his plate. When he did he saw Laura\r\nregarding him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do you mind? I\'m sorry. I won\'t, after this," she answered. And Roger\r\ncolored angrily, for the glint of amusement in Laura\'s mischievous black\r\neyes revealed quite unmistakably that she regarded both her father and his\r\nfeeling for the Sabbath as very dear and quaint and old. Old? Of course he\r\nseemed old to _her_, Roger thought indignantly. For what was Laura but a\r\nchild? Did she ever think of anything except having a good time? Had she\r\never stopped to think out her own morals, let alone anyone else\'s? Was she\r\nany judge of what was old--or of _who_ was old? And he determined then and\r\nthere to show her he was in his prime. Impatiently he strove to remember\r\nthe names of her friends and ask her about them, to show a keen lively\r\ninterest in this giddy gaddy life she led. And when that was rather a\r\nfailure he tried his daughter next on books, books of the most modern kind.\r\nStoutly he lied and said he was reading a certain Russian novel of which he\r\nhad heard Deborah speak. But this valiant falsehood made no impression\r\nwhatever, for Laura had never heard of the book.\r\n\r\n"I get so little time for reading," she murmured. And meanwhile she was\r\nthinking, "As soon as he finishes talking, poor dear, I\'ll break the news."\r\n\r\nThen Roger had an audacious thought. He would take her to a play, by\r\nGeorge! Mustering his courage he led up to it by speaking of a play Deborah\r\nhad seen, a full-fledged modern drama all centered upon the right of a\r\nwoman "to lead her own life." And as he outlined the story, he saw he had\r\ncaught his daughter\'s attention. With her pretty chin resting on one hand,\r\nwatching him and listening, she appeared much older, and she seemed\r\nsuddenly close to him.\r\n\r\n"How would you like to go with me and see it some evening?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"See what, my love?" she asked him, her thoughts plainly far away; and he\r\nlooked at her in astonishment:\r\n\r\n"That play I\'ve just been speaking of!"\r\n\r\n"Why, daddy, I\'d love to!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"When?" he asked. And he fixed a night. He was proud of himself. Eagerly he\r\nbegan to talk of opening nights at Wallack\'s. Roger and Judith, when they\r\nwere young, had been great first nighters there. And now it was Laura who\r\ndrew him out, and as he talked on she seemed to him to be smilingly trying\r\nto picture it all.... "Now I\'d better tell him," she thought.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember Harold Sloane?" she asked a little strangely.\r\n\r\n"No," replied her father, a bit annoyed at the interruption.\r\n\r\n"Why--you\'ve met him two or three times--"\r\n\r\n"Have I?" The queer note in her voice made him look up. Laura had risen\r\nfrom her chair.\r\n\r\n"I want you to know him--very soon." There was a moment\'s silence. "I\'m\r\ngoing to marry him, dad," she said. And Roger looked at her blankly. He\r\nfelt his limbs beginning to tremble. "I\'ve been waiting to tell you when we\r\nwere alone," she added in an awkward tone. And still staring up at her he\r\nfelt a rush of tenderness and a pang of deep remorse. Laura in love and\r\nsettled for life! And what did he know of the affair? What had he ever done\r\nfor her? Too late! He had begun too late! And this rush of emotion was so\r\noverpowering that while he still looked at her blindly she was the first to\r\nrecover her poise. She came around the table and kissed him softly on the\r\ncheek. And now more than ever Roger felt how old his daughter thought him.\r\n\r\n"Who is he?" he asked hoarsely. And she answered smiling,\r\n\r\n"A perfectly nice young man named Sloane."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Laura--tell me! What does he do?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s in a broker\'s office--junior member of the firm, Oh, you needn\'t\r\nworry, dear, he can even afford to marry _me_."\r\n\r\nThey heard a ring at the front door.\r\n\r\n"There he is now, I think," she said. "Will you see him? Would you mind?"\r\n\r\n"See him? No!" her father cried.\r\n\r\n"But just to shake hands," she insisted. "You needn\'t talk or say a word.\r\nWe\'ve only a moment, anyway." And she went swiftly out of the room.\r\n\r\nRoger rose in a panic and strode up and down. Before he could recover\r\nhimself she was back with her man, or rather her boy--for the fellow, to\r\nher father\'s eyes, looked ridiculously young. Straight as an arrow,\r\nslender, his dress suit irreproachable, the chap nevertheless was more than\r\na dandy. He looked hard, as though he trained, and his smooth and ruddy\r\nface had a look of shrewd self-reliance. So much of him Roger fathomed in\r\nthe indignant cornered glance with which he welcomed him into the room.\r\n\r\n"Why, good evening, Mr. Gale--glad to see you again, sir!" Young Sloane\r\nnervously held out his hand. Roger took it and muttered something. For\r\nseveral moments, his mind in a whirl, he heard their talk and laughter and\r\nhis own voice joining in. Laura seemed enjoying herself, her eyes brimming\r\nwith amusement over both her victims. But at last she had compassion,\r\nkissed her father gaily and took her suitor out of the room.\r\n\r\nSoon Roger heard them leave the house. He went into his study, savagely bit\r\noff a cigar and gripped his evening paper as though he meant to choke it.\r\nThe maid came in with coffee. "Coffee? No!" he snapped at her. A few\r\nmoments later he came to his senses and found himself smoking fast and\r\nhard. He heartily damned this fellow Sloane for breaking into the family\r\nand asking poor Laura to risk her whole life--just for his own selfish\r\npleasure, his whim! Yes, "whim" was the very word for it! Laura\'s attitude,\r\ntoo! Did she look at it seriously? Not at all! Quite plainly she saw her\r\ncareer as one long Highland fling and dance, with this Harry boy as her\r\npartner! Who had he danced with in his past? The fellow\'s past must be gone\r\ninto, and at once, without delay!\r\n\r\nHere indeed was a jolt for Roger Gale, a pretty shabby trick of fate. This\r\nwas not what he had planned, this was a little way life had of jabbing a\r\nman with surprises. For months he had been slowly and comfortably feeling\r\nhis way into the lives of his children, patiently, conscientiously. But\r\nnow without a word of warning in popped this young whipper-snapper, turning\r\nthe whole house upside down! Another young person to be known, another life\r\nto be dug into, and with pick and shovel too! The job was far from\r\npleasant. Would Deborah help him? Not at all. She believed in letting\r\npeople alone--a devilish easy philosophy! Still, he wanted to tell her at\r\nonce, if only to stir her up a bit. He did not propose to bear this alone!\r\nBut Deborah was out to-night. Why must she always be out, he asked, in that\r\ninfernal zoo school? But no, it was not school to-night. She was dining out\r\nin some caf\xe9 with a tall lank doctor friend of hers. Probably she was to\r\nmarry him!\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have that news for breakfast!" Roger smote his paper savagely. Why\r\ncouldn\'t Laura have waited a little? Restlessly he walked the room. Then he\r\nwent into the hall, took his hat and a heavy stick which he used for his\r\nnight rambles, and walked off through the neighborhood. It was the first\r\nSaturday evening of Spring, and on those quiet downtown streets he met\r\ncouples strolling by. A tall thin lad and a buxom girl went into a cheap\r\napartment building laughing gaily to themselves, and Roger thought of\r\nLaura. A group of young Italians passed, humming "Trovatore," and it put\r\nhim in mind of the time when he had ushered at the opera. Would Laura\'s\r\nyoung man be willing to usher? More like him to _tango_ down the aisle!\r\n\r\nHe reached Washington Square feeling tired but even more restless than\r\nbefore. He climbed to the top of a motor \'bus, and on the lurching ride\r\nuptown he darkly reflected that times had changed. He thought of the Avenue\r\nhe had known, with its long lines of hansom cabs, its dashing broughams and\r\ncoup\xe9s with jingling harness, livened footmen, everything sprucely\r\nup-to-date. How the horses had added to the town. But they were gone, and\r\nin their place were these great cats, these purring motors, sliding softly\r\nby the \'bus. Roger had swift glimpses down into lighted limousines. In one\r\na big rich looking chap with a beard had a dressy young woman in his arms.\r\nLord, how he was hugging her! Laura would have a motor like that, kisses\r\nlike that, a life like that! She was the kind to go it hard! Ahead as far\r\nas he could see was a dark rolling torrent of cars, lights gleaming by the\r\nthousand. A hubbub of gay voices, cries and little shrieks of laughter\r\nmingled with the blare of horns. He looked at huge shop windows softly\r\nlighted with displays of bedrooms richly furnished, of gorgeous women\'s\r\napparel, silks and lacy filmy stuffs. And to Roger, in his mood of anxious\r\npremonition, these bedroom scenes said plainly,\r\n\r\n"O come, all ye faithful wives! Come let us adore him, and deck ourselves\r\nto please his eye, to catch his eye, to hold his eye! For marriage is a\r\ngame these days!"\r\n\r\nYes, Laura would be a spender, a spender and a speeder too! How much money\r\nhad he, that chap? And damn him, what had he in his past? How Roger hated\r\nthe very thought of poking into another man\'s life! Poking where nobody\r\nwanted him! He felt desperately alone. To-night they were dancing, he\r\nrecalled, not at a party in somebody\'s home, but in some flashy public\r\nplace where girls of her kind and fancy women gaily mixed together! How\r\nmixed the whole city was getting, he thought, how mad and strange, gone out\r\nof its mind, this city of his children\'s lives crowding in upon him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nHe breakfasted with Deborah late on Sunday morning. He had come down at the\r\nusual hour despite his long tramp of the previous night, for he wanted to\r\ntell her the news and talk it all out before Laura came down--because\r\nDeborah, he hadn\'t a doubt, with her woman\'s curiosity had probed deep into\r\nLaura\'s affairs in the many long talks they had had in her room. He had\r\noften heard them there. And so, as he waited and waited and still his\r\ndaughter did not come, Roger grew distinctly annoyed; and when at last she\r\ndid appear, his greeting was perfunctory:\r\n\r\n"What kept you out so late last night?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I was having a very good time," said Deborah contentedly. She poured\r\nherself some coffee. "I\'ve always wanted," she went on, "to see Laura\r\nreally puzzled--downright flabbergasted. And I saw her just like that last\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nRoger looked up with a jerk of his head:\r\n\r\n"You and Laura--together last night?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly--on the Astor Roof." At her father\'s glare of astonishment a look\r\nof quiet relish came over her mobile features. Her wide lips twitched a\r\nlittle. "Well, why not?" she asked him. "I\'m quite a dancer down at school.\r\nAnd last night with Allan Baird--we were dining together, you know--he\r\nproposed we go somewhere and dance. He\'s a perfectly awful dancer, and so I\r\nheld out as long as I could. But he insisted and I gave in, though I much\r\nprefer the theater."\r\n\r\n"Well!" breathed Roger softly. "So you hoof it with the rest!" His\r\nexpression was startled and intent. Would he ever get to know these girls?\r\n"Well," he added with a sigh, "I suppose you know what you\'re about."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I don\'t," she answered. "I never know what I\'m about. If you always\r\ndo, you miss so much--you get into a solemn habit of trying nothing till\r\nyou\'re sure. But to return to Laura. As we came gaily down the room we ran\r\nright into her, you see. That\'s how Allan dances. And when we collided, I\r\nsmiled at her sweetly and said, \'Why, hello, dearie--you here too?" And\r\nDeborah sipped her coffee. "I have never believed that the lower jaw of a\r\nwell-bred girl could actually drop open. But Laura\'s did. With a good\r\nstrong light, Allan told me, he could have examined her tonsils for her.\r\nRather a disgusting thought. You see until she saw me there, poor Laura had\r\nme so thoroughly placed--my school-marm job, my tastes and habits,\r\neverything, all cut and dried. She has never once come to my school, and in\r\nevery talk we\'ve ever had there has always been some perfectly good and\r\nabsorbing reason why we should talk about Laura alone."\r\n\r\n"There is now," said her father. He was in no mood for tomfoolery. His\r\ndaughter saw it and smiled a little.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she inquired. And then he let her have it!\r\n\r\n"Laura wants to get married," he snapped.\r\n\r\nDeborah caught her breath at that, and an eager excited expression swept\r\nover her attractive face. She had leaned forward suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Father! No! Which one?" she asked. "Tell me! Is it Harold Sloane?"\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dad." She sank back in her chair. "Oh, dad," she repeated.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with Sloane?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing, nothing--it\'s all right--"\r\n\r\n"It is, eh? How do you know it is?" His anxious eyes were still upon hers,\r\nand he saw she was thinking fast and hard and shutting him completely out.\r\nAnd it irritated him. "What do you know of this fellow Sloane?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing--nothing--"\r\n\r\n"Nothing! Humph! Then why do you sit here and say it\'s all right? Don\'t\r\ntalk like a fool!" he exclaimed. He waited, but she said no more, and\r\nRoger\'s exasperation increased. "He has money enough apparently--and\r\nthey\'ll spend it like March hares!"\r\n\r\nDeborah looked up at him:\r\n\r\n"What did Laura tell you, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Not very much. I\'m only her father. She had a dinner and dance on her\r\nmind."\r\n\r\nBut Deborah pressed her questions and he gave her brief replies.\r\n\r\n"Well, what shall we do about it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Nothing--until we know something more." Roger regarded her fiercely.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you go up and talk to her, then?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s asleep yet--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind if she is! If she\'s going to marry a chap like that and ruin\r\nher life it\'s high time she was up for her breakfast!"\r\n\r\nWhile he scanned his Sunday paper he heard Deborah in the pantry. She\r\nemerged with a breakfast tray and he saw her start up to Laura\'s room. She\r\nwas there for over an hour. And when she returned to his study, he saw her\r\neyes were shining. How women\'s eyes will shine at such times, he told\r\nhimself in annoyance.\r\n\r\n"Well?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Better leave her alone to-day," she advised. "Harold is coming some night\r\nsoon."\r\n\r\n"What for?"\r\n\r\n"To have a talk with you."\r\n\r\nHer father smote his paper. "What did she tell you about him?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Not much more than she told you. His parents are dead--but he has a rich\r\nwidowed aunt in Bridgeport who adores him. They mean to be married the end\r\nof May. She wants a church wedding, bridesmaids, ushers--the wedding\r\nreception here, of course--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lord," breathed Roger dismally.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t bother you much, father dear--"\r\n\r\n"You _will_ bother me much," he retorted. "I propose to be\r\nbothered--bothered a lot! I\'m going to look up this fellow Sloane--"\r\n\r\n"But let\'s leave him alone for to-day." She bent over her father\r\ncompassionately. "What a night you must have had, poor dear." Roger looked\r\nup in grim reproach.\r\n\r\n"You like all this," he grunted. "You, a grown woman, a teacher too."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if I do," she said. "I guess I\'m a queer person, dad, a curious\r\nfamily mixture--of Laura and Edith and mother and you, with a good deal of\r\nmyself thrown in. But it feels rather good to be mixed, don\'t you think?\r\nLet\'s stay mixed as long as we can--and keep together the family."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, to distract him, Deborah took her father to a concert in\r\nCarnegie Hall. She had often urged him to go of late, but despite his\r\nliking for music Roger had refused before, simply because it was a change.\r\nBut why balk at going anywhere now, when Laura was up to such antics at\r\nhome?\r\n\r\n"Do you mind climbing up to the gallery?" Deborah asked as they entered the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," he curtly answered. He did mind it very much!\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll go to the very top," she said. "It\'s a long climb but I want\r\nyou to see it. It\'s so different up there."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt it," he replied. And as they made the slow ascent, pettishly\r\nhe wondered why Deborah must always be so eager for queer places.\r\nGalleries, zoo schools, tenement slums--why not take a two dollar seat in\r\nlife?\r\n\r\nDeborah seated him far down in the front of the great gallery, over at the\r\nextreme right, and from here they could look back and up at a huge dim\r\narena of faces.\r\n\r\n"Now watch them close," she whispered. "See what the music does to them."\r\n\r\nAs the symphony began below the faces all grew motionless. And as the music\r\ncast its spell, the anxious ruffled feelings which had been with Roger all\r\nthat day little by little were dispelled, and soon his imagination began to\r\nwork upon this scene. He saw many familiar American types. He felt he knew\r\nwhat they had been doing on Sundays only a few years before. After church\r\nthey had eaten large Sunday dinners. Then some had napped and some had\r\nwalked and some had gone to Sunday school. At night they had had cold\r\nsuppers, and afterwards some had gone back to church; while others, as in\r\nRoger\'s house in the days when Judith was alive, had gathered around the\r\npiano for hymns. Young men callers, friends of their daughters, had joined\r\nin the family singing. Yes, some of these people had been like that. To\r\nthem, a few short years ago, a concert on the Sabbath would have seemed a\r\nsacrilege. He could almost hear from somewhere the echo of "Abide With Me."\r\n\r\nBut over this memory of a song rose now the surging music of Tschaikovsky\'s\r\n"Pathetique." And the yearnings and fierce hungers in this tumultuous music\r\nswept all the hymns from Roger\'s mind. Once more he watched the gallery,\r\nand this time he became aware that more than half were foreigners. Out of\r\nthe mass from every side individual faces emerged, swarthy, weird, and\r\nstaring hungrily into space. And to Roger the whole shadowy place, the very\r\nair, grew pregnant, charged with all these inner lives bound together in\r\nthis mood, this mystery that had swept over them all, immense and\r\nformless, baffling, this furious demanding and this blind wistful groping\r\nwhich he himself had known so well, ever since his wife had died and he had\r\nlost his faith in God. What was the meaning of it all if life were nothing\r\nbut a start, and there were nothing but the grave?\r\n\r\n"You will live on in our children\'s lives."\r\n\r\nHe glanced around at Deborah. Was _she_ so certain, so serene? "What do I\r\nknow of her?" he asked. "Little or nothing," he sadly replied. And he tried\r\nto piece together from things she had told him her life as it had passed\r\nhim by. Had there been no questionings, no sharp disillusionments? There\r\nmust have been. He recalled irritabilities, small acts and exclamations of\r\nimpatience, boredom, "blues." And as he watched her he grew sure that his\r\ndaughter\'s existence had been like his own. Despite its different setting,\r\nits other aims and visions, it had been a mere beginning, a feeling for a\r\nfoothold, a search for light and happiness. And Deborah seemed to him still\r\na child. "How far will _you_ go?" he wondered.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was still watching her even after the music had ceased, she did\r\nnot notice him for a time. Then she turned to him slowly with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Well? What did you see?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t looking," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Why, dearie," she retorted. "Where\'s that imagination of yours?"\r\n\r\n"It was with you," he answered. "Tell me what you were thinking."\r\n\r\nAnd still under the spell of the music, Deborah said to her father,\r\n\r\n"I was thinking of hungry people--millions of them, now, this minute--not\r\nonly here but in so many places--concerts, movies, libraries. Hungry, oh,\r\nfor everything--life, its beauty, all it means. And I was thinking this is\r\nyouth--no matter how old they happen to be--and that to feed it we have\r\nschools. I was thinking how little we\'ve done as yet, and of all that\r\nwe\'re so sure to do in the many, many years ahead. Do you see what I mean?"\r\nshe squeezed his hand.\r\n\r\n"Welcome back to school," she said, "back into the hungry army of youth!...\r\nSh-h-h!"\r\n\r\nAgain the music had begun. And sitting by her side he wondered whether it\r\nwas because she knew that Laura\'s affair had made him feel old that Deborah\r\nhad brought him here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey went to Edith\'s for supper.\r\n\r\nThe Cunninghams\' apartment was on the west side, well uptown. It was not\r\nthe neighborhood which Edith would have chosen, for nearly all the nice\r\npeople she knew lived east of the park. But rents were somewhat lower here\r\nand there was at least an abundance of fresh air for her family. Edith had\r\nfound that her days were full of these perplexing decisions. It was all\r\nvery simple to resolve that her children be old-fashioned, normal,\r\nwholesome, nice. But then she looked into the city--into schools and\r\nkindergartens, clothes and friends and children\'s parties, books and plays.\r\nAnd through them all to her dismay she felt conflicting currents, clashes\r\nbetween old and new. She felt New York. And anxiously she asked herself,\r\n"What is old-fashioned? What is normal? What is wholesome? What is nice?"\r\nCautiously she made her way, testing and comparing, trying small\r\nexperiments. Often sharply she would draw in her horns. She had struck\r\nsomething "common!" And she knew all this was nothing compared to the\r\npuzzles that lay ahead. For from her friend, Madge Deering, whose girls\r\nwere well along in their \'teens, she heard of deeper problems. The girls\r\nwere so inquisitive. Dauntlessly Madge was facing each month the most\r\ndisturbing questions. Thank Heaven, Edith had only one daughter. Sons were\r\nnot quite so baffling.\r\n\r\nSo she had groped her way along.\r\n\r\nWhen her father and Deborah arrived, placidly she asked them what they had\r\nbeen doing. And when she heard that they had been at a concert on the\r\nSabbath, though this was far from old-fashioned and something she would not\r\nhave done herself, it did not bother her half so much as the fact that\r\nHannah, the Irish nurse, had slapped little Tad that afternoon. She had\r\nnever known Hannah to do it before. Could it be that the girl was tired or\r\nsick? Perhaps she needed a few days off. "I must have a talk with her,"\r\nEdith thought, "as soon as father and Deborah go."\r\n\r\nRoger always liked to come here. Say what you would about Edith\'s habit of\r\nkeeping too closely to her home, the children to whom she had devoted\r\nherself were a fine, clean, happy lot. Here were new lives in his family,\r\nglorious fresh beginnings. He sat on the floor with her three boys,\r\nwatching the patient efforts of George to harness his perturbed white rat\r\nto Tad\'s small fire engine. George was a lank sprawling lad of fourteen,\r\nall legs and arms and elbows, with rumpled hair and freckled face, a quick\r\nbright smile and nice brown eyes--frank, simple, understandable eyes. All\r\nbut one of Edith\'s children were boys, and boys were a blessed relief to a\r\nman who had three grown-up daughters.\r\n\r\nAnd while Roger watched them, with a gentle glow of anticipation he waited\r\nfor what should follow, when as had been already arranged Deborah should\r\nbreak to her sister the news of Laura\'s engagement. And he was not\r\ndisappointed. The change in Edith was something tremendous. Until now so\r\nquietly self-absorbed, at the news that Laura was to be married instantly\r\nshe was all alert. Sitting there in the midst of her children and facing a\r\ntime of agony only a few weeks ahead which would add one more to her\r\nfamily, Edith\'s pretty florid face grew flushed and radiant as she\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n"What a perfectly wonderful thing for Laura! Now if only she can have a\r\nchild!"\r\n\r\nHer questions followed thick and fast, and with them her thoughts of what\r\nshould be done. Bruce must look up this suitor at once. Bruce demurred\r\nstoutly but without avail. She eagerly questioned her sister as to Laura\'s\r\nplans for the wedding, but plainly she considered that Deborah was no woman\r\nto give her the full information she wanted. She must see Laura herself at\r\nonce. For though she had thoroughly disapproved of the gay helter-skelter\r\nexistence of her youngest sister, still Laura was now to be married, and\r\nthis made all the difference.\r\n\r\nJust before Roger and Deborah left, Edith drew her father aside, and with a\r\ncurious concern and pity in her voice, she said,\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry I shan\'t be able to help you with the wedding, dear, and make\r\nit the sweet old-fashioned kind that mother would have wanted. Of course\r\nthere\'s Deborah, she\'ll be there. But her head is so full of new ideas. I\'m\r\nafraid she may find the house rather a burden after Laura has gone away."\r\nEdith gave a worried little sigh. "I\'ll be so glad," she added, "when we\r\nget that place in Morristown. We\'ll want you out there often, and for good\r\nlong visits too. You may even find you\'ll care to try staying there with us\r\nfor a while."\r\n\r\nRoger scowled and thanked her. She had given him a shock of alarm.\r\n\r\n"So she thinks that Deborah will find the housekeeping too hard," he\r\nreflected anxiously. And as he walked home with his daughter, he kept\r\nglancing at her face, which for all its look of quiet had so much tensity\r\nbeneath. She had packed her life so full of school. What if she wanted to\r\ngive up their home? "She\'ll try, of course, she\'ll try her best--but she\'ll\r\nfind it too much of an added strain." And again he felt that sickening\r\ndread. Deborah said nothing. He felt as though they had drifted apart.\r\n\r\nAnd at night in his bed, as Roger stared up at the beetling cliff of\r\napartment windows just outside, drearily he asked himself how it would feel\r\nto live like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nOne afternoon a few days later Roger was riding in the park. He rode\r\n"William," a large lazy cob who as he advanced in age had so subtly and\r\ninsidiously slackened his pace from a trot to a jog that Roger barely\r\nnoticed how slowly he was riding. As he rode along he liked to watch the\r\nbroad winding bridle path with its bobbing procession of riders that kept\r\nappearing before him under the tall spreading trees. Though he knew\r\nscarcely anyone by name, he was a familiar figure here and he recognized\r\nscores of faces. To many men he nodded at passing, and to not a few\r\nalluring young dames, ardent creatures with bright eyes who gave him smiles\r\nof greeting, Roger gravely raised his hat. One was "The Silver Lady" in a\r\nBroadway musical show, but he thought she was "one of the Newport crowd."\r\nHe liked to make shrewd guesses like that. There were so many kinds of\r\npeople here. There were stout anxious ladies riding for figures and lean\r\nmorose gentlemen riding for health. There were joyous care-free girls,\r\nchatting and laughing merrily. There were some gallant foreigners, and\r\nthere were riding masters, and Roger could not tell them apart. There were\r\nmad boys from the Squadron who rode at a furious canter, and there were\r\ngroups of children, eager and flushed, excited and gay, with stolid grooms\r\nbehind them. The path in several places ran close beside the main road of\r\nthe park, and with the coming of the dusk this road took on deep purple\r\nhues and glistened with reflections from countless yellow motor eyes. And\r\nfrom the polished limousines, sumptuous young women smiled out upon the\r\nriders.\r\n\r\nAt least so Roger saw this life. And after those bleak lonely years\r\nconfronted by eternity, it was good to come here and forget, to feel\r\nhimself for the moment a part of the thoughtless gaiety, the ease and\r\nluxury of the town. Here he was just on the edge of it all. Often as a\r\ncouple passed he would wonder what they were doing that night. In the\r\nriding school where he kept his horse, it was a lazy pleasure to have the\r\nEnglish "valet" there pull off his boots and breeches--though if anyone had\r\ntold him so, Roger would have denied it with indignation and surprise. For\r\nwas he not an American?\r\n\r\nIt had been a wonderful tonic, a great idea of Laura\'s, this forcing him up\r\nhere to ride. In one of her affectionate moods, just after a sick spell he\r\nhad been through, his gay capricious daughter had insisted that he have his\r\nhorse brought down from the mountains. She had promised to ride with him\r\nherself, and she had done so--for a week. Since then he had often met her\r\nhere with one of her many smart young men. What a smile of greeting would\r\nflash on her face--when Laura happened to notice him.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking of Laura now, and there was an anxious gleam in his eyes.\r\nFor young Sloane was coming to dinner to-night. What was he going to say to\r\nthe fellow? Bruce had learned that Sloane played polo, owned and drove a\r\nracing car and was well liked in his several clubs. But what about women\r\nand his past? Edith had urged her father to go through the lad\'s life with\r\na fine tooth comb, and if he should find anything there to kick up no end\r\nof a row for the honor of the family. All of which was nothing but words,\r\nreflected Roger pettishly. It all came to this, that he had a most ticklish\r\nevening ahead! On the path as a rider greeted him, his reply was a dismal\r\nfrown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLaura\'s suitor arrived at six o\'clock. In his study Roger heard the bell,\r\nlistened a moment with beating heart, then raised himself heavily from his\r\nchair and went into the hallway.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! It\'s you!" he exclaimed, with a nervous cordiality. "Come in, my\r\nboy, come right in! Here, let me help you with your coat. I don\'t know just\r\nwhere Laura is. Ahem!" He violently cleared his throat. "Suppose while\r\nwe\'re waiting we have a smoke." He kept it up back into his den. There the\r\nsuitor refused a cigar and carefully lit a cigarette. Roger noticed again\r\nhow young the chap was, and marriage seemed so ridiculous! All this\r\nfeverish trouble was for something so unreal!\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," the candidate blurted forth, "I guess I\'d better come right to\r\nthe point. Mr. Gale, I want to marry your daughter."\r\n\r\n"Laura?"\r\n\r\n"Yes." Roger cursed himself. Why had he asked, "Laura?" Of course it was\r\nLaura! Would this cub be wanting Deborah?\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy," he said thickly. "I--I wish I knew you better."\r\n\r\n"So do I, sir. Suppose we begin." The youth took a quick pull at his\r\ncigarette. He waited, stirred nervously in his seat. "You\'ll have some\r\nquestions to ask, I suppose--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, there are questions." Roger had risen mechanically and was slowly\r\nwalking the room. He threw out short gruff phrases. "I\'m not interested in\r\nyour past--I don\'t care about digging into a man--I never have and I never\r\nwill--except as it might affect my daughter. That\'s the main question, I\r\nsuppose. Can you make her happy?"\r\n\r\n"I think so," said Sloane, decidedly. Roger gave him a glance of\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a large order, young man," he rejoined.\r\n\r\n"Then let\'s take it in sections," the youngster replied. Confound his\r\nboyish assurance! "To begin with," he was saying, "I rather think I have\r\nmoney enough. We\'d better go into that, hadn\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Roger indifferently. "We might as well go into it." Of course\r\nthe chap had money enough. He was a money maker. You could hear it in his\r\nvoice; you could see it in his jaw, in his small aggressive blonde\r\nmoustache. Now he was telling briefly of his rich aunt in Bridgeport, of\r\nthe generous start she had given him, his work downtown, his income.\r\n\r\n"Twenty-two thousand this year," he said. "We can live on that all right, I\r\nguess."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t starve," was the dry response. Roger walked for a moment in\r\nsilence, then turned abruptly on young Sloane.\r\n\r\n"Look here, young man, I don\'t want to dig," he continued very huskily.\r\n"But I know little or nothing of what may be behind you. I don\'t care to\r\nask you about it now--unless it can make trouble."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t make trouble." At this answer, low but sharp, Roger wheeled and\r\nshot a glance into those clear and twinkling eyes. And his own eyes gleamed\r\nwith pain. Laura had been such a little thing in the days when she had been\r\nhis pet, the days when he had known her well. What could he do about it?\r\nThis was only the usual thing. But he felt suddenly sick of life.\r\n\r\n"How soon do you want to get married?" he demanded harshly.\r\n\r\n"Next month, if we can."\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"Abroad," said Sloane. Roger caught at this topic as at a straw. Soon they\r\nwere talking of the trip, and the tension slackened rapidly. He had never\r\nbeen abroad himself but had always dreamed of going there. With maps and\r\nbooks of travel Judith and he had planned it out. In imagination they had\r\nlived in London and Paris, Munich and Rome, always in queer old lodgings\r\nlooking on quaint crooked streets. He had dreamed of long delicious\r\nrambles, glimpses into queer old shops, vast, silent, dark cathedrals. For\r\nLaura how different it would be. This boy of hers knew Europe as a group\r\nof gorgeous new hotels.\r\n\r\nThe moment Laura joined them, her father\'s eye was caught and held by the\r\nring upon her finger. Roger knew rings, they were his hobby, and this huge\r\nyellow solitaire in its new and brilliant setting at once awakened his\r\ndislike. It just fitted the life they were to lead! What life? As he\r\nlistened to his daughter he kept wondering if she were so sure. Had she\r\nfelt no uneasiness? She must have, he decided, for all her gay excitement.\r\nOne Laura in that smiling face; another Laura deep inside, doubting and\r\nuncertain, reaching for her happiness, now elated, now dismayed,\r\nexclaiming, "Now at last I\'m starting!" Oh, what an ignorant child she was.\r\nHe wanted to cry out to her, "You\'ll _always_ be just starting! You\'ll\r\nnever be sure, you\'ll never be happy, you\'ll always be just beginning to\r\nbe! And the happier you are, the more you will feel it is only a start!...\r\nAnd then-"\r\n\r\nMore and more his spirit withdrew from these two heedless children. Later\r\non, when Deborah came, he barely noticed her meeting with Sloane. And\r\nthrough dinner, while they talked of plans for the wedding, the trip\r\nabroad, still Roger took no part at all. He felt dull and heavy. Deborah\r\ntoo, he noticed, after her first efforts to be welcoming and friendly, had\r\ngradually grown silent. He saw her watching Laura with a mingled look of\r\naffection and of whimsical dismay. Soon after dinner she left them, and\r\nRoger smoked with the boy for a while and learned that he was twenty-nine.\r\nBoth had grown uneasy and rather dull with each other. It was a relief when\r\nagain Laura joined them, dressed to go out. She and her lover left the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nRoger sat motionless for some time. His cigar grew cold unheeded. One of\r\nthe sorrows of his life had been that his only son had died. Bruce had been\r\nalmost like a son. But this young man of Laura\'s? No.\r\n\r\nLater he went for his evening walk. And as though drawn by invisible\r\nchains he strayed far down into the ghetto. Soon he was elbowing his way\r\nthrough a maze of uproarious tenement streets as one who had been there\r\nmany times. But he noticed little around him. He went on, as he had always\r\ngone, seeing and hearing this seething life only as a background to his own\r\nadventure. He reached his destination. Pushing his way through a swarm of\r\nurchins playing in front of a pawnshop, he entered and was a long time\r\ninside, and when he came out again at last the whole expression of his face\r\nhad undergone a striking change. As one who had found the solace he needed\r\nfor the moment, his pace unconsciously quickened and he looked about him\r\nwith brighter eyes.\r\n\r\nAround the corner from his home, he went into a small jewelry shop, a\r\nremnant of the town of the past. There were no customers in the place, and\r\nthe old Galician jeweler sat at the back playing solitaire. At sight of\r\nRoger he arose; and presently in a small back room, beneath the glare of a\r\npowerful lamp, the two were studying the ring which Roger had found in the\r\nghetto that night. It was plain, just a thin worn band of gold with an\r\nemerald by no means large; but the setting was old and curious, and\r\npersonal, distinctive. Somebody over in Europe had worked on it long and\r\nlovingly. Now as the Galician gently rubbed and polished and turned the\r\nring this way and that, the light revealed crude tiny figures, a man and a\r\nwoman under a tree. And was that a vine or a serpent? They studied it long\r\nand absorbedly.\r\n\r\nAt home, up in his bedroom, Roger opened a safe which stood in one corner,\r\ntook out a large shallow tray and sat down with it by his lamp. A strange\r\narray of rings was there, small and delicate, huge, bizarre; great signet\r\nrings and poison rings, love tokens, charms and amulets, rings which had\r\nbeen worn by wives, by mistresses, by favorite slaves and by young girls in\r\nconvents; rings with the Madonna and rings with many other saints graven\r\non large heavy stones; rings French and Russian, Polish, Italian, Spanish,\r\nSyrian. Some were many centuries old. In nine shallow metal trays they\r\nfilled the safe in Roger\'s room. Although its money value was small, the\r\nGale collection was well known to a scattered public of connoisseurs, and\r\nRoger took pride in showing it. But what had always appealed to him most\r\nwas the romance, the mystery, stored up in these old talismans that had\r\nlived so many ages, travelled through so many lands, decked so many\r\nfingers. Roger had found every one of them in the pawnshops of New York.\r\nWhat new recruits to America had brought them here and pawned them? From\r\nwhat old cities had they come? What passions of love and jealousy, of\r\nhatred, faith, devotion were in this glittering array? Roger\'s own love\r\naffair had been deep, but quiet and even and happy. All the wild\r\nadventures, the might-have-beens in his sex life, were gathered in these\r\ndusky trays with their richly colored glints of light.\r\n\r\nOf his daughters, Laura had been the one most interested in his rings, and\r\nso he thought of Laura now as he placed in the tray the new ring he had\r\nbought, the one he would have liked for her. But a vague uneasiness filled\r\nhis mind, for he knew she had the same craving as he for what gleamed out\r\nof these somber trays. The old Galician jeweler had long been quite a\r\nfriend of hers, she had often dropped in at his shop to ask him curious\r\nquestions about his women patrons. And it was just this side of him that\r\nRoger did not care for. So many of those women were from a dubious\r\nglittering world, and the old Galician took a weird vicarious joy in many\r\nof the gay careers into which he sent his beloved rings, his brooches,\r\nearrings, necklaces, his clasps and diamond garters. And Laura loved to\r\nmake him talk.... Yes, she was her father\'s child, a part of himself. He,\r\ntoo, had had his yearnings, his burning curiosities, his youthful ventures\r\ninto the town. "You will live on in our children\'s lives." With her\r\ninheritance what would she do? Would she stop halfway as he had done, or\r\nwould she throw all caution aside and let the flames within her rise?\r\n\r\nHe heard a step in the doorway, and Deborah stood there smiling.\r\n\r\n"A new one?" she inquired. He nodded, and she bent over the tray. "Poor\r\nfather," Deborah murmured. "I saw you eyeing Laura\'s engagement ring at\r\ndinner to-night. It wasn\'t like this one, was it?" He scowled:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like what I see ahead of her. Nor do you," he said. "Be honest."\r\nShe looked at him perplexedly.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t stop it, can we? And even if we could," she said, "I\'m not quite\r\nsure I\'d want to. It\'s her love affair, not yours or mine--grown out of a\r\nlife she made for herself--curious, eager, thrilled by it all--and in the\r\ncenter of her soul the deep glad growing certainty, \'I\'m going to be a\r\nbeautiful woman--I myself, I, Laura Gale!\' Oh, you don\'t know--nor do I.\r\nAnd so she felt her way along--eagerly, hungrily, making mistakes--and you\r\nand I left her to do it alone. I\'m afraid we both rather neglected her,\r\ndad," Deborah ended sadly. "And all we can do now, I think, is to give her\r\nthe kind of wedding she wants."\r\n\r\nRoger started to speak but hesitated.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"Queer," he answered gruffly, "how a man can neglect his children--as I\r\nhave done, as I do still--when the one thing he wants most in life is to\r\nsee each one of \'em happy."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nRoger soon grew accustomed to seeing young Sloane about the house. They\r\ncould talk together more easily, and he began to call him Harold. Harold\r\nasked him with Laura to lunch at the Ritz to meet the aunt from Bridgeport,\r\na lady excessively stout and profound. But that ended the formalities. It\r\nhad all been so much easier than Roger had expected. So, in its calm sober\r\nfashion, the old house took into its life this new member, these new plans,\r\nand the old seemed stronger for the new--for Laura and Edith and Deborah\r\ndrew together closer than they had been in many years. But only because\r\nthey felt themselves on the eve of a still deeper and more lasting\r\nseparation, as the family of Roger Gale divided and went different ways. At\r\ntimes he noticed it sadly. Laura, who had scarcely ever been home for\r\ndinner, now spent many evenings here. She needed her home for her wedding,\r\nhe thought. Each daughter needed it now and then. But as the years wore\r\nslowly on, the seasons when they needed it grew steadily wider and wider\r\napart....\r\n\r\nEarly in May, when Roger came home from his office one night he found\r\nEdith\'s children in the house. From the hallway he could hear their gay\r\nexcited voices, and going into the dining room he found them at their\r\nsupper. Deborah was with them, and at once her father noticed how much\r\nyounger she appeared--as she always did with these children who all\r\nidolized her so. She rose and followed him into the hall, and her quiet\r\nvoice had a note of compassion.\r\n\r\n"Edith\'s baby is coming," she said.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord. Is anything wrong?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No, no, it\'s all right--"\r\n\r\n"But I thought the child wasn\'t due for three weeks."\r\n\r\n"I know, and poor Edith is fearfully worried. It has upset all her plans.\r\nI\'d go up and see her if I were you. Your supper is ready; and if you like\r\nyou can have it with the children."\r\n\r\nThere followed a happy boisterous meal, with much expectant chatter about\r\nthe long summer so soon to begin at the farm up in the mountains. George,\r\nwhose hair was down over his eyes, rumpled it back absorbedly as he told of\r\na letter he had received from his friend Dave Royce, Roger\'s farmer, with\r\nwhom George corresponded. One of the cows was to have a calf, and George\r\nwas anxious to get there in time.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never seen a real new calf, new absolutely," he explained. "And I\r\nwant a look at this one the very minute that he\'s born. Gee, I hope we can\r\nget there in time--"\r\n\r\n"Gee! So do I!" cried Bobby aged nine. And then Tad, the chubby\r\nthree-year-old who had been intently watching his brothers, slowly took the\r\nspoon from his mouth and in his grave sweet baby voice said very softly,\r\n"Gee." At her end of the table, Elizabeth, blonde and short and rather\r\nplump, frowned and colored slightly. For she was eleven and she knew there\r\nwas something dark and shameful about the way calves appear in barns. And\r\nso, with a quick conscious cough, she sweetly interrupted:\r\n\r\n"Oh, Aunt Deborah! Won\'t you please tell us about--about--"\r\n\r\n"About--about," jeered the ironical George. "About what, you little ninny?"\r\nPoor Elizabeth blushed desperately. She was neither quick nor resourceful.\r\n\r\n"Now, George," said his aunt warningly.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t I talking?" the boy rejoined. "And didn\'t Betsy butt right\r\nin--without even a thing to butt in about? About--about," he jeered again.\r\n\r\n"About Paris!" cried his sister, successful at last in her frantic search\r\nfor a proper topic of conversation. "Aunt Deborah\'s trip to Paris!"\r\n\r\n"How many times has she told it already?" her brother replied with\r\nwithering scorn. "And anyhow, I was talking of cows!"\r\n\r\n"Very well," said his aunt, "we\'ll talk about cows, some cows I saw on a\r\nlovely old farm in a little village over in France."\r\n\r\n"There!" cried his young sister. "Did she ever tell of _that_ part of her\r\ntrip?" And she made a little face at her brother.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," he answered doggedly. "She has told about Paris lots of\r\ntimes--and that was what _you_ wanted. Yes, you did. You said, \'About\r\nParis.\' Didn\'t she, Bob?"\r\n\r\n"You bet she did," young Bob agreed.\r\n\r\n"Now, children, children, what does it matter?"\r\n\r\n"All right, go ahead with your barn in France," said George with patient\r\ntolerance. "Did they have any Holsteins?"\r\n\r\nSoon the questions were popping from every side, while little Tad beamed\r\nfrom one to the other. To Tad it was all so wonderful, to be having supper\r\naway from home, to be here, to go to bed upstairs, to take part perhaps in\r\na pillow fight.... And glancing at the glowing face and the parted lips of\r\nhis small grandson Roger felt a current of warm new life pour into his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nEarly in the evening he went up to Edith\'s apartment. He found his daughter\r\nin her room, looking flushed and very tense. He took her arm and they\r\nwalked for a time. A trained nurse was soaping the windows. Roger asked the\r\nreason for this and was told that in case the baby did not come till\r\nmorning the doctor wanted to pull up the shades in order to work by\r\ndaylight. "And neighbors in New York are such cats! You\'ve no idea!" said\r\nEdith. She looked out at the numberless windows crowding close about her\r\nhome, and she fairly bristled with scorn. "Oh, how I loathe apartments!"\r\n\r\n"They seem to have come to stay, my dear. In a few years more New York will\r\nbe a city without a house," he said. "Only a palace here and there." The\r\nthought flashed in his mind, "But I shall be gone."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll move out to the country!" she cried. Still walking the floor\r\nwith her father, she talked of the perplexities which in her feverish state\r\nof mind had loomed suddenly enormous. She had planned everything so nicely\r\nfor the baby to come the first of June, but now her plans were all upset.\r\nShe did not want the children here, it would make too much confusion. They\r\nhad much better go up to the mountains, even though George and Elizabeth\r\nlost their last few weeks at school. But who could she find to take them?\r\nBruce was simply rushed to death with his new receivership. Laura was\r\ngetting her trousseau. Deborah, said Edith, had time for nothing on earth\r\nbut school.\r\n\r\n"Suppose I take them," Roger ventured. But she only smiled at this. "My\r\ndear," he urged, "your nurse will be with me, and when we arrive there\'s\r\nthe farmer\'s wife." But Edith impatiently shook her head. Her warm bright\r\neyes seemed to picture it all, hour by hour, day and night, her children\r\nthere without her.\r\n\r\n"You poor dear," she told him, "you haven\'t the slightest idea what it\r\nmeans. The summer train is not on yet, and you have to change three times\r\non the way--with all the children--luggage, too. And there are their naps,\r\nand all their meals. You don\'t arrive till late at night. No," she decided\r\nfirmly, "Bruce will simply have to go." She drew a breath of discomfort.\r\n"You go and talk to him," she said.\r\n\r\n"I will, my dear." Roger looked at his daughter in deep concern. Awkwardly\r\nhis heavy hand touched her small plump shoulder, and he felt the constant\r\nquivering there. "Now, now," he muttered, uneasily, "it\'s going to be all\r\nright, you know--" And at that she gave him a rapid glance out of those\r\nwarm hunted eyes, as though to ask, "What do you know of this?" And Roger\r\nflinched and turned to the door.\r\n\r\nBruce was working at his desk, with an old briar pipe in his teeth. He\r\nlooked up with a quick nervous smile which showed his dread of the coming\r\nordeal, but his voice had a carefully casual tone.\r\n\r\n"Does she want me now?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No," said Roger. And he told of her plan for the children. "I volunteered\r\nmyself," he added, "but she wouldn\'t hear to it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my God, man, you wouldn\'t do," said Bruce, in droll disparagement.\r\n"You with forty-nine bottles of pasteurized milk? Suppose you smashed one?\r\nWhere\'d you be? Moving our family isn\'t a job; it\'s a science, and I\'ve got\r\nmy degree." He rose and his face softened. "Poor girl, she mustn\'t worry\r\nlike that. I\'ll run in and tell her I\'ll do it myself--just to get it off\r\nher mind."\r\n\r\nHe went to his wife. And when he came back his dark features appeared a\r\nlittle more drawn.\r\n\r\n"Poor devil," thought Roger, "he\'s scared to death--just as I used to be\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"Pretty tough on a woman, isn\'t it?" Bruce muttered, smiling constrainedly.\r\n\r\n"Did Baird say everything\'s going well?" Baird was Edith\'s physician.\r\n\r\n"Yes. He was here this afternoon, and he said he\'d be back this evening."\r\nBruce stopped with a queer little scowl of suspense. "I told her I\'d see to\r\nthe trip with the kiddies, and it seemed to relieve her a lot." His eye\r\nwent to a pile of documents that lay on the desk before him. "It\'ll play\r\nthe very devil with business, taking three days off just now. But I guess I\r\ncan manage it somehow--"\r\n\r\nA muscle began to twitch on his face. He re-lit his pipe with elaborate\r\ncare and looked over at Roger confidingly:\r\n\r\n"Do you know what\'s the matter with kids these days? It\'s the twentieth\r\ncentury," he said. "It\'s a disease. It starts in their teeth. No modern\r\ngirl can get married unless she has had her teeth straightened for years.\r\nOur dentist\'s bill, this year alone, was over eight hundred dollars. But\r\nthat isn\'t all. It gets into their young intestines, God bless \'em, and\r\nmakes you pasteurize all they eat. It gets into their nerves and tears \'em\r\nup, and your only chance to save \'em is school--not a common school but a\r\n\'simple\' school, tuition four hundred dollars a year. And you hire a\r\ndancing teacher besides--I mean a rhythm teacher--and let \'em shake it out\r\nof their feet. And after that you buy \'em clothes--not fluffy clothes, but\r\n\'simple\' clothes, the kind which always cost the most. And then you build a\r\nsimple home, in a simple place like Morristown. The whole idea is\r\nsimplicity. If you can\'t make enough to buy it, you\'re lost. If you can\r\nmake enough, just barely enough, you get so excited you lose your head--and\r\ndo what I did Monday."\r\n\r\nThe two men smiled at each other. Roger was very fond of Bruce.\r\n\r\n"What did you do Monday?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I bought that car I told you about."\r\n\r\n"Splendid! Best thing in the world for you! Tell me all about it!"\r\n\r\nAnd while Bruce rapidly grew engrossed in telling of the car\'s fine points,\r\nRoger pictured his son-in-law upon hot summer evenings (for Bruce spent his\r\nsummers in town) forgetting his business for a time and speeding out into\r\nthe country. Then he thought of Edith and the tyranny of her motherhood,\r\nalways draining her husband\'s purse and keeping Edith so wrapt up in her\r\nchildren and their daily needs that she had lost all interest in anything\r\noutside her home. What was there wrong about it? He knew that Edith prided\r\nherself on being like her mother. But Judith had always found time for her\r\nfriends. He himself had been more as Edith was now. How quickly after\r\nJudith died he had dropped all friends, all interests. "That\'s it," he\r\nruefully told himself, "Edith takes after her father." And the same curious\r\nfeeling which he had had with Laura, came back to him with her sister. This\r\ndaughter, too, was a part of himself. His deep instinctive craving to keep\r\nto himself and his family was living on in Edith, was already dominating\r\nher home. What a queer mysterious business it was, this tie between a man\r\nand his child.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking of this when Baird arrived. Allan Baird was not only the\r\ndoctor who had brought Edith\'s children into the world, he was besides an\r\nintimate friend, he had been Bruce\'s room-mate at college. As he came\r\nstrolling into the room with his easy greeting of "Well, folks--" his low\r\ngruff voice, his muscular frame, over six feet two, and the kindly calm\r\nassurance in his lean strong visage, gave to Bruce and Roger the feeling of\r\nsafety they needed. For this kind of work was his life. He had specialized\r\non women, and after over fifteen years of toilsome uphill labor he had\r\nbecome at thirty-seven one of the big gynecologists. He was taking his\r\nsuccess with the quiet relish of a man who had had to work for it hard. And\r\nyet he had not been spoiled by success. He worked even harder than\r\nbefore--so hard, in fact, that Deborah, with whom through Bruce and Edith\r\nhe had long ago struck up an easy bantering friendship, had sturdily set\r\nherself the task of prying open his eyes a bit. She had taken him to her\r\nschool at night and to queer little foreign caf\xe9s. And Baird, with a humor\r\nof his own, had retaliated by dragging her to the Astor Roof and to musical\r\nplays.\r\n\r\n"If my eyes are to be opened," he had doggedly declared, "I propose to have\r\nsome diamonds in the scenery, and a little cheery ragtime, too. You\'ve got\r\na good heart, Deborah Gale, but your head is full of tenements."\r\n\r\nTo-night to divert Bruce\'s thoughts from his wife, Baird started him\r\ntalking of his work. In six weeks Bruce had crammed his mind with the\r\ndetails of skyscraper building, and his talk was bewildering now, bristling\r\nwith technical terms, permeated through and through with the feeling of\r\nstrain and fierce competition. As Roger listened he had again that sharp\r\nand oppressive sensation of a savage modern town unrelentingly pressing,\r\npressing in. Restlessly he glanced at Baird who sat listening quietly. And\r\nRoger thought of the likeness between their two professions. For Bruce,\r\ntoo, was a surgeon. His patients were the husbands in their distracting\r\noffices. Baird\'s were the wives and mothers in their equally distracting\r\nhomes. Which were more tense, the husbands or wives? And, good Lord, what\r\nwas it all about, this feverish strain of getting and spending? What were\r\nthey spending? Their very life\'s blood. And what were they getting?\r\nHappiness? What did most of them know of real happiness? How little they\r\nknew, how blind they were, and yet how they laughed and chattered along,\r\nhow engrossed in their little games. What children, oh, what children!\r\n\r\n"And am I any better than the rest? Do I know what I\'m after--what I\'m\r\nabout?"\r\n\r\nHe left them soon, for he felt very tired. He went to his daughter to say\r\ngood-night. And in her room the talk he had heard became to him suddenly\r\nremote, that restless world of small account. For in Edith, in the one\r\nbrief hour since her father had seen her last, there had come a great\r\ntransformation, into her face an eager light. She was slipping down into a\r\nweird small world which for a brief but fearful season was to be utterly\r\nher own, with agony and bloody sweat, and joy and a deep mystery. Clumsily\r\nhe took her hand. It was moist and he felt it clutch his own. He heard her\r\nbreathing rapidly.\r\n\r\n"Good-night," he said in a husky tone. "I\'ll be so glad, my dear, so\r\nglad."\r\n\r\nFor answer she gave him a hurried smile, a glance from her bright restless\r\neyes. Then he went heavily from the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt home he found Deborah sitting alone, with a pile of school papers in her\r\nlap. As he entered she slowly turned her head.\r\n\r\n"How is Edith?" she asked him. Roger told of his visit uptown, and spoke of\r\nEdith\'s anxiety over getting the children up to the farm.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take them myself," said Deborah.\r\n\r\n"But how can you get away from school?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I think I can manage it. We\'ll leave on Friday morning and I can be\r\nback by Sunday night. I\'ll love it," Deborah answered.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be a great relief to her," said Roger, lighting a cigar. Deborah\r\nresumed her work, and there was silence for a time.\r\n\r\n"I let George sit up with me till an hour after his bedtime," she told her\r\nfather presently. "We started talking about white rats--you see it\'s still\r\nwhite rats with George--and that started us wondering about God. George\r\nwonders if God really knows about rats. \'Has he ever stuck his face right\r\ndown and had a good close look at one? Has God ever watched a rat stand up\r\nand brush his whiskers with both paws? Has he ever really laughed at rats?\r\nAnd that\'s another thing, Aunt Deborah--does God ever laugh at all? Does he\r\nknow how to take a joke? If he don\'t, we might as well quit right now!\'"\r\n\r\nRoger laughed with relish, and his daughter smiled at him:\r\n\r\n"Then the talk turned from rats and God to a big dam out in the Rockies.\r\nGeorge has been reading about it, he\'s thinking of being an engineer. And\r\nthere was so much he wanted to know that he was soon upon the verge of\r\ndiscovering my ignorance--when all of a sudden a dreamy look, oh, a very\r\ndreamy look, came into his eyes--and he asked me this." And over her bright\r\nexpressive face came a scowl of boyish intensity: "Suppose I _was_ an\r\nengineer--and I was working on a dam, or may be a bridge, in the Rockies.\r\nAnd say it was pretty far down south--say around the Grand Canyon. I should\r\nthink they\'d need a dam down there, or anyhow a bridge,\' said George. And\r\nhe eyed me in a cautious way which said as plain as the nose on your face,\r\n\'Good Lord, she\'s only a woman, and she won\'t understand.\' But I showed him\r\nI was serious, and he asked me huskily, \'Suppose it was winter, Aunt\r\nDeborah, and the Giants were in Texas. Do you think I could get a few days\r\noff?\' And then before he could tell me the Giants were a baseball nine, I\r\nsaid I was sure he could manage it. You should have seen his face light up.\r\nAnd he added very fervently, \'Gee, it must be wonderful to be an engineer\r\nout there!\'"\r\n\r\nRoger chuckled delightedly and Deborah went on with her work. "How good she\r\nis with young uns," he thought. "What a knack she has of drawing \'em out.\r\nWhat a pity she hasn\'t some of her own."\r\n\r\nHe slept until late the next morning, and awoke to find Deborah by his bed.\r\n\r\n"It\'s another boy," she told him. Roger sat up excitedly. "Bruce has just\r\ntelephoned the news. The children and I have breakfasted, and they\'re going\r\nout with their nurse. Suppose you and I go up and see Bruce and settle this\r\ntrip to the mountains."\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later, arriving at Edith\'s apartment, they found Bruce\r\ndownstairs with Allan Baird who was just taking his departure. Bruce\'s dark\r\neyes shone with relief, but his hand was hot and nervous. Allan, on the\r\ncontrary, held out to Edith\'s father a hand as steady and relaxed as was\r\nthe bantering tone of his voice.\r\n\r\n"Bruce," he said, "has for once in his life decided to do something\r\nsensible. He\'s going to drop his wretched job and take a week off with his\r\nchildren."\r\n\r\n"And worry every minute he\'s gone," Deborah retorted, "and come back and\r\nwork day and night to catch up. But he isn\'t going to do it. I\'ve decided\r\nto take the children myself."\r\n\r\n"You have?" cried Bruce delightedly.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll do no such thing," said Allan, indignant.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you go to thunder," Bruce put in. "Haven\'t you any delicacy? Can\'t you\r\nsee this is no business of yours?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t, eh," Allan sternly rejoined. And of Deborah he demanded, "Didn\'t\r\nyou say you\'d go with me to \'Pinafore\' this Saturday night?"\r\n\r\n"Ah," sneered Bruce. "So that\'s your game. And for one little night of your\r\npleasure you\'d do me out of a week of my life!"\r\n\r\n"Like that," said Baird, with a snap of his fingers.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going, though," said Deborah.\r\n\r\n"Quite right, little woman," Bruce admonished her earnestly. "Don\'t let him\r\nrob you of your happiness."\r\n\r\n"Come here," growled Baird to Deborah. She followed him into the living\r\nroom, and Roger went upstairs with Bruce.\r\n\r\n"If he ever hopes to marry that girl," said Bruce, with an anxious backward\r\nglance, "he\'s got to learn to treat her with a little consideration."\r\n\r\n"Quit your quarreling," Roger said. "What\'s a week in the mountains to you?\r\nHasn\'t your wife just risked her life?"\r\n\r\n"Sure she has," said Bruce feelingly. "And I propose to stick by her, too."\r\n\r\n"Can I see her?"\r\n\r\n"No, you can\'t--another of Baird\'s fool notions."\r\n\r\n"Then where\'s the baby?"\r\n\r\n"Right in here."\r\n\r\nSilently in front of the cradle Bruce and Roger stood looking down with the\r\ncontent which comes to men on such occasions when there is no woman by\r\ntheir side expecting them to say things.\r\n\r\n"I made it a rule in my family," Roger spoke up presently, "to have my\r\nfirst look at each child alone."\r\n\r\n"Same here," said Bruce. And they continued their silent communion. A few\r\nmoments later, as they were leaving, Deborah came into the room and went\r\nsoftly to the cradle. Downstairs they found that Allan had gone, and when\r\nDeborah rejoined them she said she was going to stick to her plan. It was\r\nsoon arranged that she and the youngsters should start on their journey the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nBack at home she threw herself into the packing and was busy till late that\r\nnight. At daybreak she was up again, for they were to make an early start.\r\nBruce came with his new automobile, the children were all bundled in,\r\ntogether with Deborah and their nurse, and a half hour later at the train\r\nBruce and Roger left them--Deborah flushed and happy, surrounded by\r\nluggage, wraps, small boys, an ice box, toys and picture books. The small\r\nred hat upon her head had already been jerked in a scrimmage, far down over\r\none of her ears.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry about us, Bruce," she said. "We\'re going to have the time of\r\nour lives!" Bruce fairly beamed his gratitude.\r\n\r\n"If she don\'t marry," he declared, as he watched the train move slowly out,\r\n"there\'ll be a great mother wasted."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the weeks which followed, Roger found the peace of his home so\r\ninterrupted and disturbed by wedding preparations that often retreating\r\ninto his den he earnestly told himself he was through, that a man with\r\nthree grown daughters was a fool to show any sympathy with the utter folly\r\nof their lives. Yield an inch and they took a mile! It began one night when\r\nDeborah said,\r\n\r\n"Now, dearie, I think you had better make up your mind to give Laura just\r\nthe kind of wedding she likes."\r\n\r\nAnd Roger weakly agreed to this, but as time wore on he discovered that the\r\nkind of wedding Laura liked was a thing that made his blood run cold. There\r\nseemed to be no end whatever to the young bride\'s blithe demands. The\r\ntrousseau part of it he didn\'t mind. To the gowns and hats and gloves and\r\nshoes and trunks and jaunty travelling bags which came pouring into the\r\nhouse, he made no objection. All that, he considered, was fair play. But\r\nwhat got on Roger\'s nerves was this frantic fuss and change! The faded hall\r\ncarpet had to come up, his favorite lounge was whisked away, the piano was\r\nre-tuned while he was trying to take a nap, rugs were beaten, crates and\r\nbarrels filled the halls, and one whole bedroom stripped and bare was\r\ntransformed into a shop where the wedding presents were displayed. In the\r\nshuffle his box of cigars disappeared. In short, there was the devil to\r\npay!\r\n\r\nAnd Deborah, was as bad as the bride. At times it appeared to Roger as\r\nthough her fingers fairly itched to jab and tug at his poor old house,\r\nwhich wore an air of mute reproach. She revealed a part of her nature that\r\nhe viewed with dark amazement. Every hour she could spare from school, she\r\nwas changing something or other at home--with an eager glitter in her eyes.\r\nDoing it all for Laura, she said. Fiddlesticks and rubbish! She did it\r\nbecause she liked it!\r\n\r\nIn gloomy wrath one afternoon he went up to see Edith and quiet down. She\r\nwas well on the way to recovery, but instead of receiving solace here he\r\nonly found fresh troubles. For sitting up in her old-fashioned bed, with an\r\nold-fashioned cap of lace upon her shapely little head, Edith made her\r\nfather feel she had washed her hands of the whole affair.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," she said in an injured tone, "that Laura doesn\'t care enough\r\nabout her oldest sister to put off the wedding two or three weeks so I\r\ncould be there. It seems rather undignified, I think, for a girl to hurry\r\nher wedding so. I should have loved to make it the dear simple kind of\r\nwedding which mother would have wanted. But so long as she doesn\'t care for\r\nthat--and in fact has only found ten minutes--once--to run in and see the\r\nbaby--"\r\n\r\nIn dismay her father found himself defending the very daughter of whom he\r\nhad come to complain. It was not such a short engagement, he said, he had\r\nlearned they had been engaged some time before they told him.\r\n\r\n"Do you approve of that?" she rejoined. "When I was engaged, I made Bruce\r\ngo to you before I even let him--" here Edith broke off primly. "Of course\r\nthat was some time ago. An engagement, Laura tells me, is \'a mere\r\nexperiment\' nowadays. They \'experiment\' till they feel quite sure--then\r\nnotify their parents and get married in a week."\r\n\r\n"She is rushing it, I admit," Roger soothingly replied. "But she has her\r\nmind set on Paris in June."\r\n\r\n"Paris in June," said Edith, "sums up in three words Laura\'s whole\r\nconception of marriage. You really ought to talk to her, father. It\'s your\r\nduty, it seems to me."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather not tell you." Edith\'s glance went sternly to the cradle by her\r\nbed. "Laura pities me," she said, "for having had five children."\r\n\r\n"Oh, now, my dear girl!"\r\n\r\n"She does, though--she said as much. When she dropped in the other day and\r\nI tried to be sympathetic and give her a little sound advice, she said I\r\nhad had the wedding I liked and the kind of married life I liked, and she\r\nwas going to have hers. And she made it quite plain that her kind is to\r\ninclude no children. It\'s to be simply an effort to find by \'experiment\'\r\nwhether or not she loves Hal Sloane. If she doesn\'t--" Edith gave a slight\r\nbut emphatic wave of dismissal.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say Laura told you that?" her father asked with an angry\r\nfrown.\r\n\r\n"I mean she made me feel it--as plainly as I\'m telling it! What I can\'t\r\nunderstand," his daughter went on, "is Deborah\'s attitude in the affair."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with Deborah?" inquired Roger dismally.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing\'s the matter with Deborah. She\'s quite self-sufficient. She at\r\nleast can play with modern ideas and keep her head while she\'s doing it.\r\nBut when poor Laura--a mere child with the mind of a chicken--catches\r\nvaguely at such ideas, applies them to her own little self and risks her\r\nwhole future happiness, it seems to me perfectly criminal for Deborah not\r\nto interfere! Not even a word of warning!"\r\n\r\n"Deborah believes," said her father, "in everyone\'s leading his own life."\r\n\r\n"That\'s rot," was Edith\'s curt reply. "Do I lead my own life? Does Bruce?\r\nDo you?"\r\n\r\n"No," growled Roger feelingly.\r\n\r\n"Do my children?" Edith demanded. "I know Deborah would like them to.\r\nThat\'s her latest and most modern fad, to run a school where every child\r\nshall sit with a rat in its lap or a goat, and do just what he\r\npleases--follow his natural bent, she says. I hope she won\'t come up to the\r\nmountains and practice on my children. I should hate to break with\r\nDeborah," Edith ended thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nRoger rose and walked the room. The comforting idea entered his mind that\r\nwhen the wedding was over he would take out his collection of rings and\r\ncarefully polish every one. But even this hope did not stay with him long.\r\n\r\n"With Laura at home," he heard Edith continue, "you at least had a daughter\r\nto run your house. If Deborah tries to move you out--"\r\n\r\n"She won\'t!" cried Roger in alarm.\r\n\r\n"If she does," persisted Edith, "or if she begins any talk of the kind--you\r\ncome to me and _I\'ll_ talk to her!"\r\n\r\nHer father walked in silence, his head down, frowning at the floor.\r\n\r\n"It seems funny," Edith continued, "that women like me who give children\r\ntheir lives, and men like Bruce who are building New York--actually doing\r\nit all the time--have so little to say in these modern ideas. I suppose\r\nit\'s because we\'re a little too real."\r\n\r\n"To come back to the wedding," Roger suggested.\r\n\r\n"To come back to the wedding, father dear," his daughter said\r\ncompassionately. "I\'m afraid it\'s going to be a \'mere form\' which will make\r\nyou rather wretched. When you get so you can\'t endure it, come in and see\r\nme and the baby."\r\n\r\nAs he started for home, her words of warning recurred to his mind. Yes,\r\nhere was the thing that disturbed him most, the ghost lurking under all\r\nthis confusion, the part which had to do with himself. It was bad enough to\r\nknow that his daughter, his own flesh and blood, was about to settle her\r\nfate at one throw. But to be moved out of his house bag and baggage! Roger\r\nstrode wrathfully up the street.\r\n\r\n"It\'s your duty to talk to her," Edith had said. And he meditated darkly on\r\nthis: "Maybe I will and maybe I won\'t. I know my duties without being told.\r\nHow does Edith know what her mother liked? We had our own likings, her\r\nmother and I, and our own ideas, long after she was tucked into bed. And\r\nyet she\'s always harping on \'what mother would have wanted.\' What I should\r\nlike to know--right now--is what Judith would want if she were here!"\r\n\r\nWith a pang of utter loneliness amid these vexing problems, Roger felt it\r\ncrowding in, this city of his children\'s lives. As he strode on down\r\nBroadway, an old hag selling papers thrust one in his face and he caught a\r\nglimpse of a headline. Some bigwig woman re-divorced. How about Laura\'s\r\n"experiment"? A mob of street urchins nearly upset him. How about Deborah?\r\nHow about children? How about schools, education, the country? How about\r\nGod? Was anyone thinking? Had anyone time? What a racket it made,\r\nslam-banging along. The taxis and motor trucks thundered and brayed, dark\r\nmasses of people swept endlessly by, as though their very souls depended on\r\ntheir dinners or their jobs, their movies, roaring farces, thrills, their\r\nharum scarum dances, clothes. A plump little fool of a woman, her skirt so\r\ntight she could barely walk, tripped by on high-heeled slippers. That was\r\nit, he told himself, the whole city was high-heeled! No solid footing\r\nanywhere! And, good Lord, how they chattered!\r\n\r\nHe turned into a less noisy street. What would Judith want if she were\r\nhere? It became disturbingly clear to him that she would undoubtedly wish\r\nhim to have a talk with Laura now, find out if she\'d really made up her\r\nmind not to have any children, and if so to tell her plainly that she was\r\nnot only going against her God but risking her own happiness. For though\r\nJudith had been liberal about any number of smaller things, she had been\r\ndecidedly clear on this. Yes, he must talk to Laura.\r\n\r\n"And she\'ll tell me," he reflected, "that Edith put me up to it!"\r\n\r\nIf only his oldest daughter would leave the other girls alone! Here she was\r\nplanning a row with Deborah over whether poor young George should be\r\nallowed to play with rats! It was all so silly!... Yes, his three children\r\nwere drifting apart, each one of them going her separate way. And he rather\r\ntook comfort in the thought, for at least it would stop their wrangling.\r\nBut again he pulled himself up with a jerk. No, certainly Judith would not\r\nhave liked this. If she\'d ever stood for anything, it was for keeping the\r\nfamily together. It had been the heart and center of their last talks\r\nbefore she died.\r\n\r\nHis face relaxed as he walked on, but in his eyes was a deeper pain. If\r\nonly Judith could be here. Before he reached home he had made up his mind\r\nto talk with Laura that very night. He drew out his latchkey, opened his\r\ndoor, shut it firmly and strode into his house. In the hall they were\r\nputting down the new carpet. Cautiously picking his way upstairs, he\r\ninquired for Laura and was told she was dressing for dinner. He knocked at\r\nher door.\r\n\r\n"Yes?" came her voice.\r\n\r\n"It\'s I," he said, "your father."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hello, dad," came the answer gaily, in that high sweet voice of hers.\r\n"I\'m frightfully rushed. It\'s a dinner dance to-night for the bridesmaids\r\nand the ushers." Roger felt a glow of relief. "Come in a moment, won\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nWhat a resplendent young creature she was, seated at her dresser. Behind\r\nher the maid with needle and thread was swiftly mending a little tear in\r\nthe fluffy blue tulle she was wearing. The shaded light just over her head\r\nbrought a shimmer of red in her sleek brown hair. What lips she had, what a\r\nbosom. She drew a deep breath and smiled at him.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing to-morrow night?" her father asked her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dad, my love, we have every evening filled and crammed right up to the\r\nwedding," she replied. "No--the last evening I\'ll be here. Hal\'s giving his\r\nushers a dinner that night."\r\n\r\n"Good. I want to talk to you, my dear." He felt his voice solemn, a great\r\nmistake. He saw the quick glance from her luminous eyes.\r\n\r\n"All right, father--whenever you like."\r\n\r\nMuch embarrassed Roger left the room.\r\n\r\nThe few days which remained were a crowding confusion of dressmakers, gowns\r\nand chattering friends and gifts arriving at all hours. As a part of his\r\nresolve to do what he could for his daughter, Roger stayed home from his\r\noffice that week. But all he could do was to unpack boxes, take out\r\npresents and keep the cards, and say, "Yes, my dear, it\'s very nice. Where\r\nshall I put this one?" As the array of presents grew, from time to time\r\nunconsciously he glanced at the engagement ring upon Laura\'s finger. And\r\nall the presents seemed like that. They would suit her apartment\r\nbeautifully. He\'d be glad when they were out of the house.\r\n\r\nThe only gift that appealed to his fancy was a brooch, neither rich nor\r\nnew, a genuine bit of old jewelry. But rather to his annoyance he learned\r\nthat it had been sent to Laura by the old Galician Jew in the shop around\r\nthe corner. It recalled to his mind the curious friendship which had\r\nexisted for so long between the old man and his daughter. And as she turned\r\nthe brooch to the light Roger thought he saw in her eyes anticipations\r\nwhich made him uneasy. Yes, she was a child of his. "June in Paris--"\r\nother Junes--"experiments"--no children. Again he felt he must have that\r\ntalk. But, good Lord, how he dreaded it.\r\n\r\nThe house was almost ready now, dismantled and made new and strange. It was\r\nthe night before the wedding. Laura was taking her supper in bed. What was\r\nhe going to say to her? He ate his dinner silently. At last he rose with\r\ngrim resolution.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ll go up and see her," he said. Deborah quickly glanced at him.\r\n\r\n"What for?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I just want to talk to her--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stay long," she admonished him. "I\'ve a masseuse coming at nine\r\no\'clock to get the child in condition to rest. Her nerves are rather tense,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"How about mine?" he said to himself as he started upstairs. "Never mind,\r\nI\'ve got to tackle it."\r\n\r\nLaura saw what he meant to say the moment that he entered the room, and the\r\ntightening of her features made it all the harder for Roger to think\r\nclearly, to remember the grave, kind, fatherly things which he had intended\r\nto tell her.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to talk of the wedding, child, but of what\'s coming after\r\nthat--between you and this man--all your life." He stopped short, with his\r\nheart in his mouth, for although he did not look at her he had a quick\r\nsensation as though he had struck her in the face.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t this rather late to speak about that? Just now? When I\'m nervous\r\nenough as it is?"\r\n\r\n"I know, I know." He spoke hurriedly, humbly. "I should have talked to you\r\nlong ago, I should have known you better, child. I\'ve been slack and\r\nselfish. But it\'s better late than never."\r\n\r\n"But you needn\'t!" the girl exclaimed. "You needn\'t tell me anything! I\r\nknow more than you think--I know enough!" Roger looked at her, then at the\r\nwall. She went on in a voice rather breathless: "I know what I\'m\r\ndoing--exactly--just what I\'m getting into. It\'s not as it was when you\r\nwere young--it\'s different--we talk of these things. Harold and I have\r\ntalked it all out." In the brief and dangerous pause which followed Roger\r\nkept looking at the wall.\r\n\r\n"Have you talked--about having children?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," came the answer sharply, and then he felt the hot clutch of her\r\nhand. "Hadn\'t you better go now, dad?" He hesitated.\r\n\r\n"No," he said. His voice was low. "Do you mean to have children, Laura?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"I think you do know. Do you mean to have children?" Her big black eyes,\r\ndilating, were fixed defiantly on his own.\r\n\r\n"Well then, no, I don\'t!" she replied. He made a desperate effort to think\r\nwhat he could say to her. Good God, how he was bungling! Where were all his\r\narguments?\r\n\r\n"How about your religion?" he blurted out.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t any--which makes me do that--I\'ve a right to be happy!"\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t!" His voice had suddenly changed. In accent and in quality it\r\nwas like a voice from the heart of New England where he had been born and\r\nbred. "I mean you won\'t be happy--not unless you have a child! It\'s what\r\nyou need--it\'ll fill your life! It\'ll settle you--deepen you--tone you\r\ndown!"\r\n\r\n"Suppose I don\'t want to be toned down!" The girl was almost hysterical.\r\n"I\'m no Puritan--I want to live! I tell you we are different now! We\'re not\r\nall like Edith--and we\'re not like our mothers! We want to live! And we\r\nhave a right to! Why don\'t you go? Can\'t you see I\'m nearly crazy? It\'s my\r\nlast night, my very last! I don\'t want to talk to you--I don\'t even know\r\nwhat I\'m saying! And you come and try to frighten me!" Her voice caught\r\nand broke into sobs. "You know nothing about me! You never did! Leave me\r\nalone, can\'t you--leave me alone!"\r\n\r\n"Father?" He heard Deborah\'s voice, abrupt and stern, outside the door.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," he said hoarsely. He went in blind fashion out of the room and\r\ndown to his study. He lit a cigar and smoked wretchedly there. When\r\npresently Deborah appeared he saw that her face was set and hard; but as\r\nshe caught the baffled look, the angry tortured light in his eyes, her own\r\nexpression softened.\r\n\r\n"Poor father," she said, in a pitying way. "If Edith had only let you\r\nalone."\r\n\r\n"I certainly didn\'t do much good."\r\n\r\n"Of course you didn\'t--you did harm--oh, so much more harm than you know."\r\nInto the quiet voice of his daughter crept a note of keen regret. "I wanted\r\nto make her last days in this house a time she could look back on, so that\r\nshe\'d want to come home for help if ever she\'s in trouble. She has so\r\nlittle--don\'t you see?--of what a woman needs these days. She has grown up\r\nso badly. Oh, if you\'d only let her alone. It was such a bad, bad time to\r\nchoose." She went to her father and kissed him. "Well, it\'s over now," she\r\nsaid, "and we\'ll make the best we can of it. I\'ll tell her you\'re sorry and\r\nquiet her down. And to-morrow we\'ll try to forget it has happened."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor Roger the morrow went by in a whirl. The wedding, a large church\r\naffair, was to take place at twelve o\'clock. He arose early, put on his\r\nPrince Albert, went down and ate his breakfast alone. The waitress was\r\nflustered, the coffee was burnt. He finished and anxiously wandered about.\r\nThe maids were bustling in and out, with Deborah giving orders pellmell.\r\nThe caterers came trooping in. The bridesmaids were arriving and hurrying\r\nup to Roger\'s room. That place was soon a chaos of voices, giggles, peals\r\nof laughter. Laura\'s trunks were brought downstairs, and Roger tagged them\r\nfor the ship, one for the cabin and three for the hold, and saw them into\r\nthe wagon. Then he strode distractedly everywhere, till at last he was\r\nhustled by Deborah into a taxi waiting outside.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all going so smoothly," Deborah said, and a faint sardonic glimmer\r\ncame into her father\'s hunted eyes. Deborah was funny!\r\n\r\nSoon he found himself in the church. He heard whispers, eager voices, heard\r\none usher say to another, "God, what a terrible head I\'ve got!" And Roger\r\nglared at him for that. Plainly these youngsters, all mere boys, had been\r\nup with the groom a good part of the night.... But here was Laura, pale and\r\ntense. She smiled at him and squeezed his hand. There was silence, then the\r\norgan, and now he was taking her up the aisle. Strange faces stared. His\r\njaw set hard. At last they reached the altar. An usher quickly touched his\r\narm and he stepped back where he belonged. He listened but understood\r\nnothing. Just words, words and motions.\r\n\r\n"If any man can show just cause why they may not be lawfully joined\r\ntogether, let him now speak or else hereafter forever hold his peace."\r\n\r\n"No," thought Roger, "I won\'t speak."\r\n\r\nJust then he caught sight of Deborah\'s face, and at the look in her steady\r\ngray eyes all at once he could feel the hot tears in his own.\r\n\r\nAt the wedding breakfast he was gay to a boisterous degree. He talked to\r\nstrange women and brought them food, took punch with men he had never laid\r\neyes on, went off on a feverish hunt for cigars, came back distractedly,\r\njoked with young girls and even started some of them dancing. The whole\r\naffair was over in no time. The bride and the groom came rushing\r\ndownstairs; and as they escaped from the shower of rice, Roger ran after\r\nthem down the steps. He gripped Sloane\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Remember, boy, it\'s her whole life!" entreated Roger hoarsely.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir! I\'ll look out! No fear!"\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, daddy!"\r\n\r\n"God bless you, dear!"\r\n\r\nThey were speeding away. And with the best man, who looked weary and spent,\r\nRoger went slowly back up the steps. It was an effort now to talk. Thank\r\nHeaven these people soon were gone. Last of all went the ponderous aunt of\r\nthe groom. How the taxi groaned as he helped her inside and started her off\r\nto Bridgeport. Back in his study he found his cigars and smoked one\r\ndismally with Bruce. Bruce was a decent sort of chap. He knew when to be\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n"Well," he spoke finally, rising, "I guess I\'ll have to get back to the\r\noffice." He smiled a little and put his hand on Roger\'s weary shoulder.\r\n"We\'re glad it\'s over--eh?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Bruce," said Roger heavily, "you\'ve got a girl of your own growing up.\r\nDon\'t let her grow to feel you\'re old. Live on with her. She\'ll need you."\r\nHis massive blunt face darkened. "The world\'s so damnably new," he\r\nmuttered, "so choked up with fool ideas." Bruce still smiled\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n"Go up and see Edith," he said, "and forget \'em. She never lets one into\r\nthe flat. She said you were to be sure to come and tell her about the\r\nwedding."\r\n\r\n"All right, I\'ll go," said Roger. He hunted about for his hat and coat.\r\nWhat a devilish mess they had made of the house. A half hour later he was\r\nwith Edith; but there, despite his efforts to answer all her questions, he\r\ngrew heavier and heavier, till at last he barely spoke. He sat watching\r\nEdith\'s baby.\r\n\r\n"Did you talk to Laura?" he heard her ask.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied. "It did no good." He knew that Edith was waiting for\r\nmore, but he kept doggedly silent.\r\n\r\n"Well, dear," she said presently, "at least you did what you could for\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never done what I could," he rejoined. "Not with any one of you." He\r\nglanced at her with a twinge of pain. "I don\'t know as it would have helped\r\nmuch if I had. This town is running away with itself. I want a rest now,\r\nEdith, I want things quiet for a while." He felt her anxious, pitying look.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Deborah?" she asked him. "Gone back to school already?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know where she is," he replied. And then he rose forlornly. "I\r\nguess I\'ll be going back home," he said.\r\n\r\nOn his way, as his thoughts slowly cleared, the old uneasiness rose in his\r\nmind. Would Deborah want to keep the house? Suppose she suggested moving to\r\nsome titty-tatty little flat. No, he would not stand in her way. But, Lord,\r\nwhat an end to make of his life.\r\n\r\nHis home was almost dark inside, but he noticed rather to his surprise that\r\nthe rooms had already been put in order. He sank down on the living room\r\nsofa and lay motionless for a while. How tired he was. From time to time he\r\ndrearily sighed. Yes, Deborah would find him old and life here dull and\r\nlonely. Where was she to-night, he wondered. Couldn\'t she quit her zoo\r\nschool for one single afternoon? At last, when the room had grown pitch\r\ndark, he heard the maid lighting the gas in the hall. Roger loudly cleared\r\nhis throat, and at the sound the startled girl ejaculated, "Oh, my Gawd!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s I," said Roger sternly. "Did Miss Deborah say when she\'d be back?"\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t go out, sir. She\'s up in her room."\r\n\r\nRoger went up and found her there. All afternoon with both the maids she\r\nhad been setting the house to rights, and now she ached in every limb. She\r\nwas lying on her bed, and she looked as though she had been crying.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"At Edith\'s," her father answered. She reached up and took his hand, and\r\nheld it slowly tighter.\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t going to find it too lonely here, with Laura gone?" she asked\r\nhim. And the wistfulness in her deep sweet voice made something thrill in\r\nRoger.\r\n\r\n"Why should I?" he retorted. Deborah gave a queer little laugh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m just silly, that\'s all," she said. "I\'ve been having a fit of\r\nblues. I\'ve been feeling so old this afternoon--a regular old woman. I\r\nwanted you, dearie, and I was afraid that you--" she broke off.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Roger sharply. "Do you really want to keep this house?"\r\n\r\n"Keep this house? Why, father!"\r\n\r\n"You think you can stand it here alone, just the two of us?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"I can," cried Deborah happily. Her father walked to the window. There as\r\nhe looked blindly out, his eyes were assaulted by the lights of all those\r\ntitty-tatty flats. And a look of vicious triumph appeared for a moment on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n"Very well," he said quietly, turning back. "Then we\'re both suited." He\r\nwent to the door. "I\'ll go and wash up for supper," he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to him to find how smoothly he and Deborah dropped back\r\ninto their old relations. It was good to get home those evenings; for in\r\nthis new stage of its existence, with its family of two, the house appeared\r\nto have filled itself with a deep reposeful feeling. Laura had gone out of\r\nits life. He glanced into her room one night, and it looked like a guest\r\nroom now. The sight of it brought him a pang of regret. But the big ship\r\nwhich was bearing her swiftly away to "Paris in June" seemed bearing off\r\nRoger\'s uneasiness too. He could smile at his former fears, for Laura was\r\nsafely married and wildly in love with her husband. Time, he thought, would\r\ntake care of the rest. Occasionally he missed her here--her voice,\r\nhigh-pitched but musical, chatting and laughing at the \'phone, her bustle\r\nof dressing to go out, glimpses of her extravagances, of her smart suits\r\nand evening gowns, of all the joyous color and dash that she had given to\r\nhis home. But these regrets soon died away. The old house shed them easily,\r\nas though glad to enter this long rest.\r\n\r\nFor the story of his family, from Roger\'s point of view at least, was a\r\nlong uneven narrative, with prolonged periods of peace and again with\r\nevents piling one on the other. And now there came one of those peaceful\r\ntimes, and Roger liked the quiet. The old routine was re-established--his\r\ndinner, his paper, his cigar and then his book for the evening, some good\r\nold-fashioned novel or some pleasant book of travel which he and Judith had\r\nread aloud when they were planning out their lives. They had meant to go\r\nabroad so often when the children had grown up. And he liked to read about\r\nit still. Life was so quiet over the sea, things were so old and mellow\r\nthere. He resumed, too, his horseback rides, and on the way home he would\r\nstop in for a visit with Edith and her baby. The wee boy grew funnier every\r\nday, with his sudden kicks and sneezes, his waving fists and mighty yawns.\r\nAnd Roger felt drawn to his daughter here, for in these grateful seasons of\r\nrest that followed the birth of each of her children, Edith loved to lie\r\nvery still and make new plans for her small brood.\r\n\r\nOnly once she spoke of Laura, and then it was to suggest to him that he\r\ngather together all the bills his daughter had doubtless left behind.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t settle them," Edith said, "they\'ll go to her husband. And you\r\nwouldn\'t like that, would you?"\r\n\r\nRoger said he would see to it, and one evening after dinner he started in\r\non Laura\'s bills. It was rather an appalling time. He looked into his bank\r\naccount and found that Laura\'s wedding would take about all his surplus.\r\nBut this did not dismay him much, for money matters never did. It simply\r\nmeant more work in the office.\r\n\r\nThe next day he rose early and was in his office by nine o\'clock. He had\r\nnot been so prompt in months, and many of his employees came in late that\r\nmorning. But nobody seemed very much perturbed, for Roger was an easy\r\nemployer. Still, he sternly told himself, he had been letting things get\r\naltogether too slack. He had been neglecting his business again. The work\r\nhad become so cut and dried, there was nothing creative left to do. It had\r\nnot been so in years gone by. Those years had fairly bristled with ideas\r\nand hopes and schemes. But even those old memories were no longer here to\r\nhearten him. They had all been swept away when Bruce had made him move out\r\nof his office in a dark creaky edifice down close under Brooklyn Bridge,\r\nand come up to this new building, this steel-ribbed caravansary for all\r\nkinds of business ventures, this place of varnished woodwork, floods of\r\ndaylight, concrete floors, this building fireproof throughout. That\r\nexpressed it exactly, Roger thought. Nothing could take fire here, not even\r\na man\'s imagination, even though he did not feel old. Now and then in the\r\nelevator, as some youngster with eager eyes pushed nervously against him,\r\nRoger would frown and wonder, "What are you so excited about?"\r\n\r\nBut again the business was running down, and this time he must jerk it back\r\nbefore it got beyond him. He set himself doggedly to the task, calling in\r\nhis assistants one by one, going through the work in those outer rooms,\r\nwhere at tables long rows of busy young girls, with colored pencils,\r\nscissors and paste, were demolishing enormous piles of newspapers and\r\nmagazines. And vaguely, little by little, he came to a realization of how\r\nwhile he had slumbered the life of the country had swept on. For as he\r\nstudied the lists and the letters of his patrons, Roger felt confusedly\r\nthat a new America was here.\r\n\r\nClippings, clippings, clippings. Business men and business firms, gigantic\r\ncorporations, kept sending here for clippings, news of themselves or their\r\nrivals, keeping keen watch on each other\'s affairs for signs of strength or\r\nweakness. How savage was the fight these days. Here was news of mines and\r\nmills and factories all over the land, clippings sent each morning by\r\nspecial messengers downtown to reach the brokers\' offices before the market\r\nopened. One broker wrote, "Please quote your terms for the following. From\r\nnine to two o\'clock each day our messenger will call at your office every\r\nhour for clippings giving information of the companies named below."\r\n\r\nThe long list appended carried Roger\'s fancy out all over the continent.\r\nAnd then came this injunction: "Remember that our messenger must leave your\r\noffice every hour. In information of this kind every minute counts."\r\n\r\nClippings, clippings, clippings. As Roger turned over his morning mail, in\r\nspite of himself he grew absorbed. What a change in the world of\r\nliterature. What a host of names of scribblers, not authors but just\r\nwriters, not only men but women too, novelists and dramatists, poets and\r\nmuckrakers all jumbled in together, each one of them straining for a place.\r\nAnd the actors and the actresses, the musicians and the lecturers, each\r\nwith his press agent and avid for publicity, "fame!" And here were society\r\nwomen, from New York and other cities, all eager for press notices of\r\nsocial affairs they had given or managed, charity work they had conducted,\r\nsuffrage speeches they had made. Half the women in the land were fairly\r\ntalking their heads off, it seemed. Some had been on his lists for years.\r\nThey married and wanted to hear what was said in the papers about their\r\nweddings, they quarreled and got divorces and still sent here for\r\nclippings, they died and still their relatives wrote in for the funeral\r\nnotices. And even death was commercialized. A maker of monuments wanted\r\nnews "of all people of large means, dead or dangerously ill, in the State\r\nof Pennsylvania." Here were demands from charity bodies, hospitals and\r\ncolleges, from clergymen with an anxious eye on the Monday morning papers.\r\nAnd here was an anarchist millionaire! And here was an insane asylum\r\nwanting to see itself in print!\r\n\r\nWith a grim smile on his heavy visage, Roger stared out of his window.\r\nSlowly the smile faded, a wistful look came on his face.\r\n\r\n"Who\'ll take my business when I\'m gone?"\r\n\r\nIf his small son had only lived, with what new zest and vigor it might have\r\nbeen made to grow and expand. If only his son had been here by his side....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nDEBORAH needed rest, he thought, for the bright attractive face of his\r\ndaughter was looking rather pale of late, and the birthmark on her forehead\r\nshowed a faint thin line of red. One night at dinner, watching her, he\r\nwondered what was on her mind. She had come in late, and though several\r\ntimes she had made an effort to keep up the conversation, her cheeks were\r\nalmost colorless and more than once in her deepset eyes came a flash of\r\npain that startled him.\r\n\r\n"Look here. What\'s the matter with you?" he asked. Deborah looked up\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather not talk about it, dad--"\r\n\r\n"Very well," he answered. And with a slight hesitation, "But I think I know\r\nthe trouble," he said. "And perhaps some other time--when you do feel like\r\ntalking--" He stopped, for on her wide sensitive lips he saw a twitch of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n"What do you think is the trouble?" she asked. And Roger looked at her\r\nsquarely.\r\n\r\n"Loneliness," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Why?" she asked him.\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s Edith\'s baby--and Laura getting married--"\r\n\r\n"I see--and so I\'m lonely for a family of my own. But you\'re forgetting my\r\nschool," she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I know," he retorted. "But that\'s not at all the same.\r\nInteresting work, no doubt, but--well, it isn\'t personal."\r\n\r\n"Oh, isn\'t it?" she answered, and she drew a quivering breath. Rising from\r\nthe table she went into the living room, and there a few moments later he\r\nfound her walking up and down. "I think I will tell you now," she said.\r\n"I\'m afraid of being alone to-night, of keeping this matter to myself." He\r\nlooked at her apprehensively.\r\n\r\n"Very well, my dear," he said.\r\n\r\n"This is the trouble," she began. "Down in my school we\'ve a family of\r\nabout three thousand children. A few I get to know so well I try to follow\r\nthem when they leave. And one of these, an Italian boy--his name is Joe\r\nBolini--was one of the best I ever had, and one of the most appealing. But\r\nJoe took to drinking and got in with a gang of boys who blackmailed small\r\nshopkeepers. He used to come to me at times in occasional moods of\r\nrepentance. He was a splendid physical type and he\'d been a leader in our\r\nathletics, so I took him back into the school to manage our teams in\r\nbasket-ball. He left the gang and stopped drinking, and we had long talks\r\ntogether about his great ambition. He wanted to enter the Fire Department\r\nas soon as he was twenty-one. And I promised to use my influence." She\r\nstopped, still frowning slightly.\r\n\r\n"What happened?" Roger asked her.\r\n\r\n"His girl took up with another man, and Joe has hot Italian blood. He got\r\ndrunk one night and--shot them both." There was another silence. "I did\r\nwhat I could," she said harshly, "but he had a bad record behind him, and\r\nthe young assistant district attorney had his own record to think of, too.\r\nSo Joe got a death sentence. We appealed the case but it did no good. He\r\nwas sent up the river and is in the death house now--and he sent for me to\r\ncome to-day. His letter hinted he was scared, he wrote that his priest was\r\nno good to him. So I went up this afternoon. Joe goes to the chair\r\nto-morrow at six."\r\n\r\nDeborah went to the sofa and sat down inertly. Roger remained motionless,\r\nand a dull chill crept over him.\r\n\r\n"So you see my work is personal," he heard her mutter presently. All at\r\nonce she seemed so far away, such a stranger to him in this life of hers.\r\n\r\n"By George, it\'s horrible!" he said. "I\'m sorry you went to see the boy!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad," was his daughter\'s quick retort. "I\'ve been getting much too\r\nsure of myself--of my school, I mean, and what it can do. I needed this to\r\nbring me back to the kind of world we live in!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" he roughly asked.\r\n\r\n"I mean there are schools and prisons! And gallows and electric chairs! And\r\nI\'m for schools! They\'ve tried their jails and gallows for whole black\r\nhideous centuries! What good have they done? If they\'d given Joe back to\r\nthe school and me, I\'d have had him a fireman in a year! I know, because I\r\nstudied him hard! He\'d have _grown_ fighting fires, he would have _saved_\r\nlives!"\r\n\r\nAgain she stopped, with a catch of her breath. In suspense he watched her\r\nangry struggle to regain control of herself. She sat bolt upright, rigid;\r\nher birthmark showed a fiery red. In a few moments he saw her relax.\r\n\r\n"But of course," she added wearily, "it\'s much more complex than that. A\r\nschool is nothing nowadays--just by itself alone, I mean--it\'s only a part\r\nof a city\'s life--which for most tenement children is either very dull and\r\nhard, or cheap and false and overexciting. And behind all that lie the\r\nreasons for that. And there are so many reasons." She stared straight past\r\nher father as though at something far away. Then she seemed to recall\r\nherself: "But I\'m talking too much of my family."\r\n\r\nRoger carefully lit a cigar:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you are, my dear. I\'d like to hear more about it." She\r\nsmiled:\r\n\r\n"To keep my mind off Joe, you mean."\r\n\r\n"And mine, too," he answered.\r\n\r\nThey had a long talk that evening about her hope of making her school what\r\nRoger visaged confusedly as a kind of mammoth home, the center of a\r\nneighborhood, of one prodigious family. At times when the clock on the\r\nmantle struck the hour loud and clear, there would fall a sudden silence,\r\nas both thought of what was to happen at dawn. But quickly Roger would\r\nquestion again and Deborah would talk steadily on. It was after midnight\r\nwhen she stopped.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been good to me to-night, dearie," she said. "Let\'s go to bed now,\r\nshall we?"\r\n\r\n"Very well," he answered. He looked at his daughter anxiously. She no\r\nlonger seemed to him mature. He could feel what heavy discouragements, what\r\nproblems she was facing in the dark mysterious tenement world which she had\r\nchosen to make her own. And compared to these she seemed a mere girl, a\r\nchild groping its way, just making a start. And so he added wistfully, "I\r\nwish I could be of more help to you." She looked up at him for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Do you know why you are such a help?" she said. "It\'s because you have\r\nnever grown old--because you\'ve never allowed yourself to grow absolutely\r\ncertain about anything in life." A smile half sad and half perplexed came\r\non her father\'s heavy face.\r\n\r\n"You consider that a strong point?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I do," she replied, "compared to being a bundle of creeds and prejudices."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve got prejudices enough."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said. "And so have I. But we\'re not even sure of _them_, these\r\ndays."\r\n\r\n"The world has a habit of crowding in," her father muttered vaguely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRoger did not sleep that night. He could not keep his thoughts away from\r\nwhat was going to happen at dawn. Yes, the city was crowding in upon this\r\nquiet house of his. Dimly he could recollect, in the genial years of long\r\nago, just glancing casually now and then at some small and unobtrusive\r\nnotice in his evening paper: "Execution at Sing Sing." It had been so\r\nremote to him. But here it was smashing into his house, through the life\r\nhis own daughter was leading day and night among the poor! Each time he\r\nthought of that lad in a cell, again a chill crept over him! But savagely\r\nhe shook it off, and by a strong effort of his will he turned his thoughts\r\nto the things she had told him about her school. Yes, in her main idea she\r\nwas right. He had no use for wild reforms, but here was something solid, a\r\ngood education for every child. More than once, while she had talked,\r\nsomething very deep in Roger had leaped up in swift response.\r\n\r\nFor Deborah, too, was a part of himself. He, too, had had his feeling for\r\nhumanity in the large. For years he had run a boys\' club at a little\r\nmission school in which his wife had been interested, and on Christmas Eve\r\nhe had formed the habit of gathering up a dozen small urchins right off the\r\nstreet and taking them \'round and fitting them out with good warm winter\r\nclothing, after which he had gone home to help Judith trim the Christmas\r\ntree and fill their children\'s stockings. And later, when she had gone to\r\nbed, invariably he had taken "The Christmas Carol" from its shelf and had\r\nsettled down with a glow of almost luxurious brotherhood. There was\r\nsentiment in Roger Gale, and as he read of "Tiny Tim" his deepset eyes\r\nwould glisten with tears.\r\n\r\nAnd now here was Deborah fulfilling a part of him in herself. "You will\r\nlive on in our children\'s lives." But this was going much too far! She was\r\nletting herself be swallowed up completely by this work of hers! It was all\r\nvery well for the past ten years, but she was getting on in age! High time\r\nto marry and settle down!\r\n\r\nAgain angrily he shook off the thought of that boy Joe alone in a cell,\r\neyes fixed in animal terror upon the steel door which would open so soon.\r\n\r\nThe day was slowly breaking. It was the early part of June. How fresh and\r\nlovely it must be up there in the big mountains with Edith\'s happy little\r\nlads. Here it was raw and garish, weird. Some sparrows began quarreling\r\njust outside his window. Roger rose and walked the room. Restlessly he went\r\ninto the hall. The old house appeared so strange in this light--as though\r\nstripped bare--there was something gone. Softly he came to Deborah\'s door.\r\nIt was open wide, for the night had been warm, and she lay awake upon her\r\nbed with her gaze fixed on the ceiling. She turned her head and saw him\r\nthere. He came in and sat down by her window. For a long time neither made\r\na sound. Then the great clock on the distant tower, which had been silent\r\nthrough the night, resumed its deep and measured boom. It struck six times.\r\nThere was silence again. More and more taut grew his muscles, and suddenly\r\nit felt to him as though Deborah\'s fierce agony were pounding into his very\r\nsoul. The slow, slow minutes throbbed away. At last he rose and left her.\r\nThere was a cold sweat on his brow.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go down and make her some coffee," he thought.\r\n\r\nDown in the kitchen it was a relief to bang about hunting for the utensils.\r\nOn picnics up in the mountains his coffee had been famous. He made some now\r\nand boiled some eggs, and they breakfasted in Deborah\'s room. She seemed\r\nalmost herself again. Later, while he was dressing, he saw her in the\r\ndoorway. She was looking at her father with bright and grateful,\r\naffectionate eyes.\r\n\r\n"Will you come to school with me to-day? I\'d like you to see it," Deborah\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Very well," he answered gruffly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of the subway they emerged into a noisy tenement street. Roger had\r\nknown such streets as this, but only in the night-time, as picturesque and\r\nadventurous ways in an underground world he had explored in search of\r\nstrange old glittering rings. It was different now. Gone were the Rembrandt\r\nshadows, the leaping flare of torches, the dark surging masses of weird\r\nuncouth humanity. Here in garish daylight were poverty and ugliness, here\r\nwere heaps of refuse and heavy smells and clamor. It disgusted and repelled\r\nhim, and he was tempted to turn back. But glancing at Deborah by his side\r\nhe thought of the night she had been through. No, he decided, he would go\r\non and see what she was up to here.\r\n\r\nThey turned into a narrower street between tall dirty tenements, and in a\r\ntwinkling all was changed. For the street, as far as he could see, was gay\r\nwith flaunting colors, torrents of bobbing hats and ribbons, frocks and\r\nblouses, shirts and breeches, vivid reds and yellows and blues. It was\r\ndeafening with joyous cries, a shrill incessant chatter, chatter, piercing\r\nyells and shrieks of laughter. Children, swarms of children, children of\r\nall sizes passed him, clean and dirty, smiling, scowling, hurrying,\r\nrunning, pummeling, grabbing, whirling each other \'round and \'round--till\r\nthe very air seemed quivering with wild spirits and new life!\r\n\r\nHe heard Deborah laughing. Five hilarious small boys had hold of her hands\r\nand were marching in triumph waving their caps. "Heigh there--heigh there!\r\nHeigh--heigh--heigh!"\r\n\r\nThe school was close in front of them. An enormous building of brick and\r\ntile wedged into a disordered mass of tenements, shops and factories, it\r\nhad been built around a court shut out from the street by a high steel\r\nfence. They squeezed into the gateway, through which a shouting punching\r\nmob of urchins were now pushing in; and soon from a balcony above Roger\r\nlooked down into the court, where out of a wild chaos order was appearing.\r\nBoys to the right and girls to the left were forming in long sinuous lines,\r\nand three thousand faces were turned toward the building. In front appeared\r\nthe Stars and Stripes. Then suddenly he heard a crash from underneath the\r\nbalcony, and looking down he saw a band made up of some thirty or forty\r\nboys. Their leader, a dark Italian lad, made a flourish, a pass with his\r\nbaton, and the band broke into a blaring storm, an uproarious, booming\r\nmarch. The mob below fell into step, and line after line in single file the\r\nchildren marched into their school.\r\n\r\n"Look up! Look all around you!" He heard Deborah\'s eager voice in his ear.\r\nAnd as he looked up from the court below he gave a low cry of amazement. In\r\nhundreds of windows all around, of sweatshops, tenements, factories, on\r\ntier upon tier of fire escapes and even upon the roofs above, silent\r\nwatchers had appeared. For this one moment in the day the whole congested\r\nneighborhood had stopped its feverish labor and become an amphitheater with\r\nall eyes upon the school. And the thought flashed into Roger\'s mind:\r\n"Deborah\'s big family!"\r\n\r\nHe had a strange confusing time. In her office, in a daze, he sat and heard\r\nhis daughter with her two assistant principals, her clerk and her\r\nstenographer, plunge into the routine work of the day. What kind of school\r\nteacher was this? She seemed more like the manager of some buzzing factory.\r\nMessages kept coming constantly from class-rooms, children came for\r\npunishment, and on each small human problem she was passing judgment\r\nquickly. Meanwhile a score of mothers, most of them Italians with colored\r\nshawls upon their heads, had straggled in and taken seats, and one by one\r\nthey came to her desk. For these women who had been children in peasant\r\nhuts in Italy now had children of their own in the great city of New York,\r\nand they found it very baffling. How to keep them in at night? How to make\r\nthem go to the priest? How to feed and clothe them? How to live in these\r\ntenement homes, in this wild din and chaos? They wanted help and they\r\nwanted advice. Deborah spoke in Italian, but turning to her father she\r\nwould translate from time to time.\r\n\r\nA tired scowling woman said, "My boy won\'t obey me. His father is dead.\r\nWhen I slap him he only jumps away. I lock him in and he steals the key, he\r\nkeeps it in his pocket. He steals the money that I earn. He says I\'m from\r\nthe country." And a flabby anxious woman said, "My girl runs out to dance\r\nhalls. Sometimes she comes back at two in the morning. She is fifteen and\r\nshe ought to get married. But what can I do? A nice steady man who never\r\ndances comes sometimes to see her--but she makes faces and calls him a\r\nfatty, she dances before him and pushes him out and slams the door. What\r\ncan I do?"\r\n\r\n"Please come and see our janitor and make him fix our kitchen sink!" an\r\nangry little woman cried. "When I try to wash the dishes the water spouts\r\nall over me!" And then a plump rosy mother said in a soft coaxing voice, "I\r\nhave eight little children, all nice and clean. When you tell them to do\r\nanything they always do it quickly. They smile at you, they are like\r\nsaints. So could the kind beautiful teacher fix it up with a newspaper to\r\nsend them to the country--this summer when it is so hot? The newspaper\r\ncould send a man and he could take our pictures."\r\n\r\n"Most of us girls used to be in this school," said a bright looking Jewess\r\nof eighteen. "And you taught us how we should live nice. But how can we\r\nlive nice when our shop is so rotten? Our boss is trying to kiss the\r\ngirls, he is trying to hug them on the stairs. And what he pays us is a\r\njoke, and we must work till nine o\'clock. So will you help us, teacher, and\r\ngive us a room for our meetings here? We want to have a union."\r\n\r\nA truant officer brought in two ragged, frightened little chaps. Found on\r\nthe street during school hours, they had to give an account of themselves.\r\nSullenly one of them gave an address far up in the Bronx, ten miles away.\r\nThey had not been home for a week, he said. Was he lying? What was to be\r\ndone? Somewhere in the city their homes must be discovered. And the talk of\r\nthe truant officer made Roger feel ramifications here which wound out\r\nthrough the police and the courts to reformatories, distant cells. He\r\nthought of that electric chair, and suddenly he felt oppressed by the heavy\r\ncomplexity of it all.\r\n\r\nAnd this was part and parcel of his daughter\'s daily work in school! Still\r\ndazed, disturbed but curious, he sat and watched and listened, while the\r\nbewildering demands of Deborah\'s big family kept crowding in upon her. He\r\nwent to a few of the class-rooms and found that reading and writing,\r\narithmetic and spelling were being taught in ways which he had never\r\ndreamed of. He found a kindergarten class, a carpenter shop and a printing\r\nshop, a sewing class and a cooking class in a large model kitchen. He\r\nwatched the nurse in her hospital room, he went into the dental clinic\r\nwhere a squad of fifty urchins were having their teeth examined, and out\r\nupon a small side roof he found a score of small invalids in steamer\r\nchairs, all fast asleep. It was a strange astounding school! He heard\r\nDeborah speak of a mothers\' club and a neighborhood association; and he\r\nlearned of other ventures here, the school doctor, the nurse and the\r\nvisitor endlessly making experiments, delving into the neighborhood for\r\nways to meet its problems. And by the way Deborah talked to them he felt\r\nshe had gone before, that years ago by day and night she had been over the\r\nground alone. And she\'d done all this while she lived in his house!\r\n\r\nScattered memories out of the past, mere fragments she had told him, here\r\nflashed back into his mind: humorous little incidents of daily battles she\r\nhad waged in rotten old tenement buildings with rags and filth and garbage,\r\nwith vermin, darkness and disease. Mingled with these had been accounts of\r\ndances, weddings and christenings and of curious funeral rites. And\r\nstruggling with such dim memories of Deborah in her twenties, called forth\r\nin his mind by the picture of the woman of thirty here, Roger grew still\r\nmore confused. What was to be the end of it? She was still but a pioneer in\r\na jungle, endlessly groping and trying new things.\r\n\r\n"How many children are there in the public schools?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"About eight hundred thousand," Deborah said.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord!" he groaned, and he felt within him a glow of indignation rise\r\nagainst these immigrant women for breeding so inconsiderately. With the mad\r\ncity growing so fast, and the people of the tenements breeding, breeding,\r\nbreeding, and packing the schools to bursting, what could any teacher be\r\nbut a mere cog in a machine, ponderous, impersonal, blind, grinding out\r\nfuture New Yorkers?\r\n\r\nHe reached home limp and battered from the storm of new impressions coming\r\non top of his sleepless night. He had thought of a school as a simple\r\nplace, filled with little children, mischievous at times perhaps and some\r\nwith dirty faces, but still with minds and spirits clean, unsoiled as yet\r\nby contact with the grim spirit of the town. He had thought of childhood as\r\nsomething intimate and pure, inside his home, his family. Instead of that,\r\nin Deborah\'s school he had been disturbed and thrilled by the presence all\r\naround him of something wild, barbaric, dark, compounded of the city\r\nstreets, of surging crowds, of rushing feet, of turmoil, filth, disease and\r\ndeath, of poverty and vice and crime. But Roger could still hear that band.\r\nAnd behind its blaring crash and din he had felt the vital throbbing of a\r\ntremendous joyousness, of gaiety, fresh hopes and dreams, of leaping young\r\nemotions like deep buried bubbling springs bursting up resistlessly to\r\nrenew the fevered life of the town! Deborah\'s big family! Everybody\'s\r\nchildren!\r\n\r\n"You will live on in our children\'s lives." The vision hidden in those\r\nwords now opened wide before his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nShe told him the next morning her night school closed for the summer that\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n"I think I should like to see it," her father said determinedly. She gave\r\nhim an affectionate smile:\r\n\r\n"Oh, dearie. Haven\'t you had enough?"\r\n\r\n"I guess I can stand it if you can," was his gruff rejoinder, "though if I\r\nran a school like yours I think by night I\'d have schooled enough. Do most\r\nprincipals run night schools too?"\r\n\r\n"A good many of them do."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it taxing your strength?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you have to tax your strength," his daughter replied good humoredly,\r\n"to really accomplish anything? Don\'t you have to risk yourself in order to\r\nreally live these days? Suppose you come down to-morrow night. We won\'t go\r\nto the school, for I doubt if the clubs and classes would interest you very\r\nmuch. I\'ll take you through the neighborhood."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey went down the following evening. The night was warm and humid, and\r\nthrough the narrow tenement streets there poured a teeming mass of life.\r\nPeople by the thousands passed, bareheaded, men in shirt sleeves, their\r\nfaces glistening with sweat. Animal odors filled the air. The torches on\r\nthe pushcarts threw flaring lights and shadows, the peddlers shouted\r\nhoarsely, the tradesmen in the booths and stalls joined in with cries,\r\nshrill peals of mirth. The mass swept onward, talking, talking, and its\r\nvoice was a guttural roar. Small boys and girls with piercing yells kept\r\ndarting under elbows, old women dozed on doorsteps, babies screamed on\r\nevery side. Mothers leaned out of windows, and by their faces you could see\r\nthat they were screaming angrily for children to come up to bed. But you\r\ncould not hear their cries. Here around a hurdy gurdy gravely danced some\r\nlittle girls. A tense young Jew, dark faced and thin, was shouting from a\r\nwagon that all men and women must be free and own the factories and mills.\r\nA mob of small boys, clustered \'round a "camp fire" they had made on the\r\nstreet, were leaping wildly through the flames. It was a mammoth cauldron\r\nhere, seething, bubbling over with a million foreign lives. Deborah\'s big\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nShe turned into a doorway, went down a long dark passage and came into a\r\ncourt-yard enclosed by greasy tenement walls that reared to a spot of dark\r\nblue sky where a few quiet stars were twinkling down. With a feeling of\r\nrepugnance Roger followed his daughter into a tall rear building and up a\r\nrickety flight of stairs. On the fourth landing she knocked at a door, and\r\npresently it was opened by a stout young Irish woman with flushed haggard\r\nfeatures and disheveled hair.\r\n\r\n"Oh. Good evening, Mrs. Berry."\r\n\r\n"Good evening. Come in," was the curt reply. They entered a small stifling\r\nroom where were a stove, two kitchen chairs and three frowzled beds in\r\ncorners. On one of the beds lay a baby asleep, on another two small\r\nrestless boys sat up and watched the visitors. A sick man lay upon the\r\nthird. And a cripple boy, a boarder here, stood on his crutches watching\r\nthem. Roger was struck at once by his face. Over the broad cheek bones the\r\nsallow skin was tightly drawn, but there was a determined set to the jaws\r\nthat matched the boy\'s shrewd grayish eyes, and his face lit up in a\r\nwonderful smile.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Miss Deborah," he said. His voice had a cheery quality.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Johnny. How are you?"\r\n\r\n"Fine, thank you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good. I\'ve brought my father with me."\r\n\r\n"Howdado, sir, glad to meet you."\r\n\r\n"It\'s some time since you\'ve been to see me, John," Deborah continued.\r\n\r\n"I know it is," he answered. And then with a quick jerk of his head, "He\'s\r\nbeen pretty bad," he said. Roger looked at the man on the bed. With his\r\nthin waxen features drawn, the man was gasping for each breath.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" Roger whispered.\r\n\r\n"Lungs," said the young woman harshly. "You needn\'t bother to speak so low.\r\nHe can\'t hear you anyhow. He\'s dying. He\'s been dying weeks."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you let me know of this?" Deborah asked gently.\r\n\r\n"Because I knew what you\'d want to do--take him off to a hospital! And I\r\nain\'t going to have it! I promised him he could die at home!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," Deborah answered. There was a moment\'s silence, and the baby\r\nwhimpered in its sleep. One child had gone to his father\'s bed and was\r\nfrowning at his agony as though it were a tiresome sight.\r\n\r\n"Are any of them coughing?" Deborah inquired.\r\n\r\n"No," said the woman sharply.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they are, two of \'em," John cheerfully corrected her.\r\n\r\n"You shut up!" she said to him, and she turned back to Deborah. "It\'s my\r\nhome, I guess, and my family, too. So what do you think that _you_ can do?"\r\nDeborah looked at her steadily.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s your family," she agreed. "And it\'s none of my business, I\r\nknow--except that John is one of my boys--and if things are to go on like\r\nthis I can\'t let him board here any more. If he had let me know before I\'d\r\nhave taken him from you sooner. You\'ll miss the four dollars a week he\r\npays."\r\n\r\nThe woman swallowed fiercely. The flush on her face had deepened. She\r\nscowled to keep back the tears.\r\n\r\n"We can all die for all I care! I\'ve about got to the end of my rope!"\r\n\r\n"I see you have." Deborah\'s voice was low. "You\'ve made a hard plucky\r\nfight, Mrs. Berry. Are there any empty rooms left in this building?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, two upstairs. What do you want to know for?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to rent them for you. I\'ll arrange it to-night with the janitor,\r\non condition that you promise to move your children to-morrow upstairs and\r\nkeep them there until this is over. Will you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"That\'s sensible. And I\'ll have one of the visiting nurses here within an\r\nhour."\r\n\r\n"Thanks."\r\n\r\n"And later on we\'ll have a talk."\r\n\r\n"All right--"\r\n\r\n"Good-night, Mrs. Berry."\r\n\r\n"Good-night, Miss Gale, I\'m much obliged.... Say, wait a minute! Will you?"\r\nThe wife had followed them out on the landing and she was clutching\r\nDeborah\'s arm. "Why can\'t the nurse give him something," she whispered, "to\r\nput him to sleep for good and all? It ain\'t right to let a man suffer like\r\nthat! I can\'t stand it! I\'m--I\'m--" she broke off with a sob. Deborah put\r\none arm around her and held her steadily for a moment.\r\n\r\n"The nurse will see that he sleeps," she said. "Now, John," she added,\r\npresently, when the woman had gone into the room, "I want you to get your\r\nthings together. I\'ll have the janitor move them upstairs. You sleep there\r\nto-night, and to-morrow morning come to see me at the school."\r\n\r\n"All right, Miss Deborah, much obliged. I\'ll be all right. Good-night,\r\nsir--"\r\n\r\n"Good-night, my boy," said Roger, and suddenly he cleared his throat. He\r\nfollowed his daughter down the stairs. A few minutes she talked with the\r\njanitor, then joined her father in the court.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry I took you up there," she said. "I didn\'t know the man was\r\nsick."\r\n\r\n"Who are they?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Poor people," she said. And Roger flinched.\r\n\r\n"Who is this boy?"\r\n\r\n"A neighbor of theirs. His mother, who was a widow, died about two years\r\nago. He was left alone and scared to death lest he should be \'put away\' in\r\nsome big institution. He got Mrs. Berry to take him in, and to earn his\r\nboard he began selling papers instead of coming to our school. So our\r\nschool visitor looked him up. Since then I have been paying his board from\r\na fund I have from friends uptown, and so he has finished his schooling.\r\nHe\'s to graduate next week. He means to be a stenographer."\r\n\r\n"How old is he?"\r\n\r\n"Seventeen," she replied.\r\n\r\n"How was he crippled? Born that way?"\r\n\r\n"No. When he was a baby his mother dropped him one Saturday night when she\r\nwas drunk. He has never been able to sit down. He can lie down or he can\r\nstand. He\'s always in pain, it never stops. I learned that from the doctor\r\nI took him to see. But whenever you ask him how he feels you get the same\r\nanswer always: \'Fine, thank you.\' He\'s a fighter, is John."\r\n\r\n"He looks it. I\'d like to help that boy--"\r\n\r\n"All right--you can help him," Deborah said. "You\'ll find him quite a\r\ntonic."\r\n\r\n"A what?"\r\n\r\n"A tonic," she repeated. And with a sudden tightening of her wide and\r\nsensitive mouth, Deborah added slowly, "Because, though I\'ve known many\r\nhungry boys, Johnny Geer is the hungriest of them all--hungry to get on in\r\nlife, to grow and learn and get good things, get friends, love, happiness,\r\neverything!" As she spoke of this child in her family, over her strong\r\nquiet face there swept a fierce, intent expression which struck Roger\r\nrather cold. What a fight she was making, this daughter of his, against\r\nwhat overwhelming odds. But all he said to her was this:\r\n\r\n"Now let\'s look at something more cheerful, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Very well," she answered with a smile. "We\'ll go and see Isadore Freedom."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s he?"\r\n\r\n"Isadore Freedom," said Deborah, "is the beginning of something tremendous.\r\nHe came from Russian Poland--and the first American word he learned over\r\nthere was \'freedom.\' So in New York he changed his name to that--very\r\nsolemnly, by due process of law. It cost him seven dollars. He had nine\r\ndollars at the time. Isadore is a flame, a kind of a torch in the\r\nwilderness."\r\n\r\n"How does the flame earn his living?"\r\n\r\n"At first in a sweatshop," she replied. "But he came to my school five\r\nnights a week, and at ten o\'clock when school was out he went to a little\r\nbasement caf\xe9, where he sat at a corner table, drank one glass of Russian\r\ntea and studied till they closed at one. Then he went to his room, he told\r\nme, and used to read himself to sleep. He slept as a rule four hours. He\r\nsaid he felt he needed it. Now he\'s a librarian earning fifteen dollars a\r\nweek, and having all the money he needs he has put the thought of it out of\r\nhis life and is living for education--education in freedom. For Isadore has\r\nstudied his name until he thinks he knows what it means."\r\n\r\nThey found him in a small public library on an ill-smelling ghetto street.\r\nThe place had been packed with people, but the clock had just struck ten\r\nand the readers were leaving reluctantly, many with books under their arms.\r\nAt sight of Deborah and her father, Isadore leaped up from his desk and\r\ncame quickly to meet them with outstretched hands.\r\n\r\n"Oh, this is splendid! Good evening!" he cried. Hardly more than a boy,\r\nperhaps twenty-one, he was short of frame but large of limb. He had wide\r\nstooping shoulders and reddish hollows in his dark cheeks. Yet there was a\r\nspringiness in his step, vigor and warmth in the grip of his hand, in the\r\nvery curl of his thick black hair, in his voice, in his enormous smile.\r\n\r\n"Come," he said to Roger, when the greetings were over. "You shall see my\r\nlibrary, sir. But I want that you shall not see it alone. While you look\r\nyou must close for me your eyes and see other libraries, many, many, all\r\nover the world. You must see them in big cities and in very little towns\r\nto-night. You must see people, millions there, hungry, hungry people. Now I\r\nshall show you their food and their drink." As he spoke he was leading them\r\nproudly around. In the stacks along the walls he pointed out fiction,\r\npoetry, history, books of all the sciences.\r\n\r\n"They read all, all!" cried Isadore. "Look at this Darwin on my desk. In a\r\nyear so many have read this book it is a case for the board of health. And\r\nlook at this shelf of economics. I place it next to astronomy. And I say to\r\nthese people, \'Yes, read about jobs and your hours and wages. Yes, you must\r\nstrike, you must have better lives. But you must read also about the\r\nstars--and about the big spaces--silent--not one single little sound for\r\nmany, many million years. To be free you must grow as big as that--inside\r\nof your head, inside of your soul. It is not enough to be free of a czar, a\r\nkaiser or a sweatshop boss. What will you do when they are gone? My fine\r\npeople, how will you run the world? You are deaf and blind, you must be\r\nfree to open your own ears and eyes, to look into the books and see what is\r\nthere--great thoughts and feelings, great ideas! And when you have seen,\r\nthen you must think--you must think it all out every time! That is\r\nfreedom!\'" He stopped abruptly. Again on his dark features came a huge and\r\nwinning smile, and with an apologetic shrug, "But I talk too much of my\r\nbooks," he said. "Come. Shall we go to my caf\xe9?"\r\n\r\nOn a neighboring street, a few minutes later, down a flight of steep wooden\r\nstairs they descended into a little caf\xe9, shaped like a tunnel, the ceiling\r\nlow, the bare walls soiled by rubbing elbows, dirty hands, the air blue and\r\nhot with smoke. Young men and girls packed in at small tables bent over\r\ntall glasses of Russian tea, and gesturing with their cigarettes declaimed\r\nand argued excitedly. Quick joyous cries of greeting met Isadore from every\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"You see?" he said gaily. "This is my club. Here we are like a family." He\r\nordered tea of a waiter who seemed more like a bosom friend. And leaning\r\neagerly forward, he began to speak in glowing terms of the men and girls\r\nfrom sweatshops who spent their nights in these feasts of the soul,\r\ntalking, listening, grappling, "for the power to think with minds as clear\r\nas the sun when it rises," he ardently cried. "There is not a night in this\r\ncity, not one, when hundreds do not talk like this until the breaking of\r\nthe day! And then they sleep! A little joke! For at six o\'clock they must\r\nrise to their work! And that is a force," he added, "not only for those\r\npeople but a force for you and me. Do you see? When you feel tired, when\r\nall your hopes are sinking low, you think of those people and you say, \'I\r\nwill go to their places.\' And you go. You listen and you watch their faces,\r\nand such fire makes you burn! You go home, you are happy, you have a new\r\nlife!\r\n\r\n"And perhaps at last you will have a religion," he continued, in fervent\r\ntones. "You see, with us Jews--and with Christians, too--the old religion,\r\nit is gone. And in its place there is nothing strong. And so the young\r\npeople go all to pieces. They dance and they drink. If you go to those\r\ndance halls you say, \'They are crazy!\' For dancing alone is not enough. And\r\nyou say, \'These people must have a religion.\' You ask, \'Where can I find a\r\nnew God?\' And you reply, \'There is no God.\' And then you must be very sad.\r\nYou know how it is? You feel too free. And you feel scared and lonely. You\r\nlook up at the stars. There are millions. You are only a speck of dust--on\r\none.\r\n\r\n"But then you come to my library. And you see those hungry people--more\r\nhungry than men have ever been. And you see those books upon the shelves.\r\nAnd you know when they come together at last, when that power to think as\r\nclear as the sun comes into the souls of those people so hungry, then we\r\nshall have a new god for the world. For there is no end to what they shall\r\ndo," Isadore ended huskily.\r\n\r\nRoger felt a lump in his throat. He glanced into his daughter\'s eyes and\r\nsaw a suspicious brightness there. Isadore looked at her happily.\r\n\r\n"You see?" he said to Roger. "When she came here to-night she was tired,\r\nhalf sick. But now she is all filled with life!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater, on the street outside when Isadore had left them, Deborah turned to\r\nher father:\r\n\r\n"Before we go home, there\'s one place more."\r\n\r\nAnd they went to a building not far away, a new structure twelve floors\r\nhigh which rose out of the neighboring tenements. It had been built, she\r\ntold him, by a socialist daily paper. A dull night watchman half asleep\r\ntook them in the elevator up to the top floor of the building, where in a\r\nbustling, clanking loft the paper was just going to press. Deborah seemed\r\nto know one of the foremen. He smiled and nodded and led the way through\r\nthe noise and bustle to a large glass door at one end. This she opened and\r\nstepped out upon a fire escape so broad it was more like a balcony. And\r\nwith the noise of the presses subdued, from their high perch they looked\r\nsilently down.\r\n\r\nAll around them for miles, it seemed, stretched dark uneven fields of\r\nroofs, with the narrow East River winding its way through the midst of them\r\nto the harbor below, silvery, dim and cool and serene, opening to the\r\ndistant sea. From the bridges rearing high over the river, lights by\r\nthousands sparkled down. But directly below the spot where they stood was\r\nonly a dull hazy glow, rising out of dark tenement streets where dimly they\r\ncould just make out numberless moving shadowy forms, restless crowds too\r\nhot to sleep. The roofs were covered everywhere with men and women and\r\nchildren--families, families, families, all merged together in the dark.\r\nAnd from them rose into the night a ceaseless murmur of voices, laughing\r\nand joking, quarreling, loving and hating, demanding, complaining, and\r\nfighting and slaving and scheming for bread and the means of stark\r\nexistence. But among these struggling multitudes confusedly did Roger feel\r\nthe brighter presence here and there of more aspiring figures, small groups\r\nin glaring, stilling rooms down there beneath the murky dark, young people\r\nfiercely arguing, groping blindly for new gods. And all these voices, to\r\nhis ears, merged into one deep thrilling hum, these lights into one\r\nquivering glow, that went up toward the silent stars.\r\n\r\nAnd there came to him a feeling which he had often had before in many\r\ndifferent places--that he himself was a part of all this, the great, blind,\r\nwistful soul of mankind, which had been here before he was born and would\r\nbe here when he was dead--still groping, yearning, struggling upward, on\r\nand on--to something distant as the sun. And still would he be a part of it\r\nall, through the eager lives of his children. He turned and looked at\r\nDeborah and caught the light that was in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nRoger awoke the next morning feeling sore and weary, and later in his\r\noffice it was hard to keep his mind on his work. He thought of young\r\nIsadore Freedom. He was glad he had met that boy, and so he felt toward\r\nDeborah\'s whole terrific family. Confused and deafening as it was, there\r\nwas something inspiring in it all. But God save him from many such\r\nevenings! For half his life Roger had been a collector, not only of rings\r\nbut of people, too, of curious personalities. These human bits, these\r\nmemories, he had picked up as he lived along and had taken them with him\r\nand made them his own, had trimmed and polished every one until its rough\r\nunpleasant edges were all nicely smoothed away and it glittered and shone\r\nlike the gem that it was. For Roger was an idealist. And so he would have\r\nliked to do here. What a gem could be made of Isadore with a little careful\r\npolishing.\r\n\r\nBut Deborah\'s way was different. She stayed in life, lived in it close,\r\nwith its sharp edges bristling. In this there was something splendid, but\r\nthere was something tragic, too. It was all very well for that young Jew to\r\nburn himself up with his talk about freedom, his feverish searching for new\r\ngods. "In five years," Roger told himself, "Mr. Isadore Freedom will either\r\ntone down or go stark mad."\r\n\r\nBut quite probably he would tone down, for he was only a youngster, these\r\nwere Isadore\'s wild oats. But this was no longer Deborah\'s youth, she had\r\nbeen at this job ten years. And she hadn\'t gone mad, she had kept herself\r\nsane, she had many sides her father knew. He knew her in the mountains, or\r\nbustling about at home getting ready for Laura\'s wedding, or packing\r\nEdith\'s children off for their summer up at the farm. But did that make it\r\nany easier? No. To let yourself go was easy, but to keep hold of yourself\r\nwas hard. It meant wear and tear on a woman, this constant straining effort\r\nto keep her balance and see life whole.\r\n\r\n"Well, it will break her down, that\'s all, and I don\'t propose to allow\r\nit," he thought. "She\'s got to rest this summer and go easier next fall."\r\n\r\nBut how could he accomplish it? As he thought about her school, with its\r\nlong and generous arms reaching upon every side out into the tenements, the\r\nprospect was bewildering. He searched for something definite. What could he\r\ndo to prove to his daughter his real interest in her work? Presently he\r\nremembered Johnny Geer, the cripple boy whom he had liked, and at once he\r\nbegan to feel himself back again upon known ground. Instead of millions\r\nhere was one, one plucky lad who needed help. All right, by George, he\r\nshould have it! And Roger told his daughter he would be glad to pay the\r\nexpense of sending John away for the summer, and that in the autumn perhaps\r\nhe would take the lad into his office.\r\n\r\n"That\'s good of you, dearie," Deborah said. It was her only comment, but\r\nfrom the look she gave him Roger felt he was getting on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne evening not long afterwards, as they sat together at dinner, she rose\r\nunsteadily to her feet and said in a breathless voice,\r\n\r\n"It\'s rather close in here, isn\'t it? I think I\'ll go outside for a while."\r\nRoger jumped up.\r\n\r\n"Look here, my child, you\'re faint!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"No, no, it\'s nothing! Just the heat!" She swayed and reeled, pitched\r\nsuddenly forward. "Father! Quick!" And Roger caught her in his arms. He\r\ncalled to the maid, and with her help he carried Deborah up to her bed.\r\nThere she shuddered violently and beads of sweat broke out on her brow.\r\nHer breath came hard through chattering teeth.\r\n\r\n"It\'s so silly!" she said fiercely.\r\n\r\nBut as moments passed the chill grew worse. Her whole body seemed to be\r\nshaking, and as Roger was rubbing one of her arms she said something to him\r\nsharply, in a voice so thick he could not understand.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t feel anything."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"In my arm where you\'re rubbing--I can\'t feel your hand."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better have a doctor!"\r\n\r\n"Telephone Allan--Allan Baird. He knows about this," she muttered. And\r\nRoger ran down to the telephone. He was thoroughly frightened.\r\n\r\n"All right, Mr. Gale," came Baird\'s gruff bass, steady and slow, "I think I\r\nknow what the trouble is--and I wouldn\'t worry if I were you. I\'ll be there\r\nin about ten minutes." And it was hardly more than that when he came into\r\nDeborah\'s room. A moment he looked down at her.\r\n\r\n"Again?" he said. She glanced up at him and nodded, and smiled quickly\r\nthrough set teeth. Baird carefully examined her and then turned to Roger:\r\n"Now I guess you\'d better go out. You stay," he added to Sarah, the maid.\r\n"I may need you here awhile."\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later he came down to Roger\'s study.\r\n\r\n"She\'s safe enough now, I guess," he said. "I\'ve telephoned for a nurse for\r\nher, and she\'ll have to stay in bed a few days."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Acute indigestion."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say!" exclaimed Roger brightly, with a rush of deep relief.\r\nBaird gave him a dry quizzical smile.\r\n\r\n"People have died of that," he remarked, "in less than an hour. We caught\r\nyour daughter just in time. May I stay a few moments?"\r\n\r\n"Glad to have you! Smoke a cigar!"\r\n\r\n"Thanks--I will." As Baird reached out for the proffered cigar, Roger\r\nsuddenly noticed his hand. Long and muscular, finely shaped, it seemed to\r\nspeak of strength and skill and an immense vitality. Baird settled himself\r\nin his chair. "I want to talk about her," he said. "This little attack is\r\nonly a symptom--it comes from nerves. She\'s just about ready for a smash.\r\nShe\'s had slighter attacks of this kind before."\r\n\r\n"I never knew it," Roger said.\r\n\r\n"No--I don\'t suppose you did. Your daughter has a habit of keeping things\r\nlike this to herself. She came to me and I warned her, but she wanted to\r\nfinish out her year. Do you know anything about her school work?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was with her there this week."\r\n\r\n"What did she show you?" Baird inquired. Roger tried to tell him. "No,\r\nthat\'s not what I\'m after," he said. "That\'s just one of her usual\r\nevenings." For a moment he smoked in silence. "I\'m hunting now for\r\nsomething else, for some unusual nervous shock which she appears to me to\r\nhave had."\r\n\r\n"She has!" And Roger told him of her visit up to Sing Sing. Baird\'s lean\r\nmuscular right hand slowly tightened on his chair.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a tough family of hers," he remarked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Roger determinedly, "and she\'s got to give it up."\r\n\r\n"You mean she ought to. But she won\'t."\r\n\r\n"She\'s got to be made to," Roger growled. "This summer at least." Baird\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n"You forget her fresh air work," he replied. "She has three thousand\r\nchildren on her mind. The city will be like a furnace, of course, and the\r\nchildren must be sent to camps. If you don\'t see the necessity, go and talk\r\nto her, and then you will."\r\n\r\n"But you can forbid it, can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"No. Can you?"\r\n\r\n"I can try," snapped Roger.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s try what\'s possible," said Baird. "Let\'s try to keep her in bed\r\nthree days."\r\n\r\n"Sounds modest," Roger grunted. And a glimmer of amusement came into\r\nBaird\'s impassive eyes.\r\n\r\n"Try it," he drawled. "By to-morrow night she\'ll ask for her stenographer.\r\nShe\'ll make you think she is out of the woods. But she won\'t be, please\r\nremember that. A few years more," he added, "and she\'ll have used up her\r\nvitality. She\'ll be an old woman at thirty-five."\r\n\r\n"It\'s got to be stopped!" cried Roger.\r\n\r\n"But how?" came the low sharp retort. "You\'ve got to know her trouble\r\nfirst. And her trouble is deep, it\'s motherhood--on a scale which has never\r\nbeen tried before--for thousands of children, all of whom are living in a\r\nkind of hell. I know your daughter pretty well. Don\'t make the mistake of\r\nmixing her up with the old-fashioned teacher. It isn\'t what those children\r\nlearn, it\'s how they live that interests her, and how they are all growing\r\nup. I say she\'s a mother--in spirit--but her body has never borne a child.\r\nAnd that makes it worse--because it makes her more intense. It isn\'t\r\nnatural, you see."\r\n\r\nA little later he rose to go.\r\n\r\n"By the way," he said, at the door, "there\'s something I meant to tell her\r\nupstairs--about a poor devil she has on her mind. A chap named\r\nBerry--dying--lungs. She asked me to go and see him."\r\n\r\n"Yes?"\r\n\r\n"I found it was only a matter of days." The tragic pity in Baird\'s quiet\r\nvoice was so deep as barely to be heard.\r\n\r\n"So I shot him full of morphine. He won\'t wake up. Please tell her that."\r\n\r\nTall, ungainly, motionless, he loomed there in the doorway. With a little\r\nshrug and a smile he turned and went slowly out of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDeborah\'s recovery was rapid and determined. The next night she was sitting\r\nup and making light of her illness. On the third day she dismissed her\r\nnurse, and when her father came home from his office he found gathered\r\nabout her bed not only her stenographer but both her assistant principals.\r\nHe frowned severely and went to his room, and a few minutes later he heard\r\nthem leave. Presently she called to him, and he came to her bedside. She\r\nwas lying back on the pillow with rather a guilty expression.\r\n\r\n"Up to your old antics, eh?" he remarked.\r\n\r\n"Exactly. It couldn\'t be helped, you see. It\'s the last week of our school\r\nyear, and there are so many little things that have to be attended to. It\'s\r\nsimply now or never."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" was Roger\'s comment. "It\'s now or never with you," he thought. He\r\nwent down to his dinner, and when he came back he found her exhausted. In\r\nthe dim soft light of her room her face looked flushed and feverish, and\r\nvaguely he felt she was in a mood where she might listen to reason. He felt\r\nher hot dry hand on his. Her eyes were closed, she was smiling.\r\n\r\n"Tell me the news from the mountains," she said. And he gave her the gossip\r\nof the farm in a letter he had had from George. It told of a picnic supper,\r\nthe first one of the season. They had had it in the usual place, down by\r\nthe dam on the river, "with a bonfire--a perfect peach--down by the big\r\nyellow rock--the one you call the Elephant." As Roger read the letter he\r\ncould feel his daughter listening, vividly picturing to herself the great\r\ndark boulders by the creek, the shadowy firs, the stars above and the cool\r\nfresh tang of the mountain night.\r\n\r\n"After this little sickness of yours--and that harum scarum wedding," he\r\nsaid, "I feel we\'re both entitled to a good long rest in mountain air."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have it, too," she murmured.\r\n\r\n"With Edith\'s little youngsters. They\'re all the medicine you need." He\r\npaused for a moment, hesitating. But it was now or never. "The only trouble\r\nwith you," he said, "is that you\'ve let yourself be caught by the same\r\ndisease which has its grip upon this whole infernal town. You\'re like\r\neveryone else, you\'re tackling about forty times what you can do. You\'re\r\nactually trying not only to teach but to bring \'em all up as your own,\r\nthree thousand tenement children. And this is where it gets you."\r\n\r\nAgain he halted, frowning. What next?\r\n\r\n"Go on, dear, please," said Deborah, in demure and even tones. "This is\r\nvery interesting."\r\n\r\n"Now then," he continued, "in this matter of your school. I wouldn\'t ask\r\nyou to give it up, I\'ve already seen too much of it. But so long as you\'ve\r\ngot it nicely started, why not give somebody else a chance? One of those\r\nassistants of yours, for example--capable young women, both. You could\r\nstand right behind \'em with help and advice--"\r\n\r\n"Not yet," was Deborah\'s soft reply. She had turned her head on her pillow\r\nand was looking at him affectionately. "Why not?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Because it\'s not nicely started at all. There\'s nothing brilliant about\r\nme, dear--I\'m a plodder, feeling my way along. And what I have done in the\r\nlast ten years is just coming to a stage at last where I can really see a\r\nchance to make it count for something. When I feel I\'ve done that, say in\r\nfive years more--"\r\n\r\n"Those five years," said her father, "may cost you a very heavy price." As\r\nDeborah faced his troubled regard, her own grew quickly serious.\r\n\r\n"I\'d be willing to pay the price," she replied.\r\n\r\n"But why?" he asked with impatience. "Why pay when you don\'t have to? Why\r\nnot by taking one year off get strength for twenty years\' work later on?\r\nYou\'d be a different woman!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think I should be. I\'d never be the same again. You don\'t quite\r\nunderstand, you see. This work of mine with children--well, it\'s like\r\nEdith\'s having a baby. You have to do it while you\'re young."\r\n\r\n"That works both ways," her father growled.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" He hesitated:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want any children of your own?"\r\n\r\nAgain she turned her eyes toward his, then closed them and lay perfectly\r\nstill. "Now I\'ve done it," he thought anxiously. She reached over and took\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s talk of our summer\'s vacation," she said.\r\n\r\nA little while later she fell asleep.\r\n\r\nDownstairs he soon grew restless and after a time he went out for a walk.\r\nBut he felt tired and oppressed, and as he had often done of late he\r\nentered a little "movie" nearby, where gradually the pictures, continually\r\nflashing out of the dark, drove the worries from his mind. For a half an\r\nhour they held his gaze. Then he fell into a doze. He was roused by a roar\r\nof laughter, and straightening up in his seat with a jerk he looked angrily\r\naround. Something broadly comic had been flashed upon the screen; and men\r\nand women and children, Italians, Jews and Irish, jammed in close about\r\nhim, a dirty and perspiring mass, had burst into a terrific guffaw. Now\r\nthey were suddenly tense again and watching the screen in absorbed\r\nsuspense, while the crude passions within themselves were played upon in\r\nthe glamorous dark. And Roger scanned their faces--one moment smiling, all\r\ntogether, as though some god had pulled a string; then mawkish,\r\nsentimental, soft; then suddenly scowling, twitching, with long rows of\r\nanimal eyes. But eager--eager all the time! Hungry people--yes, indeed!\r\nHungry for all the good things in the town, and for as many bad things,\r\ntoo! On one who tried to feed this mob there was no end to their demands!\r\nWhat was one woman\'s life to them? Deborah\'s big family!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEdith came to the house one afternoon, and she was in Deborah\'s room when\r\nher father returned from his office. Her convalescence over at last, she\r\nwas leaving for the mountains.\r\n\r\n"Do learn your lesson, Deborah dear," she urged upon her sister. "Let Sarah\r\npack your trunk at once and come up with me on Saturday night."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t get off for two weeks yet."\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t you?" Edith demanded. And when Deborah spoke of fresh air camps\r\nand baby farms and other work, Edith\'s impatience only grew. "You\'ll have\r\nto leave it to somebody else! You\'re simply in no condition!" she cried.\r\n\r\n"Impossible," said Deborah. Edith gave a quick sigh of exasperation.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it enough," she asked, "to have worked your nerves to a frazzle\r\nalready? Why can\'t you be sensible? You\'ve got to think of yourself a\r\nlittle!"\r\n\r\n"You\'d like me to marry, wouldn\'t you, dear?" her sister put in wearily.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I should, while there is still time! Just now you look far from it!\r\nIt\'s exactly as Allan was saying! If you keep on as you\'re going you\'ll be\r\nan old woman at thirty-five!"\r\n\r\n"Thank you!" said Deborah sharply. Two spots of color leaped in her checks.\r\n"You\'d better leave me, Edith! I\'ll come up to the mountains as soon as I\r\ncan! And I\'ll try not to look any more like a hag than I have to!\r\nGood-night!"\r\n\r\nRoger followed Edith out of the room.\r\n\r\n"That last shot of mine struck home," she declared to him in triumph.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have done it," her father said. "I gave you that remark of\r\nBaird\'s in strict confidence, Edith--"\r\n\r\n"Now father," was her good-humored retort, "suppose you leave this matter\r\nto me. I know just what I\'m doing."\r\n\r\n"Well," he reflected uneasily, after she had left him, "here\'s more trouble\r\nin the family. If Edith isn\'t careful she\'ll make a fine mess of this whole\r\naffair."\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he went up to Deborah\'s room, but through the open doorway he\r\ncaught a glimpse of his daughter which made him instinctively draw back.\r\nSitting bolt upright in her bed, sternly she was eyeing herself in a small\r\nmirror in her hand. Her father chuckled noiselessly. A moment later, when\r\nhe went in, the glass had disappeared from view. Soon afterwards Baird\r\nhimself arrived, and as they heard him coming upstairs Roger saw his\r\ndaughter frown, but she continued talking.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Allan," she said with indifference. "I\'m feeling much better this\r\nevening."\r\n\r\n"Are you? Good," he answered, and he started to pull up an easy chair. "I\r\nwas hoping I could stay awhile--I\'ve been having one of those long mean\r\ndays--"\r\n\r\n"I\'d a little rather you wouldn\'t," Deborah put in softly. Allan turned to\r\nher in surprise. "I didn\'t sleep last night," she murmured, "and I feel so\r\ndrowsy." There was a little silence. "And I really don\'t think there\'s any\r\nneed of your dropping in to-morrow," she added. "I\'m so much\r\nbetter--honestly."\r\n\r\nBaird looked at her a moment.\r\n\r\n"Right--O," he answered slowly. "I\'ll call up to-morrow night."\r\n\r\nRoger followed him downstairs.\r\n\r\n"Come into my den and smoke a cigar!" he proposed in hearty ringing tones.\r\nAllan thanked him and came in, but the puzzled expression was still on his\r\nface, and through the first moments of their talk he was very\r\nabsent-minded. Roger\'s feeling of guilt increased, and he cursed himself\r\nfor a meddlesome fool.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Baird," he blurted out, "there\'s something I think you ought to\r\nknow." Allan slightly turned his head, and Roger reddened a little. "The\r\nworst thing about living in a house chock full of meddling women is that\r\nyou get to be one yourself," he growled. "And the fact is--" he cleared his\r\nthroat--"I\'ve put my foot in it, Baird," he said. "I was fool enough the\r\nother day to quote you to Edith."\r\n\r\n"To what effect?"\r\n\r\n"That if Deborah keeps on like this she\'ll be an old woman at thirty-five."\r\n\r\nAllan sat up in his chair:\r\n\r\n"Was Edith here this afternoon?"\r\n\r\n"She was," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"Say no more."\r\n\r\nBaird had a wide, likable, generous mouth which wrinkled easily into a\r\nsmile. He leaned back now and enjoyed himself. He puffed a little cloud of\r\nsmoke, looked over at Roger and chuckled aloud. And Roger chuckled with\r\nrelief. "What a decent chap he is," he thought.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, of course," he said to Baird. "I thought of trying to\r\nexplain--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t," said Allan. "Leave it alone. It won\'t do Deborah any harm--may\r\neven do her a little good. After all, I\'m her physician--"\r\n\r\n"Are you?" Roger asked with a twinkle. "I thought upstairs you were\r\ndismissed."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I\'m not," was the calm reply. And the two men went on smoking.\r\nRoger\'s liking for Baird was growing fast. They had had several little\r\ntalks during Deborah\'s illness, and Roger was learning more of the man.\r\nRaised on a big cattle ranch that his father had owned in New Mexico,\r\nriding broncos on the plains had given him his abounding health of body,\r\nnerve and spirit, his steadiness and sanity in all this feverish city life.\r\n\r\n"Are you riding these days?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"No," said Roger, "the park is too hot--and they don\'t sprinkle the path as\r\nthey should. I\'ve had my cob sent up to the mountains. By the way," he\r\nadded cordially, "you must come up there and ride with me."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, I\'d like to," Allan said, and with a little inner smile he added\r\ndryly to himself, "He\'s getting ready to meddle again." But whatever\r\namusement Baird had in this thought was concealed behind his sober gray\r\neyes. Soon after that he took his leave.\r\n\r\n"Now then," Roger reflected, with a little glow of expectancy, "if Edith\r\nwill only leave me alone, she may find I\'m smarter then she thinks!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne evening in the following week, after Edith had left town, Roger had\r\nBruce to dine at his club, a pleasant old building on Madison Square, where\r\ncomfortably all by themselves they could discuss Baird\'s chances.\r\n\r\n"A. Baird and I have been chums," said Bruce, "ever since we were in\r\ncollege. Take it from me I know his brand. And he isn\'t the kind to be\r\npushed."\r\n\r\n"Who wants to push him?" Roger demanded, with a sudden guilty twinge.\r\n\r\n"Edith does," Bruce answered. "And I tell you that won\'t do with A. Baird.\r\nHe has his mind set on Deborah sure. He\'s been setting it harder and harder\r\nfor months--and he knows it--and so does she. But they\'re both the kind of\r\npeople who don\'t like interference, they\'ve got to get to it by themselves.\r\nEdith must keep out of the way. She mustn\'t take it on herself to ask him\r\nup to the mountains." Roger gave a little start. "If she does, there\'ll be\r\ntrouble with Deborah."\r\n\r\nRoger smoked for a moment in silence and then sagely nodded his head.\r\n\r\n"That\'s so," he murmured thoughtfully. "Yes, my boy, I guess you\'re right."\r\n\r\nBruce lifted his mint julep:\r\n\r\n"God, but it\'s hot in here to-night. How about taking a spin up the river?"\r\n\r\n"Delighted," replied his father-in-law.\r\n\r\nAnd a half hour later in Bruce\'s new car, which was the pride and joy of\r\nhis life, they were far up the river. On a long level stretch of road Bruce\r\n"let her out to show what she could do." And Roger with his heart in his\r\nmouth and his eye upon the speedometer, saw it creep to sixty-three.\r\n\r\n"Almost as good as a horse," remarked Bruce, when the car had slowed a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n"Almost," said Roger, "but not quite. It\'s--well, it\'s dissipation."\r\n\r\n"And a horse?"\r\n\r\n"Is life," was the grave reply. "You\'ll have a crash some day, my boy, if\r\nyou go on at your present speed. It gets me worried sometimes. You see\r\nyou\'re a family man."\r\n\r\n"I am and I\'m glad of it. Edith and the kiddies suit me right down to the\r\nground. I\'m crazy about \'em--you know that. But a chap with a job like\r\nmine," Bruce continued pleadingly, as he drove his car rushing around a\r\ncurve, "needs a little dissipation, too. I can\'t tell you what it means to\r\nme, when I\'m kept late at the office, to have this car for the run up home.\r\nLower Broadway\'s empty then, and I know the cops. I swing around through\r\nWashington Square, and the Avenue looks clear for miles, nothing but two\r\nlong rows of lights to the big hump at Murray Hill. It\'s the time between\r\ncrowds--say about ten. And I know the cops."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," said Roger. "No one was more delighted than I when you\r\ngot this car. You deserve it. It\'s the _work_ that I was speaking of.\r\nYou\'ve got it going at such a speed--"\r\n\r\n"Only way on earth to get on--to get what I want for my family--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I know," muttered Roger vaguely. Bruce began talking of his work\r\nfor the steel construction concern downtown.\r\n\r\n"Take it from me," he declared at the end, "this town has only just begun!"\r\n\r\n"Has, eh," Roger grunted. "Aren\'t the buildings high enough?"\r\n\r\n"My God, I wish they were twenty times higher," Bruce rejoined\r\ngood-humoredly. "But they won\'t be--we\'ve stopped going up. We\'ve done\r\npretty well in the air, and now we\'re going underground. And when we get\r\nthrough, this old rock of Manhattan will be such a network of tunnels\r\nthere\'ll be a hole waiting at every corner to take you wherever you want to\r\ngo. Speed? We don\'t even know what it means!"\r\n\r\nAnd again Bruce "let her out" a bit. It was _quite_ a bit. Roger grabbed\r\nhis hat with one hand and the side of the car with the other.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll look back on a mile a minute," said Bruce, "as we look back on\r\nstage coach days! And in the rush hour there\'ll be a rush that\'ll make you\r\nthink of pneumatic tubes! Not a sound nor a quiver--_just pure speed!_\r\nShooting people home at night at a couple of hundred miles an hour! The\r\ncity will be as big as that! And there won\'t be any accidents and there\r\nwon\'t be any smoke. Instead of coal they\'ll use the sun! And, my God, man,\r\nthe boulevards--and parks and places for the kids! The way they\'ll use the\r\nRiver--and the ocean and the Sound! The Catskills will be Central Park!\r\nSounds funny, don\'t it--but it\'s true. I\'ve studied it out from A to Z.\r\nThis town is choking itself to death simply because we\'re so damn slow! We\r\ndon\'t know how to spread ourselves! All this city needs is speed!"\r\n\r\n"Bruce," said Roger anxiously, "just go a bit easy on that gas. The fact\r\nis, it was a great mistake for me to eat those crabs to-night."\r\n\r\nBruce slowed down compassionately, and soon they turned and started home.\r\nAnd as they drew near the glow of the town, other streets and boulevards\r\npoured more motors into the line, until at last they were rushing along\r\namid a perfect bedlam made up of honks and shrieks of horns. The air grew\r\nhot and acrid, and looking back through the bluish haze of smoke and dust\r\nbehind him Roger could see hundreds of huge angry motor eyes. Crowding and\r\njamming closer, pell mell, at a pace which barely slackened, they sped on,\r\na wild uproarious crew, and swept into the city.\r\n\r\nRoger barely slept that night. He felt the city clamoring down into his\r\nvery soul. "Speed!" he muttered viciously. "Speed--speed! We need more\r\nspeed!" The words beat in like a savage refrain. At last with a sigh of\r\nimpatience he got up in his nightshirt and walked about. It was good to\r\nfeel his way in the dark in this cool silent house which he knew so well.\r\nSoon his nerves felt quieter. He went back to his bed and lay there inert.\r\nHow good it would be to get up to the farm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next Saturday evening, with Deborah, he started for the mountains. And\r\nBruce came down to see them off.\r\n\r\n"Remember, son," said Roger, as the two walked on the platform. "Come up\r\nthis year for a month, my boy. You need it." The train was about to start.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll be all right," was the answer. "My friend the Judge, who has hay\r\nfever, tells me he has found a cure."\r\n\r\n"Damn his cure! You come to us!"\r\n\r\n"Hold on a minute, live and learn. The Judge is quite excited about it.\r\nYou drink little bugs, he says, a billion after every meal. They come in\r\ntall blue bottles. We\'re going to dine together next week and drink \'em\r\ntill we\'re all lit up. Oh, we\'re going to have a hell of a time. _His_ wife\r\nleft town on Tuesday."\r\n\r\n"Bruce," said Roger sternly, as the train began to move, "leave bugs alone\r\nand come up and breathe! And quit smoking so many cigarettes!" He stepped\r\non the car.\r\n\r\n"Remember, son, a solid month!" Bruce nodded as the train moved out.\r\n\r\n"Good luck--good-bye--fine summer--my love to the wife and the kiddies--"\r\nand Bruce\'s dark, tense, smiling face was left behind. Roger went back into\r\nthe smoker.\r\n\r\n"Now for the mountains," he thought. "Thank God!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nA few hours later Roger awakened. His lower berth was still pitch dark. The\r\ntrain had stopped, and he had been roused by a voice outside his window.\r\nRough and slow and nasal, the leisurely drawl of a mountaineer, it came\r\nlike balm to Roger\'s ears. He raised the curtain and looked out. A train\r\nhand with a lantern was listening to a dairy man, a tall young giant in top\r\nboots. High overhead loomed a shadowy mountain and over its rim came the\r\nglow of the dawn. With a violent lurch the train moved on. And Roger, lying\r\nback on his pillow, looked up at the misty mountain sides all mottled in\r\nthe strange blue light with patches of firs and birches and pines. In the\r\nnarrow valley up which the train was thundering, were small herds of\r\ngrazing cattle, a lonely farmhouse here and there. From one a light was\r\ntwinkling. And the city with its heat and noise, its nervous throb, its\r\nbedlam nights, all dropped like a fever from his soul.\r\n\r\nNow, close by the railroad track, through a shallow rocky gorge a small\r\nriver roared and foamed. Its cool breath came up to his nostrils and\r\ngratefully he breathed it in. For this was the Gale River, named after one\r\nof his forefathers, and in his mind\'s eye he followed the stream back up\r\nits course to the little station where he and Deborah were to get off.\r\nThere the narrowing river bed turned and wound up through a cleft in the\r\nhills to the homestead several miles away. On the dark forest road beside\r\nit he pictured George, his grandson, at this moment driving down to meet\r\nthem in a mountain wagon with one of the two hired men, a lantern swinging\r\nunder the wheels. What an adventure for young George.\r\n\r\nPresently he heard Deborah stirring in the berth next to his own.\r\n\r\nAt the station George was there, and from a thermos bottle which Edith had\r\nfilled the night before he poured coffee piping hot, which steamed in the\r\nkeen, frosty air.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how good!" cried Deborah. "How thoughtful of your mother, George. How\r\nis she, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s all right, Aunt Deborah." His blunt freckled features flushed\r\nfrom his drive, George stood beaming on them both. He appeared, if\r\nanything, tougher and scrawnier than before. "Everything\'s all right," he\r\nsaid. "There ain\'t a sick animal on the whole farm."\r\n\r\nAs Roger sipped his coffee he was having a look at the horses. One of them\r\nwas William, his cob.\r\n\r\n"Do you see it?" inquired his grandson.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"The boil," George answered proudly, "on William\'s rump. There it is--on\r\nthe nigh side. Gee, but you ought to have seen it last week. It was a whale\r\nof a boil," said George, "but we poulticed him, me and Dave did--and now\r\nthe swelling\'s nearly gone. You can ride him to-morrow if you like."\r\n\r\nLuxuriously Roger lit a cigar and climbed to the front seat with George. Up\r\nthe steep and crooked road the stout horses tugged their way, and the wagon\r\ncreaked, and the Gale River, here only a brook, came gurgling, dashing to\r\nmeet them--down from the mountains, from the farm, from Roger\'s youth to\r\nwelcome him home. And the sun was flashing through the pines. As they drew\r\nnear the farmhouse through a grove of sugar maples, he heard shrill cries\r\nof, "There they come!" And he glimpsed the flying figures of George\'s\r\nbrothers, Bob and Tad. George whipped up the horses, the wagon gained upon\r\nthe boys and reached the house but a few rods behind the little runners.\r\nEdith was waiting by the door, fresh and smiling, blooming with health.\r\nHow well this suited her, Roger thought. Amid a gay chorus of greetings he\r\nclimbed down heavily out of the wagon, looked about him and drew a deep\r\nbreath. The long lazy days on the farm had begun.\r\n\r\nFrom the mountain side the farm looked down on a wide sweeping valley of\r\nwoods and fields. The old house straggled along the road, with addition\r\nafter addition built on through generations by many men and women. Here lay\r\nthe history, unread, of the family of Roger Gale. Inside there were steps\r\nup and down from one part to another, queer crooks in narrow passageways.\r\nThe lower end was attached to the woodshed, and the woodshed to the barn.\r\nAbove the house a pasture dotted with gray boulders extended up to a wood\r\nof firs, and out of this wood the small river which bore the name of the\r\nfamily came rushing down the field in a gully, went under the road, swept\r\naround to the right and along the edge of a birch copse just below the\r\nhouse. The little stream grew quieter there and widened into a mill pond.\r\nAt the lower end was a broken dam and beside it a dismantled mill. Here was\r\npeace for Roger\'s soul. The next day at dawn he awakened, and through the\r\nwindow close by his bed he saw no tall confining walls; his eye was carried\r\nas on wings out over a billowy blanket of mist, soft and white and cool and\r\nstill, reaching over the valley. From underneath to his sensitive ears came\r\nthe numberless voices of the awakening sleepers there, cheeps and tremulous\r\nwarbles from the birch copse just below, cocks crowing in the valley, and\r\nducks and geese, dogs, sheep and cattle faintly heard from distant farms.\r\nJust so it had been when he was a boy. How unchanged and yet how new were\r\nthese fresh hungry cries of life. From the other end of the house he heard\r\nEdith\'s tiny son lustily demanding his breakfast, as other wee boys before\r\nhim had done for over a hundred years, as other babies still unborn would\r\ndo in the many years to come. Soon the cry of the child was hushed. Quiet\r\nfell upon the house. And Roger sank again into deep happy slumber.\r\n\r\nHere was nothing new and disturbing. Edith\'s children? Yes, they were new,\r\nbut they were not disturbing. Their growth each summer was a joy, a renewal\r\nof life in the battered old house. Here was no huge tenement family\r\ncrowding in with dirty faces, clamorous demands for aid, but only five\r\ndelightful youngsters, clean and fresh, of his own blood. He loved the\r\nsmall excitements, the plans and plots and discoveries, the many adventures\r\nthat filled their days. He spent hours with their mother, listening while\r\nshe talked of them. Edith did so love this place and she ran the house so\r\nbeautifully. It was so cool and fragrant, so clean and so old-fashioned.\r\n\r\nDeborah, too, came under the spell. She grew as lazy as a cat and day by\r\nday renewed her strength from the hills and from Edith\'s little brood.\r\nRoger had feared trouble there, for he knew how Edith disapproved of her\r\nsister\'s new ideas. But although much with the children, Deborah apparently\r\nhad no new ideas at all. She seemed to be only listening. One balmy day at\r\nsunset, Roger saw her lying on the grass with George sprawled by her side.\r\nHer head upon one arm, she appeared to be watching the cattle in the\r\nsloping pasture above. Slowly, as though each one of them was drawn by\r\nmysterious unseen chains, they were drifting down toward the barn where it\r\nwas almost milking time. George was talking earnestly. She threw a glance\r\nat him from time to time, and Roger could see how intent were her eyes.\r\nYes, Deborah knew how to study a boy.\r\n\r\nOnly once during the summer did she talk about her work. On a walk with her\r\nfather one day she took him into a small forlorn building, a mere cabin of\r\none room. The white paint had long been worn away, the windows were all\r\nbroken, half the old shingles had dropped from the roof and on the\r\nflagpole was no flag. It was the district schoolhouse where for nearly half\r\nhis life Deborah\'s grandfather had taught a score of pupils. Inside were a\r\nblackboard, a rusty stove, a teacher\'s desk and a dozen forms, grown mouldy\r\nand worm-eaten now. A torn and faded picture of Lincoln was upon one wall,\r\nhalf hidden by a spider\'s web and by a few old dangling rags which once had\r\nbeen red, white and blue. Below, still clinging to the wall, was an old\r\nscrap of paper, on which in a large rugged hand there had been written long\r\nago a speech, but it had been worn away until but three words were\r\nlegible--"conceived and dedicated--"\r\n\r\n"Tell me about your school," she said. "All you can remember." Seated at\r\nher grandfather\'s desk she asked Roger many questions. And his\r\nrecollections, at first dim and hazy, began to clear a little.\r\n\r\n"By George!" he exclaimed. "Here are my initials!"\r\n\r\nHe stooped over one of the benches.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dearie! Where?" He pointed them out, and then while he sat on the rude\r\nold bench for some time more she questioned him.\r\n\r\n"But your school was not all here," she said musingly at last, "it was up\r\non the farm, besides, where you learned to plough and sow and reap and take\r\ncare of the animals in the barn, and mend things that were broken, and--oh,\r\nturn your hand to anything. But millions of children nowadays are growing\r\nup in cities, you see."\r\n\r\nHalf frowning and half smiling she began to talk of her work in town. "What\r\nis there about her," Roger asked, "that reminds me so of my mother?" His\r\nmind strayed back into the past while the low quiet voice of his daughter\r\nwent on, and a wistful expression crept over his face. What would she do\r\nwith the family name? What life would she lead in those many years?...\r\n"What a mother she would make." The words rose from within him, but in a\r\nvoice which was not his own. It was Deborah\'s grandmother speaking, so\r\nclearly and distinctly that he gave a start almost of alarm.\r\n\r\n"And if you don\'t believe they\'ll do it," Deborah was saying, "you don\'t\r\nknow what\'s in children. Only we\'ve got to help bring it out." What had she\r\nbeen talking about? He remembered the words "a new nation"--no more. "We\'ve\r\ngot to grope around in the dark and hunt for new ways and learn as we go.\r\nAnd when you\'ve once got into the work and really felt the thrill of it\r\nall--well, then it seems rather foolish and small to bother about your own\r\nlittle life."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRoger spent much of his time alone. He took long rides on William along\r\ncrooked, hilly roads. As the afternoon drew to its end, the shadows would\r\ncreep up the mountain sides to their summits where glowed the last rays of\r\nthe sun, painting the slate and granite crags in lovely pink and purple\r\nhues. And sometimes mighty banks of clouds would rear themselves high\r\noverhead, gigantic mountains of the air with billowy, misty caverns, cliffs\r\nand jagged peaks, all shifting there before his eyes. And he would think of\r\nJudith his wife. And the old haunting certainty, that her soul had died\r\nwith her body, was gone. There came to him the feeling that he and his wife\r\nwould meet again. Why did this hope come back to him? Was it all from the\r\nglory of the sun? Or was it from the presence, silent and invisible, of\r\nthose many other mortals, folk of his own flesh and blood, who at their\r\ndeaths had gone to their graves to put on immortality? Or was this\r\ndeepening faith in Roger simply a sign of his growing old age?\r\n\r\nHe frowned at the thought and shook it off, and again stared up at the\r\nlight on the hills. "You will live on in our children\'s lives." Was there\r\nno other immortality?\r\n\r\nHe often thought of his boyhood here. On a ride one day he stopped for a\r\ndrink at a spring in a grove of maples surrounding a desolate farmhouse not\r\nmore than a mile away from his own. And through the trees as he turned to\r\ngo he saw the stark figure of a woman, poorly clad and gaunt and gray. She\r\nstood motionless watching him with a look of sullen bitterness. She was the\r\nlast of "the Elkinses," a mountain family run to seed. As he rode away he\r\nsaw in the field a boy with a pitchfork in his hands, a meager ragged\r\nlittle chap. He was staring into the valley at a wriggling, blue smoke\r\nserpent made by the night express to New York. And something leaped in\r\nRoger, for he had once felt just like that! But the woman\'s harsh voice cut\r\nin on his dream, as she shouted to her son below, "Hey! Why the hell you\r\nstandin\' thar?" And the boy with a jump of alarm turned back quickly to his\r\nwork. At home a few days later, George with a mysterious air took his\r\ngrandfather into the barn, and after a pledge of secrecy he said in swift\r\nand thrilling tones, "You know young Bill Elkins? Yes, you do--the boy up\r\non the Elkins place who lives alone with his mother. Well, look here!"\r\nGeorge swallowed hard. "Bill has cleared out--he\'s run away! I was up at\r\nfive this morning and he came hiking down the road! He had a bundle on his\r\nback and he told me he was off for good! And was he scared? You bet he was\r\nscared! And I told him so and it made him mad! \'Aw, you\'re scared!\' I said.\r\n\'I ain\'t neither!\' he said. He could barely talk, but the kid had his\r\nnerve! \'Where you going?\' I asked. \'To New York,\' he said. \'Aw, what do you\r\nknow of New York?\' I said. And then, by golly, he busted right down. \'Gee!\'\r\nhe said, \'Gee! Can\'t you lemme alone?\' And then he beat it down the road!\r\nYou could hear the kid breathe, he was hustling so! He\'s way off now, he\'s\r\ncaught the train! He wants to be a cabin boy on a big ocean liner!" For a\r\nmoment there was silence. "Well?" the boy demanded, "What do you think of\r\nhis chances?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Roger huskily. He felt a tightening at his throat.\r\nAbruptly he turned to his grandson.\r\n\r\n"George," he asked, "what do _you_ want to be?" The boy flushed under his\r\nfreckles.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know as I know. I\'m thinking," he answered very slowly.\r\n\r\n"Talk it over with your mother, son."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," came the prompt reply. "But he won\'t," reflected Roger.\r\n\r\n"Or if you ever feel you want to, have a good long talk with me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," was the answer. Roger stood there waiting, then turned and\r\nwalked slowly out of the barn. How these children grew up inside of\r\nthemselves. Had boys always grown like that? Well, perhaps, but how strange\r\nit was. Always new lives, lives of their own, the old families scattering\r\nover the land. So the great life of the nation swept on. He kept noticing\r\nhere deserted farms, and one afternoon in the deepening dusk he rode by a\r\ngraveyard high up on a bare hillside. A horse and buggy were outside, and\r\nwithin he spied a lean young woman neatly dressed in a plain dark suit.\r\nWith a lawn mower brought from home she was cutting the grass on her family\r\nlot. And she seemed to fit into the landscape. New England had grown very\r\nold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLate one night toward the end of July, there came a loud honk from down the\r\nhill, then another and another. And as George in his pajamas came rushing\r\nfrom his bedroom shouting radiantly, "Gee! It\'s dad!"--they heard the car\r\nthundering outside. Bruce had left New York at dawn and had made the run in\r\na single day, three hundred and eleven miles. He was gray with dust all\r\nover and he was worn and hollow eyed, but his dark visage wore a look of\r\nsolid satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"I needed the trip to shake me down," he pleaded, when Edith scolded him\r\nwell for this terrific manner of starting his vacation. "I had to have it\r\nto cut me off from the job I left behind me. Now watch me settle down on\r\nthis farm."\r\n\r\nBut it appeared he could not settle down. For the first few days, in his\r\nmotor, he was busy exploring the mountains. "We\'ll make \'em look foolish.\r\nEh, son?" he said. And with George, who mutely adored him, he ran all about\r\nthem in a day. Genially he gave everyone rides. When he\'d finished with the\r\nfamily, he took Dave Royce the farmer and his wife and children, and even\r\nboth the hired men, for Bruce was an hospitable soul. But more than anyone\r\nelse he took George. They spent hours working on the car, and at times when\r\nthey came into the house begreased and blackened from their work, Edith\r\nreproved them like bad boys--but Deborah smiled contentedly.\r\n\r\nBut at the end of another week Bruce grew plainly restless, and despite his\r\nwife\'s remonstrances made ready to return to town. When she spoke of his\r\nhay fever he bragged to her complacently of his newly discovered cure.\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother your little blue bugs!" she cried.\r\n\r\n"The bugs aren\'t blue," he explained to her, in a mild and patient voice\r\nthat drove Edith nearly wild. "They\'re so little they have no color at all.\r\nPoor friendly little devils--"\r\n\r\n"Bruce!" his wife exploded.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve been almighty good to me. You ought to have heard my friend the\r\nJudge, the last night I was with him. He patted his bottle and said to me,\r\n\'Bruce, my boy, with all these simple animals right here as our companions\r\nwhy be a damn fool and run off to the cows?\' And there\'s a good deal in\r\nwhat he says. You ought to be mighty thankful, too, that my summer\r\npleasures are so mild. If you could see what some chaps do--"\r\n\r\nAnd Bruce started back for the city. George rode with him the first few\r\nmiles, then left him and came trudging home. His spirits were exceedingly\r\nlow.\r\n\r\nAs August drew toward a close, Deborah, too, showed signs of unrest. With\r\never growing frequency Roger felt her eagerness to return to her work in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n"You\'re as bad as Bruce," he growled at her. "You don\'t have to be back,"\r\nhe argued. "School doesn\'t begin for nearly three weeks."\r\n\r\n"There\'s the suffrage campaign," she answered. He gave her a look of\r\nexasperation.\r\n\r\n"Now what the devil has suffrage to do with your schools?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"When the women get the vote, we\'ll spend more money on the children."\r\n\r\n"Suppose the money isn\'t there," was Roger\'s grim rejoinder.\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll act like old-fashioned wives, I suppose," his daughter answered\r\ncheerfully, "and keep nagging till it is there. We\'ll keep up such a\r\nnagging," she added, in sweet even tones, "that you\'ll get the money by\r\nhook or crook, to save yourselves from going insane."\r\n\r\nAfter this he caught her reading in the New York papers the list of\r\ncampaign meetings each night, meetings in hot stifling halls or out upon\r\ndeafening corners. And as she read there came over her face a look like\r\nthat of a man who has given up tobacco and suddenly sniffs it among his\r\nfriends. She went down the last night of August.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRoger stayed on for another two weeks, on into the best time of the year.\r\nFor now came the nights of the first snapping frosts when the dome of the\r\nheavens was steely blue, and clear sparkling mornings, the woods aflame\r\nwith scarlet and gold. And across the small field below the house, at\r\nsunset Roger would go down to the copse of birches there and find it filled\r\nwith glints of light that took his glance far in among the slender, creamy\r\nstems of the trees, all slowly swaying to and fro, the leafage rich with\r\nautumn hues, warm orange, yellow and pale green. Lovely and silent and\r\nserene. So it had been when he was a boy and so it would be when he was\r\ndead. Countless trees had been cut down but others had risen in their\r\nstead. Now and then he could hear a bird warbling.\r\n\r\nLong ago this spot had been his mother\'s favorite refuge from her busy day\r\nin the house. She had almost always come alone, but sometimes Roger\r\nstealing down would watch her sitting motionless and staring in among the\r\ntrees. Years later in his reading he had come upon the phrase, "sacred\r\ngrove," and at once he had thought of the birches. And sitting here where\r\nshe had been, he felt again that boundless faith in life resplendent,\r\nconquering death, and serenely sweeping him on--into what he did not fear.\r\nFor this had been his mother\'s faith. Sometimes in the deepening dusk he\r\ncould almost see her sitting here.\r\n\r\n"This faith in you has come from me. This is my memory living on in you, my\r\nson, though you do not know. How many times have I held you back, how many\r\ntimes have I urged you on, roused you up or soothed you, made you hope or\r\nfear or dream, through memories of long ago. For you were once a part of\r\nme. I moulded you, my little son. And as I have been to you, so you will be\r\nto your children. In their lives, too, we shall be there--silent and\r\ninvisible, the dim strong figures of the past. For this is the power of\r\nfamilies, this is the mystery of birth."\r\n\r\nSuddenly he started. What was it that had thrilled him so? Only a tall dark\r\nfir in the birches. But looming in there like a shadowy phantom it had\r\nrecalled a memory of a dusk far back in his boyhood, when seeing a shadow\r\njust like this he had thought it a ghost in very truth and had run for the\r\nhouse like a rabbit! How terribly real that fright had been! The\r\nrecollection suddenly became so vivid in his mind, that as though a veil\r\nhad been lifted he felt the living presence here, close by his side, of a\r\nsmall barefoot mountain lad, clothed in sober homespun gray, but filled\r\nwith warm desires, dreams and curiosities, exploring upon every hand, now\r\nmarching boldly forward, now stealing up so cautiously, now galloping away\r\nlike mad! "I was once a child." To most of us these are mere words. To few\r\nis it ever given to attain so much as even a glimpse into the warm and\r\nquivering soul of that little stranger of long ago. We do not know how we\r\nwere made.\r\n\r\n"I moulded you, my little son. And as I have been to you, so you will be to\r\nyour children. In their lives, too, we shall be there."\r\n\r\nDarker, darker grew the copse and the chill of the night descended. But to\r\nRoger\'s eyes there was no gloom. For he had seen a vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his return to the city, Roger found that Deborah\'s school had apparently\r\nswept all other interests out of her mind. Baird hardly ever came to the\r\nhouse, and she herself was seldom there except for a hasty dinner at night.\r\nThe house had to run itself more or less; and though Annie the cook was\r\ndoing her best, things did not run so smoothly. Roger missed little\r\ncomforts, attentions, and he missed Deborah most of all. When he came down\r\nto his breakfast she had already left the house, and often she did not\r\nreturn until long after he was in bed. She felt the difference herself, and\r\nthough she did not put it in words her manner at times seemed to beg his\r\nforbearance. But there were many evenings when her father found it\r\ndifficult to hold to the resolve he had made, to go slowly with his\r\ndaughter until he could be more sure of his ground. She was growing so\r\nintense again. From the school authorities she had secured a still wider\r\nrange and freedom for her new experiment, and she was working day and night\r\nto put her ideas into effect.\r\n\r\n"It\'s only too easy," she remarked, "to launch an idea in this town. The\r\ntown will put it in headlines at once, and with it a picture of yourself in\r\nyour best bib and tucker, looking as though you loved the whole world. And\r\nyou can make a wonderful splurge, until they go on to the next new thing.\r\nThe real trouble comes in working it out."\r\n\r\nAnd this she had set out to do. Many nights in the autumn Roger went down\r\nto the school, to try to get some clear idea of this vision of hers for\r\nchildren, which in a vague way he could feel was so much larger than his\r\nown, for he had seen its driving force in the grip it had upon her life. At\r\nfirst he could make nothing of it at all; everywhere chaos met his eyes.\r\nBut he found something formless, huge, that made to him a strong appeal.\r\n\r\nThe big building fairly hummed at night with numberless activities.\r\nFathers, mothers and children came pouring in together and went skurrying\r\noff to their places. They learned to speak English, to read and write;\r\ngrown men and women scowled and toiled over their arithmetic. They worked\r\nat trades in the various shops; they hammered and sawed and set up type;\r\nthey cooked and sewed and gossiped. "The Young Galician Socialist Girls"\r\ndebated on the question: "Resolved that woman suffrage has worked in\r\nColorado." "The Caruso Pleasure Club" gave a dance to "The Garibaldi\r\nWhirlwinds." An orchestra rehearsed like mad. They searched their memories\r\nfor the songs and all the folk tales they had heard in peasant huts in\r\nItaly, in hamlets along rocky coasts, in the dark old ghettos of crowded\r\ntowns in Poland and in Russia. And some of these songs were sung in school,\r\nand some of these tales were dramatized here. Children and parents all took\r\npart. And speakers emerged from the neighborhood. It was at times\r\nappalling, the number of young Italians and Jews who had ideas to give\r\nforth to their friends on socialism, poverty, marriage and religion, and\r\nall the other questions that rose among these immigrants jammed into this\r\ntenement hive. But when there were too many of these self-appointed guides,\r\nthe neighborhood shut down on them.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t want," declared one indignant old woman, "that every young loafer\r\nshould shout in our face!"\r\n\r\nRoger was slowly attracted into this enormous family life, and yielding to\r\nan impulse he took charge of a boys\' club which met on Thursday evenings\r\nthere. He knew well this job of fathering a small jovial group of lads; he\r\nhad done it before, many years ago, in the mission school, to please his\r\nwife; he felt himself back on familiar ground. And from this point of\r\nvantage, with something definite he could do, he watched with an interest\r\nmore clear the school form steadily closer ties with the tenements that\r\nhedged it \'round, gathering its big family. And this family by slow degrees\r\nbegan to make itself a part of the daily life of Roger\'s house. Committees\r\nheld their meetings here, teachers dropped in frequently, and Roger invited\r\nthe boys in his club to come up and see him whenever they liked.\r\n\r\nHis most frequent visitor was Johnny Geer, the cripple. He was working in\r\nRoger\'s office now and the two had soon become close friends. John kept\r\nhimself so neat and clean, he displayed such a keen interest in all the\r\ndetails of office work, and he showed such a beaming appreciation of\r\nanything that was done for him.\r\n\r\n"That boy is getting a hold on me lately almost like a boy of my own,"\r\nRoger said one evening when Allan Baird was at the house. "He\'s the\r\npluckiest young un I ever met. I\'ve put him to work in my private office,\r\nwhere he can use the sofa to rest, and I\'ve made him my own\r\nstenographer--partly because he\'s so quick at dictation and partly to try\r\nto make him slow down. He has the mind of a race horse. He runs at night to\r\nlibraries until I should think he\'d go insane. And his body can\'t stand it,\r\nhe\'s breaking down--though whenever I ask him how he feels, he always says,\r\n\'Fine, thank you.\'" Here Roger turned to Allan. "I wish you\'d take the\r\nboy," he said, "to the finest specialist in town, and see what can be done\r\nfor his spine. I\'ll pay any price."\r\n\r\n"There won\'t be any price," said Allan, "but I\'ll see to it at once."\r\n\r\nHe had John examined the same week.\r\n\r\n"Well?" asked Roger when next they met.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Baird, "it isn\'t good news."\r\n\r\n"You mean he\'s hopeless?" Allan nodded:\r\n\r\n"It\'s Pott\'s disease, and it\'s gone too far. John is eighteen. He may live\r\nto be thirty."\r\n\r\n"But I tell you, Baird, I\'ll do anything!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s almost nothing you can do. If he had been taken when he was a\r\nbaby, he might have been cured and given a chance. But the same mother who\r\ndropped him then, when she was full of liquor, just went to the druggist on\r\nher block, and after listening to his advice she bought some patent\r\nmedicine, a steel jacket and some crutches, and thought she\'d done her\r\nduty."\r\n\r\n"But there must be something we can do!" retorted Roger angrily.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Baird, "we can make him a little more comfortable. And\r\nmeanwhile we can help Deborah here to get hold of other boys like John and\r\ngive \'em a chance before it\'s too late--keep them from being crippled for\r\nlife because their mothers were too blind and ignorant to act in time."\r\nBaird\'s voice had a ring of bitterness.\r\n\r\n"Most of \'em love their children," Roger said uneasily. Baird turned on him\r\na steady look.\r\n\r\n"Love isn\'t enough," he retorted. "The time is coming very soon when we\'ll\r\nhave the right to guard the child not only when it\'s a baby but even before\r\nit has been born."\r\n\r\nRoger drew closer to John after this. Often behind the beaming smile he\r\nwould feel the pain and loneliness, and the angry grit which was fighting\r\nit down. And so he would ask John home to supper on nights when nobody else\r\nwas there. One day late in the afternoon they were walking home together\r\nalong the west side of Madison Square. The big open space was studded with\r\nlights sparkling up at the frosty stars, in a city, a world, a universe\r\nthat seemed filled with the zest and the vigor of life. Out of these lights\r\na mighty tower loomed high up into the sky. And stopping on his crutches, a\r\ngrim small crooked figure in all this rushing turmoil, John set his jaws,\r\nand with his shrewd and twinkling eyes fixed on the top of the tower, he\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n"I meant to tell you, Mr. Gale. You was asking me once what I wanted to be.\r\nAnd I want to be an architect."\r\n\r\n"Do, eh," grunted Roger. He, too, looked up at that thing in the stars, and\r\nthere was a tightening at his throat. "All right," he added, presently,\r\n"why not start in and be one?"\r\n\r\n"How?" asked John alertly.\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy," said Roger, "I\'d hate to lose you in the office--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, and I\'d hate to go." Just then the big clock in the tower began\r\nto boom the hour, and a chill struck into Roger.\r\n\r\n"You\'d have to," he said gruffly. "You haven\'t any time to lose! I mean,"\r\nhe hastily added, "that for a job as big as that you\'d need a lot of\r\ntraining. But if it\'s what you want to be, go right ahead. I\'ll back you.\r\nMy son-in-law is a builder at present. I\'ll talk to him and get his advice.\r\nWe may be able to arrange to have you go right into his office, begin at\r\nthe bottom and work straight up." In silence for a moment John hobbled on\r\nby Roger\'s side.\r\n\r\n"I\'d hate to leave your place," he said.\r\n\r\n"I know," was Roger\'s brusque reply, "and I\'d hate to lose you. We\'ll have\r\nto think it over."\r\n\r\nA few days later he talked with Bruce, who said he\'d be glad to take the\r\nboy. And at dinner that night with Deborah, Roger asked abruptly,\r\n\r\n"Why not let Johnny come here for a while and use one of our empty\r\nbedrooms?"\r\n\r\nWith a quick flush of pleased surprise, Deborah gave her father a look that\r\nembarrassed him tremendously.\r\n\r\n"Well, why not?" he snapped at her. "Sensible, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly."\r\n\r\nAnd sensible it turned out to be. When John first heard about it, he was\r\napparently quite overcome, and there followed a brief awkward pause while\r\nhe rapidly blinked the joy from his eyes. But then he said, "Fine, thank\r\nyou. That\'s mighty good of you, Mr. Gale," in as matter of fact a tone as\r\nyou please. And he entered the household in much the same way, for John had\r\na sense of the fitness of things. He had always kept himself neat and\r\nclean, but he became immaculate now. He dined with Roger the first night,\r\nbut early the next morning he went down to the kitchen and breakfasted\r\nthere; and from this time on, unless he were especially urged to come up to\r\nthe dining room, John took all his meals downstairs. The maids were\r\nIrish--so was John. They were good Catholics--so was John. They loved the\r\nmovies--so did John. In short, it worked out wonderfully. In less than a\r\nmonth John had made himself an unobtrusive and natural part of the life of\r\nRoger\'s sober old house. It had had to stretch just a little, no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nBut that winter there was more in the house than Deborah\'s big family.\r\nThough at times Roger felt it surging in with its crude, immense vitality,\r\nthere were other times when it was not so, and the lives of his other two\r\ndaughters attracted his attention, for both were back again in town.\r\n\r\nLaura and her husband had returned from abroad in October, and in a small\r\nbut expensive apartment in a huge new building facing on Park Avenue they\r\nhad gaily started the career of their own little family, or "m\xe9nage," as\r\nLaura called it. This word had stuck in Roger\'s mind, for he had a\r\nsuspicion that a "m\xe9nage" was no place for babies. Grimly, when he went\r\nthere first to be shown the new home by its mistress, he looked about him\r\nfor a room which might be made a nursery. But no such room was in evidence.\r\n"We decided to have no guest room," he heard Laura say to Deborah. And\r\nglancing at his daughter then, sleek and smiling and demure, in her\r\ntea-gown fresh from Paris, Roger darkly told himself that a child would be\r\nan unwelcome guest. The whole place was as compact and sparkling as a jewel\r\nbox. The bed chamber was luxurious, with a gorgeous bath adjoining and a\r\ndressing-room for Harold.\r\n\r\n"And look at this love of a closet!" said Laura to Deborah eagerly. "Isn\'t\r\nit simply enormous?" As Deborah looked, her father did, too, and his eye\r\nwas met by an array of shimmering apparel which made him draw back almost\r\nwith a start.\r\n\r\nThey found Harold in the pantry. Their Jap, it appeared, was a marvellous\r\ncook and did the catering as well, so that Laura rarely troubled herself\r\nto order so much as a single meal. But her husband had for many years been\r\nfamous for his cocktails, and although the Jap did everything else Hal had\r\nkept this in his own hands.\r\n\r\n"I thought this much of the house-keeping ought to remain in the family,"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nRoger did not like this joke. But later, when he had imbibed the delicious\r\nconcoction Harold had made, and had eaten the dinner created by that\r\nJapanese artist of theirs, his irritation subsided.\r\n\r\n"They barely know we\'re here," he thought. "They\'re both in love up to\r\ntheir ears."\r\n\r\nDespite their genial attempts to be hospitable and friendly, time and again\r\nhe saw their glances meet in an intimate gleaming manner which made him\r\nrather uncomfortable. But where was the harm, he asked himself. They were\r\nmarried all right, weren\'t they? Still somehow--somehow--no, by George, he\r\ndidn\'t like it, he didn\'t approve! The whole affair was decidedly mixing.\r\nRoger went away vaguely uneasy, and he felt that Deborah was even more\r\ndisturbed than himself.\r\n\r\n"Those two," she remarked to her father, "are so fearfully wrapt up in each\r\nother it makes me afraid. Oh, it\'s all right, I suppose, and I wouldn\'t for\r\nworlds try to interfere. But I can\'t help feeling somehow that no two\r\npeople with such an abundance of youth and money and happiness have the\r\nright to be so amazingly--selfish!"\r\n\r\n"They ought to have children," Roger said.\r\n\r\n"But look at Edith," his daughter rejoined. "She hasn\'t a single interest\r\nthat I can find outside her home. It seems to have swallowed her, body and\r\nsoul." A frowning look of perplexity swept over Deborah\'s mobile face, and\r\nwith a whimsical sigh she exclaimed, "Oh, this queer business of families!"\r\n\r\nIn December there came a little crash. Late one evening Laura came bursting\r\nin upon them in a perfect tantrum, every nerve in her lithe body tense,\r\nher full lips visibly quivering, her voice unsteady, and her big black eyes\r\naflame with rage. She was jealous of her husband and "that nasty little\r\ncat!" Roger learned no more about it, for Deborah motioned him out of the\r\nroom. He heard their two voices talk on and on, until Laura\'s slowly\r\nquieted down. Soon afterwards she left the house, and Deborah came in to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"She\'s gone home, eh?" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she has, poor silly child--she said at first she had come here to\r\nstay."\r\n\r\n"By George," he said. "As bad as that?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it isn\'t as bad as that!" Deborah cried impatiently. "She just\r\nbuilt and built on silly suspicions and let herself get all worked up! I\r\ndon\'t see what they\'re coming to!" For a few moments nothing was said.\r\n"It\'s so unnatural!" she exclaimed. "Men and women weren\'t _made_ to live\r\nlike that!" Roger scowled into his paper.\r\n\r\n"Better leave \'em alone," he admonished her. "You can\'t help--they\'re not\r\nyour kind. Don\'t you mix into this affair."\r\n\r\nBut Deborah did. She remembered that her sister had once shown quite a\r\ntalent for amateur theatricals; and to give Laura something to do, Deborah\r\npersuaded her to take a dramatic club in her school. And Laura, rather to\r\nRoger\'s surprise, became an enthusiast down there. She worked like a slave\r\nat rehearsals, and upon the costumes she spent money with a lavish hand.\r\nMoreover, instead of being annoyed, as Edith was, at Deborah\'s prominence\r\nin the press, Laura gloried in it, as though this "radical" sister of hers\r\nwere a distinct social asset among her giddy friends uptown. For even\r\nLaura\'s friends, her father learned with astonishment, had acquired quite\r\nan appetite for men and women with ideas--the more "radical," the better.\r\nBut the way Laura used this word at times made Roger\'s blood run cold. She\r\nwas vivid in her approval of her sister\'s whole idea, as a scheme of\r\nwholesale motherhood which would give "a perfectly glorious jolt" to the\r\nold-fashioned home with its overworked mothers who let their children\r\nabsorb their days.\r\n\r\n"As though having children and bringing them up," she disdainfully\r\ndeclared, "were something every woman must do, whether she happens to like\r\nit or not, at the cost of any real growth of her own!"\r\n\r\nAnd smilingly she hinted at impending radical changes in the whole relation\r\nof marriage, of which she was hearing in detail at a series of lectures to\r\nyoung wives, delivered on Thursday mornings in a hotel ball-room.\r\n\r\nWhat the devil was getting into the town? Roger frowned his deep dislike.\r\nHere was Laura with her chicken\'s mind blithely taking her sister\'s\r\nthoughts and turning them topsy-turvy, to make for herself a view of life\r\nwhich fitted like a white kid glove her small and elegant "m\xe9nage." And\r\nalthough her father had only inklings of it all, he had quite enough to\r\nmake him irate at this uncanny interplay of influences in his family. Why\r\ncouldn\'t the girls leave each other alone?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in the winter, Edith, too, had entered in. It had taken Edith just\r\none glance into the bride\'s apartment to grasp Laura\'s whole scheme of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n"Selfish, indulgent and abnormal," was the way she described it. She and\r\nBruce were dining with Roger that night. "I wash my hands of the whole\r\naffair," continued Edith curtly. "So long as she doesn\'t want my help, as\r\nshe has plainly made me feel, I certainly shan\'t stand in her way."\r\n\r\n"You\'re absolutely right," said her father.\r\n\r\n"Stick to it," said Bruce approvingly.\r\n\r\nBut Edith did not stick to it. In her case too, as the weeks wore on, those\r\nsubtle family ties took hold and made her feel the least she could do was\r\n"to keep up appearances." So she and Bruce dined with the bride and groom,\r\nand in turn had them to dinner. And these dinners, as Bruce confided to\r\nRoger, were occasions no man could forget.\r\n\r\n"They come only about once a month," he said in a tone of pathos, "but it\r\nseems as though barely a week had gone by when Edith says to me again,\r\n\'We\'re dining with Laura and Hal to-night.\' Well, and we dine. Young Sloane\r\nis not a bad sort of a chap--works hard downtown and worships his wife. The\r\nway he lives--well, it isn\'t mine--and mine isn\'t his--and we both let it\r\ngo at that. But the women can\'t, they haven\'t it in \'em. Each sits with her\r\nway of life in her lap. You can\'t see it over the tablecloth, but, my God,\r\nhow you feel it! The worst of it is," he ended, "that after one of these\r\nterrible meals each woman is more set than before in her own way of living.\r\nNot that I don\'t like Edith\'s way," her husband added hastily.\r\n\r\nEdith also disapproved of the fast increasing publicity which Deborah was\r\ngetting.\r\n\r\n"I may be very old-fashioned," she remarked to her father, "but I can\'t get\r\nused to this idea that a woman\'s place is in headlines. And I think it\'s\r\nrather hard on you--the use she\'s making of your house."\r\n\r\nOne Friday night when she came to play chess, she found her father in the\r\nmidst of a boisterous special meeting of his club of Italian boys. It had\r\nbeen postponed from the evening before. And though Roger, overcome with\r\ndismay at having forgotten Edith\'s night, apologized profusely, the\r\ntime-honored weekly game took place no more from that day on.\r\n\r\n"Edith\'s pretty sore," said Bruce, who dropped in soon afterwards. "She\r\nsays Deborah has made your house into an annex to her school."\r\n\r\nRoger smoked in silence. His whole family was about his ears.\r\n\r\n"My boy," he muttered earnestly, "you and I must stick together."\r\n\r\n"We sure must," agreed his son-in-law. "And what\'s more, if we\'re to keep\r\nthe peace, we\'ve got to try to put some punch into Deborah\'s so-called love\r\naffair. She ought to get married and settle down."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Roger, dubiously. "Only let\'s keep it to ourselves."\r\n\r\n"No chance of that," was the cheerful reply. "You can\'t keep Edith out of\r\nit. It would only make trouble in _my_ family." Roger gave him a pitying\r\nlook and said,\r\n\r\n"Then, for the Lord\'s sake, let her in!"\r\n\r\nSo they took Edith into their councils, and she gave them an indulgent\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Suppose you leave this to me," she commanded. "Don\'t you think I\'ve been\r\nusing my eyes? There\'s no earthly use in stepping in now, for Deborah has\r\nlost her head. She sees herself a great new woman with a career. But wait\r\ntill the present flare-up subsides, till the newspapers all drop her and\r\nshe is thoroughly tired out. Until then, remember, we keep our hands off."\r\n\r\n"Do you think you can?" asked Roger, with a little glimmer of hope.\r\n\r\n"I?" she retorted. "Most certainly! I mean to leave her alone\r\nabsolutely--until she comes to me herself. When she does, we\'ll know it\'s\r\ntime to begin."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid Edith is hurt about something," said Deborah to her father,\r\nabout a month after this little talk. "She hasn\'t been near us for over\r\nthree weeks."\r\n\r\n"Let her be!" said Roger, in alarm. "I mean," he hastily added, "why can\'t\r\nyou let Edith come when she likes? There\'s nothing the matter. It\'s simply\r\nher children--they take up her time."\r\n\r\n"No," said Deborah calmly, "it\'s I. She as good as told me so last month.\r\nShe thinks I\'ve become a perfect fanatic--without a spare moment or\r\nthought for my family."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my family!" Roger groaned. "I tell you, Deborah, you\'re wrong! Edith\'s\r\nchildren are probably sick in bed!"\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll go and see," she answered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Something has happened to Deborah," Edith informed him blithely, over the\r\ntelephone the next night.\r\n\r\n"Has, eh," grunted Roger.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she was here to see me to-day. And something has happened--she\'s\r\nchanging fast. I felt it in all kinds of ways. She was just as dear as she\r\ncould be--and lonely, as though she were feeling her age. I really think we\r\ncan do something now."\r\n\r\n"All right, let\'s do something," Roger growled.\r\n\r\nAnd Edith began to do something. Her hostility to her sister had completely\r\ndisappeared. In its place was a friendly affection, an evident desire to\r\nplease. She even drew Laura into the secret, and there was a gathering of\r\nthe clan. There were consultations in Roger\'s den. "Deborah is to get\r\nmarried." The feeling of it crept through the house. Nothing was said to\r\nher, of course, but Deborah was made to feel that her two sisters had drawn\r\nclose. And their influence upon her choice was more deep and subtle than\r\nshe knew. For although Roger\'s family had split so wide apart, between his\r\nthree daughters there were still mysterious bonds reaching far back into\r\nnursery days. And Deborah in deciding whether to marry Allan Baird was\r\naffected more than she was aware by the married lives of her sisters. All\r\nshe had seen in Laura\'s m\xe9nage, all that she had ever observed in Edith\'s\r\ngrowing family, kept rising from time to time in her thoughts, as she\r\nvaguely tried to picture herself a wife and the mother of children.\r\n\r\nSo the family, with those subtle bonds from the past, began to press\r\nsteadily closer and closer around this one unmarried daughter, and help her\r\nto make up her mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nBut she did not appear to care to be helped. Nor did Allan--he rarely came\r\nto the house, and he went to Edith\'s not at all. He was even absent from\r\nher Christmas tree for the children, a jolly little festivity which neither\r\nhe nor Deborah had missed in years.\r\n\r\n"What has got into him?" Roger asked. And shortly after Christmas he called\r\nthe fellow up on the \'phone. "Drop in for dinner to-night," he urged. And\r\nhe added distinctly, "I\'m alone."\r\n\r\n"Are you? I\'ll be glad to."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Baird, I want your advice." And as he hung up the receiver he\r\nsaid, "Now then!" to himself, in a tone of firm decision. But later, as the\r\nday wore on, he cursed himself for what he had done. "Don\'t it beat the\r\ndevil," he thought, "how I\'m always putting my foot in it?" And when Baird\r\ncame into the room that night he loomed, to Roger\'s anxious eye, if\r\nanything taller than before. But his manner was so easy, his gruff voice so\r\nnatural, and he seemed to take this little party of two so quietly as a\r\nmatter of course, that Roger was soon reassured, and at table he and Allan\r\ngot on even better than before. Baird talked of his life as a student, in\r\nVienna, Bonn and Edinburgh, and of his first struggles in New York. His\r\ntalk was full of human bits, some tragic, more amusing. And Roger\'s liking\r\nfor the man increased with every story told.\r\n\r\n"I asked you here," he bluntly began, when they had gone to the study to\r\nsmoke, "to talk to you about Deborah." Baird gave him a friendly look.\r\n\r\n"All right. Let\'s talk about her."\r\n\r\n"It strikes me you were right last year," said Roger, speaking slowly.\r\n"She\'s already showing the strain of her work. She don\'t look to me as\r\nstrong as she was."\r\n\r\n"She looks to me stronger," Allan replied. "You know, people fool doctors\r\nnow and then--and she seems to have taken a fresh start. I feel she may go\r\non for years." Roger was silent a moment, chagrined and disappointed.\r\n\r\n"Have you had a good chance to watch her?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I\'m watching her still," said Baird. "I see her down there at the\r\nschool. She tells me you\'ve been there yourself."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Roger, determinedly, "and I mean to keep on going. I\'m trying\r\nnot to lose hold of her," he added with harsh emphasis. Baird turned and\r\nfrankly smiled at him.\r\n\r\n"Then you have probably seen," he replied, "that to keep any hold at all on\r\nher, you must make up your mind as I have done that, strength or no\r\nstrength, this job of hers is going to be a life career. When a woman who\r\nhas held a job without a break for eleven years can feel such a flame of\r\nenthusiasm, you can be pretty sure, I think, it is the deepest part of her.\r\nAt least I feel that way," he said. "And I believe the only way to keep\r\nnear her--for the present, anyhow--is to help her in her work."\r\n\r\nWhen Baird had gone, Roger found himself angry.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not in the habit, young man," he thought, "of throwing my daughter at\r\ngentlemen\'s heads. If you feel as calm and contented as that you can go to\r\nthe devil! Far be it from me to lift a hand! In fact, as I come to think of\r\nit, you would probably make her a mighty poor husband!" He worked himself\r\ninto quite a rage. But an hour later, when he had subsided, "Hold on," he\r\nthought. "Am I right about this? Is the man as contented as he talks? No,\r\nsir, not for a minute he isn\'t! But what can he do? If he tried making love\r\nto Deborah he\'d simply be killing his chances. Not the slightest doubt in\r\nthe world. She can\'t think of anything but her career. Yes, sir, when all\'s\r\nsaid and done, to marry a modern woman is no child\'s play, it means thought\r\nand care. And A. Baird has made up his mind to it. He has made up his mind\r\nto marry her by playing a long waiting game. He\'s just slowly and quietly\r\nnosing his way into her school, because it\'s her life. And a mighty shrewd\r\nway of going about it. You don\'t need any help from me, my friend; all you\r\nneed is to be let alone."\r\n\r\nIn talks at home with Deborah, and in what he himself observed at school,\r\nRoger began to get inklings of "A. Baird\'s long waiting game." He found\r\nthat several months before Allan had offered to start a free clinic for\r\nmothers and children in connection with the school, and that he alone had\r\nput it through, with only the most reluctant aid and gratitude from\r\nDeborah--as though she dreaded something. Baird took countless hours from\r\nhis busy uptown practice; he hurt himself more than once, in fact, by\r\nneglecting rich patients to do this work. Where a sick or pregnant mother\r\nwas too poor to carry out his advice, he followed her into her tenement\r\nhome, sent one of his nurses to visit her, and even gave money when it was\r\nneeded to ease the strain of her poverty until she should be well and\r\nstrong. Soon scores of the mothers of Deborah\'s children were singing the\r\npraises of Doctor Baird.\r\n\r\nThen he began coming to the house.\r\n\r\n"I was right," thought Roger complacently.\r\n\r\nHe laid in a stock of fine cigars and some good port and claret, too; and\r\non evenings when Baird came to dine, Roger by a genial glow and occasional\r\njocular ironies would endeavor to drag the talk away from clinics,\r\nadenoids, children\'s teeth, epidemics and the new education. But no joke\r\nwas so good that Deborah could not promptly match it with some amusing\r\nlittle thing which one of her children had said or done. For she had a\r\nmother\'s instinct for bragging fondly of her brood. It was deep, it was\r\nuncanny, this queer community motherhood.\r\n\r\n"This poor devil," Roger thought, with a pitying glance at Baird, "might\r\njust as well be marrying a widow with three thousand brats."\r\n\r\nBut Baird did not seem in the least dismayed. On the contrary, his\r\nassurance appeared to be deepening every week, and with it Deborah\'s air of\r\nalarm. For his clinic, as it swiftly grew, he secured financial backing\r\nfrom his rich women patients uptown, many of them childless and only too\r\nready to respond to the appeals he made to them. And one Saturday evening\r\nat the house, while dining with Roger and Deborah, he told of an offer he\r\nhad had from a wealthy banker\'s widow to build a maternity hospital. He\r\ntalked hungrily of all it could do in co-operation with the school. He said\r\nnothing of the obvious fact that it would require his whole time, but Roger\r\nthought of that at once, and by the expression on Deborah\'s face he saw she\r\nwas thinking, too.\r\n\r\nHe felt they wanted to be alone, so presently he left them. From his study\r\nhe could hear their voices growing steadily more intense. Was it all about\r\nwork? He could not tell. "They\'ve got working and living so mixed up, a man\r\ncan\'t possibly tell \'em apart."\r\n\r\nThen his daughter was called to the telephone, and Allan came in to bid\r\nRoger good-night. And his eyes showed an impatience he did not seem to care\r\nto hide.\r\n\r\n"Well?" inquired Roger. "Did you get Deborah\'s consent?"\r\n\r\n"To what?" asked Allan sharply.\r\n\r\n"To your acceptance," Roger answered, "of the widow\'s mite." Baird grinned.\r\n\r\n"She couldn\'t help herself," he said.\r\n\r\n"But she didn\'t seem to like it, eh--"\r\n\r\n"No," said Baird, "she didn\'t." Roger had a dark suspicion.\r\n\r\n"By the way," he asked in a casual tone, "what\'s this philanthropic widow\r\nlike?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s sixty-nine," Baird answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Roger. He smoked for a time, and sagely added, "My daughter\'s a\r\nqueer woman, Baird--she\'s modern, very modern. But she\'s still a woman, you\r\nunderstand--and so she\'s jealous--of her job." But A. Baird was in no\r\njoking mood.\r\n\r\n"She\'s narrow," he said sternly. "That\'s what\'s the matter with Deborah.\r\nShe\'s so centered on her job she can\'t see anyone else\'s. She thinks I\'m\r\ndoing all this work solely in order to help her school--when if she\'d use\r\nsome imagination and try to put herself in my shoes, she\'d see the chance\r\nit\'s giving _me_!"\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?" asked Roger, looking a bit bewildered.\r\n\r\n"Why," said Baird with an impatient fling of his hand, "there are men in my\r\nline all over the country who\'d leave home, wives and children for the\r\nchance I\'ve blundered onto here! A hospital fully equipped for research, a\r\nfree hand, an opportunity which comes to one man in a million! But can she\r\nsee it? Not at all! It\'s only an annex to her school!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Roger gravely, "she\'s in a pretty unnatural state. I think she\r\nought to get married, Baird--" To his friendly and disarming twinkle Baird\r\nreplied with a rueful smile.\r\n\r\n"You do, eh," he growled. "Then tell her to plan her wedding to come before\r\nher funeral." As he rose to go, Roger took his hand.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell her," he said. "It\'s sound advice. Good-night, my boy, I wish\r\nyou luck."\r\n\r\nA few moments later he heard in the hall their brief good-nights to each\r\nother, and presently Deborah came in. She was not looking quite herself.\r\n\r\n"Why are you eyeing me like that?" his daughter asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you letting him do a good deal for you?"\r\n\r\nDeborah flushed a little:\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am. I can\'t make him stop."\r\n\r\nHer father hesitated.\r\n\r\n"You could," he said, "if you wanted to. If you were sure," he added\r\nslowly, "that you didn\'t love him--and told him so." He felt a little\r\npanic, for he thought he had gone too far. But his daughter only turned\r\naway and restlessly moved about the room. At last she came to her father\'s\r\nchair:\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t you better leave this to me?"\r\n\r\n"I had, my dear, I most certainly had. I was all wrong to mention it," he\r\nanswered very humbly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this night on, Baird changed his tack. Although soon busy with the\r\nplans for the hospital, to be built at once, he said little about it to\r\nDeborah. Instead, he insisted on taking her off on little evening sprees\r\nuptown.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what\'s the matter with both of us?" he said to her one\r\nevening. "We\'ve been getting too durned devoted to our jobs and our ideals.\r\nYou\'re becoming a regular school marm and I\'m getting to be a regular slave\r\nto every wretched little babe who takes it into his head to be born. We\r\nhaven\'t one redeeming vice."\r\n\r\nAnd again he took up dancing. The first effort which he made, down at\r\nDeborah\'s school one evening, was a failure quite as dismal as his attempts\r\nof the previous year. But he did not appear in the least discouraged. He\r\ncame to the house one Friday night.\r\n\r\n"I knew I could learn to dance," he said, "in spite of all your taunts and\r\njibes. That little fiasco last Saturday night--"\r\n\r\n"Was perfectly awful," Deborah said.\r\n\r\n"Did not discourage me in the least," he continued severely. "I decided the\r\nonly trouble with me was that I\'m tall and I\'ve got to bend--to learn to\r\nbend."\r\n\r\n"Tremendously!"\r\n\r\n"So I went to a lady professor, and she saw the point at once. Since then\r\nI\'ve had five lessons, and I can fox-trot in my sleep. To-morrow is\r\nSaturday. Where shall we go?"\r\n\r\n"To the theater."\r\n\r\n"Good. We\'ll start with that. But the minute the play is over we\'ll gallop\r\noff to the Plaza Grill--just as the music is in full swing--"\r\n\r\n"And we\'ll dance," she groaned, "for hours. And when I get home, I\'ll creep\r\ninto bed so tired and sore in every limb--"\r\n\r\n"That you\'ll sleep late Sunday morning. And a mighty good thing for you,\r\ntoo--if you ask my advice--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t ask your advice!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re getting it, though," he said doggedly. "If you\'re still to be a\r\nfriend of mine we\'ll dance at the Plaza to-morrow night--and well into the\r\nSabbath."\r\n\r\n"The principal of a public school--dancing on the Sabbath. Suppose one of\r\nmy friends should see us there."\r\n\r\n"Your friends," he replied with a fine contempt, "do not dance in the Plaza\r\nGrill. I\'m the only roisterer you know."\r\n\r\n"All right," she conceded grudgingly, "I\'ll roister. Come and get me. But\r\nI\'d much prefer when the play is done to come home and have milk and\r\ncrackers here."\r\n\r\n"Deborah," he said cheerfully, "for a radical school reformer you\'re the\r\nmost conservative woman I know."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Deborah\'s school, in the meantime, affairs had drawn to a climax. The\r\nmoment had come for the city to say whether her new experiment should be\r\ndropped the following year or allowed to go on and develop. There came a\r\nday of sharp suspense when Deborah\'s friends and enemies on the Board of\r\nEducation sat down to discuss and settle her fate. They were at it for\r\nseveral hours, but late in the afternoon they decided not only to let her\r\ngo on the next year but to try her idea in four other schools and place her\r\nin charge with ample funds. The long strain came to an end at last in a\r\ntriumph beyond her wildest hopes; when the news arrived she relaxed, grew\r\nlimp, and laughed and cried a little. And her father felt her tremble as he\r\nheld her a moment in his arms.\r\n\r\n"Now, Baird," he thought, "your chance has come. For God\'s sake, take it\r\nwhile it\'s here!"\r\n\r\nBut in place of Baird that afternoon came men and women from the press, and\r\nfriends and fellow workers. The door-bell and the telephone kept ringing\r\nalmost incessantly. Why couldn\'t they leave her a moment\'s peace? Roger\r\nburied himself in his study. Later, when he was called to dinner, he found\r\nthat Allan was there, too, but at first the conversation was all upon\r\nDeborah\'s victory. Flushed with success, for the moment engrossed in the\r\nwider field she saw ahead, she had not a thought for anything else. But\r\nafter dinner the atmosphere changed.\r\n\r\n"To hear me talk," she told them, "you\'d think the whole world depended on\r\nme, and on my school and my ideas. Me, me, me! And it has been me all\r\nwinter long! What a time I\'ve given both of you!"\r\n\r\nShe grew repentant and grateful, first to her father and then to Allan, and\r\nthen more and more to Allan, with her happy eyes on his. And with a keen\r\nworried look at them both, Roger rose and left the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBaird was leaning forward. He had both her hands in his own.\r\n\r\n"Well?" he asked. "Will you marry me now?"\r\n\r\nHer eyes were looking straight into his. They kept moving slightly,\r\nsearching his. Her wide, sensitive lips were tightly compressed, but did\r\nnot quite hide their quivering. When she spoke her voice was low and a\r\nlittle queer and breathless:\r\n\r\n"Do you want any children, Allan?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"So do I. And with children, what of my work?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to stop your work. If you marry me we\'ll go right on. You see\r\nI know you, Deborah, I know you\'ve always grown like that--by risking what\r\nyou\'ve got to-day for something more to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never taken a risk like this!"\r\n\r\n"I tell you this time it\'s no risk! Because you\'re a grown woman--formed!\r\nI\'m not making a saint of you. You\'re no angel down among the poor because\r\nyou feel it\'s your duty in life--it\'s your happiness, your passion! You\r\ncouldn\'t neglect them if you tried!"\r\n\r\n"But the time," she asked him quickly. "Where shall I find the time for it\r\nall?"\r\n\r\n"A man finds time enough," he answered, "even when he\'s married."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m not a man, I\'m a woman," she said. And in a low voice which\r\nthrilled him, "A woman who wants a child of her own!" His lean muscular\r\nright hand contracted sharply upon hers. She winced, drew back a little.\r\n\r\n"Oh--I\'m sorry!" he whispered. Then he asked her again,\r\n\r\n"Will you marry me now?" She looked suddenly up:\r\n\r\n"Let\'s wait awhile, please! It won\'t be long--I\'m in love with you, Allan,\r\nI\'m sure of that now! And I\'m not drawing back, I\'m not afraid! Oh, I want\r\nyou to feel I\'m not running away! What I want to do is to face this square!\r\nIt may be silly and foolish but--you see, I\'m made like that. I want a\r\nlittle longer--I want to think it out by myself."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Allan had gone she came in to her father. And her radiant expression\r\nmade him bounce up from his chair.\r\n\r\n"By George," he cried, "he asked you!"\r\n\r\n"Yes!"\r\n\r\n"And you\'ve taken him!"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\nRoger gasped.\r\n\r\n"Look here!" he demanded, angrily. "What\'s the matter? Are you mad?" She\r\nthrew back her head and laughed at him.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not--I\'m happy!"\r\n\r\n"What the devil about?" he snapped.\r\n\r\n"We\'re going to wait a bit, that\'s all, till we\'re sure of everything!" she\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n"Then," said Roger disgustedly, "you\'re smarter than your father is. I\'m\r\nsure of nothing--nothing! I have never been sure in all my days! If I\'d\r\nwaited, you\'d never have been born!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dearie," she begged him smilingly. "Please don\'t be so unhappy just\r\nnow--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a right to be!" said Roger. "I see my house agog with this--in a\r\nturmoil--in a turmoil!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut again he was mistaken. It was in fact astonishing how the old house\r\nquieted down. There came again one of those peaceful times, when his home\r\nto Roger\'s senses seemed to settle deep, grow still, and gather itself\r\ntogether. Day by day he felt more sure that Deborah was succeeding in\r\nmaking her work fit into her swiftly deepening passion for a full happy\r\nwoman\'s life. And why shouldn\'t they live here, Allan and she? The thought\r\nof this dispelled the cloud which hung over the years he saw ahead. How\r\nsmoothly things were working out. The monstrous new buildings around his\r\nhouse seemed to him to draw back as though balked of their prey.\r\n\r\nOn the mantle in Roger\'s study, for many years a bronze figure there, "The\r\nThinker," huge and naked, forbidding in its crouching pose, the heavy chin\r\non one clenched fist, had brooded down upon him. And in the years that had\r\nbeen so dark, it had been a figure of despair. Often he had looked up from\r\nhis chair and grimly met its frowning gaze. But Roger seldom looked at it\r\nnow, and even when it caught his eye it had little effect upon him. It\r\nappeared to brood less darkly. For though he did not think it out, there\r\nwas this feeling in his mind:\r\n\r\n"There is to be nothing startling in this quiet home of mine, no crashing\r\ndeep calamity here."\r\n\r\nOnly the steadily deepening love between a grown man and a woman mature,\r\nboth sensible, strong people with a firm control of their destinies. He\r\nfelt so sure of this affair. For now, her tension once relaxed with the\r\nsuccess which had come to her after so many long hard years, a new Deborah\r\nwas revealed, more human in her yieldings. She let Allan take her off on\r\nthe wildest little sprees uptown and out into the country. To Roger she\r\nseemed younger, more warm and joyous and more free. He loved to hear her\r\nlaugh these nights, to catch the glad new tones in her voice.\r\n\r\n"There is to be no tragedy here."\r\n\r\nSo, certain of this union and wistful for all he felt it would bring, Roger\r\nwatched its swift approach. And when the news came, he was sure he\'d been\r\nright. Because it came so quietly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s settled, dear, at last it\'s sure. Allan and I are to be married." She\r\nwas standing by his chair. Roger reached up and took her hand:\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad. You\'ll be very happy, my child."\r\n\r\nShe bent over and kissed him, and putting his arm around her he drew her\r\ndown on the side of his chair.\r\n\r\n"Now tell me all your plans," he said. And her answer brought him a deep\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n"We\'re going abroad for the summer--and then if you\'ll have us we want to\r\ncome here." Roger abruptly shut his eyes.\r\n\r\n"By George, Deborah," he said, "you do have a way of getting right into the\r\nheart of things!" His arm closed about her with new strength and he felt\r\nall his troubles flying away.\r\n\r\n"What a time we\'ll have, what a rich new life." Her deep sweet voice was a\r\nlittle unsteady. "Listen, dearie, how quiet it is." And for some moments\r\nnothing was heard but the sober tick-tick of the clock on the mantle. "I\r\nwonder what we\'re going to hear."\r\n\r\nAnd they thought of new voices in the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nEdith was radiant at the news.\r\n\r\n"I do hope they\'re not going to grudge themselves a good long wedding\r\ntrip!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"They\'re going abroad," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"Oh, splendid! And the wedding! Church or home?"\r\n\r\n"Home," said Roger blissfully, "and short and simple, not a frill. Just the\r\nfamily."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s so nice," sighed Edith. "I was afraid she\'d want to drag in her\r\nschool."\r\n\r\n"School will be out by then," he said.\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope it stays out--for the remainder of her days. She can\'t do\r\nboth, and she\'ll soon see. Wait till she has a child of her own."\r\n\r\n"Well, she wants one bad enough."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but can she?" Edith asked, with the engrossed expression which came\r\non her pretty florid face whenever she neared such a topic. She spoke with\r\nevident awkwardness. "That\'s the trouble. Is it too late? Deborah\'s\r\nthirty-one, you know, and she has lived her life so hard. The sooner she\r\ngives up her school the better for her chances."\r\n\r\nThe face of her father clouded.\r\n\r\n"Look here," he said uneasily, "I wouldn\'t go talking to her--quite along\r\nthose lines, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not such an idiot," she replied. "She thinks me homely enough as it\r\nis. And she\'s not altogether wrong. Bruce and I were talking it over last\r\nnight. We want to be closer, after this, to Deborah and Allan. Bruce says\r\nit will do us _all_ good, and for once I think he\'s right. I _have_ given\r\ntoo much time to my children, and Bruce to his office--I see it now. Not\r\nthat I regret it, but--well, we\'re going to blossom out."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe struck the same note with Deborah. And so did Bruce.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Deborah dear," he said smiling, when he found a chance to see her\r\nalone, "if you knew how long I\'ve waited for this big fine thing to happen.\r\nA. Baird is my best chum in the world. Don\'t yank him gently away from us\r\nnow. We\'ll keep close--eh?--all four of us."\r\n\r\n"Very," said Deborah softly.\r\n\r\n"And you mustn\'t get too solemn, you know. You won\'t pull too much of the\r\nhighbrow stuff."\r\n\r\n"Heaven forbid!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the right idea. We\'ll have some fine little parties together. You\r\nand A. Baird will give us a hand and get us out in the evenings. We need\r\nit, God knows, we\'ve been getting old." Deborah threw him a glance of\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n"Why, Brucie," she said, in admiring tones, "I knew you had it in you."\r\n\r\n"So has Edith," he sturdily declared. "She only needs a little shove. We\'ll\r\nshow you two that we\'re regular fellows. Don\'t you be all school and we\r\nwon\'t be all home. We\'ll jump out of our skins and be young again."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this gay resolve, Bruce planned frequent parties to\r\ntheaters and musical shows, and to Edith\'s consternation he even began to\r\nlook about for a teacher from whom he could learn to dance. "A. Baird," he\r\ntold her firmly, "isn\'t going to be the only soubrette in this family."\r\n\r\nOne of the most hilarious of these small celebrations came early in June,\r\nwhen they dined all four together and went to the summer\'s opening of "The\r\nFollies of 1914." The show rather dragged a bit at first, but when Bert\r\nWilliams took the stage Bruce\'s laugh became so contagious that people in\r\nseats on every hand turned to look at him and join in his glee. Only one\r\nthing happened to mar the evening\'s pleasure. When they came outside the\r\ntheater Bruce found in his car something wrong with the engine. He tinkered\r\nbut it would not go. Allan hailed a taxi.\r\n\r\n"Why not come with us?" asked Deborah.\r\n\r\n"No, thanks," said Bruce. "I\'ve got this car to look after."\r\n\r\n"Oh, let it wait," urged Allan.\r\n\r\n"It does look a little like rain," put in Edith. Bruce glanced up at the\r\ncloudy sky and hesitated a moment.\r\n\r\n"Rain, piffle," he said good-humoredly. "Come on, wifey, stick by me. I\r\nwon\'t be long." And he and Edith went back to his car.\r\n\r\n"What a dear he is," said Deborah. Allan put his arm around her, and they\r\nlooked at each other and smiled. It was only nine days to the wedding.\r\n\r\nOut of the street\'s commotion came a sharp cry of warning. It was followed\r\nby a shriek and a crash. Allan looked out of the window, and then with a\r\nlow exclamation he jumped from the taxi and slammed the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nRoger had been spending a long quiet evening at home. He had asked John to\r\ndine with him and they had chatted for a time. Then John had started up to\r\nhis room. And listening to the slow shuffling step of the cripple going\r\nupstairs, Roger had thought of the quick eager feet and the sudden scampers\r\nthat would be heard as the silent old house renewed its life. Later he had\r\ngone to bed.\r\n\r\nHe awakened with a start. The telephone bell was ringing.\r\n\r\n"Nice time to be calling folks out of bed," he grumbled, as he went into\r\nthe hall. The next moment he heard Deborah\'s voice. It was clear and sharp\r\nwith a note of alarm.\r\n\r\n"Father--it\'s I! You must come to Edith\'s apartment at once! Bruce is hurt\r\nbadly! Come at once!"\r\n\r\nWhen Roger reached the apartment, it was Deborah who opened the door. Her\r\nface had changed, it was drawn and gray. She took him into the living room.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," he said harshly.\r\n\r\n"It was just outside the theater. Bruce and Edith were out in the street\r\nand got caught by some idiot of a chauffeur. Bruce threw Edith out of the\r\nway, but just as he did it he himself got struck in the back and went under\r\na wheel. Allan brought him here at once, while I telephoned for a friend of\r\nhis--a surgeon. They\'re with Bruce now."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Edith?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s trying to quiet the children. They all woke up--" Deborah\r\nfrowned--"when he was brought in," she added.\r\n\r\n"Well!" breathed Roger. "I declare!" Dazed and stunned, he sank into a\r\nchair. Soon the door opened and Allan came in.\r\n\r\n"He\'s gone," he said. And Deborah jumped. "No, no, I meant the doctor."\r\n\r\n"What does he say?"\r\n\r\n"Bruce can\'t live," said Allan gently. In the tense silence there came a\r\nchill. "And he knows it," Allan added. "He made me tell him--he said he\r\nmust know--for business reasons. He wants to see you both at once, before\r\nEdith gets that child asleep."\r\n\r\nAs they entered the room they saw Bruce on his bed. He was breathing\r\nquickly through his narrow tight-set jaws and staring up at the ceiling\r\nwith a straining fixed intensity. As they entered he turned his head. His\r\neyes met theirs and lighted up in a hard and terrible manner.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not leaving them a dollar!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll see to them, boy," said Roger, hoarsely, but Bruce had already\r\nturned to Baird.\r\n\r\n"I make you my executor, Allan--don\'t need it in writing--there isn\'t\r\ntime." He drew a sudden quivering breath. "I have no will," he muttered on.\r\n"Never made one--never thought of this. Business life just\r\nstarting--booming!--and I put in every cent!" There broke from him a low,\r\nbitter groan. "Made my money settling other men\'s muddles! Never thought of\r\nmaking this mess of my own! But even in mine--I could save something\r\nstill--if I could be there--if I could be there--"\r\n\r\nThe sweat broke out on his temples, and Deborah laid her hand on his head.\r\n"Sh-h-h," she breathed. He shut his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Hard to think of anything any more. I can\'t keep clear." He shuddered with\r\npain. "Fix me for _them_," he muttered to Baird. "George and his mother.\r\nFix me up--give me a couple of minutes clear. And Deborah--when you bring\r\n\'em in--don\'t let \'em know. You understand? No infernal last good-byes!"\r\nDeborah sharply set her teeth.\r\n\r\n"No, dear, no," she whispered. She followed her father out of the room,\r\nleaving Allan bending over the bed with a hypodermic in his hand. And when,\r\na few moments later, George came in with his mother, they found Bruce\r\nsoothed and quieted. He even smiled as he reached up his hand.\r\n\r\n"They say I\'ve got to sleep, old girl--just sleep and sleep--it\'ll do me\r\ngood. So you mustn\'t stay in the room to-night. Stay with the kiddies and\r\nget \'em to sleep." He was still smiling up at her. "They say it\'ll be a\r\nlong time, little wife--and I\'m so sorry--I was to blame. If I\'d done as\r\nyou wanted and gone in their taxi. Remember? You said it might rain." He\r\nturned to George: "Look here, my boy, I\'m counting on you. I\'ll be sick,\r\nyou know--no good at all. You must stand by your mother."\r\n\r\nGeorge gulped awkwardly:\r\n\r\n"Sure I will, dad." His father sharply pressed his hand:\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, old fellow, I know what you are. Now good-night, son.\r\nGood-night, Edith dear." He looked at her steadily just for a moment, then\r\nclosed his eyes. "Oh, but I\'m sleepy," he murmured. "Good-night."\r\n\r\nAnd they left him. Alone with Allan, Bruce looked up with a savage glare.\r\n\r\n"Look here!" he snarled, between his teeth. "If you think I\'m going to lie\r\nhere and die you\'re mistaken! I won\'t! I won\'t let go! I\'ll show you chaps\r\nyou can be wrong! Been wrong before, haven\'t you, thousands of times! Why\r\nbe so damnably sure about _me_?" He fell back suddenly, limp and weak. "So\r\ndamnably sure," he panted.\r\n\r\n"We\'re never sure, my dear old boy," said Allan very tenderly. Again he\r\nwas bending close over the bed. "We\'re not sure yet--by any means. You\'re\r\nso strong, old chap, so amazingly strong. You\'ve given me hope--"\r\n\r\n"What are you sticking into my arm?" But Allan kept talking steadily on:\r\n\r\n"You\'ve given me hope you\'ll pull through still. But not like this. You\'ve\r\ngot to rest. Let go, and try to go to sleep."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid to," came the whisper. But soon, as again the drug took hold,\r\nhe mumbled in a drowsy tone, "Afraid to go to sleep in the dark.... Say,\r\nAllan--get Deborah in here, will you--just for a minute. One thing more."\r\n\r\nWhen she came, he did not open his eyes.\r\n\r\n"That you, Deborah? Where\'s your hand?... Oh--there it is. Just one more\r\npoint. You--you--" Again his mind wandered, but with an effort he brought\r\nit back. "You and Edith," he said in a whisper. "So--so--so different.\r\nNot--not like each other at all. But you\'ll stick together--eh?\r\nAlways--always. Don\'t let go--I mean of my hand."\r\n\r\n"No, dear, no."\r\n\r\nAnd with her hand holding his, she sat for a long time perfectly still.\r\nThen the baby was heard crying, and Deborah went to the nursery.\r\n\r\n"Now, Edith, I\'ll see to the children," she said. "Allan says you can go to\r\nBruce if you like."\r\n\r\nEdith looked up at Deborah quickly, and as quickly turned away. She went in\r\nto her husband. And there, hour by hour through the night, while he lay\r\ninert with his hand in hers, little by little she understood. But she asked\r\nno question of anyone.\r\n\r\nAt last Bruce stirred a little and began breathing deep and fast.\r\n\r\nAnd so death came into the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nRoger went through the next two days in a kind of a stupor. He remembered\r\nholding Edith and feeling her shudder as though from a chill. He remembered\r\nbeing stopped in the hall by George who had dressed himself with care in\r\nhis first suit with long trousers. "I just wanted you to remember," the boy\r\nwhispered solemnly, "that I\'m nearly sixteen and I\'ll be here. He said to\r\nstand by her and I will." The rest of that ghastly time was a blank,\r\npunctuated by small quiet orders which Roger obeyed. Thank God, Deborah was\r\nthere, and she was attending to everything.\r\n\r\nBut when at last it was over, and Roger had spent the next day in his\r\noffice, had found it impossible to work and so had gone home early, Deborah\r\ncame to him in his room.\r\n\r\n"Now we must have a talk," she said. "Allan has gone through Bruce\'s\r\naffairs, and there are still debts to be settled, it seems."\r\n\r\n"How much do they come to, Deborah?"\r\n\r\n"About five thousand dollars," she said. And for a moment neither spoke. "I\r\nwish I could help you out," she went on, "but I have nothing saved and\r\nneither has Allan. We\'ve both kept using our money downtown--except just\r\nenough for the trip abroad--and we\'ll need almost all of that to settle for\r\nthe funeral."\r\n\r\n"I can manage," Roger said, and again there was a silence.\r\n\r\n"Edith will have to come here to live," Deborah said presently. Her\r\nfather\'s heavy face grew stern.\r\n\r\n"I\'d thought of that," he answered. "But it will be hard on her,\r\nDeborah--"\r\n\r\n"I know it will--but I don\'t see anything else to be done." The deep quiet\r\nvoice of his daughter grew sweet with pity as she spoke. "At least we can\r\ntry to make it a little easier for her. You can take her up to the\r\nmountains and I can close her apartment. But of course she won\'t agree to\r\nit unless she knows how matters stand." Deborah waited a little. "Don\'t you\r\nthink you\'re the best one to tell her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Roger, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Then suppose we go to her. I\'m sleeping up there for the next few nights."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey found Edith in her living room. She had sent the nurse out, put the\r\nchildren to bed, and left alone with nothing to do she had sat facing her\r\nfirst night. Her light soft hair was disheveled, her pretty features pale\r\nand set. But the moment Roger entered he saw that she had herself in hand.\r\n\r\n"Well, father," she said steadily. "You\'d better tell me about our affairs.\r\n_My_ affairs," she corrected herself. When he had explained, she was silent\r\na moment, and then in a voice harsh, bitter, abrupt, "That will be hard on\r\nthe children," she said. On an impulse he started to take her hand, but she\r\ndrew a little away from him.\r\n\r\n"The children, my dear," he said huskily, "will be taken care of always."\r\n\r\n"Yes." And again she was silent. "I\'ve been thinking I\'d like to go up to\r\nthe mountains--right away," she continued.\r\n\r\n"Just our idea," he told her. "Deborah will arrange it at once."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good of Deborah," she replied. And after another pause: "But take\r\nher home with you--will you? I\'d rather not have her here to-night."\r\n\r\n"I think she\'d better stay, my dear."\r\n\r\n"All right." In a tone of weariness. "Madge Deering called me up to-night.\r\nShe\'s coming in town to-morrow, and she means to stay till I go."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad," he said approvingly. Madge had been a widow for years. Living\r\nout in Morristown with four daughters to bring up, she had determinedly\r\nfought her way and had not only regained her hold but had even grown in\r\nstrength and breadth since the death of her husband long ago. "I\'m glad,"\r\nhe said. "You and Madge--" he paused.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we\'ll have a good deal in common," Edith finished out his thought.\r\n"You look tired, dad. Hadn\'t you better go home now?" she suggested after a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Roger, rising. "Good-night, my child. Remember."\r\n\r\nIn the outer hallway he found Deborah with Laura. Laura had been here\r\nseveral times. She was getting Edith\'s mourning.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a love of a hat at Thurn\'s," she was saying softly, "if only we\r\ncan get her to wear it. It\'s just her type." And Laura drew an anxious\r\nbreath. "Anything," she added, "to escape that hideous heavy crepe."\r\n\r\nRoger slightly raised his brows. He noticed a faint delicious perfume that\r\nirritated him suddenly. But glancing again at his daughter, trim, fresh and\r\nso immaculate, the joy of life barely concealed in her eyes, he stopped and\r\ntalked and smiled at her, as Deborah was doing, enjoying her beauty and her\r\nyouth, her love and all her happiness. And though they spoke of her sister,\r\nshe knew they were thinking of herself, and that it was quite right they\r\nshould, for it gave them a little relief from their gloom. She was honestly\r\nsorry for Edith, but she was sorrier still for Bruce, who she knew had\r\nalways liked her more than he would have cared to say. She was sorrier for\r\nBruce because, while Edith had lost only her husband, Bruce had lost his\r\nvery life. And life meant so much to Laura, these days, the glowing,\r\ncoursing, vibrant life of her warm beautiful body. She was thinking of that\r\nas she stood in the hall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the evening, at home in his study, Roger heard a slight knock at the\r\ndoor. He looked up and saw John.\r\n\r\n"May I come in, Mr. Gale, for a minute?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my boy." John hobbled in.\r\n\r\n"Only a minute." His voice was embarrassed. "Just two or three things I\r\nthought of," he said. "The first was about your son-in-law. You see, I was\r\nhis stenographer--and while I was in his office--this morning helping\r\nDoctor Baird--I found a good deal I can do there still--about things no one\r\nremembers but me. So I\'ll stay there awhile, if it\'s all right. Only--" he\r\npaused--"without any pay. See what I mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see," said Roger. "And you\'d better stay--in that way if you like."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said John. "Then about his wife and family. You\'re to take them\r\nup to the mountains, I hear--and--well, before this happened you asked _me_\r\nup this summer. But I guess I\'d better not."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you\'d be in the way, my boy."\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather stay here, if you don\'t mind. When I\'m through in your\r\nson-in-law\'s office I thought I might go back to yours. I could send you\r\nyour mail every two or three days."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like that, John--it will be a great help."\r\n\r\n"All right, Mr. Gale." John stopped at the door. "And Miss Deborah," he\r\nventured. "Is she to get married just the same?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I think so--later on."\r\n\r\n"Good-night, sir."\r\n\r\nAnd John went out of the room.\r\n\r\nWhen _would_ Deborah be married? It came over Roger, when he was alone, how\r\nhis family had shifted its center. Deborah would have come here to live,\r\nto love and be happy, a mother perhaps, but now she must find a home of her\r\nown. In her place would come Edith with her children. All would center on\r\nher in her grief.\r\n\r\nAnd for no cause! Just a trick of chance, a street accident! And Roger grew\r\nbitter and rebelled. Bruce was not the one of the family to die. Bruce, so\r\nshrewd and vigorous, so vital, the practical man of affairs. Bruce had been\r\ngoing the pace that kills--yes, Roger had often thought of it. But that had\r\nnothing to do with this! If Bruce had died at fifty, say, as a result of\r\nthe life he had chosen, the fierce exhausting city which he had loved as a\r\nman will love drink, then at least there would have been some sense of\r\nfairness in it all! If the town had let him alone till his time! But to be\r\nknocked down by an automobile! The devilish irony of it! No\r\nreason--nothing! Just hideous luck!\r\n\r\nWell, life was like that. As for Edith and her children, he would be glad\r\nto have them here. Only, it would be different, the house would have to\r\nchange again. He was sorry, too, for Deborah. No wedding trip as she had\r\nplanned, no home awaiting her return.\r\n\r\nSo his mind went over his family.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly such thoughts fell away as trivial and of small account. For\r\nthese people would still be alive. And Bruce was dead, and Roger was old.\r\nSo he thought about Bruce and about himself, and all his children grew\r\nremote. "You will live on in our children\'s lives." Was there no other\r\nimmortality? The clock ticked on the mantle and beside it "The Thinker"\r\nbrooded down. And Roger looked up unafraid, but grim and gravely wondering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there was a rugged practical side to the character of Roger Gale, and\r\nthe next morning he was ashamed of the brooding thoughts which had come in\r\nthe night. He shook them off as morbid, and resolutely set himself to what\r\nlay close before him. There was work to be done on Bruce\'s affairs, and the\r\nwork was a decided relief. Madge Deering, in the meantime, had offered to\r\ngo with Edith and the children to the mountains and see them all well\r\nsettled there. And a little talk he had with Madge relieved his mind still\r\nfurther. What a recovery _she_ had made from the tragedy of years ago. How\r\nalert and wide-awake she seemed. If Edith could only grow like that.\r\n\r\nSoon after their departure, one night when he was dining alone, he had a\r\ncurious consciousness of the mingled presence of Edith and of Judith his\r\nwife. And this feeling grew so strong that several times he looked about in\r\na startled, questioning manner. All at once his eye was caught by an old\r\nmahogany sideboard. It was Edith\'s. It had been her mother\'s. Edith, when\r\nshe married, had wanted something from her old home. Well, now it was back\r\nin the family.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Edith\'s furniture, he learned from Deborah that night, had been\r\nstored in the top of the house.\r\n\r\n"Most of it," she told him, "Edith will probably want to use in fitting up\r\nthe children\'s rooms." With a twinge of foreboding, Roger felt the\r\napproaching change in his home.\r\n\r\n"When do you plan to be married?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"About the end of August. We couldn\'t very well till then, without hurting\r\npoor Edith a little, you see. You know how she feels about such things--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I guess you\'re right," he agreed.\r\n\r\nHow everything centered \'round Edith, he thought. To pay the debts which\r\nBruce had left would take all Roger had on hand; and from this time on his\r\nexpenses, with five growing children here, would be a fast increasing\r\ndrain. He would have to be careful and husband his strength, a thing he had\r\nalways hated to do.\r\n\r\nIn the next few weeks, he worked hard in his office. He cut down his\r\nsmoking, stayed home every evening and went to bed at ten o\'clock. He tried\r\nto shut Deborah out of his mind. As for Laura, he barely gave her a\r\nthought. She dropped in one evening to bid him good-bye, for this summer\r\nagain she was going abroad. She and her husband, she told him, were to\r\nmotor through the Balkans and down into Italy. Her father gruffly answered\r\nthat he hoped she would enjoy herself. It seemed infernally unfair that it\r\nshould not be Deborah who was sailing the next morning. But when he felt\r\nhimself growing annoyed, abruptly he put a check on himself. It was Edith\r\nhe must think of now.\r\n\r\nBut curiously it happened, in this narrowing of his attention, that while\r\nhe shut out two of his daughters, a mere outsider edged closer in.\r\n\r\nJohnny Geer was a great help. He was back in Roger\'s office, and with the\r\nsharp wits he had gained in his eighteen years of fighting for a chance to\r\nstay alive, now at Roger\'s elbow John was watching like a hawk for all the\r\nlittle ways and means of pushing up the business. What a will the lad had\r\nto down bodily ills, what vim in the way he tackled each job. His shrewd\r\nand cheery companionship was a distraction and relief. John was so funny\r\nsometimes.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Mr. Gale," he said, as Roger came into the office one day.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Johnny. How are you?" Roger replied.\r\n\r\n"Fine, thank you." And John went on with his work of opening the morning\'s\r\nmail. But a few minutes later he gave a cackling little laugh.\r\n\r\n"What\'s so funny?" Roger asked.\r\n\r\n"Fellers," was the answer. "Fellers. Human nature. Here\'s a letter from\r\nShifty Sam."\r\n\r\n"Who the devil is he? A friend of yours?"\r\n\r\n"No," said John, "he\'s a \'con man.\' He works about as mean a graft as any\r\nyou ever heard of. He reads the \'ads\' in the papers--see?--of servant girls\r\nwho\'re looking for work. He makes a specialty of cooks. Then he goes to\r\nwhere they live and talks of some nice family that wants a servant right\r\naway. He claims to be the butler, and he\'s dressed to look the part. \'There\r\nain\'t a minute to lose,\' he says. \'If you want a chawnce, my girl, come\r\nquick.\' He says \'chawnce\' like a butler--see? \'Pack your things,\' he tells\r\nher, \'and come right along with me.\' So she packs and hustles off with\r\nhim--Sam carrying her suit case. He puts her on a trolley and says, \'I\r\nguess I\'ll stay on the platform. I\'ve got a bit of a headache and the air\r\nwill do me good.\' So he stays out there with her suit case--and as soon as\r\nthe car gets into a crowd, Sam jumps and beats it with her clothes."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Roger dryly. "But what\'s he writing _you_ about?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it ain\'t me he\'s writing to--it\'s you," was John\'s serene reply. Roger\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n"What?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the boy in a cautious tone, vigilantly eyeing his chief, "you\r\nsee, a lot of these fellers like Sam have been in the papers lately.\r\nThey\'re being called a crime wave."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Sam is up for trial this week--and half the Irish cooks in town are\r\nwaiting \'round to testify. And Shifty seems to enjoy himself. His\r\npicture\'s in the papers--see? And he wants all the clippings. So he\r\nencloses a five dollar bill."\r\n\r\n"He does, eh--well, you write to Sam and send his money back to him!" There\r\nwas a little silence.\r\n\r\n"But look here," said John with keen regret. "We\'ve had quite a lot of\r\nthese letters this week."\r\n\r\nRoger wheeled and looked at him.\r\n\r\n"John," he demanded severely, "what game have you been up to here?"\r\n\r\n"No game at all," was the prompt retort. "Just getting a little business."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s a club downtown," said John, "where a lot of these petty\r\ncrooks hang out. I used to deliver papers there. And I went around one\r\nnight this month--"\r\n\r\n"_To drum up business?_"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir." Roger looked at him aghast.\r\n\r\n"John," he asked, in deep reproach, "do you expect this office to feed the\r\nvanity of thieves?"\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the vanity," John rejoined, "in being called a crime wave?" And\r\nseeing the sudden tremor of mirth which had appeared on Roger\'s face, "Look\r\nhere, Mr. Gale," he went eagerly on. "When every paper in the town is\r\ntelling these fellers where they belong--calling \'em crooks, degenerates,\r\nand preaching regular sermons right into their faces--why shouldn\'t we help\r\n\'em to read the stuff? How do we know it won\'t do \'em good? It\'s church to\r\n\'em, that\'s what it is--and business for this office. Nine of these guys\r\nhave sent in their money just in the last week or so--"\r\n\r\n"Look out, my boy," said Roger, with slow and solemn emphasis. "If you\r\naren\'t extremely careful you\'ll find yourself a millionaire."\r\n\r\n"But wait a minute, Mr. Gale--"\r\n\r\n"Not in this office," Roger said. "Send \'em back, every one of \'em!\r\nUnderstand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," was the meek reply. And with a little sigh of regret John\r\nturned his wits to other kinds and conditions of New Yorkers who might care\r\nto see themselves in print.\r\n\r\nAs they worked together day by day, Roger had occasional qualms over\r\nleaving John here in the hot town while he himself went up to the\r\nmountains. He even thought of writing to Edith that he was planning to\r\nbring John, too. But no, she wouldn\'t like it. So he did something else\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n"John," he said, one morning, "I\'m going to raise your salary to a hundred\r\ndollars a month." Instantly from the lad\'s bright eyes there shot a look of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Mr. Gale," was his hearty response.\r\n\r\n"And in the meantime, Johnny, I want you to take a good solid month off."\r\n\r\n"All right, sir, thank you," John replied. "But I guess it won\'t be quite a\r\nmonth. I don\'t feel as if I needed it."\r\n\r\nThe next day at the office he appeared resplendent in a brand-new suit of\r\nclothes, a summer homespun of light gray set off by a tie of flaming red.\r\nThere was nothing soft about that boy. No, Johnny knew how to look out for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAnd Roger went up to the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge met him at the station, as he had done a year before. But at once\r\nRoger noticed a difference. In the short time since his father\'s death\r\ncertain lines had come in the boy\'s freckled face, and they gave him a\r\nthoughtful, resolute look. George\'s voice was changing. One moment it was\r\nhigh and boyish, again a deep and manly bass. As he kept his eyes on the\r\nhorses and talked about his mother, his grandfather from time to time threw\r\ncurious side glances.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," George was saying, "mother\'s all right, she\'s doing fine. It was\r\npretty bad at first, though. She wouldn\'t let me sit up with her any--she\r\ntreated me like a regular kid. But any fellow with any sense could see how\r\nshe was feeling. She\'d get thinking of the accident." George stopped short\r\nand clamped his jaws. "You know, my dad did a wonderful thing," he\r\ncontinued presently. "Even when he was dying, and mother and I were there\r\nby his bed, he remembered how she\'d get thinking alone--all about the\r\naccident. You see he knew mother pretty darned well. So he told her to\r\nremember that he was the one to blame for it. If it hadn\'t been for him, he\r\nsaid, they would have gone home in the taxi. That\'s a pretty good point to\r\nkeep in her mind. Don\'t you think so?" he inquired. And Roger glanced\r\naffectionately into the anxious face by his side.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "it\'s a mighty good point. Did you think of it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," George replied. "I\'ve told it to her a good many times--that\r\nand two other points I thought of."\r\n\r\n"What are they, son?" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n"First," the boy said awkwardly, "about how good she was to him. And\r\nsecond, that she let him buy the new car before he died. He had such a lot\r\nof fun out of that car--"\r\n\r\nOn the last words the lad\'s changing voice went from an impressive bass to\r\na most undignified treble. He savagely scowled.\r\n\r\n"Those three points," he continued, in more careful measured tones, "were\r\nabout all I could think of. I had to use \'em over and over--on mother when\r\nthings got bad, I mean." A flush of embarrassment came on his face. "And\r\nhold her and kiss her," he muttered. Then he whipped his horses. "We\'ve had\r\nsome pretty bad times this month," he continued, loud and manfully. "You\r\nsee, mother isn\'t so young as she was. She\'s well on in her thirties." A\r\nglimmer of amusement appeared in Roger\'s heavy eyes. "But she don\'t cry\r\noften any more, and with you here we\'ll pull her through." He shot a quick\r\nlook at his grandfather. "Gee, but I\'m glad you\'re here!" he said.\r\n\r\n"So am I," said Roger. And with a little pressure of his hand on George\'s\r\nshoulder, "I guess you\'ve had about your share. Now tell me the news. How\r\nare things on the farm?"\r\n\r\nWith a breath of evident relief, the lad launched into the animal world.\r\nAnd soon he was talking eagerly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the next few days with his daughter Roger found that George was right.\r\nShe had been through the worst of it. But she still had her reactions, her\r\nspells of emptiness, bleak despair, her moods of fierce rebellion or of\r\nsudden self-reproach for not having given Bruce more while he lived. And in\r\nsuch hours her father tried to comfort her with poor success.\r\n\r\n"Remember, child, I\'m with you, and I know how it feels," he said. "I went\r\nthrough it all myself: When your mother died--"\r\n\r\n"But mother was so much older!" He looked at his daughter compassionately.\r\n\r\n"How old are you?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Thirty-six."\r\n\r\n"Your mother was thirty-nine," he replied. And at that Edith turned and\r\nstared at him, bewildered, shocked, brought face to face with a new and\r\nmomentous fact in her life.\r\n\r\n"Mother only my age when she died?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Roger gently, "only three years older." With a twinge of pain\r\nhe noticed two quite visible streaks of gray in his daughter\'s soft blonde\r\nhair. "And she felt as you do now--as though she were just starting out.\r\nAnd I felt the same way, my dear. If I\'m not mistaken, everyone does. You\r\nstill feel young--but the new generation is already growing up--and you can\r\nfeel yourself being pushed on. And it is hard--it is very hard." Clumsily\r\nhe took her hand. "Don\'t let yourself drop out," he said. "Be as your\r\nmother would have been if she had been left instead of me. Go straight on\r\nwith your children."\r\n\r\nTo this note he could feel her respond. And at first, as he felt what a\r\nfight she was making, Roger glorified her pluck. As he watched her with her\r\nchildren at table, smiling at their talk with an evident effort to enter\r\nin, and again with her baby snug in her lap while she read bedtime stories\r\nto Bob and little Tad at her side, he kept noticing the resemblance between\r\nhis daughter and his wife. How close were these two members of his family\r\ndrawing together now, one of them living, the other dead.\r\n\r\nBut later, as the weeks wore on, she began to plan for her children. She\r\nplanned precisely how to fit them all into the house in town, she planned\r\nthe hours for their meals, for their going alone or with the nurse or a\r\nmaid to their different private schools, to music lessons, to dancing\r\nschool and uptown to the park to play. She planned their fall clothes and\r\nshe planned their friends. And there came to her father occasional moods of\r\nanxiety. He remembered Bruce\'s grim remarks about those "simple" schools\r\nand clothes, the kind that always cost the most. And he began to realize\r\nwhat Bruce\'s existence must have been. For scarcely ever in their talks did\r\nEdith speak of anything outside of her family. Night after night, with a\r\ntensity born of her struggle with her grief, she talked about her children.\r\nAnd Roger was in Bruce\'s place, he was the one she planned with. At moments\r\nwith a vague dismay he glimpsed the life ahead in his home.\r\n\r\nGeorge was hard at work each day down by the broken dam at the mill. He had\r\nan idea he could patch it up, put the old water-wheel back into place and\r\nmake it run a dynamo, by which he could light the house and barn and run\r\nthe machines in the dairy. In his new r\xf4le as the man of his family, George\r\nwas planning out his career. He was wrestling with a book entitled "Our New\r\nMother Earth" and a journal called "The Modern Farm." And to Roger he\r\nconfided that he meant to be a farmer. He wanted to go in the autumn to the\r\nState Agricultural College. But when one day, very cautiously, Roger spoke\r\nto Edith of this, with a hard and jealous smile which quite transformed her\r\nfeatures, she said,\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know all about that, father dear. It\'s just a stage he\'s going\r\nthrough. And it\'s the same way with Elizabeth, too, and her crazy idea of\r\nbecoming a doctor. She took that from Allan Baird, and George took his from\r\nDeborah! They\'ll get over it soon enough--"\r\n\r\n"They won\'t get over it!" Roger cried. "Their dreams are parts of something\r\nnew! Something I\'m quite vague about--but some of it has come to stay!\r\nYou\'re losing all your chances--just as I did years ago! You\'ll never know\r\nyour children!"\r\n\r\nBut he uttered this cry to himself alone. Outwardly he only frowned. And\r\nEdith had gone on to say,\r\n\r\n"I do hope that Deborah won\'t come up this summer. She\'s been very good and\r\nkind, of course, and if she comes she\'ll be doing it entirely on my\r\naccount. But I don\'t want her here--I want her to marry, the sooner the\r\nbetter, and come to her senses--be happy, I mean. And I wish you would tell\r\nher so."\r\n\r\nWithin a few days after this Deborah wrote to her father that she was\r\ncoming the next week. He said nothing to Edith about it at first, he had\r\nWilliam saddled and went for a ride to try to determine what he should do.\r\nBut it was a ticklish business. For women were queer and touchy, and once\r\nmore he felt the working of those uncanny family ties.\r\n\r\n"Deborah," he reflected, "is coming up here because she feels it\'s selfish\r\nof her to stay away. If she marries at once, as she told me herself, she\r\nthinks Edith will be hurt. Edith won\'t be hurt--and if Deborah comes,\r\nthere\'ll be trouble every minute she stays. But can I tell her so? Not at\r\nall. I can\'t say, \'You\'re not wanted here.\' If I do, _she\'ll_ be hurt. Oh\r\nLord, these girls! And Deborah knows very well that if she does get married\r\nthis month, with Laura abroad and Edith up here and only me at the wedding,\r\nEdith will smile to herself and say, \'Now isn\'t that just like Deborah?\'"\r\n\r\nAs Roger slowly rode along a steep and winding mountain road, gloomily he\r\nreflected to what petty little troubles a family of women could descend, so\r\nsoon after death itself. And he lifted his eyes up to the hills and decided\r\nto leave this matter alone. If women would be women, let them settle their\r\nown affairs. Deborah was due to arrive on the following Friday evening. All\r\nright, let her come, he thought. She would soon see she was in the way, and\r\nthen in a little affectionate talk he would suggest that she marry right\r\noff and have a decent honeymoon before the school year opened.\r\n\r\nSo he dismissed it from his mind. And as he listened in the dusk to the\r\nnumberless murmuring voices of living creatures large and small which rose\r\nout of the valley, and as from high above him the serenity of the mountains\r\nthere towering over thousands of years stole into his spirit, Roger had a\r\nlarge quieting sense of something high and powerful looking down upon the\r\nearth, a sense of all humanity honeycombed with millions upon millions of\r\nsmall sorrows, absorbing joys and hopes and fears, and in spite of them all\r\nthe Great Life sweeping on, with no Great Death to check its course, no\r\nimmense catastrophe, all these little troubles like mere tiny specks of\r\nfoam upon the surface of the tide.\r\n\r\nDeborah\'s visit, the following week, was as he had expected. Within an hour\r\nafter her coming he could feel the tension grow. Deborah herself was tense,\r\nboth from the work she had left in New York where she was soon to have five\r\nschools, and from the thought of her marriage, only a few weeks ahead. She\r\nsaid nothing about it, however, until as a sisterly duty Edith tried to\r\ndraw her out by showing an interest in her plans. But the cloud of Bruce\'s\r\ndeath was there, and Deborah shunned the topic. She tried to talk of the\r\nchildren instead. But Edith at once was on the defensive, vigilant for\r\ntrouble, and as she unfolded her winter plans she grew distinctly brief and\r\ncurt.\r\n\r\n"If Deborah doesn\'t see it now, she\'s a fool," her father told himself.\r\n"I\'ll just wait a few days more, and then we\'ll have that little talk."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had rained so hard for the past two days that no one had gone to the\r\nvillage, which was nearly three miles from the farm. But when the storm was\r\nover at last, George and Elizabeth tramped down and came back at dusk with\r\na bag full of mail. Their clothes were mud-bespattered and they hurried\r\nupstairs to change before supper, while Roger settled back in his chair and\r\nspread open his New York paper. It was July 30, 1914.\r\n\r\nFrom a habit grown out of thirty odd years of business life, Roger read his\r\npaper in a fashion of his own. By instinct his eye swept the page for news\r\ndealing with individual men, for it was upon people\'s names in print that\r\nhe had made his living. And so when he looked at this strange front page it\r\ngave him a swift twinge of alarm. For the news was not of men but of\r\nnations. Austria was massing her troops along the Serbian frontier, and\r\nGermany, Italy, Russia, France and even England, all were in a turmoil,\r\nwith panics in their capitals, money markets going wild.\r\n\r\nEdith came down, in her neat black dress with its narrow white collar,\r\nready for supper. She glanced at her father.\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Look at this." And he tossed her a paper.\r\n\r\n"Oh-h-h," she murmured softly. "Oh, how frightful that would be." And she\r\nread on with lips compressed. But soon there came from a room upstairs the\r\nsudden cry of one of her children, followed by a shrill wail of distress.\r\nAnd dropping the paper, she hurried away.\r\n\r\nRoger continued his reading.\r\n\r\nDeborah came. She saw the paper Edith had dropped, picked it up and sat\r\ndown to read, and there were a few moments of absolute silence. Then Roger\r\nheard a quivering breath, and glancing up he saw Deborah\'s eyes, intent and\r\nstartled, moving down the columns of print in a swift, uncomprehending way.\r\n\r\n"Pretty serious business," he growled.\r\n\r\n"It can\'t happen!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd they resumed their reading.\r\n\r\nIn the next three days, as they read the news, they felt war like a\r\nwhirlpool sucking in all their powers to think or feel, felt their own\r\nsmall personal plans whirled about like leaves in a storm. And while their\r\nminds--at first dazed and stunned by the thought of such appalling armies,\r\nbattles, death and desolation--slowly cleared and they strove to think, and\r\nRoger thought of business shivered to atoms in every land, and Deborah\r\nthought of schools by thousands all over Europe closing down, in cities and\r\nin villages, in valleys and on mountain sides, of homes in panic\r\neverywhere, of all ideals of brotherhood shaken, bending, tottering--war\r\nbroke out in Europe.\r\n\r\n"What is this going to mean to me?"\r\n\r\nMillions of people were asking that. And so did Roger and Deborah. The same\r\nnight they left for New York, while Edith with a sigh of relief settled\r\nback into her family.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning at his office Roger found John waiting with misery stamped\r\non his face. John had paid small heed to war. Barely stopping for sleep in\r\nthe last two days he had gone through scores and hundreds of papers,\r\nangrily skipping all those names of kings and emperors and czars, and\r\nsearching instead for American names, names of patrons--business! Gone!\r\nEach hour he had been opening mail and piling up letters cancelling\r\ncontracts, ordering service discontinued.\r\n\r\nRoger sat down at his desk. As he worked and figured and dictated letters,\r\nglancing into the outer rooms he saw the long rows of girls at tables\r\nobviously trying to pretend that there was work for them to do. He felt\r\nthem anxiously watching him--as in other offices everywhere millions of\r\nother employees kept furtively glancing at their chiefs.\r\n\r\n"War," he thought. "Shall I close _down?_" He shrank from what it would\r\nmean to those girls. "Business will pick up again soon. A few\r\ndays--weeks--that\'s all I need."\r\n\r\nAnd he went to his bank. No credit there. He tried other sources, all he\r\ncould think of, racking his brains as he went about town, but still he\r\ncould not raise a loan. Finally he went to the firm which had once held a\r\nmortgage on his house. The chief partner had been close to Bruce, an old\r\ncollege friend. And when even this friend refused him aid, "It\'s a question\r\nof Bruce\'s children," Roger muttered, reddening. He felt like a beggar, but\r\nhe was getting desperate. The younger man had looked away and was nervously\r\ntapping his desk with his pen.\r\n\r\n"Bad as that, eh," he answered. "Then I guess it\'s got to be done." He\r\nlooked anxiously up at Roger, who just at that moment appeared very old.\r\n"Don\'t worry, Mr. Gale," he said. "Somehow or other we\'ll carry you\r\nthrough."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir." Roger rose heavily, feeling weak, and took his departure.\r\n"This is war," he told himself, "and I\'ve got to look after my own."\r\n\r\nBut he had a sensation almost of guilt, as upon his return to his office he\r\nsaw those suddenly watchful faces. He walked past them and went into his\r\nroom, and again he searched for ways and means. He tried to see his\r\nbusiness as it would be that autumn, to see the city, the nation, the world\r\nas it would be in the months ahead. Repeatedly he fought off his fears.\r\nBut slowly and inexorably the sense of his helplessness grew clear.\r\n\r\n"No, I must shut down," he thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn his way home that evening, in a crush at a turbulent corner he saw a big\r\ntruck jam into a taxi, and with a throb of rebellion he thought of his\r\nson-in-law who was dead. Just the turn of a hair and Bruce might have lived\r\nand been here to look after the children! At the prospect of the crisis,\r\nthe strain he saw before him, Roger again felt weak and old. He shook off\r\nhis dread and strode angrily on.\r\n\r\nIn his house, the rooms downstairs were still dismantled for the summer.\r\nThere was emptiness and silence but no serenity in them now, only the quiet\r\nbefore the storm which he could feel from far and near was gathering about\r\nhis home. He heard Deborah on the floor above, and went up and found her\r\nmaking his bed, for the chambermaid had not yet come. Her voice was a\r\nlittle unnatural.\r\n\r\n"It has been a hard day, hasn\'t it. I\'ve got your bath-room ready," she\r\nsaid. "Don\'t you want a nice cool bath? Supper will be ready soon."\r\n\r\nWhen, a half hour later, somewhat refreshed, Roger came down to the table,\r\nhe noticed it was set for two.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t Allan coming?" he asked. Her mobile features tightened.\r\n\r\n"Not till later," she replied.\r\n\r\nThey talked little and the meal was short. But afterwards, on the wooden\r\nporch, Deborah turned to her father,\r\n\r\n"Now tell me about your office," she said.\r\n\r\n"There\'s not enough business to pay the rent."\r\n\r\n"That won\'t last--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure."\r\n\r\n"I am," she said determinedly. Her father slowly turned his head.\r\n\r\n"Are you, with this war?" he asked. Her eyes met his and moved away in a\r\nbaffled, searching manner. "She has troubles of her own," he thought.\r\n\r\n"How much can we run the house on, Deborah?" he asked her. At first she did\r\nnot answer. "What was it--about six thousand last year?"\r\n\r\n"I think so," she said restlessly. "We can cut down on that, of course--"\r\n\r\n"With Edith and the children here?"\r\n\r\n"Edith will have to manage it! There are others to be thought of!"\r\n\r\n"The children in your schools, you mean."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered with a frown. "It will be a bad year for the tenements.\r\nBut please go on and tell me. What have you thought of doing?"\r\n\r\n"Mortgage the house again," he replied. "It hasn\'t been easy, for money is\r\ntight, but I think I\'ll be able to get enough to just about carry us\r\nthrough the year. At home, I mean," he added.\r\n\r\n"And the office?"\r\n\r\n"Shut down," he said. She turned on him fiercely.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t do that!"\r\n\r\n"What else can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Turn all those girls away?" she cried. At her tone his look grew troubled.\r\n\r\n"How can I help myself, Deborah? If I kept open it would cost me over five\r\nhundred a week to run. Have I five hundred dollars a week to lose?"\r\n\r\n"But I tell you it won\'t last!" she cried, and again the baffled, driven\r\nexpression swept over her expressive face. "Can\'t you see this is only a\r\npanic--and keep going somehow? Can\'t you see what it means to the\r\ntenements? Hundreds of thousands are out of work! They\'re being turned off\r\nevery day, every hour--employers all over are losing their heads! And City\r\nHall is as mad as the rest! They\'ve decided already down there to\r\nretrench!"\r\n\r\nHe turned with a quick jerk of his head:\r\n\r\n"Are they cutting you down?" She set her teeth:\r\n\r\n"Yes, they are. But the work in my schools is going on--every bit of it\r\nis--for every child! I\'m going to find a way," she said. And he felt a\r\nthrill of compassion.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to hear it," he muttered.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t be." She paused a moment, smiled and went on in a quieter\r\nvoice: "Don\'t think I\'m blind--I\'m sensible--I see you can\'t lose five\r\nhundred a week. But why not try what other employers, quite a few, have\r\ndecided to do? Call your people together, explain how it is, and ask them\r\nto choose a committee to help you find which ones need jobs the most. Keep\r\nall you can--on part time, of course--but at least pay them something,\r\ncarry them through. You\'ll lose money by it, I haven\'t a doubt. But you\'ve\r\nalready found you can mortgage the house, and remember besides that I shall\r\nbe here. I\'m not going to marry now"--her father looked at her\r\nquickly--"and of course I\'ll expect to do my share toward meeting the\r\nexpenses. Moreover, I know we can cut down."\r\n\r\n"Retrench," said Roger grimly. "Turn off the servants instead of the\r\nclerks."\r\n\r\n"No, only one of them, Martha upstairs--and she is to be married. We\'ll\r\nkeep the cook and the waitress. Edith will have to give up her nurse--and\r\nit will be hard on her, of course--but she\'ll have to realize this is war,"\r\nDeborah said sharply. "Besides," she urged, "it\'s not going to last.\r\nBusiness everywhere will pick up--in a few weeks or months at most. The war\r\n_can\'t_ go on--it\'s too horribly big!" She broke off and anxiously looked\r\nat him. Her father was still frowning.\r\n\r\n"I\'m asking you to risk a good deal," she continued, her voice intense and\r\nlow. "But somehow, dearie, I always feel that this old house of ours is\r\nstrong. It can _stand_ a good deal. We can all of us stand so much, as soon\r\nas we know we have to." The lines of her wide sensitive mouth tightened\r\nfirmly once again. "It\'s all so vague and uncertain, I know. But one thing\r\nat least is sure. This is no time for people with money--no matter how\r\nlittle--to shut themselves up in their own little houses and let the rest\r\nstarve or beg or steal. This is the time to do our share."\r\n\r\nAnd she waited. But he made no reply.\r\n\r\n"Every nation at war is doing it, dad--become like one big family--with\r\neveryone helping, doing his share. Must a nation be at war to do that?\r\nCan\'t we be brothers without the guns? Can\'t you see that we\'re all of us\r\nstunned, and trying to see what war will mean to all the children in the\r\nworld? And while we\'re groping, groping, can\'t we give each other a hand?"\r\n\r\nStill he sat motionless there in the dark. At last he stirred heavily in\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\n"I guess you\'re right," he told her. "At least I\'ll think it over--and try\r\nto work out something along the lines you spoke of."\r\n\r\nAgain there was a silence. Then his daughter turned to him with a little\r\ndeprecating smile.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll forgive my--preaching to you, dad?"\r\n\r\n"No preaching," he said gruffly. "Just ordinary common sense."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA little later Allan came in, and Roger soon left them and went to bed.\r\nAlone with Baird she was silent a moment.\r\n\r\n"Well? Have you thought it over?" she asked. "Wasn\'t I right in what I\r\nsaid?" At the anxious ring in her low clear voice, leaning over he took her\r\nhand; and he felt it hot and trembling as it quickly closed on his. He\r\nstroked it slowly, soothingly. In the semi-darkness he seemed doubly tall\r\nand powerful.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m sure you were right," he said.\r\n\r\n"Spring at the latest--I\'ll marry you then--"\r\n\r\nHer eyes were intently fixed on his.\r\n\r\n"Come here!" she whispered sharply, and Baird bent over and held her\r\ntight. "Tighter!" she whispered. "Tighter!... There!... I said, spring at\r\nthe latest! I can\'t lose you, Allan--now--"\r\n\r\nShe suddenly quivered as though from fatigue.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to watch you close down there," he said in a moment, huskily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nRoger saw little of Deborah in the weeks that followed. She was gathering\r\nher forces for the long struggle she saw ahead. And his own worries filled\r\nhis mind. On his house he succeeded in borrowing five thousand dollars at\r\nten per cent, and in his office he worked out a scheme along the lines of\r\nDeborah\'s plan. At first it was only a struggle to save the remnants of\r\nwhat was left. Later the tide began to turn, new business came into the\r\noffice again. But only a little, and then it stopped. Hard times were here\r\nfor the winter.\r\n\r\nSoon Edith would come with the children. He wondered how sensible she would\r\nbe. It was going to mean a daily fight to make ends meet, he told himself,\r\nand guiltily he decided not to let his daughter know how matters stood in\r\nhis office. Take care of your own flesh and blood, and then be generous as\r\nyou please--that had always been his way. And now Deborah had upset it by\r\nher emotional appeal. "How dramatic she is at times!" he reflected in\r\nannoyance. "Just lets herself out and enjoys herself!" He grew angry at her\r\ninterference, and more than once he resolved to shut down. But back in the\r\noffice, before those watchful faces, still again he would put it off.\r\n\r\n"Wait a little. We\'ll see," he thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, in this interplay, these shifting lights and shadows which\r\nplayed upon the history of the life of Roger\'s home, there came to him a\r\ndiversion from an unexpected source. Laura and Harold returned from abroad.\r\nSoon after landing they came to the house, and talking fast and eagerly\r\nthey told how they had eluded the war.\r\n\r\nFor them it had been a glorious game. In Venice in early August, Harold\r\nhad seen a chance for a big stroke of business. He had a friend who lived\r\nin Rome, an Italian close to his government. At once they had joined\r\nforces, worked day and night, pulled wires, used money judiciously here and\r\nthere, and so had secured large orders for munitions from the U.S.A. Then\r\nto get back to God\'s country! There came the hitch, they were too late.\r\nNaples, Genoa, and Milan, all were filled with tourist mobs. They took a\r\ntrain for Paris, and reaching the city just a week before the end of the\r\nGerman drive they found it worse than Italy. But there Hal had a special\r\npull--and by the use of those wits of his, not to be downed by refusals, he\r\ngot passage at last for Laura, himself and his new Italian partner. At\r\nmidnight, making their way across the panic-stricken city, and at the\r\nstation struggling through a wild and half crazed multitude of men and\r\nwomen and children, they boarded a train and went rushing westward right\r\nalong the edge of the storm. To the north the Germans were so close that\r\nLaura was sure she could hear the big guns. The train kept stopping to take\r\non troops. At dawn some twenty wounded men came crowding into their very\r\ncar, bloody and dirty, pale and worn, but gaily smiling at the pain, and\r\nsaying, "\xc7a n\'fait rien, madame." Later Harold opened his flask for some\r\nsplendid Breton soldier boys just going into action. And they stood up with\r\nflashing eyes and shouted out the Marseillaise, while Laura shivered and\r\nthrilled with delight.\r\n\r\n"I nearly kissed them all!" she cried.\r\n\r\nRoger greatly enjoyed the evening. He had heard so much of the horrors of\r\nwar. Here was something different, something bright and vibrant with youth\r\nand adventure! Here at last was the thrill of war, the part he had always\r\nread about!\r\n\r\nHe glanced now and then at Deborah and was annoyed by what he saw. For\r\nalthough she said nothing and forced a smile, he could easily tell by the\r\nset of her lips that Deborah thoroughly disapproved. All right, that was\r\nher way, he thought. But this was Laura\'s way, shedding the gloom and the\r\ntragic side as a duck will shed water off its back, a duck with bright new\r\nplumage fresh from the shops of the Rue de la Paix and taking some pleasure\r\nout of life! What an ardent gleaming beauty she was, he thought as he\r\nwatched this daughter of his. And underneath his enjoyment, too, though\r\nRoger would not have admitted it, was a sense of relief in the news that at\r\nleast one man in the family was growing rich instead of poor. Already Hal\r\nand his partner--a fascinating creature according to Laura\'s\r\ndescription--were fast equipping shrapnel mills. Plainly they expected a\r\ntremendous rush of business. And no matter how you felt about war, the word\r\n"profits" at least had a pleasant sound.\r\n\r\n"How has the war hit you, sir?" Harold asked his father-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Oh, so-so, I\'ll get on, my boy," was Roger\'s quiet answer. For Harold was\r\nnot quite the kind he would ever like to ask for aid. Still, if the worst\r\ncame to the worst, he would have someone to turn to.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLong after they had left the house, he kept thinking over all they had\r\nsaid. What an amazing time they had had, the two young scalawags.\r\n\r\nDeborah was still in the room. As she sat working at her desk, her back was\r\nturned and she did not speak. But little by little her father\'s mood\r\nchanged. Of course she was right, he admitted. For now they were gone, the\r\nspell they had cast was losing a part of its glamor. Yes, their talk had\r\nbeen pretty raw. Sheer unthinking selfishness, a bold rush for plunder and\r\na dash to get away, trampling over people half crazed, women and children\r\nin panicky crowds, and leaving behind them, so to speak, Laura\'s joyous\r\nrippling laugh over their own success in the game. Yes, there was no\r\ndenying the fact that Hal was rushing headlong into a savage dangerous\r\ngame, a scramble and a gamble, with adventurers from all over Europe\r\ngathering here and making a little world of their own. He would work and\r\nlive at a feverish pitch, and Laura would go it as hard as he. Roger\r\nthought he could see their winter ahead. How they would pile up money and\r\nspend!\r\n\r\nAll at once, as though some figure silent and invisible were standing close\r\nbeside him, from far back in his childhood a memory flashed into his mind\r\nof a keen and clear October night, when Roger, a little shaver of nine, had\r\nstood with his mother in front of the farmhouse and listened to the faint\r\nsharp roll of a single drum far down in the valley. And his mother\'s grip\r\nhad hurt his hand, and a lump had risen in his throat--as Dan, his oldest\r\nbrother, had marched away with his company of New Hampshire mountain boys.\r\n"We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more." Dan had been\r\nkilled at Shiloh.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be like that now in France. No, he did not like the look which\r\nhe had seen on Laura\'s face as she had talked about the war and the fat\r\nprofits to be made. Was this all we Yankees had to say to the people over\r\nin Europe?\r\n\r\nFrowning and glancing at Deborah\'s back, he saw that she was tired. It was\r\nnearly midnight, but still she kept working doggedly on, moving her\r\nshoulder muscles at times as though to shake off aches and pains, then\r\nbending again to her labor, her fight against such heavy odds in the winter\r\njust beginning for those children in the tenements. He recalled a fragment\r\nof the appeal she had made to him only the month before:\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you see that we\'re all of us stunned, and trying to see what war\r\nwill mean to all the children in the world? And while we\'re groping,\r\ngroping, can\'t we give each other a hand?"\r\n\r\nAnd as he looked at his daughter, she made him think of her grandmother,\r\nas she had so often done before. For Deborah, too, was a pioneer. She, too,\r\nhad lived in the wilderness. Clearing roads through jungles? Yes. And\r\nfreeing slaves of ignorance and building a nation of new men. And now she\r\nwas doggedly fighting to save what she had builded--not from the raids of\r\nthe Indians but from the ravages of this war which was sweeping\r\ncivilization aside. With her school behind her, so to speak, she stood\r\nfacing this great enemy with stern and angry, steady eyes. Her pioneer\r\ngrandmother come to life.\r\n\r\nSo, with the deep craving which was a part of his inmost self, Roger tried\r\nto bind together what was old and what was new. But his thoughts grew vague\r\nand drifting. He realized how weary he was, and said good-night and went to\r\nbed. There, just before he fell asleep, again he had a feeling of relief at\r\nthe knowledge that one at least in the family was to be rich this year.\r\nWith a guilty sensation he shook off the thought, and within a few moments\r\nafter that his harsh regular breathing was heard in the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only a few days later that Edith arrived with her children.\r\n\r\nRoger met her at the train at eight o\'clock in the evening. The fast\r\nmountain express of the summer had been taken off some time before, so\r\nEdith had had to be up at dawn and to change cars several times on the\r\ntrip. "She\'ll be worn out," he thought as he waited. The train was late. As\r\nhe walked about the new station, that monstrous sparkling hive of travel\r\nwith its huge halls and passageways, its little village of shops\r\nunderground and its bewildering levels for trains, he remembered the\r\ninterest Bruce had shown in watching this immense puzzle worked out, the\r\nday and night labor year after year without the stopping of a train, this\r\nmighty symbol of the times, of all the glorious power and speed in an age\r\nthat had been as the breath to his nostrils. How Bruce had loved the city!\r\nAs Roger paced slowly back and forth with his hands clasped behind his\r\nback, there came over his heavy visage a look of affection and regret which\r\nmade even New Yorkers glance at him as they went nervously bustling by.\r\nFrom time to time he smiled to himself. "The Catskills will be Central\r\nPark! All this city needs is speed!"\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he remembered that Bruce had always been here before to meet\r\nhis wife and children, and that Edith on her approaching train must be\r\ndreading her arrival. And when at last the train rolled in, and he spied\r\nher shapely little head in the on-coming throng of travellers, Roger saw by\r\nher set steady smile and the strained expression on her face that he had\r\nguessed right. With a quick surge of compassion he pressed forward, kissed\r\nher awkwardly, squeezed her arm, then hastily greeted the children and\r\nhurried away to see to the trunks. That much of it was over. And to his\r\nrelief, when they reached the house, Edith busied herself at once in\r\nhelping the nurse put the children to bed. Later he came up and told her\r\nthat he had had a light supper prepared.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, dear," she answered, "it was so thoughtful in you. But I\'m too\r\ntired to eat anything." And then with a little assuring smile, "I\'ll be all\r\nright--I\'m going to bed."\r\n\r\n"Good-night, child, get a fine long sleep."\r\n\r\nAnd Roger went down to his study, feeling they had made a good start.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"What has become of Martha?" Edith asked her father at breakfast the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n"She left last month to be married," he said.\r\n\r\n"And Deborah hasn\'t replaced her yet?" In her voice was such a readiness\r\nfor hostility toward her sister, that Roger shot an uneasy glance from\r\nunder his thick grayish brows.\r\n\r\n"Has Deborah left the house?" he asked, to gain time for his answer.\r\nEdith\'s small lip slightly curled.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, long ago," she replied. "She had just a moment to see the\r\nchildren and then she had to be off to school--to her office, I mean. With\r\nso many schools on her hands these days, I don\'t wonder she hasn\'t had time\r\nfor the servants."\r\n\r\n"No, no, you\'re mistaken," he said. "That isn\'t the trouble, it\'s not her\r\nfault. In fact it was all my idea."\r\n\r\n"_Your_ idea," she retorted, in an amused affectionate tone. And Roger\r\ngrimly gathered himself. It would he extremely difficult breaking his\r\nunpleasant news.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he answered. "You see this damnable war abroad has hit me in my\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"Oh, father! How?" she asked him. In an instant she was all alert. "You\r\ndon\'t mean seriously?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do," he answered, and he began to tell her why. But she soon grew\r\nimpatient. Business details meant nothing to Edith. "I see," she kept\r\nsaying, "yes, yes, I see." She wanted him to come to the point.\r\n\r\n"So I\'ve had to mortgage the house," he concluded. "And for very little\r\nmoney, my dear. And a good deal of that--" he cleared his throat--"had to\r\ngo back into the business."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Edith mechanically. Her mind was already far away, roving\r\nover her plans for the children. For in Roger\'s look of suspense she\r\nplainly read that other plans had been made for them in her absence.\r\n"Deborah\'s in this!" flashed through her mind. "Tell me what it will mean,"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you\'ll have to try to do without your nurse for a while."\r\n\r\n"Let Hannah go? Oh, father!" And Edith flushed with quick dismay. "How can\r\nI, dad? Five children--five! And two of them so little they can\'t even\r\ndress themselves alone! And there are all their meals--their baths--and the\r\nolder ones going uptown to school! I can\'t let them go way uptown on the\r\n\'bus or the trolley without a maid--"\r\n\r\n"But, Edith!" he interrupted, his face contracting with distress. "Don\'t\r\nyou see that they can\'t go to school?" She turned on him. "Uptown, I mean,\r\nto those expensive private schools."\r\n\r\n"Father!" she demanded. "Do you mean you want my children to go to common\r\npublic schools?" There was rage and amazement upon her pretty countenance,\r\nand with it an instant certainty too. Yes, this was Deborah\'s planning! But\r\nRoger thought that Edith\'s look was all directed at himself. And for the\r\nfirst time in his life he felt the shame and humility of the male provider\r\nno longer able to provide. He reddened and looked down at his plate.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t understand," he said. "I\'m strapped, my child--I can\'t help\r\nit--I\'m poor."\r\n\r\n"Oh. Oh, dad. I\'m sorry." He glanced up at his daughter and saw tears\r\nwelling in her eyes. How utterly miserable both of them were.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the war," he said harshly and proudly. This made a difference to his\r\npride, but not to his daughter\'s anxiety. She was not interested in the\r\nwar, or in any other cause of the abyss she was facing. She strove to think\r\nclearly what to do. But no, she must do her thinking alone. With a sudden\r\nquiet she rose from the table, went around to her father\'s chair and kissed\r\nhim very gently.\r\n\r\n"All right, dear--I see it all now--and I promise I\'ll try my best," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a brave little woman," he replied.\r\n\r\nBut after she had gone, he reflected. Why had he called her a brave little\r\nwoman? Why had it all been so intense, the talk upon so heroic a plane? It\r\nwould be hard on Edith, of course; but others were doing it, weren\'t they?\r\nThink of the women in Europe these days! After all, she\'d be very\r\ncomfortable here, and perhaps by Christmas times would change.\r\n\r\nHe shook off these petty troubles and went to his office for the day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs she busied herself unpacking the trunks, Edith strove to readjust her\r\nplans. By noon her head was throbbing, but she took little notice of that.\r\nShe had a talk with Hannah, the devoted Irish girl who had been with her\r\never since George was born. It was difficult, it was brutal. It was almost\r\nas though in Edith\'s family there had been two mothers, and one was sending\r\nthe other away.\r\n\r\n"There, there, poor child," Edith comforted her, "I\'ll find you another\r\nnice family soon where you can stay till I take you back. Don\'t you see it\r\nwill not be for long?" And Hannah brightened a little.\r\n\r\n"But how in the wide wurrld," she asked, "will you ever do for the\r\nchildren, me gone?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll manage," said Edith cheerfully. And that afternoon she began at\r\nonce to rearrange her whole intricate schedule, with Hannah and school both\r\nomitted, to fit her children into the house. But instead of this, as the\r\ndays wore on, nerve-racking days of worry and toil, sternly and quite\r\nunconsciously she fitted the house to her children. And nobody made her\r\naware of the fact. All summer long in the mountains, everyone by tacit\r\nconsent had made way for her, had deferred to her grief in the little\r\nthings that make up the everyday life in a home. And to this precedent once\r\nestablished Edith now clung unawares.\r\n\r\nHer new day gave her small time to think. It began at five in the morning,\r\nwhen Roger was awakened by the gleeful cries of the two wee boys who slept\r\nwith their mother in the next room, the room which had been Deborah\'s. And\r\nEdith was busy from that time on. First came the washing and dressing and\r\nbreakfast, which was a merry, boisterous meal. Then the baby was taken out\r\nto his carriage on the porch at the back of the house. And after that, in\r\nher father\'s study from which he had fled with his morning cigar, for two\r\nhours Edith held school for her children, trying her best to be patient and\r\nclear, with text-books she had purchased from their former schools uptown.\r\nFor two severe hours, shutting the world all out of her head, she tried to\r\nteach them about it. At eleven, their nerves on edge like her own, she sent\r\nthem outdoors "to play," intrusting the small ones to Betsy and George, who\r\ntook them to Washington Square nearby with strict injunctions to keep them\r\naway from all other children. No doubt there were "nice" children there,\r\nbut she herself could not be along to distinguish the "nice" from the\r\n"common"--for until one o\'clock she was busy at home, bathing the baby and\r\nmaking the beds, and then hurrying to the kitchen to pasteurize the baby\'s\r\nmilk and keep a vigilant oversight on the cooking of the midday meal. And\r\nthe old cook\'s growing resentment made it far from easy.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon, thank heaven, came their naps. And all afternoon, while\r\nagain they went out, Edith would look over their wardrobes, mend and alter\r\nand patch and contrive how to make last winter\'s clothes look new. At times\r\nshe would drop her work in her lap and stare wretchedly before her. This\r\nwas what she had never known; this was what made life around her grim and\r\nhard, relentless, frightening; this was what it was to be poor. How it\r\nchanged the whole city of New York. Behind it, the sinister cause of it\r\nall, she thought confusedly now and then of the Great Death across the sea,\r\nof the armies, smoking battle-fields, the shrieks of the dying, the\r\nvillages blazing, the women and children flying away. But never for more\r\nthan a moment. The war was so remote and dim. And soon she would turn back\r\nagain to her own beloved children, whose lives, so full of happiness, so\r\nrich in promise hitherto, were now so cramped and thwarted. Each day was\r\nharder than the last. It was becoming unbearable!\r\n\r\nNo, they must go back to school. But how to manage it? How? How? It would\r\ncost eight hundred dollars, and this would take nearly all the money she\r\nwould be able to secure by the sale of her few possessions. And then what?\r\nWhat of sickness, and the other contingencies which still lay ahead of her?\r\nHow old her father seemed, these days! In his heavy shock of hair the\r\nflecks of white had doubled in size, were merging one into the other, and\r\nhis tall, stooping, massive frame had lost its look of ruggedness. Suppose,\r\nsuppose.... Her breath came fast. Was his life insured, she wondered.\r\n\r\nOn such afternoons, in the upstairs room as the dusk crept in and\r\ndeepened, she would bend close to her sewing--planning, planning, planning.\r\nAt last she would hear the children trooping merrily into the house. And\r\nmaking a very real effort, which at times was in truth heroic, to smile,\r\nshe would rise and light the gas, would welcome them gaily and join in\r\ntheir chatter and bustle about on the countless tasks of washing them,\r\ngetting their suppers, undressing the small ones and hearing their prayers.\r\nWith smiling good-night kisses she would tuck her two babies into their\r\ncribs. Afterward, just for a moment or two, she would linger under the gas\r\njet, her face still smiling, for a last look. A last good-night. Then\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nDarkness settling over her spirit, together with loneliness and fatigue.\r\nShe would go into Betsy\'s room and throw herself dressed on her daughter\'s\r\nbed, and a dull complete indifference to everything under the moon and the\r\nstars would creep from her body up into her mind. At times she would try to\r\nfight it off. To-night at dinner she must not be what she knew she had been\r\nthe night before, a wet blanket upon all the talk. But if they only knew\r\nhow hard it was--what a perfect--hell it was! Her breath coming faster, she\r\nwould dig her nails into the palms of her hands. One night she noticed and\r\nlooked at her hand, and saw the skin was actually cut and a little blood\r\nwas appearing. She had read of women doing this, but she had never done it\r\nbefore--not even when her babies were born. She had gripped Bruce\'s hand\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nRoger found her like that one evening. He heard what he thought was a sob\r\nfrom the room, for she had forgotten to close the door. He came into the\r\ndoorway but drew back, and closed the door with barely a sound. Frowning\r\nand irresolute, he stood for a moment in the hall, then turned and went\r\ninto his room. Soon he heard Deborah enter the house and come slowly up the\r\nstairs. She too had had a hard day, he recalled, a day all filled with\r\nturbulence, with problems and with vexing toil, in her enormous family. And\r\nhe felt he could not blame her for not being of more help at home. Still,\r\nhe had been disappointed of late in her manner toward her sister. He had\r\nhoped she would draw closer to Edith, now that again they were living\r\ntogether in their old home where they had been born. But no, it had worked\r\njust the opposite way. They were getting upon each other\'s nerves. Why\r\ncouldn\'t she make overtures, small kindly proffers of help and advice and\r\nsympathy, the womanly things?\r\n\r\nFrom his room he heard her knock softly at the same door he had closed. And\r\nhe heard her low clear voice:\r\n\r\n"Are you there, Edith dear?" He listened a moment intently, but he could\r\nnot hear the reply. Then Deborah said, "Oh, you poor thing. I\'m awfully\r\nsorry. Edith--don\'t bother to come downstairs--let me bring you up your\r\nsupper." A pause. "I wish you would. I\'d love to."\r\n\r\nHe heard Deborah come by his door and go up the second flight of stairs to\r\nthe room she had taken on the third floor.\r\n\r\n"I was wrong," he reflected, "she has been trying--but it doesn\'t do any\r\ngood. Women simply haven\'t it in \'em to see each other\'s point of view.\r\nDeborah doesn\'t admire Edith--she can\'t, she only pities her and puts her\r\ndown as out of date. And Edith feels that, and it gets her riled, and she\r\nsets herself like an angry old hen against all Deborah\'s new ideas. Why the\r\ndevil can\'t they live and let live?"\r\n\r\nAnd he hesitated savagely between a pearl gray _and_ a black cravat. Then\r\nhe heard another step on the stairs. It was much slower than Deborah\'s, and\r\ncautious and dogged, one foot lifted carefully after the other. It was\r\nJohn, who had finished his kitchen supper and was silently making his way\r\nup through the house to his room at the top, there to keep out of sight for\r\nthe evening. And it came into Roger\'s mind that John had been acting in\r\njust this fashion ever since Edith had been in the house.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have trouble there, too!" he told himself, as he jerked the black\r\nsatin cravat into place, a tie he thoroughly disliked. Yes, black, by\r\nGeorge, he felt like it to-night! These women! These evenings! This worry!\r\nThis war! This world gone raving, driveling mad!\r\n\r\nAnd frowning with annoyance, Roger went down to his dinner.\r\n\r\nAs he waited he grew impatient. He had eaten no lunch, he was hungry; and\r\nhe was very tired, too, for he had had his own hard day. Pshaw! He got up\r\nangrily. _Somebody_ must be genial here. He went into the dining room and\r\npoured himself a good stiff drink. Roger had never been much of a drinker.\r\nEver since his marriage, cigars had been his only vice. But of late he had\r\nbeen having curious little sinking spells. They worried him, and he told\r\nhimself he could not afford to get either too tired or too faint.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he reflected, it was setting a bad example for George. But\r\nglancing into his study he saw that the lad was completely absorbed. With\r\nknees drawn up, his long lank form all hunched and huddled on the lounge,\r\nhair rumpled, George was reading a book which had a cover of tough gray\r\ncloth. At the sight of it his grandfather smiled, for he had seen it once\r\nbefore. Where George had obtained it, the Lord only knew. Its title was\r\n"Bulls and Breeding." A thoroughly practical little book, but nothing for\r\nGeorge\'s mother to see. As his grandfather entered behind him, the boy\r\nlooked up with a guilty start, and resumed with a short breath of relief.\r\n\r\nYoung Elizabeth, too, had a furtive air, for instead of preparing her\r\nhistory lesson she was deep in the evening paper reading about the war\r\nabroad. Stout and florid, rather plain, but with a frank, attractive face\r\nand honest, clear, appealing eyes, this curious creature of thirteen was\r\nsitting firmly in her chair with her feet planted wide apart, eagerly\r\nscanning an account of the work of American surgeons in France. And again\r\nRoger smiled to himself. (He was feeling so much better now.) So Betsy was\r\nstill thinking of becoming a surgeon. He wondered what she would take up\r\nnext. In the past two years in swift succession she had made up her mind to\r\nbe a novelist, an actress and a women\'s college president. And Roger liked\r\nthis tremendously.\r\n\r\nHe loved to watch these two in the house. Here again his family was\r\nwidening out before him, with new figures arising to draw his attention\r\nthis way and that. But these were bright distractions. He took a deep,\r\namused delight in watching these two youngsters caught between two fires,\r\non the one side their mother and upon the other their aunt; both obviously\r\ndrawn toward Deborah, a figure who stood in their regard for all that\r\nthrilling outside world, that heaving sparkling ocean on which they too\r\nwould soon embark; both sternly repressing their eagerness as an insult to\r\ntheir mother, whom they loved and pitied so, regarding her as a brave and\r\ndear but rapidly ageing creature "well on in her thirties," whom they must\r\ncherish and preserve. They both had such solemn thoughts as they looked at\r\nEdith in her chair. But as Roger watched them, with their love and their\r\nsolemnity, their guilt and their perplexity, with quiet enjoyment he would\r\nwait to see the change he knew would come. And it always did. The sudden\r\npicking up of a book, the vanishing of an anxious frown, and in an instant\r\ntheir young minds had turned happily back into themselves, into their own\r\nengrossing lives, their plans, their intimate dreams and ambitions, all so\r\ncuriously bound up with memories of small happenings which had struck them\r\nas funny that day and at which they would suddenly chuckle aloud.\r\n\r\nAnd this was only one stage in their growth. What would be the next, he\r\nasked, and all the others after that? What kind of world would they live\r\nin? Please heaven, there would be no wars. Many old things, no doubt, would\r\nbe changed, by the work of Deborah and her kind--but not too many, Roger\r\nhoped. And these young people, meanwhile, would be bringing up children in\r\ntheir turn. So the family would go on, and multiply and scatter wide, never\r\nto unite again. And he thought he could catch glimpses, very small and far\r\naway but bright as patches of sunlight upon distant mountain tops, into the\r\nwidening vista of those many lives ahead. A wistful look crept over his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"In their lives too we shall be there, the dim strong figures of the past."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDeborah came into the room, and at once the whole atmosphere changed. Her\r\nniece sprang up delightedly.\r\n\r\n"Why, Auntie, how lovely you look!" she exclaimed. And Roger eyed Deborah\r\nin surprise. Though she did not believe in mourning, she had been wearing\r\ndark gowns of late to avoid hurting Edith\'s feelings. But to-night she had\r\ndonned bright colors instead; her dress was as near d\xe9collet\xe9 as anything\r\nthat Deborah wore, and there was a band of dull blue velvet bound about\r\nher hair.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, dearie," she said, smiling. "Shall we go in to dinner now?" she\r\nadded to her father. "Edith said not to wait for her--and I\'ll have to be\r\noff rather early this evening."\r\n\r\n"What is it to-night?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"A big meeting at Cooper Union."\r\n\r\nAnd at dinner she went on to say that in her five schools the neighborhood\r\nclubs had combined to hold this meeting, and she herself was to preside. At\r\nonce her young niece was all animation.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wish I could go and hear you!" she sighed.\r\n\r\n"Afraid you can\'t, Betsy," her aunt replied. And at this, with an\r\ninstinctive glance toward the door where her mother would soon come in to\r\nstop by her mere presence all such conversation, Elizabeth eagerly threw\r\nout one inquiry after the other, pell mell.\r\n\r\n"How on earth do you do it?" she wanted to know. "How do you get a speech\r\nready, Aunt Deborah--how much of it do you write out ahead? Aren\'t you just\r\nthe least bit nervous--now, I mean--this minute? And how will you feel on\r\nthe platform? _What on earth do you do with your feet?_"\r\n\r\nAs the girl bent forward there with her gaze fixed ardently on her aunt,\r\nher grandfather thought in half comic dismay, "Lord, now she\'ll want to be\r\na great speaker--like her aunt. And she will tell her mother so!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the meeting all about?" he inquired. And Deborah began to explain.\r\n\r\nIn her five schools the poverty was rapidly becoming worse. Each week more\r\nchildren stayed away or came to school ragged and unkempt, some without any\r\novercoats, small pitiful mites wearing shoes so old as barely to stick on\r\ntheir feet. And when the teachers and visitors followed these children into\r\ntheir homes they found bare, dirty, chilly rooms where the little folk\r\nshivered and wailed for food and the mothers looked distracted, gaunt and\r\nsullen and half crazed. Over three hundred thousand workers were idle in\r\nthe city. Meanwhile, to make matters worse, half the money from uptown\r\nwhich had gone in former years into work for the tenements was going over\r\nto Belgium instead. And the same relentless drain of war was felt by the\r\ntenement people themselves; for all of them were foreigners, and from their\r\nrelatives abroad, in those wide zones of Europe already blackened and laid\r\nwaste, in endless torrents through the mails came wild appeals for money.\r\n\r\nIn such homes her children lived. And Deborah had set her mind on vigorous\r\nmeasures of relief. Landlords must be made to wait and the city be\r\npersuaded to give work to the most needy, food and fuel must be secured. As\r\nshe spoke of the task before her, with a flush of animation upon her bright\r\nexpressive face at the thought that in less than an hour she would be\r\nfacing thousands of people, the gloom of the picture she painted was\r\ndispelled in the spirit she showed.\r\n\r\n"These things always work out," she declared, with an impatient shrug of\r\nher shoulders. And watching her admiringly, young Betsy thought, "How\r\nstrong she is! What a wonderful grown-up woman!" And Roger watching\r\nthought, "How young."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"What things?" It was Edith\'s voice at the door, and among those at the\r\ntable there was a little stir of alarm. She had entered unnoticed and now\r\ntook her seat. She was looking pale and tired. "What things work out so\r\nfinely?" she asked, and with a glance at Deborah\'s gown,\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" she added.\r\n\r\n"To a meeting," Deborah answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh." And Edith began her soup. In the awkward pause that followed, twice\r\nDeborah started to speak to her sister, but checked herself, for at other\r\ndinners just like this she had made such dismal failures.\r\n\r\n"By the way, Edith," she said, at last, "I\'ve been thinking of all that\r\nfurniture of yours which is lying in storage." Her sister looked up at her,\r\nstartled.\r\n\r\n"What about it?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"There\'s so much of it you don\'t care for," Deborah answered quietly. "Why\r\ndon\'t you let a part of it go? I mean the few pieces you\'ve always\r\ndisliked."\r\n\r\n"For what purpose?"\r\n\r\n"Why, it seems such a pity not to have Hannah back in the house. She would\r\nmake things so much easier." Roger felt a glow of relief.\r\n\r\n"A capital plan!" he declared at once.\r\n\r\n"It would be," Edith corrected him, "if I hadn\'t already made _other_\r\nplans." And then in a brisk, breathless tone, "You see I\'ve made up my\r\nmind," she said, "to sell not only part but _all_ my furniture--very\r\nsoon--and a few other belongings as well--and use the money to put George\r\nand Elizabeth and little Bob back in the schools where they belong."\r\n\r\n"Mother!" gasped Elizabeth, and with a prolonged "Oh-h" of delight she ran\r\naround to her mother\'s chair.\r\n\r\n"But look here," George blurted worriedly, "I don\'t like it, mother, darned\r\nif I do! You\'re selling everything--just for school!"\r\n\r\n"School is rather important, George," was Edith\'s tart rejoinder. "If you\r\ndon\'t think so, ask your aunt." "What do you think of it, Auntie?" he\r\nasked. The cloud which had come on Deborah\'s face was lifted in an instant.\r\n\r\n"I think, George," she answered gently, "that you\'d better let your mother\r\ndo what she thinks best for you. It _will_ make things easier here in the\r\nhouse," she added, to her sister, "but I wish you could have Hannah, too."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll manage nicely now," said Edith. And with a slight smile of\r\ntriumph she resumed her dinner.\r\n\r\n"The war won\'t last forever," muttered Roger uneasily. And to himself: "But\r\nsuppose it _should_ last--a year or more." He did not approve of Edith\'s\r\nscheme. "It\'s burning her bridges all at once, for something that isn\'t\r\nessential," he thought. But he would not tell her so.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Deborah glanced at the clock.\r\n\r\n"Oh! It\'s nearly eight o\'clock! I must hurry or I\'ll be late," she said.\r\n"Good-night, all--"\r\n\r\nAnd she left them.\r\n\r\nRoger followed her into the hall.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of this?" he demanded. Her reply was a tolerant shrug.\r\n\r\n"It\'s her own money, father--"\r\n\r\n"All her money!" he rejoined. "Every dollar she has in the world!"\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t just see how it can be helped."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you talk to her, show her what folly it is?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly," said Deborah, smiling. Already she had on her coat and hat and\r\nwas turning to go. And her father scowled with annoyance. She was always\r\ngoing, he told himself, leaving him to handle her sister alone. He would\r\nlike to go out himself in the evenings--yes, by George, this very night--it\r\nwould act like a tonic on his mind. Just for a moment, standing there, he\r\nsaw Cooper Union packed to the doors, he heard the ringing speeches, the\r\ncheers. But no, it was not to be thought of. With this silent war going on\r\nin his house he knew he must stay neutral. Watchful waiting was his course.\r\nIf he went out with Deborah, Edith would be distinctly hurt, and sitting\r\nall evening here alone she would draw still deeper into herself. And so it\r\nwould be night after night, as it had been for many weeks. He would be\r\ncooped up at home while Deborah did the running about.... In half the time\r\nit takes to tell it, Roger had worked himself into a state where he felt\r\nlike a mighty badly used man.\r\n\r\n"I wish you _would_ speak to her," he said. "I wish you could manage to\r\nfind time to be here more in the evenings. Edith worries so much and she\'s\r\ntrying so hard. A little sympathy now and then--"\r\n\r\n"But she doesn\'t seem to want any from me," said his daughter, a bit\r\nimpatiently. "I know it\'s hard--of course it is. But what can I do? She\r\nwon\'t let me help. And besides--there are other families, you\r\nknow--thousands--really suffering--for the lack of all that we have here."\r\nShe smiled and kissed him quickly. "Good-night, dad dear, I\'ve got to run."\r\n\r\nAnd the door closed behind her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter dinner that night, in the living room the two older children studied\r\ntheir lessons and Edith sat mending a pair of rompers for little Tad.\r\nPresently Roger came out from his den with the evening paper in his hand\r\nand sat down close beside her. He did this conscientiously almost every\r\nevening. With a sigh he opened his paper to read, again there was silence\r\nin the room, and in this silence Roger\'s mind roamed far away across the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nFor the front page of his paper was filled with the usual headlines,\r\ntidings which a year before would have made a man\'s heart jump into his\r\nthroat, but which were getting commonplace now. Dead and wounded by the\r\nthousands, famine, bombs and shrapnel, hideous atrocities, submarines and\r\nfloating mines, words once remote but now familiar, always there on the\r\nfront page and penetrating into his soul, becoming a part of Roger Gale, so\r\nthat never again when the war was done would he be the same man he was\r\nbefore. For he had forever lost his faith in the sanity and steadiness of\r\nthe great mind of humanity. Roger had thought of mankind as mature, but\r\nthere had come to him of late the same feeling he had had before in the\r\nbosom of his family. Mankind had suddenly unmasked and shown itself for\r\nwhat it was--still only a precocious child, with a terrible precocity. For\r\nits growth had been one sided. Its strength was growing at a speed\r\nbreathless and astounding. But its vision and its poise, its sense of human\r\njustice, of kindliness and tolerance and of generous brotherly love, these\r\nhad been neglected and were being left behind. Vaguely he thought of its\r\nships of steel, its railroads and its flaming mills, its miracles, its\r\nprodigies. And the picture rose in his mind of a child, standing there of\r\ngiant\'s size with dangerous playthings in its hands, and boastfully\r\ndeclaring,\r\n\r\n"I can thunder over the earth, dive in the ocean, soar on the clouds! I can\r\nshiver to atoms a mountain, I can drench whole lands with blood! I can look\r\nup and laugh at God!"\r\n\r\nAnd Roger frowned as he read the news. What strange new century lay ahead?\r\nWhat convulsing throes of change? What was in store for his children?\r\nTighter set his heavy jaw.\r\n\r\n"It shall be good," he told himself with a grim determination. "For them\r\nthere shall be better things. Something great and splendid shall come out\r\nof it at last. They will look back upon this time as I look on the French\r\nRevolution."\r\n\r\nHe tried to peer into that world ahead, dazzling, distant as the sun. But\r\nthen with a sigh he returned to the news, and little by little his mind\r\nagain was gripped and held by the most compelling of all appeals so far\r\nrevealed in humanity\'s growth, the appeal of war to the mind of a man. He\r\nfrowned as he read, but he read on. Why didn\'t England send over more men?\r\n\r\nThe clock struck nine.\r\n\r\n"Now, George. Now, Elizabeth," Edith said. With the usual delay and\r\nreluctance the children brought their work to an end, kissed their mother\r\nand went up to bed. And Edith continued sewing. Presently she smiled to\r\nherself. Little Tad had been so droll that day.\r\n\r\nOn the third page of his paper, Roger\'s glance was arrested by a full\r\ncolumn story concerning Deborah\'s meeting that night. And as in a long\r\ninterview he read here in the public print the same things she had told him\r\nat supper, he felt a little glow of pride. Yes, this daughter of his was a\r\nwonderful woman, living a big useful life, taking a leading part in work\r\nwhich would certainly brighten the lives of millions of children still\r\nunborn. Again he felt the tonic of it. Here was a glimmer of hope in the\r\nworld, here was an antidote to war. He finished the column and glanced up.\r\n\r\nEdith was still sewing. He thought of her plan to sell all she possessed in\r\norder to put her children back in their expensive schools uptown.\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t she save her money?" he thought. "God knows there\'s little\r\nenough of it left. But I can\'t tell her that. If I do she\'ll sell\r\neverything, hand me the cash and tell me she\'s sorry to be such a burden.\r\nShe\'ll sit like a thundercloud in my house."\r\n\r\nNo, he could say nothing to stop her. And over the top of his paper her\r\nfather shot a look at her of keen exasperation. Why risk everything she had\r\nto get these needless frills and fads? Why must she cram her life so full\r\nof petty plans and worries and titty-tatty little jobs? For the Lord\'s\r\nsake, leave their clothes alone! And why these careful little rules for\r\nevery minute of their day, for their washing, their dressing, their eating,\r\ntheir napping, their play and the very air they breathed! He crumpled his\r\npaper impatiently. She was always talking of being old-fashioned. Well\r\nthen, why not be that way? Let her live as her grandmother had, up there in\r\nthe mountain farmhouse. _She_ had not been so particular. With one hired\r\ngirl she had thought herself lucky. And not only had she cooked and sewed,\r\nbut she had spun and woven too, had churned and made cheese and pickles and\r\njam and quilts and even mattresses. Once in two months she had cut Roger\'s\r\nhair, and the rest of the time she had let him alone, except for something\r\nreally worth while--a broken arm, for example, or church. She had stuck to\r\nthe essentials!... But Edith was not old-fashioned, nor was she alive to\r\nthis modern age. In short, she was neither here nor there!\r\n\r\nThen from the nursery above, her smallest boy was heard to cry. With a\r\nlittle sigh of weariness, quickly she rose and went upstairs, and a few\r\nmoments later to Roger\'s ears came a low, sweet, soothing lullaby. Years\r\nago Edith had asked him to teach her some of his mother\'s cradle songs. And\r\nthe one which she was singing to-night was a song he had heard when he was\r\nsmall, when the mountain storms had shrieked and beat upon the rattling old\r\nhouse and he had been frightened and had cried out and his mother had come\r\nto his bed in the dark. He felt as though she were near him now. And as he\r\nlistened to the song, from the deep well of sentiment which was a part of\r\nRoger Gale rose memories that changed his mood, and with it his sense of\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nHere was motherhood of the genuine kind, not orating in Cooper Union in the\r\nname of every child in New York, but crooning low and tenderly, soothing\r\none little child to sleep, one of the five she herself had borne, in agony,\r\nwithout complaint. How Edith had slaved and sacrificed, how bravely she had\r\nrallied after the death of her husband. He remembered her a few hours ago\r\non the bed upstairs, spent and in anguish, sobbing, alone. And remorse came\r\nover him. Deborah\'s talk at dinner had twisted his thinking, he told\r\nhimself. Well, that was Deborah\'s way of life. She had her enormous family\r\nand Edith had her small one, and in this hell of misery which war was\r\nspreading over the earth each mother was up in arms for her brood. And, by\r\nGeorge, of the two he didn\'t know but that he preferred his own flesh and\r\nblood. All very noble, Miss Deborah, and very dramatic, to open your arms\r\nto all the children under the moon and get your name in the papers. But\r\nthere was something pretty fine in just sitting at home and singing to one.\r\n\r\n"All right, little mother, you go straight ahead. This is war and panic and\r\nhard times. You\'re perfectly right to look after your own."\r\n\r\nHe would show Edith he did not begrudge her this use of her small\r\nproperty. And more than that, he would do what he could to take her out of\r\nher loneliness. How about reading aloud to her? He had been a capital\r\nreader, during Judith\'s lifetime, for he had always enjoyed it so. Roger\r\nrose and went to his shelves and began to look over the volumes there.\r\nPerhaps a book of travel.... Stoddard\'s "Lectures on Japan."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Edith came into the room, sat down and took up her sewing. As she\r\ndid so he turned and glanced at her, and she smiled brightly back at him.\r\nYes, he thought with a genial glow, from this night on he would do his\r\npart. He came back to his chair with a book in his hand, prepared to start\r\non his new course.\r\n\r\n"Father," she said quietly. Her eyes were on the work in her lap.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my child, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s about John," she answered. And with a movement of alarm he looked at\r\nhis daughter intently.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with John?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"He has tuberculosis," she said.\r\n\r\n"He has no such thing!" her father retorted. "John has Pott\'s Disease of\r\nthe spine!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know he has," she replied. "And I\'m sorry for him, poor lad. But in\r\nthe last year," she added, "certain complications have come. And now he\'s\r\ntubercular as well."\r\n\r\n"How do you know? He doesn\'t cough--his lungs are sound as yours or mine!"\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s--" Edith pursed her lips. "It\'s different," she said softly.\r\n\r\n"Who told you?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Not Deborah," was the quick response. "She knew it, I\'m certain, for I\r\nfind that she\'s been having Mrs. Neale, the woman who comes in to wash, do\r\nJohn\'s things in a separate tub. I found her doing it yesterday, and she\r\ntold me what Deborah had said."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the first I\'d heard of it," Roger put in.\r\n\r\n"I know it is," she answered. "For if you\'d heard of it before, I don\'t\r\nbelieve you\'d have been as ready as Deborah was, apparently, to risk\r\ninfecting the children here." Edith\'s voice was gentle, slow and\r\nrelentless. There was still a reflection in her eyes of the tenderness\r\nwhich had been there as she had soothed her child to sleep. "As time goes\r\non, John is bound to get worse. The risk will be greater every week."\r\n\r\n"Oh, pshaw!" cried her father. "No such thing! You\'re just scaring yourself\r\nover nothing at all!"\r\n\r\n"Doctor Lake didn\'t think I was." Lake was the big child specialist in\r\nwhose care Edith\'s children had been for years. "I talked to him to-day on\r\nthe telephone, and he said we should get John out of the house."\r\n\r\nRoger heartily damned Doctor Lake!\r\n\r\n"It\'s easy to find a good home for the boy," Edith went on quietly, "close\r\nby, if you like--in some respectable family that will be only too thankful\r\nto take in a boarder."\r\n\r\n"How about the danger to that family\'s children?" Roger asked malignantly.\r\n\r\n"Very well, father, do as you please. Take any risk you want to."\r\n\r\n"I\'m taking no risk," he retorted. "If there were any risk they would have\r\ntold me--Allan and Deborah would, I mean."\r\n\r\n"They wouldn\'t!" burst from Edith with a vehemence which startled him.\r\n"They\'d take the same risk for my children they would for any street urchin\r\nin town! All children are the same in their eyes--and if you feel as they\r\ndo--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t feel as they do!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you? Then I\'m telling you that Doctor Lake said there was very\r\nserious risk--every day this boy remains in the house!" Roger rose angrily\r\nfrom his chair:\r\n\r\n"So you want me to turn him out! To-night!"\r\n\r\n"No, I want you to wait a few days--until we can find him a decent home."\r\n\r\n"All right, I won\'t do it!"\r\n\r\n"Very well, father--it\'s your house, not mine."\r\n\r\nFor a few moments longer she sat at her sewing, while her father walked the\r\nfloor. Then abruptly she rose, her eyes brimming with tears, and left the\r\nroom. And he heard a sob as she went upstairs.\r\n\r\n"Now she\'ll shut herself up with her children," he reflected savagely, "and\r\nhold the fort till I come to terms!" Rather than risk a hair on their\r\nheads, Edith would turn the whole world out of doors! He thought of Deborah\r\nand he groaned. She would have to be told of this; and when she was, what a\r\nrow there would be! For Johnny was one of _her_ family. He glanced at the\r\nclock. She\'d be coming home soon. Should he tell her? Not to-night! Just\r\nfor one evening he\'d had enough!\r\n\r\nHe picked up the book he had meant to read--Stoddard\'s "Lectures on Japan."\r\nAnd Roger snorted wrathfully. By George, how _he\'d_ like to go to Japan--or\r\nto darkest Africa! Anywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nBut later in the evening, when Allan and Deborah came in, Roger, who in the\r\nmeantime had had a good hour in Japan and was somewhat relaxed and soothed,\r\ndecided at once this was the time to tell her and have done with it. For\r\nDeborah was flushed with triumph, the meeting had been a huge success.\r\nCooper Union had been packed to the walls, with an overflow meeting out on\r\nthe street; thousands of dollars had been pledged and some big politicians\r\nhad promised support; and men and women, rich and poor, had volunteered\r\ntheir services. She started to tell him about it, but noticed his troubled\r\nexpression and asked him what was on his mind.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing tremendous," Roger said. "I hate to be any damper to-night. I\r\nhadn\'t meant to tell you to-night--but I think I will now, for you look as\r\nthough you could find a solution for anything."\r\n\r\n"Then I must look like an idiot," his daughter said good-humoredly. "What\r\nis it?" she demanded.\r\n\r\n"It\'s about John." Her countenance changed.\r\n\r\n"Oh. Is he worse?"\r\n\r\n"Edith thinks he is--and she says it\'s not safe."\r\n\r\n"I see--she wants him out of the house. Tell me what she said to you." As\r\nhe did so she listened intently, and turning to Allan at the end, "What do\r\nyou say to this, Allan?" she asked. "Is there any real risk to the\r\nchildren?"\r\n\r\n"A little," he responded. "As much as they take every day in the trolley\r\ngoing to school."\r\n\r\n"They never go in the trolley," Deborah answered dryly. "They always go on\r\nthe top of the \'bus." She was silent for a moment. "Well, there\'s no use\r\ndiscussing it. If Edith feels that way, John must go. The house won\'t be\r\nlivable till he does."\r\n\r\nRoger looked at her in surprise. He felt both relieved and disappointed.\r\n"John\'s only one of thousands to her," he told himself aggrievedly. "He\r\nisn\'t close to her, she hasn\'t room, she has a whole mass meeting in her\r\nhead. But I haven\'t, by George, I like the boy--and I\'m the one who will\r\nhave to tell him to pack up and leave the house! Isn\'t it the very devil,\r\nhow things all come back on me?"\r\n\r\n"Look here, father," Deborah said, "suppose you let me manage this." And\r\nRoger\'s heavy visage cleared.\r\n\r\n"You mean you\'ll tell him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she replied, "and he\'ll understand it perfectly. I think he has been\r\nexpecting it. I have, for a good many weeks," she added, with some\r\nbitterness. "And I know some people who will be glad enough to take him in.\r\nI\'ll see that he\'s made comfortable. Only--" her face clouded.\r\n\r\n"It has meant a lot to him, being here," her father put in gruffly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, John\'s used to getting knocks in this world." Her quiet voice grew\r\nhard and stern. "I wasn\'t thinking of John just now. What frightens me at\r\ntimes like this is Edith," she said slowly. "No, not just\r\nEdith--motherhood. I see it in so many mothers these days--in the women\r\ndowntown, in their fight for their children against all other children on\r\nearth. It\'s the hardest thing we have to do--to try to make them see and\r\nfeel outside of their own small tenement homes--and help each other--pull\r\ntogether. They can\'t see it\'s their only chance! And all because of this\r\nmother love! It\'s so blind sometimes, like an animal!" She broke off, and\r\nfor a moment she seemed to be looking deep into herself. "And I suppose\r\nwe\'re all like that, we women are," she muttered, "when we marry and have\r\nchildren. If the pinch is ever hard enough--"\r\n\r\n"_You_ wouldn\'t be," said Allan. And a sudden sharp uneasiness came into\r\nRoger\'s mind.\r\n\r\n"When are you two to be married?" he asked, without stopping to think. And\r\nat once he regretted his question. With a quick impatient look at him,\r\nAllan bent over a book on the table.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," Deborah answered. "Next spring, I hope." The frown was\r\nstill on her face.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t make it too long," said her father brusquely. He left them and went\r\nup to bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDeborah sat motionless. She wished Allan would go, for she guessed what was\r\ncoming and did not feel equal to it to-night. All at once she felt tired\r\nand unnerved from her long exciting evening. If only she could let go of\r\nherself and have a good cry. She locked her hands together and looked up at\r\nhim with impatience. He was still at the table, his back was turned.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you _know_ I love you?" she was thinking fiercely. "Can\'t you see\r\nit--haven\'t you seen it--growing, growing--day after day? But I don\'t want\r\nyou here to-night! Why can\'t you see you must leave me alone? Now! This\r\nminute!"\r\n\r\nHe turned and came over in front of her, and stood looking steadily down.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," he said slowly, "how well you understand yourself."\r\n\r\n"I think I do," she muttered. With a sudden twitching of her lip she looked\r\nquickly up at him. "Go on, Allan--let\'s talk it all over now if you must!"\r\n\r\n"Not if you feel like that," he said. At his tone of displeasure she caught\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I want to! Please!" she cried. "It\'s better--really! Believe me,\r\nit is--"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment, his wide generous mouth set hard, and then in a tone\r\nas sharp as hers he demanded, "Are you sure you\'ll marry me next spring?\r\nAre you sure you _hope_ you will next spring? Are you sure this sister of\r\nyours in the house, on your nerves day and night, with this blind narrow\r\nmotherhood, this motherhood which frightens you--isn\'t frightening you too\r\nmuch?"\r\n\r\n"No--a little--but not too much." Her deep sweet voice was trembling.\r\n"You\'re the one who frightens me. If you only knew! When you come like\r\nthis--with all you\'ve done for me back of you--"\r\n\r\n"Deborah! Don\'t be a fool!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know you say you\'ve done nothing, except what you\'ve been glad to\r\ndo! You love me like that! But it\'s just that love! Giving up all your\r\npractice little by little, and your reputation uptown--all for the sake of\r\nme, Allan, me!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re wrong," he replied. "Compared to what I\'m getting, I\'ve given up\r\nnothing! Can\'t you see? You\'re just as narrow in your school as Edith is\r\nright here in her home! You look upon my hospital as a mere annex to your\r\nschools, when the truth of it is that the work down there is a chance I\'ve\r\nwanted all my life! Can\'t you understand," he cried, "that instead of your\r\nbeing in debt to me it\'s I who am in debt to you? You\'re a suffragist, eh,\r\na feminist--whatever you want to call it! All right! So you want to be\r\nequal with man! Then, for God\'s sake, why not begin? _Feel_ equal! I\'m no\r\nannex to you, nor you to me! It has happened, thank God, that our work fits\r\nin--each with the other!"\r\n\r\nHe stopped and stared, seemed to shake himself; he walked the floor. And\r\nwhen he turned back his expression had changed.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Deborah," he asked, with an appealing humorous smile, "will you\r\ntell me what I\'m driving at?"\r\n\r\nDeborah threw back her head and laughed, and her laughter thrilled with\r\nrelief. "How sure I feel now that I love him," she thought.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve proved I owe you nothing!" she cried. "And that men and women of\r\nour kind can work on splendidly side by side, and never bother our poor\r\nlittle heads about anything else--even marriage!"\r\n\r\n"We will, though!" he retorted. The next moment she was in his arms. "Now,\r\nDeborah, listen to reason, child. Why can\'t you marry me right away?"\r\n\r\n"Because," she said, "when I marry you I\'m going to have you all to\r\nmyself--for weeks and weeks as we planned before! And afterwards, with a\r\nwonderful start--and with the war over, work less hard and the world less\r\ndark and gloomy--we\'re going to find that at last we can live! But this\r\nwinter it couldn\'t be like that. This winter we\'ve got to go on with our\r\nwork--and without any more silly worries or talk about whether or not we\'re\r\nin love. _For we are_!" Her upturned face was close to his, and for some\r\nmoments nothing was said, "Well?" she asked. "Are you satisfied?"\r\n\r\n"No--I want to get married. But it is now a quarter past one. And I\'m your\r\nphysician. Go straight to bed."\r\n\r\nShe stopped him a minute at the front door:\r\n\r\n"Are you sure, absolutely, you understand?"\r\n\r\nHe told her he did. But as he walked home he reflected. How tense she had\r\nbeen in the way she had talked. Yes, the long strain was telling. "Why was\r\nshe so anxious to get me out of the house," he asked, "when we were alone\r\nfor the first time in days? And why, if she\'s really sure of her love, does\r\nshe hate the idea that she\'s in my debt?"\r\n\r\nHe walked faster, for the night was cold. And there was a chill, too, in\r\nthis long waiting game.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRoger heard Deborah come up to bed, and he wondered what they had been\r\ntalking about. Of the topic he himself had broached--each other, love and\r\nmarriage?\r\n\r\n"Possibly--for a minute or two--but no more," he grumbled. "For don\'t\r\nforget there\'s work to discuss, there\'s that mass meeting still on her\r\nmind. And God knows a woman\'s mind is never any child\'s play. But when you\r\nload a mass meeting on top--"\r\n\r\nHere he yawned long and noisily. His head ached, he felt sore and\r\nweak--"from the evening\'s entertainment my other daughter gave me." No, he\r\nwas through, he had had enough. They could settle things to suit\r\nthemselves. Let Edith squander her money on frills, the more expensive the\r\nbetter. Let her turn poor Johnny out of the house, let her give full play\r\nto her motherhood. And if that scared Deborah out of marrying, let her stay\r\nsingle and die an old maid. He had worried enough for his family. He wanted\r\na little peace in his house.\r\n\r\nDrowsily he closed his eyes, and a picture came into his mind of the city\r\nas he had seen it only a few nights before. It had been so cool, so calm\r\nand still. At dusk he had been in the building of the great tower on\r\nMadison Square; and when he had finished his business there, on an impulse\r\nhe had gone up to the top, and through a wide low window had stood a few\r\nmoments looking down. A soft light snow was falling; and from high up in\r\nthe storm, through the silent whirling flakes, he had looked far down upon\r\nlights below, in groups and clusters, dancing lines, between tall phantom\r\nbuildings, blurred and ghostly, faint, unreal. From all that bustle and\r\nfever of life there had risen to him barely a sound. And the town had\r\nseemed small and lonely, a little glow in the infinite dark, fulfilling its\r\nallotted place for its moment in eternity. Suddenly from close over his\r\nhead like a brazen voice out of the sky, hard and deafening and clear, the\r\ngreat bell had boomed the hour. Then again had come the silence, and the\r\ncool, soft, whirling snow.\r\n\r\nLike a dream it faded all away, and with a curious smile on his face\r\npresently Roger fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now he felt the approach at last of another season of quiet, one of\r\nthose uneventful times which come in family histories. As he washed and\r\ndressed for dinner, one night a little later, he thought with satisfaction,\r\n"How nicely things are smoothing out." His dressing for dinner, as a rule,\r\nconsisted in changing his low wing collar and his large round detachable\r\ncuffs; but to-night he changed his cravat as well, from a black to a pearl\r\ngray one. He hoped the whole winter would be pearl gray.\r\n\r\nThe little storm which Edith had raised over John\'s presence in the house\r\nhad been allayed. Deborah had talked to John, and had moved him with his\r\nbelongings to a comfortable sunny room in the small but neat apartment of a\r\nScotch family nearby. And John had been so sensible. "Oh, I\'m fine, thank\r\nyou," he had answered simply, when in the office Roger had asked him about\r\nhis new home. So that incident was closed. Already Edith was disinfecting\r\nJohn\'s old room to her heart\'s content, for George was to occupy it now.\r\nShe was having the woodwork repainted and a new paper put on the walls. She\r\nhad already purchased a small new rug, and a bed and a bureau and one easy\r\nchair, and was making a pair of fresh pretty curtains. All right, let her\r\ndo it--if only there could be peace in the house.\r\n\r\nWith his cravat adjusted and his thick-curling silver hair trim from having\r\njust been cut by "Louis" over at the Brevoort, Roger went comfortably down\r\nto his dinner. Edith greeted him with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Deborah\'s dining out," she said.\r\n\r\n"Very well," he replied, "so much the better. We\'ll go right in--I\'m\r\nhungry. And we\'ll have the evening to ourselves. No big ideas nor problems.\r\nEh, daughter?" He slipped his hand in hers, and she gave it a little\r\naffectionate squeeze. With John safely out of the way, and not only the\r\nhealth of her children but their proper schooling assured, Edith was\r\nherself again, placid, sweet and kindly. And dinner that night was a\r\ncheerful meal. Later, in the living room, as Roger contentedly lit his\r\ncigar, Edith gave an appreciative sniff.\r\n\r\n"You do smoke such good cigars, father," she said, smiling over her needle.\r\nAnd glancing up at her daughter, "Betsy, dear," she added, "go and get your\r\ngrandfather\'s evening paper."\r\n\r\nIn quiet perusal of the news he spent the first part of his evening. The\r\nwar did not bother him to-night, for there had come a lull in the fighting,\r\nas though even war could know its place. And times were better over here.\r\nAs, skipping all news from abroad his eye roved over the pages for what his\r\nbusiness depended upon, Roger began to find it now. The old familiar\r\nheadliness were reappearing side by side--high finance exposures, graft,\r\nthe antics and didos cut up by the sons and daughters of big millionaires;\r\nand after them in cheery succession the Yale-Harvard game, a new man for\r\nthe Giants, a new college building for Cornell, a new city plan for\r\nSeattle, a woman senator in Arizona and in Chicago a "sporting mayor." In\r\nbrief, all over the U.S.A., men and women old and new had risen up, to\r\npower, fame, notoriety, whatever you chose to call it. Men and women?\r\nHardly. "Children" was the better word. But the thought did not trouble\r\nRoger to-night. He had instead a heartening sense of the youth, the wild\r\nexuberance, the boundless vigor in his native land. He could feel it rising\r\nonce again. Life was soon to go on as before; people were growing hungry to\r\nsee the names of their countrymen back in the headlines where they\r\nbelonged. And Roger\'s business was picking up. He was not sure of the\r\nfigure of his deficit last week--he had always been vague on the\r\nbook-keeping side--but he knew it was down considerably.\r\n\r\nWhen Betsy and George had gone to bed, Roger put down his paper.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Edith," he proposed, "how\'d you like me to read aloud while you\r\nsew?" She looked up with a smile of pleased surprise.\r\n\r\n"Why, father dear, I\'d love it." At once, she bent over her needle again,\r\nso that if there were any awkwardness attending this small change in their\r\nlives it did not reveal itself in her pretty countenance. "What shall we\r\nread?" she affably asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a capital book," he replied. "It\'s about travel in Japan."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like nothing better," Edith replied. And with a slight glow of pride\r\nin himself Roger took his book in hand. The experiment was a decided\r\nsuccess. He read again the next night and the next, while Edith sat at her\r\nsewing. And so this hour\'s companionship, from nine to ten in the evening,\r\nbecame a regular custom--just one hour and no more, which Roger spent with\r\nhis daughter, intimately and pleasantly. Yes, life was certainly smoothing\r\nout.\r\n\r\nEdith\'s three older children had been reinstated in school. And although at\r\nfirst, when deprived of their aid, she had found it nearly impossible to\r\nkeep her two small boys amused and give them besides the four hours a day\r\nof fresh air they required, she had soon met this trouble by the same\r\nsimple process as before. Of her few possessions still unsold, she had\r\ndisposed of nearly all, and with a small fund thus secured she had sent for\r\nHannah to return. The house was running beautifully.\r\n\r\nChristmas, too, was drawing near. And though Roger knew that in Edith\'s\r\nheart was a cold dread of this season, she bravely kept it to herself; and\r\nshe set about so determinedly to make a merry holiday, that her father\r\nadmiring her pluck drew closer still to his daughter. He entered into her\r\nChristmas plans and into all the conspiracies which were whispered about\r\nthe house. Great secrets, anxious consultations, found in him a ready\r\nlistener.\r\n\r\nSo passed three blessed quiet weeks, and he had high hopes for the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there were any cloud upon his horizon, it was the thought of Laura. She\r\nhad barely been to the house since Edith had come back to town; and at\r\ntimes, especially in the days when things had looked dark for Roger, he had\r\ncaught himself reproaching this giddy-gaddy youngest child, so engrossed in\r\nher small "m\xe9nage" that apparently she could not spare a thought for her\r\nwidowed sister. Laura on her return from abroad had brought as a gift for\r\nEdith a mourning gown from Paris, a most alluring creation--so much so, in\r\nfact, that Edith had felt it simply indecent, insulting, and had returned\r\nit to her sister with a stilted note of thanks. But Roger did not know of\r\nthis. There were so many ways, he thought, in which Laura might have been\r\nnice to Edith. She had a gorgeous limousine in which she might so easily\r\nhave come and taken her sister off on little trips uptown. But no, she kept\r\nher car to herself. And from her small apartment, where a maid whom she had\r\nbrought from Rome dressed her several times each day, that limousine rushed\r\nher noiselessly forth, gay and wild as ever, immaculate and elegant,\r\nradiant and very rich. To what places did she go? What new friends was she\r\nmaking? What was Laura up to?\r\n\r\nHe did not like her manner, one evening when she came to the house. As he\r\nhelped her off with her cloak, a sleek supple leopard skin which fitted her\r\nfigure like a glove, he asked,\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Hal this evening?" And she answered lightly,\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t ask _me_ what he does with himself."\r\n\r\n"You mean, I suppose," said Edith, with quiet disapproval, "that he is\r\nrushed to death this year with all this business from the war."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s business," Laura replied, as she deftly smoothed and patted her\r\nsoft, abundant, reddish hair. "And it\'s war, too," she added.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" her father asked. He knew what she meant, war with her\r\nhusband. But before Laura could answer him, Edith cut in hastily, for two\r\nof her children were present. At dinner she turned the talk to the war. But\r\neven on this topic, Laura\'s remarks were disturbing. She did not consider\r\nthe war wholly bad--by no means, it had many good points. It was clearing\r\naway a lot of old rubbish, customs, superstitions and institutions out of\r\ndate. "Musty old relics," she called them. She spoke as though repeating\r\nwhat someone else had told her. Laura with her chicken\'s mind could never\r\nhave thought it all out by herself. When asked what she meant, she was\r\nsmilingly vague, with a glance at Edith\'s youngsters. But she threw out\r\nhints about the church and even Christianity, as though it were falling to\r\npieces. She spoke of a second Renaissance, "a glorious pagan era" coming.\r\nAnd then she exploded a little bomb by inquiring of Edith.\r\n\r\n"What do you think the girls over there are going to do for husbands, with\r\nhalf the marriageable men either killed or hopelessly damaged? They\'re not\r\ngoing to be nuns all their lives!"\r\n\r\nAgain her sister cut her off, and the rest of the brief evening was\r\ndecidedly awkward. Yes, she was changing, growing fast. And Roger did not\r\nlike it. Here she was spending money like water, absorbed in her pleasures,\r\nhaving no baby, apparently at loose ends with her husband, and through it\r\nall so cocksure of herself and her outrageous views about war, and smiling\r\nabout them with such an air, and in her whole manner, such a tone of amused\r\nsuperiority. She talked about a world for the strong, bits of gabble from\r\nNietzsche and that sort of rot; she spoke blithely of a Rome reborn, the\r\n"Wings of the Eagles" heard again. This part of it she had taken, no doubt,\r\nfrom her new Italian friend, her husband\'s shrapnel partner.\r\n\r\nPshaw! What was Laura up to?\r\n\r\nBut that was only one evening. It was not repeated, another month went\r\nquickly by, and Roger had soon shaken it from him, for he had troubles\r\nenough at home. One daughter at a time, he had thought. And as the dark\r\nclouds close above him had cleared, the other cloud too had drifted away,\r\nuntil it was small, just on the horizon, far away from Roger\'s house. What\r\nwas Laura up to? He barely ever thought of that now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut one night when he came home, Edith, who sat in the living room reading\r\naloud to her smaller boys, gave him a significant look which warned him\r\nsomething had happened. And turning to take off his overcoat, in the hall\r\nhe almost stumbled upon a pile of hand luggage, two smart patent leather\r\nbags, a hat trunk and a sable cloak.\r\n\r\n"Hello," he exclaimed. "What\'s this? Who\'s here?"\r\n\r\n"Laura," Edith answered. "She\'s up in Deborah\'s room, I think--they\'ve been\r\nup there for over an hour." Roger looked indignantly in at his daughter.\r\n\r\n"What has happened?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I can\'t tell you," Edith replied. "They didn\'t seem to need me.\r\nThey made it rather plain, in fact. Another quarrel, I presume. She came\r\ninto the house like a whirlwind, asked at once for Deborah and flew up to\r\nDeborah\'s room."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" Roger heavily mounted the stairs. He at least did not feel like\r\nflying. A whirlwind, eh--a nice evening ahead!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in her room upstairs Deborah sat motionless, sternly holding her\r\nfeelings down, while in a tone now kindly but more often full of a sharp\r\ndismay, she threw out question after question to Laura who was walking the\r\nfloor in a quick, feverish sort of way, with gestures half hysterical, her\r\nvoice bursting with emotions of mingled fright and rage.\r\n\r\n"No, this time it\'s divorce!" she declared, at the end of her first\r\noutburst, in which she had told in fragments of her husband\'s double life.\r\n"I\'ve stood it long enough! I\'m through!"\r\n\r\n"You mean you don\'t care for him," Deborah said. She was fighting for time\r\nto think it out. "You want a divorce. Very well, Laura dear--but how do you\r\nthink you are going to get it? The laws are rather strict in this state.\r\nThey allow but one cause. Have you any proofs?"\r\n\r\n"No, I haven\'t--but I don\'t need any proofs! He wants it as badly as I do!\r\nWait--I\'ll give you his very words!" Laura\'s face grew white with fury.\r\n"\'It\'s entirely up to you, Sweetie\'--the beast!--\'You can have any kind of\r\ndivorce you like. You can let me bring suit on the quiet or you can try to\r\nfight me in court, climb up into the witness chair in front of the\r\nreporters and tell them all about yourself!\'"\r\n\r\n"_Your husband is to bring suit against you_?" Deborah\'s voice was loud and\r\nharsh. "For God\'s sake, Laura, what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Mean? I mean that _he has proofs_! He has used a detective, the mean\r\nlittle cur, and he\'s treating me like the dirt under his feet! Just as\r\nthough it were one thing for a man, and another--quite--for a woman! He\r\neven had the nerve to be mad, to get on a high horse, call me names! Turn\r\nme!--turn me out on the street!" Deborah winced as though from a blow. "Oh,\r\nit was funny, funny!" Laura was almost sobbing now.\r\n\r\n"Stop, this minute!" Deborah said. "You say that you\'ve been doing--what he\r\nhas?" she demanded.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t I? What do you know about it? Are you going to turn against\r\nme, too?"\r\n\r\n"I am--pretty nearly--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, good God!" Laura tossed up her hands and went on with her walking.\r\n\r\n"Quiet! Please try to be clear and explain."\r\n\r\n"Explain--to you? How can I? _You_ don\'t understand--you know nothing about\r\nit--all you know about is schools! You\'re simply a nun when it comes to\r\nthis. I see it now--I didn\'t before--I thought you a modern woman--with\r\nyour mind open to new ideas. But it isn\'t, it seems, when it comes to a\r\npinch--it\'s shut as tight as Edith\'s is--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, tight!"\r\n\r\n"Thank you very much! Then for the love of Heaven will you kindly leave me\r\nalone! I\'ll have a talk with father!"\r\n\r\n"You will _not_ have a talk with father--"\r\n\r\n"I most certainly will--and he\'ll understand! He\'s a man, at least--and he\r\nled a man\'s life before he was married!"\r\n\r\n"Laura!"\r\n\r\n"_You_ can\'t see it in him--_but I can_!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll say not a word to him, not one word! He has had enough this year as\r\nit is!"\r\n\r\n"Has he? Then I\'m sorry! If _you_ were any help to me--instead of acting\r\nlike a nun--"\r\n\r\n"Will you please stop talking like a fool?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not! I\'m speaking the truth and you know it! You know no more about\r\nlove like mine than a nun of the middle ages! You needn\'t tell me about\r\nAllan Baird. You think you\'re in love with him, don\'t you? Well then, I\'ll\r\ntell you that you\'re not--your love is the kind that can wait for\r\nyears--because it\'s cold, it\'s cold, it\'s cold--it\'s all in your mind and\r\nyour reason! And so I say you\'re no help to me now! Here--look at yourself\r\nin the glass over there! You\'re just plain angry--frightened!"\r\n\r\n"Yes--I am--I\'m frightened." While she strove to think clearly, to form\r\nsome plan, she let her young sister talk rapidly on:\r\n\r\n"I know you are! And you can\'t be fair! You\'re like nearly all American\r\nwomen--married or single, young or old--you\'re all of you scared to death\r\nabout sex--just as your Puritan mothers were! And you leave it alone--you\r\nkeep it down--you never give it a chance--you\'re afraid! But I\'m not\r\nafraid--and I\'m living my life! And let me tell you I\'m not alone! There\r\nare hundreds and thousands doing the same--right here in New York City\r\nto-night! It\'s been so abroad for years and years--in Rome and Berlin, in\r\nParis and London--and now, thank God, it has come over here! If our\r\nhusbands can do it, why can\'t we? And we are--we\'re starting--it\'s come\r\nwith the war! You think war is hell and nothing else, don\'t you--but you\'re\r\nwrong! It\'s not only killing men--it\'s killing a lot of hypocrisies\r\ntoo--it\'s giving a jolt to marriage! You\'ll see what the women will do soon\r\nenough--when there aren\'t enough men any longer--"\r\n\r\n"Suppose you stop this tirade and tell me exactly what you\'ve done,"\r\nDeborah interrupted. A simple course of action had just flashed into her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n"All right, I will. I\'m not ashamed. I\'ve given you this \'tirade\' to show\r\nyou exactly how I feel--that it\'s not any question of sin or guilt or any\r\nmusty old rubbish like that! I know I\'m right! I know just what I\'m doing!"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s the man? That Italian?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"Right here in New York."\r\n\r\n"Does he mean to stand by you?"\r\n\r\n"Of course he does."\r\n\r\n"Will he marry you, Laura?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he will--the minute I\'m free from my beast of a husband!"\r\n\r\n"And your husband will keep his suit quiet, you said, if you agree not to\r\nfight him."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nDeborah rose abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Then will you stay right here to-night, and leave this matter to me?" she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"What do _you_ mean to do?"\r\n\r\n"See your husband."\r\n\r\n"What for? When?"\r\n\r\n"To-night, if I can. I want to be sure."\r\n\r\nLaura looked for the moment nonplussed.\r\n\r\n"And what of my wishes?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"_Your_ wishes," said Deborah steadily. "You want a divorce, don\'t you--so\r\ndo I. And you want it quiet--and so do I. I want it so hard that I want to\r\nmake sure." Deborah\'s tone was kinder now, and she came over close to her\r\nsister. "Look here, Laura, if I\'ve been hard, forgive me--please--and let\r\nme help. I\'m not so narrow as you think. I\'ve been through a good deal of\r\nthis before--downtown, I mean, with girls in my school. They come to me, we\r\nhave long talks. Maybe I _am_ a nun--as you say--but I\'m one with a\r\nconfessional. Not for sins," she added, as Laura looked up angrily. "Sins\r\ndon\'t interest me very much. But troubles do. And heaven knows that\r\nmarriage is one," she said with a curious bitterness. "And when it has\r\nfailed and there\'s no love left--as in your case--I\'m for divorce. Only--"\r\nher wide sensitive lips quivered just a little, "I\'m sorry it had to come\r\nlike this. But I love you, dear, and I want to help, I want to see you\r\nsafely through. And while I\'m doing it, if we can, I want to keep dad out\r\nof it--at least until it\'s settled." She paused a moment. "So if you agree,\r\nI\'ll go to your husband. I want to be sure, absolutely, just what we can\r\ncount on. And until I come back, stay here in my room. You don\'t want to\r\ntalk to father and Edith--"\r\n\r\n"Most certainly not!" Laura muttered.\r\n\r\n"Good. Then stay here until I return. I\'ll send you up some supper."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any, thank you."\r\n\r\nLaura went and threw herself on the bed, while her sister finished\r\ndressing.\r\n\r\n"It\'s decent of you, Deborah." Her voice was muffled and relaxed. "I wasn\'t\r\nfair," she added. "I\'m sorry for some of the things I said."\r\n\r\n"About me and marriage?" Deborah looked at herself in the glass in a\r\npeculiar searching way. A slight spasm crossed her features. "I\'m not sure\r\nbut that you were right. At times I feel far from certain," she said. Laura\r\nlifted her head from the pillow, watched her sister a moment, dropped back.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let this affect _you_, Deborah."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t worry, dearie." And Deborah moved toward the door. "My affair is\r\njust mine, you see, and this won\'t make any difference."\r\n\r\nBut in her heart she knew it would. What an utter loathing she had to-night\r\nfor all that people meant by sex! Suddenly she was quivering, her limbs and\r\nher whole body hot.\r\n\r\n"You say I\'m cold," she was thinking. "Cold toward Allan, calm and cool,\r\nnothing but mind and reason! You say it means little to me, all that! But\r\nif I had had trouble with Allan, would I have come running home to talk?\r\nWouldn\'t I have hugged it tight? And isn\'t that love? What do _you_ know of\r\nme and the life I\'ve led? Do you know how it feels to want to work, to be\r\nsomething yourself, without any man? And can\'t _that_ be a passion? Have\r\nyou had to live with Edith here and see what motherhood can be, what it can\r\ndo to a woman? And now you come with _another_ side, just as narrow as\r\nhers, devouring everything else in sight! And because I\'m a little afraid\r\nof that, for myself and all I want to do, you say I don\'t know what love\r\nis! But I do! And my love\'s worth more than yours! It\'s deeper, richer, it\r\nwill last!... Then why do I loathe it _all_ to-night?... But I don\'t, I\r\nonly loathe _your_ side!... But yours is the very heart of it!... All\r\nright, then what am I going to do?"\r\n\r\nShe was going slowly down the stairs. She stopped for a moment, frowning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the floor below she met her father, who was coming out of his room. He\r\nlooked at her keenly:\r\n\r\n"What\'s the trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Laura\'s here," she answered. "Trouble again with her husband. Better leave\r\nher alone for the present--she\'s going to stay in my room for a while."\r\n\r\n"Very well," her father grunted, and they went down to dinner. There\r\nDeborah was silent, and Edith did most of the talking. Edith, quite aware\r\nof the fact that Laura and all Laura\'s ways were in disgrace for the\r\nmoment, and that she and her ways with her children shone by the\r\ncomparison, was bright and sweet and tactful. Roger glanced at her more\r\nthan once, with approval and with gratitude for the effort she was making\r\nto smooth over the situation. Deborah rose before they had finished.\r\n\r\n"Where are you off to?" Roger asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there\'s something I have to attend to--"\r\n\r\n"School again this evening, dear?" inquired Edith cheerfully, but her\r\nsister was already out of the room. She looked at her father with quiet\r\nconcern. "I\'m sorry she has to be out to-night--to-night of all nights,"\r\nshe murmured.\r\n\r\n"Humph!" ejaculated her father. This _eternal_ school business of Deborah\'s\r\nwas beginning to get on his nerves. Yes, just a little on his nerves! Why\r\ncouldn\'t she give up one evening, just one, and get Laura out of this snarl\r\nshe was in? He heard her at the telephone, and presently she came back to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Edith," she said casually, "don\'t send any supper up to Laura. She\r\nsays she doesn\'t want any to-night. And ask Hannah to put a cot in my room.\r\nWill you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear, I\'ll attend to it."\r\n\r\n"Thanks." And again she left them. In silence, when the front door closed,\r\nEdith looked at her father. This must be rather serious, Roger thought\r\nexcitedly. So Laura was to stay all night, while Deborah gallivanted off to\r\nthose infernal schools of hers! He had little joy in his paper that night.\r\nThe news of the world had such a trick of suddenly receding a million miles\r\naway from a man the minute he was in trouble. And Roger was in trouble.\r\nWith each slow tick of the clock in the hall he grew more certain and more\r\ndisturbed. An hour passed. The clock struck nine. With a snort he tossed\r\nhis paper aside.\r\n\r\n"Well, Edith," he said glumly, "how about some chess this evening?" In\r\nanswer she gave him a quick smile of understanding and sympathy.\r\n\r\n"All right, father dear." And she fetched the board. But they had played\r\nonly a short time when Deborah\'s latchkey was heard in the door. Roger gave\r\nan angry hitch to his chair. Soon she appeared in the doorway.\r\n\r\n"May I talk to you, father?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so." Roger scowled.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll excuse us, Edith?" she added.\r\n\r\n"Oh, assuredly, dear." And Edith rose, looking very much hurt. "Of course,\r\nif I\'m not needed--"\r\n\r\nAt this her father scowled again. Why couldn\'t Deborah show her sister a\r\nlittle consideration?\r\n\r\n"What is it?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we go into the study," she said.\r\n\r\nHe followed her there and shut the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Well?" he asked, from his big leather chair. Deborah had remained\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got some bad news," she began.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" he snapped. "School burnt down?" Savagely he bit off a\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just had a talk with Harold," she told him. He shot a glance of\r\nsurprise and dismay.\r\n\r\n"Have, eh--what\'s it all about?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s about a divorce," she answered.\r\n\r\nThe lighted match dropped from Roger\'s hand. He snatched it up before it\r\nwas out and lit his cigar, and puffing smoke in a vigilant way again he\r\neyed his daughter.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve done what I could," she said painfully, "but they seem to have made\r\nup their minds."\r\n\r\n"Then they\'ll unmake \'em," he replied, and he leaned forward heavily.\r\n"They\'ll unmake \'em," he repeated, in a thick unnatural tone. "I\'m not\r\na\'goin\' to hear to it!" In a curious manner his voice had changed. It\r\nsounded like that of a man in the mountains, where he had been born and\r\nraised. This thought flashed into Deborah\'s mind and her wide resolute\r\nmouth set hard. It would be very difficult.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid this won\'t do, father dear. Whether you give your consent or\r\nnot--"\r\n\r\n"Wun\'t, wun\'t it! You wait and see if it wun\'t!" Deborah came close to him.\r\n\r\n"Suppose you wait till you understand," she admonished sternly.\r\n\r\n"All right, I\'m waiting," he replied. She felt herself trembling deep\r\ninside. She did not want him to understand, any more than she must to\r\ninduce him to keep out of this affair.\r\n\r\n"To begin with," she said steadily, "you will soon see yourself, I think,\r\nthat they fairly loathe the sight of each other--that there is no real\r\nmarriage left."\r\n\r\n"That\'s fiddlesticks!" snapped Roger. "Just modern talk and new\r\nideas--ideas you\'re to blame for! Yes, you are--you put \'em in her\r\nhead--you and your gabble about woman\'s rights!" He was angry now. He was\r\nglad he was angry. He\'d just begun!\r\n\r\n"If you want me to leave her alone," his daughter cut in sharply, "just say\r\nso! I\'ll leave it all to you!" And she saw him flinch a little. "What would\r\nbe _your_ idea?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"My idea? She\'s to go straight home and make up with him!"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. Then she said:\r\n\r\n"Suppose there\'s another woman."\r\n\r\n"Then he\'s a beast," growled Roger.\r\n\r\n"And yet you want her to live with him?"\r\n\r\nHe scowled, he felt baffled, his mind in a whirl. And a wave of\r\nexasperation suddenly swept over him.\r\n\r\n"Well, why shouldn\'t she?" he cried. "Other wives have done it--millions!\r\nMade a devilish good success of it, too--made new men of their husbands!\r\nLet her show him she\'s ready to forgive! That\'s only Christian, ain\'t it?\r\nHard? Of course it\'s hard on her! But can you tell me one hard thing she\r\nhas ever had to do in her life? Hasn\'t it been pleasure, pleasure from the\r\nword go? Can\'t she stand something hard? Don\'t we all of us have to? I\r\ndo--God knows--with all of you!" And he puffed his cigar in a fury. His\r\ndaughter smiled. She saw her chance.\r\n\r\n"Father," she said, in a low clear voice, "You\'ve had so _many_ troubles.\r\nWhy not leave this one to me? You can\'t help--no matter how hard you\r\ntry--you\'ll only make it worse and worse. And you\'ve been through so much\r\nthis year--you\'ve earned the right to be quiet. And that\'s what _they_\r\nwant, both of them--they both want it quiet, without any scandal." Her\r\nfather glared, for he knew about scandal, he handled it in his office each\r\nday. "Let me manage this--please," she said. And her offer tempted him. He\r\nstruggled for a moment.\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t!" he burst out in reply. "I want quiet right enough, but not\r\nat the price of her peace with her God!" This sounded foolish, he felt\r\nthat it did, and he flushed and grew the angrier. "No, I won\'t," he said\r\nstubbornly. "She\'ll go back to him if I take her myself. And what\'s more,"\r\nhe added, rising, "she\'s to go straight back to-night!"\r\n\r\n"She is not going back to-night, my dear." And Deborah caught her father\'s\r\narm. "Sit down, please--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve heard enough!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you haven\'t," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Very well." His smile was caustic. "Give me some more of it," he said.\r\n\r\n"Her husband won\'t have her," said Deborah bluntly. "He told me so\r\nhimself--to-night."\r\n\r\n"Did, eh--then _I\'ll_ talk to him!"\r\n\r\n"He thinks," she went on in a desperate tone, "that Laura has been\r\nleading--\'her own little life\'--as he put it to me."\r\n\r\n"_Eh_?"\r\n\r\n"He is bringing suit himself."\r\n\r\n"_Oh! He is_!" cried Roger hoarsely. "Then I _will_ talk to this young\r\nman!" But she put out a restraining hand:\r\n\r\n"Father! Don\'t try to fight this suit!"\r\n\r\n"You watch me!" he snarled. Tears showed in her eyes:\r\n\r\n"Think! Oh, please! Think what you\'re doing! Have you ever seen a\r\ndivorce-court--here, in New York? Do you know what it\'s like? What it _can_\r\nbe like?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Roger panted. He did know, and the picture came vividly into his\r\nmind--a mass of eager devouring eyes fixed on a girl in a witness chair.\r\n"To-morrow I see a lawyer!" he said.\r\n\r\n"No--you won\'t do that, my dear," Deborah told him sadly. "Laura\'s husband\r\nhas got proofs."\r\n\r\nHer father looked up slowly and glared into his daughter\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen them myself," she added. "And Laura has admitted it, too."\r\n\r\nStill for a moment he stared at her. Then slowly he settled back in his\r\nchair, his eyes dropped in their sockets, and very carefully, with a hand\r\nwhich was trembling visibly, he lifted his cigar to his lips. It had gone\r\nnearly out, but he drew on it hard until it began to glow again.\r\n\r\n"Well," he asked simply, "what shall we do?"\r\n\r\nSharply Deborah turned away. To be quiet, to be matter of fact, to act as\r\nthough nothing had happened at all--she knew this was what he wanted now,\r\nwhat he was silently begging her to be for his sake, for the family\'s sake.\r\nFor he had been raised in New England. And so, when she turned back to him,\r\nher voice was flat and commonplace.\r\n\r\n"Keep her here," she said. "Let him do what he likes. There\'ll be nothing\r\nnoisy, he promised me that. But keep her here till it\'s over."\r\n\r\nRoger smoked for a moment, and said,\r\n\r\n"There\'s Edith and her children."\r\n\r\n"The children needn\'t know anything--and Edith only part of it."\r\n\r\n"The less, the better," he grunted.\r\n\r\n"Of course." She looked at him anxiously. This tractable mood of his might\r\nnot last. "Why not go up and see her now--and get it all over--so you can\r\nsleep."\r\n\r\nOver Roger\'s set heavy visage flitted a smile of grim relish at that.\r\nSleep! Deborah was funny. Resolutely he rose from his chair.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be careful, of course," she admonished him, and he nodded in reply.\r\nAt the door he turned back:\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the other chap?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she answered. "Surely you don\'t want to see _him_--." Her\r\nfather snorted his contempt:\r\n\r\n"See him? No. Nor she neither. _She\'s_ not to see him. Understand?"\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t tell her that to-night."\r\n\r\n"Look here." Roger eyed his daughter a moment.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve done well. I\'ve no complaint. But don\'t try to manage everything."\r\n\r\nHe went out and slowly climbed the stairs. Outside the bedroom door he\r\npaused. When had he stood like this before? In a moment he remembered. One\r\nevening some two years ago, the night before Laura\'s wedding, when they had\r\nhad that other talk. And so it had come to this, had it. Well, there was no\r\nuse making a scene. Again, with a sigh of weariness, Laura\'s father knocked\r\nat her door.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Deborah," she said.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t Deborah, it\'s I." There was a little silence.\r\n\r\n"Very well, father, come in, please." Her voice sounded tired and lifeless.\r\nHe opened the door and found the room dark. "I\'m over on the bed," she\r\nsaid. "I\'ve had a headache this evening."\r\n\r\nHe came over to the bedside and he could just see her there, a long shadow\r\nupon the white. She had not taken off her clothes. He stood a moment\r\nhelplessly.\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t _you_ talk to me!" His daughter fiercely whispered. "I can\'t\r\nstand any more to-night!"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t," he answered. "It\'s too late." Again there was a pause.\r\n\r\n"What time is it?" she asked him. But he did not answer.\r\n\r\n"Well, Laura," he said presently, "your sister has told me everything. She\r\nhas seen your husband--it\'s all arranged--and you\'re to stay here till it\'s\r\nover ... You want to stay here, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s settled," he went on. "There\'s only one thing--the other man. I\r\ndon\'t know who he is and I don\'t want to know. And I don\'t want you to know\r\nhim again. You\'re not to see him. Understand?" For a moment Laura was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to marry him, father," she said. And standing in the darkened\r\nroom Roger stiffened sharply.\r\n\r\n"Well," he answered, after a pause, "that\'s your affair. You\'re no longer a\r\nchild. I wish you were," he added.\r\n\r\nSuddenly in the darkness Laura\'s hand came out clutching for his. But he\r\nhad already turned to the door.\r\n\r\n"Good-night," he said, and left her.\r\n\r\nIn the hallway below he met Deborah, and to her questioning look he\r\nreplied, "All right, I guess. Now I\'m going to bed." He went into his room\r\nand closed the door.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Roger was alone, he knew this was the hardest part--to be here\r\nby himself in this intimate room, with this worn blue rug, these pictures\r\nand this old mahogany bed. For he had promised Judith his wife to keep\r\nclose to the children. What would she think of him if she knew?\r\n\r\nJudith had been a broad-minded woman, sensible, big-hearted. But she never\r\nwould have stood for this. Once, he recollected, she had helped a girl\r\nfriend to divorce her husband, a drunkard who ran after chorus girls. But\r\nthat had been quite different. There the wife had been innocent and had\r\ndone it for her children. Laura was guilty, she hadn\'t a child, she was\r\nalready planning to marry again. And then what, he asked himself. "From bad\r\nto worse, very likely. A woman can\'t stop when she\'s started downhill." His\r\neye was caught by the picture directly before him on the wall--the one his\r\nwife had given him--two herdsmen with their cattle high up on a shoulder of\r\na sweeping mountain side, tiny blue figures against the dawn. It had been\r\nlike a symbol of their lives, always beginning clean glorious days. What\r\nwas Laura beginning?\r\n\r\n"Well," he demanded angrily, as he began to jerk off his clothes, "what can\r\nI do about it? Try to keep her from re-marrying, eh? And suppose I\r\nsucceeded, how long would it last? She wouldn\'t stay here and I couldn\'t\r\nkeep her. She\'ll be independent now--her looks will be her bank account.\r\nThere\'d be some other chap in no time, and he might not even marry her!" He\r\ntugged ferociously at his boots. "No, let well enough alone!"\r\n\r\nHe finished undressing, opened the window, turned out the gas and got into\r\nbed. Wearily he closed his eyes. But after a time he opened them and stared\r\nlong through the window up at the beetling cliff of a building close by,\r\nwith its tier upon tier of lighted apartments, a huge garish hive of homes.\r\nYes, the town was crowding down on him to-night, on his house and on his\r\nfamily. He realized it had never stopped, and that his three grown\r\nchildren, each one of them a part of himself, had been struggling with it\r\nall the time. Laura--wasn\'t she part of himself? Hadn\'t he, too, had his\r\nlittle fling, back in his early twenties? "You will live on in our\r\nchildren\'s lives." She was a part of him gone wild. She gave it free rein,\r\ntook chances. God, what a chance she had taken this time! The picture of\r\nthat court he had seen, with the girl in the witness chair and those many\r\nrows of eyes avidly fixed upon her, came back to his mind so vividly they\r\nseemed for a moment right here in the room, these eyes of the town boring\r\ninto his house. Angrily he shut out the scene. And alone in the darkness,\r\nRoger said to his daughter all the ugly furious things he had not said to\r\nher upstairs--until at last he was weary of it.\r\n\r\n"Why am I working myself all up? I\'ve got to take this. It\'s my medicine."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as he watched Laura in the house, Roger\'s first emotions were\r\ncomplicated more and more by a feeling of bewilderment. At dinner the next\r\nevening he noticed with astonishment that she appeared like her natural\r\nself. "She\'s acting," he decided. But this explanation he soon dismissed.\r\nNo, it was something deeper. She was actually unashamed, unafraid. That\r\nfirst display of feelings, the night of her arrival, had been only the\r\nscare of an hour. Within a few days she was back on her feet; and her cure\r\nfor her trouble, if trouble she felt, was not less but more pleasure, as\r\nalways. She went out nearly every evening now; and when she had spent what\r\nmoney she had, she sold a part of her jewelry to the little old Galician\r\nJew in the shop around the corner. Yes, she was her natural self. And she\r\nwas as before to her father. Her attitude said plainly,\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t fair to you, poor dear, to expect you to fully understand how\r\nright I am in this affair. And considering your point of view, you\'re\r\nacting very nicely."\r\n\r\nOften as she talked to him a note of good-humored forgiveness crept into\r\nhis daughter\'s voice. And looking at her grimly out of the corner of his\r\neye, he saw that she looked down on him, far, far down from heights above.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he thought, "this is modern." Then he grew angry all at once. "No,"\r\nhe added, "this is wrong! You can\'t fool me, young woman, you know it as\r\nwell as I do myself! You\'re not going to carry this off with an air--not\r\nwith your father! No, by George!"\r\n\r\nAnd he would grow abrupt and stern. But days would pass and in spite of\r\nhimself into their talks would creep a natural friendly tone. Again he\r\nfound himself friends with her--friends as though nothing whatever had\r\nhappened! Could it be that a woman who had so sinned could go right on?\r\nHere was Laura, serenely unconscious of guilt, and smiling into her future,\r\ndreaming still of happiness, quite plainly sure of it, in fact! With a\r\ncurious dismayed relief Roger would scowl at this daughter of his--a\r\nradiant enigma in his quiet sober house.\r\n\r\nBut Edith was not at all perplexed. When she learned from Deborah that\r\nthere was soon to be a divorce, she came at once to her father. Her face\r\nwas like a thundercloud.\r\n\r\n"A nice example for my children!" she indignantly exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, my dear. But what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"You can make her go back to her husband, can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t," he flatly replied.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'d better try it myself!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll do no such thing!" he retorted. "I\'ve gone clear to the bottom of\r\nthis--and I say you\'re to leave her alone!"\r\n\r\n"Very well," she answered. And she did leave her sister alone, so severely\r\nthat Laura soon avoided being home for lunch or dinner. She had taken the\r\nroom which George had occupied ever since John had been turned out, and\r\nthere she breakfasted late in bed, until Edith put a stop to it. They\r\nbarely spoke to each other now. Laura still smiled defiance.\r\n\r\nDays passed. Christmas came at last, and despite Edith\'s glum resolution to\r\nmake it a happy time for the children, the happiness soon petered out.\r\nAfter the tree in the morning, the day hung heavy on the house. Roger\r\nburied himself in his study. Laura had motored off into the country with a\r\ngay party of her friends. Or was this just a ruse, he wondered, and was\r\nshe spending the day with her lover? Well, what if she was? Could he lock\r\nher in?\r\n\r\nAbout twilight he thought he heard her return, and later from his bedroom\r\nhe heard her voice and Edith\'s. Both voices sounded angry, but he would not\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\nAt the Christmas dinner that evening Laura did not put in an appearance,\r\nbut Edith sat stiff and silent there; and despite the obvious efforts which\r\nDeborah and Allan made to be genial with the children, the very air in the\r\nroom was charged with the feeling of trouble close ahead. Again Roger\r\nretreated into his den, and presently Laura came to him.\r\n\r\n"Good-night--I\'m going out," she said, and she pressed her cheek lightly to\r\nhis own. "What a dear you\'ve been to me, dad," she murmured. And then she\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Edith came in. She held a small note in her hand, which\r\nRoger saw was addressed to himself.\r\n\r\n"Well, father, I learned this afternoon what you\'ve been keeping from me,"\r\nshe said. Roger gave her a steady look.\r\n\r\n"You did, eh--Laura told you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she did!" his daughter exclaimed. "And I can\'t help wondering,\r\nfather--"\r\n\r\n"Why did she tell you? Have you been at her again to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Again? Not at all," she answered. "I\'ve done as you asked me to, let her\r\nalone. But to-day--mother\'s day--I got thinking of _her_."\r\n\r\n"Leave your mother out of it, please. What did you say to Laura?"\r\n\r\n"I tried to make her go back, of course--"\r\n\r\n"And she told you--"\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t have her! And then in a perfect tantrum she went on to tell me\r\nwhy!" Edith\'s eyes were cold with disgust. "And I\'m wondering why you let\r\nher stay here--in the same house with my children!"\r\n\r\nRoger reached out his hand.\r\n\r\n"Give me that note," he commanded. He read it quickly and handed it back.\r\nThe note was from Laura, a hasty good-bye.\r\n\r\n"Edith will explain," she wrote, "and you will see I cannot stay any\r\nlonger. It is simply too impossible. I am going to the man I love--and in a\r\nfew days we shall sail for Naples. I know you will not interfere. It will\r\nmake the divorce even simpler and everything easier all round. Please don\'t\r\nworry about me. We shall soon be married over there. You have been so dear\r\nand sensible and I do so love you for it." Then came her name scrawled\r\nhastily. And at the bottom of the page: "I have paid every bill I can think\r\nof."\r\n\r\nEdith read it in silence, her color slowly mounting.\r\n\r\n"All right," said her father, "your children are safe." She gave him a\r\nquick angry look, burst into tears and ran out of the room.\r\n\r\nRoger sat without moving, his heavy face impassive. And so he remained for\r\na long time. Well, _Laura_ was gone--no mistake about that--and this time\r\nshe was gone for good. She was going to live in Rome. Try to stop her? No.\r\nWhat good would it do? Wings of the Eagles, Rome reborn. That was it, she\r\nhad hit it, struck the keynote of this new age. Rome reborn, all clean,\r\nold-fashioned Christian living swept away by millions of men at each\r\nothers\' throats like so many wolves. And at last quite openly to himself\r\nRoger admitted that he felt old. Old and beaten, out of date. Moments\r\npassed, and hours--he took little note of time. Nor did he see on the\r\nmantle the dark visage of "The Thinker" there, resting on the huge clinched\r\nfist and brooding down upon him. Lower, imperceptibly, he sank into his\r\nleather chair.\r\n\r\nQuiet had returned to his house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the quiet was dark to Roger now. Each night he spent in his study\r\nalone, for instinctively he felt the need of being by himself for a while,\r\nof keeping away from his children--out of whose lives he divined that other\r\nevents would soon come forth to use up the last of the strength that was in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd Roger grew angry with the world. Why couldn\'t it let a man alone, an\r\nold man in a silent house alive for him with memories? Repeatedly in such\r\nhours his mind would go groping backward into the years behind him. What a\r\nlong and winding road, half buried in the jungle, dim, almost impenetrable,\r\nmade up of millions of small events, small worries, plans and dazzling\r\ndreams, with which his days had all been filled. But the more he recalled\r\nthe more certain he grew that he was right. Life had never been like this:\r\nthe world had never come smashing into his house, his very family, with its\r\ndirty teeming tenements, its schools, its prisons, electric chairs, its\r\nfeverish rush for money, its luxuries, its scandals. These things had\r\nexisted in the world, but remote and never real, mere things which he had\r\nread about. War? Did he not remember wars that had come and gone in Europe?\r\nBut they hadn\'t come into his home like this, first making him poor when he\r\nneeded money for Edith and her children, then plunging Deborah into a\r\nstruggle which might very probably ruin her life, and now taking Laura and\r\nfilling her mind with thoughts of pagan living. Why was every man, woman\r\nand child, these days, bound up in the whole life of the world? What would\r\ncome of it all? A new day out of this deafening night? Maybe so. But for\r\nhim it would come too late.\r\n\r\n"What have I left to live for?"\r\n\r\nOne night with a sigh he went to his desk, lit a cigar and laid his hand\r\nupon a pile of letters which had been mounting steadily. It was made up of\r\nLaura\'s bills, the ones she had not remembered. Send them after her to Rome\r\nfor that Italian fellow to pay? No, it could not be thought of. Roger\r\nturned to his dwindling bank account. He was not yet making money, he was\r\nstill losing a little each week. But he would not cut expenses. To the few\r\nwho were left in his employ, to be turned away would mean dire need. And\r\nangrily he determined that they should not starve to pay Laura\'s bills.\r\n"The world for the strong, eh? Not in my office!" In Rome or Berlin or\r\nVienna, all right! But not over here!\r\n\r\nGrimly, when he had made out the checks, Roger eyed his balance. By spring\r\nhe would be penniless. And he had no one to turn to now, no rich young\r\nson-in-law who could aid.\r\n\r\nHe set himself doggedly to the task of forcing up his business, and\r\nmeanwhile in the evenings he tried with Edith to get back upon their former\r\nfooting. To do this was not easy at first, for his bitterness still rankled\r\ndeep: "When you were in trouble I took you in, but when she was in trouble\r\nyou turned her out, as you turned out John before her." In the room again\r\nvacated, young George had been reinstalled. One night Edith found her\r\nfather there looking in through the open doorway, and the look on his\r\nmassive face was hard.\r\n\r\n"Better have the room disinfected again," he muttered when he saw her. He\r\nturned and went slowly down the stairs. And she was late for dinner that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nBut Edith had her children. And as he watched her night by night hearing\r\ntheir lessons patiently, reading them fairy stories and holding them\r\nsmilingly in her arms, the old appeal of her motherhood regained its hold\r\nupon him. One evening when the clock struck nine, putting down his paper he\r\nsuggested gruffly,\r\n\r\n"Well, daughter, how about some chess?"\r\n\r\nEdith flushed a little:\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, dear, I\'d be glad to."\r\n\r\nShe rose and went to get the board. So the games were resumed, and part at\r\nleast of their old affection came to life. But only a part. It could never\r\nbe quite the same again.\r\n\r\nAnd though he saw little of Deborah, slowly, almost unawares to them both,\r\nshe assumed the old place she had had in his home--as the one who had been\r\nright here in the house through all the years since her mother had died,\r\nthe one who had helped and never asked help, keeping her own troubles to\r\nherself. He fell back into his habit of going before dinner to his\r\ndaughter\'s bedroom door to ask whether she would be home that night. At one\r\nsuch time, getting no response and thinking Deborah was not there, he\r\nopened the door part way to make sure. And he saw her at her dresser,\r\nstaring at herself in the glass, rigid as though in a trance. Later in the\r\ndining room he heard her step upon the stairs. She came in quietly and sat\r\ndown; and as soon as dinner was over, she said her good-nights and left the\r\nhouse. But when she came home at midnight, he was waiting up for her. He\r\nhad foraged in the kitchen, and on his study table he had set out some\r\nsupper. While she sat there eating, her father watched her from his chair.\r\n\r\n"Things going badly in school?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she replied. There was silence.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong?"\r\n\r\n"To-night we had a line of mothers reaching out into the street. They had\r\ncome for food and coal--but we had to send most of them home empty-handed.\r\nSome of them cried--and one of them fainted. She\'s to have a baby soon."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you get any money uptown?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I have," she answered grimly. "I\'ve been a beggar--heaven knows--on every\r\nfriend I can think of. And I\'ve kept a press agent hard at work trying to\r\nmake the public see that Belgium is right here in New York." She stopped\r\nand went on with her supper. "But it\'s a bad time for work like mine," she\r\ncontinued presently. "If we\'re to keep it going we must above all keep it\r\ncheap. That\'s the keynote these days, keep everything cheap--at any\r\ncost--so that men can expensively kill one another." Her voice had a bitter\r\nring to it. "You try to talk peace and they bowl you over, with facts on\r\nthe need of preparedness--for the defence of your country. And that doesn\'t\r\nappeal to me very much. I want a bigger preparedness--for the defence of\r\nthe whole world--for democracy, and human rights, no matter who the people\r\nare! I\'d like to train every child to that!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" her father asked.\r\n\r\n"To teach him what his life can be!" she replied in a hard quivering tone.\r\n"A fight? Oh yes! So long as he lives--and even with guns if it must be so!\r\nBut a fight for all the people on earth!--and a world so full of happy\r\nlives that men will think hard--before ever again letting themselves be led\r\nby the nose--into war and death--for a place in the sun!" She rose from her\r\nchair, with a weary smile: "Here I am making a speech again. I\'ve made so\r\nmany lately it\'s become a habit. I\'m tired out, dad, I\'m going to bed." Her\r\nfather looked at her anxiously.\r\n\r\n"You\'re seeing things out of proportion," he said. "You\'ve worked so hard\r\nyou\'re getting stale. You ought to get out of it for a while."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t!" she answered sharply. "You don\'t know--you don\'t even guess--how\r\nit takes every hour--all the demands!"\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Allan these days?"\r\n\r\n"Working," was her harsh reply. "Trying to keep his hospital going with\r\nhalf its staff. The woman who was backing him is giving her money to\r\nBelgium instead."\r\n\r\n"Do you see much of him?"\r\n\r\n"Every day. Let\'s drop it. Shall we?"\r\n\r\n"All right, my dear--"\r\n\r\nAnd they said good-night ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, in the house, Edith had tried to scrimp and save, but it\r\nwas very difficult. Her children had so many needs, they were all growing\r\nup so fast. Each month brought fresh demands on her purse, and the fund\r\nfrom the sale of her belongings had been used up long ago. Her sole\r\nresource was the modest allowance her father gave her for running the\r\nhouse, and she had not asked him for more. She had put off trouble from\r\nmonth to month. But one evening early in March, when he gave her the\r\nregular monthly check, she said hesitatingly:\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry, father dear, but I\'m afraid we\'ll need more money this\r\nmonth." He glanced up from his paper:\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" She gave him a forced little smile, and her father\r\nnoticed the gray in her hair.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing in particular. Goodness knows I\'ve tried to keep down\r\nexpenses, but--well, we\'re a pretty large household, you know--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Roger kindly, "I know. Are the month\'s bills in?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Let me see them." She brought him the bills and he looked relieved. "Not\r\nso many," he ventured.\r\n\r\n"No, but they\'re large."\r\n\r\n"Why, look here, Edith," he said abruptly, "these are bills for two\r\nmonths--some for three, even four!"\r\n\r\n"I know--that\'s just the trouble. I couldn\'t meet them at the time."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tell me?"\r\n\r\n"Laura was here--and I didn\'t want to bother you--you had enough on your\r\nmind as it was. I\'ve done the best I could, father dear--I\'ve sold\r\neverything, you know--but I\'ve about come to the end of my rope." And her\r\nmanner said clearly, "I\'ve done my part. I\'m only a woman. I\'ll have to\r\nleave the rest to you."\r\n\r\n"I see--I see." And Roger knitted his heavy brows. "I presume I can get it\r\nsomehow." This would play the very devil with things!\r\n\r\n"Father." Edith\'s voice was low. "Why don\'t you let Deborah help you? She\r\ndoes very little, it seems to me--compared to the size of her salary."\r\n\r\n"She can\'t do any more than she\'s doing now," was his decisive answer.\r\nEdith looked at him, her color high. She hesitated, then burst out:\r\n\r\n"I saw her check book the other day, she had left it on the table! She\'s\r\nspending thousands--every month!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s not her own money," Roger said.\r\n\r\n"No--it\'s money she gets for her fads--her work for those tenement\r\nchildren! She can get money enough for _them!_" He flung out his hand:\r\n\r\n"Leave her out of this, please!"\r\n\r\n"Very well, father, just as you say." And she sat there hurt and silent\r\nwhile again he looked slowly through the bills. He jotted down figures and\r\nadded them up. They came to a bit over nine hundred dollars. Soon Deborah\'s\r\nkey was heard in the door, and Roger scowled the deeper. She came into the\r\nroom, but he did not look up. He heard her voice:\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, Edith?"\r\n\r\n"Bills for the house."\r\n\r\n"Oh." And Deborah came to her father. "May I see what\'s the trouble, dear?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather you wouldn\'t. It\'s nothing," he growled. He wanted her to keep\r\nout of this.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t she see?" Edith tartly inquired. "Deborah is living\r\nhere--and before I came she ran the house. In her place I should certainly\r\nwant to know."\r\n\r\nDeborah was already glancing rapidly over the bills.\r\n\r\n"Why, Edith," she exclaimed, "most of these bills go back for months. Why\r\ndidn\'t you pay them when they were due?"\r\n\r\n"Simply because I hadn\'t the money!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve had the regular monthly amount."\r\n\r\n"That didn\'t last long--"\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tell us?"\r\n\r\n"Laura was here."\r\n\r\nDeborah gave a shrug of impatience, and Roger saw how tired she was, her\r\nnerves on edge from her long day.\r\n\r\n"Never mind about it now," he put in.\r\n\r\n"What a pity," Deborah muttered. "If we had been told, we could have cut\r\ndown."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t agree with you!" Edith rejoined. "I have already done that myself!\r\nI\'ve done nothing else!"\r\n\r\n"Have the servants been paid?" her sister asked.\r\n\r\n"No, they haven\'t-"\r\n\r\n"Since when?"\r\n\r\n"Three months!"\r\n\r\nRoger got up and walked the room. Deborah tried to speak quietly:\r\n\r\n"I can\'t quite see where the money has gone."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you? Then look at my check book." And Edith produced it with a\r\nglare. Her sister turned over a few of the stubs.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this item?"\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"Here. A hundred and twenty-two dollars."\r\n\r\n"The dentist," Edith answered. "Not extravagant, is it--for five children?"\r\n\r\n"I see," said Deborah. "And this?"\r\n\r\n"Bedding," was Edith\'s sharp response. "A mattress and more blankets. I\r\nfound there weren\'t half enough in the house."\r\n\r\n"You burned John\'s, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally!"\r\n\r\nAll at once both grew ashamed.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s be sensible," Deborah said. "We must do something, Edith--and we\r\ncan\'t till we\'re certain where we stand."\r\n\r\n"Very well--"\r\n\r\nThey went on more calmly and took up the items one by one. Deborah finished\r\nand was silent.\r\n\r\n"Well, father, what\'s to be done?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he answered shortly.\r\n\r\n"Somehow or other," Deborah said, "we\'ve got to cut our expenses down."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid that\'s impossible," Edith rejoined. "I\'ve already cut as much\r\nas I can."\r\n\r\n"So did I, in my school," said her sister. "And when I thought I had\r\nreached the end, I called in an expert. And he showed me ways of saving I\r\nhad never dreamed of."\r\n\r\n"What kind of expert would you advise here?" Edith\'s small lip curled in\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\n"Domestic science, naturally--I have a woman who does nothing else. She\r\nshows women in their homes just how to make money count the most."\r\n\r\n"What women? And what homes? Tenements?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. She\'s one of my teachers."\r\n\r\n"Thank you!" said Edith indignantly. "But I don\'t care to have my children\r\nbrought down to tenement standards!"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to _have_ them! But I know she could show you a great many\r\nthings you can buy for less!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I shouldn\'t agree with her!"\r\n\r\n"Why not, Edith?"\r\n\r\n"Because she knows only tenement children--nothing of children bred like\r\nmine!"\r\n\r\nDeborah drew a quick short breath, her brows drew tight and she looked\r\naway. She bit her lip, controlled herself:\r\n\r\n"Very well, I\'ll try again. This house is plenty large enough so that by a\r\nlittle crowding we could make room for somebody else. And I know a teacher\r\nin one of my schools who\'d be only too glad--"\r\n\r\n"Take a boarder, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do! We\'ve got to do something!"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\nDeborah threw up her hands:\r\n\r\n"All right, Edith, I\'m through," she said. "Now what do you propose?"\r\n\r\n"I can try to do without Hannah again--"\r\n\r\n"That will be hard--on all of us. But I guess you\'ll have to."\r\n\r\n"So it seems."\r\n\r\n"But unfortunately that won\'t he enough."\r\n\r\nEdith\'s face grew tenser:\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it will have to be--just now--I\'ve had about all I can stand\r\nfor one night!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry," Deborah answered. For a moment they confronted each other. And\r\nEdith\'s look said to Deborah plainly, "You\'re spending thousands,\r\nthousands, on those tenement children! You can get money enough for them,\r\nbut you won\'t raise a hand to help with mine!" And as plainly Deborah\r\nanswered, "My children are starving, shivering, freezing! What do yours\r\nknow about being poor?" Two mothers, each with a family, and each one\r\nbaffled, brought to bay. There was something so insatiable in each angry\r\nmother\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'d better leave this to me," said Roger very huskily. And both\r\nhis daughters turned with a start, as though in their bitter absorption\r\nthey had forgotten his presence there. Both flushed, and now the glances of\r\nall three in that room avoided each other. For they felt how sordid it had\r\nbeen. Deborah turned to her sister.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, Edith," she said again, and this time there were tears in her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"So am I," said Edith unsteadily, and in a moment she left the room.\r\nDeborah stood watching her father.\r\n\r\n"I\'m ashamed of myself," she said. "Well? Shall we talk it over?"\r\n\r\n"No," he replied. "I can manage it somehow, Deborah, and I prefer that you\r\nleave it to me."\r\n\r\nRoger went into his study and sank grimly into his chair. Yes, it had been\r\npretty bad; it had been ugly, ominous. He took paper and pencil and set to\r\nwork. How he had come to hate this job of wrestling with figures. Of the\r\nfive thousand dollars borrowed in August he had barely a thousand left. The\r\nfirst semi-annual interest was due next week and must be paid. The balance\r\nwould carry them through March and on well into April. By that time he\r\nhoped to be making money, for business was better every week. But what of\r\nthis nine hundred dollars in debts? Half at least must be paid at once.\r\nLower and lower he sank in his chair. But a few moments later, his blunt\r\nheavy visage cleared, and with a little sigh of relief he put away his\r\npapers, turned out the lights and went upstairs. The dark house felt\r\nfriendly and comforting now.\r\n\r\nIn his room he opened the safe in the corner where his collection of\r\ncurious rings had lain unnoticed for many months. He drew out a tray, sat\r\ndown by the light and began to look them over. At first only small\r\ninanimate objects, gradually as from tray after tray they glittered duskily\r\nup at him, they began to yield their riches as they had so often done\r\nbefore. Spanish, French, Italian, Bohemian, Hungarian, Russian and Arabian,\r\nrings small and rings enormous, religious rings and magic rings, poison\r\nrings, some black with age for all his careful polishing--again they\r\nstole deep into Roger\'s imagination with suggestions of the many hands that\r\nhad worn them through the centuries, of women kneeling in old churches,\r\ncouples in dark crooked streets, adventures, love, hate, jealousy. Youth\r\nand fire, dreams and passion....\r\n\r\nAt last he remembered why he was here. He thought of possible purchasers.\r\nHe knew so many dealers, but he knew, too, that the war had played the\r\ndevil with them as with everyone else. Still, he thought of several who\r\nwould find it hard to resist the temptation. He would see them to-morrow,\r\none by one, and get them bidding, haggling. Roger frowned disgustedly.\r\n\r\nNo help for it, though, and it was a relief. It would bring a truce in his\r\nhouse for a time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the truce was brief.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon when he sold his collection Roger came home all out of\r\nsorts. He had been forced to haggle long; it had been a mean inglorious\r\nday; one of the brightest paths in his life had ended in a pigstie. But at\r\nleast he had bought some peace in his home! Women, women, women! He shut\r\nthe front door with a slam and went up to his room for a little rest, a\r\nlittle of what he had paid for! On the stairs he passed young Betsy, and he\r\nstartled the girl by the sudden glare of reproach he bestowed upon her.\r\nSavagely he told himself he was no "feminist" that night!\r\n\r\nThe brief talk he had with Edith was far from reassuring. With no Deborah\r\nthere to wound her pride, Edith quickly showed herself friendly to her\r\nfather; but when he advised her to keep her nurse, she at once refused to\r\nconsider it.\r\n\r\n"I want you to," he persisted, with an anxious note in his voice. He had\r\ntried life without Hannah here and he did not care to try it again.\r\n\r\n"It is already settled, father, I sent her away this morning."\r\n\r\n"Then you get her right back!" he exclaimed. But Edith\'s face grew\r\nobstinate.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care to give Deborah," she replied, "another chance to talk as she\r\ndid."\r\n\r\nRoger looked at her gloomily. "You will, though," he was thinking. "You two\r\nhave only just begun. Let any little point arise, which a couple of men\r\nwould settle offhand, and you two will get together and go it! There\'ll be\r\nno living in the house!"\r\n\r\nWith deepening displeasure he watched the struggle between them go on.\r\nSometimes it seemed to Roger there was not a topic he could bring up which\r\nwould not in some way bring on a clash. One night in desperation he\r\nproposed the theatre.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid we can\'t afford it," said Edith, glancing at Deborah. And she\r\nhad the same answer, again and again, for the requests her children made,\r\nif they involved but the smallest expense. "No, dear, I\'m afraid we can\'t\r\nafford that," she would say gently, with a sigh. And under this constant\r\npressure, these nightly little thrusts and jabs, Deborah would grow rigid\r\nwith annoyance and impatience.\r\n\r\n"For Heaven\'s sake, Edith," she burst out, one night when the children had\r\ngone to their lessons, "can you think of nothing on earth, except your own\r\nlittle family?"\r\n\r\n"Here it comes again," thought Roger, scowling into his paper. He heard\r\nEdith\'s curt reply:\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t, not nowadays. Nobody _else_ seems to think of them."\r\n\r\n"You mean that I don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Do you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes! I\'m thinking of George! Do you want him killed in the trenches--in a\r\nwar with Germany or Japan?"\r\n\r\n"Are you utterly mad?" demanded Edith.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m awake--my eyes are open! But yours are shut so tight, my dear, you\r\ncan\'t see what has happened! You know this war has made us poor and your\r\nown life harder, but that\'s all. The big thing it has done you know nothing\r\nabout!"\r\n\r\n"Suppose you teach me," Edith said, with a prim provoking little smile.\r\nDeborah turned on her angrily:\r\n\r\n"It has shown that all such mothers as you are out of date and have got to\r\nchange! That we\'re bound together--all over the world--whether we like it\r\nor whether we don\'t! And that if we want to keep out of war, we\'ve got to\r\ndo it by coming right out of our own little homes--_and thinking, Edith,\r\nthinking!_"\r\n\r\n"Votes for women," Edith said. Deborah looked at her, rose with a shrug.\r\n\r\n"All right, Edith, I give up."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. I\'m not worth it. You\'d better go back to your office now and\r\ngo on with your work of saving the world. And use every hour of your time\r\nand every dollar you possess. I\'ll stay here and look after my children."\r\n\r\nDeborah had gone into the hall. Roger, buried deep in his paper, heard the\r\nheavy street door close. He looked up with a feverish sigh--and saw at the\r\nopen door of his study George and Betsy standing, curious, solemn and wide\r\neyed. How long had they been listening?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThere came a season of sleet and rain when the smaller children were shut\r\nindoors and it was hard to keep them amused. They did not look well, and\r\nEdith was worried. She had always dreaded the spring, and to carry her\r\nfamily safely through she had taken them, in former years, to Atlantic City\r\nfor two weeks. That of course was impossible now. Trouble was bound to\r\ncome, she thought. And it was not long in coming. Bobby, who was ten years\r\nold and went to school with his brother George, caught a wretched cold one\r\nday. Edith popped him into bed, but despite her many precautions he gave\r\nhis cold to Bruce and Tad.\r\n\r\n"Suppose I ask Allan Baird to come," Deborah suggested. "He\'s wonderful\r\nwith children, you know."\r\n\r\nEdith curtly accepted his services. She felt he had been sent for to\r\nprevent her getting Doctor Lake. But she said nothing. She would wait.\r\nThrough long hard days and longer nights she slaved upstairs. All Deborah\'s\r\nproffers of aid she declined. She kept Elizabeth home from school to help\r\nher with the many meals, the medicines and the endless task of keeping her\r\nlively patients in bed. She herself played with them by the hour, while the\r\nache in her head was a torment. At night she was up at the slightest sound.\r\nHeavy circles came under her eyes. Within a few days her baby, Bruce, had\r\ndeveloped pneumonia.\r\n\r\nThat evening after dinner, while Deborah was sitting with Roger in the\r\nliving room, she heard her sister coming downstairs. She listened acutely,\r\nand glancing around she saw that Roger was listening, too. Edith passed the\r\ndoorway and went on down the hall, where they heard her voice at the\r\ntelephone. She came back and looked in at the door.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve called Doctor Lake," she said. "I\'ve just taken Bruce\'s temperature.\r\nIt\'s a hundred and five and two fifths." Deborah glanced up with a start.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Edith!" she said softly. Her sister turned and looked at her.\r\n\r\n"I ought to have had him before," she said. "When he comes, please bring\r\nhim right up to the room." And she hurried upstairs.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" breathed Roger anxiously. He had seen Bruce an hour ago; and the\r\nsight of the tiny boy, so exhausted and so still, had given him a sudden\r\nscare. Could it be that _this_ would happen? Roger rose and walked the\r\nfloor. Edith was right, he told himself, they should have had Lake long\r\nbefore. And they would have, by George, if it had not been for Deborah\'s\r\ninterference! He glanced at her indignantly. Bringing in Baird to save\r\nmoney, eh? Well, it was just about time they stopped saving money on their\r\nown flesh and blood! What had Bruce to do with tenement babies? But he had\r\nhad tenement treatment, just that! Deborah had had her way at last with\r\nEdith\'s children, and one of them might have to pay with its life! Again\r\nRoger glared at his silent daughter. And now, even in his excited state, he\r\nnoticed how still and rigid she was, how unnatural the look she bent on the\r\nbook held tightly in her hands.\r\n\r\nStill Deborah said nothing. She could feel her father\'s anger. Both he and\r\nEdith held her to blame. She felt herself in a position where she could not\r\nmove a hand. She was stunned, and could not think clearly. A vivid picture\r\nwas in her mind, vivid as a burning flame which left everything else in\r\ndarkness. It was of Bruce, one adorable baby, fighting for breath. "What\r\nwould I do if he were mine?"\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor arrived she took him upstairs and then came down to her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n"Well?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. We\'ll have to wait." And they both sat silent. At last they\r\nheard a door open and close, and presently steps coming down the stairs.\r\nRoger went out into the hall:\r\n\r\n"Come right in here, doctor, won\'t you? I want to hear about this myself."\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir." And Lake entered the room, with Edith close behind him.\r\nHe took no notice of anyone else. "Write this down," he said to her. "And\r\ngive it to the nurse when she comes." A heavy man of middle age, with\r\ncurious dark impassive eyes that at times showed an ironic light, Lake was\r\na despot in a world of mothers to whom his word was law. He was busy\r\nto-night, with no time to waste, and his low harsh voice now rattled out\r\norders which Edith wrote down in feverish haste--an hourly schedule, night\r\nand day. He named a long list of things needed at once. "Night nurse will\r\nbe here in an hour," he ended. "Day nurse, to-morrow, eight a.m. Get sleep\r\nyourself and plenty of it. As it is you\'re not fit to take care of a cat."\r\nAbruptly he turned and left the room. Edith followed. The street door\r\nclosed, and in a moment after that his motor was off with a muffled roar.\r\nEdith came back, picked up her directions and turned to her sister:\r\n\r\n"Will you go up and sit with Bruce? I\'ll telephone the druggist," she said.\r\n\r\nDeborah went to the sick room. Bruce\'s small face, peaked and gray in the\r\nsoft dim light, turned as she entered and came to the bed.\r\n\r\n"Well, dear?" she whispered. The small boy\'s eyes, large and heavy with\r\nfever, looked straight into hers.\r\n\r\n"Sick," said the baby hoarsely. The next instant he tossed up his hands and\r\nwent through a spasm, trying to breathe. It passed, he relaxed a little,\r\nand again stared solemnly at his aunt. "Sick," he repeated. "Wery sick."\r\n\r\nDeborah sat silent. The child had another fight for his breath; and this\r\ntime as he did so, Deborah\'s body contracted, too. A few moments later\r\nEdith came in. Deborah returned downstairs, and for over an hour she sat by\r\nherself. Roger was in his study, Betsy and George had gone to bed. The\r\nnight nurse arrived and was taken upstairs. Still Deborah\'s mind felt numb\r\nand cold. Instinctively again and again it kept groping toward one point:\r\n"If I had a baby as sick as that, what would I do? What would I do?"\r\n\r\nWhen the doorbell rang again, she frowned, rose quickly and went to the\r\ndoor. It was Allan.\r\n\r\n"Allan--come in here, will you?" she said, and he followed her into the\r\nliving room.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Bruce is worse."\r\n\r\n"Oh--I\'m sorry. Why didn\'t Edith let me know?"\r\n\r\n"She had Lake to-night," said Deborah. He knitted his brows in annoyance,\r\nthen smiled.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t mind that," he replied. "I\'m rather glad. She\'ll feel easier\r\nnow. What did he tell her?"\r\n\r\n"He seemed to consider it serious--by the number of things he ordered."\r\n\r\n"Two nurses, of course--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, day and night." Deborah was silent a moment.\r\n\r\n"I may be wrong," she continued, "but I still feel sure the child will\r\nlive. But I know it means a long hard fight. The expense of it all will be\r\nheavy."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Whatever it is, I\'ll meet it," she said. "Father can\'t, he has reached the\r\nend. But even if he could help still, it wouldn\'t make much difference in\r\nwhat I\'ve been deciding. Because when I was with Bruce to-night, I saw as\r\nclear as I see you now that if I had a child like that--as sick as\r\nthat--I\'d sacrifice anything--everything--schools, tenement children,\r\nthousands! I\'d use the money which should have been theirs, and the time\r\nand the attention! I\'d shut them all out, they could starve if they liked!\r\nI\'d be like Edith--exactly! I\'d center on this one child of mine!"\r\n\r\nDeborah turned her eyes to his, stern and gleaming with her pain. And she\r\ncontinued sharply:\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t mean to shut those children out! And so it\'s clear as day to\r\nme that I can\'t ever marry you! That baby to-night was the finishing\r\nstroke!"\r\n\r\nShe made a quick restless movement. Baird leaned slowly forward. Her hands\r\nin her lap were clenched together. He took them both and held them hard.\r\n\r\n"No, this isn\'t clear," he said. "I can feel it in your hands. This is\r\nnerves. This is the child upstairs. This is Edith in the house. This is\r\nschool, the end of the long winter\'s strain."\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s what I\'ve decided!"\r\n\r\n"But this is the wrong decision," Allan answered steadily.\r\n\r\n"It\'s made!"\r\n\r\n"Not yet, it isn\'t, not to-night. We won\'t talk of it now, you\'re in no\r\ncondition." Deborah\'s wide sensitive lips began to quiver suddenly:\r\n\r\n"We _will_ talk of it now, or never at all! I want it settled--done with!\r\nI\'ve had enough--it\'s killing me!"\r\n\r\n"No," was Allan\'s firm reply, "in a few days things will change. Edith\'s\r\nchild will be out of danger, your other troubles will clear away!"\r\n\r\n"But what of next winter, and the next? What of Edith\'s children? Can\'t you\r\nsee what a load they are on my father? Can\'t you see he\'s ageing fast?"\r\n\r\n"Suppose he dies," Baird answered. "It will leave them on your hands.\r\nYou\'ll have _these_ children, won\'t you, whether you marry or whether you\r\ndon\'t! And so will I! I\'m their guardian!"\r\n\r\n"That won\'t be the same," she cried, "as having children of our own--"\r\n\r\n"Look into my eyes."\r\n\r\n"I\'m looking--" Her own eyes were bright with tears.\r\n\r\n"Why are you always so afraid of becoming a mother?" Allan asked. In his\r\ngruff low voice was a fierce appeal. "It\'s this obsession in your mind that\r\nyou\'ll be a mother like Edith. And that\'s absurd! You never will! You say\r\nyou\'re afraid of not keeping school the first thing in your life! But you\r\nalways do and you always will! You\'re putting it ahead of me now!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can put it ahead of _you_! But I couldn\'t put it ahead of _my\r\nchild_!" He winced at this and she noticed it. "Because you are strong, and\r\nthe child would be weak! The child would be like Bruce to-night!"\r\n\r\n"Are you sure if you marry you must have a child?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered huskily, "if I married you I\'d want a child. And that\r\nwant in me would grow and grow until it made both of us wretched. I\'m that\r\nkind of a woman. That\'s why my work has succeeded so far--because I\'ve a\r\npassion for children! They\'re not my work, they\'re my very life!" She bowed\r\nher head, her mouth set hard. "But so are you," she whispered. "And since\r\nthis is settled, Allan, what do you think? Shall we try to go on--working\r\ntogether side by side--seeing each other every day as we have been doing\r\nall these months? Rather hard on both of us, don\'t you think? I do, I feel\r\nthat way," she said. Again her features quivered. "The kind of feeling I\r\nhave--for you--would make that rather--difficult!"\r\n\r\nHis grip tightened on her hands.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t give you up," he said. "Later you will change your mind."\r\n\r\nHe left the room and went out of the house. Deborah sat rigid. She\r\ntrembled and the tears came. She brushed them angrily away. Struggling to\r\ncontrol herself, presently she grew quieter. Frowning, with her clear gray\r\neyes intently staring before her, she did not see her father come into the\r\ndoorway. He stopped with a jerk at sight of her face.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" he asked. She started.\r\n\r\n"Nothing\'s the matter! How is Bruce?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Who went out a few minutes ago?"\r\n\r\n"Allan Baird," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh. You explained to him, of course, about Lake--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he understands," she said. "He won\'t come here after this--"\r\n\r\nRoger looked at her sharply, wondering just what she meant. He hesitated.\r\nNo, he would wait.\r\n\r\n"Good-night," he said, and went upstairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morrow Bruce did not grow better. If anything, the child grew worse.\r\nBut by the next morning the crisis had passed. In the house the tension\r\nrelaxed, and Roger suddenly felt so weak that he went to see his own\r\nphysician. They had a long and serious talk. Later he went to his office,\r\nbut he gave little heed to his work. Sitting there at his desk, he stared\r\nthrough the window far out over the city. A plan was forming in his mind.\r\n\r\nAt home that night, at dinner, he kept watching Deborah, who looked tired\r\nand pale and rather relaxed. And as soon as she was out of the house he\r\ntelephoned Allan to come at once.\r\n\r\n"It\'s something which can\'t wait," he urged.\r\n\r\n"Very well, I\'ll come right up."\r\n\r\nWhen Baird arrived a little later, Roger opened the door himself, and they\r\nwent back into his study.\r\n\r\n"Sit down," he said. "Smoke, Allan?"\r\n\r\n"No, thanks." Baird looked doubly tall and lean, his face had a gaunt\r\nappearance; and as he sat down, his lithe supple right hand slowly closed\r\non the arm of his chair.\r\n\r\n"Now then," began Roger, "there are two things we want to get clear on. The\r\nfirst is about yourself and Deborah. There has been trouble, hasn\'t there?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"She has made up her mind not to marry you."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I guessed as much." And Roger paused. "Do you mind my asking questions?\r\n\r\n"No--"\r\n\r\n"Are you still in love with her, Allan?"\r\n\r\n"I am."\r\n\r\n"And she with you?"\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s the same old trouble."\r\n\r\n"Yes." And he told a part of what she had said. As he talked in clear,\r\nterse, even tones, Baird\'s steady eyes had a tortured light, the look of a\r\nman who has almost reached the end of his endurance. Roger smoked in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"What do you propose to do?"\r\n\r\n"Wait," said Allan, "a few days more. Then try again. If I fail I\'m\r\nthrough." Roger shot a quick look at him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you\'ll fail, my boy--and what\'s more I think I can help you.\r\nThis is a large house, Allan--there\'s more in it than you know. My second\r\npoint concerns myself. I\'m going to die within a year."\r\n\r\nAs Baird turned on him suddenly, Roger grimly smiled and said, "We won\'t go\r\ninto the details, but I\'ve been examined lately and I have quite positive\r\nknowledge of what I\'ve suspected for some time. So far, I have told no one\r\nbut you. And I\'m telling you only because of the bearing it has on\r\nDeborah." Roger leaned forward heavily. "She\'s the one of my daughters who\r\nmeans the most, now that I\'m so near the end. When I die next year that may\r\nbe all--I may simply end--a blank, a grave--I am not sure. But I\'ve made up\r\nmy mind above everything else to see Deborah happy before I go. And I mean\r\nto do it by setting her free--so free I think it will frighten her."\r\n\r\nRoger went on to explain his plan, and they talked together for some time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother week had soon gone by. Bruce still recovered rapidly, and the other\r\nsick children were up and about. Deborah, in the meantime, had barely been\r\nin the house at all. But late on Saturday evening Roger found her in her\r\nroom. She was working. He came behind her.\r\n\r\n"What is it, dad?"\r\n\r\n"Busy, eh?" He hesitated, and laid his hand on her shoulder with a little\r\naffectionate pressure. "You\'ve kept so busy lately," he said, "I haven\'t\r\nhad time to see anything of you. How\'s your work going?"\r\n\r\n"Much better, thanks--now that the winter is over."\r\n\r\nHe questioned her about her schools. And then after a brief pause,\r\n\r\n"Well, daughter," he said, "it has been a great fight, and I\'m proud of you\r\nfor it. And if I\'ve got anything to say--" his hand was still on her\r\nshoulder, and he felt her tighten suddenly--"it isn\'t by way of\r\ncriticism--please be sure of that ahead. In this damnable war my faith in\r\nmen has been badly shaken up. Humanity seems to me still a child--a child\r\nwho needs to go to school. God knows we need men and women like you--and\r\nI\'m proud of all you\'ve accomplished, I\'d be the last man to hold you back.\r\nI only want to help you go on--by seeing to it that you are free--from\r\nanything which can hinder you." He stopped again for a moment.\r\n\r\n"To begin with," he said, "I understand you\'re not going to marry Allan\r\nBaird." She stirred slightly:\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--I asked him," Roger replied. "I had Allan here a few nights ago, and\r\nhe told me you had decided to give up your happiness for the sake of all\r\nthose children in that big family of yours. You felt you must keep yourself\r\nfree for them. Very well, if that is your decision I propose to clear the\r\nway." She looked intently up at his face. "You\'re not free now," he\r\ncontinued. "We have Edith and her children here. And I\'m growing old--that\r\nhas got to be thought of--I don\'t want to leave them on your hands. So as\r\nsoon as the baby is well enough, I\'m going to move them up to the\r\nmountains--not only for the summer--they are to stay the whole year\r\n\'round. From this time on they\'re to make it their home."\r\n\r\n"Father! But they can\'t do that! Think of the winters!" Deborah cried.\r\n\r\n"It\'s already settled," he answered. "I\'ve talked to Edith and she has\r\nagreed. She has always loved the farm, and it will be good for her\r\nchildren. In the meantime I\'ve been talking to George. \'George,\' I told\r\nhim, \'I\'m going to talk to you, man to man, about a man\'s job I want you to\r\ntackle.\'"\r\n\r\n"The farm? But, dearie! He\'s only a boy!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s nearly seventeen," said Roger, "and a young moose for his age. And\r\nold Dave Royce will still be there. It\'s the work George has been dreaming\r\nabout ever since he was a child. You should have seen how he was thrilled\r\nby the scheme. I told him we\'d spend the summer together up there laying\r\nall our plans, investing our money carefully to make every dollar count."\r\n\r\n"What money?" Deborah sharply asked. But her father was talking steadily\r\non:\r\n\r\n"We already have a fine lot of cattle. We\'ll add to it and enlarge the barn\r\nand put in some new equipment. In short, we\'ll put it in fine shape, make\r\nit a first class dairy farm. \'And then, George,\' I said to him, \'I\'m going\r\nto turn it over to you. I shall give the farm to your mother, and the rest\r\nof the money I have I mean to invest in her name down here, so that she\'ll\r\nhave a small income until you can make your dairy pay.\'"\r\n\r\n"What money are you speaking of?" Deborah\'s voice was thick and hard, her\r\nsensitive lips were parted and she was breathing quickly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve sold the house," he told her. Convulsively she gripped his arms:\r\n\r\n"Then tell me where _you_ mean to live!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to live--I\'m going to die--very soon--I have definite\r\nknowledge."\r\n\r\nWithout speaking Deborah rose; her face went white. Her father kept tight\r\nhold of her hands, and he felt them trembling, growing cold.\r\n\r\n"You\'re soon to be free of everyone," he continued painfully. "I know this\r\nis hurting you, but I see so plain, so plain, my child, just what it is\r\nI\'ve got to do. I\'m trying to clear the way for you to make a simple\r\ndefinite choice--a choice which is going to settle your life one way or the\r\nother. I want to make sure you see what you\'re doing. Because you mean so\r\nmuch to me. We\'re flesh and blood--eh, my daughter?--and in this family of\r\nours we\'ve been the closest ones of all!" She seemed to sway a little.\r\n\r\n"_You\'re not going to die_!" she whispered.\r\n\r\n"So it hurts you to lose me," he replied. "It will be hard to be so free.\r\nWould you rather not have had me at all? I\'ve been quite a load on your\r\nback, you know. A fearful job you had of it, dragging me up when I was\r\ndown. And since then Edith and Bruce and the rest, what burdens they have\r\nbeen at times. What sharp worries, heavy sorrows, days and nights you and I\r\nhave gone through, when we should have been quietly resting--free--to keep\r\nup our strength for our next day\'s work. Suppose you had missed them, lived\r\nalone, would you have worked better? You don\'t know. But you will know\r\nsoon, you\'re to give it a trial. For I\'ve cleared the way--so that if you\r\nthrow over Baird to be free you shall get the freedom you feel you need!"\r\n\r\n"Father! Please! Is this fair? Is this kind?" She asked in a harsh\r\nfrightened tone. Her eyes were wet with angry tears.\r\n\r\n"This isn\'t a time to be kind, my dear." His voice was quivering like her\r\nown. "I\'m bungling it--I\'m bungling it--but you must let me stumble along\r\nand try to show you what I mean. You will have your work, your crowded\r\nschools, to which you\'ll be able to give your life. But I look ahead, I\r\nwho know you--and I don\'t see you happy, I don\'t even see you whole. For\r\nyou there will be no family. None of the intimate sorrows and joys that\r\nhave been in this house will come to you. I look back and I see them\r\nall--for a man who has come so near the end gets a larger vision." He shut\r\nhis eyes, his jaw set tight. "I look into my family back and back, and I\r\nsee how it has been made of many generations. Certain figures stand out in\r\nmy mind--they cover over a hundred years. And I see how much they\'ve meant\r\nto me. I see that I\'ve been one of them--a link in a long chain of\r\nlives--all inter-bound and reaching on. In my life they have all been\r\nhere--as I shall be in lives to come.\r\n\r\n"And this is what I want for you." He held her close a moment. The tears\r\nwere rolling down her cheeks. "Until now you have been one of us, too. You\r\nhave never once been free. You have been the one in this house to step in\r\nand take hold and try to decide what\'s best to be done. I\'m not putting you\r\nup on a pedestal, I don\'t say you\'ve made no mistakes--but I say you\'re the\r\nkind of a woman who craves what\'s in a family. You\'re the one of my\r\ndaughters who has loved this house the most!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, "I\'ve loved this house--"\r\n\r\n"But now for you all this will stop--quite suddenly," he told her. "This\r\nhouse of ours will soon be sold. And within a few months I shall be dead,\r\nand your family will have dropped out of your life."\r\n\r\n"Stop! Can\'t you? Stop! It\'s brutal! It isn\'t true about you!" she cried.\r\n"I won\'t believe it!" Her voice broke.\r\n\r\n"Go and see my physician," he said.\r\n\r\n"How long have you known it? Why didn\'t you tell me?"\r\n\r\n"Because we had troubles enough as it was, other things to think of. But\r\nthere\'s only one thing now, this freedom you are facing."\r\n\r\n"Please! Please!" she cried imploringly. "I don\'t want to talk of myself\r\nbut of you! This physician--"\r\n\r\n"No," he answered with stern pain, "you\'ll have to hear me out, my child.\r\nWe\'re talking of you--of you alone when I am gone. How will it be? Are you\r\nquite sure? You will have your work, that vision of yours, and I know how\r\nclose it has been to you, vivid and warm, almost like a friend. But so was\r\nmy business once like that, when I was as young as you. And the business\r\ngrew and it got cold--impersonal, a mere machine. Thank God I had a family.\r\nIsn\'t your work growing too? Are you sure it won\'t become a machine? And\r\nwon\'t you lose touch with the children then, unless you have a child of\r\nyour own? Friends won\'t be enough, you\'ll find, they\'re not bound up into\r\nyourself. The world may reach a stage at last where we shall live on in the\r\nlives of all--we may all be one big family. But that time is still far\r\noff--we hold to our own flesh and blood. And so I\'m sure it will be with\r\nyou. You see you have been young, my dear, and your spirit has been fresh\r\nand new. But how are you going to keep it so, without the ties you\'ve\r\nalways had?" He felt the violent clutch of her hand.\r\n\r\n"_You won\'t die_!" she whispered. But he went on relentlessly:\r\n\r\n"And what will you do without Allan Baird? For you see you have not even\r\nworked alone. You have had this man who has loved you there. I\'ve seen how\r\nmuch he has helped you--how you have grown and he has grown since you two\r\ngot together. And if you throw him over now, it seems to me you are not\r\nonly losing what has done the most for your work, but you\'re running away\r\nfrom life as well. You\'ve never won by doing that, you\'ve always won by\r\nmeeting life, never evading it, taking it all, living it full, taking\r\nchances! If you marry Baird, I see you both go on together in your work,\r\nwhile in your home you struggle through the troubles, tangles, joys and\r\ngriefs which most of us mortals know so well! I see you in a world of\r\nchildren, but with children, too, of your own--to keep your spirit always\r\nyoung! Living on in your children\'s lives!"\r\n\r\nRoger stopped abruptly. He groped for something more to say.\r\n\r\n"On the one side, all that," he muttered, "and on the other, a lonely life\r\nwhich will soon grow old."\r\n\r\nThere fell a dangerous silence. And sharply without warning, the influence,\r\ndeep and invisible, of many generations of stolid folk in New England made\r\nitself felt in each of them. Father and daughter grew awkward, both. The\r\ntalk had been too emotional. Each made, as by an instinct, a quick strong\r\neffort at self-control, and felt about for some way to get back upon their\r\nold easy footing. Roger turned to his daughter. Her head was still bent,\r\nher hands clasped tight, but she was frowning down at them now, although\r\nher face was still wet with tears. She drew a deep unsteady breath.\r\n\r\n"Well, Deborah," he said simply, "here I\'ve gone stumbling on like a fool.\r\nI don\'t know what I\'ve said or how you have listened."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve listened," she said thickly.\r\n\r\n"I have tried," he went on in a steadier tone, "to give you some feeling of\r\nwhat is ahead--and to speak for your mother as well as myself. And more\r\nthan that--much more than that--for the world has changed since she was\r\nhere. God knows I\'ve tried to be modern." A humorous glint came into his\r\neyes, "Downright modern," he declared. "Have I asked you to give up your\r\ncareer? Not at all, I\'ve asked you to marry Baird, and go right on with him\r\nin your work. And if you can\'t marry Allan Baird, after what he has done\r\nfor you, how in God\'s name can you modern women ever marry anyone? Now what\r\ndo you say? Will you marry him? Don\'t laugh at me! I\'m serious! Talk!"\r\n\r\nBut Deborah was laughing--although her father felt her hands still cold\r\nand trembling in his. Her gray eyes, bright and luminous, were shining up\r\ninto his own.\r\n\r\n"What a time you\'ve been having, haven\'t you, dear!" his daughter cried\r\nunsteadily. "Fairly lying awake at night and racking your brains for\r\neverything modern I\'ve ever said--to turn it and twist it and use it\r\nagainst me!"\r\n\r\n"Well?" he demanded. "How does it twist?"\r\n\r\n"It twists hard, thank you," she declared. "You\'ve turned and twisted me\r\nabout till I barely see how I can live at all!"\r\n\r\n"You can, though! Marry Allan Baird!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll think it over--later on."\r\n\r\n"What is there left to think about? Can you point to one hole in all I\'ve\r\nsaid?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a good many--and one right off."\r\n\r\n"Out with it!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re not dying," Deborah told him calmly, "I feel quite certain you\'ll\r\nlive for years."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you do, eh--then see my physician!"\r\n\r\n"I will, I\'ll see him to-morrow. How long did you give yourself? Just a few\r\nmonths?"\r\n\r\n"No, he said it might be more," admitted Roger grudgingly. "If I had no\r\nworries to wear me out--"\r\n\r\n"Me, you mean."\r\n\r\n"Exactly."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ve worried quite enough. You\'re going to leave it to me to\r\ndecide."\r\n\r\n"Very well," he agreed. He looked at her. "You have listened--hard?" he\r\ngruffly asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear." Her hands slowly tightened on his. "But don\'t speak of this\r\nagain. You\'re to leave it to me. You promise?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nAnd Roger left her.\r\n\r\nHe went to bed but he could not sleep. With a sudden sag in his spirits he\r\nfelt what a bungler he had been. He was not used to these solemn talks, he\r\ntold himself irately. What a fool to try it! And how had Deborah taken it\r\nall? He did not mind her laughter, nor that lighter tone of hers. It was\r\nonly her way of ending the talk, an easy way out for both of them. But what\r\nhad she thought underneath? Had his points gone home? He tried to remember\r\nthem. Pshaw! He had been too excited, and he could recall scarcely\r\nanything. He had not meant to speak of Baird--he had meant to leave him\r\nout! Yes, how he must have bungled it! Doubtless she was smiling still.\r\nEven the news about himself she had not taken seriously.\r\n\r\nBut as he thought about that news, Roger\'s mood completely changed. The\r\ntalk of the evening grew remote, his family no longer real, mere little\r\nfigures, shadowy, receding swiftly far away.... Much quieter now, he lay a\r\nlong time listening to the life of the house, the occasional sounds from\r\nthe various rooms. From the nursery adjoining came little Bruce\'s piping\r\nlaugh, and Roger could hear the nurse moving about. Afterwards for a long\r\ntime he could hear only creaks and breathings. Never had the old house\r\nseemed so like a living creature. For nearly forty years it had held all\r\nthat he had loved and known, all he had been sure of. Outside of it was the\r\nstrange, the new, the uncertain, the vast unknown, stretching away to\r\ninfinity....\r\n\r\nAgain he heard Bruce\'s gay little laugh. What did it remind him of? He\r\npuzzled. Then he had it. Edith had been a baby here. Her cradle had been in\r\nthis very room, close by the bed. And how she had laughed! What gurgles and\r\nripples of bursting glee! The first child in his family....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next day, which was Sunday, Deborah made an appointment with her\r\nfather\'s physician, and had a long talk with him at his house. Upon her\r\nreturn she went to her room and stayed there until evening, but when she\r\ncame down to supper her manner was as usual. At the table she joined in the\r\ntalk of Edith and the children, already deep in their preparations for the\r\nmove up to the farm. George could hardly wait to start. That life would be\r\na change indeed in Edith\'s plans for her family, and as they talked about\r\nit now the tension of hostility which had so long existed between the two\r\nsisters passed away. Each knew the clash had come to an end, that they\r\nwould live together no more; and as though in remorse they drew close,\r\nDeborah with her suggestions, Edith in her friendly way of taking and\r\ndiscussing each one. Then Deborah went again to her room. Her room was just\r\nover Roger\'s, and waking several times in the night he heard his daughter\r\nwalking the floor.\r\n\r\nThe next day she was up early and off to her school before he came down. It\r\nwas a fine spring morning, Roger had had a good night\'s sleep, and as he\r\nwalked to his office he was buoyed up by a feeling both of hope for his\r\ndaughter and of solid satisfaction in himself as he remembered all that he\r\nhad said to her. Curiously enough he could recall every word of it now.\r\nEvery point which he had made rose up before him vividly. How clear he had\r\nbeen, how simple and true, and yet with what a tremendous effect he had\r\npiled the points one on the other. "By George," he thought with a little\r\nglow, "for a fellow who\'s never been in a pulpit I put up a devilish strong\r\nappeal." And he added sagely, "Let it work on the girl, give it a chance.\r\nShe\'ll come out of this all right. This idea some fellows have, that every\r\nwoman is born a fool, isn\'t fair, it isn\'t true. Just let a line of\r\nargument be presented to her strong and clear--straight from the\r\nshoulder--by some man--"\r\n\r\nAnd again with a tingle of pleasure his mind recurred to his sermon. His\r\npleasures had been few of late, so he dwelt on this little glow of pride\r\nand made the most of it while it was here.\r\n\r\nAt the office, as he entered his room, he stopped with a slight shock of\r\nsurprise. John, standing on his crutches in front of a large table, had\r\nbeen going through the morning\'s mail, sorting out the routine letters\r\nRoger did not need to see. To-day he had just finished and was staring at\r\nthe window. The light fell full on his sallow face and showed an amazing\r\nhappiness. At Roger\'s step he started.\r\n\r\n"Well, Johnny, how goes it this morning?"\r\n\r\n"Fine, thank you," was the prompt reply. And John hobbled briskly over to\r\nhis typewriter in the corner. Roger sat down at his desk. As he did so he\r\nglanced again at the cripple and felt a little pang of regret. "What will\r\nbecome of him," he asked, "when I close out my business?" He still thought\r\nof him as a mere boy, for looking at the small crooked form it was\r\ndifficult to remember that John was twenty years of age. The lad had worked\r\nlike a Trojan of late. Even Roger, engrossed as he had been in family\r\nanxieties, had noticed it in the last few weeks. He would have to make some\r\nprovision for John. Deborah would see to it.... Roger went slowly through\r\nhis mail. One letter was from the real estate firm through whom he was to\r\nsell the house. The deal had not been closed as yet, there were certain\r\npoints still to be settled. So Roger called John to his desk and dictated a\r\nreply. When he finished there was a brief pause.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all," said Roger gruffly.\r\n\r\n"So you\'re sellin\' the house," John ventured.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nThe lad limped back to his corner and went to work at his machine. But\r\npresently he came over again and stood waiting awkwardly.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Johnny?" Roger inquired, without looking up.\r\n\r\n"Say, Mr. Gale," the boy began, in a carefully casual tone, "would you mind\r\ntalking business a minute or two?"\r\n\r\n"No. Fire ahead."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, you\'ve had your own troubles lately, you haven\'t had much time\r\nfor things here. The last time you went over the books was nearly a couple\r\nof weeks ago."\r\n\r\nJohn paused and his look was portentous.\r\n\r\n"Well," asked Roger, "what about it? Business been picking up any since\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir!" was the answer. "We didn\'t lose a cent last week! We made\r\nmoney! Fifteen dollars!"\r\n\r\n"Good Lord, Johnny, we\'re getting rich."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s nothing," John continued. "The fact of the matter is, Mr. Gale,\r\nI have been working lately on a new line I thought of. And now it\'s got\r\nagoing so fast it\'s getting clean away from me!" Again he stopped, and\r\nswallowed hard.\r\n\r\n"Out with it, then," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"I got it from the war," said John. "The papers are still half full of war\r\nnews, and that\'s what\'s keeping our business down--because we ain\'t\r\nadopting ourselves to the new war conditions. So I figured it like this.\r\nSay there are a million people over here in America who\'ve got either\r\nfriends or relations in the armies over there. Say that all of \'em want to\r\nget news--not just this stuff about battles, but real live news of what\'s\r\nhappened to Bill. Has Bill still got his legs and arms? Can he hold down a\r\njob when he gets home? News which counts for something! See? A big new\r\nmarket! Business for us! So I tried to see what I could do!" John\r\nexcitedly shifted his crutches. Roger was watching intently.\r\n\r\n"Go on, Johnny."\r\n\r\n"Sure, I\'ll go on! One night I went to a library where they have English\r\npapers. I went over their files for about a month. I took one Canadian\r\nregiment--see?--and traced it through, and I got quite a story. Then I used\r\nsome of the money I\'ve saved and bought a whole bunch of papers. I piled\r\n\'em up in the room where I sleep and went through \'em nights. I hired two\r\nkids to help me. Well, Mr. Gale, the thing worked fine! In less than a week\r\nI had any amount of little bunches of clippings. See how I mean? Each bunch\r\nwas the story of one regiment for a month. So I knew we could deliver the\r\ngoods!\r\n\r\n"Well, this was about ten days ago. And then I went after the market. I\r\nwent to a man I met last year in an advertising office, and for fifty\r\ndollars we put an \'ad\' in the Sunday Times. After that there was nothing to\r\ndo but wait. The next day--nothing doing! I was here at seven-thirty and I\r\nwent through every mail. Not a single answer to my \'ad\'--and I thought I\r\nwas busted! But Tuesday morning there were three, with five dollar checks\r\ninside of \'em! In the afternoon there were two more and the next day\r\neleven! By the end of last week we\'d had forty-six! Friday I put in another\r\n\'ad\' and there\'ve been over seventy more since then! That makes a hundred\r\nand twenty in all--six hundred dollars! And I\'m swamped! I ain\'t done\r\nnothing yet--I\'ve just kept \'em all for you to see!"\r\n\r\nHe went quickly to the table, gathered a pile of letters there and brought\r\nthem over to Roger\'s desk. Roger glanced over a few of them, dazed. He\r\nlooked around into John\'s shrewd face, where mingled devotion and triumph\r\nand business zeal were shining.\r\n\r\n"Johnny," he said huskily, "you\'ve adopted my business and no mistake."\r\nJohn swallowed again and scowled with joy.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s figure it out!" he proposed.\r\n\r\n"We will!"\r\n\r\nThey were at it all day, laying their plans, "adopting" the work of the\r\noffice to the new conditions. They found they would need a larger force,\r\nincluding a French and a German translator. They placed other "ads" in the\r\npapers. They forgot to have lunch and worked steadily on, till the outer\r\nrooms were empty and still. At last they were through. Roger wearily put on\r\nhis cuffs, and went and got his coat and hat.\r\n\r\n"Say, Mr. Gale," John asked him, "how about this letter--the one you\r\ndictated this morning to that firm about your house?" Roger turned and\r\nlooked at him.\r\n\r\n"Throw it into the basket," he said. "We\'ll write \'em another to-morrow and\r\ntell \'em we have changed our minds." He paused for just a moment, and then\r\nhe added brusquely, "If this goes through as I hope it will, I guess you\'d\r\nbetter come into the firm."\r\n\r\nAnd he left the room abruptly. Behind him there was not a sound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt home in his study, that evening, he made some more calculations. In a\r\nfew weeks he would have money enough to start Edith and her family in their\r\nnew life on the farm. For the present at least, the house was safe.\r\n\r\n"Why, father." Edith came into the room. "I didn\'t know you had come home.\r\nWhat kept you so long at the office?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, business, my dear--"\r\n\r\n"Have you had any supper?"\r\n\r\n"No, and I\'d like some," he replied.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see to it myself," she said. Edith was good at this sort of thing,\r\nand the supper she brought was delicious. He ate it with keen relish. Then\r\nhe went back to his study and picked up a book, an old favorite. He\r\nstarted to read, but presently dozed. The book dropped from his hands and\r\nhe fell asleep.\r\n\r\nHe awakened with a start, and saw Deborah looking down at him. For a moment\r\nhe stared up, as he came to his senses, and in his daughter\'s clear gray\r\neyes he thought he saw a happiness which set his heart to beating fast.\r\n\r\n"Well?" he questioned huskily.\r\n\r\n"We\'re to be married right away."\r\n\r\nHe stared a moment longer; "Oh, I\'m so glad, so glad, my dear. I was afraid\r\nyou--" he stopped short. Deborah bent close to him, and he felt her squeeze\r\nhis arm:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been over and over all you said," she told him, in a low sweet voice.\r\n"I had a good many ups and downs. But I\'m all through now--I\'m sure you\r\nwere right." And she pressed her cheek to his. "Oh, dad, dad--it\'s such a\r\nrelief! And I\'m so happy!... Thank you, dear."\r\n\r\n"Where is Allan?" he asked presently.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get him," she said. She left the room, and in a moment Allan\'s tall\r\nungainly form appeared in the doorway.\r\n\r\n"Well, Allan, my boy," Roger cried.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Roger Gale," said Allan softly. He was wringing Roger\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"So she decided to risk you, eh," Roger said unsteadily. "Well, Baird, you\r\nlook like a devilish risk for a woman like her--who has the whole world on\r\nher back as it is--"\r\n\r\n"I know--I know--and how rash she has been! Only two years and her mind was\r\nmade up!"\r\n\r\n"But that\'s like her--that\'s our Deborah--always acting like a flash--"\r\n\r\n"Stop acting like children!" Deborah cried. "And be sensible and listen to\r\nme! We\'re to be married to-morrow morning--"\r\n\r\n"Why to-morrow?" Roger asked.\r\n\r\n"Because," she said decidedly, "there has been enough fuss over this\r\naffair. So we\'ll just be married and have it done. And when Edith and the\r\nchildren go up next week to the mountains, we want to move right into this\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"This house?" exclaimed her father.\r\n\r\n"I know--it\'s sold," she answered. "But we\'re going to get a lease. We\'ll\r\nsee the new owner and talk him around."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll have to talk _your father_ around--"\r\n\r\n"_You_ around?" And Deborah stared. "You mean to say you\'re not going to\r\nsell?"\r\n\r\n"I do," said Roger blithely. He told them the story of John\'s new scheme.\r\n"And if things turn out in the office as I hope they will," he ended,\r\n"we\'ll clear the mortgage on the house and then make it your wedding\r\ngift--from the new firm to the new family."\r\n\r\nDeborah choked a little:\r\n\r\n"Allan! What do you think of us now?"\r\n\r\n"I think," he answered, in a drawl, "that we\'d better try to persuade the\r\nnew firm to live with the new family."\r\n\r\n"We will, and the sooner the better!" she said.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going up to the mountains," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but you\'re coming back in the fall, and when you do you\'re coming\r\nhere! And you\'re going to live here years and years!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re forgetting my doctor."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I had a long talk with him Sunday and I know just what I\'m\r\nsaying."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t look it, my dear," said Roger, "but of course you may be right.\r\nIf you take the proper care of me here--and John keeps booming things for\r\nthe firm--"\r\n\r\n"And George makes a huge success of the farm," Deborah added quickly.\r\n\r\n"And Deborah of teaching the world--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Allan, hush up!"\r\n\r\n"Look here," he said. "You go upstairs and tell Edith all this. Your father\r\nand I want to be alone."\r\n\r\nAnd when the two men were left alone, they smoked and said nothing. They\r\nsmiled at each other.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard to decide," grunted Roger at last. "Which did it--my wonderful\r\nsermon or your own long waiting game? I\'m inclined to think it was the\r\ngame. For any other man but you--with all you\'ve done, without any\r\ntalk--no, sir, there wouldn\'t have been a chance. For she\'s modern, Baird,\r\nshe\'s modern. And I\'m going to live just as long as I can. I want to see\r\nwhat happens here."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next night in his study, how quiet it was. Edith was busy packing\r\nupstairs, Deborah and Allan were gone. Thoughts drifted slowly across his\r\nmind. Well, she was married, the last of his daughters, the one whom he\r\ncared most for, the one who had taken the heaviest risks. And this was the\r\ngreatest risk of all. For although she had put it happily out of her\r\nthoughts for the moment, Roger knew the old troublesome question was still\r\nthere in Deborah\'s mind. The tenement children or her own, the big family\r\nor the small? He felt there would still be struggles ahead. And with a kind\r\nof a wistfulness he tried to see into the future here.\r\n\r\nHe gave a sudden start in his chair.\r\n\r\n"By George!" he thought. "They forgot the ring!" Scowling, he tried to\r\nremember. Yes, in the brief simple service that day, in which so much had\r\nbeen omitted--music, flowers, wedding gown--even the ring had been left\r\nout. Why? Not from any principle, he knew that they were not such fools.\r\nNo, they had simply forgotten it, in the haste of getting married at once.\r\nWell, by thunder, for a girl whose father had been a collector of rings for\r\nthe best part of his natural life, it was pretty shabby to say the least!\r\nThen he recollected that he, too, had forgotten it. And this quieted him\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get one, though," he promised himself. "And no plain wedding ring\r\neither. I\'ll make A. Baird attend to that. No, I\'ll get her a ring worth\r\nwhile."\r\n\r\nHe sank deep in his chair and took peace to his soul by thinking of the\r\nring he would choose. And this carried his thoughts back over the years.\r\nFor there had been so many rings....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a clear beautiful afternoon toward the end of May. And as the train\r\npuffing up the grade wound along the Connecticut River, Roger sat looking\r\nout of the window. The orchards were pink and white on the hills. Slowly\r\nthe day wore away. The river narrowed, the hills reared high, and in the\r\nsloping meadows gray ribs and shoulders of granite appeared. The air had a\r\ntang of the mountains. Everywhere were signs of spring, of new vigor and\r\nfresh life. But the voices at each station sounded drowsier than at the\r\nlast, the eyes appeared more stolid, and to Roger it felt like a journey\r\nfar back into old ways of living, old beliefs and old ideals. He had always\r\nhad this feeling, and always he had relished it, this dive into his\r\nboyhood. But it was different to-day, for this was more than a journey, it\r\nwas a migration, too. Close about him in the car were Edith and her\r\nchildren, bound for a new home up there in the very heart and stronghold of\r\nall old things in America.\r\n\r\nOld things dear to Edith\'s heart. As she sat by the window staring out, he\r\nwatched her shapely little head; he noted the hardening lines on her\r\nforehead and the gray which had come in her hair. It had been no easy move\r\nfor her, this, she\'d shown pluck to take it so quietly. He saw her smile a\r\nlittle, then frown and go on with her thinking. What was she thinking\r\nabout, he wondered--all she had left behind in New York, or the rest of her\r\nlife which lay ahead? She had always longed for things simple and old.\r\nWell, she would have them now with a vengeance, summer and winter, the year\r\n\'round, in the battered frame house on the mountain side, the birthplace of\r\nher family. A recollection came to him of a summer\'s dusk two years ago\r\nand a woman with a lawn mower cutting the grass on the family graves. Would\r\nEdith ever be like that, a mere custodian of the past? If she did, he\r\nthought, she would be false to the very traditions she tried to preserve.\r\nFor her forefathers had never been mere guardians of things gone by. Always\r\nthey had been pioneers. That house had not been old to them, but a\r\nthrilling new adventure. Their old homes they had left behind, far down in\r\nthe valleys to the east. And even those valley homes had been new to the\r\nrugged men come over the sea. Would Edith ever understand? Would she see\r\nthat for herself the new must emerge from her children, from the ideas,\r\ndesires and plans already teeming in their minds? Would she show keen\r\ninterest, sympathy? Would she be able to keep her hold?\r\n\r\nIn the seat behind her mother, Betsy was sitting with Bruce in her lap,\r\nlooking over a picture book. Quietly Roger watched the girl.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to be?" he asked. "A woman\'s college president, a\r\nsurgeon or a senator? And what will your mother think of you then?"\r\n\r\nThey changed cars, and on a train made up of antiquated coaches they wound\r\nthrough a side valley, down which rushing and tumbling came the river that\r\nbore Roger\'s name. He went into the smoking car, and presently George\r\njoined him there. George did not yet smoke, (with his elders), but he had\r\nbought a package of gum and he was chewing absorbedly. Plainly the lad was\r\nexcited over the great existence which he saw opening close ahead. Roger\r\nglanced at the boy\'s broad shoulders, noticed the eager lines of his jaw,\r\nlooked down at his enormous hands, unformed as yet, ungainly; but in them\r\nwas a hungriness that caused a glow in Roger\'s breast. One more of the\r\nfamily starting out.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all going to depend on you," Roger gravely counseled. "Your whole\r\nlife will depend on the start you make. Either you\'re going to settle down,\r\nlike so many of your neighbors up there, or you\'re going to hustle, plan\r\nout your day, keep on with your studies and go to college--the State\r\nAgricultural College, I mean. In short, keep up to date, my boy, and become\r\nin time a big figure in farming."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to do it," George replied. His grandfather glanced again at his\r\nface, so scowling, so determined. And a gleam of compassion and yearning\r\ncame for a moment in Roger\'s eyes. His heavy hand lay on George\'s knee.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, son," he grunted. "Make the family proud of you. I\'ll do all\r\nI can to help you start. My business is picking up, thank God, and I\'ll be\r\nable to back you now. I\'ll stay up here a good part of the summer. We\'ve\r\nboth of us got a lot to learn--and not only from books--we want to remember\r\nwe\'ve plenty to learn from the neighbors, too. Take old Dave Royce, for\r\ninstance, who when all is said and done has worked our farm for twenty odd\r\nyears and never once run me into debt."\r\n\r\n"But, Gee!" demurred George. "He\'s so \'way out of date!"\r\n\r\n"I know he is, son, but we\'ve got to go slow." And Roger\'s look passed\r\nfurtively along the faces in the car. "We don\'t want to forget," he warned,\r\n"that this is still New England. Every new idea we have we want to go easy\r\nwith, snake it in."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got an awful lot of \'em," the boy muttered hungrily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the farm, the next morning at daybreak, Roger was awakened by the sound\r\nof George\'s voice. It was just beneath his window:\r\n\r\n"But cattle are only part of it, Dave," the boy declared, in earnest tones,\r\n"just part of what we can have up here. Think what we\'ve got--over three\r\nhundred acres! And we want to make every acre count! We want to get in a\r\nwhole lot more of hogs--Belted Hampshires, if we can afford \'em--and a\r\ncouple of hundred hens. White Leghorns ought to fill the bill. Of course\r\nthat\'s just a starter. I\'ve got a scheme for some incubators--electric--run\r\nby the dynamo which we\'ll put in down by the dam. And we can do wonders\r\nwith bees, too, Dave--I\'ve got a book on \'em I\'d like you to read. And\r\nbesides, there\'s big money in squab these days. Rich women in New York\r\nhotels eat thousands of \'em every night. And ducks, of course, and turkeys.\r\nI\'d like a white gobbler right at the start, if we knew where we could get\r\none cheap." The voice broke off and there was a pause. "We can do an awful\r\nlot with this place."\r\n\r\nThen Dave\'s deep drawl:\r\n\r\n"That\'s so, George--yes, I guess that\'s so. Only we don\'t want to fool\r\nourselves. That ain\'t Noah\'s Ark over thar--it\'s a barn. And just for a\r\nstarter, if I was you--" Here Dave deliberated. "Of course it\'s none of my\r\nbusiness," he said, "it\'s for you and your grandfather to decide--and I\r\ndon\'t propose to interfere in what ain\'t any of my affair--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, Dave, sure! That\'s all right! But go on! _What_, just for a\r\nstarter?"\r\n\r\n"Cows," came the tranquil answer. "I\'ve been hunting around since you wrut\r\nme last month. And I know of three good milkers--"\r\n\r\n"Three? Why, Dave, I wrote we want thirty or forty!"\r\n\r\n"Yes--you wrut," Dave answered. "But I\'ve druv all around these parts--and\r\nthere ain\'t but three that I can find. And I ain\'t so sure of that third\r\none. She looks like she might--" George cut in.\r\n\r\n"But you only had a buggy, Dave! Gee! I\'m going to have a Ford!"\r\n\r\n"That so, George?"\r\n\r\n"You bet it\'s so! And we\'ll go on a cow hunt all over the State!"\r\n\r\n"Well--I dunno but what you\'re right," Dave responded cautiously. "You\r\nmight get more cows if you had a Ford--an\' got so you could run it. Yes, I\r\nguess it\'s a pretty good scheme. I believe in being conservative,\r\nGeorge--but I dunno now but what a Ford--"\r\n\r\nTheir voices passed from under the window, and Roger relaxed and smiled to\r\nhimself. It was a good beginning, he thought.\r\n\r\nThey bought a Ford soon afterwards and in the next few weeks of June they\r\nsearched the farms for miles around, slowly adding to their herd. To\r\nRoger\'s surprise he found many signs of a new life stirring there--the\r\nfarmers buying "autos" and improved machinery, thinking of new processes;\r\nand down in the lower valleys they found several big stock farms which were\r\ndecidedly modern affairs. At one such place, the man in charge took a fancy\r\nto George and asked him to drop over often.\r\n\r\n"You bet I\'ll drop over often!" George replied, as he climbed excitedly\r\ninto his Ford. "I want to see more of those milking machines! We\'re going\r\nto have \'em some day ourselves! A dynamo too!"\r\n\r\nAnd at home, down by the ruined mill he again set about rebuilding the dam.\r\n\r\nRoger felt himself growing stronger. His sleeps were sound, and his\r\nappetite had come back to a surprising degree. The mountain air had got\r\ninto his blood and George\'s warm vigor into his soul. One afternoon,\r\nwatching the herd come home, some thirty huge animals swinging along with a\r\nslow heavy power in their limbs, he breathed the strong sweet scent of them\r\non the mountain breeze. George came running by them and stopped a moment by\r\nRoger\'s side, watching closely and eagerly every animal as it passed. And\r\nRoger glanced at George\'s face. The herd passed on and George followed\r\nbehind, his collie dog leaping and barking beside him. And Roger looked up\r\nat a billowy cloud resting on a mountain top and wondered whether after all\r\nthat New York doctor had been right.\r\n\r\nHe followed the herd into the barn. In two long rows, the great heads of\r\nthe cattle turned hungrily, lowing and sniffing deep, breathing harshly,\r\nstamping, as the fodder cart came down the lines. What a splendidly\r\nwholesome work for a lad, growing up with his roots in the soil, in these\r\nmassive simple forces of life. What of Edith\'s other children? Would they\r\nbe willing to stay here long? Each morning Roger breakfasted with Bruce the\r\nbaby by his side. "What a thing for you, little lad," he thought, "if you\r\ncould live here all your days. But will you? Will you want to stay? Won\'t\r\nyou, too, get the fever, as I did, for the city?" In the joyous, shining,\r\nmysterious eyes of the baby he found no reply. He had many long talks with\r\nBetsy, who was eager to go away to school, and with Bob and little Tad who\r\nwere going to school in the village that fall. And the feeling came to\r\nRoger that surely he would see these lives, at least for many years ahead.\r\nThey were so familiar and so real, so fresh and filled with hopes and\r\ndreams. And he felt himself so a part of them all.\r\n\r\nBut one morning, climbing the steep upper field to a spring George wanted\r\nto show him, Roger suddenly swayed, turned faint. He caught hold of a\r\nboulder on the wall and held himself rigid, breathing hard. It passed, and\r\nhe looked at his grandson. But George had noticed nothing. The boy had\r\nturned and his brown eyes were fixed on a fallow field below. Wistfully\r\nRoger watched his face. They both stood motionless for a long time.\r\n\r\nAs the summer drew slowly to a close, Roger spent many quiet hours alone by\r\nthe copse of birches, where the glory of autumn was already stealing in and\r\nout among the tall slender stems of the trees. And he thought of the silent\r\nwinter there, and of the spring which would come again, and the long\r\nfragrant summer. And he watched the glow on the mountains above and the\r\nrolling splendors of the clouds. At dusk he heard the voices of animals,\r\nbirds and insects, murmuring up from all the broad valley, then gradually\r\nsinking to deep repose, many never to wake again. And the span of his life,\r\nfrom the boyhood which he could recall so vividly here among these\r\nchildren, seemed brief to him as a summer\'s day, only a part of a mighty\r\nwhole made up of the innumerable lives, the many generations, of his\r\nfamily, his own flesh and blood, come out of a past he could never know,\r\nand going on without him now, branching, dividing, widening out to what his\r\neyes would never see.\r\n\r\nVaguely he pictured them groping their way, just as he himself had done. It\r\nseemed to Roger that all his days he had been only entering life, as some\r\nrich bewildering thicket like this copse of birches here, never getting\r\nvery deep, never seeing very clearly, never understanding all. And so it\r\nhad been with his children, and so it was with these children of Edith\'s,\r\nand so it would be with those many others--always groping, blundering,\r\nstarting--children, only children all. And yet what lives they were to\r\nlead, what joys and revelations and disasters would be theirs, in the\r\nstrange remote world they would live in--"my flesh and blood that I never\r\nshall know."\r\n\r\nBut the stars were quiet and serene. The meadows and the forests on the\r\nbroad sweep of the mountain side took on still brighter, warmer hues. And\r\nthere was no gloom in these long good-byes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn a frosty night in September, he left the farm to go to the city. From\r\nhis seat in the small automobile Roger looked back at the pleasant old\r\nhouse with its brightly lighted windows, and then he turned to George by\r\nhis side:\r\n\r\n"We\'re in good shape for the winter, son."\r\n\r\nBut George did not get his full meaning.\r\n\r\nAt the little station, there were no other passengers. They walked the\r\nplatform for some time. Then the train with a scream came around the curve.\r\nA quick grip on George\'s hand, and Roger climbed into the car. Inside, a\r\nmoment later, he looked out through the window. By a trainman with a\r\nlantern, George stood watching, smiling up, and he waved his hand as the\r\ntrain pulled out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning on his arrival in town, Roger went to his office. He had\r\nlittle cause for uneasiness there, for twice in the summer he had come down\r\nto keep an eye on the business, while John had taken brief vacations at a\r\nseaside place nearby. The boy had no color now in his cheeks; as always,\r\nthey were a sallow gray with the skin drawn tight over high cheek bones;\r\nhis vigor was all in his eyes. But here was a new John, nevertheless, a\r\nsuccessful man of affairs. He had on a spruce new suit of brown, no cheap\r\nready-made affair but one carefully fitted to conceal and soften his\r\ndeformity. He was wearing a bright blue tie and a cornflower in his\r\nbuttonhole, and his sandy hair was sleekly brushed. He showed Roger into\r\nhis private room, a small place he had partitioned off, where over his desk\r\nwas a motto in gold: "This is no place for your troubles or mine."\r\n\r\n"Lord, but you\'ve got yourself fixed up fine in here," said Roger. John\r\nsmiled broadly. "And you\'re looking like a new man, Johnny."\r\n\r\n"I had a great time at the seashore. Learned to sail a boat alone. What do\r\nyou think of this chair of mine?" And John complacently displayed the\r\ningenious contrivance in front of his desk, somewhat like a bicycle seat.\r\nIt was made of steel and leather pads.\r\n\r\n"Wonderful," said Roger. "Where\'d you ever pick it up?"\r\n\r\n"I had it made," was the grave reply. "When a fellow has got up in life\r\nenough to have a stenographer, it\'s high time he was sitting down."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see you do it." John sat down. "Now how is business?" Roger asked.\r\n\r\n"Great. Since the little slump we had in August it has taken a new\r\nstart--and not only war business, at that--the old people are sending in\r\norders again. I tell you what it is, Mr. Gale, this country is right on the\r\nedge of a boom!"\r\n\r\nAnd the junior member of the firm tilted triumphantly back in his chair.\r\n\r\nWith the solid comfort which comes to a man when he returns to find his\r\naffairs all going well, Roger worked on until five o\'clock, and then he\r\nstarted for his home.\r\n\r\nDeborah had not yet come in, and a deep silence reigned in the house. He\r\nlooked through the rooms downstairs, and with content he noticed how little\r\nhad been altered. His beloved study had not been touched. On the third\r\nfloor, in the large back room, he found John comfortably installed. There\r\nwere gay prints upon the walls, fresh curtains at the windows, a mandolin\r\nlying on a chair. And Roger, glancing down at the keen glad face of his\r\npartner, told himself that the doctor who had said this lad would die was a\r\nfool.\r\n\r\n"These doctors fool themselves often," he thought.\r\n\r\nDeborah and Allan had the front room on the floor below. Roger went in, and\r\nfor a moment he stood looking about him. How restful and how radiant was\r\nthis large old-fashioned chamber, so softly lighted, waiting. Through a\r\npassageway lined with cupboards he went into his room at the back. Deborah\r\nhad repapered it, but with a pattern so similar that Roger did not notice\r\nthe change. He only felt a vague freshness here, as though even this old\r\nchamber, too, were making a new start in life. And he felt as though he\r\nwere to live here for years. Slowly he unpacked his trunk and took a bath\r\nand dressed at his leisure. Then he heard Deborah\'s voice at the door.\r\n\r\n"Come in, come in!" he answered.\r\n\r\n"Why, father! Dearie!" Deborah cried "Oh, how well you\'re looking, dad!"\r\nAnd she kissed him happily. "Oh, but I\'m glad to have you back--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s good," he said, and he squeezed her hand "Here, come to the light,\r\nlet me look at you." He saw her cheeks a little flushed, the gladness in\r\nher steady eyes. "Happy? Everything just right?" His daughter nodded,\r\nsmiling, and he gave a whimsical frown. "No ups and down at all? That\'s\r\nbad."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, plenty--but all so small."\r\n\r\n"Good fellow to live with."\r\n\r\n"Very."\r\n\r\n"And your work?\r\n\r\n"It\'s going splendidly. I\'ll tell you about it this evening, after you give\r\nme the news from the farm."\r\n\r\nThey chatted on for a short while, but he saw she was barely listening.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you guess what it means," she asked him softly, "to a woman of my\r\nage--after she has been so afraid she was too old, that she\'d married too\r\nlate--to know at last--to be sure at last--that she\'s to have a baby, dad?"\r\nHe drew back a little, and a lump rose in his throat.\r\n\r\n"By George!" he huskily exclaimed. "Oh, my dear, my dear!" And he held her\r\nclose in his arms for some time, till both of them grew sensible.\r\n\r\nSoon after she had gone to her room, he heard Allan coming upstairs. He\r\nheard her low sweet cry of welcome, a silence, then their voices. He heard\r\nthem laughing together and later Deborah humming a song. And still thinking\r\nof what she had told him, he felt himself so close to it all. And again the\r\nfeeling came to him that surely he would live here for years.\r\n\r\nAllan came in and they had a talk.\r\n\r\n"Deborah says she has told you the news."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Everything\'s all right, I suppose--her condition, I mean," said\r\nRoger.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t be better."\r\n\r\n"Just as I thought."\r\n\r\n"Those six weeks we had up in Maine--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you both show it. Working hard?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--"\r\n\r\n"And Deborah?" Roger asked.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to help me hold her in."\r\n\r\nThey talked a few moments longer and went down to the living room. John was\r\nthere with Deborah. All four went in to dinner. And through the\r\nconversation, from time to time Roger noticed the looks that went back and\r\nforth between husband and wife; and again he caught Deborah smiling as\r\nthough oblivious of them all. After dinner she went with him into his den.\r\n\r\n"Well! Do you like the house?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"Better than ever," he replied.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if you\'ll mind it. There\'ll be people coming to dinner, you\r\nknow--"\r\n\r\n"That won\'t bother me any," he said.\r\n\r\n"And committee meetings now and then. But you\'re safe in here, it\'s a good\r\nthick door."\r\n\r\n"Let \'em talk," he retorted, "as hard as they please. You\'re married\r\nnow--they can\'t scare me a bit. Only at ten o\'clock, by George, you\'ve got\r\nto knock off and go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll take care of myself," she said.\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t, Allan will. We\'ve had a talk."\r\n\r\n"Scheming already."\r\n\r\n"Yes. When will it be?"\r\n\r\n"In April, I think."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll quit work in your schools?"\r\n\r\n"A month before."\r\n\r\n"And in the meantime, not too hard."\r\n\r\n"No, and not too easy. I\'m so sure now that I can do both." And Deborah\r\nkissed him gently. "I\'m so happy, dearie--and oh, so very glad you\'re\r\nhere!"\r\n\r\nThere followed for Roger, after that, many quiet evenings at home,\r\nuntroubled days in his office. Seldom did he notice the progress of his\r\nailment. His attention was upon his house, as this woman who mothered\r\nthousands of children worked on for her great family, putting all in order,\r\nmaking ready for the crisis ahead when she would become the mother of one.\r\n\r\nNow even more than ever before, her work came crowding into his home. The\r\nhouse was old, but the house was new. For from schools and libraries, caf\xe9s\r\nand tenements and streets, the mighty formless hunger which had once so\r\nthrilled her father poured into the house itself and soon became a part of\r\nit. He felt the presence of the school. He heard the daily gossip of that\r\nbewildering system of which his daughter was a part: a world in itself,\r\nwith its politics, its many jarring factions, its jealousies, dissensions,\r\nits varied personalities, ambitions and conspiracies; but in spite of these\r\nconfusions its more progressive elements downing all distrusts and fears\r\nand drawing steadily closer to life, fearlessly rousing everywhere the\r\nhunger in people to live and learn and to take from this amazing world all\r\nthe riches that it holds: the school with its great challenge steadily\r\nincreasing its demands in the name of its children, demands which went deep\r\ndown into conditions in the tenements and ramified through politics to the\r\nCity Hall, to Albany, and even away to Washington--while day by day and\r\nweek by week, from cities, towns and villages came the vast prophetic story\r\nof the free public schools of the land.\r\n\r\nAnd meanwhile, in the tenements, still groping and testing, feeling her\r\nway, keeping close watch on her great brood, their wakening desires, their\r\nwidening curiosities, Deborah was bringing them, children, mothers and\r\nfathers too, together through the one big hope of brighter and more ample\r\nlives for everybody\'s children. Step by step this hope was spread out into\r\nthe surrounding swamps and jungles of blind driven lives, to find\r\nsurprising treasures there deep buried under dirt and din, locked in the\r\ncommon heart of mankind--old songs and fables, hopes and dreams and visions\r\nof immortal light, handed down from father to son, nurtured, guarded,\r\nbreathed upon and clothed anew by countless generations, innumerable\r\nmillions of simple men and women blindly struggling toward the sun. Over\r\nthe door of one of the schools, were these words carved in the stone:\r\n\r\n"Humanity is still a child. Our parents are all people who have lived upon\r\nthe earth--our children, all who are to come. And the dawn at last is\r\nbreaking. The great day has just begun."\r\n\r\nThis spirit of triumphal life poured deep into Roger\'s house. It was as\r\nthough his daughter, in these last months which she had left for undivided\r\nservice, were strengthening her faith in it all and pledging her\r\ndevotion--as communing with herself she felt the crisis drawing near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere came an interruption. One night when Deborah was out and Roger sat in\r\nhis study alone, the maid came in highly flustered and said,\r\n\r\n"Mr. Gale! It\'s Miss Laura to see you!"\r\n\r\nHe turned with a startled jerk of his head and his face slowly reddened.\r\nBut when he saw the maid\'s eager expression and saw that she was expecting\r\na scene, with a frown of displeasure he rose from his chair.\r\n\r\n"Very well," he said, and he went to his daughter. He found her in the\r\nliving room. No repentant Magdalene, but quite unabashed and at her ease,\r\nshe came to her father quickly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dad, I\'m so glad to see you, dear!" And she gave him a swift impetuous\r\nkiss, her rich lips for an instant pressing warmly to his cheek.\r\n\r\n"Laura!" he said thickly. "Come into my study, will you? I\'m alone this\r\nevening."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad you are!" she replied. She followed him in and he closed the\r\ndoor. He glanced at her confusedly. In her warmth, her elegance, an\r\nindefinable change in the tone and accent of her high magnetic voice, and\r\nin her ardent smiling eyes, she seemed to him more the foreigner now. And\r\nRoger\'s thoughts were in a whirl. What had happened? Had she married again?\r\n\r\n"Is Edith here still?" she was asking.\r\n\r\n"No, she\'s up in the mountains. She\'s living there," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Edith? In the mountains?" demanded Laura, in surprise. And she asked\r\ninnumerable questions. He replied to each one of them carefully, slowly,\r\nmeanwhile getting control of himself.\r\n\r\n"And Deborah married--married at last! How has it worked? Is she happy,\r\ndad?"\r\n\r\n"Very," he said.\r\n\r\n"And is she still keeping up her schools?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, for the present. She\'ll have to stop soon." Laura leaned forward,\r\ncurious:\r\n\r\n"Tell me, dad--a baby?"\r\n\r\n"Yes." She stared a moment.\r\n\r\n"Deborah!" she softly exclaimed; and in a moment, "I wonder."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" her father asked, but Laura evaded his question. She\r\nplied him with her inquiries for a few minutes longer, then turned to him\r\nwith a challenging smile:\r\n\r\n"Well, father, don\'t you think you had better ask me now about myself?" He\r\nlooked away a moment, but turned resolutely back:\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. When did you land?"\r\n\r\n"This morning, dear, from Italy--with my husband," she replied. And Roger\r\nstarted slightly. "I want you to meet him soon," she said.\r\n\r\n"Very well," he answered. At his disturbed, almost guilty expression Laura\r\nlaughed a little and rose and came over and hugged him tight.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but, father dearest--it\'s working out so splendidly! I want you to\r\nknow him and see for yourself! We\'ve come to live in New York for a\r\nwhile--he has more to do here about war supplies."\r\n\r\n"More shrapnel, eh, machine guns. More wholesale death," her father\r\ngrowled. But Laura smiled good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, love, from America. Aren\'t you all ashamed of yourselves--scrambling\r\nso, to get rich quick--out of this war you disapprove of."\r\n\r\n"_You_ look a bit rich," her father retorted.\r\n\r\n"Rather--for the moment," was her cheerful answer.\r\n\r\n"And you still like living in Italy?"\r\n\r\n"Tremendously! Rome is wonderful now!"\r\n\r\n"Reborn, eh. Wings of the Eagles."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and we\'re doing rather well."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t noticed it," Roger said. "Why don\'t you send a few of your\r\ntroops to help those plucky Frenchmen?"\r\n\r\n"Because," she replied, "we have a feeling that this is a war where we had\r\nmuch better help ourselves."\r\n\r\n"High ideals," he snorted.\r\n\r\n"Rome reborn," she remarked, unabashed. And her father scowled at her\r\nwhimsically.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a heathen. I give you up," he declared. Laura had risen, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, don\'t give me up," she said. "For you see," she added softly, "I\'m\r\na heathen with a great deal of love in her heart for thee, my dearest dad.\r\nMay I bring him down, my husband?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll telephone to Deborah to-morrow and arrange it."\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone he returned to his chair and sat for a long time in a\r\ndaze. He was still disturbed and bewildered. What a daughter of his! And\r\nwhat did it mean? Could she really go on being happy like this? Sinning?\r\nYes, she was sinning! Laura had broken her marriage vows, she had "run off\r\nwith another fellah." Those were the plain ugly facts. And now, divorced\r\nand re-married, she was careering gayly on! And her views of the war were\r\nplain heathenish! And yet there was something about her--yes, he thought,\r\nhe loved her still! What for? For being so happy! And yet she was wrong to\r\nbe happy, all wrong! His thoughts went \'round in circles.\r\n\r\nAnd his confusion and dismay grew even deeper the next night when Laura\r\nbrought her new husband to dine. For in place of the dark polished\r\nscoundrel whom Roger had expected, here was a spruce and affable youth with\r\nthick light hair and ruddy cheeks, a brisk pleasant manner of talking and a\r\ndecidedly forcible way of putting the case of his country at war. They kept\r\nthe conversation to that. For despite Deborah\'s friendly air, she showed\r\nplainly that she wanted to keep the talk impersonal. And Laura, rather\r\namused at this, replied by treating Deborah and Allan and her father, too,\r\nwith a bantering forbearance for their old-fashioned, narrow views and\r\nDeborah\'s religion of brotherhood, democracy. All that to Laura was pass\xe9.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Roger glanced at her face, into her clear and luminous\r\neyes so warm with the joy of living with this new man, her second. How his\r\nfamily had split apart. He wrote Edith the news of her sister, and he\r\nreceived but a brief reply. Nor did Deborah speak of it often. She seemed\r\nto want to forget Laura\'s life as the crisis in her own drew near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n\r\nDeborah had not yet stopped work. Again and again she put it off. For in\r\nher busy office so many demands both old and new kept pressing in upon her,\r\nsuch unexpected questions and vexing little problems kept cropping up as\r\nDeborah tried to arrange her work for the colleague who was to take her\r\nplace in the spring, that day after day she lingered there--until one\r\nafternoon in March her husband went to her office, gave her an hour to\r\nfinish up, and then brought her home with him. She had a fit of the blues\r\nthat night. Allan was called out on a case, and a little while later Roger\r\nfound his daughter alone in the living room, a book unopened in her lap,\r\nher gray eyes glistening with tears. She smiled when she caught sight of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"It\'s so silly!" she muttered unsteadily. "Just my condition, I suppose. I\r\nfeel as though I had done with school for the remainder of my days!...\r\nBetter leave me now, dearie," she added. "I\'m not very proud of myself\r\nto-night--but I\'ll be all right in the morning."\r\n\r\nThe next day she was herself again, and went quietly on with her\r\npreparations for the coming of her child. But still the ceaseless interests\r\nof those hordes of other children followed her into the house. Not only her\r\nsuccessor but principals and teachers came for counsel or assistance. And\r\nlater, when reluctantly she refused to see such visitors, still the\r\ntelephone kept ringing and letters poured in by every mail. For in her\r\nlarger family there were weddings, births and deaths, and the endless\r\nsavage struggle for life; and there were many climaxes of dreams and\r\naspirations, of loves and bitter jealousies. And out of all this straining\r\nand this fever of humanity, came messages to Deborah: last appeals for aid\r\nand advice, and gifts for the child who was to be born; tiny garments\r\nquaintly made by women and girls from Italy, from Russia and from Poland;\r\nbaby blankets, wraps and toys and curious charms and amulets. There were so\r\nmany of these gifts.\r\n\r\n"There\'s enough for forty babies," Deborah told her father. "What on earth\r\nam I to do, to avoid hurting anyone\'s feelings? And isn\'t it rather awful,\r\nthe way these inequalities will crop up in spite of you? I know of eight\r\ntenement babies born down there in this one week. How much fuss and\r\nfeathers is made over them, and their coming into the world, poor mites?"\r\nRoger smiled at his daughter.\r\n\r\n"You remind me of Jekyll and Hyde," he said.\r\n\r\n"Father! What a horrible thought! What have Jekyll and Hyde to do with me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, my dear," he answered. "Only it\'s queer and a little uncanny,\r\nsomething I\'ve never seen before, this double mother life of yours."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was only a few days later when coming home one evening he found that\r\nDeborah\'s doctor had put her to bed and installed a nurse. There followed a\r\nweek of keen suspense when Roger stayed home from the office. She liked to\r\nhave him with her, and sitting at her bedside he saw how changed his\r\ndaughter was, how far in these few hours she had drawn into herself. He had\r\nsuspected for some time that all was not well with Deborah, and Allan\r\nconfirmed his suspicions. There was to be grave danger both for the mother\r\nand the child. It would come out all right, of course, he strove to\r\nreassure himself. Nothing else could happen now, with her life so\r\nsplendidly settled at last. That Fate could be so pitiless--no, it was\r\nunthinkable!\r\n\r\n"This is what comes of your modern woman!" Roger exclaimed to Allan one\r\nnight. "This is the price she\'s paying for those nerve-racking years of\r\nwork!"\r\n\r\nThe crisis came toward the end of the week. And while for one entire night\r\nand through the day that followed and far into the next night the doctors\r\nand nurses fought for life in the room upstairs, Roger waited, left to\r\nhimself, sitting in his study or restlessly moving through the house. And\r\nstill that thought was with him--the price! It was kept in his mind by the\r\nanxious demands which her big family made for news. The telephone kept\r\nringing. Women in motors from uptown and humbler visitors young and old\r\nkept coming to make inquiries. More gifts were brought and flowers. And\r\nRoger saw these people, and as he answered their questions he fairly\r\nscowled in their faces--unconsciously, for his mind was not clear.\r\nReporters came. Barely an hour passed without bringing a man or a woman\r\nfrom some one of the papers. He gave them only brief replies. Why couldn\'t\r\nthey leave his house alone? He saw her name in headlines: "Deborah Gale at\r\nPoint of Death." And he turned angrily away. Vividly, on the second night,\r\nthere came to him a picture of Deborah\'s birth so long ago in this same\r\nhouse. How safe it had been, how different, how secluded and shut in. No\r\nworld had clamored _then_ for news. And so vivid did this picture grow,\r\nthat when at last there came to his ears the shrill clear cry of a new\r\nlife, it was some time before he could be sure whether this were not still\r\nhis dream of that other night so long ago.\r\n\r\nBut now a nurse had led him upstairs, and he stood by a cradle looking down\r\nat a small wrinkled face almost wholly concealed by a soft woolly blanket.\r\nAnd presently Allan behind him said,\r\n\r\n"It\'s a boy, and he\'s to be named after you." Roger looked up.\r\n\r\n"How\'s the mother?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Almost out of danger," was the reply. Then Roger glanced at Allan\'s face\r\nand saw how drawn and gray it was. He drew a long breath and turned back to\r\nthe child. Allan had gone and so had the nurse, and he was alone by the\r\ncradle. Relief and peace and happiness stole into his spirit. He felt the\r\ndeep remoteness of this strange new little creature from all the clamoring\r\nworld without--which he himself was soon to leave. The thought grew\r\nclearer, clearer, as with a curious steady smile Roger stood there looking\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n"Well, little brother, you\'re here, thank God. And nobody knows how close\r\nwe\'ll be--for a little while," he thought. "For we\'re almost out of the\r\nworld, you and I."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDays passed, Deborah\'s strength increased, and soon they let Roger come\r\ninto the room. She, too, was remote from the world for a time. That great\r\nfamily outside was anxious no longer, it left her alone. But soon it would\r\ndemand her. Never again, he told himself, would she be so close, so\r\nintimate, as here in her bed with this child of hers to whom she had given\r\nher father\'s name. "These hours are my real good-byes."\r\n\r\nTwo long quiet weeks of this happiness, and then in a twinkling it was\r\ngone. The child fell sick, within a few hours its small existence hung by a\r\nthread--and to Roger\'s startled eyes a new Deborah was revealed! Tense and\r\nsilent on her bed, her sensitive lips compressed with pain, her birthmark\r\nshowing a jagged line of fiery red upon her brow as her ears kept straining\r\nto catch every sound from the nursery adjoining, through hours of stern\r\nanguish she became the kind of mother that she had once so\r\ndreaded--shutting out everything else in the world: people, schools, all\r\nother children, rich or poor, well, sick or dying! Here was the crisis of\r\nDeborah\'s life!\r\n\r\nOne night as she lay listening, with her hand gripping Roger\'s tight,\r\nfrowning abruptly she said to him, in a harsh, unnatural voice:\r\n\r\n"They don\'t care any longer, none of them care! _I\'m_ safe and they\'ve\r\nstopped worrying, for they know they\'ll soon have me back at work! The\r\nwork," she added fiercely, "that made my body what it is, not fit to bear a\r\nbaby!" She threw a quick and tortured look toward the door of the other\r\nroom. "My work for those others, all those years, will be to blame if this\r\none dies! And if it doesn\'t live I\'m through! I won\'t go on! I couldn\'t!\r\nI\'d be too bitter after this--toward all of them--_those children_!"\r\n\r\nThese last two words were whispers so bitter they made Roger cold.\r\n\r\n"But this child is going to live," he responded hoarsely. Its mother stared\r\nup with a quivering frown. The next moment her limbs contracted as from an\r\nelectric shock. There had come a faint wail from the other room.\r\n\r\nAnd this went on for three days and nights. Again Roger lived as in a\r\ndream. He saw haggard faces from time to time of doctors, nurses, servants.\r\nHe saw Allan now and then, his tall ungainly figure stooped, his features\r\ngaunt, his strong wide jaw set like a vise, but his eyes kind and steady\r\nstill, his low voice reassuring. And Roger noticed John at times hobbling\r\nquickly down a hall and stopping on his crutches before a closed door,\r\nlistening. Then these figures would recede, and it was as though he were\r\nalone in the dark.\r\n\r\nAt last the nightmare ended. One afternoon as he sat in his study, Allan\r\ncame in slowly and dropped exhausted into a chair. He turned to Roger with\r\na smile.\r\n\r\n"Safe now, I think," he said quietly.\r\n\r\nRoger went to Deborah and found her asleep, her face at peace. He went to\r\nhis room and fell himself into a long dreamless slumber.\r\n\r\nIn the days which followed, again he sat at her bedside and together they\r\nwatched the child in her arms. So feeble still the small creature appeared\r\nthat they both spoke in whispers. But as little by little its strength\r\nreturned, Deborah too became herself. And though still jealously watchful\r\nof its every movement, she had time for other thinking. She had talks with\r\nher husband, not only about their baby but about his work and hers. Slowly\r\nher old interest in all they had had in common returned, and to the\r\nmessages from outside she gave again a kindlier ear.\r\n\r\n"Allan tells me," she said one day, when she was alone with her father,\r\n"that I can have no more children. And I\'m glad of that. But at least I\r\nhave one," she added, "and he has already made me feel like a different\r\nwoman than before. I feel sometimes as though I\'d come a million miles\r\nalong in life. And yet again it feels so close, all that I left back there\r\nin school. Because I\'m so much closer now--to every mother and every child.\r\nAt last I\'m one of the family."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n\r\nOf that greater family, one member had been in the house all through the\r\nmonth which had just gone by. But he had been so quiet, so carefully\r\nunobtrusive, that he had been scarcely noticed. Very early each morning,\r\nday after day, John had gone outside for his breakfast and thence to the\r\noffice where he himself had handled the business as well as he could, only\r\ncoming to Roger at night now and then with some matter he could not settle\r\nalone, but always stoutly declaring that he needed no other assistance.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t come, Mr. Gale," he had urged. "You look worn out. You\'ll be sick\r\nyourself if you ain\'t careful. And anyhow, if you hang around you\'ll be\r\nhere whenever she wants you."\r\n\r\nEarly in Deborah\'s illness, John had offered to give up his room for the\r\nuse of one of the nurses.\r\n\r\n"That\'s mighty thoughtful of you, Johnny," Allan had responded. "But we\'ve\r\ngot plenty of room as it is. Just you stick around. We want you here."\r\n\r\n"All right, Doc. If there\'s any little thing, you know--answering the\r\n\'phone at night or anything else that I can do--"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, so; I\'ll let you know. But in the meantime go to bed."\r\n\r\nFrom that day on, John had taken not only his breakfast but his supper,\r\ntoo, outside, and no one had noticed his absence. Coming in late, he had\r\nhobbled silently up to his room, stopping to listen at Deborah\'s door. He\r\nhad kept so completely out of the way, it was not till the baby was three\r\nweeks old, and past its second crisis, that Deborah thought to ask for\r\nJohn. When he came to her bed, she smiled up at him with the baby in her\r\narms.\r\n\r\n"I thought we\'d see him together," she said. John stood on his crutches\r\nstaring down. And as Deborah watched him, all at once her look grew intent.\r\n"Johnny," she said softly, "go over there, will you, and turn up the light,\r\nso we can see him better."\r\n\r\nAnd when this was done, though she still talked smilingly of the child,\r\nagain and again she glanced up at John\'s face, at the strange self-absorbed\r\nexpression, stern and sad and wistful, there. When he had gone the tears\r\ncame in her eyes. And Deborah sent for her husband.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next day, at the office, John came into Roger\'s room. Roger had been at\r\nwork several days and they had already cleared up their affairs.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s something," said John gruffly, "that I wish you\'d put away\r\nsomewhere."\r\n\r\nAnd he handed to his partner a small blue leather album, filled with the\r\nnewspaper clippings dealing with Deborah\'s illness. On the front page was\r\none with her picture and a long record of her service to the children of\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n"She wouldn\'t want to see it now," John continued awkwardly. "But I thought\r\nmaybe later on the boy would like to have it. What do you think?" he\r\ninquired. Roger gave him a kindly glance.\r\n\r\n"I think he will. It\'s a fine thing to keep." And he handed it back. "But I\r\nguess you\'d better put it away, and give it to her later yourself."\r\n\r\nJohn shifted his weight on his crutches, so quickly that Roger looked up in\r\nalarm:\r\n\r\n"Look here! You\'re not well!" He saw now that the face of the cripple was\r\nwhite and the sweat was glistening on his brow. John gave a harsh little\r\nnervous laugh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s nothing much, partner," he replied. "That\'s another thing I\r\nwanted to tell you. I\'ve had some queer pains lately--new ones!" He caught\r\nhis breath.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tell me, you young fool?"\r\n\r\n"You had your own troubles, didn\'t you?" John spoke with difficulty. "But\r\nI\'ll be all right, I guess! All I need is a few days off!"\r\n\r\nRoger had pressed a button, and his stenographer came in.\r\n\r\n"Call a taxi," he said sharply. "And, John, you go right over there and lie\r\ndown. I\'m going to take you home at once!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got a better scheme," said John, setting his determined jaws. The\r\nsweat was pouring down his cheeks. "It may be a week--but there\'s just a\r\nchance it--may be a little worse than that! So I\'ve got a room in a\r\nhospital! See? Be better all round!" He swayed forward.\r\n\r\n"Johnny!" Roger caught him just in time, and the boy lay senseless in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt home, a few hours later, Allan came with another physician down from\r\nJohn\'s small bedroom. He saw his colleague to the door and then came in to\r\nRoger.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid Johnny has come to the end."\r\n\r\nFor a moment Roger stared at him.\r\n\r\n"Has, eh," he answered huskily. "You\'re absolutely sure he has? There\'s\r\nnothing--nothing on earth we can do?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing more than we\'re doing now."\r\n\r\n"He has fooled you fellows before, you know--"\r\n\r\n"Not this time."\r\n\r\n"How long will it be?"\r\n\r\n"Days or hours--I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"He mustn\'t suffer!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see to that." Roger rose and walked the floor.\r\n\r\n"It was the last month did it, of course--"\r\n\r\n"Yes--"\r\n\r\n"I blame myself for that."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t," said Allan gently. "You\'ve done a good deal for Johnny Geer."\r\n\r\n"He has done a good deal for this family! Can Deborah see him?"\r\n\r\n"I wish she could."\r\n\r\n"Better stretch a point for her, hadn\'t you? She\'s been a kind of a mother\r\nto John."\r\n\r\n"I know. But she can\'t leave her bed."\r\n\r\n"Then you won\'t tell her?"\r\n\r\n"I think she knows. She talked to me about him last night."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, a mother!" Roger cried. "She was watching! We were blind!" He\r\ncame back to his chair and dropped into it.\r\n\r\n"Does John know this himself?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"He suspects it, I think," said Allan.\r\n\r\n"Then go and tell him, will you, that he\'s going to get well. And after\r\nyou\'ve done it I\'ll see him myself. I\'ve got something in mind I want to\r\nthink out."\r\n\r\nAfter Allan had left the room, Roger sat thinking about John. He thought of\r\nJohn\'s birth and his drunken mother, the accident and his struggle for\r\nlife, through babyhood and childhood, through ignorance and filth and pain,\r\nthrough din and clamor and hunger, fear; of the long fierce fight which\r\nJohn had made not to be "put away" in some big institution, of his battle\r\nto keep up his head, to be somebody, make a career for himself. He thought\r\nof John\'s becoming one of Deborah\'s big family, only one of thousands, but\r\nit seemed now to Roger that John had stood out from them all, as the figure\r\nbest embodying that great fierce hunger for a full life, and as the link\r\nconnecting, the one who slowly year by year had emerged from her greater\r\nfamily and come into her small one. And last of all he thought of John as\r\nhis own companion, his only one, in the immense adventure on which he was\r\nso soon to embark.\r\n\r\nA few moments later he stood by John\'s bed.\r\n\r\n"Pretty hard, Johnny?" he gently asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, not so bad as it might be, I guess--"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll soon feel better, they tell me, boy." John shut his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he muttered.\r\n\r\n"Can you stand my talking, just a minute?"\r\n\r\n"Sure I can," John whispered. "I\'m not suffering any now. He\'s given me\r\nsomething to put me to sleep. What is it you want to talk about? Business?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly, partner. It\'s about the family. You\'ve got so you\'re almost\r\none of us. I guess you know us pretty well."\r\n\r\n"I guess I do. It\'s meant a lot to me, Mr. Gale--"\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll tell you what you don\'t know, John," Roger went on slowly. "I had\r\na son in the family once, and he died when he was three months old. That\r\nwas a long time ago--and I never had another, you see--to take his\r\nplace--till you came along." There fell a breathless silence. "And I\'ve\r\nbeen thinking lately," Roger added steadily. "I haven\'t long to live, you\r\nknow. And I\'ve been wondering whether--you\'d like to come into the\r\nfamily--take my name. Do you understand?"\r\n\r\nJohn said nothing. His eyes were still closed. But presently, groping over\r\nthe bed, he found Roger\'s hand and clutched it tight. After this, from time\r\nto time his throat contracted sharply. Tears welled from under his eyelids.\r\nThen gradually, as the merciful drug which Allan had given did its work,\r\nhis clutch relaxed and he began breathing deep and hard. But still for some\r\ntime longer Roger sat quietly by his side.\r\n\r\nThe next night he was there again. Death had come to the huddled form on\r\nthe bed, but there had been no relaxing. With the head thrown rigidly far\r\nback and all the features tense and hard, it was a fighting figure still,\r\na figure of stern protest against the world\'s injustice. But Roger was not\r\nthinking of this, but of the discovery he had made, that in their talk of\r\nthe night before John had understood him--completely. For upon a piece of\r\npaper which Allan had given the lad that day, these words had been\r\npainfully inscribed:\r\n\r\n"This is my last will and testament. I am in my right mind--I know what I\r\nam doing--though nobody else does--nobody is here. To my partner Roger Gale\r\nI leave my share in our business. And to my teacher Deborah Baird I leave\r\nmy crutches for her school."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter John had gone away the house was very quiet. Only from the room\r\nupstairs there could be heard occasionally the faint clear cry of Deborah\'s\r\nchild. And once again to Roger came a season of repose. He was far from\r\nunhappy. His disease, although progressing fast, gave him barely any pain;\r\nit rather made its presence felt by the manner in which it affected his\r\nmind. His inner life grew uneven. At times his thoughts were as in a fog,\r\nagain they were amazingly clear and vistas opened far ahead. He could not\r\ncontrol his thinking.\r\n\r\nThis bothered him at the office, in the work he still had to do. For some\r\nmonths he had been considering an offer from one of his rivals, a modern\r\nconcern which wished to buy out his business together with that of three\r\nother firms and consolidate them all into one corporation. And Roger was\r\nselling, and it was hard; for the whole idea of bargaining was more\r\ndistasteful than ever now. He had to keep reminding himself of Edith and\r\nher children.\r\n\r\nAt last it was over, his books were closed, and there was nothing left to\r\nbe done. Nor did he care to linger. These rooms had meant but little to\r\nhim; they had been but a place of transition from the old office far\r\ndowntown, so full of memories of his youth, to the big corporation looming\r\nahead, the huge impersonal clipping mill into which his business was to\r\nmerge. And it came to his mind that New York was like that--no settled calm\r\nabiding place cherishing its memories, but only a town of transition, a\r\ngreat turbulent city of change, restlessly shaking off its past, tearing\r\ndown and building anew, building higher, higher, higher, rearing to the\r\nvery stars, and shouting, "Can you see me now?" What was the goal of this\r\nmad career? What dazzling city would be here? For a time he stared out of\r\nhis window as into a promised land. Slowly at last he rose from his desk.\r\nClippings, clippings, clippings. He looked at those long rows of girls\r\ngleaning in items large and small the public reputations of all kinds of\r\nmen and women, new kinds in a new nation seething with activities, sweeping\r\non like some wide river swollen at flood season to a new America, a world\r\nwhich Roger would not know. And yet it would be his world still, for in it\r\nhe would play a part.\r\n\r\n"In their lives, too, we shall be there--the dim strong figures of the\r\npast."\r\n\r\nFrom his desk he gathered a few belongings. Then he looked into John\'s\r\nsmall room, with the big gold motto over the desk: "This is no place for\r\nyour troubles or mine." On the desk lay that small album, John\'s parting\r\ngift to Deborah\'s boy. Roger picked it up and walked out of the office. He\r\nhad never liked good-byes.\r\n\r\nIn the elevator he noticed that his shoes needed shining, and when he\r\nreached the street below he stopped at the stand on the corner. The stocky\r\nGreek with bushy black hair, who had run the stand for many years, gave him\r\na cheery greeting; for Roger had stopped there frequently--not that he\r\ncared about his shoes, but he had always liked to watch the crowds of\r\npeople passing.\r\n\r\n"No hurry, boss?"\r\n\r\n"None," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"Then I give a fine shine! Polish, too?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, polish, too." And Roger settled back to watch.\r\n\r\n"And put in new shoe strings," he added, with a whimsical smile.\r\n\r\nMen and women, girls and boys by thousands passed him, pushing, hurrying,\r\nshuffling by. Girls tittering and nudging and darting quick side glances.\r\nBobbing heads and figures, vigorous steps and dancing eyes. Life bubbling\r\nover everywhere, in laughter, in sharp angry tones, in glad expectant\r\nchatter. Deborah\'s big family. Across the street was a movie between two\r\nlurid posters, and there was a dance hall overhead. The windows were all\r\nopen, and faintly above the roar of the street he could hear the piano,\r\ndrum, fiddle and horn. The thoroughfare each moment grew more tumultuous to\r\nhis ears, with trolley cars and taxis, motor busses, trucks and drays. A\r\nsmall red motor dashed uptown with piles of evening papers; a great black\r\nmotor hearse rushed by. In a taxi which had stopped in a jam, a man was\r\nkissing a girl in his arms, and both of them were laughing. The smart\r\nlittle toque of blue satin she wore was crushed to one side. How red were\r\nher lips as she threw back her head....\r\n\r\n"Silk or cotton, boss? Which you like?" Roger glanced at the shoe strings\r\nand pondered.\r\n\r\n"Silk," he grunted in reply. Idly for a moment he watched this busy little\r\nman. From whence had he come in far away Greece? What existence had he\r\nhere, and what kind of life would he still have through those many years to\r\ncome? A feeling half of sadness crept into Roger\'s heavy eyes as he looked\r\nat the man, at his smiling face and then at other faces in the multitudes\r\nsweeping past. The moment he tried to single them out, how doubly chaotic\r\nit became. What an ocean of warm desires, passions, vivid hopes and\r\nworries. Vaguely he could feel them pass. Often in the midst of his life,\r\nhis active and self-centered life, Roger had looked at these crowds on the\r\nstreet and had thought these faces commonplace. But now at the end it was\r\nnot so.\r\n\r\nA woman with a baby carriage stopped directly in front of him and stood\r\nthere anxiously watching for a chance to cross the street. And Roger\r\nthought of Deborah. Heavily he climbed down from his seat, paid the man and\r\nbade him good-night, and went home to see Deborah\'s baby.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he sat by the cradle. Presently Deborah joined him, and\r\nsoon they were laughing heartily at the astonishing jerks and kicks and\r\ngrimaces of the tiny boy. He was having his bath and he hated it. But safe\r\nat last on his mother\'s lap, wrapped to his ears in a big soft towel, he\r\ngrew very gay and contented and looked waggishly about.\r\n\r\nThere followed long lazy days of spring, as April drifted into May. Early\r\nin the morning Roger could hear through his window the cries of the vendors\r\nof flowers and fruits. And he listened drowsily. He rose late and spent\r\nmost of the day in the house; but occasionally he went out for a stroll.\r\nAnd one balmy evening when groups of youths came trooping by, singing in\r\nclose harmony, Roger called a taxi and went far down through the tenement\r\nstreets to a favorite haunt of his, a little Syrian pawnshop, where after\r\nlong delving he purchased a ring to put in the new collection that he had\r\nbeen making lately. He had nearly a dozen now.\r\n\r\nDays passed. The house was still so quiet, Deborah was still upstairs. At\r\nlast, one night upon leaving his study, he stopped uncertainly in the hall.\r\nHe took more time than was his wont in closing up the house for the night,\r\nin trying all the windows, in turning out the various lights. Room after\r\nroom he left in the dark. Then he went slowly up the stairs, his hand\r\ngratefully feeling those guiding points grown so familiar to his touch\r\nthrough many thousand evenings. His hand lingered on the banister and he\r\nstopped again to listen there.\r\n\r\nHe did not come downstairs again.\r\n\r\nHe was able to sleep but little at night. Turning restlessly on his bed, he\r\nwould glance out of the window up at the beetling wall close by, tier on\r\ntier of apartments from which faint voices dropped out of the dark.\r\nGradually as the night wore on, these voices would all die away into long\r\nmysterious silences--for to him at least such silences had grown to be\r\nvery mysterious. Alone in the hours that followed, even these modern\r\nneighbors and this strange new eager town pressing down upon his house\r\nseemed no longer strange to him nor so appallingly immense, seemed even\r\nfamiliar and small to him, as the eyes of his mind looked out ahead.\r\n\r\nFrom his bed he could see on the opposite wall the picture Judith had given\r\nhim, always so fresh and cool and dim with its deep restful tones of blue,\r\nof the herdsmen and the cattle on the dark mountain rim at dawn. And\r\nvaguely he wondered whether it was because he saw more clearly, or whether\r\nhis mind in this curious haze could no longer see so well, that as he\r\nlooked before him he felt no fear nor any more uncertainty. All his doubts\r\nhad lifted, he was so sure of Judith now. As though she were coming to meet\r\nhim, her image grew more vivid, with memories emerging out of all the years\r\ngone by. What memories, what vivid scenes! What intimate conversations they\r\nhad, her voice so natural, close in his ear, as together they planned for\r\ntheir children.... Wistfully he would search the years for what he should\r\nsoon tell his wife--until the drowsiness returned, and then again came\r\nvisions.\r\n\r\nBut by day it was not so, for the life of the house would rouse him and at\r\nintervals hold his attention.\r\n\r\nOne evening a slight rustle, a faint fragrance in the room, made Roger\r\nsuddenly open his eyes. And he saw Laura by his bed, her slender figure\r\nclad in blue silk, something white at her full bosom. He noticed her\r\nshapely shoulders, her glossy hair and moist red lips. She was smiling down\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n"See what I\'ve brought you, dear," she said. And she turned to a chair\r\nwhere, one on the other, tray after tray, was piled his whole collection of\r\nrings. At sight of them his eyes grew fixed; he could feel his pulse beat\r\nfaster.\r\n\r\n"How did you ever find them?" he asked his daughter huskily.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I had a long hunt all by myself. But I found them at last and I\'ve\r\nbrought them home. Shall we look them over a little while?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said. She turned up the light, and came and sat down at the\r\nbedside with a tray of rings in her lap. One by one she held them up to his\r\ngaze, still smiling and talking softly on in that rich melodious voice of\r\nhers, of which he heard but snatches. How good it felt to be so gay. No\r\nsolemn thoughts nor questionings, just these dusky glittering beauties\r\nhere, deep soft gleams of color, each with its suggestion of memories for\r\nRoger, a procession of adventures reaching back into his life. He smiled\r\nand lay in silence watching, until at last she bent over him, kissed him\r\nsoftly, breathed a good-night and went out of the room. Roger followed her\r\nwith his glance. He knew he would never see her again. How graceful of her\r\nto go like that.\r\n\r\nHe lay there thinking about her. In her large blue limousine he saw his gay\r\nyoung daughter speeding up the Avenue, the purple gleaming pavement\r\nreflecting studded lines of lights. And he thought he could see her smiling\r\nstill. He recalled scattered fragments of her life--the first luxurious\r\nlittle m\xe9nage, and the second. How many more would there be? She was only\r\nin her twenties still. Uneasily he tried to see into the years ahead for\r\nher, and he thought he saw a lonely old age, childless, loveless, cynical,\r\nhard. But this fear soon fell from his mind. No, whatever happened, she\r\nwould do it gracefully, an artist always, to the end. He sighed and gave up\r\nthe effort. For he could not think of Laura as old, nor could he think of\r\nher any more as being a part of his family.\r\n\r\nEdith came to him several times, and there was something in her face which\r\ngave him sharp forebodings. Making a great effort he tried to talk to her\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard to keep up with your children," he said. "It means keeping up\r\nwith everything new. And you stay in your rut and then it\'s too late.\r\nBefore you know it you are old."\r\n\r\nBut his words subsided in mutterings, and Roger wearily closed his eyes.\r\nFor a glance up into Edith\'s face had shown him only pity there and no heed\r\nto his warning. He saw that she looked upon him as old and still upon\r\nherself as young, though he noticed the threads of gray in her hair....\r\nThen he realized she had gone and that his chamber had grown dark. He must\r\nhave been dreaming. Of what, he asked. He tried to remember. And suddenly\r\nout of the darkness, so harsh and clear it startled him, a picture rose in\r\nRoger\'s mind of a stark lonely figure, a woman in a graveyard cutting the\r\ngrass on family graves. Where had he seen it? He could not recall. What had\r\nit to do with Edith? Was she not living in New York?... What had so\r\nstartled him just now? Some thought, some vivid picture, some nightmare he\r\ncould not recall.\r\n\r\nHis last talks were with Deborah. All through those days and the long\r\nnights, too, he kept fancying she was in the room, and it brought deep balm\r\nto his restless soul. He asked her to tell him about the schools, and\r\nDeborah talked to him quietly. She was going back to her work in the fall.\r\nShe felt very humble about it--she told him she felt older now and she saw\r\nthat her work was barely begun. But she was even happier than before. Her\r\nhand lay in his, and it tightened there. He opened his eyes and looked up\r\ninto hers.\r\n\r\n"All so strange," he muttered, "life." There was a sharp contracting of her\r\nwide and sensitive mouth.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear, strange!" she whispered.\r\n\r\n"But I\'m so glad you\'re going on." He frowned as he tried to be simple and\r\nclear, and make her feel he understood what she had set herself to do. "All\r\npeople," he said slowly, "never counted so much as now. And never so\r\nhungry--all--as now--for all of life--like children--children who should go\r\nto school. Your work will grow--I can see ahead. Never a time when every\r\nman and woman and child could grow so much--and hand it on--and hand it\r\non--as you will do to your small son."\r\n\r\nHe felt her hand on his forehead, and for some moments nothing was said.\r\nVaguely in glimpses Roger saw his small grandson growing up; and he\r\npictured other children here, not her own but of her greater family, as the\r\ntwo merged into one. He felt that she would not grow old. Children, lives\r\nof children; work, dreams and aspirations. How bright it seemed as he\r\nstared ahead. Then he heard the cry of her baby.\r\n\r\n"Shall I nurse him here?" he heard her ask. He pressed her hand in answer.\r\nAnd when again he opened his eyes she was by his side with the child at her\r\nbreast. Its large round eyes, so pure and clear, gazed into his own for a\r\nlong, long time.\r\n\r\n"Now he\'s so sleepy," she whispered. "Would you like him beside you a\r\nmoment?"\r\n\r\n"Please."\r\n\r\nHe felt the faint scent of the tiny boy, and still those eyes looked into\r\nhis. He forgot his daughter standing there; and as he watched, a sweet\r\nfresh sense of the mystery of this life so new stole deep into his spirit.\r\nAll at once the baby fell asleep.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, little brother," he whispered. "God grant the world be very\r\nkind." He could feel the mother lift it up, and he heard the door close\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\nSmiling he, too, fell asleep. And after that there were only dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd his dreams were of children. Their faces passed before him. Now they\r\nwere young again in the house. They were eating their suppers, three small\r\ngirls, chattering like magpies. From her end of the table their mother\r\nsmiled quietly across at him. "Come children," she was saying, "that will\r\ndo for a little while." But Roger said, "Oh, let them talk."... Then he saw\r\nnew-comers. Bruce came in with Edith, and George and young Elizabeth, and\r\nAllan came with Deborah who had a baby in her arms, and Laura stood beside\r\nthem. Here were his three daughters, grown, but still in some uncanny way\r\nthey looked to him like children still; and behind them he detected figures\r\nlong forgotten, of boys and girls whom he had known far back in his own\r\nchildhood. John, too, had come into the house. Strangely now the walls were\r\ngone, had lifted, and a clamorous throng, laughing, shouting, pummeling,\r\nhedged him in on every hand--Deborah\'s big family!\r\n\r\nSoon the uproar wearied him, and Roger tried to shut them out, to bring\r\nback again the walls to his house. And sometimes he succeeded, and he was\r\nleft for a while in peace with Judith and his three small girls. But\r\ndespite his efforts to keep them there, new faces kept intruding. Swiftly\r\nhis small family grew, split into other families, and these were merged\r\nwith other figures pressing in from every side. Again he felt the presence\r\nof countless families all around, dividing, reuniting, with ceaseless\r\nchanges and fresh life--a never ending multitude. Here they were singing\r\nand dancing, and Laura gaily waved to him. At another place were only men,\r\nand they were struggling savagely to clutch things from each other\'s\r\nhands. A sea of scowling visages, angry shouts, fists clinched in air. And\r\nhe thought he saw Bruce for an instant. Behind them lay wide valleys\r\nobscured by heavy clouds of smoke, and he could hear the roar of guns. But\r\nthey vanished suddenly, and he saw women mourning now, and Edith with her\r\nchildren turned to him her anxious eyes. He tried to reach and help her,\r\nbut already she had gone. And behind her came huge bending forms, men\r\nheaving at great burdens, jaws set in scowls of fierce revolt. And John was\r\nthere on his crutches, and near him was a figure bound into a chair of\r\nsteel, with terror in the straining limbs, while in desperation Deborah\r\ntried to wrench him free. Abruptly Roger turned away.\r\n\r\nAnd in a twinkling all was gone, the tumult and the clamor, and he was in a\r\nsilent place high up on a mountain side. It was dusk. A herd of cattle\r\npassed, and George came close behind them. And around him Roger saw,\r\nemerging from the semi-dark, faces turning like his own to the summits of\r\nthe mountains and the billowy splendors there. It grew so dark he could see\r\nno more. There fell a deep silence, not a sound but the occasional chirp of\r\na bird or the faint whirr of an insect. Even the glow on the peaks was\r\ngone. Darkness, only darkness.\r\n\r\n"Surely this is death," he thought. After that he was alone. And presently\r\nfrom far away he heard the booming of a bell, deep and slow, sepulchral, as\r\nit measured off his life. Another silence followed, and this time it was\r\nmore profound; and with a breathless awe he knew that all the people who\r\nhad ever lived on earth were before him in the void to which he himself was\r\ndrifting: people of all nations, of countless generations reaching back and\r\nback and back to the beginnings of mankind: the mightiest family of all,\r\nthat had stumbled up through the ages, had slaved and starved and dreamed\r\nand died, had blindly hated, blindly killed, had raised up gods and idols\r\nand yearned for everlasting life, had laughed and played and danced along,\r\nhad loved and mated, given birth, had endlessly renewed itself and handed\r\non its heritage, had striven hungrily to learn, had groped its way in\r\ndarkness, and after all its struggles had come now barely to the dawn. And\r\nthen a voice within him cried,\r\n\r\n"What is humanity but a child? In the name of the dead I salute the\r\nunborn!"\r\n\r\nSlowly a glow appeared in his dream, and once again the scene had changed.\r\nThe light was coming from long rows of houses rising tall and steep out of\r\na teeming city street. And from these lighted houses children now came\r\npouring forth. They filled the street from wall to wall with a torrent of\r\nwarm vivid hues, they joined in mad tempestuous games, they shouted and\r\nthey danced with glee, they whirled each other \'round and \'round. The very\r\nair seemed quivering. Then was heard the crash of a band, and he saw them\r\nmarching into school. In and in and in they pressed, till the school seemed\r\nfairly bursting. Out they came by another way, and went off marching down\r\nthe street with the big flag waving at their head. He followed and saw the\r\nstreet divide into narrower streets and bye-ways, into roads and country\r\nlanes. And all were filled with children. In endless multitudes they\r\ncame--marching, marching, spreading, spreading, like wide bobbing fields of\r\nflowers rolling out across the land, toward a great round flashing sun\r\nabove a distant rim of hills.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose strangely dazzling. It filled the heavens with blinding light.\r\nHe felt himself drawn up and up--while from somewhere far behind he heard\r\nthe cry of Deborah\'s child. A clear sweet thrill of happiness came. And\r\nafter that--we do not know.\r\n\r\nFor he had left his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted in the United States of America\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of His Family, by Ernest Poole\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HIS FAMILY ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 14396-8.txt or 14396-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/3/9/14396/\r\n\r\nProduced by Rick Niles, Melissa Er-Raqabi and the PG Online\r\nDistributed Proofreading Team\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
