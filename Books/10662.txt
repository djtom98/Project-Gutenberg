And shame to be unborn, and\r\nall things to go wholesome and proper, out of an utter greatness of\r\nunderstanding; and the Man to be an Hero and a Child before the Woman;\r\nand the Woman to be an Holy Light of the Spirit and an Utter Companion\r\nand in the same time a glad Possession unto the Man.... And this doth be\r\nHuman Love...."\r\n\r\n"...for this to be the especial glory of Love, that it doth make unto\r\nall Sweetness and Greatness, and doth be a fire burning all Littleness;\r\nso that did all in this world to have met The Beloved, then did\r\nWantonness be dead, and there to grow Gladness and Charity, dancing in\r\nthe years."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nMIRDATH THE BEAUTIFUL\r\n\r\n\r\n    "And I cannot touch her face\r\n    And I cannot touch her hair,\r\n    And I kneel to empty shadows--\r\n    Just memories of her grace;\r\n    And her voice sings in the winds\r\n    And in the sobs of dawn\r\n    And among the flowers at night\r\n    And from the brooks at sunrise\r\n    And from the sea at sunset,\r\n    And I answer with vain callings ..."\r\n\r\nIt was the Joy of the Sunset that brought us to speech. I was gone a\r\nlong way from my house, walking lonely-wise, and stopping often that I\r\nview the piling upward of the Battlements of Evening, and to feel the\r\ndear and strange gathering of the Dusk come over all the world about me.\r\n\r\nThe last time that I paused, I was truly lost in a solemn joy of the\r\nGlory of the Coming Night; and maybe I laughed a little in my throat,\r\nstanding there alone in the midst of the Dusk upon the World. And, lo!\r\nmy content was answered out of the trees that bounded the country road\r\nupon my right; and it was so as that some one had said: "And thou also!"\r\nin glad understanding, that I laughed again a little in my throat; as\r\nthough I had only a half-believing that any true human did answer my\r\nlaugh; but rather some sweet Delusion or Spirit that was tuned to my\r\nmood.\r\n\r\nBut she spoke and called me by my name; and when I had gone to the side\r\nof the road, that I should see her somewhat, and discover whether I knew\r\nher, I saw that she was surely that lady, who for her beauty was known\r\nthrough all of that sweet County of Kent as Lady Mirdath the Beautiful;\r\nand a near neighbour to me; for the Estates of her Guardian abounded\r\nupon mine.\r\n\r\nYet, until that time, I had never met her; for I had been so oft and\r\nlong abroad; and so much given to my Studies and my Exercises when at\r\nhome, that I had no further Knowledge of her than Rumour gave to me odd\r\ntime; and for the rest, I was well content; for as I have given hint, my\r\nbooks held me, and likewise my Exercises; for I was always an athlete,\r\nand never met the man so quick or so strong as I did be; save in some\r\nfiction of a tale or in the mouth of a boaster.\r\n\r\nNow, I stood instantly with my hat in my hand; and answered her gentle\r\nbantering so well as I might, the while that I peered intent and\r\nwondering at her through the gloom; for truly Rumour had told no tale to\r\nequal the beauty of this strange maid; who now stood jesting with so\r\nsweet a spirit, and claiming kinship of Cousinhood with me, as was\r\ntruth, now that I did wake to think.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, she made no ado; but named me frank by my lad\'s name, and\r\ngave laughter and right to me to name her Mirdath, and nothing less or\r\nmore--at that time. And she bid me then to come up through the hedge,\r\nand make use of a gap that was her own especial secret, as she\r\nconfessed, when she took odd leave with her maid to some country frolic,\r\ndrest as village maids; but not to deceive many, as I dare believe.\r\n\r\nAnd I came up through the gap in the hedge and stood beside her; and\r\ntall she had seemed to me, when I looked up at her; and tall she was, in\r\ntruth; but indeed I was a great head taller. And she invited me then to\r\nwalk with her to the house, that I meet her Guardian and give word to my\r\nsorrow that I had so long neglected to make call upon them; and truly\r\nher eyes to shine with mischief and delight, as she named me so for my\r\namissness.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, she grew sober in a moment, and she set up her finger to me\r\nto hush, as that she heard somewhat in the wood that lay all the way\r\nupon our right. And, indeed, something I heard too; for there was surely\r\na rustling of the leaves, and anon a dead twig crackt with a sound clear\r\nand sharp in the stillness.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately there came three men running out of the wood at me; and\r\nI called to them sharply to keep off or beware of harm; and I put the\r\nmaid to my back with my left hand, and had my oak staff ready for my\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nBut the three men gave out no word of reply; but ran in at me; and I saw\r\nsomewhat of the gleam of knives; and at that, I moved very glad and\r\nbrisk to the attack; and behind me there went shrill and sweet, the call\r\nof a silver whistle; for the Maid was whistling for her dogs; and maybe\r\nthe call was also a signal to the men-servants of her house.\r\n\r\nYet, truly, there was no use in help that was yet to come; for the need\r\ndid be then and instant; and I nowise loath to use my strength before\r\nmy sweet cousin. And I stepped forward, briskly, as I have told; and\r\nthe end of my staff I drove into the body of the left-ward man, so that\r\nhe dropped like a dead man. And I hit very sharply at the head of\r\nanother, and surely crackt it for him; for he made instantly upon the\r\nearth; but the third man I met with my fist, and neither had he any\r\ngreat need of a second blow; but went instant to join his companions,\r\nand the fight thus to have ended before it was even proper begun, and I\r\nlaughing a little with a proper pride, to know the bewilderment that I\r\nperceived in the way that the Lady Mirdath, my cousin, stood and\r\nregarded me through the dusk of the hushed even.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, there was no time left to us, before there came bounding\r\nup, three great boar-hounds, that had been loosed to her whistle; and\r\nshe had some ado to keep the brutes off me; and I then to beat them off\r\nthe men upon the earth, lest they maul them as they lay. And directly,\r\nthere was a noise of men shouting, and the light of lanthorns in the\r\nnight, and the footmen of the house to come running with lanthorns and\r\ncudgels; and knew not whether to deal with me, or not, in the first\r\nmoment, even as the dogs; but when they saw the men upon the ground, and\r\nlearned my name and saw me proper, they kept well their distance and had\r\nno lack of respect; but, indeed, my sweet cousin to have the most of\r\nany; only that she showed no intent to keep distance of me; but to have\r\na new and deeper feeling of kinship than she at first had shown.\r\n\r\nAnd the men-servants asked what should be done with the foot-pads;\r\nseeing that they were now recovering. But, indeed, I left the matter,\r\nalong with some silver, to the servants; and very sound justice they\r\ndealt out to the men; for I heard their cries a good while after we had\r\ngone away.\r\n\r\nNow, when we were come up to the Hall, my cousin must take me in to her\r\nGuardian, Sir Alfred Jarles, an old man and venerable that I knew a\r\nlittle in passing and because our estates abounded. And she praised me\r\nto my face, yet quaintly-wise; and the old man, her Guardian thanked me\r\nmost honourably and with a nice courtesy; so that I was a welcome\r\nhouse-friend from that time onward.\r\n\r\nAnd I stayed all that evening, and dined, and afterward went out again\r\ninto the home-grounds with the Lady Mirdath; and she more friendly to me\r\nthan ever any woman had been; and seemed to me as that she had known me\r\nalways. And, truly, I had the same feeling in my heart towards her; for\r\nit was, somehow, as though we knew each the way and turn of the other,\r\nand had a constant delight to find this thing and that thing to be in\r\ncommon; but no surprise; save that so pleasant a truth had so natural a\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nAnd one thing there was that I perceived held the Lady Mirdath all that\r\ndear fore-night; and this was, indeed, the way that I had my pleasure so\r\neasy with the three foot-pads. And she asked me plainly whether I was\r\nnot truly very strong; and when I laughed with young and natural pride,\r\nshe caught my arm suddenly to discover for herself how strong I might\r\nbe. And, surely, she loosed it even the more sudden, and with a little\r\ngasping of astonishment, because it was so great and hard. And\r\nafterward, she walked by me very silent, and seeming thoughtful; but she\r\nwent never any great way off from me.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, if the Lady Mirdath had a strange pleasure in my strength, I\r\nhad likewise a constant wonder and marvel in her beauty, that had shown\r\nbut the more lovely in the candle-light at dinner.\r\n\r\nBut there were further delights to me in the days that came; for I had\r\nhappiness in the way that she had pleasure of the Mystery of the\r\nEvening, and the Glamour of Night, and the Joy of Dawn, and all\r\nsuchlike.\r\n\r\nAnd one evening, that I ever remember, as we wandered in the park-lands,\r\nshe began to say--half unthinking--that it was truly an elves-night. And\r\nshe stopped herself immediately; as though she thought I should have no\r\nunderstanding; but, indeed, I was upon mine own familiar ground of\r\ninward delight; and I replied in a quiet and usual voice, that the\r\nTowers of Sleep would grow that night, and I felt in my bones that it\r\nwas a night to find the Giant\'s Tomb, or the Tree with the Great Painted\r\nHead, or--And surely I stopped very sudden; for she gripped me in that\r\nmoment, and her hand shook as she held me; but when I would ask her what\r\nailed, she bid me, very breathless, to say on, to say on. And, with a\r\nhalf understanding, I told her that I had but meant to speak of the Moon\r\nGarden, that was an olden and happy fancy of mine.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, when I said that, the Lady Mirdath cried out something\r\nin a strange low voice, and brought me to a halt, that she might face\r\nme. And she questioned me very earnest; and I answered just so earnest\r\nas she; for I was grown suddenly to an excitement, in that I perceived\r\nshe knew also. And, in verity, she told me that she had knowledge; but\r\nhad thought that she was alone in the world with her knowledge of that\r\nstrange land of her dreams; and now to find that I also had travelled in\r\nthose dear, strange dream lands. And truly the marvel of it--the marvel\r\nof it! As she to say time and oft. And again, as we walked, she gave out\r\nword that there was little wonder she had been urged to call to me that\r\nnight, as she saw me pause upon the road; though, indeed, she had\r\nlearned of our cousin-ship before, having seen me go by on my horse\r\npretty oft, and inquired concerning me; and mayhap daintily irked that I\r\nhad so little heed of Lady Mirdath the Beautiful. But, indeed, I had\r\nthought of other matters; yet had been human enough, had I but met her\r\nproper before I see her.\r\n\r\nNow you must not think that I was not utter stirred by the wonder of\r\nthis thing, that we had both a dreamful knowledge of the same matters,\r\nof which each had thought none other knew. Yet, when I questioned more,\r\nthere was much that had been in my fancies that was foreign to her, and\r\nlikewise much that had been familiar to her, that was of no meaning to\r\nme. But though there was this, that brought a little regret to us, there\r\nwould be, time and again, some new thing that one told, that the other\r\nknew and could finish the telling of, to the gladness and amazement of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nAnd so shall you picture us wandering and having constant speech, so\r\nthat, hour by hour, we grew gladly aged in dear knowledge and sweet\r\nfriendship of the other.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, how the time passed, I know not; but there came presently a\r\nhullabaloo, and the shouts of men\'s voices and the baying of dogs, and\r\nthe gleam of lanthorns, so that I knew not what to think; until, very\r\nsudden, and with a sweet and strange little laughter, the Lady Mirdath\r\nto perceive that we had missed the hours utter in our converse; so that\r\nher Guardian (made uneasy because of the three foot-pads) had ordered a\r\nsearch. And we all that time a-wander together in happy forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nAnd we turned homeward, then, and came towards the lights; but indeed,\r\nthe dogs found us before we were come there; and they had grown to know\r\nme now, and leaped about me, barking very friendly; and so in a minute\r\nthe men had discovered us, and were gone back to tell Sir Jarles that\r\nall was well.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the way of our meeting and the growing of our acquaintance,\r\nand the beginning of my great love for Mirdath the Beautiful.\r\n\r\nNow, from that time onward, evening by evening would I go a-wander along\r\nthe quiet and country road that led from my estate to the estate of Sir\r\nJarles. And always I went inward by the hedge-gap; and oft I should find\r\nthe Lady Mirdath walking in that part of the woods; but always with her\r\ngreat boar-hounds about her; for I had begged that she do this thing for\r\nher sweet safety; and she to seem wishful to pleasure me; but truly to\r\nbe just so oft utter perverse in diverse matters; and to strive to\r\nplague me, as though she would discover how much I would endure and how\r\nfar she might go to anger me.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, well I remember how that one night, coming to the hedge-gap,\r\nI saw two country-maids come thence out from the woods of Sir Jarles\';\r\nbut they were naught to me, and I would have gone upward through the\r\ngap, as ever; only that, as they passed me, they curtseyed somewhat\r\nover-graceful for rough wenches. And I had a sudden thought, and came up\r\nto them to see them more anigh; and truly I thought the taller was\r\nsurely the Lady Mirdath. But, indeed, I could not be sure; for when I\r\nasked who she did be, she only to simper and to curtsey again; and so\r\nwas I very natural all in doubt; but yet sufficient in wonder (having\r\nsome knowledge of the Lady Mirdath) to follow the wenches, the which I\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nAnd they then, very speedy and sedate, as though I were some rack-rape\r\nthat they did well to be feared of alone at night; and so came at last\r\nto the village green, where a great dance was a-foot, with torches, and\r\na wandering fiddler to set the tune; and ale in plenty.\r\n\r\nAnd the two to join the dance, and danced very hearty; but had only each\r\nthe other for a partner, and had a good care to avoid the torches. And\r\nby this, I was pretty sure that they were truly the Lady Mirdath and her\r\nmaid; and so I took chance when they had danced somewhat my way, to step\r\nover to them, and ask boldly for a dance. But, indeed, the tall one\r\nanswered, simpering, that she was promised; and immediately gave her\r\nhand to a great hulking farmer-lout, and went round the green with him;\r\nand well punished she was for her waywardness; for she had all her skill\r\nto save her pretty feet from his loutish stampings; and very glad she\r\nwas to meet the end of the dance.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew now for certainty that it was Mirdath the Beautiful, despite\r\nher plan of disguise, and the darkness and the wench\'s dress and the\r\nfoot-gear that marred her step so great. And I walked across to her, and\r\nnamed her, whispering, by name; and gave her plain word to be done of\r\nthis unwisdom, and I would take her home. But she to turn from me, and\r\nshe stamped her foot, and went again to the lout; and when she had\r\nsuffered another dance with him, she bid him be her escort a part of the\r\nway; the which he was nothing loath of.\r\n\r\nAnd another lad, that was mate to him, went likewise; and in a moment,\r\nso soon as they were gone away from the light of the torches, the rough\r\nhind-lads made to set their arms about the waists of the two wenches,\r\nnot wetting who they had for companions. And the Lady Mirdath was no\r\nlonger able to endure, and cried out in her sudden fear and disgust, and\r\nstruck the rough hind that embraced her, so hard that he loosed her a\r\nmoment, swearing great oaths. And directly he came back to her again,\r\nand had her in a moment, to kiss her; and she, loathing him to the very\r\ndeath, beat him madly in the face with her hands; but to no end, only\r\nthat I was close upon them. And, in that moment, she screamed my name\r\naloud; and I caught the poor lout and hit him once, but not to harm him\r\novermuch; yet to give him a long memory of me; and afterward I threw him\r\ninto the side of the road. But the second hind, having heard my name,\r\nloosed from the tiring-maid, and ran for his life; and, indeed, my\r\nstrength was known all about that part.\r\n\r\nAnd I caught Mirdath the Beautiful by her shoulders, and shook her very\r\nsoundly, in my anger. And afterward, I sent the maid onward; and she,\r\nhaving no word from her Mistress to stay, went forward a little; and in\r\nthis fashion we came at last to the hedge-gap, with the Lady Mirdath\r\nvery hushed; but yet walking anigh to me, as that she had some secret\r\npleasure of my nearness. And I led her through the gap, and so homeward\r\nto the Hall; and there bid her good-night at a side door that she held\r\nthe key of. And, truly, she bid me good-night in an utter quiet voice;\r\nand was almost as that she had no haste to be gone from me that night.\r\n\r\nYet, when I met her on the morrow, she was full of a constant impudence\r\nto me; so that, having her alone to myself, when the dusk was come, I\r\nasked her why she would never be done of her waywardness; because that I\r\nached to have companionship of her; and, instead, she denied my need.\r\nAnd, at that, she was at once very gentle; and full of a sweet and\r\nwinsome understanding; and surely knew that I wished to be rested; for\r\nshe brought out her harp, and played me dear olden melodies of our\r\nchildhood-days all that evening; and so had my love for her the more\r\nintent and glad. And she saw me that night to the hedge-gap, having her\r\nthree great boar-hounds with her, to company her home again. But,\r\nindeed, I followed her afterwards, very silent, until I saw her safe\r\ninto the Hall; for I would not have her alone in the night; though she\r\nbelieved that I was then far away on the country road. And as she walked\r\nwith her dogs, one or another would run back to me, to nose against me\r\nfriendly-wise; but I sent them off again very quiet; and she had no\r\nknowledge of aught; for she to go singing a love-song quietly all the\r\nway home. But whether she loved me, I could not tell; though she had a\r\nnice affection for me.\r\n\r\nNow, on the following evening, I went somewhat early to the gap; and lo!\r\nwho should be standing in the gap, talking to the Lady Mirdath; but a\r\nvery clever-drest man, that had a look of the Court about him; and he,\r\nwhen I approached, made no way for me through the gap; but stood firm,\r\nand eyed me very insolent; so that I put out my hand, and lifted him\r\nfrom my way.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! the Lady Mirdath turned a bitterness of speech upon me that gave\r\nme an utter pain and astonishment; so that I was assured in a moment\r\nthat she had no true love for me, or she had never striven so to put me\r\nto shame before the stranger, and named me uncouth and brutal to a\r\nsmaller man. And, indeed, you shall perceive how I was in my heart in\r\nthat moment.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw that there was some seeming of justice in what the Lady\r\nMirdath said; but yet might the man have shown a better spirit; and\r\nmoreover Mirdath the Beautiful had no true call to shame me, her true\r\nfriend and cousin, before this stranger. Yet did I not stop to argue;\r\nbut bowed very low to the Lady Mirdath; and afterward I bowed a little\r\nto the man and made apology; for, indeed, he was neither great nor\r\nstrong-made; and I had been better man to have shown courtesy to him; at\r\nleast in the first.\r\n\r\nAnd so, having done justice to my own respect, I turned and went on, and\r\nleft them to their happiness.\r\n\r\nNow, I walked then, maybe twenty good miles, before I came to my own\r\nhome; for there was no rest in me all that night, or ever, because that\r\nI was grown deadly in love of Mirdath the Beautiful; and all my spirit\r\nand heart and body of me pained with the dreadful loss that I was come\r\nso sudden upon.\r\n\r\nAnd for a great week I had my walks in another direction; but in the end\r\nof that week, I must take my walk along the olden way, that I might\r\nchance to have but a sight of My Lady. And, truly, I had all sight that\r\never man did need to put him in dread pain and jealousy; for, truly, as\r\nI came in view of the gap, there was the Lady Mirdath walking just\r\nwithout the borders of the great wood; and beside her there walked the\r\nclever-drest man of the Court, and she suffered his arm around her, so\r\nthat I knew they were lovers; for the Lady Mirdath had no brothers nor\r\nany youthful men kin.\r\n\r\nYet, when Mirdath saw me upon the road, she shamed in a moment to be so\r\ncaught; for she put her lover\'s arm from about her, and bowed to me, a\r\nlittle changed of colour in the face; and I bowed very low--being but a\r\nyoung man myself--; and so passed on, with my heart very dead in me. And\r\nas I went, I saw that her lover came again to her, and had his arm once\r\nmore about her; and so, maybe, they looked after me, as I went very\r\nstiff and desperate; but, indeed, I looked not back on them, as you may\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nAnd for a great month then, I went not near to the gap; for my love\r\nraged in me, and I was hurt in my pride; and, truly, neither had a true\r\njustice been dealt to me by the Lady Mirdath. Yet in that month, my love\r\nwas a leaven in me, and made slowly a sweetness and a tenderness and an\r\nunderstanding that were not in me before; and truly Love and Pain do\r\nshape the Character of Man.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end of that time, I saw a little way into Life, with an\r\nunderstanding heart, and began presently to take my walks again past the\r\ngap; but truly Mirdath the Beautiful was never to my sight; though one\r\nevening I thought she might be not a great way off; for one of her great\r\nboar-hounds came out of the wood, and down into the road to nose against\r\nme, very friendly, as a dog oft doth with me.\r\n\r\nYet, though I waited a good time after the dog had left me, I had no\r\nsight of Mirdath, and so passed on again, with my heart heavy in me; but\r\nwithout bitterness, because of the understanding that was begun to grow\r\nin my heart.\r\n\r\nNow, there passed two weary and lonely weeks, in which I grew sick to\r\nhave knowledge of the beautiful maid. And, truly, in the end of that\r\ntime, I made a sudden resolving that I would go in through the gap, and\r\ncome to the home-grounds about the Hall, and so maybe have some sight of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd this resolving I had one evening; and I went out immediately, and\r\ncame to the gap, and went in through the gap, and so by a long walking\r\nto the gardens about the Hall. And, truly, when I was come there, I saw\r\na good light of lanthorns and torches, and a great company of people\r\ndancing; and all drest in quaint dress; so that I knew they had a\r\nfestival for some cause. And there came suddenly a horrid dread into my\r\nheart that this might be the marriage-dance of the Lady Mirdath; but,\r\nindeed, this was foolishness; for I had surely heard of the marriage, if\r\nthere had been any. And, truly, in a moment, I remembered that she was\r\ncome one-and-twenty years of age on that day, and to the end of her\r\nward-ship; and this surely to be festival in honour of the same.\r\n\r\nAnd a very bright and pretty matter it was to watch, save that I was so\r\nheavy in the heart with loneliness and longing; for the company was\r\ngreat and gay, and the lights plentiful and set all about from the\r\ntrees; and in leaf-made arbours about the great lawn. And a great table\r\nspread with eating matters and silver and crystal, and great lamps of\r\nbronze and silver went all a-down one end of the lawn; and the dance\r\nconstant upon the other part.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, the Lady Mirdath to step out of the dance, very lovely\r\ndrest; yet seeming, to mine eyes, a little pale in the looming of the\r\nlights. And she to wander to a seat to rest; and, indeed, in a moment,\r\nthere to be a dozen youths of the great families of the country-side, in\r\nattendance about her, making talk and laughter, and each eager for her\r\nfavour; and she very lovely in the midst of them, but yet, as I did\r\nthink, lacking of somewhat, and a little pale-seeming, as I have told;\r\nand her glance to go odd-wise beyond the groupt men about her; so that I\r\nunderstood in a moment that her lover was not there, and she to be\r\na-lack in the heart for him. Yet, why he was not there, I could not\r\nsuppose, save that he might have been called back to the Court.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely, as I watched the other young men about her, I burned with a\r\nfierce and miserable jealousy of them; so that I could near have stept\r\nforth and plucked her out from among them, and had her to walk with me\r\nin the woods, as in the olden days, when she also had seemed near to\r\nlove. But, truly, what use to this? For it was not they who held her\r\nheart, as I saw plain; for I watched her, with an eager and lonesome\r\nheart, and knew that it was one small man of the Court that was lover to\r\nher, as I have told.\r\n\r\nAnd I went away again then, and came not near to the gap for three great\r\nmonths, because that I could not bear the pain of my loss; but in the\r\nend of that time, my very pain to urge me to go, and to be worse than\r\nthe pain of not going; so that I found myself one evening in the gap,\r\npeering, very eager and shaken, across the sward that lay between the\r\ngap and the woods; for this same place to be as an holy ground to me;\r\nfor there was it that first I saw Mirdath the Beautiful, and surely lost\r\nmy heart to her in that one night.\r\n\r\nAnd a great time I stayed there in the gap, waiting and watching\r\nhopelessly. And lo! sudden there came something against me, touching my\r\nthigh very soft; and when I looked down, it was one of the boar-hounds,\r\nso that my heart leaped, near frightened; for truly My Lady was come\r\nsomewhere nigh, as I did think.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I waited, very hushed and watchful; yet with an utter beating\r\nheart; surely I heard a faint and low singing among the trees, so utter\r\nsad. And lo! it was Mirdath singing a broken love song, and a-wander\r\nthere in the dark alone, save for her great dogs.\r\n\r\nAnd I harked, with strange pain in me, that she did be so in pain; and I\r\nached to bring her ease; yet moved not, but was very still there in the\r\ngap; save that my being was all in turmoil.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, as I harked, there came a slim white figure out from\r\namong the trees; and the figure cried out something, and came to a quick\r\npause, as I could see in the half-dark. And lo! in that moment, there\r\ncame a sudden and unreasoned hope into me; and I came up out of the gap,\r\nand was come to Mirdath in a moment, calling very low and passionate and\r\neager: "Mirdath! Mirdath! Mirdath!"\r\n\r\nAnd this way I came to her; and her great dog that was with me, to bound\r\nbeside me, in thought, mayhap, that it was some game. And when I came to\r\nthe Lady Mirdath, I held out my hands to her, not knowing what I did;\r\nbut only the telling of my heart that needed her so utter, and craved to\r\nease her of her pain. And lo! she put out her arms to me, and came into\r\nmine arms with a little run. And there she bode, weeping strangely; but\r\nyet with rest upon her; even as rest was come sudden and wondrous upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden, she moved in mine arms, and slipt her hands to me, very\r\ndear, and held her lips up to me, like some sweet child, that I kiss\r\nher; but, indeed, she was also a true woman, and in honest and dear love\r\nof me.\r\n\r\nAnd this to be the way of our betrothal; and simple and wordless it was;\r\nyet sufficient, only that there is no sufficiency in Love.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, she loosed herself out of mine arms, and we walked\r\nhomeward through the woods, very quiet, and holding hands, as children\r\ndo. And I then in a while to ask her about the man of the Court; and she\r\nlaughed very sweet into the silence of the wood; but gave me no answer,\r\nsave that I wait until we were come to the Hall.\r\n\r\nAnd when we were come there, she took me into the great hall, and made a\r\nvery dainty and impudent bow, mocking me. And so made me known to\r\nanother lady, who sat there, upon her task of embroidering, which she\r\ndid very demure, and as that she had also a dainty Mischief lurking in\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, the Lady Mirdath never to be done of naughty laughter, that\r\nmade her dearly breathless with delight, and to sway a little, and set\r\nthe trembling of pretty sounds in her throat; and surely she must pull\r\ndown two great pistols from an arm-rack, that I fight a duel to the\r\ndeath with the lady of the embroidering, who held her face down over her\r\nwork, and shook likewise with the wickedness of her laughter that she\r\ncould not hide.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end, the Lady of the Embroidering looked up sudden into my\r\nface; and I then to see somewhat of the mischief in a moment; for she\r\nhad the face of the man of the Court suit, that had been lover to\r\nMirdath.\r\n\r\nAnd the Lady Mirdath then to explain to me how that Mistress Alison\r\n(which was her name) was a dear and bosom friend, and she it was that\r\nhad been drest in the Court suit to play a prank for a wager with a\r\ncertain young man who would be lover to her, an he might. And I then to\r\ncome along, and so speedy to offence that truly I never saw her face\r\nplain, because that I was so utter jealous. And so the Lady Mirdath had\r\nbeen more justly in anger than I supposed, because that I had put hands\r\nupon her friend, as I have told.\r\n\r\nAnd this to be all of it, save that they had planned to punish me, and\r\nhad met every evening at the gap, to play at lovers, perchance I should\r\npass, so that I should have greater cause for my jealousy, and truly\r\nthey to have a good revenge upon me; for I had suffered very great a\r\nlong while because of it.\r\n\r\nYet, as you do mind, when I came upon them, the Lady Mirdath had a\r\nhalf-regret, that was very natural, because even then she was in love of\r\nme, as I of her; and because of this, she drew away, as you shall\r\nremember, being--as she confessed--suddenly and strangely troubled and\r\nto want me; but afterwards as much set again to my punishment, because\r\nthat I bowed so cold and went away. And indeed well I might.\r\n\r\nYet, truly, all was safe ended now, and I utter thankful and with a mad\r\ndelight in the heart; so that I caught up Mirdath, and we danced very\r\nslow and stately around the great hall, the while that Mistress Alison\r\nwhistled us a tune with her mouth, which she could very clever, as many\r\nanother thing, I wot.\r\n\r\nAnd each day and all day after this Gladness, Mirdath and I could never\r\nbe apart; but must go a-wander always together, here and there, in an\r\nunending joy of our togetherness.\r\n\r\nAnd in a thousand things were we at one in delight; for we had both of\r\nus that nature which doth love the blue of eternity which gathers beyond\r\nthe wings of the sunset; and the invisible sound of the starlight\r\nfalling upon the world; and the quiet of grey evenings when the Towers\r\nof Sleep are builded unto the mystery of the Dusk; and the solemn green\r\nof strange pastures in the moonlight; and the speech of the sycamore\r\nunto the beech; and the slow way of the sea when it doth mood; and the\r\nsoft rustling of the night clouds. And likewise had we eyes to see the\r\nDancer of the Sunset, casting her mighty robes so strange; and ears to\r\nknow that there shakes a silent thunder over the Face of Dawn; and much\r\nelse that we knew and saw and understood together in our utter joy.\r\n\r\nNow, there happened to us about this time a certain adventure that came\r\nnear to cause the death of Mirdath the Beautiful; for one day as we\r\nwandered, as ever, like two children in our contentment, I made remark\r\nto Mirdath that there went only two of the great boar-hounds with us;\r\nand she then told me that the third was to the kennels, being sick.\r\n\r\nYet, scarce had she told me so much; ere she cried out something and\r\npointed; and lo! I saw that the third hound came towards us, at a run,\r\nyet very strange-seeming in his going. And in a moment, Mirdath cried\r\nout that the hound was mad; and truly, I saw then that the brute\r\nslavered as he came running.\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment he was upon us, and made never a sound; but leaped at me\r\nin one instant of time; all before I had any thought of such intent. But\r\nsurely, My Beautiful One had a dreadful love for me, for she cast\r\nherself at the dog, to save me, calling to the other hounds. And she was\r\nbitten in a moment by the brute, as she strove to hold him off from me.\r\nBut I to have him instant by the neck and the body, and brake him, so\r\nthat he died at once; and I cast him to the earth, and gave help to\r\nMirdath, that I draw the poison from the wounds.\r\n\r\nAnd this I did so well as I might, despite that she would have me stop.\r\nAnd afterwards, I took her into mine arms, and ran very fierce all the\r\nlong and weary way to the Hall, and with hot skewers I burned the\r\nwounds; so that when the doctor came, he to say I have saved her by my\r\ncare, if indeed she to be saved. But, truly, she had saved me in any\r\nwise, as you shall think; so that I could never be done of honour to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd she very pale; but yet to laugh at my fears, and to say that she\r\nsoon to have her health, and the wounds healed very speedy; but, indeed,\r\nit was a long and bitter time before they were proper healed, and she so\r\nwell as ever. Yet, in time, so it was; and an utter weight off my heart.\r\n\r\nAnd when Mirdath was grown full strong again, we set our wedding day.\r\nAnd well do I mind how she stood there in her bridal dress, on that day,\r\nso slender and lovely as may Love have stood in the Dawn of Life; and\r\nthe beauty of her eyes that had such sober sweetness in them, despite\r\nthe dear mischief of her nature; and the way of her little feet, and the\r\nloveliness of her hair; and the dainty rogue-grace of her movements; and\r\nher mouth an enticement, as that a child and a woman smiled out of the\r\none face. And this to be no more than but an hint of the loveliness of\r\nMy Beautiful One.\r\n\r\nAnd so we were married.\r\n\r\nMirdath, My Beautiful One, lay dying, and I had no power to hold Death\r\nbackward from such dread intent. In another room, I heard the little\r\nwail of the child; and the wail of the child waked my wife back into\r\nthis life, so that her hands fluttered white and desperately needful\r\nupon the coverlid.\r\n\r\nI kneeled beside My Beautiful One, and reached out and took her hands\r\nvery gentle into mine; but still they fluttered so needful; and she\r\nlooked at me, dumbly; but her eyes beseeching.\r\n\r\nThen I went out of the room, and called gently to the Nurse; and the\r\nNurse brought in the child, wrapped very softly in a long, white robe.\r\nAnd I saw the eyes of My Beautiful One grow clearer with a strange,\r\nlovely light; and I beckoned to the Nurse to bring the babe near.\r\n\r\nMy wife moved her hands very weakly upon the coverlid, and I knew that\r\nshe craved to touch her child; and I signed to the Nurse, and took my\r\nchild in mine arms; and the Nurse went out from the room, and so we\r\nthree were alone together.\r\n\r\nThen I sat very gentle upon the bed; and I held the babe near to My\r\nBeautiful One, so that the wee cheek of the babe touched the white cheek\r\nof my dying wife; but the weight of the child I kept off from her.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I knew that Mirdath, My Wife, strove dumbly to reach for\r\nthe hands of the babe; and I turned the child more towards her, and\r\nslipped the hands of the child into the weak hands of My Beautiful One.\r\nAnd I held the babe above my wife, with an utter care; so that the eyes\r\nof my dying One, looked into the young eyes of the child. And presently,\r\nin but a few moments of time; though it had been someways an eternity,\r\nMy Beautiful One closed her eyes and lay very quiet. And I took away the\r\nchild to the Nurse, who stood beyond the door. And I closed the door,\r\nand came back to Mine Own, that we have those last instants alone\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAnd the hands of my wife lay very still and white; but presently they\r\nbegan to move softly and weakly, searching for somewhat; and I put out\r\nmy great hands to her, and took her hands with an utter care; and so a\r\nlittle time passed.\r\n\r\nThen her eyes opened, quiet and grey, and a little dazed seeming; and\r\nshe rolled her head on the pillow and saw me; and the pain of\r\nforgetfulness went out of her eyes, and she looked at me with a look\r\nthat grew in strength, unto a sweetness of tenderness and full\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nAnd I bent a little to her; and her eyes told me to take her into mine\r\narms for those last minutes. Then I went very gentle upon the bed, and\r\nlifted her with an utter and tender care, so that she lay suddenly\r\nstrangely restful against my breast; for Love gave me skill to hold her,\r\nand Love gave My Beautiful One a sweetness of ease in that little time\r\nthat was left to us.\r\n\r\nAnd so we twain were together; and Love seemed that it had made a truce\r\nwith Death in the air about us, that we be undisturbed; for there came a\r\ndrowse of rest even upon my tense heart, that had known nothing but a\r\ndreadful pain through the weary hours.\r\n\r\nAnd I whispered my love silently to My Beautiful One, and her eyes\r\nanswered; and the strangely beautiful and terrible moments passed by\r\ninto the hush of eternity.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly, Mirdath My Beautiful One, spoke,--whispering something.\r\nAnd I stooped gently to hark; and Mine Own spoke again; and lo! it was\r\nto call me by the olden Love Name that had been mine through all the\r\nutter lovely months of our togetherness.\r\n\r\nAnd I began again to tell her of my love, that should pass beyond death;\r\nand lo! in that one moment of time, the light went out of her eyes; and\r\nMy Beautiful One lay dead in mine arms ... My Beautiful One....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE LAST REDOUBT\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Mirdath, My Beautiful One, died and left me lonely in this world,\r\nI have suffered an anguish, and an utter and dreadful pain of longing,\r\nsuch as truly no words shall ever tell; for, in truth, I that had all\r\nthe world through her sweet love and companionship, and knew all the joy\r\nand gladness of Life, have known such lonesome misery as doth stun me to\r\nthink upon.\r\n\r\nYet am I to my pen again; for of late a wondrous hope has grown in me,\r\nin that I have, at night in my sleep, waked into the future of this\r\nworld, and seen strange things and utter marvels, and known once more\r\nthe gladness of life; for I have learned the promise of the future, and\r\nhave visited in my dreams those places where in the womb of Time, she\r\nand I shall come together, and part, and again come together--breaking\r\nasunder most drearly in pain, and again reuniting after strange ages, in\r\na glad and mighty wonder.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the utter strange story of that which I have seen, and\r\nwhich, truly, I must set out, if the task be not too great; so that, in\r\nthe setting out thereof, I may gain a little ease of the heart; and\r\nlikewise, mayhap, give ease of hope to some other poor human, that doth\r\nsuffer, even as I have suffered so dreadful with longing for Mine Own\r\nthat is dead.\r\n\r\nAnd some shall read and say that this thing was not, and some shall\r\ndispute with them; but to them all I say naught, save "Read!" And having\r\nread that which I set down, then shall one and all have looked towards\r\nEternity with me--unto its very portals. And so to my telling:\r\n\r\nTo me, in this last time of my visions, of which I would tell, it was\r\nnot as if I _dreamed_; but, as it were, that I _waked_ there into the\r\ndark, _in the future of this world_. And the sun had died; and for me\r\nthus newly waked into that Future, to look back upon this, our Present\r\nAge, was to look back into dreams that my soul knew to be of reality;\r\nbut which to those newly-seeing eyes of mine, appeared but as a far\r\nvision, strangely hallowed with peacefulness and light.\r\n\r\nAlways, it seemed to me when I awaked into the Future, into the\r\nEverlasting Night that lapped this world, that I saw near to me, and\r\ngirdling me all about, a blurred greyness. And presently this, the\r\ngreyness, would clear and fade from about me, even as a dusky cloud, and\r\nI would look out upon a world of darkness, lit here and there with\r\nstrange sights. And with my waking into that Future, I waked not to\r\nignorance; but to a full knowledge of those things which lit the Night\r\nLand; even as a man wakes from sleep each morning, and knows immediately\r\nhe wakes, the names and knowledge of the Time which has bred him, and in\r\nwhich he lives. And the same while, a knowledge I had, as it were\r\nsub-conscious, of this Present--this early life, which now I live so\r\nutterly alone.\r\n\r\nIn my earliest knowledge of _that_ place, I was a youth, seventeen years\r\ngrown, and my memory tells me that when first I waked, or came, as it\r\nmight be said, to myself, in that Future, I stood in one of the\r\nembrasures of the Last Redoubt--that great Pyramid of grey metal which\r\nheld the last millions of this world from the Powers of the Slayers.\r\n\r\nAnd so full am I of the knowledge of that Place, that scarce can I\r\nbelieve that none here know; and because I have such difficulty, it may\r\nbe that I speak over familiarly of those things of which I know; and\r\nheed not to explain much that it is needful that I should explain to\r\nthose who must read here, in this our present day. For there, as I stood\r\nand looked out, I was less the man of years of _this_ age, than the\r\nyouth of _that_, with the natural knowledge of _that_ life which I had\r\ngathered by living all my seventeen years of life there; though, until\r\nthat my first vision, I (of this Age) knew not of that other and Future\r\nExistence; yet woke to it so naturally as may a man wake here in his bed\r\nto the shining of the morning sun, and know it by name, and the meaning\r\nof aught else. And yet, as I stood there in the vast embrasure, I had\r\nalso a knowledge, or memory, of this present life of ours, deep down\r\nwithin me; but touched with a halo of dreams, and yet with a conscious\r\nlonging for One, known even there in a half memory as Mirdath.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, in my earliest memory, I mind that I stood in an\r\nembrasure, high up in the side of the Pyramid, and looked outwards\r\nthrough a queer spy-glass to the North-West. Aye, full of youth and with\r\nan adventurous and yet half-fearful heart.\r\n\r\nAnd in my brain was, as I have told, the knowledge that had come to me\r\nin all the years of my life in the Redoubt; and yet until that moment,\r\nthis _Man of this Present Time_ had no knowledge of that future\r\nexistence; and now I stood and had suddenly the knowledge of a life\r\nalready spent in that strange land, and deeper within me the misty\r\nknowings of this our present Age, and, maybe, also of some others.\r\n\r\nTo the North-West I looked through the queer spy-glass, and saw a\r\nlandscape that I had looked upon and pored upon through all the years of\r\nthat life, so that I knew how to name this thing and that thing, and\r\ngive the very distances of each and every one from the "Centre-Point" of\r\nthe Pyramid, which was that which had neither length nor breadth, and\r\nwas made of polished metal in the Room of Mathematics, where I went\r\ndaily to my studies.\r\n\r\nTo the North-West I looked, and in the wide field of my glass, saw plain\r\nthe bright glare of the fire from the Red Pit, shine upwards against the\r\nunderside of the vast chin of the North-West Watcher--The Watching Thing\r\nof the North-West.... "That which hath Watched from the Beginning, and\r\nuntil the opening of the Gateway of Eternity" came into my thoughts, as\r\nI looked through the glass ... the words of Aesworpth, the _Ancient_\r\nPoet (though incredibly _future_ to this our time). And suddenly they\r\nseemed at fault; for I looked deep down into my being, and saw, as\r\ndreams are seen, the sunlight and splendour of _this_ our Present Age.\r\nAnd I was amazed.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must make it clear to all that, even as I waked from _this_\r\nAge, suddenly into _that_ life, so must I--_that_ youth there in the\r\nembrasure--have awakened then to the knowledge of _this_ far-back life\r\nof ours--seeming to him a vision of the very beginnings of eternity, in\r\nthe dawn of the world. Oh! I do but dread I make it not sufficient clear\r\nthat I and he were both _I_--the same soul. He of that far date seeing\r\nvaguely the life that _was_ (that I do now live in this present Age);\r\nand I of this time beholding the life that I yet shall live. How utterly\r\nstrange!\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I do not know that I speak holy truth to say that I, in that\r\nfuture time, had _no_ knowledge of _this_ life and Age, before that\r\nawakening; for I woke to find that I was one who stood apart from the\r\nother youths, in that I had a dim knowledge--visionary, as it were, of\r\nthe past, which confounded, whilst yet it angered, those who were the\r\nmen of learning of that age; though of this matter, more anon. But this\r\nI do know, that from that time, onwards, my knowledge and assuredness of\r\nthe Past was tenfold; for this my memory of that life told me.\r\n\r\nAnd so to further my telling. Yet before I pass onwards, one other thing\r\nis there of which I shall speak--In the moment in which I waked out of\r\nthat youthfulness, into the assured awaredness of _this_ our Age, in\r\nthat moment the hunger of this my love flew to me across the ages; so\r\nthat what had been but a memory-dream, grew to the pain of _Reality_,\r\nand I knew suddenly that I _lacked_; and from that time onwards, I went,\r\nlistening, as even now my life is spent.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that I (fresh-born in that future time) hungered strangely\r\nfor My Beautiful One with all the strength of that new life, knowing\r\nthat she had been mine, and might live again, even as I. And so, as I\r\nhave said, I hungered, and found that I listened.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to go back from my digression, it was, as I have said, I had\r\namazement at perceiving, in memory, the unknowable sunshine and\r\nsplendour of this age breaking so clear through my hitherto most vague\r\nand hazy visions; so that the ignorance of, Aesworpth was shouted to me\r\nby the things which now I _knew_.\r\n\r\nAnd from that time, onward, for a little space, I was stunned with all\r\nthat I knew and guessed and felt; and all of a long while the hunger\r\ngrew for that one I had lost in the early days--she who had sung to me\r\nin those faery days of light, that _had been_ in verity. And the\r\nespecial thoughts of that age looked back with a keen, regretful wonder\r\ninto the gulf of forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nBut, presently, I turned from the haze and pain of my dream-memories,\r\nonce more to the inconceivable mystery of the Night Land, which I viewed\r\nthrough the great embrasure. For on none did it ever come with weariness\r\nto look out upon all the hideous mysteries; so that old and young\r\nwatched, from early years to death, the black monstrosity of the Night\r\nLand, which this our last refuge of humanity held at bay.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the Red Pit there lay a long, sinuous glare, which I\r\nknew as the Vale of Red Fire, and beyond that for many dreary miles the\r\nblackness of the Night Land; across which came the coldness of the light\r\nfrom the Plain of Blue Fire.\r\n\r\nAnd then, on the very borders of the Unknown Lands, there lay a range of\r\nlow volcanoes, which lit up, far away in the outer darkness, the Black\r\nHills, where shone the Seven Lights, which neither twinkled nor moved\r\nnor faltered through Eternity; and of which even the great spy-glass\r\ncould make no understanding; nor had any adventurer from the Pyramid\r\never come back to tell us aught of them. And here let me say, that down\r\nin the Great Library of the Redoubt, were the histories of all those,\r\nwith their discoveries, who had ventured out into the monstrousness of\r\nthe Night Land, risking not the life only, but the spirit of life.\r\n\r\nAnd surely it is all so strange and wonderful to set out, that I could\r\nalmost despair with the contemplation of that which I must achieve; for\r\nthere is so much to tell, and so few words given to man by which he may\r\nmake clear that which lies beyond the sight and the present and general\r\nknowings of Peoples.\r\n\r\nHow shall you ever know, as I know in verity, of the greatness and\r\nreality and terror of the thing that I would tell plain to all; for we,\r\nwith our puny span of recorded life must have great histories to tell,\r\nbut the few bare details we know concerning years that are but a few\r\nthousands in all; and I must set out to you in the short pages of this\r\nmy life there, a sufficiency of the life that had been, and the life\r\nthat was, both within and without that mighty Pyramid, to make clear to\r\nthose who may read, the truth of that which I would tell; and the\r\nhistories of that great Redoubt dealt not with odd thousands of years;\r\nbut with very millions; aye, away back into what they of that Age\r\nconceived to be the early days of the earth, when the sun, maybe, still\r\ngloomed dully in the night sky of the world. But of all that went\r\nbefore, nothing, save as myths, and matters to be taken most cautiously,\r\nand believed not by men of sanity and proved wisdom.\r\n\r\nAnd I, ...how shall I make all this clear to you who may read? The thing\r\ncannot be; and yet I must tell my history; for to be silent before so\r\nmuch wonder would be to suffer of too full a heart; and I must even ease\r\nmy spirit by this my struggle to tell to all how it was with me, and how\r\nit will be. Aye, even to the memories which were the possession of that\r\nfar future youth, who was indeed I, of his childhood\'s days, when his\r\nnurse of that Age swung him, and crooned impossible lullabies of this\r\nmythical sun which, according to those future fairy-tales, had once\r\npassed across the blackness that now lay above the Pyramid.\r\n\r\nSuch is the monstrous futureness of this which I have seen through the\r\nbody of that far-off youth.\r\n\r\nAnd so back to my telling. To my right, which was to the North, there\r\nstood, very far away, the House of Silence, upon a low hill. And in that\r\nHouse were many lights, and no sound. And so had it been through an\r\nuncountable Eternity of Years. Always those steady lights, and no\r\nwhisper of sound--not even such as our distance-microphones could have\r\ndiscovered. And the danger of this House was accounted the greatest\r\ndanger of all those Lands.\r\n\r\nAnd round by the House of Silence, wound the Road Where The Silent Ones\r\nWalk. And concerning this Road, which passed out of the Unknown Lands,\r\nnigh by the Place of the Ab-humans, where was always the green, luminous\r\nmist, nothing was known; save that it was held that, of all the works\r\nabout the Mighty Pyramid, it was, alone, the one that was bred, long\r\nages past, of healthy human toil and labour. And on this point alone,\r\nhad a thousand books, and more, been writ; and all contrary, and so to\r\nno end, as is ever the way in such matters.\r\n\r\nAnd as it was with the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, so it was with\r\nall those other monstrous things ... whole libraries had there been made\r\nupon this and upon that; and many a thousand million mouldered into the\r\nforgotten dust of the earlier world.\r\n\r\nI mind me now that presently I stepped upon the central\r\ntravelling-roadway which spanned the one thousandth plateau of the Great\r\nRedoubt. And this lay six miles and thirty fathoms above the Plain of\r\nthe Night Land, and was somewhat of a great mile or more across. And so,\r\nin a few minutes, I was at the South-Eastern wall, and looking out\r\nthrough The Great Embrasure towards the Three Silver-fire Holes, that\r\nshone before the Thing That Nods, away down, far in the South-East.\r\nSouthward of this, but nearer, there rose the vast bulk of the\r\nSouth-East Watcher--The Watching Thing of the South-East. And to the\r\nright and to the left of the squat monster burned the Torches; maybe\r\nhalf-a-mile upon each side; yet sufficient light they threw to show the\r\nlumbered-forward head of the never-sleeping Brute.\r\n\r\nTo the East, as I stood there in the quietness of the Sleeping-Time on\r\nthe One Thousandth Plateau, I heard a far, dreadful sound, down in the\r\nlightless East; and, presently, again--a strange, dreadful laughter,\r\ndeep as a low thunder among the mountains. And because this sound came\r\nodd whiles from the Unknown Lands beyond the Valley of The Hounds, we\r\nhad named that far and never-seen Place "The Country Whence Comes The\r\nGreat Laughter." And though I had heard the sound, many and oft a time,\r\nyet did I never hear it without a most strange thrilling of my heart,\r\nand a sense of my littleness, and of the utter terror which had beset\r\nthe last millions of the world.\r\n\r\nYet, because I had heard the Laughter oft, I paid not over-long\r\nattention to my thoughts upon it; and when, in a little it died away\r\ninto that Eastern Darkness, I turned my spy-glass upon the Giants\' Pit,\r\nwhich lay to the South of the Giants\' Kilns. And these same Kilns were\r\ntended by the giants, and the light of the Kilns was red and fitful, and\r\nthrew wavering shadows and lights across the mouth of the pit; so that I\r\nsaw giants crawling up out of the pit; but not properly seen, by reason\r\nof the dance of the shadows. And so, because ever there was so much to\r\nbehold, I looked away, presently, to that which was plainer to be\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nTo the back of the Giants\' Pit was a great, black Headland, that stood\r\nvast, between the Valley of The Hounds (where lived the monstrous Night\r\nHounds) and the Giants. And the light of the Kilns struck the brow of\r\nthis black Headland; so that, constantly, I saw things peer over the\r\nedge, coming forward a little into the light of the Kilns, and drawing\r\nback swiftly into the shadows. And thus it had been ever, through the\r\nuncounted ages; so that the Headland was known as The Headland From\r\nWhich Strange Things Peer; and thus was it marked in our maps and charts\r\nof that grim world.\r\n\r\nAnd so I could go on ever; but that I fear to weary; and yet, whether I\r\ndo weary, or not, I must tell of this country that I see, even now as I\r\nset my thoughts down, so plainly that my memory wanders in a hushed and\r\nsecret fashion along its starkness, and amid its strange and dread\r\nhabitants, so that it is but by an effort I realise me that my body is\r\nnot there in this very moment that I write. And so to further tellings:\r\n\r\nBefore me ran the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk; and I searched it, as\r\nmany a time in my earlier youth had I, with the spy-glass; for my heart\r\nwas always stirred mightily by the sight of those Silent Ones.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, alone in all the miles of that night-grey road, I saw\r\none in the field of my glass--a quiet, cloaked figure, moving along,\r\nshrouded, and looking neither to right nor left. And thus was it with\r\nthese beings ever. It was told about in the Redoubt that they would harm\r\nno human, if but the human did keep a fair distance from them; but that\r\nit were wise never to come close upon one. And this I can well believe.\r\n\r\nAnd so, searching the road with my gaze, I passed beyond this Silent\r\nOne, and past the place where the road, sweeping vastly to the\r\nSouth-East, was lit a space, strangely, by the light from the\r\nSilver-fire Holes. And thus at last to where it swayed to the South of\r\nthe Dark Palace, and thence Southward still, until it passed round to\r\nthe Westward, beyond the mountain bulk of the Watching Thing in the\r\nSouth--the hugest monster in all the visible Night Lands. My spy-glass\r\nshowed it to me with clearness--a living hill of watchfulness, known to\r\nus as The Watcher Of The South. It brooded there, squat and tremendous,\r\nhunched over the pale radiance of the Glowing Dome.\r\n\r\nMuch, I know, had been writ concerning this Odd, Vast Watcher; for it\r\nhad grown out of the blackness of the South Unknown Lands a million\r\nyears gone; and the steady growing nearness of it had been noted and set\r\nout at length by the men they called Monstruwacans; so that it was\r\npossible to search in our libraries, and learn of the very coming of\r\nthis Beast in the olden-time.\r\n\r\nAnd, while I mind me, there were even then, and always, men named\r\nMonstruwacans, whose duty it was to take heed of the great Forces, and\r\nto watch the Monsters and the Beasts that beset the great Pyramid, and\r\nmeasure and record, and have so full a knowledge of these same that, did\r\none but sway an head in the darkness, the same matter was set down with\r\nparticularness in the Records.\r\n\r\nAnd, so to tell more about the South Watcher. A million years gone, as I\r\nhave told, came it out from the blackness of the South, and grew\r\nsteadily nearer through twenty thousand years; but so slow that in no\r\none year could a man perceive that it had moved.\r\n\r\nYet it had movement, and had come thus far upon its road to the Redoubt,\r\nwhen the Glowing Dome rose out of the ground before it--growing slowly.\r\nAnd this had stayed the way of the Monster; so that through an eternity\r\nit had looked towards the Pyramid across the pale glare of the Dome, and\r\nseeming to have no power to advance nearer.\r\n\r\nAnd because of this, much had been writ to prove that there were other\r\nforces than evil at work in the Night Lands, about the Last Redoubt. And\r\nthis I have always thought to be wisely said; and, indeed, there to be\r\nno doubt to the matter, for there were many things in the time of which\r\nI have knowledge, which seemed to make clear that, even as the Forces of\r\nDarkness were loose upon the End of Man; so were there other Forces out\r\nto do battle with the Terror; though in ways most strange and unthought\r\nof by the human mind. And of this I shall have more to tell anon.\r\n\r\nAnd here, before I go further with my telling, let me set out some of\r\nthat knowledge which yet remains so clear within my mind and heart. Of\r\nthe coming of these monstrosities and evil Forces, no man could say much\r\nwith verity; for the evil of it began before the Histories of the Great\r\nRedoubt were shaped; aye, even before the sun had lost all power to\r\nlight; though, it must not be a thing of certainty, that even at this\r\nfar time the invisible, black heavens held no warmth for this world; but\r\nof this I have no room to tell; and must pass on to that of which I have\r\na more certain knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe evil must surely have begun in the Days of the Darkening (which I\r\nmight liken to a story which was believed doubtfully, much as we of this\r\nday believe the story of the Creation). A dim record there was of olden\r\nsciences (that are yet far off in our future) which, disturbing the\r\nunmeasurable Outward Powers, had allowed to pass the Barrier of Life\r\nsome of those Monsters and Ab-human creatures, which are so wondrously\r\ncushioned from us at this normal present. And thus there had\r\nmaterialized, and in other cases developed, grotesque and horrible\r\nCreatures, which now beset the humans of this world. And where there was\r\nno power to take on material form, there had been allowed to certain\r\ndreadful Forces to have power to affect the life of the human spirit.\r\nAnd this growing very dreadful, and the world full of lawlessness and\r\ndegeneracy, there had banded together the sound millions, and built the\r\nLast Redoubt; there in the twilight of the world--so it seems to us, and\r\nyet to them (bred at last to the peace of usage) as it were the\r\nBeginning; and this I can make no clearer; and none hath right to expect\r\nit; for my task is very great, and beyond the power of human skill.\r\n\r\nAnd when the humans had built the great Pyramid, it had one thousand\r\nthree hundred and twenty floors; and the thickness of each floor was\r\naccording to the strength of its need. And the whole height of this\r\npyramid exceeded seven miles, by near a mile, and above it was a tower\r\nfrom which the Watchmen looked (these being called the Monstruwacans).\r\nBut where the Redoubt was built, I know not; save that I believe in a\r\nmighty valley, of which I may tell more in due time.\r\n\r\nAnd when the Pyramid was built, the last millions, who were the Builders\r\nthereof, went within, and made themselves a great house and city of this\r\nLast Redoubt. And thus began the Second History of this world. And how\r\nshall I set it all down in these little pages! For my task, even as I\r\nsee it, is too great for the power of a single life and a single pen.\r\nYet, to it!\r\n\r\nAnd, later, through hundreds and thousands of years, there grew up in\r\nthe Outer Lands, beyond those which lay under the guard of the Redoubt,\r\nmighty and lost races of terrible creatures, half men and half beast,\r\nand evil and dreadful; and these made war upon the Redoubt; but were\r\nbeaten off from that grim, metal mountain, with a vast slaughter. Yet,\r\nmust there have been many such attacks, until the electric circle was\r\nput about the Pyramid, and lit from the Earth-Current. And the lowest\r\nhalf-mile of the Pyramid was sealed; and so at last there was a peace,\r\nand the beginnings of that Eternity of quiet watching for the day when\r\nthe Earth-Current shall become exhausted.\r\n\r\nAnd, at whiles, through the forgotten centuries, had the Creatures been\r\nglutted time and again upon such odd bands of daring ones as had\r\nadventured forth to explore through the mystery of the Night Lands; for\r\nof those who went, scarce any did ever return; for there were eyes in\r\nall that dark; and Powers and Forces abroad which had all knowledge; or\r\nso we must fain believe.\r\n\r\nAnd then, so it would seem, as that Eternal Night lengthened itself upon\r\nthe world, the power of terror grew and strengthened. And fresh and\r\ngreater monsters developed and bred out of all space and Outward\r\nDimensions, attracted, even as it might be Infernal sharks, by that\r\nlonely and mighty hill of humanity, facing its end--so near to the\r\nEternal, and yet so far deferred in the minds and to the senses of those\r\nhumans. And thus hath it been ever.\r\n\r\nAnd all this but by the way, and vague and ill told, and set out in\r\ndespair to make a little clear the beginnings of that State which is so\r\nstrange to our conceptions, and yet which had become a Condition of\r\nNaturalness to Humanity in that stupendous future.\r\n\r\nThus had the giants come, fathered of bestial humans and mothered of\r\nmonsters. And many and diverse were the creatures which had some human\r\nsemblance; and intelligence, mechanical and cunning; so that certain of\r\nthese lesser Brutes had machinery and underground ways, having need to\r\nsecure to themselves warmth and air, even as healthy humans; only that\r\nthey were incredibly inured to hardship, as they might be wolves set in\r\ncomparison with tender children. And surely, do I make this thing clear?\r\n\r\nAnd now to continue my telling concerning the Night Land. The Watcher of\r\nthe South was, as I have set to make known, a monster differing from\r\nthose other Watching Things, of which I have spoken, and of which there\r\nwere in all four. One to the North-West, and one to the South-East, and\r\nof these I have told; and the other twain lay brooding, one to the\r\nSouth-West, and the other to the North-East; and thus the four watchers\r\nkept ward through the darkness, upon the Pyramid, and moved not, neither\r\ngave they out any sound. Yet did we know them to be mountains of living\r\nwatchfulness and hideous and steadfast intelligence.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in a while, having listened to the sorrowful sound which came\r\never to us over the Grey Dunes, from the Country of Wailing, which lay\r\nto the South, midway between the Redoubt and the Watcher of the South, I\r\npassed upon one of the moving roadways over to the South-Western side of\r\nthe Pyramid, and looked from a narrow embrasure thence far down into the\r\nDeep Valley, which was four miles deep, and in which was the Pit of the\r\nRed Smoke.\r\n\r\nAnd the mouth of this Pit was one full mile across, and the smoke of the\r\nPit filled the Valley at times, so that it seemed but as a glowing red\r\ncircle amid dull thunderous clouds of redness. Yet the red smoke rose\r\nnever much above the Valley; so that there was clear sight across to the\r\ncountry beyond. And there, along the further edge of that great depth,\r\nwere the Towers, each, maybe, a mile high, grey and quiet; but with a\r\nshimmer upon them.\r\n\r\nBeyond these, South and West of them, was the enormous bulk of the\r\nSouth-West Watcher, and from the ground rose what we named the Eye\r\nBeam--a single ray of grey light, which came up out of the ground, and\r\nlit the right eye of the monster. And because of this light, that eye\r\nhad been mightily examined through unknown thousands of years; and some\r\nheld that the eye looked through the light steadfastly at the Pyramid;\r\nbut others set out that the light blinded it, and was the work of those\r\nOther Powers which were abroad to do combat with the Evil Forces. But\r\nhowever this may be, as I stood there in the embrasure, and looked at\r\nthe thing through the spy-glass, it seemed to my soul that the Brute\r\nlooked straightly at me, unwinking and steadfast, and fully of a\r\nknowledge that I spied upon it. And this is how I felt.\r\n\r\nTo the North of this, in the direction of the West, I saw The Place\r\nWhere The Silent Ones Kill; and this was so named, because there, maybe\r\nten thousand years gone, certain humans adventuring from the Pyramid,\r\ncame off the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, and into that place, and\r\nwere immediately destroyed. And this was told by one who escaped; though\r\nhe died also very quickly, for his heart was frozen. And this I cannot\r\nexplain; but so it was set out in the Records.\r\n\r\nFar away beyond The Place Where The Silent Ones Kill, in the very mouth\r\nof the Western Night was the Place of the Ab-humans, where was lost the\r\nRoad Where The Silent Ones Walk, in a dull green, luminous mist. And of\r\nthis place nothing was known; though much it held the thoughts and\r\nattentions of our thinkers and imaginers; for some said that there was a\r\nPlace Of Safety, differing from the Redoubt (as we of this day suppose\r\nHeaven to differ from the Earth), and that the Road led thence; but was\r\nbarred by the Ab-humans. And this I can only set down here; but with no\r\nthought to justify or uphold it.\r\n\r\nLater, I travelled over to the North-Eastern wall of the Redoubt, and\r\nlooked thence with my spy-glass at the Watcher of the North-East--the\r\nCrowned Watcher it was called, in that within the air above its vast\r\nhead there hung always a blue, luminous ring, which shed a strange light\r\ndownwards over the monster--showing a vast, wrinkled brow (upon which an\r\nwhole library had been writ); but putting to the shadow all the lower\r\nface; all save the ear, which came out from the back of the head, and\r\nbelled towards the Redoubt, and had been said by some observers in the\r\npast to have been seen to quiver; but how that might be, I knew not; for\r\nno man of our days had seen such a thing.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond the Watching Thing was The Place Where The Silent Ones Are\r\nNever, close by the great road; which was bounded upon the far side by\r\nThe Giant\'s Sea; and upon the far side of that, was a Road which was\r\nalways named The Road By The Quiet City; for it passed along that place\r\nwhere burned forever the constant and never-moving lights of a strange\r\ncity; but no glass had ever shown life there; neither had any light ever\r\nceased to burn.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond that again was the Black Mist. And here, let me say, that the\r\nValley of The Hounds ended towards the Lights of the Quiet City.\r\n\r\nAnd so have I set out something of that land, and of those creatures and\r\ncircumstances which beset us about, waiting until the Day of Doom, when\r\nour Earth-Current should cease, and leave us helpless to the Watchers\r\nand the Abundant Terror.\r\n\r\nAnd there I stood, and looked forth composedly, as may one who has been\r\nborn to know of such matters, and reared in the knowledge of them. And,\r\nanon, I would look upward, and see the grey, metalled mountain going up\r\nmeasureless into the gloom of the everlasting night; and from my feet\r\nthe sheer downward sweep of the grim, metal walls, six full miles, and\r\nmore, to the plain below.\r\n\r\nAnd one thing (aye! and I fear me, many) have I missed to set out with\r\nparticularness:\r\n\r\nThere was, as you do know, all around the base of the Pyramid, which was\r\nfive and one-quarter miles every way, a great circle of light, which was\r\nset up by the Earth-Current, and burned within a transparent tube; or\r\nhad that appearance. And it bounded the Pyramid for a clear mile upon\r\nevery side, and burned for ever; and none of the monsters had power ever\r\nto pass across, because of what we did call The Air Clog that it did\r\nmake, as an invisible Wall of Safety. And it did give out also a more\r\nsubtile vibration, that did affect the weak Brain-Elements of the\r\nmonsters and the Lower Men-Brutes. And some did hold that there went\r\nfrom it a further vibration of a greater subtileness that gave a\r\nprotecting against the Evil Forces. And some quality it had truly\r\nthiswise; for the Evil Powers had no ability to cause harm to any\r\nwithin. Yet were there some dangers against which it might not avail;\r\nbut these had no cunning to bring harm to any _within_ the Great Redoubt\r\nwho had wisdom to meddle with no dreadfulness. And so were those last\r\nmillions guarded until the Earth-Current should be used to its end. And\r\nthis circle is that which I have called the Electric Circle; though with\r\nfailure to explain. But there it was called only, The Circle.\r\n\r\nAnd thus have I, with great effort, made a little clear that grim land\r\nof night, where, presently, my listening heard one calling across the\r\ndark. And how that this grew upon me, I will set out forthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE QUIET CALLING\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, oft had I heard tell, not only in that great city which occupied\r\nthe thousandth floor, but in others of the one thousand, three hundred\r\nand twenty cities of the Pyramid, that there was somewhere out in the\r\ndesolation of the Night Lands a second Place of Refuge, where had\r\ngathered, in another part of this dead world, some last millions of the\r\nhuman race, to fight unto the end.\r\n\r\nAnd this story I heard everywhere in my travels through the cities of\r\nthe Great Redoubt, which travels began when I came upon my seventeenth\r\nyear, and continued for three years and two hundred and twenty five\r\ndays, being even then but one day in each city, as was the custom in the\r\ntraining of every child.\r\n\r\nAnd truly it was a great journey, and in it I met with many, whom to\r\nknow was to love; but whom never could I see again; for life has not\r\nspace enough; and each must to his duty to the security and well-being\r\nof the Redoubt. Yet, for all that I have set down, we travelled much,\r\nalways; but there were so many millions, and so few years.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I have said, everywhere I went there was the same story of this\r\nother Place of Refuge; and in such of the Libraries of those cities as I\r\nhad time to search, there were great numbers of works upon the existence\r\nof this other Refuge; and some, far back in the years, made assertion\r\nwith confidence that such a Place was in verity; and, indeed, no doubt\r\ndid there seem in those by-gone ages; but now these very Records were\r\nread only by Scholars, who doubted, even whilst they read. And so is it\r\never.\r\n\r\nBut of the reality of this Refuge, I had never a sound doubt, from the\r\nday of my hearing concerning it from our Master Monstruwacan, who with\r\nall his assistants occupied the Tower of Observation in the apex of the\r\nPyramid. And here let me tell that he and I had always an affinity and\r\nclose friendship one for the other; though he was full grown, and I but\r\na youth; yet so it was; and thus, when I had come to an age of\r\ntwenty-one years of life, he opened to me a post within the Tower of\r\nObservation; and this was a most wondrous good fortune to me; for in all\r\nthe vast Redoubt, to be appointed to the Tower of Observation was the\r\nmost desired; for thereby, even as in these days doth Astronomy, was the\r\nnatural curiosity of Man eased somewhat, even while thwarted.\r\n\r\nNow, let me tell here also, lest it be thought that I was unduly\r\nfavoured because of my friendship with the Master Monstruwacan, that\r\nthere was a sound justification for his choice, in that to me had been\r\ngiven that strange gift of hearing, which we called Night-Hearing;\r\nthough this was but a fanciful name, and meant little. Yet the peculiar\r\ngift was rare, and in all the millions of the Pyramid, there was none\r\nwith the gift to a great degree, saving only myself.\r\n\r\nAnd I, because of this gift, could hear the "invisible vibrations" of\r\nthe aether; so that, without harking to the calling of our recording\r\ninstruments, I could take the messages which came continually through\r\nthe eternal darkness; aye, even better than they. And now, it may be the\r\nbetter understood, how much was to be counted that I had grown to listen\r\nfor a voice that had not rung in mine ears for an eternity, and yet\r\nwhich sang sweet and clear in my memory-dreams; so that it seemed to me\r\nthat Mirdath the Beautiful slept within my soul, and whispered to me out\r\nof all the ages.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one day, at the fifteenth hour, when began the Sleep-Time, I\r\nhad been pondering this love of mine that lived with me still; and\r\nmarvelling that my memory-dreams held the voice of a love that _had\r\nbeen_ in so remote an age. And pondering and dreaming thus, as a young\r\nman may, I could fancy this aeon-lost One were whispering beauty into\r\nmy ears, in verity; so clear had my memory grown, and so much had I\r\npondered.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as I stood there, harking and communing with my thoughts, I\r\nthrilled suddenly, as if I had been smitten; for out of all the\r\neverlasting night a whisper was thrilling and thrilling upon my more\r\nsubtile hearing.\r\n\r\nThrough four long years had I listened, since that awakening in the\r\nembrasure, when but a youth of seventeen; and now out of the\r\nworld-darkness and all the eternal years of that lost life, which now I\r\nlive in this Present Age of ours, was the whisper come; for I knew it\r\nupon that instant; and yet, because I was so taught to wisdom, I\r\nanswered by no name; but sent the Master-Word through the night--sending\r\nit with my brain-elements, as I could, and as all may, much or little,\r\nas may be, if they be not clods. And, moreover, I knew that she who\r\ncalled quietly would have the power to hear without instruments, if\r\nindeed it were she; and if it were but one of the false callings of the\r\nEvil Forces, or more cunning monsters, or as was sometimes thought\r\nconcerning these callings, the House of Silence, meddling with our\r\nsouls, then would they have no power to say the Master-Word; for this\r\nhad been proven through all the Everlasting.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as I stood, trembling and striving not to be tense, which\r\ndestroys the receptivity, there came thrilling round and round my\r\nspiritual essence the throb of the Master-Word, beating steadily in the\r\nnight, as doth that marvellous sound. And then, with all that was sweet\r\nin my spirit, I called with my brain elements: "Mirdath! Mirdath!\r\nMirdath!" And at that instant the Master Monstruwacan entered that part\r\nof the Tower of Observation, where I stood; and, seeing my face, stood\r\nvery quiet; for though he had not the power of Night-Hearing, he was\r\nwise and thoughtful, and took much account of my gift; more-over, he had\r\nbut come from the Receiving Instrument, and thought vaguely to have\r\ncaught the throb of the Master-Word, though too faint to come proper\r\nthrough the Instrument, so that he searched for me, in that I, who had\r\nthe Hearing, might listen for it, I being, as I have said, gifted in\r\nthat wise.\r\n\r\nAnd to him I told something of my story and my thoughts and my memories,\r\nand of that awakening; and thus up to this present happening, and he\r\nhearkened with sympathy and a troubled and wondering heart; for in that\r\nage a man might talk sanely upon that which, in this age of ours would\r\nbe accounted foolishness and maybe the breathings of insanity; for\r\nthere, by the refinement of arts of mentality and the results of strange\r\nexperiments and the accomplishment of learning, men were abled to\r\nconceive of matters now closed to our conceptions, even as we of this\r\nday may haply give a calm ear to talk, that in the days of our fathers\r\nwould have been surely set to the count of lunacy. And this is very\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while that I told my story, I listened with my spirit; but\r\nsave for a sense of faint, happy laughter that wrapped about me, I heard\r\nnaught. And nothing more all that day.\r\n\r\nHere let me put down that, because of my memories and half memories, I\r\nwould time and again dispute with our learned men; they being in doubt\r\nas to the verity of that olden story of the Days of Light, and the\r\nexistence of the Sun; though something of all this was set out, as of\r\n_truth_, in our oldest records; but I, remembering, told them many tales\r\nthat seemed fairy-like to them, and entranced their hearts, even whilst\r\nI angered their brains, which refused to take seriously and as verity\r\nthat which their hearts accepted gladly, even as we receive the wonder\r\nof poetry into our souls. But the Master Monstruwacan would listen to\r\naught I had to tell; aye! though I spoke through hours; and so it would\r\nbe, odd times, that having talked long, drawing my stories from my\r\nMemory-Dreams, I would come back again into the present of that Future;\r\nand lo! all the Monstruwacans would have left their instruments and\r\nobservations and recording, and be gathered about me; and the Master so\r\nsunken in interest that he not to have discovered them; neither had I\r\nnoticed, being so full of the things which had been.\r\n\r\nBut when the Master came back to knowledge of that present, he would\r\nrouse and chide, and they, all those lesser ones, would fly swiftly and\r\nguiltily to their various works; and yet, so I have thought since, each\r\nwith a muddled and bewildered and thoughtful air upon him; and hungry\r\nthey were for more, and ever wondering and setting questions about.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was also with those others--those learned ones who were not of\r\nthe Tower of Observation, and who disbelieved even whilst they hungered.\r\nListen would they, though I talked from the first hour, which was the\r\n"dawn," to the fifteenth hour, which was the beginning of the "night";\r\nfor the Sleep-Time was set thus, after other usage and experiment. And,\r\nodd whiles, I found that there were among them, men of extraordinary\r\nlearning who upheld my tellings as tales of verity; and so there was a\r\nfaction; but, later, there grew more to believe; and whether they\r\nbelieved, or not, all were ready to listen; so that I might have spended\r\nmy days in talk; only that I had my work to do.\r\n\r\nBut the Master Monstruwacan believed from the beginning, and was wise\r\nalways to understand; so that I loved him for this, as for many another\r\ndear quality.\r\n\r\nAnd so, as may be conceived, among all those millions I was singled out\r\nto be known; for the stories that I told went downward through a\r\nthousand cities; and, presently, in the lowest tier of the Underground\r\nFields, an hundred miles deep in the earth below the Redoubt, I found\r\nthat the very ploughboys knew something concerning my tellings; and\r\ngathered about me one time and another when the Master Monstruwacan and\r\nI had gone down, regarding some matter that dealt with the Earth-Current\r\nand our Instruments.\r\n\r\nAnd of the Underground Fields (though in that age we called them no more\r\nthan "The Fields") I should set down a little; for they were the\r\nmightiest work of this world; so that even the Last Redoubt was but a\r\nsmall thing beside them. An hundred miles deep lay the lowest of the\r\nUnderground Fields, and was an hundred miles from side to side, every\r\nway; and above it there were three hundred and six fields, each one less\r\nin area than that beneath; and in this wise they tapered, until the\r\ntopmost field which lay direct beneath the lowermost floor of the Great\r\nRedoubt, was but four miles every way.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it will be seen that these fields, lying one beneath the other,\r\nformed a mighty and incredible Pyramid of Country Lands in the deep\r\nearth, an hundred miles from the base unto the topmost field.\r\n\r\nAnd the whole was sheathed-in at the sides with the grey metal of which\r\nthe Redoubt was builded; and each field was pillared, and floored\r\nbeneath the soil, with this same compound of wonder; and so was it\r\nsecure, and the monsters could not dig into that mighty garden from\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nAnd all of that Underground Land was lit, where needed, by the\r\nEarth-Current, and that same life-stream fructified the soil, and gave\r\nlife and blood to the plants and to the trees, and to every bush and\r\nnatural thing.\r\n\r\nAnd the making of those Fields had taken maybe a million years, and the\r\n"dump" thereof had been cast into the "Crack," whence came the\r\nEarth-Current, and which had bottom beyond all soundings. And this\r\nUnderground Country had its own winds and air-currents; so that, to my\r\nmemory, it was in no ways connected to the monstrous air-shafts of the\r\nPyramid; but in this I may be mistaken; for it has not been given to me\r\nto know all that is to be known concerning that vast Redoubt; nor by any\r\none man could so much knowledge be achieved.\r\n\r\nYet that there were wise and justly promoted winds in that Underground\r\nCountry, I do know; for healthful and sweet they were, and in the\r\ncorn-fields there was the sweet rustle of grain, and the glad, silken\r\nlaughter of poppies, all beneath a warm and happy light. And here, did\r\nthe millions walk and take excursion, and go orderly or not, even as in\r\nthese days.\r\n\r\nAnd all this have I seen, and the talk of a thousand lovers in the\r\ngardens of that place, comes back to me; and with it all the memory of\r\nmy dear one; and of a faint calling that would seem to whisper about me\r\nat times; but so faint and attenuated, that even I, who had the\r\nNight-Hearing, could not catch its import; and so went, listening ever\r\nthe more intently. And oft times calling.\r\n\r\nNow there was a Law in the Pyramid, tried and healthful, which held that\r\nno male should have freedom to adventure into the Night Land, before the\r\nage of twenty-two; _and no female ever_. Yet that, after such age, if a\r\nyouth desired greatly to make the adventure, he should receive three\r\nlectures upon the dangers of which we had knowledge, and a strict\r\naccount of the mutilatings and horrid deeds done to those who had so\r\nadventured. And if, after this had passed over him, he still desired,\r\nand if he were accounted healthful and sane; then should he be allowed\r\nto make the adventure; and it was accounted honour to the youth who\r\nshould add to the knowledge of the Pyramid.\r\n\r\nBut to all such as went forth into the danger of the Night Land, there\r\nwas set beneath the skin of the inner side of the left forearm, a small\r\ncapsule, and when the wound had healed, then might the youth make the\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nAnd the wherefore of this, was that the spirit of the youth might be\r\nsaved, if he were entrapped; for then, upon the honour of his soul, must\r\nhe bite forth the capsule, and immediately his spirit would have safety\r\nin death. And by this shall you know somewhat the grim and horrid danger\r\nof the Dark Land.\r\n\r\nAnd this I have set down because later I was to make huge adventure into\r\nthose Lands; and even at this time, some thought of the same had come to\r\nme; for always I went listening for that quiet calling; and twice I sent\r\nthe Master-Word throbbing solemnly through the everlasting night; yet\r\nthis I did no more, without certainty; for the Word must not be used\r\nlightly. But often would I say with my brain-elements "Mirdath!\r\nMirdath!"--sending the name out into the darkness; and sometimes would I\r\nseem to hear the faint thrilling of the aether around me; as though one\r\nanswered; but weakly, as it were with a weakened spirit, or by\r\ninstrument that lacked of its earth-force.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, for a great while there was no certainty; but only a strange\r\nanxiousness and no clear answer.\r\n\r\nThen, one day as I stood by the instruments in the Tower of Observation,\r\nat the thirteenth hour there came the thrilling of beaten aether all\r\nabout me, as it were that all the void was disturbed. And I made the\r\nSign for Silence; so that the men moved not in all the Tower; but bowed\r\nover their breathing-bells, that all disturbance might cease.\r\n\r\nAnd again came the gentle thrilling, and broke out into a clear, low\r\ncalling in my brain; and the calling was my name--the old-earth name of\r\nthis day, and not the name of that age. And the name smote me, with a\r\nfrightenedness of fresh awakening memories. And, immediately, I sent the\r\nMaster-Word into the night; and all the aether was full of movement. And\r\na silence came; and later a beat afar off in the void of night, which\r\nonly I in all that great Redoubt could hear, until the heavier\r\nvibrations were come. And in a moment there was all about me the\r\nthrobbing of the Master-Word, beating in the night a sure answer. Yet,\r\nbefore this I knew that Mirdath had called; but now had surety.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately, I said "Mirdath," making use of the instruments; and\r\nthere came a swift and beautiful answer; for out of the dark there stole\r\nan old love-name, that she only had ever used to me.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, I minded me of the men, and signed to them that they\r\nshould continue; for the Records must not be broken; and now I had the\r\ncommunication full established.\r\n\r\nAnd by me stood the Master Monstruwacan, quietly as any young\r\nMonstruwacan, waiting with slips to make any notes that were needful;\r\nand keeping a strict eye upon those others; but not unkindly. And so,\r\nfor a space of wonder, I had speech with that girl out in the darkness\r\nof the world, who had knowledge of my name, and of the old-earth\r\nlove-name, and named herself Mirdath.\r\n\r\nAnd much I questioned her, and presently to my sorrow; for it seemed\r\nthat her name was not truly Mirdath; but Naani; neither had she known my\r\nname; but that in the library of that place where she abode, there had\r\nbeen a story of one named by my name, and called by that sweet love-name\r\nwhich she had sent out somewhat ruthless into the night; and the girl\'s\r\nname had been Mirdath; and when first she, Naani had called, there had\r\ncome back to her a cry of Mirdath, Mirdath; and this had minded her so\r\nstrangely of that olden story which had stayed in her memory; that she\r\nhad answered as the maid in that book might have answered.\r\n\r\nAnd thus did it seem that the utter Romance of my Memory-love had\r\nvanished, and I stood strangely troubled for sorrow of a love of olden\r\ntimes. Yet, even then I marvelled that any book should have story so\r\nmuch like to mine; not heeding that the history of all love is writ with\r\none pen.\r\n\r\nYet, even then in that hour of my strange, and quaintly foolish pain,\r\nthere came a thing that set me thrilling; though more afterwards, when I\r\ncame to think afresh upon it. For the girl who spoke to me through the\r\nnight made some wonder that my voice were not deeper; yet in quiet\r\nfashion, and as one who says a thing, scarce wotting what they say. But\r\neven to me then, there came a sudden hope; for in the olden days of this\r\nPresent Age my voice had been very deep. And I said to her that maybe\r\nthe man in the book was said to have had a deep tone of speech; but she,\r\nseeming puzzled, said nay; and at that I questioned her the more; but\r\nonly to the trouble of her memory and understanding.\r\n\r\nAnd strange must it seem that we two should talk on so trivial a matter,\r\nwhen there was so much else that we had need to exchange thought upon;\r\nfor were a man in this present day to have speech with those who may\r\nlive within that red planet of Mars within the sky, scarce could the\r\nwonder of it exceed the wonder of a human voice coming through that\r\nnight unto the Great Redoubt, out of all that lost darkness. For,\r\nindeed, this must have been the breaking of, maybe, a million years of\r\nsilence. And already, as I came to know later, was the news passing\r\ndownward from City to City through all the vast Pyramid; so that the\r\nHour-Slips were full of the news; and every City eager and excited, and\r\nwaiting. And I better known in that one moment, than in all my life\r\nbefore. For that previous calling, had been but vaguely put about; and\r\nthen set to the count of a nature, blown upon over-easily by\r\nspirit-winds of the half-memory of dreams. Though it is indeed true, as\r\nI have set down before this, that my tales concerning the early days of\r\nthe world, when the sun was visible, and full of light, had gone down\r\nthrough all the cities, and had much comment and setting forth in the\r\nHour-Slips, and were a cause for speech and argument.\r\n\r\nNow concerning the voice of this girl coming to us through the darkness\r\nof the world, I will set out that which she had to tell; and this,\r\nindeed, but verified the tellings of our most ancient Records, which had\r\nso long been treated over lightly: There was, it would seem, somewhere\r\nout in the lonesome dark of the Outer Lands, but at what distance none\r\ncould ever discover, a second Redoubt; that was a three-sided Pyramid,\r\nand moderate small; being no more than a mile in height, and scarce\r\nthree quarters of a mile along the bases.\r\n\r\nWhen this Redoubt was first builded, it had been upon the far shore of a\r\nsea, where now was no sea; and it had been raised by those wandering\r\nhumans who had grown weary of wandering, and weary of the danger of\r\nnight attacks by the tribes of half-human monsters which began to\r\ninhabit the earth even so early as the days when the half-gloom was upon\r\nthe world. And he that had made the plan upon which it was builded, was\r\none who had seen the Great Redoubt, having lived there in the beginning,\r\nbut escaped because of a correction set upon him for his spirit of\r\nirresponsibility, which had made him to cause disturbance among the\r\norderly ones in the lowest city of the Great Redoubt.\r\n\r\nYet, in time, he too had come to be tamed by the weight of fear of the\r\never-growing hordes of monsters, and the Forces that were abroad. And so\r\nhe, being a master-spirit, planned and builded the smaller Redoubt,\r\nbeing aided thereto by four millions, who also were weary of the harass\r\nof the monsters; but until then had been wanderers, because of the\r\nrestlessness of their blood.\r\n\r\nAnd they had chosen that place, because there they had discovered a sign\r\nof the Earth-Current in a great valley which led to the shore; for\r\nwithout the Earth-Current no Refuge could have existence. And whilst\r\nmany builded and guarded, and cared for the Great Camp in which all\r\nlived, others worked within a great shaft; and in ten years had made\r\nthis to a distance of many miles, and therewith they tapt the\r\nEarth-Current; but not a great stream; yet a sufficiency, as was\r\nbelieved.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, after many years, they had builded the Pyramid, and\r\ntaken up their refuge there, and made them instruments, and ordained\r\nMonstruwacans; so that they had speech daily with the Great Pyramid; and\r\nthus for many long ages.\r\n\r\nAnd the Earth-Current then to begin to fail; and though they laboured\r\nthrough many thousands of years, they came to no better resource. And so\r\nit was they ceased to have communication with the Great Redoubt; for the\r\ncurrent had a lack of power to work the instruments; and the recording\r\ninstruments ceased to be sensible of our messages.\r\n\r\nAnd thereafter came a million years, maybe, of silence; with ever the\r\nbirthing and marrying and dying of those lonesome humans. And they grew\r\nless; and some put this to the lack of the Earth-Current, which dwindled\r\nslowly through the centuries of that Eternity.\r\n\r\nAnd once in a thousand years, maybe, one among them would be Sensitive,\r\nand abled to hear beyond ordinary; and to these, at times, there would\r\nseem to come the thrilling of the aether; so that such an one would go\r\nlistening; and sometimes seem to catch half messages; and so awaken a\r\ngreat interest in all the Pyramid; and there would be turning up of old\r\nRecords, and many words and writings, and attempts to send the\r\nMaster-Word through the night; in which, doubtless sometimes they\r\nsucceeded; for there was set down in the Records of the Great Redoubt\r\ncertain occasions on which there had come the call of the Master-Word,\r\nwhich had been arranged and made holy between the two Redoubts in the\r\nearly days of that second life of this world.\r\n\r\nYet, now for an hundred thousand years, there had been none Sensitive;\r\nand in that time the people of the Pyramid had become no more than ten\r\nthousand; and the Earth-Current was weak and powerless to put the joy of\r\nlife into them; so that they went listlessly, but deemed it not strange,\r\nbecause of so many aeons of usage.\r\n\r\nAnd then, to the wonder of all, the Earth-Current had put forth a new\r\npower; so that young people ceased to be old over-soon; and there was\r\nhappiness and a certain joy in the living; and a strange birthing of\r\nchildren, such as had not been through half a million years.\r\n\r\nAnd then came a new thing. Naani, the daughter of the Master\r\nMonstruwacan of that Redoubt had shown to all that she was Sensitive;\r\nfor she had perceived odd vibrations afloat in the night; and concerning\r\nthese she told her father; and presently, because their blood moved\r\nafresh in their bodies, they had heart to discover the plans of the\r\nancient instruments; for the instruments had long rusted, and been\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nAnd so they builded them a new instrument to send forth a message; for\r\nthey had no memory at that time that the brain-elements had power to do\r\nthus; though, mayhap, their brain-elements were weakened, through so\r\nmany ages of starvation of the Earth-Current, and could not have obeyed,\r\neven had their masters known all that we of the Great Redoubt knew.\r\n\r\nAnd when the instrument was finished, to Naani was given the right to\r\ncall first across the dark to discover whether indeed, after that\r\nmillion years of silence, they were yet companied upon this earth, or\r\nwhether they were in truth lonely--the last poor thousands of the\r\nHumans.\r\n\r\nAnd a great and painful excitement came upon the people of the lesser\r\npyramid; for the loneliness of the world pressed upon them; and it was\r\nto them as though we in this age called to a star across the abyss of\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nAnd because of the excitement and pain of the moment, Naani called only\r\nvaguely with the instrument into the dark; and lo! in a moment, as it\r\nseemed, there came all about her in the night the solemn throb of the\r\nMaster-Word, beating in the night. And Naani cried out that she was\r\nanswered, and, as may be thought, many of the people wept, and some\r\nprayed, and some were silent; but others beseeched her that she call\r\nagain and quickly to have further speech with those of their kind.\r\n\r\nAnd Naani spoke the Master-Word into the night, and directly there came\r\na calling all about her: "Mirdath! Mirdath!" and the strange wonder of\r\nit made her silent a moment; but when she would have made reply, the\r\ninstrument had ceased to work, and she could have no further speech at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nThis, as may be thought, occasioned much distress; and constant work\r\nthey had between the instrument and the Earth-Current, to discover the\r\nreason for this failing; but could not for a great while. And in that\r\ntime, oft did Naani hear the call of "Mirdath" thrilling about her; and\r\ntwice there came the solemn beat of the Master-Word in the night. Yet\r\nnever had she the power to answer. And all that while, as I learned in\r\ntime, was she stirred with a quaint ache at heart by the voice that\r\ncalled "Mirdath!" as it might be the Spirit of Love, searching for its\r\nmate; for this is how she put it.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it chanced, that the constant thrilling of this name about her,\r\nwoke her to memory of a book she had read in early years, and but half\r\nunderstood; for it was ancient, and writ in an olden fashion, and it set\r\nout the love of a man and a maid, and the maid\'s name was Mirdath. And\r\nso, because she was full of this great awakening of those ages of\r\nsilence, and the calling of that name, she found the book again, and\r\nread it many times, and grew to a sound love of the beauty of that tale.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, when the instrument was made right, she called into the\r\nnight the name of that man within the book; and so it came about that I\r\nhad hoped too much; yet even now was I strangely unsure whether to cease\r\nfrom hoping.\r\n\r\nAnd one other thing there is which I would make clear. Many and oft a\r\ntime had I heard a thrilling of sweet, faint laughter about me, and the\r\nstirring of the aether by words too gentle to come clearly; and these I\r\nmake no doubt came from Naani, using her brain-elements unwittingly and\r\nin ignorance; but very eager to answer my callings; and having no\r\nknowledge that, far off across the blackness of the world, they thrilled\r\nabout me, constantly.\r\n\r\nAnd after Naani had made clear all that I have set out concerning the\r\nLesser Refuge, she told further how that food was not plentiful with\r\nthem; though, until the reawakening of the Earth-Current, they had gone\r\nunknowing of this, being of small appetite, and caring little for aught;\r\nbut now wakened, and newly hungry, they savoured a lack of taste in all\r\nthat they ate; and this we could well conceive, from our reasonings and\r\ntheory; but happily not from our knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnd we said unto them, that the soil had lost its life, and the crops\r\ntherefrom were not vital; and a great while it would take for the earth\r\nwithin their pyramid to receive back the life-elements. And we told them\r\ncertain ways by which they might bring a more speedy life to the soil;\r\nand this they were eager to do, being freshly alive after so long a time\r\nof half-life.\r\n\r\nAnd now, you must know that in all the great Redoubt the story went\r\ndownwards swiftly, and was published in all the Hour-Sheets, with many\r\ncomments; and the libraries were full of those who would look up the\r\nolden Records, which for so long had been forgotten, or taken, as we of\r\nthis day would say, with a pinch of salt.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time I was pestered with questions; so that, had I not been\r\ndetermined, I should scarce have been allowed to sleep; moreover, so\r\nmuch was writ about me, and my power to hear, and divers stories\r\nconcerning tales of love, that I had been like to have grown mazed to\r\ntake note of it all; yet some note I did take, and much I found\r\npleasant; but some displeasing.\r\n\r\nAnd, for the rest, I was not spoiled, as the saying goes; for I had my\r\nwork to do; moreover, I was always busied Listening, and having speech\r\nthrough the darkness. Though if any saw me so, they would question; and\r\nbecause of this, I kept much to the Tower of Observation, where was the\r\nMaster Monstruwacan, and a greater discipline.\r\n\r\nAnd then began a fresh matter; though but an old enough trick; for I\r\nspeak now of the days that followed that re-opening of the talk between\r\nthe Pyramids. Oft would speech come to us out of the night; and there\r\nwould be tales of the sore need of the Lesser Redoubt, and callings for\r\nhelp. Yet, when I sent the Master-Word abroad, there would be no\r\nanswering. And so I feared that the Monsters and Forces of Evil _knew_.\r\n\r\nYet, at times, the Master-Word would answer to us, beating steadily in\r\nthe night; and when we questioned afresh, we knew that they in the\r\nLesser Redoubt had caught the beat of the Master-Word, and so made\r\nreply; though it had not been they who had made the previous talk, which\r\nwe had sought to test by the Word. And then they would make\r\ncontradiction of all that had been spoken so cunningly; so that we knew\r\nthe Monsters and Forces had sought to tempt some from the safety of the\r\nRedoubt. Yet, was this no new thing, as I have made to hint; saving that\r\nit grew now to a greater persistence, and there was a loathsome cunning\r\nin the using of this new knowledge to the making of wicked and false\r\nmessages by those evil things of the Night Land. And it told to us, as I\r\nhave made remark, how that those Monsters and Forces had a full\r\nawaredness of the speech between the Pyramids; yet could they have no\r\npower to say the Master-Word; so had we some test left, and a way to\r\nsure knowledge of what made talk in the night.\r\n\r\nAnd all that I have told should bring to those of this Age something of\r\nthe yet unbegotten terror of that; and a quiet and sound thankfulness to\r\nGod, that we suffer not as humanity shall yet suffer.\r\n\r\nBut, for all this, let it not be thought that they of that Age accounted\r\nit as suffering; but as no more than the usual of human existence. And\r\nby this may we know that we can meet all circumstances, and use\r\nourselves to them and live through them wisely, if we be but prudent and\r\nconsider means of invention.\r\n\r\nAnd through all the Night Land there was an extraordinary awakening\r\namong the Monsters and Forces; so that the instruments made constant\r\nnote of greater powers at work out there in the darkness; and the\r\nMonstruwacans were busied recording, and keeping a very strict watch.\r\nAnd so was there at all that time a sense of difference and awakening,\r\nand of wonders about, and to come.\r\n\r\nAnd from The Country Whence Comes The Great Laughter, the Laughter\r\nsounded constant ... as it were an uncomfortable and heart-shaking\r\nvoice-thunder rolling thence over the Lands, out from the unknown East.\r\nAnd the Pit of the Red Smoke filled all the Deep Valley with redness, so\r\nthat the smoke rose above the edge, and hid the bases of the Towers upon\r\nthe far side.\r\n\r\nAnd the Giants could be seen plentiful around the Kilns to the East; and\r\nfrom the Kilns great belches of fire; though the meaning of it, as of\r\nall else, we could not say; but only the cause.\r\n\r\nAnd from the Mountain Of The Voice, which rose to the South-East of the\r\nSouth-East Watcher, and of which I have made no telling hitherto, in\r\nthis faulty setting-out, I heard for the first time in that life, the\r\ncalling of the Voice. And though the Records made mention of it; yet not\r\noften was it heard. And the calling was shrill, and very peculiar and\r\ndistressful and horrible; as though a giant-woman, hungering strangely,\r\nshouted unknown words across the night. And this was how it seemed to\r\nme; and many thought this to describe the sound.\r\n\r\nAnd, by all this, may you perceive how that Land was awakened.\r\n\r\nAnd other tricks there were to entice us into the Night Land; and once a\r\ncall came thrilling in the aether, and told to us that certain humans\r\nhad escaped from the Lesser Redoubt, and drew nigh to us; but were faint\r\nfor food, and craved succour. Yet, when we sent the Master-Word into the\r\nnight, the creatures without could make no reply; which was a very happy\r\nthing for our souls; for we had been all mightily exercised in our\r\nhearts by this one message; and now had proof that it was but a trap.\r\n\r\nAnd constantly, and at all hours, I would have speech with Naani of the\r\nLesser Redoubt; for I had taught her how she might send her thoughts\r\nthrough the night, with her brain-elements; but not to over-use this\r\npower; for it exhausts the body and the powers of the mind, if it be\r\nabused by exceeding usage.\r\n\r\nYet, despite that I had taught her the use of her brain-elements, she\r\nsent her message always without strength, save when she had use of the\r\ninstrument; and this I set to the cause that she had not the health\r\nforce needful; but, apart from this, she had the Night-Hearing very\r\nkeen; though less than mine.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with many times of speech, and constant tellings of our doings\r\nand thoughts, we drew near in the spirit to one another; and had always\r\na feeling in our hearts that we had been given previous acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAnd this, as may be thought, thrilled my heart very strangely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE HUSHING OF THE VOICE\r\n\r\n\r\n    ("Dearest, thine own feet tread the world at night--\r\n        Treading, as moon-flakes step across a dark--\r\n      Kissing the very dew to holier light ...\r\n        Thy Voice a song past mountains, which to hark\r\n      Frightens my soul with an utter lost delight.")\r\n\r\nNow, one night, towards the end of the sixteenth hour, as I made ready\r\nto sleep, there came all about me the thrilling of the aether, as\r\nhappened oft in those days; but the thrilling had a strange power in it;\r\nand in my soul the voice of Naani sounded plain, all within and about\r\nme.\r\n\r\nYet, though I knew it to be the voice of Naani, I answered not\r\nimmediately; save to send the sure question of the Master-Word into the\r\nnight. And, directly, I heard the answer, the Master-Word beating\r\nsteadily in the night; and I questioned Naani why she had speech with me\r\nby the Instrument at that time, when all were sleeping, and the watch\r\nset among the Monstruwacans; for they in the little Pyramid had their\r\nsleep-time to commence at the eleventh hour; so that by this it was five\r\nhours advanced towards the time of waking; and Naani should have slept;\r\nnor have been abroad to the Tower of Observation, apart from her father.\r\nFor I supposed that she spoke by the Instrument, her voice sounding very\r\nclear in my brain. Yet, to this question, she made no answer in kind;\r\nbut gave a certain thing into my spirit, which set me trembling; for she\r\nsaid certain words, that began:\r\n\r\n"Dearest, thine own feet tread the world at night--"\r\n\r\nAnd it well may be that she set me to tremble; for as the words grew\r\nabout me, there wakened a memory-dream how that I had made these same\r\nwords to Mirdath the Beautiful in the long-gone Eternity of this our\r\nAge, when she had died and left me alone in all the world. And I was\r\nweak a little with the tumult and force of my emotion; but in a moment I\r\ncalled eagerly with my brain-elements to Naani to give some explaining\r\nof this thing that she had spoken to the utter troubling of my heart.\r\n\r\nYet, once more she made no direct answer; but spoke the words again to\r\nme across all the dark of the world. And it came to me suddenly, that it\r\nwas not Naani that spoke; but Mirdath the Beautiful, from out of all the\r\neverlasting night. And I called: "Mirdath! Mirdath," with my\r\nbrain-elements, into the night; and lo! the far, faint voice spoke again\r\nto my spirit through all the darkness of eternity, saying again those\r\nwords. Yet, though the voice was the voice of Mirdath the Beautiful, it\r\nwas also the voice of Naani; and I knew in all my heart that this thing\r\nwas in verity; and that it had been given to me to be birthed once more\r\ninto this world in the living-time of that Only One, with whom my spirit\r\nand essence hath mated in all ages through the everlasting. And I called\r\nwith my brain-elements and all my strength to Naani; but there came no\r\nanswer; neither sign of hearing, though through hours I called.\r\n\r\nAnd thus at last I came to an utter exhaustion; but neither could be\r\nquiet, nor sleep. Yet, presently, I slept.\r\n\r\nAnd when I waked, my first memory was of the wondrous thing which had\r\nbefallen in the sleep-time; for none in all this world could have known\r\nthose words; save it had been the spirit of Mirdath, my Beautiful One,\r\nlooking from above my shoulder in that utter-lost time, as I made those\r\nwords to her, out of an aching and a broken heart. And the voice had\r\nbeen the voice of Mirdath; and the voice of Mirdath had been the voice\r\nof Naani. And what shall any say to this, save that which I had in my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately I called to Naani, once, and again twice; and in a\r\nlittle moment there came all about me the throbbing of the Master-Word,\r\nbeating solemnly in the night; and I sent the Master-Word to give\r\nassurance, and immediately the voice of Naani, a little weak as was it\r\nalways when she had not the Instrument, but sent the message with her\r\nbrain-elements.\r\n\r\nAnd I answered her, and questioned her eagerly concerning her sayings of\r\nthe past time of sleep; but she disclaimed, and made clear to me that\r\nshe had no knowledge of having spoken; but had slept through all that\r\ntime of which I made to tell; and, indeed, had dreamed a very strange\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nAnd for a little while I was confused, and meditated, not knowing what\r\nto think; but came suddenly again to a knowledge that Naani\'s far voice\r\nwas thrilling the aether all about; and that she would tell to me her\r\ndream; which had set strong upon her mind.\r\n\r\nAnd she told the dream to me, and in the dream she had seen a tall, dark\r\nman, built very big, and dressed in unfamiliar clothing. And the man had\r\nbeen in a little room, and very sorrowful, and lonesome; and in her\r\ndream she had gone nigh to him.\r\n\r\nAnd presently the man made to write, that he might ease him by giving\r\nexpression to his sorrow; and Naani had been able to read the words that\r\nhe wrote; though to her waking spirit the language in which they were\r\nwrit was strange and unknown. Yet she could not remember what he had\r\nwrit, save but one short line, and this she had mind of in that he had\r\nwrit the word Mirdath above. And she spoke of the strangeness of this\r\nthing, that she should dream of this name; but supposed that I had fixed\r\nit upon her, by my first callings.\r\n\r\nAnd then did I, with something of a tremble in my spirit, ask Naani to\r\ntell me what she remembered of the writing of that big, sorrowful\r\nstranger. And, in a little moment, her far voice said these words all\r\nabout me:\r\n\r\n    "Dearest, thine own feet tread the world at night--"\r\n\r\nBut no more had she memory of. Yet it was a sufficiency, and I, maybe\r\nwith a mad, strange triumph in my soul, said unto her with my\r\nbrain-elements that which remained of those words. And my spirit felt\r\nthem strike upon the spirit of Naani, and awake her memory, as with the\r\nviolence of a blow. And for a little while she stumbled, dumb before so\r\nmuch newness and certainly. And her spirit then to waken, and she near\r\nwept with the fright and the sudden, new wonder of this thing.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately, all about me there came her voice thrilling, and the\r\nvoice was the voice of Mirdath, and the voice of Naani; and I heard the\r\ntears of her spirit make pure and wonderful the bewildered and growing\r\ngladness of her far voice. And she asked me, as one who had suddenly\r\nopened the Gates of Memory, whether she might be truly Mirdath. And I,\r\nutter weak and shaken strangely because of this splendour of fulfilment,\r\ncould make no instant answer. And she asked again, but using mine old\r\nlove-name, and with a sureness in her far voice. And still I was so\r\nstrangely dumb, and the blood to thud peculiar in mine ears; and this to\r\npass; and speech to come swift.\r\n\r\nAnd this way to be that meeting of our spirits, across all the\r\neverlasting night.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall have for a memory-picture, how that Naani stood there in\r\nthe world in that far eternity, and, with her spirit having speech with\r\nmine, looked back through the part-opened gates of her memory, into the\r\npast of this our life and Age. Yet more than this she saw, and more than\r\nwas given to me in that Age; for she had memory now and sight of other\r\ninstances, and of other comings together, which had some confusion and\r\nbut half-meanings to me. Yet of this our present Age and life, we spoke\r\nas of some yesterday; but very hallowed.\r\n\r\nNow, as may be conceived, the wonder of this surety which had come into\r\nmy life stirred me fiercely to its completion; for all my heart and\r\nspirit cried out to be with that one who was Mirdath, and now spoke with\r\nthe voice of Naani.\r\n\r\nYet, how should this be won; for none among all the learned men of that\r\nMighty Pyramid knew the position of the Lesser Redoubt; neither could\r\nthe Records and Histories of the World give us that knowledge; only that\r\nthere was a general thought among the Students and the Monstruwacans\r\nthat it lay between the North-West and the North-East. But no man had\r\nany surety; neither could any conceive of the distance from us of that\r\nRefuge.\r\n\r\nAnd counting all this, there was yet the incredible danger and peril of\r\nthe Night Land, and the hunger and desolation of the Outer Lands, which\r\nwere sometimes named the Unknown Lands.\r\n\r\nAnd I spoke much with Naani concerning this matter of their position;\r\nyet neither she nor her father, the Master Monstruwacan of that Refuge,\r\nhad any knowing either of our position; only that the Builder of the\r\nLesser Redoubt had come out of the Southward World in the Beginning, as\r\nthey had knowledge of by the Records.\r\n\r\nAlso, the father of Naani set that ancient Compass to bear; for, as he\r\nmade explanation to us through the Instrument, so great a power of the\r\nEarth-Current must be ours that, perchance it was our force which did\r\naffect the pointer from steadfastness. For, indeed, the needle did swing\r\nin an arc, as we heard, that held between the North and the South;\r\nwithin the Westward arc; but this it had done ever with them, and so was\r\na very helpless guide; save that, maybe, as we had thought, the force of\r\nthe Earth-Current that was with us, had in truth some power to pull the\r\nneedle towards us. And if this were so of verity, we made a reckoning\r\nthat set the Lesser Redoubt to the North; and they did likewise, and put\r\nus to the South; yet was it all built upon the sand of guess-work; and\r\nnothing to adventure the life and soul upon.\r\n\r\nNow we, of curiosity; though a million times had it been done in the\r\npast ages, set the compass before us, having it from the Great Museum.\r\nBut, as ever in that age, it did spin if we but stirred the needle, and\r\nwould stop nowheres with surety, for the flow of the Earth-Current from\r\nthe "Crack" beneath the Pyramid had a power to affect it away from the\r\nNorth, and to set it wandering. And this may seem very strange to this\r\npresent Age; yet to that, it was most true to the seeming nature of\r\nthings; and harder to believe that ever it did once point steadfastly,\r\nto prove a guide of sureness, and unfailing.\r\n\r\nFor, be it known, we knew the positions of the Land by tradition, coming\r\nfrom that ancient time when, in the Half-Gloom they had builded the\r\nPyramid; they having known the use of that ancient compass, and with\r\nsight of the Sun had named the Positions; though we of that far future\r\nday had forgotten the very beginnings of those Names of Direction; and\r\nused them but because our fathers did a million years and more. And\r\nlikewise we did the same with the names of the day and the night and the\r\nweeks and the months and the years; though of the visible markings of\r\nthese there was nothing but only and always the everlasting night; yet\r\nthe same seeming very natural to that people.\r\n\r\nNow, Naani, having heed to my constant questions, craved with an utter\r\nkeen hunger that I might come to her; but yet forbade it, in that it\r\nwere better to live and commune in the spirit, than to risk my soul, and\r\nmayhaps die, in the foolishness of trying to find her in all the\r\ndarkness of the dead world. Yet, no heed had I taken of her commands,\r\nhad I but known of a surety the _direction_ in which she might be\r\ndiscovered; and gained some knowledge of the space between, for this\r\nmight be named by thousands of miles, or but by hundreds; though a great\r\ndistance it was surely.\r\n\r\nYet, one other thing there was, that has point in this place; for when I\r\nsent my speech out into the night, using my brain-elements, I came to\r\nknow that, whether I had a knowledge of the North, or no knowledge at\r\nthe moment, yet did I turn oft with a sure instinction to that\r\nDirection. And of this, the Master Monstruwacan took very great note,\r\nand had me to experiment many a time and way, and so enclosed about with\r\nscreens, or with bandages across mine eyes, that I could not, save by\r\nthat inward Knowing, have any knowledge to point me the way. Yet would I\r\nturn Northwards very frequent, by a certain feeling; and seemed unable\r\nof speech, if I were turned otherwise by force.\r\n\r\nBut when we asked Naani whether she had an unusualness in this matter,\r\nshe could discover none; and we could but take note curiously of that\r\nwhich affected my habits; and which truly I set to the attracting of her\r\nspirit; for I had mind that she did be somewheres out that way in the\r\ndarkness of the world; but yet was this no more than to suppose, as you\r\nperceive.\r\n\r\nAnd the Master Monstruwacan wrote a study of this matter of the\r\nNorthwardness of my turning; and it was set out in the Hour-Slips of the\r\nTower of Observation; and so it came to be copied by the Hour-Slips of\r\nthe great cities, and made much comment, and much calling up to me\r\nthrough the home instruments; so that with this, and the speech that\r\nwent about concerning my powers to hear, I was much in talk, and\r\ndiversely pleased and oft angered by overmuch attention and importunity.\r\n\r\nAnd now, whilst I pondered this matter in all my spirit and being, how\r\nthat I should some way come to Naani, there befell a very terrible\r\nthing. And in this wise must I tell it:\r\n\r\nIt was at the seventeenth hour, when all the millions of the Mighty\r\nPyramid slept, that I was with the Master Monstruwacan in the Tower of\r\nObservation taking my due turn. And sudden, I heard the thrilling of the\r\naether all about me, and the voice of Naani in my soul, speaking. And I\r\nsent the Master-Word into the darkness of the world, and presently, I\r\nheard the solemn answer beating steadfastly in the night; and\r\nimmediately I called to Naani with my brain-elements, to know what thing\r\ntroubled her in her sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd her voice came into my spirit, weak and far and faint, and so that\r\nscarce I could make to hear the words. Yet, in a while I gathered that\r\nall the peoples of the Lesser Redoubt were in very deadly trouble; for\r\nthat the Earth-Current had failed suddenly and mightily; and they had\r\ncalled her from her sleep, that she might listen whether we answered\r\ntheir callings by the Instrument; but, indeed, no calling had come to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nAnd they who had been of late so joyful, were now grown old with sorrow\r\nin but an hour or two; for they feared that the fresh coming of the\r\nEarth-Current had been but the final flicker and outburst before the\r\nend. And, even in this short while of our speech, did it seem to me that\r\nthe voice of Naani grew further off from me; and I felt like to have\r\nbroken my heart with the trouble of this thing.\r\n\r\nAnd through all that remained of that sleep-time, did I converse with\r\nNaani, as might two lovers who shall presently part forever. And when\r\nthe cities awoke, the news went throughout them, and all our millions\r\nwere in sorrow and trouble.\r\n\r\nAnd thus was it for, maybe, a little month; and in that time had the\r\nvoice of Naani grown so weak and far-off that even I that had the\r\nNight-Hearing, could scarce make real its meaning. And every word was to\r\nme a treasure and a touch upon my soul; and my grief and trouble before\r\nthis certain parting drove me that I could not eat, neither have rest;\r\nand this did the Master Monstruwacan take upon him to chide and correct;\r\nfor that, if any were to help, how should it be done if I that had the\r\nNight-Hearing, and heard even now that the recording Instruments were\r\ndumb, came to ill-health.\r\n\r\nAnd because of this, and such wisdom as was mine, I made to eat and\r\norder my life that I might have my full powers. Yet was this beyond all\r\nmy strength; for, presently, I knew that the people of the Lesser\r\nPyramid were threatened by the monsters that beset them; and later I had\r\nknowledge from faint, far words whispered in my brain, that there had\r\nbeen a fight with an outside Force that had harmed many in their minds;\r\nso that in madness they had opened the gate and had run from the Lesser\r\nPyramid, out into the darkness of the Lands about them; and there had\r\ntheir physical bodies fallen to the monsters of those Lands; but of\r\ntheir souls who may know?\r\n\r\nAnd this, we set assuredly to the failure of the Earth-Current, which\r\nhad robbed them of all force and power; so that, in those few weeks all\r\nlife and joy of living had left them; and neither hunger nor thirst had\r\nthey, much, nor any great desire to live; but yet a new and mighty fear\r\nof death. And this doth seem very strange.\r\n\r\nAnd, as may be thought, all this made the Peoples of the Great Redoubt\r\nthink newly of the Earth-Current that issued from the "Crack" beneath\r\nthe Pyramid; and of their latter end; so that much was writ in the\r\nHour-Slips concerning this matter; yet in the main to assure us that we\r\nourselves might each be free from a disturbed heart; though some went\r\nfoolishly to the other event, and spoke of a speedy danger to us,\r\nlikewise; as is ever the way. But the truth of our own case lay, maybe,\r\nsomewhere between.\r\n\r\nAnd all the Hour-Slips were full also of imaginings of the terror of\r\nthose poor humans out in the darkness of the world, facing that end\r\nwhich must come upon all, even upon our mighty Pyramid; though, as most\r\nwould believe, so far away in some future eternity, that we have no\r\ncause to trouble.\r\n\r\nAnd there were sad poems writ to the peoples of that Lesser Redoubt, and\r\nfoolish plans set about to rescue them; but none to put them to effect;\r\nand no way by which so great a thing might be done; and doth but show\r\nhow loosely people will speak out of an over-security. Yet to me, there\r\nhad come a certain knowledge that I must make the adventure, though I\r\nachieved naught save mine own end. Yet, it were better to cease quickly,\r\nthan that I should feel, as now I did feel.\r\n\r\nThat same night, in the Eighteenth Hour, there was a great disturbance\r\nin the aether about the Mighty Pyramid; and I was awakened suddenly by\r\nthe Master Monstruwacan; that I might use my gift of the Night-Hearing\r\nto hearken for the throbbing of the Master-Word, which they had thought\r\nto come vaguely through the Instruments; but no one of the Monstruwacans\r\nwas sensitive enough of soul to account truly whether this was so.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as I sat up in the bed, there came the sound of the Master-Word,\r\nbeating in the night about the Pyramid. And immediately there was a\r\ncrying in the aether all about me: "We are coming! We are coming!"\r\n\r\nAnd mine inwards leaped and sickened me a moment, so shaken was I with a\r\nsudden belief; for the message seemed some ways to come to me from very\r\nnear to the Great Redoubt; as that they who sent it were nigh to hand.\r\n\r\nAnd, forthwith, I called the Master-Word into the night; but no answer\r\ndid there come for a while, and then a faint thrilling of the aether\r\nabout me, and the weak pulse of the Master-Word in the night, sent by a\r\nfar voice, strangely distant. And I knew that the voice was the voice of\r\nNaani; and I put a question through all the darkness of the dead world,\r\nwhether she were within the Lesser Redoubt, and safe thus far.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, there came a faint disturbance about me, and a small\r\nvoice in my soul, speaking weakly and out of an infinite distance; and I\r\nknew that far away through the night Naani spoke feebly, with her\r\nbrain-elements; and that she abode within the Lesser Pyramid; but that\r\nshe too had heard that strange pulse of the Master-Word in the night,\r\nand that message: "We are coming! We are coming!" And vastly had this\r\nthing disturbed her, waking her within her sleep; so that she knew not\r\nwhat to think; save that we were devising some method to come to them.\r\nBut this I removed from doubt, saying that she must not build on vain\r\nhoping; for I would not have her doubly tortured by the vanity of such\r\nbelieving. And, thereafter, having said such things as I might, though\r\nfew they were, to comfort her, I bade her, gently, to sleep; and turned\r\ntherewith to the Master Monstruwacan, who waited in quiet patience; and\r\nhad no knowledge of that which I had heard and sent; for his hearing was\r\nbut the normal; though his brain and heart were such as made me to love\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd I told the Master Monstruwacan many things as I put my clothing\r\nabout me; how that there had indeed been the calling of the Master-Word;\r\nbut not by any of that Lesser Redoubt; but that, to my belief, it had\r\ncome from nigh about the Great Pyramid. Moreover, it was sent by no\r\ninstrument; as I wotted that he did guess; but, as it seemed to me, by\r\nthe brain-elements of many, calling in unison.\r\n\r\nAnd all this did I set out to the Master Monstruwacan; and with\r\nsomething uncertain of fear and trouble in my heart; yet with a blind\r\nexpectation; as, indeed, who would not. Though, no longer was I shaken\r\nby that first thought of Her nearness.\r\n\r\nAnd I said to the Master Monstruwacan that we should go to the Tower of\r\nObservation, and search the Night Lands with the great spy-glass.\r\n\r\nAnd we did this, and lo! presently, we saw a great number of men pass\r\nover the Electric Circle that went about the Pyramid; yet they came not\r\n_to_ us; but went outwards towards the blackness and the strange fires\r\nand hideous mysteries of the Night Land. And we ceased from spying, and\r\nlooked swiftly at one another, and knew in our hearts that some had left\r\nthe Mighty Pyramid in the Sleep-Time.\r\n\r\nThen the Master Monstruwacan sent word to the Master Watchman that his\r\nwardership had been outraged, and that people left the great Pyramid in\r\nthe Sleep-Time; for this was against the Law; and none ever went out\r\ninto the Night Land, save the Full Watch were posted to the Great Door;\r\nand at a due time, when all were wakeful; for the Opening Of The Door\r\nwas made known to all the Millions of the Great Redoubt; so that all\r\nmight be aware; and know that no foolishness was done without their\r\nwotting.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ere any had power to leave the Pyramid, they must pass The\r\nExamination, and Be Prepared; and some of this have I set out already.\r\nAnd so stern was the framing of the Law, that there were yet the metal\r\npegs upon the inner side of the Great Gate, where had been stretched the\r\nskin of one who disobeyed; and was flayed and his hide set there to be a\r\nwarning in the Early Days. Yet the tradition was remembered; for, as I\r\nmight say it, we lived very close about the place; and Memory had no\r\nroom whereby she might escape.\r\n\r\nNow the Master Watchman, when he heard that which the Master\r\nMonstruwacan had to tell, went hastily with some of the Central Watch\r\nfrom the Watch-Dome, to the Great Gate; and he found the men of the\r\nSleep-Time Watch, with the Warder of the Gate, all bound, and stopt in\r\nthe mouth, so that none could make outcry.\r\n\r\nAnd he freed them, and learned that nigh five hundred young men, from\r\nthe Upper Cities, by the bigness of their chests, had come upon them\r\nsuddenly, and bound them, and escaped into the night through the\r\nEye-Gate in the top of the Great Gate.\r\n\r\nAnd the Master Watchman was angry, and demanded why that none had called\r\nby the instruments of the Watch House; but lo! some had made to call\r\nthus, and found them unable to wake the recorders which lay in the\r\ncentral Watch-Dome; for there had been tampering.\r\n\r\nNow, after this, they made certain new rules and Laws concerning the\r\norder of Watching, and made tests of the lesser instruments of the\r\ninward Pyramid, nightly, upon the coming of the Sleep-Time, which was,\r\neven in that strange age, by tradition called the Night, as I have given\r\nhint; though hitherto, until the way of my story was known, I have used\r\na word for the sleep hours that was yet not of that time; but somewhat\r\nan invention to make this history free from the confusion of "night" and\r\n"day," when, in truth, it was always night without upon the world. Yet,\r\nafter this, shall I keep to mine use the luxury of the true names of\r\nthat time; and yet, how strange is it that the truth should be of so\r\nlittle to our thinking.\r\n\r\nAnd so to go forward with my telling; for, though all this care were now\r\ntaken, it had no force until afterward; and at this moment were those\r\npoor foolish youths out in all the danger of the Night Land, and no way\r\nby which they might be succoured, or called back; save that Fear or\r\nWisdom should come to them quickly, that they cease from so wild an\r\nattempt. For it was to make rescue of those in that other, unknown\r\nPyramid, out in all the darkness of the World\'s Night that was their\r\nintent, as we had speedy knowledge from those boon friends that had been\r\nin the secret of their plot, which had seemed to them great and heroic;\r\nand was so, in verity, but that neither they who went, nor they who\r\nstayed, had a true awaredness of the danger they had dealing with, being\r\nall naught but raw and crude youths; yet, doubtless, with the makings of\r\nmany fine and great men among them.\r\n\r\nAnd because some had thus abetted that which they knew to be against the\r\nLaw, which was framed to the well-being and safety of all, there were\r\ncertain floggings, which might the better help their memories in the\r\nfuture as to the properness of their actions and wisdom.\r\n\r\nMoreover, they who returned, if any, would be flogged, as seemed proper,\r\nafter due examination. And though the news of their beatings might help\r\nall others to hesitation, ere they did foolishly, in like fashion, yet\r\nwas the principle of the flogging not on this base, which would be both\r\nimproper and unjust; but only that the one in question be corrected to\r\nthe best advantage for his own well-being; for it is not meet that any\r\nprinciple of correction should shape to the making of human signposts of\r\npain for the benefit of others; for in verity, this were to make one pay\r\nthe cost of many\'s learning; and each should owe to pay only so much as\r\nshall suffice for the teaching of his own body and spirit. And if others\r\nprofit thereby, this is but accident, however helpful. And this is\r\nwisdom, and denoteth now that a sound Principle shall prevent Practice\r\nfrom becoming monstrous.\r\n\r\nYet, now I must hasten that I set down how it fared with those five\r\nhundred youths that had made so sad an adventure of their lives and\r\nunprepared souls; and were beyond our aid to help them, who might not\r\nso much as make any calling to them, to bid them to return; for to do\r\nthis would have been to tell to all the Monsters of the Land that humans\r\nwere abroad from the Mighty Pyramid.\r\n\r\nAnd this would have been to cause the monsters to search the youths out\r\nto their destruction, and maybe even to awaken the Forces to work them\r\nsome dread Spiritual harm, which was the chief Fear.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, through all the cities of the Great Redoubt, the news\r\nhad gone how that five hundred foolish Youths had adventured out into\r\nthe despair of the Night Land; and the whole Pyramid waked to life, and\r\nthe Peoples of the South came to the Northern sides, for the Great Gate\r\nlay in the North-West side; and the Youths had made from there, not\r\nstraightly outwards, but towards the North; and so were to be seen from\r\nthe North-East embrasures, and from those within the North-West wall.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, in a while were they watched by all the mighty multitudes of\r\nthe Great Pyramid, through millions of spy-glasses; for each human had a\r\nspying-glass, as may be thought; and some were an hundred years old, and\r\nsome, maybe ten thousand, and handed down through many generations; and\r\nsome but newly made, and very strange. But all those people had some\r\ninstrument by which they might spy out upon the wonder of the Night\r\nLand; for so had it been ever through all the eternity of darkness, and\r\na great diversion and wonder of life was it to behold the monsters about\r\ntheir work; and to know that they plotted always to our destruction; yet\r\nwere ever foiled.\r\n\r\nAnd never did all that great and terrible Land grow stale upon the soul\r\nof any, from birth until death; and by this you shall know the constant\r\nwonder of it, and that _sense of enemies in the night about us,_ which\r\never filled the heart and spirit of all Beholders; so that never were\r\nthe embrasures utterly empty.\r\n\r\nYet, many beheld not the Land from the embrasures; but sat about the\r\nView-Tables, which were set properly in certain places throughout the\r\ncities, and so beheld the Night Land, without undue cranings, or poising\r\nof spy-glasses, though less plain-seen. And these same tables were some\r\nform of that which we of this age name Camera Obscura; but made very\r\ngreat, and with inventions, and low to the floor, so that ten thousand\r\npeople might sit about them in the raised galleries, and have\r\ncomfortable sight. Yet this attracted not the young people, save they\r\nwere lovers; and then, in truth, were they comfortable seats for\r\nquietness and gentle whisperings.\r\n\r\nYet now, as may be supposed, with all the Peoples of the Mighty Pyramid\r\ngrown eager to look towards one part of the Night Land, the embrasures\r\nwere hid in the crowds; and such as could gain no view therethrough,\r\nthronged about the View-Tables. And so was it in all the hours of\r\nleisure; so that women had scarce patience to attend their children; but\r\nmust hasten to watch again, that lonesome band of foolish youths making\r\nso blind and unshaped a trial to come upon that unknown Lesser Redoubt,\r\nsomewhere out in all the night of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd in this wise passed three days and nights; yet both in the\r\nsleep-time and the time of waking did great multitudes cease not to\r\nwatch; so that many went hungry for sleep, as in truth did I. And\r\nsometimes we saw those Youths with plainness; but other times they were\r\nlost to our sight in the utter shadows of the Night Land. Yet, by the\r\ntelling of our instruments, and the sense of my hearing, there was no\r\nawaredness among the Monsters, and the Forces of Evil, that any were\r\nabroad from the Pyramid; so that a little hope came into our hearts that\r\nyet there might be no tragedy.\r\n\r\nAnd times, would they cease from their way, and sit about in circles\r\namong the shadows and the grey moss-bushes, which grew hardly here or\r\nthere about. And we knew that they had food with them to eat; for this\r\ncould we see with plainness, as some odd, grim flare of light from the\r\ninfernal fires struck upon one or another strangely, and passed, and\r\nleft them in the darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd who of you shall conceive what was in the hearts of the fathers, and\r\nthe mothers that bore the youths, and who never ceased away from the\r\nNorthward embrasures; but spied out in terror and in tears, and maybe\r\noft with so good glasses as did show them the very features and look\r\nupon the face of son and son.\r\n\r\nAnd the kin of the watchers brought to them food, and tended them, so\r\nthat they had no need to cease from their watching; and beds were made\r\nin the embrasures, rough and resourceful, that they might sleep quickly\r\na little; yet be ever ready, if those cruel Monsters without made\r\ndiscovery of those their children.\r\n\r\nThrice in those three days of journeying to the Northward, did the\r\nYouths sleep, and we perceived that some kept a watch, and so knew that\r\nthere was a kind of order and leadership among them; also, they had each\r\nhis weapon upon his hip, and this gave to us a further plea to hope.\r\n\r\nAnd concerning this same carrying of weapons, I can but set out here\r\nthat no healthful male or female in all the Mighty Pyramid but possessed\r\nsuch a weapon, and was trained to it from childhood; so that a ripe and\r\nextraordinary skill in the use thereof was common to most. Yet some\r\nbreaking of Rule had there been, that the Youths had each achieved to be\r\narmed; for the weapons were stored in every tenth house of the cities,\r\nin the care of the charging-masters.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must make known that these weapons did not shoot; but had a\r\ndisk of grey metal, sharp and wonderful, that spun in the end of a rod\r\nof grey metal, and were someways charged by the Earth-Current, so that\r\nwere any but stricken thereby, they were cut in twain so easy as aught.\r\nAnd the weapons were contrived to the repelling of any Army of Monsters\r\nthat might make to win entrance to the Redoubt. And to the eye they had\r\nsomewhat the look of strange battle-axes, and might be lengthened by the\r\npulling out of the handles.\r\n\r\nNow, the Youths made, as I have told, to the Northward; but had first to\r\nkeep a long way to the North-East, that they might come clear of the\r\nVale of Red Fire. And this wise they journeyed, and kept the Vale about\r\nseven miles to the North-West of them, and so were presently beyond the\r\nWatcher of the North-East, and going with a greater freedom, and having\r\nless care to hide.\r\n\r\nAnd this way, it may be, certain of the giants, wandering, perceived\r\nthem, and went swiftly to make attack and destroy them. But some order\r\nwent about among the youths, and they made a long line, with a certain\r\nspace between each, because of the terror of their weapon, and\r\nimmediately, it seemed, the Giants were upon them, a score and seven\r\nthey were, and seeming to be haired like to mighty crabs, as I saw with\r\nthe Great Spy-Glass, when the great flares of far and mighty fires threw\r\ntheir fierce light across the Dark Lands.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a very great and horrid fight; for the Youths broke into\r\ncircles about each of the Giants, and many of those young men were torn\r\nin pieces; but they smote the Monsters from behind and upon every side,\r\nand we of the Mighty Pyramid could behold at times the grey, strange\r\ngleam of their weapons; and the jether was stirred about me by the\r\npassing of those that died; yet, by reason of the great miles, their\r\nscreams came not to us, neither heard we the roars of the Monsters; but\r\ninto our hearts, even from that great distance and safety, there stole\r\nthe terror of those awesome Brutes; and in the Great Spy-Glass I could\r\nbehold the great joints and limbs and e\'en, I thought, the foul sweat of\r\nthem; and their size and brutishness was like to that of odd and\r\nmonstrous animals of the olden world; yet part human. And it must be\r\nborne to mind that the Fathers and the Mothers of those Youths beheld\r\nall this dread fight from the embrasures, and their other kin likewise\r\nwatched, and a very drear sight was it to their hearts and their human,\r\nnatural feelings, and like to breed old age, ere its due.\r\n\r\nThen, in a time, the fight ceased; for of those seven and twenty Giant\r\nBrutes there remained none; only that there cumbered the ground seven\r\nand twenty lumbering hillocks, dreadful and grim. For the lesser dead we\r\ncould not see proper.\r\n\r\nAnd we that were within the Pyramid saw the Youths sorted together by\r\ntheir leaders, all in the dim twilight of that place; and with the Great\r\nSpy-Glass I made a rough count, and found that there lived of them,\r\nthree hundred; and by this shall you know the power of those few\r\nmonstrous things, which had slain full two hundred, though each youth\r\nwas armed with so wondrous a weapon. And I set the word through the\r\nPyramid, that all might have some knowledge of the number that had\r\ndied; for it was better to know, than to be in doubt. And no spy-glass\r\nhad the power of The Great Spy-Glass.\r\n\r\nAfter this fight, the youths spent a time having a care to their bodies\r\nand wounds; and some were made separate from the others, and of these I\r\ncounted upon fifty; and whilst the others made to continue their march\r\ntowards the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, these were constrained by\r\none who was the Leader, to return to the Pyramid. And in a little, I saw\r\nthat they came towards us, wearily and with many a halt, as that they\r\nsuffered great wounds and harm of the fight.\r\n\r\nBut those others (maybe two hundred and fifty Youths) went onwards into\r\nthe Night Land; and though we sorrowed at this thing; yet was there come\r\na huge pride into our hearts that those raw ones, who yesterday were but\r\nchildren, had so held themselves in the battle, and done a great deed\r\nthat day. And I wot that whilst their mothers wept, easeless, their\r\nfathers\' hearts swelled within them, and held somewhat of their Pain\r\naway from them for a time.\r\n\r\nAnd all this while, those wounded Youths came slowly, and rested, and\r\ncame on again, the better helping the worse; and a great excitement and\r\ntrouble there was in all the Mighty Pyramid, to learn which were they\r\nthat came, and they that went, and who lay out there quietly among the\r\nslain. But none might say anything with surety; for, even with that\r\ngreat spy-glass in the Tower of Observation, they were not overplain;\r\nsave when some light from the fires of the Land flared high, and lit\r\nthem. For they stood not up into the glare of the fires, as had the\r\nGiants. And though I saw them with clearness, yet I knew them not; for\r\nthere was so mighty a multitude in that Vast Redoubt, that none might\r\never know the half even of their rulers.\r\n\r\nAnd about this time, there came a fresh matter of trouble to our minds;\r\nfor one of the Monstruwacans made report that the instruments were\r\nrecording an influence abroad in the night; so that we had knowledge\r\nthat one of the Evil Forces was Out. And to me there came an awaredness\r\nthat a strange unquiet stole over the Land; yet I knew it not with mine\r\nears; but my spirit heard, and it was as though trouble and an\r\nexpectation of horror did swarm about me.\r\n\r\nAnd once, listening, I heard the Master-Word beating strangely low, and\r\nI knew the aether to thrill about me, and a faint stirring was there in\r\nmy soul, as of a faint voice, speaking; and I knew that Naani called to\r\nme some message across the night of the world; yet weak and coming\r\nwithout clear meaning; so that I was tormented and could but send\r\ncomfort to her, with my brain-elements. And presently I knew that she\r\nceased to speak.\r\n\r\nAnd, later, I heard that there was a new matter forward in the Redoubt;\r\nfor ten thousand men had assembled to attend the Room of Preparation\r\nfor the Short Preparation; and by this we knew that those poor Youths\r\nwho stumbled towards us through the dark, were presently to have help.\r\n\r\nAnd through all that Sleep-Time, there went forward the Spiritual and\r\nthe Physical Preparation of the ten thousand; and upon the morrow they\r\nslept, whilst an hundred thousand made ready their arms.\r\n\r\nAnd in this space of time the two hundred and fifty Youths that went\r\ntowards the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, had come very nigh thereto;\r\nhaving gone very warily and with some slowness, because, as may be, of\r\nthe lesson of the Giants.\r\n\r\nAnd to us in the Pyramid, the instruments made known constantly that\r\nInfluence which was abroad, and which all those of the Tower of\r\nObservation thought to proceed from the House of Silence. Yet, nothing\r\ncould we see with the Great Spy-Glass, and so could come to no sure\r\nknowing; but only to fear and wonder.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, the Youths were upon the Great Road, and turned to the\r\nNorthward. And beyond them, a great way, stood the House of Silence,\r\nupon a low hill at a certain distance to the right of the Road.\r\n\r\nBy now, they that were wounded had come to within, maybe, fifteen miles\r\nof the Great Redoubt; and the news went through all the Cities, that the\r\nten thousand men that were Prepared, made to arm themselves. And I went\r\ndown by the Tower Lift, and saw them come down by thousands from the\r\nRoom of Preparation; and none might go nigh to them, or cause them to\r\nspeak; for they were made Ready, and were, as it might be, holy.\r\n\r\nAnd all the millions of the Mighty Pyramid stood in their cities about\r\ncertain of the Main Lifts, and watched those thousands go downwards, all\r\nin their armour of grey metal, and each one armed with the Diskos, which\r\nwas that same very terrible weapon, which all had training to.\r\n\r\nAnd I doubt not but that the Young Men of the Pyramid looked, with\r\nlonging in their hearts, that they might have been among those that went\r\nforth to succour. Yet, the older men had graver thoughts in their\r\nhearts; for the blood ran more soberly in them, and they had knowledge\r\nand memory of the Peril. And by this, I would make clear that I speak\r\nless of the peril of the body, which is common to every state of life;\r\nbut of the peril of the spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd it may be thought by those of this age, that it was most strange\r\nthat they of that, having all the knowledge of eternity to aid them, had\r\nno weapon by which to shoot, and kill at a distance.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, this had not been so in the past; as our Histories did\r\nshow; for some wondrous weapons there had been, that might slay without\r\nsound or flash at a full score miles and more; and some we had whole\r\nwithin the Great Museum; and of others but the parts in decay; for they\r\nhad been foolish things, and reckless to use; for we of that Great\r\nPyramid, wanted not to kill a few of the Monsters that lay at a great\r\ndistance; but only those which came nigh, to harm us.\r\n\r\nAnd concerning those same weapons that killed silently at a great\r\ndistance, we had now little knowledge, save that they did waste the\r\nEarth-Current; and no practice had we concerning their workings; for it\r\nwas, maybe, an hundred thousand years gone that they had been used, and\r\nfound to be of no great worth in a close attack, and harmful otherwise\r\nto the peace, in that they angered, unneedful, the Forces of that land,\r\nslaying wantonly those monsters which did no more than beset the Mighty\r\nRedoubt at a great distance. For, as may be seen by a little thought, we\r\ndid very gladly keep a reasonable quietness, and refrained from aught\r\nthat should wake that Land; for we were born to the custom of that\r\nstrange life, and lived and died in peace, for the most part; and were\r\nvery content to have security, and to be neutral in all things that did\r\nnot overbear us; but, as it were, always armed, and ready.\r\n\r\nBut concerning the great and Evil Forces that were abroad in the Night\r\nLand, these we had no power to harm; nor could we hope for more than\r\nthat we had security from them, which indeed we had; but the hugeness of\r\ntheir power was about us, and we dared not to wake it; save through such\r\nextremity as had come to pass by this folly of the Youths; though, even\r\nnow, we had no thought to attack aught; but only to succour those\r\nwounded ones.\r\n\r\nAnd concerning this simplicity of weapons, which excites somewhat even\r\nmy wonder in this our present age, it may be that the powers of\r\nchemistry were someways quaintly limited by conditions in that age; and\r\nthere to be always a need to spare the Earth-Current; and hence, by this\r\ncause and by that, we were brought, by the extreme, nigh to the\r\nsimplicity of the early world; yet with a strange and mighty difference,\r\nas all may know who have read.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, the Word was sent to every City throughout the Great\r\nRedoubt--as was the Law--that the Great Gate should be opened; and each\r\ncity sent its Master, to form the Full Watch, as was the Law. And each\r\nwent clad in grey armour, and carrying the Diskos. And the Full Watch\r\nnumbered, two thousand; for there were also the Watchmen.\r\n\r\nThen the lights in the Great Causeway were made dim; so that the opening\r\nof the Gate should cast no great glare from within into the Night Land,\r\nto tell the Watcher of the North-West, and all the Monsters, that\r\ncertain humans went out from the Mighty Pyramid. But whether the vast\r\nand hidden Forces of Evil had knowledge, we knew not; and they who went\r\nmust but chance it, remembering that they were Prepared, and had the\r\nCapsule.\r\n\r\nAnd the ten thousand that were Prepared, went out through the Great\r\nGateway, into the night; and the Full Watch stood back from them, and\r\nspoke no word, but saluted silently with the Diskos; and they that went,\r\nraised each the Diskos a little, and passed out into the dark.\r\n\r\nThen the Great Gate was shut; and we made to wait and to watch, with\r\ntrouble and expectation within our hearts. And at the embrasures many\r\ndid comfort the women of those men.\r\n\r\nAnd I went back, upwards by miles, until I came to the Tower of\r\nObservation; and I looked out from there into the Night Land, and saw\r\nthat the ten thousand halted at the Circle, and made arrangement of\r\nthemselves, and sent some before and upon either hand, and so went\r\nforward into the Night Land.\r\n\r\nAnd after that, I went to the Great Spy-Glass, and turned it towards the\r\ntwo hundred and fifty Youths that were far off, upon the Road Where The\r\nSilent Ones Walk; yet for awhile I could not perceive them, for all the\r\nRoad seemed empty. But afterward I saw them, and they were clambering\r\nback into the Road, having gone aside, as I thought, because of the\r\npassing of one of those Silent Ones, that I saw now at a distance to the\r\nSouthward of them.\r\n\r\nThere passed then, some three hours; and in that time I varied my\r\nwatching between those far-off Youths, and the Ten-thousand that went\r\nforward to succour the wounded, that were now, maybe, scarce nine miles\r\ndistant from the Mighty Pyramid, and the Ten-thousand came very close to\r\nthem. And, in truth, in a little while, they spied one the other, and I\r\ngathered, in spirit, something of the rejoicing of those youths; yet\r\nweak and troubled were they, because of their wounds, and their\r\nknowledge of failure, and their disobedience of the Law.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, they were surrounded by the Ten-thousand, and carried\r\nupon slings; and all that body swung round towards the Pyramid, and came\r\nback at a great pace.\r\n\r\nAnd, in the same time, I heard the sound that made them so swift to\r\nhasten; for there smote up through the night the Baying of the Hounds;\r\nand we knew that they were discovered. And I swept the Great Spy-Glass\r\nover the Land, towards the Valley Of The Hounds, that I might discover\r\nthem quickly; and I saw them come lumbering, at a strange gallop, and\r\ngreat as horses, and it might be only ten miles to the East.\r\n\r\nAnd I looked once upon the Watcher of the North-East, and I saw and\r\nmarvelled that the great bell-ear quivered constantly; and I knew that\r\nit had knowledge, and gave signal to all the Land. Then did one of the\r\nMonstruwacans report that a new and terrible Influence was abroad in the\r\nLand; and by the instrument, we had knowledge that it approached; and\r\nsome of the Monstruwacans called foolishly with weak voices to the\r\nTen-thousand to haste; forgetting, and desiring only their safety from\r\nthat which came near.\r\n\r\nThen, looking with the Great Spy-Glass, I saw that there moved across\r\nthe Land, from the direction of the Plain of Blue Fire, a mighty Hump,\r\nseeming of Black Mist, and came with prodigious swiftness. And I called\r\nto the Master Monstruwacan, that he come and look through one of the\r\neye-pieces that were about the Great Spy-Glass; and he came quickly, and\r\nwhen he had looked a while, he called to the Monstruwacan that had made\r\nreport. And the Monstruwacan answered, and replied that the Influence\r\ndrew nearer, by the reading of the instrument; yet of the thing itself\r\nthe man had no sight.\r\n\r\nAnd I ceased not to look, and in a little while, the Humped thing passed\r\ndownwards into the Vale of Red Fire, which lay across the Land that way.\r\nBut I watched steadfastly, and presently I saw the black Hump climb up\r\nfrom the Vale of Red Fire upon this side, and come through the night, so\r\nthat in scarce a minute it had come halfway across that part of the\r\nNight Land.\r\n\r\nAnd my heart stood quiet with fear, and the utter terror of this\r\nMonster, which I knew to be surely one of the Great Forces of Evil of\r\nthat Land, and had power, without doubt, to destroy the spirit. And the\r\nMaster Monstruwacan leapt towards the Home-Call, and sent the great\r\nSound down to the Ten-thousand, that they might attend, and immediately,\r\nhe signalled to them to Beware. Yet, already I perceived that they knew\r\nof this Utter Danger that was upon them; for I saw them slay the Youths\r\nquickly, that their spirits might not be lost; for they were Unprepared.\r\nBut the men, being Prepared, had the Capsule, and would die swiftly in\r\nthe last moment.\r\n\r\nI looked again towards the Hump, and saw that it came like a Hill of\r\nBlackness in the Land, and was almost anigh. Then there happened a\r\nwonder; for in that moment when all had else gone quickly, that they\r\nmight save their souls, out of the earth there rose a little Light, like\r\nto the crescent of the young moon of this early day. And the crescent\r\nrose up into an arch of bright and cold fire, glowing but little; and it\r\nspanned above the Ten-thousand and the dead; and the Hump stood still,\r\nand went backwards and was presently lost.\r\n\r\nAnd the men came swiftly towards the Mighty Pyramid. Yet, ere they were\r\ncome to safety, the Baying of the Hounds sounded close upon them, and\r\nthey faced to the danger; yet, as I could know, without despair, because\r\nthat they yet lived after so enormous a peril.\r\n\r\nAnd the Hounds were very nigh, as now I beheld with the Great Spy-Glass;\r\nand I counted five score, running with mighty heads low, and in a pack.\r\nAnd lo! as the Hounds came at them, the Ten-thousand drew apart, and had\r\na space between the men, that they might have full use of that terrible\r\nDiskos; and they fought with the handles at length, and I saw the disks\r\nspin and glisten and send out fire.\r\n\r\nThen was there a very great battle; for the Light that arched above\r\nthem, and held away The Power from their souls, made not to protect them\r\nfrom this danger of the lesser monsters. And at an hundred thousand\r\nembrasures within the Mighty Pyramid, the women cried and sobbed, and\r\nlooked again. And in the lower cities it was told, after, that the\r\nPeoples could hear the crash and splinter of the armour, as the Hounds\r\nran to and fro, slaying; aye, even the sound of the armour between their\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nYet, the Ten-thousand ceased not to smite with the Diskos; and they\r\nhewed the Hounds in pieces; but of the men that went forth, there were a\r\nthousand and seven hundred slain by the Hounds, ere the men won to\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThen came that wearied band of heroes back to the home shelter of the\r\nVast Redoubt; and they bore their dead with them, and the Youths that\r\nthey slew. And they were received with great honour, and with exceeding\r\ngrief, and in a great silence; for the thing admitted not of words,\r\nuntil a time had passed. And in the cities of the Pyramid there was\r\nmourning; for there had been no sorrow like unto this through, mayhap,\r\nan hundred thousand years.\r\n\r\nAnd they bore the Youths to their Mothers and to their Fathers; and the\r\nFather of each made thanks to the men that they had saved the soul of\r\nhis son; but the women were silent. Yet, neither to the Father nor to\r\nthe Mother, was ever made known the name of the slayers; for this might\r\nnot be; as all shall see with a little thought.\r\n\r\nAnd some did remember that, in verity, all was due to the unwisdom of\r\nthose Youths, who had heeded not the Law and their life-teachings. Yet\r\nhad they paid to the uttermost, and passed outwards; and the account of\r\ntheir Deeds was closed.\r\n\r\nAnd all this while did great numbers spy toward the Road Where The\r\nSilent Ones Walk, that they might watch that band of Youths afar in the\r\nNight Land, who went forward amid those horrid dangers. Yet, when the\r\ndead Youths had been brought in, many had ceased to look out for a time\r\nand had turned to questioning, and some had made inspection that they\r\nmight know which had come back, and which lay out there where the Giants\r\nhad slain them, or went forward to more dreadful matters.\r\n\r\nBut who of those that were abroad, were slain, or still went onward, we\r\nhad but indifferent knowledge; though the men of the Ten-thousand knew\r\nsomewhat, having had speech with the wounded Youths, ere they slew them.\r\nAnd, as may be thought, these men were sorely questioned by the Mothers\r\nand the Fathers of those Youths that were not accounted of; yet I doubt\r\nthat few had much knowledge wherewith to console them.\r\n\r\nNow there was presently, in the Garden of Silence, which was the\r\nlowermost of all the Underground Fields, the Ending of those seventeen\r\nhundred heroes, and of the Youths that they saved and slew. And the\r\nGarden was a great country, and an hundred miles every way, and the roof\r\nthereof was three great miles above, and shaped to a mighty dome; as it\r\nhad been that the Builders and Makers thereof did remember in their\r\nspirits the visible sky of this our present age.\r\n\r\nAnd the making of that Country was all set out in a single History of\r\nseven thousand and seventy Volumes. And there were likewise seven\r\nthousand and seventy years spent to the making of that Country; so that\r\nthere had unremembered generations lived and laboured and died, and seen\r\nnot the end of their labour. And Love had shaped it and hallowed it; so\r\nthat of all the wonders of the world, there has been none that shall\r\never come anigh to that Country of Silence--an hundred miles every way\r\nof Silence to the Dead.\r\n\r\nAnd there were in that roof seven moons set in a mighty circle, and lit\r\nby the Earth-Current; and the circle was sixty miles across, so that all\r\nthat Country of Quiet was visible; yet to no great glare, but a sweet\r\nand holy light; so that I did always feel in my heart that a man might\r\nweep there, and be unashamed.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of that silent Country, there was a great hill, and\r\nupon the hill a vast Dome. And the Dome was full of a Light that might\r\nbe seen in all that Country, which was the Garden of Silence. And\r\nbeneath the Dome was the "Crack," and within it the glory of the\r\nEarth-Current, from which all had life and light and safety. And in the\r\nDome, at the North, there was a gateway; and a narrow road went upward\r\nto the gateway; and the Road was named The Last Road; and the Gateway\r\nwas named by no name, but known to all as The Gateway.\r\n\r\nAnd there were in that mighty Country, long roadways, and hidden methods\r\nto help travel; and constant temples of rest along the miles; and\r\ngroves; and the charm of water, falling. And everywhere the Statues of\r\nMemory, and the Tablets of Memory; and the whole of that Great\r\nUnderground Country full of an echo of Eternity and of Memory and Love\r\nand Greatness; so that to walk alone in that Land was to grow back to\r\nthe wonder and mystery of Childhood; and presently to go upwards again\r\nto the Cities of the Mighty Pyramid, purified and sweetened of soul and\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nAnd in my boyhood, I have wandered oft a week of days in that Country of\r\nSilence, and had my food with me, and slept quietly amid the memories;\r\nand gone on again, wrapped about with the quiet of the Everlasting. And\r\nthe man-soul within would be drawn mightily to those places where the\r\nGreat Ones of the past Eternity of the World had their Memory named; but\r\nthere was that within me which ever drew me, in the ending, to the Hills\r\nof the Babes; those little hills where might be heard amid the\r\nlonesomeness of an utter quiet, a strange and wondrous echo, as of a\r\nlittle child calling over the hills. But how this was I know not, save\r\nby the sweet cunning of some dead Maker in the forgotten years.\r\n\r\nAnd here, mayhaps by reason of this Voice of Pathos, were to be found\r\nthe countless Tokens of Memory to all the babes of the Mighty Pyramid,\r\nthrough a thousand ages. And, odd whiles, would I come upon some\r\nMother, sitting there lonely, or mayhaps companied by others. And by\r\nthis little telling shall you know somewhat of the quietness and the\r\nwonder and the holiness of that great Country hallowed to all Memory and\r\nto Eternity and to our Dead.\r\n\r\nAnd it was here, into the Country of Silence, that they brought down the\r\nDead to their Burial. And there came down into the Country of Silence,\r\nmaybe an Hundred Million, out of the Cities of the Pyramid, to be\r\npresent, and to do Honour.\r\n\r\nNow they that had charge of the Dead, did lay them upon the road which\r\nran up unto The Gateway, even that same road which was named The Last\r\nRoad. And the Road moved upwards slowly with the Dead; and the Dead went\r\ninward through The Gateway; first the poor Youths, and afterward they\r\nthat had given up life that they might save them.\r\n\r\nAnd as the Dead went upwards, there was a very great Silence over all\r\nthe miles of the Country of Silence. But in a little while there came\r\nfrom afar off, a sound as of a wind wailing; and it came onwards out of\r\nthe distance, and passed over the Hills of the Babes, which were a great\r\nway off. And so came anigh to the place where I stood. Even as the\r\nblowing of a sorrowful wind did it come; and I knew that all the great\r\nmultitudes did sing quietly; and the singing passed onwards, and left\r\nbehind it an utter silence; even as the wind doth rustle the corn, and\r\npass onwards, and all fall to a greater seeming quietness than before.\r\nAnd the Dead passed inward through The Gateway, into the great light and\r\nsilence of the Dome; and came out no more.\r\n\r\nAnd again from beyond the far Hills of the Babes there was that sound of\r\nthe millions singing; and there rose up out of the earth beneath, the\r\nvoices of the underground organs; and the noise of the sorrow passed\r\nover me, and went again into the distance, and left all hushed.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as there passed inward to the silence of the Dome the last of\r\nthose dead Heroes, there came again the sound from beyond the Hills of\r\nthe Babes; and as it came more nigh, I knew that it was the Song of\r\nHonour, loud and triumphant, and sung by countless multitudes. And the\r\nVoices of the Organs rose up into thunder from the deep earth. And there\r\nwas a great Honour done to the glory of the Dead. And afterwards, once\r\nmore a silence.\r\n\r\nThen did the Peoples of the Cities arrange themselves so that from every\r\ncity whence had come a Hero, were the People of that City gathered\r\ntogether. And when they were so gathered, they set up Tokens of Memory\r\nto the Dead of their City. But afterwards did charge Artists to the\r\nmaking of sculpture great and beautiful to that same end; and now did\r\nbut place Tablets against that time.\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards the People did wander over that Country of Silence, and\r\nmade visit and honour to their Ancestors, if such were deserving.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, the mighty lifts did raise them all to the Cities of the\r\nPyramid; and thereafter there was something more of usualness; save that\r\never the embrasures were full of those that watched the Youths afar upon\r\nthe Great Road. And in this place I to remember how that our spy-glasses\r\nhad surely some power of the Earth-Current to make greater the impulse\r\nof the light upon the eye. And they were like no spy-glass that ever you\r\ndid see; but oddly shaped and to touch both the forehead and the eyes;\r\nand gave wonderful sight of the Land. But the Great Spy-Glass to be\r\nbeyond all this; for it had the Eyes of it upon every side of The Mighty\r\nPyramid, and did be truly an Huge Machine.\r\n\r\nAnd to me, as I went about my duties, or peered forth through the Great\r\nSpy-Glass at the Youths upon the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, there\r\ncame at times a far faint thrilling of the aether; so that sometimes I\r\nwas aware that there was the beating of the Master-Word in the night;\r\nbut so strange and weak, that the Instruments had no wotting of it. And\r\nwhen this came, then would I call back through all the everlasting night\r\nto Naani, who was indeed Mirdath; and I would send the Master-Word with\r\nmy brain-elements; and afterwards such comfort as I might.\r\n\r\nYet hard and bitter was the truth of my helplessness and weakness, and\r\nthe utter terror and might of the Evil Forces and Monsters of the Night\r\nLand. So that I was like to have brake my heart with pondering.\r\n\r\nAnd the silence would come again; and anon the weak thrilling of the\r\nAether; but no more the far voice speaking in my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nINTO THE NIGHT LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, after that destruction which had come upon the Ten-thousand, and\r\nthe fresh assurance that was upon us of the terror of the Night Land, it\r\nmay be known that there could be no more thought to succour. Though, in\r\ntruth, those Youths that went now upon the Road Where The Silent Ones\r\nWalk were far beyond our aid.\r\n\r\nYet might it be thought that we should have signalled to them, calling\r\nby the Home-Call, which was that great Voice which went forth from the\r\nMachine above the sealed base of the Mighty Pyramid. But this we might\r\nnot do; for then we gave signal to the Monsters of that Land, that some\r\nwere even now abroad from the Pyramid; yet we could no more than hope\r\nthat the Evil Forces had no wotting of them; for, in verity, none might\r\never know the knowledge or the Ignorance which those Powers did possess.\r\n\r\nYet, it must be kept to the mind that we knew even then there was an\r\nInfluence abroad in the Land, strange and quiet; so that the Instruments\r\ndid not more than make record of it. And as I have surely set down ere\r\nnow, we had belief that it did come from that House of Silence, afar in\r\nthe Night Land, upon that low hill to the North of the Great Road. And\r\nmany among the Monstruwacans feared that it was directed upon the\r\nYouths; but of this there could be no surety; and we could but wait and\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\nNow, about this time those poor Youths did draw nigh to that part of the\r\nRoad Where The Silent Ones Walk, where it turned more swiftly to the\r\nNorth; and they to be now at no mighty distance from that grim and\r\nhorrid House.\r\n\r\nAnd presently we knew that the Influence had a greater Power in the\r\nLand; and I had an assuredness that it came from the House; yet no\r\ncertain proof was this. But I set out my feelings to the Master\r\nMonstruwacan; and he had trust in them and in my power; moreover, he\r\nalso had belief within himself that some secret Power came out from the\r\nHouse of Silence.\r\n\r\nAnd some talk there was at times that we send the Home-Call into the\r\nnight, to give warning to the Youths of our knowledge and our fear; and\r\nto entreat them to make a safe endeavour to return swiftly. Yet was this\r\nan error; and refused by the Master Monstruwacan; for it was not meet\r\nthat we put the souls of those Youths in peril, until such time as we\r\nhad certainty that they should be lost if we did not bestir ourselves.\r\nFor, indeed, this Home-Call was as a mighty Voice, calling over the\r\nworld, and did have so exceeding a noise, that it had immediately told\r\nall that Land how that some were yet abroad from the Great Redoubt. And\r\nhere will I set down how that the Home-Call had no use in those ages;\r\nbut had been a Call in the olden time when yet the great flying-ships\r\nwent abroad over the world.\r\n\r\nAnd there passed now a day and a night; and in all that time there\r\nceased not great multitudes to peer forth into the Night Land at the\r\nYouths. For it was known concerning the Influence, and all felt that the\r\nYouths did draw nigh very speedy to their fate; and much talk there was;\r\nand many things said, and much foolish speech, and kind intent; but no\r\ncourage to go forth to make further attempt to rescue; which, in truth,\r\ncalls not for great astonishment, as I have surely writ or oft thought.\r\n\r\nAnd in this place let me set down that the Land was, as it might be\r\nsaid, waked, and unquiet, and a sense of things passing in the night,\r\nand of horrid watchfulness; and there were, at this time and at that,\r\nlow roars that went across the Land. And if I have not told the same\r\nbefore this time, it must be set to count against me and my telling;\r\nfor, indeed, I should have writ it down before this place. Yet is the\r\ndifficulty of my task great; and all must bear with me, and entreat for\r\nme that I have courage, so that I may come at last to strength and\r\nwisdom to tell all that I did see.\r\n\r\nNow, in the space of this day and night, it was known that the Youths\r\nhad not slept, neither had they eaten, save once, as they who had the\r\nwatch through the Great Spy-Glass did affirm. But they to hasten alway\r\nat a woeful speed towards the North, along that Great Dismal Road, so\r\nthat presently they must cease, or slay themselves with their endeavour.\r\n\r\nAnd all this did give surety to our fears that they were under a spell\r\nfrom that horrid House afar in the Land; and we had an assurance that\r\nthis thing was. For, presently, there came a Monstruwacan to the Master\r\nMonstruwacan to report that there had come sudden a mighty Influence\r\ninto the Land; and in the same moment, as it might be, I spied through\r\nthe Great Spy-Glass, and did see those Youths break swiftly from the\r\nRoad Where The Silent Ones Walk, and begin to run very swift that they\r\nmight come quickly to the House of Silence.\r\n\r\nThen did the Master Monstruwacan hesitate not; but did send the\r\nHome-Call across the world, aye, even to those poor doomed ones that\r\nhastened, unknowing, to the terror which did compel them. And\r\nimmediately upon the sound, the Master did send a message to the natural\r\neye, in set language, and made warning that they suffered themselves to\r\nbe drawn to their destruction by a Force that came from within the House\r\nof Silence.\r\n\r\nAnd he besought them to put forth the strength of their spirits, and do\r\nbattle for their souls; and if they could in no wise compass a victory\r\nover _that which drew them onwards_, to slay themselves quickly, ere\r\nthey went into that House to the horror of utter destruction.\r\n\r\nAnd in all the Pyramid was there a great silence; for the bellowing of\r\nthe Home-Call bred a quietness, because of that which it did portend;\r\nand it was swiftly known by the millions that the Master Monstruwacan\r\ndid plead for the souls of the Youths; and there went forth,\r\nunknowingly, a counter-force from the Mighty Pyramid, by reason of the\r\nprayers and soul-wishings of the countless millions.\r\n\r\nAnd the counter-force was plain to my inward hearing, and beat all the\r\naether of the world into a surge of supplication; so that it stunned my\r\nspirit with the great power of it. And it seemed to me, as it were,\r\nthat there was a vast spiritual-noise in all the night; and I spied\r\ntremblingly through the Great Spy-Glass, and lo! the Youths did cease\r\nfrom their swift running, and were come together in a crowd, and had a\r\nseeming to be confused; as might some who have waked suddenly from\r\nsleep, to find that they walked in their sleep, and had come to a\r\nstrange place.\r\n\r\nThen came there a great roar from all the millions that spied from the\r\nembrasures--from nigh five hundred thousand embrasures they did look,\r\nand I count not the great View-Tables. And the shouting rose up like to\r\nthe roaring of a mighty wind of triumph, yet was it over-early to sound\r\nfor victory. For the counter-force which came from the intensity of so\r\nmany wills blent to one intent, was brake, and the Evil Force which came\r\nforth out of the House did draw the Youths again; so that they heeded\r\nnot their salvation; but turned once again to their running.\r\n\r\nAnd the Mighty Pyramid was full of a shaken silence, and immediately of\r\nlamentation and sorrow and horror at this thing. But in that moment\r\nthere did happen a fresh wonder; for there grew suddenly before those\r\npoor Youths, billows of mist--as it had been of pure white fire, shining\r\nvery chill; yet giving no light upon them.\r\n\r\nAnd the mist of cold fire stayed their way, so that we had knowledge\r\nthat there fought for the souls of them, one of those sweet Powers of\r\nGoodness, which we had belief did strive to ward our spirits at all\r\ntimes from those Forces of Evil and Destruction. And all the millions\r\nsaw the thing; but some with a great clearness, and many doubtful; yet\r\nwere all advanced more in spiritual sight and hearing than the normal\r\nPeoples of this Age.\r\n\r\nBut of them all, none had the Night-Hearing, to know a soul having\r\nspeech in the aether half across the world. Yet, as I have said, some\r\nthere had been aforetime who were thus given the Hearing, even as was I.\r\n\r\nAnd there came a Monstruwacan to the Master Monstruwacan to make report\r\nthat the Influence had ceased to work upon the Instruments; and by this\r\nthing we knew that in verity the Force which proceeded out from the\r\nHouse of Silence was cut off from us, and from those Youths; and we had\r\nassurance that there fought a very mighty Power for the salvation of the\r\nsouls of the Youths.\r\n\r\nAnd all the Peoples were silent, save for an underbreath of wonder and\r\ntalk; for all were utter stirred with hope and fear, perceiving that the\r\nYouths had some chance given unto them to return.\r\n\r\nAnd whilst the Youths yet wavered in their minds, as I perceived with\r\nthe Great Spy-Glass, and the knowledge of my soul, and of my natural\r\nwit, lo! the Master Monstruwacan sent once more the great Voice of the\r\nHome-Call abroad into the Land; and immediately besought those Youths\r\nfor the sake of their souls and the love which their Mothers had for\r\nthem, to come swiftly Homewards, whilst they had yet this great Power\r\nto shield them, and allow them sweet sanity.\r\n\r\nAnd I thought that some did look towards the Pyramid, as that they\r\nanswered to the mighty Voice of the Home-Call, and did read the message\r\nwhich the Master Monstruwacan made to them. But in a moment they faced\r\nabout, seeming to have a good obedience to one who did always lead; and\r\nof whom I had inquired, and found to be one named Aschoff, who was a\r\ngreat athlete of the Nine-Hundredth-City. And this same Aschoff, out of\r\nthe boldness and bravery of his heart, did make, unwitting, to destroy\r\nthe souls of them all; for he went forward and leapt into the billows of\r\nthe bright shining fire that made a Barrier in the way of their\r\nDestruction.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately the fire ceased from its shining, and gave way and sank\r\nand grew to a nothingness; and Aschoff of the Nine-Hundredth-City began\r\nagain to run towards the House of Silence; and all they that were with\r\nhim, did follow faithfully, and ceased not to run.\r\n\r\nAnd they came presently to the low Hill whereon was that horrid House;\r\nand they went up swiftly--and they were two hundred and fifty, and\r\nwholesome of heart, and innocent; save for a natural waywardness of\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nAnd they came to the great open doorway that "hath been open since the\r\nBeginning," and through which the cold steadfast light and the\r\ninscrutable silence of Evil "hath made for ever a silence that may be\r\nfelt in all the Land." And the great, uncased windows gave out the\r\nsilence and the light--aye, the utter silence of an unholy desolation.\r\n\r\nAnd Aschoff ran in through the great doorway of silence, and they that\r\nfollowed. And they nevermore came out or were seen by any human.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be known that the Mothers and the Fathers of those Youths\r\nlooked out into the Night Land, and saw that thing which came to pass.\r\n\r\nAnd all the people were silent; but some said presently that the Youths\r\nwould come forth again; yet the people knew in their hearts that the\r\nyoung men had gone in to Destruction; for, in truth, there was that in\r\nthe night which spoke horror to the souls of all, and a sudden utter\r\nquiet in all the Land.\r\n\r\nBut unto me (that had the Night-Hearing) there came a great Fear of that\r\nwhich might be whispered into my spirit, out of the Quietness of the\r\nnight--of the agony of those young men. Yet there came no sound, to the\r\nhearing of the soul; neither then nor in all the years that were to\r\ncome; for, in verity, had those Youths passed into a Silence of which\r\nthe heart cannot think.\r\n\r\nAnd here will I tell how that the strange Quiet which did fill all the\r\nLand, seeming to brood within the night, was horrid beyond all the\r\nroarings which had passed over the darkness in the time that went\r\nbefore; so that it had given my spirit some rest and assurance to hear\r\nbut the far-echoing, low thunder of the Great Laughter, or the whining\r\nwhich was used at times to sound in the night from the South-East, where\r\nwere the Silver-fire Holes that opened before the Thing that Nods. Or\r\nthe Baying of the Hounds, or the Roaring of the Giants, or any of those\r\ndreadful sounds that did often pass through the night. For they could\r\nnot have offended me as did that time of silence; and so shall you judge\r\nhow dreadful was that quiet, which did hold so much of horror.\r\n\r\nAnd surely it will be known that none had thinkings now, even in idle\r\nspeech, that any should have power to succour the Peoples of the Lesser\r\nRedoubt. Neither, as I have said, had any the knowledge of the place\r\nwhere it did stand.\r\n\r\nAnd so was it made plain that those Peoples must suffer and come\r\nunhelped and alone to their end; which was a sad and dreadful thought to\r\nany. Yet had those within the Great Pyramid come already to much sorrow\r\nand calamity because that some had made attempt in this matter. And\r\nthere had been for gain, only failure, and the sorrow of Mothers, and\r\nthe loneliness of Wives, and of kin. And now this dread horror upon us,\r\nwhich concerned those lost Youths.\r\n\r\nNow, as may be conceived, this _sure knowledge_ that we might give no\r\nsuccour to the People of the Lesser Redoubt, weighed heavy upon my\r\nheart; for I had, maybe with foolishness, held vague hopes and wonders\r\nconcerning our power to make expedition secretly into the Night, to\r\ndiscover that Lesser Pyramid, and rescue those poor thousands; and above\r\nall, as may be thought, had I the thought of that sweet moment in which\r\nI should step forward out of the night and all mystery and terror, and\r\nput forth mine arms to Naani, saying: "I am That One." And knowing, in\r\nmy soul, that she that had been mine in that bygone Eternity, should\r\nsurely know me upon the instant; and call out swiftly, and come swiftly,\r\nand be again unto me in that age, even as she had been in this.\r\n\r\nAnd to think upon it, and to know that this thing should never be; but\r\nthat, even in that moment of thought, she that had been mine in these\r\nolden days of sweetness, might be even then suffering horror in the\r\nPower of some foul Monster, was like a kind of madness; so that nearly I\r\ncould seize the Diskos, and run forth unprepared into the evil and\r\nterror of the Night Land, that I should make one attempt to come to that\r\nPlace where she abode, or else to cast off my life in the attempt.\r\n\r\nAnd oft did I call to Naani; and always I sent the Master-Word beating\r\nthrough the night, that she might have assurance that it was indeed I\r\nthat did speak unto her spirit, and no foul thing or Monster, spelling\r\nevil and lies unto her.\r\n\r\nAnd oft did I make to instruct her that never should she be tempted\r\nforth from the shelter of that Redoubt in which she did live, by any\r\nmessage out of the night; but always to await the Master-Word; and,\r\nmoreover, to have a sure knowledge that none that was her Friend would\r\never seek to entice her into the night.\r\n\r\nAnd this way and that way would I speak with Naani, sending my words\r\nsilently with my brain-elements; yet was it doleful and weariful and\r\ndreadful always to have speech into the dark, and never to hear the\r\nanswering beat of the Master-Word, and the sweet, faint voice whispering\r\nwithin my soul. Yet, once and again, would I have knowledge that the\r\naether did thrill about me, weakly, and to mine inward hearing it would\r\nseem that the Master-Word did beat faintly in the night; and thereafter\r\nwould my heart have a little comfort, in that I had assurance, of a\r\nkind, that the love-maid of my memory-dreams did still live.\r\n\r\nAnd constant, I put forth my soul to hark; so that my health failed me,\r\nwith the effort of my harking; and I would chide my being, that I had\r\nnot a wiser control; and so make a fight to do sanely.\r\n\r\nYet, day by day, did my heart grow more weary and restless; for, indeed,\r\nit did seem that life was but a very little matter, against so great a\r\nloss as my heart did feel to suffer.\r\n\r\nAnd oft, at this time and that, did there come a Voice speaking plainly\r\nout of the night, and did purport to be the voice of Naani; but ever I\r\ndid say the Master-Word unto the Voice, and the Voice had no power by\r\nwhich it could make the one answer. Yet I jeered not at the Voice, to\r\nshow contempt of its failing to bewit me; but let the matter bide; and\r\nthe Voice would be silent a time; and again would make a calling unto\r\nme; but never did I make speech with it (for therein lies the danger to\r\nthe soul), but always did speak the Master-Word to its silencing; and\r\nthereafter would shut the thing from my memory, and think only upon\r\nsweet and holy matters, as it might be Truth and Courage, but more often\r\nof Naani, which was both sweet and holy to my spirit and heart and\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was as I have set down, there were Monsters without in the\r\nNight that did torment me; having, it may be, intent to lure me unto\r\ndestruction; or indeed it doth chance that they had no hope but to\r\nplague me with malice.\r\n\r\nAnd, as may be thought, all this considering of my trouble, and the\r\ngiving of my strength unto Naani through the night of the world, that\r\nshe might have comfort and help, did work upon me; so that I grew thin,\r\nplainly to the eye of those that loved me.\r\n\r\nAnd the Master Monstruwacan, he that did love me, as I were his son,\r\nchid me gently, and had wise speech with me; so that I but loved him the\r\nmore, yet without having gain of health; for my heart destroyed me, as\r\nit doth if love be held back and made always to weep.\r\n\r\nAnd it may be thought strange that my Mother and my Father did not talk\r\nalso with me; but I had neither Mother nor Father those many years; and\r\nthis thing I should have set down early; so that none should waste\r\nthought pondering to no end. But the blame is to my telling.\r\n\r\nNow, concerning my love-trouble, there did happen a certain thing which\r\ngave me to decide; for one night I waked from a sore troubled sleep, and\r\nit did seem that Naani did call my name, mine olden love name, and in a\r\nvoice of utter anguish and with beseeching. And I sat up in the bed, and\r\nsent the Master-Word into the Night, with my brain-elements; and\r\npresently all about me there was the solemn beat of the Master-Word,\r\nanswering; but weak, and gone faint, that scarce I might hear it.\r\n\r\nAnd I called again with my brain-elements unto Naani, that was Mirdath;\r\nand spoke to give her assurance, and to haste to tell unto me that which\r\nwas so wrong and pitiful with her. And who shall be amazed that I was\r\nshaken with the eagerness of my spirit, in that it was so long since\r\nNaani had spoken clear within my soul; and now behold, her voice.\r\n\r\nYet, though I did call many a time unto the everlasting night, there\r\ncame no more the voice of Naani, speaking strangely within my spirit;\r\nbut only at times a weak thrilling of the aether about me.\r\n\r\nAnd, at the last I grew maddened with the sorrow of this thing, and the\r\nsense and knowledge of harm about the maid; and I stood upright upon my\r\nfeet, and I raised my hands, and gave word and honour unto Naani through\r\nall the blackness of the night, that I would no more abide within the\r\nMighty Pyramid to my safety, whilst she, that had been mine Own through\r\nEternity, came to horror and destruction by the Beasts and Evil Powers\r\nof that Dark World. And I gave the word with my brain-elements, and bade\r\nher to be of heart; for that until I died I would seek her. But out of\r\nthe Darkness there came naught but the silence.\r\n\r\nThen I clothed me swiftly, and went up quickly to the Tower of\r\nObservation, that I might speak instant with the Master Monstruwacan;\r\nfor my heart burned in me to intention, and to be doing speedily that\r\nwhich I had set upon myself to do.\r\n\r\nAnd I came to the Master Monstruwacan, and told all to him; and how that\r\nI did mean no more to suffer in quiet and to no end; but to make\r\nadventure into the Night Land, that I find Naani, or perchance find a\r\nswift peace from this my long troubling.\r\n\r\nNow, when the Master Monstruwacan heard that which I had to say, it sat\r\nheavily upon him, and he besought me long and many times that I refrain\r\nfrom this thing; for that none might achieve so great a task; but that I\r\nshould be lost in my Youth before many days were gone by. Yet to all his\r\nspeech I said naught, save that this thing was laid upon me, and even as\r\nI had promised, so should I make to act.\r\n\r\nAnd in the ending, the Master Monstruwacan perceived that I was set to\r\nthis thing, and not to be moved; and he did put it to me how that I had\r\ngrown to leanness, with so much troubling, and that I should have wisdom\r\nto wait awhile, that I put on my full strength.\r\n\r\nBut even as I was, so would I go; and this I told to him, gently; and\r\nshowed how that the thing was meet and helpful to the safety of my soul;\r\nfor that my strength was still in me; yet was I sweeter in spirit\r\nbecause that I stood lean and pure, and much poor dross and littleness\r\nhad been burned from me; so that fear was not in me. And all do I lay to\r\nthe count of my love, which doth purify and make sweet and fearless the\r\nhuman heart.\r\n\r\nAnd because I was even as I have said, so was I the less in trouble of\r\nthe Forces of Evil; for long and sore had been my Preparation of Spirit;\r\nand I wot that none had ever gone forth into the Darkness, so long\r\nwithholden from that which doth weaken and taint the spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me set down how that the Three Days of Preparation, which\r\nwere Proper to those that willed to go forth into the Night Land, had\r\nfor their chief aim the cleansing of the spirit; so that the Powers of\r\nEvil did have a less ableness to harm.\r\n\r\nBut also it was, as I have said, that none should go forth in ignorance\r\nof the full dreadfulness of all that held the Night; for it was at the\r\nPreparation that there was made known certain horrors that were not told\r\nunto the young; and of horrid mutilations, and of abasements of the\r\nsoul, that did shake the heart with fear, if but they were whispered\r\ninto the hearing. And these things were not set down in any book that\r\nmight be lightly come by; but were warded and safe locked by the Master\r\nof The Preparation, in the Room of Preparation.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, when I did hear that which presently I was to hear, I had\r\nwonder in my heart that ever any went out into the Night Land; or that\r\never the Room of Preparation should have other than Students that meant\r\nnot to go forth, but only to achieve some knowledge of that which hath\r\nbeen done, and mayhaps shall be once again.\r\n\r\nYet, in verity, is this but the way of the human heart; and hath always\r\nbeen, and will be so in all the years, for ever. For to adventure is the\r\nlust of Youth; and to leave Safety is the natural waywardness of the\r\nspirit; and who shall reprove or regret; for it were sorrowful that this\r\nSpirit of Man should cease. Yet must it not be thought that I do uphold\r\nfightings to the death or to mutilation, _between man and man_; but\r\nrather do sorrow upon this thought.\r\n\r\nNow, when the morrow came, if thus I shall speak of that which was\r\noutwardly even as the night, though changing alway within the Mighty\r\nPyramid, I went unto the Room of Preparation; and the Door was closed\r\nupon me; and I underwent the Full Preparation; that I might have full\r\npower and aid to come to success through all the terror of the Night\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nAnd three days and three nights did I abide within the Room of\r\nPreparation; and upon the fourth day was mine armour brought unto me;\r\nand the Master of the Preparation stood away from me, silent and with\r\nsorrow upon his face; but touching me not, neither coming anigh to aid\r\nme; nor having any speech with me; for none might crowd upon me, or\r\ncause me to answer.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, was I clad with the grey armour; and below the armour a\r\nclose-knit suit of special shaping and texture, to have the shape of the\r\narmour, and that I might not die by the cold of the Night Land. And I\r\nplaced upon me a scrip of food and drink, that might keep the life\r\nwithin me for a great time, by reason of its preparation; and this lay\r\nready to me, with the armour, and was stitched about with the Mark of\r\nHonour; so that I knew loving women thus to speed me.\r\n\r\nAnd when all was done and made ready, I took up the Diskos, and bowed in\r\nsilence to the Master of the Preparation; and he went towards the door,\r\nand opened it; and signalled that the People stand back; so that I might\r\ngo forth untouched. And the People stood back; for many had crowded to\r\nthe door of the Room of Preparation, so that I knew how that my story\r\nmust be to the heart of all, in all the Cities of the Great Redoubt; for\r\nto come unbidden anigh that Door was against the Lesser Law, and that\r\nany erred in this matter, betokened much.\r\n\r\nAnd I went out through the Door; and there was a mighty lane of people\r\nunto the Great Lift. And about the Great Lift, as I went downwards, did\r\nthe countless millions stand; and all in a great silence; but having\r\ndear sympathy in their souls; yet loyal unto my safety, in that none in\r\nall the Mighty Pyramid did make speech unto me, or call out aught. And\r\nas I went downward through the miles, lo! all the aether of the world\r\nseemed to be surged with the silent prayers and speedings of those quiet\r\nmultitudes.\r\n\r\nAnd I came at last unto the Great Gate; and behold the dear Master\r\nMonstruwacan did stand in full armour, and with the Diskos, to do me\r\nhonour, with the Full Watch, as I went forth. And I looked at him,\r\nquietly, and he looked unto me, and I bent my head to show respect; and\r\nhe made silent salute with the Diskos; and afterwards I went onwards\r\ntowards the Great Gateway.\r\n\r\nAnd they made dim the lights in the Great Causeway, that there should no\r\nglare go forth into the Land, when the Gate was opened; and behold, they\r\nopened not the lesser gate within the greater, for me; but did honour my\r\njourney, in that they swung wide the Great Gate itself, through which a\r\nmonstrous army might pass. And there was an utter silence all about the\r\nGate; and in the hushed light the two thousand that made the Full Watch,\r\nheld up each the Diskos, silently, to make salute; and humbly, I held up\r\nthe Diskos reversed, and went forward into the Dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE WAY THAT I DID GO\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I went forward for a space, and took heed not to look backwards; but\r\nto be strong of heart and spirit; for that which did lie before me had\r\nneed of all my manhood and courage of soul, that I come to the succour\r\nof that Maid afar in the darkness of the World, or meet my death proper,\r\nas it might need to be.\r\n\r\nAnd thus did I go forward steadfastly, and conscious in all my being of\r\nthe emotions of that parting from my mighty Home, and of the tenderness\r\nand wiseness that did underlie so much curbed rule and guidance.\r\n\r\nAnd my heart was warm towards the Master Monstruwacan for that great\r\nhonour, that he should come downward in armour to make one with the Full\r\nWatch, that he might uphold me to a lofty spirit at the moment of my\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nAnd all that time as I went forward, was the aether of the night about\r\nme, in tumult with the thoughts and blind wishings of the great millions\r\nI had but now left to my back.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, as I steadied somewhat upon my emotions, I was conscious\r\nof the exceeding coldness of the night air, and of the different taste\r\nof it upon my lungs and in the mouth; and it had, as it were, a wondrous\r\nkeen sharping upon my palate, and did fill the lips more in the\r\nbreathing; so that it may be supposed it had more body within it than\r\nthat air which did fill the plateau of the Thousandth City where was my\r\nhome; for the air of every City was of difference, and the greater\r\nbetween one that was afar up and another nigh to the earth, as may be\r\nthought; so that many Peoples did migrate unto that level which gave\r\nthem best healthfulness; but under rule, and with a guidance of\r\nquantities. And not all that were lacking of health; for, some are ever\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me set down that, within the deeps of the Fields, there was\r\nair utter varied and wonderful, that might charm one here and likewise\r\nsorrow another that were happier elsewhere; so that all might have\r\nsuiting, did they but wander, and have Reason to companion them.\r\n\r\nAnd thus did I go forward, full of new thoughts and olden memories, and\r\nfresh-breaking wonders; neither forgetting something of doubts and fears\r\nmore than a little. And again was it most cunning strange to be out\r\nthere in the Night Land--though not yet afar--where often had my fancies\r\nand imaginings led me; yet until that time never had I touched foot, in\r\nall that life, upon the outward earth. And this must be a wondrous\r\nquaint seeming thought to those of this present day.\r\n\r\nAnd so came I, at last, nigh to the Circle that did go about the\r\nRedoubt; and presently I was come to it; and something astonished was I\r\nthat it had no great bigness; for I had looked for this by _reasoning_;\r\nhaving always a mind to picture things as they might be truly, and hence\r\ncoming sometimes to the wonder of a great truth; but odd whiles to\r\nerrors that others had not made. And now, lo! I did find it but a small,\r\nclear tube that had not two inches of thickness; yet sent out a very\r\nbright and strong light, so that it seemed greater to the eye, did one\r\nbut behold from a distance.\r\n\r\nAnd this is but a little thing to set to the telling; yet may it give\r\nsomething of the newness of all; and, moreover, shall you have memory\r\nwith me in this place, how that oft had I seen Things and Beast-Monsters\r\npeer over that same little tube of light, their faces coming forward out\r\nof the night.\r\n\r\nAnd this had I seen as child and man; for as children, we did use to\r\nkeep oft a watch by hours upon an holiday-time, through the great\r\nglasses of the embrasures. And we did always hope each to be that one\r\nthat should first discover a monster looking inwards upon the Mighty\r\nPyramid, across the shining of the Circle. And these to come oft; yet\r\npresently to slink away into the night; having, in verity, no liking for\r\nthat light.\r\n\r\nAnd pride had we taken of ourselves to perceive those monsters which had\r\nmost of ugliness and horror to commend them; for, thereby did we stand\r\nto have won the game of watching, until such time as a more fearsome\r\nBrute be discovered. And so went the play; yet with ever, it doth seem\r\nto me now, something of a half-known shudder to the heart, and a child\'s\r\nrejoicing unknowingly in that safety which had power to make light the\r\nseeming of such matters.\r\n\r\nAnd this, also, is but a small matter; yet doth it bear upon the\r\ninwardness of my feelings; for the memories of all my youth and of the\r\nmany Beasts that I had seen to peer across the Light, did come upwards\r\nin my mind in that moment; so that I did give back a little, unthinking\r\nof what I did; but having upon me the sudden imagining of that which\r\nmight come out of the Dark, beyond.\r\n\r\nAnd I to stand a little moment, and presently had grown free in my heart\r\nto have courage of farewell; and so did turn me at last to the viewing\r\nof that wondrous Home of the Last Millions of this World. And the sight\r\nwas an astonishment and an uplifting, that indeed there was so mighty a\r\nthing in all the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd well might be that there were Monsters and Forces gathered together\r\nabout that Hill of Life, out of all the Darkness of the World; for the\r\nthing was as a Mighty Mountain that went up measureless into the night;\r\nand spread out upon the earth to the right and to the left of me, so\r\nthat it did seem to hold all the world with its might.\r\n\r\nAnd in the nearer slope were there three hundred thousand great\r\nembrasures, as well I did know; there being in all the four sides of the\r\nRedoubt, twelve hundred thousand embrasures, as was set out in the books\r\nof the schools, and upon the cover of Atlas-books as they still quaintly\r\nto be called, and many another place, as might be supposed.\r\n\r\nAnd half a mile upward was the lowest tier of those great window-places,\r\nand above that, countless other tiers. And a great light came out from\r\nthem into the darkness; so that I looked up into the night many miles,\r\nand yet did see them in shining rows; and did make separate each\r\nembrasure from its fellow for a great way. But there grew yet more,\r\nabove in the mighty distance, so that they were lost in the upward space\r\nof the night, and did seem to me presently but as a constant, glimmering\r\nfire, that did shape a shining Peak into the blackness of the heavens,\r\ndwindling into the utmost height. And thus was that Everlasting\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nThen did it come to me that those little things, which I did see to\r\ncluster against the embrasures, were in truth the countless millions of\r\nthe Mighty Redoubt; and this I could make out with some plainness in\r\nthose lower embrasures, which were the more near to me than they above;\r\nfor the Peoples were set against the light within, yet were as small\r\nthings like unto insects, in that distance, and within so Huge a Bulk.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew that they looked out upon me, and did watch through their\r\nspy-glasses. And I sent my gaze upwards again along that great Slope of\r\ngrey metal, aye! upward again to where it strode glimmering into the\r\nBlackness, and so at last to the little star that did crown that Wonder\r\nof the World in the eternal night. And, for a little, I did stare\r\ntowards that far light; for it came from within that Tower of\r\nObservation, where so lately I had spended my life; and I had knowledge\r\nwithin my heart that the dear Master Monstruwacan did bend the Great\r\nSpy-Glass upon me, through which so oft had I spied. And I raised the\r\nDiskos unto him, in salutation and farewell, though I saw him not at all\r\nthrough that vast space.\r\n\r\nAnd my heart was very full; yet my soul but the stronger for it. And\r\nthen, behold, I was aware of a murmur in the night, coming to me, dim\r\nand from afar off; and I saw the little shapes of the Peoples in the\r\nlower embrasures, in constant movement; and I knew upon the instant that\r\nthe Multitudes did take that salute unto themselves, and cried out and\r\nwaved to me their farewells, or to come back--as may be.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, I was but a lonesome person looking up at that great\r\nmountain of metal and Life. And I knew that I had danger to realise my\r\nplight; and I stayed no more; but did raise the Diskos, reversed, as was\r\nbut meet from one young man unto all the Millions.\r\n\r\nAnd I looked swiftly upward through those eight great miles of night,\r\nunto that Final Light which did shine in the black heavens; so that my\r\nfriend should know that I thought of him that was beyond my sight, in\r\nthat last moment. And it may be that the invisible millions that were\r\nfar up in the night, in the Upper Cities, did take that also to be a\r\nmeaning of farewell to themselves; for there came down out of the\r\nmonstrous height, a far, faint murmur of sound, as of a vague wind up in\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nThen did I lower the Diskos, and turn me about. And I breasted strangely\r\nagainst the Air Clog, and stept forward across the Circle, into the\r\nlonesomeness of the Night Land. And I looked no more behind; for that\r\nwhich was my Home did weaken my heart somewhat, to behold; so that I\r\nmade determination that I look not again to my back, for a great while.\r\n\r\nYet, about me as I went, there was constant surging in the aether of the\r\nworld; and it did tell unto me how that those, my people and kin, had\r\ncontinual mind of me, both in prayer and wishings, and in a perpetual\r\nwatching. And the same gave to me a feeling as of being something\r\ncompanied; yet, in a time, it came to me that this disturbance of the\r\naether should tell to some Evil Force how that I was there abroad in the\r\nLand. But how to stop this thing, who should have power? For, of truth,\r\nhad I been among them to make a full explaining of the danger, they had\r\nbeen yet powerless to cease; for but to have such great multitudes\r\na-think upon one matter, was to set a disturbance about, as should be\r\nmost clear to all.\r\n\r\nNow, at the beginning, I did walk outwards into the Night Land, somewhat\r\nblindly, and without sure direction; being intent only to put a good\r\nspace to my back, that I might cure somewhat the ache which did weaken\r\nmy heart at the first.\r\n\r\nBut, in awhile, I ceased somewhat from my overswiftness, and did put\r\nthought to my going. And I came quickly to reason that I should try a\r\nnew way through the Land; for it might be that there was an\r\nover-watchfulness in that part which had been trod by the Youths.\r\n\r\nAnd I began therewith to set this thought to the practice; and went not\r\ndirect towards the North; but to the North and West; and so in the end\r\nto mean to circle around to the back of the North-West Watcher, and\r\nthence to the North of the Plain Of Blue Fire; and afterwards, as might\r\nbe, have a true and straightway to the North; and by this planning come\r\na long way clear of that House of Silence, which did put more fear upon\r\nme than all else that was horrid in the Land.\r\n\r\nYet, as all will see, this made to me a greater journey; though, in\r\nverity, it were better to go slowly and win to success, than to make a\r\ngreater haste towards Destruction; which was, indeed, surely to be mine\r\nend, did I not go warily.\r\n\r\nNow it may be thought upon with wonder, that I did go so assuredly to\r\nthe North; but I went thiswise, part by an inward Knowing, and part come\r\nupon by much latter studying, within the Pyramid, of olden books; and by\r\nreasoning upon all things that I did observe, that had seemings of\r\nverity in them.\r\n\r\nAnd because of this constant searching upon one matter, I had come, but\r\na while back, upon a little book of metal, very strange and ancient,\r\nthat had lain forgot in a hid place in the Great Library through ten\r\nhundred thousand years, maybe, or less or more, for all that I had\r\nknowing.\r\n\r\nAnd much that was writ in the book was common knowledge, and set mostly\r\nto the count of fairy-tales and suchlike, even as we of this our age\r\ntake not over-surely any belief in Myths of olden times. Yet had I\r\nalways much liking for such matters, perceiving behind that outer shell\r\nwhich did win always so much unbelief, the kernel of ancient truths and\r\nhappenings.\r\n\r\nAnd thus was it, concerning this little book which I had made discovery\r\nof; for it told again, that which oft I had heard (even as we in this\r\nage, read of the Deluge) how that once, in a time monstrous far back\r\nfrom that, but utter future to this age of ours, the world did brake\r\nupwards in a vast earth-quaking, that did rend the world for a thousand\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nAnd there came a mighty chasm, so deep that none might see the bottom\r\nthereof; and there rushed therein an ocean, and the earth did burst\r\nafresh with a sound that did shake all the cities of the world; and a\r\ngreat mist lay upon the earth for many days, and there was a mighty\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, this was just so set in certain Histories of the Ancient\r\nWorld. Also, there was made reference to it, within some olden Records.\r\nYet nowise to be taken with a serious mind, to the seeming of the\r\npeoples of the Mighty Pyramid; but only as a quaint study for the\r\nStudents, and to be set out in little tales that did entertain the\r\nnurseries; or, as it might be, wise men and the general.\r\n\r\nYet, there was this, about that small and peculiar book, that it did\r\nspeak of many of these things, as it were that it did quote from the\r\npens of those that did have actual witness; and set all out with a\r\nstrange gravity, that did cause one to consider it as meant to be indeed\r\nthe tellings of Truth, and to seem thiswise to have great difference\r\nfrom all that I had read before concerning those matters.\r\n\r\nAnd there was, further, a part in the ending of the book, that did seem\r\nto be writ of a time that came afterwards, maybe an hundred thousand,\r\nand maybe a million years; but who shall say.\r\n\r\nAnd therein it did tell of an huge and mighty Valley that did come out\r\nof the West, towards the South-East, and made turning thence Northwards,\r\nand was a thousand miles both ways. And the sides thereof were an\r\nhundred miles deep, and the Sun did stand in the Western end, and made a\r\nred gloom for a thousand miles. And in the bottom there were great seas;\r\nand beasts strange and awesome, and very plentiful.\r\n\r\nNow this, as may be seen, was as the talk of Romance; yet did I turn my\r\nwits to their natural end, and made thus plain of it. For, in truth, I\r\nto have something of belief, and it to seem to me that in a bygone\r\nEternity, when the world was yet light, as in my heart I knew to have\r\nbeen indeed a thing of verity, there was a great and wondrous\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nAnd the earthquake did burst the world up, along a certain great curve\r\nwhere it had weakness; and there fell into the yawning furnace of the\r\nworld, one of the great oceans; and immediately made of itself steam,\r\nand so brake upwards again, and tore the earth mightily in its swift\r\nuprising.\r\n\r\nAnd thereafter there was a mist and confusion and rain upon the world.\r\nAnd, indeed, all very seemly put; and not to be taken as a light tale.\r\n\r\nThen, in that ending of the book, there was one that did write, having\r\nlived in a vast later age, when the Sun had come anigh to his dying, and\r\nthe upward earth was grown quiet and cold and not good to live upon. And\r\nin that time the Mighty Chasm had been calmed by the weight of an\r\nEternity, so that it was now a most deep and wondrous Valley, that did\r\nhold Seas and great Hills and Mountains; and in it were great forests of\r\nkinds, and Lands that were good and healthful; and Places given over to\r\nFire, and to Steamings, and Sulphur Clouds; so that they held Poisons\r\nthat had ill for Man.\r\n\r\nAnd Great Beasts were there down in that far depth, that none might see\r\never, save by a strong spy-glass. And such there were in the Early\r\nWorld, and had now been bred in the Ending by those inward forces of\r\nNature which did make the Valley a place of Good Warmth; so that there\r\nwas, as it were, once more the Primal World born to give new birth unto\r\nsuch olden Monsters, and to others, new and Peculiar to that Age and\r\nCircumstance.\r\n\r\nAnd all this, indeed, did the book give also; but constrained and\r\ndifficult to take clearly to the heart, and not like to the wise plain\r\nspeech of the early tellings; so that I must even set it out here in\r\nmine own speech.\r\n\r\nAnd it did seem to me, by my reading, that Man had come at one time to a\r\ngreat softness of Heart and Spirit through many ages of over-ease. But\r\nthat the World did come to coldness and unfriendliness, by reason of the\r\nSun\'s slow ceasing.\r\n\r\nAnd there was presently, in naturalness, a Race upon the earth that were\r\nhardy, and made to fight for their lives; and did perceive that the\r\nMighty Valley that cut the World in twain, was a place of Warmth and\r\nLife; and so did make to adventure their bodies down that wondrous\r\nHeight; and were many Ages coming safe to the Bottom; but did find safe\r\nplaces in the downward way where they built them Houses, and made to\r\nlive, and begot them children; and these grew up to that life of\r\nconstant and great climbings, and of hard workings upon The Road, which\r\nwas the One Intent of that People; so that the book did speak of them\r\nalways as The Road Makers.\r\n\r\nAnd thus did they make downwards through the long years and the ages;\r\nand many generations did live and die, and saw not the reaching of the\r\nRoad down into that Great Vale that lay so monstrous deep in the World.\r\n\r\nBut in the end they did come there with the Road; and they were very\r\nHardy; and they did fight with the Monsters and slay many; and they\r\nbuilt them many Cities, through great years in the Mighty Valley, and\r\ndid make the Road from City unto City along that Great Valley, even unto\r\nthe Bight of the Valley. And they found here a constant darkness and\r\nShadow; for that the Sun could not make a shining around that Great\r\nCorner. Yet, even here they ceased not to make the Road; but took it\r\naround, and a mighty way unto the North; passing it among strange Fires\r\nand Pits that burned from out of the earth.\r\n\r\nBut there was presently, such a power and horror of Monsters and Evil\r\nThings in that Valley of Shadow, that the Road Makers were made to go\r\nBackwards into the Red Light which did fill the Westward Valley, and\r\ncame from that low Sun.\r\n\r\nAnd they went back unto their Cities; and lived there mayhaps an hundred\r\nthousand years; and grew wise and cunning in all matters; and their Wise\r\nPeople did make dealings and had experiment with those Forces which are\r\nDistasteful and Harmful unto Life; but they did this in Ignorance; for\r\nall that they had much wisdom; thinking only to Experiment, that they\r\ncome to greater knowings. But they did open a way for those Forces; and\r\nmuch harm and Pity did come thereby. And then had all People to have\r\nRegret; yet too late.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, when an hundred thousand years had gone, or it may be a\r\ngreater space; there came slowly the utter twilight of the world, as the\r\nsun to die the more; so that presently it gave but an utter gloomy\r\nlight. And there grew upon many of the Peoples of the Cities of the\r\nValley, a strangeness and a wildness; so that strange things were done,\r\nthat had been shameful to all in the Light. And there were wanderings,\r\nand consortings with strange outward beings, and presently, many Cities\r\nwere attacked by monsters that did come from the West; and there was a\r\nPandemonium.\r\n\r\nThen was an Age of Sorrows and Fightings, and Hardenings of the Spirit\r\nand of the Heart, for all that were of good Fibre; and this did breed a\r\nDetermined Generation; and there grew up into the World a Leader; and he\r\ntook all the sound Millions; and did make a mighty Battle upon all\r\nFoulness and upon all that did harm and trouble them; and they drove\r\ntheir Enemies down the Valley, and up the Valley, and did utterly\r\nscatter and put them to flight.\r\n\r\nThen did that Man call all his Peoples together; and did make it plain\r\nhow that the Darkness grew upon the World, and that the Foul and\r\ndreadful Powers abroad, were like to be more Horrid when a greater Gloom\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nAnd he put to them that they Build a Mighty Refuge; and the Peoples did\r\nacclaim; and lo! there was built, presently, a Great House. But the\r\nGreat House was not Proper; and that Man did take all the Peoples to\r\nWander; and they came to the Bight; and there was built at last that\r\nGreat and Mighty Pyramid.\r\n\r\nNow this is the sense and telling of that book; and but late had I read\r\nit; and talked somewhat of it with my dear friend, the Master\r\nMonstruwacan; but not overmuch; for I had taken so sudden a mind to GO,\r\nthat all else had dropped from about me. Yet, to us it did seem clear\r\nthat there was no life in all the invisible upper world; and that,\r\nsurely, that Great Road whereon the Silent Ones did walk, must be that\r\nsame Road which the hardy Peoples of that age did make.\r\n\r\nAnd it did seem wise to the Master Monstruwacan, and unto me, that if\r\nany should find the Lesser Redoubt, they must surely do so somewhere\r\nwithin the mighty Valley; but whether The Road that led into the West,\r\nwhere was the Place of the Ab-humans, should bring me to it, I had no\r\nknowing; nor whether it might lie on the Northward way. And I, maybe, to\r\nwander a thousand miles wrong; if, in truth, I were not into some\r\ndreadful trouble before.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, no reason of value was there to give me hope that the\r\nLesser Pyramid lay either to the West, or where the Road went\r\nNorth-ward, beyond the House of Silence. Yet I did so feel it to be\r\nsomewhere to the North, that I had made a determination to search that\r\nway for a great distance, the first; and if I could not come upon aught,\r\nthen I should have sober thought that it did lie Westward. But in the\r\nValley someways, I had feeling of assurance that it must be; for it was\r\nplain that the telling of the book was sound in its bottom sense; as\r\nmight be seen; for how should any live in the utter bleak and deadly\r\nchill of the silent upper world that lay an hundred miles up in the\r\nnight, hid and lost for ever.\r\n\r\nAnd strange is it to think of those wondrous and mighty cliffs that\r\ngirt us about, and yet were fast held from us in the dark; so that I\r\nhad not known of them, save for the telling of that book; though, in\r\ntruth, it had been always supposed that we lived in a great deep of the\r\nworld; but, indeed, it was rather held in belief that we abode in the\r\nbed of some ancient sea, that did surely slope gradual away from us, and\r\nnot go up abrupt and savage.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me make so clear as I may that the general peoples had no\r\nclear thought upon any such matters; though there was something of it\r\ntaught in the schools; yet rather this and that, of diverse conclusions,\r\nas it might be thinkings of the Teachers, after much study, and some\r\nponderings. For one man, having a lack of imagining, would scoff, and\r\nanother, maybe, to take it very staidly, but some would build Fancy upon\r\nthe tellings of the Records, and make foolish and fantastic that which\r\nhad groundings in Truth; and thus is it ever. But to the most Peoples of\r\nthe Pyramid, there was no deep conviction nor thought of any great hid\r\nWorld afar in the darkness. For they gave attention and belief only to\r\nthat which lay to their view; nor could a great lot come to imagine that\r\nthere had been ever any other Condition.\r\n\r\nAnd to them, it did seem right and meet that there should be strange\r\nthings, and fires from the earth, and an ever-abiding night, and\r\nmonsters, and matters hid and tangled much in mystery.\r\n\r\nAnd very content were the most of them; though some had in them the\r\nyeast of imaginings, or the pimples of fancy upon them, and to these\r\nthere seemed many possibilities; though the first to read out to sanity;\r\nand the second, to expect and have speech towards much that was foolish\r\nor to no purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd of these vague believings of the peoples, have I made hint before,\r\nand need not have much trouble to it now. Save that, with the children,\r\nas is ever the way, those olden tales had much believing; and the\r\nsimplicity of the Wise did mate with the beliefs of the Young; and\r\nbetween them did lie the Truth.\r\n\r\nAnd so did I make speed towards the North, having a strong surety in my\r\nheart and mind that there were but two ways to my search; for without of\r\nthe Valley, afar up in the dead lonesomeness of the hidden world, was a\r\ncold that was shapen ready to Death, and a lacking, as I must believe,\r\nof the sweet, needful air that yet did lie in plenty in that deep place\r\nof the earth. So that, surely, the mighty Valley somewheres to hold that\r\nother Redoubt.\r\n\r\nYet, as I have said, I went not direct to my journey, but otherwise, for\r\nthose sound reasons which I did set down a time back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, as I went towards the North and West, I steered me warily for a\r\ngreat while, that I come safe of that Great Watcher of the North-West.\r\nAnd as I made forward, I put thought to all matters which must concern\r\nme; so far as I had imagining to see. And first I did consider the speed\r\nthat I should keep; and found presently that I did well to be moderate;\r\nfor that I had before me a great and mighty journey; and indeed, who\r\nmight speak knowingly of the end thereof?\r\n\r\nAnd another matter, I did arrange; for I would make the times of my\r\ngoings forward, and the times of mine eatings and sleepings all to a\r\nwise and regular fashion; that, thereby, I might go a great way, with\r\nthe less harm to my body; so that I should be strong when the need did\r\ncome for my strength. And I made in the end that I should eat and drink,\r\nat every sixth hour, and at the eighteenth hour sleep me until the\r\ntwenty-fourth.\r\n\r\nAnd by this means did I eat thrice in that time, and have six hours of\r\nsleep. And this seemed very good to me, and I did strive always to\r\nmanage thus in all my great journeying in the Night Land. Yet, as may be\r\nsupposed, there were times oft and many when I must watch without\r\nceasing, and leave my slumber unto the future; for the Land was full of\r\ngrim and dreadful Perils.\r\n\r\nAnd, as doth be human, I brake my rule straightway in the beginning; for\r\nI ceased not to walk for one-and-twenty hours, hiding and creeping, as\r\nthe need did be in those places that were like to show me unto the\r\nWatcher; and when I did think upon food, it did sicken me; so that I\r\nwould eat by and by, as I made it within my thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut when one-and-twenty hours had gone, I grew very weary and something\r\nfaint; and was forced that I look about for some place where I might\r\nhave rest. And, in a little while, I did see, away off, a small\r\nfire-hole, the like of which I had passed odd times even so early. And I\r\nmade to come nigh to that part; for there would be warmth from the\r\nchill of the Night Land, and mayhaps a place dry and convenient to my\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nAnd when I came anigh, I saw that it was a cheerful place, as it might\r\nbe said, amid so much gloom; for the hole was but a few paces wide, and\r\nfull of a dull, glowing fire, that did bubble somewhat, and throw off a\r\nsmall sulphur-smoke. And I sat me down, at no great way, and did place\r\nthe Diskos on the rock to my hand.\r\n\r\nAnd I moved not, awhile; but was aweary, so that I had not the courage\r\nto eat, neither to drink; but must turn me and look back to the Mighty\r\nPyramid; and, in truth, though I had come a very good space, yet was I\r\nso anigh to it, that I was both cheered and put out of heart; for it did\r\nseem close upon me, by reason of its greatness, so that I, who had\r\njourneyed a hard and weariful way, was shaken with the greatness of the\r\ntask that was upon me.\r\n\r\nYet was this but one side of my heart; for it was good to feel the\r\nnearness of my Mighty Home; and I knew that there did countless millions\r\nmake watch upon me, as I sat; yet did I make no sign; for it is not meet\r\nto make a constant farewell; but to GO. Yet was it very strange to be\r\nthus near, and to show such behaviour as were proper to one afar from\r\nall humanity. But so it was that I ordered my ways; for it did seem\r\nproper to me; yet was I happy to know that the dear Master Monstruwacan\r\nmust, time and oft, have spied upon me through the Great Spy-Glass; and\r\nmayhaps did watch me in that moment.\r\n\r\nAnd it grew in me that I did act weakly to hold off from mine Vittles,\r\nand showed foolishness before my kind friend afar; and I did ope my\r\nscrip, and take therefrom three tablets, the which I chewed and did eat;\r\nfor this was a strong food, treated that it had but small bulk. Yet were\r\nthey not filling to the belly; and I made that I would drink well, that\r\nI might feel that something was therein.\r\n\r\nAnd to this end, I shook from a strong and especial tube, a dust; and I\r\ncaught the dust within a little cup; and the air did make an action upon\r\nthat dust, as it were of chemistry; and the dust did boil and make a\r\nfizzing in the cup, and rose up and filled it with a liquid that was of\r\nsimple water; yet very strange to see come that way; but ordinary after\r\na time.\r\n\r\nAnd in this way, as might be seen, had I such food and drink in but a\r\nlittle scrip, that might keep life within me for a great time. Yet was\r\nit a way of discomfort, and lacking to the mouth and to the belly; but a\r\nsufficient thing unto the need of the body, and good matter for a\r\nthankful heart, in that dark and hungry Land.\r\n\r\nNow, when I had eaten, I did go over in their order, those things which\r\nI did carry; for there was, beside the Diskos and that scrip of food, a\r\npouch that did contain matters various. And these, I did look into; and\r\nafterward did take out a small compass that I had been give by the\r\nMaster Monstruwacan, so that I might find of its workings without the\r\nGreat Redoubt; and, he had said unto me, that it might be that I should\r\npass far off into the Night Land, and lose the Mighty Pyramid amid so\r\ngreat a Country and so plentiful a Darkness. Then, perchance, if that\r\nancient principle did still lurk within the machine, though turned no\r\nmore to the North, but unto the Pyramid, then should it guide my feet\r\nHomeward out of the Everlasting Night, and thus have once more that\r\nancient use which, as I do know, is common unto this age.\r\n\r\nAnd this was a very cunning thing to have with me, if but it held\r\nservice to the Earth-Current, and a rare thing, which the Master\r\nMonstruwacan did make with his own hands and much skill and pains, from\r\nan olden one that had place within the Great Museum, and concerning\r\nwhich I have told somewhat, before this place.\r\n\r\nAnd I set the thing upon the ground; but it had no certain way with it;\r\nbut did spin and waver constantly, and this I made to consider, and\r\nremembered that I was yet above that part where, afar in the earth did\r\nspread the greatness of the Underground Fields; and I was, haply, but a\r\nlittle way off from the "Crack"; though a mighty way above.\r\n\r\nAnd it pleasured me to wonder whether the dear Master Monstruwacan did\r\nbehold how that I made test with the compass; for the light was good\r\nfrom the fire-hole; and the Great Spy-Glass had a great strength. Yet,\r\nhad I no certainty; for, as I did know, from much watchings, there was\r\nno surety in the searching of the Land, by the Glass; for there was oft\r\nplainness where you did think surely none should see, and anon a\r\ndullness where might be thought that the sight went gaily. And this may\r\nbe plain to all; for the wavering of the lights from the strange fires\r\nwas not to be accounted to rule; but made a light here, and a darkness\r\nthere, and then did change about, oddly. Moreover, there were smokes and\r\nmists that did come upwards from the earth, in this place and in that;\r\nand had somewhiles a greatness; but oft were small, and did lurk low,\r\nand had no power but to confuse the sight.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, I did put by the compass in my pouch, and made to\r\ncompose myself unto sleep. But here would I now set down how that, in\r\nthe end, after I had gone many days\' journeyings outward from the Mighty\r\nPyramid, I did indeed find it to draw the Northward part of the needle\r\nunto it; and this was a comfort and a pleasure to my spirit; moreover,\r\nif ever I did get back, as I did think, it would be a matter for great\r\ninterest unto the Master Monstruwacan; yet, in verity, were there other\r\nmatters that should hold him more; for he was right human, as all should\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAnd, moreover, concerning this same compass, I did find a fresh thing;\r\nfor, after a yet greater time, as I shall set out in a due place, if I\r\ndo but remember, which doubt is ever my fear to fret me, I came a\r\nmighty way from the Redoubt, and, lo! fearing that I might indeed lose\r\nthat, My Great Home, in the Darkness of the World, I did pull out that\r\nstrange wonder of the needle, that I might have comfort by its homeward\r\npointing. And I did discover a new power in the night; for the machine\r\ndid point no more directwards unto the Great Redoubt; but was a point\r\nunto the Westwards; so that I had knowledge that some Great Power afar\r\nin the Darkness of the World did sway upon it; and I had a childlike\r\nwonder that this might be, in truth, that same Power of the North, of\r\nwhich the books, and my Memory-Dreams did tell. And, indeed, no doubt\r\nshould there be upon this matter; yet who might not have doubt in that\r\ntime, that they should perceive after an eternity, that ancient\r\nNorthward Force swaying that small servant unto an olden obedience. And\r\nit was, as it were, a revealing unto me, how that to know within the\r\nbrain is one matter; but to have knowledge within the heart is another;\r\nfor I had always known concerning this Northward Force; but yet had not\r\nknown with the true meaning of Knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnd yet one other matter there was to cause doubt, at that moment of\r\nthis new knowing; for it came to me that maybe the power of that Lesser\r\nRedoubt did begin to act upon the machine, even as the Earth-Current of\r\nthe Great Pyramid did hold yet a strong drawing upon the needle; and\r\nwere this so, then did I not surely begin to stand anigh unto my\r\nJourney\'s end; for that less power of the Lesser Redoubt could have no\r\nimpudence to pull, save that I had come to a closeness with it.\r\n\r\nYet, in truth, as I do now have knowledge, it was the North that drew;\r\nand I do seem to make a great telling about this little matter; but how\r\nelse shall I show to you mine inward mind, and the lack of knowledge and\r\nlikewise the peculiar knowings that did go to the making of that time,\r\nand the Peoples thereof, which is but to say the same thing twice over.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as I did say, I made to compose myself for sleep; and to this\r\nend, I took a cloak-matter which did cross my shoulder and hip, and\r\nwrapt it about me, and lay down there in the darkness of the Night, by\r\nthat strange fire-hole.\r\n\r\nAnd I lay the Diskos beside me, within the cloak; for it was, indeed, my\r\ncompanion and friend in bitter need; so that I had pleasure to feel the\r\nstrange thing anigh to me. And as I did lie there, in those moments that\r\ndo drowse the Soul, as it were that they do proceed as breath out of the\r\nmouth of Sleep, I had a half-knowing that the aether did surge about me;\r\nand I doubt not but that there had watched my every doing, many of the\r\nMillions, and had been humanly stirred, at my commending of my spirit\r\nunto sleep; and thus did shake the aether of the world about me, with\r\ntheir unity of sympathy.\r\n\r\nAnd, mayhaps, I had some little knowing of this thing, as I did pass,\r\ndrowsy, into slumber; and it is surely like that I slept the better for\r\nit. Moreover, I was wondrous tired and worn, and thus did sleep very\r\nstrong and heavy; yet I mind me that my last dim thinkings were upon\r\nthat sweet maid I did go to find. And in slumber did I have speech with\r\nher in dreams, and a strange happiness about me, and all seeming to be\r\ntouched by fairy-light, and freed from the sorrow of life.\r\n\r\nAnd it was from a sweet and lovely sleeping, such as this, that I was\r\nwaked suddenly by a great and mighty sound; and I came instant to a\r\npossessing of my senses; and I knew that the mighty Voice of the\r\nHome-Call did go howling across the Night. And, swift and silent, I slid\r\nthe cloak from about me, and took the haft of that wondrous Diskos into\r\nmine hand.\r\n\r\nAnd I did look towards the Pyramid, quickly, for a message; for I had a\r\nsure knowledge that there had a great Need arisen, and that some Terror\r\ncame towards me out of the Dark; else they had never waked all the Night\r\nLand to a knowing that an human was abroad out of the Mighty Refuge.\r\n\r\nAnd even as I did peer towards the Great Redoubt, I could not abide to\r\nkeep my gaze entire that way; but did take a large and fearful look all\r\nabout me; yet could make to see nothing; and so did stare, eager and\r\nanxious, afar into the upper blackness of the Night, where did shine\r\nthat Final Light of the Tower of Observation; and the same while\r\ncrouched, and holding the Diskos, and making to glance across my\r\nshoulders, and to watch for the message, and all in the same moment.\r\n\r\nAnd then, afar upwards in the prodigious height, I did see the great,\r\nand bright and quick darting flashes of a strange green fire, and did\r\nknow that they spelled to me in the Set-Speech a swift warning that a\r\ngrey monster, that was a Great Grey Man, had made scent of me in the\r\ndark, and was even in that moment of time, crawling towards me through\r\nthe low moss-bushes that lay off beyond the fire-hole to my back. And\r\nthe message was sharp; and bade me to leap into the bushes unto my left;\r\nand to hide there; so that I might chance to take the thing to an\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nAnd, as may be thought, they had scarce flashed the tale unto me; but I\r\nwas gone in among the shadows of a clump of the moss-bush that did grow\r\nanigh; and I sweat with a strange terror, and a cold and excited shaking\r\nof the heart; yet was my spirit set strong to conquer.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as I did crouch there, hidden, I saw something come very quiet\r\nout of the bushes that did grow beyond the fire-hole; and it was great,\r\nand crept, and was noways coloured but by greyness in all its parts. And\r\nthe glare from the fire-hole did seem to trouble it; so that it looked,\r\nlaying its head to the ground, and spying along the earth, in a strange\r\nand Brutish fashion; that it might oversee the glare of the fire-hole.\r\nYet, I doubt that it saw beyond the fire with plainness; for, in a\r\nmoment, it crept swift in among the bushes again, and came out towards\r\nthe edge of the fire-hole in another place; and this it did thrice unto\r\nmy left, and thrice unto my right; and every time did lay its head to\r\nthe earth, and spy along; and did hunch its shoulders, and thrust\r\nforward the jaw horridly and turn the neck, as a very nasty beast might\r\ngo, wanton.\r\n\r\nNow, as you may think, this manner of the Beast-Man did shake my courage\r\nmightily; for I did think each time that it did go inward among the\r\nmoss-bushes, that it had made discovery of me, and would make to take me\r\nin the back, from out of the dark of the bushes; and this was an\r\nuncomfortable thing to consider, as others might think also, had any\r\nbeen there in the bush with me. And then, in truth, did that same swift\r\nsense of mine Hearing, prove helpful to my saving; for, behold, the\r\nthing did go back into the moss-bushes, after that last coming out; and\r\ndid seem to make as it had made a failing to discover me, and had no\r\nfurther intent, save to return unto the Night; and I had this thought\r\ntruly in mine heart, and for maybe a minute; and then, lo! within my\r\nsoul a voice did speak plain, and did warn me that the thing did make a\r\ngreat compass among the moss-bushes about the fire-hole, having made\r\ndiscovery of me; and it did go warily to take me in the back, from the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nNow, when I heard this voice speak within my spirit, I had knowledge\r\nthat the dear Master Monstruwacan made watch from the Tower of\r\nObservation, and did send the speech with his brain-elements, having in\r\nmind that I had the Night-Hearing. And I trusted the speech; for in the\r\nsame moment of time there did beat all about me in the Night the solemn\r\nthrob of the Master-Word, as that it had been added with speed, to give\r\ninstant assurance. And I leapt quick from that clump of the moss-bush,\r\nunto another, and crouched, and made a watch all about me; and kept the\r\nears of my spirit open, knowing that the Master Monstruwacan did also\r\nwatch all, for me.\r\n\r\nAnd, suddenly, I saw a little moving of a bush that grew to the back of\r\nthose bushes in which I had been hid; and there came out of the bush\r\nthat moved, a great grey hand, and moved the moss of the clump where I\r\nhad been, as it were that something peered out of the moving bush. And\r\nthere followed the great grey head of the Grey Man, and the head went\r\ninto the clump of the moss-bush where I had been.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew that I must strike now; and I leapt, and smote with the\r\nDiskos; and the thing fell upon its side, and the great grey legs came\r\nout of the hither bushes, and twitched and drew upwards; but the head\r\nremained in the bush where I had been hid. And I stood away from the\r\nthing whilst it died; and in mine hand the Diskos did spin and send\r\nforth fire; as it were that it did live, and did know that it had slain\r\na great and horrid monster.\r\n\r\nAnd presently the Grey Man was dead; and I went away from those bushes,\r\nunto the far side of the fire-hole. And I stood with the Diskos held\r\nhigh and spinning and sending out fire, that they within the Mighty\r\nPyramid might know that I had slain the Beast-Man; for it might be that\r\nit lay too much in the shadow for them to look upon.\r\n\r\nBut the Master Monstruwacan spoke not again to me; for, indeed, it was\r\nnot meet to do so, except it might save me from a sure danger; for, as\r\nyou may know from my past tellings, there were Powers of the Night Land\r\nthat did hearken unto such matters; and it was like enough that there\r\nhad been overmuch done, even thus, for my further safety. Yet the thing\r\ncould not be helped.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I was a little calmed, and eased from my fear, I could know\r\nthat all that the aether of the night was disturbed by the gladness of\r\nthe millions within the Great Redoubt; so that it was plain how great a\r\nmultitude had given note unto the fight; and their hearts to beat in\r\nsweet sympathy and natural fear; so that I did feel companied and\r\nbefriended; though, as it may be thought, something shaken yet about the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nNow, in a little time, I did gather unto me my wits and had myself to\r\norder; and I looked to see how the hours did go, and I found that I had\r\nsurely slumbered through ten hours. And I reproached myself; for,\r\nindeed, I had slept oversound by reason of my having lacked a regular\r\nway and time, as I had with a proper wisdom made to be my rule. And I\r\nresolved that I would obey the wit of my Reason in all the future time,\r\nand make to eat and rest in due season, as you will wot that I did\r\nbefore intend.\r\n\r\nThen, with a self-reproachful heart, I went around the small fire-hole,\r\nand caught up my cloak and other matters. And I turned me towards the\r\nMighty Pyramid, and did look once upwards along all the great slope,\r\nwhere it did go measureless into the far blackness of the Everlasting\r\nNight; and I made no salutation; for I had so resolved, as you will\r\nknow; moreover, I desired not to call forth any unneedful disturbance of\r\nthe aether of the world, which indeed must be, did I make to stir the\r\nemotions of the Millions.\r\n\r\nAnd I turned me then away, and went off into the night, going swift and\r\ncautious, and bearing the Diskos cunningly and almost, as it were, with\r\na love for that strange and wondrous weapon that had so befriended me,\r\nand slain the foul Grey Man with one stroke. And I had feeling that it\r\ndid know me, and had a comradeship for me; and I doubt none will\r\nunderstand this; save, it might be, they of the olden days that did\r\ncarry one strong sword always. Yet was the Diskos more than the sword;\r\nfor it did in truth seem to live with the fire and the flame of the\r\nEarth-Current that did beat within it.\r\n\r\nAnd it was well acknowledged within the Great Redoubt, that none might\r\ntouch the Diskos of another; for that the thing went crustily, as it\r\nmight be said, in the hands of a stranger; and if any made foolishness\r\nof this knowledge, and did persist much to such an handling, or making\r\nto use, the same would presently act clumsy with the weapon, and come to\r\nan hurt; and this was a sure thing, and had been known maybe an hundred\r\nthousand years; or perchance a greater time.\r\n\r\nAnd by this it doth seem wise to believe that there did grow always an\r\naffinity between the nature of the man--which doth, as ever, include the\r\nwoman--and the Diskos that he did use in his Practice; and because of\r\nthis known thing, and that the place would elsewise be lumbered with\r\nolden weapons of those that did die, it was a Law and Usage that there\r\nwas placed with the Dead, the Diskos of the Dead, there upon The Last\r\nRoad in the Country Of Silence, and was thus made to give back unto the\r\nEarth-Current, the power that did lie in it. And this doth seem to a\r\ncareless thinker, as it were that I told once again those olden customs\r\nof the Ancient Folk; but this is otherwise, and had a sound reason to\r\nit; yet, if you do so believe, I doubt not but that a right human\r\nsentiment was something at the bottom, which is proper; for it is meet\r\nthat Love should mate with Wisdom to mother Comfort in our sorrows; and\r\nit is a warm thing to do aught for our dead; and none may say nay to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nNow, as I did go onwards into the Night Land, looking ever to this\r\nshadow and to that, it may be conceived how my heart would stir with\r\nswift fear, at this and that; and that my body would oft quiver to leap\r\naside; and as swift discover that naught assailed.\r\n\r\nAnd so did I go forward, and always with imaginings and wonders\r\nconcerning what manner of uncouth Being or Brute might come out of the\r\ndarknesses all about. Yet, in all that time, there was a certain\r\nproudness of the heart, that I did come safe out of the power of the\r\nGrey Man, and did surely slay him. But, truly, it were well that the\r\npraise be considered, and not overmuch given unto me; for I had died as\r\nI slept, but that they of the Great Redoubt, had made a watch over me,\r\nand waked me unto my saving.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, as I walked, I grew something faint, and had knowledge\r\nthat I did foolishly; for, indeed, I should have eat after my fight; yet\r\nmay I be forgiven for this forgetting, in that I had been much shaked\r\nand put about.\r\n\r\nAnd I sat me down in a little clear place among the bushes, and did eat\r\nthree of the tablets, and did once more shake forth the dust that did\r\nturn in the air to a natural water by a proper and natural chemistry of\r\nthese matters. And after I had eat, I sat a little while, and did think,\r\nand did look upwards at the great slope of the Pyramid in the night; and\r\nall the time did I listen with mine ears and with my spirit; and kept\r\nthe Diskos across my knees, and looked this way and that, very frequent;\r\nbut nothing came anigh.\r\n\r\nAnd so I rose presently, and went onwards, and walked for six hours\r\ntowards the North and the West. And I made much to the West, for a\r\nlittle, that I might come clear of the North-West Watcher. Yet, after a\r\nspace, I made to do foolishly; for I changed my mind about, and kept\r\nsomething more towards the North, so that I should have a surer sight of\r\nthat Monster.\r\n\r\nAnd this was, in truth, a rash and naughty thing to consider; for if I\r\nwere but seen, then should that grim Brute make a signal unto the Evil\r\nPowers, and I be met swiftly with destruction. But surely the heart is a\r\nstrange and wayward thing, and given to quick fears, and immediately\r\nunto great and uncountable rashnesses. And so I did go forward unwisely\r\nto the Northward of a safe and proper going; and it may be that an\r\ninfluence was upon me, and drew me thatwards; but who shall say.\r\n\r\nNow, a great time I walked, and made a halt upon every sixth hour, and\r\ndid eat and drink, and look a little unto the monstrous towering of the\r\nGreat Redoubt; and afterwards make strong mine heart, and go forward\r\nagain. And always I did go warily, and chiefly among the low moss-bush;\r\nbut sometimes out upon stony ground, and oft across places where sulphur\r\ndid puff somewhat from the ground in a low smoke, very strong in the\r\nnostrils and not liked inwardly.\r\n\r\nAnd as I made onwards, I looked always to my right and to my left, and\r\nanon to the rear; yet made a constant observation of the Mighty Watcher,\r\nthat I did begin to draw nigh unto. And oft did I stoop to crawl, and my\r\nhands did bleed somewhat; but after I was troubled so, I put on the\r\ngreat gloves that made complete the grey armour, and so was shod proper\r\nto such journeying.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, when eighteen hours did have passed since that my sudden\r\nawakening to the peril of the Grey Man, I did search about for a place\r\nto slumber; for I would keep wisely unto my ruling, and go not over long\r\nlacking of sleep; and by this planning I should be the less like to\r\nsleep oversound, and so should set my spirit to listen whilst I did\r\nsleep; and by so much as my spirit should serve me with faith, should I\r\nhave safety. And this thing is plain, and wants not more to the saying\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nAnd I came presently unto a sudden place where the land did go downwards\r\nbrokenly, as that it had been burst a great while gone by the inward\r\nfires; and I looked downwards over the edge of that place, and went\r\nround about it, and did see presently a ledge upon the far side, that\r\nwas difficult to come upon; yet a place of some little safety to any\r\nthat might go down to it; for it was awkward to see, and did any monster\r\nseek to come at me, I should have chance of warning; and might go\r\ndownwards a greater way in time to my salvation.\r\n\r\nAnd by this determination, I abode; and came down to that place with\r\nlabour; but was cheerful of heart that I had found so sure a shelter.\r\nAnd I eat my three tablets, and drank the water that I did get from the\r\npowder. And so made to compose my body to sleep. Yet, at this time, a\r\nthought did come to me, and I made calculation afresh; and laughed\r\nsomewhat at that my poor counting; for, indeed, I had thought to eat but\r\nthrice in the twenty and four hours; yet by my arranging, I was made,\r\nindeed, to eat four times, as you shall see immediately by a little\r\nthought. And this thing came more strong upon my spirit than any might\r\nthink; for I did eat overmuch for the lasting of the food; though, in\r\nverity, it was but little to my belly; as you must all think, and have\r\nsympathy for my discomfort.\r\n\r\nAnd I considered a little, and had determined that I should afterwards\r\nin my journeying, eat but two of the tablets to my meal; and this was a\r\nwise thought, and like much wisdom, a discomposing thing. But so it was,\r\nand I set it down that you may know the arranging of my ways at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNow, in all this while of meditation, I had been setting my cloak about\r\nme, and was fast set to my sleeping; for I had walked a weary way. And I\r\nlay me down upon my left side, with my back to the rock, which did\r\noverhang me something above; so that I was contented to feel hid from\r\nthings that might pass by in the Night. And I had the cloak about me,\r\nand the Diskos close against my breast, within the cloak, and my head\r\nupon my pouch and upon my scrip.\r\n\r\nAnd as I lay thus a moment easeful, I could see that so mighty was the\r\nuprising of the Great Pyramid that it was not hid from me even thus, but\r\ndid stand upward into the night, and did shine, and was plain to be seen\r\nabove the further edge of that deep place where I did lie.\r\n\r\nAnd I fell upon sleep, looking upward at that Final Light, where, as\r\nmight be, the Master Monstruwacan did bend the Great Spy-Glass upon my\r\nlonesomeness, as I lay there upon the ledge.\r\n\r\nAnd this was a thought of sweet comfort upon which to slumber; the which\r\nI did; but my spirit lay wakeful within my breast, and did listen\r\nthrough the night; and harked for all evil matters and things that did\r\nmake to come anigh. But also my spirit did whisper unto Naani as I went\r\ninto sleep; and so passed I into dreams.\r\n\r\nNow, it may be thought that I did act with a strange valiance, in that I\r\ncomposed my body so properly to slumber, and with but a little trouble\r\nof the heart concerning the coming of monsters. And in truth this hath\r\nseemed somewhat so to me, thinking since that time; but I do but set the\r\nthing that is truth; and make not to labour to an illusion of truth; and\r\nso must tell much that doth seem improper to the Reality. Yet must all\r\nbear with me, and have understanding of the hardness of setting forth\r\nwith true seeming the honesty of Truth, which, in verity, is better\r\nserved oft times by timely and cunning lies. And so shall you understand\r\nthis matter so well as I.\r\n\r\nAnd presently my spirit waked me there in the half dark of the Night\r\nLand; and I looked swift about me, and upwards, and saw nothing to\r\nfear. Then did I peer at my dial; and made to discover that I had slept\r\nfull over six quiet hours; and by this I knew the reason of mine\r\nawaking; for it was so great impressed upon me by mine inward sense and\r\nbeing. And this you shall understand, someways, who have thought, ere\r\nsleep, to wake to a certain time of the morning; and by understanding\r\nshall you believe and give me all your kind harking and human sympathy.\r\n\r\nAnd I made to have a smartness of going, which is ever hard to the newly\r\nwaked; and I eat two tablets, the while my belly did cry out for an\r\nwholesome and proper filling; but I drank some of the water, and so did\r\nease somewhat of my hunger.\r\n\r\nThen did I wind my cloak to its shape, and put upon me my gear, which\r\nwas the scrip and the pouch, and the Diskos to my hip; and I clomb out\r\nfrom that place of rest. Yet, before I did come rightly up into the\r\nopen, I peered about, and made some surety that no evil Brute was anigh.\r\nAnd then I gat me out, and stood upon my feet, and looked for a little\r\nupwards at the mighty slope of the Great Redoubt, which did seem yet\r\nvery nigh unto me, by reason of it being so monstrous in bigness.\r\n\r\nAnd I wondered whether in that moment the Master Monstruwacan did look\r\ndown upon me, with the Great Spy-Glass. And afterwards I turned away\r\nswiftly, and went on into the Night Land; for it did always make me\r\nshaken with lonesomeness to look upon my Great Home. And so I did go\r\nforward with a strong and uncaring stride; but grew presently to\r\nquietness, and to have back the proper caution of my going. Yet had I\r\nnot gone all foolishly, for I had taken the Diskos from my hip, ere\r\nthis; so that I possessed it handily.\r\n\r\nNow there is one matter which shall seem but a small and natural\r\noccurring unto you; yet was strong upon me in that time; and this thing\r\nwas that I did begin now to see the Night Land from the new outlooking\r\nof my distance from the Mighty Pyramid. And it was as that a man of this\r\nday did go from the earth to travel among the stars, and lo! should he\r\nnot find them to shift upon his vision; so that the Great Bear and this\r\nand that shaping of the star clusterings, should make a new order, as he\r\ndid wander onwards; and so should he find that there was naught that was\r\ntruly fixed, as he did before then think; but all to alter according\r\nunto the place whence the looking! And this thing shall be plain unto\r\nyou, though no thought be put to the matter; for it is of an evident\r\nverity that doth need not argument to expound. And so shall you have\r\nmemory of me, there a-wander among those strange shapings and wonders of\r\nthat grim Land, the which I had never but supposed to seem but as my\r\nmemory did retain them, from the lookings of all my life within the\r\nGreat Redoubt. And so it was; and ever there did this thing and that\r\nopen out to a new view, and the Night Land take to itself a constant new\r\naspect to mine eyes which had never until that time had but the one\r\nfixed vision of the same.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall understand with me how that when, about the fourteenth\r\nhour of that day\'s travel, I did draw very nigh unto the monstrous\r\nWatcher of the North-West, it did seem so utter strange from this fresh\r\naspect that I had been like to think that I did see a new Monster. For,\r\nin truth, when I did come at last to creep to within a mile of it, among\r\nthe low moss-bushes, I was confounded that the mighty chin did come\r\nforward towards the Great Redoubt, even as the upward part of a vast\r\ncliff, which the sea doth make hollow about the bottom; for it did hang\r\nout into the air above the glare of the fire from the Red Pit, as it had\r\nbeen a thing of Rock, all scored and be-weathered, and dull red and\r\nseeming burned and blasted by reason of the bloody shine that beat\r\nupward from the deep of the Red Pit.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way in which I do tell upon it, you shall know that I did\r\nsurely view it something from the side at this immediate time; for, in\r\ntruth, it was then that I did draw the nearer; and, moreover, I was the\r\nmore astonished at this viewing, than I had been to the front; for it\r\nwas so utter strange, and shapen so different from the Brute that did\r\nhang in my memory.\r\n\r\nAnd a great time I did lie there upon my belly; and shaken by a fear of\r\nthe Beast; yet emboldened, as you may conceive, by having come to the\r\nside; and being hopeful in my heart that I was very secure within so\r\ngreat a shadow and the thick sheltering of the moss-bushes.\r\n\r\nAnd surely it was that I did creep more nigh, the while that I did look;\r\nfor presently I had a very plain seeing of the Great Monster; and did\r\nknow where I had gotten to, and thereby did acknowledge unto myself that\r\nthis was an utter foolishness; and like, for all that any might say, to\r\nlead unto destruction. Yet, as all must know, there was the first fear,\r\nand the ceasing of this fear, as I did wot that I was so little a thing\r\nto heed out there in the shadows. And presently a gaining of courage,\r\nand the prick of my Being that did crave to see clear this exceeding\r\nWonder. And so was I come close, more or less, having gone far upon my\r\nhands and knees; yet sometimes to pause; but afterwards on again.\r\n\r\nNow by this nearness, I was the more truly able to perceive how that the\r\nBulk of the Watcher did rise up into the Night, like a Hill; and the\r\ncolour was mostly black, save and indeed where it did face to the red\r\nshine of the Pit; and concerning this I have done telling.\r\n\r\nAnd so did I lie there, and stare a great while, parting a small hole in\r\nthe moss-bushes that I might spy through the same. And the thing was\r\nsquat there, and might have root within the earth, so it did seem to\r\nmine imaginings, as I did stare with a dumb wonder. And there were\r\nmonstrous warts upon the thing, and indents and a mighty ruggedness and\r\nlumpings; as it were that it did be pimpled with great boulders that\r\nwere inbred within that monstrous hide. And where the shine from the\r\nPit of Red Fire did strike upon these, they did stand out into the\r\ndarkness away from the skin, as you of this Age shall see mountains of\r\nthe moon catch a bright fire from the Sun, and show plain upon the night\r\nof the moon.\r\n\r\nNow, as I have set down, I did lie there and look a great while; and it\r\ncame presently to me that there was unease within the Mighty Pyramid,\r\namong the Millions; for I did feel the aether of the world to be\r\ndisturbed by their distress; and so had a knowing that they had a\r\ncunning wareness concerning the place where I did hide among the\r\nmoss-bushes.\r\n\r\nAnd the thrilling in the night did bring a wisdom into my head; for, in\r\nverity, as I have said, this was a foolish matter that I was upon. And I\r\ngat a thought that the Watcher might have an awaredness of the trouble\r\nof the Multitudes; and, indeed, for all that I did know, it had a full\r\nknowledge of all my wandering; though concerning this, I did think\r\notherwise truly in my heart; as is a most human and proper way to make\r\ncomfortable the spirit, where Doubt can have no ease from Reason.\r\n\r\nAnd I made that I would go backwards to a good distance from the\r\nWatcher, and go forward again upon my journeying, if but that I come\r\nsafe from so unwise an adventuring. And as I did begin to return, it was\r\nto me as that all my senses were newly awake; for I had a sudden knowing\r\nthat I was within the atmosphere, should I not call it, of the Monster.\r\n\r\nAnd I gat an abrupt and horrid shaking of the spirit; for I did feel in\r\nverity that my soul had come too anigh; and that the Beast had a sure\r\nknowledge concerning me; yet did make to my destruction with no haste;\r\nbut after that way and fashion that did seem proper unto it.\r\n\r\nAnd this feeling you shall understand the better, maybe, when I do tell\r\nthat it was to me as that the air all about me was full of a quiet and\r\nsteadfast life and keen intelligence that I did believe to come forth\r\nfrom the Watcher on every side; so that I did feel as one already within\r\nthe gaze of some Great and Evil Power.\r\n\r\nYet, though I had a great terror upon me, I made no foolish haste; but\r\ncommanded my soul to courage, and put a guard upon my way of going, and\r\nso made a very quiet journey for maybe two full miles; and afterwards\r\ndid allow myself something more of haste; for I was now grown easier in\r\nmy spirit; and felt apart from the spirit of the Great Watcher.\r\n\r\nAnd after a longer while, I did leave that hill of watchfulness to my\r\nrear; and was gone onward into the night; yet, as may be known, with a\r\nvague unease and trouble to my heart, and a swift and frequent turning\r\nto learn surely that no Evil Thing came after me. For, as you may know,\r\nI could nowise have forgetting, concerning that great quiet Life which\r\ndid seem to be living in all the air around that Mighty Bulk. For it had\r\nbeen all about me in the night, as I have told, and I to feel that I had\r\nbeen surely discovered! And thus shall you know how shaken was my\r\nspirit, in verity.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, at the eighteenth hour of that day\'s travel, I ceased\r\nfrom my journeying, that I might eat and drink; and I did sit a little\r\nwhile, and looked back upon the strange and monstrous thing which I had\r\ncome beyond. And the great humped back and vast shoulders of the\r\nWatching-Thing rose up into the night, black and cumbrous against the\r\nred shine of the Pit. And thus, as you shall think, had that Brute\r\nlooked always unto the Mighty Pyramid, through Eternity, and did cease\r\nnot from watching, and was steadfast and silent and alone; and none did\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nAnd after I had eat, and drunk some of the water, I went onward for a\r\nfull matter of six hours more; being minded to have no sleep until I had\r\nput a great way between me and the Watcher. And in this part of my\r\njourney did I come to The Place Where The Silent Ones Kill, as it was\r\nnamed in the Maps. And I observed a very wondrous caution, and went away\r\nfrom it a little, unto the North, where I did see at a distance the\r\nshinings of fire-holes; the which did promise me warmth through my\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nAnd here you must know that the Place Where The Silent Ones Kill was an\r\nutter bare place, where all did seem of rock, and no bush did seem to\r\ngrow thereon; so that a man might not come to any hiding; though, in\r\ntruth, there might be some hole here or there; yet was none shown in any\r\nmap within the Pyramid; neither did there seem to be any such to me, as\r\nI did creep there among the moss-bushes to the Northward of the Place,\r\nand look constant and fearful towards it; so that I should see quickly\r\nwhether any Silent One did move across all the grey quiet of that rocky\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nAnd concerning this same Place Where The Silent Ones Kill, it were well\r\nto make an explanation how that there was always a little and\r\nfar-spreaded light over all that lonesomeness; and the light was\r\nsomething grey-seeming; as it were that a lichen might grow upon the\r\nrocks, and send out a little uncomfortable glowing, even as certain\r\nmatters do in these times, if you do but know the place and the time to\r\nseek them. Yet was the light exceeding weak, and very cold and dismal,\r\nand did seem truly to show naught with a sureness; so that it did appear\r\nto the eye, if one did look fixedly, that there were shadows that did\r\nmove here or there, as it were of silent beings; and none might know, in\r\ntruth, whether this shaping of the greyness was to the clouding of the\r\nReason, or that the eye did see of Reality. Yet, if one did look with\r\nthe Great Spy-Glass, then might there be some surety and plainness; and\r\nlikewise was it so, if one did have come sufficient anigh to that\r\nuncomfortable Place, even as I then did be. And so you shall conceive\r\nhow that I did slide very quiet from bush unto bush; for I had alway in\r\nall my life had a very dread fear of this place; and oft did I peer out\r\ninto the dim grey light of the lonesome plain unto my left; and would\r\nthink sometimes to perceive the shapes of the Silent Ones stood vague\r\nand watchful; yet, on the instant, to see nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I did go onward, and came presently to a part where the grey\r\nplain did stretch out a bareness into the Night Land to my front; so\r\nthat my way ended, unless I did make a long passing round about.\r\n\r\nAnd I sat there among the moss-bushes, and did consider, and lookt out\r\ncunningly through a spy-hole of the bush in which I did sit. And I\r\nperceived that the part of the plain which did jut bareness into the\r\nLand before me had no greatness of size; but might be passed swiftly in\r\nbut a little running. And this thing should save me a wearisome going\r\nround; so that I made to consider it with a serious mind; and all the\r\ntime did I search the bare greyness before me, and saw presently that it\r\nwas surely empty.\r\n\r\nAnd I made to adventure myself across, running very swift until I had\r\ncome to the far side. And lo! as I did go to rise up out of the bush,\r\nmine eyes were opened, as it were, and I saw that there was something\r\namid the constant greyness; and I fell quickly into the bush; and did\r\nsweat very chill; but yet did haste to look.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw now that there were, in truth, matters that did show vague\r\nupon that part of the plain that was before me. And I did peer very\r\nconstant and anxious, and, behold, I saw that there was facing me, a\r\ngreat line of quiet and lofty figures, shrouded unto their feet; and\r\nthey moved not, neither made they any sound; but stood there amid the\r\ngreyness, and did seem to make an unending watch upon me; so that my\r\nheart went unto weakness, and I did feel that there was no power of the\r\nmoss-bushes to hide me; for, in verity, they that stood so silent were\r\ncertain of the Silent Ones; and I was very nigh to the Place of\r\nDestruction.\r\n\r\nNow, I moved not for a time; but was made stiff by the greatness of my\r\nfear. Yet I was presently aware that the Silent Ones came not towards\r\nme; but stood quiet; as that they did mind not to slay me, if but I did\r\nkeep from that Place.\r\n\r\nAnd there grew therefrom a little courage into mine heart, and I obeyed\r\nmy spirit, and took an hold of my strength and went slowly backward in\r\nthe bushes. And presently I was come a long way off. Yet troubled and\r\ndisturbed, and very strict to my going.\r\n\r\nAnd I made a great circling about that place where the plain of the\r\nSilent Ones did come outward; and so did gain to the North-West; and was\r\nthence something the happier in my heart; and went easily, and oft upon\r\nmy feet; yet making a strong watching to every side.\r\n\r\nAnd so I came at the last to a time when I had walked through\r\nfour-and-twenty weariful hours; and was eager that I should come to a\r\nsafe place for my sleep; yet did lack a happy belief of safety, in that\r\nI had come twice anigh to so grim trouble; and unsure I was that I did\r\nnot be secretly pursued in the night. And this you shall believe to be a\r\nvery desperate feeling; and a plight to make the heart sick, and to long\r\nwith a great longing for the safety of that mine Home. Yet had I put\r\nmyself to the task; and truly I did never cease to the sorrowful\r\nremembering of that utter despair that had sounded to me plain in the\r\nlast calling of mine own love, out of all the mystery of the night. And\r\nbut to think upon this was to grow strong in the spirit; yet to have a\r\nfresh anxiousness that I did the more surely keep my life within me, and\r\nso come to that maid\'s salvation.\r\n\r\nNow, as you shall mind, I had spied the shine of certain fire-holes\r\nsomewhat to the Northward, and had thought to make thereabouts a place\r\nfor my sleep; for, in truth, there was a bitterness of cold in all the\r\nair of night that did surround me; and I was warmed nigh to a slow\r\nhappiness, by thinking upon a fire to lie beside; and small wonder, as\r\nyou shall say.\r\n\r\nAnd I made presently a strong walking unto that place where did glow in\r\nthe night the shine of the fire-holes, as I did well judge them to be;\r\nand so was like to have come over-swiftly upon my death, as you shall\r\npresently see; for, as I came anigh to the first, I perceived that the\r\nlight came upward out of a great hollow among the moss-bushes, and that\r\nthe fire-hole burned somewhere in the deep of the hollow; so that I did\r\nbut look upon the shine thereof.\r\n\r\nYet very eager was I to come to that warmth; and I made more of haste\r\nthan care, as I did hint; and so came very swift to the top of the\r\nhollow; yet was still hidden by the kindness of the moss-bushes.\r\n\r\nAnd as I made to thrust forward out of the bushes, that I might look and\r\ngo downward into the hollow, there rose up to me the sound of a very\r\nlarge voice, and deep and husky. And the voice was a dreadful voice that\r\ndid speak as that it said ordinary things, and in a fashion so monstrous\r\nas that it were that a house did speak, and, in verity, this is a\r\nstrange thing to say; yet shall it have the truth of my feelings and\r\nterror in that moment.\r\n\r\nAnd I drew back swiftly from discovering myself; and was then all feared\r\nto move, or to make to go more backward, lest that I should give\r\nknowledge that I was come anigh. And likewise did I shiver lest that I\r\nwas even then perceived. And so shall you have something of the utter\r\nfear that did shake me. And I abode there, very quiet, and moved not for\r\na very great space; but did sweat and shake; for there was a monstrous\r\nhorridness in the voice that did speak.\r\n\r\nAnd as I crouched there within the moss-bushes, there came again the\r\nlarge voice, and it was answered by a second voice; and thereupon there\r\narose, as it did seem, the speech of Men that must have the bigness of\r\nelephants, and that did have no kindness in all their thoughts; but were\r\nutter monstrous. And the speech was slow, and it rose up out of the\r\nhollow, brutish and hoarse and mighty. And I would that I could make you\r\nto hear it, and that you could but borrow mine ears for a little moment,\r\nand forthwith be shaken with that utter horror and an afraidness, even\r\nas was I.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, there was a very long quiet, and I ceased at last a\r\nlittle from mine over-fear; and later I did calm somewhat; so that I\r\nmade to shift my position, which was grown very uneasy.\r\n\r\nAnd there was still no sound from the hollow. Wherefore, having a little\r\nboldness and much curiousness, and these despite my great fearfulness, I\r\nput forth mine hand, very cautious, and did move the mossbush a little\r\nfrom my face. And I went forward upon the earth, and did lie upon my\r\nbelly; and was by this so close upon the edge of that place, that I was\r\nabled to look downwards.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall know that I peered down into that great hollow, and did\r\nsee a very strange and horrid sight; for, in truth, there was a large\r\nfire-hole in the centre of that place, and all about the sides there\r\nwere great holes into the slopes of the hollow, and there were great men\r\nlaid in the holes, so that I might see a great head that did show out to\r\nmy sight here, from one of those holes, and would seem to be that of a\r\nmonstrous man heavy with sleep. And there I would see but the buttocks\r\nof another, as that he did curl himself inward to his brutish\r\nslumbering. And so was it all about; and to my memory there were maybe a\r\nscore of these holes; yet had I not time to the counting, as you shall\r\nsee. For, after that I had made but a glance, as it were, at these\r\nsleeping and utter monstrous men, I perceived that there sat beyond the\r\nfire-hole, three great men, and they were each greater than elephants,\r\nand covered a large part with a stiff and horrid hair, that did be of a\r\nreddish seeming. And there were upon them great segs and warts, as that\r\ntheir skin had been hides that had never known covering. And there was\r\nbetween them the body of a mighty hound, so big as an horse, that they\r\ndid skin; and I judged that this beast was one of those fearsome brutes\r\nwhich we did call the Night Hounds.\r\n\r\nYet, as I should set down, they did nothing in that time in which I\r\nlookt at them; but did sit each with a sharp and monstrous bloody stone\r\nin his fist, and did look to the ground, as that they heeded not the\r\nearth or the food that they did prepare; but did listen to some outward\r\nsound. And you shall know that this brought to me a very swift and\r\nsudden terror; for I perceived now the why of their long silence; for,\r\nin verity, they had an unease upon them, being subtly aware that one was\r\nanigh, even as are the brute beasts in this manner and kind, as all do\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAnd I made to draw back, and win unto safety, if indeed this thing were\r\nto be done. And as I moved me, it may be that I shook a little earth\r\ninto the hollow; for there was, indeed, a little sifting of dry dust\r\nbelow me, as I did wot, being very keen to hear, by reason of my fright.\r\nAnd immediately did those three monstrous men look upward, and did seem\r\nto me to stare into mine eyes, as I did lie there hid amid the\r\nmoss-bushes. And I was so put in fear that I did clumsily, and sent\r\nanother siftering of dust downward, as I did strive to go backward swift\r\nand quiet from the edge. And all the time I did look through the bushes\r\nvery fixedly into the eyes of the giants; and lo, their eyes did shine\r\nred and green, like to the eyes of animals. And there rose up a roar\r\nfrom them that did nigh slay my soul with the horridness of the noise.\r\nAnd at that roaring, all the giants that did lie in the holes did awake,\r\nand began to come outward into the hollow.\r\n\r\nNow, I was surely lost, and given over to destruction; for they had\r\npossessed me immediately, but that in that moment, as I went backward,\r\nthe earth gave behind me, and I fell into a hole among the moss-bushes\r\nto my back, and I made first to come out very hurried, and all choked\r\nwith a dust of sand and ash; but in a moment I was sane to know that I\r\nhad come to a sudden hiding-place; and I lay very still and strove\r\nneither to cough nor to breathe. And well for me, I came to so close a\r\nhiding; for there were all about me the sounds of monstrous footsteps,\r\nrunning, that seemed to shake the ground; though maybe this to be an\r\nimagining bred of my fear.\r\n\r\nAnd shoutings of great voices there were; and the thudding of huge feet\r\nall about; and the noises of the bushes rustling; but presently the\r\nsearch drew away to the Southward. And I perceived that there had surely\r\nfought for me some power of good fortune. And I came up out of the hole,\r\nvery cautious, and shaken and a moment weak with the beating of my\r\nheart; yet with a lovely thankfulness for my salvation. And I gat me\r\nabout, and went swift through the moss-bushes to the North and West for\r\nthree hours, and ceased not to run upon my hands and knees. And by that\r\ntime was I come a great way, and did have a surety in my heart of\r\npresent safety.\r\n\r\nAnd I ceased to run, and lay quiet; for, in truth, I did near swoon away\r\nwith the hardness of my travel. And indeed as you shall know, I had\r\nslept not for seven-and-twenty hours, and had scarce ceased to labour in\r\nall that time. Moreover, I had eat not, neither drunk, for nine hours;\r\nand so shall you conceive that I was truly a-weary.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently I did slumber there as I lay, and all abroad to any\r\nmonstrous thing that should come along. Yet did I wake unharmed, and\r\nfound by my dial there had gone by a full ten hours, the while that I\r\ndid lie there and sleep unwotting. And I was sore perished with the cold\r\nof the Night; for I had not the warmth of my cloak about me, and my\r\nbelly was very empty.\r\n\r\nAnd I stood me up, and did peer about for any dread matter, but all\r\nseemed proper, and I began to stamp my feet against the earth, as that\r\nI would drive it from me, and this I do say as a whimsy, and I swung\r\nmine arms, as often you shall do in the cold days; and so I was\r\npresently something warmed. And I dismantled my cloak, and wrapped it\r\nabout me, and did feel that the Diskos was safe to my hip.\r\n\r\nThen did I sit me down, and did glow a little with relish, in that I\r\nshould now eat four of the tablets; for, indeed, these were my proper\r\ndue, by reason of my shiftless fasting ere I came so wotless to my\r\nslumbering. And the memory of that eating doth live with me now, so that\r\nI could near to smile; for the eagerness of mine inwards was proper and\r\nhuman; yet were even four tablets but a little matter to so great an\r\nemptyness; and I drank a double portion of the water, that I might make\r\nless the void. And this thing was seemly; for, indeed, there were two\r\nportions due unto me.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had eat and drunk, I did fold the cloak once more to shape\r\nacross my shoulder, as I did carry it; and afterwards I took the Diskos\r\ninto my hand, and went forward again to the North and West.\r\n\r\nYet, as you shall know, I did pause a little in the beginning, and peer\r\nto every side for any close danger; and then did look more abroad of\r\nthat place; but could nowhere see any matter to have me to immediate\r\nfear. And afterwards, I looked a little while at the monstrous humped\r\nback of the Watcher of the North-West; and it did grow to me how\r\nsteadfast that thing did look toward the Mighty Pyramid; and this set me\r\nto new hatred and horror of the Monster, as you shall conceive and\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I looked beyond the Watcher, unto the vast Mountain of\r\nthe Great Redoubt; and I was still seeming close upon it; yet, in truth,\r\ngone a long and weariful distance. But this you shall understand was by\r\nthe greatness and utter height and bulk of that shining Mountain of\r\nLife.\r\n\r\nAnd strange and wonderful it was to me to think that even in that one\r\nmoment, it might be that the dear Master Monstruwacan did look upon my\r\nface, through the Great Spy-Glass. And I should not seem utter far to\r\nhim, by reason of the power of the big Glass. But to me, as I did look\r\nupward through the Night, unto that far and utmost light in the upper\r\nblackness of the everlasting gloom, it did seem doubly to me that I was\r\nafar off and lost forever from mine Home. And this thinking did breed in\r\nme such a great and lonesome feeling, and a weakness of the heart and\r\nspirit, that forthwith I took my courage close unto me, and did turn\r\naway quickly; and went onward to the North and West, as I have told.\r\n\r\nNow I walked for twelve hours, and in that time, did eat and drink\r\ntwice; and made onward again very steadfast, and happy that all did go\r\nso quiet with me; so that it was as if I had at last come to a part of\r\nthe Land that was given over to quietness, and lacking of monsters.\r\nYet, in truth was I come to a worse place than any, maybe; for as I went\r\nforward, striding very strong, and making a good speed, I did hear\r\npresently a little noise upward in the night, and someways unto my left,\r\nthat had seeming as that it were a strange low sound that did come down\r\nto me out of an hidden doorway above; for, indeed, though the sound did\r\ncome from very nigh, as it did seem no more than a score feet above my\r\nhead, yet was it a noise that did come out of a great and mighty\r\ndistance, and out of a Foreign Place. And I did know the Sound; though\r\nnever, as you may suppose, could I have heard it in all my life. Yet had\r\nI read in one of the Records, and again in a second and a third, how\r\nthat certain of all they that had adventured from the Pyramid into the\r\nNight Land to seek for knowledge, had chanced to hear a queer and\r\nimproper noise above them in the Night; and the noise had been strange,\r\nand did come from but a little way upward in the darkness; yet was also\r\nfrom a great and monstrous distance; and did seem to moan and hum\r\nquietly, and to have a different sounding from all noises of earth. And\r\nin the Records it was set forth that these were those same Doorways In\r\nThe Night, which were told of in an ancient and half-doubted Tale of the\r\nWorld, that was much in favour of the children of the Pyramid, and not\r\ndisdained by certain of our wiser men, and had been thus through all the\r\nlatter ages.\r\n\r\nAnd I did seem to know the sound upon the moment; for my heart grew\r\nswift to understand. And it was a very dread uncomfortable sound; and\r\nyou shall know how it did seem, if you will conceive of a strange noise\r\nthat doth happen far away in the Country, and the same noise to seem to\r\ncome to you through an opened door near by. And this is but a poor way\r\nto put it; yet how shall I make the thing more known to you? So that I\r\nmust even trust unto your wit and true sympathy that you shall conceive\r\nof the fullness of my meaning.\r\n\r\nNow, in all the Histories of those that had adventured into the Night\r\nLand, there were but three sure Records that did concern this Sound; and\r\neach did tell of a Great Horror; and of them that did hear the Sound\r\nthere had died the most part, out in the Night Land. And the Records did\r\nmake always that they had come upon Destruction, and not simply unto\r\nDeath; but were destroyed by a strange and Invisible Evil Power from the\r\nNight.\r\n\r\nAnd of those that came alive unto the Pyramid, they had all one strange\r\ntale to tell, how that there were secret and horrid Doorways In The\r\nNight. Yet how this thing could be plain to them, who may know truly;\r\nsave it be that the eyes of their spirits did behold that which was hid\r\nto the eyes of the flesh.\r\n\r\nAnd there was afterwards writ a proper and careful treatise, and did set\r\nout that there did be ruptures of the Aether, the which did constitute\r\ndoorways, as those more fanciful ones did name them; and through these\r\nshatterings, which might be likened unto openings--there being no better\r\nword to their naming--there did come into this Particular Condition Of\r\nLife, those Monstrous Forces Of Evil, that did dominate the Night, and\r\nwhich many did hold surely to have been given this improper entrance\r\nthrough the foolish and unwise wisdom of those olden men of learning,\r\nthat did meddle overfar with matters that did reach in the end beyond\r\ntheir understanding. And this thing have I told before, and it doth seem\r\nproper unto my belief; for it is always thus, and I have that same taint\r\nwithin me, as must all that have the zest of life.\r\n\r\nNow, by this that I have set down swiftly, to make a little clear the\r\nsure horridness of this Sound, you shall know, even with me, the great\r\nhorror that did come immediately upon my Spirit; and I did know that my\r\nSearch was surely like to have an end in that moment; and I bared mine\r\narm, for my teeth, where the Capsule did lie below the skin; and so was\r\nready to an instant Death, if that Destruction did come upon me. And in\r\nthe same moment, I did fall silent, inward among the moss-bushes, and\r\ndid begin to creep very quiet toward the right; for, as you will mind, I\r\nhad heard the Sound over beyond my left. And all that time, as I did\r\ncreep, there was a great sickness upon me, and it did seem that my mouth\r\nhad weakened unto water; so that I could scarce hold my teeth tightly\r\nfrom unseemly clitterings.\r\n\r\nAnd I crept always very silent, and did often stare quick and painful\r\nover my shoulder, upwards, and this way and that; but did never see\r\nanything; neither could I hear now the Sound.\r\n\r\nAnd I went thiswise for a great hour, and was like to faint through the\r\neffort of my care and the soreness of my going. But upon the end of that\r\nlong while, I grew something easier in the Spirit, and did perceive that\r\nI was saved from the Destruction that I had come so dreadful anigh. And\r\nthis thing, it may be, was because that I did chance to hear it, whilst\r\nyet it was beyond, and before I did come right unto it, to pass below.\r\nYet may I be wrong in this thought, and do but make a guessing. But, as\r\nI shall here explain; after that time, I kept mine ears newly keen unto\r\nhearing; and did chide my Spirit, for that it had not taken account of\r\nthat Sound a great while earlier. Yet, as I did presently conceive, the\r\nspirit had no power to hear that thing; which was very strange; but\r\ntruly so.\r\n\r\nNow, because that I went with a very wary hearing, I heard the Sound\r\nonce a far way off before me, and I hid upon the moment, and went\r\nbackward, and after a while, did judge myself to have come unto safety;\r\nand so it was, in verity, for I heard no more that time. And so did I\r\ncome presently unto the eighteenth hour, and did eat and drink, and made\r\nme a place of slumber in a little hollow of a rock that stood upward out\r\nof the moss-bushes. And I slept for six hours, and afterwards waked,\r\nand was come to no harm.\r\n\r\nAnd after I had eat and drunk again, I did look outward over the Night\r\nLand, and with particularness to that part that I did travel in, as it\r\nmight be called, the yesterday. And I did observe it to be a very bleak\r\nand desolate Country, and not given over to fire, or other warmth, nor\r\nto sulphur-vapours; but to be very quiet, and with but a little light in\r\nall its breadth. And I could conceive that it was no place for anything\r\nof life to desire; but rather to avoid; and that Country did seem to be\r\nyet all about me; for I was by no means come clear from it at that time;\r\nthough, Northward, there was a glimmer, as of fire-holes; and beyond\r\nthose, the strange shining of the Plain of Blue Fire. And, after that I\r\nhad thought awhile, I did believe that I should meet no Monster of\r\nNatural Life in all that Country of Desolation, until I did draw nigh,\r\nonce more unto fire. And I conceived that this Sound from out of the\r\ninvisible Doorways might yet trouble me; but whether the quietness of\r\nthat part was because all of natural life did fear the Sound, or because\r\nthat there was neither fire nor warmth, I do not say, having no knowing\r\nin this matter; but may yet believe that it was to be laid to both\r\ncauses; and this doth seem of common reason, as you shall agree.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had looked a while unto the Mighty Pyramid, which was now\r\ntruly a great way off; for I had walked so many weary hours; I turned me\r\nonce more to my journeying. And here let me observe that I had gone very\r\nfar; yet not so distant, as might be thought; for, oft, I did go less\r\nthan one mile in an hour or maybe two hours, having to be of great\r\ncaution, and oft to hide, and to go upon my belly, or to crawl, all as\r\nmight be. And, further, as you may have perceived, I made not a straight\r\nforwardness; but did strike this way and that way, being very intent to\r\nescape the Monsters and Evil Forces that were all about.\r\n\r\nNow, because that I believed that I travelled in a Place where was\r\nsurely to be discovered those strange Doorways within the Night, I made\r\nan especial care of my going; and did stop oft that I might listen, and\r\nwatch, and keep a very strict ward in all the Night about me. Yet, as\r\nyou shall see, this served not to prevent me from going forward into the\r\nfearfulness of that which did haunt all the void; for, sudden, as I went\r\ncarefully, I heard a faint humming noise come downward from the night a\r\nlittle unto my rear; and the humming noise did grow more plain, as that\r\na door were opened slowly above, and did let out that Sound ever more\r\nloud. And surely, after I did hear that, I could not doubt that a door\r\nwere opened upward there; for the noise did grow in such wise as you\r\nshall hear a distant sound come through, when a door truly is oped; for,\r\nif the noise had been made just in that place, it had seemed to come\r\nfrom there; but this Sound, though it did come _through_ there, was as\r\nthat it did come outward from some far lost and foreign Eternity. And\r\nthis I do struggle always to make plain; and you shall not blame me that\r\nI think overmuch upon it; for, in truth there was an horror so wondrous\r\nand drear about it, that I can forget not; but do strive always that\r\nothers should know with me that peculiar woe and terror that did haunt\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nNow, as you will see, I had in truth gone past the place where the\r\nDoorway in the Night did open; yet had come to no harm; but rather it\r\ndid seem that it opened by chance, unwotting that I was anigh; or it may\r\nbe that my quiet passing did disturb an Evil Power, so that it did even\r\ncome to listen, or to make search. And all this doth pass through my\r\nbrain, as I do write, and it doth seem to me that my thoughts are but\r\nthe thoughts of a little child, before so great a mystery; and that I\r\ntouch not even the edge and fringe of the truth with my thinkings, and\r\nso do cease upon them; and will but go forward so plain as I may with my\r\ntelling. Now, as you may truly believe, when I heard that Sound, and did\r\nunderstand that I had, in verity, come past beneath that Place, I did\r\nsurely sicken to an utter weakness of body and heart, though it was but\r\nfor a moment; and then was I swift hid within the close shelter of the\r\nlow and thick moss-bushes.\r\n\r\nAnd I shook in all my being, and crept, shaking, upon my hands and\r\nknees, and did near totter to my face thrice, so weak gone was I in that\r\nmoment of terror; and I did have a wickedness of forgetting in that\r\ntime; for I bared not mine arm, to have the Capsule to a readiness for\r\nmy death, if that did need to be; and this was an abominable\r\nfoolishness, and I do shake now when I think upon it; for Death is but a\r\nlittle matter by the side of Destruction; though, in truth, dreadful\r\nenough for all. Yet, as it did chance, no harm came to me, and I gat\r\naway, as that some wondrous power did cast a viewless cloak about me,\r\nthat I might be utter hid; and oft have I wondered whether this was\r\ntruly so; but have no knowing.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, I ceased from fleeing, and had some calmness, and did\r\neat and drink; and so came to the comfort of a firm spirit, the which\r\nhad been sore troubled, above all understanded causes, by that horrid\r\nsounding upward in the Night. And after that I had eat and drunk, I did\r\nrest a little; but afterward, went onward to the Northward, going\r\ntowards that place where the fire-holes did glimmer, the same being by\r\nthis time no great way off.\r\n\r\nThen, as I did come anigh, I thought to hear once again the Sound in the\r\nnight, and I stopt very swift, and hid into the moss-bushes, and did\r\nlisten; but did hear naught; and so was hopeful that fancy did play upon\r\nme. Yet, because of this matter, I went upon my hands and knees for a\r\ngood way; and so came at last nigh unto the shine of one of those\r\nfire-holes, the which I did see for so long.\r\n\r\nNow, as you shall suppose, I went very cautious through the bushes, unto\r\nthat red-shining fire; being careful, both that I did attract not any\r\nEvil Force that might listen in the Night, and because that there might\r\nbe some Monster nigh to the fire-hole. But, presently, when I was come\r\nso that I could peer through the bushes, I did see a little fire-hole\r\nset in a small hollow, and there did no thing seem to lurk anigh; and\r\nthe sight of that warmth did cheer me; for it was long since I did have\r\nthe comfort of such a matter.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had lain hid awhile, that I might watch all about, I saw the\r\nplace to be safe and quiet; and I went out from the moss-bushes, and sat\r\ndown a space from the fire, which did fill the pit in which it did lift\r\nand bubble. And the noise that it sent out was strange and slow, and it\r\ndid seem to gruntle gently unto itself in that lonesome hollow, as that\r\nit had made a long and quiet grumbling there, through Eternity. And oft\r\nwas it still, and made no sound; and again would give an odd bubbling in\r\nthe quietness, and send off, as it did seem, a little smoke of sulphur,\r\nand afterward fall once more upon a quiet.\r\n\r\nAnd so I did sit there very hushed and restful, and the loneliness did\r\nlie all about me, and the red shine of the fire-hole did glow soft in\r\nthe hollow; and I was glad to be quiet, for my heart was weary.\r\n\r\nAnd there was to my back a little rock that did jut upward so high as a\r\nman; and the rock was warm and pleasant to lean upon, and moreover did\r\nseem to guard me from behind. And there I ate and drunk, and kept very\r\nstill; and so was presently rested. And this I did need, as you have\r\nperceived; for I was gone sudden weary of the heart, as I did say; and\r\nthis might be because that I did never cease to have Destruction over me\r\nto companion my way, though as you will mind, I had been no more than\r\ntwelve hours afoot, since my last sleeping. Yet I doubt not you do\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nAnd presently my heart grew strong again within me, and I had a warmth\r\nin my Spirit; and I got up from the earth, and stretched out mine arms;\r\nand I saw that my gear was safe upon me, and afterward did grip the\r\nDiskos, as it were newly.\r\n\r\nThen I went away from the fire-hole, and climbed the far slope of the\r\nhollow, and went Northward. And there were before me many of the\r\nfire-holes; for I did perceive them to shine in the Night for a great\r\nway; as it did seem that they were a path of red shinings that led me\r\nonward to the North-West of the light of the Plain of Blue Fire.\r\n\r\nNow, I had a believing that I had come out of the Country where did lurk\r\nthose horrid Doorways in the Night; and I went not with so utter a\r\nweight upon my heart; and did feel that naught should come now upon the\r\nback of my neck, which had been an odd and troublesome fancy whilst that\r\nI did creep through that Country of Gloom. Yet, as you shall know, I\r\nwent with no foolish confidence; but with a great caution, and mine\r\nhearing keen to hark, and a care to my steps, and did ever watch around\r\nme as I journeyed.\r\n\r\nAnd because that I went forward in this proper and sedate manner, I had\r\ngreat cause for a thankful heart, as you may perceive; for I had come\r\nafter a long way to another of those hollows where did burn one of the\r\nfire-holes; and I made a pause upon the edge of the hollow in which it\r\ndid lie, and looked downward, keeping guarded within the moss-bushes,\r\nwhere they grew anigh to the top thereof. But there was no living thing\r\nthere to be seen, and I went downward, so that I should warm my body at\r\nthe fire. And lo! as I stood upon this side of the fire-hole, and turned\r\nmyself about, I looked presently more keenly to the other side; for the\r\nyellowness of the earth did seem a little strange in one place. But I\r\ncould see with no plainness, because that there arose a glare from the\r\nfire against mine eyes; and I went round, that I should look the better;\r\nyet with no fear or thought of Evil in my heart. And, truly! when I was\r\ncome upon that far side of the fire-hole, lo! there was spread out in\r\nthe yellow sand of that place, a Curious Thing; and I went more nigh,\r\nand stooped to look upon it; and behold it moved, and the sand all about\r\ndid move for a great space; so that I gave back very swift, and swung\r\nupward with the Diskos.\r\n\r\nAnd, strangely, I heard the sand to stir at my back, and I looked round\r\nvery quick, and the sand rose upward in parts, and sifted back, and\r\nthere came to my sight odd things that did move and curl about.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately, before I knew which way to go, I knew that the sand did\r\nshift under my feet, and did work and heave, so that I was tottered, and\r\nwas shaken also in the heart; for I knew not what to think in that\r\ninstant. Then did I perceive that I was all surrounded, and I ran swift\r\nupon the heaving sand, unto the edge of the fire-hole, and I turned\r\nthere, and looked quickly; for I did not know what this new Terror\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw that a Yellow Thing did hump upward from out of the sand, as\r\nit had been a low hillock that did live, and the sand shed downward from\r\nit, and it did gather to itself strange and horrid arms from the sand\r\nall about it. And it stretched two of the arms unto me; but I smote with\r\nthe Diskos, and I smote thrice; and afterward they did wriggle upon the\r\nsand. But this was not the end, as I did hope; for the Yellow Thing\r\narose, and ran at me, as it might be that you should see a spider run.\r\nAnd I did leap backward, this way and that; but the monster had a great\r\nswiftness; so that I did seem surely lost.\r\n\r\nThen made I a strong and instant resolve; for I perceived that I had no\r\nhope to slay this thing; save that I should come at it in the body. And\r\nI put everything to the chance, and made not to escape any more; but ran\r\nstraight in among the legs; and there were great hairs like to spines\r\nupon the legs, and these had pricked me to the death, but that the\r\narmour saved me.\r\n\r\nNow, I had done this thing with a wondrous quickness; so that I was\r\nunder the mighty arching of the legs before the Yellow Thing did wot of\r\nmy intent. And the body was bristled with the great hairs, and poison\r\ndid seem to come from them, and to ooze from them strangely in great and\r\nshining drops. And the Monster heaved itself up to one side, that it\r\nmight bring certain of the legs inward to grasp me; yet in that moment\r\ndid I smite utter fierce with the Diskos--thrusting. And the Diskos did\r\nspin, and hum, and roar, and sent out a wondrous blaze of flame, as that\r\nit had been a devouring Death; and it sundered the body of the Yellow\r\nThing, and did seem as that it screamed to rage amid the entrails\r\nthereof; so wondrous was the fury and energy of that trusted Weapon.\r\n\r\nAnd I was covered with the muck of the thing; and the claws upon the\r\nlegs seized me, so that the grey armour did bend and crack to the might\r\nthereof, and I grew sick unto death with the pain within; but smote with\r\nthe shining Diskos, using my left hand weakly; for my right was gript\r\ndreadful fast to my body. And lo! I was sudden free, and a great blow\r\ndid knock me far across the hollow, so that I was like to have fallen\r\ninto the fire-hole; but fell instead upon the edge, and came backward\r\nunto safety.\r\n\r\nAnd I turned me about, and the Yellow Thing did throw the sand all ways,\r\nas it did die; but had lost power to come upon me. And for my part, I\r\nlay weak upon the earth, and was no more able to fight; nor could I do\r\nmore than breathe for a great while; but yet came presently to health,\r\nand made to examine my hurts.\r\n\r\nThen I saw there was no great wound anywhere upon me; but only an utter\r\nbruising; and I found upon my right leg that there was a sharp and hairy\r\nclaw clipt about it; but the armour had saved me from harm of the horrid\r\nthing; so that I did but kick it free with my left foot, and thence into\r\nthe fire-hole.\r\n\r\nNow, by this time, that Monstrous Creature was dead; but I held off from\r\nit, and went upon the other side of the fire; for I was yet surely in\r\nhorror of it. And I sat for a time, and did think upon all matters that\r\ndid concern me; and I saw that I should have not comfort of heart, until\r\nI was washed clean from the taint of the Monster.\r\n\r\nAnd I gat me up wearily to go forth into the Night again, that I should\r\nmake a search for a hot spring, of which I had come past many. And I had\r\noft found them to be nigh unto the fire-holes; so that I was trustful\r\nthat I should see one ere long. And lo! there was a little hollow just\r\nbeyond, and scarce a hundred paces off; and in the hollow, there did\r\nshine three small fire-holes, and there was a steaming puddle, as did\r\nseem, beyond the third of the holes.\r\n\r\nNow, before I adventured downward into this place, I went all about the\r\ntopmost edge, and made a search of the moss-bushes about; but found\r\nnaught that should scare me. And afterward, I went all across the\r\nhollow; but did find no monstrous thing hid anywheres. Yet, there was\r\nthat in the place that discouraged me, and did keep me from stripping\r\nmine armour, so that I should bathe in the hot puddle; for I stept upon\r\na small serpent, and the same did lap about my leg; but could do me no\r\nhurt, for the armour, which was a very blessed protection. And I freed\r\nmyself from it with the handle of the Diskos.\r\n\r\nAnd because that I could not go naked to my cleansing, I tried first the\r\nhotness of the water, which was not over great, and afterward did take\r\noff the scrip and the pouch, and the cloak, and laid them with the\r\nDiskos upon the edge of the warm puddle.\r\n\r\nThen I stept into the water, and was immediately gone downward a great\r\nway; for, truly it was no puddle as I had supposed; but a deep well, as\r\nyou might call it, of hot and sulphury water. And this doth show how a\r\nman may act foolishly, even when he doth believe that he hath a great\r\ncaution; and surely it is borne in upon me afresh that none should trust\r\nover freely unto unproven matters, the which shall you heartily agree\r\nwith; but yet do as foolishly, according to your lights and characters.\r\nAnd so shall you laugh not over hardly upon me.\r\n\r\nNow I had gone over the head, and, surely I do not know what deepness\r\nwas there. Yet, as you shall think, I stayed not to consider upon this\r\nmatter; but made to climb out, and much shaken with my splutterings and\r\nthe smartings of mine eyes; for, truly, the water was strong with\r\nsulphur matters. Yet, very cleansing was it, as I did presently see; for\r\nthere was no more any taint or horridness upon mine armour, or the flesh\r\nof my face or hands. And I took the Diskos, and washed it clean, also;\r\nand then the cloak, and afterward the scrip and the pouch, and the bands\r\nof the same.\r\n\r\nAnd after I had done this, I was minded to dry myself by the little\r\nfire-holes; but when I was come there, lo! maybe a score small serpents\r\nwere about those places; and I was strongly pleased that I should keep\r\naway. Yet that I must warm and dry me in that desolate and bitter Night\r\nLand, you shall agree. And to this end, I put the scrip and the pouch\r\nupon me, and afterwards took the Diskos readily into my hand, and ran\r\nquietly unto the hollow where I did fight with the Yellow Thing. And the\r\ncloak I bore in my left hand.\r\n\r\nNow, when I was gat there, I was truly glad to think that there were no\r\nserpents in that place; and because that I had slain the Monster of the\r\nPlace, how should it be that any harm might come unto me; for truly, was\r\nit not like that a Creature of such Might should keep all that Hollow\r\nunto itself, and slay any that did come therein, and thereby preserve\r\nthat place from all other horror; though, surely, until it did die and\r\ncease to Be, there had been no call for any greater abomination.\r\n\r\nNow, all this did go through my brain, as I did sit to dry mine armour\r\nand my body and my gear, upon that side of the fire-hole which was away\r\nfrom the slain Monster. And I made presently to think that this would\r\nbe a sure and proper refuge wherein to sleep; for, truly, it must have\r\ngotten a place where none other Creature should be like to come to work\r\nme harm. And it must be that you do all see with me in this matter, and\r\ncommend me that I thought with properness.\r\n\r\nAnd so did I resolve that I put my disgust within my pocket, as we do\r\nsay, and stay safe and quiet within that Hollow. And this thing I did\r\nsurely, and did eat and drink; and presently I went over to the dead\r\nMonster, and made very sure that it was truly slain; which indeed it\r\nwas. And after that I had seen to this matter, I returned unto the\r\nfire-hole, and made a comfortable place in the sand, for my rest; for I\r\nwas well dry by this.\r\n\r\nAnd I wrapped the cloak about me, and took the Diskos to my breast, for\r\na sure Companion, as it had truly proved in my need. And I could think\r\nalmost that it did nestle unto me, as that it knew and loved me; but\r\nthis thing can be no more than a fancy; and I do but set it down as\r\nsuch, and that it doth show my feeling and mind at that time.\r\n\r\nThen, ere I did compose myself to slumber, I looked about me, upward to\r\nthe edges of the Hollow, and I perceived that I was lost to the sight of\r\nthe Mighty Pyramid; for I was come so far off that it looked not down\r\nfrom so wondrous a height, as you shall perceive; and moreover, the\r\nHollow was something deep.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, as I lay my head back upon the scrip and the pouch, which\r\nwere to me my pillow, I went to think a little upon Naani, as alway I\r\ndid in my constant journeying; yet, presently, I strove sometimes that I\r\nput her from my mind, that I should sleep; for a bitter sorrow and\r\nanxiousness was oft upon me when that I did think upon her; and this you\r\nmay know; for truly I knew not what terror was come to her, afar in the\r\nsilence of the Night. And did I think overmuch, I should feel that I\r\ncould have no calmness needful to sleep; but to need to walk for ever\r\nuntil I died, which could not be long; and so should I make a\r\nfoolishness of mine anxious journeying to do her true service and to\r\nsave her from Destruction, if such did truly threaten.\r\n\r\nAnd I was soon gone over to sleep, and waked not for seven hours, being\r\nmuch wearied by the fight and the soreness of my body, the which did put\r\nme into a great pain as I did rise upward from my slumber. But this was\r\npresently something less, and I eat two of the tablets and drank some of\r\nthe water, and afterward did put my gear upon me, and went forward into\r\nthe Night, having the Diskos in my hand. And my heart was glad that I\r\nhad come safe through the time of my sleep.\r\n\r\nNow I walked six hours, and did stop a little to eat and drink, and went\r\non again. And it was in this second Third of the day that I saw afar to\r\nmy right, two strange and wondrous men, and they did shine, as they had\r\nbeen made of a pale mist. And they came anigh, going very swift, and did\r\nseem as that they were maybe forty feet high, yet having no thickness;\r\nand I hid downward into the moss-bushes. And they past me, so quiet as a\r\ncloud of this day might go, and did appear to be, if I did guess, but an\r\nhundred fathoms off; yet was this no sure thing; for their position had\r\nno more surety than shall a rainbow have in this age. And so they were\r\ngone onward into the Night, and did seem to come out of the North. And\r\nthey did appear not to wot of me; and whether they were harmful, I know\r\nnot, for they harmed not me.\r\n\r\nAnd I lay there in the moss-bushes, until they were well gone away; and\r\nI had belief that they must be those same mist-men that were told of in\r\ncertain of the olden Records; but were never seen anigh to the Pyramid;\r\nthough I had thought, odd times, to see men, as of mist, through the\r\nGreat Spy-Glass, when I was within the Tower of Observation. But they\r\nwere always a mighty way off; and some would say it was but a bright\r\nvapour that did move; yet would others be in doubt, and so is it ever in\r\nsuch matters.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me take chance to say how that it is a hard thing to speak\r\nof such happenings to men of this age, and to make the truth proper unto\r\nthem; and because of this, oft am I tempted to say no word upon many\r\nthings that I did see; yet must I tell my tale, or suffer from the\r\nweight of it within me. And so shall you hark to me and give me your\r\nsympathy and human understanding. And concerning these mist-men, I have\r\nwondered oft whether they were the visible shape of some of those many\r\nForces that were abroad in the Night Land; for they did truly seem to me\r\nas that a thing of Strange Life were half shown to my human eyes; yet I\r\ndo not know, and am but telling of my natural thoughts and ponderings.\r\n\r\nNow, as I did say, those mist-men were never seen nigh unto the Pyramid,\r\nand were, as I did hint, always so far off that they were half given\r\nover to the fables of the olden days, in the beliefs of the Peoples of\r\nthe Mighty Redoubt; and set about with an halo of unrealness, for none\r\nwithin the Great Pyramid had ever beheld them with surety.\r\n\r\nAnd because that now I saw them anigh to me, it was borne in afresh upon\r\nmy spirit how greatly I had wandered away, and how that I stood afar in\r\nthe lonesomeness of that Land of Night; as it had been that a man of\r\nthis Age did wander amid the stars, and perceive a great comet to go by\r\nhim very close; for then he should know in his heart how that he was far\r\noff in the Void. And this I do say to you, that you may know somewhat of\r\nthe emotions of my heart in that moment.\r\n\r\nYet, presently I shook free of my melancholy and lonesomeness and rose\r\nup out of the moss-bushes, and went onward. And, as ever, I thought much\r\nupon the Maid that I did search for; yet strove to think quietly\r\nconcerning her state; else should I have turned to running, and wrecked\r\nmy body before that I had gone any great way.\r\n\r\nAnd that day, I passed seven large fire-holes, and two that were small;\r\nand always I came softly unto them; for there were oft living things\r\nabout the warmth. And at the sixth fire-hole, I did see that which I did\r\nthink to be a great man, that did sit to the fire, with monstrous knees\r\ndrawn upward unto his chin. And the nose was great and bent downward;\r\nand the eyes very large, and did shine with the light from the\r\nfire-hole, and moved, watching, always this way and that, so that the\r\nwhite parts did show, now this side and now that. But it was not\r\nproperly a man.\r\n\r\nAnd I went away very quiet from that place, and looked oft backward,\r\nuntil that I was sure of safety; for it was a very horrid Monster, and\r\nhad that place to be for a Lair, as I did judge from the smell thereof.\r\n\r\nAnd when the eighteenth hour was come, I looked about for a safe place\r\nto my sleep; and I kept away now from the fire-holes; for I did always\r\nfind the more life there. Yet, when I came to my rest, I was lacking of\r\nwarmth, by reason of this care; and could scarce sleep at all, because\r\nthat I was so cold. Yet managed something of slumber after a while; but\r\nwoke very stiff, and was glad to beat my hands and bestir myself that I\r\nshould come to some warmth of life.\r\n\r\nAnd after that I had eat and drunk, I put my gear upon me, and took the\r\nDiskos in my hand, and went forward again upon my journey. And here I\r\nshould tell that I was come soon unto the North-West border of the Plain\r\nof Blue Fire. And presently, I was but a little way off from it, and did\r\ngo direct to the North; so that the Plain was always upon my right.\r\n\r\nNow this Plain was a strange and fearsome place, as you shall see; for\r\nit was as that a blue void did rise upward from the earth in all the\r\ncountry of that Plain. For, surely, the Plain did not lumber with flame;\r\nbut was hid with a strange and inburning light, as of a shining\r\natmosphere of a cold blue colour. And it did throw no sure light upon\r\nthe Night Land, as had seemed proper; but was a very dreadful, cold\r\nshining, as of a luminous and blue void. And the moss-bushes grew nigh\r\nto the edge of the plain, and did show to me black and strange against\r\nthat horrid gloom of light.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall know that I could not see into the plain; for it was as\r\nthat the cold blue light was a void that swallowed all within it; and\r\ngave no power to the eye that aught should be perceived. And it stood\r\nbetween me and the Mighty Pyramid, and I could nowise see across. And I\r\nknow not whether I do make all this matter clear unto you; for surely it\r\nis no easy task.\r\n\r\nAnd presently I had gone very quiet upon my hands and knees through the\r\nmoss-bushes; and I came near upon the edge of the Plain, and hid there\r\nin a clump of the moss-bush, and peered forth and harked. And I heard\r\nconstant voices that did call to one another across the Plain; as it\r\nwere that strange peoples of Spirits did wander within that blue\r\nShining, and did make a calling one to the other, and were all hid and\r\nheld apart. And surely I could see naught, and did judge, as I have\r\nwrit, that they likewise went blindly. And truly is this a strange\r\nmatter to set out; and easy to think on with doubt. Yet as I did see, so\r\nhave I told; for, in verity, there were surely hidden Peoples of Spirits\r\nscattered and lost afar upon that improper Plain.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall judge that I kept safe hid; for whether this might have\r\nany natural explaining, or whether it was a matter that did go utter\r\nbeyond knowledge of man, I did not know; for surely in that strange\r\nLand, it did like to be an Horrid Danger in any case; and whether of\r\nsome Monstrous Creatures, or of the Evil Forces of the Land, I did\r\nwisely to be away.\r\n\r\nAnd for two days I did make a safe coasting of the Plain of Blue Fire;\r\nand did keep well off, maybe two great miles, among the moss-bushes. And\r\nI made a very good speed through the darkness. And at the eighteenth\r\nhour of each journey, I made a place for my slumber; and the first I did\r\nmanage under a thick bush; but the second was high upon the ledge of a\r\nrock that grew upward in the night amid the bushes. And, save that I was\r\nbitter cold there did no harm come to me. And in all that time of\r\njourneying, I had no sight of the Mighty Pyramid; for the blind shining\r\nof the Plain of Blue Fire was ever between.\r\n\r\nNow there had been certain little matters in my journey beside the Plain\r\nof Blue Fire, which I have not set down; for they were of no account,\r\nand do but repeat much that I have told before. And, indeed, there was\r\nnaught in that part of my journey, save that I did pass nineteen great\r\nfire-holes, and four small; and did observe no life beside any, save\r\nabout one of the great holes that there was no hollow around, and here I\r\ndid happen to see some strange and ugly creatures so big as my head,\r\nthat did have a look of the scorpion of this Age; but proportioned more\r\nsquat and thick. Yet, though they were naught to remark upon in that\r\nLand, they had been but woeful bedmates to any man; as you may think.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall know how it gave a rest to my spirit, that I did go so\r\nlong with no trouble of the Monsters of the Night, or the Evil Forces\r\nthereof. And I grew bolder to my journeying, and made ever a greater\r\nspeed of going; and it was like that I took presently a less heed for my\r\nsafety, which was a wrong and foolish state. Yet there came no harm unto\r\nme, in all that part of my travel.\r\n\r\nThen, it was in the sixteenth hour of the third day of my journey beside\r\nthe Plain, that I did come out beyond the end of it, and had fresh sight\r\nof the Mighty Pyramid, afar in the night upon my Right. And I stopt\r\nthere in a bare place among the moss-bushes, and did in a weak moment\r\nhold up the Diskos, so that I make a salute unto the Pyramid, Mine Home;\r\nfor truly was I so utter glad to behold it once more.\r\n\r\nAnd in a little while was I aware that there was a disturbance of the\r\naether of the world all about me; so that it did seem that there had\r\nbeen one at the Great Spy-Glass to watch for my coming into their sight\r\nfrom behind the shining of the Plain of Blue Fire.\r\n\r\nAnd it was like that news had gone downward through the Cities of the\r\nGreat Redoubt; so that they did print the word of it in the Hour-Slips;\r\nand by this there would be many great Millions thinking upon me, and a\r\nrushing unto the Embrasures, that they might spy out at me. Yet I doubt\r\nthat any glass might perceive me surely at so great a space, save the\r\npower of the Great Spy-Glass in the Tower of Observation. But the\r\nEmotion of the Millions to reach to me.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall know that it did seem homely and sweet unto me to hear all\r\nabout me the shaking of the aether of the world, and to be ware that so\r\nmany did think humanly upon me, and had prayers unto my safety.\r\n\r\nAnd it was a strange thing to stand so utter far off in the Night, and\r\nto look back to that Everlasting Hill of Light, that was grown something\r\nsmall by the distance, and to have surety that I was lookt upon through\r\nthe Great Spy-Glass, maybe by the kindly eye of my dear friend the\r\nMaster Monstruwacan, and so keenly that he could, it might be, make\r\nalmost to guess the look within mine eyes, as I did gaze backward unto\r\nthat Mine Home.\r\n\r\nYet, though this dear and homely sympathy was a sweet and companionable\r\nthing to my heart, it came swift to my thought that I was in a sore\r\ndanger, if that they ceased not quickly to think so onely upon me; for\r\nsurely was I not come over-near unto that _dreadful_ House of Silence;\r\nand well might so much Emotion of the Millions tell unto the Horrid\r\nPower that dwelt within, how that I was even anigh. And so shall you see\r\nthe mixt feelings that came upon me everyway.\r\n\r\nYet, as it did chance, the aether was quieted in a little; for it did\r\nneed unity of the Millions (being that they were untrained to their\r\nspiritual powers) to stir the aether. And so was I more easy of mind,\r\nand went forward again upon my way.\r\n\r\nNow, as it did chance, at the eighteenth hour, I was come to a place\r\nwhere I heard a noise of water; and I went to my left, that I might come\r\nupon it; and there boiled a hot fountain that went up out of the rock of\r\nthat place. And the water rose upward in a column, and was, maybe, so\r\nthick as my body; and it fell unto the North, for the water came not up\r\nstraightly, but did shoot out from the earth unto that way. And I saw\r\nthe thing plain; for there were many fire-holes all about, as you shall\r\nhave wotted from my telling; and so was there a certain and constant\r\nlight in that part of the Land.\r\n\r\nAnd I followed the water that ran from the fountain, and tried it with\r\nmine hand; but found it to burn; and so did go further beside it; for\r\npresently it should be no hotter than I did need. And it went onward,\r\nwinding among the moss-bushes, and sent up a constant steam, that hung\r\nabout it; and the steam made a red cloud about the way that it did go;\r\nfor the lights from the fire-holes made a shining upon it; and so was it\r\na wondrous pretty sight.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, I tried the stream again, and found it to be nicely\r\nwarm; and I sat upon a little rock, and took off my foot-gear, that I\r\nmight bathe my feet, which were gone something tender; moreover, I did\r\nache to have the sweetness of water about me. And I made that I should\r\nbathe my feet, and afterwards find a place among the moss-bushes, and so\r\neat and drink, and have my slumber.\r\n\r\nThen, as I did sit there beside that warm stream, with my feet dabbled\r\ntherein, I heard sudden, afar off, the voice of a mighty Night-Hound,\r\nbaying in the night. And the sound came from the North-West of the Plain\r\nof Blue Fire. And there was afterward a quiet; and you shall see me\r\nsitting there upon the rock by the side of that smoking river, and the\r\nsteam all about me, and my feet within the lovely warmth of the water;\r\nand I very still and frozen with a sudden fear; for, it did seem to me,\r\nin an instant, that the Night-Hound might surely be upon the track of my\r\ngoings.\r\n\r\nAnd after that there had passed a little time, the while that I did\r\nlisten very keen, lo! there burst out in the night, as it did seem\r\nscarce a mile off, the monstrous deep baying of the giant Hound. And I\r\nknew surely that the Brute did track me, and a sick and utter horror did\r\nfall upon me; so that I could scarce get my foot-gear upon me, once\r\nmore. Yet, in truth, I was not long to the matter, and was to my feet,\r\nand did hold the Diskos ready; and very desperate I was to the heart;\r\nfor it is ever a fearsome thing to be put in chase, and the worse an\r\nhundred times when there is a sure knowledge that a deathly Monster doth\r\nbe the pursuer.\r\n\r\nNow, I did stand there but a moment it did seem, to make an anxious\r\nconsidering how that I might best assure me some chance to live through\r\nthis swift coming Danger. And then did I think upon the stream, to use\r\nit, and I leapt quick therein, and did run very strong down the middle\r\npart, which was nowheres so much as thigh-deep, and oft not above mine\r\nankles. And as I did run, there came again the bellow of that dire\r\nBrute, following, and was now, as mine ears did say, scarce the half of\r\na mile to my rear.\r\n\r\nAnd I did run but the stronger, for the dread of the sound; and so,\r\nmaybe, for a little minute; and after that time, I stopt from mine heavy\r\nrunning, and went very wary, that I made no loud splashing; for by now\r\nthe Monster-Brute should be something anigh to that place where I did\r\nenter the stream. And I looked round, with a constant looking; but did\r\nsee no surely visible thing; though my fear did shape me an Hound from\r\nevery shadow of the moss-bushes about me.\r\n\r\nThen, in a moment, I did hear the Great Beast; for it bayed but a\r\nlittle way up the stream, as that it had overshot the place where the\r\nscent did end. And immediately, I sank swiftly into the water, which was\r\nthere so deep as my knee, and turned upon my belly. And the water surged\r\nover my shoulders; for I kept my head above. And so I did look eager and\r\nfearful through the steam into the shadows and the half-darkness,\r\ntowards where I did think to see the Night-Hound.\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment I saw it coming; and it was a little vague, by reason of\r\nthe smoke of the river; yet did seem black and monstrous in the gloom,\r\nand great as a mighty horse. And it went past me at a vast and\r\nlumbersome gallop; but I did not see it in that moment; for I dived my\r\nhead down unto the rock of the river bottom, and held downward, until\r\nthat I was like to burst for sore longing of breath.\r\n\r\nThen I put upward my head, and took swift and deep breathings, and lookt\r\nabout me, very cautious and fearful, as you can know. And I heard the\r\nNight-Hound casting round among the moss-bushes, and it did send up a\r\nwild and awesome baying; and I heard the bushes brake and smash beneath\r\nit, as it did run to and hither. And afterward there was a quiet; yet I\r\nmoved not; but stayed there, very low in the water, and did have a\r\nthankful heart that it was warm and easy to persist in; for I had surely\r\ndied of a frozen heart, if that it had been cold; for, by this time, you\r\ndo know even with me, how bitter was the chill of the Land.\r\n\r\nNow, I had been awhile lain thus upon my belly, and heard no sound from\r\nthe monstrous Hound. Yet, I ceased not to be full of an horrid unease,\r\nconcerning the Great Beast; for I did better to know what it did, than\r\nto have no knowing. And, sudden, I heard the sound of it, running very\r\nswiftly and coming nigh; and it passed me, and did go up the stream; and\r\nthere was surely a quick stupor upon me; for I ducked not my head under\r\nthe water; but stayed very still; which as it did chance, was maybe not\r\nsuch an utter foolishness; for my head did seem in that half-gloom to\r\nbe, mayhap, no more than a little rock in the water, and I made no move\r\nto tell of life; yet should the Hound have smelled me; and that it\r\nfailed in this matter, doth be a puzzle to me.\r\n\r\nAnd as the great Night-Hound past me, it tore the earth and the bushes,\r\nwith the exceeding strength that it put forth to run, and clods of the\r\nearth and stones of bigness were cast this way and that by the feet of\r\nthe Hound, running. And so shall you have a little knowledge of the\r\nstrength of that Beast.\r\n\r\nAnd the Hound ran on into the distance, and presently, I heard it baying\r\nin the Night. Then I rose, and went onward, down the warm stream, and\r\nmade a strong walking, yet keeping alway to the water; and oft did stop\r\na little that I should listen; and always I heard the Night-Hound a\r\ngreat way off in the night, baying, and seeming that it did surely run\r\nto and fro, searching.\r\n\r\nNow, I journeyed thus for twelve hours, and the baying of the Hound\r\nmaking search, did never cease. And I kept always to the water, as I\r\ndid say, that I should leave no scent unto the Hound. And by that twelve\r\nweary hours had gone, I found that I was come anigh unto the House of\r\nSilence. And this put me in great trouble; as you may perceive; for\r\nsurely had mine whole effort been to the end that I should avoid that\r\nHouse, by a great way. Yet had the Hound driven me thus a-near.\r\n\r\nNow I saw that the small river did go onward, and did make a breach\r\nacross the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk; and I determined in my heart\r\nthat I should leave the water, which was now grown nigh to a bitter\r\ncold, in that it was so long upon the face of the Land. Yet chiefly did\r\nI mind to leave the water, that I should come no more anigh unto that\r\nHouse of Silence; for the water did go that way. And I stood awhile, and\r\ndid listen for the baying of the Hound; but could hear it no more; and\r\ndid have a surety within me that it was indeed gone from searching for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThen I came out of the water, and went forward, stooping and creeping,\r\namong the moss-bushes, going outward to the Westward of North, so that I\r\nshould go away so quickly as I might from the nearness of the House.\r\nYet, lo! I was gone upon my hands and knees no more than an hundred\r\nfathoms, when I did find the moss-bushes to cease to the Westward, for a\r\ngreat way, and there to be a great bareness of rock, which, in truth,\r\nwas much shown thereabout. And I dared not to go outward upon that naked\r\nLand; for then I had not been hid by the moss-bushes; but had stood\r\nplain there for all things of the Night to behold; and moreover, though\r\nI could nowise have a sure knowledge concerning this matter, yet did I\r\nhope within me that I should make a sure hiding from the Power of the\r\nHouse of Silence, did I but go very low among the bushes. But, indeed,\r\nit was like enough that naught could give me hiding; yet should I lose\r\nno chance unto my safety.\r\n\r\nAnd because of this, I went backward among the bushes, and ceased to\r\nescape out unto the Westward. And I found presently, that the\r\nmoss-bushes made but a narrow growth in that path, and grew only for a\r\nwhile by the side of the Great Road; so that I was surely fain to keep\r\nnigh to the Road, that I have the covering of the bushes.\r\n\r\nAnd, in a while, I found the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, to bend\r\ninward at the North of the House of Silence; so that it came right\r\nhorridly close unto the House; for here the hill on which the House did\r\nstand, was very abrupt and fell steeply unto the Road. And so was that\r\nDreadful House stood up there above me in the Silence, as that it did\r\nseem to _brood_ there upon the Land. And this side did seem truly as the\r\nother; and equal lone and dreadful. And the House was monstrous and\r\nhuge, and full of quiet lights; and it was truly as that there had been\r\nno Sound ever in that House through Eternity; but yet was it as that the\r\nheart did think each moment to see quiet and shrouded figures within,\r\nand yet never were they seen; and this I do but set down that I bring\r\nall home unto _your_ hearts also, as that you crouched there with me in\r\nthose low moss-bushes, there beside the Great Road, and did look upward\r\nunto that Monstrous House of Everlasting Silence, and did feel the\r\nutterness of silence to hang about it in the night; and to know in your\r\nspirits the quiet threat that lived silent there within.\r\n\r\nAnd so shall you have mind of me, hid there among the bushes, and sodden\r\nand cold; and yet, as you will perceive, so held in my spirit by an\r\nutter terror and loathing and solemn wonder and awe of that Mighty House\r\nof Quietness loomed above me in the Night, that I wotted not of the\r\nmisery of my body, because that my spirit was put so greatly in dread\r\nand terror for the life of my Being.\r\n\r\nAnd also you shall have before you, how that I knew in all my body and\r\nsoul, that I stood anigh to that Place where but a little while gone\r\nthere had passed inward so dreadful to an everlasting Silence and Horrid\r\nMystery those poor Youths.\r\n\r\nAnd after that you have minded you of this, you shall consider how that\r\nthe memory of all my life held dread thoughts of the monstrousness of\r\nthat House; and now was I anigh unto it. And it did seem to my soul that\r\nthe very Night about it, held an anguish of quiet terror. And always my\r\nmind did come back to the sheer matter that I was so anigh. And this\r\nthing I do say unto you once and again; for truly, as you do see, it\r\nhath imprinted itself deep into my spirit. Yet shall I now cease from\r\nsaying further in this manner; for, surely, you shall never know all\r\nthat was in mine heart; and if I cease not, I do but be like to weary\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nAnd so did I hide and creep, and oft pause to a time of shaking quiet;\r\nand afterward gather something of new courage, and go onward; and peer\r\nupward at that monstrous House, stood above me in the night. Yet, as it\r\ndid come about, I came presently clear of that horrid place; for the\r\nRoad came round again unto the North, and I began that I made a better\r\nway through the moss-bushes; but never that I grew to much speed; for I\r\nhad oft to go about, that I should miss a naked part here, and another\r\nthere; for truly there was an abundance and bareness of rock, so that\r\nthe bushes grew not so thick as I could wish.\r\n\r\nAnd in the space of five hours was I clear of that House; and did have a\r\ngreater ease about my heart; but yet was not free to come to food nor to\r\nslumber, the both of which I did sorely need; for I had slept neither\r\neat for a weariful time, as you do know. But first I must go further off\r\nfrom the House, and afterwards come to some fire-hole, that I should dry\r\nmyself and get warmth again into my body, which was bitter cold.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I had come unto the Northward of the House of Silence,\r\nthere came to me a great Wonder, which bred in me a mighty Hope and\r\nGladness. For as I did go among the bushes, there broke sudden all\r\naround me in the aether, the low and solemn beat of the Master-Word. And\r\nthe throb of the Word was utter weak; so that one moment I did say unto\r\nmyself that I heard, and in a moment that I did not; yet had I no proper\r\ndoubt in my heart.\r\n\r\nAnd I reasoned with myself, and with a great shaking of excitement and\r\nexpectation upon me, that the Master-Word came not from the Great\r\nPyramid, which should have power to send it as a Great Force across the\r\neverlasting Night; whilst that this that throbbed about me was faint and\r\nscarce to be known even unto the keenness of the Night-Hearing, which\r\nwas mine.\r\n\r\nAnd, immediately, as I crouched low there, and thrilled with the hope\r\nthat was bred in me, lo! there seemed to come the far faint voice of\r\nNaani, calling with a little voice within my spirit. And I thought the\r\ncry to have an utterness of supplication within it; so that I grew\r\ndesperate to up and go to running; yet did curb such foolishness, and\r\nstayed very hushed, to listen.\r\n\r\nBut I heard no more; yet was shaken continually with the Joy and Hope\r\nwhich this calling did breed in me, for truly did it seem now that I was\r\nright that I did determine to go unto the North; for sure was I now that\r\nthe Lesser Redoubt lay that way in the Night. And it did seem plain unto\r\nme, that the House of Silence had put a barrier between; and had power\r\nto withhold so weak a calling. And now had I come beyond the Barrier.\r\nAnd I did perceive in my heart how that Naani had called off, maybe in\r\nthe sadness of Despair; yet had the weak crying of her brain-elements\r\nbeen held from me by the horrid power of the house; and surely, as I did\r\nthink, it was well named; for it did make a silence.\r\n\r\nAnd so shall you stay with me in your hearts, and take to ourselves\r\nsomething of the new Gladness that held all my being; for it did seem\r\ntruly that my bitter task and adventuring should not in the end be\r\noffered to Uselessness; and that I did truly draw unto that far place in\r\nthe Everlasting Night, where mine own Maid did cry for me, that I should\r\nsuccour her.\r\n\r\nAnd ever as I went, did I hark; but there was no more the low eating of\r\nthe Master-Word in the Night; not at that time.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I spied outward to the West, as it did seem a good mile\r\noff in the night, the shining of a fire-hole; and I began to plan that I\r\nshould come unto that place, and have warmth and dryness, and food and\r\nslumber. And, in verity, so set was I to the need of these matters that\r\nif there did be a Monstrous Thing nigh to the fire--as was so oft the\r\ncase--then would I give battle unto it; for neither my Joy nor my\r\nlabours did serve to put warmth into my body; and I must surely come\r\nanigh to fire, or die.\r\n\r\nThen, as I kneeled upward among the moss-bushes, and made to lay a true\r\ncourse unto the fire-hole, I perceived that there came a Being along\r\nthe Road unto my right; and I went low into the bushes, and moved not;\r\nfor truly I had seen that there drew nigh one of the Silent Ones.\r\n\r\nAnd I made a little place that should let me to see; and I spied out,\r\nwith an utter caution; and lo! the Being came on very quiet, and with no\r\nhurry. And in a time, it went by me on the road, and did take no heed to\r\nme; yet did I feel that it had knowledge that I stoopt there among the\r\nmoss-bushes. And it made no sound as it went; and was a Dreadful thing;\r\nyet, it did seem unto my heart, as that it had no trouble of Wanton\r\nMalice to work needless Destruction to any. And this, I crave strangely\r\nthat you to understand; for it was so to me that I had a quiet and great\r\nrespect for that thing; and did feel no hatred; yet was very dreadly in\r\nfear of it. And it was Huge in size, and was shrouded unto its feet, and\r\nseemed, maybe ten feet high. Yet, presently, it was gone onward down the\r\nRoad, and I was no more troubled by it.\r\n\r\nThen did I make no waste of time; but set off unto the fire-hole; and\r\nkept so much to shelter as I might; but was oft made to run over baked\r\nplaces, ere that I should come to more of the bushes.\r\n\r\nAnd I came presently nigh unto the fire-hole, and made a pause, and\r\ncrept unto it, with a great care. And I found it to be in the bottom of\r\na deep hollow of the rock of that part. And the rock was clear looking\r\nof all living matters, the which did make me to be glad. And I went\r\nround about the top of the hollow, carrying the Diskos very handily; but\r\nthere was nowhere any living thing; and I feared not to go downward into\r\nthe deep hollow, and so unto the fire-hole, which lay in the bottom, as\r\nyou have perceived.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was come there, I made a close search of the rock, and found\r\nit was very sweet and warm; and there were no serpents, neither any\r\nstinging creatures; so that a certain comfort came upon my spirit.\r\n\r\nThen stript I off mine armour and gear, and afterward all my garments,\r\nso that I stood naked there in the hollow. Yet was that place almost so\r\nwarm as some mild oven, and I had no fear to suffer from the cold of the\r\nNight Land; but was uneasy lest that any monstrous thing should be anigh\r\nto come to take me so unawares.\r\n\r\nNow I wrung the garments, and spread them upon the rock near unto the\r\nfire-hole, where it was hot; and I did rub my body very brisk with my\r\nhands, so that I glowed into health and had no fear of a stiffness.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I did look to my food and drink, and to the matters in\r\nthe pouch; but there had no harm come to any, by reason of the tightness\r\nof the scrip and the pouch, that had kept off the water. And I eat and\r\ndrank, there as I stood waiting for the garments to come to dryness; and\r\nI walked about a little, as I eat; for I was restless to be into mine\r\narmour swiftly. And now I did turn this garment upward of the dry side,\r\nand now that; but did find them to steam, so that I turned them many\r\ntimes before they were proper.\r\n\r\nYet, in truth, they dried in but a little while, and I gat me into them\r\nvery swift, and into the armour; and I felt the strength and courage of\r\nmy spirit to come back into me, which had gone outward somewhat when I\r\ndid stand there so naked. And this feeling you shall all have\r\nunderstanding of; and know that you would have felt that way, likewise,\r\nhad you but stood there in that Land in so unhappy a plight.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had come into mine armour, I put my gear upon me, and took\r\nthe Diskos into my hand, and did climb out of the hollow; for I would\r\nfind a more secure place to my slumber, and did not dare to sleep in\r\nthat place; for it was beyond seven and thirty hours since that I did\r\nhave sleep; though as I do see by my count, I have made it to seem but\r\nas five and thirty; yet was a part consumed in diverse matters that I\r\nhave not set down. And you shall mind how bitter had been my labour and\r\nweariness in all that time; and I did know of a surety that sleep must\r\ncome heavily upon me; so that I was sorely in need that I should search\r\nout a safe place; for I should not be lightly waked, until that I had\r\nslept away the tiredness of my heart, and the weariful achings from my\r\nbody. And, indeed, I should mind you how that I was not yet come perfect\r\nfrom the bruising which I had gotten from the fight with the Yellow\r\nThing.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, when I had searched but a little while, I did find that a\r\nrock stood upward from a great clumping of the moss-bushes unto my left;\r\nand I went over to the rock, and made a search about it. And I found\r\nthat there was a hole into the bottom part of the rock, and I thrust the\r\nDiskos into the hole, and made the blade to spin a little, so that it\r\nsent out a light; but there was no thing in the hole, and it did seem a\r\ndry and safe place for my sleep.\r\n\r\nThen I turned me about, and went into the hole with my feet that way;\r\nand I found that it was so deep into the rock as the length of two men,\r\nand just so wide as I could lie in it without having it to pinch me. And\r\nthere I made my bed in the hole, and went swift unto my sleep, and\r\nscarce had but a moment even to think upon Naani; and by this thing\r\nshall you know how utter was my weariness.\r\n\r\nNow I waked of a sudden, and was very clear and refreshed. And I crept\r\nto the mouth of the hole, and lookt out; but there was all a quietness\r\nround about, and nothing to threaten.\r\n\r\nAnd I found that I had slept ten hours; so that I made a haste to eat\r\nand drink, that I should go forward swiftly upon my journey. And at that\r\ntime, as in the time when I did eat, naked, in the hollow, by the\r\nfire-hole, I eat four of the tablets; and this you shall understand to\r\nbe rightly due unto me, in that I had gone so long fasting in that my\r\ngreat journeying to come safe from the Hound, and to come past the House\r\nof Silence. And this shall seem but a little thing to you; yet was it a\r\nwondrous important matter unto me, that had gone so long with an empty\r\nbelly, and was never satisfied. And neither should any be, that had eat\r\nso little as I did eat, and made to fill their belly always with a drink\r\nof water. Yet, I doubt not but that it did keep my soul sweet and\r\nwholesome and no useful thing to the Powers of Evil of the Land.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had made an end of so great a gorging, and had ceased to be\r\ndrunken with water, I gat my gear upon me, and took the Diskos into mine\r\nhand, and so went forth once more towards the North.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I was nigh unto the Road again; for it did curve\r\nsomething Westward a space beyond. And I was sore tempted to go upon the\r\nRoad; for the ground was rough and the moss-bushes did catch my feet.\r\nYet did I stay among the bushes, though the Road was true and smooth, by\r\ncompare. And by this telling, you will perceive that I walked once more\r\nupright, and had given over to crawl between the bushes. And, in truth,\r\nthis was so; for the Land did seem very quiet in all that part; and I\r\nhad less of fear, now that I stood beyond the horrid unease of the House\r\nof Silence.\r\n\r\nNow, after that I had journeyed twelve hours, I saw that I was come upon\r\nthe commencement of a great and mighty slope, as that the world did\r\nslope downward always towards the North. And I went on again, after that\r\nI had eat and drunk, as I did likewise before this at the sixth hour of\r\nthat day\'s journey.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I perceived the Road to cease; and surely this did\r\nconfound me; as that a man of this age had come to a part where the\r\nworld did end; for you shall know that the Road was that which had\r\nseemed to go on for ever; and you shall mind the way of my life up till\r\nthat time, and so shall you the better conceive of my bewilderment, and\r\nas it were a feeling of great strangeness unto one that was overprest,\r\nas you would believe, with strange matters.\r\n\r\nYet, truly, was this all as the little book of metal had told unto me;\r\nand so should I have been something prepared; yet are we ever thus\r\nneeding eye-proof; and perhaps it is more proper that it be so.\r\n\r\nYet, you shall perceive me adrift somewhat as to direction; for I had\r\nsteered before this time so that I should come to the North of the House\r\nof Silence; and afterward had shaped my way by the Road. But now was I\r\nadrift, as it might be set down, in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nAnd so did I stand and consider, and presently did look unto the far\r\nPyramid, which was now a great way off in the night, and had seemed but\r\nsmall by that which I knew it to be. And lo! as I did look, I perceived\r\nthat I could but see the high upper-point of the light of the Great\r\nPyramid, where did shine the Last Light; and I was confounded afresh;\r\nyet in a moment I saw that the greatness of the slope did account for\r\nthis. But here I should tell to you that the slope was nowise steep; but\r\ndid seem as that it should never cease. And mayhaps this is clear unto\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nAnd I perceived surely that the time was come when I should make an\r\nutter parting from the Great Redoubt; and the thought came very heavy\r\nupon me. And in the same time I knew that the aether was stirred by the\r\nemotions of the Millions; so that I had knowledge they watched me with\r\nthe Great Spy-Glass, and did send word down unto the Hour-Slips; and by\r\nthis did the Millions know, and have a great thinking upon me in that\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall perceive how utter lost and lonesome I did feel. And it\r\nwas at that time that I did test the compass, to comfort me, as I did\r\ntell before this, and feared I must sure forget, when I did come to the\r\nproper place; yet have I minded me, as I did desire.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw now that the Night Land that I did wot of, was hid from me by\r\nthe slope. And I turned and looked down the slope; and surely all before\r\nme was utter wildness of a dark desolation; for it did seem to go\r\nnowhither but into an everlasting night. And there was no fire down\r\nthere, neither light of any kind; but only Darkness and, as I did feel,\r\nEternity. And downward into that Blackness did the great slope seem to\r\ngo for ever.\r\n\r\nNow, as I did stand there, looking downward into the Dark, and often\r\nbackward unto the shining of the Final Light, and put to a horrid\r\ndesolateness, behold! there came the low beating of the Master-Word in\r\nthe Night. And it did appear as that it had been sent to give me courage\r\nand strength in that moment; and did seem unto my fancy that surely it\r\ndid come upward unto me from out of the mighty blackness into which the\r\nGreat Slope ran. Yet could this have been but a belief; for the aether\r\ndoth have no regard unto direction to show you whence the spiritual\r\nsound doth come; and this did my knowledge and Reason know full well.\r\n\r\nAnd I made that I would send back the Master-Word, sending it with my\r\nbrain-elements, and so give news unto Naani how that I did struggle to\r\ncome unto her. Yet did I have caution in time; for in verity, had I sent\r\nthe Master-Word, then had the Evil Forces of the Land wotted that I was\r\nout; and mayhaps had come swift unto my Destruction; and so did I\r\ncontain my spirit and desire, and made to do wisely.\r\n\r\nYet was I put in courage by the low beat of the Master-Word; and did\r\nlisten very keen, that some message should follow; but there came none,\r\nneither did the weak throb of the Word come about me again, at that\r\ntime. And because that I was now grown more to my natural state, and did\r\nfeel that I should indeed find the Maid, I looked once more unto the\r\nGreat Pyramid, long and eager and with a solemn heart; yet with no sign\r\nor salutation, as I was before determined. And afterward, I turned and\r\nwent downward into the dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nDOWN THE MIGHTY SLOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I went downward very quiet and slow into that Darkness; and did make\r\nbut a cautious way; for now you shall know me truly wrapped about with\r\nsuch a night as did seem to press upon my very soul, and such as you\r\nshall never have seen nor felt; so that I did seem lost even from my\r\nself, and did appear as that I went presently in unreal fashion, and did\r\npass onward for ever and for ever through everlasting night; so that odd\r\nwhiles I did make to walk with random, as that I stept no more upon this\r\nearth; but did go offwards into the Void. Yet was this foolishness of\r\nthe mind set straight and proper each time that it did come about; for\r\nlo! I did kick against an upjutting rock here, and fall upon a great and\r\nunseen boulder there, and so was shaken very quickly to a sound\r\nknowledge that I trode the hard and actual earth; and had no true\r\ndealings with unreal matters.\r\n\r\nAnd ever I did go downward; and by this only did I have a guide to my\r\nway. Yet, as you shall think, through reason of the utter dark I made\r\nscarce a mile in an hour or even two full hours; and so grew bitter by\r\nreason of mine unableness to go forward with a proper and free stride.\r\n\r\nBut I did think me presently upon a thing that I should do to light my\r\npath; and to this end, I did make the Diskos to spin, odd whiles, and\r\ndid look down the mighty slope, the little way that the strange\r\nglistening of the Diskos did show, and so fixed my path into mine inward\r\nremembering, and would go forward afresh, until that I was shaken once\r\nmore by the darkness, and would fain to look once again upon the\r\nblessedness of light, and make me some knowledge of my way.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, the light from the Diskos did seem astonishing great, and\r\nthis to be because there was so monstrous a darkness all about me there\r\nforever. And thereafter would I go onward again, until the pain of my\r\nstumblings did bid me surely to have that sweet shining once more unto\r\nmy path.\r\n\r\nAnd so shall you perceive my going; and sore and miserable was it unto\r\nthe heart; and like to shake the courage of the spirit; yet, in verity,\r\nI had come through much, and did have intent to give way to no\r\nfoolishness of thought.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall well believe that I did make the light not more oft than I\r\ndid surely need; for it was no properness of wisdom to use the power of\r\nthe Diskos, save for mine extremity.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, when I had done thiswise through six long and bitter\r\nhours, and it being now beyond the twentieth hour since I did last\r\nslumber, I sat me down there upon the Mighty Slope, in the everlasting\r\nDark, and did eat two of the tablets, and made the water, and could but\r\nfeel and hearken whether I did this thing right and that.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had eat and drunk, I unfolded my cloak, and wrapt it around\r\nme, and placed the scrip and the pouch under my head; and the Diskos I\r\ntook to company me; and so fell swiftly upon sleep; yet did think\r\nearnestly but vaguely upon Naani, as I came unto slumber.\r\n\r\nAnd I slept all but six hours, and did waken very sudden there in the\r\nutter dark; and I got me to mine elbow, and did listen very keen; for I\r\nhad waked immediately, as that something had touched me or come nigh\r\nunto me; and I gript the Diskos, and listened; but there did not even a\r\nlittle sound come to me out of all that night.\r\n\r\nAnd presently I had more assuredness that naught did make harm about me;\r\nand I sat me up in the dark, and reached for my scrip, and did eat and\r\ndrink, there in that utter night; and fumbled somewhat, as you shall\r\nthink. Yet I was done in a while, and got my gear upon me, and the\r\nDiskos into my hand, and so to my feet and forward.\r\n\r\nNow all that day, I did have a strange unease of the spirit, so that I\r\nstopt oft to listen, as that my soul told of something nigh unto me that\r\ndid follow very quiet. Yet did mine ears perceive nothing; and so I\r\nalway to go downward again into the night that held the slope.\r\n\r\nAnd here should I tell how that in the early part of the seventh hour,\r\nafter I had eat and drunk, and went forward as ever, upon my journey\r\ndown the Mighty Slope, I did have a very sore tumble against a sharp\r\nrock; for I put my foot sudden into a small hole, and this did make me\r\nto pitch. And I was utter shaked by the fall and lay very quiet for a\r\ntime; for the rock had surely ript my body, but for the armour.\r\n\r\nAnd after that I was something renewed of strength and spirit, I made\r\nthat I should go no more upon my feet, but upon my hands and knees; and\r\nthus should I feel the way that I went, and have a less need of the\r\nDiskos, which had not overmuch use to light my way, in that I shone it\r\nnot often, and did guess more than I did perceive, as you may think.\r\n\r\nAnd so I crept all that day, which was a bitter way of travel; yet had I\r\ndone many a sore mile thus through the Night Land. And when that I had\r\ngone downward for eighteen hours, and eat and drunk thrice, I ceased\r\nfrom my labour, and did feel about in the darkness, that I come to a\r\nlevel place for my rest; and so did find presently, a place not so bad,\r\nand did push and cast away such small boulders as had been like to irk\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThen did I eat and drink, and afterward composed me to my sleep, and had\r\nmany a thought of Naani, as I did drift unto slumber; yet also had I\r\nmemories of the strange half-fear that had been with me all that day, as\r\nthough something went constantly near me in the Dark. And because of\r\nthis, twice did I rise unto mine elbow, and listen; but heard no sound\r\nto trouble me, and afterward did trust that I did but fancy; and so came\r\nat last unto slumber, that yet was not over-restful, for truly I did\r\nlisten even as I slept.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had been asleep scarce six hours, I waked again very sudden,\r\nas I had done before, and had belief that something did be anigh unto\r\nme; and I gript the Diskos, and did hearken; yet was there no sound that\r\nmine ears did wot of; neither aught that had power to be surely known of\r\nthe spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd all that day was as the day before; save that about the eighth hour\r\nI came near to fall into some monstrous pit in the Great Slope; but did\r\nonly fall with my breast upon the edge, and so drew back, and presently\r\ndid crawl all around it in the dark, and come safe unto the lower side;\r\nyet shaken and put more in trouble of spirit than before, and fearful\r\nhow I should go; for I knew not whether I had come among such things, or\r\nwhether I had but few to sorrow me.\r\n\r\nAnd so you shall perceive that I went over-cautious for a great while in\r\nall that utter dark; but did think at last upon a plan to go with more\r\nsurety and speed. But to this I did need a cord, and surely I had no\r\ncord upon me; and if a boy be no boy that hath none such about him,\r\nshall not the same be said of any man! And this I did think, as I\r\nsearched me; for the sayings of that day had many that were like to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nYet in the end I did compass my plan; for I did buckle the scrip and the\r\npouch together, and took one of the straps from the pouch; and this\r\nstrap was long and thin, and well suited unto my purpose. Then I fixt a\r\nstone into the end of the strap, and buckled it there, and after that, I\r\ncast the stone before me, as I went upon my hands and knees; and I did\r\nhold to the hither end of the strap, and so was abled to have something\r\nof knowledge whether there lay any great deepness immediately before me,\r\nand thiswise to strive that I fall not down some monstrous cliff in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAnd so did I go, casting the stone continually to my front, down the\r\nslope; and this you shall think to be a cumbersome fashion of travel;\r\nyet was I in better case than in all the time since I had begun to go\r\ndownward of the Mighty Slope in the everlasting darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd at the eighteenth hour I did sleep; and was waked strangely before\r\nthe sixth hour, even as I had waked before. And this did put always\r\nupon me a new wonder and unease. Yet did no harm seem to come unto me,\r\nand I did strive that I have no needful trouble of mind. But that\r\nsomething was always nigh unto me in the dark, I do truly believe; yet\r\nhave I no knowing that it was evil; for it harmed not me.\r\n\r\nAnd three days more I journeyed thus, and did never cease to creep\r\ndownward weariful upon my hands and knees; and the Diskos I had to my\r\nhip, and so shall you know how I carried it. And by this, as you do\r\nknow, I had been on the Great Slope six days of utter Dark; and did have\r\nno wotting but that I went unto some dire and dreadful place; for,\r\nsurely, I had gone for ever downward a monstrous way.\r\n\r\nAnd here, before I tell further, I must set down how that the cold was\r\nmuch gone from out of the air upon the slope; and the air was grown, as\r\nit did seem, very heavy unto my chest. And concerning this matter I\r\nshould say something. For, if I do mind me, I have said not overmuch\r\nconcerning the air of the Night Land and the Mighty Pyramid; for truly I\r\nhave been so set to tell my story of all that I did truly see and\r\nadventure upon. Yet, though I have said but little, you will surely have\r\nperceived that the air of that far and chill time was not as the air of\r\nthis; but was thin and keen within the Night Land, and lay not, as I do\r\nthink, to a great height above the land, but only nigh to the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd as you do know through my tellings, there was a wondrous difference\r\nbetween the air within the Mighty Pyramid, and that which lay without\r\naround the base; for upward beyond that, I did understand that there was\r\nno outward air that any should breathe; and so was all the Pyramid\r\nsealed in certain wise in all the upper Cities for ever; and whether it\r\nwas sealed _utterly_ from the outward air at the base, I do not surely\r\nremember, if, in truth that I did ever bother my head to such matters.\r\n\r\nYet, if I be set proper in memory and understanding, we did draw air\r\nfrom the Underground Fields; but whether they gat any change or newness\r\nof air from the Night Land, I have no knowledge; and do lament that I\r\nhave no sure knowing. Yet, as you shall believe, I could surely write an\r\nhundred books upon that Wonder of the Future, and be still lacking in\r\nthe half of all that there is to be told; and so do I try to have\r\ncourage to this my task, and to have no over-trouble, because that I do\r\ntell but a little of a Great Tale.\r\n\r\nAnd here in this place will I set down how that the Peoples of the\r\nPyramid were greater to the chest, methinks, than we of this age; but\r\nyet do I have no oversurety in the matter; for well it may be that the\r\nReason of _this_ age doth blind within me somewhat the Knowledge that I\r\nhave concerning _that_; for, in verity, is it not but a natural thing to\r\nbelieve those Peoples to be great of the chest, so that they should make\r\na proper dealing with the thin air of that place and that time? And yet,\r\nas I do strive to make plain unto you, because that this thing should\r\nbe, by the making of my Reason, I do the more distrust that Reason\r\nshall make foolish my Knowledge; for even a fool should suppose that\r\nwhich I have told; and the truth may be even otherwise.\r\n\r\nYet that the Peoples of the _Upper_ Cities had great chests, I do well\r\nknow; for this was a common knowledge; even as we of this age do\r\nacknowledge the Peoples of Africa to be of blackness, or those of\r\nPatagonia to be of great stature. And by this one thing should any know\r\na man of the Upper Cities, from a man of the Lower Cities. And because\r\nthat there grew this difference among the Peoples, there had been once,\r\nas any could learn from the Histories, a plan whereby the Peoples should\r\nbe moved upward and downward through the great height of the Mighty\r\nPyramid, from this city unto that. Yet had it met with great disfavour;\r\nand was put out of force; and this is easy to be seen as the natural way\r\nof the human heart.\r\n\r\nAnd here it doth occur unto me that it was like enough to be a plan for\r\nhealth, beside of training of the mind, that each youth and maid was put\r\nto travel through all the cities of the Mighty Pyramid; the which did\r\ntake three years and two hundred and twenty-five days, as I have told\r\nbefore this. For by this plan, were they made to breathe the air of\r\nevery height, and this, mayhaps, unto the good of their developing. And\r\nthey also to discover that air which was best to their need.\r\n\r\nAnd concerning the air of the Night Land, you shall know that there was\r\nin all that Land no flying thing, because that the air was grown very\r\nthin; yet, as the Records did show, there had once been monstrous\r\nflying-brutes, that went over the Land in mighty bounds; but this was in\r\na long gone age; and we could but suppose that the Records gave truth.\r\n\r\nAnd here you shall know that, when the Monstruwacans did learn that I\r\nwould journey through the Night Land, in search of Naani, there had been\r\nsome foolish and well-intended talk among them that I take a small\r\nflying-ship, that was in the Great Museum beside the models of the Great\r\nShips. For, truly, this machine was yet sound to go; for it was made of\r\nthe grey metal of the Mighty Pyramid, that did seem to have no power to\r\ncease. Yet, in verity, I had no skill to manage this, neither had it\r\nflown, through an hundred thousand years; so that none did know the\r\nmastership of that art, which did be learned but by a constant practice,\r\nand oft made uneasy by fallings that did wreck the machine, as I did\r\nknow from the Book of Flying. And, moreover, as I have told, the air of\r\nthe Night Land was grown over-weak to uphold such a thing; which, I\r\ndoubt not, had made the Peoples of the Pyramid to cease from flyings,\r\nquite so much as that they did fear the Forces of Evil in the night.\r\n\r\nAnd if that there had been air and skill sufficient unto this purpose of\r\nflying, yet had I been wicked with foolishness that I should work to be\r\nhung upward in the night, for all the Evil of the Night Land to behold.\r\nAnd though I had gone up some great way, yet the machine had surely made\r\na great noise in the quietness of the eternal night, as you shall\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\nNow indeed am I gone weary that I should need to tell so much concerning\r\nthe air of that Time and Place; for surely I do seem to make this my\r\nstory as that I did make a lecturing upon matters of chemistry; and so\r\ndo I cast about, that I may not bother to tell more upon this matter.\r\nYet, in truth, a little more of my thinkings and observings had I better\r\nset down here, and so be done with it. But you shall have patience with\r\nme, and know that had this, my story, been no more than an idle tale, I\r\nhad been free to make no labour with such matters.\r\n\r\nNow there doth a wonder come to me why that the Road Makers, who were of\r\nthat far-off Age which was before the Age of the Mighty Pyramid, did not\r\n_fly_ downward from the upper world into the deep of the monstrous\r\nvalley; but did instead build a road.\r\n\r\nYet it may be that the air of the upper world had grown thin a great\r\nage, so that they had truly forgot that once man did have power to fly.\r\nBut even if that they did have proper machines to this purpose, surely\r\nit were a wondrous and fearful thing to fly downward an hundred great\r\nmiles; for they surely to have a dread that they never to rise again\r\nthrough so huge a deep.\r\n\r\nAnd, moreover, the downward world that was the bottom of the Great\r\nValley, was full of monsters, as was told in the little metal book. And\r\nthe monsters were very strange and unknown; and foreign to the whole\r\nworld, that had never come unto the deep of the Valley. And the Valley\r\nhad come, as you shall mind, when the earth did split; and this thing\r\nwas, in truth, like to be thought that same Ending of the World, which\r\nall Nations have been taught to believe shall come. For in verity, when\r\nthe world did split and burst, and the oceans rushed downward into the\r\nearth, and there was fire, and storms, and a mighty chaos, surely it was\r\nproper to think that the End had come. Yet was it, in truth, but the\r\nbeginning of hope of a new Eternity of Life; so that out of the End came\r\nthe Beginning, and Life out of Death, and Good out of that which did\r\nseem a dire matter. And so is it always.\r\n\r\nYet doth this go past my first wonder, which did concern the wherefore\r\nthat they made not to descend in Things of Flight. Yet, maybe, shall my\r\nreasons stand to show why this was not.\r\n\r\nAnd again, mayhap it did chance that some were wild adventurers, and did\r\nleap over the edge of the upper world, having to ease their flight\r\ncertain contrivings, like to parachutes. And these you shall picture, as\r\nthat you watched them to leap; and so shall you see them go downward\r\ninto the gloom; and you shall see them for maybe ten miles, and maybe\r\nfor twenty miles; and afterward shall they be lost utterly in that Great\r\nDeep, and seen no more of any man for ever.\r\n\r\nBut when the Nations became Road-Makers, and came downward slowly to the\r\nmonstrous Deep of the Mighty Valley that did split the World, then were\r\nthey come there by millions, and with power sufficient to fight against\r\nthe Beasts; and afterward to grow back again to an ancient Civilizing;\r\nand so to the building of the great airships that were yet shown in the\r\nGreat Museum of the Pyramid. And here shall I cease from these my\r\nthinkings on this matter; for indeed, who shall say what did be truly a\r\nReason for those peoples and what was their Need? And so do I come to no\r\nsurety by my wonderings.\r\n\r\nYet, as you do know, all things do seem verily to go in a circle; for,\r\nbehold, in time, they of the Mighty Pyramid, were likewise held off from\r\nthe glory of the airships; and so were gone backward a great way,\r\naccording as we do look upon this matter. And so hath this been the way\r\nalways, as you shall know who have studied and thought, and seen the\r\ntrue ways and goings of Life.\r\n\r\nAnd now will I go forward in my telling; and here will set down a sure\r\nthing that I did perceive, both by mine ears and by my fingers; for, as\r\nI did make clear to you but a while gone, there had come a change into\r\nthe air as I did go downward of the Mighty Slope; and truly I was come\r\nto a great and new Deepness, even beyond that of the wondrous depth\r\nwhere did stand the Last Redoubt. So that I was afar down and in a\r\nmonstrous night. And the air here was of a great thickness and\r\nabundancy, even as it might be the air of this our Age; or maybe more or\r\nmaybe less; for who may compare two matters with a sure guessing, that\r\ndo have an eternity to keep them asunder. And because that the air was\r\ngrown very strong and apparent, it shall be, mayhaps, that it was by\r\nreason of this thing that the water, when I did make it, did fizz upward\r\nin a moment very loud and plentiful, and did boil overward to the earth\r\nfrom out of the cup, and wet upon my hand. And surely this thought did\r\ncome very keen to my Reason, as I did fumble, each time of mine eating,\r\nthere in the everlasting night and lonesomeness of the Great Slope.\r\n\r\nAnd so shall you have knowledge now of this and that thing which did\r\ncome upon my thought, and of the little and the big wonders, and all\r\nshall help something to give unto you the ache of newness and\r\nbewilderment that was constant companion unto me.\r\n\r\nNow by this time, as I have said, I was gone downward ever for six great\r\ndays; and I did seem as that I should presently come to the middle of\r\nthe world; for of going downward there was no end.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when it did be that I was near ready to believe this, I\r\nperceived far off in the deep of the night a little shining that was yet\r\nweak and unsure. And I do not know whether I can truly give unto you the\r\ngreat astonishment and pain of hope that did come upon me; so that I\r\ngrew sick in all my being but to behold once again the blessedness of\r\nlight, and to have help unto my belief that I went not downward to an\r\nutter desolation.\r\n\r\nAnd I stood upward from my knees, and did look very earnest, and surely\r\nit did seem that a light was there afar downward in the night; and again\r\nit did seem that I must be plagued by my hopes and by my fancy, and that\r\nthere was nowhere any light. And then again I did see it very clear, and\r\nnot to be mistaken, and I had a shaking to come upon me, and I gat me to\r\na run, and made a great and mad speed down the dark slope. And lo! I was\r\nnot gone any way, but I went headlong, and near brake myself; and could\r\nbut hold my teeth together very fierce and quiet until that the pain was\r\nsomething gone from me.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I gat me again to mine hands and knees, and went slowly,\r\nas before; and so for a great hour or more, and did look oft; and alway\r\nthe light became more plain to my sight; but ever to come and go,\r\noddly-wise. Yet did I go six hours, before that I was come anywise near\r\nto it. And by this shall you know how great a space off it had been. And\r\nlo! when that I did seem surely anigh unto it, truly was it still far\r\naway in the night; and I came not indeed near to it until that I was\r\ngone onward again for three hours more. And all that time did I yet go\r\ndownward into the night; but the Slope now did not be so utter dark.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, I made a pause, and stood upward to my feet, so that I\r\nshould the better perceive the light. And lo! as I did look toward it, I\r\nheard a faraway sound in the dark, as that something did set up a\r\nstrange and monstrous piping in the night. And immediately, I went to\r\nmine hands and knees among the stones of the Slope, and kept myself low\r\nin the darkness, so that I should be the less plain to be seen, did any\r\nMonster approach.\r\n\r\nBut there came nothing to trouble me, and I went downward of the Slope\r\nfor yet another hour; and all the time that I did go, the sound of the\r\npiping grew more in the great eternity of the night upon the Slope.\r\n\r\nAnd by this time was I come truly near unto the light; but yet did not\r\nbehold it plainly; for it did burn beyond certain monstrous rocks that\r\nstood between. And I went to the left for, maybe, the half of a big\r\nmile; and all the while that I did go, the piping made a mightier\r\nwhistling in the Night; and it did seem presently as that the earth sent\r\nforth the sound and revelry of wild roarings. And I went the more\r\nsilent; and later did kneel among three rocks, and peered forth for a\r\nwhile upon the place before me.\r\n\r\nAnd now, being come nigh unto the light--though yet it was not unhid\r\nfrom behind the great barriers of the uprising rocks, I perceived that I\r\ncrouched within the mouth of a mighty gorge; and the left side was a\r\ngreat way off, and I saw it plain at whiles when the light did rise; but\r\nthe light was to the right, and it was so wondrous great that it did\r\nmake clear to me that a mountain was to that side of the gorge, and\r\nwent upward into the everlasting night, as it did seem for ever.\r\n\r\nAnd afar down the gorge, I did see the shinings of strange fires, faint\r\nand a great way off. And so was I come at last to the bottom of the\r\nMighty Slope. Yet the gorge also to go downward, but not so great.\r\n\r\nAnd presently I did go forward again; and so did open the point of the\r\nrocks, as the sailors do say. And I saw now that there gushed forth a\r\ngreat blue flame from the earth; and the mighty rocks stood about it, as\r\nthat they were olden giants groupt there to some strange service.\r\n\r\nAnd concerning this flame I was not overmuch astonished in my Reason;\r\nfor it had seemed to me as I drew anigh, that the fire and the sound\r\nshould be made by the roaring and whistling of a burning gas that did\r\nissue forth among the rocks. Yet, truly, though it did be a natural\r\nmatter, it was yet a wondrous sight, and set amazement on my senses; for\r\nthe flame did dance, and sway whitherward monstrously, and sometimes did\r\nseem that it dropt so low as an hundred feet, and afterward went upward\r\nwith a vast roaring unto the utter height, and did stand mighty and\r\nblazing, maybe a full thousand feet, so that the far side of the gorge\r\nwas lit, and surely it was seven great miles off or more; but yet did\r\nshow plain and wondrous. And the light did show me the flank of the\r\nmountain, that made the right hand side of the Gorge, to go up\r\nmeasureless into the night.\r\n\r\nAnd so shall you perceive that I stayed awhile among the rocks that were\r\nin the mouth of the gorge, that I should gaze upon this thing; but\r\nafterward I lookt this way and that way, so that I should have a knowing\r\nof the place where I was come.\r\n\r\nAnd it was a wild and stark and empty place, as you must perceive. And\r\nthe far side did be great miles off, as I did say; and everywhere there\r\nwas abundance of rock and lonesomeness. And before me there went the\r\ngreat and dim length of the gorge, and there were lights here and lights\r\nthere, in a great distance, and oft--as it did seem--the quiet dancing\r\nof lights in diverse places; but yet were these gone on the instant. And\r\never there was a strong and vacant silence upon that place.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, after that I had looked once more unto the mighty dancing\r\nflame, and perceived nowhere any life around it, I went onward down the\r\nquiet gorge. And for a great way as I journeyed was my path lit by the\r\ndancing of the blue flame; and oft should I seem to be going but dimly\r\namong the rocks, and my shadow faint and long; and lo! the flame would\r\nleap, and all the gorge come to a wondrous brightness, and my figure to\r\nshorten, and the shadows to be black and strong. And so shall you\r\nperceive how I went.\r\n\r\nAnd oft did I turn me about to behold the dancing of the Great Light;\r\nfor it was solemn to my spirit, even amid so much of Greatness and\r\nEternity, to think upon that Flame, and to conceive that it had an utter\r\nage danced there at the foot of the Mighty Slope, unseen, through\r\nlonesome Eternities. And this I do tell unto you; that thereby may you\r\nhave some knowledge of the strangeness and the bitter loneliness of that\r\nplace; which, in verity, did seem the expressing of all the lonesomeness\r\nof my wanderings.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time as I did go downward of the great Gorge, there sounded\r\nthe blast of the roaring, that was presently afar to my back; and the\r\nmountain sides did catch it here and in that place, and sent it offwards\r\nwith strange and improper echoings, as of a chill piping, or oddwise as\r\nhushed whisperings of monstrous creatures; so that I did oft stoop to\r\nhide a little among the boulders; for truly I knew not but that some\r\nunnatural thing called from the darkness of the mountain side.\r\n\r\nAnd for six hours I walked onward thus, and sometimes did hide, having a\r\nsudden fear, as I have told.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, in a great while, the roaring was sunk to a far and\r\nmonstrous piping; but in the end to no more than a far and uncertain\r\nwhistling, that yet did catch strange echoes in the night. And in the\r\nend there was only a quietness. And yet, as you do perceive, there had\r\nbeen always a silence in that Gorge, as I have told, and this to the\r\ndespite of the whistling. And I do hope that you have understanding with\r\nme in this matter; for it was truly as I have told, and there is no\r\ncontrariness of telling in this matter.\r\n\r\nNow in all this time that I had walked in the great Gorge, I had past\r\nfour of the far lights that I did see from the bottom of the Slope; and\r\nthe two first and the fourth were blue, but the third was green; and all\r\ndid dance and quake, and sent fitful shinings into the belly of the\r\nGorge. And there came also from them whistlings, and from the second one\r\na low and strange moaning noise; and I doubted not the gas did come\r\noddly and with trouble. And I past these things with no great thought;\r\nfor truly they were no matters for notice, after that which I had\r\nbeheld.\r\n\r\nNow, as you shall mind, it was surely in the early Third of the seventh\r\nday of my journey down the Mighty Slope that I saw the first shining of\r\nthe monstrous gas fountain; and from that time until now had there past\r\nmaybe sixteen hours. And, as you do wot, I had eat not in all my travel\r\nsince that I had seen the light; so that I was gone to a proper lack\r\ninward; and moreover, it was full nineteen hours or more since that I\r\nhad slept; and all that while had I laboured.\r\n\r\nAnd I ceased me from wandering, and lookt about that I should come to a\r\nsafe and proper place for my slumber; and this I saw very quick; for\r\nthere was dry stone and rock everywhere, and no failing of holes and\r\ndiverse places to my purpose; so that I was soon in a little cave\r\nbetween two mighty boulders.\r\n\r\nAnd here I eat four of the tablets; for truly so many were my due, and I\r\nhad not been violent had I eat more. And afterward, I made some of the\r\nwater, and it did fizz up in a moment; so that I perceived that but a\r\ngood pinch made a great cup-full. And this I set to the count of the\r\nstrong and heavy air, as I have told, which I did think to have a\r\ngreater power of chemistry.\r\n\r\nAnd presently I slept, having my gear about me as ever, and the Diskos\r\nto my breast. And as I went into slumber, I thought sweetly upon Naani,\r\nas I had done, indeed, an hundred times since I was come to the\r\nhopefulness of the lights of the Gorge.\r\n\r\nNow, whilst I slept, I dreamed that the Master-Word did presently beat\r\nall about me in the night. Yet, as I do mind, I waked not; and because\r\nthat I continued to sleep, I have no sure knowing whether this was truly\r\na dream, or an Happening. And I minded me upon it, when I waked; but\r\nthis was after that I had slept seven hours; and I could have no\r\nsureness anywise of the matter; but only that I was come safe through my\r\nsleep; though heavy within my head and limbs, as that the air did call\r\nme unto a further slumbering, as is like enough.\r\n\r\nAnd after that I had eat and drunk, I put my gear about me, and the\r\nDiskos to my hip, for I needed both my hands to the task of journeying\r\namid the great boulders. And I set forth again down the half-light of\r\nthe mighty Gorge, and through eighteen hours I made a strong going, save\r\nwhen I did pause at the sixth and the twelfth hours to mine eating.\r\n\r\nAnd by the eighteenth hour was come, I was very ready to my food and\r\nslumber; and presently I was asleep in a place of the rocks. And that\r\nday had I past three and twenty of the dancing gas fires; and five been\r\nlike a white fire; but the others blue and green. And all did dance and\r\nmade a strange and uncertain light within the great Gorge; yet was it a\r\npeaceful thing unto my spirit that there was truly light, as you shall\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nAnd I slept six hours, and waked, and did want more sleep, as you shall\r\nthink. But I eat and drunk and put my gear upon me, and went on downward\r\nof the Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd at the sixth hour, after that I had eat and drunk, I came to a part\r\nwhere the big gas fires did cease to dance, and there was a certain\r\ndarkness upon that place. Yet was it not a proper dark; for there came\r\nthe glimmer of a flame here and the glimmer of a flame there, as that\r\nlittle flames came upward between the stones, and did vanish, and come\r\nupward in another part. And so did light and die out constant and\r\nforever amid the stones and the boulders of that lonesome Gorge; and\r\nmade a low-spread light, so that it did seem unto me that strange\r\nshudders of light beat upward through the dark of that place.\r\n\r\nAnd I went onward, and a heavy fume did seem to hang in the air, and\r\nhorrid gases to come upward from the earth in odd puffings; and anon a\r\nlight would leap upward beyond the next stone, and afterward vanish, and\r\nthere would be an hundred thousand such upon every hand, running to and\r\nfore; and afterward for a moment an utter dark, and again the little\r\nflames everywhere; so that it did seem I went one moment amid the heart\r\nof a strange country of fire, and immediately through a country of utter\r\nnight. And this was to me strange and a peculiar matter. Yet, as I do\r\nthink, the gases did bother me the more; for they did seem as that they\r\nwere like to hurt mine health utterly; for, in verity, oft did I seem as\r\nthat I should choke and breathe no more, by reason of the poison that\r\ncame upward from among the stones and the boulders.\r\n\r\nAnd all that time, as they came or went, did the little flames make\r\nsmall phlocks of sound in the Gorge as they did flash or die; and the\r\nsounds did seem, to my likening, as stones cast into an utter silent\r\npool; for they but made apparent the everlasting quiet of the Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I came beyond this place, and you shall see me going very\r\nlonesome among the rocks of the Gorge, beyond. And by this, it was come\r\nnigh unto the eighteenth hour; and I did find a place proper to my\r\nslumber, and did eat and drink, and was quickly gone over unto sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd here, I should tell how that I had not an over-fear of Evil Powers\r\nwhilst I was in the great Gorge; for truly it did seem as that nothing\r\nthat ever did live came anigh to that wild and silent place of stone and\r\nrock; but that I journeyed through it alone, and was surely the first\r\nthat did go that way for maybe a million years. And this feeling that\r\nwas upon me, I do hope you to perceive and take unto yourselves, and\r\nthus have an understanding of my heart at that time.\r\n\r\nAnd as you shall know, I went always unto slumber with sweet and with\r\ntroubled thoughts of the Maid. Yet, for a great while, I had been put so\r\nmightily to the labour of my way that my heart did suffer less at this\r\ntime than should be thought; and truly it doth show me how I was drawn\r\nunto that One with all my being, that I did surely think so oft and\r\nsweetly upon her amid so many perils and matters of horror. And this\r\ndoth seem something strange to say, when that you do consider that I was\r\nadventured unto these same perils and horrors but only for the sake of\r\nthe Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd in six hours did I wake, as I did strive alway to set myself to do;\r\nyet was I very heavy and slow for a little, until that I was more\r\nproperly come to wakefulness. And surely, as I did think before, this\r\nwas like to be put upon me by the weighty air of the place; but yet it\r\nmight be that the gas which did float in the Gorge was upon my lungs.\r\nAnd also, as you have perceived, if but you have attended my way, the\r\nair was grown warm, and oft were the rocks pleasant to the seat, and all\r\nof these matters did contrive to make me slumbrous.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, the gas fires did cease utterly in the Gorge, and I\r\nlookt downward, along that great place, and saw only a greyness, but\r\nabove the greyness there was, as it did seem, something of a vague and\r\nruddy shining in the night. And this did wake me to wonder what new\r\nthing lay before; so that I grew more eager among the boulders.\r\n\r\nAnd, later, when I had eat at the sixth and the twelfth hours, and gone\r\non awhile, I came to a place where the Gorge made a quick turning unto\r\nmy left, and at the end of the turning was a red and glowing light that\r\nwas very great and wonderful; so that I was utter keen to come to that\r\nplace, that I should discover what made the shining. And the place where\r\nI was come then, was very dark, because that I was nigh under the mighty\r\nwall of the mountain of the right side of the Gorge. Yet above, as it\r\ndid seem to me, there was a far red upward glowing in the night.\r\n\r\nThen did I go forward very fast, and presently, in a good while, I\r\ndiscovered that I drew near to a second great turning, that went to the\r\nright. And about the seventeenth hour, I came nigh unto the second great\r\nturning. And here did I put caution upon me, and crept for a while among\r\nthe dark rocks of that place, that I should come to a sight of that\r\nwhich made the monstrous red shining.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I was beyond the corner of the mountain, and did look\r\ndownward into a mighty Country of Seas, and the burning of great\r\nvolcanoes. And the volcanoes did seem as that they burned in the Seas.\r\nAnd the country was full of a great ruddy light from the volcanoes. And\r\nso shall you perceive me there among the rocks that did all stand upward\r\nstrange and bold and silent in the red and monstrous glare of the light.\r\nAnd I, as it did seem, the one thing of life in all that desolation and\r\neternity of rock and stone, there in the end part of the great Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd I peered forth into the wonder of the light, and was full of\r\nthrillings and fancies that I was surely come to the place where the\r\nLesser Redoubt had been builded. And immediately I knew that this was\r\nnot so, for surer had not Naani told how that they were in a land of\r\ndarkness. And if this did be so, truly, how wondrous and dread a way had\r\nI yet to go, if that this Country of Seas and mighty volcanoes stood\r\nbetween.\r\n\r\nSurely, it did seem to me then as that I must wander searching unto the\r\nworld\'s end. And so shall you be company unto me there with my trouble\r\nand my thoughts, and the immediate wonder and strange glory of that\r\nmighty Country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE DARK PYRAMID\r\n\r\n\r\nNow in two hours more I was come clear down out of the Gorge, and stood\r\nin that Country; and for all that I did feel fresh troubled and\r\nbewildered, yet was I rejoiceful, as you may believe, in the surprising\r\nlight and splendour of that sudden Land.\r\n\r\nAnd before that I had come down out of the great Gorge, I had stood high\r\nwithin the mouth thereof, and lookt well out over the mighty Country.\r\nAnd I had counted seven and twenty great volcanoes, and this doth not\r\ntake heed of two monstrous ranges of fire-hills that burned afar off,\r\nsomething unto my right. Neither doth it take account of an hundred\r\nthousand lesser places of fire.\r\n\r\nAnd truly it did seem a very land of fire and water. For there was a\r\nsmall fire-hill stood within a sea, as it did seem no more than a little\r\nmile from that place where I did stand. And maybe a score to the back of\r\nit, spread all about. And here shall I do proper to tell concerning the\r\nseas. For there were of these, that I did count at that time, three that\r\nwere small, and a mighty sea that went onward for ever into the red\r\nlight of the fire-hills, so that it was gone utterly out of my sight,\r\nand did show no ending.\r\n\r\nAnd there rose up out of the seas, islands; and on the islands,\r\nvolcanoes. But in other parts the fire-hills did come upward straightly\r\nfrom the sea. And over the near sea, as it did seem, there lay a\r\nplentitude of steam, as that the sea did boil at whiles and in diverse\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nAnd there did seem to me, as it were within the red atmosphere of that\r\nplace, as that there were a muttering thunder, low and constant, shaking\r\nthe air, now from that distance and now from this, and this did I judge\r\nto be the voices of the fire-hills, speaking with the fire that lived in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall conceive how utter new was all this unto me; for there was\r\nin that Country a constant Voice of the Energy of Life, so that the\r\nWorld-Noise of this our Age was even there again, and with a keen and\r\nundoubted apparentness; and the more so some ways, than now.\r\n\r\nAnd here shall I set down more closely the things that were ready to my\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\nAnd first, that it did much attract me, there was a huge and blackened\r\nmountain unto the left of the mouth of the Gorge, and the mountain did\r\ngo upward into the night, maybe fifteen and maybe twenty miles. And\r\nthere was a mighty peaked volcano that grew out from the side of the\r\nmountain so high up as five miles, as I did guess that height; and this\r\nwas upon the far side. And above this there was a second, maybe nine or\r\nten great miles up in the blackness of the night that hung afar upward.\r\nAnd, as that this were not great wonder enough, there did burn and glow\r\ntwo other mighty fire-hills, at an utter height, upon the left crest of\r\nthat black mountain; and these were upward so monstrous a way, as that\r\nthey did seem to make strange and smouldering suns within the night. And\r\ntruly, as you shall perceive, this was a wondrous thing.\r\n\r\nAnd below these upward fire-hills there rose up from the earth vast\r\nmountains of ash and burned stuff, that had been cast forth by these\r\nperched volcanoes, and had poured downward unto the earth throughout\r\nEternity, and so to build grey and sombre monuments unto the dreadful\r\nglory of Time.\r\n\r\nAnd to my right there was always sea and sea and the red blazing of the\r\nfire-hills; but unto my left, there were mighty forests, and there rose\r\nupward here and in that place, as that they were beyond the great woods,\r\nmonstrous fire-hills. And so do you take from me something of that first\r\nimpressing upon my brain and sense.\r\n\r\nAnd after that I had come down out of the mouth of the great Gorge, as I\r\ndid tell a little while gone, I came upon a pause; for, surely, which\r\nway was the way proper unto my search. And I lookt about for a great\r\nwhile, and afterward did climb back into the Gorge, and called myself\r\nfoolish, that I had not thought to map my way ere I came down.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was come up into the Gorge again, lo! I saw that there was\r\nbut one way that I should go; for truly, as I have said, there was only\r\nthe seas unto my right; but unto the left, where the shores did meet the\r\nseas, there seemed, so far as mine eyes did tell to me, a clear way for\r\na space. And mayhap, when I had come so far, I should even find a\r\nfurther way to go forward. And so did I descend again unto the Country\r\nof the Seas, as I did ever call that red-shining country of water and\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nAnd by, that I was come again from the height of the Gorge, it was four\r\nand twenty hours since that I did last sleep; so that I was fain that I\r\nshould put into some nook, and come to slumber, as you shall well\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nAnd I found me a neat and proper place, where three great trees grew\r\nabout a little basin of rock that was very dry and warm. And here, after\r\nthat I had eat three of the tablets, and drunk some of the water--the\r\nwhile that my belly did yearn, as ever, for proper eating-stuff--I made\r\nmy bed in the little basin of the rock, and lay me down, and did begin\r\nto think awhile upon Naani; but was gone over to sleep before that I was\r\naware.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I was suddenly awake, and did find that I swam in a hot water;\r\nand a mercy, I did think, was it that I was not drowned as I did sleep.\r\nAnd I gat me to my feet, and the basin was full of water, hot and\r\nsteaming, and pungent to the taste, as well I did know. And I perceived\r\nnow that the water poured in from a smoothed slit upon the far side, and\r\ndid come with a strange gurgling and bubbling, so that I conceived some\r\ndeep well to boil, and thus to drive upward this water into the basin;\r\nand glad was I that it did not boil as it came forth.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, now that I was upon the dry land, and did consider, I did\r\nquickly suppose that the water had poured forth at seasons into the\r\nbasin for an eternity of time, and afterward did go back by fissures in\r\nthe bottom of the basin; and this to happen, as I soon did find, a\r\nlittle beyond the length of every hour; and, indeed the basin to empty\r\nslow as I did watch.\r\n\r\nNow, being much wetted, I stript off mine armour, having before this\r\ndipt out mine effects from the hot pool, and so did come down to the\r\nnaked flesh, and I found a place where the rock was hot, and here I did\r\nspread my garments. And whilst that they came to dryness, I gat me into\r\nthe hot pool, and had a very pleasant bathing, and did have no great\r\nfear of any dangerous thing; for, as it did seem, I had surely left all\r\nsuch behind, within the Night Lands. Yet did I have the Diskos upon the\r\npool edge to my hand; for I had no proper assurance in this matter. Yet,\r\nas it did prove, there were many monstrous beasts in that Country; but\r\nnever did I feel the nearness and horrid power of any Evil Force; for\r\nthese, as I do conceive, were congregate and gathered about the Mighty\r\nPyramid, being attracted thereto by the great spiritual essence of so\r\nwondrous a multitude of humans gotten so close in one spot, even as\r\nsharks do come after the ship that hath bullocks within. Yet, how that\r\nthe Evil Powers were given entrance unto this State of our Life, I have\r\nno sure knowing; yet have I put forward certain thoughts on this matter\r\nin an earlier place; and more than such thinkings is surely vanity; for\r\nthere is no certainty in my Reasoning concerning the thing.\r\n\r\nNow, presently was my clothing dry, yet before this, I had come out from\r\nthat bath, which truly was nigh all gone backward into the earth. And I\r\ndressed me again, and got my armour upon me, and afterward was I in a\r\nmore lightsome state of the mind; and yet very ready to come again unto\r\nmy sleep. And this I did, and had six hours more beside the pool; and\r\nonce was wakened somewhat by the gruntling and bubbling noise of the\r\nwater, that was made as the pool did fill time and again.\r\n\r\nAnd when the six hours were gone, I waked very well fitted in my senses\r\nand feelings to go forward again through that red-lighted Country, and\r\nthis I did, after that I had eat and drunk.\r\n\r\nNow all that day I went forward at a great pace; and the nameless woods\r\nwere unto my left, and the shores of the seas unto my right. And oft did\r\nI find that the trees grew even into the water, so that oft did I go\r\nforward among the trees, and a very wonderful thing was this to me, that\r\nnever had known before in all my life, until I was come into that\r\nCountry, how that a glad and wild mystery doth live among forest trees.\r\nFor there was no such strange wildness among the groves of the\r\nUnderground Fields; though a solemn beauty in plenty. And the scent of\r\nthe woods was sweet unto my spirit, as you shall wot.\r\n\r\nNow all the time that I did go, there was the shore unto my right; but\r\nalway to my left, and around me oft-times as I did say, the great\r\nforests. And as I did go, lo! there was life in all those darksome\r\nwoods, and living eyes did peer out odd whiles upon me, and afterward go\r\nbackward into the dark; so that I wotted not whether to fear, or to have\r\nno heed of trouble. Yet naught did come anigh to me, to make any hurt.\r\n\r\nAnd thrice in that day did I come to little fire-hills that burnt redly,\r\nand sent out fire and noise, so that I heard their trouble each time\r\nthrough the forest, before that I was come to them. And about each was\r\nthere a deadness and desolation, where the fire had killed the big\r\ntrees; yet, as I did observe, the quick life of little plants did grow\r\nmore nigh, as that they were born and lived between the times of the\r\nfire-bursts. And this I do take it that you perceive.\r\n\r\nAnd in that one day I past thirty and seven boiling springs; but whether\r\nthey boiled truly, I do have no knowledge; only that they sent out a\r\ngreat steam oft-times; and some did make a strong roaring noise; so that\r\nto hear them afar off in the forests was to think odd times that some\r\nwild beast roared strangely.\r\n\r\nNow, when the eighteenth hour was come, I sat me down, as I had done\r\nupon the sixth and the twelfth hours, and eat two of the tablets, and\r\ndrank some of the water, which here did fizz very rich and quick.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward I lay down to my slumber, for I was greatly wearied. And I\r\nhad chosen a place against a great rock, which was so that no creature\r\nmight come upon me from behind. And I came easy upon sleep; but yet I\r\ndid fix it upon me that I slumber only with the body; for I did know, by\r\nthe shining of the eyes in the darksome woods, that strange creatures\r\nabode in the mighty forests.\r\n\r\nAnd ere I was gone over to sleep, I thought upon Naani, as I had done\r\nmuch all that day, as though her spirit did hover near unto mine, and\r\ndid strive pitiful to speak with me. And this I set out to you, that you\r\nshall know how it did seem unto me in my thoughts and fancyings. And as\r\nI lay there, I put a blessing upon her, and a determination into my\r\nheart that I make a more desperate speed of my going, if that might be;\r\nso that I come the sooner to that strange, and unknown place in the dead\r\nworld where did stand the lesser Refuge. And I was then asleep in a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! sudden I was awake. And lovely was the brightness of that\r\nCountry, that did show me in a moment my danger, and did not keep me\r\nsuspend in fearful Doubt, as did the grey darkness and strange shadows\r\nand lights of the Night Land. For I saw, on the instant that I got me to\r\nmine elbow, how that certain things did crouch within the borders of the\r\ntrees, no more than a score paces off. And I perceived in a moment that\r\nmy spirit had been given knowledge, and had wakened me. And I stared,\r\nthe while that I did grip the Diskos; and I saw that there were six\r\nsquat men that were humpt at the neck and shoulder; and they did crouch\r\nall there in a row, and were something hid by the shadows; and I\r\nperceived that they watched me; and the eyes of the men did shine like\r\nthe eyes of beasts; and so shall you know somewhat of the strange terror\r\nthat came upon me. Yet had I the Diskos and mine armour; and though my\r\nheart did shake a little, yet was my spirit assured to conquer.\r\n\r\nNow I gat me to my feet, and had the Diskos ready within my hand; and\r\nbehold! I could not see the Humped Men, for they were gone from that\r\nplace; yet never did I see them go, though I had kept my gaze very\r\nsteadfast upon that part where they did hide. And, as you shall\r\nunderstand, I was near ready to believe that there had been nothing\r\nthere within the border of the wood; yet truly I knew that the men with\r\nthe humps had been there, as I had seen.\r\n\r\nNow, I looked presently, and found that I had slept five hours; and I\r\neat two of the tablets, as I did stand there, watchful; and afterward\r\ndrank some of the water; and so was ready to go forward again; for I was\r\ngrown very anxious to be gone from that place; and did have no knowledge\r\nbut that those strangely humpt Men were but a little way off, among the\r\ntrees, and might come upon me in a moment; or, further, that they did go\r\nto call an army of other humped men to my destruction.\r\n\r\nAnd after that I was ready, and had my gear secure upon me, I set off at\r\na great stride, and did hold the Diskos very handy, and lookt this way\r\nand lookt that way, and all the while made onward with speed; for,\r\ntruly, I was grown so lean and hard that it did seem to me that I had\r\npower to out-pace those men or aught else of their kind.\r\n\r\nAnd all that day, through thirty great hours did I go forward, at that\r\nstride, and did always watch; and at every sixth hour, I eat two of the\r\ntablets and drank a little of the water, and went onward again.\r\n\r\nAnd so did I hope that I was lost from those Humped Men. Yet, though I\r\ndid hope, my faith was not this wise; for twice and thrice did it come\r\nto me that there went things through the woods to my left all that day,\r\nand did keep always to a level with my speed; yet were always hid. And,\r\nas you shall believe, this did be a very shaking thing to my heart, and\r\ndid make my hope of but little account.\r\n\r\nNow, because that I had no faith to company my hope, I was not easy to\r\nhave slumber, until that I was come to a place proper and safe. And so,\r\nas I have told, I went onward through thirty great hours; and, in truth,\r\nin all that while I did find nowhere that did seem to fit my need.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! about the end of the thirtieth hour, I perceived that there was\r\nwater ahead, besides the water of the sea that was ever to my right. And\r\nI thought, maybe, that the sea did go inward at that part of the land;\r\nbut it was otherwise; for when I was gotten to that place, I found that\r\na river came into the sea, and did come out of all the country that lay\r\nunto my left.\r\n\r\nAnd in the mouth of this river, there was a small island; and surely I\r\ndid look across to the island, and think it a refuge from the Humped Men\r\nthat did surely play dog upon my going. Yet, truly, this was but an idle\r\nthought, and my need was that I should come to some way to cross over\r\nthe river, that I go forward beside the great sea, which did stretch\r\nonward, as it did seem for ever, before me upon the far side.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew not how to go across; for I had no power to swim, and had I\r\nswum, there were surely monsters in that great and warm-flowing river,\r\nas you shall believe.\r\n\r\nAnd I went upward of the river-bank, that I might come to some place\r\nwhere the river did narrow; and surely I had been like to walk a mighty\r\ndistance to this purpose, but that I came soon to a second river that\r\ndid enter the first, not a mile above the shore of the sea; so that, as\r\nyou do perceive, there was the sea to one side of me, and this second\r\nriver unto the other, and the first river before me; and thus was I\r\nsorely perplexed, as any had been truly that was in a like trouble.\r\n\r\nYet, as it did chance, the need to go forward, and the danger of the\r\nHumped Men, put wit into me, so that I lookt about for a tree that was\r\nfallen. And there were many, yet great, so that I was much wearied and\r\nsomething strained of the spirit, before that I gat two little trees\r\nunto the water.\r\n\r\nNow, when this was done, I made me a rough pole of a young tree-plant;\r\nand afterward, I lashed the two trees together with my belts and straps,\r\nand so had somewhat of a raft.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall picture that, all the time as I did go about this\r\nbusiness, I was very heedful lest the Humped Men should come upon me,\r\nere that I was gone free upon the water. And this constant heeding did\r\ndouble the labour of my work, as you shall perceive; yet, in the end, it\r\nwas done, and I ready to adventure over the river.\r\n\r\nAnd so I did push off with the pole, and I pusht and paddled maybe the\r\nhalf of an hour, for, indeed it was all a clumsy contriving, and mayhap\r\nI the more so in my labours. Yet, presently, I was come so far over,\r\nthat I drew nigh to the island; and it did seem a wise and proper thing\r\nthat I should have my slumber there, and afterward go onward to the\r\nfarther shore. And this I did; and after that I had eat and drunk, as\r\never, I lay down to sleep. And by this time it was three and thirty\r\nhours since last I did slumber; so that I was bitterly awearied.\r\n\r\nAnd I had a great and restful sleep; for, truly, the island did seem a\r\nvery safe place; and, in verity, I came to no harm, though I was as a\r\ndead man for nine great hours; and so shall you perceive my weariness.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was come proper awake, I eat two of the tablets, and drank\r\nsome of the water; and afterward made an end of my voyage, and then did\r\ntake back my belts and straps from binding the trees, and so forward\r\nagain upon my way, and no more fearful of the Humped Men; for, surely, I\r\ndid think I had left them all upon the far shore of the river; though\r\nafterward I minded me that they might grow likewise upon the two sides;\r\nbut yet was I only discovered by those upon the one, as you do know.\r\n\r\nAnd all that day I went very swift, and past many strange matters and\r\ndid coast upon wonders oft. And at the sixth and the twelfth hours did I\r\neat and drink, as ever; and between the eighth and the fourteenth hours\r\ndid I come past two mighty fire-hills, that made all the Country to\r\ntremble with their noise. And four times did monstrous creatures pass by\r\nme; but I was swift hid, and came to no harm.\r\n\r\nAnd oft as I did go, were my thoughts upon the dear Maid that I\r\njourneyed to save from destruction. Yet, as you must see, always were my\r\nthinkings brought sharply unto my going; so that scarce was I ever set\r\noff to ponder upon Naani, but that there came some danger or wonder to\r\ngive me heed to my way. And because of this, as you have learned, I was\r\nmore put to plan free of the instant trouble and peril of my way,\r\nthrough all that mighty journey, than to have quiet chance for thoughts\r\nof love unto mine Own. Yet, truly, was not my journey one whole thought\r\nof love unto Naani? And, that peril made oft dumb my brain, was but the\r\ntruer song unto my Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd at times I was among trees; but oft did go past unnumbered boiling\r\nsprings and small fire-hills; and oft was the air full of the noise of\r\nthe little fire-hills, and the roar of the boiling springs; but there\r\ncame no harm unto me.\r\n\r\nAnd a thousand times did I perceive things that had life; and I made a\r\nvery cautious way; though with a great speed and cleverness of going\r\nthat made my heart glad.\r\n\r\nAnd oft did I come to parts where a great life held the trees, and green\r\nstuff did flourish exceedingly, and the air rich and full and wondrous\r\nsweet; so that I was fain to think how that in some far-off time, it\r\nmight be that our children\'s children should come down unto this\r\nCountry, when the Upper Valley of the Night Land was grown to an utter\r\nchill and lacking of air; and here build them a new Refuge, if, indeed\r\nany should come clear of the Evil Forces and the Monsters that did live\r\nabout the Mighty Pyramid in the Night Land. Yet, how should they come\r\nclear of those things; so that this is, as you do perceive, no more than\r\na thought that did rise vaguely in me. And yet, again, who shall say\r\nwhat may be?\r\n\r\nAnd onward I did pass, and I do mind me how that I saw the lower fires\r\nof that Country to burn very fierce; and this I set to the richness of\r\nthe air; but yet with no surety of knowledge; and do but tell the same\r\nthat you shall see the oddments of thought that went oft across my\r\nbrain, and so have so much knowledge as I, concerning this and that.\r\n\r\nNow, a little before the eighteenth hour was come, I came out from among\r\nthe trees, and the sea was downward of a great cliff unto my right, for\r\nI had gone upward for a long and weary hour. And I did see now a thing\r\nthat made me to be cautious, and yet that did hold my heart to go\r\nswiftly to perceive the thing; for it was very strange.\r\n\r\nAnd I went forward quickly, yet with a wise care; and so was come\r\npresently more nigh. And I perceived that the thing was, in part, a high\r\nrock, very tall and pointed and maybe an hundred feet high; but\r\nafterward I did find it to be more. And there was a monstrous great\r\nthing upon the top of the rock, that did seem very strange; and I stopt\r\nand lookt, and afterward went forward again; and so for a time, until\r\nthat I was but a little way off. And now I saw that there did seem to be\r\na mighty long rock laid across the topmost part of the upstanding rock,\r\nand yet had a very strange and shapely appearance; and did seem upon the\r\nunderpart to be as that I had lookt before upon it. And upon the upper\r\npart, there grew trees and green things, even as these did grow upon odd\r\nledges of the upstanding rock. Yet, for the most, the rock was very\r\nstark, as that a blast had blown upon it, and made it bare.\r\n\r\nNow, when I had lookt for a while, I bethought me that this should be a\r\nsafe and proper place for my slumber, if that I had power to come safe\r\nto the top. And when I had thought this thing, I began at once to climb\r\nup the rock; and I found that the rock was very high; so that in a while\r\nI was come a great way off the earth, and yet was not come to the top of\r\nthe rock. And because that I was awearied, I lookt about for a safe\r\nplace to mine hand, and lo! there was a shelf of the rock very nigh,\r\nthat went inward a little to the side.\r\n\r\nAnd I gat me to this ledge, and did eat and drink, and presently I\r\nslept, and scarce had thought of Naani in the moment of my slumbering;\r\nfor a great weariness was upon me, the which I do think to have come by\r\nreason that I was not yet proper rested from the task of the day that\r\nwas gone before that one.\r\n\r\nNow I waked very sudden, maybe seven hours after; and I had knowledge\r\nwithin me that my spirit did wot of some nigh danger. And I gat upward\r\nfrom the rock, very quiet, and had the Diskos ready in my hand. And I\r\nlookt swift about me in the moment that I did wake; yet did see nothing;\r\nfor there was naught on the ledge with me.\r\n\r\nAnd I crept to the edge, and lookt downward, and lo! I did see that\r\nthere came up the rock two Humped Men; and they did climb very swift and\r\nsilent; and I perceived that they smelled me, and came to destroy me.\r\nAnd I made ready the Diskos to do battle, and ceased not to look\r\ndownward. And I saw how that the Humped Men did seem to be humpt by\r\nreason of their being so monstrous thick and mighty of the neck and the\r\nshoulder, as that they had been human bulls. And I saw that they were\r\nvery strong, and by the speed of their climbing, I knew they were swift;\r\nand so did I make steady my attention and my heart to the saving of my\r\nlife; for truly I did know that I should be dead in a little, or they.\r\n\r\nNow I stept back a space from the edge of the rock, and had the Diskos\r\nvery ready; for it was needful that I should kill one of those brute men\r\nspeedy, that I have no danger that one take me in the back, whilst that\r\nI fight with the other.\r\n\r\nThen, in a moment it did seem, there came upward of the rock edge, the\r\ngreat and brutish face of the man. And in that moment that I slew him, I\r\ndid note curiously how that he had large teeth upon each side of the\r\nmouth; and was aware that he had come so quiet as a great cat. And in\r\nthe backward parts of my brain, I bethought that even thus, maybe, was\r\nprimal man, so that a strange and secondary questioning and wondering\r\ndid live in that part of me; and I did learn from these scarce conscious\r\nreasonings that I was of belief the thing was truly a man; but very\r\ncrude and dangerous. And surely it is strange that I had all this\r\nthought in that little moment; but in verity so it was; though I doubt\r\nnot but I bettered it with after thoughts, when a while had gone.\r\n\r\nNow the first man died ere his great haired breast was come upward over\r\nthe rock; and he sank back, and sagged and fell dully, and I heard him\r\nbodge downward from rock to rock, very lumbersome; and so in a moment\r\nwas silence.\r\n\r\nThen did I look this way and that way of the ledge; for the second Humpt\r\nMan was not yet upon me; and I feared that the pause did mean a cunning\r\nmischief and strategy. And when a little time had past, and all the\r\nwhile I was ready with the Diskos, and naught did come upward to harm\r\nme, I stept very soft to the edge of the rock-ledge, and lookt downward;\r\nbut there was nowhere any thing to see.\r\n\r\nNow, for a little moment, I did think that the brutish man had run off,\r\nbeing feared by the death that I did deal unto the first; yet I put this\r\nfrom me at once; for I did wot that such a creature did not be like to\r\nfear in such wise; but was rather set to some horrid cunning of attack,\r\nas I did fear, and was somewhere below me among the holes of the great\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nThen I did think sudden that he might be gone upward, so that he should\r\ncome down upon my back, and I lookt upward of the mighty rock; but did\r\nsee naught; and afterward I stoopt forward a great way beyond the edge,\r\nso that I should perceive whether the man did hide beneath. And, behold!\r\nhe was there below me, and crouched under the rock-shelf, ready to his\r\nspring. And in that moment, he made unto me with so mighty a leap as any\r\ntiger should give. And he came half over the edge, and gript the Diskos\r\nby the handle, in an instant.\r\n\r\nAnd surely I had lost that trusted weapon, or been pulled over and cast\r\ninto the depth, but that the Diskos did spin, and the Earth-Current did\r\nmake live the handle--as was intended--save where the "grip" was set.\r\nAnd lo! the man gave loose the handle very swift, for it had burned and\r\nshaken the creature sore. And I staggered back, with the effort I had\r\nmade to withhold the Diskos; and the brutish man came upward again over\r\nthe rock edge, and leapt at me. Yet he gat me not; for I sprang unto my\r\nright, and made a blow with the Diskos, even as I did leap. And the blow\r\ncame something short; but yet harmed the Humpt Man with a gash upon the\r\nbelly, very sore and horrid among the great brown hairs of the man. And\r\nimmediately he sprang after me; but I smote full at the face; so that he\r\nleaped back from the strange roar and blaze of the Diskos, and yet was\r\nharmed; for he gat not right free of the blow; but did be cut very sore\r\non the mighty and haired arm.\r\n\r\nNow, seeing that he was something feared of the weapon, I ran in upon\r\nhim, and smote again at the face; yet was the man gone out of my reach\r\nbefore that the blow did reach; for, truly, he was quick as a panther.\r\nAnd immediately, he did leap unto the ending of the ledge, where it did\r\njoin upon the Rock; and he caught the living Rock between his two hands.\r\nAnd truly the Rock must have been splitten there; for he tore out a\r\nmonstrous lump, so great near as my body; and did run upon me with the\r\nrock above the head of him.\r\n\r\nNow, I perceived I should be smashed in a moment, if that I did not slay\r\nthe man very quick. For so mighty was he, that he did leap this way and\r\nthat way after me, as though the great rock did cumber him no more than\r\nit had been but a light matter.\r\n\r\nAnd you shall perceive that I leapt this way and that way, to avoid the\r\nman; and twice did strike him; but yet was feared to brake the Diskos\r\nupon the rock, which the man did use as a shield each time that I did\r\nmake a blow. And all the while, I did act to escape when that the man\r\nshould cast the rock, as I did conceive at the first to be his intent.\r\nYet, truly, it was as that he had no wotting that a rock may be thrown;\r\nfor he strave only to come at me with the rock, that he should crush me,\r\nas with a monstrous club. And, in verity, what should a man do against\r\nso horrid an attack.\r\n\r\nAnd time and oft did I leap now to the right and now to the left, and\r\nagain in a moment, I did cut the Humpt Man; but the blow was something\r\nturned off by the great rock in the hands of the man; yet so strange and\r\nmighty was the power of the Diskos, that it shore away a small portion\r\nof the rock, and did come to no hurt in itself.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely I had presently failed in wind and limb, because of the\r\nleapings and chargings that I did make; and because of the weight of the\r\narmour, that was not overmuch, yet to be considered; but that I fainted\r\nnot, was by reason of the wondrous hardness and leanness that I was\r\ngrown to, with so constant a journeying and strait living; for the\r\ntablets did keep the strength in a man, though, truly, they eased not\r\nthe yearnings of the belly.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! even the brutish man did grow weary, and the hot breath and\r\nbody-stink to come from him; and surely who shall wonder, for always he\r\ndid rush to and fro upon me, with the monstrous rock to crush me. And\r\nsudden, I leapt unto the right of the man, thinking within me that I did\r\nperceive a chance that I should cut him upon that side; but, truly, he\r\nwas less awearied than I did know; for he came very sharp upon me, and\r\nhad me between him and the wall of the Rock; and surely I had no room to\r\nmake escape, and had died in a moment, but that I made a sudden sham\r\ntoward the left with the Diskos, as that I should leap that way. And in\r\nthe same instant, I did go to the right with a strong bounding; and\r\nimmediately did come in upon the Humpt Man from that side; and I put my\r\nfortune of life to the stroke, and stood anigh to the man, and I smote\r\nhim across the middle part, before that he did wot of my intent. And the\r\nblow slew the man very surely, and did nigh cut the mighty creature in\r\ntwain. And surely he fell, half leaping even as he died, so that the\r\nmonstrous rock that was in the hands of the brutish man, did crash down\r\nalmost upon my feet, and I leapt very high that I should escape the\r\nthundering of the rock; for in verity, I was near slain in that last\r\nmoment of the life of the Humpt Man. But yet I lived and came free of\r\ndeath, and did have a relief of happiness about my heart, as you shall\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nYet, truly, I was much shaken; and a little weakness took me, so that I\r\nwas fain to go down upon the rock-shelf, that I have back my strength.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I was grown steady again, and I took my gear, and did\r\nhaste down the Rock, and so was come presently to the earth again. And I\r\nsaw the first of the Humpt Men that I did slay, lying very quiet a\r\nlittle off from the bottom of the Rock; so that I went round upon the\r\nother side to avoid the man; for it was no pleasure to mine eyes or to\r\nmy heart. And, truly, it did trouble me always to make a death.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was come round upon the other, which was the seaward, side of\r\nthe Rock, I perceived that I was yet shaken; and I remembered that it\r\nwere wise to eat and drink and rest a little, before that I did go\r\nfurther upon my way.\r\n\r\nNow, as I did sit there at the bottom of the Rock, I looked upward at\r\nthe strange crown thereof; and until that time, I had been taken up with\r\nthe fight and with gazings this way and that to see whether there came\r\nothers of the Humped Men to work me an harm.\r\n\r\nBut now that I was given some ease of the mind and of the body, I saw\r\nplainly that I knew the thing that lay upward upon the Rock; for the\r\nshape had been something strange and half-known to me even before that\r\nmoment, as that I had a vague knowledge concerning it; but yet with no\r\nsurety. And now, truly, I did know in a little instant that the thing\r\nwas one of the olden flying-ships, the which, as you shall mind, there\r\nwere certain in the Great Museum of the Mighty Pyramid.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I was ready to wonder why that I had not seen the thing\r\nplain before that moment; yet was this like to be because that there was\r\na shadow upon the other side of the great Rock; but upon this side there\r\nwas a little fire-hill a way off to the cliff edge, and this did throw a\r\nwarm light that made a glimmer upon the dull metal of the ship\'s bottom,\r\nwhich was uncovered to my sight, and was surely of that same deathless\r\ngrey metal that made the Great Redoubt.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as you shall believe, even as I said this thing to my mind,\r\nthat the strange matter upon the top of the Rock was truly one of the\r\nolden air-ships, I did feel that I should be proper to doubt; for it was\r\na very wondrous thing to perceive a thing common to man, in that utter\r\nstrange Country, and after that I was gone so far off from the Mighty\r\nPyramid. Yet, in verity, I did know in my heart that it was indeed that\r\nwhich I did perceive it to be; and I did stand and walk to and fore and\r\nlook upward constant; for I was very keen that I look well upon it.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, as I did look from this place and from that place, it was\r\nscarce a thing for wonder that I had not wotted it to be an air vessel;\r\nfor there were great trees and abundance of earth and living matters\r\nupon the topmost side of the ship; so that none could easy perceive it\r\nto be aught save a great and desolate rock that did lie upon the other\r\nrock. Yet, truly, it was as I have told; and presently I did make to\r\nclimb upward of the great Rock, that I should come to the air vessel to\r\nenter it. But yet was this not proper; for I had surely no duty save to\r\ngo forward forever, until that I found the Maid; but yet did I spend a\r\nlittle while to this searching of the ship; and I do but set down that\r\nwhich I did, and with a serious spirit. And truly, as it doth here occur\r\nto me, I do be ever seeming a serious young man, as you maybe shall have\r\ngrown to think; but yet was I to a dread and serious business, and the\r\nstrain did be too great upon me and the trouble too much prest upon my\r\nheart to give me much of laughter, as you do surely perceive, and so you\r\nto give me your ear and your understanding. For, indeed, before that I\r\ndid lose Mirdath my Beautiful One, I was not over-grave; but so young\r\nand joyous as any.\r\n\r\nNow it took me a great time to go upward of the Rock; for it was so\r\nmonstrous steep and high. Yet, presently was I come nigh under the\r\nbottom of the ship; and here I did perceive that she had been sore\r\nbattered in that far-off age when she did come upon the Rock; for,\r\nsurely, as I did perceive, the peak of the Rock was through the bottom\r\nof the ship, so that the metal was burst this way and that, and very\r\nplain to be seen in some parts; but in other places the earth and\r\ngrowing matters did make a hiding.\r\n\r\nAnd after that I had climbed this way and that way, I perceived that I\r\nmust come to the topmost part by the plants that did hang over, and grow\r\ndownward. And after that I had pulled upon them, to know that they were\r\nstrong to hold me, I went upon them, and was soon to the top of the\r\nship. Yet, truly, I might so well have been upon the earth; for the ship\r\nwas covered above by the earth and dust of a monstrous age of years; so\r\nthat I was like to need much time to dig downward unto the ship; and\r\nbecause of this, I considered a little while, and afterward made no more\r\nto search her; but did go downward again, that I should come once more\r\nto my journey. Yet, as you shall think, it was with a queer thrilling of\r\nthe heart, and with strange thoughts upon the end of those that did\r\ncome, maybe, to a bitter and lonesome dying in that ship of the air, in\r\nthat far-off time when she did fly.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, it did seem to me as I went downward of the great Rock, how\r\nthat the flying-ship had been there for an hundred thousand years; and\r\nthat mayhaps the sea did live all about the Rock in that Age; and truly\r\nthis was no improper thing to think, for it was like that the sea had\r\nbeen monstrous high and great in those days; so that the Rock was but a\r\nlittle island in the midst of the sea; and now was the sea gone small\r\nfrom a great sea to lesser seas, and this through an eternity of years.\r\nAnd always, as it doth seem to me, had the ship lain upon the Rock, and\r\nlookt quiet and silent over the change and wonder and the lonesomeness\r\nof all that Country of Fire and water, for ever.\r\n\r\nBut how the air-ship did come upon the rock, how shall I know; save,\r\nmaybe, it doth seem as that she might have flown low over the sea in\r\nthat olden age, and come hard upon the Rock, because, maybe, there was\r\none to the helm that did steer unwittingly. And again, it shall well be\r\notherwise, and I do but set down mine odd thoughts; and such as they be,\r\nthey have no especial use, save that they do show to you the different\r\nworkings of my mind at that time, as I did go downward. And so to set\r\nyou the more in possession of all that I did have knowledge of.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I was come again to the earth, and did go forward with a\r\ngreat speed, so that I should waste no more of that day. Yet, oft did I\r\nthink upon that ship hid there upon the mighty Rock, under the wondrous\r\nquiet ashes of eternity.\r\n\r\nAnd I went eighteen hours walking, and in all that time I did see no\r\nmore of the Humped Men; yet three times was I put in a sudden danger,\r\nfor there went past me thrice, between the fourteenth and the\r\nseventeenth hours, great flying monsters, that were winged very ugly,\r\nand did go, as I thought, in a great bounding, rather than that they did\r\nfly proper as doth a bird. Yet I suffered no hurt from these; for I was\r\nswift to hide between the great boulders that were very plenty in that\r\npart; but no trees. For I was gone now past the forests of trees; there\r\nbeing none since that I had gone through a very shallow river, that I\r\ncame to about the thirteenth hour. And this had I waded, and sounded my\r\npath with the staff of the Diskos; but I had kept mine armour upon me,\r\nlest there be things, even in water so shallow, that might bite and work\r\nharm upon me. But I gat through pretty quick, and had no hurt done me.\r\nNow I had eat, as ever, at the sixth and the twelfth hours; and by that\r\nthe eighteenth hour was come, I was nigh again unto a forest, that came\r\ndown to the shore that went alway upon my right; and I to be very sore\r\nand wearied, as you shall know; for I had fought very desperate after my\r\nwaking, and afterward climbed the great Rock, and then again to journey,\r\nso that it was, by this, nigh to one and twenty hours since that I did\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I lookt this way and that way, constant, and did see no\r\nplace proper to my slumber. But afterward, I considered I did be a fool,\r\nto lack such; for truly the trees were plentiful, and I could climb a\r\ngreat one, and strap my body safe, and so have a sure bed for my rest.\r\nAnd I did this thing, and went upward into a great tree, and did tie my\r\nbody to the tree, with my belts; yet I eat and drank before that I went\r\nup the tree.\r\n\r\nNow when I was fast upward in the tree, and had made a bed upon a\r\nmonstrous branch, and had the Diskos ready upon my hip, so that it\r\nshould not fall but be nigh to my hand, I lay a little while thinking\r\nupon Naani; and I went not over to sleep immediately, which was strange;\r\nyet mayhaps because that my bed was so uncertain.\r\n\r\nAnd I considered very gravely how that it was a monstrous long while\r\nsince that I did hear the Master-Word from the dear Maid; and truly I\r\nwas come a dreadful way from mine home, which was the Mighty Pyramid;\r\nfor I had gone onward for ever through five and twenty great days of\r\ntravel, and was not yet come to any place that did appear like to be\r\nthat place where the Maid did abide.\r\n\r\nAnd it did seem that I might even wander onward in that great Country of\r\nFire and Water for a time beyond all that I had before gone; and this\r\nthought did put a great weight of trouble and weariness upon my heart;\r\nfor the Maid had been in sore need of me, and I did feel sudden to be\r\nall adrift in the wilderness. But before this time, it had seemed as\r\nthat I surely went aright. And mayhaps your sympathy shall tell you just\r\nhow I to feel in the heart.\r\n\r\nAnd after that I had lain there very awkward, and thought upon all\r\nmatters, I minded me that I would try the compass again upon the morrow;\r\nbut had no great hopes of the machine; yet did be willing to try aught\r\nto see where I had gotten to. And truly, as it did come to my mind, if\r\nthat the compass did point a little as I did wot it was used to point in\r\nthe Lesser Redoubt, then, in verity, I was surely come something more\r\nanigh to that unknown place of the world than I did dare to believe. And\r\nthis to be plain to you.\r\n\r\nThen a little time did pass in which I did wake and sleep, and wake and\r\nsleep, a little; but with no surety of sleep; but as that I was very\r\ntired of the heart, and did but lie too wearied to come properly to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nAnd odd whiles I did lie with mine eyes half to open, and did look very\r\ndreamful upward among the dark branches of the tree, as they did show\r\nblack and pretty against the redness of the shining that came from the\r\nsea; for there was stood a great and bright-burning fire-hill in that\r\npart of the sea that lay off the shore from me. And above the glaring of\r\nthe fire-hill, there was the deep night that did brood for ever above in\r\na monstrous black gloom of eternity, and did make the red smoke of the\r\nvolcano to show deep and mighty and thunderous-seeming, afar up in the\r\ngreat dark. And the red and shining smoke did but show the utter\r\nhugeness of the night, that had been upon the world through the great\r\nages.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, as I did lie there so dreamful, it did come to me afresh\r\nhow wondrous strange was mine adventure; and how that I did lie warm and\r\nalive in a Country of red light and smoking seas. And, truly, as I did\r\nremember and consider, there was a great and lost world above me, upward\r\nthrough the dark ... maybe an hundred and fifty great miles up in the\r\ngrim night.\r\n\r\nAnd this thing did strike me very solemn, as I did lie; and I do trust\r\nthat you conceive how that there was, in truth, afar above in the\r\neternal and unknown night, the stupendous desolation of the dead world,\r\nand the eternal snow and starless dark. And, as I do think, a cold so\r\nbitter that it held death to all living that should come anigh to it.\r\nYet, bethink you, if one had lived in that far height of the dead world,\r\nand come upon the edge of that mighty valley in which all life that was\r\nleft of earth, did abide, they should have been like to look downward\r\nvaguely into so monstrous a deep that they had seen naught, mayhaps,\r\nsave a dull and utter strange glowing far downward in the great night,\r\nin this place and in that.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, as you shall have seen, I have set the Great Deep of the\r\nValley to be, maybe, an hundred and fifty miles of night; for, as you do\r\nmind, it was conceived that the Valley of the Night Land was an hundred\r\nmiles deep, and mayhap to be more; and I had come from that Place\r\ndownward of the Mighty Slope, and of the Gorge, a very great way. Yet,\r\nin verity, I do believe in my heart this measuring was utter wrong; for\r\nI think the deep to have been monstrous, beyond these miles that I do\r\ngive; yet have I no proving of this belief, and do set it down for no\r\nmore than it is.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, I had ceased from these vague thinkings and half\r\ndreamings, and was gone truly to sleep. Yet, nowise did I sleep very\r\nstrong; but did seem to come anigh to wakefulness, this time and that.\r\nAnd, as it did chance, this was mayhaps a very good thing for my life;\r\nfor I did presently come awake more surely, and did turn on the great\r\nbranch; for there was a noise in the air, that was not the noise of the\r\ngreat fire-hill.\r\n\r\nAnd the noise did grow, very heavy and lumbersome. And, in a moment,\r\nthere came seven Humped Men, running among the trees, as that some\r\nmonstrous thing did pursue. And immediately they were beneath the tree\r\nin which I did lie; so that a great fear came upon me, and I loosed the\r\nbelt from the branch, that I should be free to fight.\r\n\r\nAnd, directly upon this, I saw that the men did leap upward into the\r\ntree, beneath me; but not as that they did wot of me or make to come at\r\nme; but as that they did pay a great heed to some creature or happening\r\nthat was far off among the trees. And surely, the noise did seem to come\r\nfrom that part, and did grow loud and mighty, and the Humped Men did all\r\ncrouch very silent, and did make no noise or motion one to the other;\r\nbut were quiet upon the lower branches.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I did look now more to my ease, I perceived that they had each a\r\ngreat stone, and bloody, that did seem as that it were split to a\r\ncertain sharpness, even as a stone doth break very natural. And they\r\ncarried the stone under this arm or under that arm, so that they had\r\ntheir hands free to all matters.\r\n\r\nAnd, alway the noise did come the more anigh, and I saw that a Humped\r\nMan did come running from among the trees, and did run beneath that\r\nplace where the seven Humped Men did be on the branches. But they made\r\nno sign to the man, to save him; yet truly it was very plain that some\r\nmonster pursued the man.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately I saw how this thing was; for the Humped Man upon the\r\nground, did not run so fast as might be; and I conceived that he did act\r\nto make some creature to come after him, to pass under the men within\r\nthe tree. And surely this thing did prove to be; for there came very\r\nquick, a great and ugly thing, that had an ugly way of putting down the\r\nfeet, and did have seven feet to each side, which was very strange; and\r\nthe back was as that it were horny, and the belly of the thing did seem\r\nto brush heavy upon the earth, and it grunted, as it went, and shook the\r\nearth with the weight of it; so that a monstrous noise came from it,\r\nupon so hasty a journey. And I did wot that it was not such a thing as\r\ndid properly pursue after matters of food; but did rather eat of that\r\nwhich did need little haste, but a monstrous strength, to gain. And that\r\nit did so make after the man, was in truth because that it had been\r\nwounded and made fierce; for, indeed, there came blood from the creature\r\nfrom great wounds upon the back; but how these were made, I could not\r\nknow in that instant.\r\n\r\nAnd it did go under the tree in which I was hid; and in that moment when\r\nit past under the tree, the seven Humped Men did leap out of the\r\nbranches, and did catch to the brute by the great horns of the spine;\r\nand I saw that the wounds were in the joints of the spine, as was plain\r\nwhen the back did work, with the going of the creature. And the seven\r\nHumped Men took the sharp stones from under their arms, and did strike\r\nvery brutal in the wounds that were in the joints of the spine; and the\r\ncreature roared and cried, and went onward into the trees at a great\r\nspeed; and in all the time that it ran, the Humped Men ceased not to\r\nstrike with the stones.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden, when it was gone a distance off, it did roll very swift over\r\nupon the back, first to the right, as that it would go that way; so that\r\nthe Humped Men did leap off upon the other side. And immediately the\r\ncreature rolled to that side; and there ran clear of the brute only four\r\nof the Humped Men; so that I knew that three were slain. And afterwards,\r\nthey that lived, ran beyond the beast, and gat up into a second tree,\r\nand the one that was chased, did entice the creature to follow, and so\r\ndid tease it once more to pass beneath the other men; and they very\r\nswiftly again to the back of the creature; and so from my sight,\r\nstriking with the great stones, and the beast bellowing very loud and\r\npiteous. And how many of the Humped Men there were to the beginning of\r\nthat strange hunting, I know not; but surely there were few that lived\r\nto the end.\r\n\r\nAnd surely there were such things as this thing in the beginning of the\r\nworld, and again was it thus in the end; and I did ponder this a little\r\nwhile, as I did sit upon the great branch, and hearken unto the sound of\r\nthe hunting, that was now gone a great way off, and was presently beyond\r\nmy hearing.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I gat me to the earth, and did look this way and that\r\nway, to see that no beast was anigh, neither any of the Humped Men; and\r\nafterward, I eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had gat this far to a readiness for my going, I minded me\r\nthat I should try the compass again, as I did intend. And surely the\r\nmachine did point between the North and the South, upon the Westward\r\narc, even as Naani had told unto me; yet, as it did seem, with somewhat\r\nmore of a Southward pointing than she had made me to think. And because\r\nof this telling of the compass, a great ease came upon my spirit; for,\r\nsurely, was not this but a sure sign that I did go direct unto that\r\nhidden place of the world where the Lesser Refuge did abide; but yet was\r\nnot come over-close, so that the pull of the Mighty Earth-Current of the\r\nGreat Redoubt was something stronger than in the place where was the\r\nLittle Pyramid.\r\n\r\nAnd all this did I think very swift to myself, and had a glad uplifting\r\nof the heart, as you do perceive; so that I went forward upon my\r\njourney, with a great stride, and did scarce fear any strange thing that\r\nall the Country did hold, in that moment.\r\n\r\nAnd I went all that day at a strong pace, and did be oft tempted to send\r\nthe Master-Word unto Naani; yet did keep from so foolish an acting, the\r\nwhich, mayhaps, had brought straightway upon me an Evil Power, and had\r\ngiven me to Destruction when that I was near come to the succour of the\r\nMaid. And it was this quick and constant fear of the Evil Forces of the\r\nNight Land, that did keep me ever from calling unto Naani, lest that\r\nthey should discover me, and follow after; and this, I doubt not, you to\r\nknow by now so well as I.\r\n\r\nNow, by the sixth hour, I was come into a part of the Country where\r\nthere were an exceeding abundance of steam fountains and sprayings and\r\ngreat upboilings of water in basins of rock; and the air did be full of\r\nthe sounds and the roarings of the boilings and the spoutings, and of a\r\nhot mist and spray; so that, truly, I had scarce the power to see to my\r\nfront, nor to any side.\r\n\r\nAnd here, presently, I made a pause, and did eat and drink, and\r\nafterward went forward again; and I did keep the shore of the sea always\r\nto my right, and so did go proper to my way; yet with no great ease; for\r\nthe sea also did steam very strong in that part, and because of this\r\ngreat fog of steam, I was surely much laboured to make a great speed,\r\nlest unseeing I go headlong into an hole of the boiling water.\r\n\r\nAnd in the ninth hour, I did go clear of the hot boilings, and was come\r\nagain free of the mist and the steam, and might look with mine eyes to\r\nmy going. And, surely, as I did perceive, I was come to the end of the\r\ngreat sea that had been ever to my right; for it did go against the feet\r\nof great and monstrous mountains, that went upward for ever into the\r\nnight, and did seem as that they were the hither wall of that strange\r\nCountry of Fire and Water. And so was I stood there very much taken upon\r\ndoubt; for how should I go farther.\r\n\r\nAnd after that I had been there a while, in a bewilderment of doubt and\r\nof wit, I went to the left, along the feet of the mountains; and truly\r\nthis but of common sense; for how might I go any other way, save I go\r\nback again!\r\n\r\nAnd at the twelfth hour I eat two of the tablets, and drank some of the\r\nwater, and went forward once more. And lo! at the fifteenth hour, I was\r\ncome to a place between the mountains, even an upward gorge, very dark\r\nand gloomy, and without light for a great way.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I did not want to go up the gorge, in that it was so\r\ndreary a place and narrow and horrid and drear-seeming, after the light\r\nand wideness of the Country in which I did yet stand.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I did go past the mouth of the gorge, that I should learn\r\nwhether there went another way out of that Country. And thiswise, for a\r\ngreat hour more, along the feet of the mountains, and did presently come\r\nto a monstrous black river, that was, maybe, a mile wide. And it to be\r\nvery shallow, and seeming as that the water scarce to cover the mud of\r\nthe bottom. And here and there a great steam did come from it, and\r\nspirtings and moundings-up of the mud in many places, and monstrous\r\nbabblings and puffings-up of strange smoke, as that a great heat went\r\nbeneath it in this place and in that.\r\n\r\nAnd surely it went backward into the country for a mighty way, so far as\r\nmy sight did go; and I did think it to be no river, but truly a further\r\nsea. And there was no way across; for there were no trees anigh, to make\r\nme a raft, neither might I wade across; for it might be shallow here and\r\ndeep there, and the mud be in all places. And, moreover, I had been like\r\nto be caught in one of those upburstings of mud, even did I have a raft\r\nto go upon. And because of all these things, I gat me back again to the\r\nGorge, and presently I did go upward into the darkness.\r\n\r\nNow, I went upward very steady, save that I did stumble oft, and did go\r\nthrough six great hours. And truly it did seem that I went in an utter\r\ndark, because that I had been awhile in so constant a light.\r\n\r\nAnd, by that I had been six hours in the Gorge, I was gone right away\r\nfrom the Country of the Seas, and did be as that I was back into some\r\nplace that was like to the dreadness of the Night Land. For there were\r\nin this place and in that place of the Gorge, red fire-holes, even as in\r\nthe Night Land. Yet not many until that I was come a great way up of the\r\nGorge. And there did be life of horrid things about the fires, as soon I\r\ndid wot; so that I made to keep off from them. Yet, as you shall\r\nperceive, I must come oft pretty near, because that the Gorge was\r\nnowheres scarce an hundred good paces across, and did oft come very\r\nnarrow, so that I did come oft anigh to the fire-holes, whether that I\r\ndid heed to or not.\r\n\r\nAnd all that time, and ever, did the Gorge go very sharp upward, so that\r\nit was a very weary thing to make great trial of speed, as you shall\r\nknow. But yet I went so fast as I could do; for I was grown sudden very\r\nexcited about the heart, and to feel as that I did surely draw anigh to\r\nthat strange and hid place of the world, where was the Lesser Refuge.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had gone upward through six great hours, as I did say, I took\r\ncaution for a place proper to slumber; for I was surely very wearied.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw a place presently, afar upward of the dark side of the Gorge,\r\nupon the right, where a ledge of the Rock did show in the glaring from\r\none of the fire-holes that made a gloomy light in that place. And I\r\nclimbed unto this ledge, and did find it to be secure, and awkward to\r\ncome upon. And presently, after that I had eat and drunk, I did compose\r\nmyself unto sleep, the which came very speedy upon me, whilst yet I did\r\nbelieve I thought only upon the sweetness of the Maid. And truly it had\r\nbeen something over three and twenty hours, since last I did sleep; so\r\nthat I was greatly awearied.\r\n\r\nAnd in six hours I waked and did eat, and did climb downward again to\r\nthe Gorge, and so unto mine upward journey.\r\n\r\nNow, as you do perceive, when that I was come properly a great way up\r\nthe Gorge, and had come among the fire-holes, there was no more an utter\r\ndarkness, for the dull red glare of the pits beat upward upon the black\r\nsides of the rock-mountains, that did make the sides of the Gorge; so\r\nthat oft I did see both sides very plain in the lower parts; yet of the\r\nheight of the Gorge, who might know aught; for the black sides did go\r\nupward for ever into the everlasting night.\r\n\r\nAnd because of the light from the fire-pits, I did see, time and oft\r\nabout the fires, horrid monsters, both that were snakes, and others like\r\nto scorpions so great as my head; but no more than these for a long\r\nwhile. And afterward I perceived that surely other matters did move\r\namong the rocks of the Gorge; so that I did keep the Diskos very ready\r\nin mine hand; yet had truly no use for it all that day.\r\n\r\nNow I eat and drank at the sixth and the twelfth hours, and went onward\r\nat a very strong speed. And at the sixteenth hour, I did seem as that I\r\nknew the aether to be stirred about me, and the beat of the Master-Word\r\nvery faint upon mine inward ear. And immediately, a wondrous great and\r\nlovely thrilling did wake all my being; for surely, I said, this was the\r\nspirit of my love, calling unto me with her brain-elements. And, indeed,\r\nthis was a very proper and sensible thinking; for had the Master-Word\r\nbeen sent from the Mighty Pyramid, I had been like to hear it very\r\nplain, by reason of the force of the Earth-Current which was with them\r\nand to their command. But, as you do know, the Earth-Current was nigh\r\ngone from the Peoples of the Lesser Refuge; so that they were over-weak\r\nto make any proper calling. And this I have spoken of before this place.\r\n\r\nYet, in a little while, as I did stand very hushed, that I should hark\r\nthe better, I was come to doubt whether that I did truly hear the\r\nMaster-Word. And one moment I did say that it had surely beat in the\r\nnight about me; and immediately would I be just so unsure; and so in a\r\nwhile I gat once more to my journey, and had doubt in my heart; yet, as\r\nyou shall conceive, more of hope. And because of this thing, I went\r\nonward for thirty great hours from the time that I did wake; for my\r\nheart was excited within me. And when that I had gone so long forward as\r\nthis, I did see how that I did foolishly; and I lookt about for a place\r\nfor my slumber; and I found a small cave that was clean and empty, as I\r\ndid discover by the shining of the Diskos which I made to spin a little\r\ntime. And the cave was in the cliff of the mountain that made the right\r\nside of the Gorge, and was nigh twenty good feet from the bottom of the\r\nGorge, and hard to approach.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was come secure into the cave, and sure that it was proper to\r\nmy purpose, I eat four of the tablets, as was just and nice to my belly,\r\nand did afterward drink some of the water, and so to my slumber; and all\r\nthe while, very sweet and strong in my thoughts upon Naani; so that\r\nsurely I was a little time before that I had myself rightly unto sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd I slept six hours, and did wake, for I had set my spirit hard unto\r\nsuch wakening; yet was I still greatly yearning for sleep. But this did\r\ngo somewhat, when that I had fought a little with my need. And\r\nafterward, I eat two of the tablets, and drank some of the water, and\r\ndid gat my gear upon me, and was presently down unto the Gorge; and so\r\nagain to my journey.\r\n\r\nNow in all that day I did go with a very stern speed; for it did seem as\r\nthat my soul did know for surety that I was truly come something nigh\r\nunto that hid place in the night where I should find mine Olden Love\r\nagain. And the sweet hope that was bred of the calling that had seemed\r\ntruly to sound about my spirit, was in all my being, and more sure on\r\nthat day, than before that I had slept.\r\n\r\nAnd I went thirty hours in all, even as before, ere that I did come\r\nagain to sleep, and I eat and drank at every sixth hour, so that my\r\nstrength should abide within me. And by that I was come to the ending of\r\nthe thirty hours, I was sorely awearied, and gat me upward of the\r\nmonstrous cliff that did make the left side of the Gorge, having\r\nperceived in a place a great ledge of the rock, that did seem very\r\nproper for my purpose of slumber.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was come upward upon the ledge of the rock, I saw that there\r\ndid seem something, like to a mighty spider, that did stay half without\r\nof a hole in the back part of the ledge. And I smote the thing gently\r\nwith the Diskos, so that it was very quickly dead; and afterward I\r\nsearched well about; but did gladly perceive that there abode there no\r\nother horrid creature.\r\n\r\nAnd I eat two of the tablets, and drank some of the water; and did\r\nafterward make me ready for slumber, as ever. But now I did put the\r\ncloak well about me; for truly there was grown a chill into the air of\r\nthe Gorge; and here also will I tell how that it did seem unto me that\r\nthe air was gone something from that great thickness and strength which\r\nhad been with me in the past days of my journeying.\r\n\r\nNow I was gone so tired, that I fell upon sleep in a moment, yet with a\r\ndear thought and anxious, concerning Naani; but was so starved of the\r\nbody for slumber, that even mine anxiousness kept me not awake. And I\r\nwas then so fast with sleep that I knew naught for eight hours of very\r\nsound slumber. And then did I awake, and very thankful of the heart that\r\nno evil beast or creeping thing had come upon me whilst that I was so\r\nutter lost in sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd now, truly, was I something fresh and ready; and I ate and drank,\r\nand had my gear once more upon me, and so down into the Gorge. And\r\nafterward, I went upon my journey for eighteen hours, and did pause but\r\na little while at the sixth and the twelfth hours that I should eat and\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nAnd when the eighteenth hour was nigh come, I perceived that the nature\r\nof the Gorge was grown very horrid and dank. And in verity, I did feel\r\nas that afar upward in the night the black mountains that did make the\r\nsides of the Gorge had come together, and did make a monstrous roof\r\nunseen in the utter height.\r\n\r\nAnd this thing I do tell, only as of my belief; for I have no very sure\r\nproof. Yet, truly, my reason doth say likewise; for there did oft drip\r\nwater upon me out of the darkness, even though I walked in the middle\r\nway of the Gorge; and how should this thing be, save that there went an\r\noverreaching of the sides, that should let the mildew down upon me.\r\n\r\nAnd in this place, and for more than eleven great hours, there were\r\nfire-holes and fire-pits only in this part and in that, and each a great\r\nway off from another. And they burned very dull, and did seem to throw a\r\nfume of sulphur into all the air, as that there was no freedom above for\r\nthe stink to pass away. And in every place were the rocks of the Gorge\r\nvery thick and slippery with strange growths; so that it was a sorrow to\r\nwalk upon them. And all that time was there an heavy wetness and\r\nslowness in the air; and a smell, beside the stink of the fire-pits, as\r\nthat I did go forward through a place where dead things did be.\r\n\r\nAnd for a great time there was a horrid darkness, as it had been that\r\nthe air was grown thick with the fumings of the fire-pits, as I do\r\nbelieve; and beside this thing there was, as I have said, but a dull\r\nfire here and another there; so that it was like that there should be a\r\nheavy dark. And because that it was so utter black, and because that\r\nthere were growths upon the rocks in the bottom of the Gorge, I did go\r\nbut slowly, and with pain of stumblings; and always with the stink of\r\nthat place to trouble me half unto a sickness.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden, as I did go past one of the fire-pits, I saw that the fire\r\nmade a dull shining upon some monstrous thing that did move before me,\r\nupon the far side of the fire. And I came in one moment unto a swift\r\nsilence, and hid among the rocks of the bottom of the Gorge. And I lookt\r\nvery cautious at the thing that moved beyond the fire, and surely I had\r\nseen no thing so monstrous since that I had come free of the Night Land;\r\nfor it was as that some huge Creature, like to the hull of a great ship\r\ndid move down out of the dark of the upper way of the Gorge. And it went\r\nby the fire-hole, and onward into the dark of the lower way of the\r\nGorge; and I had perceived somewhat of it, as it did go past the fire,\r\nand, surely, it was black and beslimed, and utter great in height and in\r\nlength, and it went always without noise, so that I had not known it to\r\nbe there, but that I saw it plain with mine eyes. And, truly, if I do\r\nsay that it was somewhat as that I had seen a monstrous slug-thing,\r\nsurely I should use wise and proper words to make known to you this\r\nhorrid brute.\r\n\r\nAnd I stayed very quiet a time, and afterward I went upward again of the\r\nGorge, and did use a new caution to my way, and saw that the Diskos was\r\nfree upon my hip; for even thus I did carry the weapon, being that I\r\nmust use both hands to my way, and to save me in my stumblings and\r\nslidings over the slippery rocks.\r\n\r\nAnd once it did seem to me that some great thing moved in the darkness,\r\nand I went downward among the rocks, and stirred not my body for a great\r\nwhile; and sure am I that there went some living monster past me, that\r\ndid stink as a loathsome grave. And afterward, I went on again.\r\n\r\nAnd three hours did I go thus, and came at last to a place where a\r\nfire-hole did shine more ruddy; and I did look well about me, that I\r\nshould perceive that part of the Gorge the better. And as I stood there,\r\nvery quiet, away off from the fire, so that it did show no great light\r\nupon my person, I did note how utter still was that place; and this to\r\ntake me anew, as though it had come fresh upon me. And here, there would\r\nbe the drip of water, and again in that place, and again elsewhere; and\r\nall very solemn and very dismal. And the silence to be constant.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, as I lookt, now to this way and again to that, I saw that\r\nthere was a monstrous slug-thing laid upward against the black side of\r\nthe Gorge, as that it had stood up on end; and the one end of the\r\nmonster went upward beyond the light from the fire-pit; but the other\r\npart did come down and trail into the Gorge, as a long hillock, very\r\nugly and black and beslimed.\r\n\r\nAnd I near sweat with a disgust and horror of the thing; but afterward I\r\nhad more courage, and spied well upon the brute. And surely, it moved\r\nnot at all, any more than the side of the cliff of the Gorge; and I\r\nconceived that it stood not upward upon any feet; but clung to the rock,\r\neven as you shall see a slug to go. And for a great space I was very\r\nquiet and moved not, neither did I make to hide, but stood there very\r\nstupid.\r\n\r\nYet, in a time, I had more of courage which brought strength unto my\r\nheart, and I began again to go upon my way, but with an utter caution,\r\nand I then to creep for a weary time upon my hands and knees among the\r\ndank and weariful rocks and boulders that lay in the bottom of the\r\nGorge. And thrice between four hours was I passed by hidden and\r\nmonstrous things in the horrid dark places of the Gorge; yet with no\r\nnoise, save, as it might be, the odd rattle of a rock in this place and\r\nthat; but with an utter and dreadful stinking. And I to be quiet as\r\nthey went, as you shall think.\r\n\r\nAnd each time now that I did go by the fire-pits and fire-holes that lay\r\nodd-ways in the Gorge, I did pause and search about me with mine eyes,\r\nvery cautious, and oft now did I perceive how that the monstrous slug\r\ncreatures did lie in this place and in that against the cliffs of the\r\nGorge. And I did go then utter still, from this space to that space\r\namong the rocks, and oft upon the flat of my belly, and with a constant\r\nheed that I make not mine armour to knock against the boulders.\r\n\r\nAnd always as I did go, there was a monstrous stench, and the choking of\r\nsulphurous smoke very oft. And here and there, as mine heart doth\r\nbelieve, there were utter great caverns within the mountains to the\r\nright and to the left; and of this thing I have some small proof; for\r\nonce I did go by a place where a fire did burn, as it should be a\r\nfire-hole, afar inward of the mountain side upon my right; so that I saw\r\nin a moment that I looked in the darkness through the mouth of a mighty\r\ncave-place; and I went past very quick and silent, for I knew not\r\nwhether any horrid thing should come forth out of that place to slay me.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, as I did think, if there did be one such place, there were\r\nlike to be many; and mayhaps the slugs came forth from those caverns,\r\nwhere, as I did conceive there was naught save an eternal dripping of\r\nwaters and the foul growth of things in all parts. Yet is this last but\r\na thought, as I do say, and you shall wisely take it for no more than\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nNow, I came clear of the darkness and the slime and the stinking in\r\nabout twelve hours after the time that I did think the mountains to be a\r\nroof unto the Gorge; and the air was now free and did seem as that some\r\nlife and health did abound in it; and the fires did be more plentiful,\r\nand burned very bright and clean, and threw all their fumings upward, so\r\nthat there was no more any bitter pain of sulphur within my throat.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, it was with a thankful heart that I went onward, and with a\r\ngood speed; for there was much of light all about me, in that there\r\nburned an hundred fire-pits here and in that place; so that I saw clear\r\nbefore me and behind, and conceived that the slugs did abide only in the\r\nclosed part of the Gorge. And oft I did take the air very full into my\r\nlungs, for the sweetness of it, after the horrid stenchings that I had\r\nabode all those hours.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, when I was come free of the roofed part of the Gorge,\r\nmaybe some three good hours, I lookt for a place proper to slumber; for\r\nit was surely something over three and thirty hours since that I did\r\nlast come upon sleep; and I was utter worn and lost of strength with so\r\nmuch of creeping and harking for monsters, as you shall believe;\r\nmoreover, about that time I had gone bitter long whiles between\r\nslumberings through more than an hundred hours, as you shall have\r\nperceived from my tellings.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, I saw a small cave that went inward of the side of the\r\nGorge. And I lookt into the cave, and found it to be sweet and clean,\r\nand very dry. And there was a small fire-pit off from the mouth of the\r\ncave that did throw a good light for my purpose; so that I saw there was\r\nno creeping thing or horror in the place; and I went in, and made to\r\nprepare for my slumber.\r\n\r\nBut truly, when I was come to look upon myself, I was utter soiled and\r\ndid seem as that I stank with the slime and disgust of the dark part of\r\nthe Gorge, where I had gone upon my hands, and upon my belly. And\r\nbecause of this, I was set that I should not eat or come to sleep,\r\nwithout I washed me.\r\n\r\nAnd I went out from the cave, and there was a spring near to the\r\nfire-pit, as was oft in that part of the Gorge. And the spring was hot\r\nand did fill a hollow of the rock, very quiet and with a fuming of\r\nsulphur, as I did bend above it. And I washed mine hands and face and\r\nmine armour and gear, in the hot spring, and did dry me with my\r\npocket-cloth; and so was sweetened and put to happiness of mind.\r\n\r\nAnd I went back into the cave, and did sit in the mouth of the cave,\r\nwith the Diskos to mine hand; and I eat four of the tablets, for I was\r\ngone a mortal long while without, and afterward I drank some of the\r\nwater. And as I did eat and drink, I lookt out upon the lightness of the\r\nGorge before me, and with a cheerful and composed heart.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw presently that there came certain creatures out from their\r\nholes, even as it might be that they were part rats; but very strange\r\nlooking, and not properly such. And some did lie about the fire-hole,\r\nand some did hunt about in the rocks; and one came presently, and had a\r\nsnake by the neck. And it stood upon the snake, and did eat it, even\r\nwhile that the snake did lash about upon the rock. And the snake did\r\nlash until that it was nigh all eat; and a very strange thing this was\r\nto see, and something troublesome to the pity. Yet was I glad to\r\nperceive that there were enemies to the serpents of that place.\r\n\r\nAnd when the rat creature did make an end of the snake, it made across\r\nto the spring, and did drink the hot water a while; and afterward back\r\nunto the fire, and there laid down anigh to the edge, and seeming very\r\nsweetly comforted of the belly, which, in truth, was much otherwise with\r\nme. And, after that, I saw many creatures that went about the fire, and\r\ndid have warmth from the fire and drink from the spring; and surely I\r\ndid ponder that the Peoples of this our Age should say, if they had\r\nstood with me, that Providence had made nigh together the warmth and the\r\ndrink that were needful unto life (for it was grown to a bitter chill\r\nnow in the Gorge). But rather did this thing seem to me otherwise, that\r\nthese creatures did be but of their circumstance, and if that it had\r\nbeen another way, then had they grown of their wits to meet it to their\r\nmeans of life. Yet, as some would say, the arguments do but meet, and be\r\nthe same thing. And neither way do I care in this place; but do no more\r\nthan to show unto you the working of my brain, in this way and that, as\r\nI made my journey.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, when I was done eating, and come very ready to fall upon\r\nsleep, I went out from the cave and gat me certain boulders, the which I\r\ndid carry into the cave. And when I was come back for the last time, I\r\nput them very secure in the entrance-way, that no small stinging\r\ncreature come at me as I slept. And after that, I made ready, and went\r\nto my sleep, having sweet thoughts and slumbrous, of the Maid.\r\n\r\nNow I slept very quiet that time, and was not over troubled with the\r\nchill of the Gorge, which was but little in that place, both by reason\r\nof the fire-pit and because that the cave did help to keep my warmth to\r\nme. And I had a deep slumber for eight hours, and waked then pretty\r\ntired, but strong to go upon my way. And after that I had sat a little\r\nwhile, I came full to wakefulness and afterward did eat two of the\r\ntablets and drink some of the water, the which I did, sitting in the\r\nmouth-part of the cave, after that I had cast free the boulders.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I gat my gear upon me, and I went again upon my journey.\r\nAnd the Gorge did continue very light and cheerful, with the shining of\r\nthe fires; and oft there did be a little steam that did hiss from this\r\npart or that of the bottom of the Gorge and did blow very quaint and\r\nnoisy in the quiet of that place. And oft there did be hot pools, and\r\neverywhere the great boulders in the bottom way, and to the right and to\r\nthe left the black and mighty sides of the Gorge that did go upward for\r\never into the everlasting night.\r\n\r\nAnd so I did go, and had eat and drunk at the sixth hour, and gone\r\nonward again. And, lo! at the eighth hour, I did thrill sudden with a\r\nwondrous great thrilling; for, in verity, it did seem to me that the\r\nMaster-Word did beat softly about me, out of all the night of the world.\r\nAnd all my heart did throb with great glowings of joy; yet was the beat\r\nof the Word unsure, so that I knew not truly whether my spirit had\r\nindeed heard aught, for there was immediately a silence, as ever, about\r\nmine inward being. Yet, as you shall believe, there was a new hope and\r\nstrength of courage in all my body and soul.\r\n\r\nAnd I went forward very swift, and all renewed, as it were; and my\r\nstrength and hope did make naught of any terror that should lie to bar\r\nmy way, neither did I have further heed of the boulders that lay always\r\nupon my path, but did go over them with quick leapings, and a wondrous\r\nand thrilling eagerness of the heart within me.\r\n\r\nAnd, sudden, in the end of the tenth hour, I perceived that the mighty\r\nwalls of blackness that made the sides of the Gorge did be no more\r\nthere, and that I was come truly upon the end of the Gorge. And I near\r\ntrembled with hope and astonishment; for when I was gone a little way\r\non, I had ceased to go upward any more, and was come clear out from the\r\nmouth of the Gorge, and did peer forth across a mighty country of night.\r\n\r\nAnd it did seem to me as that I was come to a second Land of Strange\r\nmatters, even as the Night Land where did lie the wonder of the Mighty\r\nPyramid. And surely, I did think within my heart that I was come at last\r\nto that far and hidden place of the world where did be the Lesser\r\nRedoubt. But yet was there no place in all that night where did tower\r\nthe shining lights of the Lesser Pyramid, the which I did hope vainly to\r\nperceive. And because that I saw them not, a great heaviness came upon\r\nmy spirits for a time; but afterward the heaviness did go; for I put\r\nReason to help my courage, and did plan this cause and that to show why\r\nthat I was not come to sight of the shining embrasures of the Lesser\r\nRedoubt. But yet was there left an ache of doubting, as you shall well\r\nconceive.\r\n\r\nNow this Land was very new and strange, and had a great light in this\r\npart, and a wondrous grim darkness in that. And I did pause a great\r\nwhile to determine how that I should go properly. And presently I\r\nbethought me of the compass, and did draw it forth, and set it upon the\r\nearth, that I should see how it did act. And truly it did go almost as\r\nNaani had told to me; so that I was very sure in all my being that I was\r\nin verity come anigh to the hidden Refuge. But yet did the compass give\r\nme no proper guiding to my way; so that I was no more wise to this end\r\nthan before, only that I had the comfort of that which it did seem to\r\nassure.\r\n\r\nAnd, in a little while, I went forward into the Land, and did hope that\r\nI should come presently to some matter to help my choice. And I went\r\nfirst toward a certain great glowing of fire that lay before me, and did\r\nseem joined to another great glare that went afar to my left.\r\n\r\nAnd I found the ground of that Land to be very fair for my feet, and to\r\nhave in this place and that certain bushes, even as it did seem to me,\r\nof the kind that we named moss-bushes in the Night Land, as you do know.\r\nAnd I made a very good speed, and went thus until I had gone for maybe\r\nsix long hours. And by that time, I was come anigh to the glowing of\r\nlight; and did keep now a strong caution to my going; for truly, as I\r\ndid know from the tellings of the Maid, there were very horrid and\r\ndreadful Powers in that Land, and I did well to remember that I was come\r\nagain to parts where might be the destruction of the spirit. Now I made\r\na pause, and lookt toward the glowing light; and it seemed to me that\r\nfor a monstrous way unto the right and unto the left, there did be\r\nsurely a great, hid valley in the earth before me. For the shining did\r\nseem as that it came up from out of a valley, as that there burned a\r\ndeep light in such a place; but yet was I all unsure, and had no proper\r\nknowing whether indeed there did be any valley there, but only a strange\r\nand luminous shining that did come upward from the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd I made no great haste now to go unto that place; but went down\r\nsudden into the bushes, and lay upon my belly, and had a new great fear\r\nupon my spirit. And presently, I parted the bushes a little, and made a\r\nplace for spying.\r\n\r\nAnd I looked a great time unto the place of the light, and now to this\r\npart and now to that. And sudden, I saw, as it did seem, a monstrous\r\nhead within the glowing; for the glowing did seem at whiles as that it\r\nswept to and fore, as should a shining smoke that went obedient to a\r\nquiet wind: and so to hide and again to uncover. And in a moment I lost\r\nthe great face, and was all unsure that ever I had seen aught.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in a little minute, I did see it again; but whether it did be\r\nthe shape of some utter monster of eternity--even as the Watchers about\r\nthe Mighty Pyramid--or whether it did be no more than a carven mountain\r\nof rock, shaped unto the dire picturing of a Monster, I did have no\r\nknowing. But I made that I should get hence very quick, and I did turn\r\nme about in the bushes, and went upon my hands and knees; and so came at\r\nlast a great way off.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, I came again upon my feet, and did take a new look\r\naround that Land. And I had the mouth of the Gorge to my back, and this\r\nI perceived by the shining of the fire-pits that made the place shown to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnd to the left of the Gorge was an utter blackness, as I did conceive\r\nof black and monstrous mountains, through which the Gorge did come. And\r\nto the right side of the Gorge there were many low volcanoes, that went\r\nalways along the feet of the great mountains that made the right wall of\r\nthe Gorge. And I saw the feet of these dark mountains, because that the\r\nlight from the little volcanoes made a glare upon the lower slopes.\r\n\r\nAnd so shall you have some knowing of that part of this second Land of\r\nNight.\r\n\r\nAnd a good way off, was the shining that I had journeyed unto, and the\r\nshining went into a distant light through a part of the Land that lay\r\nafar to my left, for it stretched a great and strange way toward me, out\r\nof the leftward gloom, and came unto my front, and so away into an utter\r\ndistance. Yet, though it was so great, you shall not think that it made\r\nany huge light in the Land; but was rather as that it had a shining made\r\nunto other ends; for it made not a great lightness in the Land.\r\n\r\nAnd you do now perceive something roughly how the Land did seem to my\r\nback part and unto my left, and somewhat before my face. And because\r\nthat I did think to have no profit to my search, if that I went to the\r\nleft, I made attention unto the Right. And here there was much of\r\ndarkness; yet oft the shining of fire-holes in this place and that amid\r\nthe darkness. And, as I did look, it grew very plain upon me how great\r\nwas the spread and drear wideness of that Country of Night; and how\r\nthat I did be an utter lonesome person in all that dark. And so shall\r\nyou be with me in sympathy of the utter greatness of my task, and know\r\nof the fear that did breed, odd whiles, that I should search until I\r\ndie, and never find. And you to give me good human understanding.\r\n\r\nNow I made no more to delay, but went unto the right, and did keep the\r\nchain of the little volcanoes something level to my course; though a\r\ngreat way off. And I went thus with a strange growing of hope, and an\r\nexcitement, for ten hours, and had eat not then for more than twenty\r\nhours, and surely not since the sixth hour of that day and this because\r\nthat I was so utter shaken from my calmness of going.\r\n\r\nAnd at the tenth hour, I went utter weak, and did seem surely as that I\r\nmust swoon. And lo! I bethought me how that I was gone so long without\r\naught for my belly. And surely, when I was quiet a time, I eat four of\r\nthe tablets, and in a good while did feel all renewed, and would rest no\r\nmore, after that I had drunk some of the water, but went onward; for, in\r\nverity, my spirit did be as that it had slain me, if that I had lain\r\ndown at that time. And this because hope was so fierce in me; for I to\r\nfeel indeed that I was come near to the Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd I went ten hours more, until that I did truly totter upon my feet,\r\nwith utter and dreadful weariness; for I had gone now through someways\r\nof forty great hours, and had been foolish in mine eating and drinking,\r\nas you have perceived; but yet was this to be forgiven; for I was as\r\nthat I should come any little minute upon the wonder of the Lesser\r\nPyramid, shining afar in the night. Yet, truly, there was nowhere\r\nanything that might be likened unto it.\r\n\r\nAnd I lay down there, just as I did be, and with no proper heed to my\r\nsafety. And I was gone asleep in one moment, as it did seem; and waked\r\nnot for twelve hours; and then did come suddenly unto knowledge; and\r\nthankful was I in the heart that no monster had come upon me in that\r\ndead-time of slumbering. And I eat four of the tablets, as was surely\r\ndue unto me, and drank some of the water, and so gat forward again into\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nAnd truly I was mortal stiff and did ache for a great while, and this\r\ndid be in part because that I had wrapped not the cloak about me, ere I\r\nslept; for the Land was bitter cold and did make the blood very chill.\r\n\r\nNow when I had gone onward through six hours, I ate and drank; for I did\r\nmind now to be wise and keep my strength good within me. And I went\r\nonward again at a very great speed, and full of an excitement. And\r\nsurely, I did be glad at last that the tablets were so easy gone in the\r\nmouth, and unfilling to the belly; for I had been without power and\r\npatience to eat proper victual.\r\n\r\nAnd at the tenth hour, I saw that there rose a red-shining out of the\r\nLand before me, as that it came upward from a mighty pit. And I made\r\nslow my way, and so, when I was gone on for two great hours more, I saw\r\nthat monstrous figures went about, against the red glare of the shining.\r\nAnd I gat me down into the bushes which were very plentiful in that\r\npart.\r\n\r\nAnd I stayed there for a certain while, and made a watch upon the\r\nred-shining and the figures; and, truly, it did seem to me that there\r\nwere horrid giants in that Land, even as in the Night Land. And\r\nafterward, I crept away, and went outward from the little volcanoes,\r\ninto that part of the Land that was dark, save, as you do mind, for the\r\nglare of fire-holes in this part and that.\r\n\r\nAnd I went now with an utter care; for the giants had put a new caution\r\ninto my heart, and I did surely mean that I should live to rescue mine\r\nown Maid, and have joy through all my life. And thereafter, I went with\r\nthe Diskos in my hand, and at each hour that was the sixth, I eat two of\r\nthe tablets, and drank some of the water, and so did keep my strength\r\nvery good within me.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, I was come to a place where the Land did go downward a\r\ngreat slope, and there was a difference in the earth that went beneath\r\nmy feet, and no great plenty of the bushes; but only one in this place\r\nand one in that, and nowhere any fire-hole.\r\n\r\nAnd I gat me down and did feel the earth with my hands, and lo! I did\r\nfind presently smooth stones, and afterward olden shells. And\r\nimmediately, a great delight took me; for Naani had told how that the\r\nLesser Pyramid stood something nigh to the shore of an ancient sea, that\r\nwas long dried up in the years of eternity. And surely it might be that\r\nI was come down into the dry bottom of that same olden sea, and should\r\npresently have sight of the Little Pyramid.\r\n\r\nAnd because that hope was put so fresh into me, I went forward through,\r\nmaybe, thirty hours, across the olden sea-bed; but in all that time I\r\nhad no sight of the lights of the Lesser Redoubt. And a great trouble\r\nbegan to take me; for, indeed, Naani had not told me how great was the\r\nsea; and it might be that I should wander a weariful age across it,\r\nbefore that I come to the far side.\r\n\r\nAnd it did come to me, presently, how that I should be wise to see that\r\nmy way was very straight, so that I waste not my strength in useless\r\nwanderings. And I had a great care now to observe that the red-shining\r\ndid be always upon my right, to my rear; and by this reasonable cunning\r\ndid I make to steer very nicely through the great gloom of that place.\r\n\r\nNow, as I did go across the bed of the great sea, I heard strange\r\nsounds, now in this part of the darkness, and now in that; and oft did\r\nthere be a noise, as if things did run this way and that way in the bed\r\nof the sea. And once, afar off in the night, there did be a strange and\r\nhorrid screaming; so that I did know truly that the monsters of that\r\nLand were out, and did go about in the dark.\r\n\r\nAnd, as you shall perceive and understand, I was all unknowing of the\r\nlore of that Land; so that I knew not what to think of this strange\r\nsound or that, neither knew I what they might portend, but only that, as\r\nI did say, there were Monsters abroad. And I could do no more than have\r\nmy way forward with an utter care always, and be very ready with the\r\nDiskos, or to hide, each as maybe according to the need.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely, I went one-and-forty hours that day, and eat and drank\r\nafter every sixth hour. And before this, in the seven-and-thirtieth\r\nhour, I heard a great roaring and bellowing in the night, coming nigh\r\nunto me; and afterward the thudding of monstrous feet, as that a giant\r\nran past me in the darkness, and did make a chase of some creature. And\r\nthe thudding of the feet and the roaring went far off into the night;\r\nand there did seem presently to come back to me from a great way, a\r\nlittle screaming; but of this thing I had no surety; and I abode very\r\nhushed in a clump of bush, until quietness was come again all about; for\r\nthere had been an utter frightening sound in the horrid voice and in the\r\nthudding of the great feet.\r\n\r\nNow, in the one-and-fortieth hour of that day, I came upon the farther\r\nshore of the olden sea. But lo! there was nowhere any light to tell me\r\naught of the Lesser Refuge. And truly, a great doubt and bewilderment\r\ntook me; for, indeed, I could not perceive how it might be that I saw\r\nnot the lights of the embrasures of the Lesser Pyramid. And a great\r\ndespair took me; so that I sat down there upon the shore of the olden\r\nsea, and had no heed of anything for a while.\r\n\r\nBut afterward, I ate and drunk, and went into a clump of bush, and wrapt\r\nthe cloak about me, and so went fast unto sleep, with the Diskos handy\r\nto my breast. And, in verity, the pain of the despair and the\r\nbewilderment of mine heart did make rather for sleep, than to keep me\r\nwakeful; for, indeed, I was half stunned of the brain and of my courage;\r\nand did seem now the farther off from the ending of my search than ever\r\nI had been.\r\n\r\nAnd I slept six hours, and waked then, sudden. And I leaned up upon mine\r\nelbow in the bush, and harked very quiet, perchance some noise had\r\nshaken my sleep from me. But, indeed, there was nothing, only that I was\r\nwakeful, and did mind me of my trouble of failure. Yet now, I did invent\r\nthis thing and that thing to make natural account that I was not come to\r\nthe Lesser Redoubt; and so had hope again within me; yet much also of\r\ndoubt and bewilderment.\r\n\r\nAnd I eat two of the tablets, and drank some of the water, and again to\r\nmy journey. And I made that I should keep along the shore of the sea,\r\nthe which I did through twelve hours, and was then still so much in\r\ndoubt as ever.\r\n\r\nAnd I ceased from my journeying, and lookt about me over the Land, and\r\nlo! I did note how that a weak and strange shining was in the air of the\r\nLand, at a great way; as it had been that a far spreaded and faint\r\nglowing made a little glare into all the night unto my left and before\r\nme.\r\n\r\nNow I ate and drank, and made to steady my spirit; for I did fear lest I\r\nshould feel utter lost in all the night of the world, and to know not\r\nwhere to make any more my search, and so to grow desperate in despair.\r\nAnd this thing you will understand.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I did make across that Land, unto the place where it did\r\nseem that the dull shining was something bright. And I went thus through\r\neighteen hours, and did make pause at each sixth hour, and ate and drank\r\nvery resolute; though, in verity, it did seem as that even so small a\r\nmatter as the tablets did be like to choke me. And by this is it plain\r\nto me how great an anguish was come upon my spirit, lest that I was all\r\nastray, and should have no joy to succour mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd thrice in the time that I did go, there did be a running of feet\r\namid the darkness; and odd whiles strange and horrid cryings in the\r\nnight; so that I put a force upon my despair, and hid me; for, indeed, I\r\nhad no right to lose care of my life, if there did be any chance yet\r\nthat I find the Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in the eighteenth hour, which was truly the thirtieth of that\r\nday, I found the shining in the night to be grown very plain, and an\r\nutter stinking of sulphur; and truly I did be aware that the Land went\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nAnd I made upward through seven hours, and the light did grow more\r\nplain, and was of a dull redness, very sombre and heavy. And in the end\r\nof six more hours, I ceased to go upward, and did know of a strange low\r\nsound, that did be like to no other sound that ever I did hear; and was\r\nlike to a dull roar that did never have ceased through eternity.\r\n\r\nAnd I went forward unto the light, and the Land to be now as that I went\r\nover an upland plain. And I did go thus through five hours, and the low\r\nroar did grow ever upon mine ears. And truly! even as I did shape my\r\nthoughts to take a caution for my body, I went upward again a little,\r\nand came out upon the edge of a mighty cliff, and the low and constant\r\nroar did moan upward against me with an everlasting muttering. And I\r\nlookt downward a monstrous way, and surely there was spread out a mighty\r\nsea, as it did seem, of dull fire, as that a red-hot mud did lap very\r\ndeep and quiet below me in all that night.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt outward across the strange sea, and the far side was hid\r\nfrom me; for, surely, there were dull and solemn clouds that came off\r\nthe sea, and hid the distance from me. And the clouds to glow a little\r\nredly; and so to rise, and presently to blacken into the night. And I\r\nlookt to the right and to the left, and it was plain that the black\r\ncliffs did stretch out both ways, and did go downward ever into that\r\nmonstrous sea of slow fire. And there were great headlands that went out\r\ninto the fire, as into a sea; and the fire did lap very quiet about\r\nthese, and where the fire lapt about them, there did shine and spirt out\r\ngreen flames and vapours at diverse times.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, as I did perceive, I was come to an upward sea of fire, as\r\nit were the deep inwards of a low and utter monstrous volcano, that was\r\nflat of the top and utter big across. And, in verity, I did look\r\ndownward into the fires of the inward earth, and a very wondrous sight\r\nwas it, to stand there alone upon the cliffs of that everlasting sea.\r\nAnd a great heat came upward from the dull and grim fire of that gloomy\r\nsea, and a reek of sulphur; so that I was like to be choked, and did go\r\nbackward from the edge of the cliff.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I was come to the end of that Dark Land upon that side, and\r\nhad nowhere perceived the Lesser Pyramid in all the night of my travel.\r\nAnd a new despair came upon me; for, indeed, it seemed I was come all\r\nastray in the night of the World, and did nowise have any knowing\r\nwhether I stood near to the Country of the Lesser Redoubt, or whether\r\nthat I was gone half across the World unto a strange place.\r\n\r\nAnd, then, as the despair troubled my spirit and dulled the beating of\r\nmy heart, a sudden thought did light up a fresh hope within me; for,\r\nindeed, as you do know, I was come upward of a great height, and did\r\nsurely have a huge view over all that Land; and mayhaps the Lesser\r\nPyramid did lie somewhere in a valley, if, in verity, it did be\r\nanywheres at all in that Country. And I turned me from the cliffs, and\r\nlookt backward over all the night of the Land; but there was nowhere in\r\nall that Country the shining of the Lights of the Lesser Pyramid.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! of a sudden I did know that there was something in the night.\r\nAnd I stared, with a very keen and anxious look. And behold, there was\r\nthe black shape of a great pyramid afar off in the night, that did show\r\nagainst the shining of the distant light; for it did stand between me\r\nand the far-off fires. But until I was come to that place, whence I did\r\nlook, I had not stood to have it plain against the shining upon the\r\nother side of that Land.\r\n\r\nAnd how I did feel in that moment, I have no words to set out unto you.\r\nBut surely was my heart gracious with thankfulness, and I ready to leap\r\nwith joy and hope, and all my body thrilled with an excitement that\r\nwould not have me to be silent; so that, suddenly, I began to shout\r\nfoolishly across the night. But I came soon to wisdom and silence, as\r\nyou shall think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE MAID OF THE OLDEN DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, as you shall perceive, all mine utter despair was turned in a\r\nmoment into an huge gladness and a great hope; so that it did seem to me\r\nthat I should be with my dear One in but a little while. Yet was this an\r\nover-hope and expectation, and was not like to have a swift satisfying;\r\nfor, truly, I was made aware of naught, save that I did perceive the\r\nshape of a great pyramid, going upward into the night.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew that the Pyramid did surely stand upon an hill in the midst\r\nof that dark Country, for only so might it show so great and high. And I\r\nset me to run swift downward into the Land, so that I should make a\r\nstrong going unto the Pyramid.\r\n\r\nAnd I ran for a few little minutes, and lo! I fell headlong, and did\r\ntruly feel as that I had brake my neck with the hardness and pain of my\r\nfall. And I had no power to go forward any more for a great while; but\r\ndid just be there where I did fall, and very helpless and moaning a\r\nlittle; so that any creature had been able to slay me, if that it had\r\ncome upon me in that time.\r\n\r\nYet, presently, I was able to sit upon the earth, and did hold my neck\r\nwith my hands, and afterward the pain went away; so that I gat once more\r\nto my feet. But now I went forward very wisely, and had, moreover, an\r\nanxiousness in my heart; for, indeed, how did it be that the Pyramid was\r\nso utter dark, if that it did be the Lesser Refuge, in truth. And\r\nimmediately there did rise in me a fear that it should be some House of\r\nEvil in the dark of that Land, or some wicked Force working a Pretence\r\nand a bewilderment upon my sight. Yet, truly, the thing was plain now\r\nagainst the far-off fires of the Land; and I did have little thought but\r\nthat it should be, in verity, the Lesser Refuge.\r\n\r\nNow in the first moment that I did perceive the dark Pyramid, I had been\r\nwithout wit, save to run very quick and blind unto the place; for you to\r\nremember how long I had made so great a search. And afterward, I had\r\nbeen minded to call unto Naani with my brain-elements, sending the\r\nMaster-Word, and my speech after to tell how that I was come unto her.\r\nBut now I did heed to have caution, and to discover what this darkness\r\nshould truly mean.\r\n\r\nAnd so did I go downward again into the night of that Land, at the first\r\nwith a carefulness; but presently with a fierce eagerness and expecting\r\nof the heart, the which had been dulled a little time with the horrid\r\nshaking and pain of my fall.\r\n\r\nNow I had climbed unto the upper plain of the great volcano in, maybe,\r\nthirteen hours; but I went downward of that great Hill in ten, and had\r\nmade a greater speed, but that I was sore shaken and unsure, by reason\r\nof my fall.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end of the tenth hour, I perceived that I was come again to\r\nthe great Plain of the Land; and I had no more any proper sight of the\r\nRefuge, because that it was upward afar in the darkness of the night.\r\nYet was I abled now to see that there went a bulk between me and the far\r\nshinings, and did know that this great thing was surely the hill on\r\nwhich the Pyramid did stand.\r\n\r\nAnd I went four hours across the Land, and did pass in this place and\r\nthat, fire-holes that made a little red-shining in the night; and\r\nbecause of the fires in those far parts and a-near, there was not an\r\nutter dark.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was gone four hours towards the Pyramid, I could no more see\r\nthe distant shinings, for the bulk of the hill-bottom stood up between,\r\nand made all a blackness that way. And by this thing, I did guess that I\r\nwas come nigh unto the hill; but yet was a great hour more before that I\r\ncame to it. And in that five hours, since I was come down from the great\r\nVolcano, there had past me thrice and again, the sounds of things\r\nrunning in the night, and once there did be a sound as of a giant\r\nroaring afar, and a strange and horrid screaming.\r\n\r\nNow I began to go up the hill. And, at the first, an utter excitement\r\ntook me in the heart; so that I could have shouted the name of the Maid\r\naloud in the night, with vain hopings that she should hear me and make\r\nan answer. But this state went from me very swift, as I did go upward,\r\nand there came a caution again about me, and a coldness of fear, as that\r\nmy spirit did wot of something that my heart did not perceive.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, I was come upward almost to the top of the hill, the\r\nwhich took me nigh three hours. And surely, when I was come that I could\r\nsee the grimness of the Pyramid, going upward very desolate and silent\r\ninto the night, lo! an utter shaking fear did take me; for the sweet\r\ncunning of my spirit did know that there abode no human in all that\r\ngreat and dark bulk; but that there did await me there, monstrous and\r\nhorrid things that should bring destruction upon my soul. And I went\r\ndownward of the hill, very quiet in the darkness; and so in the end,\r\naway from that place.\r\n\r\nAnd I was four great hours before that I was come clear away from the\r\nhill, and I did feel that there was not any safety for my spirit in all\r\nthat Land. And surely I went a little blindly, in the first, and did go\r\nwith no heed unto my way.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I was upon the shore of the olden sea, and had no knowing\r\nhow that I was come there; for, surely, I did think it to be a great way\r\noff. But now I do think that the dry bed of the sea did curve around\r\nunto that place, or that there did be two, or more, olden seas in that\r\nCountry of Night.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, I sat me down, very weak and bewildered; for it was as\r\nthat my heart did lie dead within me. And, in verity, you shall perceive\r\nhow this thing was, for I did know by the tellings of my spirit that\r\nthere abode evil things in the dark Pyramid upon the hill; and I doubted\r\nnot but that destruction had come upon the Peoples of the Lesser\r\nPyramid, and that evil creatures and Powers did now abide in that place.\r\nAnd if this thing did be truly so, I was come over-late to the saving of\r\nthe Maid; and with this thought I was very glad that some evil thing\r\nshould come that I should fight with it and die quickly; for there was\r\nnaught then in all the world to make me glad to have life.\r\n\r\nAnd so shall you know the utter desolation that was in my heart; and,\r\ntruly, I can perceive both the wiseness and the unwisdom of my\r\nreasonings; for, indeed, I did have no _sure_ knowing that the dark\r\nPyramid did be truly the Lesser Refuge. But yet, in verity, my spirit\r\ndid know with a certain sureness, and there was no doubt concerning this\r\nthing, in all my being.\r\n\r\nAnd, after that I had sat there awhile, I did mind me suddenly that I\r\nshould send the Master-Word through the night; for, indeed, how else\r\nmight I ever know whether Naani did yet live; though, in truth, I had\r\nlittle, save desperate hope in this matter; but yet did remember how\r\nthat I had seemed odd times of my journey to hear the beat of the\r\nMaster-Word with my spirit, out of all the dark of the world. And, in\r\nverity, if Naani answered not to the Word, but there came instead an\r\nEvil Power to destroy me, I should but cease me of mine utter\r\nheart-ache.\r\n\r\nAnd I stood me upon my feet, and looked outward about me into the\r\nblackness of that Land. And I sent the Master-Word with my\r\nbrain-elements; and immediately I called Naani, thrice, sending the call\r\nwith my brain-elements.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in a moment, as it did seem, there broke around me out of all\r\nthe mystery of night, low and solemn, the Master-Word, beating in the\r\nnight. And immediately there did sound within my brain a far, small\r\nvoice, very lone and faint, as that it had come from the end of the\r\nworld. And the voice was the voice of Naani and the voice of Mirdath,\r\nand did call me by mine olden love-name.\r\n\r\nThen, indeed, I did near to choke with the utter affright of joy that\r\ndid take me in the heart, and also I was shaken with a mighty\r\nexcitement, and my despair was gone, as that I had never known it. For,\r\nin verity, Naani did live and did call unto me with her brain-elements;\r\nand surely I had not heard the voice of mine Own for an utter age of\r\ngrim labour and dread.\r\n\r\nAnd the voice was, as I did say, as that it came from one that did be in\r\na far place of the earth. And, in verity, whilst I stood dazed with a\r\ngreat joy that the Maid did live, I knew within me, concerning the fear\r\nthat she was utter far off; and what peril might come anigh to her,\r\nbefore that I should stand to her side, to do battle for her life and\r\nwell-being and mine own joy.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in the same moment, and before that I made further speech unto\r\nNaani, I did wot that someone did be a little way off from me, in the\r\nbushes, where a fire-hole did burn anigh to me; and it was as that my\r\nspirit knew this thing, and told of it unto my brain. And I made no\r\nanswer unto the Maid, across all the dark of the world; but went very\r\nswift into a great bush that was nigh to the fire-hole, upon this side.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt through, into the open space that did be about the\r\nfire-hole. And there was a little figure that did kneel, sobbing, upon\r\nthe earth, beside the fire-hole; and truly it was a slim maid, and she\r\ndid seem as that she harked very desperate, even whilst yet she did sob.\r\nAnd surely, mine own soul did _Know_, all in one white moment of life.\r\nAnd she there, unknowing, and harking unto a cry of the spirit, that she\r\ndid think to come through all the desolation of the night--even from the\r\nMighty Pyramid. For oft, as I did perceive, had she cried unto me in all\r\nthat lonesome month, and known no answer; neither that I was making a\r\ndesperate way unto her; for, indeed, her weakness was great, so that she\r\nhad no power to throw the Word strongly afar, neither to make plain her\r\nspiritual cryings through any mighty space of the aether.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I drew in my breath, and set my teeth a moment, to steady my\r\nlips; and I said: "MIRDATH," out of the bush where I did be, and using\r\nnatural human speech. And the Maid ceased from her weeping, and lookt\r\nthis way and that, with an utter new fear, and with a frightened hope\r\nthat did shine with her tears in the light from the fire-hole. And I\r\ndivided the bush before me, and went through the bush, so that I came\r\nout before her, and did be there in my grey armour; and I did pause\r\nthen, and was all adrift in myself; for my heart said that I should take\r\nthis Maid into mine arms again; for that I was come again to be with\r\nMirdath after an utter lost Eternity. But yet was I all paused; for\r\ntruly she was Naani and she was Mirdath, and she did be a stranger in\r\nmine eyes, and very dainty and pretty and shaken with woe and sore\r\ntrouble and grief.\r\n\r\nAnd in that same moment of my coming unto her out of the bush, she\r\nscreamed and fell back from me, and strove weakly to gain unto the\r\nhither bushes; for, truly, she knew not what was come upon her in that\r\nfirst little moment. And immediately she saw that it did be an human\r\nman, and no monster to slay her, and in that instant I said the\r\nMaster-Word unto her, aloud, that she should have knowledge of peace and\r\nhelp. And I told my name, and said I am That One. And she knew this\r\nthing, even as my lips made the sounds. And she cried out something in\r\nan utter broke voice, and ran unto me, and thrust her two small hands\r\ninto my charge and keeping, and fell thence into a great sobbing and\r\nshaking, so that I was all in trouble to ease her; but did keep a\r\nsilence and held fast her hands, for I had not on mine armoured gloves.\r\n\r\nAnd she leaned against me, very weak, and seeming wondrous like to a\r\nchild. And lo! in a while she ceased to sob, and did but catch her\r\nbreath this time and that, but said no word. And I bethought me that she\r\ndid suffer of hunger, for I perceived that she had been long wandering\r\nand alone, and was come unto the end of hope, when that I did come.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid stood there yet silent, for she might not yet command her\r\nmouth to speak. And she trembled as she stood. And I opened my left\r\nhand, and lookt at the hand within my palm, and surely it was utter thin\r\nand wasted. And I made no more pause, but lifted mine Own and set her\r\neasy upon the earth, with an hump of smooth rock unto her back. And I\r\nstript off my cloak very quick, and put it about her, for she was scarce\r\ncovered with her clothes that had been all torn among the bushes; so\r\nthat part she shook with an utter chill, and part because of weakness,\r\nfor she was nigh to be starved unto her death, and destroyed with her\r\ngrief and lonesomeness.\r\n\r\nAnd I took from my back the scrip and the pouch, and I gat a tablet from\r\nthe scrip, and brake it into my cup, and with the water I made a little\r\nbroth very swift upon an hot rock that was to the edge of the fire-hole.\r\nAnd I fed the broth unto the Maid, for truly her hands did shake so that\r\nshe had spilt it all, if that I had done otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd she drank the broth, and was so weak that presently she did fall\r\nagain to sobbing, yet very quiet; so that I strove not to be troubled in\r\nthe heart; for, indeed, this thing was but reasonable, and not cause for\r\nme to have an anxiousness. But I put my hands under the cloak and took\r\nher hands into mine and held them strong and firm; and this did seem to\r\nbring something of peace and strength unto her; so that presently the\r\ntrembling and the weeping went from her. And, indeed, the broth was\r\nsurely helpful in this matter.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I knew that her hands did stir a little within mine, and\r\nI loosed somewhat of my grip; and immediately, she graspt my hands with\r\na weak and gentle grasp; but lookt not yet at me; only did stay very\r\nquiet, as that she did gather her strength within her. And, indeed, I\r\nwas content; save that an anxiousness of the heart did stir me this\r\ntime and that, lest some monster should come upon us. And because of\r\nthis trouble, I did hark about me, now and oft, and with a new and\r\nstrange fearfulness of danger, because that now mine Own was given unto\r\nmy charge; and surely my heart would break, if that there came any hurt\r\nunto her.\r\n\r\nNow, of a sudden, the Maid did make as that she would rise, and I loosed\r\nfree from her, to give help. And she gat me by the hand, and slipt\r\nsudden to her knees, and did kiss my hand, and did begin again to weep.\r\nAnd surely I was so utter abashed that I stood very stupid and let her\r\ndo this thing. But in a moment I drew free from her; for this thing\r\nmight not be. And I gat me to my knee likewise before her, and took her\r\nhands, and kist them once, newly humbled, as it were; and thus should\r\nshe know all that was in my heart, and of mine understanding. And she\r\ndid but sob the more; for she was so weak, and utter moved unto me,\r\nbecause that I had come to her through the night of the world. And this\r\nthing I knew, though no speech had yet past between us. And I gave up\r\nher hands, lest she need them for her tears; but she left them to lie in\r\nmy palms, as she did kneel there; and she bowed her head a little over\r\nher weeping; but did show that she was mine, in verity, unto the very\r\nessence of her dear spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd I took her into mine arms, very gently and without caress; but\r\npresently I stroked her hair, and called her Naani and Mirdath, and said\r\nmany things unto her, that now I scarce do wot of, but she did know them\r\nin the after time. And she was very quiet in mine arms, and seeming\r\nwondrous content; but yet did sob onward for a great time. And oft did I\r\ncoax her and say vague things of comfort, as I have told. But truly she\r\ndid ask no more comfort at that time than that she be sheltered where\r\nshe did be. And truly she had been lonesome and in terror and in grief\r\nand dread, a great and horrid time.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, she was grown quiet; and I made to put her comfortable\r\nin the cloak against the rock, that I should have freedom to make her\r\nmore of the broth. But yet she did nestle unto me, with a little sweet\r\nwistfulness, that made warm my heart in a most wondrous fashion; for\r\nsurely she was mine Own. And she to begin to say odd words to me. And so\r\nto have gentle obedience, and to rest quiet against the rock, the while\r\nthat I did make the broth. Yet ever her gaze did follow me, as I knew;\r\nfor I must look oft her way.\r\n\r\nAnd I took the broth to her, and she drank it, using her own two hands;\r\nand I sat by, and eat three of the tablets and drank some of the water,\r\nfor truly it was a foolish great time since last I had eat.\r\n\r\nNow, in a while, the broth did make bright the eyes of the Maid, and she\r\ndid begin to talk; and at whiles had pauses, because that she lacked of\r\nstrength, and there was more to be told than an human may have the\r\nheart-strength and cunning to make plain. And twice she did come again\r\nto sobbing; for, truly, her father was dead and the Peoples of the\r\nLesser redoubt all slain and dispersed through the night of that Land.\r\n\r\nAnd I learned that an Evil Force had made action upon the Peoples within\r\nthe Lesser Redoubt; so that some, being utter weak by reason of the\r\nfailing of the Earth-Current, had opened the Great Door, and gone forth\r\ninto the night. And immediately there had come into the Lesser Pyramid,\r\ngreat and horrid monsters, and had made a great and brutish chase, and\r\nhad slain many; but some had escaped forth into the night.\r\n\r\nAnd with these had come Naani, after that her father, the Master\r\nMonstruwacan, had been slain by a shaggy man, very brutal and monstrous.\r\nAnd there had been three maids with Naani, when that she made escape\r\ninto the night; but there had come certain creatures upon them, as they\r\ndid sleep among the bushes, and had stolen two, and the other maid had\r\nrun off, as did Naani, and they had neither met the other any more.\r\n\r\nAnd this dreadful happening unto the Peoples of the Lesser Redoubt, had\r\nbeen a great while gone, as it to seem to her; but she had no means to\r\ntell me how long this time should be; for, in verity, how should she\r\nmake a count. Yet had it been a dread long while unto her; and I found\r\npresently, that she had been lost through all that time that I did make\r\nmy journey unto her; for, indeed, this thing I discovered by asking\r\nconcerning my callings unto her. And she had heard none that did come to\r\nher, in any time since she had escaped out of the Lost Refuge into this\r\ndreadful Land.\r\n\r\nYet, in verity, oft had she callen unto me, until that her heart did\r\ngrow sick with the desolation of her lonesomeness and her utter\r\nforsakeness. And her callings had told unto the Evil things of the Land\r\nthat she did be in this part and that; for there had come things and\r\nbeasts in search for her; but having the gift of the hearing, she had\r\nknown of their approach, most whiles, and had come free from them; yet\r\noft-times with piteous and fearful runnings and hiding among the rocks\r\nand the bushes, so that she had grown afterward to make no calling unto\r\nme, save odd whiles, lest she bring the monsters upon her. And, indeed,\r\nas you do know, naught had come plain unto me, for she was so utter weak\r\nthat she had no power of her brain-elements to send the Word afar or the\r\ntellings of her spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd because that she was so sorely chased, she had come nigh to be\r\nnaked, even as I found her; for the bushes and the rocks had torn her\r\ngarments from her, and she had naught with which to make any proper\r\nmending of them. And for food she had eat the moss upon the rocks, and\r\nodd strange berries and growths, and had drunk of the waters of the hot\r\nsprings; and oft had she been made utter sick, because of the sulphur,\r\nor somewhat, of the water and, maybe, the poison of odd plants. Yet, as\r\nI did think, it was like that the first did save her life from the\r\nsecond; but in this thing I do make only a guessing.\r\n\r\nAnd in all that dreadful time, since that she had come to be quite\r\nalone, she had heard a score drear things; for there had been once the\r\nslaying of a young maid nigh unto her, by some Brute out in the darkness\r\nof the Land; and thrice and more had she heard the feet of people\r\nrunning this way and that, and the tread of giants pursuing. And by this\r\ntelling I did understand those things which mine ears had told to me as\r\nI did go across that Land, and surely a new pity and sorrow and horror\r\ndid come upward within me. And the Maid told me how that she came once\r\nupon certain of the Peoples of the Lesser Redoubt, as they did hide\r\namong the bushes; but they ran, with no heed to her callings that she\r\ndid be human, even as they; and by this is it plain the sore and\r\ndreadful panic that was upon the hearts of such.\r\n\r\nAnd the bitter chill of the Land had made her to strive alway to be nigh\r\nunto the fire-holes that were very plentiful; but even as this did be\r\nneedful unto her, so was it a thing that drew the Monstrous Brutes of\r\nthat Land, even as I had found in the Night Land, and in the Upward\r\nGorge. And because of this, she was oft made to stay afar off in the\r\nutter cold of the night.\r\n\r\nYet, in truth, odd whiles she did be so desperate, that she would make\r\nthe venture, and so mayhaps have a time of warmth; and because of this,\r\nshe had been nigh slain in her sleep, twice and thrice. Moreover, there\r\nwere snakes about the fires, though not over-plentiful in all parts, and\r\nthere did be spider-crabs and monstrous scorpions.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, even as she had lain by the fire-hole, very weak and\r\nseeming near unto her death, even this time when my call had come unto\r\nher to stir her unto life and bitter knowledge of despair, even then was\r\nshe all surround by creatures that were like to crabs, that did squat\r\nall about her, and did but wait for her to die; so that she had been\r\nfeared to sleep, lest they destroy her in her slumber.\r\n\r\nAnd by this thing, she had known that her death was surely nigh; and lo!\r\nout of all the night of the world had come the beat of the Master-Word,\r\nstrong and powerful, beating as a low and spiritual thunder out of all\r\nthe dark of the night. Yet had she thought of me, only as speaking from\r\nthe far-off Mighty Pyramid; so that the cry had brought naught of hope\r\nunto her, but only a newer and more known despair. And, behold, in a\r\nlittle minute, there had come her name, spoken surely with the tongue;\r\nand a name that was different from the name that my spirit had said\r\nafter the beat of the Word. And immediately, I had come out of the bush,\r\nand she had fallen back in a sudden great fear that a monster was stolen\r\nupon her; and then did see a young man in grey armour, and did know in\r\none instant that I was that olden one of her memory dreams, and the one\r\nthat had spoken unto her in the spirit across half of the dead world, as\r\nit did seem. And now was I come through all that unknown desolation and\r\naffright, to succour her. And she was immediately safe; but yet all\r\nbroken because of her weakness and her utter joy and her sweet honour\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the chief of that which she did tell unto me; and the way\r\nthat she had seen and did regard the marvel of this our coming together.\r\nBut, surely, no man was made ever to be worthy of the way that she did\r\nlook upon me, or of the words that she did say unto me in her weakness\r\nand happiness. Now, with the Maid having speech concerning the\r\nspider-crabs, I lookt presently well around, and surely, in a minute, I\r\nsaw that they were not gone away; but did be a circle of silent and\r\nsteadfast watching and impudence and horror all about us. And surely\r\nthis thing put an anger and disgust upon me; so that I gat to my feet,\r\nand went unto the border of the light, and I spurned this little monster\r\nand that, and did truly kick maybe a dozen, before that they were\r\ncontent to be gone. And by this thing shall you know of their calm and\r\nfoolish assurance; but yet were they seemingly without courage; for they\r\nmade not to attack me. Yet a true crab of this day been wishful to pinch\r\nme, had I put my toe forth unto it.\r\n\r\nNow, I went back to the Maid, and she did laugh with a little, weak\r\ngleefulness; so that I perceived that she was like to be a very joyous\r\nmaiden, if but I did have her in health. And I made her another cup of\r\nthe broth, and she drank it very easy. And afterward, I made a very\r\nstern and playful order that she must sleep, and, indeed, she to need it\r\nsore, for she was gone again from her excitement, and her weakness upon\r\nher; yet very happy and content and without fear.\r\n\r\nAnd I made a smooth place for her, and put the pouch and the scrip to be\r\nfor a pillow, and I did lay her there very quiet and sweet in the cloak,\r\nand covered her feet; but, indeed, I saw first that they did be sore cut\r\nand without any gear to them; so that I perceived that Mine Own had worn\r\nout her foot-gear utter in her lonesome journeyings, and in running from\r\nBrutes that did come to find her. And so I to know more in the heart,\r\nsomewhat of the true dreadfulness and fear that had companioned Mine\r\nOwn. And I was minded then that I would wash and bind up her feet; but\r\nyet was she so utter worn, that I did prefer that she sleep so soon as\r\nshe might, and afterward, when she was come wakeful again, then should I\r\ntake a proper heed of her feet. And truly, they were very small and\r\nshapely.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, she slept; and, surely, I doubt whether she had slumbered\r\nso peaceful and proper for a great month; for she never to have known\r\nwhen any evil thing should come upon her in her sleep. And this to be a\r\nvery dreadful feeling, as you do know well; for you do know how I had\r\nbeen in this same matter.\r\n\r\nNow, while Naani did sleep, I stript off mine armour, and took off mine\r\nunder-suit, which was named the Armour-Suit, and a very warm and proper\r\ngarment, and made thick that it should ease the chafe of the armour. And\r\nafterward, I put on the armour again; but the suit I folded, and laid\r\nbeside the Maid; for, truly, she was nigh unclothed, by reason of the\r\nbushes and the rocks, that had rent her garments all-wise.\r\n\r\nAnd I stood watch for the Maid, the while that she did slumber; and\r\nsurely she went ten long hours. And I walked upon this side of the\r\nfire-hole and now upon that, and did oft cease, that I might hearken\r\nboth with mine ears and with my spirit; for, truly, I was all wakened to\r\na new care and delight, and did have a fresh and doubled fear of any\r\nHorrid Creature or Force of Evil. And this shall be very plain to you.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end of ten long hours, the Maid wakened, and I ran to her all\r\njoyed that she was come again to knowledge and to be that I could talk\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nAnd she sat upward and looked at me, and there was new light and\r\nmovement in her, so that I knew her strength was come back into her. And\r\nfor a little minute, she said naught unto me, the while that I did ask\r\nhow she did be; and she lookt at me very keen, so that I wondered some\r\nwise in a daze, what was in her mind.\r\n\r\nAnd she askt me, of a sudden, how long it did be since that I had slept.\r\nAnd having not thought to put away her asking, because that the question\r\nwas over sudden, I said four-and-eighty hours, which should be three\r\ndays and the half of a day of four hours and twenty; and this thing I\r\nknew, because that I kept alway a very careful counting of the hours,\r\nlest that I get all adrift, and know not how long I was taken to come to\r\nthis place and that.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, even as I told this thing to the Maid, I was grown very\r\nquaint in the head; for, indeed, I was gone a wondrous while without\r\nslumber, and had done much and bitter work in that time; and before then\r\nhad been much lacking of rest, as you do know.\r\n\r\nAnd, sudden the Maid cried out something, and tost the cloak from her,\r\nand had me into her arms, and did heed not to have any foolish shame of\r\nher nakedness. And, in verity, I knew not how I was gone so strange; but\r\ndo see now that I was nigh to swoon for lack of slumber and rest.\r\n\r\nAnd she kept me very steady for a little, and afterward helped me to be\r\nlaid upon the ground; and she put the scrip and the pouch under my head;\r\nand so I did lie very calm and restful, and did be the more so, because\r\nthat I was grown so tired in the heart, the which did make my head to be\r\nvery husht, as that all the world was grown very quiet in a moment.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid did mind then that she did lack to be properly covered, and\r\nshe gat the cloak, and put it about her, and did afterward sit a little\r\nbeside me, and did rub my hands. And presently, I was something more to\r\nmyself, and she did grow more happy of her mind, and made to give me\r\nsomething for my stomach; for, indeed, I was grown those late hours to\r\nbe foolish and to have no wiseness to proper eating.\r\n\r\nAnd she did lift my head, the while that she did take the scrip from\r\nunder, and kept me very sweetly upon her knee, and so until she had gat\r\nfree a pack of the tablets, and the flask and the cup; for I had put all\r\nmatters back into the scrip before Naani had gone unto sleep, and\r\nbecause of this, I had not been able to eat or drink aught, save by\r\nwakening her, as you perceive; for, indeed I had put the scrip and the\r\npouch under her head for a pillow, as I have told.\r\n\r\nAnd she would not bide that I should do aught; but only did ask\r\nconcerning the making of the water, and was wondrous amazed to see how\r\nthe powder did fizz up and become water; and indeed, she had too much\r\ninto the cup, for, truly, it rose up and ran to the ground. And when she\r\nhad done thus, and ceased to marvel, she put three of the tablets into\r\nthe water, and made me a broth, even as I had made a broth for her; but,\r\nindeed, I was in no need, and had done very well to eat the tablets and\r\ndrink the water. Yet, truly, I was not wishful to lack the love of her\r\nway, as you may think.\r\n\r\nNow while I did drink the broth, I did be very restful upon the earth,\r\nand mine head against mine own Maid; and I did mind me now that I tell\r\nher concerning the Armour-Suit that I did mean for her wear.\r\n\r\nYet I said not that I had stript it from me, for then she had been like\r\nto say nay, and to trouble that I was like to come to a chill, as is the\r\nway of a woman. But, indeed, I might so well have told her, for truly,\r\nshe did know on the moment, and set to a little unto weeping; yet very\r\ngentle and sweet, and did kiss me as I lay there, and say such things as\r\nshould make a young man the better to have heard, if but that his own\r\ndear Love doth say the same.\r\n\r\nAnd she would nowise wear the garment; but yet in the end I prevailed by\r\ngentle reasonings and because that I was her master, as I was born to\r\nbe; and moreover, her own sweet sense did show that I spoke for wisdom;\r\nfor how should she come through all the bitter way before, if that she\r\nhad not a strong and close-made garment; and as you do mind, her\r\ncoverings did be in utter rags, as I have told; yet very sweet and\r\nclean, as I had known; so that I ween she had stript oft in the lonesome\r\nnight, and washt her garments in this or that hot spring of the sulphur\r\nwaters and other matters.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, alway she was much given to washings, as I did soon\r\nperceive.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, I did be very well again; but with a sore slumber that\r\ndid press upon my head. Yet, ere I should sleep, I did mean that I bathe\r\nher feet and bind them with ointment and with my pocket-cloth; and truly\r\nher feet were very small and pretty.\r\n\r\nAnd I sat me up, talking my head from her knee; and told her of mine\r\nintent. But, in verity, she did but throw her arms about my neck and\r\ngive me one loving kiss, and laught so hearty that I did think to do\r\nthis thing when indeed she was the better able to mind it, and I the\r\nbetter suited to have me to my rest. And, surely, this was very true,\r\nand I made no ado, save to give her the ointment; but lay back, and did\r\nbe quiet.\r\n\r\nNow I did be upon my right side, and she went to my back, and took the\r\ncloak from about her, and spread it upon me, and afterward stoopt over\r\nvery dainty, and kist me, and bade me to go very swift to my sleep, for\r\nthat she did mean to make her toilet and to get into mine Armour-Suit.\r\n\r\nAnd I made no foolishness in this matter; yet told her to ease the cloak\r\na little about me, so that I should have room to take the Diskos from my\r\nhip; and this thing I did, and took the Diskos to my breast, as was my\r\nhabit; and surely I saw that her eyes did look at me with a little\r\nshining, because that I had so strange and fierce a bed-mate.\r\n\r\nAnd I made her to promise that she keep a very keen harking, the which\r\nwas like that she should do, and to call me on the instant that she did\r\nperceive any unease in the night. And after that, I shut mine eyes, that\r\nI should not shame her, and put out mine arms, and kist her once and\r\nturned from her unto my slumber; and she away to my back that she might\r\nbe modest to her needs.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I was asleep in but a little moment, and with a great love\r\nand delight in my heart and in all my being.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, I waked not for twelve great hours. And when that time was\r\ngone, lo! I came awake, and surely the Maid did sit beside me, so bonny,\r\nand so winsome and pretty that mine arms went unto her in a moment, and\r\nshe into them, and gave me a loving and tender kiss; and afterward slipt\r\naway from me, very sensible and loving; and did stand up and turn about\r\nto be lookt at. For she did wear the Armour-Suit, and surely it was\r\nloose upon her; but yet very pleasing, being close-knit. And I to my\r\nseat, from lying, that I might see the Maid the better. And, in verity,\r\nI must kiss her again; for she did be with her hair all about her, that\r\nshe look pretty unto me; and her little feet did be bare, and so that\r\nthey made my heart new tender to look upon them; for truly she was utter\r\nlost of foot-gear. And I to my knee to her; and she, not to deny me, did\r\ncome to be kist again.\r\n\r\nNow when I found how great a time I had slept, I did scold Mine Own; but\r\nyet, as she did say, I must have long slumber if that I go so long\r\nwakeful, else should I lose my strength. And I askt how oft she had eat,\r\nand she told me but the once, and that six hours off.\r\n\r\nAnd on this I did scold again; but surely she put a very pretty finger\r\nsudden upon my lips, so that I might do naught but laugh, and kiss that\r\nsame finger.\r\n\r\nAnd, after that, we did eat and drink, and made plans. And once I did\r\ncomfort the Maid; for, indeed, her sorrow did rise in her, because that\r\nher father was come unto his death, and the Peoples of the Lesser\r\nRedoubt all destroyed, and adrift in the night amid the monsters of that\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I was set that we go quickly out of that place, ere\r\nthere came an horrid Destruction upon us; and, surely, there should\r\nscarce be any human, beside, in all that Land; for there must have come\r\ndeath upon the chief of those that did make escape.\r\n\r\nAnd after we had eat and drunk, I did count the packs of the tablets,\r\nand was thankful in all my being that I had been careful and denied my\r\nbelly; for I did perceive that there were left enough for our needs, if\r\nthat we made a good speed, and did not fear to be empty. And of the\r\nwater-powder, as it might be named, there were left two full flasks, and\r\nsomewhat of that one that I had drunk from, all my journeying. And by\r\nthis thing you shall perceive that we did not be like to die for the\r\nneed of such matters.\r\n\r\nAnd here, as it doth occur unto me, I do ponder how it did be that we\r\nhad no thought to slay any small creature for our food; but, mayhap, we\r\nhad no knowledge this way; for surely, they did not this thing to my\r\nknowing in the Mighty Pyramid. But yet, as I have said before this, I\r\nhave not all knowledge of the doings of the Peoples. But, in verity, I\r\nnever saw joint meat in all the time of that far Life that I do wot of.\r\nYet, had we but slain somewhat for our hunger in that great wandering,\r\nwe had been less empty in the belly.\r\n\r\nNow, before that we should do aught beside, we must contrive that Naani\r\nhave some gear for her feet; and to this intent, I did make a search\r\ninto the pouch, and surely I found that there did be a change pair of\r\ninner shoes, that were made to go within mine own shoes of the grey\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nAnd at this I was wondrous glad, and did make the Maid to sit upon a\r\nlittle rock, while that I made a fitting of the shoes. And, surely, they\r\ndid be utter big and clumsy upon her little feet; so that I was in\r\nsurprise to know how great is a man, beside a Maid. But in the end I had\r\na cunning thought, for I cut off all the side of a strap, throughout the\r\nlength of the strap, very thin and careful, and so had a lace to tie the\r\nboots around the tops, which were soft and easy for such a purpose. And\r\nafter that, I stood away to look at the Maid, and neither she nor I were\r\ntruly pleased; for, indeed, she was too pretty to be so hid and muffled.\r\nYet were we glad otherwise; for now she might go without hurt to her\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, we packt our gear, and she did make a bundle of her torn\r\ngarments; for, truly, they might be proper somewise to our need. And so\r\nwe to begin the way out of that Desolate Land.\r\n\r\nAnd we went forward together across the Land, and the journey was no\r\nmore a weariness, but of a close and sweet joy; yet did I have a new\r\nanxiousness, as you do perceive, lest that any monster come to harm Mine\r\nOwn.\r\n\r\nAnd we went twelve great hours in the bed of the olden sea, and did eat\r\ntwice in that time. And surely the Maid did grow utter weak and weary;\r\nfor she was not come proper unto her strength; yet did she make no odd\r\nsaying to tell me of this thing. But indeed, I did know; and I stopt in\r\nthe thirteenth hour, and took her into mine arms, even as I should carry\r\na babe; and I went forward with her, and did hush her protesting with a\r\nkiss, and afterward she did but nestle unto me and shelter against my\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nAnd I bade the Maid to sleep; but, indeed, she had no power to this end,\r\nfor her body did ache very sore; but yet did she strive to give me an\r\nobedience in this thing. And in the eighteenth hour, when that I stopt\r\nto have food and drink, surely she did be awake, yet had she been utter\r\nsilent; and I made to scold her; but she gat from mine arms, and did go\r\nupward upon her toes, and put her finger against my lips very naughtily.\r\nAnd afterward she did be impudent unto me, and did deny me to kiss her.\r\nBut she went unto my back, and did open the scrip, and gat me to my\r\nfood, even as a quiet and proper wife should go. As she did be so sedate\r\nthat I knew she had mischief her heart of harmless kind.\r\n\r\nBut afterward this did pass sudden into weeping; for she had a quick and\r\nsore memory of her father and of the Destruction; and I took the Maid\r\ninto mine arms, and did let her be there very gentle, and made not to\r\nkiss or to comfort her; but yet to give comfort.\r\n\r\nAnd presently she ceased from weeping, and did slip her hand into mine,\r\nand I to keep it within, very soft and quiet; and afterward, she began\r\nto eat her tablets, yet always she did be very husht; so that I did be\r\nquiet also, and feel as that my love did be round her as a shield. And I\r\nknew that she had knowledge of this thing in her heart.\r\n\r\nAnd oft I harked into the night of the Land; but there was nowhere any\r\nsound, or disturbing of the aether, to trouble me. And the Maid in mine\r\narms did know when that I harked; for in verity, she had the\r\nNight-Hearing and the understanding spirit that doth be needful to such.\r\nAnd odd whiles did I look down to her through the gloom that did be\r\nabout us; and presently I did perceive that she lookt up to me, out of\r\nmine arms.\r\n\r\nAnd I kist her.\r\n\r\nNow, in all that day, we had come nowhere upon any fire-hole in the bed\r\nof the olden sea; and truly I did ache to be nigh unto the warmth of\r\nsuch; for I did feel the cold of the Land, because that I was weary, and\r\nbecause that I had not the thickness of the Armour-Suit below mine\r\narmour to warm me.\r\n\r\nAnd the cloak did be about the Maid; for I had feared that she should\r\ngrow cold as I carried her. Yet, now she did know subtly that I was come\r\nto feel the utter chill of the Land; and she gat from mine arms, and put\r\nthe cloak about me, and afterward came again into mine arms. And I let\r\nthe cloak bide there, and drew it forward to be around her, also. Yet,\r\ntruly, I was joyful that I did be cold, as you shall perceive. For it\r\nwas sweet to the heart to bear somewhat of that dread chill for Mine\r\nOwn; and she half troubled and likewise with understanding of my heart,\r\nbecause that I was less clothed than I had been.\r\n\r\nNow, in a little while, the Maid did pack the scrip; and so we did make\r\nready again to go forward, for I was grown anxious, as you may suppose,\r\nthat we should come to some fire-hole, that we have a place for sleep\r\nthat had warmth and light; for, truly, the cold of the Land did be drear\r\nand horrid.\r\n\r\nAnd I stoopt to take the Maid into mine arms, that I should carry her;\r\nbut she did say nay, that she did be well rested. And I not to gainsay\r\nher, for she did mean the thing, as I perceived, and I had no desire to\r\nforce my way upon her, save when I saw truly that she did seem to go\r\nunwisely. And, indeed, when such did be the case I did strive with her,\r\nonly with a nice reasonableness, as you shall know.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid walkt by my side, and wondrous silent; but yet very nigh to\r\nme, so that I knew she did be very full of love to me, and of that\r\nquaint and sweet humbleness that love doth breed odd whiles in a woman\r\nwhen she doth be with her man, if but that man be also her master. And\r\npresently, I perceived that the cloak did be over mine own shoulders,\r\nand I took it and would have put it about the Maid; but truly she did\r\nnot allow this; and when I did be stern with her, that she obey me in\r\nthis matter, she did stand upon her toes, that she might kiss me, and\r\npulled my head down, and surely she kist me and coaxed me that I wear\r\nthe cloak, else should I give pain to her, in that I did surely be cold\r\nbecause she did wear the Armour-Suit.\r\n\r\nYet, I would not hark to this thing; so that the Maid did be truly in\r\ntrouble. And first she made a threatening that she wear but her olden\r\ngarments that did be only rags, if that I did persist. But this I saw to\r\nbe foolishness and scarce-meant, and did as much need to smile at her as\r\nthat I did think to scold her; but I did be firm that she wear the\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! she went sudden into crying; and this had been beyond my\r\nthoughts. And truly, it set me all adrift; for I perceived that she did\r\nbe greatly distrest concerning this matter, when I had conceived that\r\nshe did but mean this thing for tenderness\' sake. But mine heart helped\r\nme to understand, and I saw how she did be truly shamed, in her sweet\r\nwomanhood, if that I helped her not in this matter; for she did feel\r\nthat she was made to do hurt unto that one that was her Love. And this\r\nthing I do pray you to think upon, that you understand; for, indeed,\r\nuntil that I was made to think, I had not seen it thiswise, for her.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end, I came to agreement with the Maid, that we wear the\r\ngarment hour by hour, in turn; and she to wear it the first hour and I\r\nto wear it the second hour; and so to go forward.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, this did be an happy arranging; but yet she stampt her foot a\r\nlittle, as I put the cloak about her. And thrice in the hour did she ask\r\nme concerning the time that was gone; and surely, when the hour was but\r\nup, she had the cloak off in a moment, and went to my back and cast it\r\nupon my shoulders, and after to my front, and made it fast upon my\r\nbreast; and so eager and naughty was she to this, that I took her by the\r\nshoulders, and shook her, somewhat, even as she had made to stamp at me;\r\nyet mayhaps with more of laughter. And she to take no heed at all; but\r\nto button the cloak and be very sedate. Yet, in verity, I caught her up\r\ninto mine arms, and kissed her, for a sweet and naughty Maid; and she\r\nvery willing, now that she had gotten something of her way.\r\n\r\nBut yet in an hour, I did have the cloak about her, again; and so did\r\nstraiten matters, as you shall conceive.\r\n\r\nNow, when we had gone forward, through five great hours, I perceived\r\nthat the Maid did be utter worn, but yet did make presence that she was\r\nunwearied. And because I saw how she did be, I did heed and be anxious\r\nonly that we come to some rock, to be for our safe refuge, and mayhap\r\nthere to find an hole or cave, that should be somewhat to keep our heat\r\nabout us; for there was nowhere any fire-hole anigh in all those hours.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, we came to a part where there did be rocks, and we went\r\nto and fro in the gloom, and came in the end to a place where the rocks\r\ndid go upward into the night, as that it had been a small and ancient\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\nAnd surely in a while I found a hole that did go inwards of the rock;\r\nand the hole did be above mine head; yet when I was come to it, and had\r\nmade the Diskos to spin therein, that I should have light to see whether\r\nthere did be any creature or creeping thing in the hole, I was well\r\npleased; for truly it did be sweet and dry.\r\n\r\nNow the Maid had cried out a little to see the sudden shining that did\r\ncome from within the hole, when I made the Diskos to spin, and because\r\nof the low roar of the weapon. But I answered her that there did be\r\nnaught to have fear concerning; and so was she peaceful again, but yet a\r\nlittle trembling when that I came down to her; for, indeed, the Diskos\r\ndid make always a strange sounding and a quaint and drear shining, as\r\nyou do know; and she did be feared for me that some Evil Force had come\r\nupon me out of the cave; for she had neither knowledge nor conceiving\r\nthat ever there did be so wondrous a weapon in all the world.\r\n\r\nAnd I gave the Maid an help upward to the little cave, and came after,\r\nmyself; and so we did be in a very nice and cosy place, that did not be\r\neasily gotten at by any monstrous thing. And surely I was utter glad for\r\nsuch a place, so that both should have safety that we might sleep in the\r\nsame hours.\r\n\r\nAnd, in truth, this was a needful plan; for if one had stayed wakeful to\r\nkeep a watch for the other, then had our sleep taken us double hours;\r\nand this thing might not be, else should our food be done, and we to be\r\ntwice so long as need be, ere ever we did come unto the refuge of the\r\nMighty Pyramid; and I utter wearied and anxious of the heart and spirit\r\nthat I bring Mine Own soon unto the safety and glory of my Mighty Home,\r\nand so free from the Destruction that did hang above our two souls for\r\never in that Land, and the peril that did be everywhere, save in the\r\nLast Redoubt.\r\n\r\nNow when we were come into the hole of the rock, the Maid did slip the\r\nscrip and the pouch from my shoulders; and she gat out the tablets, and\r\nmade some of the water, and did be very swift and natty, and all to the\r\ndespite of the gloom that did be utter in that little cave.\r\n\r\nAnd we eat each of us two of the tablets and drank some of the water;\r\nand I made jest with the Maid how that the tablets did be proper for\r\nstrength, yet very lacking to fill the belly; though, indeed, I named it\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd she to agree, and did pat mine arm, and did tell me how that she\r\nshould cook me a monstrous tasty and great meal when that we were come\r\nunto the Mighty Pyramid. And immediately afterward, she did make to\r\nlaugh upon me, and to name me impudently for so much thought unto my\r\nfeeding; and afterward again to silence, and to patting my hand.\r\n\r\nNow, when that we had made an end of eating and drinking, I was very\r\nready for sleep; for, truly, it was six and twenty great hours since\r\nthat I did last slumber; but for the Maid it did be eight and thirty\r\ngreat hours; for, as you do mind, she had made no sleeping when that she\r\ndid lie in mine arms for six hours of our journeying.\r\n\r\nAnd I made how we should sleep; and put the cloak about the Maid; but\r\nsurely she did refuse, very piteous, and seeming to have also somewhat\r\nof doubt and puzzlement. But in this thing I did be very stern and\r\nintending; for she did not be over-warm clad, as you do know, and\r\nmoreover, she was but a little One, while I did be wondrous hardy.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I made her to obey, and gave her the scrip and the pouch\r\nfor her pillow; and she, as it did seem to me, to sob to herself a\r\nlittle in the gloom of the night. But yet did I stay my heart a little\r\nstern to mine intent. And I wrapt the cloak about her, and set the scrip\r\nand the pouch very nice beneath her head; and afterward, I knelt over to\r\nkiss her, before that I came unto mine own slumber. Yet did she turn her\r\nmouth from me, and did put her hand above her face to ward me off, the\r\nwhich did grieve me; for truly, I did heed alway that I should never\r\nthrust my love upon her in her lonesomeness; but only let it be to her\r\nfor a shield and for all comfort unto her heart.\r\n\r\nAnd I turned my back, and went a pace away and lay down; for truly there\r\ndid be no way else but to be near unto the Maid, for it was but a little\r\ncave. And I lay very husht, because that I was so sore in the heart.\r\nYet, truly, I could not come unto my slumber, for I was so disturbed in\r\nmy love; and I stayed very quiet maybe for a great hour; and did fight\r\nthat I shake not mine armour to jinglings with the utter cold that did\r\nmake me to tremble. But the Maid did sleep very sweet and calm, as I\r\nperceived by her breathings.\r\n\r\nYet, in verity, the Maid did be so much awake as I, and with some sweet\r\nand naughty intent of the heart, as my spirit did sudden perceive. And I\r\nlay very husht, and did wait to discover what this thing might be.\r\n\r\nAnd I made my breathing to seem as the breathing of one that did sleep,\r\neven as that naughty Maid did make pretending. And surely, in a while I\r\ndid know that she moved very quiet, and came unto me; and I made yet\r\nthat I slept very sound and strong; though the cold did nigh to conquer\r\nall my quietness.\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment I perceived the intent of the Maid; for I did feel the\r\ncloak spread over me with a wondrous gentleness; and afterward there did\r\nbe a soft kiss put upon my hand; and the Maid back then to her pillow;\r\nyet, as I did hear, she brought it something more nigh to me; as that\r\nshe did crave to be near unto me that was her own Love.\r\n\r\nAnd I sat up, and I put forth my hands suddenly and took the Maid into\r\nmine arms; and she to nestle unto me so that I did be wordless, because\r\nthat I loved her so utter.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I felt her to stir in mine arms; and I loost her\r\nsomewhat; for I did be always very mindful that I impose not upon her\r\ndear liberty of maidenhood. Yet she made not to go from me, but only to\r\ngather the cloak about her; so that we did both be in the cloak. And she\r\naskt why this might not be; for surely it did be madness that one should\r\nstarve and the other be very nice in warmth. And, indeed, this did be\r\nbut wisdom; yet it might not come the first from me.\r\n\r\nAnd I said to Mine Own that this thing should be; and she reached out,\r\nand brought the scrip and the pouch, and placed them for a pillow for my\r\nhead, and told me that I should put my head thereon. And I askt her how\r\nthis did be right; for she did need a pillow the more than I. But she\r\nbid me to bide, and to have obedience in my turn. And when I was so, she\r\nspread the cloak over me, and afterward crept under, and did lie down\r\nbeside me, and did seem as that she was asleep in one moment.\r\n\r\nYet, though she did be so sedate and matter-of-the-fact, as we do say,\r\nwhile that she was wakeful, she did yet nestle unto me very sweet and\r\nchildlike in her sleep. And surely I did want to kiss her; but yet did\r\nrefrain from my love; for, truly, I did well that I treat her very\r\ngently, at such a time, as you do perceive. And, in verity, such a Maid\r\ndoth make a reverence in the soul of a man.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, I was gone over unto sleep; and in seven hours I waked;\r\nand in that time had the Maid slumbered through eight hours; yet did I\r\nintend that she be not disturbed, until that we were aready to the\r\njourney. And I slipt from under the cloak, and put it round her, very\r\ngentle. Yet it to be as she did miss me, even in her sleep; for it to\r\nseem to me that she put out her arms in the darkness, and she made a\r\nlittle moaning in her slumber. Yet, in a moment, she did be quiet, and\r\nafterward I put the cloak about her again.\r\n\r\nAnd I went then to the opening of the little cave, and put forth my\r\nhead, and lookt well about, and harked a long while; but there stirred\r\nnothing in the night thereabout; neither did my spirit wot of any matter\r\nfor trouble unto us.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I gat out two of the tablets; for, as you do know, the\r\nMaid had given me the scrip and the pouch to be my pillow, so that I had\r\npower to come at these matters, without awaking her; but for her own\r\npart, as I did learn after, she had used her torn garments to be for a\r\npillow; yet had made no explaining, as you do mind; and surely this was\r\none of her naughty whimsies; and mayhap she had been so full of a\r\nplayful happiness--as doth take the heart betimes--that she had made a\r\nlittle mystery where there did be no mystery; and this but to release\r\nher joy, and so to say masterful things unto me, out of her impudence;\r\nand afterward had meant that she tell me; but yet was gone unto slumber,\r\nere that she did mind her.\r\n\r\nYet, since that time, a new thought hath come unto me that she did mean\r\nin the first that she should come into mine arms to sleep, and thereby\r\nneed no pillow. But afterward, it may hap that she saw with a sudden\r\nolden wisdom, all in one moment; and afterward did act lovingly, yet\r\nwith understanding. And so did change from her intent; yet with no\r\nimproperness of modesty; but only with a niceness of Sense, which she\r\ndid make no talk of; but yet did have. And surely, how oft is a man thus\r\nwisely ordered, unknowing.\r\n\r\nAnd to cease from these thinkings, and to go forward, I eat two of the\r\ntablets, and afterward made some of the water. And lo! the fizzing of\r\nthe water waked the Maid; and I knew that she reached out very sudden to\r\nme; but afterward knew in a moment what did make the sound, and that I\r\ndid be up and making ready for the journeying.\r\n\r\nAnd she gat up in the darkness, and said my name, and came unto me, and\r\nkist my forehead in the dark; and immediately she ran her hands gently\r\ndownward of my left arm, and when she came to the cup, she took it from\r\nme, and slapt my hand, very dainty. And afterward I knew that she took a\r\nsip from the cup, and then did turn that side to me, and so gave me to\r\ndrink, and did scold me that I had not waked her to tend to my needs;\r\nfor surely she did be Mine Own, to have her duties to me.\r\n\r\nAnd after that I had drank, she took the cup, and did finish it; and she\r\ngat two of the tablets, as I did think, and came afterward and sat upon\r\nthe rock to my side, and did nestle somewhat against mine armour, and\r\ntook mine arm and set it about her; and so did make to eat.\r\n\r\nBut first she put her tablet unto my lips, in the dark, that I should\r\nkiss it; and surely this was an olden way of Mirdath My Beautiful One;\r\nso that I did be all shaken of the heart. And I kist the tablet; and\r\nimmediately she nestled unto me, and did begin to eat.\r\n\r\nAnd truly it was as that Eternity had been rolled backward; for I had\r\ndiscovered the soul of mine olden Love in this dainty Maid to my side.\r\nYet, in looks had Mirdath been of an utter differing; but, in verity\r\nNaani was wondrous lovely. But, though I to be so stirred, I did be\r\nsilent; for my heart was very full of memory.\r\n\r\nAnd as the Maid eat, she slipt her fingers between mine, curling them\r\nsoftly; and surely her fingers did be very little; and she stirred mine\r\nolden memories again in this thing. And surely I was dumb before my\r\nMemory.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, she put up the second tablet, as I did think, that I\r\nshould kiss it; and I kist it, as before. Yet, ere she did begin again\r\nto eat, I did wot suddenly that she hid some intent from me.\r\n\r\nAnd I caught her hand very quick in the dark; and her fingers did close\r\nupon the tablet, very guilty; so that I perceived that I had guessed\r\naright. And I opened her fingers; and I found that there did be but the\r\nhalf of a tablet within her hand. And surely she had taken but that one\r\ntablet, and had given me the one end to kiss, and afterward the other;\r\nso that I should suppose she did eat two proper and complete tablets.\r\n\r\nAnd I perceived that she had done this thing secretly, being minded that\r\nif she eat always but one tablet, then should I never lack, even if that\r\nwe did be over-long coming unto the Mighty Pyramid.\r\n\r\nAnd I askt how oft already had she eat but one, for two. And she\r\nconfessed in a very quiet voice that this did make the fifth time. And I\r\nwas so angered, that I took her hand and whipt it thrice, so hard that\r\nshe had screamed if that she had been any coward. And she said nothing\r\nto me, neither went away.\r\n\r\nAnd she began again to eat the half of the tablet, and did eat it from\r\nthe other hand, as I to be aware, because that her left hand did be\r\nhurt. And she wept not, but was very quiet by me; and presently I knew\r\nthat she kist the whipt hand secretly in the dark.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I put mine arm again about her; and she did be there in\r\nit, very sober and happy. And when she had made an end of the first\r\ntablet, I gave her the second, and she eat it very quiet and content.\r\n\r\nAnd presently I talked with her, and showed her how that this thing did\r\nhurt my heart, even as she had been hurt that I did be cold garmented,\r\nthe while that she did be warm. And I showed her the wickedness that she\r\nhad done, that she did play so foolish with her life and strength; and\r\nwell might she be weak and all a-lack.\r\n\r\nYet, did I think a little sweet impudence came into her, as I told her\r\nconcerning her wickednesses. And I took her then into mine arms, and I\r\nshowed her how that I knew all the unselfishness and wonder of her\r\nheart; and I kist her, and truly her lips did have a lovely glad\r\nhumbleness as they came unto mine; so that it was as that I had not kist\r\nher truly until that moment. And I made her to promise that she never\r\ndeceive me in such matter again. And indeed she promised; but yet with\r\nno ready tongue.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, we made proper for the journey; and when we had gotten\r\nour gear together, I went downward of the rock, and gave the Maid help\r\nto come down. And when we did stand at last upon the bottom of the rock,\r\nI askt Naani how she did feel, and whether her feet did hurt. And she\r\nanswered that she did be very well and had no soreness in her feet.\r\n\r\nAnd we went forward then, and she close unto me; and odd whiles with low\r\nspeech, but more oft with silence, because that we did need that we hark\r\nalway for any danger or horror; and also there did be so utter a silence\r\nupon that part of the Land, which did be the bottom of the olden sea.\r\nAnd we eat and drank at the sixth and the twelfth hours; and in the\r\nfifteenth hour, we came upon a great slope of the earth; and lo! it did\r\nbe the far side of the sea. And we went upward for a long hour; and so\r\ncame to the upward part, and did be able once more to look over the\r\ngreatness of that Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE HOMEWARD WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, truly, it did seem very light, after the horrid and lonesome gloom\r\nthat did lie all-ways in the bottom of the olden sea; and I saw that I\r\nwas come out upon a part of the Land that did be surely to the right of\r\nthat place where I made entry into the sea-bed, on mine outward going.\r\nAnd there did be a great plenty of fire-holes, so that mine heart was\r\nwarmed to see them; yet did I mind to be wary in coming unto them; for,\r\nas you do know, there did so oft be life of this kind and that about\r\nthese fires.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt now down to the Maid, and she upward to me, and did come\r\nmore anigh to me, and truly she did be most wondrous pretty and sweet;\r\nyet did seem very awearied and pale in the face; so that I made blame\r\nupon myself that I had overwalked her; for, in verity, I do think that I\r\nwas so strong and hard as that I had been made from iron; and she but a\r\ndear and tender Maid. Yet did she refuse that I should so reproach\r\nmyself; and did but stand anigh to me and look at me with eyes that were\r\nvery beautiful. And so I put mine arms about her, and kist her; and\r\nafterward lookt again over the Land, that I should shape out our further\r\njourneying.\r\n\r\nAnd from that place where I did stand, there spread out all before me\r\nthe blue shining that I had seen from the mouth-part of the Upward\r\nGorge; yet did it be a great way off. And, indeed, I should tell you in\r\nthis place, that it was by the glimmering of this shine within the sky\r\nof the night that I had steered, as we did come across the olden\r\nsea-bed. And, truly, it was but a broad thing to go toward; but yet did\r\nserve me, in that it told me that I went toward the far side of the\r\nsea-bed, and made not to go all about in blind circles in the night.\r\n\r\nAnd after that I had considered a while, I did know somewhat where the\r\nGorge should be, and perceived that I should go unto my left; but not\r\novermuch, for indeed I saw the red-shining of the giants\' hole that lay\r\nat a great space that way; and surely I must go so that I missed the\r\nplace of the giants so much as I might, and in the same going, come not\r\novernear unto the blue-shining that lay before me, across all the far\r\npart of that Country; for, in verity, I Mistrusted the place where that\r\nshining did be.\r\n\r\nNow when I had gained somewhat of knowledge where should be found the\r\nMouth of the Upward Gorge, I put mine arm about the Maid, where she did\r\nstand so nigh to me, and very husht, the while that I had lookt about. And\r\nI pointed outward over the dark Land unto my left, and told her that the\r\nGorge did be somewhere that way, a great distance off; yet utter out of my\r\nsight, and only to be known that it did be somewise there by the things\r\nthat I did mind of, concerning my way after I came into the Land.\r\n\r\nNow the Maid, having stood very quiet, had lookt all that time about\r\nher; and so had come to some knowing of the place where she did be in the\r\nLand, for she to know the land someways, as you shall think. And she askt\r\nme how I did mind to go; and truly I said, so straight as we might; but yet\r\nso that we come neither too nigh to the shining nor to the great red\r\nfire-pit of the Giants.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid bade me to look in the way that I did mind to go; and I\r\nlookt, but yet there was nothing save, as they did seem, certain\r\nfire-holes that had a green-shining about them. And she set out unto me\r\nthen, how that there did go a tract of bad gas in that part of the\r\nLand, that should be utter poisonous unto any; and this had been well\r\nknown in the Lesser Redoubt, by the reading of their instruments. And\r\nwhere the gas did go, there was there a green-shining about the\r\nfire-holes.\r\n\r\nAnd she showed me how that the Place of the Gas went a great way unto\r\nthe North-West, so that I learned now somewhat how the land did lie, as we\r\ndo say in these days. And it was in all the North-West that the great\r\nblue-shining did burn. And I askt Naani how they named this, and she told\r\nme by no name, save but The Shine.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own made very earnest to warn me, regarding The Shine; and urged\r\nthat we go no more that-wards than should be needful to our lives--the\r\nwhich, indeed, was no wish of mine. And her reason to be that the Fixed\r\nGiants did be within the borders of The Shine, and all hid in the light\r\nthereof, save when the burning mist did roll this way or that. And I\r\ntook a great heed of this thing, and did guess that these Fixed Giants\r\nwere somewhat even as the Great Watchers that were about the Mighty\r\nPyramid, as you do know. And immediately I minded me of that utter\r\nmonstrous face that I did see amid the bright smoke of The Shine, when\r\nthat I came first into the Land; and surely this had been one of the\r\nFixed Giants, that Naani told me were Forces of great and very horrid\r\nEvil.\r\n\r\nAnd I askt Mine Own how far the Place of the Gas went across the Land;\r\nand she pointed and made further explaining. And, in verity, in the\r\nend, I saw not how I should come that way to the mouth of the Gorge, if\r\nthat I would keep off-wards from The Shine. Yet, in a moment, Naani askt\r\nme how I did come across the Land, when that I searched for her. And,\r\ntruly, as I showed her, I had walked then by a sweet chance, or guiding,\r\nalway upon the far side of the Place of the Gas, and so unto the Olden\r\nSea bed; and was in this way come free of the gas, and all unknowing of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd at this telling, the Maid said that we go downward again into the\r\nbed of the Olden Sea, and walk some great hours below the shore, but in\r\nthe way that should take us unto the South-West, and so until we were\r\ncome beyond the Place of the Gas. And afterward up again into the Land,\r\nand then to have an utter caution that we escape the watching of the\r\ngiants who did be ever about the Great Red Fire-Hole. And by this plan\r\nvery speedy to the entering-part of the Upward Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, this did be very good and sound, and such as I should have\r\nplanned in a moment; for, indeed, I am not over-slow in such matters;\r\nonly the Maid did be very eager and quick; and it was very sweet to me\r\nthat she should thus plan; for, in verity, I loved alway the sounding of\r\nher voice, and to hear her have speech and to plan and think, and so to\r\nshow me the workings of her inward self and her dear qualities and human\r\nniceness. And to have part and lot alway with me in all things and\r\nthinkings.\r\n\r\nAnd, we shaped to this plan that Naani made; but at that time, as you do\r\nmind, it was somewhat of seventeen hours since last we had slumber; and\r\nthe Maid was sore wearied, as I did see. And I showed to her how that it\r\ndid be wise that we have our rest very soon, and so forward again in new\r\nstrength and ability.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid did soon agree with me; for indeed she was very weary; and\r\nwe made it that we should venture unto one of the fire-holes that lay no\r\ngreat seeming away, a little upon our right, which was the Northward-way\r\nof that Land.\r\n\r\nAnd we went toward the fire-hole; and, truly, it did be further off than\r\nwe had thought; for it was a good hour before that we came anigh to it;\r\nand, indeed, it to prove a very great and red-glowing shine that went\r\nupward into the night, out of the hollow place where it did burn among\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAnd when we were come near unto it, I made a sign to the Maid that she\r\nbe utter husht; and I took the Diskos from mine hip, and went forward\r\nbefore her; and afterward to my knees and hands, and beckoned backward\r\nto Mine Own, that she do likewise.\r\n\r\nAnd we came this way to the edge of the hollow-place where the fire-hole\r\ndid burn; and so were able in the end to look downward. And truly it was\r\na great fire that burned in the earth in that place; yet, as I perceived\r\nvery swift, there did seem nowhere any monstrous thing about the fire,\r\nthe which set some peace upon mine heart; but yet not overmuch; for it\r\nwas come fresh upon me that we did well to stay afar off from the fires\r\nof the Land, in that it was about the fires that all living things did\r\ncongregate.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt a great time, and the Maid crept unto mine elbow, and lookt\r\nwith me; and afterward we harked, very keen, into the night; but there\r\nwas nowhere any trouble of the air or of the aether of the Land. Yet I\r\nspoke quiet with the Maid, and showed unto her how that we did well to\r\nstay off-ward from the fires; but, truly, she was so utter cold and\r\nchill, that she did beg that we go down by the fire-hole, even should it\r\nbe that we stay no more there than should put a warmth through the utter\r\nchill of our bodies.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I was so bitter cold that I was all weak to go beside\r\nthe fire; yet, truly, I do think that the shiverings of the Maid was\r\nthat which did force my heart, to go against the teachings of my head;\r\nso that in the end, we came down into the hollow, and very swift unto\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nNow, truly, it doth seem a strange thing to be so diverse-minded as\r\nthis, when that, as you do know, I had been so long a-search for a\r\nfire-pit; and mayhaps you shall perceive the better how my heart and\r\nbrain did be contrary, when that I tell to you, now, how that I have\r\nbelief that my spirit did even then be subtly set to warn me. And, also,\r\nas all do know, it doth be easy to forget this warning and that of\r\nexperience; by which saying, I do mean that, oft as I had come to know\r\nthe dangers that did be alway about the fire-holes, yet when I did be\r\nfar off from them, and Mine Own broken and a-shiver with the chill of\r\nthe Land, the danger did seem but a small thing and afar off from my\r\nmind, and unreal; but the cold to be doubly real. Yet, when we did come\r\neven unto the fire-hole, then did come again all about my heart the\r\ntruth of those dangers that had seemed, but a while gone, so little.\r\nAnd, indeed, I do hope you perceive me in this thing, and how that I\r\nstrive alway to set unto you the utter truth, so that you shall go with\r\nme all the way, and lend me your nice understanding.\r\n\r\nNow, when we were come down unto the fire-pit, I went this way and that\r\namong the rocks that did be in the bottom of the hollow, so that I\r\nshould perceive whether there did be any living creature there hid, that\r\nshould mayhap come out, unknown, to work us harm.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, I discovered nothing of any greatness; yet I saw three\r\nsnakes, and there were, beside, two scorpion-creatures, as I did name\r\nthem, that neither went backward from me, nor came against me; but did\r\nbide where I saw them, each in an hole of the rock.\r\n\r\nAnd because I had seen these things, I saw that we should not do wise to\r\nsleep nigh unto the fire-hole; for the creeping things did mortally like\r\nthe heat, and should be like to come upon us in our slumber. And,\r\nindeed, this did but uphold my caution, that we should be well\r\nactioned, if that we chose some other part to our rest.\r\n\r\nYet, as you shall suppose, I said naught unto the Maid concerning the\r\ncreeping and the poisonous things; for I did mean that she have rest and\r\nhappiness the while that we did stay beside the fire-hole; and\r\nafterward, I should tell her, and so she be the more ready to see the\r\nproperness that we go elsewhere to our sleep. But, as you to understand,\r\nif that she not to see wisely and be still intent to the fire-hole, I\r\nshould have her to obey; for surely she was Mine Own, and I did love her\r\nand did mean alway to have her to safety.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, the Maid was something warmed, and afterward, she slipt\r\nthe scrip from my shoulder, and so had food and drink very swift to my\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nAnd we sat together, and eat and drank; and the Maid very sweet and\r\nquiet, as she did begin to eat her second tablet; and, truly, I had\r\nknowing that she did remember in all her body that I had whipt her. And,\r\nindeed, she did be utter mine.\r\n\r\nAnd oft as we did eat and drink, I lookt this way and that, so that no\r\ncreeping thing should come anigh to us; and presently, when we had made\r\nan end of our food, the Maid saw that I did look about, and she then\r\nvery swift to catch some of mine unease, and to stare over her shoulder.\r\nAnd, indeed, in a little while she saw a snake go among the rocks; and\r\nshe then to be very eager that we find some place that should be secure\r\nfrom creeping things. And we to begin then to look for such.\r\n\r\nBut in the end, we stayed in the hollow, for we found a little cave that\r\ndid be in an upstanding rock of the hollow, and the upstanding rock was,\r\nmayhaps, an hundred good feet off from the fire; for the hollow was very\r\ngreat. And the cave did be a hole that was thrice my height up from the\r\nbottom rocks; and it was dry and sweet and with no creeping thing within\r\nit, neither did there be any place to hide such therein.\r\n\r\nAnd when we were gotten into the hole, surely it did be very sweet and\r\ncozy; for the shine of the fire-hole did shine therein; and surely we\r\nhad felt it a very haven, but that there was ever the fear of the Land\r\nupon our hearts; and upon mine the more than upon the Maid; for, truly,\r\nMine Own did seem to trust me utter; and to seem that she feared not any\r\nevil monster, but to have surety that I had power to succour her in all\r\nways. And truly this trust had been very sweet unto my heart, if that I\r\nhad lacked somewhat of my terror for the safe home-going of Mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd we slept that night as we had done before, and shared the cloak over\r\nus; for truly, the fire-hole made no great warmth unto us; yet was it\r\nless bitter in that part than in the darkness of the Land.\r\n\r\nAnd by that we had come unto sleep, it was twenty good hours since last\r\nwe had slumber; and truly we did be very wearied; but yet came unto our\r\nrest with our spirits set anxious to harken on danger the while that we\r\ndid sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd we slept seven hours, and did know suddenly of some matter that had\r\nneed to waken us; and lo! in a moment I did wake, and the Maid in the\r\nsame instant of time; and there was a great screaming and crying out in\r\nthe night, that surely affrighted us both; yet did hurt our hearts the\r\nmore; for it did be the utter cryings and terror of poor humans in the\r\nnight of that Land. Yet might I do naught; but only wait that I learn\r\nmore of the matter; for my duty was unto Mine Own, and I had no leave of\r\nrashness any more.\r\n\r\nYet, as you do suppose, I was all shaken to go downward of the rock, and\r\nafterward to climb out from the hollow, that I should give some help\r\nunto they that did need help; but yet might I not leave the Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately, there was a great roaring in one part of the night, and\r\nagain another roaring in another part of the night; and lo! in a moment\r\nthe roarings did be answered; and the roarings were the sounds of big\r\nand husky voices; so that it did seem that we harked to men so big as\r\nhouses that did run and shout in the night.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid did begin to shake, and I put mine arm about her, and drew\r\nher backward into the hole so that she did be into the shadow; and she\r\nto tremble like one that was broken in courage; for, truly, she had\r\nheard those sounds oft in the night in all the long and dreadful month\r\nthat she had wandered.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, I was all shaken in my courage; for it did be the shouting\r\nof giants that I heard; and you do know somewhat of the utter horror and\r\nterror that did be alway in the heart that did harken unto those\r\nmonstrous voices, for you do know my tale.\r\n\r\nAnd there came in a moment, a dreadful screaming out in the night, and\r\nthe screaming did be the screaming of a young maid that doth be slain\r\nvery brutal. And my heart sickened, because of Mine Own; but my spirit\r\ndid swell with a strange and utter anger, as that it should burst my\r\nbody. And the Maid to my side broke into an utter sobbing.\r\n\r\nAnd the screaming of the maid afar off in the dark did end very sudden;\r\nbut in a moment there did be other screamings in diverse places, and the\r\nhoarse shoutings of the great men and the thudding of mighty feet that\r\nran this way and that, a-chase.\r\n\r\nAnd the cryings of the humans came nearer, and the thuddings of the\r\ngreat feet. And, in verity, in a little minute, it did seem unto me that\r\nthe sounds did be right upon the hollow; and I crept forward, and peered\r\nout. And I felt the night to be full of people running; and immediately\r\nthere passed by the hollow a clustering of humans that ran ever, and\r\nscreamed and gasped and wept, panting, as they ran. And the shining of\r\nthe fire-hole made them plain seen and clear, and they did be both men\r\nand women, and were but in rags or utter naked, and all torn by the\r\nrocks and the bushes, and did seem, indeed, as that they had been wild\r\nthings that did go by so swift and lost.\r\n\r\nAnd mine heart troubled me with the pain and longing that it did know;\r\nso that I had gone in a moment after those people, but that I should\r\nleave Mine Own and put her to peril. And even while that I felt so utter\r\nin this thing, there came a great thudding of monstrous feet; and there\r\nran four great men out of the night, and went past the hollow very\r\nquick. And three did be dull coloured and seeming much haired and\r\nbrutish; but the other did be an horrid white, and livid-blotched; so\r\nthat it did seem to my spirit that there went by, a thing that did be a\r\nvery man-monster filled of unwholesome life. And surely they did be gone\r\nfrom out of the shine of the fire, in one moment, as we do say; and\r\nagain into the night to their dreadful chasing.\r\n\r\nAnd when the thudding of their feet had gone a long way off over the\r\nLand, I heard them bellowing, and afterward a far away screaming, that\r\ndid have a death note in it; and I knew that those dreadful brute-men\r\ndid be taking the life from some poor wild humans; and afterward there\r\ndid be the silence again.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely, it did come to me with a fierce impatience of sorrow, that\r\nthose people did be without spirit of courage; else had they turned them\r\nupon the giants, and slain them with their hands, even if that all had\r\ndied to compass that slaying; for, truly, they should all die anywise by\r\nthe giant-men; and they had died then with somewhat to comfort their\r\nhate.\r\n\r\nYet, as I do know, the Peoples of the Lesser Redoubt had long been born\r\nof parents that were starved of the Earth-Current through an\r\nhundred-thousand years and more, and because of this thing, they did\r\nsurely lack somewhat in all ways. Yet was Naani otherwise; but this not\r\nto prove aught, save the rule, as we do say.\r\n\r\nNow, sudden, as I stooped very husht and troubled in the mouth of the\r\nlittle cave, I knew that Mine Own sobbed dryly in the back part of the\r\ncave. And I had gone to comfort her, but that in the same moment, I saw\r\na naked maid run very swift over the edge of the hollow, and did look\r\nover her shoulder, as she ran. And she came to the bottom, and crept in\r\nunder a ledge of rock that did be in that place; and she did seem utter\r\nworn, and gone of the spirit, and desperate. And I perceived in the same\r\ninstant why that she did go stealthy and swift in that fashion, and to\r\ncower, as for her very life; for there came a squat, haired man, so\r\nbroad as a bullock, who did come silent down into the hollow, looking\r\nthis way and that, even as a wild beast doth peer, very sudden.\r\n\r\nAnd the Squat Man had instant knowing of the place where the maid did\r\nbe; and ran in upon her, with no sound.\r\n\r\nAnd I paused not; but leaped all the great way unto the bottom of the\r\nhollow, which did be, mayhaps, twenty good feet and more; for mine anger\r\nwas upon me, and I did mean that I save that one, though I did be\r\npowerless to give succour unto those others.\r\n\r\nAnd I fell strong upon my feet, and had no harm of my limbs, for all\r\nthat the leap did be so high. And in that moment, before that I had time\r\nto save the maid, the Squat Man ript her; and she cried out once with a\r\nvery dreadful scream, and was suddenly dead in the hands of the\r\nBrute-Man.\r\n\r\nAnd my heart made my blood to burn with wrath in mine eyes, so that I\r\nhad scarce power in that instant to see the Squat Man, as I ran upon\r\nhim. And the roar of the Diskos filled all the hollow, as I made it to\r\nspin, as that it did rage with an anger, and to be glut of the Man.\r\n\r\nAnd the Man came round upon me; and thought, mayhaps, to deal with me,\r\nas it had dealt with that poor maid, but not all thatwise, as you must\r\nknow. And I swung the Diskos, and it did seem to sing and to cry eager\r\nin my hands. And I smote at the Squat Man, even as it did leap silent\r\nupon me, as a tiger doth leap, making no sound. But I gat not home the\r\nblow; for the Man dropt sudden down upon the hands, and the blow went\r\noverwards. And the Brute-Man caught me by the legs, to rip me; and I cut\r\nquick with the Diskos, and it did have but one monstrous talon left unto\r\nit. And immediately, it cast me with the other, half across the hollow,\r\nand I fell with mine armour clanging mightily, and the Diskos did ring\r\nlike a bell.\r\n\r\nAnd by the graciousness of all good things, I was harmed not by that\r\nmonster throw; but was to my feet in one instant, and had not loosed the\r\nDiskos from my hand. And the Beast-Man did be upon me with two quick\r\nboundings; and I stood up to the Man, and it made no sound or cry as it\r\ncame at me; and there did a great froth of brute anger and intent come\r\nfrom the mouth of it, and the teeth came down on each side of the mouth,\r\nvery great and sharp. And I leaped and smote, so that my blow should\r\ncome the more speedy, and the Diskos took away the head and the shoulder\r\nof the Squat Man; and the dead thing knockt me backward, with the spring\r\nthat it had made; but it harmed me not greatly. Yet afterward I did know\r\nhow sore and bruised I did be, in all my body and being. And I came back\r\nvery swift against the Man; but it did be truly dead and greatly horrid.\r\n\r\nAnd I went from the dead monster, and did go, all heart-shaken, unto the\r\ndead maid. And I took the torn body of the maid, very sorrowful, and\r\ncast it into the fire-hole.\r\n\r\nAnd I turned me then that I should look unto the cave, that I should\r\nknow that all did be well with Mine Own, and whether she did have seen\r\nthe horror, or be gone into a swoon.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! Mine Own did run toward me; and she had in her hand my\r\nbelt-knife which I did give her, before that time, to be a weapon for\r\nher defence. And I perceived that she had come to be mine aid, if that\r\nI did need such. And she did be utter pale, yet very steadfast and not\r\nseeming to tremble.\r\n\r\nAnd I made to take her from that place; but she went beyond me, and\r\nlookt at the monstrous bulk of the Squat Man; and was very silent. And\r\nshe came back unto me; and still so silent. And she stood before me, and\r\nsaid no word; but my heart knew what she did be thinking; for I am not\r\nfoolish, to have lacked to know what did be in her heart; though mine\r\neffort had not shown itself that way unto me, before that moment. And I\r\nhad no pretending of modesty, but received with gladness and a\r\nstrangeness of humbleness the honour that her eyes did give to me; for,\r\nindeed, she did be so, that she might not give word to her joy of me and\r\nher glad respecting, the which is so wondrous good unto the heart of all\r\nmen that do be loving of a dear and honest maid.\r\n\r\nAnd she said nothing, neither then nor afterward; but I did be honoured\r\nall my life after, when that I did anytime mind me of the way that Mine\r\nOwn lookt upward at me in those moments.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward she did need and allow herself to come unto mine arms,\r\nthat I hold her from the trembling of heart which did come to her, after\r\nthat there did be no need for courage; for surely we had both seen a\r\nvery dreadful thing, and there was a great horror upon us.\r\n\r\nAnd I climbed upward again to the little cave, and did help Naani; and\r\nwhen we were come there again, we did rest awhile. And presently we eat,\r\neach of us, two of the tablets and drank some of the water, and indeed\r\nwe were both utter thirsty.\r\n\r\nAnd in about an hour, after that we had harked very keen a time, we came\r\ndownward again from the cave, and had our gear with us; and we came up\r\nout of the hollow, and set forward with a great caution unto the olden\r\nsea-bed. And we came there in two long hours; for we went very slow and\r\nwith constant harkings; for the fear of the monstrous men was upon us.\r\nBut there came no harm anigh, neither did we perceive any disturbance in\r\nthe night of the Land.\r\n\r\nAnd we went down an hour into the olden sea-bed, and did go now the more\r\nswift; for our fear was something eased from us, because that we had\r\ncome away from that place where we had perceived so great and dread an\r\nhunting. But yet had we all care about us; for the giants surely to be\r\neverywhere in that Land; but yet, as I do think, they to roam more oft\r\nanigh to the fire-holes; for the humans did surely wander in such parts,\r\nthat they have warmth of the fires.\r\n\r\nAnd after we had gone downward an hour into the sea-bed, we turned\r\nsomewhat unto the South-West, and went for twelve great hours, and did\r\nnever be any huge space from the shore; for it did run that way, as you\r\ndo know. And I made to steer by the shinings of the Land, and with\r\nadvices from Mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end of the twelfth hour, I did count our distance, making\r\nthat we did walk somewhat of a certain speed; and by the tellings of the\r\nMaid, we did be surely come beyond the place of the Land where the\r\nPoison Gas did lie.\r\n\r\nAnd by this, it did be something after seventeen hours since we did\r\nsleep; and surely we did be very ready to have rest; for we had gone\r\nforward strongly, and with anxiousness; and truly my hurts did be come\r\nupon me, so that my whole body did ache; for the quick fight had been\r\nbitter, and I had been thrown very hard and brutal; and, indeed, it was\r\nwondrous that I had not been all smashed, only that the armour did save\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnd this doth show truly how hard and strong I did be; and Naani did\r\nspeak upon this, and was oft a-wonder, and at that time did beg me that\r\nI make some rest to cure my hurts; for she had not conceived that a man\r\ndid grow so strong and hardy; and, in verity, the men of the Lesser\r\nRedoubt did be soft-made and lacking of grimness, as I did perceive,\r\nboth through my reason and from her tellings; for they did lack the\r\nstrong life that doth breed where is the beat of the Earth-Current, as\r\nwe to have in the Mighty Pyramid. And this thing I have said somewise\r\nbefore this time.\r\n\r\nAnd because that we did be so wearied, I said unto Naani that we find a\r\nplace for our slumber, and she very willing, as I have shown, and to\r\ncounsel me likewise.\r\n\r\nYet did we search about in that gloom for a great hour more, and found\r\nno cave or hole to give us a safe refuge for our sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd when that we could not find such, I told Naani that we should put\r\nthe boulders together, somewhat, and so have them about us, that we be\r\ngreatly hid; and, in truth, even as I began to tell her my plan, she did\r\nhave the same words in her mouth, so that we caught our little fingers,\r\nthere in the dark of that grim Land in the end of the world, even as she\r\nand I had done oft in the early years, before that eternity, when that\r\nshe did be Mirdath the Beautiful. And we did both be silent, and after\r\nthat we had wished very solemn and earnest, we said each a name; even as\r\nlad and maid shall do in this age; and so to laughter and kist one the\r\nother. And truly, the world doth seem not to alter in the heart, as you\r\nshall think. And this was what I did find.\r\n\r\nAnd we set-to, and gathered together the boulders which did be very\r\nplentiful in that part. And she carry those that did be thin and flat,\r\nand I to roll those that did be great and round. And I made a place that\r\ndid be long and narrow; and afterward, I set the flat stones round the\r\nsides, that there be no little hole by which any creeping thing should\r\ncome inward to sting us in our sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward we gat inside; and surely it did be very cozy, as we do\r\nsay; but yet not so secure as I did wish, only that I could not shift to\r\nplan aught better. And, indeed, it should keep off from us any small\r\nthing, and should be like to save us from any monstrous Brute treading\r\nupon us; but otherwise, it did be but a poor affair.\r\n\r\nNow we eat two of the tablets, each, and drank some of the water, even\r\nas we had done in the sixth and the twelfth hours; and afterward we\r\nshared the cloak for our slumber; and we kist very sedate and loving,\r\nand charged our spirits that we wake if that any horrid thing should\r\ncome anigh to us in our sleep; and afterward we did be gone very swift\r\nto slumbering, and suffered no harm.\r\n\r\nAnd I waked seven hours after, and surely I did ache very bitter, as I\r\ndid move my body; for the bruisings did be gotten hold of me.\r\n\r\nAnd I slipt away from the Maid, very gentle; for I had mind that she\r\nsleep a while more, as I did mean that we make a great journey that day.\r\n\r\nAnd after I had harked a while, and perceived that there was no evil\r\nthing anigh, I went outward of the stones. And I walked to and fore and\r\nmoved mine arms, that I be eased somewhat of the stiffness and ache; but\r\nsurely it did seem that many hours must go ere I should make any speed\r\nof travel; for I did be all clumsy and slow and nigh to groan with the\r\npain of going and aught that I did.\r\n\r\nAnd I minded me that I should do somewhat to ease this thing, lest that\r\nI cause us both to come to an harm by staying over-long in that Land.\r\n\r\nAnd I went back into the stones, and gat an ointment from the pouch,\r\nthat I did carry. And surely the Maid did yet sleep. And I went outward\r\nof the stones, again; and stript off the armour, and all my garments;\r\nand I rubbed my body with the ointment, and surely the pain did be so\r\nthat I groaned at this time and that; but yet must I rub good and strong\r\nso that I die not of the cold of the Land; and beside I was greatly\r\nanxious to cure myself.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden, as I did rub very strong and savage, and heeding so well as\r\nI might that I groan not, the Maid did speak close beside me. And,\r\nindeed, she could see me but dimly, and had waked sudden to hear my\r\ngroaning, and I was not to her side. And immediately she had thought\r\nthat some evil thing harmed me, and was come in an instant that she be\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nAnd she cared not that I did be naked; but was utter in anger that I\r\nstrove to do this thing alone, and with none to aid me, and all\r\nuncovered to the chill of the Land. And she ran back into the stones,\r\nand brought the cloak and put it about me; and was so angered that she\r\nstampt, and had no impudence, but rather as that she did be minded to\r\nhave tears.\r\n\r\nAnd she sent me back into the sheltering of the stones, and gathered\r\nmine armour, and brought these things after me. But the Diskos I took in\r\nmy hand. And she took the pot of the ointment from me, and made me to\r\nlie, and she rubbed me very strong and tender, and kept me warm with\r\nthe cloak; and surely she was a wise and lovely Maid, and utter Mine\r\nOwn.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end, she askt me how I was, and I said that I did be\r\ndifferent; and she hurried me that I be clothed very quick; for she did\r\nbe sore afraid that I should come to a chill.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was gotten again into mine armour, she came to me, and showed\r\nme where I did lack wisdom, and spoke very straitly and gentle and\r\nserious; and afterward kist me, and gave me my tablets, and to sit\r\nbeside me. And we eat and drank; and I with a new lovingness unto Mine\r\nOwn; and she somewhat as that she did mother me; but when I put mine arm\r\nabout her, she did be only a maid. And we did be thus, with but little\r\ntalk and a great content.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, we gat our gear together, and went from that little\r\nrefuge that we had made; and in a while we did go upward out of the\r\nolden sea-bed.\r\n\r\nAnd when we were come again to the top of the shore, the which we did in\r\ntwo good hours, I lookt over the Land, a time, with Mine Own anigh to\r\nme. And I perceived that the Great Red Fire-Pit of the Giants did be no\r\nmighty way off unto the South and West; and surely in a little moment,\r\nwe saw that there went monstrous figures against the shine of the mighty\r\nfire-pit; and we stoopt unto the earth; for it did seem that the light\r\ndid be like to show us standing there, though truly we did be afar off,\r\nas you perceive. Yet, mayhaps, you do share with us the utter horror and\r\ndistress that those horrid Men did cast about the heart, and so have a\r\nkindly understanding of our fear.\r\n\r\nAnd over all the Land, in this place and that, there did be the small\r\nshining of little fire-holes and pits, that did be alway red, save in\r\nthat part where the Poison Gas did lie, the which we had now come safe\r\npast.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond the fire-holes, was the great Shine, that lay from the West\r\nunto the North of all that Land; and, in verity, we did need that we\r\nsteer so that we come not anigh to it, neither unto the Great Red\r\nFire-Pit of the Giants; neither unto the low volcanoes, which were\r\nbeyond the Great Red Fire-Pit, as you do know, and someways unto the\r\nMouth of the Upward Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd the way of our journey was between the West and the South-West of\r\nthat Land; and to be made with cunning and wisdom, that we come clear of\r\nall unseemly danger unto Mine Own. And I askt her concerning this thing\r\nand that of the Land; and surely she told me so much of terror that I\r\nwas half in a wonder that ever I did live in the end to come unto her.\r\n\r\nAnd it was because of the things that she set out to me, that I\r\nperceived how we must come nowise anigh to the low volcanoes that were\r\nupon this side of the mouth of the Upward Gorge; for it had been known\r\nalway in the Lesser Redoubt that there went very horrid men in that\r\npart that did be called wolf-men; but whether there did be any such\r\nthing in that age, she had no knowing; for she told me the things that\r\ndid be set down in the Records and the Histories; and truly no man of\r\nthe Lesser Redoubt had found heart in a thousand great years to make a\r\njourneying through the Land, for the desire of glad and dreadful\r\nadventuring, such as our young men did be oft set to; though it was not\r\nall such that went.\r\n\r\nAnd because there did be no adventuring for so monstrous a space of\r\nyears, there was no certain new knowledge of the Land of that age. And\r\nthis thing is plain to you, and needing not of many words, which do so\r\nirk me.\r\n\r\nAnd Naani set out to me how that The Shine was conceived to be a land\r\nwhere Evil did live for ever, and whence came all those Forces of Evil\r\nthat did work upon the Lesser Refuge. And afterward, she did quiet; so\r\nthat presently I perceived that she did weep to herself, because that\r\nher memory was all new-stirred by my questionings. And I took her very\r\ngentle into mine arms, as we did be there kneeled upon the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd after that time, I askt her no question, save as it did be needful\r\nto our health and life; yet oft did she tell me this thing and that of\r\nher knowledge, to be for mine help and guiding.\r\n\r\nNow we went forward, going a space toward the North-West, so that we\r\ncome the more clear of the place where did be the Great Red Fire-Pit of\r\nthe Giants. And we journeyed with a care alway that we show not\r\nourselves over-plain unto the light that shone over the Land from the\r\ngreat Pit; and oft we did creep a while over this stark place and that;\r\nand went nimbly amid the bushes that grew oft in great parts.\r\n\r\nAnd we made six hours this way, and did then have pause, that we eat and\r\ndrink; and truly it was nine hours since first I did wake; yet had we\r\nmade no pausing, because that we were so set to our journeying to come\r\nclear of the place where did be the Giants.\r\n\r\nAnd after that we had eat and drunk, we went onward again; and made now\r\nunto the South-West; for we did heed that we go no more unto the\r\nNorth-West, because that should bring us over-near to The Shine.\r\n\r\nAnd in the fourteenth hour of that day\'s travel, we came to a part where\r\nthe Land dipt downward into a broad valley; and surely it did be very\r\ndark down there, and did be seeming shallow, yet truly of a great\r\ndeepness; but we went that way, because that it did be a weary long\r\njourney to go around the place where the valley did be.\r\n\r\nAnd the Valley had a different darkness from the gloom that went alway\r\nin the olden sea-bed; for the gloom of the sea-bed did be ever of a\r\ngreyness; but the gloom of this Valley had a greater dark within it; yet\r\ndid the air seem more clear.\r\n\r\nAnd we went downward three hours into the Valley, and stopt then that\r\nwe eat and drink; and truly I had not paused then; but that Mine Own did\r\ninsist; for our methods did be like, else, to go all adrift, and we to\r\nbe lacking of proper strength.\r\n\r\nAnd this was wisdom of the Maid; but I to be a little irked-like and\r\nrestless; and this mayhap because that my blood did itch me, because\r\nthat it did be so full of the poison of my bruises.\r\n\r\nAnd it was gone now of seventeen hours since last we did sleep; but yet\r\ndid we be ready to go forward, that we come so quick as maybe out of the\r\ndark of that Valley; for there did seem nowheres any fire-hole to make a\r\nlight; only that in this place and that, there did be a little blue\r\nshining, as that there burned a strange gas in this part or that.\r\n\r\nNow, in two hours after the time that we did eat, we stopt, both of us,\r\nvery sudden; for there did be some vague and curious sound in the night.\r\nAnd we went very swift to the earth, that we be hid, and harked. But did\r\nhear nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd in a while, we to go onward again; yet there did be an unease upon\r\nour spirits; for our spirits did perceive something afar off in the\r\nnight; but yet had we no surety in this matter.\r\n\r\nAnd we went forward through a great hour more; and did pass in that\r\ntime, two places where the blue-shining did be; and truly it seemed as\r\nthat a low gas hung to the earth in this part and that, and made a slow\r\nburning, having neither noise nor spurtings; but slow, as that it did\r\nsmoulder and be all to shine and luminous. And oft there did be a strong\r\nsmelling of a bitter gas, very horrid in the throat.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end of another hour, while that we were a space off from one\r\nof those gas-shinings, there went past us at a distance, as it did seem\r\npeople, running in the night; as that they did be lost spirits; yet with\r\na rustling very soft; so that they did be like to be barefoot.\r\n\r\nAnd I thought mayhap that these did be some of the Peoples of the Lesser\r\nPyramid; yet did they be only as that shadows went among the\r\nblue-shinings. And I pondered a moment, whether that I send my voice\r\nover the Valley, to question what they did be; but yet had caution, and\r\nharked through the utter silence of the night; for I had no surety of\r\naught.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely, in that moment that we harked very keen, there did be a\r\nsound afar off in the night of the Land; and it was as that we had heard\r\nthe sound before; and, in verity, our spirits had perceived the sound,\r\nthose two hours back; and now our bodies did wot, and perceived that we\r\nhad known it subtly before that moment. And the sound was as that\r\nsomething went spinning in the night.\r\n\r\nAnd a very great terror came upon the Maid; for she did know the sound;\r\nand the sound was that which did show that one of the great Evil Forces\r\nof the Land did approach; and the sound had been known alway in the\r\nLesser Refuge to show this thing. And, indeed, mine own spirit had been\r\nhalf to know that a Power of Evil did come through the night; but yet\r\nwas the assurance very terrible; for how should I protect Mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd the spinning came toward us, and was presently in the Valley; and it\r\ncame swiftly across the dark of the Valley. And my heart was all broken\r\nwithin me, because that there had been happiness with us, but a little\r\ntime gone; and now there did be our death anigh.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own gave me the knife that I had given to her; meaning that I\r\nslay her, in the last moment; for she did heed even in that moment that\r\nshe be not gashed horridly by the terror of the Diskos. And I took the\r\nknife. And I kist not Mine Own; but stood there, very shaken and\r\ndesperate, and gript her fast unto me, scarce heeding the hardness of my\r\ngripe; and alway I lookt unto the way of the coming of the Sound. And\r\npresently did unbare my wrist where the Capsule did be.\r\n\r\nAnd the sound of the thing Spinning came anigh, across the Valley; and\r\nmy heart did dull and my spirit go black with my desperateness, because\r\nthat this thing must be, and because that I could nowhere see hope that\r\nI should save Mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd, of a sudden, the Maid put up her arms, and pulled me downward, and\r\nkist me once on the lips; but I wot not whether I kist her; for I did\r\nburn with despair and was all adrift in my being. Yet was there a sharp\r\ncomfort that mine own dying did be so nigh.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid stood gently against me; so that she did be convenient unto\r\nmy hand. And afterward I remembered this thing; and do you pray that you\r\nbe never to have such a matter on your hearts! But, indeed, there was a\r\nwonder in this thing, beside the horror; so that my memory doth be alway\r\nknowing of this wonder; and mayhap you do see with me, and love Mine Own\r\nalso in your hearts. And in the moment that the Maid stood thus, as I\r\nhave told, I perceived sudden that there did be a little glowing in the\r\nnight, and the glowing was pale and horrid. And there was no more any\r\nsound of the Spinning; only there did be, as it were, the trunk of a\r\ngreat tree, that did show in the glowing; and the trunk of the tree came\r\ntoward us across the darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd I turned the Maid from the Tree, and she did flutter a little in my\r\nhands, as I did know, scarce-knowing; for she perceived that she did be\r\ngoing to die in that moment. And I had my body thus between the Evil\r\nThing and the Maid. And lo! the Tree came no more anigh to us; but went\r\nbackward, and the pale glowing did fade, and the Tree no more to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nAnd I cried unto the Maid, very husky, that we did live; for that the\r\nEvil Power was gone off from us; but she answered not, and did be heavy\r\nagainst me. And I held her, and lookt alway about us, lest the Tree come\r\nin upon the other side.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I lookt this way and that, I saw naught; and afterward, in a\r\nmoment, I searched the night above, lest that the Thing come from\r\nabove. And, behold, I saw that there abode over us a clear light, as it\r\nwere a clear burning Circle, above us in the night. And my heart did\r\nleap with an holy joy and an utter great thankfulness; and I was no more\r\nin fear of the Tree; for, in verity, there fought for our souls one of\r\nthose sweet Powers of Goodness, that did strive ever to stand between\r\nthe Forces of Evil and the spirit of man; and this matter have I shown\r\nto you, before this time.\r\n\r\nAnd concerning this holy Defense, I have thought that it should not,\r\nmayhap, to have had so strong a power to save us, if that we had shown\r\nan over-weakness and fear, but because that we did rather stand so well\r\nas we might to make battle of escape from so dire a Destruction.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely, this doth seem but a sane thinking unto me; but yet without\r\nproof, and to be said to you, only as the shapings of my thoughts. And\r\nthis the chief end of that happening, that the holy Circle did truly\r\ndeliver us, and burned through twelve great hours above us; and by this,\r\ndo I know that the Evil Power hovered anigh, to destroy us, all that\r\nwhile; for, indeed, it doth not be proper of reason to suppose that such\r\nan utter wondrous thing did be needlessly over us, save to be a Shield\r\nof Great and Lovely Force against a waiting Evil Thing. And surely you\r\ndo see thiswise with me?\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, so soon as my Spirit and Reason perceived that we did be no\r\nmore to suffer from the Evil Thing, I remembered that I did know that\r\nMine Own had swooned. And, in verity, you shall mind how that she did\r\nface her death so utter sweet and brave, and had given no cry, but made\r\nquietly to help me in that dreadful moment, and did stand brave and\r\ngentle to the stroke. And so fell into a swoon, as you have seen,\r\nbecause that she did suffer an hundred deaths as she did stand so brave,\r\nwaiting to be slain, for the blow did be so long delayed, yet to come in\r\nany moment.\r\n\r\nAnd I gat her to come-to unto her life again, and I set the lovely tale\r\nvery swift to ease her, and surely with love and warmth, and kist her\r\nwith a great joy. And I showed how I did honour her for her good\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nAnd she to weep a little, with the ease come so sudden upon her; and\r\nafterward to kiss me upon the lips an hundred times, and to need that\r\nshe be very safe in mine arms, because that I had meant that I do so\r\ndread an office to her. And surely I do wonder whether you perceive all\r\nthat did be then in her heart.\r\n\r\nAnd the holy light that did be over us, she did watch with a sweetness\r\nof awe; and rest did come more great upon her in the heart, as she did\r\nlearn how sure was the seeming of that Lovely Power to deliver us.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, we made forward again in the Valley. And did go\r\nsteadfast, and newly-loving each to the other, and so through twelve\r\ngreat and body-weary hours; but our hearts could never be done singing\r\nwithin us, nor our hands to cease from the hands of the other, because\r\nthat we did so crave each unto the beloved.\r\n\r\nAnd in the ninth hour, a monstrous way off in the dark of the Valley,\r\nthere did seem as that there went a far and dreadful screaming in the\r\nnight. And it did be as that our spirits perceived the sound of\r\nsomething Spinning in the night; yet faint and a great way off; but yet\r\nhad we no surety that we did truly hear the sound of the Spinning; only\r\nwe did be so shaken in the heart, for truly there was some horror done\r\nunto humans, downward in the mighty darkness of the Valley. And to think\r\nupon the sound of the Spinning, was to be in a shaking trouble of the\r\nspirit; and to bless the quiet and holy light that went above us in all\r\nthat time; and to ache only that it should stay to be to our protecting.\r\nAnd surely it did be plain that there were the signs of great Forces in\r\nthat Land.\r\n\r\nAnd three hours after that time when we did hear the far-off screaming,\r\nwe were come up over the edge of the Valley, and did be once more unto\r\nsuch light as did be general in the Land; and truly it did seem a\r\nwondrous lightness, after so utter a dark.\r\n\r\nAnd we did be all exhaust, and Mine Own drew her feet so weary that it\r\nwas as that she must go no more, until we did rest; for indeed it was\r\nthree and thirty hours since last that we had slept; and a bitter\r\ntrouble and work there had been in that space, as you do know.\r\n\r\nNow we had eat some of the tablets a few hours back, as we did walk, and\r\nhad drunk some of the water; but had made no rest; for we did crave only\r\nthat we come free of that Valley. And now it was needful that we rest,\r\nif but a little time.\r\n\r\nAnd I minded that we find some place where I should have a hot pool,\r\nthat I be able to bathe Naani\'s feet. And, surely, we came in a while to\r\na hollow-place, and there did be two dull-burning fire-holes in this\r\nplace, and a hot-bubbling spring, the which did seem to be a rare thing\r\nin that Land; so that we were the more fortunate to perceive it.\r\n\r\nAnd I made Mine Own to sit, with her feet in the hot-spring; for it was\r\nnot over-hot, and did seem pretty natural to my taste, as I did prove in\r\nthe first. And also I did search about the hollow, lest there be any\r\nharmful creature near-by; and this you will have truly supposed, because\r\nyou do know the methods of my journeying. But yet did I not have so much\r\ncare as did be proper; for I was so dull in the mind, by reason of my\r\nweariness; but, indeed, there came naught to work us any harm; and so we\r\ncame to no suffering, through mine aches and dullness.\r\n\r\nAnd I sat beside the Maid, and made her to eat a tablet, and saw that\r\nthe cloak did be nice about her, and her head to rest against my knee,\r\nand I laid the palm of my hand to be as a pillow, because of the armour,\r\nto ease the hardness.\r\n\r\nAnd I eat with the Maid, and we both drank after; and so there came\r\nback somewhat of our strength. Then I took the Maid\'s little feet, and\r\nrubbed a portion of the ointment from the pot all about them, very\r\ngentle and constant; and so did they be new-rested and eased; and she\r\npresently fit again to the journey; for I was strong set that we go\r\nquickly hence out of that Land, and stay no more there to sleep, lest we\r\ncome unto Destruction.\r\n\r\nAnd when we had rested an hour, I put the shoes again upon the Maid, and\r\nmade them secure; and so gat my gear about me, and made to the journey.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as we did leave the hollow, I lookt upward unto the Holy Light;\r\nand behold it was gone from us, and by this thing I supposed that we had\r\ncome free of instant danger; but yet did there be to me a seeming of\r\nnakedness and unprotection, as you must perceive.\r\n\r\nAnd because that the Light was vanished, I was the more set that we come\r\nspeedy out of the Land. And we went forward at a strong speed, and had\r\nthe Great Red Fire-Pit of the Giants to our rear unto the left, and a\r\nmighty way off in the night; but yet I did wish it the further. And\r\nbefore us, was a small ridging up of the dark Land, as I did judge,\r\nbecause that our view of the lights and the shinings was bounded; and to\r\nour left at a great way the low volcanoes, and somewhat to our right,\r\nacross all that part of the Land went the cold and horrid glare of the\r\nShine.\r\n\r\nNow, in a little while, I felt that the ground did be sloped upward\r\nbefore us a little, and by this thing I saw that I had known aright, for\r\nthat there did be a ridge that hid the Land somewise over unto the part\r\nwhere I lookt to find the mouth of the Upward Gorge. And we went up this\r\nslope at a strong pace, because that I was so eager that I find where we\r\ndid be in nearness unto the mouth of the Upward Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I was something forgetful, in mine eagerness, and came\r\nsomewhat ahead of Mine Own, who did make to hide from me that she did\r\nbegin to lag, because that her new strength was near gone from her.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden there did be a very dreadful cry, to my back; and I came\r\nround in one instant, so quick as a light doth flash; for it was the\r\nvoice of Mine Own, and all my being did suddenly burn with fear that\r\nkindled through me in a moment of thought.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! Mine Own did struggle terribly with a yellow thing which I\r\nperceived to be a man with four arms; and the Man had two arms about the\r\nMaid, and with two did make to choke her unto death; for she cried out\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nAnd I came unto the Man with a quick leaping, and stopt not to pluck the\r\nDiskos from my hip; and surely I did be very strong, and mine anger and\r\nrage to make me monstrous; for I caught the two upper arms of the Man,\r\nand brought them backward in an instant, so fierce and savage, and so\r\nwrencht upon them, that I brake them in the shoulders of the Man.\r\n\r\nAnd the Man roared and shriekt, even as a wild and dreadful Beast should\r\ncry out, and came round upon me with the two lower arms. And surely it\r\nwas a mighty and brutish thing, and so broad and bulkt as an ox, and the\r\nlower arms were huge and greatly haired, and the fingers of the hands\r\ndid have the nails grown into horrid talons, as that they should grip\r\nvery bitter.\r\n\r\nAnd it caught me by the thighs, to rip me upward, as I did fear; but yet\r\nthis did not be the intent of the Man; for in a moment it caught me\r\nround the body; and on the instant, I gat the Man by the great throat,\r\nand the throat did be haired, and so great as the neck of a bull. And I\r\nstrove with mine armoured hands that I choke the Man, and surely I made\r\nit to suffer great trouble; yet, I could not harm it in the life.\r\n\r\nAnd so I did be an horrid minute, and fought with the Beast, with no\r\nmore than the strength of my body; and it was as that an human went with\r\nhis hands to slay a monster so strong as an horse. And the breath of the\r\nMan-Beast came at me, and did sicken me; and I held the face off from\r\nme; for I had died with horror, if that it had come more anigh; and\r\nsurely the mouth of the Man was small and shaped so that I knew that it\r\ndid never eat of aught that it did slay; but to drink as a vampire; and\r\nin truth, I did mean that I chop the Man to pieces, if that I have\r\nchance to the Diskos.\r\n\r\nAnd I did sway this way and that, as we did struggle; and surely it was\r\nas that the Man had never made to use the lower arms, save to hold unto\r\nprey, the while that it did use the upper arms to strangle, as I do\r\nthink. For all that weary minute of the fight, the Man made not to loose\r\nfrom me, that it should tear my hands from their grip to the throat; but\r\nmade vain waggings with the arms that I brake, as that it would use\r\nthese to the attack; but surely they had no more power to do hurt.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden, it put forth an utter power about my body, so that mine\r\narmour did be like to crack; and truly I had died in a moment; but for\r\nthe strongness of the armour. And the man hugged me thus for an horrid\r\ntime, the while that I did hold off from me the brutish face, and gript\r\nvery savage into the haired throat.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! the creature did work slow in the brain, and in the end loost\r\nfrom me, abrupt, and went back with a leap, so that my hands did be ript\r\nfrom the throat of the Beast. And in one instant it did be back unto me,\r\nand gave me no moment to free the Diskos. But I made anew to fight, and\r\nshaped as I had learned in the Exercises of mine Upbringing; for truly I\r\nhad been alway deep in practice of such matters. And I slipt from the\r\ngreat hands of the Man, as it did try to take me by the head; and I hit\r\nthe Man with mine armoured fist, and put a great power and skill to the\r\nblow. And I went instant to the side with a swift stepping, and evaded\r\nthe Man, and I smote the Man again, and took him very savage in the\r\nneck; but all the while grown very cold and brutal and cruel; for I was\r\nset to the slaying. And the Man-Beast came round on me; and lo! I slipt\r\nthe gripe of the great hands, and my body and my legs and mine arms did\r\nwork together unto that last blow; so that I did hit so hard as a great\r\nhammer. And I gat the Beast in the throat, and the Beast went backward\r\nto the earth, even as it did think to hold me.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in a moment, I was free, and I pluckt forth the Diskos from my\r\nhip. And the Yellow Beast-Man grunted upon the ground; and it rose up\r\nagain to come at me; and it stood and did grunt, and did seem as that it\r\nwas gone mazed; for it did make other sounds, and an horrid screeching,\r\nso that truly, by the way of it, I conceived that it cried out unknown\r\nand half-shapen words at me. And in a moment, it came again at me; but I\r\ncut the head from the Beast-Man, that was in verity an horrid monster,\r\nand the Man died, and was quiet upon the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, in that moment, the distress of mine efforts and mine utter\r\ntiredness and the ache of the bruises took me; so that I do surely think\r\nI rockt as I stood; but yet was my head strong to think and my heart set\r\nin anxiousness; for I wotted not how great an hurt had been done upon\r\nMine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd I ran to her, and came to where she did be upon the ground; and\r\nsurely she was all huddled, and had her hands very piteous to her\r\nthroat, that did be so pretty. And it did shake me in that moment that\r\nshe was truly slain; for she was gone so utter still and as that she did\r\nbe broken unto death.\r\n\r\nAnd I took her hands from her throat, and surely it did be a little\r\ntorn; yet not to be much, or so that it should loose her of her dear\r\nlife. And I strove that I steady the trembling of my hands; and I gat\r\nfree of mine armoured gloves; and made that I feel whether her throat\r\ndid be deadly hurt; and, in verity, it seemed not so; only that my hands\r\ndid so shake, because that I was so frightened for Mine Own, and because\r\nthat I was but new come from the battle; and because of this, I had not\r\npower of touch to assure me.\r\n\r\nI made then that I quieten my breath, which did yet come very full and\r\nlaboured; and I put mine ear above the heart of the Maid, and lo! her\r\nheart did beat, and the horridness of my fear went from me in a moment.\r\n\r\nAnd I had the scrip from my back very speedy, and some of the water to\r\nfizz, and I dashed the water upon her face and upon her throat; and\r\nsurely there did be a little quivering and an answering of her body.\r\n\r\nAnd I strove with her for a while more; and she came unto her life\r\nagain; and in the first, she was all a-lack, as you may think; and\r\nimmediately she began that she remembered, and she then to shake.\r\n\r\nAnd I told her how that the Four-Armed Man was surely dead and could\r\nharm her no more; and she then to weep, because that she had been put\r\nto such shock and horror, and held by so brutish a thing. But I took her\r\ninto mine arms, and so she did come presently to an ease; and I\r\nperceived in all my being that she was as a little ship that doth lie in\r\nharbour; for she did cling and nestle unto me; and did be safe with me\r\nin all her heart and body and belief. And surely she was Mine Own, and I\r\nto have glory in that knowing.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I put her from mine arms, to lie; yet so that she might\r\nnot perceive the body of the Yellow Beast-Man. And I made clean the\r\nDiskos, from her sight, and afterward I put on the scrip; and I took the\r\nMaid to mine arms again, and had the Diskos in my hand beside her.\r\n\r\nAnd she made protest that she should truly walk; for that I was all\r\na-weary, and she come to her strength again. And, indeed, I carried her\r\na certain way, and did then put her down to her feet; and truly her\r\nknees did so tremble that she had not stood, let be to walk! And I\r\ncaught her up again; and I kist her, and I told her that I did be surely\r\nher Master, in verity, and she mine own Baby-Slave. And truly you shall\r\nnot laugh upon me; for I was so human as any; and a man doth talk this\r\nway with his maid.\r\n\r\nAnd she did be quiet and sweet and to obey wisely; for she was gone very\r\nweak. And thiswise we did go; and I to say loving words, in the first;\r\nbut afterward I did heed more of my going, now that she was something\r\neased and at rest within mine arms. And I did peer everywhere about,\r\nlest that some other evil thing come outward of the bushes, to have at\r\nus ere I did ware. And, truly, the bushes grew here and there in that\r\nplace, very plentiful, in great dumpings.\r\n\r\nAnd presently I was come to the top part of the ridge; and lo! a great\r\ngladness took me, and some amazement; for there did be the lights that\r\ndid be in the mouth of the Upward Gorge, and they did show me that I was\r\ncome anigh to that place. Yet had I feared that we were surely a dozen\r\ngreat miles off; and now I to learn that we did be scarce of two or\r\nmaybe three, as I did judge.\r\n\r\nAnd I told this thing to the Maid; and she rejoiced in mine arms, with a\r\ndeep and quiet thankfulness. And I set forward then at so good a pace as\r\nI might; and I was come into the mouth-part of the Upward Gorge in about\r\nan hour; and surely I did be very weary, for it was beyond six and\r\nthirty hours that we had gone since last we did sleep; and there had\r\nbeen sore labour and terror to our share in that time, as I have told.\r\n\r\nAnd I turned in the mouth of the Gorge, and told Mine Own, very gentle,\r\nthat we did take our last look upon that Land. And she askt that I put\r\nher down to her feet; and I put her down. And therewith we stood in that\r\nplace, and mine arm about her; and so did I support the Maid, the while\r\nthat she lookt silent over the dark of the Land.\r\n\r\nAnd presently she askt me in a very husht voice, whether that I knew\r\nwhere the Lesser Pyramid did be in all that Darkness; for she was all\r\nadrift of her bearings, and was as a stranger, because that she had\r\nnever lookt upon the Land from that place, before then. And I showed her\r\nwhere I thought the Pyramid to stand hid in the everlasting night; and\r\nshe nodded, very quiet, as that she did think thatwise, also.\r\n\r\nAnd so a time did pass, and I knew that Naani said good-bye forever unto\r\nall that she had known of the world in all her life; and she did be\r\nwhispering a goodbye in her soul unto her Dead.\r\n\r\nAnd I was very husht, and deeply sorrowful for the Maid, and did\r\nunderstand; for in verity, there should no other human look upon that\r\nLand of terror through all the quiet of eternity; and the Maid did lose\r\nall her young life into that blackness, and the Father that was her\r\nFather; and the grave of her Mother; and the friends of all her years.\r\nAnd there went death in the Land, even then, after those that did live.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own shook a little within mine arm; so that I knew she strove\r\nthat she be brave, to weep not; but afterward, she made not to cease\r\nfrom her tears; and truly I was there, to be her understanding; and she\r\ndid be sweet and natural ever with me; for she was Mine Own, and did be\r\nhourly the more so.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I moved a little, to sign that we go downward of the\r\nGorge; and she stayed me one moment, that she look once more over all\r\nthat Land; and afterward, she submitted, and turned with me, and did\r\nbreak into very bitter sobbing as she did go stumbling beside me; for\r\nthe sorrow of memory did fill her; and she was truly a very lonesome\r\nMaid in that moment, and had come through much dreadfulness.\r\n\r\nAnd in a minute, I stoopt and lifted her; and she wept in mine arms\r\nagainst mine armour; and I very silent and tender with her; and carried\r\nher downward of the Gorge for a great hour more. And presently she was\r\ngrown calm, and I knew that she slept in mine arms.\r\n\r\nAnd in thiswise we made farewell of that dark Land, and left it unto\r\nEternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nDOWNWARD OF THE GORGE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I carried the Maid an hour downward of the Gorge, as I did say; and\r\nI was then grown so weary that I near fell, as I walked, and stumbled\r\neverywhile, because that I had lost somewhat of guiding in my feet, the\r\nwhich did show mine utter alackness.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw that I must come very swift to a place for slumber, or that I\r\ndid be like to fall headlong with the Maid; for I nigh slept as I walkt.\r\n\r\nAnd I began that I give attention to the sides of the Gorge; and surely\r\nI had gone that hour all in a dream; for I was fresh-waked, as it were,\r\nin that I did give my will to perceive aught; and when I did come to\r\nhave power to attend, I knew that I had gone, even as a sleep-walker;\r\nfor the Gorge did seem a fresh matter unto me, and as that I had come\r\nawake sudden to find myself a-walk in that strange and narrow place.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I saw somewhat where I did be; for I minded the memory of\r\nmine outward journey, and truly I have a good power to know and remember\r\na way that I have gone. And I saw that there was a great and ruddy\r\nfire-hole anigh to me; and I was all sure that I had perceived certain\r\ncaves in the wall of the Gorge, near to that fire, as I past it on mine\r\nupward way; and I had been given a mighty longing of heart at that time,\r\nthat it be given to me that I should bring safe Mine Own out of the\r\nperil that beset her, and have her unto just such a place for her\r\nslumber, on the way of our journey backward.\r\n\r\nAnd surely I tell you this thing as a child in pleasure; for, truly, it\r\nwas a wondrous happy matter that my desiring should be like to have a\r\ntrue ending; as, indeed, it did seem was truly to be, if that my memory\r\nhad set me aright.\r\n\r\nAnd I went onward somewhat; and lo! I to be right, for the little caves\r\ndid be there, a little past the great fire-hole; and there were seven of\r\nthem in the left side of the great cliff of the Gorge; and one did be as\r\nthat it were very cozy and a place of sure safety, if that we could win\r\nunto it.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, as I did conceive, we had come safe from the Evil Forces of\r\nthat Land; but yet did I mind that there was no surety in this thing;\r\nand neither did I know but that some Monster should come downward of the\r\nGorge, out of that Land; and so work our deaths, as we did sleep; if\r\nthat we have no sure place for our slumber. And, indeed, I had wished\r\nthat we were come a greater way downward of the Gorge, but this might\r\nnot be; for I was all adrift with weariness. And truly, if that we gat\r\nupward to the top-most cave, there did be few Monsters that should have\r\npower to come at us, ere we be warned of their coming. And afterward\r\nthey should be like to come upward against the Diskos; and this should\r\nbe indeed a thing difficult, as you shall conceive.\r\n\r\nNow it did be needful that I wake the Maid, and I kist her, as she did\r\nbe in mine arms; and surely that dear One did kiss back again in her\r\nsleep, and was yet asleep. And truly I did love her with all my being;\r\nand I kist her again, and shook her very gentle, and so had her to\r\nwakefulness, and told how we did be come to a place fit for our slumber.\r\n\r\nAnd she to look about, very sleepy, as I set her to her feet; and then\r\nto upbraid herself that she did over to slumber, the while that I did\r\nlabour with her carrying. And, in verity, I kist her again, as she did\r\nstand making to steady herself, and looking so pretty with the sleep\r\nthat did lie yet in her eyes. And she to kiss me very dear and all mine;\r\nand even then scarce proper come to wakefulness; and did say with\r\nsomething of a little dear abandon, that she did love me utter and\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I climbed to the topmost of the caves, and told Mine Own\r\nthe while that she walk up and down a little; so that she come to a full\r\nawakedness; and this I was careful to, because that she should have a\r\nneed of all her powers that she come safe upward unto the cave.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was come to the cave, lo! it did be so sweet and dry, as did\r\nmake glad my heart. And there did be a warmth in the cave, as that there\r\nwent a fire somewhere through the rocks anigh. And the light from the\r\nfire-hole did make a reflection inward, and so this did seem a place\r\nsafe, and fit to our slumbering.\r\n\r\nAnd I came downward unto Naani, calling that the cave was very proper\r\nfor our use; and presently I gave her mine aid to the climbing, and so\r\nwe came in the end safe into the cave; and truly we did feel very safe\r\nand happy.\r\n\r\nYet, before we did sleep, I set free the scrip and the pouch, and took\r\nthe straps and went downward again into the Gorge; and I gat a good\r\nboulder, so heavy as I might carry, and strapt it to my back, and came\r\nupward again to the cave, and the Maid very grave and anxious, lest that\r\nI slip to my hurt. And when I was come to the cave again, I set the\r\nboulder in the mouth of the cave, and did balance it so light upon the\r\nedge, that a touch should send it rolling downward.\r\n\r\nAnd by this devising, I conceived that any Beast or Monstrous thing that\r\nshould climb upward whilst that we slept, should be like to set the\r\nrock adrift, and mayhaps the rock to work an harm to such, but the\r\nchief end to be that I should be swiftly waked by the noise.\r\n\r\nAnd then I did turn that we go to our slumber; and lo! the Maid had\r\nspread the cloak upon the rock, that we should sleep upon it; for truly\r\nthere did be no need that we have it now to our covering, because that\r\nthe cave did be so warm as I have told before.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, there did be no cause either that I should have the cloak\r\nfor a bed; for how should I perceive any softness from the cloak,\r\nthrough all the sternness of mine armour; but yet did I see that the\r\nMaid had made a couch that should be for the two of us, and did be so\r\nsweet and natural, and to lie by me; but yet to preserve her sweet\r\nmodesty, and to do the thing with no thought, save that it was natural\r\nto our hearts; and that she did long alway to be anigh to me; but yet,\r\nmayhaps, scarce full conscious that her heart did prompt her in this\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I loved her very dear.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, Naani showed me the where that I should lie upon my side;\r\nand when I had obeyed, she kneeled, and kist me on the lips, very sober\r\nand loving; and she lay down then upon the cloak beside me; and truly we\r\nhad both gone to sleep in one little minute, as I do think.\r\n\r\nNow I did be waked twelve great hours after, by the fizzing of the\r\nwater; and lo! when I lookt, the Maid was not beside me; but did make\r\nready our simple eating and drinking. And she laughed at me, very sweet\r\nand tender, because that she loved me so, and did be so glad to have me\r\nawake to her; and she came over to me, and kist me, very bright and\r\nloving upon the lips.\r\n\r\nAnd after that she had kist me, she kneeled beside me, and lookt at me,\r\nvery dear and tender; so that I knew in a moment that she had waked a\r\nwhile gone, and watched me, somewise motherlike, as I did sleep. But how\r\nI knew this thing, I am not sure, save that my spirit did know, or that\r\nher thoughts did have tongues unto mine.\r\n\r\nAnd truly I needed that I be so loved, and all of you to say like with\r\nme; and I put up mine arms to her, as I did yet lie; and she not to deny\r\nme, but came into mine arms, and did snuggle there so sweet and happy\r\nand gladly, and with so true a delight, that it did be plain how she did\r\nlove in all her body and spirit to be anigh to me, as I to her. Yet,\r\ntruly, as you do mind, the armour did be upon me; so that I feared to\r\ntake her very strong in mine arms, lest I hurt the dear Maid; and surely\r\nthe armour did be a stern matter for her to nestle unto; but yet,\r\nmayhaps, did the sternness something please her womanheart, and yet,\r\nagain, mayhaps to lack.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, she made that she would go from me, and I loosed mine\r\narms from her very ready, because that I did heed alway that she have\r\nfull sweet liberty of her dear Maidenhood; and I to be watchful\r\nsufficient unto this end, yet always honest and wholesome and not\r\nover-pondering even in this my care; and this proper intending you\r\nshall ever perceive, if that your hearts do strive to hearken unto my\r\nheart, which doth speak alway before you.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid went from me, over to where she had put the cup of the\r\nwater, and the tablets; and I to make to rise, that I look that the\r\nboulder did be safe untouched in the mouth of the cave. But she called\r\nunto me that I lie backward; for that she did mean gently to spoil me\r\nthat once; and that I have no heed to the boulder or whether there did\r\nbe any Monster or Beast anigh in the Gorge; for that the boulder did be\r\nsafe as I did balance it; and nowheres any Creature to sight in the\r\nGorge; for she had lookt oft, since waking, to this end.\r\n\r\nAnd truly I obeyed, and lay back, and did like that I should be spoilt,\r\nas we do say. And Naani brought the cup of the water, and the tablets\r\nover to me; for she gat them from the scrip before I had it to my\r\npillow, in that while when I had gone downward for the boulder. And\r\nsurely, even when she brought the cup, she would not have me to rise;\r\nbut took my head upon her knees, and kist me once very dainty on the\r\nlips, and I very happy to be so loved, and wishful no otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd she took a tablet and kist it and gave it to me; and afterward\r\ntouched another to my lips, and had that to be for her own. And so we\r\neat and were very glad and happy, someways as children are happy, and\r\nour hearts all at ease.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, we eat each our second tablet, in the same wise as the\r\nfirst. And truly I did be kist more than once. And afterward, we drank\r\neach of the water.\r\n\r\nAnd when we had made an end, Naani told me that I move to stand; and\r\nsurely I wondered; and I stood up, and lo! I near cried out with the\r\npains of my bruisings; for I was all gone stiff in my sleep, and as that\r\nI did be more sore than ever; and this to be because I had fought again,\r\nas you do know, and surely had been hurt more by the Four-Armed Man than\r\nI had known.\r\n\r\nAnd I perceived then that Naani had supposed that I should be thus\r\npained, and had given dear thought to the matter; and truly she had the\r\npot of the ointment, ready, if that I did be very bad, that she rub me.\r\n\r\nAnd she gave me aid with mine armour, and afterward eased me with my\r\ngarments; and surely I did be utter bruised in the body, by reason of\r\nthe violence of the Yellow Beast-Man. And the Maid had somewhat so\r\ntender and sweet in her eyes as she looked upon the bruisings, that I\r\ndid be very happy and to glow with contentment.\r\n\r\nAnd she had me to lie, and made me in comfort with the cloak, so loving\r\nand grave, so that I was as a child that doth be cared of by his mother.\r\nAnd she did rub me very skilful and gentle for a great hour, until I was\r\nall refreshed. And in verity she was a lovely wise maid.\r\n\r\nAnd as the Maid ministered unto me, I lay alway very restful, and\r\nharked to the low sound of the muttering of the fire-hole that did be in\r\nthe bottom of the Gorge; and alway I did feel as an happy child that\r\ndoth be clothed in love and guided in wisdom.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, when that the Maid had ended her dear care, she put by\r\nthe ointment, and gave me her hands very dainty, that she mean to aid me\r\nto rise; and surely when I was come again to my feet, I was all eased,\r\nand to have movement with no great pain; and truly this made me wondrous\r\npleased and to feel new couraged; for I had been troubled that I should\r\nbe so helpless, in that I did be the Protector of Mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had tried my limbs, and found them to be in command and\r\nready, I lookt about for my garments. And lo, the Maid brought me my\r\nspare body-vest, from the Pouch, and had it upon her arm, to give to me.\r\nBut surely she denied me a moment, of the vest, and stood before me, and\r\nhad an admiring and wonder, very sweet and honest, because that my arms\r\ndid be so great and hard with muscles.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, I did be very strong, as you have perceived; for I did be\r\nalway in affection of the Exercises that were taught in the Upbringing\r\nof all the Peoples of the Mighty Pyramid; and by this explaining, you\r\nshall understand that I was like to be strong; but indeed, I owed the\r\nstraightness and shaping of my body to the Mother that bore me. And\r\nafterward, in all my life, had I taken pride of my body to be of health\r\nand to have strength; and surely this is a matter very fit for pride;\r\nand to be told bravely and with honesty.\r\n\r\nAnd the admiring of the Maid was very sweet to me; and, in verity, I did\r\nbe to deceive, if that I said otherwise. And in a moment, she dropt my\r\nbody-vest, and put out her hands to me that I take her into mine arms.\r\n\r\nAnd I took the Maid into mine arms with a great gladness and with\r\nsomewhat of humbleness that I was nowise good enough to hold her, for my\r\nheart was young, and I loved her very dear and youthful. And she did lie\r\nthere very quiet and happy, a little; and surely I did find presently\r\nthat she kist the great muscling of my breast, very sweet and sly, where\r\nher face did be press against it. And lo, in a moment, she came free of\r\nmine arms, and gave me an aid with my garments, and afterward with mine\r\narmour.\r\n\r\nAnd when that this was done, she stood off from me; and she lookt at me,\r\nhalf shy and half of sweetness and naughtiness. And she came then in a\r\nmoment, and put her hands upward to my shoulders, and so stood her\r\neyelids something down over her eyes; and did steal a little look up,\r\nthis time and that. And lo! in a sudden moment, before I did wot, she\r\nwas to her knees before me, and did weep; and I down very swift to kneel\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nAnd I askt not why she wept; for I perceived that she did have joy and\r\nglad happiness and sweet trouble of her man; and that she did be a true\r\nwoman, and one part of the woman did worship, so that she did be\r\nstrangely humble and nigh to be shy; and another did love, and need that\r\nshe be anigh to me; and a third to have a calm wisdom. And all did now\r\nbe a-tremble, together in her heart; and I knew that I did be truly an\r\nhero to her, though but usual to all others. And my heart was wondrous\r\nproud and wondrous humble, so that I was in the same moment upraised and\r\nto feel dreadly unworthy. But I made no pretending to discredit myself\r\nto her, but only did resolve that I win alway her dear respect; and I\r\ndid be natural and truthful of my manner and without foolish denial of\r\nher sweet worship, for she was utter Mine Own, and it did be a pitiful\r\nthing if that I seem otherwise than an hero unto her.\r\n\r\nBut of you I ask kind understanding, and to call me not a thing of\r\nconceit because that I did understand; for truly I knew my faults, even\r\nso well as you, that do know all of my going. And you to look backward\r\nupon the love-days, and to mind how that your maid did ever to make you\r\ngreat in manhood with her dear belief and uplooking; and so shall you\r\nconceive of all my feelings; for we do be all so human in this matter,\r\nand to meet on a dear natural ground, as you will say.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, in a little time, Mine Own did be steadied, and wiped her\r\npretty eyes, and nestled to me a while, very husht and to need that she\r\nbe close. And I to have her gentle against mine armour, and to be in my\r\nheart as that I did be her father and her lover in the one man, and\r\nsurely to be silent and joyful that I lived.\r\n\r\nAnd presently I slipt her shoes from her little feet, with my right\r\nhand, the while that she did rest within my left arm; and I condemned\r\nmyself that I had thought not more swift to this end; but indeed I had\r\nthought upon it while that Naani rubbed me, and had intention thiswise;\r\nbut afterward forgat, as you shall understand, that have been with me\r\nalway. And truly Mine Own did be hurt that I say aught to my blame; and\r\nI to cease, but yet to feel reproached by my heart.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had lookt to the Maid\'s feet, I tied on her shoes again; and\r\nwe gat together our gear. And afterward we came down from the cave, with\r\na great care, because that it did be so high up in the cliff of the\r\nGorge.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, we made downward of the Gorge, and had a good care to our\r\ngoing, and so much of speed as we could make, that we come something off\r\nfrom the Dark Land of the Lesser Redoubt, so quick as we might.\r\n\r\nAnd in six hours we had gone very well, and we stopt then that we eat\r\nand drink; and afterward, I lookt again to the feet of the Maid. And I\r\nbathed them in a great rock basin of warm water that did be anigh to the\r\nplace of our eating; and afterward I put the ointment about them very\r\nthorough and gentle and for a good while; and so she had some ease and\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, we made onward again; but now we did go pretty easy; for\r\nI had considered the notings of mine outward journey, and so did\r\nperceive that we should be but six or seven hours off that part of the\r\nGorge, where did be the Slugs.\r\n\r\nAnd I was minded that we rest and sleep, ere that we make through that\r\ndire and dreadful place; for that we should be twelve great hours, and\r\nmore, to go through, and to have no rest or pause, until that we did be\r\nsafe outward again, as you shall think. And so did we need to be strong\r\nand well rested, and this to be wise also for the feet of the Maid.\r\n\r\nNow surely the Maid did be in delight of the fires of that part of the\r\nGorge where we were come, and she had beside a rest of the soul, in that\r\nshe had feeling that there did be no Evil Force to trouble us to our\r\ndestruction; and I bothered her not yet awhile with tellings of the\r\nhorrid place that we should to journey through in a while, as you do\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAnd so we did go, and alway with a good caution, lest that some Beast or\r\nCreature should come upon us; and alway with the fire-holes before and\r\nbehind, and in the air of the Gorge the little whistlings of steam that\r\ndid spirt out in this place and that; and a good warmth in many parts,\r\nby reason of the fires; and odd whiles a smelling of sulphur; but not\r\ngreatly, nor to our trouble. And alway the low muttering of the\r\nfire-holes and pits, and the red lights, and the dancing of the shadows\r\nwhen that we did go by a fire-pit where the fire did frisk and burn\r\nlively. And upon either side, the grim walls of the Gorge going up\r\nmeasureless into the night.\r\n\r\nAnd so we were gone presently, pretty comfortable, for six good hours,\r\nsince last that we eat; and we made halt, and eat and drank; and I\r\nshowed the Maid how that we should make a short journey that day, and\r\nsleep, and so be ready to the horrid journey through the dark part of\r\nthe Gorge, where the Slugs did be.\r\n\r\nAnd we made search then, that we have a safe place to our slumber; and\r\nsurely I perceived where we did be; for we came upon that same cave\r\nwhere I did sleep after that I was come free of the Slugs; and that we\r\nwere come no farther, doth show how easy did be our present going, and\r\nthis you do know. And there did be the spring where I washed, and the\r\nfire-hole anigh, and truly they were not like to be gone away, as you\r\nshall say! Yet did we exclaim, very natural; for the Maid did be so deep\r\nin interest of the matters of my coming, and to be at once that no other\r\nplace should serve for our rest and slumber.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, this was a natural thing, and the place so good as any,\r\nsave that I did wish it had been upward unto a high place of the Gorge,\r\nas you shall understand. But yet might we block the mouth-part of the\r\ncave with boulders, somewise as I did before, and so to have a defence\r\nagainst any thing that should make to enter upon our sleep; or at the\r\nleast to be waked by the falling of the boulders.\r\n\r\nNow Mine Own went inward of the little cave, which did be very light\r\nfrom the fire-pit that was to the front; but before that she did go, I\r\nmade a swift search of the place, that there should be no creeping\r\nthing; and truly it was sweet and free. And the Maid did be strangely\r\ntaken that she should come to the veritable place where once I did lie\r\non mine outward way; and truly I do understand, and so shall many that\r\ndo have these feelings about matters. And afterward, we went unto the\r\nhot spring that was in the hollow of the rock, anigh to the fire-pit.\r\nAnd I saw that there did be no snakes, neither any of the rat-things\r\nanigh; and so I had the Maid to sit very comfortable on the side of the\r\npool, and I freed her shoes, and bathed her feet, and afterward rubbed\r\nthem very steady with the ointment; and so for a good time, and alway to\r\nkeep a looking out upon the Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, when that I had taken a loving care of her pretty feet, I\r\ntied the shoes again upon the Maid, and so back to the cave; and the two\r\nof us to carry boulders, according to our strength. And when we had a\r\nsufficient, we builded a rough and clumsy wall, after that we were gone\r\ninto the cave; and the wall rose nigh to fill the mouth of the cave, and\r\nmade us to be somewise in darkness, but yet to feel in safety. And I had\r\na good heed to make the chinks of the wall very close in the bottom, so\r\nthat no small creeping thing should come through unto us whilst that we\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, Naani set the scrip and the pouch to be for my pillow;\r\nbut had the bundle of her torn garments to be for her own purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd I perceived that she had the water-powder and a pack of the tablets\r\nto her hand for our waking, that she might prepare our food, and mayhap\r\nto wake a little before me, so that she have all ready to greet me from\r\nmy sleep. But, indeed, I said naught to show that I knew; for I saw that\r\nthis thing did give her a dear pleasure, and truly it was very sweet to\r\nhave her to these gentle duties, that did be to her so sure and quiet a\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own bade me that I lie; and she put the Diskos upon the outward\r\nside of me, to mine hand; and with a dainty and fearful touch; for the\r\nweapon did be very dreadful unto her thoughts; but yet a comforting\r\nthing to abide for our defence. And afterward, she covered me with the\r\ncloak, and kist me very sedate upon the lips; and then to her own side,\r\nand to come very nice and happy under the cloak, and so to her rest.\r\n\r\nAnd presently she did sleep, as I perceived by her breathings; and\r\nsurely it did seem to my spirit that she had an utter and dear content\r\nin this arranging of our slumber, so that she did be all at peace in all\r\nher being, because that she did be nigh unto me, that did be her Own\r\nLove.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, I could not sleep for a time; and surely, in a while, Mine\r\nOwn did nestle unto me in her sleep, so sweet and dear as a child, and\r\nlikewise as that it did be her right to be so anigh unto me; and I to be\r\nthat I should put mine arms about her, but indeed I moved not, neither\r\ndid I kiss her, as I did wish; for truly I should be very manly with\r\nmine own maid that did be so trustful and utter mine in her sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd presently I was over unto slumber also, and stirred not for eight\r\ngood hours, and did wake then to the hissing of the water, so that I\r\nknew Mine Own was awake before me, as she had planned, and was making\r\nready that we eat.\r\n\r\nAnd when she saw me move in the half-light, she gave out a little word\r\nof joy, that I did be again to knowledge of her; and she came over, and\r\nput her arms about my neck, and kist me very loving, thrice upon the\r\nlips. And, in verity, it came to me in that moment that I had been kist\r\na while gone in my dreams, but scarce to know it; yet I perceived now\r\nthat Mine Own had taken a naughty advantaging of my slumber, that she\r\nkiss me to her own pleasure; yet did the Maid say no word of her\r\nnaughtiness; and I to be likewise; but to resolve that I waken, mayhaps,\r\non the next time, and so catch her in her sweet and secret delight of\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, this doth sound quaint; but to be true.\r\n\r\nAnd I rose, and took down the half of the wall that did be across the\r\nmouth of the cave, and afterward lookt out; but there was no sight of\r\nany horrid thing in the Gorge, save that one of the rat-things did\r\nslumber, very gorged-seeming, upon the side of the little fire hole.\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards, we eat and drank; and the Maid then to rub me, as\r\nbefore; for I was greatly stiff on my waking, as you shall think; but\r\nshe came not into mine arms presently, as I did hope; but only kist my\r\nshoulders, when that she had finished, and so bid me to dress.\r\n\r\nYet, after that I was drest, and had mine armour full upon me, she must\r\ncome unto me, and she slipt her two small hands into the one of mine,\r\nand so stood by me, very silent. And sudden she put up her lips very\r\nquiet and passionate, that I should kiss her; and she kist me once, as\r\nit did be as that her spirit kist mine, and all her being came unto me;\r\nand she gave me but that one kiss, and afterward slipt her hands very\r\ngentle from mine, and made to the gathering of our gear.\r\n\r\nBut truly, I that loved her so great, knew that a tumult of love did be\r\nhid in her heart. And, indeed, she looked once at me in such wise, that\r\nI grew near to a true humbleness of heart because of the honour and love\r\nthat did be in her eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, it is a very little thing to die for such an One as Mine Own\r\ndid be. And by this saying, shall you perceive my heart in that moment,\r\nand that I did pant, as it were, that I do some deed of love to show my\r\nlove. And truly this is but a natural desiring and human, and the cause\r\nproper to the uplifting of manhood. And surely you shall all mind you of\r\nsuch feelings in the past love-days, that I do pray should be never\r\npast.\r\n\r\nAnd when we had our gear together, I left it in the cave, and took Mine\r\nOwn over unto the hot pool that was anigh to the fire-pit; and she to\r\nexclaim upon the rat-thing that did be yet a-slumber upon the side of\r\nthe fire-pit; and I to say that the thing did be no cause for fear, but\r\nrather, indeed, a good friend, in that it was a devourer of snakes, as\r\nyou shall mind.\r\n\r\nAnd while that we talked, I bathed the little feet of Naani; and surely,\r\nas I dried them upon my pocket-cloth, I was taken that I should kiss\r\nthem; and surely I kist them, and they did be very shapely and dainty,\r\nand all eased of travel by the care that I did take to this end.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward I rubbed them with the ointment for a good while, and so\r\nhad them again into the shoes, and the Maid very quiet, after that I had\r\nkist her feet that did be so dainty, but yet with a sweet naughtiness in\r\nher way, as my heart perceived, though she did nothing, neither said\r\nanything, to this end; and was truly very obedient, and orderly to all\r\nmy wishes.\r\n\r\nAnd we went back then to the cave, and the Maid put the pot of the\r\nointment back into the pouch, and she buckled the pouch and the scrip\r\nupon me; and the Diskos I had upon my hip; for I went nowise anywhere,\r\nwithout it, as you shall suppose. And she had the little bundle of her\r\nclothing for her burden, and truly, I was ready that she should carry so\r\nmuch; for we did be to act wisely, and she well able to carry so small a\r\nthing, and I better to have my hands alway free to the Diskos and to the\r\nneeds of the way.\r\n\r\nAnd we went downward of the Gorge at a strong speed, for there did be\r\nsomewise of fifteen hours good journey, ere that we come out upon the\r\nfar side of that place where the Monsters did be, and this did be three\r\nhours to the upward beginning of that place, and twelve hours journey\r\nthen, in the least, that we should take to go through again into the\r\nlight of the Gorge below. And this I did reckon from my notings of mine\r\nupward journey, as you do know.\r\n\r\nAnd I made all clear to the Maid, of the thing that did be before us,\r\nand made not to hide the danger and horror, but yet to make not overmuch\r\nof the same. And she to walk close beside me, very sweet and trustful,\r\nand to say that she feared naught, so that I should be there to have\r\ncare of her; but only that she did fear harm for me; and yet to have\r\nconfidence that I should slay all hurtful things that should be like to\r\ntrouble us. And, truly, I did kiss her for her dear belief and love.\r\n\r\nNow, in the middle part of the third hour, the air of the Gorge did\r\nbegin that it was heavy, and to have a seeming of fumes that stang\r\nsomething upon the throat, odd whiles. And there were presently less of\r\nthe fire-holes, and soon, as we did go the more downward, the beginnings\r\nof a great gloom, and to have smoke therein that made us to feel husky.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end of the fourth hour, we were come truly far downward\r\nwithin the gloom; and to be as that we groped in a fog of distaste; and\r\nto know not how we went with any surety; for oft there did be an utter\r\ndarkness about us; and awhile the shine of a dull-glowing fire-pit upon\r\nour sight, that did show us the gloom and dread of that place.\r\n\r\nAnd we went alway very husht, and the Maid to my back; but I did halt\r\nnow and this time, and make to know how she did be; and surely she\r\nwhispered very brave to me through the dimness, and once did slip her\r\nhand into mine, and I to take off mine armoured glove for a little\r\nmoment, that I hold her hand, and give her nice assurance. But, in\r\nverity, there was terror in mine heart, that did be a terror far beyond\r\nthe trouble of mine upward way; and surely I was shaken newly with every\r\ndanger, lest that I should lose Mine Own, or she to come to any hurt.\r\nAnd, indeed, you shall perceive how I did be; for so should you be in a\r\nlike case, and, in truth, it doth be an utter anxiousness and suffering.\r\n\r\nNow when we had been two hours in the dark part of the Gorge, I smelled\r\nof the dread and horrid stink that you do wot of. And surely a great\r\nfear came upon me; for I perceived that we did come among the Monsters,\r\nor that one came anigh to us.\r\n\r\nAnd I whispered unto the Maid that she halt; and we stood very husht a\r\nwhile, and surely the stink did grow, and to be very dreadful in the\r\nnostrils, so that I felt Mine Own Maid to shake somewhat with the fear\r\nand disgust that this thing did make in us. And presently the stinking\r\ndid ease somewhat from about us; but whether there had gone past us a\r\nmonster Slug, I have no sure knowing; for there did be no fire-pit anigh\r\nto that place; so that there was a great darkness all about.\r\n\r\nAnd surely there was a great slowness and wetness of the air, and dismal\r\ndrippings that made desolation in the silence; and the feel of strange\r\ngrowths upon the boulders, as you do know, and oft an horrid slime and\r\ndankness; and the stink to be everywhere, so that we knew a constant\r\ndisgust and fear. And alway the fumings of sulphur, that did seem, in\r\nverity, to beat down upon us, utter heavy and sore upon our lungs.\r\n\r\nAnd so went we onward amid the smell that did be as of dead things; and\r\noft did we make pause and hark, and had a great care as we did go by the\r\ndull fire-holes and fire-pits, that we should make no showing of\r\nourselves in the light.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden, as we did go by a great pit that burned very deep and red, I\r\nreached back and caught Mine Own by the arm, and I set her gaze unto\r\nthe right side of the Gorge, which was beyond the fire. And the Maid\r\nwent very still, as she did see the thing that was there; for in verity\r\nit was utter monstrous, and did shine very wet-looking in the light of\r\nthe fire. And truly it moved a little with the head, this way and that,\r\nstretching through the dark and the shadows, as you shall see a slug to\r\nmove, and with no speed or sound, and nowise seeming heedful of aught.\r\nBut yet did I fear that it smelled us, if this might be; and this, as\r\nyou shall think, to be a very natural fear.\r\n\r\nAnd alway, as I do mind, it seemed to go blindly somewise, or to have\r\nthat slow and strange moving that doth make one to think of a blindness;\r\nbut whether it did be truly blind, how shall I say; only that it was an\r\nutter Monstrous Brute, so great as the black hull of a ship, and very\r\ndreadful unto our hearts.\r\n\r\nAnd we moved not for a while, save that I pulled Mine Own down into the\r\nhiding of the boulders of that part; and she to put her hand very\r\nanxious unto me; yet not to be comforted, as I did half to think, but to\r\npersuade me, lest that I go to some adventuring that should set me in a\r\nsurer danger. And this I perceived in a little moment, and loved her for\r\nher care.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, I had no mind to aught, save that we come clear of that\r\nplace; and I watched the Monster, through places between the boulders;\r\nand surely, in a little while, it swayed the great head very slow and\r\nquiet unto the cliff that did make that side of the Gorge; and the Brute\r\nset unto the Cliff, and began that it went upward with a strange moving\r\nof muscles that did go wavewise under the wet and horrid-gleaming hide.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in a little time, it was gone quiet against the cliff, and the\r\nhead-part did be upward in the darkness above, so that it did be from\r\nour sight. But the monster body did be plain for a great way, and was\r\nseeming clung to the cliff, and to come downward out of the dark, as\r\nthat it did be a great black ridge of soft and dreadful life upon the\r\nface of the cliff; and the tail was something less bulked, and to taper,\r\nand did trail outward into the Gorge upon the boulders.\r\n\r\nAnd surely the thing did seem as that it slept, but that odd whiles the\r\ntail did lift a little off the boulders, and curl somewise, and\r\nafterward come down again upon the boulders, mayhap in this place and\r\nmayhap in that place, as we did watch, all hid.\r\n\r\nAnd it was as that our sense and our Spirits did assure us that the\r\nthing had no wotting of us; but surely our fears did nigh to equal the\r\ncomfort of this sweet reason, and to make us think otherwise.\r\n\r\nYet, in a time, I made that we go forward together through the spaces\r\nthat did be among the boulders. And I went creeping, and the Maid to\r\nfollow likewise.\r\n\r\nAnd oft I did pause, and made a watching upon the monster; but truly it\r\nmoved not, save as I have told; and I kept a great heed upon the Maid,\r\nthat she follow alway close unto my feet.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end we came safe from that place where the monster did be\r\nclung unto the great cliff in the night.\r\n\r\nAnd we went then for two great hours without adventure, save that once\r\nthe Maid touched me that we pause; for that something went by us where\r\nwe did be in an utter dark place of the Gorge, and no fire-hole anigh.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew that the thing did be near, even as the Maid toucht me. And\r\ncaught I the Maid in the dark, and thrust her under the side of a\r\nboulder; and I crouched then before her, with mine armour, that I should\r\nprotect her from any Brutish thing. And the Diskos in my hand, and\r\nafterward an horrid time of waiting.\r\n\r\nAnd the stink of that part of the Gorge grew very dreadful, so that it\r\ndid be as that we should not breathe, with the horror of the stink. And\r\nthere went past us some horrid and utter Monster, that made neither\r\nsound nor anything, save that there seemed a strange noise that might be\r\nthe breathing of a great thing; but yet did be all uncertain, in that\r\nthe sides of the Gorge cast the sound this way and that, in an horrid\r\nwhispering of echoes; so that we did not know whether the sound be made\r\nnigh to us, or afar upward in the eternity of the night, where I did\r\nsuppose the mountains to be joined over the Gorge in a monstrous roof in\r\nthat part.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, the strange noisings died in the upward height, and all\r\nabout us; and the utter disgust of the stink went from us; so that we\r\nknew that the Monster had gone past us, and did make downward through\r\nthe dark Gorge; and mayhap then to some lone and dreadful cavern of the\r\nworld, as I did think.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, as I do mind, I had a sudden wonder at that time, and other\r\nwhiles, as it did chance, whether this way did be truly the olden way\r\nthat the Peoples of the Lesser Refuge did travel in the Olden Days. And\r\nsurely, as I did suppose, they had come some other way, or the Gorge to\r\nbe different and less dreadful in the far-off years. And this thing you\r\nshall agree with me to be a reasonable thinking.\r\n\r\nAnd after that the Monster had gone a good while we went onward again,\r\nand with a great caution; and dreading alway lest that we come upon that\r\nMonster, in the darkness; but yet did we know by smell, and by all our\r\nconsciousness, whether that we came nigh unto one of the monster Slugs.\r\n\r\nThen, in the end of the fifth hour in the dark part of the Gorge, we\r\ncame by the mouth of that great cavern, upon our left; and you to\r\nremember the same.\r\n\r\nAnd I made pause in the darkness, and had the Maid very gentle by the\r\narm, that she should look with me. And I whispered how that I past this\r\nplace, to my right, upon mine upward way, and how that I did think\r\nthere to be a-plenty of monster caverns within the mountains that made\r\nthe sides of the Gorge, and that, mayhap, the Slug-Creatures had there\r\nan home in such places, or came up, it might be, from some utter strange\r\ndeepness and mystery of the great world.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid did bide very close unto me, and silent, whilst that I\r\nwhispered; for the terror of the place did be on her, yet not to make\r\nher lacking of courage, but yet to put a monstrous awe upon her and a\r\ngreat and natural fear; and I likewise, as you do know.\r\n\r\nAnd we stayed there, where we did be, a little moment, and looked\r\ndownward into the bowels of the monster cavern; and the shine of the\r\nfire-hole beat over the cavern in the near part; but there did be an\r\nutter mystery and deathly dark beyond the shining of the pit that did be\r\nwithin, as you shall remember.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, as we stayed but to glance, I perceived that there lay\r\nhumped things about the fire, and some to be black-seeming, and some to\r\nhave a seeming of whiteness, but with no sureness in the colour to mine\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAnd there came a moving in one of the humpt things, so that it did be as\r\nthat an hill did wake unto an horrid life. And immediately I knew that\r\nthe humps did be some utter monsters, mayhaps even the great Slugs,\r\na-slumber about the fire-pit that did burn in that strange deeply\r\ncavern. And I saw that I did ill for our lives, that I should pause even\r\nfor a little moment to such staring.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately I whispered to Mine Own that we go with all our speed;\r\nfor, indeed, I knew not whether that our nearness had waked that\r\nMonster, or whether that it had but waked by chance. And truly, I was\r\nutter eager that we be gone from that place, so swift as we might.\r\n\r\nAnd we went on then through all of the sixth hour that we did be in the\r\nSlug part of the Gorge, as I named it unto myself. And in all that hour,\r\nthere did nothing harmful come anigh; only, as I did know presently,\r\nthere came an unease upon our spirits, but yet to be very little at that\r\ntime, and we to be scarce knowing of it. And alway, as we went, there\r\ndid be darkness for the most, and odd-whiles a vague murmuring of the\r\nnight far above, as it did seem; and presently the dull glare of a\r\nfire-pit to shine out far off below us in the Gorge, and to seem very\r\ndim and unreal unto us, by reason of the smokes and the fumes that made\r\na haze and a distaste in the Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, the murmuring of the night to grow somewhat, and,\r\nafterward, the sound of the muttering of the fire-pit to come unto us;\r\nand the murmuring to die unto our ears that did be hearing now only the\r\ndull muttering, and so we to know that the murmuring of the night did be\r\ntruly the far-off muttering of the fire-holes, and our eyes to guide our\r\nhearing, and our reason to explain and knit the sounds; and so we to\r\npass by the fire-hole with a great quiet and caution and ever with\r\nwatchfulness, as you shall suppose. And afterward again into the dark;\r\nand presently again the murmuring, to tell that we came unto another of\r\nthe fire-pits, that was yet afar off in the Gorge, and made dim echoes\r\nin the night.\r\n\r\nAnd alway we went very watchful, and in grim fear; but with\r\nsteadfastness and good intention to win forth out of that desolation and\r\nhorror, and having alway so great a speed as the darkness and the\r\ndangers and the trouble of the way did allow.\r\n\r\nAnd in this place I will make explanation why that I speak somewhiles of\r\nfire-pits and otherwhiles of fire-holes; for the holes did be those\r\nfires that burned nigh to the brim of the holes; but the pits were those\r\nplaces where the fire was deeply in the earth. And this thing I give for\r\nyour enlightenment, even on a small matter; so that you shall have a\r\nclear knowledge to abide with me all the way; and you to agree of this\r\nfor wisdom, and I to be pleased that you so agree.\r\n\r\nAnd here also, I should tell that there did not come a muttering from\r\nall of the fire-holes and the fire-pits; but mayhap from this one, and\r\nmayhap not from that one, according to the way of the fire therein. And\r\nthis shall be plain unto you.\r\n\r\nAnd so shall you see us go, and the smoke and the bitterness of the\r\nsulphur to be all about us; and oddwhiles the murmuring of a far-off\r\npit, and oft the utter silence; and to pass this time a lonesome\r\nfire-hole; and afterward the utter dark, or the half-gloom, all as might\r\nchance, according to the nearness of the fires. And upward in the\r\neverlasting night, the grim mountains to make a roof over us, as I did\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\nAnd all this while did the unease, of which I have told, make upon us;\r\nso that, presently, Mine Own whispered unto me the thing that already my\r\nspirit did half to perceive, that there came after us through the night\r\nsome harmful thing, that did be surely no great way off, as I did feel\r\nwithin me, and the Maid to have a likeways belief.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly I thought at once upon that Brute that did wake downward in\r\nthe mighty Cavern, where did be the great inward fire-hole, as I have\r\ntold; but whether this did be true knowledge that we did be chased in\r\nthe dark by that thing, or whether there came after us some other\r\nMonster, I could have no sureness; but only that we did be chased, and\r\nof this I had assuredness.\r\n\r\nAnd I set the Maid before me, that I have myself ready to the danger\r\nthat followed; and we made forward again then, so quick as we were\r\nabled; and she went very wisely; for she had good wit and had noted the\r\nways of my leading.\r\n\r\nAnd we went thus until the end of the seventh hour. And surely, in that\r\ntime, we heard the murmuring in the night which told of a fire-hole\r\nsomewise before us; and soon to have the red glare plain to our eyes,\r\nand the noise of the murmuring to die away into the nearer mutter of\r\nthe fire; and so presently to be anigh; and we to make forward with a\r\ngood speed, because that we feared utterly the thing that made quiet\r\nchase of us through the night.\r\n\r\nAnd oft I did look backward, and smelt the air, that I know whether it\r\ndid be a monster Slug-beast that chased us; but there did be no\r\nworseness of the smell, to tell me aught.\r\n\r\nAnd alway, I did be fretted in the heart, that we could make no greater\r\nspeed; but, indeed, as you shall perceive, our going did be but a slow\r\nthing in the dark places, and even thus we had many a sore tumbling and\r\nbruising.\r\n\r\nAnd by this, we were come almost unto the fire-hole; and immediately, I\r\nsaw that I knew the place, for there went upward beside the fire, a\r\ngreat jaggedness of rock, that I had seen upon mine upward way.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I caught the Maid in an instant, and bent her, and she quick\r\nto obey with her body. And we were both immediately hid downward among\r\nthe boulders. And this I did, because I minded how that there did be\r\nmany of the Monsters nigh to this same fire-hole, as I did go upon mine\r\nupward way.\r\n\r\nAnd we went forward then with an utter care; but yet to keep onward,\r\nbecause that there did be somewhat in chase of us. And, in verity, when\r\nthat we were come opposite unto the fire-hole, I saw that there did be\r\nseven of the monster Slugs against the far side of the Gorge, and did be\r\nall set upon their bellies against the cliff, and their horrid heads to\r\nbe hid in the upward dark, and their tails to lie very great and\r\nsoft-seeming in the bottom of the gorge, upon the boulders.\r\n\r\nAnd, lo! the Maid toucht me, and she drew me to look upon the near cliff\r\nof the Gorge. And truly there did be three of the Brutish Things laid\r\nupward there, and a fourth did be humped somewhat upon a great ledge\r\nthat did be upward of the Gorge, and just to be plain to our eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, it was as that we did be all surround by such Monsters, and\r\nto make the heart sink, and fear to lie upon our hopefulness. But,\r\nindeed, the Maid showed a good spirit, and I to have fierce determining\r\nthat we come free of that Gorge, and afterward, in time, unto our Mighty\r\nHome.\r\n\r\nAnd we made forward again, and did go creeping among the rocks and the\r\nboulders; and so came presently past that place, and had not waked the\r\nMonsters, if that indeed they did truly sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd I made halt a moment upon the far border of the light from the\r\nfire-hole, and I lookt backward up the Gorge, perchance that I should\r\nsee the thing that followed us. But, indeed, there came nothing out of\r\nthe dark of the upward Gorge, so that I knew that there did be some safe\r\nspace to our backs, which did be truly a comforting thing.\r\n\r\nAnd here I should tell how that there was no great stinking in that\r\nplace where did be so many of the Slug-beasts, and this to puzzle me;\r\nand in the end to make me think that some of those horrid things did\r\nstench more great than others; but yet I to have no certainty in this\r\nmatter, as you do perceive. And, truly, this thing troubled me; for I\r\nhad been comforted that my nose should tell me when that the thing that\r\nmade chase of us should draw nigh in the darkness; and now, in verity, I\r\nknew not what to have for assurance; for the awaredness of the spirit\r\nwas but a vague thing, and no more in such a matter, than a feeling as\r\nof an inward warning.\r\n\r\nAnd we went onward then for a great hour, and with an horrid unease upon\r\nus; and thrice we did go by fire-pits in the darkness; and alway I made\r\npause upon the far side of the light, that I should look backward; but\r\ndid have no sight of aught; yet did my spirit or my fears warn me with\r\nnew fear, and a greater sense of nearness; and the Maid to confess also\r\nto this thing.\r\n\r\nNow, we saw not any of the Slugs for a long while, neither had there\r\nbeen any about the three fire-holes; and the air of the Gorge was grown\r\nsomething sweet and free somewhat of the stench of dead-seeming things;\r\nbut yet to be very bitter with fumings and smoke and sulphur stinks.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in the middle of the tenth hour, as we did go, painful and with\r\nanxiousness in a very dark place of the Gorge, there came unto us again\r\nthe smell that told to us that one of the Monsters did be anigh. And\r\nsurely we had both a great fear, in that we had belief that it did be a\r\nsign that the thing that made chase, did draw near upon us. But yet did\r\nI to use my Reason also, and to know that the stink might be from some\r\nMonster that we were come nigh to in the darkness of that place; and I\r\nwhispered this unto the Maid, and she to say, very husht, that it might\r\nbe so; but to have no belief; and I to be likewise, as you do see.\r\n\r\nAnd we pusht forward at a new speed, and had many bitter falls, so that\r\nwe did be all bruised; but not to know it at that time, because that our\r\nfear did be so keen. And oft we made a little pause and harkt; but there\r\ndid be only the dismal drip of water from on high; and presently the\r\nmurmur of the night, that told that we drew near unto a new firepit.\r\n\r\nAnd surely this was a great easement to our spirits, in that we should\r\nhave light to perceive our danger, and mayhap to win free. But to be in\r\nthat utter dark, was a thing to break the courage, and to breed belief\r\nthat we did be utter helpless, and all wrapt in horror and despair.\r\n\r\nAnd the stink grew ever, as we made forward; so that I knew not whether\r\nthere did be great Monsters beside the fire-pit that was to our front,\r\nas I have told, or whether it made plain the advancing of the Pursuer.\r\nAnd we only to be able to make our best speed, and to be weary with hope\r\nthat we rush not blind into death; and alway to be chilled in the back\r\nwith the belief that the thing that made chase did be very close in that\r\nutter dark, and to gain upon us.\r\n\r\nAnd we knew not whether to make our belief to be the tellings of the\r\nspirit or the utterings of our fears; and so shall you perceive our\r\nplight; and we but to be able to make forward. And, in verity, the\r\ndreadfulness of that time doth shake me now to think upon, and you also,\r\nif that you have gotten my tellings to your hearts, so that your human\r\nsympathy doth be with me.\r\n\r\nAnd there came presently to our ears the far mutter of the fire-pit, so\r\nthat very soon the murmuring was lost to us in the night, and only the\r\nslow mutter to be plain. And the dull looming of the fire shone afar\r\noff, through the night and the smoke and fumings; and we to a great\r\nspeed, and to pant with fear; but yet with a freshness of hope again to\r\nsweeten us.\r\n\r\nAnd we came nigh to the fire-pit, and lo! the smell did be grown very\r\ndrear and foul; but there did be no Slug-Beast near the fire. And by\r\nthis, we perceived that we did be truly in an utter danger, in that the\r\nPursuer did be upon us, and the stinking to tell this to be truth, and\r\nour spirits to have warned us very strong and proper.\r\n\r\nAnd I stopt near to the fire-pit, which did be great, and very\r\nred-glowing; and I lookt upward of the Gorge, into the night of the\r\nGorge that we did come from; but the Monster was not yet upon us to work\r\nour death. And I lookt to the sides of the Gorge, and the Maid to have\r\nthe same thought that did be mine, that we climb the mountains that made\r\nthe sides of the Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt very keen first to this side, and then did run overward,\r\nthat I look more close upon the other; and afterward back again; for it\r\ndid seem that we should have a greater ease upon the side that we did\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nAnd I askt the Maid whether that she did be prepared; and she to be very\r\nwhite and wearied, and all besmirched with the dankness and growths upon\r\nthe boulders and the hidden pools of the Gorge and the dripping of the\r\nwaters; but yet did she be sound in her courage, and to show that she\r\nhad all belief and abiding in me, and her judgement likewise to be with\r\nmine, in that her own Reason did approve.\r\n\r\nAnd I took the bundle of her torn clothing from her, for it did be at\r\nher girdle, and like to trouble her movings; but she to refuse, very\r\ndetermined, in that I did be already over-burdened. And I to be firm in\r\nmy deciding, and to make her to yield the bundle, the which I hookt unto\r\nthe "hold" of the Diskos, where it did be to mine hip.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid to be there, a little figure, and white in the face, and\r\nstrangely angered, and her anger mixt with hidden acknowledgement that I\r\ndid be her master, and half to be minded that she move not from where\r\nshe did stand, and part to be reasonable and fearful of the hidden\r\nBeast; and in part also to thrill in her womanhood unto the man that did\r\nbe so masterful unto her. And all to pass in a little moment, and we to\r\nbe to the Gorge side, and busied very eager to the climb.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid to be first, as I did heed, and I to follow, and have\r\nconstant looking to the task and to her safety, and alway to be bitter\r\nanxious for our speed to be good, and to be anxious the more then, lest\r\nthat Mine Own should slip; for there did be an horrid wetness upon the\r\nsides of the Gorge, as you shall have guessed, and horrid growths that\r\nblotched the great rocks mightily, and made an utter slipperiness, if\r\nthat they did be trod upon; and we to have to come so clear of all such\r\nmatters, as we might, and yet to be speedy for our lives, and likewise\r\nto lack no care and thought to the setting of our hands and of our feet\r\nin places fitted to the lifting of our weight.\r\n\r\nAnd truly you shall see that we went very desperate, and I to give word\r\nto the Maid that she look not downward, the which I was urgent upon,\r\nlest that she come giddy in the heart. But I, as you shall think, could\r\nscarce to keep from fearful peerings below, so that I learn speedy\r\nwhether the Pursuer did come yet into the light of the fire-hole,\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, the Maid did gasp very weak and troubled with the\r\nsoreness of the climb; and I came higher, and set mine arm about her, as\r\nwe did be there upon the face of the cliff; and she stopt very still a\r\nlittle while, and an ease did come to her, and an assurance of safety.\r\nAnd surely, I kist her there where we did be in that upward place, and\r\nher lips did tremble unto mine; and her courage and strength to come\r\nback into her, so that in a minute she did make once more to the\r\nclimbing.\r\n\r\nAnd we came presently to a place where a great ledge did be, that jutted\r\nout from the mighty cliff, and was surely a huge way above the Gorge\r\nbottom. And the ledge sloped, and there were on the ledge, great stones\r\nand boulders that did make lodgement there through eternity.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt very careful to our way, and saw that we did be in the path\r\nof a mighty rock that was over-nigh unto the edge of the shelf-place,\r\nand did put fear upon me, in that it seemed that it should come down\r\nwith great thundering upon us, if that we but shook the place where it\r\ndid be.\r\n\r\nAnd I caught the Maid very swift and gentle, and shaped our path unto\r\none side of that great rock, and did presently lose my fear, when that\r\nwe did come safe from under it.\r\n\r\nAnd in a minute after, we were come upward upon the ledge, and a very\r\nsafe place it did seem, and surely as that no monster should be abled to\r\ncome upward upon us. And this I did try to make for comfort unto\r\nourselves; but that we both to know how that the great Slugs could lie\r\nup against the sides of the Gorge, and surely it did be like that they\r\nshould be able to come upward clear of the Gorge, and so to the place\r\nwhere we made to have safety. And I had no thought to deny this thing,\r\nwhen that it was clear to my brain; but set rather that we should have\r\nsome way to fight the Monster, if that we did be discovered.\r\n\r\nAnd I thought in a moment upon the stones that did be about; and the\r\nMaid in the same moment cried out that we should push the big rock down\r\nupon the Slug that we believed to have chase of us, and indeed, the rock\r\nto be a great weapon, if we could but stir it, as you shall think.\r\n\r\nAnd alway, as we talked, very hushed, we lookt downward into the\r\ndeepness of the Gorge, unto the upward end of the fire-light; but there\r\ncame no thing yet unto our knowledge, only that the stinking did rise up\r\nto us through that great distance.\r\n\r\nAnd the fire-pit to seem now a very small burning, and to give no great\r\nlight up to us; and we neither to be abled to see very clear of the\r\nGorge bottom, in that the haze of the fumes and the smoke was in the air\r\nof the Gorge, and made uncertainty; and we to be nowise proper free of\r\nthe smoke, even where we did be.\r\n\r\nAnd we watched, very set with anxiousness and fearful expecting of the\r\nmonster; and did be both yet lost of breath, and the Maid that she made\r\nher words something broken for a little while.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in a moment, Naani cried out very low and sharp that the thing\r\ndid come; and I to see a moving of somewhat, in the same instant, in the\r\nGorge that lay upon the upward side of the fire-pit.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately I saw the great and monster head of the Beast come\r\nforward into the shine from the pit; and the head did be of a blotched\r\nwhite, and to have the eyes upon great stalks that came from the forward\r\npart of the head; and the stalks to be set downward, so that the eyes\r\nlookt upon the bottom parts of the Gorge. And surely this doth be very\r\nhorrid-seeming to the mind of this age, but yet to have a less\r\nstrangeness unto the two of us that had seen many horrid sights, as you\r\ndo know.\r\n\r\nAnd as the Monster came forward the more into the light, I saw that the\r\ngreat and utter mighty bulk did be all of that same whiteness, that did\r\nbe so set over with blotchings and a seeming of unhealth. But, truly the\r\ncolour was proper to a creature that did abide in so great a darkness,\r\nas you shall say, yet had those Slugs that we did see, been black and\r\nshining, for the most, as I have told; and this to be as I saw, and I\r\nnot to heed here that I try unto explainings in this place; else should\r\nI be never eased of my task, as you do see.\r\n\r\nAnd the Monster Slug came onward, and as it did go, it set the stalks of\r\nthe eyes in among the boulders, as that it did search; swayed now this\r\nway and now that way, from side to side of the Gorge, and alway it\r\npushed the stalks of the eyes inward among the boulders; and so to go\r\nforward, searching. And truly it was very dreadful to see the thing make\r\nsearch for us, and to go so steadfast to so dread a purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, I saw it not so plain as might be, because of the haze of\r\nthe fumes and the smoke that did lie in the air of the Gorge, as I have\r\ntold, and made something vague the sight at this time and that; but yet\r\nwe did both see a strange thing; for when that the great white body did\r\nbe come half into the light, the Slug-Beast set out a big tongue among\r\nthe boulders, after that it did peer thereunder; and the tongue did be\r\nvery long, and white, and something thin-seeming; and the Monster lapped\r\ninward in a moment a great snake from among the boulders, and the tongue\r\ndid hold upon the snake, as that there did be surely teeth or roughness\r\nupon the tongue; but yet the distance to be too great for any surety of\r\nthe sight, as you do know; and moreover, there did be the uncertainty of\r\nthe haze within the air.\r\n\r\nAnd the Slug took the snake inward, all as it did lash and wriggle, and\r\nswallowed it in a moment; and, in verity, that snake did be a big and\r\nhorrid creature, else had it been not so plain to our sight; but it did\r\nbe as a worm unto the monster, and gone instant.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately, the Slug-Beast went again to searching, and the head to\r\nsway from this side unto that side of the Gorge; and by the wideness and\r\nease of this swaying shall you perceive the utter greatness of the\r\nBeast.\r\n\r\nAnd alway, as it did come downward of the Gorge, it thrust the stalks of\r\nthe eyes inward among the boulders, looking all ways; and oft the breath\r\ndid come from it, as a cloud; and the stink to rise up unto us, very\r\nplain and an abomination. And again, we saw the Beast set the tongue in\r\namong the boulders of the Gorge bottom; and it lickt forth a snake that\r\ndid seem so thick as a man in the body, and the snake to thrash in the\r\ngreat white tongue, and to be immediately drawn inward, and gone utter.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, as the thought did stir in me, there did be a great Mercy\r\nover us, in that we did not die by such a serpent in some dark and\r\nhorrid place of the Gorge. But yet, as it is like to be, mayhap the\r\nsnakes did be only anigh to the fire-holes; yet doth it be anywise a\r\nwondrous thing that we had come so free of them alway; and truly to\r\nlearn, was to be given a new terror.\r\n\r\nNow the Monster was come fully into the shining of the fire-pit, and was\r\nupon this side; and the fire to make a shining against the side of the\r\nSlug, so that odd whiles I did perceive very plain the huge wrinklings\r\nand musclings of the skin, as the Beast made onward. And alway it did\r\nsearch, thrusting in the eye-stalks among the boulders.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden, it made pause, and did begin that it brought all the mighty\r\nbody together, and humpt itself, and brought the head-part round unto\r\nthe bottom of the cliff that made this side of the Gorge. And it\r\ngathered itself, and afterward did lengthen upward against the cliff,\r\nand begin to climb. And lo! I saw that the Beast did scent of us, and\r\nmade to come upward to destroy us.\r\n\r\nAnd as the mighty hill of the body did come into length against the\r\ngreat cliff-side, the Beast set the eye-stalks into this cave and that,\r\nas it did go, and into all crannies; and so lengthened upward very\r\nstraight and monstrous and dreadful unto us, and did be as a white and\r\nmildewed hill, that had an horrid life. And the stink to come up, so\r\nthat we did be like to lose our breath with the dreadfulness of it, as\r\nyou shall think.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, for a moment, I looked unto the rocks upon the ledge, and\r\nthis way and that way, and upward unto the everlasting darkness that did\r\nbe above us, and again unto the great rock that did seem to quiver upon\r\nthe edge, as I have told. And I was grown utter desperate in a moment;\r\nfor, truly, it did seem in that instant that there did be no power in\r\nthe world that should slay so utter mighty a Monster.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately, even as I did despair, I had run very swift unto the\r\ngreat rock, and the Maid with me, both very strained and shaken with the\r\nhorror of the thing that did make upward unto us so sure and intent.\r\n\r\nAnd I set my strength unto the rock, and heaved; but indeed the rock\r\ngave not from the place where it did be; so that I had a dreadful\r\ndespair; for I saw that it did be more secure than had seemed. And the\r\nMaid lent her strength unto mine, and we heaved together, with sore\r\npantings, and little cries to guide our endeavours and because we could\r\nnot be contained in that moment.\r\n\r\nAnd surely it seemed that the great rock moved, and lo! as we strove\r\ntogether to the task, there came a vast and sudden grinding, and the\r\nrock to cease from our shoulders, and to be gone from us, or scarce we\r\ndid wot of the happening. And the rock went over, and rushed downward\r\nupon the Monster, and with mighty crashings, as it did grind and crush\r\nthe face of the cliff-side with a quick and constant thundering. And I\r\ncaught the Maid, as she did stagger upon that dire upward edge because\r\nthat she had set her strength so utter to the endeavour, and the rock to\r\nbe gone so sudden, as you do see, and she to be like to follow after.\r\nAnd she clung unto me, and I to hold her very safe as I lookt down upon\r\nthe falling of the Rock. And behold! the Great Rock smote the Monster in\r\nthe humpt part of the back, below of the head, and did enter into the\r\nMonster, even as a bullet doth strike, and was gone instant from my\r\nsight into the Vitals.\r\n\r\nAnd there came a mighty sound of anguish from the Monster; and the\r\nMonster did loosen from the cliff, and to crumple, as it did seem, and\r\nsink backward. And a great steam of dread breathing to go upward from\r\nthe Beast, and a reek; and it made again the strange and horrid noise of\r\npain, and the Gorge to be yet full of the echoes of the Rock thundering,\r\nand with the noise of the rock there was now mingled the horrid sounding\r\nof the death-crying of the Beast. And the Gorge to be filled with dull\r\nand dreadful echoings, as that an hundred Monsters died in this place\r\nand that of the darkness in the Gorge, and all to be bred of the noise\r\nof that mildewed hill a-dying.\r\n\r\nAnd the echoes ceased not for a while, even after that the Monster did\r\nbe utter quiet; for truly they came presently from far upward and\r\ndownward of the Gorge, out of all the eternity of the night, and to be\r\nas that they came backward very faint out of lonesome miles, and out of\r\nthe strange deepness of unknown caverns of the world. And so in the end\r\nto silence; and the far bottom of the Gorge to be filled with a white\r\nand horrid hill, very dreadful, and that did yet quiver to show the\r\nslowness of Death. And alway a dreadful reek and stinking to fill all\r\nthe air, even unto the height, as of the grave.\r\n\r\nAnd I stood upward in that far, high place, and held the Maid very\r\nstrong and tender; and she to have covered her ears from that dreadful\r\ncrying; and to be yet shaken with the greatness and horror of the dying\r\nof the Monster, and the nearness that she did come unto falling, as you\r\nhave seen.\r\n\r\nAnd presently she came less to tremble, and did weep very easeful, even\r\nas a babe doth weep; and I, mayhap, to be not over-steady, as you shall\r\nthink; but yet to have a great gladness set in my heart, and a triumph,\r\nand an utter grace of thankfulness.\r\n\r\nAnd I held Mine Own, very tender and sure, as I did say; and she very\r\nsoon to be eased of her trouble, and the shock to be something gone from\r\nher. And she lookt up at me, and slipt her arms upward about my neck,\r\nand pulled me downward unto her, that she might kiss me.\r\n\r\nAnd we to talk then, of the going down; and surely this did seem a great\r\nand dangerous task; for, truly, we had come upward pretty easy in the\r\nexcess of our fear; but how we might go down, with our blood cool, I did\r\nbe all in doubt.\r\n\r\nYet, before that we did aught else, I led the Maid upward on to the safe\r\npart of the ledge; and we sat there, very quiet and weary, and she did\r\nbe leaned against me. And we eat, each of us, two of the tablets, and I\r\nto scold and coax Mine Own to this end, and she to obey and to be better\r\nafterward, because that she had eat. And we drank some of the water, and\r\ndid rest a time longer.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, our courage and strength was come back into us; and we\r\npackt the scrip again, and the Maid set it fast to my back; and we went\r\nthen to the edge of the shelf, and lookt downward, this way and that;\r\nand surely, there did be no way to go, save the way we came; only that\r\nwe might shape our downward climbing to bring us a little below that\r\nplace where the dead Monster did be.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw by mine own heart and by the paleness of the Maid, that we\r\nshould do well that we consider the thing no more; but make to the task.\r\n\r\nAnd I went immediately over the edge of the shelf, upon my belly, and I\r\nbade Naani to follow. And we began then that we go downward; and, in\r\nverity, we went downward for, mayhap, a great hour; and I gave help\r\nalway unto Mine Own, as I could; and she to come after me very brave,\r\nand made that she hold back her fear, and come downward of that cliff,\r\nthat did be oft like to a mighty wall. And surely, even as we came down,\r\nI marvelled how we did ever go upward, even though fear did aid us; but,\r\nindeed, I do think it doth be easier to climb safely, than to come\r\nbackward; for this is how I have found.\r\n\r\nAnd we made rest thrice upon ledges of the cliff. And afterward came\r\ndownward again; and alway very slow and with exceeding heed where our\r\nhands and our feet did go, that we slip not suddenly to our death.\r\n\r\nAnd once, as I did see, the Maid was lost of all her strength, and did\r\nbe going to fall, because that she did be all gone into a sudden\r\nweakness of the head in an instant. And she did be silent, even in that\r\nmoment, the which doth be marvellous unto me, and to give me a strong\r\npride of her, as you shall understand, if that ever you have loved. And\r\nsurely, I came upward, in a moment, that little space that was between,\r\nand had mine arm about Mine Own very swift, and held her hard and fierce\r\nagainst the cliff; and this I did that she should feel how that she\r\ncould never fall; and immediately, her strength and her dear courage\r\ncame back into her; and I kist her, there against the mighty cliff; and\r\nafterward she did have power again to come downward safe.\r\n\r\nAnd presently we were come to the Gorge bottom, and maybe an hundred\r\npaces down the Gorge from that place where did be the dead Monster, all\r\nsunk into an ugly and horrid heap, so great as a small hill.\r\n\r\nAnd a dreadful stinking did hang in all that part of the Gorge, by\r\nreason of the Slug; and signs of disgust, as you shall think; and the\r\ngreat and mildewed body of the thing yet to settle and twitch, as I did\r\nlook, as it did come properly unto death in all that mighty bulk. And\r\neverywhere, the skin of the Beast did be set into great wrinklings, and\r\nhorrid blotchings to be upon the improper whiteness thereof; and truly I\r\ndid be in haste that I turn the Maid away from that thing, and that we\r\nhaste downward of the Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd we went then for two good hours, and alway I did hearten the Maid,\r\nand she to go very husht and trustful by me; but truly I did be in an\r\nanguish of heart, because that I was newly aware that there did be such\r\ngreat and dreadful serpents in that part of the Gorge, as you do also\r\nknow. And I was not over-feared for myself, but for the Maid that did\r\nhave no armour to protect her dear body. And because that I was so set\r\nwith this trouble, I took the Maid presently into mine arms, that I\r\ncarry her, and so to have her clear of aught that should lie among the\r\nboulders.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, Mine Own did show an anger very surprising and\r\ndetermined; for I said not why I should carry her--fearing to give her a\r\ngreater unease--but only that she did be weary, and I very strong and\r\nwilling.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, I could not bring her to reason, without I told her, which\r\nwas not mine intent; for she did refuse me to carry her; and said that\r\ntruly I had need of no added burden unto my labours.\r\n\r\nAnd when she saw that I would not be moved by her reasonings, she made\r\nto win upon me by her loving ways; but, indeed, I only kist her; and\r\nwent forward with her in mine arms. And she half naughty, that I did be\r\nso heedless of her wishings, and somewise hurt also; and so to be silent\r\nin mine arms; yet mayhap to be something stirred in her nature, that I\r\ndid be steadfast to mine intention, despite that her will did be\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nAnd this I do believe to be truth, because that, afterward, I do think\r\nthat she lay there in mine arms, only as a woman that doth be in the\r\nhands of her Master that hath all her love.\r\n\r\nAnd in thiswise we went forward.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end of the two hours that we did go, there was come the end\r\nof the dark part of the Gorge; and we to be outward of that mighty roof\r\nof the mountains, as I do think it to have been; and the air to be free\r\nof the stink of the Monsters, and the fire-holes to be very plenty, and\r\ntheir smokings to go upward very proper; so that we had no more the\r\nbitterness of their fumings in our throats.\r\n\r\nAnd there did be a pretty good light, to go by the contrast of the past\r\nhours; and I set Mine Own again to her feet, and made that she keep to\r\nmy rearward, so that if there did be any serpents to our path, they\r\nshould come first under my feet, and thiswise to work no harm to me,\r\nbecause of mine armour, neither to Naani, Mine Own Maid.\r\n\r\nNow by this time, it was somewhat of nineteen great hours since we did\r\nsleep; for we had been a long while making that we come safe from the\r\nSlug; and, indeed, we had come downward with a less speed than I did go\r\nthrough upon mine upward way, as you shall mind; and this to be that\r\nMine Own did not have the hard strength that was in my body to the\r\nenduring of great labour and stress; and this surely all to be plain\r\nunto you that have been with me in all my journey. And, moreover, there\r\nmust be kept to mind the three hours that we had gone, ere we were come\r\nproper into the dark part of the Gorge; and so all to be remembered unto\r\nyou; and also you to mind that we did be wakeful a time, ere that we set\r\nforward upon that day\'s journeying.\r\n\r\nAnd we did go almost in joyous-wise, because that we were come safe out\r\nof that dreadful place; and surely, odd whiles I did feel the hands of\r\nMine Own Naughty One to be hookt very pretty and sly into the backward\r\npart of my belt, as that she did make a pretending that she drive me\r\nbefore her; and surely this doth be a strange thing to tell upon; for\r\nthere did be no knowledge of the olden horse in all the eternity of that\r\ndark world; but yet, maybe, some dear olden memory-dream did set her\r\nhands unconscious to this pretty work.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, once I turned very sudden, and had her swift into mine\r\narms, as she did pretend to drive me; and she to laugh with a sweet and\r\njoyous gurgle against mine armour; and I to heed that I hurt her not,\r\nbecause I did be like an iron man that should put arms about a tender\r\nmaid.\r\n\r\nAnd we lookt alway now for a place that should be proper to our rest and\r\nto our sleep; and when it did be close upon the end of the twentieth\r\nhour of that journey, the Maid showed me a cave that was, mayhap, fifty\r\ngood feet upward in the right side of the Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt about, and saw that there did be two fire-holes anigh, and a\r\nwarm spring to make a basin of water, that did lie between the fires;\r\nand all very well set to our need, as I did perceive; for, indeed, we\r\ndid be utter besmirched with the filth of the Slug part of the Gorge,\r\nand to need that we be nice and fitly washed, before that we have any\r\ncomfort of our selves.\r\n\r\nAnd I bade Naani to wait a little minute; and I lookt well up the Gorge\r\nand well down the Gorge; and lo! there did be no thing to set me in\r\nunease; and I told Mine Own that she keep a sharp and steadfast\r\nwatching, and not to heed me; and this I said, because I knew she did be\r\nlike otherwise to look at me and be over-anxious, as I go upward to the\r\ncave; and, indeed, she to be better anyway in watch of the Gorge, and to\r\ncry out to me, if that anything came anigh, whilst that I went upward.\r\n\r\nAnd I made upward to the cave; and was come there pretty quick; and\r\ntruly it did be good for our purpose, and fresh-seeming and dry, and to\r\nhave no holes that I could see for the hiding of creeping things.\r\n\r\nAnd I called down gently to the Maid that the cave did be proper; and\r\nshe to show her gladness, and to be looking upward at me, instead of the\r\nway of the Gorge, as I set her; and truly she did be a dear and human\r\nlittle Maid, and utter Mine; so that I did find a new joy in each small\r\nlack of wisdom, and this just so much as that she had done a wondrous\r\nproper thing. And truly, you shall say, there was some properness to her\r\nheart, in that she could abide not but to watch me.\r\n\r\nAnd I went quickly down to Mine Own; for there was alway an unease upon\r\nme, save when I did be nigh to her, in chance of trouble.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was come down to her, the Maid did be seeming a little in\r\nthought; and afterward showed me how that she did be all in a pitiful\r\ndisgust of the dirt and slime and the drippings of the Gorge, that did\r\nbe on her, and had made her garment utter wet and bemired, so that she\r\ndid feel that her very body was a repulse unto her.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw how it did be with Naani; and I went to the warm pool, and\r\nfelt that it did be not over-hot, and afterward found the deepness, by\r\nthe handle of the Diskos, and this to be scarce of three feet, and the\r\nwater very clear to show me the bottom, so that it was surely a nice\r\nand proper place to be for such a purpose as I did think. And I set some\r\nof the water to my mouth, using my hand; and truly there did seem no\r\nhurtful chemical in the water; and therefore was I eased that the Maid\r\nshould have the desire that I did see to be in her mind.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw that I should be helpful to Mine Own, if that I make the\r\narranging of things to be in mine own hands. And I went back unto the\r\nMaid, and told her that the pool was very nice to be for a bath-place;\r\nand that she to haste to wash herself, whilst the Gorge did be free of\r\nany Creature or Monster.\r\n\r\nNow I saw that Naani was troubled, and feared that I did be going to\r\nleave her, and yet did be paused a little in her words, to show me all\r\nthat she did wish.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I stoopt and kist her, as she did look so wistful in her\r\nlittle puzzlement; and immediately I removed her trouble very natural,\r\nand told that I should stand guard anigh to her, the while that she\r\nbathed. And, truly she did be at ease on the moment, and mayhap\r\nsomething surprised to know wherefore she had been something a-lack to\r\nask me. But, in truth, it did be very natural.\r\n\r\nAnd I told her to be so quick as she might, which was a needless thing\r\nto say, yet to start her; and she to go quietly to obey me; but first to\r\ntake the cloak out of the hold upon my shoulders, and to unfold it, and\r\nso to the pool. And I to stand with my back thatwards, and to lean,\r\nready, upon the Diskos.\r\n\r\nAnd presently she did be in the water, as I knew; and I to be her man,\r\nvery sure and gentle to her and sedate. And truly, as you shall think, I\r\ndid love that I be to stand guard to her in her dear maidenhood; and\r\nshe, after that she was cheered and warmed by the delight of the water,\r\nto sing very low and happy to herself, where she did be to my back.\r\n\r\nAnd, sudden, the singing to cease, and the Maid screamed; and I to have\r\nno thought of improper modesty but turned instant to the Maid. And in a\r\nmoment, I saw what did trouble her; for there came a serpent out of the\r\nwater; and the Maid to be all adrift with natural modesty, and with her\r\nfear of the serpent. And I was come into the pool in a moment, in mine\r\narmour, and did lift the Maid, naked and wet into mine arms, and had her\r\ninstant from the water, and upon the side of the pool; and there I wrapt\r\nthe cloak about her; and ran very quick and killed the serpent, as it\r\ndid go offwards among the boulders. And surely it did be so thick as\r\nmine arm, and to have come from some hole that did be hid in the bottom\r\nof the pool.\r\n\r\nAnd I came back then to Mine Own, and took her into mine arms, and set\r\nthe cloak well about her; and she to cry and to tremble with the shock\r\nand disturbance of the thing; but soon to be eased, and ready to laugh\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nAnd so she was come proper to her happiness again, and I very gentle\r\nand joyous with her, for truly my heart had been sick that she had come\r\nso nigh to that horrid danger.\r\n\r\nAnd I eased the scrip from me, and opened it, and made her to take two\r\nof the tablets, and she to refuse to eat, save I company her also; and\r\nindeed I did be very willing, for truly my belly was alway empty. And\r\nshe to be very glad to eat, because she did be clean now, and to have no\r\nmore disgust of herself. And afterward, we drank some of the water. And\r\nsoon we did be finished, and she to ask for her girdle that I did give\r\nher with the knife, as I have surely told. And she belted the cloak very\r\ngraceful about her; and lookt very dear and pretty with her little bare\r\nfeet; and her hair very lovely upon her shoulders, for she did wear\r\nalway in the Gorge the lining of my head-piece, and so had her hair dry\r\nand sweet.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I did mind now, how that she did look very beautiful in\r\nher bath, as I had gone to succour her from the snake; and I to be\r\nnicely wholesome in this remembering, because of my love, but yet to be\r\nknowing that I was sweetly stirred to new things; and did not know\r\nbefore that a maid lookt in the same moment so holy and so human. And\r\nafterward, in odd whiles, I remembered; but never to think overmuch,\r\nbecause that I did feel inwardly that I should be gently wise in such\r\nthings; and you to understand my heart in this, if that ever you have\r\nloved.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, the Maid brought me from my dreamings very sensible, in that\r\nshe had me to stand; and she was gone about me very swift and natty with\r\nher pretty fingers, that she ease me of mine armour.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, she bade me to strip and wash, whilst that she keep watch\r\nfor me of the Gorge. And she took the Diskos, and leaned upon it, very\r\nbrave and proper; but yet, as I do think, with somewhat of roguishness\r\nwithin her, very deep hid, and scarce known unto herself.\r\n\r\nAnd I warned her to be very wise with the great weapon; for it did fit\r\nonly to fight in my hands, and did be like to cause harm to any that\r\nshould meddle with it or make to use it, save me.\r\n\r\nAnd Naani to nod that she did hear me, and to be half in fear of the\r\nthing, and half to feel that it did be friendly to her; and so to stand\r\nguard for me; and truly to seem a very sweet and slender maid, despite\r\nthe bigness of the cloak; and the great weapon to seem more great in her\r\nsmall hands; and to mind me how strong I did be. And surely you shall\r\nthink me in conceit; but truly I did be glad to be so strong; and a\r\nproper thing for pride, if that there be no scorn for others therein.\r\nAnd you to agree with me in this thing, or to be lacking of sympathy and\r\ngood human understanding.\r\n\r\nNow I washt me, not by going down into the pool; for indeed I did not\r\nwot whether there be any more snakes hid there in some other hole. And\r\nthe way I washt, was that I dipt my head-piece into the hot pool, and\r\npoured the water over me, and rubbed my body very strong with my hands;\r\nand there to be, surely, some certain chemical in the water that aided\r\nmine efforts; for the water went very smooth under my hands.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was done, I washt my pocket-cloth very speedy in the pool,\r\nand wrung it, and did then wipe my body so dry as I should; and\r\nafterward I wrung the cloth again, and set it about my loins, and so to\r\nbe as proper as I might.\r\n\r\nAnd I did call to the Maid that I was proper, and she to come then and\r\nkiss me; and she gave back to me the Diskos, and set me that I stand\r\nanigh to the nearer fire-hole, and so to be that I should guard her, and\r\nin the same time be come free of the chill of the Gorge, which was not\r\ngreat in that place.\r\n\r\nAnd surely I did mean that I help her; but she would have no help in her\r\nwork that she did say to be her glad right; but bade me that I to mine\r\nown work to be her dear protector, as she did call me. And I to lift\r\nthat Wilful One into mine arms, a moment, and to give her a very loving\r\nhug, and for that time to have no fear that I harm her, because that I\r\nwas freed of the hardness of the armour about me, as you do know.\r\n\r\nAnd surely she to feel very dear and pretty in mine arms, and she kist\r\nme the once with a little passion of love; and immediately to want to go\r\nfrom me; so that I freed her in a moment, as was ever my way. And she\r\nthen to pause a small space off from me, and lookt at me with a light in\r\nher eyes, and half to put out her arms that she be taken again into\r\nmine; but so to cease, ere she yield to her heart; and turned from me\r\nimmediately to the task of the washing.\r\n\r\nAnd she took first my body-vest, and washt it very quick and clever in\r\nthe pool, and afterward came over by me, and spread it upon the hot flat\r\nrock anigh to the fire-hole.\r\n\r\nAnd she got then my change body-vest from the bundle of her torn\r\ngarments, where she did put it to be washt on opportunity, even as now;\r\nand mayhap to like that it should lie in her bundle with her own\r\ngarments, for so, as I do mind, the thought came to me very natural; but\r\nshe to say naught to lead me thus; yet to be a very honest and dear\r\nMaid, and to have little secret ways of love, as I did perceive, that I\r\ndid not be told of.\r\n\r\nAnd she washt the second body-vest, and set it to dry by the first; and\r\nafterward did likewise with all my garments, and came then to the\r\nwashing of her own.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as she spread it also to the drying, there came to mine heart\r\nthat the Maid did have only this one rough and thick garment, that did\r\nbe the armour-suit, as I have told. And surely it did be dreadful that\r\nshe have the hardness of that strong knitted and fibrous garment to be\r\nnext to her dear body, and I to be in comfort with the softness of my\r\nbody-vest.\r\n\r\nAnd I was all angered in a moment, that she had gone thiswise, while\r\nthat I had been gentled, as it might be. And I bade Naani take the\r\nsecond vest to her own use when it did be dry. And she to look upward\r\nfrom where she did turn the garments upon the hot rock; and to mean in\r\nthe first to deny me. But indeed she was quick to see that I did be\r\ntruly in anger; and mine anger to come because that I was hurt that this\r\ndid be, and because that I was shamed that she had gone so rough-clad,\r\nthe while that I had no thought to the matter. And moreover because that\r\nshe had known her lack, and did not tell me of the thing.\r\n\r\nBut yet I did have a great tenderness in the backward part of mine\r\nanger, because that I perceived all the unselfishness and delight of her\r\nlove that did be about this little matter, as you shall see, if you have\r\ngone alway with me.\r\n\r\nBut mine anger yet to be something hard, because I did see that I have\r\nneed to watch the Maid, that she put not her dear body to pain, that I\r\nmight come unknowing to some little pleasuring or ease, as did be now as\r\nI have shown. And truly it did be sweetly done in love; but to be\r\nsomewise lacking of judgement; and so shall you know somewhat of the way\r\nthat I did be angered, and to have understanding with me; but if you\r\nhave not, you shall think it to be naught, and that the Maid did need\r\nonly that she be kist, and to be shaken a little in playfulness, and\r\nwarned to heed that I did be earnest; and mayhap you to be somewise\r\nright, and not to guess far off from the inward deepness of my heart.\r\nBut yet it doth be verity that I was truly angered, and fit to shake\r\nMine Own, and in the same moment to be utter tender unto her. And surely\r\nthis doth be all a contradiction, and the human heart to be a wayward\r\nthing, whether it doth be of a man or of a woman.\r\n\r\nAnd Naani, as I do think, to have loved the chafe of that rough garment\r\nfor love\'s sake, and to go very humble and loving, as I lookt at her;\r\nbut in verity to be never gone from the sweet naughtiness that did be\r\nalway in her heart, and to plan even in that moment some new and secret\r\nservice unto me, that should be for her quiet joy, and to be hid from\r\nme, until that my wit should come upon it to uncover it. And in verity a\r\nyoung man doth want that he whip his maid and kiss her, and all in the\r\none moment. And, indeed, he to have delight in both.\r\n\r\nAnd she obeyed me that time, as alway when I did be earnest, without\r\nmore word. And surely that Naughty One did know how I loved her.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid washt then her torn garments that did be in the bundle, and\r\nhad gotten soiled by the slime of the dark part of the Gorge. And she\r\nput these to dry, and afterward washed mine armour and the scrip and the\r\npouch and the cloak-hold, and all such matters of our gear; and so to be\r\npresently done.\r\n\r\nAnd she was heedful then that she turned the garments upon the hot\r\nrock; and afterward did attend to my bruisings. And when she did rest, I\r\nlookt to her pretty feet, and rubbed them very gentle and constant with\r\nthe ointment; and surely they did be pretty well; but I to _like_ that I\r\nshould tend them, and to have joy to feel their littleness within my\r\npalms, and surely she did know how it did be with me; for presently she\r\ntook her feet inward under the cloak; and I, maybe, to look something\r\nwoeful; for she put one out presently, when that I did the least expect,\r\nand slipt it very cosy into my hand; and surely I kist her naughty toes;\r\nand she then to be very sedate.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, when Naani found the garments to be proper dry, she gave\r\nthose to me that were mine, and bid me to turn my back and be drest very\r\nspeedy. And lo! in a little time, when I was nigh done, she came over\r\nand stood before me, and was drest again in the armour-suit, and to look\r\nvery slender and dainty. And she lookt at me, so that I put out my\r\nhands, that I kiss her; but she went from me, very proper, and brought\r\nmine armour, and gave me help with it, and alway very grave and quiet;\r\nbut yet to have naughtiness underneath, as I did believe.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was full armed, she took my hand, and set mine arm about her\r\nwaist, and she leaned her head against my breast, and put up her lips to\r\nbe kist, as that she did be a child maiden; yet when I kist her, she did\r\nbe a woman, and to kiss me very dear and loving, and to look at me then\r\nfrom under her eye-lids; and sudden to make a dainty growling, and to\r\npretend that she did be a fierce thing that should be like to eat me;\r\nand I to be utter feared, as you shall think, and to be scarce able that\r\nI kiss Mine Own Pretty Fierce One, because that I did laugh so hearty,\r\nand to be so taken with a surprise that the Maid did show this new\r\nplayfulness; and in the same moment to be stirred and waked anew that\r\nshe did be so lovely and graceful in mine arms, and to make her naughty\r\ngrowling so pretty that I did be eager that she make it again; but she\r\nto do this playing only as her mood did stir her.\r\n\r\nAnd she made then that she would go from me, and I to loose her, as\r\never; and she bade me that I guard her the while that she washt the\r\noutward part of the cloak; for the inward did be clean, and the cloak\r\nproof to water; but the outward part to be something needful of washing.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, when this was made clean, it dried very quick, because that\r\nthe water went not into it; and whilst that it dried, I gave Mine Own an\r\naid upward unto the cave, and afterward I passed up the gear, and the\r\ncloak when it did be dry; and so came upward also myself, and brought\r\nwith me a boulder, that I balanced very light in the mouth of the cave,\r\nso that it should fall, if that anything toucht it; and this plan you do\r\nknow of; for I used it before, as I have told.\r\n\r\nAnd truly we did be utter wearied, and the time to be something beyond\r\nthree and twenty hours, since last we had slumber. And the Maid had the\r\nscrip and the pouch set to be for my pillow, and the bundle of her torn\r\ngarment to be for her own. And she to have me to my pillow, and to tuck\r\nthe cloak about me, and the Diskos to my hand; and afterward to kiss me\r\nvery sedate upon the lips, and then to come in under the cloak, with a\r\nquiet and lovely happiness, as I did know; and to be gone to slumber\r\nvery content and sweet.\r\n\r\nAnd I waked eight good hours after, with the fizzing of the water in\r\nmine ears; and lo! Mine Own did be waked and to make ready our\r\nbreakfast; and I came upward upon mine elbow, to see whether that the\r\nboulder did be unmoved; and indeed it was not touched.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own saw that I was come awake; and she ran to me, very dear and\r\nglad, and kist my lips very eager and loving. And surely, as she kist\r\nme, I did feel that she had taken again a naughty advantaging of my\r\nslumber, and had kist me as I did sleep; but truly I said no word of my\r\nthoughts; for I did mind that I should wake sudden one time, and so to\r\ncatch her in this, and to call her then Mine Own, and that she did be a\r\nrogue; and all as you shall know, that have loved.\r\n\r\nAnd I scolded the Maid a little, in that she had not waked me; but I\r\nsaid not that I would attend to the duties that she did heed to; for I\r\nknew that she had joy of these things, in that she did love to do aught\r\nthat should be done unto me. And when I scolded her, she to make but a\r\nlittle mouth at me, as we do say, and to put her tablets to my lips,\r\nthat I kiss them, and she to kiss mine; and so to our breakfast.\r\n\r\nAnd when we were done, we gat together our gear, and went downward from\r\nthe cave, and began again to journey. And we went eighteen hours that\r\nday, and eat and drunk at every sixth hour, as ever.\r\n\r\nAnd in the fourteenth hour, I perceived that I did be like to overtravel\r\nthe Maid, though I made alway to have a less speed than did be natural\r\nunto me. And surely then, I took her up into mine arms; and she to\r\nrefuse, and to be troubled that I should so carry her; for she did think\r\nthat I was like to be wearied by the task.\r\n\r\nAnd I to take no heed to her pretestings; but to laugh gently with her,\r\nand to carry her, even as a babe in mine arms; and she to love that she\r\nbe in mine arms, if but she be able to have assuredness that I come not\r\nto weariness through her. And truly it did be a dear love task, and to\r\nbe set unto the needing of mine especial heart.\r\n\r\nAnd I carried Mine Own then for four hours; and in the eighteenth hour\r\nwe were come to that part of the Gorge where did be the ledge where I\r\nkilled the spider, ere I slept, as you shall mayhap to mind. And here I\r\naided the Maid to climb, and we had the same ledge that night to be our\r\nrefuge; and did sleep very happy and unharmed, and alway with our\r\nspirits set to warn us, if that harm did make to come nigh to us.\r\n\r\nAnd we went then through three days of eighteen hours\' journey each;\r\nand alway I did carry Mine Own, from the twelfth unto the eighteenth\r\nhour of each journeying; and this to be very dear unto me, and to give\r\nme a new rejoicing that I did be strong and easy to carry Mine Own; and\r\nshe to lie in mine arms very content, when that she perceived how that I\r\ndid be so glad to go thiswise and that I had no weariness by the\r\ncarrying.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I did rest her feet, and wore not her dear and slender body\r\novermuch with the vigour of my going; and was abled to make a very good\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own, this time and that, to make sayings of impudence unto me,\r\nand to hide her naughty lips, when that I should kiss them; and to have\r\nquaint nestlings unto me, and odd whiles to kiss me very dainty when\r\nthat I did be going thoughtful of the way. And surely never did there be\r\nso dear a maid as Mine Own; so that I did go many a mile, and to be\r\nscarce that I knew that I was gone any way, because of the stirrings of\r\nmy heart and the content of my spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd oft as we did go, there were great scorpions in the path, and odd\r\nwhiles they to have no heed to go from my way; but to be so great as my\r\nhead, and very fat and lazy, so that surely I kickt a good number, from\r\nmy path, even as you shall kick a ball with the foot; and three I burst\r\nin this way. And truly it did be well that I had on me mine armour, else\r\nhad they been like to sting me very quick unto death; for they were so\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nAnd likewise, in this place and that, there were snakes; but none to\r\ncome anigh to me; and I to choose alway the open goings; for I did think\r\nthere to be many hid snakes and lesser monsters in the dark places\r\nbetween the great boulders. And alway, when the Maid did walk, I to go\r\nbefore, that I see clear her way, and this thing to be but a matter of\r\nwiseness, as you shall think.\r\n\r\nAnd odd whiles, as I did carry Mine Own, she to talk a little with me of\r\nher memory-dreams of the olden days; and mayhap you to think it strange\r\nthat we said not overmuch on this wise; but the way of our journey to\r\nhave been so utter bitter, as you have seen; and we to be more of that\r\nfar age, than we did be of this present age; and this present life to\r\nseem but a dream of Memory, and we to be set then with the realness of\r\nthat life. And this telling, indeed, to be a plain thing to your\r\nunderstanding. Yet did we have a greater talk to these ends, when that\r\nwe were come free of the Gorge; but yet, oft there to be an odd saying\r\nand a sweet memory, like to an olden and forgot fragrance of dreams, to\r\npass between Mine Own and me. And do you to set your sympathy of\r\nunderstanding with me in this thing, and to know how holy these things\r\ndid be, and far off, and to hold memory, as a mist that doth shine with\r\ngolden lights, that did make an holy pain upon the eyes of the spirit,\r\neven as a quiet dawn of this day doth set a pleasure of vague pain upon\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\nAnd once, as I did carry the Maid, I saw that she wept a little, very\r\nhusht unto herself; and I to say naught; for I saw that it did be a\r\nnatural sorrow for her father, and for the dead Peoples of the Lesser\r\nRedoubt; that did be left for ever unto the desolation of Eternity. And\r\nso, because I did be wise to leave her be, she to be eased presently,\r\nand to wipe her eyes, quiet and secret, and mayhap to think that I did\r\nnot perceive; and then to nestle unto me; and so to be the more Mine\r\nOwn.\r\n\r\nAnd about the middle part of the second day, we came past the cave where\r\nI did sleep on the upward journey; and I to tell Naani, and she to look\r\nupward to the cave, and to wish that she might come a moment into it;\r\nonly that it did be twenty good feet upward, and I to desire that she\r\nrun no risk of her dear life, when that there did be no need.\r\n\r\nAnd so to go onward; and odd whiles to see strange things a-lurk among\r\nthe boulders; but none to come anigh to us; yet did I keep the Diskos\r\nvery ready in my hand, as you shall think; and had mine eyes alway to\r\nlook upon every side, and mine ears to be wary; and to use my spirit\r\nalway to mine aid.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, as we did come lower in the Gorge, the Maid was all\r\na-wondered at the warmness that did grow, and something disturbed in the\r\nfirst, by the new thickness, as it did seem, of the air. And she to\r\nwaste some of the water, because that it did fizz up so quick, even as\r\nI, until that she was come used to this newness. And all this to be very\r\nplain unto you.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end of every journey, we slept eight good hours in a safe\r\nplace; and so to go onward again; and the Maid to grow very eager as I\r\ndid tell her this thing and that of the Country that we did come\r\ndownward unto.\r\n\r\nAnd she askt me questions, time and oft, and much I told her, and she to\r\nthink upon it with a growing wonder and desire, even as a gladsome child\r\nthat hath never seen the sea, and doth be told that it shall presently\r\nbe there. And this to be but to shadow the way that Naani did be; for\r\ntruly she did be a very live and eager maid, in all things.\r\n\r\nAnd we to be still within the Gorge, and to go constant by the\r\nfire-holes and the fire-pits, and to see the flames leap upward in this\r\nplace and that, so that the mighty walls of the Gorge would show very\r\nplain in an instant; and immediately to come the shadows again, and\r\nafterward the leaping of the flames. And so did it be forever. And oft\r\nthe muttering of the fire-pits; and oft the utter quiet and the shadows.\r\n\r\nAnd this time and that there did be a snake to go by us, and the\r\nscuttling of the monster scorpions; and mayhap a moving in the shadows\r\nof the great boulders, that did tell me there went maybe some peculiar\r\nmonster in that place; so that I did be very wary, and to have the\r\nDiskos alway ready.\r\n\r\nAnd when the fourth day was come, I showed the Maid, in the sixth hour,\r\nthe ledge that did be my first sleeping place, when that I was entered\r\ninto the Gorge.\r\n\r\nNow presently, in the eleventh hour, after that we had gone five hours\r\nin a gloom, there did show afar off a shining; and I caught the Maid,\r\nand I pointed; and she also to perceive that it did be surely the\r\nshining of the light of that great Country that I did tell upon.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately we did begin to run downward, and with sore stumblings\r\nin this place and that; but not to halt us; for we did be so mad as two\r\nchildren for the gladsome light.\r\n\r\nAnd we came down presently in the twelfth hour of that journey into the\r\nwarm light and wonder of the Country of the Seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nHOMEWARD BY THE SHORE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we came presently out of that sad and dreary place that did go\r\ninward of the great mountains, and which I have named the Upward Gorge;\r\nand we to halt soon between the feet of the mountains, beyond the\r\nmouth-part of the Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd Naani alway to look every way about her, and to breathe very quick,\r\nand her eyes to be gone bright with wonder and the seeing of new things,\r\nand the coming of freedom from so great a dread.\r\n\r\nAnd she turned, now, and did look upward into the dark of the Gorge, and\r\nto spy upon the great mouth thereof, and to be feared then, and must run\r\na greater way downward into the lightness of the Country of the Seas;\r\nand to come once more to pause, and to look backward, and with an awe\r\nand a relieved soul; and so again to the wonder of the spreaded Country\r\nand the great Sea; and did near to laugh and cry in the same moment,\r\nwith the amazement and gladness and great astonishment that did be upon\r\nher. And she to turn constant this way and that, and to be never ceased\r\nof looking, and of deep breathings of the wide air; for never in that\r\nlife had she been in a broad place of light, as you shall have\r\nperceived.\r\n\r\nAnd we to feel, both, that there did be no more need to talk husht, as\r\nwe did alway in the gloom and narrow dark of the gorge. And surely she\r\nto shout, as a child that doth try an echo; and her voice to go very\r\npretty into the distance, and to be lost afar off in that Country.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in a moment, an echo to come out of the dark mountains to our\r\nbacks; so that we lookt round very sudden; but whether the echo did be\r\ntruly an echo, or some strangeness, or some unnatural call to come\r\ndownward out of the gloom and horror of the Gorge, we did be all unsure;\r\nand indeed must run downward a while more, until that we did be all\r\nbreathed, and to halt presently where we did feel to be utter free of\r\nthe Gorge and of the strangeness that did seem to our minds, in that\r\nmoment, to lie upward in the darkness of the great mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd surely we did took about for a flat rock to be for our use, and we\r\ncame presently to a place nice to our purpose, that did be yet upward\r\nover the Land; and we climbed up on to the rock and sat thereon to have\r\nour food and drink.\r\n\r\nAnd as we eat and drank, we did sit very close and happy; but yet to\r\nhave a wise looking about anigh to us, so that we be caught by no danger\r\nof the Humpt Men, or by any other danger that might be.\r\n\r\nAnd alway, the Maid did question, and did stare afar over the Country,\r\nand to have a shining wonder and joy of the sea, and to be stirred in\r\nall her being, so that she was pained with vague and sudden memories,\r\nthat did be as strange dreams, and all mixt with pleasure and pain. And,\r\nindeed, she sudden to weeping, and to need that she be in mine arms,\r\nuntil that she know herself once again; and so to her dear natural joy\r\nand way.\r\n\r\nAnd oft did Mine Own speak upon the clear wonder of the air, as it did\r\nseem to her; and to me it did seem likewise, that had lived my life also\r\nin a Dark Land, as you do know.\r\n\r\nAnd she to break sudden from her rapture, and to set back her speech an\r\nEternity with vague words, and memories so olden and englamoured that\r\nthey did be as moonlight that once hath shone. And in a moment she to be\r\nforward again into that far future time and speech, and all her being to\r\nbe close unto me, and oft in a solemn silence of the heart.\r\n\r\nAnd the greatness of the sea to call unto her with an olden voice, and\r\nto half waken her; and I with her to be thus half-wakened, yet had I\r\nbeen not thus as I did come mine outward way; but truly I did stir to\r\nthe stirring of the Maid, and all mine olden thoughts that did be my\r\nmemory-dreams, to come afresh upon my spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd so we two to sit there all shaken with dreamings that did concern\r\nhappenings of the olden world that did lie upward in that dreadful night\r\nwhich made a mighty and deeply roof over that Country. And surely I am\r\ndumb, in that I have no speech to make known to you all the troublings\r\nand stirrings of our spirits that we did know in that moment.\r\n\r\nAnd far off, by miles, beyond the feet of the mountain, where went the\r\nshore of the sea, upon our left, there was a great mist and steam; and\r\nthis to be that mist and steam that I did come through on mine outward\r\nway; and Naani to ask concerning it, and I to tell her so much as I\r\nknew, and how that we must indeed come presently through it, upon our\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nAnd she to be in wonder of the volcanoes that did burn in the sea, and\r\nin this place and that of the wide Country, and the height and grandness\r\nto exalt her, and in the same time to give her a strange humbleness of\r\nher mind; so that presently I did take her into mine arms, for I must\r\nkiss her, because that she did be so utter a sweet maiden, and lovely\r\nwith interest and naturalness. And truly she to kiss me in turn; and to\r\nmake her questionings between her kissings; and this to be because she\r\ndid yearn for a greater knowing of the Country; but also, as I do half\r\nto think, because she did be sweetly impudent unto me; and this to be of\r\nher joy.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, she to kiss me thrice very passionate and warm upon the\r\nmouth; and immediately to take my shoulders, with her small hands, that\r\ndid seem so pretty upon my broadness and upon the metal of the armour.\r\nAnd she to strive thus that she shake me to a speedier answering; and\r\nshe, all that while, to be full of a dear naughtiness, and to need that\r\nshe be kist very hard.\r\n\r\nAnd I to answer her; but after mine own fashion which did be a word\r\nbetween each kiss that I gave to her. And she very quick and naughty to\r\nput her hand between our lips; and I then to kiss the palm, that did be\r\nin my way, and did be very small and pretty. And she, when I had no\r\nthought, to open her fingers very quick, and kiss me through between the\r\nfingers, and immediately to shut the fingers, so that I did be stopt\r\nfrom the same.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I made her to stand upon the rock, and I set free her\r\nhair over her shoulders; and I took then the boots from her, so that her\r\nlittle feet did show bare and pretty. And she, at the first, half to\r\nrefuse me; but afterward to stand very dear and obedient that I should\r\nhave my way with her; and to be a little shy, and the more pretty\r\nbecause of her sweet blushings.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, when that I had her to my likings, I stept back a little\r\npace, and lookt at her. And she to look again at me, very quaint and\r\nnaughty; and then to turn her about, very grave; and to make pretend\r\nthat she did be a dummy figure. And, surely, when she did be come right\r\nround, and to face me again, and had a very sedate look, she stretched\r\nout her pretty foot, all in a moment, and put her pink toes sudden upon\r\nmy lips; and I to be so in surprise, that I had not wit to do aught, ere\r\nshe had them back swift from me. And she then to make one glad spring\r\ninto mine arms, and to want that she be hugged, and to be loved very\r\ngreat. And I to laugh, all tender; for I loved her so utter, as you do\r\nknow; and I to tell her, as you sure likewise to have told your maid,\r\nthat I wanted a pocket sufficient, that I might have her therein alway\r\nanigh to my heart; and this thing I to say to her, as a man that doth\r\nlove, shall say it; and you to know the way of it so well as I. And she\r\nto laugh very mischievous, and to tell me that she should truly tickle\r\nme, if that I carried her thatwise; aye and to pinch me, too. And I to\r\nhave no answer, save that I shake her, very gentle, but indeed she to\r\nkiss me very naughty on the mouth, in the midst of my shaking; and\r\ntruly, what shall a man do with such an one.\r\n\r\nAnd she then to want to be more sedate and to be set down upon the rock;\r\nand she to make me to turn around, so that she should come at the pouch,\r\nwhich did be upon my back.\r\n\r\nAnd she gat thence the comb that was a fitment, and did comb her pretty\r\nhair, and I to sit and talk with her, and to jest, with a heart that did\r\nbe so light as it had not been for a great while; for though I did dread\r\nthe Humpt Men and the monstrous animals of the Country of Seas, I had\r\nnot any abiding horror of aught that I had seen in that Country; for\r\nthere seemed a naturalness in all things, so that I did have no\r\nloathing; neither any fear of an Evil Force.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, when that the Maid had combed her hair, she to bind it\r\nupon her head; but I to ask that she leave it upon her shoulders,\r\nbecause that it did be so pretty; and she to smile at me, and to be\r\nhappy to my pleasuring.\r\n\r\nNow we did be truly sedate, and to set our gear together; and I to put\r\nthe boots upon the Maid; and afterward we to begin again to journey\r\ndownward into the Country of the Seas.\r\n\r\nAnd we went at a good pace; but not to bring us to any great weariness;\r\nfor it was mine intent that we rest for our slumber upon this side of\r\nthe place where did be the steam of the boilings, that was anigh to the\r\nshore of the sea, as you shall mind.\r\n\r\nAnd we at this time to be passing along the feet of the mountains, unto\r\nthe place of the steam; and to go thiswise for six good hours, and still\r\nto be a great hour off that part; for we went not so fierce as did be\r\nthe speed of mine outward way, which was utter strong, as you do mind,\r\nthat have gone with me in all my journey.\r\n\r\nAnd so, when we had walkt six hours, we did be gone something beyond the\r\neighteenth hour of that day\'s journeying; and to be very ready to our\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nNow, presently we found a tall rock, very hard to climb, that had a flat\r\ntop so great as may be twice my length everyways; and this to be very\r\ngood to our purpose. And when we were come safe to the top, we to eat\r\nand drink, and presently to sleep, and to have the cloak under us, as\r\ndid be the will of the Maid; for the Country did be utter warm and nice,\r\nso that we had no occasion for covering.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, we waked, both of us when that we had slept seven good\r\nhours; and we sat upward, and lookt newly each at the other; and to be\r\nas that we did each see the other anew in that good light, and to have a\r\nfresh joy each in the look of the other. And she to come into mine arms,\r\nand to kiss and to need that she be kist; and truly, we both to have our\r\nneed; but yet to be something the more hungry of the other, for the\r\nhaving.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own then to make our breakfast; and the water to fizz very\r\nstrong and surprising; and we to eat and drink, and to be utter happy\r\neach with the other, and to talk on this thing and that, and the Maid to\r\nlook about, as we eat; and she to look afar off at the wonders and the\r\nnewness of the Country to her knowledge; but I to look near, lest there\r\nbe any danger that might be anigh.\r\n\r\nAnd in a while, Mine Own to draw my gaze to the Mountains that the Gorge\r\ncame through. And, in verity, now that I did look in ease, I to see with\r\nher how that they did be truly monstrous, even as a monstrous wall that\r\ndid go upward for ever until that they were gone out of the light of\r\nthat Country, into the dark night of the deathly Upper World, that did\r\nbe lost an eternity. And I to mind that I had some vague thoughts\r\nthiswise, on the outward way; but now I to have ease, and the Maid to\r\nspeak with, and so to perceive odd matters the more. And I to tell you\r\nthis little thing, so that you shall perceive the way that restfulness\r\ndid be upon me, by compare with the Outward Going.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, we had no great speed with our talk and with our eating; but\r\nin the end did make somewhat to hurry, because that we did be conscious\r\nthat we leaned to slackness. And indeed, we came down then pretty speedy\r\nfrom the rock where we did sleep; and had forward to our way at a good\r\npace.\r\n\r\nAnd when we had gone a while, we to begin to hear the far hissing of the\r\nsteam and the noise of the upward burstings of waters that did boil; and\r\nthe sound to be very strange; but I to have heard it before, as you do\r\nknow; so that it to trouble me the less than the Maid. And I to assure\r\nher; and she to come nigh to me, and thiswise we to enter presently into\r\nthe steam.\r\n\r\nAnd we went then for more than three hours; and I had the Maid to my\r\nback, that I should be the first; and this I did, that she have no\r\ndanger to walk into a boiling pool in the mazingness of the steam, which\r\nwas everywhere. And I to be something guided in my path by the shore of\r\nthe sea which did be unto our left alway; only that we could see neither\r\nthe sea nor otherwise, except that we go so close that we near into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, the sea to seem to boil in parts, and there to be hot pools\r\nin all places; so that who should say with ease whether we did go by one\r\nof the great hot pools or by the true sea. And this, our constant\r\npuzzle, shall be likewise to you; and you to perceive how that we did go\r\nutter wary.\r\n\r\nAnd about us from every part there did come the strange burstings and\r\nshriekings and whistlings of the boil of the waters breaking upward from\r\nthe deep world. And odd whiles the sounds to be as of great monsters;\r\nand the earth to shake under us; and other-whiles there to be a hush and\r\nonly the steam about us, and somewhere in the distance and uncertainness\r\na low piping of some steam cranny, very strange and lonesome-sounding.\r\n\r\nAnd when it did be somewheres nigh upon the fourth hour, we came out of\r\nthe thick steam; and the pipings and the roarings to be to our rearward;\r\nand soon the steam to be gone thin, as but a mist, and the noises to be\r\nvery far-seeming; and presently we to be come clear out into the air of\r\nthat Country.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid now to perceive the trees, which did be in great forests\r\nunto our right hand, while that the shore of the sea did go alway upon\r\nour left. And she to be utter in wonder of the trees; and to need that\r\nshe pluck branches, and smell of them and look at each leaf; and so to\r\nbe all stirred; for never in that life did she to have seen such a\r\nmatter as those great trees did be; but yet to be all stirred by vague\r\nmemories that did seem no more than dreams. And you to think but a\r\nmoment, and to perceive how the thing did be with her; and you to have\r\nbeen likewise stirred, if that you did be so strangely waked in a corner\r\npart of the heart; though but a little matter to wake you.\r\n\r\nNow when the sixth hour did be full come, we made a halt in a wise\r\nplace, and had there our tablets and the water; and afterward, the Maid\r\nbid me that I take her unto a warm pool that did be near by, and to ask\r\nthat I turn from her, but yet to be anigh for her Protector, as I did be\r\never.\r\n\r\nAnd so she to wash and to make herself happy with a sweet cleanness that\r\ndid be proper to her; and afterward, when she did be done, she to act\r\nwatch whilst I to mine; and to help me in all matters, that she was\r\nable; and truly, I to be happy indeed that she did so have delight to\r\nattend upon me and to treat me mother-wise; yet truly with her\r\nmaid-heart not all hid, as you have perceived, this time and that.\r\n\r\nAnd surely thus did we go alway in these matters; and oft that I have\r\nnot space to have told; and oft that you shall remember, if that I do be\r\ntoo full of other happenings to give heed to tell upon.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward we to our journeying again; and to talk upon this thing\r\nand that thing; and I to be watchful as we talked, and to tell the Maid\r\nthat she keep her eyes wary, but yet not to be of unease.\r\n\r\nAnd when we did go thiswise for seven good hours, we were come nigh\r\nopposed to the bright-burning fire-hill that did be offward in the sea,\r\nand had made me a warm light in that time when I did sleep in the tree,\r\nas you do remember. And truly, as I shall here mind you, we did be past\r\nseven hours coming to this place, from the part where the steam did be;\r\nyet had I gone that space upon the outward way at a speed that was\r\ngreater; but truly I might not set so great a pace to the Maid, save,\r\nmayhap, odd whiles; and this thing I beg that you have alway in your\r\nmind, and so to understand why that we did be oft long upon this part of\r\nthe journey and that, by compare with mine outward going.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I had set off our hour for food, because that I saw we\r\ndid come nigh to the place where the tree did be; and I to know that the\r\nMaid should like to eat and drink anigh to that place, and to know that\r\nI did sleep there.\r\n\r\nAnd surely I took her to the tree, and when that I told her, she to beg\r\nme that I indulge her and that we go upward to that branch where I did\r\nsleep, and there to eat our tablets.\r\n\r\nAnd I to be willing, and to enter into her wishing; for, indeed, there\r\nwas no danger in the climb, and I to go alway below her, so that I could\r\nbe surety for her safeness. And we came up to the great branch; and she\r\nto make how we should sit, and I to have to show just where I did lie,\r\nand she to look very close, and to see that my weight had surely marked\r\nthe hardness of the armour upon the bark; and she then to be upon that\r\nbranch alone, as she did eat and drink; and to look outward at the light\r\nfrom the fire-hill, and to be very husht, and to think, and I not to\r\ndisturb her with speech.\r\n\r\nAnd when she did be done, she gat from the branch, and kist the place\r\nwhere I did lie; and lo! in a moment a thought came into her, and she\r\ndrew her knife, and cut out a piece of the bark, and put it into her\r\nbreast to be for a keepsake; and so to seem somewise contented.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, I told her about the great beast, when we were come down\r\nagain to the earth; and she to cry out and to show me that there did be\r\nyet the mark where the belly of the monstrous beast did brush upon the\r\nearth, as it ran, and moreover the broken places of the foot-marks; and\r\nshe by this to see how great a beast it did be; but yet did it be a\r\nlittle thing beside the Slug; only that it did be a thing of horn and\r\nhardness of skin, as you have perceived.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, I do mind how that the observings of the Maid did bring very\r\nkeen to me how that there had past but seventeen days since that I did\r\ngo onward from this place; and this to seem very strange and scarce\r\ncredible unto me; for I had thought it, somewise, as a great time; and\r\ntruly this to be because it was so marked by stress of the mind and\r\ngreat happenings; and you to agree in this thing. But yet, also, we\r\nshall truly mind that those times that I have called days, did hold oft\r\nthe hours of two days, and mayhap three, as you do remember. Now we\r\nwent onward then to our journeying; and I to make to carry the Maid, as\r\never, after that she had walked twelve hours, though she did walk\r\nthirteen hours this time as you have seen. And she to say that she go\r\nnow upon her own feet through the next six hours, and so to ease me from\r\nthe labour that did be needful to carry her.\r\n\r\nBut I to know how that she did be like to be all gone of her strength\r\nthiswise, in but a day or two, and we to make the better speed, if that\r\nI keep to my way, and to have her to walk twelve hours of every journey,\r\nand afterward to come into mine arms; for, truly, she did be bred less\r\nhardy than I, as you shall think from all that I have told concerning\r\nthe Peoples of the Lesser Pyramid; and moreover she was yet something\r\nweakened, as I did think, by the dreadful month of her lonesomeness and\r\nescapings, before that I was come to succour her.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, as I did carry her, the Maid did make remark of her\r\nwonderment concerning me, in that I did be so hard of my body and set in\r\nthe determination of my mind. And, in verity, I did be exceeding strong\r\nand of great hardness of body; and mayhap my will did be somewhat this\r\nway also, else do I think I had never borne to come unto Mine Own\r\nthrough so much desolation. And I to smile very happy upon her; for I\r\ndid love that I was so strong, and very truly in delight that Mine Own\r\nMaid did take gladness in this thing. And you to mind how you did be\r\nalso in the love-days; and so to have nice understanding of my\r\nnaturalness and human pride.\r\n\r\nAnd surely the Maid did nestle unto me, as she did talk; even, somewise,\r\nas a Child shall come nigh to the Mother, but yet also as a Maid doth\r\nlove to be nigh unto her Man, if that she doth truly love. And I to lift\r\nher more nigh to my lips; but she to refuse to kiss me, and to be a\r\nSweet Impertinence that did lie in mine arms; yet when I did make to\r\nlower her again to the way that had her easy to carry, she to slip her\r\npretty face very snug under my chin, and to kiss me there, after her own\r\nfashion; and afterward to be willing that she be as usual into mine\r\narms.\r\n\r\nNow, as I set the Maid again comfortable, it seemed to me that she was\r\nsomething tender; and sudden it came to me that mayhap the armour to be\r\nvery hard and painful unto her; and I to ask this thing of her, in a\r\nmoment; and she to see that I would not be put off; and so to tell me.\r\nAnd, truly, I was utter angered with myself; and somewise also with her,\r\nin that she did not waken mine unthinkingness to this thing.\r\n\r\nAnd I set her instant to the earth, and made her to bare her shoulders\r\nto me; and truly they did be much bruised where that she had lain so oft\r\nin mine arms, against the hardness of mine armour.\r\n\r\nAnd I to be so angered that I near shook her, and she to see how I did\r\nbe, and that she did be nigh to be shaken, because that I was grown so\r\nangry that she should let herself come to this foolish hurt, that yet I\r\ndid know was very dear unto her secret heart. And, in truth, she put up\r\nher lips to me, very sudden, and with a strange naughtiness, that she\r\nhave her own way with me to tempt me from mine anger, that yet she did\r\nhalf to like. And, in verity, I near slapt her then upon her pretty\r\nshoulders, but that she ceased from her tempting of me; and instead she\r\nturned her shoulders to me, even as a child, that I button her garment\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, when I had buttoned her garment, she came round unto me, and\r\nclosed her hand, so that it did be a little fist, even as I did love her\r\nto do, because that it was so small beside my great hand.\r\n\r\nAnd she slipt her shut hand into mine; and surely I let it stay within,\r\nvery quiet, and made not to close upon it, as I did wont. And the Maid\r\ndid move her hand around in mine, that she make me to take notice upon\r\nher, and to grasp her little fist. Yet I did be very stern, for I was\r\ntruly angered; and neither did I put her hand from mine, nor made to\r\nhold it; but only to let it bide; yet, truly, I to be something stirred\r\nin the heart-part by her pretty ways.\r\n\r\nAnd in a little while, she took her hand from out of mine, and did have\r\ndaring to be cold unto me. And mine anger then to be quaintly renewed,\r\nand to think that she did well need to be whipt. And she made a naughty\r\nand foolish impudence upon that which I said to her; so that presently I\r\ndid say that she did need such as should make her to heed her manners;\r\nbut yet, as you shall conceive, I to know inwardly all that time how\r\nthat even this true naughtiness did not stir me to proper anger; but\r\nmore that it made me masterful and to lack not that I make her to know\r\ntruly that I did be her Master; and in the same time to be strangely\r\ntouched in a very deep and secret place of my heart. And truly love doth\r\nhave strange actings upon the heart.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid to ask me in a very saucy fashion that did be intentioned\r\nto anger me, what I did mean that she to need. And truly I said that she\r\ndid go the way to earn that she be flogged like any boy, and I to mean\r\nactual all that I did say, which doth something amaze me now; but, as I\r\ndo know, I yet to be constant stirred inwardly by her beloved quaintness\r\nthat did be alway so dainty, even when that she did mean her naughtiness\r\nto be truly to anger me.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! when I told the Maid this thing, that she did well go to earn a\r\nsharp reproof, she turned in a quick instant, and came close to me, all\r\ntender and small and to need to be nigh to me. And she slipt both her\r\nclosed hands into the one of mine, and truly they did be little fists.\r\nAnd because I could be no more stern with Mine Own, I put mine arm about\r\nher, and she did nestle to me, so that all my being did want to be a\r\nshield about her.\r\n\r\nAnd she to hark very quiet and humble to my counsellings; and in the\r\nend did be so strangely husht that I lookt down to where her pretty face\r\ndid be hid against mine armour, as she did love to do, when that I did\r\nbe those odd whiles a little stern with her. And I held her face away\r\nfrom mine armour; and surely she did be smiling, very quiet and naughty;\r\nso that I perceived that she did be good only for that time, and did be\r\nlike to show again this wrongful and impudent spirit. Yet I not then to\r\nbe in trouble of the future; but to hope only that I do wisely, if that\r\nshe show again this waywardness. And, truly, I to perceive now that I\r\ndid be very young; but, anywise, as you do know, I to act alway from the\r\nnatural telling of my heart.\r\n\r\nAnd I shook Naani a little, for this naughty spirit which did not be\r\ngone from her. For I perceived that my manhood had but stirred the woman\r\nin her to that strange quick humbleness that had seemed to be a\r\nquenching of her wayward unwisdom; and truly it had not been stilled,\r\nbut only sunken for a little moment in the uprising of her dear nature,\r\nwhich had responded unto me.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid to look at me from under her lids, as I did shake her with\r\ngentleness; and I to know that Mine Own did be a wondrous maiden, full\r\nof all life and spirit, and to be held wisely and to be loosed wisely,\r\nall as did be for the best to bring out the uttermost of her goodness\r\nwhich did be in all her being, and to be very lovely; and to make me\r\nfeel as that I did be a giant that held a white flower very tender; but\r\nI to feel also that I did be her Master. And this mayhap you to\r\nunderstand, if that you look into your hearts.\r\n\r\nAnd by all my telling, you to know that I did be very dainty with Mine\r\nOwn Maid that did be all of daintiness; but yet I to be masterful, as\r\ndid be my nature, and a very proper way it did be with the Maid, so that\r\nshe did be alway reasonable in the main; and this to come out of her\r\nlove, which did have pleasure to know that I did be Master unto her, all\r\nin the same while that she did fight to show that I did be otherwise.\r\nAnd truly, and in part by this same showing, you shall perceive that her\r\nnaughtiness to come likewise from her love, and the way that my nature\r\ndid work upon her.\r\n\r\nNow I to shake the Maid very gentle, as I have said, and with much that\r\ndid be of play, but in the same wise there to be also somewhat of tender\r\nreproof. And surely, that naughty maid to spring very light upon her\r\ntoes, and had kist me sudden and dainty upon the mouth, before that I\r\ndid wot.\r\n\r\nAnd I to put mine arm about her, and to give her a little hug; and\r\nimmediately then to matters that did be practical; for I was eager to\r\nhave come across that stony part of the journey, that did be before us,\r\nas you do know, before that we look for a place for our slumber. And\r\nthis eagerness of haste to be, because of the great bird things which I\r\nhad seen to go bounding over that waste, when that I was upon mine\r\noutward way.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely, after that I had thought a little moment, I bid the Maid\r\nthat she dress in her torn garments, so that these should be over the\r\ntop of the armour-suit, and thiswise to make a soft thickness upon the\r\ntop of the armour-suit, that should act for a cushion between mine\r\narmour and her dear body.\r\n\r\nBut indeed, the Maid would nowise to do this thing; and I not to make\r\nher, because that my heart perceived how it did be with her. And her\r\nreasons to be someways mixt, as doth be proper in all humans, and the\r\nmore so when that it doth be a maid that hath reasons, as you to know,\r\nif that you have ever held such dear perverseness in your arms.\r\n\r\nAnd she, as I could know, to be strangely in love that her gentle body\r\nbe bruised by the hardness of mine armour; and if this might not be, she\r\nto be not wishful that she wear her torn clothing upon her neat suit and\r\nso to seem careless and to lack to be dainty in mine eyes; for, indeed,\r\nshe did be alway to wash herself and to make tidiness; and she to have a\r\nway now that she did set the armour-suit upon her, that had it to seem\r\ndifferent, and she to have set a little sprig from the trees upon her\r\nbreast, and in her girdle, and so to seem the more of a maid; and surely\r\na man doth know and love these things; but not alway to have full\r\nknowing how that they be done. And, indeed, you to be likewise with me\r\nin this thing. And we all to think we know, but somewise to be just\r\na-lack when that it doth come to the proof.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, the Maid to find a way that she be eased of the hardness\r\nof the armour; and I to have come to the same thing in the same moment;\r\nbut truly I do think she had been able to think upon it a long while, if\r\nthat she had been so desired.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, this was but that I fold the cloak very thick across mine\r\narms and breast, and to take her then into the little nest that did be\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely, now that the Maid might no more have her secret wish that\r\nshe lie close against mine armour, she to be helpful, and to have the\r\ncloak folded so in a very quick while; and so to be into mine arms\r\nagain; and we to be once more upon the journey, and she to nestle to me,\r\nas that she did hunger to be nigh to me; and she to talk with me, odd\r\nwhiles, and odd whiles to be silent.\r\n\r\nAnd once, I to think that she wept a little; and to know that she did be\r\nlike to think upon her father and her own Peoples; but she to have her\r\nface turned to me, so that I could but guess upon this thing; and she\r\nvery soon to be husht again of this sorrow, and to lie content in mine\r\narms.\r\n\r\nAnd once, when that I had carried her for three hours, she to ask me\r\nthat I kiss her; and truly I did kiss her, very gentle and with\r\nreverence, because that my heart did understand the holiness that did be\r\nin her heart in that moment.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely, as I kist her, she to kiss me very tender; and I to know\r\nthat some olden memory did be like to stir in her. And in a moment, she\r\nto take her lips from mine, where she had let them to nestle very light,\r\nand did whisper mine olden love-name; and I then to look at her, and her\r\neyes to shine as the olden stars that did shine in the olden summers.\r\n\r\nAnd I to be too shaken even that I kiss her. But she to put her arms\r\nabout my neck, and to look steadfast into mine eyes. And immediately,\r\nafter that she had lookt awhile, and I to have ceased from walking, she\r\nto put her hands upon each side of my face, within the metal of mine\r\nhead-gear, where the guards did come down at the sides; and she to kiss\r\nme very sober upon the lips; but yet to mean utter by that kiss. And I\r\nnot to return the kiss; for I saw that it did not be her need.\r\n\r\nNow, in the beginning of the fourth hour, as I did go with the Maid, I\r\nto see afar off one of the half-bird monsters, that I did see before\r\nupon this place where there did be naught save great stones and boulders\r\nfor a great way that did be many miles.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, I to hide very swift with the Maid, where two great boulders\r\ndid come together; and surely the bird-creature to go past at no great\r\nway, and to go with a great bounding, that did be half of flight and\r\nhalf of leaping, as that it did be too weighty in the body to make to\r\nfly proper.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, I to have a sudden memory how that there did be a picture\r\nin some book that I did read in the Mighty Pyramid, where it did show\r\nsuch a bird-thing as this; and to make remark in the book that these\r\nthings had been seen no more in the Night Land for a score thousand of\r\nyears, or more; and to be extinct, as we do say.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, now I do think that they did be come downward to that warm\r\nCountry, a great while gone, and so to have new life and to breed\r\nthrough a great age, and this way to have set a pattern unto the Humans.\r\nAnd, in verity, it might be that in some age that did be far after that\r\ntime, the Humans to find some way to journey from the Pyramid, and to\r\nbuild a new Refuge in that deep Country; and mayhap the Humans thiswise\r\nto have a new space of life, after that all the Night Land did be dead\r\nand lost in the bitter frost of Eternity. But this, indeed, to be no\r\nmore than an odd thought; for how might any great multitude pass the\r\nMonsters; and I to ask that you take it for nothing of fact, but only as\r\nof my suppositions; and thiswise to come back again to happenings.\r\n\r\nNow, when the bird-thing did be gone a long way off, I to go forward\r\nagain with Mine Own, and to have a new care, and to look very swift and\r\nfrequent everyway.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, it did be as that the creatures did inhabit that part of the\r\nCountry; for in an hour after that, I to see a good score. And, I to\r\nfree the Diskos from my hip, and to have it ready in mine arms beside\r\nthe Maid; and so to journey.\r\n\r\nAnd many times I to have to hide with Mine Own, and to crouch low among\r\nthe rocks and the boulders; and this way to escape free of all for a\r\ngreat while.\r\n\r\nYet, when that the fifth hour did be nigh gone, I heard a noise sudden\r\nto my back, as we did go over a clear space. And, in verity, there did\r\nbe one of the monsters that came upward over certain rocks that were to\r\nmy rearward; and surely it to have been stayed hid there, or resting,\r\nand to have heard us or to have smelled us; but anywise then to have\r\nknowledge of us, and to come with low and brutish heavy boundings, very\r\nlumbersome, after us.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt everyway in a moment; but there was nowhere any shelter\r\nanigh. And the Maid to leap sudden from mine arms, that I be free with\r\nthe Diskos; and I to look swift to her, and to see that she have her\r\nknife ready in her hand, that she might chance to aid me. But surely I\r\nmight not fight in ease of mind, if that Mine Own did be needless in\r\ndanger; and I caught her very quick by the waist, and set her upon the\r\nground between my feet. And she to make half to refuse; but I to have no\r\ntime for explaining, and to be sharp that I have her safe; so that I\r\ngave her a little shake that did sudden to make her feel the strength in\r\nme; and she then to be instant quiet in my hands, and to let me that I\r\nset her upon her face, and to cast the thick cloak above her; and in a\r\nmoment to be stood over her, and to set down the visor of mine\r\nhead-gear, lest that the bird-monster strike me in the face.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, the bird-thing did be scarce an hundred good paces off; and\r\nto make two lumbering and monstrous bounds, and to come at me.\r\n\r\nYet, truly, it made sudden a pause, because that the Diskos did roar and\r\nsend out fire, as I made it to spin; but in an instant the great thing\r\nto come in at me upon the left side, and to strike me very hard with the\r\nbill, that did be so long as mine arm, and had surely gone through my\r\nbody, if that I had been naked. And the bill of the monster rang upon\r\nmine armour; and it smote me twice thiswise, so that I staggered very\r\nsick and shaken. But in a moment, as it made to draw off, that it should\r\ncome the more hard upon me, I swung the Diskos very sure and quick, and\r\nI smote the Bird-thing above the place where the great seeming-leathern\r\nwing did join upon the right side, as it should be the shoulder of the\r\nBird-monster. And, in verity, the monster gave out a mighty squarking,\r\nand went backward this way and that, and beat all about upon the stones,\r\nand did strike with the great bill at the place where it did be hurt.\r\nAnd I heeded that I end it swiftly; and I ran in upon it, and the\r\ncreature to strike at me with the great bill, very savage. But I jumpt\r\nspeedy to this side, and again to that, and so in a moment to have\r\nchance to come in surely. And truly I split the skull of the\r\nBird-thing, so that it died very quick and was gone from pain.\r\n\r\nAnd the Bird-creature lay all spread upon the stones and the rock of\r\nthat place; and surely it did be as that it were leathern, and made\r\nsomewise as a bat doth be of this age, in that it did have no feathers.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, it lookt mighty, where it did be spread; and indeed the body\r\nto be full so big as the body of a young horse; and the bill to be very\r\ndeadly and sharp and cumbrous, as you to have guessed. And I to be all\r\nand utter thankful that it did be there, dead, in the stead of mine own\r\nbody. And the thing yet to twitch and stir a little, as the life did go\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nAnd surely I was back then very speedy to the Maid, and she to be\r\nkneeled upward to watch me. And I took her into mine arms, and lookt\r\nwell about; and made then forward again.\r\n\r\nAnd about the middle part of the sixth hour of crossing that rocky land,\r\nI saw that we did draw near unto the shallow river, that you shall mind\r\nI came over, after that I had done with the olden flying ship. And in\r\nall that time, since the Bird-monster to come after us, I had seen but\r\ntwo more, and they a great way off, so that I guessed that I was come\r\nbeyond that part where they did go very frequent.\r\n\r\nAnd I to wade over the river, and to carry Mine Own upon one arm, the\r\nwhile that I did sound my way with the staff of the Diskos; and truly I\r\ncame across very easy, save that I did have to go around somewhat, where\r\nthat the river did seem to have a deep place.\r\n\r\nAnd when that we had crost the river, it did be full one and twenty\r\nhours since that we slumbered, as you shall know, if that you but count\r\na little; for you do mind that we spent a certain time within the tree,\r\nas I have told; and this not to have been proper counted into the time\r\nof our journeying.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, the Maid to have been very quiet, since that I did show my\r\nstrength a little to her, when that I made her to lie, that she be safe\r\nfrom the bill of the Bird-monster. But she not to be anywise in anger\r\nupon me; but only, as I do think, that the woman in her did be something\r\nfresh waked unto me; and she to be very content that she be quiet in\r\nmine arms.\r\n\r\nNow the place that we were come to, was much spread with boulders; but\r\nyet to have the beginnings again of the forests, as you to remember; for\r\nI to have made some small remark of the land in this part, upon mine\r\noutward way. And we lookt about for a fire-hole, that I should dry my\r\nlower garments; and truly, we had not past many in a great while; but we\r\nto be in fortune, that we came soon upon a little fire-hill that did be\r\nno more than so high as a man, and to have the rock all hot about; so\r\nthat this did be a good place to our purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd I kist the Maid, and set her down out of mine arms; and when that I\r\nhad lookt well about, and seen that there did be naught to our sight to\r\ngive us to fear, the Maid to help me with mine armour; and afterward\r\nwith my garments, and to ease me all ways that she could think of with\r\nhelpfulness. And she set the garments of my lower parts to dry, and\r\nwhilst that they did be drying, she to make ready the water and the\r\ntablets, and to have me to sit beside her, in my body-vest and gear, and\r\nwe to eat and drink very comfortable in the warm hollow that was\r\nsomething anigh to the small fire-hill.\r\n\r\nNow, truly, I did be very hungry that time, and indeed to be alway so,\r\nfor the tablets did be very unfilling to the belly, as you do well know\r\nfrom my tellings. And when that I did be finished, I saw that the Maid\r\nlookt at me somewise oddways, and sudden she to come into laughter, and\r\naskt me whether that I did be very empty; and in the same moment there\r\nto be a wondrous dear look within her eyes; so that I perceived that\r\nthere went a mother-note under her impudence.\r\n\r\nAnd she to yearn, as I could know, that she have some way to feed me;\r\nbut truly there did be no way, for we thought not to make to slay aught\r\nfor our purpose, and we did be feared that we eat any root or plant,\r\nlest that we be ill. And this to seem strange to my spirit of this our\r\nage, but to be natural unto that; so that I do think I did be so long\r\nbred from the primal obtaining of food, that I did be all lost to that\r\nwhich should seem natural unto the peoples of this early age of the\r\nworld; though we truly to think that the world doth even now be old; and\r\nthis to have seemed a true thing unto every age that ever did live.\r\n\r\nNow, beside that we did lack somewise to think serious that we slay\r\nsomething to eat, in that the tablets did actually suffice to our\r\nstrength, I to believe that there did be some other reason that I do\r\nforget, and mayhap never to have thought plain upon; but which to be set\r\nwithin me as an instinct, as we do say; and this to mean, if that I try\r\nto set it in other words, that the tablets did keep the body and the\r\nspirit in such condition that the Forces of Evil did have the less power\r\nto act upon us.\r\n\r\nYet, have I no remembering that I was taught in the preparation that I\r\neat naught, save the tablets; and this mayhap never to have been set\r\nupon me; but to have been as a thing that doth never need to have been\r\ntold; even as you shall not tell a grown man in this Age that he shall\r\nrefrain from dung, and eat only wholesome matter.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, I to hope that I have made this thing somewise clear unto\r\nyou; for, indeed, it doth be something hard to set out; for every Age\r\nhath the subtleties peculiar to that Age; and these to be hard to the\r\nunderstanding of other Ages, but yet to seem plain and utter natural,\r\neven without thought, unto the Peoples of the Age.\r\n\r\nAnd surely all this to be plain to you, and to be over-plain; for, in\r\nverity, I tell to you, and over-tell, until that I should be weary; and\r\nmayhap you to be the more so. And, indeed, I not to blame you; but only\r\nto hope that your understanding, which doth mean also in general your\r\nhearts, doth be with me all along my way. And, indeed, this my tale to\r\nbe not easy told.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I to be back now unto the Maid a-laugh upon me, and in\r\nthe same moment deeply loving and a-lack that she could not feed me, and\r\nI to laugh with her, and to have understanding with her, as you to know;\r\nand, indeed, I to have an heart that doth be made someways natural unto\r\nunderstanding; so that even though I be dead when you read this, my\r\ntale, you to feel that we be friends, and to know that could I meet with\r\nyou in pitiful trouble, I to have understanding and love to you, if that\r\nyou be not utter brutish; and even-so, I to be sorrowful that you should\r\nbe brutish, and to have understanding, in that I to know that by\r\ndevelopement you to become wise unto sweetness and charity, and in love\r\nwith all dear things, and kind pity of the rest. And thiswise you to be\r\nin human sympathy with me, because that you do feel that I be honest\r\nwith you, and somewise even now to your elbow, as you read. And this to\r\nbe writ now, and you mayhap not to be born a great while yet; but in the\r\nend to read and to have understanding with me, and to know how I did\r\nlove Mine Own. And so we to go forward again, the closer, in that we do\r\nbe the more knit in dear human sympathy.\r\n\r\nAnd surely the Maid kist me very nice on the lips, and did promise again\r\nhow that she should make me a great meal when that we did come to our\r\nMighty Home; and, indeed, as she to say, she to join with me, and we\r\nboth to be naughty gluttons for that once. And, surely, I laughed gently\r\nat the Maid, because that she should be so dainty a glutton; but for my\r\npart, I to feel that I could eat an horse, as we do say in this Age.\r\n\r\nAnd by that we had eat and drunk and talked awhile, and lookt oft about,\r\nso that we know that no brutish thing came near, to our hurt, the Maid\r\nto tell me that my garments did be dry; and she then to give me aid that\r\nI dress very quick; and afterward she to help me with mine armour, the\r\nwhich she did wipe after that we had eat and drunk; and she to have had\r\njoy that she do this thing, and all things for me; and to have used a\r\npart of her torn garments to this end.\r\n\r\nAnd so, truly, I to be clothed and armed very speedy, and to feel eased\r\nand the more sure in my mind; for in verity, I was alway in unease, when\r\nthat I did not be ready that I be able to meet any horrid Brute that\r\nshould be like to come upon us.\r\n\r\nNow, when that I did be into mine armour again, the Maid to set the\r\nscrip and the pouch upon me, and all the while I scarce to be loosed of\r\nthe Diskos, as ever. And we then to our way, which did be that we find a\r\nplace proper to our slumber.\r\n\r\nAnd when that we did be gone all-ways, and no cave proper to our sight,\r\nwe found a great tree, that did be set off alone, and had a plenty of\r\nbranches; but none that did be near to the bottom-part.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I gave the Maid a lift, and held her up so far as mine arms\r\ndid go, so that she might stand upon the palms of my hands, and be\r\nsteady against the trunk of the tree; and she thiswise to have a hold\r\nupon a branch, and so to go upward.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, when that she was safe, I loosed one of the straps from the\r\npouch and the scrip, and I cast this up to the Maid, and she set it\r\nstrong about the branch. And when I had caught the downward end, I went\r\nupward very easy; and afterward took loose the strap; and this way we\r\ndid be something safe, as you shall see.\r\n\r\nAnd we climbed upward then, and so came to a part of the tree where the\r\nbranches did be very thick together; and we made here a place for our\r\nslumber, and the Maid set the cloak over the branches that did be so\r\nclose, and afterward we lay down; but first I set the strap about her\r\nwaist, and thence to a branch, and she to refuse sleep until that I be\r\nlikewise; so that we did be both very safe from any fall.\r\n\r\nAnd she kist me, and we then to our slumber, and very weary; for it did\r\nbe two and twenty hours, by this, since that we had sleep.\r\n\r\nNow we had eight hours in which we slept utter; and we both to awake, as\r\nit did seem in the same moment; but truly, I to think that Mine Own did\r\nbe wakeful before that time; for, indeed, as she put her arms very\r\ndainty about my neck, that she kiss me, I did have a quick and sudden\r\nknowledge that I had been kist oft in my sleep, and this to have been\r\nbut a little while gone. And surely, it did seem to me that Mine Own did\r\nhave a sweet and contented Mischief inward of her eyes; but yet she to\r\nbe very sedate outward, and to kiss me loving and dear, and then we to\r\nour breakfast, upon the cloak.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I climbed to the topmost branches of the tree, and lookt\r\nwell over the Country all about; but there was no brutish thing to my\r\nsight in any place, neither near nor far.\r\n\r\nAnd I came down then to the Maid, and told her how that there was\r\nquietness of life all about. And we had our gear together, and went\r\ndownward to the earth, and I to help Mine Own, and this way she to be\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nNow, as we went forward upon our journeying, I perceived that the Maid\r\nhad a wayward air; and truly, I thought that she did have her heart all\r\nset toward naughtiness and mischief; and in the same moment that I was\r\nin this belief, I did know in mine understanding that this did spring\r\nfrom the workings of my nature upon the nature of Mine Own Maiden.\r\n\r\nAnd Naani to walk, in the first, beside me, and to have no word for me,\r\nbecause that she did be so filled with the stirrings of her naughtiness,\r\nthat did be in the same moment very sweet unto me, and yet to waken all\r\nthat did be masterful within me. And she to be that she did know, and\r\nto delight, in her secret heart that she waken that which did be\r\nmasterful in me; but yet in the same moment to be strong determined that\r\nshe be not mastered by me. And surely this to seem contrarywise in the\r\nwords; but to be clear to the heart, if indeed you have ever been loved\r\nby a dear maid of an high spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd above all this, the Maid did be filled with a love for me, that did\r\nbeat and dance in all her being; and this in truth to overweigh all; but\r\nyet from this same thing her dainty naughtiness to be born, because, as\r\nI did say, my manhood to stir all her nature up-wise in sweet trouble\r\nthat did be half of rebellion, and half that she did ache that she be\r\nclose unto me in mine arms.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, you to be with me in all these things, if that you have\r\nhad the love-days beside a dear and dainty maid, of an high and pure and\r\nnatural spirit; so that if you be old these days, even but the light\r\nmerriment of a passing maiden to bring a pain of wonderings and golden\r\nmemories upon your heart.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I saw that Mine Own put a little space between us, as the\r\nnaughtiness did work in her, as my heart to know; and she to be offward\r\nfrom me a little. And she still to have no speech with me; but in a\r\nlittle to begin that she sing in a low voice; and to have her pretty\r\nbody very upright and lithesome, and to go forward with a wondrous\r\ndainty swing, so that my heart told me that she did all be stirred with\r\nsmall thrillings of defiance unto me, and with thrillings of love; and\r\nshe to have the triumph of her Maidenhood and of her Womanhood, as it\r\nwere both to contend in her and to thrill upon her tongue, and to show\r\nout the lilting and pretty warfare of her spirit that did go dancing and\r\ndearly naughty in her breast.\r\n\r\nAnd surely I went, very lifted in my heart, and astir; for it did be\r\nwondrous to me that this lovely Maid did be so utter mine. And to see\r\nbut the way that she set her feet to the earth, and the way that she did\r\nlift them sure and dainty; and the way that her body did be poised, and\r\nthe way of her head; and the way of her naughtiness and the sweetness\r\nand the love that did be wrapt in with all, did make me want that I have\r\nher in mine arms.\r\n\r\nBut yet, I not to do this, because that in the same time that she did so\r\nstir me to love and admirings, she to set somewhat else in me at\r\nvariance, so that I did half to feel stern with her, for I perceived\r\nthat she had that naughtiness then within her, that she did be like to\r\nhave a real intent of impertinence unto me, so that she should be\r\nnaughtily outrageous, and to have no heed to my advisings, neither unto\r\nmy desires, unless that I set my hand upon her, to _make_ her to obey.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, you that have had dear maids, shall follow mine explainings;\r\nbut unto others, I know not whether they shall understand, until they\r\ntoo have been possessed of One that shall set all their heart adrift,\r\neven as this One that did be Mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden, I to know that Naani did change from her low singing unto an\r\nolden air that had surely not been heard in all that eternity. And in\r\nverity, for a little while, I not to know why that it did so shake all\r\nmy heart; nor what it did be; nor whether that I had truly heard it\r\nbefore, or only to think so.\r\n\r\nAnd, surely, it did be as that the silence of the olden moonlit world\r\ndid steal all about me; and sudden, I to know that the Maid did sing an\r\nolden love-song of the olden world, and to go halting a little as she\r\nsang, because that the words did steal something odd-wise through the\r\nfar veils of her memory, even as a song doth come backward out of\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nAnd I to feel all my blood to seem to tremble in my veins, and my throat\r\nto be troubled, as with vague sobs that did be the ghosts of forgotten\r\ntears. And the dim sorrow that had come so swift and strange upon me, to\r\nbe likewise steeped in golden mists of the love that I once did love;\r\nand the glamour to be come all fresh upon me, and I to know in that\r\nmoment how much we do forget, even when that we do believe that we have\r\nall memory and all sorrow within our hearts.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt unto the Maid, something dimly, because of the way that I\r\ndid be; and I perceived in a moment that Mine Own did weep as she\r\nwalked; but the less with pain than with the strange anguish of Memory,\r\nthat doth have in it Tenderness and Sorrow and Love and all that Hath\r\nBeen and all that Did Never Be, and all to make a Vale unto the Spirit,\r\nwhere doth be both a dim greyness and a warm and everlasting light, and\r\nan utter speechlessness, and the low and far music of forgotten songs,\r\nthat do come downward over the shadowy mountains that do be builded of\r\nYears and Forgetfulness, and yet made to be seen with the light of that\r\nour Memory, which doth cast so many husht shadows.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, as I did say, the Maid did weep as she went; but not to be\r\ncast down; but rather that she held her head upwise, as that she did\r\nwalk in a glory. And the song to come oft-broke, and oddly, and to set\r\nher voice to little human quiverings, as her memory did shake her sweet\r\nspirit unto tears afresh; and she to walk with her pretty head upheld\r\nand as that she did go in a Triumph; and the tears to come down\r\nstrangely upon her face, and all her soul to be there, pure and\r\nwondrous, and in the same time both troubled and glad.\r\n\r\nAnd this thing to be very dear and amazing; and she to be as that she\r\nnot to know then that she sang; but as that she did be lost in her\r\nthoughts, as we do say, and this to have come sudden upon her, out of\r\nall her upliftedness of spirit, that had been like to make her very open\r\nunto all subtile and subtle powers of thought and inward stirrings, as\r\nyou shall think.\r\n\r\nAnd again the song to come full-remembered, and fresh, as that this\r\nEternity did be but the yesterday of that moment. And Mine Own to be\r\nall in a sweet madness with those half-dreamed memories, and the wonder\r\nand pain of all that no man hath ever said, and that shall be never\r\nsaid; and of the utter lost years, and all that hath been lost, and all\r\nforgotten greatness and splendour, and the dreadfulness of parting, and\r\nthe loveliness of beautiful things that do be hid in the abyss of the\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAnd it did be sudden to my quickened fancy, that there did be low echoes\r\nall about us, of the voices of dear beautiful ones that have died; for\r\nso did memory set a strange and lovely mystery about my spirit in that\r\nmoment, that I did be all shaken so much as Mine Own. And I to be as\r\nthat I drew my breath anigh to tears, and did be there with Naani amid\r\nthe quiet spareness of the trees and the rock of that part of the land;\r\nbut yet did be to see half dimly that I stood within a light, even as\r\nthe light that doth be the wonder of olden sunsets; and I to be, in the\r\nsame time, both _that_ man and _this_ man that now doth write; and to\r\nhave beside my spirit but one maid, that I did lack to know whether I\r\nsay to her Naani or Mirdath; for though the two that have been Mine Own\r\ndid be different-seeming to the eye, there to be but the spirit of one\r\nmaid beside me in that moment.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I did be there, all shaken unto the seeing of visions, as it\r\ndid seem; so that the Land about me to have grown half as that it did\r\nlack that it be real unto my sight, because that I lookt inward unto\r\nLands that did be of Memory. And lo! in a moment this to go; and I to be\r\nin that Country of the Seas, and to look newly unto Naani, and she to go\r\nas I have told; and there to be the lonesome trees and the rocks in all\r\nparts for a great way about.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden, as I lookt at Mine Own, she to come round unto me, and she\r\nheld out her arms, and did gaze at me with such a love, as that she were\r\ntransfigured, and to need strangely that she be in mine arms; and\r\nsurely, I to an holy need that I have her unto me, because that, after\r\nall, there did be no wonder so great as that wonder, that when all did\r\nbe said I did have Mine Own, after that all Eternity had nigh past.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, we ran each to the other, and did be silent, because\r\nthat there was no speech of words by which we could say aught of all\r\nthat did be in our hearts. And truly you to be with me in understanding;\r\nfor you too, mayhap, to have suffered thiswise of dumbness; even if that\r\nit hath not been so great. But yet to make you to know.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, we grew quiet in the spirit; and Mine Own to come back\r\nagain to her joyousness, and to go beside by me, as we made forward.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, Naani to begin that she look at me with dear impudences\r\nagain, that did be very sweet unto me; but yet to be like to lead unto\r\ndefyings.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, by these things shall you know the spirit of Mine Own Maid;\r\nand there to be none to me that ever did be like her. But, indeed, you\r\nto think thatwise of the maid that you did love; and all the world to be\r\nthinking each these thoughts of one dear maiden that doth be the one\r\nmaid in all the round world.\r\n\r\nAnd this to be the lovely niceness of the human heart; and I not to have\r\nany grumble thereat; but yet, surely, you shall say that this Maid that\r\ndid be Mine Own, did be very dear and lovely. And, in verity, I to show\r\nmy human heart in this thing; for you likewise to want that I think your\r\nMaid to have been just so dear, and the more so. And indeed we ever to\r\nbe going these ways; and to have good comradeship of understanding,\r\nbecause that we have all loved and suffered joy and had utter belief in\r\na dear One.\r\n\r\nAnd surely a defyingness to come presently into the way that the Maid\r\ndid go, and she to walk a little offward from me; and truly I lookt at\r\nher, both with love and yet with somewhat that did be to reprove her\r\ngently, and all in the same moment that she to make my heart stirred\r\nwith her sweet naughtiness.\r\n\r\nAnd she to look sudden at me; and to be that she half to intend to run\r\nto kiss me; but also that she be minded in the same moment that she set\r\nherself up impertinently against me. And, in verity, she made me to\r\nharden my nature a little, as manhood doth make a man to do; and this\r\nbecause of the rebellion that I knew to be in her; and she likewise to\r\nknow. But she hid her eyes, when that I shook my head, half with play\r\nand half with earnest; and was then impudent unto me; and gone from that\r\nin a moment to her pretty singing, and her naughty walking apart. But\r\nshe no more to sing an olden love-song.\r\n\r\nNow, in a while, we past a basin of rock, in a place among the trees;\r\nand there was a warm spring bubbling in the rock, and the basin to be\r\nfull of water, very warm and with some smelling of chemistry.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid told me that she would wash, and I to think it a good place\r\nfor that end. And when I had tasted the water, I found that it did seem\r\nsmooth and proper for our intent, as that there did be a verity of an\r\nalkali in it.\r\n\r\nAnd truly we washed, and after that I was done, the Maid bid me that I\r\nturn my back; and I to do this, and she to mock me very naughty whilst\r\nthat I could not see her, and to seem very quiet; for indeed, I heard no\r\nsplashings of water, though I stood off from her a long while, and she\r\nalway to say naughty things unto me, as that she did mind truly to have\r\nme angered; for, indeed, she did have a plain intent that she mock at\r\nme, and to ease not her wit. And surely, after that I had stood a great\r\nwhile, I askt the Maid when that she did be like to be done; but she to\r\nsay that she was nowise ended of her toilets. And I knew very sudden\r\nthat she made foolishness upon me also in this matter; and I turned\r\nupon her, and lo! she did be sitting upon a little rock, very sedate,\r\neven as when she had bid me turn from her; and to have made no more\r\nforward, but only to have been there at ease, that she keep me turned\r\naway to please her naughty mood, and all the while have a double liberty\r\nto have impudence upon me.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I did be a little angered; but scarce that I did know\r\nit; for I did love her very great, and was stirred inwardly with her\r\ndearness and that she did look just that-wise that I knew not whether I\r\nto need to kiss her, or to shake her; and truly, how should I know; for\r\nmy heart did ache that I have her to mine arms; but my brain to say that\r\nshe did go over-far in the joke; and truly you to see that I did not be\r\nunreasonable, neither to be lacking of grace; for indeed I do think that\r\nI was swayed all-ways, because that I saw all the dear way that her\r\npretty nature did work; and to conceive of her mood and to understand\r\nand be stirred; but yet to shape a little in my manhood unto hardening,\r\nand in my judgement unto sternness.\r\n\r\nYet, truly, I scolded Mine Own with no more than a little jesting, and\r\ndid be nice and gentle with her, because she did be so dear, and I to\r\nknow just-wise her mood and the cause and working of it.\r\n\r\nAnd I told her that I did love her, and that she hasten now and let us\r\nagain to the journey. But, indeed, she only to make a face at me, so\r\nthat I did be near like to shake her unto sedateness. And she then to be\r\nboth merry, and a rogue, as we do say, and to stop her ears and again to\r\nsing very gleeful; and all so that she might not hear aught that I said.\r\nAnd surely she lookt a very dainty Rebellious One.\r\n\r\nAnd I went then straightway to her, and took her hands from her ears;\r\nand I kist her pretty ears very gentle that I not to deafen her. And I\r\nkist her lips as she did sing; and afterward shook her, that she be not\r\nsuch a sweet Torment. But this to have no success that way; for she only\r\nto put out her toes to be kist; for her foot-gear was off from her feet.\r\nAnd, indeed, I laughed, even as I made to frown; and truly I kist her\r\npretty toes, and tried then to coax her to go forward something speedy\r\nwith her hair, and to be ready to the journey. But she only to sing, and\r\nto refuse to be sedate.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, in the end, I caught her up in mine arms, and had her\r\nbundle in my hand, and so went off with her very sudden, with her hair\r\nall loose upon me in a lovely and soft shining, and her feet bare as\r\nthey did be.\r\n\r\nAnd this action I made, because that I was grown truly a little stern\r\nwith Mine Own; for, indeed, she did half to need that she be whipt unto\r\nproperness, as you shall think, that have seen how she did be thiswise\r\nonly because that her nature did be stirred strangely, and her Womanhood\r\nand her Maidenhood to be all unto war, and in part to make a rebellion\r\nagainst me that she did know glad to be her true Master; but yet she to\r\nbe thus, even though she did be so glad.\r\n\r\nAnd this to act so that she did be in the same moment both sweet and\r\nwise and yet to show a dainty foolishness and a true naughtiness that\r\ndid make me to feel somewhat of a real anger; but yet did have me to\r\nknow that all my being did be stirred by her; so that I did think with\r\none thought that she did be very foolish, and with another that she did\r\nbe lovely wayward.\r\n\r\nNow, when that I took the Maid up so quick, and made off with her, she\r\nto give a little gasp and to submit to me with a quick humbleness; but\r\nimmediately, she to regain her courage, and to be outraged of me. But,\r\nindeed, I took no heed, only that I was like to shake her; and did know\r\nalso that her hair did be wondrous pretty upon mine armour. And she soon\r\nto lie very quiet and easy in mine arms, and to be demure.\r\n\r\nAnd I to have a half knowledge of somewhat amiss; but yet to have no\r\nsureness, neither to think much upon this vague feeling.\r\n\r\nAnd when that I had gone a good mile, she to put up her lips to be kist;\r\nand I to kiss her very loving, for she was so dear. And she then to say,\r\nvery ordinary like, that I should do wisely now if that I went back for\r\nher foot-gear, which truly I had lacked thought to notice, when that I\r\ndid pick up the Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw that she had known this thing all that while, and had made\r\nthat mile of carrying all a waste and a foolishness, because of the\r\nnaughty rebellion which did be in her. And lo! I set her instant to the\r\nground; and she gave out a little cry as she saw that I did be gone\r\nsomewise hard and stern with her.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed I pulled a small branch from a tree that did be near, to be\r\nfor a switch as you shall whip a boy with; and I held her with my left\r\nhand, and in verity I laid the switch thrice very sharp across her\r\npretty shoulders, that she know all that she did need to know. And she\r\nseeming to be ceased in a moment from her perverseness, and did nestle\r\nvery quick unto me, that had whipt her; and did need that she be\r\nwondrous nigh unto me. And, truly, how shall even a young man flog such\r\nan one.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid to be very husht against mine armour, and to resist that I\r\nlook into her face that did be prest so anigh me. But presently, I used\r\na little and gentle force, and so to look into her face something\r\nsudden. And truly, that One did be smiling very naughty and dainty to\r\nherself; so that I perceived that I had not truly whipt her enough; but\r\nyet I could harden my heart no more at that time; for, in verity, there\r\ndoth be a strange half-pain in the bosom, if that you have to flog a\r\nmaid that doth be utter thine, and this to the despite that there hath\r\nbeen--as then--no properness of anger to have for an after\r\nself-reproach.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I to have done this thing only of a stern intent and\r\nsteadfastness, that I steady Mine Own Maid unto wisdom; but yet to have\r\nbeen helpt by a little anger, because of the thing that she had done.\r\nYet, alway, my love did be so strong, that mine anger never to have\r\naught of bitterness, as you shall have seen, and to understand.\r\n\r\nAnd we went back then for the foot-gear of the Maid; and she to be very\r\nhusht in mine arms; but yet, as I perceived, not to be quiet, of an\r\nhumble little heart, but only of the chance that her nature did be\r\nstirred that way for the while.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, when we were gone back, the foot-gear did be there to the\r\nside of the pool, and the Maid gat shod very speedy, and would have no\r\naid; and afterward did up her hair very tight upon her head, to have it\r\nutter from my sight; and this to be for a perverseness; for she knew\r\nthat I did love to see it pretty upon her shoulders, or if that she must\r\ndo it, that she do it up very loose and nice; and truly you to know how\r\nI mean; only that I have no skill of such matters; but yet a good taste\r\nto admirings, if that the thing be aright.\r\n\r\nAnd I to say nothing, as I looked at her; and she presently to make a\r\nquick glance unto me, to see why I did say naught. And I shook my head,\r\nsmiling at her waywardness; but she to look away from me, and to seem to\r\nbe set to fresh naughtiness.\r\n\r\nNow we went forward then upon our journey; and alway the Maid to walk\r\nonward from me; but yet to have no other impudence, neither to sing.\r\n\r\nAnd I to go kindly with her; but yet to think that she did lack somewhat\r\nto know that I did be truly her Master; and I to wonder a little whether\r\nshe did know proper that my gentleness with her did be not of weakness,\r\nbut born of understanding and love, and the more proof that I did be fit\r\nto possess and to guide her.\r\n\r\nAnd truly this was the thought of a young man, yet lacking not of Reason\r\nin the bottom part, though mayhap to be something clumsy-seeming unto\r\nthe mind of a maid; and to be very human to my years; and you to have\r\nbeen likewise, if that you have tried all-ways with a dear One, and she\r\nto be yet over-wilful, so that you to wonder whether she did truly know\r\nhow you did understand.\r\n\r\nAnd surely a maid doth know much that doth be in the heart of a man, if\r\nthat she be true woman in her own secret heart. And oft she doth know\r\nmore of her man than her man doth wot of himself, and to go her own\r\ndiverse ways that she search out and bring forth and waken all that is\r\nthe inward being of the man that she doth love.\r\n\r\nYet, when that she have stirred you in the deeps that you scarce to\r\nknow, she to be all fearful, and in the same moment to have no fear; and\r\nto be in rebellion, and in the same moment to be most strange humble.\r\nAnd all to be born of love, and nature in action upon nature.\r\n\r\nAnd more than this how shall I have learning of the heart to tell you;\r\nfor, in verity, there doth be much in these few lines, if that you know\r\nto read. And surely you to know, or to learn; but if neither, then have\r\nyou gone short of joy and the true inwardness of life.\r\n\r\nNow this way I did be, as I have told; and the Maid to be quietly\r\nnaughty in perverseness, as also I have set out; yet to have a strict\r\nmind to her duties, and to go now wondrous sedate upon the journey; yet\r\nalway apart. And likewise, when that the sixth hour did come, and we to\r\nour halt, as ever, she to be very speedy and nice that the water and the\r\ntablets be ready for me; but yet to have no word; neither to eat by me;\r\nbut again a little apart, and not to share the water, but to make a\r\nbrewing to herself, when that I had done.\r\n\r\nAnd likewise, the Maid held not up her tablets to be kist, as alway; but\r\neat them, quiet and meditative, and with little nibblings, as that she\r\ndid ponder upon other matters, or mayhap to be not hungry.\r\n\r\nAnd these things I saw, as we eat and drank in a silence; and I to look\r\nat the Maid, somewise sad in the heart, and something stirred; and I to\r\nsay to myself wisely, yet as a young man, that she did not yet be taught\r\nsufficient that I was her master. And this you to perceive.\r\n\r\nAnd she never to seem to look at me; but to be quiet and demure, and to\r\nhave her eyelids something down upon her eyes.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, as I thought upon the matter, I saw that I do well that\r\nI take no heed of Mine Own; but to let her to come to a natural end of\r\nthis naughtiness, that did be, in the same time, both pretty and a\r\nlittle foolish; so that in half I condemned it and in half I was\r\nstirred; and alway I loved the Maid very dear, and had a good\r\nunderstanding; and there to be also an interest in my heart at this new\r\nside that she did be showing. And also, she to stir me odd whiles unto\r\nmasterfulness; and so you to know pretty well how it did be with me in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nNow, surely, I found this plan, that I attend not to the Maid, to have\r\nsomething of success; for I knew presently that she did look upward at\r\nme, slyly, from under her pretty eyelashes; and after, to be demure in a\r\nmoment; and this to go forward for a while; yet I to show no heed.\r\n\r\nAnd in a while, I saw that she gave attention to her garments, in the\r\nway of nattiness; and afterward, she took down her hair, and made it up\r\nthen very loose and pretty upon her head; so that she did be very\r\nlovely, and to tempt mine eyes that they look alway at her. But, indeed,\r\nI did make as that I had no heed that the Maid did shape her hair\r\ndifferent upon her head.\r\n\r\nAnd she very soon then to speak, and to have the lesser gear together,\r\nand to make that she attract me. But truly, I was very nice with her;\r\nyet to keep her now a little off from me in the spirit; and so to teach\r\nher that-wise, that she was somewhat of a dear naughty maid; but also,\r\nas I do think, I was this way, because that in part I would tease her,\r\nin great love of her prettiness and her makings up to me; and so maybe\r\neven that I make her to be the more defying of me. And this to be as\r\nthat I also lacked somewhat of reason; for I did strangely that I think\r\nthat she need to be whipt, and in the same time that I go to make her\r\nthe more deserving of the same.\r\n\r\nYet, this to be the truth, as I know it; and surely to be the natural\r\nwaywardness of love. But yet, there did be also in the backward part of\r\nmy wisdom, an intent that I be wise and careful with Mine Own; and I\r\nsurely to have no full realisings that I did be like to set her further\r\nunto perverseness than yet she did be.\r\n\r\nNow, after that I had shown well that I lacked to heed the Maid, I found\r\nthat I did be looking oft at her; and she to be so dear and pretty, and\r\nto be all husht, that truly I could not bear that I be longer silent to\r\nher advancements.\r\n\r\nAnd I ceased then from pretending, and would have had her into mine\r\narms; but she to be now in sweet dignity, and to keep me off with very\r\nsober graces. And because of this, I to feel someway that I did be\r\nsomeway in blame; and surely, now that I consider it, I can see that I\r\nwas something acted upon, even as had been the Maid; and so we two to\r\nbe; and a most human pair, as you to say; and somewhat both a-lack; but\r\nindeed, we did be very wholesome, and in utter love each of the other;\r\nand mayhap both then to perceive something of the sweet foolishness\r\nwithin us that did be as yeast a-work in us; for I thought that Naani\r\ndid smile a little to herself. But, surely, this clear-seeing, to be but\r\nfor an odd time; and afterward we each again to earnestness in our way\r\nwith the other; but alway, even when we did make to show indifference,\r\nwe to be something troubled inwardly with sweet flashings of our\r\nbewildered natures.\r\n\r\nNow, though I have shown you that I to know that I did be not utter free\r\nof this most strange and natural foolishness; yet you to perceive that I\r\ntell this only that I have utter truth of all things that did happen;\r\nfor, in verity, because that I was something subtly touched this way at\r\nwhiles, yet was this no full excusing of the Maid; though, in the same\r\nmoment, you to perceive, that there did be only the half of me to think\r\nthat she did need to be excused; for, in truth, mine understanding went\r\nalway, in the main, with the workings of her nature; and had a natural\r\nsympathy with her dear whimsies; but also, as you to know, I to be\r\nstirred constant in my manhood by her naughty defyings; and to be\r\ntroubled in my Natural Sense, when that her whimsies made her to act\r\nthat she be likely to come unto aught of harm.\r\n\r\nAnd surely now you to see all the way of my heart, and to have\r\nunderstanding in things that do follow. And alway you shall mind that I\r\ndid love her utter, and to crave alway that I be a shield unto her;\r\nthough truly, there doth be, mayhap, somewhat in me that doth act to\r\nmake me a little stern seeming in my love; but yet not oft so; as you do\r\nknow, that have gone with me in all my tellings.\r\n\r\nNow, we went then upon our journey; and the Maid to be somewhat before\r\nme, and offward to the side, upon my right; and to have no speech with\r\nme, but to make a good pace, and to be very dear and graceful as she\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nAnd now we did pass this thing of strangeness, and now that; and these I\r\ndid point out to her, and made some telling concerning the same, having\r\nthe memory of mine outward way, and how that I did see these things\r\nthen, when that I was all in suffering of so lonesome a doubt.\r\n\r\nAnd she to hark alway very intent, and to move her head nice and\r\nintelligent, to show that she heard me; and once I saw that she lookt\r\nsudden at me with a dear light in her eyes; but this to be done in a\r\nmoment, and she to be again silent-seeming and in her new perversity of\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nAnd surely she did seem so utter sweet in this new way of naughtiness;\r\nbut yet I did think, odd whiles, that I should like to shake her unto\r\ndear humbleness and her usual way.\r\n\r\nAnd in the twelfth hour, we made halt again, and had our food and our\r\ndrink; and the Maid to serve me very clever and quiet, as that I did be\r\nher Lord, and she an husht slave. And I saw that she made a constant and\r\nnaughty mock upon me; and truly, as I did half think, she to need that\r\nshe be in care that I not treat her sternly, as shall a slave-master,\r\nand to give her that which she did ask for so mute and impudent. But\r\nalway she did stir me mightily to have her to mine arms, and to love her\r\nvery dear.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, we did be again to our way; and to be yet silent; so that\r\nI scarce knew whether to have patience with Mine Own, or whether that I\r\ntake her and speak seriously with her to cease this play, which did\r\nbegin a little to dispirit me somewhat strangely.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end I went over to her, as we did walk, and I put mine arm\r\nabout her, and she to yield to me without word, and to hark very quiet\r\nto my speech of reasoning and gentle sayings, and to hide whether she\r\ndid be stirred inwardly, or not; though, indeed, my spirit to know that\r\nher spirit did never be afar off from mine in all deep matters; but only\r\nthis thing to be to the top, and to set somewhat between us that did be\r\nboth a sweetness and a trouble.\r\n\r\nAnd alway, as I talked with the Maid, I saw that she did make naughtily\r\nto act as that I did be a slave-master, and she but a chattel to me; for\r\nshe to be husht before me, and neither to yield her slender body willing\r\nto mine arm, nor to resist me; but only to be still, as that she had no\r\nsaying in this matter; and as that I was like to beat her at my\r\npleasure, or to withhold my hand, all as might chance to be my desire.\r\nAnd this I perceived was the shaping of her actions, so that all her\r\ndumbness and her quiet obedience did be but a way to say this thing to\r\nme; and all to have come from her love of me and that she did be shaken\r\nin her nature by my manhood, and so to be but a new form of her\r\nnaughtiness, that did have this change when that I whipt her.\r\n\r\nAnd all this, you to perceive, that have gone with me.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw that she would not cease from this perverseness, but made a\r\ndumb and naughty and hidden mock upon me, very dainty and constant, and\r\nscarce to be truly perceived, save by the inward sense. And truly, I\r\ngrew something angered afresh, and to feel that she did need that she be\r\nshaken so stern that she come unto the reality that I did be her man and\r\nnatural master; yet alway in love.\r\n\r\nAnd surely I loosed her then, and went off a pace to her side; and we\r\nagain to go forward thiswise; yet she soon to have a greater distance\r\nbetween us, which she made very quiet and natural; but, indeed, I saw\r\nwhat she did.\r\n\r\nNow, about the fourteenth hour of that journeying, I saw before us, in\r\nthe far distance, the rock upon which did be the olden flying ship, that\r\nyou shall remember. And presently, as we came more nigh, I lookt oft to\r\nMine Own; and I saw that she did be staring that way, and to be in\r\nwonder; but yet to say naught to me.\r\n\r\nAnd soon, as we came very close, I did want that I tell her about the\r\nship, and of mine adventuring there, and of the wonder of that olden\r\nship, set there through Eternity.\r\n\r\nBut in the first, I hesitated, as you shall think, because of her way;\r\nbut truly, my heart knew that her heart did be proper unto me; and,\r\nmoreover, I should be small in my nature, if that I let any pettiness\r\nput a silence upon me; though, in verity, if that the Maid had not been\r\ninwardly loving to me, I had been that I had told her no word; and this\r\nto be very natural, whether it be of smallness or not.\r\n\r\nAnd when that we were come beside the great uprising rock, I made halt,\r\nand the Maid to halt with me; and I showed her how that the thing upon\r\nthe rock did be an olden flying ship from the Mighty Pyramid. And in the\r\nfirst, she askt no questions; but did be quiet and but to show with\r\nlittle noddings that she did be greatly interest.\r\n\r\nAnd I to show to her how that this olden ship did be there mayhap an\r\nhundred thousand years; and to have been there, as it did seem to us\r\n(that were of that age) since the beginnings of the world; though, in\r\nverity, our two spirits did know that the beginnings of That Age, did be\r\ntruly the ending of This, as you also to know.\r\n\r\nAnd much I told Mine Own, and afterward concerning the two Humpt Men\r\nthat did come after me; and she alway to be silent, until that I spoke\r\nof the fight; but then to come round upon me very swift, and with a dear\r\nlight in her eyes; and had askt, before she did wot, whether they did\r\nhurt me.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, this to have been the first thing of her olden sweet\r\nnaturalness that she did say for a great while, and I to be so in\r\ndelight, that I had her into mine arms, and kist her very loving, all\r\nin a moment, and she to submit with a nice gladness, and to nestle unto\r\nme, and all unwitting that she did be gone from her waywardness.\r\n\r\nYet, in verity, she did be a naughty Maid; for she minded in an instant\r\nthat she did forget her pose unto me; and lo, her lips did be no more to\r\nsearch unto mine, but to be as that they did be kist only of my will,\r\nand she to have no more live nestling unto me, but only to be quiet in\r\nmine arms. And I lookt into her face, and her lids to be down somewhat\r\nover her pretty eyes, and she did look very husht and demure; so that\r\ntruly, I knew not whether to shake her or again to kiss her.\r\n\r\nBut in the end I loost her, and made then that we go forward; yet,\r\nindeed, she did rather stay awhile, to hark further concerning the olden\r\nship and of mine adventurings; but she did then to mind that she obey as\r\na slave shall obey; and truly, I did punish her, in that I told her no\r\nmore; but went forward at a good pace, and had some natural wonder how\r\nthat I deal with such a Maid, if that I spare to shake her.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I thought then again that I leave her be, and so to have her\r\npresently again to her old and natural way.\r\n\r\nNow, in a while, I lifted the Maid into mine arms, that I carry her, as\r\never, through the last part of each journey, and so to have her never\r\nover-tired for the morrow. And she for a moment to resist; but instantly\r\nto give unto me, and to lie quiet in mine arms, as that she had no\r\nsaying in aught that did be done, but must alway obey. And, indeed, you\r\nto see how dearly perverse she did be.\r\n\r\nAnd I went on then through four hours from that time, and lookt oft upon\r\nevery side, and walkt quietly; for truly we were come now into a part of\r\nthe Country where I did feel that there might be near some of the Humpt\r\nMen.\r\n\r\nBut I saw nowhere anything to put me in dread.\r\n\r\nAnd alway as we journeyed, there did seem a great stillness in all the\r\nCountry near about; and afar off the low mutter of the Great Fire-Hills,\r\nin this place and that, and a drowse as of life and warmth about us, and\r\neverywhere the air very rich and plentiful.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, when that we did be come down from that high place where\r\ndid be set the rock and the olden ship, we came in among the trees that\r\ncame very nigh to the shore for a great way; and oft as we did go, there\r\nwere clumpings of small fire-hills that did cast fire and noise; and oft\r\nthe roaring of monstrous springs a-boil; and then again the smell of the\r\nwoods about us, and oft still in odd places the low near sound of a\r\nlittle fire-hill, that did burn, lonesome, in some clear space of the\r\nwoods, in this place and that; and afterward we to be gone onward again\r\ninto the dull low mutter that did be in all the air of that Country, and\r\nthat did but make a seeming of silence, because that it did be so far\r\nand constant.\r\n\r\nNow, about the eighteenth hour I to note that the noise of the Great\r\nFire-Hills grew more loud; and I saw presently over the trees, afar\r\nupward in the great night and gloom that did lie above, those two mighty\r\nFire-Hills that I did feel to make the earth tremble, in that part, upon\r\nmine outward way. And surely I have told something of this before; and\r\nyou to remember, if that you but think a little moment.\r\n\r\nNow, it may appear strange that I speak thiswise of seeing the two Hills\r\nof fire; as that I had perceived them sudden. But, indeed, I had been\r\nlong abled to see them both, yet to have had no attention to them,\r\nbecause that they did be a great way off, and because they did be but\r\ntwo Hills of fire, in a Country that did be plentiful with such.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, I not to have said aught about them, only that our path did\r\ntake us now by their feet, and I to see them, as it were, newly; and to\r\nhave nice ease of heart to perceive how that they did be a wonder unto\r\nthe spirit and the brain for all time.\r\n\r\nFor it did be as that the earth had a constant shaking within miles of\r\nthem, and that a monstrous force of nature did be in that place. But yet\r\nthere to be no desolation around, as you should think; but in all parts\r\na wondrous growing of trees and great plants in abundance.\r\n\r\nAnd the trees to grow upward upon the shoulders of the mountain; and\r\nthere to be no falling of hot rocks and ash, as you to think; but all\r\nvery sweet and wholesome, as that the mighty valley made a chimney to\r\nthe mountain, and mayhap to others, so that their waste, if that they\r\nhad such, did go free. But, indeed, you shall take no heed of this\r\nexplaining, save as an odd thinking that hath come to me, and to be\r\nwithout foundation. And there to be no surety of the reason to this;\r\nonly that there did be no falling of ash in that part, as I do know. Yet\r\nin other parts of that Country the Fire-Hills did make new mountains of\r\nthe matter that did come from them; but this not to be alway so; and\r\nthere to seem to my knowledge no cause to order why this did not be\r\nconstant; save that my guessings to be right, or naught to be blown from\r\nsome. But, indeed, I to be sure only of that which did be plain to mine\r\neyes. And mayhap there to be no mystery in the thing; but a score of\r\nnatural explainings, if that I did know, or had patience to think long\r\nenough upon such.\r\n\r\nNow when that the eighteenth hour did be proper come, we to be anigh to\r\nthe great Hills, and there to seem nowise any danger of falling fire, so\r\nthat I sought about for a place for our slumber.\r\n\r\nAnd I found a cave in the side of a big rock; and the cave was dry and\r\ncomfortable, and had the mouth about a score feet above the earth. And\r\nwhen that I had climbed and lookt well into the cave, I gave the Maid an\r\nhelp, and had her safe into that place; and she then to prepare the\r\ntablets and the water, the while that I brought up a boulder from below,\r\nto set very light balanced in the mouth of the cave. And this I meant\r\nfor a signal to fall, if that any creature should climb upward into the\r\ncave, while that we did sleep. And surely, you to know this plan; for I\r\ndid it before, as you to have learned.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid sat near to me, and eat her tablets very quiet and with a\r\ndemure naughtiness; but yet to be also in wonder, and to gaze outward at\r\nthe Great Fire-Hills, and to be in awe, as I did know.\r\n\r\nAnd I put my half-anger and my play from me, and told her of mine\r\noutward journeying, and how I did go by these same mighty Fire-Hills,\r\nthat did seem as mighty torches to light me in my search, and to have\r\nheld a new strangeness and wonder over my path.\r\n\r\nAnd she still to be silent, but yet to look at me twice or thrice with a\r\nvery dear and loving way; though she did hide her eyes in a moment, when\r\nthat she saw that I perceived her.\r\n\r\nAnd soon the Maid spread the cloak for our sleep; and while that she did\r\nthis, I lookt well about for any creature that might be anigh; and I had\r\nan especial thought unto the Humpt Men; but, indeed, there was naught\r\nliving, unto my sight, and nowhere did I see anything to put me in fear\r\nfor our lives.\r\n\r\nAnd truly I had a great viewing from that place; for we did be in an\r\nupward rock that stood in a high part, and the cave to be twenty good\r\nfeet aloft, as I have told; so that all made to set us in a lofty place.\r\n\r\nAnd the cave to look toward the two Mountains that did rise upward no\r\nmore than twelve good miles off from us, as I do think; and the Country\r\nbetween to be somewise as a mighty park; for it was spread much about\r\nthe feet of the Great Fire-Hills, and did be bare in this place and\r\nthat, as that rock did make the earth naked there, or the falling of\r\nsome later fire to have wrought thus. And between the bare parts, there\r\nwent strange and romantic woods, seen mistily, and in parts the gleaming\r\nof waters, as that hot lakes did be half shown among the broken forests.\r\n\r\nAnd presently the Land did go upward with a monstrous sweep, and was\r\nthen in great terraces in the height, and trees to grow very plentiful\r\nupon the mountains, in sundry parts; and so those two Mighty Hills to go\r\nupward to meet the everlasting night; and presently to show strange\r\nuplands that did be seen very wondrous and queer in the light that did\r\nglow from the vast glowing of the fire that did be a crown upon the\r\nhills, that did seem in verity to be that they burned halfway between\r\nthat known world, and the lost olden world, that was mayhap two hundred\r\ngreat miles above in the everlasting night and eternity of darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt upward for awhile, and was much held by the mighty uplands\r\nthat did be on high; yet did lie utter far below the burning crests of\r\nthe Mountains, and showed vague and sombre and dreadful seeming, because\r\nthat they did be so lost upward, and to have the mystery of the red\r\nshining and of the shadows upon them, and to seem to slope far under the\r\ngreat fires, but yet to be a place where no life should ever come,\r\nbecause that they did be so monstrous a way upward beyond the great\r\nshoulders of the Hills, the which did be themselves a huge way up. And\r\ntruly, I should give you somewhat of the affecting of those grim and\r\nunknown Uplands, if that I said they did seem to my fancy to be a place\r\nwhere a sorrowful thing might wander lost forever. But why I to think\r\nthis thing, how shall I say; and do tell it to you, only because that it\r\ndoth seem to hold in the thought the grimness and utter desolation of\r\nthose high and lonesome lands.\r\n\r\nAnd by this, I was done looking, and turned me about, and so did find\r\nthat Mine Own did stand silent, and waited that I come to my slumber.\r\nAnd surely, I lookt at her; but she did have her lids something\r\ndownward, when that she saw me turn; and so in the end, I said naught,\r\nbut went to my sleep, and had the Diskos very handy, as ever, beside me.\r\n\r\nAnd I then to know that Mine Own did lie down beside me, to my back, as\r\nalway, and this to gladden me, as you shall think; for I perceived\r\nafresh how thin did be the crust of her naughtiness; and I to be alway\r\nstirred and touched in the heart by her loving naturalness, that did\r\nneed alway that she be near to me, save when she did play this\r\nnaughtiness upon me along the way.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw that she had no mind to be perverse whilst that I did slumber;\r\nbut must now be nigh unto me, and quietly loving; though nowise truly\r\nceased from her naughty acting that I did be as an hard slave master,\r\nbecause that I had whipt her; yet she to have somewhat a truce with me,\r\nas my heart did know. But, indeed, she not to kiss me good-night upon\r\nthe mouth, in her dear usual and sober fashion.\r\n\r\nAnd surely I did lie awhile, and pondered upon the Maid and upon all her\r\nways; and I perceived that she kist me not, only because that she did\r\nnot be able to break utter from her perverseness, that did come from the\r\nstirring of her nature. And truly, I did love her, and was half minded\r\nthat I turn about to her, and take her a moment into mine arms; but yet\r\nto abide from this, because that I was set that I wait awhile, and to\r\nbring her to me thiswise, mayhaps.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I knew that the Maid kist mine armour, very quiet and\r\nshy, because that she must kiss me; yet to be intent that I have no\r\nknowledge of this pretty act. But, indeed, I did know in all my being,\r\nand did be newly tender unto her; yet to say naught, and to wait.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I knew presently that her breathing did go easy, so that I\r\nperceived that she was all content and gone over unto slumber, somewise\r\nas a little child that doth be weary, and doth sleep without care, and\r\nwith happy assurance.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, did a man ever to have so sweet and gentle a maid, that\r\ndid be in the same time so troublous and perverse.\r\n\r\nAnd I to lie yet awhile, and to note the constant tremble and shake of\r\nthe rock that did be under us; and this to be alway thus as I did lie,\r\nand to be the more plain, because that I did be quiet in thought. And\r\nthis, as I conceived, did come from the earth-shaking that was made by\r\nthe inward fire of the world, the which did make a vague trouble in all\r\nthat part of the Land.\r\n\r\nAnd then in a little, I was gone over into sleep, and waked not for\r\nseven good hours; and then to hear the fizzing of the water, very brisk\r\nand cheerful, and so to have mine eyes open in a moment, and to know by\r\nmy time-keeper or dial, that was somewhat like to a watch of this age,\r\nthat I had slumbered through seven good hours. But this to be learned\r\nafter that I had lookt to see whether Mine Own did be well, and whether\r\nthat the boulder did balance in the mouth-part of the cave.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, there did be nothing in harm; for the boulder was there, as\r\nI did put it; and the Maid a little off from me, and did make ready the\r\nwater and the tablets, that we eat before our journeying.\r\n\r\nAnd I rose then, and in the same moment I did know that my mouth had\r\nbeen kist whilst that I slept; and the knowing to come to me vague, as\r\nthat I had been kist in my dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt over toward the Maid; but she to have her lids something\r\ndown upon her eyes, and to seem very demure; so that I saw her\r\nnaughtiness was come again upon her. Yet, truly, I could not bear that I\r\nnot to have her into mine arms; for, indeed, her perverseness did seem\r\nas that she did the more tempt me unto her. And thus I came to her in a\r\nmoment; but she neither to resist me, nor to give herself unto me; but\r\nonly to be still in mine arms, and to do no more than submit very quiet.\r\n\r\nAnd because of this, I loost her unkist, and was silent, and a little to\r\nbe angered, even whilst that my heart perceived the way of the working\r\nof her heart. Yet truly I ached now that she come back to her dear\r\nnatural fashion.\r\n\r\nAnd I eat my tablets and drank some of the water; and the Maid to do\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I lookt well from the mouth of the cave; but did nowhere\r\nsee aught to put me in trouble for our safety, though, truly, as\r\npresently I saw, there went an herd of strange creatures afar off in the\r\nNorthwestward part, which did be that way of the Country, beyond the\r\nfeet of the mountains, toward the In-Land.\r\n\r\nNow, when that I was something assured of the safeness of the way, I gat\r\nthe Diskos to my hip, and the Maid to have the scrip and the pouch ready\r\nto my back, and her bundle to her hand; and so all to be ready.\r\n\r\nAnd I went downward from the cave, when that I was girt, and gave aid to\r\nMine Own; and so to be soon upon the journey.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, as we went onward, and I to look about me with\r\ndifferent-seeing eyes from my looking on mine outward way, I to see how\r\nwondrous this part of the Land did be; and how that it did be truly like\r\na great and wondrous park, that did be made of the skill and labour of\r\ngodlike things; and truly this to show my feeling, as I lookt all-ways.\r\nAnd all that part did be bred of the inward forces of the world, and did\r\nbe burned clear in this place, and upheaved in that, and made to an hot\r\nlake in another part; and odd whiles there to go a great steam fountain,\r\nthat did whistle a lonely song forever. And anon there to be a small\r\nwood, and again a wood; and oft the quietness of great and strange\r\ntrees, that did stand alone. And here, and in that part, a little\r\nfire-hill, that did be surely no greater than an house, and we to pass\r\nseven of these in but three hours. And two to glow very steadfast, and\r\nto make no vigour of burning; but the five others did burn very strong,\r\nand sent out a smoke and ash, and made a small desolation all about\r\nthem; and of these five, there did be one that cast stones oft and\r\nagain, so that they went upward with a strange loud noise, and fell in\r\nthis place and that, all about, so that we came downward more nigh to\r\nthe shore, that we be a good way off.\r\n\r\nAnd here, as I do mind, there was a strangeness, in that there did be\r\nmany trees that had stones set in the branches; and this to be plainly\r\nthe work of the little fire-hill; and I to think it but something new\r\ncome, else surely there had been no trees within all that space that it\r\ndid throw; but yet, mayhap, I am wrong in this; for all things did seem\r\nthat they grew very easy in that Country; and indeed this to be for\r\nsurprise to me, only that I saw it with mine own eyes, as we do say.\r\n\r\nAnd alway as we did go, there were signs of inward life and forces; so\r\nthat we but to stand quiet to feel that the earth did tremble gently in\r\nmany parts.\r\n\r\nAnd presently there sounded for a great while a low and dull booming\r\nsound; and this we found to be from a place amid certain great rocks\r\ntoward the mountains; for there came thence a mighty up-spouting of\r\nboiling water, that went so high as an hundred feet, and oft to be\r\nthrice so high, and belched a great steam; and there went up in the jet\r\nof the water, a great rock, that was so big as an house, and did dance\r\nand play in the might of the water, as that it had been no more than a\r\nthing very light and easy. And when that the water fell, as it did oft,\r\nthe rock to go downward with the dull booming that we did hear.\r\n\r\nAnd I minded how that I had heard the booming upon mine outward way; but\r\nhad been then something more to the shore, so that it had been less\r\nplain to mine ears, as you shall suppose; neither had it been then to my\r\nsight, as now it did be to us because that we were come mayhap the half\r\nof a mile more toward the In-Land of the Country.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, we lookt awhile at this huge great fountain and up-boiling,\r\nand came nearer unto it; but yet to be a large space off, because of\r\nthe way that it did throw out a spattering of small stones odd whiles.\r\nAnd surely the thing did cough and roar in the deep earth, and anon to\r\ngruntle gently and to sob and gurgle; and lo! to come forth in a moment\r\nwith a bellow, very hollow and strange, and the great rock to go\r\nspinning upward, and all a-shine in the light from the volcanoes, and\r\nwas so round as a monstrous ball, and polished by the fret of the\r\nwaters, so that I saw it had surely danced in the great jet through a\r\nweary time.\r\n\r\nAnd anon the jet to cease and to go downward with a great soughing and\r\nthundering of waters, and the dancing rock to fall downward from that\r\nheight which did show very huge, now that we did be come so near. And\r\nthe rock surely to fall backward into some deep pit, whence came the\r\nwaters, and as it fell, there was again the dull booming. But why the\r\nrock brake not, I could not perceive, save that it did alway fall into a\r\nboiling up of waters, and had no hurt from the rock of the place whence\r\nit was come.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid and I both to have stood a while, that we stare at this\r\nthing; for it did be more strange than I have made you to know; but now\r\nI did make to our journey again, and did think the Maid followed; but\r\nlo! in a moment, when that I lookt, she was to my back, and went toward\r\nthe great boiling fountain. Then I stopt very swift, and called to her;\r\nbut she did take no heed of me, and went onward very naughty, unto the\r\ndanger of the great boil of the Jet, and the constant flying out of the\r\nstones, that you do know.\r\n\r\nNow, even as I stood and lookt, the Maid drew nigh to the place where\r\nthe water did thunder; and the Jet in that moment to bellow, so that I\r\nknew it came upward again. And I ran then after the Maid, and she to see\r\nme, and began likewise to run from me toward the monstrous fountain; and\r\nsurely I did think that I had done well if that I had whipt or beat her\r\nproper before this time; for truly it did be as that her naughtiness had\r\ngone nigh unto somewhat that did be near to a wayward madness, so that\r\nas I did perceive all her nature did surely work in her toward some deed\r\nthat should be for regret; and this to come, because that she did be\r\nsomething pusht from her dear balance by her loving, and by the acting\r\nof my manhood upon her, so that her nature both to be in rebellion\r\nagainst me and to need me, and all in the same time. And this-way, she\r\nto be in an inward turmoil, and to be ready foolishly that she put in\r\ndanger her beloved life, if only thereby she to make me something\r\nadrift, and in the same moment to have some ease of her perverseness.\r\nAnd, in verity, you to know all this, because that I have shown the\r\nworking of her heart to you before this time.\r\n\r\nNow, I caught the Maid among the great rocks, which did stand all about;\r\nand before her there did be a monstrous pit whence came the upbursting\r\nof the water; and the water to go upward before our faces in a mighty\r\ncolumn, so that it did be as that a sea shot up on end, into a pillar of\r\nliving water, and went upward forever, as it did seem in that moment.\r\nAnd how we should be saved, I knew not, for the water did be as that it\r\noverhung us, and should come down upon us and smother us in one moment,\r\nforever. And the roar was in our ears and shook all the air of that\r\nplace with sound, as of an harsh and dreadful thunder; and there was a\r\nscalding of beaten water, as fine as an haze, all about us.\r\n\r\nAnd I had the Maid in one instant into mine arms, and I ran very swift,\r\nwith a fierce running, that I have her away speedy, and so made forlorn\r\ntrial that I save her life. And lo! as I went from under that huge and\r\ndreadful overhang of the great waters, there came downward from the\r\nheight a great stone that had been cast by the Jet, and it burst upon\r\nthe rock to my back, and certain of the flinders did strike and ring\r\nupon mine armour, and made me to stagger as I ran. But I held the Maid\r\ncrowded safe against my breast, and she did not be hurt; and truly I was\r\nyet able to run, and did save Mine Own, and brought her out from under\r\nthat grim Spouting.\r\n\r\nAnd I put the Maid down then to her feet; and she not to know how near\r\nthat she had given us to death, neither of the way that the fragments\r\ndid strike me; for she laughed very naughty and gleeful. But truly I\r\nlaughed not; for my heart had been nigh husht with terror for her; so\r\nthat I did be yet sick in my spirit, and mayhap also something shaken by\r\nthe blows that I gat from the broken stone.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I to have meant that I flog her, very sharp, if that\r\nthere be no other way that I might bring her to reason; for, in surety,\r\nas you to see, she to be acting so wild as a child, and so unreasoning\r\nas only a Maid-in-love; and I to know that she did have to be brought\r\nback from this way of spirit, even though I have to hurt her pretty\r\nbody, that I bring her again to her dear natural wiseness.\r\n\r\nYet, indeed, I could not whip her then, because that she did laugh so\r\njoyous, though with a naughty heart, and did look so wondrous dainty, so\r\nthat even her defyings did but seem that which my heart desired. And\r\nyou, mayhap, to have been something likewise in the love-days. Yet I\r\npled and reasoned with her to be a wise maid; but, indeed, she only to\r\nmake a gleeful mock of all that I did say.\r\n\r\nNow I went forward again, for I was not harmed by the stone, only that I\r\ndid be shaked, as you shall think. And the Maid to go offward from me,\r\nand to sing, and did oft dance naughtily as she went. But truly, I did\r\nbe silent with her, for I was but human, and did lack that she come to\r\nmine arms, and love me, because that I had pluckt her safe from that\r\nplace. And, indeed, this to be but a natural desiring; and you to have\r\nunderstanding with me, and to know that you also to have this lack and\r\nneed, if that you to have done aught for love of your maid, and she to\r\ndeny you a word of loving tenderness.\r\n\r\nYet, in verity, I to be even then able to perceive with mine inward\r\nsenses, how that the Maid did have a wondrous up-pouring of love for me,\r\nbut yet did be so perverse, and the more so, mayhap, because that her\r\nlove did so urge her unto loving admittings that I did be her Man. And\r\nshe, maybe, to have meant that she be the more humble presently, but yet\r\nto go naughtily awhile more, and not, indeed, to have had the power\r\nwithin her at that time, to have come unto me, and cast off her\r\nwaywardness, and askt that she be in mine arms, as all my heart did\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nAnd so, as I have told, I went silently, and mayhap with a little\r\ndullness, that did be part of anger and part of hurt and part of that\r\nsame strange love-foolishness from which the Maid did suffer. And truly,\r\nthis doth be very contrary-seeming, only that you have seen my heart;\r\nand all indeed the more human, that it doth be so contrariwise to the\r\nbrain-reason; and all to be desired, else did a man be no better than an\r\nant or a weariful machine.\r\n\r\nAnd this to be truth and wholesomeness as you shall perceive, if that\r\nyou look deep enough, and do modify Reason with heart-understanding;\r\nfor, in verity, how shall that which we call Reason, bring any to the\r\nfull and the great knowledge. And this doth be a power of holy things,\r\nand doth be a child that is born of Love and Reason, and in the one to\r\nhold the two, and to know all things is the gift of this power; so that\r\nno man may walk truly that hath only the first, neither any man do utter\r\nwise that hath only the second.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I to cease from these thoughts, and to my tellings; and you\r\nto your harkings and dear sympathy.\r\n\r\nNow, when the sixth hour did be come, we made a halt and eat and drank,\r\nand afterward went onward again, and so came presently clear of the two\r\nmonstrous fire-hills; and their great noise to be presently to our rear,\r\nand likewise that quiet country that did be round their feet, and did\r\nseem so utter husht and strange and doubly so, because of the upward\r\nnoise of the mountains, and because of the slow and subtle earth-shaking\r\nthat did be so constant, and because of all those things that I have\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nNow, when we had made halt, the Maid had done her hair very uncomely\r\nupon her head, and had lookt slyly to see whether I did note; but truly,\r\nI took no heed; so that in the end she had it again in a pretty fashion,\r\nand did sing naughtily and with an heart of mischief, as she did shape\r\nit loose and wondrous nice about her head.\r\n\r\nAnd I still to have no word for her; neither to show that I did watch\r\nher with love and somewise a quaint pleasure of her perverseness, even\r\nwhilst that I did strive by silence and an aloofness that I bring her to\r\nmy side, as she did be in the first days; for truly I did ache that she\r\nbe near unto me, and to cease from her waywardness that did put a\r\ndistance of spirit between us, as you to perceive.\r\n\r\nAnd so we did go forward again, as I have told, and the Maid did strive\r\nthat she make me to give attention to her naughtiness, for she did walk\r\nalway offward from me, and did sing aloud, and truly they did be songs\r\nstrange unto me, but yet to be of love, and much as the songs of this\r\nAge; for, truly, there doth be but one song upon all the earth, and she\r\nbut to sing it in diverse ways.\r\n\r\nAnd she did oft to make little glancing toward me, and did pout very\r\npretty; and in a moment come something toward me, as that she did be\r\nhumble, and would be forgiven; but all to be in a naughty mockery; so\r\nthat, in verity, I lookt not at her, save odd whiles; but did go forward\r\nalway, and made as that I had no heed of her doings.\r\n\r\nAnd surely this did presently to stir her to a new defying and to a\r\npretty anger; for she did sing other songs of impudence, that she did\r\nfit very clever about me; and this way to have a constant impertinence.\r\n\r\nAnd so we did go, and I never to speak with the Maid, but to wonder when\r\nthat she cease, or how long it should be ere that I did run swift to her\r\nand have her into mine arms, that I shake her and kiss her, all as my\r\nheart did desire.\r\n\r\nAnd when that the twelfth hour did be come, we made halt again and eat\r\nand drank; and the Maid to serve me very intent, and hand me the water,\r\nthe while that she went down upon her knee, as a slave; but when I would\r\nhave laughed gently at her mockings, and taken her into mine arms, she\r\nwent from me very sudden and cold, and was afterward silent and did sit\r\napart from me.\r\n\r\nNow I also did be silent, and in the first because that I was a little\r\npained, and also because that I did be new touched with the\r\nlove-foolishness that did trouble Mine Own.\r\n\r\nBut afterward, I ceased from these feelings, and did be intent to\r\nanother matter; for it did seem to my spirit that there was some danger\r\nanigh to us; and I had a thought of the Humpt Men, and lookt well about,\r\nand did beckon the Maid to come nigh, because that the trees did be\r\nplentiful thereabout, to hide any creature.\r\n\r\nBut Mine Own came not over to me, so that I loosed the Diskos from mine\r\nhip, and went that I be nigh to her. And she made that she saw me not;\r\nbut did set the gear together, and had it presently a-ready for the\r\njourney, the while that I did look all-ways among the trees; but indeed\r\nI saw naught.\r\n\r\nAnd when that I had the gear upon me, and the Maid her bundle, we went\r\nforward again; and I to be very wary, and bid the Maid keep close to my\r\nside; but indeed, she would not obey, and went offward among the trees,\r\nso that I was all an-haunted with dread for her, and ran and caught her,\r\nand talkt wisely with her; but indeed she did not hark to me; but did\r\nrun off in the moment that I loost her.\r\n\r\nAnd I caught her again, and I took one of the straps from around the\r\nScrip and the Pouch, and set it about her pretty waist, and the end I\r\nheld in my hand, and so had her to obey me in this thing which did be\r\nneedful to her safety.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid to go with me very husht for two great hours, and I alway\r\nto look well about. And in the end of that time, the Maid did begin to\r\nsing impudently, and I did ask her that she be a quiet maid, lest that\r\nshe bring danger upon us; but she to be the more impudent.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as I did strive that I look all-ways, lest any harm did come\r\nupon us, and in the same moment to reason Mine Own from her pretty\r\nfolly, she did grow very husht, so that I lookt round upon her in an\r\ninstant. And truly, she had cut the strap with her belt-knife, and did\r\nrun away very swift among the trees. And surely my heart did slow a\r\nlittle in my breast, because that there did seem something a-move in the\r\ndark of the shadows, where the trees did grow thick, and the Maid did\r\nrun that way in her foolishness and waywardness.\r\n\r\nAnd I ran hard after the Maid, and did call her, not over-loud, lest I\r\nbring somewhat upon her; but she to have no heed, and to run very light\r\nand swift, so that I caught her not for the half of a minute, as it\r\nmight be; for she was gone ahead, and I did be a little cumbered with\r\nmine armour.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! when I caught her, I shook her, and pointed inward among the\r\ntrees, for it did seem even then to me that something moved there; but\r\nshe to struggle in my hand a moment, and afterward to be still, and to\r\nask with an insolence and a defiance whether that I did mean to flog my\r\nchattel, the which she did call herself in her naughtiness.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, ere I did know, she had twist from me, and did run with\r\na true wickedness straight toward that place where somewhat had seemed\r\nto be a-move. And I ran then with all my strength, and with a fearful\r\nand an anxious heart. And because I put all my strength to the matter, I\r\ncaught the Maid in a moment, ere she did be gone any way; and she again\r\nto fight to be gone from me. But I took her into mine arms, very strong,\r\nand I ran outward from that place where the trees made a darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, when I was come again to where the trees did be more spare,\r\nI saw that I was come nigh to that river which I crost on the raft, as\r\nyou shall mind; and truly I did be glad, and to feel safe in a moment.\r\nYet I was firm now to my purpose; for I set the Maid to the earth upon\r\nher feet, and kept my hold very sure upon her; for I did mean that I\r\nwhip her, before that her love-foolishness bring her needless unto\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAnd I took the belt from her pretty waist, for it did be but a light\r\nstrap, and I whipt her very sharp over her shoulders with the belt. And,\r\ntruly, she did make to nestle unto me in a moment, as that other time\r\nwhen that I whipt her; but I stayed her from this, and I set the belt\r\nthrice more across her shoulders, very sharp, so that she to learn\r\nwisdom at once, and I to be free for ever of this need to pain her,\r\nwhich did hurt me very strange.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid to stand very quiet, now that I did keep her from coming\r\nunto me; and her head did be something bent, so that I knew not whether\r\nI did mayhap have flogged her over-hard; for I did be something lacking\r\nin knowledge whether that a maid be very easy hurt.\r\n\r\nAnd I stooped and lookt into her face; and lo! she did be smiling\r\nnaughtily, and kist me in a moment very saucy upon the mouth, ere I did\r\nbe aware; and afterward, she laughed and made try to make a bitter mock\r\nupon me, and askt when that I should be pleased to cease from whipping\r\nmy chattel; for that then she should run away immediately into the wood,\r\nand to trust the Humpt Men that they protect her from me.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I lookt at her very grave; for I perceived that she did not\r\ntruly jest, but made to anger me, and did be half in a strange anger\r\nherself, and something adrift; for she had not been whipt enough, but\r\nonly to stir her rebellion utterly. And I saw that if she be not set\r\nright then, ere she leave my hand, she to be like to have some new\r\nfoolishness that should take her unto her death, even as she had come\r\novernear already, as you to know. And this to be because that her nature\r\ndid be stirred so that her natural wiseness was all overset, and she to\r\nbe that she do aught of unwisdom that should come to her, because of her\r\npretty love-foolishness, which did now be made the more strong, by\r\nreason of the half-rising of her anger.\r\n\r\nAnd this way, as I have known, I perceived that, for her dear sake, I\r\nshould not let my lovingness weaken me in that moment. And, in verity, I\r\nshifted my hand and loosed the fastenings of her garment, so that her\r\npretty shoulders did be bared. And her face to change sudden, and she\r\nlookt up at me an instant, with a little gasp; so that I knew she did be\r\nall unbroken, as was mine intent; but she did not yet have learned\r\ndeeply in her heart, all that I was minded that she to learn; for even\r\nin that moment, she made a sound that showed she did try to mock me; but\r\ntruly, she did not know in that instant whether to mock or to weep;\r\nthough she did try to suppose that she had yet an heart for mockery.\r\n\r\nAnd I set the belt thrice across her pretty shoulders, where they did be\r\nbared; and surely the blows did be very stern and sharp. And lo! in one\r\nmoment Mine Own broke into an utter weeping, so that I took her instant\r\ninto mine arms, and did hold her strong and gentle against mine armour.\r\nAnd she to be as a child in mine arms, and did sob very strange and\r\nbitter, as that she did be all undone in the heart.\r\n\r\nAnd presently she did be quiet in mine arms; though I to feel how she\r\ndid yet tremble; and she did cling tight unto me, and her face to be\r\nagainst mine armour.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, when that she had ceased to tremble, I kist her, and\r\nsurely her mouth did be very humble, and her lids to be downward, and\r\nshe to be something pale. And she then to be awhile more in mine arms,\r\nvery quiet; and so to come unto her dear self. And lo! presently, she to\r\nwant to kiss me of her own accord; and she put up her lips, very sweet\r\nand as a loving maid, that I kiss her. And surely I kist her, with an\r\nhumble and a masterful love; and a strange pain to be about my heart, as\r\nyou shall suppose; but yet my heart and my reason both to approve mine\r\naction; and the Maid to be but the more mine own, and to have come again\r\nto her dear natural wisdom.\r\n\r\nYet, as you shall know, there to be for a long while a strange and mixed\r\npain, in my bosom, both dreadful and tender, because that I had been so\r\nstern with Mine Own Maid; so that even while that my heart and my reason\r\ndid approve me, my heart to make somewhat of reproach. And this to have\r\nbeen someways of foolishness; but yet human of our Nature, and an\r\nwholesome trouble to the spirit, if that this troubling be not allowed\r\nto shape our actions to any harmful weakness.\r\n\r\nNow, in a while, the Maid did come to composedness, and to be very\r\ngentle and sweetly natural. And she made presently that she would have\r\nme to loose her; and afterward, she turned her back to me, even as a\r\ndear child, that I fasten her garment again upon the shoulders. And she\r\ndid be both shy and glad, and humble, and in dainty pride of submission,\r\nand utter Mine Own. And surely, as I did this thing for her, I perceived\r\nthat she lookt with a great shyness at the belt which did be yet in my\r\nhand. And when that I had made an end of fastening her garment, she did\r\nnestle unto me for a while, and afterward stood away and made shyly to\r\nshow me that I put her belt again about her pretty waist. And I saw that\r\nshe did be somewhat a-lack yet that she touch the belt, because that I\r\nhad whipt her with it.\r\n\r\nAnd truly you to perceive how her heart did be in this matter; but if\r\nyou not to know, then how shall I to tell you; and do but bid you ask\r\nyour own maid; though, in verity, she to be like that she but laugh at\r\nyou, and leave you so wise as you be now; for the way of the heart of a\r\nmaid doth be most hid to the maid, and she but to know the desire, and\r\nto lack the ending. But truly she doth know when that a man shall set\r\nthe truth of her heart before her.\r\n\r\nNow, when I had buckled the belt very nice again about Mine Own, we went\r\nbackward a space, until that we found the bundle, which she had dropt,\r\nwhen that she ran off from me. And I saw also the portion of the strap,\r\nwhich she cut; and so all to be found.\r\n\r\nAnd we went then at a good speed toward the river; for I was still\r\nminded regarding the seeming of movement which there had been among the\r\ntrees; and very wishful that we have a raft made with haste, so that we\r\nmight come to the little island, where I did sleep before, upon the\r\noutward way, as you shall remember. And I thought to have our slumber\r\nagain in that place, and to make that day\'s journeying something short,\r\nbecause that the island was near, and a good and safe place for our\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\nAnd I told the Maid concerning the island; and she to be in great\r\ndelight and interest, because that it did be one of those halts of mine\r\noutward going, and did be all eager as a child, when that I said we\r\nshould truly have need of a raft to come to the island.\r\n\r\nAnd we came downward to the shore of the river, and, indeed, there did\r\nbe those two same trees, that had been my raft, there upon the shore of\r\nthat place. And I showed these to Mine Own, and truly she did nigh to\r\nweep upon them, because of her dear emotions and love, and did cut a\r\nsmall branch therefrom, with her belt-knife, and put the branch where\r\nshe did put the piece of bark; and this to be for a remembrance and an\r\nafter-delight and pondering.\r\n\r\nNow we lookt well in all parts, that we find some other small tree that\r\nshould be fallen; and the Maid did climb a rock that did be near, with a\r\nflat top, so that she might search out around.\r\n\r\nAnd presently she cried out to me that there did be a tree to our\r\npurpose, and but an hundred paces away; and she to go with me to show\r\nme, and to aid, if need be; but, indeed I carried the tree very easy,\r\nand had it with the others; and afterward, we went about again for\r\nbranches, and these I cut from live trees, using the Diskos with care\r\nand wiseness.\r\n\r\nAnd with these branches to be for cross-pieces, and our belts and the\r\nstraps for binders, I set the trees together into a raft, and made it\r\npretty good for our need, and so that no monstrous thing in the river\r\nshould have chance to snap upward between the trees at my dear One.\r\n\r\nAnd when the raft was done, I gat it to the water, and the Maid did lend\r\nher strength; for the thing was heavy, as you shall think. And when this\r\nwas done, I pushed a sharp branch downward into the shore, and I hookt a\r\nbranch of the raft about this mooring, and so did be nigh ready for the\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nBut first I did need a pole to push the raft, and did wonder now where\r\nthe other did be gone, that I cut upon the outward way; for I had set\r\nthe pole with the two trees, as I did mind, having some vague thought\r\nthat mayhap I should live to come that way again.\r\n\r\nAnd I had a little strange unease that the pole did be gone; but scarce\r\nto know that I did be troubled, yet to set me to a new haste. And I bid\r\nthe Maid put the scrip and the pouch and her bundle secure upon the\r\nraft; and in that time I lookt well about for a sapling tree that should\r\ndo my purpose. And I saw that there grew an odd one a little to the side\r\nof the flat-topt rock that the Maid had lookt from; and whilst that I\r\ncut it, the Maid did come to watch, and made pretty chatter in the time\r\nthat I trimmed the branches away.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! whilst that I did be part divided in mine attention between her\r\ndear talk and my work and an haste that did be born of that little\r\nunease that was come upon me, my spirit to seem to be aware that there\r\ncame a danger anigh to us; and the Maid to have this same knowing; for\r\nshe ceased her speech, and lookt at me with somewhat of trouble. And lo!\r\nin that moment, as I balanced the pole in my hands, there came the noise\r\nof a sudden bounding to our backward part, where the trees did grow\r\nsomething anigh.\r\n\r\nAnd I turned, instant, and lookt; and behold! there did be upon us an\r\nHumpt Man, very lumpish and mighty; and he stretched out his hands, and\r\nran at me. And I had no time to the Diskos, which did be upon the earth\r\nto my feet; and I smote the Humpt Man with the point of the pole that\r\ndid be in my hands, and the point took him very strong and horrid in the\r\nbreast, and entered in, so that the Humpt Man gave out a strange\r\nhowling, that did be half seeming of an animal and half of an human. And\r\nhe clutched at the pole that did so hurt him, and I stoopt very swift\r\nfor the Diskos, and had it in a moment. And the Humpt Man tore the pole\r\nout of his breast, and in the same instant I ript him from the head\r\ndownward, so that he did be nigh in two halves; for I had no mercy in\r\nmine act, even though my heart did be something sorry.\r\n\r\nNow, even as the man died, there did be a sound of running in the wood\r\nbefore me; and lo! I turned very speedy to the Maid, and she was there\r\nto my back, and had her belt-knife drawn in her hand; for she had it in\r\nher bosom, where she had put it when that I took her belt for the raft.\r\n\r\nAnd I caught the Maid about the waist with my left arm, and was come\r\nwith her to the top of the rock in two great houndings. And I set her\r\nthere upon the rock, and turned again to the way I came and swung the\r\nDiskos free; for indeed, I had seen that there did come a number of the\r\nHumpt Men among the trees.\r\n\r\nAnd there came running from the wood, mayhaps a great score of the Humpt\r\nMen; so that it did seem to me that we did be going to die; for how\r\nshould one stand against so many, and they so quick and strong, as you\r\nshall mind.\r\n\r\nYet, in verity, I had no despair; but did be mixt in the heart with a\r\ngreat fear for Mine Own, and a strange and exulting gladness that I\r\nshould do that day some deed for Mine Own Maid; and truly this to be the\r\npomp of love and the heart-cry of the barbarian, as you shall say. And\r\nthis maybe; but truly I did be proper human, and to make no excuse\r\nbecause that I was natural; neither have I hid anywheres aught that I\r\ndid think and feel.\r\n\r\nAnd whether that you approve or not, if that you condemn me, you to\r\ncondemn all Humanity, and to have vain words and vain regrettings; for\r\nthese things that be named for faults, do but be the complement of our\r\nvirtues, and if that you slay the first, you may chance to wither the\r\nlast; for now I speak of things as they be now, and as they did be then;\r\nand nowise of lovely ideals that do live chief in the mind, and so much\r\nin mine as any, as you to know, if that you have gone with me all along\r\nmy way.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I must cease from my thinkings, and go forward with my\r\ntelling; for the Humpt Men did come forward at a wondrous quick run, and\r\ndid swarm upward on to the rock, as that they did be panthers; and they\r\nmade no outcry; but came silent to the killing; and I saw that they did\r\nbe something smaller than he that I had but then slain. And, in verity,\r\nI did be all knit in that moment with speed and cleverness; for I split\r\nthe heads of three, with but quick turns of my wrist, as I did wield the\r\nDiskos. And I kicked the face of another, in the same time, with my\r\nmetal boot, so that he died; for there did be all my strength and all my\r\nskill working then for our salvation.\r\n\r\nNow all this to have been done in but a few beats of the heart, as I\r\nmight say; and these men to have been in the front of the attacking. Yet\r\nthere did be no space to have breath; for there leaped three more of the\r\nMen upon the rock; and one smote me with a great piece of rock that he\r\ncarried, so that mine armour did seem as that it crackt, and I to be\r\ndriven backward upon the Maid; yet had slain one of the Humpt Men, even\r\nin that moment.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, my dear One caught me in her arms, behind, and steadied me,\r\nso that I fell not; and I slew the Humpt Man with the rock, even in that\r\nmoment whilst Mine Own held me, as he came again to strike me. And I\r\nthen to be firm again upon my feet, and did spring at the third of the\r\nHumpt Men; and surely there was no room that he should be able to avoid\r\nme, even did that be his intent; and he came at me with a great leap.\r\nAnd I stood strong, looking clearly to my work; and I swung the Diskos\r\nwith both my hands, and the blow took the Humpt Man in the middle part,\r\nand split him, whilst that he did be yet leaping. And in that instant\r\nthere reached over the edge of the rock, two of the Humpt Men, and gat\r\nme by the feet; so that I was pulled sudden to my back very hard and\r\nbitter; and this to be done, even whilst that the body of the Humpt Man\r\ndid be yet in the air. And the body came forward over me, and did be\r\nutter dead already, and fell down upon the rock beyond me, and rolled\r\nhorridly and went over the edge of the rock.\r\n\r\nAnd I did be all shaken and something bemused by the hardness of my\r\nfall; and the hands of the two Humpt Men pluckt me sharp to the edge of\r\nthe rock, the while that I did strike vaguely to wound them; but did\r\nonly chip the rock, and fortunate that I harmed not the weapon.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in the moment that they had been like to have me downward to\r\nthe earth into their midst, I to make a good stroke, for I cut the\r\nshoulder of one very dreadful, so that he loosed me; and immediately, I\r\nkicked very fierce with my freed foot, and surely I nigh crushed the\r\nhand of that other with my metal boot; and he likewise to cease from\r\ndragging upon me.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately, I knew that Mine Own did be helping me that I get\r\ninstant to my feet again; for I was yet something dazed.\r\n\r\nAnd there came then a rush of the Humpt Men up the rock; and truly it\r\ndid be a glad thing for our lives that they might come up only upon but\r\none side; for the other sides did be utter steep and smooth worn; and\r\nthis to have been unto our saving, as you shall think.\r\n\r\nAnd I stood up to the rush of the Humpt Men, and did smite hard at them,\r\nwith a quick circling of the Diskos, so that the great weapon did glow\r\nand roar. And they gave back from the blaze and the sound of the Diskos;\r\nand surely then I ran in upon them, whilst that they did be something\r\nbewildered; and I gat the foremost man full upon the head, so that he\r\ndid be dead before he did know what thing happened. Yet, in verity, this\r\ndid be a dread moment to me; for the Humpt Men leaped in at me upon\r\nevery side in an instant of time; and I did be struck upon my head-piece\r\nand upon my back and breast with the stones that certain of them did\r\ncarry, so that I rockt as I stood, and did near to swoon, and mine\r\narmour to be all dint and bent upon me, and I truly to seem that I had\r\ncome to the time of my dying.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in that moment of time, there did come to my dazed sense a low\r\nand bitter cry of anguish from the Maid; and this to set all my life\r\naglow in me. And, in verity, there went a strange greyness of fury\r\nbefore mine eyes, and I then to fight as I did never fight before; and I\r\ndid smite as it did seem forever. And the greyness did ease from mine\r\neyes, and the Maid did have her arms about me as I stood, and the dead\r\nMen to lie heapt upon the rock, and Mine Own to steady me, for I did be\r\nnear slain and the blood did go from me, and mine armour was all broke\r\nupon me by the smitings of the sharp stones.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt something slowly upon Mine Own; and she to know that I would\r\nask whether that she did be harmed anywise; and she to be very brave\r\nwith me, and to tell me that she did be well; and she to be all slain in\r\nthe heart, because that I did be so hurt; but truly I had fought a good\r\nfight, and did lack only to know that she come to no harm. Now my wits\r\ndid come back into me very soon; but I did be utter weak, and scarce to\r\nstand; so that I did mind only that I get Mine Own safe unto the raft,\r\nand to put off then from the shore.\r\n\r\nAnd I walkt slow to the edge of the rock, and lookt well about, that I\r\nlearn whether the Humpt Men did be all gone away; and the Maid did\r\nsteady me.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! there came up in that instant the last of the Humpt Men, and\r\nthey were five and did creep very stealthy, that they have me in\r\nsurprise. And I loost from the Maid, for I saw that I must come upon\r\nthem whilst that I had any strength left in my body; and they now to\r\nleap upward unto me, so that I gat the first upon the head, and he to go\r\nbackward dead; but truly I did be more weak than I knew; for I swayed\r\nupon the edge of the rock, and sudden I went downward to the earth; and\r\ndid be there upon my knees, and my back to the rock.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, the Humpt Men did come in upon me very swift; yet did\r\nthey give back from the Diskos, which I swung to and fro, so speedy as I\r\nmight, for my weakness, which did be so utter that I could nowise come\r\nto my feet to stand.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own came down swiftly from the rock, and ran past the Humpt\r\nMen, and I to make that I shout to her to go to the raft; but truly I\r\nhad no voice in my body, and did be dumb and weak, and did know that I\r\nshould be gone forever from Mine Own in a little moment, and she to have\r\nnone to protect her, neither to know the way of our journey, save by\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nAnd behold! Mine Own did shout to the Humpt Men, and I perceived that\r\nshe made to draw them after her; for she ran to and fore and did shout\r\ncontinually. But, indeed, the Humpt Men had no heed of her; but did make\r\nalway to come at me; and surely, in that moment, one of the Humpt Men\r\nreached me, and smote me so shrewd that sure he nigh crackt his\r\nmonstrous hand upon mine armour, and did drive me backward upon the\r\nrock, and to make me bleed afresh, so that I was all in a daze and near\r\nswooned away. And the Humpt Man caught at the Diskos; yet, in verity, he\r\nloost it on the instant, for it did burn and shake him very sore; and\r\nimmediately, he smote me again, and so made to end me.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in that moment, the Maid ran right in among the Humpt Men, and\r\nshe struck the man that strove with me, and drove her belt-knife once\r\nand again through his arm, very savage and determined. And surely, the\r\nman turned upon her, and he caught her by her garments, and he ript her\r\ntwo garments utter from her, so that they came away and she did be free.\r\nAnd behold, mine utter despair for her did give me a new strength, so\r\nthat I shouted to her that she run instant to the raft; and I cut the\r\nHumpt Man in twain, and did fall back then into a part swoon against the\r\nrock. And lo! the Maid ran out from the Humpt Men; but they neither to\r\nknow whether that they follow her or that they come in upon me; and as\r\nthey did pause, she to call to them, and to try that she tempt them from\r\nme toward the wood; for she had no thought of her life, but only that\r\nshe free me and save me; and I too weak even to have power to command\r\nher to the raft; and she, truly, to have no heed to such command, even\r\ndid I thus to call again. And there I did be, half-gone out from this\r\nlife, and lookt at her with eyes that did scarce wot, save as in a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! the Humpt Men ceased sudden that they heed her; and the three\r\nthat did be left came very sly unto me, and with slowness and cunning;\r\nfor they wotted not whether I did be dead, or but a-wait for them. And\r\nthe Maid perceived that they came not after her; and she let out a great\r\ncry that did be distant-seeming in my dulled ears, and came back, naked,\r\nand running very swift. And she ran by me as death should run, white and\r\nsilent and her face set unto despair, and her eyes utter intent. And she\r\nstruck her belt-knife into the shoulder of the near Humpt Man; and the\r\nMan howled and turned, and she did leap to the side, and the Humpt Man\r\nran at her. But lo! she leaped again this way and that, and utter\r\nsilent, and so quick as a light doth seem to dance all ways in a moment.\r\nAnd the two other Men did join with the first, that they catch her; and\r\nbehold! she went about, and did run right away among the trees, and the\r\nthree Men did come after her, running very lumbersome, yet with a great\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid had the knife in her hand, and I knew that she did mean to\r\nslay herself presently, when that she could run no more; and in that\r\nmoment it seemed that my heart burst; for that I should never more see\r\nMine Own Maid forever. And there came some power of movement into me,\r\nand I came forward from the rock and fell over upon my face. And I gat\r\nagain to my knees, and began that I creep after the Maid, and I did\r\nshout in whispers, for my voice had no more power to call. And the Maid\r\nwent from my sight among the trees, as a far white figure, that did run\r\nvery swift, and was presently lost utter to my sight; and the Humpt Men\r\ndid go after; yet even in my weakness, I perceived that two did go\r\nsomething clumsy, as that they had been hurt in the fight; and they to\r\nbe the rearward of the chasing; but he that the Maid did cut with the\r\nknife was to the fore, and did run very strong; and surely they were all\r\ngone inward of the trees with a dreadful speed, and were lost from me.\r\nAnd the world did become sudden an Emptyness and a great Horror, and\r\nthere was no sound in all the Earth, as it did seem. And I knew that I\r\nwas come to my feet, and did run toward the trees, and the Diskos did\r\ntrail from mine arm by the hold-buckle; and the ground did be as that it\r\nmoved and shifted under me, and I not to feel where I trod, but did only\r\npeer desperate and lost among the trees; and, as I to know now, I heard\r\nmy voice calling strangely; and afterward there was a thundering in mine\r\nears, and I came downward upon my face.\r\n\r\nAnd I did know presently that I was alive, and there to be some dreadful\r\nterror at my heart; and surely I did remember and sickened and gat my\r\nhead from the ground. And I lookt among the trees; but there did be\r\nnothing, and everywhere there did be a strange silence and a dimness of\r\nunreal seemings. And I knew that Mine Own was gone from me, and had\r\nsurely died. And the earth did be all stained about me with my blood,\r\nand I did be utter glad; for I to need death.\r\n\r\nAnd I swooned again and was lost to my pain; but did live presently to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a little strength come into me, and I gat my head up\r\nsomewhat from the ground, and did peer among the trees; and my head did\r\nbe too heavy, and my face came against the earth once more. And because\r\nthat I could not hold up my head, I rolled my head a little, until that\r\nmy cheek did be to the ground, and I to look thiswise, so well as I\r\nmight; but there did be nothing; and afterward, I rolled my head again\r\nto the other cheek, and so to stare very weak and desperate, and not\r\nabled to look proper to my front. And lo! there went something among the\r\ntrees, and did show white in the gloom of the wood; and did come through\r\nthe trees. And I not to believe in the first that I did truly see aught;\r\nand sudden I to know that I saw somewhat. And behold! my heart did bound\r\nin me, so that all my body did waken; for I knew that Mine Own Maid did\r\nrun slow and staggering toward me, through the wood. And I did be now\r\nupon my knees and upon my hands, and did begin again to creep and to\r\nbleed; and did make little callings to Mine Own, that had no sounding.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own drew nigh, and did rock and stagger, and did strike anon\r\nagainst the trunks of the trees, as that she did be gone near blind with\r\nher running. And in a moment she saw me, and that I did yet live and did\r\ncome unto her; and she made a strange and loving crying unto me, with a\r\ngreat gladness and with an utter weakness.\r\n\r\nAnd she came running, and was lost with faintness, and did sway this way\r\nand that, stumbling; and she went sudden to the earth, and did be still.\r\n\r\nAnd I crept onward so speedy as I might, and the earth to seem alway as\r\nthat it moved from my hands, and to slide; and this-seeming to be of my\r\nweakness; for my hands and my knees went everyway, and my head to be\r\nthat it kept nodding forward very stupid to the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as I came anigh unto the Maid, where she did lie so quiet, I saw\r\nthat something moved in the wood, and was running. And truly it did be\r\nan Humpt Man, and came forward very silent and with a quick slyness, as\r\nthat he did track the Maid secretly; for he lookt alway to the earth.\r\nAnd I perceived that he was that one of the Humpt Men which the Maid had\r\ncut with the knife; for the blood did show upon the shoulder and the\r\nbreast; and this bleeding mayhap to have slowed the Man; so that Mine\r\nOwn did be like to have supposed she had come utter free; yet he to have\r\nfound her, by tracking, as I perceived.\r\n\r\nAnd I strave to my feet, that I should come to the Maid, before the\r\nHumpt Man; and surely I gat upright, and went with a strange running,\r\nand did roll, and lo! I fell immediate, ere I was come to her. And the\r\nHumpt Man to run also; and surely it did be a dreadful race; for I went\r\ncreeping and did be weak and as that I was of lead. And the Humpt Man\r\ncame very swift and brutish; but I came the first to Mine Own Maid. And\r\nI rose up at the Humpt Man, upon my knees, and I swung the Diskos, and\r\nthe great weapon did roar in my hands, as that it did know and did live.\r\nAnd the Humpt Man ran in upon me; but I smote him truly with the Diskos,\r\nand he ran past me, all blundering, and fell and died upon his face, a\r\nlittle way off.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! my wounds had brake out into a great bleeding, and my head did\r\nroll upon my shoulders. And I lookt down dull, yet with an utter great\r\nlove upon Mine Own; and there did be no proper wound upon her; but yet\r\nwas she all bruised and knockt and marked with the trees, and where she\r\ndid fall in her running. And she did be there, very still and dear, and\r\nI to have brake my heart with love for her, but that I did be so dulled,\r\nas I have told.\r\n\r\nAnd I fought that I should be strong a little while more against my\r\nweakness; and I strove that I set mine ear gently upon her breast, that\r\nI should listen for her heart. But my head did go downward something\r\nclumsy and heavy upon her; and I then to hearken, and surely she did\r\nlive and her heart did beat; though, in verity, mine ears did have at\r\nfirst a thundering; but afterward a quietness in them, that made the\r\nsounding of her pulsing to seem an utter long way off; and very faint it\r\ndid be. And surely, in that moment, even as I harked, I was gone over\r\ninto a deadness, and had no more knowing; neither to have even a\r\nknowledge that I did be slipt from my senses. And, behold, the Maid did\r\nlie swooning; and I to be there in my broken armour, and my head upon\r\nthe breast of Mine Own, and likewise to know naught; and about us the\r\nquietness of that Country, and the far noise of the great Fire-Hills\r\nthat did sound through Eternity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nON THE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I came unto my senses, and did be in pain and a great forgetfulness\r\nand bewilderment. And I strove that I rise; but did be held by a strange\r\nforce, that did be surely my weakness, as I to know afterward.\r\n\r\nAnd I was upon my back; and a little sound did be near me, as that\r\nsomething did pant. And I turned my head, very slow, because that I did\r\nso lack of strength. And lo! I saw that the Maid did be anigh to me, and\r\ndid be yet naked; and did pant, and pusht hard and desperate with a\r\ngreat pole, which did be surely that one which I had cut when that the\r\nHumpt Men came upon us. And therewith I remembered all, and perceived\r\nthat I did be upon the raft, and the Maid to push the raft along with\r\nthe pole.\r\n\r\nAnd, at that, I made a little sound with my mouth; but the Maid not to\r\nhear me; for she did look backward, as I should think to the shore; and\r\nher face did be very set and anxious; and there to be a far noise of\r\nhowling, that I knew to be the voices of the Humpt Men; and so to\r\nperceive that the Maid had come unto her senses, and had gat me somewise\r\nto the raft, whilst that I did yet be swoond. And thus to save me ere\r\nthe Humpt Men had come. But, in verity, how she did this thing, I never\r\nto learn; neither she to know, but only that her love did give her a\r\ngreat and desperate strength that she save me, that did be her man.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, Mine Own Maid did tell me how that she had come into her\r\nsenses, and did be there upon the earth, and somewhat did be upon her\r\nbreast; and she saw that it was my head which did be heavy upon her, and\r\nI to be surely gone out from this life; for I was so still.\r\n\r\nAnd she came from under me, and did ease me out upon the earth, and her\r\nheart nigh brake, because that I was so be-bled, and my blood to have\r\nstained all that did be near. But when she had gat me restful, she saw\r\nthat I did surely live; and a great hope to spring in her heart. And\r\noft, as she had eased me, she had lookt about, and there did be naught\r\nto the sight, save the body of the Humpt Man anigh, and the others dead\r\nabout and upon the flat-topped rock, as you to mind.\r\n\r\nAnd she ran then very speedy to the raft, and brought water from the\r\nriver in my headpiece, and she dasht the water upon me; but I to have no\r\npower to come unto my senses. And lo! in that moment, she to know by\r\nsome subtile telling of the spirit, that there came some danger anigh;\r\nand she then to make that she save me, or that we die both of us\r\ntogether. And she strave with me, and did carry and draw me that\r\nweariful way unto the raft. And she gat me on to the raft; and she ran\r\nthen for the pole that did be beside the rock; and whilst that she took\r\nthe pole, she perceived her torn garments, that did be yet in the hands\r\nof the Humpt Man, even as she had slipt them to escape him. And she\r\ncaught the garments very hasty from the hand of the Man, and ran then to\r\nthe raft; and she pusht the raft out from the shore, and leaped aboard;\r\nand behold! as she made to use the pole, there came a sound out of the\r\nwood. And there ran from the wood the two Humpt Men that did yet live;\r\nand they to have trackt her, after that she did run from them; and they\r\nran downward to the shore, very silent and intent upon her; but she to\r\nwork with an utter despair, and to have the raft a good way out, ere\r\nthey did be come. And surely, they either to have no power of swimming,\r\nor to know that there did be a Dread in the water; for they made not to\r\ncome after; but did stand and stare very stupid, and afterward to howl;\r\nand this howling I did hear when that I was come unto myself upon the\r\nraft, as you do know. And by this telling, you to be so wise as I; for\r\nmore I know not, save odd things that I did learn afterward, that did\r\nbut set my love more holy unto Mine Own Maid; and these to have been but\r\nsmall matters of love-thoughts that we did have together; and scarce\r\nclear unto my remembering.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! even as I harked unto the howling of the Humpt Men, the sound\r\ndid grow more faint and far off; for the Maid worked very desperate with\r\nthe pole. And I did feel that I would help her; but yet was so a-lack;\r\nand surely, even as I did mean to rise, I was gone again utter from my\r\nsenses; and that dear naked One did pilot me safe and loving unto the\r\nsafe harbouring of the little island, that you do mind; and had no\r\nthought unto herself; but only that she save me. And I to be there,\r\nscarce offward from my death, and to have no knowing of aught, and no\r\nmore power to help or to be a shield unto Mine Own; but did be only an\r\nhelpless man, that had surely died, save for the care of My Beloved.\r\n\r\nYet did I fight a good fight, and have alway a great joy in the\r\nremembering.\r\n\r\nNow, I mind nothing very clear after this for a great time; but only of\r\npain and weariness, and of half wakings and times when I did know\r\nnaught, and others when that I did be awake, yet did have no realness,\r\neither in myself or in any land or place; and all to come back strange\r\nand vague; yet with a constant knowing that there went Love about me,\r\nand a great and gentle watchfulness; so that I was eased when that the\r\nblack mists of my weakness did uprise about me to swamp me; and I was\r\nmade to know hope, when that unknown despairs did live stealthy within\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! there came a time when I waked, and did be freed of uncertain\r\nburdenings and peculiar woes and that still haze through which great\r\nachings did come constant upon me. And surely, I was laid very nice upon\r\nsomewhat that did be soft, and there went a sweet quietness about me,\r\nand an healthful drowse did grow in my bones.\r\n\r\nAnd slowly I perceived that the Maid did kneel beside me, and did look\r\nupon me with so great a love and gladness that it did be as that I drank\r\nin health and a drowsy joy and peace. And surely, she stoopt and kiss me\r\nwith an utter gentle love, upon my mouth, and her tears to go sweet upon\r\nmy face; and truly I kist her again, with an utter content.\r\n\r\nAnd she took my head in the comfort of her arm, and gave me somewhat\r\nthat I drink; and when I had drunk, she kiss me once again, so light as\r\nthat a pretty wind did blow hushed upon my lips. And my head she made\r\neasy; and lo! I was gone over unto sleep, even as she tended me.\r\n\r\nAnd thrice do I mind that this to happen; and at the third time, I knew\r\nthat my strength was come something into me again; and I moved my hand a\r\nlittle, this way and that; and she to know that I did need her to hold\r\nmy hand; and she to do this, and I to go into sleep again, even while\r\nthat I look sleepy, yet with all my love, into her eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd when I waked for the fourth time, I did whisper that I loved her;\r\nand surely she broke into a sudden weeping, and did hold my hand very\r\ndear against her breast.\r\n\r\nAnd when I waked for the fifth time, I to know how things did be about\r\nme, and that I did lie naked in the cloak, and did be all bandaged about\r\nmy body; and the bandages, as I did know afterward, did be from the torn\r\ngarments of the Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd I look at the Maid, and knew that she did be drest again, and did be\r\nin the garments that I did give to her, as you to mind; which did be\r\nthat one, and the inner, that the Humpt Man tore from her, and which she\r\nhad slipt, that she escape from the Man.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I found that she had made a very cunning mend of the\r\ngarments, whilst that she did sit so utter long beside me to tend me;\r\nfor she had gotten threads from her torn garments, and had made needles\r\nfrom thorns that did grow on the little bushes of the island; and the\r\nthorns did brake oft, and she then to have another, and so to persist an\r\nhundred times. And this way she did be drest very nice and dainty.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own Maid perceived how that I lookt with interest at her, and\r\ndid mind, very natural, how that I last to have seen her; and she then\r\nto blush gently; and did kiss me, that she have her pretty face\r\nsomething from mine eyes. And truly, I to wish the more that I be\r\nstrong, that I kneel in a glad reverence unto her; for this way did be\r\nmy love, and ever so; and you likewise, that have truly loved.\r\n\r\nNow I did begin that I grew very steady unto my strength, again, and\r\nMine Own Maid did tend me alway, and she gave me a broth of tablets and\r\nthe water at set times, by the telling of my timepiece. And oft she\r\nwasht me and did change the bandages, and did wash and dry the bandages,\r\nthat she use them over again; for we did be so lacking for such matters,\r\nas you to know.\r\n\r\nAnd on the fifth day, I was come utter to ease; and did be wondrous\r\nhappy, and Mine Own to make pretty talk unto me; but had me to be alway\r\nquiet, because that I did be yet so weak.\r\n\r\nAnd on the sixth day, I to be let answer Mine Own, and to say how great\r\nI did love her, the which mine eyes had said alway, while that I did lie\r\nin silence. And I to be assured by the Maid that she did be in health,\r\nand recovered; but indeed, I saw that she was gone very thin, and that\r\nher eyes did be weary, even while that they had so great a love and a\r\ngladness to me.\r\n\r\nAnd I made Mine Own to bring her tablets by me, as she did alway, and\r\nwhen that I had kist them, and she to have eat and drunk, I bade her to\r\nmake me the broth ready; and when she had made the broth, I askt that\r\nthe Diskos be set anigh to me. And afterward, I bid her to my side, and\r\nhad her to lie by me; and I took her pretty head upon mine arm, and told\r\nher that she to lie thus and to sleep, and to have no fear that she\r\nweary me; for that I to be but the more rested to have her so, beside\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnd she in the first to trouble that she be too heavy for mine arm; but\r\ntruly, I showed that my strength was something come back to me; for I\r\nprest her gentle unto me, and she then to nestle content, and to be gone\r\ninto an utter sleep, and to have been in a sore need of the same.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own did sleep for twelve great hours, and had scarce any life\r\nin all that time, save when once she did make a little and gentle\r\nmoaning, and did afterward set her pretty face more nigh to me in her\r\nsleep. And surely, I had neither weariness nor lonesomeness; but did lie\r\nwith an utter content; and did look downward upon the Maid, where she\r\ndid sleep in the hollow of mine arm; and truly she did be most wondrous\r\nlovely and dainty; and the goodness of her face did seem as that it made\r\nan holiness about my heart, so that my spirit was uplift in a quiet and\r\nconstant glory of love.\r\n\r\nAnd I drank a part of the broth at the third hour, and at the sixth\r\nhour, and at the ninth hour, when that I finished it; and my right arm\r\ndid be free to this purpose and to the Diskos; and surely I did twice\r\nand thrice set my hand upon that great weapon, as to a true comrade;\r\nand, in verity, I could think the weapon did know and did love me. And\r\nthis thinking to be because I did be so uplift, as I have told; yet\r\ntruly, the Diskos did be a strange and wondrous thing, and did be alway\r\nthought to have an oneness with the man that did use it.\r\n\r\nAnd in the twelfth hour, the Maid awoke sudden, and came upward out of\r\nmine arm, all in a sweet haste, that she know that I did be well; and\r\nshe did be eased wondrous, when that she saw how I laughed with a quiet\r\njoy but to see her dear eyes, and her pretty trouble. Yet did she be in\r\nreproach to herself, when that she lookt to find how the hours had past.\r\nBut, indeed, I did make a mocking sternness with her; and forbad that\r\nshe even to say one little word more upon this matter; but to be glad\r\nthat I did be so utter happy, and she likewise.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, when I had said this, that impudent Maid did set her little\r\nfist against my nose, and to threaten me. And, in verity, I laught so\r\nhearty that the Maid did be in fear I should set my wounds again to\r\nbleed, and did reproach herself again; but, in truth, I came to no harm.\r\n\r\nAnd when that I could speak, I askt the Maid whether that there had been\r\nbrothers to her, because that she did play so natural. And this I askt,\r\nnot thinking; and lo! in a moment I perceived my thoughtlessness; but\r\nsaid naught, save to take the hand of Mine Own, that she know utter that\r\nI did not be heartless. And she to nod very quiet, and afterward kist my\r\nhand, and slipt from me. And I knew that she was gone a little way off,\r\nlest she weep; and I did be in trouble for her and for mine a-lackness;\r\nbut truly I could do naught, only that I called very gentle unto her.\r\n\r\nAnd she to return soon, and did smile loving and cheerful upon me; but,\r\nindeed, I saw that she covered her weeping, whilst that she had made me\r\nnew broth. Yet, before I would take the broth, I would have her to mine\r\narms; and she to submit very glad and happy, but to keep her pretty\r\nweight from me, lest she hurt my woundings.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, we both to eat, and be happy in glad talk.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I did sleep; but would have her to be nigh to me, even\r\nthough she did be wakeful; and so we to be utter content together.\r\n\r\nNow, the seventh day, as it might be called, was a wondrous happy time;\r\nand when I waked, the Maid did be sleeping as a child to my side, and\r\nher face nestled against me. And she to waken in a moment; for thus had\r\nshe drowsed and watched through all the hours whilst that I had slept.\r\n\r\nAnd we then to eat and to drink together, after that Mine Own had made\r\nme easy with a gentle washing and care. And I now to be allowed that I\r\nhave my tablets whole, and the water afterward, as when that I did be\r\nwell; and this to please me, as you shall think; for I did ache that I\r\nbe strong very speedy, that I have power to guard Mine Own Maid again,\r\nand to go forward with our journeying, that I have the Maid unto the\r\nsafeness of the Mighty Pyramid; and surely, now that I had my tablets\r\nwhole, I to feel that I did grow near unto fitness again; and moreover,\r\nthey did satisfy my hunger the better than the broth.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid to give me my tablets oft, so that I eat a great many; and\r\nI did make her to count; and surely there did be sufficient, if that I\r\nget strong pretty quick. And so I made no refusing of the tablets; for I\r\ndid need them, that I make blood again within me, else should I be\r\nlacking, when that there came any need anigh.\r\n\r\nAnd we kist each the tablets of the other, and did drink from the same\r\ncup, and did be utter happy; and did be part like children, but also to\r\nbe man and maid.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, the Maid did shift my bandages, as alway, and washt me\r\nproper, and had me into comfort. But she did keep me alway very\r\nlow-lying; and truly I scarce to mind; for I was not gotten enough of my\r\nstrength, to give me to feel irked. And further, as you shall think,\r\nthere did be that lovely One with me alway; and did make sweet quips\r\nunto me, and talkt and did laugh, and oft did come into singing; for she\r\ndid be so sweetly joyed that I was in life and did mend so proper.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, she went off from me a little, to her toilet; but I to\r\nask that she be so swift as might be, and she to promise very merry; and\r\nshe came back in a little while, and her hair to be in a lovely cloud\r\nabout her shoulders, and her pretty feet yet to be bared from her bath,\r\nwhich she had in a pool beyond some bushes; and she to say that I did be\r\nso impatient a man, that she to be forced that she do the half of her\r\ndressing with me; but truly, she came thiswise only because she to know\r\nhow I did delight in her thus, and to watch the way that she set up her\r\nabundance of hair; and she to be hungry also that she be with me, and to\r\nlove me that I watch her, even while that there did be oft a little and\r\nquaint stirring of shyness in her dear heart.\r\n\r\nAnd I had her to come beside me, and to sit anigh to my hand; and I made\r\npresently that I did scold her, because that she had no proper care to\r\nher pretty feet; and I bid her to set her feet toward me, that I look\r\nthe more close at them. And she to be a pretty rogue, and did think I to\r\nmean to kiss them--and truly not to think alway wrong--but I then to\r\nhave another planning; for I had pluckt a hair very sly from her head,\r\nand she but to have said an Oh! to me, and to have thought no more. But,\r\nindeed, when that she gave her feet to me, I held them so strong as I\r\nmight, and I bound her pretty toes together with the hair; and surely\r\nshe did be a captive unto me, and we to laugh, as that we to be both\r\nchildren. And afterward she stole back her feet from me; but, in verity,\r\nI knew that she had a wondrous heed that she brake not the hair that\r\nbound her; but did sit beside me bound in that pretty way; but yet to\r\nhide from me that she did not brake the hair.\r\n\r\nAnd she then to do her hair upon her head, very lovely; and afterward,\r\nI put up my hands, and took it down again; and she then to kiss me and\r\nto ask how that she should ever have it proper upon her head, if that I\r\ndid alway so tease her.\r\n\r\nAnd she then to take her hair, and did set the abundance of it upon both\r\nsides of my face, and then to kiss me, as I did look up at her, from out\r\nof so much beauty.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward she cut a lock of my hair, and a lock from her own dear\r\nhead; and she did plait the two locks together, so that our hair did\r\nblend and be together; and afterward she hid it in her bosom. But I did\r\nbe then out of content, and would have done likewise, only that it did\r\nso weary me to uphold my hands; and she to cut a second lock from my\r\nhead, and a second tress of her own most lovely hair; and she made me to\r\nkiss the hair that did be from her, and she then to kiss the hair that\r\ndid be from me; and afterward, she did plait them together, and gave\r\nthem to me. And I set the hair, for that time, under the great bandage\r\nthat went over my heart; and truly, she did be then the one that lackt\r\ncontent; for she to say that the second plaiting did be kist, and the\r\nfirst to lack; but I to refuse to exchange; so that we made up a\r\nquarrelling, and did presently have to be kist, unto forgiveness. And,\r\ntruly, have you not likewise known such glad foolishness, when that you\r\nwere in the love-days.\r\n\r\nAnd she then to make me to be quiet, and to keep my hands downward from\r\nher hair, because that the uplifting did prove overmuch to me; and she\r\ntook my great hands then, and did threaten how dreadful she use me, if\r\nthat I be not humble. And truly, I said that I did be an humble man; and\r\nshe then to hold my hands with but one small one; and surely, her hand\r\ndid be so small that she not able to hold me, save by the thumbs. And\r\nshe then with her free hand to cover mine eyes, so that I might not see;\r\nand whilst that she did hold me thus so utter helpless, she to kiss me\r\nvery dainty and impudent upon the mouth; and afterward she loost me, and\r\ndid be demure.\r\n\r\nAnd we did be then silent a space; and presently, I put forth my hand,\r\nthat did be very great, yet to be gone white and to tremble, because\r\nthat I did lack so utter of blood. And the Maid to know what I did mean,\r\nand she clenched her hands into two fists, and set them both into my one\r\nhand, and surely they did be little fists; and I then to be happy; for\r\nthis did be a wondrous pleasure alway unto me; and she to have her lids\r\na little downward upon her eyes, and to be quietly happy. And, truly,\r\nhow I mind it all so plain.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, I did plague her very gentle that she to be all a-lack,\r\nif that she did try to use her hands to aught, because that they did be\r\nso small. And she in a moment to have her two arms very dear about my\r\nneck, and did kiss me with an utter love and tenderness upon the mouth,\r\nand afterward went from me, lest that she have me to overset myself.\r\n\r\nAnd I did then to make her to sit by me, and I did tell her a tale how\r\nthat a young man did once live in the olden days, and did meet with the\r\nOne Maid Upon All The Earth. And how that they loved and did be married,\r\nand she to die, and of the utter and desperate madness of grief that\r\nnigh destroyed the man; and how that he sudden to wake into the future\r\nof the world, in a New Time, and did come to learn that His Own did also\r\nto live in that Time. And he then to make that he find her; and did\r\ntruly come unto her. And how she did be different in her beauty; but yet\r\nto be utter lovely. And the man did hold an utter reverence to the Maid,\r\nthat had been his wife in the olden dream-days, so that his reverence of\r\nlove did live in him like a constant pain and anguish of sweetness and\r\ntrouble, and of holy thoughts that did be bred of her lovely\r\ncompanionship, and of his memories.... But, in truth, I gat not further\r\nin the tale than this; for Mine Own did have come sudden into weeping,\r\nand had gotten to her knees, and did hold my hand against her breast,\r\nand did put her hand gentle upon my lips. And, in a moment, she to\r\nwhisper somewhat through her tears; and there to be dear Motherhood\r\nwithin her face; and a sudden shining of Memory in her eyes, that had\r\nbeen near dreadful, only that it did seem to be to her as that she were\r\npart dreaming. And the strange and solemn pain did come also unto me\r\nthrough the part-open gateways of my Memory. And I to remember very\r\nclear and with an anguish in that moment. And I told Mine Own how that\r\nthe babe had gone onward, after that the Beloved had died. And there did\r\nbe then an utter quiet upon us.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! sudden the Maid did bend unto me, and I to take her into mine\r\narms, out of the vague dreamings of her Memory-dreams. But, ere she did\r\nbe come outward entire from the haze of the Past, she to try to set\r\nsomewhat into words concerning this memory-vision of the babe; but\r\nsomeways to be strangely dumb. And I did be silent likewise, because of\r\nall those things that did be between us forever and forever.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, she kist me, and was herself again; and she went from me\r\nto attend unto our food.\r\n\r\nNow, that did be truly a lovely day; for I to have gat sufficient of\r\nstrength that I did be able to have interest, and talk with Mine Own\r\nMaid; and she now to be well rest, and to have ease in her dear heart\r\nconcerning me.\r\n\r\nAnd surely we oft to laugh, and did make jests utter glad and foolish.\r\nAnd indeed, I do mind how that I askt Mine Own an olden puzzle, that did\r\ncome out of the vagueness of my Memory-dreams. And she to be like a\r\nperson that doth hear a strange familiar thing; and lo! sudden she to\r\nsay, as that she gat knowledge from beyond Eternity, that it did be when\r\nthat he was a little hoarse. And you to know the jest, and to have\r\ntroubled it oft at school; but, in verity, it did be a strange thing to\r\nhave from our Memories out of all the deep of Time. And we, in truth,\r\nnever in that Age to have seen or to have known that ever there did be\r\nan Horse, or to mind the likeness of one. And this to be but a little\r\nmatter; yet of strange and peculiar interest, as you to agree. And,\r\nindeed, we did both to look one at the other, when that we had ended,\r\nand did wonder what an horse did be; yet in the same time did have a\r\nvague inward knowing.\r\n\r\nAnd so we to look ever backward through dim Ages; and surely we gat\r\npresently from jests, unto solemnness; and the Maid to be nigh again\r\nunto tears. And, in truth, I then to bring our thoughts and our speech\r\nforward from the Abyss of the Years, and did cease from Memory-dreaming\r\nfor that time; and so to have the Maid again in joy; yet mayhap\r\nsomething wistful odd whiles.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I to tell the Maid an hundred thousand things concerning\r\nthe Mighty Pyramid, of which I had so oft said somewhat; but never to\r\nhave gat so great a chance as this unto a plenty of time and so nice an\r\noneness in the way that our minds did go.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, the Maid did be eager in a moment, and did be husht; and\r\nagain to ask constant concerning all matters.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, there went a great while this way; and the Maid to have\r\nan utter wonder and excitement of all that I to tell; for truly, it did\r\nbe as that a man of this age should come downward from a great star in\r\nthe heavens, and to tell of wonders and new things; and you to\r\nunderstand how she did feel.\r\n\r\nAnd of all things that did most have a happiness unto the Maid, I to\r\nperceive that the great Life and Humanness of the Millions to dwell\r\nwithin her imaginings as a cloud of warmth and quiet joy; for I did show\r\nthis thing to her, so well as I was able; and, in truth, you shall tell\r\nme in honesty whether that I have made the same likewise clear-seen unto\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nAnd she, as you shall mind, did be a maid that had grown all her life in\r\na Refuge that did be shaken with hauntings, because that it lackt the\r\npower of the Earth-Current to protect; and with a People that did be\r\nweak-conceived through great thousands of years; and where love did\r\nbloom something faded, even in youth; and youth to have lack of the\r\nlife-blood of an utter joy, such as did be ours and likewise to many\r\nthat did be of the Mighty Pyramid.\r\n\r\nThough, truly, there did go millions then, as now, that did never to\r\nknow love; though the name did be in their mouths, and they to have\r\nbelief that the sweet kernel did be in their hearts; but, in verity,\r\nTHIS to be love, that your life shall bound in you with abundance, and\r\njoy dwell round you, and your spirit to live in a natural holiness with\r\nthe Beloved, and your bodies to be a sweet and natural delight that\r\nshall never be lost of a lovely mystery that doth hold a perfect peace\r\neach unto the need of the other; and all to be that there go round\r\nabout you a wonder and a splendour all the days and the nights that you\r\nshall be--the Man with the Woman, the Woman with the Man. And Shame to\r\nbe unborn, and all things to go natural and wholesome, out of an utter\r\ngreatness of understanding; and the Man to be an Hero and a Child before\r\nthe Woman; and the Woman to be an Holy Light of the Spirit and an utter\r\nCompanion and in the same time a glad Possession unto the Man. And lo!\r\nif one to die, then the soul of the other shall fail; and that one never\r\nto have full life again, in that bitter parting. And this doth be the\r\ntrue Human Love; and all else that be not like to this with the Man and\r\nwith the Woman, doth be but a borrowing of the name of Love for that\r\nquiet desiring, which is but an Endurance beside Love, which doth be\r\nbetween they that be not mated both in their souls and in their bodies.\r\nAnd this telling to take no heed to those base joinings that be made for\r\npurposes of wealth or Desire or other piteous ends; for, in verity,\r\nthese to have no more dealings with the thing that I do tell upon, than\r\nhath the merchanting of goods, or the _need_ of a glutton. But the thing\r\nthat I do have upon my heart doth be that dear and uplifting Power of\r\nLove, which I to set forth in this mine own story; for, in truth, I to\r\nhave known love, and to need death when that I be parted from Mine Own.\r\n\r\nNow, surely, Mine Own did come twice and thrice unto weeping, as I did\r\ntell of this thing and that, which did set her memory backward unto the\r\nways of the Lesser Redoubt. And presently, I did cease from my tellings,\r\nbecause that she did so be gone into pain of her memories. But, indeed,\r\nshe then to beg me that I go forward again; for, truly, she to need in\r\nthe heart that she know, and to strive to be no more in grief for the\r\ntelling.\r\n\r\nAnd I then to say on, and did tell upon the Might and Wonder and great\r\nOlden Delight of the Underground Fields, that were below the Great\r\nRedoubt, as you do know. And I told how that they went downward an\r\nhundred strange miles, that did be dug of the labour of Millions and of\r\nthe years of Eternity.\r\n\r\nAnd I set out unto Mine Own concerning that there did be wondrous\r\nvillages spread through that great and hidden Country that did be in the\r\nunderground; and how that great millions of the Peoples did live there,\r\nand made a constant labour in those deep Lands and Countries, that did\r\nbe truly so monstrous in all as an huge Continent.\r\n\r\nAnd I showed Mine Own how that there did be wondrous processes that did\r\nbe learned in the Ages; and how that water did be made in chemistry; and\r\ntruly she to nod to this, because that she did mind upon the powder that\r\nwe did use; but truly the powder to have to be made in the first, as you\r\nshall think; and we but to advantage ourselves of that which did result,\r\nand I to speak to her of the making of the powder, rather than of the\r\nway that it afterward to make chemistry with the air, unto water.\r\n\r\nAnd I told the Maid how that there did be mighty underground pipes that\r\nwent across the Night Land, and did be, mayhap, oft so much as twenty\r\ngreat miles deep in the world, and did come upward into the seas of the\r\nLand; and all to have been made secret and hid from the monsters of the\r\nLand, as I to know from much readings of the Histories.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own then to tell me that they did lack to have any such great\r\nwonders below the Lesser Redoubt; but that there did be utter monstrous\r\ncaverns, where that there had been alway a strange and uncouth Country\r\nof Husbandry, and lit from the Earth-Current; and they also there to\r\nbury their Dead. And all had been a-lack through great thousands of\r\nyears, as she did know of their Records, and had grown dim-lit and\r\nlonesome, and a Land of deepness to starve the spirit with an utter\r\nstrangeness and discomfort, where that the men went quietly as ghosts,\r\nthrough many ages; and all a place in dire want of sound and laughter.\r\n\r\nYet this all to have been surely different a monstrous Age gone, when\r\nthat the Earth-Current did be a power in the Lesser Redoubt, and the\r\nHumans to be in plenty, and of good and natural health and courage of\r\nlife. And, truly, to mind upon that Place, doth alway to set a fresh\r\nwonder in me, that Mine Own did be so lovely and wholesome of spirit and\r\nwise and in knowledge and good force of her being. But so it did be with\r\nher; and she to have been surely alway That One that did be Mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd I then to tell Mine Own Maid concerning the lowest Field, which did\r\nbe the Country of Silence, and was the Place of Memory unto all the\r\ngreat Millions, where did linger and bide the ghosts of an hundred\r\nbillion griefs and the drifted thoughts of sorrowful hearts; and there\r\nto live a great hallowedness and a mystery of silence and an holiness\r\nand a Greatness, as that it did be the Expressing of all that doth be\r\nNoble and Everlasting that ever did come out of the heart of Man and all\r\nthe lost Dead of Eternity; so that the spirit of a man did seem to go on\r\ngreat wings, unto lovely and splendid resolvings, if that he but to walk\r\nlonely awhile in that Country, that surely did be never lonesome unto\r\nthe spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! the Maid did be all husht, as I did speak, and did look downward\r\nunto me with her eyes very bright, and lovely with the thinkings and\r\ntears that did stir within her.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden she to ask whether that I did make my resolve to my journey,\r\nwhilst that I walkt in that place; and she to look very intent and\r\nbeautiful upon me, as she did question. And, indeed, I saw that she to\r\nmean a lovely praise unto me, as you to perceive; and truly, I did feel\r\na little strange, as that I did be both glad and shy in the same moment.\r\nAnd she then to ease me of any answer; for she gat upward upon her\r\nknees, and she put her two hands to the sides of my face, and bid me to\r\nlook into her eyes and to know that she loved me with her soul and with\r\nall that did make her to be.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, she kist me very gentle upon the forehead, and did be\r\nthen husht awhile, as that she to be in thought; yet oft she did look\r\ndownward at me, and did have a beauty of love and honour within her\r\neyes, so that they alway to shine, as she did look at me.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, the Maid did sit again beside me, and slipt her two hands\r\ninto the one of mine, as did be ever my desire, and she to love that she\r\ngive me this delight, and likewise, she to have joy to herself in this\r\nlovingness.\r\n\r\nAnd we then again to have talk; and I did tell Mine Own somewhat of the\r\nHistory of the Olden World! and she did have dim memories, as in dreams,\r\nof the days of light; yet scarce that she could believe it of truth. But\r\nshe to have knowledge of the Olden Love Days within her spirit, and to\r\nmind that there did be alway, as it did be, a lovely and golden light\r\nupon the world; but she not to know truly whether this to be but the\r\nholy glamour-light that Memory doth set about a past loveliness; and to\r\nhave no remembering of the Sun; but yet to be made ready by her memories\r\nunto believing. And I to know of certainty; but yet even I that do tell\r\nthis My Tale, did but perceive the Days of the Light, as in a far and\r\nvague dream; and to remember it but in the chief by the glory of lost\r\nsunsets that had cast an holiness upon my heart, and of the hush of\r\nDawns that had made ready my spirit in the Gone Ages to look quietly\r\nunto my death.\r\n\r\nAnd surely you to go with me in all this thing, and to have felt within\r\nyour own spirit that uplifted wonder that doth shake the soul with the\r\nlost Beginning and with the unknown End, when that you have lookt\r\nthrough the sorrow of the Sunset, and stood silent before the Quiet\r\nVoice that doth make promise in the Dawn.\r\n\r\nBut, in verity, we that had near lost our Memory of the surety of these\r\ngreat wonders, did have memory of Love; and this to be most beautiful\r\nunto my heart; for it but to show the more how that love doth live\r\nforever, and doth make an holiness in all places; and doth give\r\nCompanionship and Satisfying; so that to have love, is to have all, and\r\nto have escaped this Wonder is to have missed to have Lived.\r\n\r\nAnd I to find then that Mine Own did have no knowledge of the way that\r\nthe World did be in that Future Age; and did lack to know that there\r\nabode mightily above us in the everlasting night, the dead starkness of\r\nthe world, where did be--mayhap two hundred great miles above us--snow\r\nand the eternal desolation of a lost world, that did be once the lovely\r\nworld of the olden days, which did be now given over unto Night and\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nAnd mayhap there did wander upward there Memory, and did go companioned\r\nby Grief. But, indeed, I to delight to think that Hope and Love did\r\nbuild houses of joy about the Dead; and there to be no true death; but\r\nonly the dying of days. Yet, surely, this doth be sorrow enough unto the\r\nheart and the soul, if that they did be days when love did make a\r\nmystery of light about the spirit, and the Beloved to have been anigh to\r\nmake ever a sweet wonder unto the heart.\r\n\r\nBut I to cease from these thoughts; for we to face our life brave and\r\nwise, and to take both the sorrow and the joy unto our developing, and\r\nto hold up the face with courage when that Grief doth come anigh; and to\r\nsee that we grow not to bitterness, but unto sweet wholesomeness. And\r\nthere to be Joy again, and we then the better abled to have that delight\r\ninto our hearts; for how shall Joy ever to come truly again to that\r\nheart which bitterness hath made a place for the abode of sorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, I to cease from these thinkings also; for my story to wait\r\nupon me, and these things that I do say do be plain unto you, and to\r\nhave no need to the telling.\r\n\r\nAnd so did I tell Mine Own Maid of the things that I did learn from the\r\nlittle metal book; and she to be in a constant wonder and delight and\r\nwith an awe and newness upon her. And sudden, there did some olden\r\nmemory stir within her; for she askt me, in one instant, whether that I\r\ndid remember when that the Cities did move alway unto the Westward.\r\n\r\nBut truly I had no remembering of this thing, and did look at her\r\nawhile, with somewhat of a trouble upon me; for, that there should be\r\naught lacking in my memory of those times that we did be together upon\r\nthis world, was a fear unto me, and a vague sorrow alway, if that I did\r\nbut to let my thought go that way; though, indeed, I did ever strive to\r\nwiseness, and did have knowledge that there doth be an heart-wearing and\r\ndespair and needless trouble in vain regrets; but yet these to be\r\nnatural unto the spirit, if that you to know love; and do be but the\r\ncomplement of the love-joy, and mayhap to have a use unto the sweetening\r\nof the spirit, if that they be not let to over-ride the reason.\r\n\r\nAnd whilst that I did look unto Mine Own, that she help me to remember,\r\nshe did strive with her Memory. But in the end, did fail to come unto\r\naught of clearness, save that she did see, as in a far dream, yet very\r\nplain, a great metal roadway, set in two lines that went forever unto\r\nthe setting Sun; and she then sudden to say that she did see in her\r\nmemory the Sun, and she to have a strange and troubled amazement upon\r\nher. And there did be Cities upon the great road; and the houses did be\r\nstrange-seeming, and did move forward eternally and at a constant speed;\r\nand behind them the Night did march forever; and they to have an even\r\npace with the sun, that they live ever in the light, and so to escape\r\nthe night which pursued forever, as she did tell, and a dread and\r\nterrible chill that did live in the night. And there did be cities far\r\nforward in the morning Sunshine, that did have gone before at speed, and\r\nset the husbandry of the world, and to be finished and gone forward\r\nagain ere that certain of the latter cities did come to that place to\r\nthe reaping; and the night to come presently to that place; but this not\r\nto be for some part of a year after that the crops were taken. But how\r\nlong this might be, she not to remember.\r\n\r\nAnd all this the Maid did say to me, as out of a strange dream, and I to\r\nhave set it down, and to have made it so clear to you as she to have\r\ntold it; and surely it doth be plain then that she to speak of a time\r\nwhen that the day did be grown to a monstrous length, because that the\r\nworld did turn but slow and weary.\r\n\r\nAnd it to be a sureness, as you shall perceive, that but to stand still\r\nin that age of which Naani told, was to be left presently in an utter\r\nnight and chill, that should last mayhap a great and weary year. And, in\r\nverity, it doth seem that all Humanity did travel forever in that\r\nstrange age, when that to stay was to die unprepared in the bitter\r\nnight, and to go forward, was to be forever in the sun. And truly, this\r\ndoth be so strange seeming to me, as to you.\r\n\r\nAnd much I questioned the Maid, and did have an hurt within my heart,\r\nand a pain of jealousy and sadness to grow in me; for surely she did\r\nspeak of some life that she did live, when that I did be elsewhere,\r\neither in Life or Unknowing. And, in verity, what man then should have\r\ntaught Mine Own to love him? And she then mayhap to have had no\r\nremembering of me.\r\n\r\nAnd truly I questioned very desperate, and the more so because that I\r\nwas yet weak, and lacking my strength to be composed. But she neither to\r\nremember me nor any other man of that time; and to have no memories,\r\nsave these bare things that she to have spoken out so strange, and which\r\ndid come sudden unto her out of all the deepness of the years and the\r\nlost sorrows and joys and wonders of that which doth make a World of\r\nHumans.\r\n\r\nAnd surely my questionings brought a distress upon Mine Own, both\r\nbecause that she did be troubled by the way that my love did bring me to\r\nthis strange anguish, and because that she also to have pain, and a\r\nsudden fear that there did be ever a time when she not to have known me,\r\nor to have permitted the arms of another.\r\n\r\nAnd she did then strive that she be both wise and strong, and to give\r\nhelp unto me, and to take reason unto her own easing. And truly she to\r\nshow how that she did be all unknowing of any love in that far backward\r\ntime; but it to be possible in reason that she to have gone to another,\r\nin natural course, the while that her heart did yearn alway in vague\r\ntrouble unto Her Own, that her spirit did mayhap never to have\r\nforgotten. And, truly, this doth be the way of Life, and a bitter thing\r\nand a sorrow to Joyous Love to think upon; yet I here to be set to the\r\ntellings of Truth, and to have heed to all that reason doth show to be.\r\n\r\nBut Mine Own did also have us both to remember that there did be equal\r\nright to think that she had died Mine Own Maid in that life; for that it\r\ndid be not out of reason to think that she had been void-hearted unto\r\nall men, because that she had known in her spirit that she did once to\r\nmeet Her Own, and did be thereafter untuned unto all other men that ever\r\ndid live. And this all to be in a mist, and we to go vainly. And of her\r\nwill, she did think that no man did ever to have possessed her, save I;\r\nyet this to be mayhaps only the prompting of her love; and she then to\r\nkiss me, and to say that there did be no surety in aught, but only that\r\nwe did have been together before, and have borne a love so great that it\r\ndid live through Eternity; and we to be now together, and maybe all else\r\nto be but dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd truly I did have a fierce hope that this be so; and the Maid\r\nlikewise so to hope, yet to be less bitter with rebellion than I, though\r\nin pain upon the thought; for she did be so utter and dreadful glad and\r\nin happy thankfulness that we did be now come together again in the end;\r\nand did mean that she conquer all that should be like to set a greyness\r\nupon our joy, and to be steadfast unto this end.\r\n\r\nAnd I afterward to be likewise in wisdom, when that I was come the more\r\nto strength, and to mind that I suffer vainly for that which did have no\r\nsurety, as I have shown; and moreover I did have no power upon the past,\r\neither to learn aught or to mend aught; so that I did go the way of an\r\nHuman, and did shake free from these broodings, and strove unto\r\nforgetfulness; which, in truth, doth be both a Terror and a\r\nMercifulness, as doth chance. And I kist Mine Own Maid, with somewhat\r\nmore of the years within my love; and she to kiss me very sober and\r\ndear; and to desire only for my happiness, and to be utter mine own.\r\n\r\nNow, we then to eat and to drink, and the Maid to see me unto comfort in\r\nall things, and my bandages all right; and she then to make that she\r\nhave on her footgear and her hair to be bound; but indeed I bid her that\r\nshe to dare do this thing, when that she to know how I did delight that\r\nher little feet be bare to mine eyes, and her hair most lovely upon her\r\nshoulders; and she to be very happy that I so to have an utter pleasure\r\nin her dear beauties, and did sit beside me again, and set her feet very\r\nsly where they did be anigh to my hand; for she to know that she did be\r\nMine Own, and I to be her Master, and she to have joy that she to have\r\nto render her beauty unto me; for she did be that true complement unto\r\nme that the heart of a man doth ache for eternally.\r\n\r\nAnd so, presently, did end that lovely day of quiet speech and\r\ntogetherness; and the Maid did prepare me for my slumber, and she then\r\nto lie anigh to me, and her head to rest gentle beside me, so that her\r\npretty face did be near unto my breast upon the right side; and she to\r\ngive me at the first a loving and sober kiss that did be somewise to set\r\na guard upon her tenderness, and afterward did sleep content and gentle,\r\nas that she did be in the same moment a child and a woman.\r\n\r\nAnd I also to come unto slumbering; yet did know vaguely how that Mine\r\nOwn did rise a little upon her elbow, this time and that, and look very\r\nloving into my face, that she have assurance of my comfort and\r\nwell-being; and once I did waken, proper, and lookt at her, and she then\r\nto kiss me gentle upon mine eyelids, and bid me to sleep; and so did\r\ncome herself unto her sweet slumber. Now when that I did come to my\r\nproper wakening, I to hear the fizzing of the water, and to know that\r\nthe Maid did be risen a good while, and had made her toilets, as I\r\nperceived in a moment, when that she came unto me; for her hair did be\r\nin a lovely cloud upon her shoulders, all combed and made ready against\r\nmy waking; and she to have bathed, as I supposed, in some warm pool that\r\ndid be among the bushes upon the island; and she now to slip her\r\nfoot-gear, that her feet be bare unto me, as I did love, and to stand a\r\nmoment, and her eyes to twinkle gently. And I lookt at her with love and\r\nhonour in mine eyes, as you shall know, and she to have dancing of sweet\r\npleasure in her heart, that I so to look upon her with holiness and with\r\nnatural love, and surely the last doth be unnatural if that it do lack\r\nthe first; but my love did burn upward out of my being, so that the\r\nflame of my spirit did light the fires of my heart, and my Reason to add\r\ncoals unto that fire that hath lived for ever, and doth be as that it\r\nshall be never quenched.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own in a moment did kneel beside me, and, truly, someways in\r\nher deep intenseness unto me; for our love did make all the world holy,\r\nand she to be both uplifted and as that she must give all the humbleness\r\nof her heart unto the greatness of my love; and this she to feel, and\r\nher deep and utter love, to make it as that she did be all a passion of\r\nhumbleness unto me, so that in her soul I did rise in that moment upon\r\nthe wings of my love, and to seem that I did be all the world and all\r\ntime and all place and all that ever she did need unto her.\r\n\r\nAnd she put out her arms to me, and her eyes did shine with those tears\r\nthat do never be shed; and lo! in a moment, she did be upon my heart,\r\nand we two to be husht together in content; for our need did be in the\r\nother. And truly, where there do be two together with love, there doth\r\nbe neither lack nor need; but eternal fulfilment.\r\n\r\nAnd in verity this to be my Hope for that which doth come\r\nAfterward--that all doth be leading unto so glad a joy as this, and that\r\nall pain and grief and all that doth make the shaping of Life, doth be\r\nbut a process by which we be eternally perfected from living unto\r\nliving, unto each Fulfilment that doth be but the doorway unto greater\r\nFulfilment in the Beloved.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, Mine Own Maid did loose herself gentle from me, and\r\nwasht me and tended me; and very husht and tender, and something\r\ndown-ridded of her dear and lovely eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd we then to eat and to drink together, and joy so great and quiet did\r\nbe upon us, that it did be as that we had gone into an eternity of peace\r\nand an utter content. And surely, as the thought did stir in me, it did\r\nbe of beauty that we did be both of us true unto the other, in that\r\nlife, and I never to have kist a maid, until that I kist Mine Own, and\r\nshe to have been likewise, and to have fended all men from her, because\r\nthat they did be Strangers unto her inwardness, and so we two to be so\r\nutter together, both in that our spirits did be knit, being each the\r\ncomplement of the other, and because that we had no secret pains of\r\nremembered things, to set any apartness between our hearts.\r\n\r\nAnd in verity, I to think back then upon my jealousies, that I have\r\ntold, and to know that Mine Own did never to have given herself lightly\r\nto any, neither to have taken lightly; and her spirit to have been alway\r\nmine through all the Everlasting; and mayhap this to be how all Peoples\r\nshall come to be in the length of time, only that to us had come the\r\ngreat wonder that we did early meet; though this also to bring that\r\nutter pain, which doth seem to slay, when that once you have known the\r\nBeloved, and to be parted.\r\n\r\nAnd so I to think, and did presently ponder with a great and strange\r\npity upon they that did not yet have met the Beloved, and they mayhap\r\nnot to have kept all for the Beloved; but to have been light with that\r\nwhich doth be the Treasure, because that Love had not come to show them\r\nthat they did unknowingly squander the strange and holy glory which doth\r\nbe the possession of they that shall come to the Beloved and say, All\r\nthat is thine have I kept for thee. And the Beloved to know and to have\r\npeace in the remembering. But what doth be the peculiar sorrow of they\r\nthat have gone over-lightly, when that they shall meet the Beloved; for\r\nthen shall there be a constant and inward regret, as a thorn in the\r\nheart, that they not to have observed alway that holy care of all which\r\ndoth pertain unto love; and they nigh to moan in the spirit, _if they\r\nhad but known, if they had but known._ Yet, in the end, of their pain,\r\nshall they grow unto all loveliness, if that now they have truly come\r\nupon Love, and to live with Love; for this to be the especial glory of\r\nlove, that it doth make unto all Sweetness and Greatness, and doth be a\r\nfire burning all Littleness, so that did all in this world to have met\r\nThe Beloved, then did Wantonness be dead, and there to grow Gladness and\r\nCharity, dancing in the years.\r\n\r\nAnd there to be yet one thing upon which, mayhap, I not to have thought\r\nsufficient; for it doth be this, that they who did err, as I have shown,\r\nshall be the greater for their _Pain_; and let this be to cheer you, if\r\nthat you have done foolishly, and thought not upon that day when the\r\nBeloved shall come; for Pain is but the voice of Development or\r\nDestruction; and truly you to suffer the first, if that Love doth work\r\nin you; but truly, the more that you have lacked, the greater shall be\r\nyour pain; for the more change there doth need be in you.\r\n\r\nAnd so would I have you now to think, and to know that the Beloved shall\r\ncome, and so shall you live in glad care of all your being, that you be\r\nable to come unto the Beloved in that day, and to say with beauty and\r\nhuman joy in your heart, even as I have said; and thus shall you miss\r\nthat bitter pain. But yet, truly, you to be like to heed not this, until\r\nthat Love doth come upon you; and I therefore to cease from this vain\r\nsetting of mine inward reasonings.\r\n\r\nBut truly, when that day be come, as I have told, you to know how that\r\nthere went alway with me in this mine own story which I tell, the\r\nsimplicity of Truth; and how that I did be minded only that you to know,\r\nand thereby that you have gentle wisdom that you lay not up pain for\r\nthat day. Yet, if you do lack to go with me, you to need that developing\r\nwhich shall then come upon you.\r\n\r\nAnd so shall you perceive how my thoughts did go to and fro, as I did\r\neat with Mine Own; and so in the last I to find that I did think very\r\nserious; and I then to cast from me this pondering, and to have that\r\nutter joy which did be upon us, and to seem that it did fill all that\r\nstrange Country of Seas.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! after we did be done of eating and drinking, which did be but a\r\nlittle time, as you shall think, the Maid did ease me to an upward\r\nsitting, and had my back very nice to an olden stump which did be light,\r\nand she to push unto me.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own did sit then beside me, so that mine arm did come most\r\nnatural about her; and she there to be nestled all gleeful and content,\r\nso that my heart did be doubly tender unto her. And I took the abundance\r\nof her hair, and set it about my neck, and upon my breast, so that it\r\ndid near to cover me in the upward part; and we both then to laugh as\r\nthat we did be two children, because that Love did make us so utter\r\nyoung in the heart; and our hands to be hid under the beauty of the\r\nMaid\'s hair, and I to have her then that she explain just how great she\r\ndid love me; and you that go with me, do know how that this doth be a\r\ndelight that is never done, neither to be set only into words.\r\n\r\nAnd all that day we did be wondrous happy, save once when we saw that\r\nthere were Humpt Men upon the shore, about the Flat-Topt rock where did\r\nbe the fight; but what they did there, we not to be able to see, only\r\nthat presently they went away; and indeed seemed to have no thought unto\r\nus, neither any knowledge; and so did be gone again into the forests;\r\nand we saw no more of them, after that time. And afterward we to be lost\r\nutter in happiness.\r\n\r\nNow, upon the tenth day, I did be so come into health that I to walk a\r\nlittle way to and fore upon the island; and Mine Own did go with me, and\r\nso I to pace a good while, and afterward to rest again.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own then to bring mine armour to me, which she had scoured very\r\nnice; but truly, the Armour did be sore broke and bent, and did be\r\njagged inward this place and that, with the monstrous strength of the\r\nHumpt Men, when that they did strike me with the great sharp stones.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, how I should ever come again to wear this protection, I\r\nto be in doubt. Yet, truly it had been a wondrous suit of strength that\r\nhad kept my life within me when that I had been so deadly beset; and I\r\nto know that it to be yet like to save both our lives, if that we could\r\nsomeway straighten it, and ease the broken jags from wounding me afresh.\r\n\r\nAnd I thought a time, and the Maid with me; and afterward we gat that\r\nstump upon which I had leant, and had this to be for an anvil; and we\r\nfound then smooth stones of different sizes, and these to be for\r\nhammers; and we wrought all that day, with restings, upon the armour;\r\nand surely, we beat it into a very good shape, from the inward, and the\r\nbroken parts we beat smooth, so that they should not wound, and in the\r\nend to have mine armour fit to go upon me.\r\n\r\nAnd I, by now, as you shall think, to be drest part in my garments; but\r\nnot all; for there did be yet some of the bandages upon my body, so that\r\nfor the main I did wear the cloak, that the bandages be easily come at.\r\nAnd all that day did be utter happy, whilst that we workt; for we to be\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAnd on the morrow, as we do say, which was the eleventh wakening upon\r\nthe island, the Maid and I to talk long and oft, whilst that we yet\r\nworked upon the armour; and we to ponder the best way that we continue\r\nto our journeying; for, indeed, I was not come to my strength; yet was I\r\nvery earnest that we go forward early; but in the same time, I did fear,\r\nlest that we meet with aught of Danger, and I to be a-lack, because that\r\nI was yet weak.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, the Maid and I both to think upon the same thing; for she\r\nto cry out concerning the raft, and I to have the same word in my mouth.\r\nAnd, in verity, this to be a great thought; for then should we be able\r\nalway to be free of the Humpt Men, and to have frequent rest when that\r\nwe be weary, and to sleep with an ease in the mind; and, indeed, I to\r\nhope that the labour of oars should be something less than to go upon\r\nthe feet.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, we talkt upon this a good while, and afterward we left the\r\narmour, and went over to the raft, and so to learn whether we should\r\nhave power to make it something more stable, and that we have some way\r\nthat we should put a solid matter between our bodies and any monster\r\nthat should chance to swim under us.\r\n\r\nAnd we went then together over all the little island; for I did search\r\nfor some bush that should have a long tendril in plenty, and supple, and\r\nso to suit for binding. But, truly, there did be no such bush in all the\r\nisland; and this to put me in trouble, as you shall suppose; yet was\r\nthere a sufficient plenty of small and upright trees, that did seem very\r\ngood for any purpose of structure.\r\n\r\nAnd when we had gone all about the island, and found naught that should\r\nbind, the Maid to say with a pretty jesting that we should cut her hair,\r\nand plait it to be for cords. And, surely, even as the words did come\r\nfrom her, they to set me upon the thing that should supply our need; for\r\nI stoopt sudden to the grass that did grow oft and plenty in this place\r\nand that, and was so tall as my thigh, and to my head in the middle of\r\nthe dumpings where it did sprout. And lo! it was wondrous tough.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid to have likewise perceived the thought, almost at that\r\nmoment; but I to have been the first this time, and so to tease her; for\r\ntruly, we had grown that we did nigh alway to discover all things in the\r\nsame instant, as you mayhap to have seen. But I did surely be first this\r\ntime, and must kiss her, as we do kiss little ones, that they be eased\r\nin their dismays and disappointments; and she to see how I did mock her,\r\nand she to pretend to weep; and surely how could she even to pretend,\r\nwhen that she did not be able to keep her pretty mouth from searching\r\nwith laughter unto mine; but must be kissed full and plenty in our\r\nconstant joyfulness.\r\n\r\nAnd we cut then a good arm-load of the grasses, using the knife, and had\r\nthose to our camp; for we did be homely now unto that place, as you\r\nshall think. And the Maid then to show me plaiting, and how that we\r\ncould work in the grass piece by piece, so that we should plait unto any\r\nlength that we to need.\r\n\r\nAnd all that day we workt, and did be very happy together; but when that\r\nwe came to the time of our slumber, the Maid had done twice and thrice\r\nso much as I; and surely she came over to me, and kist me very grave,\r\nthat I should be not to fret, even as I did kiss her with gentle mocking\r\nconcerning the thought about the grass; and so did she make level with\r\nme, by this impudence and quaint sweetness.\r\n\r\nAnd on the next day, which did be the twelfth, I took the Diskos, and on\r\nthat day I cut down six of the trees; and alway the Maid did bring her\r\nplaiting, that she be near me; and when I had cut the six trees, she had\r\nme to cease, lest that I risk to open any wound. And truly they to have\r\nhealed very wonderful.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, we to plait all that day, and did also finish the armour;\r\nand did be content and utter happy.\r\n\r\nAnd on the thirteenth day, I counted the tablets, and found that we yet\r\nto have sufficient, if that we came unto the Mighty Pyramid within any\r\nreasonable time. But I insist that I should eat no more now than did be\r\nmy usual way; and though Mine Own did beg and to coax me, and even to\r\ntry whether that a naughty and loving anger should do aught to shift me,\r\nI not to alter from my deciding, which was based upon my reason and upon\r\nmy intention that Mine Own should never to go in hunger-danger, whilst\r\nthat there did be life in my body. And when that the Maid did show this\r\ndear and pretty anger, I to take her into mine arms, and to tell her how\r\nI did reverence and love her, and that she did be all beauty unto me,\r\nand I but to love her the more, because that I did know the reason for\r\nher dear shaping of anger unto me.\r\n\r\nAnd she then to kiss me, and yet to beg again that she have her way in\r\nthis thing; but presently I did show her that my reasoning was sound in\r\nthis matter; though I said not that my strongest thought did be unto her\r\nown needs. And she to have to agree with me in her brain, even whilst\r\nthat her heart did ache to feed me. And truly, I to love her but the\r\nmore, as you shall think.\r\n\r\nAnd this way shall you ever to manage a dear and sensible woman that\r\ndoth both love you and hath reason in her; for the wise man and he that\r\nhath an heart unto bigness, doth be never hasty to command. But, indeed,\r\nI speak not now of the way that you shall go with a woman that hath the\r\nlove-foolishness upon her; for this to be a different matter, as you do\r\nknow; and a woman then to require a double wit and tenderness in the\r\ngoverning; but also to need to be commanded, mayhap with sternness; yet\r\nwith the more love.\r\n\r\nNow, when that we wakened on our fourteenth day upon the Island, we gat\r\nto work, so soon as we had washt and eat and drunk, and Mine Own to see\r\nhow my scars did go.\r\n\r\nAnd I cut seven more trees that day, which made thirteen in all; and\r\nafterward I trimmed the trees very nice. And when this was done, I cut\r\ntwelve good sapling-trees, and two more very thin, that I did mean to be\r\nfor paddling the raft upon the water. And Mine Own Maid did sit near me\r\nalway, and never to be ceased from her plaiting.\r\n\r\nAnd whilst that the Maid did plait, and make gentle and happy talk with\r\nme, I presently to sit beside her, and had her belt-knife to my need;\r\nand therewith, when I had cut bark from a tree, I made a foot-long\r\ncross-piece of wood which I did fasten with pegs and some lashing unto\r\nthe end of one of the paddle-shafts.\r\n\r\nAnd I took then a piece of the bark, so big, mayhap, as would cover my\r\nthigh, and shaped broad one end and thence to a point; and when I had\r\nmade holes in the piece of bark, I lasht the broad end to the\r\ncrosspiece, and the end that did be narrowed, I lasht secure to the\r\nshaft, and likewise made holes down the length of the bark, and lasht it\r\nalso thereby to the shaft, and thiswise I had a pretty good paddle,\r\nthat did be about ten feet long in the clear shaft, and the head to be\r\nsomewise two feet more, mayhap.\r\n\r\nAnd when this was done, I shaped the handle so small as might come into\r\nthe grasp of the Maid, and did jest her very loving and gentle that she\r\ngive me so great a work, because that she have her hands so little. And\r\ntruly, she presently to stop me of my mocking; for she put her pretty\r\nhands upon my mouth, and I then to have to mumble and to laugh, and so\r\nshe to go forward again with the plaiting.\r\n\r\nAnd when I had made the one paddle, I made also the other; but something\r\nmore rough and heavy, and suited unto my strength; and so did be very\r\nwell pleased; for they did be made more of my Reason than of memory; yet\r\nhad I used somewhat of the kind upon the quiet lakes which did be in the\r\nCountry of Silence.\r\n\r\nAnd we then to join in the plaiting, and thus with happy talk and our\r\ntimes of eating, until that we did be come again to our slumber.\r\n\r\nAnd on the fifteenth day, when that we had gotten up and washt and eat\r\nand drank, the Maid did look unto my bandages; and did consider that I\r\nbe healed very good, if but that I not to overstrain my body. And we\r\nthen to dance, half in play and half in victory, but gentle; and\r\nafterward she to come with me that she give me aid that we get the trees\r\nunto the water.\r\n\r\nAnd in six hours, we rolled the trees down to the shore, and did begin\r\nthen that I lash the saplings across the trees, and thiswise to hold\r\nthem secure into a raft. And the midmost tree I put something more\r\nforward than the next; and so, until that which did be the front was\r\nshaped somewise like to the bow of a ship. And the saplings to hold the\r\ntrees thiswise, when that I had set the lashings about every sapling and\r\nevery tree, where the saplings did go across.\r\n\r\nAnd all that day I worked pretty constant and steady, until that Mine\r\nOwn had me to cease awhile, lest that I bend overmuch, and so to put\r\nstrain upon my scars. And I to be reasonable; but yet to go forward\r\nagain with the work; only that I did rest now, this time and that; and\r\nso did all to prosper.\r\n\r\nAnd on the morrow, which did be the sixteenth day upon the island, I\r\nmade an end of lashing the saplings across the raft; and I set up also,\r\ntwo rests for the paddles, so that we might row if we stood upon the\r\nraft; and afterward, being ready, we gat together our gear, and set all\r\nupon the raft.\r\n\r\nAnd I put the pole that the Maid had used, also upon the raft, and\r\nloosed the straps from that first raft, and had the straps for our\r\nrequirement, as heretofore. And mine armour we made safe on the raft;\r\nbut the Diskos I had to my hip, as ever; and so did we be ready to leave\r\nthat little island of refuge, where we had been so near to sorrow, but\r\nyet had come utterly upon joy.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, Mine Own did take me by the arm, and she to stand a little,\r\nand to look with me unto that bed of soft herbage where she had laid me,\r\nwhen that I did be so nigh unto death; and she then to kiss me very\r\nsweet and loving and gentle, and all a-tremble with the tears and love\r\nthat did stir in her; and I to set mine arms about her in love; and so\r\nwe to turn and to put off then in the Raft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nPAST THE HOUSE OF SILENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it was in the tenth hour of that day, that we put off in the raft;\r\nand surely we found the paddles to go very easy and with somewhat of\r\nbalance in the rests which I had set up, as you do mind; and the raft to\r\ngo forward with not overmuch of labour; so that we stood, the Maid to\r\nthe fore paddle and I did be to the hinder one, and we pusht very steady\r\nupon the paddles, and had the raft presently to a speed something less\r\nthan we should walk over the rough way of the Land.\r\n\r\nAnd about the twelfth hour we stopt and eat and drunk, and went on again\r\nwith our easy labouring; and truly, when that we gat set to the\r\nmovement, we scarce to wot that we did aught more than rock something\r\nfore and back upon our feet; and so the hours to pass, and we to have a\r\nconstant gentle speech one with the other, and the Maid oft to look back\r\nunto me with love, and to set her lips that she tempt me; but yet to\r\nshake her head most dear, when that I would leave my paddle, that I go\r\nforward unto her.\r\n\r\nAnd when that the eighteenth hour of that day was come, we to draw\r\ninward our paddles, and the Maid set the cloak very nice to be our bed,\r\nand afterward we eat and drank, and so presently to our slumber, and did\r\nhave sleep, very sound and happy, all in a moment, as it to seem.\r\n\r\nAnd eight good hours after, we did waken both of us, together; and lo!\r\nwe scarce to mind where we did be for a little moment; but afterward to\r\nknow and to perceive that we did be safe and naught to have come unto\r\nus in our sleep. And surely we laught each in the face of the other; for\r\nwe did be so joyous to be wakened each unto the knowledge of the other.\r\nAnd after that we had kist, we washt somewhat in the water of the sea,\r\nand so to our food. And when we had eat and drunk, we made again to the\r\npaddling; and went forward thus along the coast very peaceful and\r\ncontent all that day.\r\n\r\nNow, in all, that voyaging did talk four good days of four-and-twenty\r\nhours each, for we made no great haste or labour, but went easy, that I\r\nhave time to gather my strength. And naught to happen in all that time,\r\nsave that once we did see a great beast to come upward lumbersome out of\r\nthe sea on to the shore, and there did eat and browse upon the herbage\r\nin that part; or so it did seem to us; though, truly, we did be over far\r\noff to have surety.\r\n\r\nAnd this beast not to put us into any horror; but only to make us glad\r\nthat we be afar off from it; and by this saying, I to mean that it did\r\nseem unto us a natural thing; and nowise to have an odour of aught\r\nmonstrous to trouble our spirits. And this way did be all the creatures\r\nof that Country; and truly I do think the Early World did be somewise\r\nlike to it; and this to seem to make true that olden saying that extreme\r\nthings do meet, as doth be over-apparent; for thus doth it be somewise\r\nto our knowings, as you shall perceive by your Reasonings Upon Olden\r\nDays, and by the showings of this Mine Own Story, for that Deep World to\r\nhave put forth natural creatures that did be even as might be those that\r\ndid live in the Beginning; though I to make no point of this, but only\r\nthat it doth occur to my thought; and all to seem that it did be bred of\r\nCircumstance and Condition; yet this to have no saying whether that\r\nthere to be a spiritual-force something deeper than the Circumstance;\r\nfor this to be outside of any surety, but not offensive unto my Reason.\r\n\r\nBut this thinking also neither to offend me, that although much--and\r\nmayhap all--doth be modified and shapen diverse ways by the Circumstance\r\nand the Condition, yet doth there be an inward force that doth be\r\npeculiar each unto each; though, mayhap, to be mixt and made monstrous\r\nor diverse by foul or foolish breeding--as you to have knowledge of in\r\nthe bodies of those dread Monsters that did be both Man and Beast. Yet,\r\nalso, I here to say that maybe all diverse breeding not to be monstrous;\r\nbut this to be beside my point. For I to be now set to tell, as I have\r\ntold, that it not to offend me to suppose that there to be this inward\r\nforce peculiar to each shaping of all bodies that do hold that wondrous\r\nquality of Life. And if that you ask me that I give example to make\r\nclear my thought, I to say that it doth be reasonable to suppose that\r\nthe Force or Spirit of the Human doth be peculiar to the Human, whether\r\nthat it to be a Cause of Life, or the Result of that which hath been\r\nevolved out of a Condition. And whether it to be the one way or the\r\nother, you to know that where this Force or Spirit be found untainted,\r\nthere is man; and I to be not opposed to think that Man doth be constant\r\nalway in matters of fundament, and neither to have been ever truly\r\ndifferent; though something modified in the body and surely, in the\r\nfirst, all undeveloped in the lovely things of the spirit, because that\r\nthere to be no call to these. Yet, presently, they likewise to come, and\r\nto act upon the flesh with refinings; and likewise, mayhap, there to be\r\nsome act of the flesh upon the spirit; and so to the state of this Age\r\nof this our day, and to that far Age of which I do tell. But development\r\nnever to make the Human other than the Human; for the development to\r\nhave limits peculiar to the Human. And surely, it doth appeal to me,\r\nthat the development of Man doth lie between two points, that be not\r\nwondrous wide apart; and Man to have power that he arrive very speedy\r\nfrom one unto the other, and likewise that he go back so quick, or even\r\nthe more hasty. Yet, even did it be ever proved that Man once to be a\r\nfish, I to have no cause to abate the first part of mine argument; but\r\nto have the more need of the thought, that I gain power to accept the\r\nFact; for I still then to have no occasion that I think Man to have been\r\ntruly a Fish, or aught truly different from a Man; but only that he did\r\nbe once Modified physically to his need, and to be still possessed of\r\nthe Man-Spirit, though all lackt of development. Yet, truly, I to be\r\nless offend in my Reason, if that it be shown that Man did be ever\r\nsomewise in his present shape, though mayhap so brutish as the Humpt\r\nMen; but yet I do be ready to consider all matters, and do build no\r\nWalls about my Reason. Yet, neither I to have an over-ready acceptance\r\nof aught, but to need that my Reason shall approve.\r\n\r\nAnd you to perceive, surely, that I here not to speak of that which may\r\nbe Afterward, when that all This, our life, be done. For who shall say\r\nhow much or how little we then to go forward unto loveliness; and I at\r\nthis point to tell you that I do have a wondrous hope of beauteous\r\nthings, and of sweet and mighty Uplifting and Furtherance unto that Glad\r\nWorld which we have beheld the shores of, when that we had stood in\r\nholiness with the Beloved.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I now once more to my story; and to be glad that I am\r\ndone at this small setting forth of a matter which did need words,\r\nbecause that it did have root in this Mine Own Story, and to be grown of\r\nit and from it.\r\n\r\nNow, there did be one other thing of note, beside the Sea Beast, whilst\r\nthat we did be upon the Seas; and this did be the strangeness of a great\r\nFire-Hill which did stand in the sea, and we to pass very nigh unto it.\r\nAnd surely the sea did boil about it, yet not in all places; and there\r\ndid be a score great jets that did go upward a monstrous way, and did\r\nroar very plain to us across the sea between; and there did come strange\r\ngruntings from the sea about the base of the Fire-Hill, and these I to\r\nconceive to be made by the upbursting of gases in this place and that;\r\nand surely, it all to make us to know of the great energy that did be\r\nwakeful in that deep Country; and we yet to stare backward upon that\r\nHill of Fire and Force, for a great while after that we had come past.\r\n\r\nNow, beyond this, there to be naught, except that we had a certain care\r\nas we did come to that place where the Great Sea did be broke to smaller\r\nseas; but all to be knit with passages of water, which let us through\r\nupon our way.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I did show Mine Own Maid those two places where I did sleep\r\nwhen first I was come into that Country; and she to be sweet in\r\ninterest, and alway to have somewhat that she would learn of this and\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAnd so, when that we did be four good days upon the water, as I have\r\ntold, we to come to the land, upon a flat place of the shore, where the\r\nCountry did slope upward unto the mouth of the First Gorge, of which you\r\ndo mind. And this to be in the tenth hour of that day; and we likewise\r\nto have begun that voyage in the tenth hour, as you do remember; and\r\nsurely it to have been a sweet and peaceful water-journey; and I to have\r\nbeen happy, if that all that did be yet before us, to hold so much of\r\npleasantness and safe goings. But, indeed, there to be much danger yet\r\nto come, as you do know; and we to have our hearts set in courage, and\r\nto go forward to conquer; for surely, if that we to conquer, and to come\r\nsafe into our Mighty Home, there to be then that we have all our lives\r\ntogether in loveliness; and this to be truly a worthy prize and a glory\r\nof the heart, to end and to repay our Stress.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, the Maid and I did presently strand the raft, so well as we\r\nmight, and did then to wonder whether any should evermore to behold it\r\nthrough all Eternity. And we lookt a little, each at the other; and the\r\nMaid then to cut free a small piece of the wood of the raft, to be for\r\nan after remembrance.\r\n\r\nAnd so we to have our gear upon the shore; and the Maid then to give me\r\naid that I get once more into mine armour; and so I presently to have\r\nthe Scrip and the Pouch again to my back, and the Diskos in my hand, and\r\nall in readiness, and the Maid with her bundle (that was now grown\r\nsmall), and her belt about her body, that she have her knife unto her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, the Maid then to kneel and to kiss the raft; for memories\r\ndid gather upon her; and she there to have one more breaking from all\r\nthat did be the first part of her life; and you to give your\r\nunderstanding, and so to have a quiet sympathy, and to perceive that her\r\nheart did be like that it should stir with a strange trouble of\r\nsorrowing in that moment.\r\n\r\nAnd surely I stoopt then, very gentle and loving, and had Mine Own to\r\nher feet; and I led her from the raft, and she to need that she be near\r\nme; and so we to go forward, and to make upward unto the dark mouth of\r\nthe Great Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd there to be some miles unto our right, that grim and utter huge\r\nMountain, whereon afar upward in the monstrousness of the night did be\r\nperched those four fire-hills of which I have told. And below them,\r\nthere to go upward the great hills of ash, that had been cast down\r\nthroughout Eternity. And this thing had the Maid lookt upon for a great\r\ntime, and did be never done of her wonder; neither I, nor any human that\r\never should have sight of so great a wonder.\r\n\r\nAnd so we to have come presently upward into the high mouth of the\r\nGorge, and did go onward then into the gloom, a little space, until that\r\nwe were come to the place where the Gorge did bend sharp unto the left,\r\ninto darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! we made pause here, and turned again unto the Country of Seas,\r\nthat we have a last outward look over all that Deep and living Land,\r\nthat did be hid so far downward in the everlasting night of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, it did be a solemn thing to know that we, mayhap, to be\r\nthe last of the olden Humans that should ever to look upon that Country;\r\nand I to wonder, in that moment, whether that the Humpt Men should ever\r\nto develop, in some far eternity, unto the full sweetness of the spirit\r\nof Humanity which I did think to be inward of them. And this to be both\r\nan odd and a natural thought to have then, as I do see. But at that\r\ntime, I only to think it, and not to wot or to trouble whether that it\r\ndid be odd or otherwise. And I to think that Country did be somewise as\r\nthe Olden Time renewed; but truly we to look upon early things with new\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAnd we yet to look awhile, and to be husht, and to hark in those last\r\nmoments unto the far mutter of the Great Fire-Mountains, and the\r\nFire-Hills, and the noise of life which did go over that Land; and we\r\neven then to be but a few short pacings off from the silence of the\r\nGreat Gorge, which should lead us presently toward the Eternal\r\nStrangeness which did be in the Night Land. And the Maid did hold mine\r\narm very close, as we lookt our last into the red light of that Deep and\r\nHid Country of the World, where, in verity, we had come so utter nigh to\r\nour Death.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, I turned, and the Maid slipt her hand into mine, and the\r\ntears did go silent down her face, because of all that did be prest upon\r\nher heart; but yet not to be all of sorrow, for there to be both sorrow\r\nand happiness, and also there did be somewhat of vague emotion that she\r\nnever more to look upon that dear island where she had nurst her man\r\nagain unto life and well-being; and she to be in mind of all those\r\nplaces where she to know that in after-life her memory to wander; and\r\nshe to have oft-told tales, mayhap, unto her children, of that Country\r\nthat they never to see; but only to be for a wonder to them for ever.\r\n\r\nAnd we past then round the Mighty Corner-place of the Gorge, and went\r\nforward, somewhat stumbling, into the gloom.\r\n\r\nNow we went sixteen hours very steady, and with naught save the great\r\ndarkness to trouble us; and we by this to have been twenty and six hours\r\nsince last that we had sleep; and surely this did be a foolishness,\r\nbecause that I to need that I come into my full strength, ere we reach\r\nthe Night Land; and it to be a folly that I should over-tire myself; and\r\nthe Maid to have said so much.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, then, we came to a safe place for our slumber, and whilst\r\nthat we eat and drunk, we made count from my notings of the outward way,\r\nand so did decide that we go no more than sixteen hours\' journey each\r\nday through the Gorge, and to sleep alway for eight good hours. And this\r\nwe to do, both then, and until that we did be come out of the Great\r\nGorge, which did take us in all, so much as five days thiswise.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, when that we were come into the light places of the Gorge,\r\nwe to be more cheered, as you shall suppose; yet oft did we be half\r\nsmothered with the horrid gases that came upward in this part and that,\r\nas you do mind.\r\n\r\nAnd my strength did grow constant, as we journeyed; yet would the Maid\r\nnever suffer that I carry her; but went alway very light and clever, and\r\nwas grown, in truth, set unto this constant wander.\r\n\r\nAnd at this place and that, I to make pause that I show Mine Own those\r\nplaces where I did slumber, and she alway to need that she come unto the\r\nvery part, and that she stand for a little moment where I did lie so\r\nlonesome, as I went outward unto that despairful searching. And alway\r\nshe then to be utter tender with me, and to be something lacking of\r\nspeech, because of the calling of her heart.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, Mine Own did be alway now to ask me when that we should be\r\ncome unto the Night Land; and to require how far it should be, and to be\r\ntaken with a growing of excitement, very dear and natural; and, in\r\nverity, I to be almost so much so as she; and to wonder what she to\r\nthink of the Mighty Redoubt, and of all that strange and monstrous Land.\r\nAnd, above all these, I to be shaken unto my very heart, that I have the\r\nMaid speedy unto safety; lest, after all, even though we to have come so\r\nfar, there somewhat to happen of woe. And all this did make it a hard\r\nthing that we not to begin to race, and to exceed the hours that we did\r\nset; but truly we had wisdom in this matter, and slumbered alway after\r\nthe sixteenth hour.\r\n\r\nAnd we never to see aught of life in all that great and desolate Gorge;\r\nfor there did be only the gas-burnings, and the boulders and the stark\r\nrocks, and oft the rank smellings of the gases. And alway an utter and\r\neverlasting quiet; save when some lonesome gas-fire did oddly to moan\r\nor to whistle, and the whistling to sound very dree across the great\r\nwaste of the Gorge, and likewise the moaning to be but a thing to make\r\nthe loneliness to be felt in the heart; and the Maid to feel thus with\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnd alway, as I did know, she to think in her heart that I did come\r\nthrough that place alone to make a searching for her into the unknown\r\nlands of the world; and surely, I did be but a natural man if that I was\r\nsomething happy in my heart that Mine Own so to ponder and to remember;\r\nfor thereby did her love seem ever to grow. And likewise, a man doth be\r\nglad in his spirit and natural pride, that his Maid to know that he hath\r\ndone wholesomely of his best for her need. And you but to think upon the\r\nlove-days, and to hear the echoes of those dear proud thoughts that did\r\nso to swell in you; and doth not all to go so strangely with familiar\r\npain in the old way?\r\n\r\nNow it was upon the fifth day, in about the seventh hour, that I heard\r\noddwhiles a sound in this place and that of the Gorge, as that the rocks\r\nmade husht and strange sounds at us. And I to have the Maid instant very\r\nnigh to me, and the Diskos to my hand, and we then to go onward with a\r\ngreat caution.\r\n\r\nAnd thrice we did pass places where gas-fires did burn and dance, and\r\nmade oft a low moaning, and somewhiles a little whistling; and the other\r\nsounds yet to come oddly from the rocks, in this place and that, very\r\nstrange and unthought of, yet to be something familiar.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden, it did come to me that there to be a far-away noise in these\r\nsounds; though they to seem to come from this place and that almost to\r\nmine elbow, as you should say. And lo! I knew then that I harked unto\r\nlittle echoings, that did be caught by the near rocks, and to come from\r\nsome far and mighty sound. And this should be surely the monstrous\r\npiping of the Great Gas Fountain, that you do well mind. And, in verity,\r\nI told Mine Own in a moment; and she to be all eager with me, because\r\nthat this did be both a wondrous thing, and to be also a landmark to\r\nshow that we did be nigh to come out of the Gorge, and our journey to\r\ncome the more near unto an ending.\r\n\r\nAnd surely we lookt ahead very earnest; and there to be so many strange\r\nand leaping fires to our front, that we not to be very sure which did be\r\nthe far and monstrous dance of the Great Gas Fountain; for truly it to\r\nbe yet so distant that the near gas-fires did make more upon the eye up\r\nall of a weary length of the Gorge, than did the great dance of the\r\nfar-off fire, that was now so small, by the distance.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, when that we were gone onward something more, we to see\r\nthat there went a lightening and a darkening afar along the Gorge, so\r\nthat the background of the night was made to lose somewhat of the\r\nintensity of its darkness, as with constant shudders of light; and this\r\nto be surely the far away dance of the flame of the Great Gas Fountain.\r\nAnd we then to watch alway as we journeyed, and to see how that the\r\nvague shudderings of light did grow in the distance of the night, and\r\ndid merge and become known presently in a strange uplifting and falling\r\nof a far away blue flame.\r\n\r\nAnd the sound now to come more steady, and to grow in a long while into a\r\nmonstrous piping, very great and wonderful, and having a constant change\r\nin the note.\r\n\r\nAnd we to come past the last of the lesser fires, and to be in that part\r\nof the Gorge which did be fireless, save for the great upward dance of\r\nthe Gas Fountain, which did now to be grown huge and plain-seen, and did\r\nmake a quaking light over all the Gorge.\r\n\r\nAnd so in the end, we to be come very nigh to the dance of the monstrous\r\nflame; and did be half stunned by the noise, which did be now an utter and\r\nfurious roaring, as you shall remember; and the Maid and I did stand as\r\nbut two lonesome strangers in the mouth-part of that deep and desolate\r\nGorge, and did stare voiceless unto the great flaw; and mine arm did be\r\nabout the Maid, and she to stand very nigh to me; and neither to speak;\r\nand surely, how should we anywise; for the noise did be so huge.\r\n\r\nAnd after that we had stared a great while, we turned that we look each\r\nat the other; and we kist very sober, there in the light from the\r\nmonster flame. And afterward, we did stare again at the Flame, and soon\r\nturned, and lookt all ways, and did marvel to see the great throw of the\r\nlight go blue and spreading and strange unto great distances.\r\n\r\nAnd a while we did be watching the way that the far-off side of the\r\nGorge did come plain to sight, when that the Flame did leap; and, truly,\r\nthat did seem a far and lonesome Place, as that a lost and forgot world\r\nof desolate mountains did be there.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! we now to look that we should see somewhat of the way that our\r\njourney to go; and surely naught to be clear shown save when the Flame\r\ndid rise oddwhiles to a monstrous height; and this to be because of the\r\nhuge rocks that did stand about the Flame. Yet something I was abled to\r\nshow the Maid of the bottom part of the Mighty and Utter Monster Slope\r\nthat did be the last way of our journey, ere we were come to the Night\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nAnd we then to go onward for about a good mile, that we be not so\r\ndeafened by the noise of the Gas Fountain; and it did be now beyond the\r\nseventeenth hour; so that we eat and drunk, and made our rest in a\r\nsecure place among the great boulders.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! when that we waked, we eat and drunk again, and did be something\r\nsilent, as we to gaze at the Flame dancing monstrous, and lonesome and\r\nall set about with the stark and mighty Rocks, which did be like unto\r\ngiants of silence that did watch forever. And presently, we had our gear\r\nupon us, and we went forward toward the utter dark of the Mighty Slope;\r\nand we began that huge climb, that should last through days in an\r\neternity of night.\r\n\r\nAnd oft in the first hours did we turn about from our blind stumblings,\r\nand gaze downward out of the long height, unto the loom of the Flame,\r\nthat did shudder far below in the night, and made a quaking light in\r\nthat far darkness. And so did we leave it to dance forever through\r\nEternity in that deep and lost place of the world; and we bent all our\r\nwill and our strength unto the climb.\r\n\r\nAnd this way went we stumbling for sixteen great hours; and by that time\r\nhad come to a pace proper for that task, and to be something numbed, and\r\nseeming grown unreal, because of the affecting of the Darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! for eight days then did we go upward forever through that most\r\ndreadful night. And after the first day, we crept alway upon our hands\r\nand our knees, and I to go in the front, and had the Diskos ready upon\r\nmy hip. And I took two of the straps from the pouch and the scrip, and\r\nso had a certain length; and I set them from the waist-belt of the Maid\r\nunto mine own belt, and so did know ever that she came close after me.\r\n\r\nAnd we made journeys sixteen hours long, and did eat and drink at the\r\nsixth and the twelfth hours, and likewise we eat and drank ere we slept,\r\nand again upon our wakings; and our slumber-time to go alway somewheres\r\nabout eight good hours; for thus did I be heedful that we have all our\r\nstrength for that dreadness of the journey, which did be yet before us,\r\nacross the fear and horrid terror of the Night Land.\r\n\r\nAnd oft, at this time and that, I was utter sickened and a-wearied of\r\nreaching forward and upward forever, and making blind fumblings that I\r\nfind a way about great boulders and the rocks and holes that did be in\r\nour path in the dark; for it to seem that we went lost from all life and\r\nknowing, in a blackness that should be never slackened from about us.\r\n\r\nAnd I, these times, to make a pause, and to call softly unto Mine Own\r\nthat she creep up nigh unto me; and I then to take her into mine arms,\r\nout of the utter blackness of that night. And so to give and to have\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, Mine Own did whisper once unto me, that she did be stunned\r\nwith love and wonder in the heart; for she to never cease to know that I\r\ndid adventure through this great night, that I find her. And this thing\r\ndid make me very warm in my heart, as you shall think; but yet I to stop\r\nher speech with a gentle kiss; and she then to know that she be dumb\r\nconcerning her thought in this matter; yet she never to cease from\r\nremembering it, and did be the more stirred with the trouble of her\r\nlovely secret worship; for, in verity, she to have me to be for her\r\nhero; and this to make me in the same moment both something shamed and\r\ngreatly proud.\r\n\r\nAnd so we to be together, and after such pause, to go forward again,\r\nwith a new courage.\r\n\r\nAnd surely it did be a great comfort to me to think that, because we to\r\ngo upward and not downward, we be not like to fall over any hid cliff in\r\nthe night; for I to have now some little knowing of the Slope, from mine\r\noutward journey; yet to remember upon that monstrous pit that I then to\r\nescape, and so to go with care.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, upon the second day, I had Mine Own to creep more nigh with\r\nme, and I then to have but one strap between us, and the other I set a\r\nstone into, and did cast the stone alway before us, as upon the outward\r\nway. And you to mind you of this, if you but to think a little minute.\r\n\r\nAnd oft in those weary days in the Darkness, did I make gentle\r\nwhisperings through the blackness, unto Mine Own, that I give cheer unto\r\nher; and she alway to answer, very sweet and loving; yet ever husht, as\r\nI did be; and in verity, it did be as that we could not set our voices\r\nloud upon that Mighty Slope, lest some enchantment come upon us, as it\r\nmight be said. And, indeed, each time that I cast the stone, the noise\r\nof the stone to make a little trouble and dismalness in mine ears; for\r\nall did be so quiet and desolate and lost in night, that it to make us\r\nto need to be likewise so quiet, and to desire that we might go upward\r\nso silent as shadows.\r\n\r\nNow, surely, I must tell here how that the Maid to have alway at waking\r\nthat same awaredness that I did have upon the Outward Way, that somewhat\r\ndid be nigh to us, and to seem to have been concerned with our waking;\r\nand I likewise to have also the same knowledge, as before. And oft as we\r\ndid go, I to feel that somewhat did go near to us. And this to put\r\nsomething of a fear upon me, because that I was ever anxious for Mine\r\nOwn; and I to have her to be alway the more nigh to me, and did set the\r\nstrap from her to me, even when that she slept; so that she not to be\r\ntouched, and I to lack to know. Yet she to have no fear concerning this\r\nthing; but to feel in her spirit that it did be a force that had no evil\r\nintent unto us; but more, neither she nor I to know; and I, in truth, to\r\ncome in the end used to it; save that I did be, as I have told, anxious\r\nin all that did concern the life and well-being of My Beloved.\r\n\r\nAnd so did we go onward through those eight days.\r\n\r\nAnd it soon to be grown cold, so that we both to need the cloak over us\r\nin our slumbers; but in the journey-hours to need naught; for the\r\nupward-going did surely heat us very well.\r\n\r\nAnd there also to be come presently a change and a seeming of thinness\r\ninto the air; and the Maid to remark upon this, and likewise that the\r\nwater-powder now to be that it not to fizz so plentiful.\r\n\r\nAnd we went upward, as it did seem forever, and journeyed very husht\r\nand steadfast; and likewise did halt at set times, that we eat and\r\ndrink; and did alway sit then very close and quiet and in love. And so\r\nalway to go never beyond sixteen hours\' journey each day, and very\r\nweariful even so much; for it to be a sore and constant labour of\r\nclimbing.\r\n\r\nAnd I to learn the hour alway, by a little shining of the Diskos upon my\r\ntime-dial, which I have told did be somewise as the watch of this our\r\npresent Age. Yet, truly, I also to learn that I made somewhat of a\r\nconstant number of forward-throws of the stone in an hour; and the Maid\r\nto be the first to discover this, as she did creep behind me and harked\r\nsteadfast and quiet unto the clatter of the stone, each time that I cast\r\nit. And she sometimes to call low to me that it now to be this time or\r\nthat time; and I to look at my Dial, as I have told, and oft to find\r\nthat she did be curiously right.\r\n\r\nYet otherwhiles, we to have no thought to count; but made a constant\r\nhusht talk one to the other; and did grow odd times, that it did seem to\r\nus that we did be two spirits there in an Everlasting Darkness, that had\r\nquiet speech one to the other, and to be seeming gone from our bodies.\r\nAnd we then to need that we look each at the other, that we know truly\r\nthat we yet to live and to be indeed with the Beloved. And I then alway\r\nto make the Diskos spin a little, yet something more than when I should\r\nsee the hour; and, in verity, our faces then to show pale and strange\r\nseeming in that luminous glowing of the great weapon in the Darkness;\r\nand we to look very eager and an hungered of love, each at the other;\r\nand so to need that we be held loving by the Beloved, and so to have\r\ncomfort and assuredness; and afterward to have peace to go onward again.\r\n\r\nAnd it did be one such time as these, that Mine Own to give me a love\r\nname she had called me in those olden days of _this_ Age; and which\r\nsurely I had not heard since Mirdath died. And, in verity, you to have\r\ndear understanding with me, how that I then to be all troubled with\r\nvague troubles and ghostly love-aches in the heart; and likewise, I did\r\nbe all set about in a moment by the olden enchantment and speechless\r\nglamour that did be so long hid and lost in the Spaces of Memory, where\r\nsurely the spirit doth wander such oddwhiles, husht unto a dumb\r\ntearlessness and to know in the same moment both Agony and the voiceless\r\nGlory and lost Delight of the Hath-Been; so that it doth be as that you\r\nwandered in the spirit between the sorrowful pain of the Sunset, and the\r\nPromise of the Dawn which doth be builded upon the Need and Hope of the\r\nsoul, and doth also to have an essence of pain within it; because that\r\nthese do be knit with Longing which doth be the essential pang of\r\nMemory. And so, mayhap, you to have gone with me; for you to have also\r\nstrange thoughts that do come out of the years, and do hurt the heart,\r\neven whilst that the heart doth hunger of that which doth so pain. Yet,\r\ntruly, Mine Own did be now with me, as you do know so that I had joy\r\nall about my heart; yet did all the years of my lost delights and of my\r\npain, be in the spaces of my memory, and Mine Own now to have stirred\r\nall; so that no words that did be ever shaped of man should help me to\r\nhave ease in speech.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own Maid to know how it did be with me; and she to have said\r\nthe thing, scarce wotting, even as her spirit did set it through her\r\nlips; and she before then to have forgot so utter as I; and now she to\r\nbe stirred likewise with me; so that, in verity, we to hold hands in the\r\ngreat Darkness upon the Slope, and to wait till the pain and strange\r\ntrouble did go somewhat from our hearts; and we to have power again to\r\nknow truly that we did be again together in sweet verity, after a mighty\r\nEternity.\r\n\r\nAnd thus did we go, and even in that strange Night to have an\r\neverlasting coming together; so that surely our two spirits to be nigh\r\nmade one, somewise; and this to be that sweet and holy thing which I do\r\nname Love; and it to be my glory and Astonishment that Love hath come\r\nunto me. And with you that have love, I am as a Brother in holy delight;\r\nbut with all that have not known Love, or to have missed Love, I am a\r\nMourner, and my heart to pray that they to know this Wonder, ere they\r\ndie; for else shall they die so green and bitter as they be born, and to\r\nhave grown nowise unto Ripeness, which doth be Charity--the end of life\r\nand the Crown of Humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd surely I to go forward again now with my telling. And you to know\r\nthat on the eighth day upon the Slope, about the end of the ninth hour,\r\nthere to be an upward seeming of light, afar before us in the Darkness,\r\nand did show as a dull and vague sheen above us in the night. And truly,\r\nI to know that we did be come at last a-near unto the Night Land.\r\n\r\nAnd we went upward then very eager through the dark; and the dim shine\r\ndid grow, ever; so that we soon to see it very plain, as a looming of\r\nlight afar upward. And we ever to climb and to go onward. And lo! in the\r\nfourteenth hour of that day, we came up slowly out of the Night upon the\r\nSlope, and stood at the ending of that strange road Where The Silent\r\nOnes Walk.\r\n\r\nAnd surely it did be as that I was come home, and to have set my feet\r\nagain upon familiar Lands; and this to bring to you how far off I did\r\nseem to have gone; and now to be come again to a Known Place.\r\n\r\nAnd we went upward upon the Road, until that we did truly have topt the\r\nSlope, and at last to look out over all the wonder and mystery of that\r\nLand. And I never to be rid of the utter gladness of knowing that I was\r\ncome there again, after so strange a journey, and that Mine Own had I\r\nbrought with me, out of all the unknown world. Yet, truly, I also never\r\nto have forgetting that this familiar Land of Strangeness did be the\r\nlast test and the greatest dreadfulness of our journey; and anxiousness\r\ndid hang upon me; for I now to have to take the preciousness of Mine Own\r\namong and beyond all that Danger of Horrid Forces and of Monstrous\r\nThings and Beast Men, and the like.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, I did be like to trouble.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I did stare with a fierce eagerness unto the far-off\r\nplace in the middle part of the Night Land, where did be the Mighty\r\nPyramid; and surely it there to shine in the midst of the land, and did\r\nbe mine Home, where never had I dared hope I should return. And I set\r\nmine arm very swift and eager about the Maid, and pointed, so that she\r\nsee quickly the wonder and safe Mightiness of that which did be our\r\nRefuge for all our life to come, if but that we to win unto it. And the\r\nMaid to look with a great and earnest soberness and a lovely gladness\r\nand utter soul and heart interest, unto that Place that bare me, and\r\nwhere I to have come from, and now to take her.\r\n\r\nAnd long and long she lookt; and sudden came round unto me, and set her\r\narms quick about my neck, and burst unto a strange and happy weeping.\r\nAnd I to hold her gentle to me, and let her cry very natural, until that\r\nshe was something unpent.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! when that she was eased, she to stand close beside me, and to\r\nlook again unto the Mighty Pyramid; and afterward, as she to steady, she\r\nto ask an hundred questions, so utter eager and so to thrill with joy\r\nand excitement, as that she did be a glad child. And an hundred\r\nquestions I answered, and showed her new things and Wonders uncounted.\r\n\r\nAnd of all strangeness that she then to see, there did none so to shake\r\nher in the spirit with terror as did that dreadful and Horrid House,\r\nwhich did be the House of Silence. And it was as that her very being did\r\nknow and be repulsed of some Horror that did concern and be in that\r\nHouse; so that she to want to hide in the bushes that did be anigh to\r\nthe Road; and truly, I to think this wise, and to remember and to be\r\nware suddenly that we did be indeed come now into the Power of\r\nMonstrosity which did be utter and forever abroad in that Land.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, we went then in among the bushes that did grow clumpt upon\r\nthe side of the Road, as you to remember; and afterward, I calmed this\r\nnew fear that had come so quick upon Mine Own; and she then to peer\r\nforth with me from the bushes, and to have renewed sight over the Land.\r\n\r\nAnd the House of Silence to stand upon that low hill of which you do\r\nknow; and did not be a very great way off, somewise toward the right.\r\nYet, as you shall have remembering, it did take me some long and bitter\r\nhours upon mine outward way, ere I did be come from under the shadow of\r\nit, as we do say, unto the top-part of the Mighty Slope.\r\n\r\nBut this to have been in the main, because of the utter care that I did\r\nneed to bring me safe past the House; for I to have gone long and weary\r\nupon my hands and knees among the bushes, as you remember; and oft to\r\npause, and to be so still as Death, lest that the Power of the House to\r\nhave become aware of my passing. And truly, we to need again so utter a\r\ncare, when that we make to go past, unto our Mighty Home; and this to be\r\nheavy upon my heart, and I to be in the same moment anxious that we have\r\nhaste to the trial, and yet very willing, if it might be, that we not\r\nmake it forever.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, after that we had peered a good while from the bushes, I to\r\nconsider that we do well to eat now, and afterward to have a safe place\r\nfor our slumber, so that we go fresh to the horrid dangers and\r\ndreadfulness that did be before us upon our way.\r\n\r\nAnd we then to look about, and soon to find a great boulder that did be\r\nset with the bushes. And we made our place for sleep against the\r\nboulder, and the bushes went all around, so that we did be complete hid.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, we to be very cold, as we had been those two past days,\r\nwhilst that we made toward the top of the Mighty Slope. And now we to\r\nhave the full chill of the Night Land, and did be very glad to have the\r\ncloak, so that we eat and drank whilst that we sat together, and the\r\ncloak round us. And afterward, the Maid set the cloak about us for our\r\nsleep; and we then to kiss very sober, and I with anxiousness in the\r\nheart; but she with less, because she to have rest in me.\r\n\r\nAnd so we lay down to our sleep, and the Diskos ready in my hand; and my\r\nspirit wakeful against any terror that should come anigh to us in our\r\nslumber; and the Maid I warned to be likewise wary.\r\n\r\nAnd surely we slept and waked, and there had gone eight good hours, and\r\nnaught was come anigh to us to harm us. And we eat and drank, and did\r\nhark oft, and lookt out from among the bushes; but there did be naught\r\nabroad to set dread upon our spirits; and so we did be more content, and\r\nwell rest and a-ready for the further journeying.\r\n\r\nNow I had the Maid to wear the cloak, because of the chill of the Land;\r\nbut she in the first to refuse, save I also to have it in my turn; but\r\ntruly, I did feel that it should smother me, and that I need all my\r\nfreedom of my body, lest there come any thing sudden upon us; and all\r\nthis I showed Mine Own, and also that we should have weary work, and to\r\ncreep much, so that I should be warm by my labour of going, and she\r\nlikewise, mayhap. And she then to consent, because she saw that I did be\r\nearnest and to burn with anxiousness; yet had me to promise that I take\r\nthe cloak, if that the chill of the Land gat me anywise bitter.\r\n\r\nNow we made a pause, when that we have our gear upon us, and we lookt\r\nwell out over the Land; and surely alway our eyes did gaze in the ending\r\nupon that far Wonder of Light and Safeness, which did be the Mighty\r\nPyramid; and I to be never ceased from telling Mine Own this thing and\r\nthat thing concerning the Great Refuge; and she to be constant stunned\r\nunto silence and delight of wonder, and anon shaken unto a multitude of\r\nquestionings, so that truly we did be as that we never to have done\r\nmaking known one unto the other.\r\n\r\nNow, as you have knowledge, the House of Silence stood upon a low hill,\r\nand the Road did bend about the bottom of the hill; and this way did I\r\ncome, when that I was on mine outward way.\r\n\r\nYet now there to be a new plan of journeying come into my mind; for, as\r\nyou do remember, I did take somewise of eleven great days from the\r\nPyramid unto the top-part of the Mighty Slope, because that I had gone\r\ndiversely and round about to the North-West of the Plain of Blue Fire.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, as now I lookt, it did seem that we should try a short\r\npassage, and thereby be come free out of all danger in but a space of\r\nfour or five days, if only we to succeed. And I stood a good while very\r\nhusht and anxious, and did consider this new way, and did presently\r\npoint it out to the Maid, how that we saw the Mighty Redoubt straight to\r\nthe back of the low hill where stood the House of Silence, and mayhap we\r\nmight chance to find a safe going that way, and that I did ponder\r\nthatwise. For, indeed, as you do know, we must go _nigh_ past the House,\r\neven did we return by the long journeying, and this to be because that\r\nthe bushes did make a cover only near to the Road, and all to be a\r\ncountry of bare rock beyond the bushes on that side of the Road, which\r\ndid be to the North and West.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, I had formed my intention regarding our way, and told\r\nall to Mine Own, and how that we to have alway an utter caution; and the\r\ndanger I made so plain to her as I did know it, and she then to beware\r\nin her heart the need there to be of care and wiseness forever, as we\r\ndid go. And we then to make forward into the Night Land, and to be gone\r\nfrom the top-part of that great deep, in which there to be hid strange\r\nlands, as you do know. And surely, it to be like that none should ever\r\nto go that way again for an eternity, or maybe forever.\r\n\r\nAnd so went we forward, with a new caution.\r\n\r\nAnd we came out from among the bushes upon the North-West of the Road,\r\nand crost unto the Eastward side; and here the bushes to grow very\r\nplentiful, so that I led on with a cheerfulness of hope within my heart.\r\nAnd alway I went so far to the South-East as the bushes would give us\r\ntheir cover, and this way I made that we should scarce to pass within a\r\ngreat mile of the dread and horrid House; though, in verity, this to be\r\nmost dreadful close.\r\n\r\nAnd we walked then for six hours, and went sometimes creeping, and oft\r\nstoopt, and ever with a great caution.\r\n\r\nAnd in the sixth hour we made a rest, and eat and drank, and afterward\r\nwent forward again.\r\n\r\nAnd in the tenth hour were we come something nigh unto the House; for\r\ntruly, we to be off from the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, and so to\r\ngo more straightly, and alway to save distance. And we kept so far\r\noutward from the House as we might; but could pass it not more than a\r\ngreat mile off, because that the bushes did have their margin near upon\r\nour left, as we went; and there to be barenness of rock beyond; and\r\nfire-holes in this part and that amid the starkness of the rocky spaces,\r\nthat should be like to show us very plain, if that we came outward from\r\nthe bushes.\r\n\r\nAnd moreover, there went upward into the everlasting night one of those\r\nTowers of Silence, which did be in this part and that part of the land,\r\nand were thought to hold Strange Watchers. And the Tower stood great and\r\nmonstrous afar off in the midst of the naked rocks, showing very grey\r\nand dim, save when the flare of some great fire did beat upward in the\r\nLand, and sent huge and monstrous lights upon it. And we to have need\r\nalway now to remember this Tower, and to keep the more so to the\r\nsheltered hiding of the bushes. Yet, in verity, we to have little\r\nthought of aught, save of the grim and threatening terror and\r\nmonstrousness which did stand forever upon that low hill, and did be the\r\nHouse of Silence.\r\n\r\nAnd in the eleventh hour, we did go creeping from bush unto bush, and\r\ndid be as shadows that went in the mixt greyness and odd shinings of\r\nthat Land. And the grim and dreadful House did be now unto our right,\r\nand did loom huge and utter silent above us in the night. And the lights\r\nof the House did shine steadfast and deathless with a noiseless shining,\r\nas that they shone out of the quiet of some drear and unnatural\r\nEternity. And there did a seeming of Unholiness to brood in the air, and\r\na sense of all and deathly Knowledge; so that, surely, our hiding did\r\nseem but a futile thing unto our spirits; for it was to us as that we\r\ndid be watched quiet and alway by a Power, as we slipt gentle from bush\r\nunto bush.\r\n\r\nAnd when the twelfth hour did be nigh, we to begin to draw clear of the\r\nHouse; and surely there to come somewhat of ease into my brain and\r\nheart; for it did be as that we should come clear of all harm.\r\n\r\nAnd I turned to the Maid, that I whisper gentle and loving encouragement\r\nunto her. And lo! in that moment, Mine Own gave out a sudden low\r\nsobbing, and was gone still upon the earth. And, truly, my heart did\r\nseem to die in me; for I knew that there did be directed a Force out of\r\nthe House of Silence, which did be aimed unto the Spirit of Mine Own\r\nMaid. And I caught the Maid instant into mine arms, and I set my body\r\nbetween her body and the dreadness of the House; and surely, my spirit\r\nto perceive that there beat out at her a dreadful Force, which did have\r\nin it an utter Silence and a bleakness of Desolation. And lo! I saw in a\r\nmoment that the Force had no power to slay me; but did surely make to\r\nslay the Maid. And I set my Spirit and my Will about her, for a shield,\r\nif this might be, and I had her to mine arms as that she did be mine own\r\nbabe.\r\n\r\nAnd I stood upright, for there did be no more use to hide; and I knew\r\nthat I must walk forever until that I have Mine Own to the Shelter of\r\nthe Mighty Refuge, or to walk until I die; for only with speed might I\r\nsave her from the dread and horrid Malice of that Force.\r\n\r\nAnd I set free the Diskos from my hip, and had it in mine arms beside\r\nthe Maid, and I strode forward out of the bushes, and put forth my\r\nstrength that I journey with an utter speed. And ever my Spirit did know\r\nof that monstrous Force which did be direct upon us, to the Destruction\r\nof Mine Own Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd odd whiles, as I walkt, I called Mine Own by her olden love name,\r\nand by the new name of Naani; but never did she move or seem even that\r\nshe lived; and surely my heart sickened within me with a mighty despair,\r\nso that a constant madness did begin to thrill in me and to make me\r\nsomething monstrous in strength, with my fierce agony and intentness to\r\nsave. And one hope only had I, that I bring her yet living into the\r\nShelter of the Mighty Refuge; and so, swift, to the care of the Doctors.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I did strive to be wise in my despair; for I made a quick\r\nhalting soon, and I warmed a broth of the tablets and water upon a hot\r\nrock, and strove that I set some of the broth between the closed lips of\r\nMine Own Maid; yet did it be useless, as I to have known before in my\r\nheart. And alway I kept my body and my Will and my Spirit and my Love\r\nbetween the Maid and the dreadfulness of the House. And I made some of\r\nthe water, and dasht it upon the face of Mine Own, and I chafed her\r\nhands; but truly it to have no use; neither did I truly to think it\r\nshould be like to.\r\n\r\nAnd I wiped her face then, and harked to her dear heart; and surely it\r\ndid beat, very slow and husht. And afterward, I wrapt her in the cloak.\r\n\r\nAnd I forced myself then that I eat some of the tablets, and I drank a\r\ngreat lot of the water, for a fever did seem to burn in me, and moreover\r\nI to mean that I lack not for strength to my task.\r\n\r\nAnd I set my gear upon me very speedy, and I lifted Mine Own Beloved,\r\nthat did be now so husht, that once had been so merry and dearly\r\nnaughty. And surely, I nigh choked as the thought uprase in me; but I\r\nset it back, and did but go the more furious. And surely no man did ever\r\ngo so fast and constant upon his feet, through an eternity; for I was\r\ncome again to my strength, and there did be a madness of intention and\r\ndespair upon me; and I went on forever.\r\n\r\nAnd at each sixth hour when I stopt very brief to eat and to drink, I\r\nmade to bring Mine Own to her senses; yet she never to come, and alway\r\nher heart to grow the more feeble; so that in the end I did utter fear\r\nto hark; and did but set food and drink into me, and onward again with\r\nan utter fierceness.\r\n\r\nAnd why there came not any Sweet Power of Goodness to help me in my\r\nstrait, I never to know; but did call desperate upon all Good things to\r\naid me, as I went, to save Mine Own. But there naught to come; so that I\r\nhad grown into cursings, but that I did not to lose my wisdom to any\r\nuseless foolishness. And alway, as I went, I to see the Land blindly,\r\nand oft vague and grey as that I did look at naught real, and again with\r\nstrange flashings of light, and the glare of fires; and anon to see the\r\nLand as it did be, and all odd whiles to have now to me the feel of a\r\ndread and monstrous dreaming.\r\n\r\nAnd surely I sped forever through the dreadful hours, and went neither\r\nto the right nor to the left, neither did I strive to hide in the bushes\r\nnor to evade aught, for I knew that the Maid died slowly in mine arms,\r\nand there to be no more gain in life, save by speed, that I have her\r\nswift to the Mighty Pyramid to the care of the Doctors. And a great and\r\ndespairing madness grew ever within me.\r\n\r\nAnd thrice I to have a vague memory that there came creatures at me,\r\nfrom the dark of the Land; but surely I slew them with the Diskos, and\r\nhave no remembering thereof, only that mine anger did boil in me, and I\r\nto know once that the Diskos did run blood in my hand.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! there to come sudden unto my spirit the knowledge that the\r\naether of the world did be stirred. And, indeed, I did be surely sighted\r\nby the great Millions of the Mighty Pyramid. And they to have seen me\r\ncome forward into the sight of the spy-glasses, and that I did bring a\r\nmaid in mine arms out of all the night of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, as I did after learn, the dear Master Monstruwacan had\r\ndiscovered me great hours before; for there had been a steadfast watch\r\nkept in the Tower of Observation for my returning, if that ever I should\r\nreturn; and the might of the Great Spy-Glass had shown me plain a good\r\nwhile gone, and that I did carry somewhat, that was surely the maid that\r\nI did go to find. Yet had the Master given an order that no word be set\r\nabroad to the Peoples, of this discovering, lest that the emotions of\r\nthe Millions to tell overmuch unto the evil Powers of the Land. But now\r\nhad the Millions also come unto knowledge; for many had ceased not to\r\nwatch through their spy-glasses, and the news to travel very speedy\r\nthrough the cities; and surely now there did be a constant spiritual\r\nnoise in the night, to be heard only of the Spirit, yet to suffice to\r\nwake and to warn all that Land.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, as I after to learn, the Master Monstruwacan did know by the\r\ninstruments that there came a force out of the House of Silence, and\r\nthis to trouble him greatly; so that he set the word through the\r\nPyramid, by the Hour-Slips, that all the Peoples strive to contain their\r\nemotion, lest they bring an Harm and a Destruction upon me, by warning\r\nthe Land with the greatness of their feelings.\r\n\r\nYet, in verily, this did be useless; for the Peoples did be very human,\r\nand could nowise check their gladness and great wonder and excitement;\r\nfor it was to them so great a wonder almost as we should suffer if that\r\na man in this Age should go beyond Death in search of his Beloved; and\r\nafterward to come backward unto the Living; and, surely, in such case,\r\nhow mighty should be our amazement; and this to be somewise how they did\r\nbe; yet with it also a sweet and natural gladness and strong welcoming,\r\nwhich doth be the true beat of the Human Heart unto the Wanderer.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, and through all the time that I came forward across the\r\nLand, there did be mayhaps an hundred million that did never cease to\r\nwatch me from the embrasures, from the View-Tables, and from all\r\nvantages. Yet, for a long while, only they which possessed strong\r\nspying-glasses did be abled to see me truly, for I was a great way off.\r\n\r\nAnd millions did but stare vainly unto that part where I was said to be;\r\nand the Hour-Slips to come out four times in the hour, and to tell aught\r\nthat did be known. And so shall you perceive that Humanity did but have\r\ngrown the more Human.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I went forward with all my strength, and did drive\r\nheedless through the miles and the night, and scarce conscious of aught,\r\nbecause of the aching madness of despair that did grow ever within me;\r\nfor I knew that Mine Own Maid died alway in mine arms, as I did carry\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd later, a monstrous space of hours it to seem, I knew that I was come\r\nto that part of the Road, where it did bend somewhat unto the Vale Of\r\nRed Fire; and this did be something anigh to that wilderness where the\r\nYouths did fight with the giant-men.\r\n\r\nAnd I came over the Road, and urged my body utter furious across the\r\nLand. And, surely, in that moment when I cross the Road, great numbers\r\nof the Millions did see me, that had not seen before. And there went a\r\nshaking in the aether of the World, because of the sudden emotion of so\r\nmighty a Multitude; and lo! it did be as that in that moment the Land\r\nwas at last waked; for there came from far away unto the Eastward, a\r\nfaint and dreadful laughter, as that a monstrous Being laught unto\r\nItself in some lost and dreadful country. And the Laughter passed over\r\nthe Land, and did echo strangely, as it did seem, in this part and that\r\npart, and presently to go rolling round in the far and hid West Lands,\r\nand to be as that it wandered awhile amid the far mountains of the Outer\r\nLands, and was presently lost from my hearing.\r\n\r\nAnd my heart chilled a little maybe; but yet did I not care over-much;\r\nfor I to lack all if that I lackt Death, if that I not to be given power\r\nto save Mine Own. Yet did I make a little pause, so that I gat the knife\r\nfrom the belt of the Maid, and did also to bare the Capsule; for if that\r\nthere came a Destruction upon us, I to make instant sure that Mine Own\r\nMaid be safe unto death, and I then to go quickly with the Capsule.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward I again upon my way.\r\n\r\nAnd ever upon each sixth hour I did stop that I eat and drink, and did\r\nonward again, even as a machine; for I commanded myself to this duty of\r\nvictual, that I lack not my strength unto the saving of the Maid. Yet,\r\ntruly, I did seem to choke alway as I strove with the tablets.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! ever as I went forward did the Land awake; and my spirit to know\r\nthat Great Forces did be abroad, restless. And the Monsters to begin\r\nwild roamings, because that they also to know of the Unrest that did be\r\ncome into the Land. And there to go presently odd roarings across the\r\nLand, from night unto night. And I to go forward the more desperate, and\r\nto step neither to the right nor to the left; but to make direct unto my\r\nMighty Home.\r\n\r\nAnd the Vale of Red Fire did be soon afar off unto my right, and the\r\nbulk of the Watcher of the North-East to be somewise unto my left,\r\nbefore me; and the great back to be toward me. And truly, I lookt at the\r\nBrute-Force, and it did be as that I drew nigh unto a Mountain of\r\nWatchfulness; and above it in the everlasting night did be the blue\r\nshining of the luminous ring, and the ring shed a light downward over\r\nthe Monster-Force; and the shoulders did be huge and humpt, even as two\r\nsmall hills, and it lookt forever from me through eternity unto the\r\nPyramid. And this to be plain, though I did be a great way off from it.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden, as I went, there came Somewhat out of a bush unto my left,\r\nand rose up at me, very long and tall; and surely it did be some kind of\r\na man, and came at me. And my fury and my despair came inward upon me in\r\na moment, so that I troubled not to set down the Maid, but leaped at the\r\nthing, where it did be yet half hid in the dark. And lo! it died in\r\npieces, and the Diskos did roar to content my heart an instant. And I\r\nthen onward again the more savage, so that my heart did be a dreadful\r\nthing within me.\r\n\r\nAnd a great while I went then, and do have a vague remembering that this\r\ntime and that there came things at me from out of the dark; but surely\r\nthey to have died very speedy, that I not to remember more.\r\n\r\nAnd the hours did pass in spaces of time that did be made of terror and\r\nnumbness and an utter and evergrowing fury of despair. And I did be at\r\nlast as that I did burn inward with a grim and dreadful energy, and to\r\nseem to grow the less tired, and to come over the Land with a stronger\r\nease and somewhat as that I did desire things to come unto me, that I\r\nhave something to ease my heart; for lo! Mine Own Maid did be dying in\r\nmine arms as I carried her; and I to be in a bleak and sickened dread,\r\nso that I lacked all courage now to listen unto her heart, as I have\r\ntold; and went burning, and dry and hot in the eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd ever there sounded the roarings across the Land; and there did be\r\nadded presently lower and more horrid and dread noises. And later I\r\nheard a far thudding of the earth; and in a little there went past me a\r\ngreat Man, running so heavy that he did make a shaking as he past me;\r\nyet, in verity, by a sweet mercy, he saw me not, and was gone onward in\r\na moment and lost utter into the night. And the aether of the world to\r\nbe full of the trouble of the Peoples, as the Man past me; and afterward\r\nthere to be a stirring of glad thankfulness. And truly, alway my spirit\r\ndid know strangely as in a dream, that the Millions set their sympathy\r\nand pity and help about me, and did girt me about with Human love and\r\nwith encouragement and with uplifted thoughts. Yet, in verity, did all\r\nbe as water beside the fierce wine of my love and despair, which did\r\nurge me onward in a natural lacking of all dread, save for Mine Own. And\r\ntruly this doth be the way of Love, and shall make fearless the heart of\r\nthe weakest. And there to be prayers in the night, and all the aether to\r\nbe surged with the spiritual trouble and callings and cryings of the\r\nMillions; so that, indeed, if that my spirit so to hear these things, it\r\nto be conceived that these do pass outward into the Everlasting, and to\r\nbreak upon the Shore of Eternity in an anguish, even as a visible foam\r\nof supplication.\r\n\r\nAnd surely the unity of love of the Millions did make a natural Force\r\nabout me; for, in verity, the Force that did come from the House to seem\r\nto be somewhat eased from the Maid; yet there to be no surety in this;\r\nfor all did be desperation and turmoil in my heart, and I to have but\r\none thought in my brain, that I bring Mine Own swift across the Land\r\nunto the Mighty Pyramid, and so unto the Doctors.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! there stole presently from afar the deep and dreadful baying of\r\nthe Hounds; so that I knew we did be surely dead, save that a miracle\r\nshould happen. And I askt in my heart in a fierce and mad fashion why\r\nthat they did not to rig one of the olden shooting weapons, that they\r\nshoot from the Pyramid, and so to give me some aid in mine extremity.\r\n\r\nAnd behold, even as I did be so bitter, there went afar upward in the\r\neverlasting night, where did shine the Last Light, the sharp flashings\r\nof the Set Speech; and I did warm in my heart a little with hope; for\r\nthe Master Monstruwacan did see that I was now all discovered, and there\r\nto be no more use for silence, and did speak straight and helpful unto\r\nme. And I made to read the Set Speech, but mine eyes had been mad and\r\nnear blinded with lost hope. But in a moment I saw clear. And behold,\r\nthe dear Master Monstruwacan bid me to keep good my courage, for that\r\nthey did have made ready three of the olden weapons; and moreover, they\r\nto save me, even if that they have to turn loose the Earth-Current over\r\nthe Land. And he commended me with Honour, and that I strive forward yet\r\na little while; for that an Hundred Thousand Men did be Prepared, and\r\ndid even then go downward in their armour by the Lifts.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, as you shall think, my heart eased a little in me, and there\r\nburned somewhat of a hope in my spirit that I yet to bring Mine Own\r\nunto the Doctors, ere it be too late.\r\n\r\nAnd the baying of the Hounds did grow nearer in the night; and there to\r\ngrow ever the roarings over the Land; and a sense of Evil and\r\nmonstrousness to be abroad in all the night.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I to have come by this so that the Watcher of the North-East did\r\nbe backward upon my left; and I lookt keen and fearful now at the\r\nMonster-Force; and behold, the great bell-ear did quiver continually, so\r\nthat I saw the Monster made somewhat known unto all the Land. And the\r\nMonster did look as ever, unto the Pyramid; and did be a great and\r\nsilent Hill of Life that did lean toward the Pyramid; and the light from\r\nthe Ring came downward upon the monstrous hide, which did be set in vast\r\nfolds and wrinkles upon it. And the Monster to know of me; yet never to\r\nmove, neither to show life, save that the ear did quiver so horridly.\r\n\r\nAnd I knew that they made some great preparation in the Pyramid for our\r\ndefence; for all the night did begin now to shake and to quiver with the\r\nmighty beat of the Earth-Current.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nIN THE COUNTRY OF SILENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I did be come something nigh unto the Mighty Pyramid; and my\r\ngreat Home went up vast into the everlasting night, as a very Mountain\r\nof sweet Life and Safety, and had surely amazed me afresh with the utter\r\nBigness of it, only that despair and weariness did have too grim an hold\r\nupon my heart for me to care of aught, save to have Mine Own Maid within\r\nthe safe wonder of the huge Refuge. And it did be still afar off from\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnd I to go forward across the Land with a strong going; and lo! as I\r\npast a hollow place where did burn a fire-hole, there came something out\r\nof the hollow. And the thing gat upward from crawling, and did be a\r\ngreat and haired Man. And the Man lookt at me, and afterward came unto\r\nme, and did put his hands forward, very eager, as he came. And I did see\r\nthe hands plain in the light from the fire-hole, and the hands were\r\nmonstrous, and did be armed brutish with horrid claws, so that the Man\r\nshould have been able to rip aught, even as a wild beast.\r\n\r\nAnd I put Mine Own very swift to the earth; and surely, I cared not for\r\nlife or aught; for this thing did make to delay me, and I to be fierce\r\nwith despair that aught should halt me. And lo! I leaped very furious\r\nand with cold anger at the giant; and I smote at the monstrous brute;\r\nbut he unto the side in an instant of time, and so escaped the blow. And\r\nhe flung forth his monstrous arm out of the half-dark of a shadow that\r\ndid be cast by the dance of the fire-hole, and caught my head-piece and\r\npluckt it from me so strong and brutish that he cast me nigh a dozen\r\nfeet on to my back. Yet I was not harmed in the life, but only sore\r\nshaked and bruised; and I to be up in a moment, and came in upon the\r\ngiant, and the Diskos did roar and blaze in my hands as I swung the\r\nweapon. And I gat the giant above the middle part, and the Diskos did\r\nglut itself, and went through the giant as that he did be naught, though\r\nso huge and monstrous and girt with strength. And he to have surely\r\nturned his shoulders as he died; for the upper part of the giant-man\r\nwent horrid to the earth, and the legs and the trunk stood plain in the\r\nlight of the fire-hole, and the blood went upward as a fountain in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAnd I made no pause, but leaped unto the Maid, and had her in a moment\r\nto mine arms, and onward again past that dead thing, that did only then\r\nto fall with an horrid sound. And surely the night did be full of an\r\nastonishment and upliftedness of the Millions, so that their spiritual\r\ncryings did go all about me, and did tell me that they had perceived\r\nthis thing, and did cast their love and delight unto me, and a vast\r\nexcitement to be upon them.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I scarce to have gone a great mile more, but there came two\r\nvague things out of a dark place, where certain rocks did upstand; and I\r\nsmote them with the Diskos, and went onward; but what they did be, I\r\nnever to know.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, after that, I did seem to go smiting forever; for there to\r\ncome, time and oft, strange things out from the bushes and the rocks, as\r\nthat all the Land did be a-crawl with foul and monstrous life, and I to\r\ngo smiting, as in a dream, and to speed forward ever with a more fierce\r\ndespair; for surely the end of our lives did be come, and I not to be\r\ngiven power to save Mine Own Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd all the Land did be full of grim and monstrous roarings, and\r\nodd-wise lower sounds, very deadly. And once I did hear the noise of\r\ngiants running. And all the night to be Evil. And, in verity, how I did\r\nnot be slain by some dread Force, I not to know, unless that I did be\r\nburned free of all weakness that an Evil Power should have chance to\r\nharm me through; for, indeed, I had been dealt a bitter training a\r\nmonstrous time.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! there to be again the deep and dreadful baying of the\r\nNight-Hounds unto the South-East, and to be nearer; and I to know now\r\nthat no strength of mine should serve to protect Mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! from the upwardness of the night, where did be the Last Light,\r\nthere sudden to come downward a strange blue flash, that smote downward\r\ninto the Land unto the South-East. And again the flash to come, and\r\nmayhap a score times after; and there to come down out of the height a\r\npeculiar crackling sound, that did be less than the thunder of this age,\r\nyet more loud than any other sound that you ever to hear. And lo! I knew\r\nthat the Humans did begin to fight for me, that I bring Mine Own safe\r\nunto Home.\r\n\r\nAnd behold! it did be as that all the wakefulness of the Land that had\r\nbeen, did be but as sleep, beside the wakefulness that now to come; for\r\nsurely the Night now to seem to rock with the roarings of the Monsters,\r\nand with the be-stirring of Great Forces. And ever there to go over the\r\nLand the yowling of that strange and dreadful Laughter, which did come\r\nfrom that hid Country in the night of the lost East.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! there arose constant now the hoarse and dreadful bayings of the\r\nHounds, and made known that a mighty pack did be out. And they to seem\r\nto be no more, maybe, than a good mile unto the South-East; and I to be\r\nall alone, save for the dying Maid that I held in mine arms. And I lookt\r\nvainly and with despair for the Hundred Thousand that did be Prepared,\r\nand had come downward, as you do know, unto mine aid. But truly, there\r\ndid be naught to see anywheres, save the strange lights and shadows of\r\nthe Land; and the movement of monstrous life in this place and that\r\nplace. And the Hounds to come nearer with every moment of time; so that\r\nindeed, I knew that death did be very nigh.\r\n\r\nAnd I ceased not from my stride; but went forward, and did begin to run;\r\nfor the Pyramid was not a huge way off in the night; and the shine of\r\nthe Circle about it, to be plain seen, save here and there, where it did\r\nbe hid strangely. And I to have a despairing hope that I come yet with\r\nMine Own into the safety of the Circle.\r\n\r\nAnd the baying of the Hounds to come ever the more near; and surely it\r\ndid be a doubly hideous bitter thing that I lose My Dear One, so nigh\r\nunto Home; and the great Mountain of my Home to go upward before me into\r\nthe night, and to seem so near that surely I did be almost there; but\r\nyet, mayhap, two great miles off, even then. And, behold, I called out\r\nin vain despair and to no end, why that none come to give me aid in this\r\nextremity; for the Hounds did bay now but the half of a great mile, upon\r\nmy left, and did surely have scent of me, by the way of their dreadful\r\nbaying.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, the Millions to have an anguish of sympathy for me; for the\r\nspiritual noise of their emotion did be plain unto my spirit; and they\r\nsurely to have seen and to have interpreted the way that I did look\r\nabout me and appear to call out in despair; for there came all about me\r\nin a moment the companioning of a great and sweet spiritual force, which\r\ndid be bred of their quick going with me in their understanding and\r\nlove; and they to have perceived how that I did be unto the end of hope;\r\nand the Hounds to be almost upon me.\r\n\r\nAnd in this moment, there came afresh to my hearing the shaking beat of\r\nthe Earth-Current; so that I knew the Humans to take desperate means to\r\nsave. And there came to my view a vast pack of the Hounds unto my left,\r\nand they came running at a great pace, and their heads did be low, and\r\nthey to be so great as horses; and seen plain, and again in shadow, all\r\nin the same moment, as they did come.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I knew that we two to be dead indeed ere a minute be\r\ngone, if that the Humans not to haste. And I stood where I did be; for\r\nthere was no more use to run; and I lookt from the Hounds unto the\r\nMighty Pyramid, and again to the Hounds. And again I lookt with my hope\r\ngone, unto the Pyramid; for the Hounds did be scarce two hundred fathoms\r\noff from me; and there did be hundreds of the mighty beasts. And lo!\r\neven as I lookt that last time unto the Pyramid, there brake out a\r\nmonstrous bursting flame, that did rush downward from the Sealed lower\r\npart of the Mighty Pyramid. And the flame smote downward upon the Land\r\nwhere the Hounds did run, and all the Night to be lost from my sight in\r\nthe brightness and strangeness of that mighty flame; so that I saw no\r\nmore the Pyramid, or aught; but only the shining and dreadful glory of\r\nthat flame. And the Flame made a blast in the Night, and a hotness that\r\ndid seem to wither me, even where I did be from it. And I perceived that\r\nthe Humans had truly turned loose the Earth-Current upon the Hounds,\r\nthat I be saved. And there went a constant great thundering over the\r\nLand, because that the Earth-Force did rend and split the air, and did\r\ntear up the earth. And the roaring of the Monsters did be husht and lost\r\nin that mighty sound; and I to see no place where the Hounds did be; but\r\nonly flames and broken lands where the Earth-Force did strike; and great\r\nrocks did be hurled all whithers, with a vast noise; and truly it did be\r\na mercy that I was not slain an hundred times, if this might be, by the\r\nfailings and burstings of great rocks and boulders.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in a moment the Humans did cut off the Earth-Force, and had it\r\nagain to their control. And there to seem now a great silence upon the\r\nLand, and an utter dark; save that flames and noise came from that part\r\nwhere the Current did strike. And I very speedy to come free of the\r\ndazedness that had me, and made again to my running; for, in truth, it\r\nto seem now that I should yet be let to win unto safety with Mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd mine eyes did grow presently unto their accustomed using; and I to\r\nlook all ways about me, lest there come somewhat upon me even then to\r\nwork our deaths. And for a good time there to be naught that I did see\r\nanywheres, neither there to be the wakeful sounds of the Land, save only\r\nthe grim and horrid Laughter from afar in the dead East.\r\n\r\nAnd oft as I did run, I to stare hungry hearted upward at the Mighty\r\nPyramid; and surely it alway now to seem to be less bright than before.\r\nAnd in the first, I to set this to the count that mine eyes did be yet\r\ndazed by the great Flame of the Earth-Force; but soon I to perceive that\r\nit did be otherwise; and that there did be truly a less brightness of\r\nthe light that did shine throughout all the Mighty Redoubt. And this\r\nlack I conceived had owing to that great using of the force and power of\r\nthe Earth-Current that had been loosed to save us. And I to have this\r\nnew thing cold upon my heart; for, truly, if that the Force of the\r\nCurrent to be made over low, there to be a danger for all the Humans\r\nthat did live, even for all the great Millions of the Mighty Refuge. And\r\nthis, did be surely known by the Masters; and they to have no more power\r\nto aid me with the Current, until it flow strong again, lest that they\r\ndestroy all the Peoples of the Earth. And all this to be plain to me in\r\na moment, as I ran; and I to be but the more desperate to come unto\r\ninstant safety with the Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I to be yet in expecting of the Hundred Thousand to come\r\nunto me; but they not to come. And all about me the Land to begin again\r\nto give out the noises of the Monsters; and to send forth new and\r\npeculiar noises, as that there did be more awaked in the Land than did\r\nbe ever heard by me before. And presently, I saw that there went living\r\nthings, creeping, between me and the light of the Circle. And I to know\r\nthat I yet to have to fight bitter, if that I would bring the Maid safe.\r\nAnd I swung the Diskos free, and ran on.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden my Spirit to know that I did be warned of some new peril; and\r\nI to look upward into the night, that the Master Monstruwacan should\r\nmayhap to tell me the danger, by the Set Speech. But, in truth, there\r\ncame not the quick flashings of the Set Speech; but only an upward\r\nstillness, and a dimness of the lights of the Mighty Pyramid. And\r\nafterward, I to learn that the dear Master Monstruwacan made to warn me\r\nof danger; but that all the instruments of the Tower of Observation to\r\nfail to work, and likewise all the machinery of the Pyramid to cease,\r\neven unto the moving of the great lifts, and the moan of the Air Pumps;\r\nand all to have been this way for nigh a great hour, until that the\r\nEarth-Current did flow again more full. And surely, this doth show that\r\nDeath did nigh to come unto all the Millions, because of the great trial\r\nthat did be made to save us.\r\n\r\nBut, truly, my spirit did be warned by the trouble of the Millions, and\r\nbecause the Master Monstruwacan called vaguely with his brain-elements;\r\nso that I went ever more warily, and did look all ways. And lo! sudden\r\nI to stare above me into the night; and there to be a pale circle, very\r\nquiet and steadfast that did go alway over the twain of us. And I saw\r\nthat this did be surely one of those sweet Powers of Holiness, that did\r\nstand between our souls and some dread Power that came anigh to work our\r\nDestruction. And I to have no over-fear; but did put my trust in the\r\nForce of Holiness, and went forward, running warily.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I came mayhap so nigh as to within four hundred paces of the\r\nCircle; and I to think that I yet to win Mine Own safe and undelayed\r\nwithin the guarding of the Circle. And the light of the Circle did burn\r\ndim; so that I had sudden fear whether that it be any more use for a\r\nGuard, until that the Earth-Current to come more free. And all this as I\r\nran, swift and wary and utter anxious.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in that moment in a dim place there rose up three beast-men from\r\nthe earth, and came at me, growling. And the first did be so close that\r\nI had no room to the Diskos; but beat in the head of the man with the\r\nhaft-part. And I leaped unto the side then, and swung the Diskos, and\r\ndid be utter mad, yet chill, with fury; so that the Maid did be no more\r\nthan a babe in the crook of mine arm. And I came in sudden to meet the\r\ntwo beast-men as they ran at me; and I cut quick and light with the\r\ngreat Weapon, and did have that anger upon me which doth make the heart\r\na place of cold and deadly intent; so that I had a wondrous and brutal\r\njudgement to the slaying. And, truly, I slew them as that they had been\r\nno more than mice; and I had no harm, neither so much as a touch from\r\nthem. And, behold! in that moment there came a great Shout of wonder and\r\nof welcome from within the Circle. And I lookt swiftly, and began again\r\nto run; for there did be men in grey armour all within the Circle; yet\r\ncame they not to mine aid.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in a moment I knew why that the Hundred Thousand did have held\r\noff from me in mine extremity; for, behold! there did be monstrous Black\r\nMounds all along without of the Circle, and did rock and sway with a\r\nforce of strange life that did set an horror into my soul as I ran; for\r\ntruly they did be the visible signs of monstrous Forces of Evil. And did\r\nany Human have ventured outward beyond the Circle, then had that man\r\nbeen Destroyed in the Spirit, and lost utterly; so that none had dared\r\nto come; neither had it been of use if any had made themselves to be a\r\nsacrifice to aid me; for, truly, they to have been of no use, when dead,\r\nas you shall say.\r\n\r\nAnd there came a constant shouting from the Hundred Thousand to me, that\r\nI haste, and indeed to haste. And truly I did haste with all my\r\nstrength. And I lookt unto the dear Circle of Holiness that did be above\r\nus twain; and it to go steadfast over us; so that I saw we to be surely\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I to be no more than an hundred paces now from the glowing of\r\nthe Circle. And behold! even in that instant, there must come brutal\r\nthings to destroy us; for there came an herd of squat and brutish men\r\nall about me in a moment from the shadows, where they had been hid. And\r\nthey caught at me, and caught at the Maid to tear her from mine arm. And\r\ntruly, it did be as that they surely to have success; for I could nowise\r\nin a moment free myself, and yet to guard the Maid and to use the\r\nDiskos. And lo! I kickt with my metal boots, and gave from them, and\r\nturned all ways in a moment, and wrenched free; and I leaped back; and\r\nthe herd of horrid brutes after me.\r\n\r\nAnd now I to have space for the Diskos, and a grimness in my heart; and\r\nI came round very sudden, and ran in among the men, smiting. And I hit\r\nvery swift both from the right and the left, and to and fro with a\r\nconstant quick circling. And the Diskos did spin and roar, and made a\r\nstrange light upon the faces of the men, and they to have tusks like to\r\nthe tusks of pigs. And surely I did rage through them, smiting. And they\r\nto strike me a thousand times with great stones, so that mine armour\r\nrang, and was all fresh burst, and I near to sicken under the blows and\r\nnew wounds; but they not to harm the Maid, for I carried her above their\r\nsquat and brutish reach.\r\n\r\nAnd the brute-men to seem without end. But I made alway forward unto the\r\nglowing of the Circle; and the night to be full in that place of the\r\nfierce shoutings of the Hundred Thousand; and many--as I did learn--to\r\nhave tried to come unto me, but that their comrades held them from so\r\nuseless a dying.\r\n\r\nAnd, in verity, I to be now scarce fifty paces from the glowing of the\r\nCircle; and did be nigh to fall; for I did be so utter dazed and wounded\r\nwith the fight, and ill with a vast weariness and the despair and\r\nmadness of my journey, and moreover, as you do know, I not to have\r\nslept, but to have carried the Maid forever through days and nights, and\r\nto have fought oft.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! the Hundred Thousand stood just within the Circle, and they that\r\nwere to the front did swing each man the Diskos; and they hurled each\r\nthe Diskos in among the herd of the tuskt men that did make to slay me.\r\nAnd surely this to save me; for the herd did thin to my front; and I to\r\ngather my strength, and to charge with despair, and to smite and never\r\nbe ceased of smiting; so that there did be dead creatures all about. And\r\nbehold! I brake through the herd, with Mine Own, and did be upon the\r\nCircle. And lo! I stept over the Circle, that did scarce now to give out\r\na Resistance; and a thousand hands did come forward to give me help; yet\r\ndid none touch me, but gave back from me; for there did be that about me\r\nwhich held them off, as with a little awe; for I to be strange unto\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd I stood there in a great silence, and the Diskos in my hand ran\r\nblood to the haft. And maybe I rockt as I stood; for many again did put\r\nout their hands, as to hold me, and again drew back, and were silent.\r\n\r\nAnd I lookt unto them, and they lookt back at me; and I did gasp\r\nawhile, and was strangely dazed, and did try to tell them that I had\r\nneed of the Doctors for the Life of Mine Own Maid, that did be dying in\r\nmine arms. And behold, in that moment, there did be a sound of giants\r\nrunning, out in the night. And some then to cry out different matters,\r\nto aid me, and to beware of the giants, and to bring the Doctors to\r\nattend me on the instant.\r\n\r\nAnd other voices did call that the Holy Light was gone from above; and\r\nlikewise the Black Mounds from the outer part of the Circle. And there\r\ndid be a monstrous noise of roarings in the Land, and all to come\r\nbewildered unto my brain, which did surely fail now with the grim and\r\nutter stress which had been mine so long.\r\n\r\nAnd there to be also a constant noise that came from near and from\r\nupward; and truly I to know, as in a dream, that it did be made of the\r\nshouting of the great Millions, that did make an eternal and vague\r\nroaring-sound upward in the night, that did come down from the upper\r\nheights, no more loud than a strange and continual murmuring out of the\r\nlofty miles.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I to find my voice in a little minute, and did ask a near\r\nman whether there be any Doctors with the men. And in that moment there\r\ncame forward a Master of the Diskos, which doth be as a Commander of\r\nthis age. And he made the Salute of Honour with the Diskos, and would\r\nhave eased the Maid from me; but I to ask again, very slow, whether that\r\nthere was a Doctor a-near. And he on the instant to give an order; and\r\nthe great thousands to begin to shape, and did make a mighty lane unto\r\nthe Great Gateway of the Mighty Pyramid.\r\n\r\nAnd the Master of the Diskos made a sign to certain that did be near;\r\nand they stood about me, as I to know dully, lest I fall; but they not\r\nto touch me; for I did be as that I must not be laid hand upon; for I\r\ndid near to choke with despair lest I to have come Home too late; and\r\nsurely, also, the men to seem as that I did be strange unto them.\r\n\r\nAnd there went orders swift and constant this way and that; and lo! in a\r\nlittle while, there came two big men of the Upward Cities, running; and\r\nthey had a little man between them upon a sling. And the little man did\r\nbe a Master of the Doctors; and he aided me gentle to lay Mine Own Maid\r\nupon the earth. And the Master of the Diskos made a sign, and the men\r\nthat did be near, turned each his back; and the Doctor to make\r\nexamination for the life of Mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd there to come about that time a seeming of silence in the land. And\r\ntruly the Hundred Thousand did be utter quiet; and a great quiet in the\r\nMighty Pyramid; for, in truth, all to know, by this, that there to be a\r\nfear that the Maid I did bring out of the night, did be slain by the\r\nEvil Forces.\r\n\r\nAnd sudden the little man that did be the Master Doctor, lookt up quiet\r\nand piteous at me; so that I knew in a moment that Mine Own Maid did be\r\ndead. And he to see that I knew; and he covered the face of Mine Own,\r\nand stood up very speedy; and he called softly to the men that did be to\r\nmy back, and he signed to them that some to support me, and some to lift\r\nMine Own Maid, and bear her unto the Great Gateway. And he lookt keen at\r\nme; and I to fight a little that I breathe; and afterward did make with\r\nmy hands, that the men not to come near me, neither to touch Mine Own.\r\nAnd the Master Doctor to understand that I did be truly strong until I\r\ndie, and did beckon the men from me, and from the Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd I stoopt, in a little, and I lifted Mine Own Maid into mine arms for\r\nthat last journeying.\r\n\r\nAnd I came down the mighty lane of the Hundred Thousand, all in their\r\ngrey armour. And they did make silent salute with the Diskos reversed,\r\neach man as I passed him, and did be utter silent. And I scarce to wot\r\nof aught, save that all the world did be quiet and emptied, and my task\r\nto have failed, and Mine Own to lie dead in mine arms. Yet, truly, did\r\nit to have failed utter? for I had surely saved Mine Own from the terror\r\nof the Second Night Land, and she not to have come alone and with\r\nmadness unto her death; but to have died in mine arms; and she surely to\r\nhave been comforted within her spirit, because that my love did be so\r\nutter about her. And I to think vaguely and terribly on an hundred sweet\r\nlove actions that she to have shown unto me; and sudden I did remember\r\nwith a dreadful pain how that I never to have waked to discover Mine Own\r\nMaid kissing me in my sleep, as I to have meant. And a madness of\r\nanguish did flash sudden through the numbness upon my brain; so that I\r\ndid be blinded a little, and surely went crooked in my walk; for I to\r\nknow, sudden, that the Master Doctor steadied mine elbow for a moment;\r\nbut afterward did leave me be, as I to have again control of my spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! as I drew nigh unto the Great Gateway, the lights of the Pyramid\r\nto begin to glow again more strong, and the machinery of the Lifts and\r\nthe Air Pumps to work, because that now the Earth-Current did grow once\r\nmore to natural strength. And they to have power now to open the Great\r\nGate, which did be done by great machines.\r\n\r\nAnd there to come forth to meet me a number of the Masters of the Mighty\r\nPyramid; and the dear Master Monstruwacan did come before them all, so\r\neager as that he did be mine own Father. And he to have heard somewhat,\r\nvaguely, that there to have been a fear for the life of the maid that I\r\ndid bring.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, he did be told by one near to the Gateway, that the Maid did\r\nbe dead in mine arms; for he and all the Masters did pause and stand\r\nsilent for me to go by, and did reverse each his Diskos; and this to\r\nhave been an Honour shown, than which there did be scarce any greater.\r\n\r\nAnd there went a constant murmuring up in the night, which did be the\r\nspeech of the Millions, questioning. And the news that the Maid did be\r\ndead, went upward through the miles. And my spirit to know, as in a\r\ndream, of the spiritual noise which did go outward through all space,\r\nand did be the grief of the Multitudes, as they did hear this thing.\r\nYet, truly, there did nothing comfort me anywise; neither I proper yet\r\nto know the verity of my loss; for I did go stunned.\r\n\r\nAnd I came in through the Great Gateway, and the Full Watch did stand\r\nthere silent in their armour; and they made the Salute of Honour. And I\r\nwent onward with the dead Maid that I did bring out of Eternity.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, they that were around, did guide me, with the Maid in\r\nmine arms, unto the Great Lift. And I took Mine Own Maid into the Great\r\nLift; and the Masters came with me, and did be in their armour; and none\r\ndid speak to me. And the Master Monstruwacan and the Master of the\r\nDoctors stood silent to the side of me. And there did be everywhere\r\ngreat Multitudes, that I did see vaguely; but my spirit not to wot of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I stood very quiet and dumb as we did go upward through the\r\nmiles; and the Millions of the Cities stood about the Great Lift, and\r\nthere did be a great silence upward and downward through the strange\r\nmiles; save for the weeping of women in dear sympathy, that did sound\r\nfar and low and constant.\r\n\r\nAnd presently I to know that the Master Monstruwacan and the Master of\r\nthe Doctors did look one to the other; and I to be aware sudden that I\r\nstood in my blood; for I did be wounded in an hundred parts, and the\r\nblood to go alway from me. Yet did the Master Doctor be slow to do aught\r\nfor me, because that he to perceive that I did be slain in the heart;\r\nand there to be no pain so dreadful as that he should be like to wake me\r\nunto, if that he went hastily.\r\n\r\nYet, presently, there did come whirlings into my head; and someone did\r\nsurely make to ease Mine Own Maid from mine arms. But I held her,\r\ndumbly; and the blood to go the more from me; and they not to know what\r\nshould be done. And I to look at them. And the dear Master Monstruwacan\r\ndid be saying somewhat unto me, that I did have no power to hear; but\r\nonly to know that his face did be very human. And there went a strange\r\nnoise all about me; and the Master Monstruwacan to seem to hold me up,\r\nand to beckon to some that did be to my back. And lo! there came a\r\nblackness, and the gentleness of arms about mine armour....\r\n\r\nAnd I to come presently to quietness and to half-dreams; and did alway\r\nto seem that I carried Mine Own Maid in mine arms. But truly there did\r\npass three great days, whilst that I did be thus. And I all that while\r\nto be laid quiet, and to be tended by the Master Doctor, and aided by\r\nall knowledge that did be known of Humans.\r\n\r\nAnd on the third day, as it might be called, I to come full unto my\r\nsenses; and the pain to take me in the breast; and the Master of the\r\nDoctors did be with me, and they that nurst me; and the Master Doctor\r\nwatched me very keen and gentle.\r\n\r\nAnd I did be in a bed of the Health Room of mine own city. And I gat\r\nfrom the bed, and the Doctor to say naught; but only to watch me. And I\r\nwalkt to and fro a little, and he alway to watch me; and presently he\r\ngave me somewhat to drink; and I drank. And I was gone soon from all\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nAnd I to come again unto a knowing that I yet to live; and there went a\r\ncertain strength in my body. And lo! the first that I did see, was the\r\nMaster of the Doctors; and I to perceive in a moment that he had wakened\r\nme, and had nurst my strength for that moment, that I live through the\r\nBurial. For he to be very wise, and to have known from that first seeing\r\nof me, that I not to live after that Mine Own did die.\r\n\r\nAnd there was brought to me a loose garment; but I to refuse the\r\ngarment, dumbly, and did look about me very troubled and forgetting. And\r\nthe Master Doctor lookt alway at me; and lo! in a moment he called one,\r\nand gave an order. And there was brought in then my broken armour, and a\r\ngarment to wear below. And I then to know that I did be content in this\r\nmatter; and the Doctor alway to watch me. And they drest me in my broken\r\narmour.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, as they drest me, my spirit to hear the sorrow and sympathy\r\nof the Multitudes, and did know that they went downward by millions,\r\nunto the Country of Silence.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! in that moment when I near to be in mine armour, I to mind\r\nsudden again that I never to have waked to discover Mine Own Maid\r\nkissing me in my sleep. And the Pain gat me in the breast, so that I had\r\nsurely ended then, but that the Master Doctor set somewhat to my breath,\r\nthat eased me, and gave something of dullness unto my senses for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nAnd I did be carried then in a sling unto the Great Lift, and there did\r\nbe a bed in the lift, and the Doctor to have me to lie upon the bed; and\r\nI to know that he also to know that I never to need a bed any more;\r\nneither should I ever to come upward again in the Lift.\r\n\r\nAnd truly the Mighty Pyramid did be an emptyness; for there did seem to\r\nbe left only the Stress Masters that did arrange the moving of the\r\nMillions. And the Stress Masters did stand about the Lift, as we dropt\r\ndownward through the great miles unto the Underground Fields. And we\r\ncame downward in the last unto the Country of Silence, which did lie an\r\nhundred miles deep in the world, and did be an hundred miles every way\r\nof Silence unto the Dead.\r\n\r\nAnd they that were with me, gat me from the Lift, and did mean to carry\r\nme in the sling unto The Last Road. But I stood upon my feet, and made\r\nthat I should walk, and I held out my hand for the Diskos, which one did\r\ncarry. And the Master Doctor signed that they should obey me, as my\r\nspirit to know. And I walkt very steadfast down the Way that did lead\r\nunto The Last Road; and the Master Doctor walkt behind me, a little\r\nspace off.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, there did be all the Peoples of the World in that great\r\nCountry; and the Peoples did be spread out forever, so far as my seeing\r\ndid go; and they to have sight of me; and all the aether did be stirred\r\nwith the humanness of their sorrow and their kind sympathy. And there\r\ngrew a murmur, which did be like to a low rolling thunder, and did be\r\nthe voices of the Peoples. And the rolling of that great husht Sound\r\nwent to and fro across that mighty Country of Quiet; and there to be\r\nafterward an utter silence.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw below me the place of the Last Rest, where did be the\r\nbeginning of The Last Road; and there did lie there a little figure,\r\ncovered with a white robe, that did glimmer with the beauteous work of\r\nwomen that had stitcht love and honour into that Last Garment. And\r\nsurely, I to rock upon my feet, and to steady myself with the Diskos;\r\nand the Master Doctor to be unto my side in a moment, and gave me again\r\nsomething that I breathe-in. But, indeed, I to refuse, after that I had\r\ntaken one breath of the drug; for I to be able to bear my pain the\r\nlittle time that I now to have to live; and I to mean that I have no\r\ndimness of my senses for those short minutes that I should have yet near\r\nunto Mine Own. And truly the Master Doctor did not press me anywise, but\r\nhad a perfect understanding, and went quiet again to the rearward.\r\n\r\nAnd I came soon to that place where Mine Own Dead One did lie; and the\r\nMaster Monstruwacan stood to her feet, and did be clothed in grey\r\narmour, and had the Diskos reversed; and this to be for an Honour unto\r\nMy Dead Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd there kneeled two maids in white, one to the right and one to the\r\nleft of Mine Own, and they to be for Faithfulness, and did be maids,\r\nbecause that they watched by a maid; and had likewise been matrons, if\r\nthat the Dead had been wife unto any.\r\n\r\nAnd the place at the Head of the Last Rest did be empty, and did be for\r\nme; and he that stood to the head, did be for Love; for it did be the\r\nchief, and did hold dominion over and did make to live both Faithfulness\r\nand Honour. And this to be the way of the Burial alway.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I took my courage into my heart; and I stood to the head of Mine\r\nOwn Maid; and I lookt down upon the wondrous white glory of the garment,\r\nwhich did be white because that Mine Own did be a Maid; yet did be\r\nworked with yellow Flowers of Weeping, as we did call them, because that\r\nshe had died in love. And I to know that no hand had toucht that\r\nwonderful garment, save the hands of maidens.\r\n\r\nAnd behold! as I stood there, from far away over the Land, there did\r\ncome a far and faint sound; and the sound did come more nigh, so that I\r\nknew that afar off, beyond the Hills of the Babes, the Millions did\r\nbegin to sing the Calling Song, where Million did call husht unto\r\nMillion, and the sound did come onward toward where we did be, and did\r\ngo over us, and pass onward in a husht and wondrous breathing of sound,\r\nas that all the Love that did be ever in this world, did call in a low\r\nanguish unto a lost Beloved. And the sound to pass away and away over\r\nthat mighty Country in the deep Earth, and did hush and hush unto a\r\ngreat and utter silence, save for a faint murmur of countless women\r\nweeping, that did be in the air of that Land of Quiet.\r\n\r\nAnd there to be a space of silence, and again the silence to be broken\r\nby a far sound; and there to come again from beyond the far Hills of the\r\nBabes a strange and low sound, and did be as of a wind wandering through\r\ndamp forests. And the sound grew, and came across the Hills of the\r\nBabes, and did be breathed forth by Million after Million, so that in a\r\nlittle I to hear the Song of Weeping sung very low and sorrowful by the\r\nmultitudes. And the Song came onward over all that great Country, and\r\npast over us, and went onward into the far Land beyond the Dome, and did\r\nbe caught by the voices of Millions that did be hid in great distances,\r\nand so to go onward forever, and to die at last unto a mighty silence.\r\n\r\nAnd the Master Monstruwacan lookt at me from the feet of Mine Own Maid,\r\nand I to know that the moment did be come when I to part from the Maid\r\nNaani forever and forever, even though I to live in some strange future,\r\nand to find her soul in some other sweet child. And I stoopt and laid\r\nthe Diskos beside Mine Own Maid there upon the Last Rest; and the two\r\nmaids drew back the light wonder of the Garment, and showed me the face\r\nof Mine Own, and she to sleep there forever so sweet and husht as a\r\nchild, and as oft I to have seen her to sleep. And I lookt a little\r\nwhile, and the pain of my heart did be sufficient, so that I knew I died\r\nas I lookt. And once more I lookt, and I set my soul about Mine Own. And\r\nI fought with myself, and stood upward, and the maids did cover the face\r\nof Mine Own Maid.\r\n\r\nAnd the Master Monstruwacan commended Naani unto Eternity. And he raised\r\nthe Diskos reversed; and lo! the Road did begin to move upward unto the\r\nDome, and Mine Own Maid did be upon the Road; and I to fight that I keep\r\nbreathing; so that I not to die before she be lost utter to my sight.\r\n\r\nAnd there did rise now a sound from all that Country that had no order\r\nin it; and did be like to a low moaning that did fill all the air of\r\nthe Land; and there to be also a constant sound, as of a little\r\nwhistling dree wind that did be in all that Country of Quiet; and truly\r\nthis to be more than any singing; for it to be the true weeping of\r\nmultitudes, that did sorrow from the heart, with the grief of this thing\r\nthat did be.\r\n\r\nAnd I stood utter still, and did draw my breath very even, and lookt\r\nunto that small form that did be now afar off where it did lie upon the\r\nmoving Roadway. And I gazed, as that my soul and all my being did have\r\nno power else, even as a man that dies, doth set all his strength to a\r\nlast movement. And I not to wot that the Master Monstruwacan and the two\r\nmaids did hold me up, because they to perceive that I did be dying; for\r\nI only to see Mine Own Little One lying afar off upon the moving of the\r\nLast Road.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid in that moment to come to the place where the Road did pass\r\ninto the strange and luminous vapour of the Earth-Current, which did lie\r\nall about the base of the Dome; and the vapour to be only as a faint\r\nshining smoke, scarce seen, yet to be enough to give something of\r\nuncertainty to the Dead, when that they did have past inward of it.\r\n\r\nAnd I stared, with all that did be left of my strength; for Mine Own to\r\nbe gone utter and forever in but a little minute. And the uncertainty of\r\nthe luminous vapour did cling about her, and to make her to seem unreal\r\nto my gaze; for the vapour did be in constant movement, and to give a\r\nseeming of shifting to and fro of all that did be in it.\r\n\r\nAnd behold! as I did stare, with my dreadful pain, there did be sudden a\r\nstrange hoarse noise from the nearer Millions. And lo! in an instant\r\nthere came a mighty Shout out of all that Country; and the shout did be\r\nmade again, and did grow into a mighty hoarse roaring from the Millions,\r\nso that all that great Country did be filled with the monstrous sound.\r\nAnd, in verity, I to have seen the thing, likewise; but to have set it\r\nto the madness of longing of my heart and to that desperate and dreadful\r\npain which did make me to be crazed and lost from all sane thinking.\r\n\r\nAnd the thing that I did see, had been that the Maid did seem to move,\r\nthere upon the Last Road, where she did lie; but indeed, this to have\r\nappeared only to be the stirring of the luminous vapour of the\r\nEarth-Current, which did seem to make things shift, as I have told.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I now to see truly that the Maid did move where she was laid\r\nafar off upon the Road; and I now to know, and to believe that she did\r\nindeed live. And my life came into me with a bounding; yet did my heart\r\nseem to be a moment stilled in my breast. And the Master Monstruwacan to\r\nhave signed already that the Roadway be stopt, and brought backward; but\r\nI to be now upon the Last Road, and did run as a madman, shouting vainly\r\nupon the name of Mine Own. And I to learn afterward that there to have\r\nbeen a dreadful peril that all the near Millions to rush toward the Last\r\nRoad, and so, mayhap, to have caused the death of many, and to have\r\nbeen like to have crusht Mine Own. But this danger to have been eased,\r\nbecause that the Watch Master did act very prompt, and set the great\r\nregiments of his men to keep back the Millions, and did send a signal\r\nabroad over all the Country, that there to be calmness, for that the\r\nMaid should be succoured. And alway, whilst this to be, I did run\r\nstaggering most strangely upward of the Last Road; and surely that great\r\nroof did ring and boom with the constant and mighty shoutings of the\r\nMillions.\r\n\r\nAnd there did run others also along the Road, to my back; but I to have\r\nbeen the first, and to make a good speed, though I did stagger and rock\r\nso strange upon my feet; and the Road alway to be moving backward under\r\nme; and so I to be come wonderful soon unto where the Maid did be. And\r\nshe to be upon her back, and to have pusht the Garment from her face,\r\nand did be lying with her eyes open, and a look of gentle wonderment\r\nupon her dear face. And she then to see me, and her eyes did smile at\r\nme, very glad and quiet; for there to be yet an utter weakness upon her.\r\n\r\nAnd lo! I came with a falling beside her, and I gat upon my knees and\r\nupon my hands, and my heart did shake my lips to dry whisperings. And\r\nshe to look weak and steadfast unto me, and I to look forever at her;\r\nand I did alway try to say things unto her; but my mouth to refuse me.\r\n\r\nAnd understanding did come into her, as a light; and she to know in that\r\ninstant that she to be truly come into the Mighty Pyramid, and I to have\r\ngat her there somewise; and she to wake sudden in her body, and set her\r\nhands forth all a-trembling from the Garment, and in dreadful trouble.\r\nAnd I to see then that the blood did go from me, constant; and the Maid\r\nto have perceived this thing, so that she was waked the more proper in a\r\nmoment from her death-swoon.\r\n\r\nAnd surely, I did bleed very dreadful; for all my wounds did be opened\r\nwith my running. And I to have sudden power with my lips, and did say\r\nunto her, very simple, that I loved her. And she to be all in an haze\r\nfrom me; and I to know that she to have come likewise unto her knees,\r\nand did have my head upon her breast; and there to be an utter shaking\r\nof the air with some great sound, and a mighty spiritual stirring of the\r\naether of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd there to be then the voice of the Master Monstruwacan very dull in\r\nmine ears; and the low voice of the Master Doctor; but I never to hear\r\nwhat they did be saying; and did know only that Mine Own Maid did live;\r\nand I not to mean to die, but to fight unto living. And even whilst that\r\nI made this resolving, I was gone into an utter blackness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE LOVE DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, when that I gat back unto life, I to know that I went upward in the\r\nLift, and did be upon that same bed, where I to think I never to need a\r\nbed any more, neither to come upward again from out of the Country of\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nAnd I to know vague and strange, that there rose up from out of the\r\nmighty depths of the world, the deep thunder of the Underground Organs,\r\nand did sound as that they made a strange and utter distant music beyond\r\ndeath; and there to go alway a rolling chaunting, as that multitudes did\r\nsing beyond far mountains, and the sound to be somewhiles as a\r\nfar-blowing wind, low in the Deep; and again to come clear, and to be\r\nthat great olden melody of the Song of Honour. And I knew, as in a\r\ndream, that the Millions in that deep Country made an Honour and a\r\nRejoicing over this Wonder of Joy which did be come. But yet all to be\r\nfaint and half hid from me, and mine eyes to be as that they had no\r\npower to open, and I to seem to be lifting alway upon strange waters of\r\nunrealness. And there to be sweet and lovely odours, and these to be of\r\nreality, and to come from the great Fields, where the flowers did alway\r\nto grow about the passage ways of the Lifts; for the Lift even then to\r\nbe going upward through the great miles.\r\n\r\nAnd mayhap I moved a little; for there came the voice of the Master\r\nDoctor low and gentle to me; and bid me rest; for that all did be well\r\nwith the Maid. And surely, afterward, I did be gone into an haze, and\r\nthere to be then a seeming of days in which I half to live and half to\r\nsleep, and to wonder without trouble whether I did be dead.\r\n\r\nAnd then there to come days when I lay very quiet, and had no thought of\r\naught; and the Master Doctor oft to bend over me in this hour and that\r\nhour, and to look keen into my face. And in the end, after strange\r\nspaces, there bent over me another, and there lookt down upon me the\r\ndear and lovely face of Mine Own, and the eyes did speak love into my\r\nsoul; yet did she be calm and husht. And I to begin again to live in my\r\nbody, and I made, mayhap, a little fumbling with my hands; for she to\r\ntake and to hold them; and life to come from her to me; and she to be\r\never wordless and gentle; and contentment to grow in me, and presently a\r\nnatural slumber.\r\n\r\nAnd there came a day when I did be let rise, and they that tended me,\r\ncarried me to one of the Quiet Gardens of the Pyramid; and they set me\r\nthere, and did seem to leave me alone. And there came One then around a\r\nbush, and lookt at me a moment, as with an half shyness; only that the\r\nlove that did shine in her eyes, made the shyness to be a little thing.\r\nAnd, truly, I knew that it did be Mine Own Maid; but I never before to\r\nhave seen Naani drest pretty as a maid. And I lookt to her, and knew\r\nthat she did be more dainty than even I to have known. And sudden I made\r\nthat I rise to come unto her; but she to run quick to me, that she stop\r\nme of this natural foolishness; and she then to sit beside me, and to\r\ntake my head against her breast, and she not to deny me her lips; but to\r\nbe both a maid and a mother to me in the same moment.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, she had me to be very still; and we to sit there in an\r\nutter dumb happiness, until they that did attend me, were come again.\r\nAnd the Master of the Doctors did be with them, and I to see that there\r\nwent something of satisfaction in his face.\r\n\r\nAnd after that day I saw Mine Own Maid every day; and I gat better unto\r\nhealth with a wondrous quickness; for Love did mend me. And soon I did\r\nbe let go downward unto the Fields; but yet to go by private ways,\r\nbecause that the Multitudes should be like to follow me alway; and I to\r\nneed to be quiet.\r\n\r\nAnd the Maid to be with me; for the Master Monstruwacan and the Master\r\nof the Doctors did agree upon this matter, and had an Officer of\r\nMarriage to wed us; and we to be married very quiet and simple; for I\r\nyet to be over-weak for the Public Marriage, which we to have later;\r\nwhen, truly, the Millions made us a Guard of Honour eight miles high,\r\nfrom the top unto the bottom of the Mighty Pyramid. But this to have\r\nbeen later, as I do tell, and did be a Ceremonial of the Peoples,\r\nbecause that they not to be denied that they give me an Honour.\r\n\r\nAnd surely the Maid to be with me alway, and did be now my wife, and my\r\nstrength to come alway upon me, and Mine Own to grow again unto a\r\nperfect health. And, in verity, we did be now in the Love Days which do\r\nbe the most beauteous, if that the Love to be True.\r\n\r\nAnd we did wander through the mighty Fields at our will, and walkt in\r\nthe Love Paths of the Fields, which did be alway anear to those places\r\nwhere did be the villages. And I to hide our name, lest we to be beset\r\nby any, out of natural curiousness and kindliness; for we to need to be\r\nutter together and quiet.\r\n\r\nAnd we to chose those places for our slumber where beauty of flowers did\r\nbe most wondrous; and we to carry somewhat of food with us; but also to\r\neat when we came unto the villages which did be here and there in the\r\nFields, which were truly so huge as Countries. And Mine Own did make\r\ngood her promise an hundred times, as you shall say, and did prepare me\r\na great and hearty meal; and did tease me utter that I did be a glutton,\r\nas I did eat, and kist me, lest that I have ever a chance to say aught\r\nin mine own defence. And truly, she did be all that my heart and my\r\nspirit did desire; and she to have companioned me with Love, and to have\r\nentered my spirit into Joy.\r\n\r\nAnd once we to go downward unto the Country of Silence; but not to stay\r\nvery long at that time; because that my Memory did return upon me. Yet\r\nin the after time, we to wander there oft with Memory, and Holiness of\r\ngreat Thinkings, and with Love which doth hold all.\r\n\r\nAnd as we to leave that Country, I to tell Mine Own how that when she\r\nhad been suspend of her life by the Horrid Force of the House, I to have\r\nminded me with a dreadful pain that I never to have waked to discover\r\nher kissing me when that I did sleep. And surely Mine Own Dear One did\r\nblush most lovely, and had never known that I did be aware of her sweet\r\nnaughtiness; and she then to have all thought for mine agony, when that\r\nshe did be dead, ere the Vapour of life of the Earth-Force did set her\r\nspirit free of the Silence.\r\n\r\nAnd she to come unto me in dear understanding.\r\n\r\nAnd she then to tell me that the Doctors to say that she had been, as it\r\nwere, stunned and froze of the Spirit, and all her Being and Life\r\nsuspend; and the great life-force of the Earth-Current to have waked her\r\nspirit, and her body then to live and her blood to flow proper again.\r\nAnd the Doctors had talkt much and searched much of late in the olden\r\nRecords of their Work; and they to have found somewhat of one such\r\nhappening in the olden time; but truly, naught such to have been ever\r\nthrough a mighty age of years.\r\n\r\nAnd whilst that we to wander and to rest in the Fields, I oft to tell\r\nMine Own of this matter and that matter; and I to know that she had\r\nlearned somewhat of odd things, ere I did be come to health; but not\r\novermuch; for she also to have been utter alack, as you shall think; and\r\nto have come from her bed, when that I did lie so still; for the Master\r\nDoctor to have ordained this, because he to fear that I to be going\r\ntruly to die, if that he not to do somewhat to awaken my spirit. And in\r\nverity, you shall think upon the deepness of my Love as I to know that\r\nshe did have held my hands so brave and gentle, whilst that she to have\r\nscarce power to her feet. And I to say a little holy praise of Mine Own.\r\n\r\nAnd so do I come to mine ending; and have but one more thing that I\r\ntell. And this to happen a while later; after that Mine Own and I had\r\ngone through the second marriage which did be the Public Marriage. For\r\nit did be, that one day My Wife, that did be Mine Own, did take me with\r\na sweet cunning unto the Hall of Honour. And surely, when I was come\r\nthere, I to see that many of the Peoples did be in that great Hall, and\r\ndid stand about in a silence; yet as that they had no meaning to do\r\naught; but yet to be that they did wait upon somewhat.\r\n\r\nAnd My Wife did go forward with me unto the centre place of the Hall;\r\nand sudden I saw why that she did bring me so cunning sweet; for there\r\ndid stand in the midst of the Hall of Honour, in the Place of Honour, a\r\nStatue of a man in broken armour, that did carry a maid forever.\r\n\r\nAnd I did be dumb; and how of this Age shall you to know the Honour that\r\nthis to mean in that; for it did be an Honour that was given only to the\r\nGreat Dead; and I to be but a young man, and did be so utter far off\r\nfrom greatness; save that I to love with all my heart and with all my\r\nspirit, and therefore death to be but a little thing before love. And\r\nyou to know how Love doth make sweet and brave the heart; and to have\r\nunderstanding with me in my humbleness and my wonder and my natural\r\npride that there did any so think to honour me.\r\n\r\nAnd Mine Own did be weeping with joy and honest pride of her man, beside\r\nme. And there to be an utter silence of dear sympathy in all the great\r\nHall of Honour. And they that did be there, to let me go in quietness,\r\nwith Mine Own, which did be a lovely thing of understanding.\r\n\r\nAnd I to go loving and thoughtful with Mine Own Wife; and she to be very\r\nnigh to me.\r\n\r\nAnd I to have gained Honour; yet to have learned that Honour doth be but\r\nas the ash of Life, if that you not to have Love. And I to have Love.\r\nAnd to have Love is to have all; for that which doth be _truly_ LOVE\r\ndoth mother Honour and Faithfulness; and they three to build the House\r\nof Joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Night Land, by William Hope Hodgson\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE NIGHT LAND ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 10662.txt or 10662.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/6/6/10662/\r\n\r\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Maria Khomenko and PG Distributed Proofreaders\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n\r\n'
