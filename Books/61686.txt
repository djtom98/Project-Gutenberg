He had literally to fight\r\nhis way free of it. From So Big (of fond and infantile derivation) it\r\nhad been condensed into Sobig. And Sobig DeJong, in all its consonantal\r\ndisharmony, he had remained until he was a ten-year-old schoolboy in\r\nthat incredibly Dutch district southwest of Chicago known first as New\r\nHolland and later as High Prairie. At ten, by dint of fists, teeth,\r\ncopper-toed boots, and temper, he earned the right to be called by his\r\nreal name, Dirk DeJong. Now and then, of course, the nickname bobbed up\r\nand had to be subdued in a brief and bitter skirmish. His mother, with\r\nwhom the name had originated, was the worst offender. When she lapsed he\r\ndid not, naturally, use schoolyard tactics on her. But he sulked and\r\nglowered portentously and refused to answer, though her tone, when she\r\ncalled him So Big, would have melted the heart of any but that natural\r\nsavage, a boy of ten.\r\n\r\nThe nickname had sprung from the early and idiotic question invariably\r\nput to babies and answered by them, with infinite patience, through the\r\nyears of their infancy.\r\n\r\nSelina DeJong, darting expertly about her kitchen, from washtub to\r\nbaking board, from stove to table, or, if at work in the fields of the\r\ntruck farm, straightening the numbed back for a moment\xe2\x80\x99s respite from\r\nthe close-set rows of carrots, turnips, spinach, or beets over which she\r\nwas labouring, would wipe the sweat beads from nose and forehead with a\r\nquick duck of her head in the crook of her bent arm. Those great fine\r\ndark eyes of hers would regard the child perched impermanently on a\r\nlittle heap of empty potato sacks, one of which comprised his costume.\r\nHe was constantly detaching himself from the parent sack heap to dig and\r\nburrow in the rich warm black loam of the truck garden. Selina DeJong\r\nhad little time for the expression of affection. The work was always hot\r\nat her heels. You saw a young woman in a blue calico dress, faded and\r\nearth-grimed. Between her eyes was a driven look as of one who walks\r\nalways a little ahead of herself in her haste. Her dark abundant hair\r\nwas skewered into a utilitarian knob from which soft loops and strands\r\nwere constantly escaping, to be pushed back by that same harried ducking\r\ngesture of head and bent arm. Her hands, for such use, were usually too\r\ncrusted and inground with the soil into which she was delving. You saw a\r\nchild of perhaps two years, dirt-streaked, sunburned, and generally\r\notherwise defaced by those bumps, bites, scratches, and contusions that\r\nare the common lot of the farm child of a mother harried by work. Yet,\r\nin that moment, as the woman looked at the child there in the warm moist\r\nspring of the Illinois prairie land, or in the cluttered kitchen of the\r\nfarmhouse, there quivered and vibrated between them and all about them\r\nan aura, a glow, that imparted to them and their surroundings a mystery,\r\na beauty, a radiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow big is baby?\xe2\x80\x9d Selina would demand, senselessly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow big is my\r\nman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child would momentarily cease to poke plump fingers into the rich\r\nblack loam. He would smile a gummy though slightly weary smile and\r\nstretch wide his arms. She, too, would open her tired arms wide, wide.\r\nThen they would say in a duet, his mouth a puckered pink petal, hers\r\nquivering with tenderness and a certain amusement, \xe2\x80\x9c_So-o-o-o_ big!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith the voice soaring on the prolonged vowel and dropping suddenly with\r\nthe second word. Part of the game. The child became so habituated to\r\nthis question that sometimes, if Selina happened to glance round at him\r\nsuddenly in the midst of her task, he would take his cue without the\r\nfamiliar question being put and would squeal his \xe2\x80\x9c_So-o-o-o_ big!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrather absently, in dutiful solo. Then he would throw back his head and\r\nlaugh a triumphant laugh, his open mouth a coral orifice. She would run\r\nto him, and swoop down upon him, and bury her flushed face in the warm\r\nmoist creases of his neck, and make as though to devour him. \xe2\x80\x9cSo big!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut of course he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as big as that. In fact, he never\r\nbecame as big as the wide-stretched arms of her love and imagination\r\nwould have had him. You would have thought she should have been\r\nsatisfied when, in later years, he was the Dirk DeJong whose name you\r\nsaw (engraved) at the top of heavy cream linen paper, so rich and thick\r\nand stiff as to have the effect of being starched and ironed by some\r\ncostly American business process; whose clothes were made by Peter Peel,\r\nthe English tailor; whose roadster ran on a French chassis; whose\r\ncabinet held mellow Italian vermouth and Spanish sherry; whose wants\r\nwere served by a Japanese houseman; whose life, in short, was that of\r\nthe successful citizen of the Republic. But she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Not only was she\r\ndissatisfied: she was at once remorseful and indignant, as though she,\r\nSelina DeJong, the vegetable pedler, had been partly to blame for this\r\nsuccess of his, and partly cheated by it.\r\n\r\nWhen Selina DeJong had been Selina Peake she had lived in Chicago with\r\nher father. They had lived in many other cities as well. In Denver\r\nduring the rampant \xe2\x80\x9980s. In New York when Selina was twelve. In\r\nMilwaukee briefly. There was even a San Francisco interlude which was\r\nalways a little sketchy in Selina\xe2\x80\x99s mind and which had ended in a\r\ndeparture so hurried as to bewilder even Selina who had learned to\r\naccept sudden comings and abrupt goings without question. \xe2\x80\x9cBusiness,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nher father always said. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle deal.\xe2\x80\x9d She never knew until the day of\r\nhis death how literally the word deal was applicable to his business\r\ntransactions. Simeon Peake, travelling the country with his little\r\ndaughter, was a gambler by profession, temperament, and natural talents.\r\nWhen in luck they lived royally, stopping at the best hotels, eating\r\nstrange, succulent sea-viands, going to the play, driving in hired rigs\r\n(always with two horses. If Simeon Peake had not enough money for a\r\ntwo-horse equipage he walked). When fortune hid her face they lived in\r\nboarding houses, ate boarding-house meals, wore the clothes bought when\r\nFortune\xe2\x80\x99s breath was balmy. During all this time Selina attended\r\nschools, good, bad, private, public, with surprising regularity\r\nconsidering her nomadic existence. Deep-bosomed matrons, seeing this\r\ndark-eyed serious child seated alone in a hotel lobby or boarding-house\r\nparlour, would bend over her in solicitous questioning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your mamma, little girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina would reply, politely and composedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my poor little dear!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, with a warm rush, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to\r\ncome and play with my little girl? She loves little girls to play with.\r\nH\xe2\x80\x99m?\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cm\xe2\x80\x9d of the interrogation held hummingly, tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you very much. I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting for my father. He would be\r\ndisappointed not to find me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese good ladies wasted their sympathy. Selina had a beautiful time.\r\nExcept for three years, to recall which was to her like entering a\r\nsombre icy room on leaving a warm and glowing one, her life was free,\r\ninteresting, varied. She made decisions usually devolving upon the adult\r\nmind. She selected clothes. She ruled her father. She read absorbedly\r\nbooks found in boarding-house parlours, in hotels, in such public\r\nlibraries as the times afforded. She was alone for hours a day, daily.\r\nFrequently her father, fearful of loneliness for her, brought her an\r\narmful of books and she had an orgy, dipping and swooping about among\r\nthem in a sort of gourmand\xe2\x80\x99s ecstasy of indecision. In this way, at\r\nfifteen, she knew the writings of Byron, Jane Austen, Dickens, Charlotte\r\nBront\xc3\xab, Felicia Hemans. Not to speak of Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth,\r\nBertha M. Clay, and that good fairy of the scullery, the _Fireside\r\nCompanion_, in whose pages factory girls and dukes were brought together\r\nas inevitably as steak and onions. These last were, of course, the\r\nresult of Selina\xe2\x80\x99s mode of living, and were loaned her by kind-hearted\r\nlandladies, chambermaids, and waitresses all the way from California to\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nHer three dark years\xe2\x80\x94from nine to twelve\xe2\x80\x94were spent with her two\r\nmaiden aunts, the Misses Sarah and Abbie Peake, in the dim, prim Vermont\r\nPeake house from which her father, the black sheep, had run away when a\r\nboy. After her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death Simeon Peake had sent his little daughter\r\nback east in a fit of remorse and temporary helplessness on his part and\r\na spurt of forgiveness and churchly charity on the part of his two\r\nsisters. The two women were incredibly drawn in the pattern of the New\r\nEngland spinster of fiction. Mitts, preserves, Bible, chilly best room,\r\nsolemn and kittenless cat, order, little-girls-mustn\xe2\x80\x99t. They smelled of\r\napples\xe2\x80\x94of withered apples that have rotted at the core. Selina had once\r\nfound such an apple in a corner of a disorderly school-desk, had sniffed\r\nit, regarded its wrinkled, sapless pink cheek, and had bitten into it\r\nadventuresomely, only to spit out the mouthful in an explosive and\r\nunladylike spray. It had been all black and mouldy at its heart.\r\n\r\nSomething of this she must have conveyed, in her desperation, to her\r\nfather in an uncensored letter. Without warning he had come for her, and\r\nat sight of him she had been guilty of the only fit of hysteria that\r\nmarked her life, before or after the episode.\r\n\r\nSo, then, from twelve to nineteen she was happy. They had come to\r\nChicago in 1885, when she was sixteen. There they remained. Selina\r\nattended Miss Fister\xe2\x80\x99s Select School for Young Ladies. When her father\r\nbrought her there he had raised quite a flutter in the Fister breast\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nsoft-spoken was he, so gentle, so sad-appearing, so winning as to smile.\r\nIn the investment business, he explained. Stocks and that kind of thing.\r\nA widower. Miss Fister said, yes, she understood.\r\n\r\nSimeon Peake had had nothing of the look of the professional gambler of\r\nthe day. The wide slouch hat, the flowing mustache, the glittering eye,\r\nthe too-bright boots, the gay cravat, all were missing in Simeon Peake\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmakeup. True, he did sport a singularly clear white diamond pin in his\r\nshirt front; and his hat he wore just a little on one side. But then,\r\nthese both were in the male mode and quite commonly seen. For the rest\r\nhe seemed a mild and suave man, slim, a trifle diffident, speaking\r\nseldom and then with a New England drawl by which he had come honestly\r\nenough, Vermont Peake that he was.\r\n\r\nChicago was his meat. It was booming, prosperous. Jeff Hankins\xe2\x80\x99s red\r\nplush and mirrored gambling house, and Mike McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s, too, both on\r\nClark Street, knew him daily. He played in good luck and bad, but he\r\nmanaged somehow to see to it that there was always the money to pay for\r\nthe Fister schooling. His was the ideal poker face\xe2\x80\x94bland, emotionless,\r\nimmobile. When he was flush they ate at the Palmer House, dining off\r\nchicken or quail and thick rich soup and the apple pie for which the\r\nhostelry was famous. Waiters hovered solicitously about Simeon Peake,\r\nthough he rarely addressed them and never looked at them. Selina was\r\nhappy. She knew only such young people\xe2\x80\x94girls\xe2\x80\x94as she met at Miss\r\nFister\xe2\x80\x99s school. Of men, other than her father, she knew as little as a\r\nnun\xe2\x80\x94less. For those cloistered creatures must, if only in the conning\r\nof their Bible, learn much of the moods and passions that sway the male.\r\nThe Songs of Solomon alone are a glorious sex education. But the Bible\r\nwas not included in Selina\xe2\x80\x99s haphazard reading, and the Gideonite was\r\nnot then a force in the hotel world.\r\n\r\nHer chum was Julie Hempel, daughter of August Hempel, the Clark Street\r\nbutcher. You probably now own some Hempel stock, if you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky; and\r\neat Hempel bacon and Hempel hams cured in the hickory, for in Chicago\r\nthe distance from butcher of 1885 to packer of 1890 was only a five-year\r\nleap.\r\n\r\nBeing so much alone developed in her a gift for the make-believe. In a\r\ncomfortable, well-dressed way she was a sort of mixture of Dick\r\nSwiveller\xe2\x80\x99s Marchioness and Sarah Crewe. Even in her childhood she\r\nextracted from life the double enjoyment that comes usually only to the\r\ncreative mind. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m doing that,\xe2\x80\x9d she told\r\nherself while she was doing it. Looking on while she participated.\r\nPerhaps her theatre-going had something to do with this. At an age when\r\nmost little girls were not only unheard but practically unseen, she\r\noccupied a grown-up seat at the play, her rapt face, with its dark\r\nserious eyes, glowing in a sort of luminous pallor as she sat proudly\r\nnext her father. Simeon Peake had the gambler\xe2\x80\x99s love of the theatre,\r\nhimself possessing the dramatic quality necessary to the successful\r\nfollowing of his profession.\r\n\r\nIn this way Selina, half-hidden in the depths of an orchestra seat,\r\nwriggled in ecstatic anticipation when the curtain ascended on the\r\ngrotesque rows of Haverly\xe2\x80\x99s minstrels. She wept (as did Simeon) over the\r\nagonies of The Two Orphans when Kitty Blanchard and McKee Rankin came to\r\nChicago with the Union Square Stock Company. She witnessed that\r\nstartling innovation, a Jewish play, called Samuel of Posen. She saw\r\nFanny Davenport in Pique. Simeon even took her to a performance of that\r\nshocking and delightful form of new entertainment, the Extravaganza. She\r\nthought the plump creature in tights and spangles, descending the long\r\nstairway, the most beautiful being she had ever seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing I like about plays and books is that anything can happen.\r\nAnything! You never know,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said, after one of these evenings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo different from life,\xe2\x80\x9d Simeon Peake assured her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea the\r\nthings that happen to you if you just relax and take them as they come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, Simeon Peake said this, not through ignorance, but\r\ndeliberately and with reason. In his way and day he was a very modern\r\nfather. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to see all kinds,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you\r\nto realize that this whole thing is just a grand adventure. A fine show.\r\nThe trick is to play in it and look at it at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat whole thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiving. All mixed up. The more kinds of people you see, and the more\r\nthings you do, and the more things that happen to you, the richer you\r\nare. Even if they\xe2\x80\x99re not pleasant things. That\xe2\x80\x99s living. Remember, no\r\nmatter what happens, good or bad, it\xe2\x80\x99s just so much\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he used the\r\ngambler\xe2\x80\x99s term, unconsciously\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cjust so much velvet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Selina, somehow, understood. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that anything\xe2\x80\x99s better than\r\nbeing Aunt Sarah and Aunt Abbie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94yes. There are only two kinds of people in the world that really\r\ncount. One kind\xe2\x80\x99s wheat and the other kind\xe2\x80\x99s emeralds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny Davenport\xe2\x80\x99s an emerald,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, quickly, and rather\r\nsurprised to find herself saying it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. That\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94and Julie Hempel\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s wheat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy golly, Sele!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Simeon Peake. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a shrewd little tyke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was after reading \xe2\x80\x9cPride and Prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d that she decided to be the\r\nJane Austen of her time. She became very mysterious and enjoyed a brief\r\nperiod of unpopularity at Miss Fister\xe2\x80\x99s owing to her veiled allusions to\r\nher \xe2\x80\x9cwork\xe2\x80\x9d; and an annoying way of smiling to herself and tapping a\r\nruminative toe as though engaged in visions far too exquisite for the\r\ncommon eye. Her chum Julie Hempel, properly enough, became enraged at\r\nthis and gave Selina to understand that she must make her choice between\r\nrevealing her secret or being cast out of the Hempel heart. Selina swore\r\nher to secrecy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be a novelist.\xe2\x80\x9d Julie\r\nwas palpably disappointed, though she said, \xe2\x80\x9cSelina!\xe2\x80\x9d as though properly\r\nimpressed, but followed it up with: \xe2\x80\x9cStill, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you had to\r\nbe so mysterious about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, Julie. Writers have to study life at first\r\nhand. And if people know you\xe2\x80\x99re studying them they don\xe2\x80\x99t act natural.\r\nNow, that day you were telling me about the young man in your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop who looked at you and said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSelina Peake, if you dare to put that in your book I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nspeak\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I won\xe2\x80\x99t. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean. You see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulie Hempel and Selina Peake, both finished products of Miss Fister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nschool, were of an age\xe2\x80\x94nineteen. Selina, on this September day, had\r\nbeen spending the afternoon with Julie, and now, adjusting her hat\r\npreparatory to leaving, she clapped her hands over her ears to shut out\r\nthe sounds of Julie\xe2\x80\x99s importunings that she stay to supper. Certainly\r\nthe prospect of the usual Monday evening meal in Mrs. Tebbitt\xe2\x80\x99s boarding\r\nhouse (the Peake luck was momentarily low) did not present sufficient\r\nexcuse for Selina\xe2\x80\x99s refusal. Indeed, the Hempel supper as sketched dish\r\nfor dish by the urgent Julie brought little greedy groans from Selina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s prairie chickens\xe2\x80\x94three of them\xe2\x80\x94that a farmer west of town\r\nbrought Father. Mother fixes them with stuffing, and there\xe2\x80\x99s currant\r\njell. Creamed onions and baked tomatoes. And for dessert, apple roll.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina snapped the elastic holding her high-crowned hat under her\r\nchignon of hair in the back. She uttered a final and quavering groan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Monday nights we have cold mutton and cabbage at Mrs. Tebbitt\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nThis is Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, silly, why not stay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather comes home at six. If I\xe2\x80\x99m not there he\xe2\x80\x99s disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulie, plump, blonde, placid, forsook her soft white blandishments and\r\ntried steel against the steel of Selina\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe leaves you right after supper. And you\xe2\x80\x99re alone every night until\r\ntwelve and after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see what that has to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said, stiffly.\r\n\r\nJulie\xe2\x80\x99s steel, being low-grade, melted at once and ran off her in\r\nrivulets. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, Selie dear. Only I thought you might\r\nleave him just this once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m not there he\xe2\x80\x99s disappointed. And that terrible Mrs. Tebbitt\r\nmakes eyes at him. He hates it there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you stay. I never could see. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been there\r\nfour months now, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s horrid and stuffy; and oilcloth on the\r\nstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather has had some temporary business setbacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s costume testified to that. True, it was modish, and bustled,\r\nand basqued, and flounced; and her high-crowned, short-rimmed hat, with\r\nits trimming of feathers and flowers and ribbons had come from New York.\r\nBut both were of last spring\xe2\x80\x99s purchasing, and this was September.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the afternoon they had been looking over the pages of\r\nGodey\xe2\x80\x99s _Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Book_ for that month. The disparity between Selina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncostume and the creations pictured there was much as the difference\r\nbetween the Tebbitt meal and that outlined by Julie. Now Julie, fond\r\nthough defeated, kissed her friend good-bye.\r\n\r\nSelina walked quickly the short distance from the Hempel house to\r\nTebbitt\xe2\x80\x99s, on Dearborn Avenue. Up in her second-floor room she took off\r\nher hat and called to her father, but he had not yet come in. She was\r\nglad of that. She had been fearful of being late. She regarded her hat\r\nnow with some distaste, decided to rip off the faded spring roses, did\r\nrip a stitch or two, only to discover that the hat material was more\r\nfaded than the roses, and that the uncovered surface showed up a dark\r\nsplotch like a wall-spot when a picture, long hung, is removed. So she\r\ngot a needle and prepared to tack the offending rose in its accustomed\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nPerched on the arm of a chair near the window, taking quick deft\r\nstitches, she heard a sound. She had never heard that sound before\xe2\x80\x94that\r\npeculiar sound\xe2\x80\x94the slow, ominous tread of men laden with a heavy inert\r\nburden; bearing with infinite care that which was well beyond hurting.\r\nSelina had never heard that sound before, and yet, hearing it, she\r\nrecognized it by one of those pangs, centuries old, called woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstinct. Thud\xe2\x80\x94shuffle\xe2\x80\x94thud\xe2\x80\x94shuffle\xe2\x80\x94up the narrow stairway, along\r\nthe passage. She stood up, the needle poised in her hand. The hat fell\r\nto the floor. Her eyes were wide, fixed. Her lips slightly parted. The\r\nlistening look. She knew.\r\n\r\nShe knew even before she heard the hoarse man\xe2\x80\x99s voice saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLift \xe2\x80\x99er\r\nup there a little on the corner, now. Easy\xe2\x80\x94e-e-easy.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mrs.\r\nTebbitt\xe2\x80\x99s high shrill clamour: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t bring it in there! You hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nought to bring it in here like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s suspended breath came back. She was panting now. She had flung\r\nopen the door. A flat still burden partially covered with an overcoat\r\ncarelessly flung over the face. The feet, in their square-toed boots,\r\nwobbled listlessly. Selina noticed how shiny the boots were. He was\r\nalways very finicking about such things.\r\n\r\nSimeon Peake had been shot in Jeff Hankins\xe2\x80\x99s place at five in the\r\nafternoon. The irony of it was that the bullet had not been intended for\r\nhim at all. Its derelict course had been due to feminine aim. Sped by\r\none of those over-dramatic ladies who, armed with horsewhip or pistol in\r\ntardy defence of their honour, spangled Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s dull \xe2\x80\x9980s with their\r\ndoings, it had been meant for a well-known newspaper publisher usually\r\nmentioned (in papers other than his own) as a bon vivant. The lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleaden remonstrance was to have been proof of the fact that he had been\r\nmore vivacious than bon.\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, because of this that the matter was pretty well hushed\r\nup. The publisher\xe2\x80\x99s paper\xe2\x80\x94which was Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s foremost\xe2\x80\x94scarcely\r\nmentioned the incident and purposely misspelled the name. The lady,\r\nthinking her task accomplished, had taken truer aim with her second\r\nbullet, and had saved herself the trouble of trial by human jury.\r\n\r\nSimeon Peake left his daughter Selina a legacy of two fine clear\r\nblue-white diamonds (he had had the gambler\xe2\x80\x99s love of them) and the sum\r\nof four hundred and ninety-seven dollars in cash. Just how he had\r\nmanaged to have a sum like this put by was a mystery. The envelope\r\ncontaining it had evidently once held a larger sum. It had been sealed,\r\nand then slit. On the outside was written, in Simeon Peake\xe2\x80\x99s fine,\r\nalmost feminine hand: \xe2\x80\x9cFor my little daughter Selina Peake in case\r\nanything should happen to me.\xe2\x80\x9d It bore a date seven years old. What the\r\noriginal sum had been no one ever knew. That any sum remained was\r\nevidence of the almost heroic self-control practised by one to whom\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94ready money in any sum at all\xe2\x80\x94meant only fuel to feed the flames\r\nof his gaming fever.\r\n\r\nTo Selina fell the choice of earning her own living or of returning to\r\nthe Vermont village and becoming a withered and sapless dried apple,\r\nwith black fuzz and mould at her heart, like her aunts, the Misses Sarah\r\nand Abbie Peake. She did not hesitate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what kind of work?\xe2\x80\x9d Julie Hempel demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of work can\r\nyou do?\xe2\x80\x9d Women\xe2\x80\x94that is, the Selina Peakes\xe2\x80\x94did not work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94well, I can teach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeach what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe things I learned at Miss Fister\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulie\xe2\x80\x99s expression weighed and discredited Miss Fister. \xe2\x80\x9cWho to?\xe2\x80\x9d Which\r\ncertainly justified her expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo children. People\xe2\x80\x99s children. Or in the public schools.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to do something first\xe2\x80\x94go to Normal, or teach in the country,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x94before you can teach in the public schools. They\xe2\x80\x99re mostly\r\nold. Twenty-five or even thirty\xe2\x80\x94or more!\xe2\x80\x9d with nineteen\xe2\x80\x99s incapacity to\r\nimagine an age beyond thirty.\r\n\r\nThat Julie was taking the offensive in this conversation, and Selina the\r\ndefensive, was indicative of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s numbed state. Selina did not\r\nthen know the iron qualities her friend was displaying in being with her\r\nat all. Mrs. Hempel had quite properly forbidden Julie ever to see the\r\ndead dissolute gambler\xe2\x80\x99s daughter again. She had even sent a note to\r\nMiss Fister expressing her opinion of a school which would, by admitting\r\nsuch unselected ladies to its select circle, expose other pupils to\r\ncontamination.\r\n\r\nSelina rallied to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll just teach a country\r\nschool. I\xe2\x80\x99m good at arithmetic. You know that.\xe2\x80\x9d Julie should have known\r\nit, having had all her Fister sums solved by Selina. \xe2\x80\x9cCountry schools\r\nare just arithmetic and grammar and geography.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! Teaching a country school!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at Selina.\r\n\r\nShe saw a misleadingly delicate face, the skull small and exquisitely\r\nformed. The cheek bones rather high\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps they looked so because\r\nof the fact that the eyes, dark, soft, and luminous, were unusually\r\ndeep-set in their sockets. The face, instead of narrowing to a soft\r\ncurve at the chin, developed unexpected strength in the jaw line. That\r\nline, fine, steel-strong, sharp and clear, was of the stuff of which\r\npioneer women are made. Julie, inexperienced in the art of reading the\r\nhuman physiognomy, did not decipher the meaning of it. Selina\xe2\x80\x99s hair was\r\nthick, long, and fine, so that she piled it easily in the loops, coils,\r\nand knots that fashion demanded. Her nose, slightly pinched at the\r\nnostrils, was exquisite. When she laughed it had the trick of wrinkling\r\njust a little across the narrow bridge; very engaging, and mischievous.\r\nShe was thought a rather plain little thing, which she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. But the\r\neyes were what you marked and remembered. People to whom she was\r\nspeaking had a way of looking into them deeply. Selina was often\r\nembarrassed to discover that they were not hearing what she had to say.\r\nPerhaps it was this velvety softness of the eyes that caused one to\r\noverlook the firmness of the lower face. When the next ten years had\r\ndone their worst to her, and Julie had suddenly come upon her stepping\r\nagilely out of a truck gardener\xe2\x80\x99s wagon on Prairie Avenue, a tanned,\r\nweather-beaten, toil-worn woman, her abundant hair skewered into a knob\r\nand held by a long gray hairpin, her full calico skirt grimed with the\r\nmud of the wagon wheel, a pair of men\xe2\x80\x99s old side-boots on her slim feet,\r\na grotesquely battered old felt hat (her husband\xe2\x80\x99s) on her head, her\r\narms full of ears of sweet corn, and carrots, and radishes, and bunches\r\nof beets; a woman with bad teeth, flat breasts, a sagging pocket in her\r\ncapacious skirt\xe2\x80\x94even then Julie, staring, had known her by her eyes.\r\nAnd she had run to her in her silk suit and her fine silk shirtwaist and\r\nher hat with the plume and had cried, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Selina! My dear! My\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with a sob of horror and pity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear.\xe2\x80\x9d And had taken Selina,\r\ncarrots, beets, corn, and radishes, in her arms. The vegetables lay\r\nscattered all about them on the sidewalk in front of Julie Hempel\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s great stone house on Prairie Avenue. But strangely enough it\r\nhad been Selina who had done the comforting, patting Julie\xe2\x80\x99s silken\r\nshoulder and saying, over and over, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, there! It\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\r\nJulie. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry. What\xe2\x80\x99s there to cry for! Sh! . . .\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n\r\nSelina had thought herself lucky to get the Dutch school at High\r\nPrairie, ten miles outside Chicago. Thirty dollars a month! She was to\r\nboard at the house of Klaas Pool, the truck farmer. It was August Hempel\r\nwho had brought it all about; or Julie, urging him. Now, at forty-five,\r\nAugust Hempel, the Clark Street butcher, knew every farmer and stockman\r\nfor miles around, and hundreds besides scattered throughout Cook County\r\nand the State of Illinois.\r\n\r\nTo get the Dutch school for Selina Peake was a simple enough matter for\r\nhim. The High Prairie district school teacher had always, heretofore,\r\nbeen a man. A more advantageous position presenting itself, this year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprospective teacher had withdrawn before the school term had begun. This\r\nwas in September. High Prairie school did not open until the first week\r\nin November. In that region of truck farms every boy and girl over six\r\nwas busy in the fields throughout the early autumn. Two years of this,\r\nand Selina would be qualified for a city grade. August Hempel indicated\r\nthat he could arrange that, too, when the time came. Selina thought this\r\nshrewd red-faced butcher a wonderful man, indeed. Which he was.\r\n\r\nAt forty-seven, single-handed, he was to establish the famous Hempel\r\nPacking Company. At fifty he was the power in the yards, and there were\r\nHempel branches in Kansas City, Omaha, Denver. At sixty you saw the name\r\nof Hempel plastered over packing sheds, factories, and canning plants\r\nall the way from Honolulu to Portland. You read:\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t Say Ham: Say Hempel\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHempel products ranged incredibly from pork to pineapple; from grease to\r\ngrape-juice. An indictment meant no more to Hempel, the packer, than an\r\ninjunction for speeding to you. Something of his character may be\r\ngleaned from the fact that farmers who had known the butcher at forty\r\nstill addressed this millionaire, at sixty, as Aug. At sixty-five he\r\ntook up golf and beat his son-in-law, Michael Arnold, at it. A\r\nmagnificent old pirate, sailing the perilous commercial seas of the\r\nAmerican \xe2\x80\x9990s before commissions, investigations, and inquisitive senate\r\ninsisted on applying whitewash to the black flag of trade.\r\n\r\nSelina went about her preparations in a singularly clear-headed fashion,\r\nconsidering her youth and inexperience. She sold one of the blue-white\r\ndiamonds, and kept one. She placed her inheritance of four hundred and\r\nninety-seven dollars, complete, in the bank. She bought stout sensible\r\nboots, two dresses, one a brown lady\xe2\x80\x99s-cloth which she made herself,\r\nfinished with white collars and cuffs, very neat (the cuffs to be\r\nprotected by black sateen sleevelets, of course, while teaching); and a\r\nwine-red cashmere (mad, but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist it) for best.\r\n\r\nShe eagerly learned what she could of this region once known as New\r\nHolland. Its people were all truck gardeners, and as Dutch as the\r\nNetherlands from which they or their fathers had come. She heard stories\r\nof wooden shoes worn in the wet prairie fields; of a red-faced plodding\r\nCornelius Van der Bilt living in placid ignorance of the existence of\r\nhis distinguished New York patronymic connection; of sturdy, phlegmatic,\r\nindustrious farmers in squat, many-windowed houses patterned after the\r\nnorth Holland houses of their European memories. Many of them had come\r\nfrom the town of Schoorl, or near it. Others from the lowlands outside\r\nAmsterdam. Selina pictured it another Sleepy Hollow, a replica of the\r\nquaint settlement in Washington Irving\xe2\x80\x99s delightful tale. The deserting\r\nschoolmaster had been a second Ichabod Crane, naturally; the farmer at\r\nwhose house she was to live a modern Mynheer Van Tassel, pipe, chuckle,\r\nand all. She and Julie Hempel read the tale over together on an\r\nafternoon when Julie managed to evade the maternal edict. Selina,\r\npicturing mellow golden corn fields; crusty crullers, crumbling\r\noly-koeks, toothsome wild ducks, sides of smoked beef, pumpkin pies;\r\ncountry dances, apple-cheeked farmer girls, felt sorry for poor Julie\r\nstaying on in the dull gray commonplaceness of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe last week in October found her on the way to High Prairie, seated\r\nbeside Klaas Pool in the two-horse wagon with which he brought his\r\ngarden stuff to the Chicago market. She sat perched next him on the high\r\nseat like a saucy wren beside a ruminant Holstein. So they jolted up the\r\nlong Halsted road through the late October sunset. The prairie land just\r\noutside Chicago had not then been made a terrifying and epic thing of\r\nslag-heaps, smoke-stacks, and blast furnaces like a Pennell drawing.\r\nTo-day it stretched away and away in the last rays of the late autumn\r\nsunlight over which the lake mist was beginning to creep like chiffon\r\ncovering gold. Mile after mile of cabbage fields, jade-green against the\r\nearth. Mile after mile of red cabbage, a rich plummy Burgundy veined\r\nwith black. Between these, heaps of corn were piled-up sunshine. Against\r\nthe horizon an occasional patch of woods showed the last russet and\r\nbronze of oak and maple. These things Selina saw with her beauty-loving\r\neye, and she clasped her hands in their black cotton gloves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Pool!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pool! How beautiful it is here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKlaas Pool, driving his team of horses down the muddy Halsted road, was\r\nlooking straight ahead, his eyes fastened seemingly on an invisible spot\r\nbetween the off-horse\xe2\x80\x99s ears. His was not the kind of brain that acts\r\nquickly, nor was his body\xe2\x80\x99s mechanism the sort that quickly responds to\r\nthat brain\xe2\x80\x99s message. His eyes were china-blue in a round red face that\r\nwas covered with a stubble of stiff golden hairs. His round moon of a\r\nhead was set low and solidly between his great shoulders, so that as he\r\nbegan to turn it now, slowly, you marvelled at the process and waited\r\nfearfully to hear a creak. He was turning his head toward Selina, but\r\nkeeping his gaze on the spot between his horse\xe2\x80\x99s ears. Evidently the\r\nhead and the eyes revolved by quite distinct processes. Now he faced\r\nSelina almost directly. Then he brought his eyes around, slowly, until\r\nthey focussed on her cameo-like face all alight now with her enjoyment\r\nof the scene around her; with a certain elation at this new venture into\r\nwhich she was entering; and with excitement such as she used to feel\r\nwhen the curtain rose with tantalizing deliberateness on the first act\r\nof a play which she was seeing with her father. She was well bundled up\r\nagainst the sharp October air in her cloak and muffler, with a shawl\r\ntucked about her knees and waist. The usual creamy pallor of her fine\r\nclear skin showed an unwonted pink, and her eyes were wide, dark, and\r\nbright. Beside this sparkling delicate girl\xe2\x80\x99s face Klaas Pool\xe2\x80\x99s heavy\r\nfeatures seemed carved from the stuff of another clay and race. His pale\r\nblue eyes showed incomprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed, in puzzled interrogation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s slim arms flashed out from the swathings of cloak, shawl, and\r\nmuffler and were flung wide in a gesture that embraced the landscape on\r\nwhich the late afternoon sun was casting a glow peculiar to that lake\r\nregion, all rose and golden and mist-shimmering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis! The\xe2\x80\x94the cabbages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slow-dawning film of fun crept over the blue of Klaas Pool\xe2\x80\x99s stare.\r\nThis film spread almost imperceptibly so that it fluted his broad\r\nnostrils, met and widened his full lips, reached and agitated his\r\nmassive shoulders, tickled the round belly, so that all Klaas Pool, from\r\nhis eyes to his waist, was rippling and shaking with slow, solemn, heavy\r\nDutch mirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCabbages is beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d his round pop eyes staring at her in a fixity\r\nof glee. \xe2\x80\x9cCabbages is beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d His silent laughter now rose and\r\nbecame audible in a rich throaty chortle. It was plain that laughter,\r\nwith Klaas Pool, was not a thing to be lightly dismissed, once raised.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCabbages\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he choked a little, and spluttered, overcome. Now he\r\nbegan to shift his gaze back to his horses and the road, by the same\r\nprocess of turning his head first and then his eyes, so that to Selina\r\nthe mirthful tail of his right eye and his round red cheek with the\r\ngolden fuzz on it gave him an incredibly roguish brownie look.\r\n\r\nSelina laughed, too, even while she protested his laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they\r\nare!\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cThey _are_ beautiful. Like jade and Burgundy. No,\r\nlike\xe2\x80\x94uh\xe2\x80\x94like\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s that in\xe2\x80\x94like chrysoprase and porphyry. All those\r\nfields of cabbages and the corn and the beet-tops together look like\r\nPersian patches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhich was, certainly, no way for a new school teacher to talk to a\r\nHolland truck gardener driving his team along the dirt road on his way\r\nto High Prairie. But then, Selina, remember, had read Byron at\r\nseventeen.\r\n\r\nKlaas Pool knew nothing of chrysoprase and porphyry. Nor of Byron. Nor,\r\nfor that matter, of jade and Burgundy. But he did know cabbages, both\r\ngreen and red. He knew cabbage from seed to sauerkraut; he knew and grew\r\nvarieties from the sturdy Flat Dutch to the early Wakefield. But that\r\nthey were beautiful; that they looked like jewels; that they lay like\r\nPersian patches, had never entered his head, and rightly. What has the\r\nhead of a cabbage, or, for that matter, of a robust, soil-stained,\r\ntoiling Dutch truck farmer to do with nonsense like chrysoprase, with\r\njade, with Burgundy, with Persian patterns!\r\n\r\nThe horses clopped down the heavy country road. Now and again the bulk\r\nbeside Selina was agitated silently, as before. And from between the\r\ngolden fuzz of stubble beard she would hear, \xe2\x80\x9cCabbages! Cabbages is\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But she did not feel offended. She could not have been offended at\r\nanything to-day. For in spite of her recent tragedy, her nineteen years,\r\nher loneliness, the terrifying thought of this new home to which she was\r\ngoing, among strangers, she was conscious of a warm little thrill of\r\nelation, of excitement\xe2\x80\x94of adventure! That was it. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole thing\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust a grand adventure,\xe2\x80\x9d Simeon Peake had said. Selina gave a little\r\nbounce of anticipation. She was doing a revolutionary and daring thing;\r\na thing that the Vermont and now, fortunately, inaccessible Peakes would\r\nhave regarded with horror. For equipment she had youth, curiosity, a\r\nsteel-strong frame; one brown lady\xe2\x80\x99s-cloth, one wine-red cashmere; four\r\nhundred and ninety-seven dollars; and a gay, adventuresome spirit that\r\nwas never to die, though it led her into curious places and she often\r\nfound, at the end, only a trackless waste from which she had to retrace\r\nher steps, painfully. But always, to her, red and green cabbages were to\r\nbe jade and Burgundy, chrysoprase and porphyry. Life has no weapons\r\nagainst a woman like that.\r\n\r\nSo now, as they bumped and jolted along the road Selina thought herself\r\nlucky, though she was a little terrified. She turned her gaze from the\r\nflat prairie land to the silent figure beside her. Hers was a lively,\r\nvolatile nature, and his uncommunicativeness made her vaguely\r\nuncomfortable. Yet there was nothing glum about his face. Upon it there\r\neven lingered, in the corners of his eyes and about his mouth, faint\r\nshadows of merriment.\r\n\r\nKlaas Pool was a school director. She was to live at his house. Perhaps\r\nshe should not have said that about the cabbages. So now she drew\r\nherself up primly and tried to appear the school teacher, and succeeded\r\nin looking as severe as a white pansy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhem!\xe2\x80\x9d (or nearly that). \xe2\x80\x9cYou have three children, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mr.\r\nPool? They\xe2\x80\x99ll all be my pupils?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKlaas Pool ruminated on this. He concentrated so that a slight frown\r\nmarred the serenity of his brow. In this double question of hers, an\r\nattempt to give the conversation a dignified turn, she had apparently\r\ncreated some difficulty for her host. He was trying to shake his head\r\ntwo ways at the same time. This gave it a rotary motion. Selina saw,\r\nwith amazement, that he was attempting to nod negation and confirmation\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94or they\xe2\x80\x99re not?\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got three children. All will not be your pupils.\xe2\x80\x9d There was\r\nsomething final, unshakable in his delivery of this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! Why not? Which ones won\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis fusillade proved fatal. It served permanently to check the slight\r\ntrickle of conversation which had begun to issue from his lips. They\r\njogged on for perhaps a matter of three miles, in silence. Selina told\r\nherself then, sternly, that she must not laugh. Having told herself\r\nthis, sternly, she began to laugh because she could not help it; a gay\r\nlittle sound that flew out like the whir of a bird\xe2\x80\x99s wing on the crisp\r\nautumnal sunset air. And suddenly this light sound was joined by a slow\r\nrumbling that swelled and bubbled a good deal in the manner of the rich\r\nglubby sounds that issue from a kettle that has been simmering for a\r\nlong time. So they laughed together, these two; the rather scared young\r\nthing who was trying to be prim, and the dull, unimaginative truck\r\nfarmer because this alert, great-eyed, slim white creature perched\r\nbirdlike on the wagon seat beside him had tickled his slow humour-sense.\r\n\r\nSelina felt suddenly friendly and happy. \xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me which ones will and\r\nwhich won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeertje goes to school. Jozina goes to school. Roelf works by the\r\nfarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old is Roelf?\xe2\x80\x9d She was being school teacherly again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoelf is twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve! And no longer at school! But why not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoelf he works by the farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t Roelf like school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think he ought to go to school?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving begun, she could not go back. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t your wife want Roelf to go\r\nto school any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaartje? But sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gathered herself together; hurled herself behind the next question.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why _doesn\xe2\x80\x99t_ he go to school, for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKlaas Pool\xe2\x80\x99s pale blue eyes were fixed on the spot between the horse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears. His face was serene, placid, patient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoelf he works by the farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina subsided, beaten.\r\n\r\nShe wondered about Roelf. Would he be a furtive, slinking boy, like\r\nSmike? Geertje and Jozina. Geertje\xe2\x80\x94Gertrude, of course. Jozina?\r\nJosephine. Maartje?\xe2\x80\x94m-m-m-m\xe2\x80\x94Martha, probably. At any rate, it was\r\ngoing to be interesting. It was going to be wonderful! Suppose she had\r\ngone to Vermont and become a dried apple!\r\n\r\nDusk was coming on. The lake mist came drifting across the prairie and\r\nhung, a pearly haze, over the frost-nipped stubble and the leafless\r\ntrees. It caught the last light in the sky, and held it, giving to\r\nfields, trees, black earth, to the man seated stolidly beside the girl,\r\nand to the face of the girl herself an opalescent glow very wonderful to\r\nsee. Selina, seeing it, opened her lips to exclaim again; and then,\r\nremembering, closed them. She had learned her first lesson in High\r\nPrairie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Klaas Pools lived in a typical High Prairie house. They had passed a\r\nscore like it in the dusk. These sturdy Holland-Americans had built here\r\nin Illinois after the pattern of the squat houses that dot the lowlands\r\nabout Amsterdam, Haarlem, and Rotterdam. A row of pollards stood stiffly\r\nby the roadside. As they turned in at the yard Selina\xe2\x80\x99s eye was caught\r\nby the glitter of glass. The house was many-windowed, the panes the size\r\nof pocket-handkerchiefs. Even in the dusk Selina thought she had never\r\nseen windows sparkle so. She did not then know that spotless\r\nwindow-panes were a mark of social standing in High Prairie. Yard and\r\ndwelling had a geometrical neatness like that of a toy house in a set of\r\nplaythings. The effect was marred by a clothes-line hung with a dado of\r\nmiscellaneous wash\xe2\x80\x94a pair of faded overalls, a shirt, socks, a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrawers carefully patched and now bellying grotesquely in the breeze\r\nlike a comic tramp turned bacchanal. Selina was to know this frieze of\r\nnether garments as a daily decoration in the farm-wife\xe2\x80\x99s yard.\r\n\r\nPeering down over the high wheel she waited for Klaas Pool to assist her\r\nin alighting. He seemed to have no such thought. Having jumped down, he\r\nwas throwing empty crates and boxes out of the back of the wagon. So\r\nSelina, gathering her shawls and cloak about her, clambered down the\r\nside of the wheel and stood looking about her in the dim light, a very\r\nsmall figure in a very large world. Klaas had opened the barn door. Now\r\nhe returned and slapped one of the horses smartly on the flank. The team\r\ntrotted obediently off to the barn. He picked up her little hide-bound\r\ntrunk. She took her satchel. The yard was quite dark now. As Klaas Pool\r\nopened the kitchen door the red mouth that was the open draught in the\r\nkitchen stove grinned a toothy welcome at them.\r\n\r\nA woman stood over the stove, a fork in her hand. The kitchen was clean,\r\nbut disorderly, with the disorder that comes of pressure of work. There\r\nwas a not unpleasant smell of cooking. Selina sniffed it hungrily. The\r\nwoman turned to face them. Selina stared.\r\n\r\nThis, she thought, must be some other\xe2\x80\x94an old woman\xe2\x80\x94his mother perhaps.\r\nBut: \xe2\x80\x9cMaartje, here is school teacher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Klaas Pool. Selina put out\r\nher hand to meet the other woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand, rough, hard, calloused. Her\r\nown, touching it, was like satin against a pine board. Maartje smiled,\r\nand you saw her broken discoloured teeth. She pushed back the sparse\r\nhair from her high forehead, fumbled a little, shyly, at the collar of\r\nher clean blue calico dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleased to meet you,\xe2\x80\x9d Maartje said, primly. \xe2\x80\x9cMake you welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d Then,\r\nas Pool stamped out to the yard, slamming the door behind him, \xe2\x80\x9cPool he\r\ncould have come with you by the front way, too. Lay off your things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSelina began to remove the wrappings that swathed her\xe2\x80\x94the muffler, the\r\nshawl, the cloak. Now she stood, a slim, incongruously elegant little\r\nfigure in that kitchen. The brown lady\xe2\x80\x99s-cloth was very tight and\r\nbasqued above, very flounced and bustled below. \xe2\x80\x9cMy, how you are young!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Maartje. She moved nearer, as if impelled, and fingered the stuff\r\nof Selina\xe2\x80\x99s gown. And as she did this Selina suddenly saw that she, too,\r\nwas young. The bad teeth, the thin hair, the careless dress, the\r\nlittered kitchen, the harassed frown\xe2\x80\x94above all these, standing out\r\nclearly, appeared the look of a girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I do believe she\xe2\x80\x99s not more than twenty-eight!\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said to\r\nherself in a kind of panic. \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe she\xe2\x80\x99s not more than\r\ntwenty-eight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had been aware of the two pigtailed heads appearing and vanishing in\r\nthe doorway of the next room. Now Maartje was shooing her into this\r\nroom. Evidently her hostess was distressed because the school teacher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nformal entrance had not been made by way of parlour instead of kitchen.\r\nShe followed Maartje Pool into the front room. Behind the stove,\r\ntittering, were two yellow-haired little girls. Geertje and Jozina, of\r\ncourse. Selina went over to them, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich is Geertje?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd which Jozina?\xe2\x80\x9d But at this the titters became squeals. They\r\nretired behind the round black bulwark of the woodburner, overcome.\r\nThere was no fire in this shining ebon structure, though the evening was\r\nsharp. Above the stove a length of pipe, glittering with polish as was\r\nthe stove itself, crossed the width of the room and vanished through a\r\nqueer little perforated grating in the ceiling. Selina\xe2\x80\x99s quick glance\r\nencompassed the room. In the window were a few hardy plants in pots on a\r\ngreen-painted wooden rack. There were geraniums, blossomless; a cactus\r\nwith its thick slabs of petals like slices of gangrenous ham set up for\r\nbeauty in a parlour; a plant called Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s ladder, on a spindling\r\ntrellis. The bony scaffolding of the green-painted wooden stand was\r\nturned toward the room. The flowers blindly faced the dark square of the\r\nwindow. There was a sofa with a wrinkled calico cover; three rocking\r\nchairs; some stark crayons of incredibly hard-featured Dutch ancients on\r\nthe wall. It was all neat, stiff, unlovely. But Selina had known too\r\nmany years of boarding-house ugliness to be offended at this.\r\n\r\nMaartje had lighted a small glass-bowled lamp. The chimney of this\r\nsparkled as had the window panes. A steep, uncarpeted stairway,\r\nenclosed, led off the sitting room. Up this Maartje Pool, talking, led\r\nthe way to Selina\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. Selina was to learn that the farm woman,\r\noften inarticulate through lack of companionship, becomes a torrent of\r\ntalk when opportunity presents itself. They made quite a little\r\nprocession. First, Mrs. Pool with the lamp; then Selina with the\r\nsatchel; then, tap-tap, tap-tap, Jozina and Geertje, their heavy\r\nhob-nailed shoes creating a great clatter on the wooden stairs, though\r\nthey were tip-toeing in an effort to make themselves unheard by their\r\nmother. There evidently had been an arrangement on the subject of their\r\ninvisibility. The procession moved to the accompaniment of Maartje\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you stay downstairs didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d There was in her tone a\r\nwarning; a menace. The two pigtails would hang back a moment, only to\r\ncome tap-tapping on again, their saucer eyes at once fearful and\r\nmischievous.\r\n\r\nA narrow, dim, close-smelling hallway, uncarpeted. At the end of it a\r\ndoor opening into the room that was to be Selina\xe2\x80\x99s. As its chill struck\r\nher to the marrow three objects caught her eye. The bed, a huge and not\r\nunhandsome walnut mausoleum, reared its sombre height almost to the\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x99s top. Indeed, its apex of grapes did actually seem to achieve a\r\nmeeting with the whitewashed ceiling. The mattress of straw and\r\ncorn-husks was unworthy of this edifice, but over it Mrs. Pool had\r\nmercifully placed a feather bed, stitched and quilted, so that Selina\r\nlay soft and warm through the winter. Along one wall stood a low chest\r\nso richly brown as to appear black. The front panel of this was\r\ncuriously carved. Selina stooped before it and for the second time that\r\nday said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d then looked quickly round at Maartje Pool as\r\nthough fearful of finding her laughing as Klaas Pool had laughed. But\r\nMrs. Pool\xe2\x80\x99s face reflected the glow in her own. She came over to Selina\r\nand stooped with her over the chest, holding the lamp so that its yellow\r\nflame lighted up the scrolls and tendrils of the carved surface. With\r\none discoloured forefinger she traced the bold flourishes on the panel.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee? How it makes out letters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina peered closer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sure enough! This first one\xe2\x80\x99s an S!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaartje was kneeling before the chest now. \xe2\x80\x9cSure an S. For Sophia. It is\r\na Holland bride\xe2\x80\x99s chest. And here is K. And here is big D. It makes\r\nSophia Kroon DeVries. It is anyways two hundred years. My mother she\r\ngave it to me when I was married, and her mother she gave it to her when\r\nshe was married, and her mother gave it to her when she was married, and\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Selina, rather meaninglessly; but\r\nstemming the torrent. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s in it? Anything? There ought to be bride\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothes in it, yellow with age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Maartje Pool and gave a little bounce that imperilled the\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d The two on their knees sat smiling at each other, wide-eyed, like\r\nschoolgirls. The pigtails, emboldened, had come tap-tapping nearer and\r\nwere peering over the shoulders of the women before the chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x94wait.\xe2\x80\x9d Maartje Pool thrust the lamp into Selina\xe2\x80\x99s hand, raised\r\nthe lid of the chest, dived expertly into its depths amidst a great\r\nrustling of old newspapers and emerged red-faced with a Dutch basque and\r\nvoluminous skirt of silk; an age-yellow cap whose wings, stiff with\r\nembroidery, stood out grandly on either side; a pair of wooden shoes,\r\nstained terra-cotta like the sails of the Vollendam fishing boats, and\r\ncarved from toe to heel in a delicate and intricate pattern. A bridal\r\ngown, a bridal cap, bridal shoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, with the feeling of a little girl in a rich attic\r\non a rainy day. She clasped her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I dress up in it some time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaartje Pool, folding the garments hastily, looked shocked and\r\nhorrified. \xe2\x80\x9cNever must anybody dress up in a bride\xe2\x80\x99s dress only to get\r\nmarried. It brings bad luck.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, as Selina stroked the stiff silken\r\nfolds of the skirt with a slim and caressing forefinger: \xe2\x80\x9cSo you get\r\nmarried to a High Prairie Dutchman I let you wear it.\xe2\x80\x9d At this absurdity\r\nthey both laughed again. Selina thought that this school-teaching\r\nventure was starting out very well. She would have _such_ things to tell\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x94then she remembered. She shivered a little as she stood up\r\nnow. She raised her arms to take off her hat, feeling suddenly tired,\r\ncold, strange in this house with this farm woman, and the two staring\r\nlittle girls, and the great red-faced man. There surged over her a great\r\nwave of longing for her father\xe2\x80\x94for the gay little dinners, for the\r\ntheatre treats, for his humorous philosophical drawl, for the Chicago\r\nstreets, and the ugly Chicago houses; for Julie; for Miss Fister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nschool; for anything and any one that was accustomed, known, and\r\ntherefore dear. Even Aunt Abbie and Aunt Sarah had a not unlovely\r\naspect, viewed from this chill farmhouse bedroom that had suddenly\r\nbecome her home. She had a horrible premonition that she was going to\r\ncry, began to blink very fast, turned a little blindly in the dim light\r\nand caught sight of the room\xe2\x80\x99s third arresting object. A blue-black\r\ncylinder of tin sheeting, like a stove and yet unlike. It was polished\r\nlike the length of pipe in the sitting room below. Indeed, it was\r\nevidently a giant flower of this stem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Selina, pointing.\r\n\r\nMaartje Pool, depositing the lamp on the little wash-stand preparatory\r\nto leaving, smiled pridefully. \xe2\x80\x9cDrum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heat your room.\xe2\x80\x9d Selina touched it. It was icy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen there is\r\nfire,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Pool added, hastily. In her mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye Selina traced the tin\r\ntube below running along the ceiling in the peaceful and orderly path of\r\na stove-pipe, thrusting its way through the cylindrical hole in the\r\nceiling and here bursting suddenly into swollen and monstrous bloom like\r\nan unthinkable goitre on a black neck. Selina was to learn that its\r\nheating powers were mythical. Even when the stove in the sitting room\r\nwas blazing away with a cheerful roar none of the glow communicated\r\nitself to the drum. It remained as coolly indifferent to the blasts\r\nbreathed upon it as a girl hotly besieged by an unwelcome lover. This\r\nwas to influence a number of Selina\xe2\x80\x99s habits, including nocturnal\r\nreading and matutinal bathing. Selina was a daily morning bather in a\r\nperiod which looked upon the daily bath as an eccentricity, or, at best,\r\nan affectation. It would be charming to be able to record that she\r\ncontinued the practice in the Pool household; but a morning bath in the\r\narctic atmosphere of an Illinois prairie farmhouse would not have been\r\neccentric merely, but mad, even if there had been an available kettle of\r\nhot water at 6.30 A. M., which there emphatically was not. Selina was\r\ngrateful for an occasional steaming basin of water at night and a\r\nhurried piecemeal bath by the mythical heat of the drum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaartje!\xe2\x80\x9d roared a voice from belowstairs. The voice of the hungry\r\nmale. There was wafted up, too, a faint smell of scorching. Then came\r\nsounds of a bumping and thumping along the narrow stairway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOg heden!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Maartje, in a panic, her hands high in air. She was\r\noff, sweeping the two pigtails with her in her flight. There were sounds\r\nof scuffling on the stairway, and Maartje\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling something that\r\nsounded like hookendunk to Selina. But she decided that that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe. The bumping now sounded along the passage outside her room. Selina\r\nturned from her satchel to behold a gnome in the doorway. Below, she saw\r\na pair of bow-legs; above, her own little hide-bound trunk; between, a\r\nbroad face, a grizzled beard, a lack-lustre eye in a weather-beaten\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJakob Hoogendunk,\xe2\x80\x9d the gnome announced, briefly, peering up at her from\r\nbeneath the trunk balanced on his back.\r\n\r\nSelina laughed delightedly. \xe2\x80\x9cNot really! Do come in. This is a good\r\nplace, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? Along the wall? Mr.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Hoogendunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJakob Hoogendunk grunted and plodded across the room, the trunk lurching\r\nperilously above his bow-legged stride. He set it down with a final\r\nthump, wiped his nose with the back of his hand\xe2\x80\x94sign of a task\r\ncompleted\xe2\x80\x94and surveyed the trunk largely, as if he had made it. \xe2\x80\x9cThank\r\nyou, Mr. Hoogendunk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, and put out her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Selina\r\nPeake. How\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chow did you leave Rip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of her that in this grizzled hired man, twisted\r\nwith rheumatism, reeking of mould and manure, she should see a direct\r\ndescendant of those gnarled and bearded bowlers so mysteriously\r\nencountered by Rip Van Winkle on that fatal day in the Kaatskills. The\r\nname, too, appealed to her in its comic ugliness. So she laughed a soft\r\nlittle laugh; held out her hand. The man was not offended. He knew that\r\npeople laughed when they were introduced. So he laughed, too, in a\r\nmixture of embarrassment and attempted ease, looking down at the small\r\nhand extended to him. He blinked at it curiously. He wiped his two hands\r\ndown his thighs, hard; then shook his great grizzled head. \xe2\x80\x9cMy hand is\r\nall muck. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t washed up yet,\xe2\x80\x9d and lurched off, leaving Selina\r\nlooking rather helplessly down at her own extended hand. His clatter on\r\nthe wooden stairway sounded like cavalry on a frozen road.\r\n\r\nLeft alone in her room Selina unlocked her trunk and took from it two\r\nphotographs\xe2\x80\x94one of a mild-looking man with his hat a little on one\r\nside, the other of a woman who might have been a twenty-five-year-old\r\nSelina, minus the courageous jaw-line. Looking about for a fitting place\r\non which to stand these leather-framed treasures she considered the top\r\nof the chill drum, humorously, then actually placed them there, for lack\r\nof better refuge, from which vantage point they regarded her with\r\npolitely interested eyes. Perhaps Jakob Hoogendunk would put up a shelf\r\nfor her. That would serve for her little stock of books and for the\r\npictures as well. She was enjoying that little flush of exhilaration\r\nthat comes to a woman, unpacking. There was about her trunk, even though\r\nclosed but this very day, the element of surprise that gilds familiar\r\nobjects when disclosed for the first time in unfamiliar surroundings.\r\nShe took out her neat pile of warm woollen underwear, her stout shoes.\r\nShe shook out the crushed folds of the wine-coloured cashmere. Now, if\r\never, she should have regretted its purchase. But she didn\xe2\x80\x99t. No one,\r\nshe reflected, as she spread it rosily on the bed, possessing a\r\nwine-coloured cashmere could be altogether downcast.\r\n\r\nThe wine cashmere on the bed, the photographs on the drum, her clothes\r\nhanging comfortably on wall-hooks with a calico curtain on a cord\r\nprotecting them, her stock of books on the closed trunk. Already the\r\nroom wore the aspect of familiarity.\r\n\r\nFrom belowstairs came the hiss of frying. Selina washed in the chill\r\nwater of the basin, took down her hair and coiled it again before the\r\nswimmy little mirror over the wash-stand. She adjusted the stitched\r\nwhite bands of the severe collar and patted the cuffs of the brown\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s-cloth. The tight basque was fastened with buttons from throat to\r\nwaist. Her fine long head rose above this trying base with such grace\r\nand dignity as to render the stiff garment beautiful. The skirt billowed\r\nand puffed out behind, and was drawn in folds across the front. It was a\r\nday of appalling bunchiness and equally appalling tightness in dress; of\r\npanniers, galloons, plastrons, reveres, bustles, and all manner of lumpy\r\nbedevilment. That Selina could appear in this disfiguring garment a\r\ncreature still graceful, slim, and pliant was a sheer triumph of spirit\r\nover matter.\r\n\r\nShe blew out the light now and descended the steep wooden stairway to\r\nthe unlighted parlour. The door between parlour and kitchen was closed.\r\nSelina sniffed sensitively. There was pork for supper. She was to learn\r\nthat there always was pork for supper. As the winter wore on she\r\ndeveloped a horror of this porcine fare, remembering to have read\r\nsomewhere that one\xe2\x80\x99s diet was in time reflected in one\xe2\x80\x99s face; that\r\ngross eating made one gross looking. She would examine her features\r\nfearfully in the swimmy mirror\xe2\x80\x94the lovely little white nose\xe2\x80\x94was it\r\ncoarsening? The deep-set dark eyes\xe2\x80\x94were they squinting? The firm sweet\r\nlips\xe2\x80\x94were they broadening? But the reflection in the glass reassured\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment there in the darkness. Then she opened the\r\nkitchen door. There swam out at her a haze of smoke, from which emerged\r\nround blue eyes, guttural talk, the smell of frying grease, of stable,\r\nof loam, and of woollen wash freshly brought in from the line. With an\r\ninrush of cold air that sent the blue haze into swirls the outer kitchen\r\ndoor opened. A boy, his arm piled high with stove-wood, entered; a dark,\r\nhandsome sullen boy who stared at Selina over the armload of wood.\r\nSelina stared back at him. There sprang to life between the boy of\r\ntwelve and the woman of nineteen an electric current of feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoelf,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Selina; and even took a step toward him, inexplicably\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry then with that wood there!\xe2\x80\x9d fretted Maartje at the stove. The boy\r\nflung the armful into the box, brushed his sleeve and coat-front\r\nmechanically, still looking at Selina. A slave to the insatiable maw of\r\nthe wood-box.\r\n\r\nKlaas Pool, already at table, thumped with his knife. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down! Sit\r\ndown, teacher.\xe2\x80\x9d Selina hesitated, looked at Maartje. Maartje was holding\r\na frying pan aloft in one hand while with the other she thrust and poked\r\na fresh stick of wood into the open-lidded stove. The two pigtails\r\nseated themselves at the table, set with its red-checked cloth and\r\nbone-handled cutlery. Jakob Hoogendunk, who had been splashing,\r\nsnorting, and puffing porpoise-fashion in a corner over a hand-basin\r\nwhose cubic contents were out of all proportion to the sounds extracted\r\ntherefrom, now seated himself. Roelf flung his cap on a wall-hook and\r\nsat down. Only Selina and Maartje remained standing. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down! Sit\r\ndown!\xe2\x80\x9d Klaas Pool said again, jovially. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how is cabbages?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nchuckled and winked. Jakob Hoogendunk snorted. A duet of titters from\r\nthe pigtails. Maartje at the stove smiled; but a trifle grimly, one\r\nmight have thought, watching her. Evidently Klaas had not hugged his\r\njoke in secret. Only the boy Roelf remained unsmiling. Even Selina,\r\nfeeling the red mounting her cheeks, smiled a little, nervously, and sat\r\ndown with some suddenness.\r\n\r\nMaartje Pool now thumped down on the table a great bowl of potatoes\r\nfried in grease; a platter of ham. There was bread cut in chunks. The\r\ncoffee was rye, roasted in the oven, ground, and taken without sugar or\r\ncream. Of this food there was plenty. It made Mrs. Tebbitt\xe2\x80\x99s Monday\r\nnight meal seem ambrosial. Selina\xe2\x80\x99s visions of chickens, oly-koeks, wild\r\nducks, crusty crullers, and pumpkin pies vanished, never to return. She\r\nhad been very hungry, but now, as she talked, nodded, smiled, she cut\r\nher food into infinitesimal bites, did not chew them so very well, and\r\ndespised herself for being dainty. A slight, distinctive little figure\r\nthere in the yellow lamplight, eating this coarse fare bravely, turning\r\nher soft dark glance on the woman who was making countless trips from\r\nstove to table, from table to stove; on the sullen handsome boy with his\r\npurplish chapped hands and his sombre eyes; on the two round-eyed,\r\nred-cheeked little girls; on the great red-faced full-lipped man eating\r\nhis supper noisily and with relish; on Jakob Hoogendunk, grazing\r\ngreedily. . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s going to be different enough, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncertain. . . . This is a vegetable farm, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t eat vegetables.\r\nI wonder why. . . . What a pity that she lets herself look like that,\r\njust because she\xe2\x80\x99s a farm woman. Her hair screwed into that knob, her\r\nskin rough and neglected. That hideous dress. Shapeless. She\xe2\x80\x99s not bad\r\nlooking, either. A red spot on either cheek, now; and her eyes so blue.\r\nA little like those women in the Dutch pictures Father took me to see\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94where?\xe2\x80\x94where?\xe2\x80\x94New York, years ago?\xe2\x80\x94yes. A woman in a kitchen, a\r\ndark sort of room with pots of brass on a shelf; a high mullioned\r\nwindow. But that woman\xe2\x80\x99s face was placid. This one\xe2\x80\x99s strained. Why need\r\nshe look like that, frowsy, harried, old! . . . The boy is, somehow,\r\nforeign looking\xe2\x80\x94Italian. Queer. . . . They talk a good deal like some\r\nGerman neighbours we had in Milwaukee. They twist sentences. Literal\r\ntranslations from the Dutch, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d . . .\r\n\r\nJakob Hoogendunk was talking. Supper over, the men sat relaxed, pipe in\r\nmouth. Maartje was clearing the supper things, with Geertje and Jozina\r\nmaking a great pretense at helping. If they giggled like that in school,\r\nSelina thought, she would, in time, go mad, and knock their pigtailed\r\nheads together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got to have rich bottom land,\xe2\x80\x9d Hoogendunk was saying, \xe2\x80\x9celse you get\r\nlittle tough stringy stuff. I seen it in market Friday, laying. Stick to\r\nvegetables that is vegetables and not new-fangled stuff. Celery! What is\r\ncelery! It ain\xe2\x80\x99t rightly a vegetable, and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t a yerb. Look how\r\nVoorhees he used as much as one hundred fifty pounds nitrate of sody,\r\nlet alone regular fertilizer, and what comes from it? Little stringy\r\nstuff. You got to have rich bottom land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina was interested. She had always thought that vegetables grew. You\r\nput them in the ground\xe2\x80\x94seeds or something\xe2\x80\x94and pretty soon things came\r\npopping up\xe2\x80\x94potatoes, cabbages, onions, carrots, beets. But what was\r\nthis thing called nitrate of soda? It must have had something to do with\r\nthe creamed cabbage at Mrs. Tebbitt\xe2\x80\x99s. And she had never known it. And\r\nwhat was regular fertilizer? She leaned forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a regular fertilizer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKlaas Pool and Jakob Hoogendunk looked at her. She looked at them, her\r\nfine intelligent eyes alight with interest. Pool then tipped back his\r\nchair, lifted a stove-lid, spat into the embers, replaced the lid and\r\nrolled his eyes in the direction of Jakob Hoogendunk. Hoogendunk rolled\r\nhis slow gaze in the direction of Klaas Pool. Then both turned to look\r\nat this audacious female who thus interrupted men\xe2\x80\x99s conversation.\r\n\r\nPool took his pipe from his mouth, blew a thin spiral, wiped his mouth\r\nwith the back of his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cRegular fertilizer is\xe2\x80\x94regular fertilizer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJakob Hoogendunk nodded his solemn confirmation of this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s in it?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Selina.\r\n\r\nPool waved a huge red hand as though to waft away this troublesome\r\ninsect. He looked at Maartje. But Maartje was slamming about her work.\r\nGeertje and Jozina were absorbed in some game of their own behind the\r\nstove. Roelf, at the table, sat reading, one slim hand, chapped and\r\ngritty with rough work, outspread on the cloth. Selina noticed, without\r\nknowing she noticed, that the fingers were long, slim, and the broken\r\nnails thin and fine. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s in it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said again. Suddenly life\r\nin the kitchen hung suspended. The two men frowned. Maartje half turned\r\nfrom her dishpan. The two little girls peered out from behind the stove.\r\nRoelf looked up from his book. Even the collie, lying in front of the\r\nstove half asleep, suddenly ran his tongue out, winked one eye. But\r\nSelina, all sociability, awaited her answer. She could not know that in\r\nHigh Prairie women did not brazenly intrude thus on men\xe2\x80\x99s weighty\r\nconversation. The men looked at her, unanswering. She began to feel a\r\nlittle uncomfortable. The boy Roelf rose and went to the cupboard in the\r\nkitchen corner. He took down a large green-bound book, and placed it in\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s hand. The book smelled terribly. Its covers were greasy with\r\nhandling. On the page margins a brown stain showed the imprint of\r\nfingers. Roelf pointed at a page. Selina followed the line with her eye.\r\n\r\n             Good Basic Fertilizer for Market-Garden Crops.\r\n\r\nThen, below:\r\n\r\n                           Nitrate of soda.\r\n                           Ammonium sulfate.\r\n                           Dried blood.\r\n\r\nSelina shut the book and handed it back to Roelf, gingerly. Dried blood!\r\nShe stared at the two men. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean by dried blood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKlaas answered stubbornly, \xe2\x80\x9cDried blood is dried blood. You put in the\r\nfield dried blood and it makes grow. Cabbages, onions, squash.\xe2\x80\x9d At sight\r\nof her horrified face he grinned. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, cabbages is anyway beautiful,\r\nhuh?\xe2\x80\x9d He rolled a facetious eye around at Jakob. Evidently this joke was\r\ngoing to last him the winter.\r\n\r\nSelina stood up. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t annoyed; but she wanted, suddenly, to be\r\nalone in her room\xe2\x80\x94in the room that but an hour before had been a\r\nstrange and terrifying chamber with its towering bed, its chill drum,\r\nits ghostly bride\xe2\x80\x99s chest. Now it had become a refuge, snug, safe,\r\ninfinitely desirable. She turned to Mrs. Pool. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go up to\r\nmy room. I\xe2\x80\x99m very tired. The ride, I suppose. I\xe2\x80\x99m not used . . .\xe2\x80\x9d Her\r\nvoice trailed off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maartje, briskly. She had finished the supper dishes and\r\nwas busy with a huge bowl, flour, a baking board. \xe2\x80\x9cSure go up. I got my\r\nbread to set yet and what all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could have some hot water\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoelf! Stop once that reading and show school teacher where is hot\r\nwater. Geertje! Jozina! Never in my world did I see such.\xe2\x80\x9d She cuffed a\r\nconvenient pigtail by way of emphasis. A wail arose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother.\xe2\x80\x9d Selina was in a sort of\r\npanic now. She wanted to be out of the room. But the boy Roelf, with\r\nquiet swiftness, had taken a battered tin pail from its hook on the\r\nwall, had lifted an iron slab at the back of the kitchen stove. A mist\r\nof steam arose. He dipped the pail into the tiny reservoir thus\r\nrevealed. Then, as Selina made as though to take it, he walked past her.\r\nShe heard him ascending the wooden stairway. She wanted to be after him.\r\nBut first she must know the name of the book over which he had been\r\nporing. But between her and the book outspread on the table were Pool,\r\nHoogendunk, dog, pigtails, Maartje. She pointed with a determined\r\nforefinger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that book Roelf was reading?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaartje thumped a great ball of dough on the baking board. Her arms were\r\nwhite with flour. She kneaded and pummelled expertly. \xe2\x80\x9cWoorden boek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell. That meant nothing. Woorden boek. Woorden b\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Dimly the meaning\r\nof the Dutch words began to come to her. But it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. She brushed\r\npast the men in the tipped-back chairs, stepped over the collie, reached\r\nacross the table. Woorden\xe2\x80\x94word. Boek\xe2\x80\x94book. Word book. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s reading\r\nthe dictionary!\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said, aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s reading the dictionary!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nhad the horrible feeling that she was going to laugh and cry at once;\r\nhysteria.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pool glanced around. \xe2\x80\x9cSchool teacher he gave it to Roelf time he\r\nquit last year for spring planting. A word book. In it is more as a\r\nhundred thousand words, all different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina flung a good-night over her shoulder and made for the stairway.\r\nHe should have all her books. She would send to Chicago for books. She\r\nwould spend her thirty dollars a month buying books for him. He had been\r\nreading the dictionary!\r\n\r\nRoelf had placed the pail of hot water on the little wash-stand, and had\r\nlighted the glass lamp. He was intent on replacing the glass chimney\r\nwithin the four prongs that held it firm. Downstairs, in the crowded\r\nkitchen, he had seemed quite the man. Now, in the yellow lamplight, his\r\nprofile sharply outlined, she saw that he was just a small boy with\r\ntousled hair. About his cheeks, his mouth, his chin one could even see\r\nthe last faint traces of soft infantile roundness. His trousers,\r\nabsurdly cut down from a man\xe2\x80\x99s pair by inexpert hands, hung grotesquely\r\nabout his slim shanks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just a little boy,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Selina, with a quick pang. He was\r\nabout to pass her now, without glancing at her, his head down. She put\r\nout her hand; touched his shoulder. He looked up at her, his face\r\nstartlingly alive, his eyes blazing. It came to Selina that until now\r\nshe had not heard him speak. Her hand pressed the thin stuff of his coat\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCabbages\xe2\x80\x94fields of cabbages\xe2\x80\x94what you said\xe2\x80\x94they _are_ beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nstammered. He was terribly in earnest. Before she could reply he was out\r\nof the room, clattering down the stairs.\r\n\r\nSelina stood, blinking a little.\r\n\r\nThe glow that warmed her now endured while she splashed about in the\r\ninadequate basin; took down the dark soft masses of her hair; put on the\r\nvoluminous long-sleeved, high-necked nightgown. Just before she blew out\r\nthe lamp her last glimpse was of the black drum stationed like a patient\r\neunuch in the corner; and she could smile at that; even giggle a little,\r\nwhat with weariness, excitement, and a general feeling of being awake in\r\na dream. But once in the vast bed she lay there utterly lost in the\r\nwaves of terror and loneliness that envelop one at night in a strange\r\nhouse amongst strange people. She lay there, tensed and tight, her toes\r\ncurled with nervousness, her spine hunched with it, her leg muscles\r\ntaut. She peeked over the edge of the covers looking a good deal like a\r\nfrightened brownie, if one could have seen her; her eyes very wide, the\r\npupils turned well toward the corners with the look of listening and\r\ndistrust. The sharp November air cut in from the fields that were\r\nfertilized with dried blood. She shivered, and wrinkled up her lovely\r\nlittle nose and seemed to sniff this loathsome taint in the air. She\r\nlistened to the noises that came from belowstairs; voices gruff,\r\nunaccustomed; shrill, high. These ceased and gave place to others less\r\naccustomed to her city-bred ears; a dog\xe2\x80\x99s bark and an answering one; a\r\nfar-off train whistle; the dull thud of hoofs stamping on the barn\r\nfloor; the wind in the bare tree branches outside the window.\r\n\r\nHer watch\xe2\x80\x94a gift from Simeon Peake on her eighteenth birthday\xe2\x80\x94with the\r\ngold case all beautifully engraved with a likeness of a gate, and a\r\nchurch, and a waterfall and a bird, linked together with spirals and\r\nflourishes of the most graceful description, was ticking away\r\ncompanionably under her pillow. She felt for it, took it out and held it\r\nin her palm, under her cheek, for comfort.\r\n\r\nShe knew she would not sleep that night. She knew she would not\r\nsleep\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nShe awoke to a clear, cold November dawn; children\xe2\x80\x99s voices; the\r\nneighing of horses; a great sizzling and hissing, and scent of frying\r\nbacon; a clucking and squawking in the barnyard. It was six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s first day as a school teacher. In a little more than two hours\r\nshe would be facing a whole roomful of round-eyed Geertjes and Jozinas\r\nand Roelfs. The bedroom was cruelly cold. As she threw the bed-clothes\r\nheroically aside Selina decided that it took an appalling amount of\r\ncourage\xe2\x80\x94this life that Simeon Peake had called a great adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery morning throughout November it was the same. At six o\xe2\x80\x99clock: \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nPeake! _Oh_, Miss Peake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m up!\xe2\x80\x9d Selina would call in what she meant to be a gay voice, through\r\nchattering teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou better come down and dress where is warm here by the stove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeering down the perforations in the floor-hole through which the\r\nparlour chimney swelled so proudly into the drum, Selina could vaguely\r\ndescry Mrs. Pool stationed just below, her gaze upturned.\r\n\r\nThat first morning, on hearing this invitation, Selina had been rocked\r\nbetween horror and mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not cold, really. I\xe2\x80\x99m almost dressed.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be down directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaartje Pool must have sensed some of the shock in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s voice; or,\r\nperhaps, even some of the laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cPool and Jakob are long out already\r\ncutting. Here back of the stove you can dress warm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShivering and tempted though she was, Selina had set her will against\r\nit. A little hardening of the muscles around her jaw so that they stood\r\nout whitely beneath the fine-grained skin. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go down,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nto herself, shaking with the cold. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t come down to dressing behind\r\nthe kitchen stove like a\xe2\x80\x94like a peasant in one of those dreadful\r\nRussian novels. . . . That sounds stuck up and horrid. . . . The Pools\r\nare good and kind and decent. . . . But I _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ come down to huddling\r\nbehind the stove with a bundle of underwear in my arms. Oh, _dear_, this\r\ncorset\xe2\x80\x99s like a casing of ice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeertje and Jozina had no such maidenly scruples. Each morning they\r\ngathered their small woollen garments in a bundle and scudded briskly to\r\nthe kitchen for warmth, though their bedroom just off the parlour had by\r\nno means the degree of refrigeration possessed by Selina\xe2\x80\x99s clammy\r\nchamber. Not only that, the Misses Pool slept snugly in the woollen\r\nnether garments that invested them by day and so had only mounds of\r\nwoollen petticoats, woollen stockings, and mysterious grimy straps,\r\nbands, and fastenings with which to struggle. Their intimate flannels\r\nhad a cactus quality that made the early martyrs\xe2\x80\x99 hair shirts seem, in\r\ncomparison, but a fleece-lined cloud. Dressing behind the kitchen stove\r\nwas a natural and universal custom in High Prairie.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of December as Selina stuck her nose cautiously out of the\r\ncovers into the midnight blackness of early morning you might have\r\nobserved, if it had been at all light, that the tip of that elegant and\r\nerstwhile alabaster feature had been encarmined during the night by a\r\nmischievous brush wielded by that same wight who had been busy painting\r\nfronds and lacy ferns and gorgeous blossoms of silver all over the\r\nbedroom window. Slowly, inch by inch, that bedroom window crept down,\r\ndown. Then, too, the Pools objected to the icy blasts which swept the\r\nopen stairway and penetrated their hermetically sealed bedrooms below.\r\nOften the water in the pitcher on her washstand was frozen when Selina\r\nawoke. Her garments, laid out the night before so that their donning\r\nnext morning might occupy a minimum of time, were mortuary to the touch.\r\nWorst of all were the steel-stiffened, unwieldy, and ridiculous stays\r\nthat encased the female form of that day. As Selina\xe2\x80\x99s numbed fingers\r\nstruggled with the fastenings of this iciest of garments her ribs shrank\r\nfrom its arctic embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I won\xe2\x80\x99t dress behind the kitchen stove!\xe2\x80\x9d declared Selina, glaring\r\nmeanwhile at that hollow pretense, the drum. She even stuck her tongue\r\nout at it (only nineteen, remember!). For that matter, it may as well be\r\nknown that she brought home a piece of chalk from school and sketched a\r\ndemon face on the drum\xe2\x80\x99s bulging front, giving it a personal and horrid\r\naspect that afforded her much satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhen she thought back, years later, on that period of her High Prairie\r\nexperience, stoves seemed to figure with absurd prominence in her\r\nmemory. That might well be. A stove changed the whole course of her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, the schoolhouse stove was her b\xc3\xaate noir. Out of the\r\nwelter of that first year it stood, huge and menacing, a black tyrant.\r\nThe High Prairie schoolhouse in which Selina taught was a little more\r\nthan a mile up the road beyond the Pool farm. She came to know that road\r\nin all its moods\xe2\x80\x94ice-locked, drifted with snow, wallowing in mud.\r\nSchool began at half-past eight. After her first week Selina had the\r\nmathematics of her early morning reduced to the least common\r\ndenominator. Up at six. A plunge into the frigid garments; breakfast of\r\nbread, cheese, sometimes bacon, always rye coffee without cream or\r\nsugar. On with the cloak, muffler, hood, mittens, galoshes. The lunch\r\nbox in bad weather. Up the road to the schoolhouse, battling the prairie\r\nwind that whipped the tears into the eyes, ploughing the drifts,\r\nslipping on the hard ruts and icy ridges in dry weather. Excellent at\r\nnineteen. As she flew down the road in sun or rain, in wind or snow, her\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x99s eye was fixed on the stove. The schoolhouse reached, her numbed\r\nfingers wrestled with the rusty lock. The door opened, there smote her\r\nthe schoolroom smell\xe2\x80\x94a mingling of dead ashes, kerosene, unwashed\r\nbodies, dust, mice, chalk, stove-wood, lunch crumbs, mould, slate that\r\nhas been washed with saliva. Into this Selina rushed, untying her\r\nmuffler as she entered. In the little vestibule there was a box piled\r\nwith chunks of stove-wood and another heaped with dried corn-cobs.\r\nAlongside this a can of kerosene. The cobs served as kindling. A dozen\r\nor more of these you soaked with kerosene and stuffed into the maw of\r\nthe rusty iron pot-bellied stove. A match. Up flared the corn-cobs. Now\r\nwas the moment for a small stick of wood; another to keep it company.\r\nShut the door. Draughts. Dampers. Smoke. Suspense. A blaze, then a\r\ncrackle. The wood has caught. In with a chunk now. A wait. Another\r\nchunk. Slam the door. The schoolhouse fire is started for the day. As\r\nthe room thawed gradually Selina removed layers of outer garments. By\r\nthe time the children arrived the room was livable.\r\n\r\nNaturally, those who sat near this monster baked; those near the windows\r\nfroze. Sometimes Selina felt she must go mad beholding the writhings and\r\ncontortions of a roomful of wriggling bodies scratching at backs, legs,\r\nand sides as the stove grew hotter and flesh rebelled against the harsh\r\ncontact with the prickling undergarments of an over-cautious day.\r\n\r\nSelina had seen herself, dignified, yet gentle, instructing a roomful of\r\nDutch cherubs in the simpler elements of learning. But it is difficult\r\nto be dignified and gracious when you are suffering from chilblains.\r\nSelina fell victim to this sordid discomfort, as did every child in the\r\nroom. She sat at the battered pine desk or moved about, a little\r\nice-wool shawl around her shoulders when the wind was wrong and the\r\nstove balky. Her white little face seemed whiter in contrast with the\r\nblack folds of this sombre garment. Her slim hands were rough and\r\nchapped. The oldest child in the room was thirteen, the youngest four\r\nand a half. From eight-thirty until four Selina ruled this grubby\r\ndomain; a hot-and-cold roomful of sneezing, coughing, wriggling,\r\nshuffling, dozing children, toe scuffling on agonized heel, and heel\r\nscrunching on agonized toe, in a frenzy of itching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAggie Vander Sijde, parse this sentence: The ground is wet because it\r\nhas rained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Vander Sijde, eleven, arises with a switching of skirts and a\r\ntossing of pigtail. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ground\xe2\x80\x99 the subject; \xe2\x80\x98is wet\xe2\x80\x99 the predicate;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98because\xe2\x80\x99 . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina is listening with school-teacherly expression indicative of\r\nencouragement and approval. \xe2\x80\x9cJan Snip, parse this sentence: The flower\r\nwill wither if it is picked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrown lady\xe2\x80\x99s cloth; ice-wool shawl; chalk in hand. Just a phase; a brief\r\nchapter in the adventure. Something to remember and look back on with a\r\nmingling of amusement and wonder. Things were going to happen. Such\r\nthings, with life and life and life stretching ahead of her! In five\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94two\xe2\x80\x94even one, perhaps, who knows but that she might be lying on\r\nlacy pillows on just such a bleak winter morning, a satin coverlet over\r\nher, the morning light shaded by soft rose-coloured hangings. (Early\r\ninfluence of the _Fireside Companion_.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time is it, Celeste?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is now eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould madame like that I prepare her bath now, or later?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLater, Celeste. My chocolate now. My letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c. . . and if is the conjunction modifying . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEarly in the winter Selina had had the unfortunate idea of opening the\r\nice-locked windows at intervals and giving the children five minutes of\r\nexercise while the fresh cold air cleared brains and room at once. Arms\r\nwaved wildly, heads wobbled, short legs worked vigorously. At the end of\r\nthe week twenty High Prairie parents sent protests by note or word of\r\nmouth. Jan and Cornelius, Katrina and Aggie went to school to learn\r\nreading and writing and numbers, not to stand with open windows in the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nOn the Pool farm the winter work had set in. Klaas drove into Chicago\r\nwith winter vegetables only once a week now. He and Jakob and Roelf were\r\nstoring potatoes and cabbages underground; repairing fences; preparing\r\nframes for the early spring planting; sorting seedlings. It had been\r\nRoelf who had taught Selina to build the schoolhouse fire. He had gone\r\nwith her on that first morning, had started the fire, filled the water\r\npail, initiated her in the rites of corn-cobs, kerosene, and dampers. A\r\nshy, dark, silent boy. She set out deliberately to woo him to\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoelf, I have a book called \xe2\x80\x98Ivanhoe.\xe2\x80\x99 Would you like to read it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t get much time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to hurry. Right there in the house. And there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother called \xe2\x80\x98The Three Musketeers\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was trying not to look pleased; to appear stolid and Dutch, like the\r\npeople from whom he had sprung. Some Dutch sailor ancestor, Selina\r\nthought, or fisherman, must have touched at an Italian port or Spanish\r\nand brought back a wife whose eyes and skin and feeling for beauty had\r\nskipped layer on layer of placid Netherlanders to crop out now in this\r\nwistful sensitive boy.\r\n\r\nSelina had spoken to Jakob Hoogendunk about a shelf for her books and\r\nher photographs. He had put up a rough bit of board, very crude and\r\nugly, but it had served. She had come home one snowy afternoon to find\r\nthis shelf gone and in its place a smooth and polished one, with\r\nbrackets intricately carved. Roelf had cut, planed, polished, and carved\r\nit in many hours of work in the cold little shed off the kitchen. He had\r\nthere a workshop of sorts, fitted with such tools and implements as he\r\ncould devise. He did man\xe2\x80\x99s work on the farm, yet often at night Selina\r\ncould faintly hear the rasp of his handsaw after she had gone to bed. He\r\nhad built a doll\xe2\x80\x99s house for Geertje and Jozina that was the black envy\r\nof every pigtail in High Prairie. This sort of thing was looked upon by\r\nKlaas Pool as foolishness. Roelf\xe2\x80\x99s real work in the shed was the making\r\nand mending of coldframes and hotbeds for the early spring plants.\r\nWhenever possible Roelf neglected this dull work for some fancy of his\r\nown. To this Klaas Pool objected as being \xe2\x80\x9cdumb.\xe2\x80\x9d For that matter, High\r\nPrairie considered Pool\xe2\x80\x99s boy \xe2\x80\x9cdumb like.\xe2\x80\x9d He said such things. When the\r\nnew Dutch Reformed Church was completed after gigantic effort\xe2\x80\x94red\r\nbrick, and the first brick church in High Prairie\xe2\x80\x94bright yellow painted\r\npews\xe2\x80\x94a red and yellow glass window, most handsome\xe2\x80\x94the Reverend\r\nVaarwerk brought from New Haarlem to preach the first sermon\xe2\x80\x94Pool\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nRoelf was heard to hint darkly to a group of High Prairie boys that some\r\nnight he was going to burn the church down. It was ugly. It hurt you to\r\nlook at it, just.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the boy was different. Selina, none too knowledgeous herself,\r\nstill recognized that here was something rare, something precious to be\r\nfostered, shielded, encouraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoelf, stop that foolishness, get your ma once some wood. Carving on\r\nthat box again instead finishing them coldframes. Some day, by golly, I\r\nshow you. I break every stick . . . dumb as a Groningen . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoelf did not sulk. He seemed not to mind, particularly, but he came\r\nback to the carved box as soon as chance presented itself. Maartje and\r\nKlaas Pool were not cruel people, nor unkind. They were a little\r\nbewildered by this odd creature that they, inexplicably enough, had\r\nproduced. It was not a family given to demonstration of affection. Life\r\nwas too grim for the flowering of this softer side. Then, too, they had\r\nsprung from a phlegmatic and unemotional people. Klaas toiled like a\r\nslave in the fields and barn; Maartje\xe2\x80\x99s day was a treadmill of cooking,\r\nscrubbing, washing, mending from the moment she arose (four in the\r\nsummer, five in the winter) until she dropped with a groan in her bed\r\noften long after the others were asleep. Selina had never seen her kiss\r\nGeertje or Jozina. But once she had been a little startled to see\r\nMaartje, on one of her countless trips between stove and table, run her\r\nhand through the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shock of black hair, down the side of his face to\r\nhis chin which she tipped up with an indescribably tender gesture as she\r\nlooked down into his eyes. It was a movement fleeting, vague, yet\r\ninfinitely compassionate. Sometimes she even remonstrated when Klaas\r\nberated Roelf. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave the boy be, then, Klaas. Leave him be, once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe loves him best,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina thought. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d even try to understand him\r\nif she had time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was reading her books with such hunger as to cause her to wonder if\r\nher stock would last him the winter. Sometimes, after supper, when he\r\nwas hammering and sawing away in the little shed Selina would snatch\r\nMaartje\xe2\x80\x99s old shawl off the hook, and swathed in this against draughty\r\nchinks, she would read aloud to him while he carved, or talk to him\r\nabove the noise of his tools. Selina was a gay and volatile person. She\r\nloved to make this boy laugh. His dark face would flash into almost\r\ndazzling animation. Sometimes Maartje, hearing their young laughter,\r\nwould come to the shed door and stand there a moment, hugging her arms\r\nin her rolled apron and smiling at them, uncomprehending but\r\ncompanionable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make fun, h\xe2\x80\x99m?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Mrs. Pool. Sit down on my box and make fun, too. Here, you may\r\nhave half the shawl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOg Heden! I got no time to sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d She was off.\r\n\r\nRoelf slid his plane slowly, more slowly, over the surface of a\r\nsatin-smooth oak board. He stopped, twined a curl of shaving about his\r\nfinger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am a man, and earning, I am going to buy my mother a\r\nsilk dress like I saw in a store in Chicago and she should put it on\r\nevery day, not only for Sunday; and sit in a chair and make little fine\r\nstitches like Widow Paarlenberg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else are you going to do when you grow up?\xe2\x80\x9d She waited, certain\r\nthat he would say something delightful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive the team to town alone to market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Roelf!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. Already I have gone five times\xe2\x80\x94twice with Jakob and three times\r\nwith Pop. Pretty soon, when I am seventeen or eighteen, I can go alone.\r\nAt five in the afternoon you start and at nine you are in the Haymarket.\r\nThere all night you sleep on the wagon. There are gas lights. The men\r\nplay dice and cards. At four in the morning you are ready when they\r\ncome, the commission men and the pedlers and the grocery men. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfine, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoelf!\xe2\x80\x9d She was bitterly disappointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere. Look.\xe2\x80\x9d He rummaged around in a dusty box in a corner and,\r\nsuddenly shy again, laid before her a torn sheet of coarse brown paper\r\non which he had sketched crudely, effectively, a m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e of great-haunched\r\nhorses; wagons piled high with garden truck; men in overalls and\r\ncorduroys; flaring gas torches. He had drawn it with a stub of pencil\r\nexactly as it looked to him. The result was as startling as that\r\nachieved by the present-day disciple of the impressionistic school.\r\n\r\nSelina was enchanted.\r\n\r\nMany of her evenings during November were spent thus. The family life\r\nwas lived in a kitchen blue with pipe smoke, heavy with the smell of\r\ncooking. Sometimes\xe2\x80\x94though rarely\xe2\x80\x94a fire was lighted in the parlour\r\nstove. Often she had school papers to correct\xe2\x80\x94grubby sheaves of\r\narithmetic, grammar, or spelling lessons. Often she longed to read;\r\nwanted to sew. Her bedroom was too cold. The men sat in the kitchen or\r\ntramped in and out. Geertje and Jozina scuffled and played. Maartje\r\nscuttled about like a harried animal, heavy-footed but incredibly swift.\r\nThe floor was always gritty with the sandy loam tracked in by the men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheavy boots.\r\n\r\nOnce, early in December, Selina went into town. The trip was born of\r\nsudden revolt against her surroundings and a great wave of nostalgia for\r\nthe dirt and clamour and crowds of Chicago. Early Saturday morning Klaas\r\ndrove her to the railway station five miles distant. She was to stay\r\nuntil Sunday. A letter had been written Julie Hempel ten days before,\r\nbut there had been no answer. Once in town she went straight to the\r\nHempel house. Mrs. Hempel, thin-lipped, met her in the hall and said\r\nthat Julie was out of town. She was visiting her friend Miss Arnold, in\r\nKansas City. Selina was not asked to stay to dinner. She was not asked\r\nto sit down. When she left the house her great fine eyes seemed larger\r\nand more deep-set than ever, and her jaw-line was set hard against the\r\ninvasion of tears. Suddenly she hated this Chicago that wanted none of\r\nher; that brushed past her, bumping her elbow and offering no apology;\r\nthat clanged, and shrieked, and whistled, and roared in her ears now\r\ngrown accustomed to the prairie silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, which meant she did. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Just you\r\nwait. Some day I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be\xe2\x80\x94oh, terribly important. And people will\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98Do you know that wonderful Selina Peake? Well, they say she used\r\nto be a country school teacher and slept in an ice-cold room and ate\r\npork three times a . . .\xe2\x80\x99 There! I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do. I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto have luncheon and I\xe2\x80\x99ll order the most delicious things. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo to the Palmer House where Father and I . . . no, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nthat. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the Auditorium Hotel restaurant and have ice cream; and\r\nchicken broth in a silver cup; and cream puffs, and all kinds of\r\nvegetables and little lamb chops in paper panties. And orange pekoe\r\ntea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe actually did order all these things and had a group of amazed\r\nwaiters hovering about her table waiting to see her devour this meal,\r\nmuch as a similar group had stared at David Copperfield when he was\r\ninnocent of having bolted the huge dinner ordered in the inn on his way\r\nto London.\r\n\r\nShe ate the ice cream and drank the orange pekoe (mainly because she\r\nloved the sound of its name; it made her think of chrysanthemums and\r\ncherry blossoms, spices, fans, and slant-eyed maidens). She devoured a\r\ncrisp salad with the avidity of a canary pecking at a lettuce leaf. She\r\nflirted with the lamb chops. She remembered the size of her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngenerous tips and left a sum on the table that temporarily dulled the\r\nedge of the waiter\xe2\x80\x99s hatred of women diners. But the luncheon could not\r\nbe said to have been a success. She thought of dinner, and her spirit\r\nquailed. She spent the time between one and three buying portable\r\npresents for the entire Pool household\xe2\x80\x94including bananas for Geertje\r\nand Jozina, for whom that farinaceous fruit had the fascination always\r\nheld for the farm child. She caught a train at four thirty-five and\r\nactually trudged the five miles from the station to the farm, arriving\r\nhalf frozen, weary, with aching arms and nipped toes, to a great welcome\r\nof the squeals, grunts, barks, and gutturals that formed the expression\r\nof the Pool household. She was astonished to find how happy she was to\r\nreturn to the kitchen stove, to the smell of frying pork, to her own\r\nroom with the walnut bed and the book shelf. Even the grim drum had\r\ntaken on the dear and comforting aspect of the accustomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh Prairie swains failed to find Selina alluring. She was too small,\r\ntoo pale and fragile for their robust taste. Naturally, her coming had\r\nbeen an event in this isolated community. She would have been surprised\r\nto know with what eagerness and curiosity High Prairie gathered crumbs\r\nof news about her; her appearance, her manner, her dress. Was she stuck\r\nup? Was she new fangled? She failed to notice the agitation of the\r\nparlour curtains behind the glittering windows of the farmhouses she\r\npassed on her way to school. With no visible means of communication news\r\nof her leaped from farm to farm as flame leaps the gaps in a forest\r\nfire. She would have been aghast to learn that High Prairie,\r\ninexplicably enough, knew all about her from the colour of the ribbon\r\nthat threaded her neat little white corset covers to the number of books\r\non her shelf. She thought cabbage fields beautiful; she read books to\r\nthat dumb-acting Roelf Pool; she was making over a dress for Maartje\r\nafter the pattern of the stylish brown lady\xe2\x80\x99s-cloth she wore (foolishly)\r\nto school. Now and then she encountered a team on the road. She would\r\ncall a good-day. Sometimes the driver answered, tardily, as though\r\nsurprised. Sometimes he only stared. She almost never saw the High\r\nPrairie farm women, busy in their kitchens.\r\n\r\nOn her fifth Sunday in the district she accompanied the Pools to the\r\nmorning service at the Dutch Reformed Church. Maartje seldom had the\r\ntime for such frivolity. But on this morning Klaas hitched up the big\r\nfarm wagon with the double seat and took the family complete\xe2\x80\x94Maartje,\r\nSelina, Roelf, and the pigtails. Maartje, out of her kitchen calico and\r\ndressed in her best black, with a funereal bonnet made sadder by a\r\nsparse and drooping feather whose listless fronds emerged surprisingly\r\nfrom a faded red cotton rose, wore a new strange aspect to Selina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes, as did Klaas in his clumsy sabbaticals. Roelf had rebelled against\r\ngoing, had been cuffed for it, and had sat very still all through the\r\nservice, gazing at the red and yellow glass church window. Later he\r\nconfided to Selina that the sunlight filtering through the crude yellow\r\npanes had imparted a bilious look to the unfortunates seated within its\r\nrange, affording him much secret satisfaction.\r\n\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s appearance had made quite a stir, of which she was entirely\r\nunaware. As the congregation entered by twos and threes she thought they\r\nresembled startlingly a woodcut in an old illustrated book she once had\r\nseen. The men\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday trousers and coats had a square stiff angularity,\r\nas though chopped out of a block. The women, in shawls and bonnets of\r\nrusty black, were incredibly cut in the same pattern. The unmarried\r\ngirls, though, were plump, red-cheeked, and not uncomely, with high\r\nround cheek-bones on which sat a spot of brick-red which imparted no\r\nglow to the face. Their foreheads were prominent and meaningless.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this drab assemblage there entered late and rustlingly a\r\ntall, slow-moving woman in a city-bought cloak and a bonnet quite unlike\r\nthe vintage millinery of High Prairie. As she came down the aisle Selina\r\nthought she was like a full-sailed frigate. An ample woman, with a fine\r\nfair skin and a ripe red mouth; a high firm bosom and great thighs that\r\nmoved rhythmically, slowly. She had thick, insolent eyelids. Her hands,\r\nas she turned the leaves of her hymn book, were smooth and white. As she\r\nentered there was a little rustle throughout the congregation; a craning\r\nof necks. Though she was bustled and flounced and panniered, you\r\nthought, curiously enough, of those lolling white-fleshed and\r\nunconventional ladies whom the sixteenth century painters were always\r\nportraying as having their toe nails cut with nothing on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Selina to Maartje.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWidow Paarlenberg. She is rich like anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d Selina was fascinated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook once how she makes eyes at him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt him? Who? Who?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPervus DeJong. By Gerrit Pon he is sitting with the blue shirt and sad\r\nlooking so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina craned, peered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\xe2\x80\x94oh\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s very good looking, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. Widow Paarlenberg is stuck on him. See how\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x94Sh-sh-sh!\xe2\x80\x94Reverend Dekker looks at us. I tell you after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina decided she\xe2\x80\x99d come to church oftener. The service went on, dull,\r\nheavy. It was in English and Dutch. She heard scarcely a word of it. The\r\nWidow Paarlenberg and this Pervus DeJong occupied her thoughts. She\r\ndecided, without malice, that the widow resembled one of the sleekest of\r\nthe pink porkers rooting in Klaas Pool\xe2\x80\x99s barnyard, waiting to be cut\r\ninto Christmas meat.\r\n\r\nThe Widow Paarlenberg turned and smiled. Her eyes were slippery\r\n(Selina\xe2\x80\x99s term). Her mouth became loose and wide with one corner sliding\r\ndown a trifle into something very like a leer.\r\n\r\nWith one surge the Dutch Reformed congregation leaned forward to see how\r\nPervus DeJong would respond to this public mark of favour. His gaze was\r\nstern, unsmiling. His eyes were fixed on that extremely dull gentleman,\r\nthe Reverend Dekker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s annoyed,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Selina, and was pleased at the thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\r\nmay not be a widow, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s not the way.\xe2\x80\x9d And then: \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\r\nwonder what it\xe2\x80\x99s like when _he_ smiles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccording to fiction as Selina had found it in the _Fireside Companion_\r\nand elsewhere, he should have turned at this moment, irresistibly drawn\r\nby the magnetism of her gaze, and smiled a rare sweet smile that lighted\r\nup his stern young face. But he did not. He yawned suddenly and\r\ncapaciously. The Reformed Dutch congregation leaned back feeling\r\ncheated. Handsome, certainly, Selina reflected. But then, probably Klaas\r\nPool, too, had been handsome a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe service ended, there was much talk of the weather, seedlings, stock,\r\nthe approaching holiday season. Maartje, her Sunday dinner heavy on her\r\nmind, was elbowing her way up the aisle. Here and there she introduced\r\nSelina briefly to a woman friend. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Vander Sijde, meet school\r\nteacher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAggie\xe2\x80\x99s mother?\xe2\x80\x9d Selina would begin, primly, only to be swept along by\r\nMaartje on her way to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Von Mijnen, meet school teacher.\r\nIs Mrs. Von Mijnen.\xe2\x80\x9d They regarded her with a grim gaze. Selina would\r\nsmile and nod rather nervously, feeling young, frivolous, and somehow\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nWhen, with Maartje, she reached the church porch Pervus DeJong was\r\nunhitching the dejected horse that was harnessed to his battered and\r\nlopsided cart. The animal stood with four feet bunched together in a\r\ndrooping and pathetic attitude and seemed inevitably meant for mating\r\nwith this decrepit vehicle. DeJong untied the reins quickly, and was\r\nabout to step into the sagging conveyance when the Widow Paarlenberg\r\nsailed down the church steps with admirable speed for one so amply\r\nproportioned. She made straight for him, skirts billowing, flounces\r\nflying, plumes waving. Maartje clutched Selina\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cLook how she\r\nmakes! She asks him to eat Sunday dinner I bet you! See once how he\r\nmakes with his head no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x94and the whole congregation unashamedly watching\xe2\x80\x94could indeed\r\nsee how he made with his head no. His whole body seemed set in\r\nnegation\xe2\x80\x94the fine head, the broad patient shoulders, the muscular\r\npowerful legs in their ill-fitting Sunday blacks. He shook his head,\r\ngathered up the reins, and drove away, leaving the Widow Paarlenberg to\r\ncarry off with such bravado as she could muster this public flouting in\r\nfull sight of the Dutch Reformed congregation of High Prairie. It must\r\nbe said that she actually achieved this feat with a rather magnificent\r\ncomposure. Her round pink face, as she turned away, was placid; her\r\ngreat cowlike eyes mild. Selina abandoned the pink porker simile for\r\nthat of a great Persian cat, full-fed and treacherous, its claws all\r\nsheathed in velvet. The widow stepped agilely into her own neat phaeton\r\nwith its sleek horse and was off down the hard snowless road, her head\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Selina, feeling as though she had witnessed the first\r\nact of an exciting play. And breathed deeply. So, too, did the watching\r\ncongregation, so that the widow could be said to have driven off in\r\nquite a gust.\r\n\r\nAs they jogged home in the Pool farm wagon Maartje told her tale with a\r\ngood deal of savour.\r\n\r\nPervus DeJong had been left a widower two years before. Within a month\r\nof that time Leendert Paarlenberg had died, leaving to his widow the\r\nrichest and most profitable farm in the whole community. Pervus DeJong,\r\non the contrary, through inheritance from his father, old Johannes,\r\npossessed a scant twenty-five acres of the worst lowland\xe2\x80\x94practically\r\nthe only lowland\xe2\x80\x94in all High Prairie. The acreage was notoriously\r\nbarren. In spring, the critical time for seedlings and early vegetable\r\ncrops, sixteen of the twenty-five were likely to be under water. Pervus\r\nDeJong patiently planted, sowed, gathered crops, hauled them to market;\r\nseemed still never to get on in this thrifty Dutch community where\r\ngetting on was so common a trait as to be no longer thought a virtue.\r\nLuck and nature seemed to work against him. His seedlings proved\r\nunfertile; his stock was always ailing; his cabbages were worm-infested;\r\nsnout-beetle bored his rhubarb. When he planted largely of spinach,\r\nhoping for a wet spring, the season was dry. Did he turn the following\r\nyear to sweet potatoes, all auguries pointing to a dry spring and\r\nsummer, the summer proved the wettest in a decade. Insects and fungi\r\nseemed drawn to his fields as by a malevolent force. Had he been small,\r\npuny, and insignificant his bad luck would have called forth\r\ncontemptuous pity. But there was about him the lovableness and splendour\r\nof the stricken giant. To complete his discomfort, his household was\r\ninadequately ministered by an elderly and rheumatic female connection\r\nwhose pies and bread were the scandal of the neighbouring housewives.\r\n\r\nIt was on this Pervus DeJong, then, that the Widow Paarlenberg of the\r\nrich acres, the comfortable farmhouse, the gold neck chain, the silk\r\ngowns, the soft white hands and the cooking talents, had set her\r\naffections. She wooed him openly, notoriously, and with a Dutch\r\nvehemence that would have swept another man off his feet. It was known\r\nthat she sent him a weekly baking of cakes, pies, and bread. She urged\r\nupon him choice seeds from her thriving fields; seedlings from her\r\nhotbeds; plants, all of which he steadfastly refused. She tricked,\r\ncajoled, or nagged him into eating her ample meals. She even asked his\r\nadvice\xe2\x80\x94that subtlest form of flattery. She asked him about sub-soiling,\r\nhumus, rotation\xe2\x80\x94she whose rich land yielded, under her shrewd\r\nmanagement, more profitably to the single acre than to any ten of\r\nPervus\xe2\x80\x99s. One Jan Bras managed her farm admirably under her supervision.\r\n\r\nDeJong\xe2\x80\x99s was a simple mind. In the beginning, when she said to him, in\r\nher deep, caressing voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. DeJong, could I ask you a little advice\r\nabout something? I\xe2\x80\x99m a woman alone since I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got Leendert any\r\nmore, and strangers what do they care how they run the land! It\xe2\x80\x99s about\r\nmy radishes, lettuce, spinach, and turnips. Last year, instead of\r\ntender, they were stringy and full of fibre on account that Jan Bras.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s for slow growing. Those vegetables you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to grow quick. Bras\r\nsays my fertilizer is the fault, but I know different. What you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJan Bras, getting wind of this, told it abroad with grim humour.\r\nMasculine High Prairie, meeting Pervus DeJong on the road, greeted him\r\nwith: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, DeJong, you been giving the Widow Paarlenberg any good\r\nadvice here lately about growing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had been a particularly bad season for his fields. As High Prairie\r\npoked a sly thumb into his ribs thus he realized that he had been duped\r\nby the wily widow. A slow Dutch wrath rose in him against her; a male\r\nresentment at being manipulated by a woman. When next she approached\r\nhim, cajolery in her voice, seeking guidance about tillage, drainage, or\r\ncrops, he said, bluntly: \xe2\x80\x9cBetter you ask Harm Tien his advice.\xe2\x80\x9d Harm\r\nTien was the district idiot, a poor witless creature of thirty with the\r\nmind of a child.\r\n\r\nKnowing well that the entire community was urging him toward this\r\nprofitable match with the plump, rich, red-lipped widow, Pervus set his\r\nwill like a stubborn steer and would have none of her. He was\r\nuncomfortable in his untidy house; he was lonely, he was unhappy. But he\r\nwould have none of her. Vanity, pride, resentment were all mixed up in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe very first time that Pervus DeJong met Selina he had a chance to\r\nprotect her. With such a start, the end was inevitable. Then, too,\r\nSelina had on the wine-coloured cashmere and was trying hard to keep the\r\ntears back in full view of the whole of High Prairie. Urged by Maartje\r\n(and rather fancying the idea) Selina had attended the great meeting and\r\ndance at Adam Ooms\xe2\x80\x99s hall above the general store near the High Prairie\r\nstation. Farmer families for miles around were there. The new church\r\norgan\xe2\x80\x94that time-hallowed pretext for sociability\xe2\x80\x94was the excuse for\r\nthis gathering. There was a small admission charge. Adam Ooms had given\r\nthem the hall. The three musicians were playing without fee. The women\r\nwere to bring supper packed in boxes or baskets, these to be raffled off\r\nto the highest bidder whose privilege it then was to sup with the fair\r\nwhose basket he had bought. Hot coffee could be had at so much the cup.\r\nAll the proceeds were to be devoted to the organ. It was understood, of\r\ncourse, that there was to be no lively bidding against husbands. Each\r\nfarm woman knew her own basket as she knew the countenance of her\r\nchildren, and each farmer, as that basket came up at auction, named a\r\ncautious sum which automatically made him the basket\xe2\x80\x99s possessor. The\r\nlarger freedom had not come to High Prairie in 1890. The baskets and\r\nboxes of the unwed women were to be the fought-for prizes. Maartje had\r\npacked her own basket at noon and had driven off at four with Klaas and\r\nthe children. She was to serve on one of those bustling committees whose\r\nduties ranged from coffee making to dish washing. Klaas and Roelf were\r\nto be pressed into service. The pigtails would slide up and down the\r\nwaxed floor of Ooms\xe2\x80\x99s hall with other shrieking pigtails of the\r\nneighbourhood until the crowd began to arrive for the auction and\r\nsupper. Jakob Hoogendunk would convey Selina to the festivities when his\r\nchores were done. Selina\xe2\x80\x99s lunch basket was to be a separate and\r\ndistinct affair, offered at auction with those of the Katrinas and Linas\r\nand Sophias of High Prairie. Not a little apprehensive, she was to pack\r\nthis basket herself. Maartje, departing, had left copious but disjointed\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHam . . . them big cookies in the crock . . . pickles . . . watch how\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t spill . . . plum preserves . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaartje\xe2\x80\x99s own basket was of gigantic proportions and staggering content.\r\nHer sandwiches were cubic blocks; her pickles clubs of cucumber; her\r\npies vast plateaus.\r\n\r\nThe basket provided for Selina, while not quite so large, still was of\r\nappalling size as Selina contemplated it. She decided, suddenly, that\r\nshe would have none of it. In her trunk she had a cardboard box such as\r\nshoes come in. Certainly this should hold enough lunch for two, she\r\nthought. She and Julie Hempel had used such boxes for picnic lunches on\r\ntheir Saturday holidays. She was a little nervous about the whole thing;\r\nrather dreaded the prospect of eating her supper with a High Prairie\r\nswain unknown to her. Suppose no one should bid for her box! She\r\nresolved to fill it after her own pattern, disregarding Maartje\xe2\x80\x99s heavy\r\nprovender.\r\n\r\nShe had the kitchen to herself. Jakob was in the fields or out-houses.\r\nThe house was deliciously quiet. Selina rummaged for the shoe box, lined\r\nit with a sheet of tissue paper, rolled up her sleeves, got out mixing\r\nbowl, flour, pans. Cup cakes were her ambition. She baked six of them.\r\nThey came out a beautiful brown but somewhat leaden. Still, anything was\r\nbetter than a wedge of soggy pie, she told herself. She boiled eggs very\r\nhard, halved them, devilled their yolks, filled the whites neatly with\r\nthis mixture and clapped the halves together again, skewering them with\r\na toothpick. Then she rolled each egg separately in tissue paper twisted\r\nat the ends. Daintiness, she had decided, should be the keynote of her\r\nsupper box. She cut bread paper-thin and made jelly sandwiches, scorning\r\nthe ubiquitous pork. Bananas, she knew, belonged in a lunch box, but\r\nthese were unobtainable. She substituted two juicy pippins, polished\r\nuntil their cheeks glittered. The food neatly packed she wrapped the box\r\nin paper and tied it with a gay red ribbon yielded by her trunk. At the\r\nlast moment she whipped into the yard, twisted a brush of evergreen from\r\nthe tree at the side of the house, and tucked this into the knot of\r\nribbon atop the box. She stepped back and thought the effect enchanting.\r\n\r\nShe was waiting in her red cashmere and her cloak and hood when\r\nHoogendunk called for her. They were late arrivals, for outside Ooms\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhall were hitched all manner of vehicles. There had been a heavy\r\nsnowfall two days before. This had brought out bob-sleds, cutters,\r\nsleighs. The horse sheds were not large enough to shelter all. Late\r\ncomers had to hitch where they could. There was a great jangling of\r\nbells as the horses stamped in the snow.\r\n\r\nSelina, balancing her box carefully, opened the door that led to the\r\nwooden stairway. The hall was on the second floor. The clamour that\r\nstruck her ears had the effect of a physical blow. She hesitated a\r\nmoment, and if there had been any means of returning to the Pool farm,\r\nshort of walking five miles in the snow, she would have taken it. Up the\r\nstairs and into the din. Evidently the auctioning of supper baskets was\r\neven now in progress. The roar of voices had broken out after the sale\r\nof a basket and now was subsiding under the ear-splitting cracks of the\r\nauctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s hammer. Through the crowded doorway Selina could catch a\r\nglimpse of him as he stood on a chair, the baskets piled before him. He\r\nused a barrel elevated on a box as his pulpit. The auctioneer was Adam\r\nOoms who himself had once been the High Prairie school teacher. A\r\nfox-faced little man, bald, falsetto, the village clown with a solid\r\nfoundation of shrewdness under his clowning and a tart layer of malice\r\nover it.\r\n\r\nHigh and shrill came his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I bid! What am I bid! Thirty\r\ncents! Thirty-five! Shame on you, gentlemen. What am I bid! Who\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nit forty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina felt a little thrill of excitement. She looked about for a place\r\non which to lay her wraps. Every table, chair, hook, and rack in the\r\nhallway was piled with clothing. She espied a box that appeared empty,\r\nrolled her cloak, muffler, and hood into a neat bundle and, about to\r\ncast it into the box, saw, upturned to her from its depths, the round\r\npink faces of the sleeping Kuyper twins, aged six months. From the big\r\nhall now came a great shouting, clapping of hands, stamping, cat-calls.\r\nAnother basket had been disposed of. Oh, dear! In desperation Selina\r\nplaced her bundle on the floor in a corner, smoothed down the red\r\ncashmere, snatched up her lunch box and made for the doorway with the\r\nchildish eagerness of one out of the crowd to be in it. She wondered\r\nwhere Maartje and Klaas Pool were in this close-packed roomful; and\r\nRoelf. In the doorway she found that broad black-coated backs shut off\r\nsight and ingress. She had written her name neatly on her lunch box. Now\r\nshe was at a loss to find a way to reach Adam Ooms. She eyed the\r\ngreat-shouldered expanse just ahead of her. In desperation she decided\r\nto dig into it with a corner of her box. She dug, viciously. The back\r\nwinced. Its owner turned. \xe2\x80\x9cHere! What\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina looked up into the wrathful face of Pervus DeJong. Pervus DeJong\r\nlooked down into the startled eyes of Selina Peake. Large enough eyes at\r\nany time; enormous now in her fright at what she had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry! I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94sorry. I thought if I could\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no way of getting\r\nmy lunch box up there\xe2\x80\x94such a crowd\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slim, appealing, lovely little figure in the wine-red cashmere, amidst\r\nall those buxom bosoms, and overheated bodies, and flushed faces. His\r\ngaze left her reluctantly, settled on the lunch box, became, if\r\npossible, more bewildered. \xe2\x80\x9cThat? Lunch box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. For the raffle. I\xe2\x80\x99m the school teacher. Selina Peake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw you in church Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you. . . . Did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back. Wait here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the shoe box. She waited. He ploughed his way through the crowd\r\nlike a Juggernaut, reached Adam Ooms\xe2\x80\x99s platform and placed the box\r\ninconspicuously next a colossal hamper that was one of a dozen grouped\r\nawaiting Adam\xe2\x80\x99s attention. When he had made his way back to Selina he\r\nagain said, \xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d and plunged down the wooden stairway. Selina waited.\r\nShe had ceased to feel distressed at her inability to find the Pools in\r\nthe crowd, a-tiptoe though she was. When presently he came back he had\r\nin his hand an empty wooden soap-box. This he up-ended in the doorway\r\njust behind the crowd stationed there. Selina mounted it; found her head\r\na little above the level of his. She could survey the room from end to\r\nend. There were the Pools. She waved to Maartje; smiled at Roelf. He\r\nmade as though to come toward her; did come part way, and was restrained\r\nby Maartje catching at his coat tail.\r\n\r\nSelina wished she could think of something to say. She looked down at\r\nPervus DeJong. The back of his neck was pink, as though with effort. She\r\nthought, instinctively, \xe2\x80\x9cMy goodness, he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to think of something\r\nto say, too.\xe2\x80\x9d That, somehow, put her at her ease. She would wait until\r\nhe spoke. His neck was now a deep red. The crowd surged back at some\r\ndisturbance around Adam Ooms\xe2\x80\x99s elevation. Selina teetered perilously on\r\nher box, put out a hand blindly, felt his great hard hand on her arm,\r\nsteadying her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite a crowd, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d The effort had reached its apex. The red of\r\nhis neck began to recede.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quite!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t all High Prairie. Some of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x99s from Low Prairie way. New\r\nHaarlem, even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pause. Another effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow goes it school teaching?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94it goes pretty well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are little to be school teacher, anyway, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle!\xe2\x80\x9d She drew herself up from her vantage point of the soap-box.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m bigger than you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laughed at that as at an exquisite piece of repartee.\r\n\r\nAdam Oom\xe2\x80\x99s gavel (a wooden potato masher) crashed for silence. \xe2\x80\x9cLadies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n[Crash!] \xe2\x80\x9cAnd gents!\xe2\x80\x9d [Crash!] \xe2\x80\x9cGents! Look what basket we\xe2\x80\x99ve got here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLook indeed. A great hamper, grown so plethoric that it could no longer\r\nwear its cover. Its contents bellied into a mound smoothly covered with\r\na fine white cloth whose glistening surface proclaimed it damask. A\r\nHimalaya among hampers. You knew that under that snowy crust lay gold\r\nthat was fowl done crisply, succulently; emeralds in the form of\r\ngherkins; rubies that melted into strawberry preserves; cakes frosted\r\nlike diamonds; to say nothing of such semi-precious jewels as potato\r\nsalad; cheeses; sour cream to be spread on rye bread and butter; coffee\r\ncakes; crullers.\r\n\r\nCrash! \xe2\x80\x9cThe Widow Paarlenberg\xe2\x80\x99s basket, ladies\xe2\x80\x94_and_ gents! The Widow\r\nPaarlenberg! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s in it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s in it. We\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have to know what\xe2\x80\x99s in it. Who has eaten Widow Paarlenberg\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchicken once don\xe2\x80\x99t have to know. Who has eaten Widow Paarlenberg\xe2\x80\x99s cake\r\nonce don\xe2\x80\x99t have to know. What am I bid on Widow Paarlenberg\xe2\x80\x99s basket!\r\nWhat am I bid! WhatmIbidwhatmIbidwhatmIbid!\xe2\x80\x9d [Crash!]\r\n\r\nThe widow herself, very handsome in black silk, her gold neck chain\r\nrising and falling richly with the little flurry that now agitated her\r\nbroad bosom, was seated in a chair against the wall not five feet from\r\nthe auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s stand. She bridled now, blushed, cast down her eyes,\r\ncast up her eyes, succeeded in looking as unconscious as a complaisant\r\nTurkish slave girl on the block.\r\n\r\nAdam Ooms\xe2\x80\x99s glance swept the hall. He leaned forward, his fox-like face\r\nfixed in a smile. From the widow herself, seated so prominently at his\r\nright, his gaze marked the young blades of the village; the old bucks;\r\nyouths and widowers and bachelors. Here was the prize of the evening.\r\nAround, in a semi-circle, went his keen glance until it reached the tall\r\nfigure towering in the doorway\xe2\x80\x94reached it, and rested there. His gimlet\r\neyes seemed to bore their way into Pervus DeJong\xe2\x80\x99s steady stare. He\r\nraised his right arm aloft, brandishing the potato masher. The whole\r\nroom fixed its gaze on the blond head in the doorway. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak up! Young\r\nmen of High Prairie! Heh, you, Pervus DeJong!\r\nWhatmIbidwhatmIbidwhatmIbid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifty cents!\xe2\x80\x9d The bid came from Gerrit Pon at the other end of the\r\nhall. A dashing offer, as a start, in this district where one dollar\r\noften represented the profits on a whole load of market truck brought to\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nCrash! went the potato masher. \xe2\x80\x9cFifty cents I\xe2\x80\x99m bid. Who\xe2\x80\x99ll make it\r\nseventy-five? Who\xe2\x80\x99ll make it seventy-five?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixty!\xe2\x80\x9d Johannes Ambuul, a widower, his age more than the sum of his\r\nbid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventy!\xe2\x80\x9d Gerrit Pon.\r\n\r\nAdam Ooms whispered it\xe2\x80\x94hissed it. \xe2\x80\x9cS-s-s-seventy. Ladies and gents, I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t repeat out loud sucha figger. I would be ashamed. Look at this\r\nbasket, gents, and then you can say . . . s-s-seventy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventy-five!\xe2\x80\x9d the cautious Ambuul.\r\n\r\nScarlet, flooding her face, belied the widow\xe2\x80\x99s outward air of composure.\r\nPervus DeJong, standing beside Selina, viewed the proceedings with an\r\nair of detachment. High Prairie was looking at him expectantly, openly.\r\nThe widow bit her red lip, tossed her head. Pervus DeJong returned the\r\nauctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s meaning smirk with the mild gaze of a disinterested\r\noutsider. High Prairie, Low Prairie, and New Haarlem sat tense, like an\r\naudience at a play. Here, indeed, was drama being enacted in a community\r\nwhose thrills were all too rare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGents!\xe2\x80\x9d Adam Ooms\xe2\x80\x99s voice took on a tearful note\xe2\x80\x94the tone of one who\r\nis more hurt than angry. \xe2\x80\x9cGents!\xe2\x80\x9d Slowly, with infinite reverence, he\r\nlifted one corner of the damask cloth that concealed the hamper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncontents\xe2\x80\x94lifted it and peered within as at a treasure. At what he saw\r\nthere he started back dramatically, at once rapturous, despairing,\r\namazed. He rolled his eyes. He smacked his lips. He rubbed his stomach.\r\nThe sort of dumb show that, since the days of the Greek drama, has been\r\nused to denote gastronomic delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighty!\xe2\x80\x9d was wrenched suddenly from Goris Von Vuuren, the\r\nnineteen-year-old fat and gluttonous son of a prosperous New Haarlem\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nAdam Ooms rubbed brisk palms together. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then! A dollar! A dollar!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an insult to this basket to make it less than a dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d He lifted\r\nthe cover again, sniffed, appeared overcome. \xe2\x80\x9cGents, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for\r\nMrs. Ooms sitting there I\xe2\x80\x99d make it a dollar myself and a bargain. A\r\ndollar! Am I bid a dollar!\xe2\x80\x9d He leaned far forward over his improvised\r\npulpit. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I hear you say a dollar, Pervus DeJong?\xe2\x80\x9d DeJong stared,\r\nimmovable, unabashed. His very indifference was contagious. The widow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbountiful basket seemed to shrink before one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighty-eighty-eighty-eighty\xe2\x80\x94gents! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you something.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to whisper a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d His lean face was veined with\r\ncraftiness. \xe2\x80\x9cGents. Listen. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t chicken in this beautiful basket.\r\nIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t chicken. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a dramatic pause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s _roast duck!_\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nswayed back, mopped his brow with his red handkerchief, held one hand\r\nhigh in the air. His last card.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighty-five!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned the fat Goris Von Vuuren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighty-five! Eighty-five! Eightyfiveeightyfiveeightyfive eighty-five!\r\nGents! Gen-tle-men! Eighty-five once! Eighty-five\xe2\x80\x94twice!\xe2\x80\x9d [Crash!]\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone to Goris Von Vuuren for eighty-five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sigh went up from the assemblage; a sigh that was the wind before the\r\nstorm. There followed a tornado of talk. It crackled and thundered. The\r\nrich Widow Paarlenberg would have to eat her supper with Von Vuuren\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboy, the great thick Goris. And there in the doorway, talking to teacher\r\nas if they had known each other for years, was Pervus DeJong with his\r\nmoney in his pocket. It was as good as a play.\r\n\r\nAdam Ooms was angry. His lean, fox-like face became pinched with spite.\r\nHe prided himself on his antics as auctioneer; and his chef d\xe2\x80\x99\xc5\x93uvre had\r\nbrought a meagre eighty-five cents, besides doubtless winning him the\r\nenmity of that profitable store customer, the Widow Paarlenberg. Goris\r\nVon Vuuren came forward to claim his prize amidst shouting, clapping,\r\nlaughter. The great hamper was handed down to him; an ample,\r\nrich-looking burden, its handle folded comfortably over its round\r\nstomach, its white cover so glistening with starch and ironing that it\r\ngave back the light from the big lamp above the auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s stand. As\r\nGoris Von Vuuren lifted it his great shoulders actually sagged. Its\r\ncontents promised satiety even to such a feeder as he. A grin, half\r\nsheepish, half triumphant, creased his plump pink face.\r\n\r\nAdam Ooms scuffled about among the many baskets at his feet. His\r\nnostrils looked pinched and his skinny hands shook a little as he\r\nsearched for one small object.\r\n\r\nWhen he stood upright once more he was smiling. His little eyes gleamed.\r\nHis wooden sceptre pounded for silence. High in one hand, balanced\r\ndaintily on his finger tips, he held Selina\xe2\x80\x99s little white shoe box,\r\nwith its red ribbon binding it, and the plume of evergreen stuck in the\r\nribbon. Affecting great solicitude he brought it down then to read the\r\nname written on it; held it aloft again, smirking.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing. Grinning, he held it high. He turned his body at the\r\nwaist from side to side, so that all might see. The eyes of those before\r\nhim still held a mental picture of the huge hamper, food-packed, that\r\nhad just been handed down. The contrast was too absurd, too cruel. A\r\nripple of laughter swept the room; rose; swelled to a roar. Adam Ooms\r\ndrew his mouth down solemnly. His little finger elegantly crooked, he\r\npendulumed the box to right and left. He swerved his beady eyes from\r\nside to side. He waited with a nice sense of the dramatic until the\r\nlaughter had reached its height, then held up a hand for silence. A\r\ngreat scraping \xe2\x80\x9cAhem!\xe2\x80\x9d as he cleared his throat threatened to send the\r\ncrowd off again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies\xe2\x80\x94_and_ gents! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a dainty little tidbit. Here\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nnot only for the inner man, but a feast for the eye. Well, boys, if the\r\nlast lot was too much for you this lot ought to be just about right. If\r\nthe food ain\xe2\x80\x99t quite enough for you, you can tie the ribbon in the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s hair and put the posy in your buttonhole and there you are.\r\n_There_ you are! What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the lady herself goes with it. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget a country girl with this here box, gents. A city girl, you can tell\r\nby looking at it, just. And who is she? Who did up this dainty little\r\nbox just big enough for two?\xe2\x80\x9d He inspected it again, solemnly, and\r\nadded, as an after-thought, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you ain\xe2\x80\x99t feeling specially hungry.\r\nWho?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He looked about, apishly.\r\n\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks matched her gown. Her eyes were wide and dark with the\r\neffort she was making to force back the hot haze threatening them. Why\r\nhad she mounted this wretched soap-box! Why had she come to this hideous\r\nparty! Why had she come to High Prairie! Why! . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Selina Peake, that\xe2\x80\x99s who. Miss Se-li-na Peake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA hundred balloon faces pulled by a single cord turned toward her as she\r\nstood there on the box for all to see. They swam toward her. She put up\r\na hand to push them back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99m I bid! What\xe2\x80\x99m I bid! What\xe2\x80\x99m I bid for this here lovely little\r\ntoothful, gents! Start her up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive cents!\xe2\x80\x9d piped up old Johannes Ambuul, with a snicker. The\r\ntittering crowd broke into a guffaw. Selina was conscious of a little\r\nsick feeling at the pit of her stomach. Through the haze she saw the\r\nwidow\xe2\x80\x99s face, no longer sulky, but smiling now. She saw Roelf\xe2\x80\x99s dear\r\ndark head. His face was set, like a man\xe2\x80\x99s. He was coming toward her, or\r\ntrying to, but the crowd wedged him in, small as he was among those\r\ngreat bodies. She lost sight of him. How hot it was! how hot . . . An\r\narm at her waist. Some one had mounted the little box and stood\r\nteetering there beside her, pressed against her slightly, reassuringly.\r\nPervus DeJong. Her head was on a level with his great shoulder now. They\r\nstood together in the doorway, on the soap-box, for all High Prairie to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive cents I\xe2\x80\x99m bid for this lovely little mouthful put up by the school\r\nteacher\xe2\x80\x99s own fair hands. Five cents! Five\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne dollar!\xe2\x80\x9d Pervus DeJong.\r\n\r\nThe balloon faces were suddenly punctured with holes. High Prairie\xe2\x80\x99s jaw\r\ndropped with astonishment. Its mouth stood open.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing plain about Selina now. Her dark head was held high,\r\nand his fair one beside it made a vivid foil. The purchase of the\r\nwine-coloured cashmere was at last justified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ten!\xe2\x80\x9d cackled old Johannes Ambuul, his rheumy eyes on Selina.\r\n\r\nArt and human spitefulness struggled visibly for mastery in Adam Ooms\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface\xe2\x80\x94and art won. The auctioneer triumphed over the man. The term\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccrowd psychology\xe2\x80\x9d was unknown to him, but he was artist enough to sense\r\nthat some curious magic process, working through this roomful of people,\r\nhad transformed the little white box, from a thing despised and\r\nridiculed, into an object of beauty, of value, of infinite desirability.\r\nHe now eyed it in a catalepsy of admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne-ten I\xe2\x80\x99m bid for this box all tied with a ribbon to match the gown\r\nof the girl who brought it. Gents, you get the ribbon, the lunch, _and_\r\nthe girl. And only one-ten bid for all that. Gents! Gents! Remember, it\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t only a lunch\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a picture. It pleases the eye. Do I hear\r\none\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive bits!\xe2\x80\x9d Barend DeRoo, of Low Prairie, in the lists. A strapping\r\nyoung Dutchman, the Brom Bones of the district. Aaltje Huff, in a fit of\r\npique at his indifference, had married to spite him. Cornelia Vinke,\r\nbelle of New Haarlem, was said to be languishing for love of him. He\r\ndrove to the Haymarket with his load of produce and played cards all\r\nnight on the wagon under the gas torches while the street girls of the\r\nneighbourhood assailed him in vain. Six feet three, his red face shone\r\nnow like a harvest moon above the crowd. A merry, mischievous eye that\r\nlaughed at Pervus DeJong and his dollar bid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDollar and a half!\xe2\x80\x9d A high clear voice\xe2\x80\x94a boy\xe2\x80\x99s voice. Roelf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina aloud. But she was unheard in the gabble. Roelf\r\nhad once confided to her that he had saved three dollars and fifty cents\r\nin the last three years. Five dollars would purchase a set of tools that\r\nhis mind had been fixed on for months past. Selina saw Klaas Pool\xe2\x80\x99s look\r\nof astonishment changing to anger. Saw Maartje Pool\xe2\x80\x99s quick hand on his\r\narm, restraining him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo dollars!\xe2\x80\x9d Pervus DeJong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwotwotwotwotwotwo!\xe2\x80\x9d Adam Ooms in a frenzy of salesmanship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ten.\xe2\x80\x9d Johannes Ambuul\xe2\x80\x99s cautious bid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo and a quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d Barend DeRoo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo-fifty!\xe2\x80\x9d Pervus DeJong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree dollars!\xe2\x80\x9d The high voice of the boy. It cracked a little on the\r\nlast syllable, and the crowd laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree-three-three-three-threethreethree. Three once\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a half.\xe2\x80\x9d Pervus DeJong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree sixty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour!\xe2\x80\x9d DeRoo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish they\xe2\x80\x99d stop,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Selina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive!\xe2\x80\x9d Pervus DeJong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix!\xe2\x80\x9d DeRoo, his face very red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only jelly sandwiches,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina to DeJong, in a panic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight!\xe2\x80\x9d Johannes Ambuul, gone mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine!\xe2\x80\x9d DeRoo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine!

Don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pervus DeJong.\r\n\r\nBarend DeRoo shrugged his great shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen-ten-ten. Do I hear eleven? Do I hear ten-fifty! Ten-ten-ten\r\ntententententententen! Gents! Ten once. Ten twice! Gone!\xe2\x80\x94for ten\r\ndollars to Pervus DeJong. And a bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d Adam Ooms mopped his bald head\r\nand his cheeks and the damp spot under his chin.\r\n\r\nTen dollars. Adam Ooms knew, as did all the countryside, this was not\r\nthe sum of ten dollars merely. No basket of food, though it contained\r\nnightingales\xe2\x80\x99 tongues, the golden apple of Atalanta, wines of rare\r\nvintage, could have been adequate recompense for these ten dollars. They\r\nrepresented sweat and blood; toil and hardship; hours under the burning\r\nprairie sun at mid-day; work doggedly carried on through the drenching\r\nshowers of spring; nights of restless sleep snatched an hour at a time\r\nunder the sky in the Chicago market place; miles of weary travel down\r\nthe rude corduroy road between High Prairie and Chicago, now up to the\r\nhubs in mud, now blinded by dust and blowing sand.\r\n\r\nA sale at Christie\xe2\x80\x99s, with a miniature going for a million, could not\r\nhave met with a deeper hush, a more dramatic babble following the hush.\r\n\r\nThey ate their lunch together in one corner of Adam Ooms\xe2\x80\x99s hall. Selina\r\nopened the box and took out the devilled eggs, and the cup cakes that\r\nhad fallen a little, and the apples, and the sandwiches sliced very,\r\nvery thin. The coldly appraising eye of all High Prairie, Low Prairie,\r\nand New Haarlem watched this sparse provender emerge from the\r\nribbon-tied shoe box. She offered him a sandwich. It looked\r\ninfinitesimal in his great paw. Suddenly all Selina\xe2\x80\x99s agony of\r\nembarrassment was swept away, and she was laughing, not wildly or\r\nhysterically, but joyously and girlishly. She sank her little white\r\nteeth into one of the absurd sandwiches and looked at him, expecting to\r\nfind him laughing, too. But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t laughing. He looked very earnest,\r\nand his blue eyes were fixed hard on the bit of bread in his hand, and\r\nhis face was very red and clean-shaven. He bit into the sandwich and\r\nchewed it solemnly. And Selina thought: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the dear thing! The great\r\nbig dear thing! And he might have been eating breast of duck . . . Ten\r\ndollars!\xe2\x80\x9d Aloud she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, \xe2\x80\x9cYou looked so little. And they were\r\nmaking fun. Laughing.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked very earnest, and his blue eyes were\r\nfixed hard on the sandwich, and his face was very red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very foolish reason for throwing away ten dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina\r\nsaid, severely.\r\n\r\nHe seemed not to hear her; bit ruminantly into one of the cup cakes.\r\nSuddenly: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t hardly write at all, only to sign my name and like\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly to spell out the words. Anyways I don\xe2\x80\x99t get time for reading. But\r\nfiguring I wish I knew. \xe2\x80\x99Rithmetic. I can figger some, but those fellows\r\nin Haymarket they are too sharp for me. They do numbers in their\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x94like that, so quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina leaned toward him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean, teach me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvenings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked down at his great calloused palms, then up at her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would\r\nyou take for pay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPay! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any pay.\xe2\x80\x9d She was genuinely shocked.\r\n\r\nHis face lighted up with a sudden thought. \xe2\x80\x9cTell you what. My place is\r\njust this side the school, next to Bouts\xe2\x80\x99s place. I could start for you\r\nthe fire, mornings, in the school. And thaw the pump and bring in a pail\r\nof water. This month, and January and February and part of March, even,\r\nnow I don\xe2\x80\x99t go to market on account it\xe2\x80\x99s winter, I could start you the\r\nfire. Till spring. And I could come maybe three times a week, evenings,\r\nto Pool\xe2\x80\x99s place, for lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked so helpless, so humble, so\r\nhuge; and the more pathetic for his hugeness.\r\n\r\nShe felt a little rush of warmth toward him that was at once impersonal\r\nand maternal. She thought again, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the dear thing! The great\r\nhelpless big thing! How serious he is! And funny.\xe2\x80\x9d He was indeed both\r\nserious and funny, with the ridiculous cup cake in his great hand, his\r\neyes wide and ruminant, his face ruddier than ever, his forehead knotted\r\nwith earnestness. She laughed, suddenly, a gay little laugh, and he,\r\nafter a puzzled pause, joined her companionably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree evenings a week,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Selina, then, from the depths of her\r\nignorance. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to. I\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x94love to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evenings turned out to be Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Supper\r\nwas over by six-thirty in the Pool household. Pervus was there by seven,\r\nvery clean as to shirt, his hair brushed till it shone; shy, and given\r\nto dropping his hat and bumping against chairs, and looking solemn.\r\nSelina was torn between pity and mirth. If only he had blustered. A\r\nblustering big man puts the world on the defensive. A gentle giant\r\ndisarms it.\r\n\r\nSelina got out her McBride\xe2\x80\x99s Grammar and Duffy\xe2\x80\x99s Arithmetic, and\r\ntogether they started to parse verbs, paper walls, dig cisterns, and\r\nextract square roots. They found study impossible at the\r\noilcloth-covered kitchen table, with the Pool household eddying about\r\nit. Jakob built a fire in the parlour stove and there they sat, teacher\r\nand pupil, their feet resting cosily on the gleaming nickel railing that\r\nencircled the wood burner.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the first lesson Roelf had glowered throughout supper\r\nand had disappeared into the work-shed, whence issued a great sound of\r\nhammering, sawing, and general clatter. He and Selina had got into the\r\nway of spending much time together, in or out of doors. They skated on\r\nVander Sijde\xe2\x80\x99s pond; together with the shrieking pigtails they coasted\r\non the little slope that led down from Kuyper\xe2\x80\x99s woods to the main road,\r\nusing sleds that had been put together by Roelf. On bad days they read\r\nor studied. Not Sundays merely, but many week-day evenings were spent\r\nthus. Selina was determined that Roelf should break away from the\r\nuncouth speech of the countryside; that he should at least share with\r\nher the somewhat sketchy knowledge gained at Miss Fister\xe2\x80\x99s select\r\nschool. She, the woman of almost twenty, never talked down to this boy\r\nof twelve. The boy worshipped her inarticulately. She had early\r\ndiscovered that he had a feeling for beauty\xe2\x80\x94beauty of line, texture,\r\ncolour, and grouping\xe2\x80\x94that was rare in one of his years. The feel of a\r\nsatin ribbon in his fingers; the orange and rose of a sunset; the folds\r\nof the wine-red cashmere dress; the cadence of a spoken line, brought a\r\nlook to his face that startled her. She had a battered volume of\r\nTennyson. When first she read him the line beginning, \xe2\x80\x9cElaine the fair,\r\nElaine the lovable, Elaine, the lily maid of Astolat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he had uttered\r\na little exclamation. She, glancing up from her book, had found his eyes\r\nwide, bright, and luminous in his lean dark face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Roelf?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing\xe2\x80\x94anything. Start over again how it\r\ngoes, \xe2\x80\x98Elaine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had begun again the fragrant lines, \xe2\x80\x9cElaine the fair, Elaine the\r\nlovable . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSince the gathering at Ooms\xe2\x80\x99s hall he had been moody and sullen; had\r\nrefused to answer when she spoke to him of his bid for her basket.\r\nUrged, he would only say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was just fun to make old Ooms mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, with the advent of Pervus DeJong, Roelf presented that most\r\ntouching and miserable of spectacles, a small boy jealous and helpless\r\nin his jealousy. Selina had asked him to join the tri-weekly evening\r\nlessons; had, indeed, insisted that he be a pupil in the class round the\r\nparlour stove. Maartje had said, on the night of Pervus DeJong\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nvisit, \xe2\x80\x9cRoelf, you sit, too, and learn. Is good for you to learn out of\r\nbooks the way teacher says.\xe2\x80\x9d Klaas Pool, too, had approved the plan,\r\nsince it would cost nothing and, furthermore, would in no way interfere\r\nwith Roelf\xe2\x80\x99s farm work. \xe2\x80\x9cSure; learn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a large gesture.\r\n\r\nRoelf would not. He behaved very badly; slammed doors, whistled,\r\nscuffled on the kitchen floor, made many mysterious trips through the\r\nparlour up the stairs that led off that room, ascending with a clatter;\r\nincited Geertje and Jozina to quarrels and tears; had the household in a\r\nhubbub; stumbled over Dunder, the dog, so that that anguished animal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyelps were added to the din.\r\n\r\nSelina was frantic. Lessons were impossible amidst this uproar. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has\r\nnever been like this before,\xe2\x80\x9d she assured Pervus, almost tearfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter. It\xe2\x80\x99s awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPervus had looked up from his slate. His eyes were calm, his lips\r\nsmiling. \xe2\x80\x9cIs all right. In my house is too still, evenings. Next time it\r\ngoes better. You see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext time it did go better. Roelf disappeared into his work-shed after\r\nsupper; did not emerge until after DeJong\xe2\x80\x99s departure.\r\n\r\nThere was something about the sight of this great creature bent\r\nlaboriously over a slate, the pencil held clumsily in his huge fingers,\r\nthat moved Selina strangely. Pity wracked her. If she had known to what\r\nemotion this pity was akin she might have taken away the slate and given\r\nhim a tablet, and the whole course of her life would have been\r\ndifferent. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor lad,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor lad.\xe2\x80\x9d Chided herself for being\r\namused at his childlike earnestness.\r\n\r\nHe did not make an apt pupil, though painstaking. Usually the top\r\ndraught of the stove was open, and the glow of the fire imparted to his\r\nface and head a certain roseate glory. He was very grave. His brow wore\r\na troubled frown. Selina would go over a problem or a sentence again and\r\nagain, patiently, patiently. Then, suddenly, like a hand passed over his\r\nface, his smile would come, transforming it. He had white strong teeth,\r\ntoo small, and perhaps not so white as they seemed because of his russet\r\nblondeur. He would smile like a child, and Selina should have been\r\nwarned by the warm rush of joy that his smile gave her. She would smile,\r\ntoo. He was as pleased as though he had made a fresh and wonderful\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you know it once.\xe2\x80\x9d Like a boy.\r\n\r\nHe usually went home by eight-thirty or nine. Often the Pools went to\r\nbed before he left. After he had gone Selina was wakeful. She would heat\r\nwater and wash; brush her hair vigorously; feeling at once buoyant and\r\ndepressed.\r\n\r\nSometimes they fell to talking. His wife had died in the second year of\r\ntheir marriage, when the child was born. The child, too, had died. A\r\ngirl. He was unlucky, like that. It was the same with the farm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpring, half of the land is under water. My piece, just. Bouts\xe2\x80\x99s place,\r\nnext to me, is high and rich. Bouts, he don\xe2\x80\x99t even need deep ploughing.\r\nHis land is quick land. It warms up in the spring early. After rain it\r\nworks easy. He puts in fertilizer, any kind, and his plants jump, like.\r\nMy place is bad for garden truck. Wet. All the time, wet; or in summer\r\nbaked before I can loosen it again. Muckland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina thought a moment. She had heard much talk between Klaas and\r\nJakob, winter evenings. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you do something to it\xe2\x80\x94fix it\xe2\x80\x94so that\r\nthe water will run off? Raise it, or dig a ditch or something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe-e-ell, maybe. Maybe you could. But it costs money, draining.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt costs money not to, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe considered this, ruminatively. \xe2\x80\x9cGuess it does. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to\r\nhave ready cash to let the land lay. To drain it you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina shook her head impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very foolish, short-sighted\r\nway to reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked helpless as only the strong and powerful can look. Selina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart melted in pity. He would look down at the great calloused hands;\r\nup at her. One of the charms of Pervus DeJong lay in the things that his\r\neyes said and his tongue did not. Women always imagined he was about to\r\nsay what he looked, but he never did. It made otherwise dull\r\nconversation with him most exciting.\r\n\r\nHis was in no way a shrewd mind. His respect for Selina was almost\r\nreverence. But he had this advantage: he had married a woman, had lived\r\nwith her for two years. She had borne him a child. Selina was a girl in\r\nexperience. She was a woman capable of a great deal of passion, but she\r\ndid not know that. Passion was a thing no woman possessed, much less\r\ntalked about. It simply did not exist, except in men, and then was\r\nsomething to be ashamed of, like a violent temper, or a weak stomach.\r\n\r\nBy the first of March he could speak a slow, careful, and fairly\r\ngrammatical English. He could master simple sums. By the middle of March\r\nthe lessons would cease. There was too much work to do about the\r\nfarm\xe2\x80\x94night work as well as day. She found herself trying not to think\r\nabout the time when the lessons should cease. She refused to look ahead\r\nto April.\r\n\r\nOne night, late in February, Selina was conscious that she was trying to\r\ncontrol something. She was trying to keep her eyes away from something.\r\nShe realized that she was trying not to look at his hands. She wanted,\r\ncrazily, to touch them. She wanted to feel them about her throat. She\r\nwanted to put her lips on his hands\xe2\x80\x94brush the backs of them, slowly,\r\nmoistly, with her mouth, lingeringly. She was terribly frightened. She\r\nthought to herself: \xe2\x80\x9cI am going crazy. I am losing my mind. There is\r\nsomething the matter with me. I wonder how I look. I must look queer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said something to make him look up at her. His glance was mild,\r\nundismayed. So this hideous thing did not show in her face. She kept her\r\neyes resolutely on the book. At half-past eight she closed her book\r\nsuddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m tired. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the spring coming on.\xe2\x80\x9d She smiled a\r\nlittle wavering smile. He rose and stretched himself, his great arms\r\nhigh above his head. Selina shivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo more weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis the last lesson. Well, do you think I\r\nhave done pretty good\xe2\x80\x94well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina replied, evenly. She felt very tired.\r\n\r\nThe first week in March he was ill, and did not come. A rheumatic\r\naffliction to which he was subject. His father, old Johannes DeJong, had\r\nhad it before him. Working in the wet fields did it, they said. It was\r\nthe curse of the truck farmer. Selina\xe2\x80\x99s evenings were free to devote to\r\nRoelf, who glowed again. She sewed, too; read; helped Mrs. Pool with the\r\nhousework in a gust of sympathy and found strange relief therein; made\r\nover an old dress; studied; wrote all her letters (few enough), even one\r\nto the dried-apple aunts in Vermont. She no longer wrote to Julie\r\nHempel. She had heard that Julie was to be married to a Kansas man named\r\nArnold. Julie herself had not written. The first week in March passed.\r\nHe did not come. Nor did he come the following Tuesday or Thursday.\r\nAfter a terrific battle with herself Selina, after school on Thursday,\r\nwalked past his house, busily, as though bent on an errand. Despised\r\nherself for doing it, could not help herself, found a horrible and\r\ntortuous satisfaction in not looking at the house as she passed it.\r\n\r\nShe was bewildered, frightened. All that week she had a curious\r\nfeeling\xe2\x80\x94or succession of feelings. There was the sensation of\r\nsuffocation followed by that of emptiness\xe2\x80\x94of being\r\nhollow\xe2\x80\x94boneless\xe2\x80\x94bloodless. Then, at times, there was a feeling of\r\nphysical pain; at others a sense of being disembowelled. She was\r\nrestless, listless, by turns. Period of furious activity followed by\r\ndays of inertia. It was the spring, Maartje said. Selina hoped she\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be ill. She had never felt like that before. She wanted\r\nto cry. She was irritable to the point of waspishness with the children\r\nin the schoolroom.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday\xe2\x80\x94the fourteenth of March\xe2\x80\x94he walked in at seven. Klaas,\r\nMaartje, and Roelf had driven off to a gathering at Low Prairie, leaving\r\nSelina with the pigtails and old Jakob. She had promised to make taffy\r\nfor them, and was in the midst of it when his knock sounded at the\r\nkitchen door. All the blood in her body rushed to her head; pounded\r\nthere hotly. He entered. There slipped down over her a complete armour\r\nof calmness, of self-possession; of glib how do you do Mr. DeJong and\r\nhow are you feeling and won\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down and there\xe2\x80\x99s no fire in the\r\nparlour we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to sit here.\r\n\r\nHe took part in the taffy pulling. Selina wondered if Geertje and Jozina\r\nwould ever have done squealing. It was half-past eight before she\r\nbundled them off to bed with a plate of clipped taffy lozenges between\r\nthem. She heard them scuffling and scrimmaging about in the rare freedom\r\nof their parents\xe2\x80\x99 absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, children!\xe2\x80\x9d she called. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what you promised your mother and\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe heard Geertje\xe2\x80\x99s tones mimicking her mincingly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what you\r\npromised your mother and father.\xe2\x80\x9d Then a cascade of smothered giggles.\r\n\r\nPervus had been to town, evidently, for he now took from his coat pocket\r\na bag containing half a dozen bananas\xe2\x80\x94that delicacy of delicacies to\r\nthe farm palate. She half peeled two and brought them in to the\r\npigtails. They ate them thickly rapturous, and dropped off to sleep\r\nimmediately, surfeited.\r\n\r\nPervus DeJong and Selina sat at the kitchen table, their books spread\r\nout before them on the oilcloth. The sweet heavy scent of the fruit\r\nfilled the room. Selina brought the parlour lamp into the kitchen, the\r\nbetter to see. It was a nickel-bellied lamp with a yellow glass shade\r\nthat cast a mellow golden glow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the meeting,\xe2\x80\x9d primly. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. and Mrs. Pool went.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw him swallow. \xe2\x80\x9cI got through too late. I went to town, and I got\r\nthrough too late. We\xe2\x80\x99re fixing to sow tomato seeds in the hotbeds\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina opened McBride\xe2\x80\x99s Grammar. \xe2\x80\x9cAhem!\xe2\x80\x9d a school-teacherly cough. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nthen, we\xe2\x80\x99ll parse this sentence: Blucher arrived on the field of\r\nWaterloo just as Wellington was receiving the last onslaught of\r\nNapoleon. \xe2\x80\x98Just\xe2\x80\x99 may be treated as a modifier of the dependent clause.\r\nThat is: \xe2\x80\x98Just\xe2\x80\x99 means: at the time _at which_. Well. _Just_ here\r\nmodified _at the time_. And Wellington is the . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis for half an hour. Selina kept her eyes resolutely on the book. His\r\nvoice went on with the dry business of parsing and its deep resonance\r\nstruck a response from her as a harp responds when a hand is swept over\r\nits strings. Upstairs she could hear old Jakob clumping about in his\r\npreparations for bed. Then there was only stillness overhead. Selina\r\nkept her eyes resolutely on the book. Yet she saw, as though her eyes\r\nrested on them, his large, strong hands. On the backs of them was a fine\r\ngolden down that deepened at his wrists. Heavier and darker at the\r\nwrists. She found herself praying a little for strength\xe2\x80\x94for strength\r\nagainst this horror and wickedness. This sin, this abomination that held\r\nher. A terrible, stark, and pitiful prayer, couched in the idiom of the\r\nBible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, God, keep my eyes and my thoughts away from him. Away from his\r\nhands. Let me keep my eyes and my thoughts away from the golden hairs on\r\nhis wrists. Let me not think of his wrists. . . . The owner of the\r\nsouthwest \xc2\xbc sells a strip 20 rods wide along the south side of his farm.\r\nHow much does he receive at $150 per acre?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe triumphed in this transaction, began the struggle with the square\r\nroot of 576. Square roots agonized him. She washed the slate clean with\r\nher little sponge. He was leaning close in his effort to comprehend the\r\nfiendish little figures that marched so tractably under Selina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmasterly pencil.\r\n\r\nShe took it up, glibly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe remainder must contain twice the product of\r\nthe tens by the units plus the square of the units.\xe2\x80\x9d He blinked. Utterly\r\nbewildered. \xe2\x80\x9c_And_,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Selina, blithely, \xe2\x80\x9ctwice the tens, times\r\nthe units, plus the square of the units, is the same as the sum of twice\r\nthe tens, and the units, times the units. _Therefore_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with a\r\nflourish\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cadd 4 units to the 40 and multiply the result by 4.\r\n_Therefore_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in final triumph\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe square root of 576 is 24.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was breathing rather fast. The fire in the kitchen stove snapped and\r\ncracked. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, suppose you do that for me. We\xe2\x80\x99ll wipe it out.\r\nThere! What must the remainder contain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took it up, slowly, haltingly. The house was terribly still except\r\nfor the man\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe remainder . . . twice . . . product . . . tens\r\n. . . units . . .\xe2\x80\x9d A something in his voice\xe2\x80\x94a note\xe2\x80\x94a timbre. She felt\r\nherself swaying queerly, as though the whole house were gently rocking.\r\nLittle delicious agonizing shivers chased each other, hot and cold, up\r\nher arms, down her legs, over her spine. . . . \xe2\x80\x9cplus the square of the\r\nunits is the same as the sum twice the tens . . . twice . . . the tens\r\n. . . the tens . . .\xe2\x80\x9d His voice stopped.\r\n\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s eyes leaped from the book to his hands, uncontrollably.\r\nSomething about them startled her. They were clenched into fists. Her\r\neyes now leaped from those clenched fists to the face of the man beside\r\nher. Her head came up, and back. Her wide startled eyes met his. His\r\nwere a blaze of blinding blue in his tanned face. Some corner of her\r\nmind that was still working clearly noted this. Then his hands\r\nunclenched. The blue blaze scorched her, enveloped her. Her cheek knew\r\nthe harsh cool feel of a man\xe2\x80\x99s cheek. She sensed the potent, terrifying,\r\npungent odour of close contact\xe2\x80\x94a mixture of tobacco smoke, his hair,\r\nfreshly laundered linen, an indefinable body smell. It was a mingling\r\nthat disgusted and attracted her. She was at once repelled and drawn.\r\nThen she felt his lips on hers and her own, incredibly, responding\r\neagerly, wholly to that pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were married the following May, just two months later. The High\r\nPrairie school year practically ended with the appearance of the first\r\ntender shoots of green that meant onions, radishes, and spinach above\r\nthe rich sandy loam. Selina\xe2\x80\x99s classes broke, dwindled, shrank to almost\r\nnothing. The school became a kindergarten of five-year-old babies who\r\nwriggled and shifted and scratched in the warm spring air that came from\r\nthe teeming prairie through the open windows. The schoolhouse stove\r\nstood rusty-red and cold. The drum in Selina\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom was a black genie\r\ndeprived of his power now to taunt her.\r\n\r\nSelina was at once bewildered and calm; rebellious and content.\r\nOver-laying these emotions was something like grim amusement. Beneath\r\nthem, something like fright. High Prairie, in May, was green and gold\r\nand rose and blue. The spring flowers painted the fields and the\r\nroadside with splashes of yellow, of pink, of mauve, and purple.\r\nViolets, buttercups, mandrakes, marsh-marigolds, hepatica. The air was\r\nsoft and cool from the lake. Selina had never known spring in the\r\ncountry before. It made her ache with an actual physical ache. She moved\r\nwith a strange air of fatality. It was as if she were being drawn\r\ninexorably, against her will, her judgment, her plans, into something\r\nsweet and terrible. When with Pervus she was elated, gay, voluble. He\r\ntalked little; looked at her dumbly, worshippingly. When he brought her\r\na withered bunch of trilliums, the tears came to her eyes. He had walked\r\nto Updike\xe2\x80\x99s woods to get them because he had heard her say she loved\r\nthem, and there were none nearer. They were limp and listless from the\r\nheat, and from being held in his hand. He looked up at her from where he\r\nstood on the kitchen steps, she in the doorway. She took them, laid her\r\nhand on his head. It was as when some great gentle dog brings in a limp\r\nand bedraggled prize dug from the yard and, laying it at one\xe2\x80\x99s feet,\r\nlooks up at one with soft asking eyes.\r\n\r\nThere were days when the feeling of unreality possessed her. She, a\r\ntruck farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife, living in High Prairie the rest of her days! Why,\r\nno! No! Was this the great adventure that her father had always spoken\r\nof? She, who was going to be a happy wayfarer down the path of life\xe2\x80\x94any\r\none of a dozen things. This High Prairie winter was to have been only an\r\nepisode. Not her life! She looked at Maartje. Oh, but she\xe2\x80\x99d never be\r\nlike that. That was stupid, unnecessary. Pink and blue dresses in the\r\nhouse, for her. Frills on the window curtains. Flowers in bowls.\r\n\r\nSome of the pangs and terrors with which most prospective brides are\r\nassailed she confided to Mrs. Pool while that active lady was slamming\r\nabout the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever feel scared and\xe2\x80\x94and sort of\xe2\x80\x94scared when you thought\r\nabout marry, Mrs. Pool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaartje Pool\xe2\x80\x99s hands were in a great batch of bread dough which she\r\npummelled and slapped and kneaded vigorously. She shook out a handful of\r\nflour on the baking board while she held the dough mass in the other\r\nhand, then plumped it down and again began to knead, both hands doubled\r\ninto fists.\r\n\r\nShe laughed a short little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI ran away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did! You mean you really ran\xe2\x80\x94but why? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you lo\xe2\x80\x94like Klaas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaartje Pool kneaded briskly, the colour high in her cheeks, what with\r\nthe vigorous pummelling and rolling, and something else that made her\r\nlook strangely young for the moment\xe2\x80\x94girlish, almost. \xe2\x80\x9cSure I liked him,\r\nI liked him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you ran away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot far. I came back. Nobody ever knew I ran, even. But I ran. I knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaartje elucidated her philosophy without being in the least aware that\r\nit could be called by any such high-sounding name. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t run away\r\nfar enough. Except you stop living you can\xe2\x80\x99t run away from life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girlish look had fled. She was world-old. Her strong arms ceased\r\ntheir pounding and thumping for a moment. On the steps just outside\r\nKlaas and Jakob were scanning the weekly reports preparatory to going\r\ninto the city late that afternoon.\r\n\r\nSelina had the difficult task of winning Roelf to her all over again. He\r\nwas like a trusting little animal, who, wounded by the hand he has\r\ntrusted, is shy of it. She used blandishments on this boy of thirteen\r\nsuch as she had never vouchsafed the man she was going to marry. He had\r\nasked her, bluntly, one day: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you going to marry with him?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nnever spoke the name.\r\n\r\nShe thought deeply. What to say? The answer ready on her tongue would\r\nhave little meaning for this boy. There came to her a line from Lancelot\r\nand Elaine. She answered, \xe2\x80\x9cTo serve him, and to follow him through the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d She thought that rather fine-sounding until Roelf promptly\r\nrejected it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no reason. An answer out of a book. Anyway, to\r\nfollow him through the world is dumb. He stays right here in High\r\nPrairie all his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know!\xe2\x80\x9d Selina retorted, almost angrily. Startled, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. He stays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill, he could not withstand her long. Together they dug and planted\r\nflower beds in Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s dingy front yard. It was too late for tulips\r\nnow. Pervus had brought her some seeds from town. They ranged all the\r\nway from poppies to asters; from purple iris to morning glories. The\r\nlast named were to form the back-porch vine, of course, because they\r\ngrew quickly. Selina, city-bred, was ignorant of varieties, but insisted\r\nshe wanted an old-fashioned garden\xe2\x80\x94marigolds, pinks, mignonette, phlox.\r\nShe and Roelf dug, spaded, planted. The DeJong place was markedly ugly\r\neven in that community of squat houses. It lacked the air of sparkling\r\ncleanliness that saved the other places from sordidness. The house, even\r\nthen, was thirty years old\xe2\x80\x94a gray, weather-beaten frame box with a\r\nmansard roof and a flat face staring out at the dense willows by the\r\nroadside. It needed paint; the fences sagged; the window curtains were\r\nawry. The parlour was damp, funereal. The old woman who tended the house\r\nfor Pervus slopped about all day with a pail and a wet gray rag. There\r\nwas always a crazy campanile of dirty dishes stacked on the table, and\r\nthe last meal seemed never to catch up with the next. About the whole\r\nhouse there was a starkness, a bareness that proclaimed no woman who\r\nloved it dwelt therein.\r\n\r\nSelina told herself (and Pervus) that she would change all that. She saw\r\nherself going about with a brush and a can of white paint, leaving\r\nbeauty in her wake, where ugliness had been.\r\n\r\nHer trousseau was of the scantiest. Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s household was already\r\nequipped with such linens as they would need. The question of a wedding\r\ngown troubled her until Maartje suggested that she be married in the old\r\nDutch wedding dress that lay in the bride\xe2\x80\x99s chest in Selina\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA real Dutch bride,\xe2\x80\x9d Maartje said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour man will think that is fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPervus was delighted. Selina basked in his love like a kitten in the\r\nsun. She was, after all, a very lonely little bride with only two\r\nphotographs on the shelf in her bedroom to give her courage and counsel.\r\nThe old Dutch wedding gown was many inches too large for her. The\r\nskirt-band overlapped her slim waist; her slender little bosom did not\r\nfill out the generous width of the bodice; but the effect of the whole\r\nwas amazingly quaint as well as pathetic. The wings of the stiffly\r\nembroidered coif framed the white face from which the eyes looked out,\r\nlarge and dark. She had even tried to wear the hand-carved shoes, but\r\nhad to give that up. In them her feet were as lost as minnows in a\r\nrowboat. She had much difficulty with the queer old buttons and\r\nfastenings. It was as though the dead and gone Sophia Kroon were trying,\r\nwith futile ghostly fingers, to prevent this young thing from meeting\r\nthe fate that was to be hers.\r\n\r\nThey were married at the Pools\xe2\x80\x99. Klaas and Maartje had insisted on\r\nfurnishing the wedding supper\xe2\x80\x94ham, chickens, sausages, cakes, pickles,\r\nbeer. The Reverend Dekker married them and all through the ceremony\r\nSelina chided herself because she could not keep her mind on his words\r\nin the fascination of watching his short stubby beard as it waggled with\r\nevery motion of his jaw. Pervus looked stiff, solemn, and uncomfortable\r\nin his wedding blacks\xe2\x80\x94not at all the handsome giant of the everyday\r\ncorduroys and blue shirt. In the midst of the ceremony Selina had her\r\nmoment of panic when she actually saw herself running shrieking from\r\nthis company, this man, this house, down the road, on, on toward\xe2\x80\x94toward\r\nwhat? The feeling was so strong that she was surprised to find herself\r\nstill standing there in the Dutch wedding gown answering \xe2\x80\x9cI do\xe2\x80\x9d in the\r\nproper place.\r\n\r\nThe wedding gifts were few. The Pools had given them a \xe2\x80\x9changing lamp,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncoveted of the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife; a hideous atrocity in yellow, with pink\r\nroses on its shade and prisms dangling and tinkling all around the edge.\r\nIt was intended to hang suspended from the parlour ceiling, and worked\r\nup and down on a sort of pulley chain. From the Widow Paarlenberg came a\r\nwater set in red frosted glass shading to pink\xe2\x80\x94a fat pitcher and six\r\ntumblers. Roelf\xe2\x80\x99s gift, the result of many weeks\xe2\x80\x99 labour in the\r\nwork-shed, was a bride\xe2\x80\x99s chest copied from the fine old piece that had\r\nsaved Selina\xe2\x80\x99s room from sheer ugliness. He had stained the wood,\r\npolished it. Had carved the front of it with her initials\xe2\x80\x94very like\r\nthose that stood out so boldly on the old chest upstairs\xe2\x80\x94S. P. D. And\r\nthe year\xe2\x80\x941890. The whole was a fine piece of craftsmanship for a boy of\r\nthirteen\xe2\x80\x94would not have discredited a man of any age. It was the one\r\nbeautiful gift among Selina\xe2\x80\x99s clumsy crude wedding things. She had\r\nthanked him with tears in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cRoelf, you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to see me often,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t you? Often!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, as he had hesitated, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll need you so. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nall I\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xe2\x80\x9d A strange thing for a bride to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy had said, trying to make his voice casual, his tone\r\ncareless. \xe2\x80\x9cSure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come oncet in a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce, Roelf. _Once_ in a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe repeated it after her, dutifully.\r\n\r\nAfter the wedding they went straight to DeJong\xe2\x80\x99s house. In May the\r\nvegetable farmer cannot neglect his garden even for a day. The house had\r\nbeen made ready for them. The sway of the old housekeeper was over. Her\r\nkitchen bedroom was empty.\r\n\r\nThroughout the supper Selina had had thoughts which were so foolish and\r\ndetached as almost to alarm her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I am married. I am Mrs. Pervus DeJong. That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty name. It\r\nwould look quite distinguished on a calling card, very spidery and fine:\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x94\x8c\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x90\r\n          \xe2\x94\x82                                   \xe2\x94\x82\r\n          \xe2\x94\x82                                   \xe2\x94\x82\r\n          \xe2\x94\x82         MRS. PERVUS DEJONG        \xe2\x94\x82\r\n          \xe2\x94\x82                                   \xe2\x94\x82\r\n          \xe2\x94\x82  _At Home Fridays_                \xe2\x94\x82\r\n          \xe2\x94\x82                                   \xe2\x94\x82\r\n          \xe2\x94\x94\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x98\r\n\r\nShe recalled this later, grimly, when she was Mrs. Pervus DeJong, at\r\nhome not only Fridays, but Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays,\r\nWednesdays, and Thursdays.\r\n\r\nThey drove down the road to DeJong\xe2\x80\x99s place. Selina thought, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I am\r\ndriving home with my husband. I feel his shoulder against mine. I wish\r\nhe would talk. I wish he would say something. Still, I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\nfrightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPervus\xe2\x80\x99s market wagon was standing in the yard, shafts down. He should\r\nhave gone to market to-day; would certainly have to go to-morrow,\r\nstarting early in the afternoon so as to get a good stand in the\r\nHaymarket. By the light of his lantern the wagon seemed to Selina to be\r\na symbol. She had often seen it before, but now that it was to be a part\r\nof her life\xe2\x80\x94this the DeJong market wagon and she Mrs. DeJong\xe2\x80\x94she saw\r\nclearly what a crazy, disreputable, and poverty-proclaiming old vehicle\r\nit was, in contrast with the neat strong wagon in Klaas Pool\xe2\x80\x99s yard,\r\nsmart with green paint and red lettering that announced, \xe2\x80\x9cKlaas Pool,\r\nGarden Produce.\xe2\x80\x9d With the two sleek farm horses the turnout looked as\r\nprosperous and comfortable as Klaas himself.\r\n\r\nPervus swung her down from the seat of the buggy, his hand about her\r\nwaist, and held her so for a moment, close. Selina said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have\r\nthat wagon painted, Pervus. And the seat-springs fixed and the sideboard\r\nmended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared. \xe2\x80\x9cWagon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It looks a sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe house was tidy enough, but none too clean. Old Mrs. Voorhees had not\r\nbeen minded to keep house too scrupulously for a man who would be\r\nunlikely to know whether or not it was clean. Pervus lighted the lamps.\r\nThere was a fire in the kitchen stove. It made the house seem stuffy on\r\nthis mild May night. Selina thought that her own little bedroom at the\r\nPools\xe2\x80\x99, no longer hers, must be deliciously cool and still with the\r\nbreeze fanning fresh from the west. Pervus was putting the horse into\r\nthe barn. The bedroom was off the sitting room. The window was shut.\r\nThis last year had taught Selina to prepare the night before for next\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x99s rising, so as to lose the least possible time. She did this\r\nnow, unconsciously. She took off her white muslin underwear with its\r\nfrills and embroidery\xe2\x80\x94the three stiff petticoats, and the stiffly\r\nstarched corset-cover, and the high-bosomed corset and put them into the\r\nbureau drawer that she herself had cleaned and papered neatly the week\r\nbefore. She brushed her hair, laid out to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s garments, put on her\r\nhigh-necked, long-sleeved nightgown and got into this strange bed. She\r\nheard Pervus DeJong shut the kitchen door; the latch clicked, the lock\r\nturned. Heavy quick footsteps across the bare kitchen floor. This man\r\nwas coming into her room . . . \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t run far enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Maartje Pool\r\nhad said. \xe2\x80\x9cExcept you stop living you can\xe2\x80\x99t run away from life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext morning it was dark when he awakened her at four. She started up\r\nwith a little cry and sat up, straining her ears, her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that\r\nyou, Father?\xe2\x80\x9d She was little Selina Peake again, and Simeon Peake had\r\ncome in, gay, debonair, from a night\xe2\x80\x99s gaming.\r\n\r\nPervus DeJong was already padding about the room in stocking feet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94what time is it? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Father? Why are you up?\r\nHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you gone to bed . . .\xe2\x80\x9d Then she remembered.\r\n\r\nPervus DeJong laughed and came toward her. \xe2\x80\x9cGet up, little lazy bones.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s after four. All yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s work I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do, and all to-day\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nBreakfast, little Lina, breakfast. You are a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBy October High Prairie Housewives told each other that Mrs. Pervus\r\nDeJong was \xe2\x80\x9cexpecting.\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk DeJong was born in the bedroom off the\r\nsitting room on the fifteenth day of March, of a bewildered, somewhat\r\nresentful, but deeply interested mother; and a proud, foolish, and\r\nvainglorious father whose air of achievement, considering the really\r\nslight part he had played in the long, tedious, and racking business,\r\nwas disproportionate. The name Dirk had sounded to Selina like something\r\ntall, straight, and slim. Pervus had chosen it. It had been his\r\ngrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nSometimes, during those months, Selina would look back on her first\r\nwinter in High Prairie\xe2\x80\x94that winter of the icy bedroom, the chill black\r\ndrum, the schoolhouse fire, the chilblains, the Pool pork\xe2\x80\x94and it seemed\r\na lovely dream; a time of ease, of freedom, of careless happiness. That\r\nicy room had been her room; that mile of road traversed on bitter winter\r\nmornings a mere jaunt; the schoolhouse stove a toy, fractious but\r\nfascinating.\r\n\r\nPervus DeJong loved his pretty young wife, and she him. But young love\r\nthrives on colour, warmth, beauty. It becomes prosaic and inarticulate\r\nwhen forced to begin its day at four in the morning by reaching blindly,\r\ndazedly, for limp and obscure garments dangling from bedpost or chair,\r\nand to end that day at nine, numb and sodden with weariness, after\r\nseventeen hours of physical labour.\r\n\r\nIt was a wet summer. Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s choice tomato plants, so carefully set out\r\nin the hope of a dry season, became draggled gray spectres in a waste of\r\nmire. Of fruit the field bore one tomato the size of a marble.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the crops were moderately successful on the DeJong place.\r\nBut the work necessary to make this so was heartbreaking. Pervus and his\r\nhired helper, Jan Steen, used the hand sower and hand cultivator. It\r\nseemed to Selina that they were slaves to these buds, shoots, and roots\r\nthat clamoured with a hundred thousand voices, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me out! Let me out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe had known, during her winter at the Pools\xe2\x80\x99, that Klaas, Roelf, and\r\nold Jakob worked early and late, but her months there had encompassed\r\nwhat is really the truck farmer\xe2\x80\x99s leisure period. She had arrived in\r\nNovember. She had married in May. From May until October it was\r\nnecessary to tend the fields with a concentration amounting to fury.\r\nSelina had never dreamed that human beings toiled like that for\r\nsustenance. Toil was a thing she had never encountered until coming to\r\nHigh Prairie. Now she saw her husband wrenching a living out of the\r\nearth by sheer muscle, sweat, and pain. During June, July, August, and\r\nSeptember the good black prairie soil for miles around was teeming, a\r\nhotbed of plenty. There was born in Selina at this time a feeling for\r\nthe land that she was never to lose. Perhaps the child within her had\r\nsomething to do with this. She was aware of a feeling of kinship with\r\nthe earth; an illusion of splendour, of fulfilment. Sometimes, in a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s respite from her work about the house, she would stand in the\r\nkitchen doorway, her flushed face turned toward the fields. Wave on wave\r\nof green, wave on wave, until the waves melted into each other and\r\nbecame a verdant sea.\r\n\r\nAs cabbages had been cabbages, and no more, to Klaas Pool, so, to\r\nPervus, these carrots, beets, onions, turnips, and radishes were just so\r\nmuch produce, to be planted, tended, gathered, marketed. But to Selina,\r\nduring that summer, they became a vital part in the vast mechanism of a\r\nliving world. Pervus, earth, sun, rain, all elemental forces that\r\nlaboured to produce the food for millions of humans. The sordid, grubby\r\nlittle acreage became a kingdom; the phlegmatic Dutch-American truck\r\nfarmers of the region were high priests consecrated to the service of\r\nthe divinity, Earth. She thought of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s children. If they had red\r\ncheeks, clear eyes, nimble brains it was because Pervus brought them the\r\nfood that made them so. It was before the day when glib talk of irons,\r\nvitamines, arsenic entered into all discussion pertaining to food. Yet\r\nSelina sensed something of the meaning behind these toiling, patient\r\nfigures, all unconscious of meaning, bent double in the fields for miles\r\nthroughout High Prairie. Something of this she tried to convey to\r\nPervus. He only stared, his blue eyes wide and unresponsive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarm work grand! Farm work is slave work. Yesterday, from the load of\r\ncarrots in town I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make enough to bring you the goods for the\r\nchild so when it comes you should have clothes for it. It\xe2\x80\x99s better I\r\nfeed them to the livestock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPervus drove into the Chicago market every other day. During July and\r\nAugust he sometimes did not have his clothes off for a week. Together he\r\nand Jan Steen would load the wagon with the day\xe2\x80\x99s garnering. At four he\r\nwould start on the tedious trip into town. The historic old Haymarket on\r\nwest Randolph Street had become the stand for market gardeners for miles\r\naround Chicago. Here they stationed their wagons in preparation for the\r\nnext day\xe2\x80\x99s selling. The wagons stood, close packed, in triple rows, down\r\nboth sides of the curb and in the middle of the street. The early comer\r\ngot the advantageous stand. There was no regular allotment of space.\r\nPervus tried to reach the Haymarket by nine at night. Often bad roads\r\nmade a detour necessary and he was late. That usually meant bad business\r\nnext day. The men, for the most part, slept on their wagons, curled up\r\non the wagon-seat or stretched out on the sacks. Their horses were\r\nstabled and fed in near-by sheds, with more actual comfort than the men\r\nthemselves. One could get a room for twenty-five cents in one of the\r\nramshackle rooming houses that faced the street. But the rooms were\r\nsmall, stuffy, none too clean; the beds little more comfortable than the\r\nwagons. Besides, twenty-five cents! You got twenty-five cents for half a\r\nbarrel of tomatoes. You got twenty-five cents for a sack of potatoes.\r\nOnions brought seventy-five cents a sack. Cabbages went a hundred heads\r\nfor two dollars, and they were five-pound heads. If you drove home with\r\nten dollars in your pocket it represented a profit of exactly zero. The\r\nsum must go above that. No; one did not pay out twenty-five cents for\r\nthe mere privilege of sleeping in a bed.\r\n\r\nOne June day, a month or more after their marriage, Selina drove into\r\nChicago with Pervus, an incongruous little figure in her bride\xe2\x80\x99s finery\r\nperched on the seat of the vegetable wagon piled high with early garden\r\nstuff. They had started before four that afternoon, and reached the city\r\nat nine, though the roads were still heavy from the late May rains. It\r\nwas, in a way, their wedding trip, for Selina had not been away from the\r\nfarm since her marriage. The sun was bright and hot. Selina held an\r\numbrella to shield herself from the heat and looked about her with\r\nenjoyment and interest. She chattered, turned her head this way and\r\nthat, exclaimed, questioned. Sometimes she wished that Pervus would\r\nrespond more quickly to her mood. A gay, volatile creature, she frisked\r\nabout him like a friendly bright-eyed terrier about a stolid, ponderous\r\nSt. Bernard.\r\n\r\nAs they jogged along now she revealed magnificent plans that had been\r\nforming in her imagination during the past four weeks. It had not taken\r\nher four weeks\xe2\x80\x94or days\xe2\x80\x94to discover that this great broad-shouldered\r\nman she had married was a kindly creature, tender and good, but lacking\r\nany vestige of initiative, of spirit. She marvelled, sometimes, at the\r\nmemory of his boldness in bidding for her lunch box that evening of the\r\nraffle. It seemed incredible now, though he frequently referred to it,\r\nwagging his head doggishly and grinning the broadly complacent grin of\r\nthe conquering male. But he was, after all, a dull fellow, and there was\r\nin Selina a dash of fire, of wholesome wickedness, of adventure, that he\r\nnever quite understood. For her flashes of flame he had a mingled\r\nfeeling of uneasiness and pride.\r\n\r\nIn the manner of all young brides, Selina started bravely out to make\r\nher husband over. He was handsome, strong, gentle; slow, conservative,\r\nmorose. She would make him keen, daring, successful, buoyant. Now,\r\nbumping down the Halsted road, she sketched some of her plans in large\r\ndashing strokes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPervus, we must paint the house in October, before the frost sets in,\r\nand after the summer work is over. White would be nice, with green\r\ntrimmings. Though perhaps white isn\xe2\x80\x99t practical. Or maybe green with\r\ndarker green trimmings. A lovely background for the hollyhocks.\xe2\x80\x9d (Those\r\nthat she and Roelf had planted showed no signs of coming up.) \xe2\x80\x9cThen that\r\nwest sixteen. We\xe2\x80\x99ll drain it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh, drain,\xe2\x80\x9d Pervus muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s clay land. Drain and you have got\r\nyet clay. Hard clay soil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina had the answer to that. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to use tile\r\ndrainage. And\xe2\x80\x94wait a minute\xe2\x80\x94humus. I know what humus is. It\xe2\x80\x99s decayed\r\nvegetables. There\xe2\x80\x99s always a pile by the side of the barn; and you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen using it on the quick land. All the west sixteen isn\xe2\x80\x99t clay. Part\r\nof it\xe2\x80\x99s muckland. All it needs is draining and manure. With potash, too,\r\nand phosphoric acid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPervus laughed a great hearty laugh that Selina found surprisingly\r\ninfuriating. He put one great brown hand patronizingly on her flushed\r\ncheek; pinched it gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, and jerked her head away. It was the first time\r\nshe had ever resented a caress from him.\r\n\r\nPervus laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, well! School teacher is a farmer now,\r\nhuh? I bet even Widow Paarlenberg don\xe2\x80\x99t know as much as my little farmer\r\nabout\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he exploded again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cabout this, now, potash and\xe2\x80\x94what kind of\r\nacid? Tell me, little Lina, from where did you learn all this about\r\ntruck farming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of a book,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said, almost snappishly. \xe2\x80\x9cI sent to Chicago for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA book! A book!\xe2\x80\x9d He slapped his knee. \xe2\x80\x9cA vegetable farmer out of a\r\nbook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not! The man who wrote it knows more about vegetable farming than\r\nanybody in all High Prairie. He knows about new ways. You\xe2\x80\x99re running the\r\nfarm just the way your father ran it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was good enough for my father is good enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Selina, \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t! The book says clay loam is all\r\nright for cabbages, peas, and beans. It tells you how. It tells you\r\nhow!\xe2\x80\x9d She was like a frantic little fly darting and pricking him on to\r\naccelerate the stolid sluggishness of his slow plodding gait.\r\n\r\nHaving begun, she plunged on. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to have two horses to haul the\r\nwagon to market. It would save you hours of time that you could spend on\r\nthe place. Two horses, and a new wagon, green and red, like Klaas\r\nPool\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPervus stared straight ahead down the road between his horse\xe2\x80\x99s ears much\r\nas Klaas Pool had done so maddeningly on Selina\xe2\x80\x99s first ride on the\r\nHalsted road. \xe2\x80\x9cFine talk. Fine talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t talk. It\xe2\x80\x99s plans. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine talk. Fine talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d Selina beat her knee with an impotent fist.\r\n\r\nIt was the nearest they had ever come to quarrelling. It would seem that\r\nPervus had the best of the argument, for when two years had passed the\r\nwest sixteen was still a boggy clay mass, and unprolific; and the old\r\nhouse stared out shabby and paintless, at the dense willows by the\r\nroadside.\r\n\r\nThey slept that night in one of the twenty-five-cent rooming houses.\r\nRather, Pervus slept. The woman lay awake, listening to the city noises\r\nthat had become strange in her ears; staring out into the purple-black\r\noblong that was the open window, until that oblong became gray. She wept\r\na little, perhaps. But in the morning Pervus might have noted (if he had\r\nbeen a man given to noting) that the fine jaw-line was set as\r\ndeterminedly as ever with an angle that spelled inevitably paint,\r\ndrainage, humus, potash, phosphoric acid, and a horse team.\r\n\r\nShe rose before four with Pervus, glad to be out of the stuffy little\r\nroom with its spotted and scaly green wall paper, its rickety bed and\r\nchair. They had a cup of coffee and a slice of bread in the eating house\r\non the first floor. Selina waited while he tended the horse. The\r\nnight-watchman had been paid another twenty-five cents for watching the\r\nwagonload through the night as it stood in a row with the hundreds of\r\nothers in the Haymarket. It was scarcely dawn when the trading began.\r\nSelina, watching it from the wagon seat, thought that this was a\r\nridiculously haphazard and perilous method of distributing the food for\r\nwhose fruition Pervus had toiled with aching back and tired arms. But\r\nshe said nothing.\r\n\r\nShe kept, perforce, to the house that first year, and the second. Pervus\r\ndeclared that his woman should never work in the fields as did many of\r\nthe High Prairie wives and daughters. Of ready cash there was almost\r\nnone. Pervus was hard put to it to pay Jan Steen his monthly wage during\r\nMay, June, July, and August, when he was employed on the DeJong place,\r\nthough Steen got but a pittance, being known as a poor hand, and \xe2\x80\x9cdumb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSelina learned much that first year, and the second, but she said\r\nlittle. She kept the house in order\xe2\x80\x94rough work, and endless\xe2\x80\x94and she\r\nmanaged, miraculously, to keep herself looking fresh and neat. She\r\nunderstood now Maartje Pool\xe2\x80\x99s drab garments, harassed face, heavily\r\nswift feet, never at rest. The idea of flowers in bowls was abandoned by\r\nJuly. Had it not been for Roelf\xe2\x80\x99s faithful tending, the flower beds\r\nthemselves, planted with such hopes, would have perished for lack of\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nRoelf came often to the house. He found there a tranquillity and peace\r\nnever known in the Pool place, with its hubbub and clatter. In order to\r\nmake her house attractive Selina had actually rifled her precious little\r\nbank hoard\xe2\x80\x94the four hundred and ninety-seven dollars left her by her\r\nfather. She still had one of the clear white diamonds. She kept it sewed\r\nin the hem of an old flannel petticoat. Once she had shown it to Pervus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I sell this maybe we could get enough money to drain and tile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPervus took the stone, weighed it in his great palm, blinked as he\r\nalways did when discussing a subject of which he was ignorant. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much\r\ncould you get for it? Fifty dollars, maybe. Five hundred is what I would\r\nneed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it in the bank!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe next spring. Right now I got my hands full, and more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Selina that seemed a short-sighted argument. But she was too newly\r\nmarried to stand her ground; too much in love; too ignorant still of\r\nfarm conditions.\r\n\r\nThe can of white paint and the brush actually did materialize. For weeks\r\nit was dangerous to sit, lean, or tread upon any paintable thing in the\r\nDeJong farmhouse without eliciting a cry of warning from Selina. She\r\nwould actually have tried her hand at the outside of the house with a\r\nquart can and three-inch brush if Pervus hadn\xe2\x80\x99t intervened. She hemmed\r\ndimity curtains, made slip-covers for the hideous parlour sofa and the\r\nugliest of the chairs. Subscribed for a magazine called _House and\r\nGarden_. Together she and Roelf used to pore over this fascinating\r\nperiodical. Terraces, lily-pools, leaded casements, cretonne,\r\nfireplaces, yew trees, pergolas, fountains\xe2\x80\x94they absorbed them all,\r\nexclaimed, admired, actually criticized. Selina was torn between an\r\nEnglish cottage with timbered porch, bay window, stone flagging, and an\r\nItalian villa with a broad terrace on which she would stand in trailing\r\nwhite with a Russian wolf-hound. If High Prairie had ever overheard one\r\nof these conversations between the farm woman who would always be a girl\r\nand the farm boy who had never been quite a child, it would have raised\r\npalms high in an \xe2\x80\x9cOg heden!\xe2\x80\x9d of horror. But High Prairie never heard,\r\nand wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have understood if it had. She did another strange thing:\r\nShe placed the fine hand-carved oak chest Roelf had given her in a\r\nposition so that her child should see it as soon as he opened his eyes\r\nin the morning. It was the most beautiful thing she possessed. She had,\r\ntoo, an incomplete set of old Dutch luster ware. It had belonged to\r\nPervus\xe2\x80\x99s mother, and to her mother before her. On Sunday nights Selina\r\nused this set for supper, though Pervus protested. And she always\r\ninsisted that Dirk drink his milk out of one of the lovely jewel-like\r\ncups. Pervus thought this a piece of madness.\r\n\r\nSelina was up daily at four. Dressing was a swift and mechanical\r\ncovering of the body. Breakfast must be ready for Pervus and Jan when\r\nthey came in from the barn. The house to clean, the chickens to tend,\r\nsewing, washing, ironing, cooking. She contrived ways of minimizing her\r\nsteps, of lightening her labour. And she saw clearly how the little farm\r\nwas mismanaged through lack of foresight, imagination, and\xe2\x80\x94she faced it\r\nsquarely\xe2\x80\x94through stupidity. She was fond of this great, kindly,\r\nblundering, stubborn boy who was her husband. But she saw him with\r\namazing clearness through the mists of her love. There was something\r\nprophetic about the way she began to absorb knowledge of the farm work,\r\nof vegetable culture, of marketing. Listening, seeing, she learned about\r\nsoil, planting, weather, selling. The daily talk of the house and fields\r\nwas of nothing else. About this little twenty-five-acre garden patch\r\nthere was nothing of the majesty of the Iowa, Illinois, and Kansas grain\r\nfarms, with their endless billows of wheat and corn, rye, alfalfa, and\r\nbarley rolling away to the horizon. Everything was done in diminutive\r\nhere. An acre of this. Two acres of that. A score of chickens. One cow.\r\nOne horse. Two pigs. Here was all the drudgery of farm life with none of\r\nits bounteousness, fine sweep, or splendour. Selina sensed that every\r\ninch of soil should have been made to yield to the utmost. Yet there lay\r\nthe west sixteen, useless during most of the year; reliable never. And\r\nthere was no money to drain it or enrich it; no ready cash for the\r\npurchase of profitable neighbouring acreage. She did not know the term\r\nintensive farming, but this was what she meant. Artificial protection\r\nagainst the treacherous climate of the Great Lakes region was pitifully\r\nlacking in Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s plans. Now it would be hot with the humid,\r\nwithering, sticky heat of the district. The ground was teeming, smoking,\r\nand the green things seemed actually to be pushing their way out of the\r\nearth so that one could almost see them growing, as in some absurd\r\noptical illusion. Then, without warning, would come the icy Lake\r\nMichigan wind, nipping the tender shoots with fiendish fingers. There\r\nshould have been hotbeds and coldframes, forcing-hills, hand-boxes.\r\nThere were almost none.\r\n\r\nThese things Selina saw, but not quite clearly. She went about her\r\nhousework, now dreamily, now happily. Her physical condition swayed her\r\nmood. Sometimes, in the early autumn, when the days became cooler, she\r\nwould go to where Pervus and Jan were working in the fields in the late\r\nafternoon gathering the produce for that night\xe2\x80\x99s trip to market. She\r\nwould stand there, a bit of sewing in her hand, perhaps, the wind\r\nruffling her hair, whipping her skirts, her face no longer pale, tilted\r\na little toward the good sun like a lovely tawny flower. Sometimes she\r\nsat perched on a pile of empty sacks, or on an up-ended crate, her\r\nsewing in her hand. She was happiest at such times\xe2\x80\x94most content\xe2\x80\x94except\r\nfor the pang she felt at sight of the great dark splotch on the blue of\r\nPervus\xe2\x80\x99s work-shirt where the sweat stained it.\r\n\r\nShe had come out so one autumn afternoon. She was feeling particularly\r\ngay, buoyant. In one of his rare hours of leisure Roelf Pool had come to\r\nhelp her with her peony roots which Pervus had brought her from Chicago\r\nfor fall planting. Roelf had dug the trench, deep and wide, mulched it\r\nwith cow-manure, banked it. They were to form a double row up the path\r\nto the front of the house, and in her mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye Selina already saw them\r\nblooming when spring should come, shaggy balls of luscious pink. Now\r\nRoelf was lending a hand to Pervus and Jan as they bent over the late\r\nbeets and radishes. It was a day all gold and blue and scarlet; warm for\r\nthe season with a ripe mellow warmth like yellow chartreuse. There were\r\nstretches of seal-black loam where the vegetables had been uprooted.\r\nBunches of them, string-tied, lay ready for gathering into baskets.\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s eye was gladdened by the clear coral of radishes flung against\r\nthe rich black loam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA jewel, Pervus!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cA jewel in an Ethiop\xe2\x80\x99s ear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pervus, looking up, amiable but uncomprehending. But the\r\nboy smiled. Selina had left him that book for his own when she went\r\naway. Suddenly Selina stooped and picked up one of the scarlet and green\r\nclusters tied with its bit of string. Laughing, she whipped out a\r\nhairpin and fastened the bunch in her hair just behind her ear. An\r\nabsurd thing to do, and childish. It should have looked as absurd as it\r\nwas, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Instead it was like a great crimson flower there.\r\nHer cheeks were flushed with the hot sun. Her fine dark hair was\r\nwind-blown and a little loosened, her dress open at the throat. Her\r\nfigure was fuller, her breast had a richer curve, for the child was four\r\nmonths on the way. She was laughing. At a little exclamation from Roelf,\r\nPervus looked up, as did Jan. Selina took a slow rhythmic step, and\r\nanother, her arms upraised, a provocative lovely bacchic little figure\r\nthere in the fields under the hot blue sky. Jan Steen wiped the sweat\r\nfrom his brown face, a glow in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are like the calendar!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Roelf, \xe2\x80\x9con the wall in the parlour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nA cheap but vivid and not unlovely picture of a girl with cherries in\r\nher hair. It hung in the Pool farmhouse.\r\n\r\nPervus DeJong showed one of his rare storms of passion. Selina had not\r\nseen that blaze of blue in his eyes since the night, months ago, in the\r\nPools\xe2\x80\x99 kitchen. But that blaze had been a hot and burning blue, like the\r\nsky of to-day. This was a bitter blue, a chill and freezing thing, like\r\nthe steel-blue of ice in the sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake them things out of your hair now! Take shame to yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nstrode over to her and snatched the things from her hair and threw them\r\ndown and ground them into the soft earth with his heavy heel. A long\r\ncoil of her fine dark hair came rippling over her shoulder as he did so.\r\nShe stood looking at him, her eyes wide, dark, enormous in her face now\r\nsuddenly white.\r\n\r\nHis wrath was born of the narrow insular mind that fears gossip. He knew\r\nthat the hired man would tell through the length and width of High\r\nPrairie how Pervus DeJong\xe2\x80\x99s wife pinned red radishes in her hair and\r\ndanced in the fields like a loose woman.\r\n\r\nSelina had turned, fled to the house. It was their first serious\r\nquarrel. For days she was hurt, ashamed, moody. They made it up, of\r\ncourse. Pervus was contrite, abject almost. But something that belonged\r\nto her girlhood had left her that day.\r\n\r\nDuring that winter she was often hideously lonely. She never got over\r\nher hunger for companionship. Here she was, a gregarious and fun-loving\r\ncreature, buried in a snow-bound Illinois prairie farmhouse with a\r\nhusband who looked upon conversation as a convenience, not a pastime.\r\nShe learned much that winter about the utter sordidness of farm life.\r\nShe rarely saw the Pools; she rarely saw any one outside her own little\r\nhousehold. The front room\xe2\x80\x94the parlour\xe2\x80\x94was usually bitterly cold but\r\nsometimes she used to slip in there, a shawl over her shoulders, and sit\r\nat the frosty window to watch for a wagon to go by, or a chance\r\npedestrian up the road. She did not pity herself, nor regret her step.\r\nShe felt, physically, pretty well for a child-bearing woman; and Pervus\r\nwas tender, kindly, sympathetic, if not always understanding. She\r\nstruggled gallantly to keep up the small decencies of existence. She\r\nloved the glow in Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s eyes when she appeared with a bright ribbon,\r\na fresh collar, though he said nothing and perhaps she only fancied that\r\nhe noticed. Once or twice she had walked the mile and a half of slippery\r\nroad to the Pools\xe2\x80\x99, and had sat in Maartje\xe2\x80\x99s warm bright bustling\r\nkitchen for comfort. It seemed to her incredible that a little more than\r\na year ago she had first stepped into this kitchen in her modish brown\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s-cloth dress, muffled in wraps, cold but elated, interested, ready\r\nfor adventure, surprise, discomfort\xe2\x80\x94anything. And now here she was in\r\nthat same kitchen, amazingly, unbelievably Mrs. Pervus DeJong, truck\r\nfarmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife, with a child soon to be born. And where was adventure\r\nnow? And where was life? And where the love of chance bred in her by her\r\nfather?\r\n\r\nThe two years following Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s birth were always somewhat vague in\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s mind, like a dream in which horror and happiness are\r\ninextricably blended. The boy was a plump hardy infant who employed\r\nhimself cheerfully in whatever spot Selina happened to deposit him. He\r\nhad his father\xe2\x80\x99s blond exterior, his mother\xe2\x80\x99s brunette vivacity. At two\r\nhe was a child of average intelligence, sturdy physique, and marked good\r\nhumour. He almost never cried.\r\n\r\nHe was just twelve months old when Selina\xe2\x80\x99s second child\xe2\x80\x94a girl\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nborn dead. Twice during those two years Pervus fell victim to his\r\nso-called rheumatic attacks following the early spring planting when he\r\nwas often forced to stand in water up to his ankles. He suffered\r\nintensely and during his illness was as tractable as a goaded bull.\r\nSelina understood why half of High Prairie was bent and twisted with\r\nrheumatism\xe2\x80\x94why the little Dutch Reformed church on Sunday mornings\r\nresembled a shrine to which sick and crippled pilgrims creep.\r\n\r\nHigh Prairie was kind to the harried household. The farm women sent\r\nDutch dainties. The men lent a hand in the fields, though they were hard\r\nput to it to tend their own crops at this season. The Widow\r\nPaarlenberg\xe2\x80\x99s neat smart rig was frequently to be seen waiting under the\r\nwillows in the DeJong yard. The Paarlenberg, still widow, still\r\nPaarlenberg, brought soups and chickens and cakes which never stuck in\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s throat because she refused to touch them. The Widow Paarlenberg\r\nwas what is known as good-hearted. She was happiest when some one else\r\nwas in trouble. Hearing of an illness, a catastrophe, \xe2\x80\x9cOg heden!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwould cry, and rush off to the scene with sustaining soup. She was the\r\nsort of lady bountiful who likes to see her beneficiaries benefit before\r\nher very eyes. If she brought them soup at ten in the morning she wanted\r\nto see that soup consumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEat it all,\xe2\x80\x9d she would urge. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it now, while it is hot. See, you\r\nare looking better already. Just another spoonful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the DeJongs\xe2\x80\x99 plight she found a grisly satisfaction, cloaked by\r\ncommiseration. Selina, white and weak following her tragic second\r\nconfinement, still found strength to refuse the widow\xe2\x80\x99s sustaining\r\npotions. The widow, her silks making a gentle susurrus in the bare\r\nlittle bedroom, regarded Selina with eyes in which pity and triumph made\r\nhorrid conflict. Selina\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, enormous now in her white face, were\r\ntwin pools of Peake pride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s most kind of you, Mrs. Paarlenberg, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like soup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA whole chicken boiled in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially chicken soup. Neither does Pervus. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Mrs.\r\nVoorhees will enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d This being Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s old housekeeper pressed now\r\ninto temporary emergency service.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see why the DeJong house still was unpainted two years\r\nafter Selina\xe2\x80\x99s rosy plans began to form; why the fences still sagged,\r\nthe wagon creaked, the single horse hauled the produce to market.\r\n\r\nSelina had been married almost three years when there came to her a\r\nletter from Julie Hempel, now married. The letter had been sent to the\r\nKlaas Pool farm and Jozina had brought it to her. Though she had not\r\nseen it since her days at Miss Fister\xe2\x80\x99s school, Selina recognized with a\r\nlittle hastening heart-beat the spidery handwriting with the shading and\r\ncurleycues. Seated on her kitchen steps in her calico dress she read it.\r\n\r\n    DARLING SELINA:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    I thought it was so queer that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer my letter and\r\n    now I know you must have thought it queer that I did not answer\r\n    yours. I found your letter to me, written long ago, when I was\r\n    going over Mother\xe2\x80\x99s things last week. It was the letter you must\r\n    have written when I was in Kansas City. Mother had never given\r\n    it to me. I am not reproaching her. You see, I had written you\r\n    from Kansas City, but had sent my letter to Mamma to mail\r\n    because I never could remember that funny address of yours in\r\n    the country.\r\n\r\n    Mamma died three weeks ago. Last week I was going over her\r\n    things\xe2\x80\x94a trying task, you may imagine\xe2\x80\x94and there were your two\r\n    letters addressed to me. She had never destroyed them. Poor\r\n    Mamma . . .\r\n\r\n    Well, dear Selina, I suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know that I am\r\n    married. I married Michael Arnold of Kansas City. The Arnolds\r\n    were in the packing business there, you know. Michael has gone\r\n    into business with Pa here in Chicago and I suppose you have\r\n    heard of Pa\xe2\x80\x99s success. Just all of a sudden he began to make a\r\n    great deal of money after he left the butcher business and went\r\n    into the yards\xe2\x80\x94the stockyards, you know. Poor Mamma was so\r\n    happy these last few years, and had everything that was\r\n    beautiful. I have two children. Eugene and Pauline.\r\n\r\n    I am getting to be quite a society person. You would laugh to\r\n    see me. I am on the Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Entertainment Committee of the\r\n    World\xe2\x80\x99s Fair. We are supposed to entertain all the visiting big\r\n    bugs\xe2\x80\x94that is the lady bugs. There! How is that for a joke?\r\n\r\n    I suppose you know about the Infanta Eulalie. Of Spain, you\r\n    know. And what she did about the Potter Palmer ball. . . .\r\n\r\nSelina, holding the letter in her work-stained hand, looked up and\r\nacross the fields and away to where the prairie met the sky and closed\r\nin on her; her world. The Infanta Eulalie of Spain. . . . She went back\r\nto the letter.\r\n\r\n    Well, she came to Chicago for the Fair and Mrs. Potter Palmer\r\n    was to give a huge reception and ball for her. Mrs. P. is head\r\n    of the whole committee, you know, and I must say she looks\r\n    queenly with her white hair so beautifully dressed and her\r\n    diamond dog-collar and her black velvet and all. Well, at the\r\n    very last minute the Infanta refused to attend the ball because\r\n    she had just heard that Mrs. P. was an innkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n    Imagine! The Palmer House, of course.\r\n\r\nSelina, holding the letter in her hand, imagined.\r\n\r\nIt was in the third year of Selina\xe2\x80\x99s marriage that she first went into\r\nthe fields to work. Pervus had protested miserably, though the\r\nvegetables were spoiling in the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them rot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter the stuff rots in the ground. DeJong\r\nwomen folks they never worked in the fields. Not even in Holland. Not my\r\nmother or my grandmother. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t for women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina had regained health and vigour after two years of wretchedness.\r\nShe felt steel-strong and even hopeful again, sure sign of physical\r\nwell-being. Long before now she had realized that this time must\r\ninevitably come. So she answered briskly, \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Pervus. Working in\r\nthe field\xe2\x80\x99s no harder than washing or ironing or scrubbing or standing\r\nover a hot stove in August. Women\xe2\x80\x99s work! Housework\xe2\x80\x99s the hardest work\r\nin the world. That\xe2\x80\x99s why men won\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would often take the boy Dirk with her into the fields, placing him\r\non a heap of empty sacks in the shade. He invariably crawled off this\r\nlowly throne to dig and burrow in the warm black dirt. He even made as\r\nthough to help his mother, pulling at the rooted things with futile\r\nfingers, and sitting back with a bump when a shallow root did\r\nunexpectedly yield to his tugging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! He\xe2\x80\x99s a farmer already,\xe2\x80\x9d Pervus would say.\r\n\r\nBut within Selina something would cry, \xe2\x80\x9cNo! No!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring May, June, and July Pervus worked not only from morning until\r\nnight, but by moonlight as well, and Selina worked with him. Often their\r\nsleep was a matter of three hours only, or four.\r\n\r\nSo two years went\xe2\x80\x94three years\xe2\x80\x94four. In the fourth year of Selina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarriage she suffered the loss of her one woman friend in all High\r\nPrairie. Maartje Pool died in childbirth, as was so often the case in\r\nthis region where a Gampish midwife acted as obstetrician. The child,\r\ntoo, had not lived. Death had not been kind to Maartje Pool. It had\r\nbrought neither peace nor youth to her face, as it so often does.\r\nSelina, looking down at the strangely still figure that had been so\r\nactive, so bustling, realized that for the first time in the years she\r\nhad known her she was seeing Maartje Pool at rest. It seemed incredible\r\nthat she could lie there, the infant in her arms, while the house was\r\nfilled with people and there were chairs to be handed, space to be\r\ncleared, food to be cooked and served. Sitting there with the other High\r\nPrairie women Selina had a hideous feeling that Maartje would suddenly\r\nrise up and take things in charge; rub and scratch with capable fingers\r\nthe spatters of dried mud on Klaas Pool\xe2\x80\x99s black trousers (he had been in\r\nthe yard to see to the horses); quiet the loud wailing of Geertje and\r\nJozina; pass her gnarled hand over Roelf\xe2\x80\x99s wide-staring tearless eyes;\r\nwipe the film of dust from the parlour table that had never known a\r\nspeck during her r\xc3\xa9gime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t run far enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Maartje had said. \xe2\x80\x9cExcept you stop living\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t run away from life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, she had run far enough this time.\r\n\r\nRoelf was sixteen now, Geertje twelve, Jozina eleven. What would this\r\nhousehold do now, Selina wondered, without the woman who had been so\r\nfaithful a slave to it? Who would keep the pigtails\xe2\x80\x94no longer\r\ngiggling\xe2\x80\x94in clean ginghams and decent square-toed shoes? Who, when\r\nKlaas broke out in rumbling Dutch wrath against what he termed Roelf\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdumb\xe2\x80\x9d ways, would say, \xe2\x80\x9cOg, Pool, leave the boy alone once. He does\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d Who would keep Klaas himself in order; cook his meals, wash\r\nhis clothes, iron his shirts, take pride in the great ruddy childlike\r\ngiant?\r\n\r\nKlaas answered these questions just nine months later by marrying the\r\nWidow Paarlenberg. High Prairie was rocked with surprise. For months\r\nthis marriage was the talk of the district. They had gone to Niagara\r\nFalls on a wedding trip; Pool\xe2\x80\x99s place was going to have this improvement\r\nand that; no, they were going to move to the Widow Paarlenberg\xe2\x80\x99s large\r\nfarmhouse (they would always call her that); no, Pool was putting in a\r\nbathroom with a bathtub and running water; no, they were going to buy\r\nthe Stikker place between Pool\xe2\x80\x99s and Paarlenberg\xe2\x80\x99s and make one farm of\r\nit, the largest in all High Prairie, Low Prairie, or New Haarlem. Well,\r\nno fool like an old fool.\r\n\r\nSo insatiable was High Prairie\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity that every scrap of fresh\r\nnews was swallowed at a gulp. When the word went round of Roelf\xe2\x80\x99s flight\r\nfrom the farm, no one knew where, it served only as sauce to the great\r\ndish of gossip.\r\n\r\nSelina had known. Pervus was away at the market when Roelf had knocked\r\nat the farmhouse door one night at eight, had turned the knob and\r\nentered, as usual. But there was nothing of the usual about his\r\nappearance. He wore his best suit\xe2\x80\x94his first suit of store clothes,\r\nbought at the time of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s funeral. It never had fitted him; now\r\nwas grotesquely small for him. He had shot up amazingly in the last\r\neight or nine months. Yet there was nothing of the ridiculous about him\r\nas he stood before her now, tall, lean, dark. He put down his cheap\r\nyellow suitcase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Roelf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going away. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway. Chicago maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d He was terribly moved, so he made his tone\r\ncasual. \xe2\x80\x9cThey came home last night. I have got some books that belong to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d He made as though to open the suitcase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! Keep them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Roelf.\xe2\x80\x9d She took the boy\xe2\x80\x99s dark head in her two hands and,\r\nstanding on tiptoe, kissed him. He turned to go. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute. Wait a\r\nminute.\xe2\x80\x9d She had a few dollars\xe2\x80\x94in quarters, dimes, half\r\ndollars\xe2\x80\x94perhaps ten dollars in all\xe2\x80\x94hidden away in a canister on the\r\nshelf. She reached for it. But when she came back with the box in her\r\nhand he was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n\r\n\r\nDirk was eight; Little Sobig DeJong, in a suit made of bean-sacking\r\nsewed together by his mother. A brown blond boy with mosquito bites on\r\nhis legs and his legs never still. Nothing of the dreamer about this\r\nlad. The one-room schoolhouse of Selina\xe2\x80\x99s day had been replaced by a\r\ntwo-story brick structure, very fine, of which High Prairie was vastly\r\nproud. The rusty iron stove had been dethroned by a central heater. Dirk\r\nwent to school from October until June. Pervus protested that this was\r\nfoolish. The boy could be of great help in the fields from the beginning\r\nof April to the first of November, but Selina fought savagely for his\r\nschooling, and won.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReading and writing and figgering is what a farmer is got to know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPervus argued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rest is all foolishness. Constantinople is the\r\ncapital of Turkey he studies last night and uses good oil in the lamp.\r\nWhat good does it do a truck farmer when he knows Constantinople is the\r\ncapital of Turkey? That don\xe2\x80\x99t help him raise turnips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSobig isn\xe2\x80\x99t a truck farmer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he will be pretty soon. Time I was fifteen I was running our\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVerbally Selina did not combat this. But within her every force was\r\ngathering to fight it when the time should come. Her Sobig a truck\r\nfarmer, a slave to the soil, bent by it, beaten by it, blasted by it, so\r\nthat he, in time, like the other men of High Prairie, would take on the\r\nvery look of the rocks and earth among which they toiled!\r\n\r\nDirk, at eight, was a none too handsome child, considering his father\r\nand mother\xe2\x80\x94or his father and mother as they had been. He had, though, a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdifferent\xe2\x80\x9d look. His eyelashes were too long for a boy. Wasted, Selina\r\nsaid as she touched them with a fond forefinger, when a girl would have\r\nbeen so glad of them. He had developed, too, a slightly aquiline nose,\r\nprobably a long-jump inheritance from some Cromwellian rapscallion of\r\nthe English Peakes of a past century. It was not until he was seventeen\r\nor eighteen that he was to metamorphose suddenly into a graceful and\r\naristocratic youngster with an indefinable look about him of distinction\r\nand actual elegance. It was when Dirk was thirty that Peter Peel the\r\nEnglish tailor (of Michigan Avenue north) said he was the only man in\r\nChicago who could wear English clothes without having them look like\r\nHalsted Street. Dirk probably appeared a little startled at that, as\r\nwell he might, west Halsted Street having loomed up so large in his\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nSelina was a farm woman now, nearing thirty. The work rode her as it had\r\nridden Maartje Pool. In the DeJong yard there was always a dado of\r\nwashing, identical with the one that had greeted Selina\xe2\x80\x99s eye when first\r\nshe drove into the Pool yard years before. Faded overalls, a shirt,\r\nsocks, a boy\xe2\x80\x99s drawers grotesquely patched and mended, towels of rough\r\nsacking. She, too, rose at four, snatched up shapeless garments,\r\ninvested herself with them, seized her great coil of fine cloudy hair,\r\ntwisted it into a utilitarian knob and skewered it with a hairpin from\r\nwhich the varnish had long departed, leaving it a dull gray; thrust her\r\nslim feet into shapeless shoes, dabbed her face with cold water, hurried\r\nto the kitchen stove. The work was always at her heels, its breath hot\r\non her neck. Baskets of mending piled up, threatened to overwhelm her.\r\nOveralls, woollen shirts, drawers, socks. Socks! They lay coiled and\r\ntwisted in an old market basket. Sometimes as she sat late at night\r\nmending them, in and out, in and out, with quick fierce stabs of the\r\nneedle in her work-scarred hand, they seemed to writhe and squirm and\r\nwriggle horribly, like snakes. One of her bad dreams was that in which\r\nshe saw herself overwhelmed, drowned, swallowed up by a huge welter and\r\nboiling of undarned, unmended nightshirts, drawers, socks, aprons,\r\noveralls.\r\n\r\nSeeing her thus one would have thought that the Selina Peake of the\r\nwine-red cashmere, the fun-loving disposition, the high-spirited\r\ncourage, had departed forever. But these things still persisted. For\r\nthat matter, even the wine-red cashmere clung to existence. So\r\nhopelessly old-fashioned now as to be almost picturesque, it hung in\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s closet like a rosy memory. Sometimes when she came upon it in\r\nan orgy of cleaning she would pass her rough hands over its soft folds\r\nand by that magic process Mrs. Pervus DeJong vanished in a pouf and in\r\nher place was the girl Selina Peake perched a-tiptoe on a soap-box in\r\nAdam Ooms\xe2\x80\x99s hall while all High Prairie, open-mouthed, looked on as the\r\nimpecunious Pervus DeJong threw ten hard-earned dollars at her feet. In\r\nthrifty moments she had often thought of cutting the wine-red cashmere\r\ninto rag-rug strips; of dyeing it a sedate brown or black and\r\nremodelling it for a much-needed best dress; of fashioning it into\r\nshirts for Dirk. But she never did.\r\n\r\nIt would be gratifying to be able to record that in these eight or nine\r\nyears Selina had been able to work wonders on the DeJong farm; that the\r\nhouse glittered, the crops thrived richly, the barn housed sleek cattle.\r\nBut it could not be truthfully said. True, she had achieved some\r\nchanges, but at the cost of terrific effort. A less indomitable woman\r\nwould have sunk into apathy years before. The house had a coat of\r\npaint\xe2\x80\x94lead-gray, because it was cheapest. There were two horses\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsecond a broken-down old mare, blind in one eye, that they had picked up\r\nfor five dollars after it had been turned out to pasture for future sale\r\nas horse-carcass. Piet Pon, the mare\xe2\x80\x99s owner who drove a milk route, had\r\nhoped to get three dollars for the animal, dead. A month of rest and\r\npasturage restored the mare to usefulness. Selina had made the bargain,\r\nand Pervus had scolded her roundly for it. Now he drove the mare to\r\nmarket, saw that she pulled more sturdily than the other horse, but had\r\nnever retracted. It was no quality of meanness in him. Pervus merely was\r\nlike that.\r\n\r\nBut the west sixteen! That had been Selina\xe2\x80\x99s most heroic achievement.\r\nHer plan, spoken of to Pervus in the first month of her marriage, had\r\ntaken years to mature; even now was but a partial triumph. She had even\r\ndescended to nagging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t we put in asparagus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsparagus!\xe2\x80\x9d considered something of a luxury, and rarely included in\r\nthe High Prairie truck farmer\xe2\x80\x99s products. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd wait three years for a\r\ncrop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but then we\xe2\x80\x99d have it. And a plantation\xe2\x80\x99s good for ten years, once\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s started.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlantation! What is that? An asparagus plantation? Asparagus I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nalways heard of in beds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the old idea. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading up on it. The new way is to\r\nplant asparagus in rows, the way you would rhubarb or corn. Plant six\r\nfeet apart, and four acres anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not even sufficiently interested to be amused. \xe2\x80\x9cYeh, four acres\r\nwhere? In the clay land, maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d He did laugh then, if the short bitter\r\nsound he made could be construed as indicating mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cOut of a book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the clay land,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina urged, crisply. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd out of a book. Every\r\nfarmer in High Prairie raises cabbage, turnips, carrots, beets, beans,\r\nonions, and they\xe2\x80\x99re better quality than ours. That west sixteen isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbringing you anything, so what difference does it make if I am wrong!\r\nLet me put my own money into it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought it all out, Pervus.\r\nPlease. We\xe2\x80\x99ll under-drain the clay soil. Just five or six acres, to\r\nstart. We\xe2\x80\x99ll manure it heavily\xe2\x80\x94as much as we can afford\xe2\x80\x94and then for\r\ntwo years we\xe2\x80\x99ll plant potatoes there. We\xe2\x80\x99ll put in our asparagus plants\r\nthe third spring\xe2\x80\x94one-year-old seedlings. I\xe2\x80\x99ll promise to keep it\r\nweeded\xe2\x80\x94Dirk and I. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be a big boy by that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much manure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, twenty to forty tons to the acre\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head in slow Dutch opposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94but if you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me use humus I won\xe2\x80\x99t need that much. Let me try it,\r\nPervus. Let me try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the end she had her way, partly because Pervus was too occupied with\r\nhis own endless work to oppose her; and partly because he was, in his\r\nundemonstrative way, still in love with his vivacious, nimble-witted,\r\nhigh-spirited wife, though to her frantic goadings and proddings he was\r\nas phlegmatically oblivious as an elephant to a pin prick. Year in, year\r\nout, he maintained his slow-plodding gait, content to do as his father\r\nhad done before him; content to let the rest of High Prairie pass him on\r\nthe road. He rarely showed temper. Selina often wished he would.\r\nSometimes, in a sort of hysteria of hopelessness, she would rush at him,\r\nruffle up his thick coarse hair, now beginning to be threaded with gray;\r\nshake his great impassive shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPervus! Pervus! if you\xe2\x80\x99d only get mad\xe2\x80\x94real mad! Fly into a rage. Break\r\nthings! Beat me! Sell the farm! Run away!\xe2\x80\x9d She didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it, of\r\ncourse. It was the vital and constructive force in her resenting his\r\napathy, his acceptance of things as they were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that for dumb talk?\xe2\x80\x9d He would regard her solemnly through a\r\nhaze of smoke, his pipe making a maddening putt-putt of sleepy content.\r\n\r\nThough she worked as hard as any woman in High Prairie, had as little,\r\ndressed as badly, he still regarded her as a luxury; an exquisite toy\r\nwhich, in a moment of madness, he had taken for himself. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle\r\nLina\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94tolerantly, fondly. You would have thought that he spoiled her,\r\npampered her. Perhaps he even thought he did.\r\n\r\nWhen she spoke of modern farming, of books on vegetable gardening, he\r\ncame very near to angry impatience, though his amusement at the idea\r\nsaved him from it. College agricultural courses he designated as\r\nfoolishness. Of Linn\xc3\xa6us he had never heard. Burbank was, for him,\r\nnon-existent, and he thought head-lettuce a silly fad. Selina sometimes\r\ntalked of raising this last named green as a salad, with marketing\r\nvalue. Everyone knew that regular lettuce was leaf lettuce which you ate\r\nwith vinegar and a sprinkling of sugar, or with hot bacon and fat\r\nsopping its wilted leaves.\r\n\r\nHe said, too, she spoiled the boy. Back of this may have been a lurking\r\njealousy. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways the boy; always the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he would mutter when Selina\r\nplanned for the child; shielded him; took his part (sometimes unjustly).\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will make a softy of him with your always babying.\xe2\x80\x9d So from time to\r\ntime he undertook to harden Dirk. The result was generally disastrous.\r\nIn one case the process terminated in what was perilously near to\r\ntragedy. It was during the midsummer school vacation. Dirk was eight.\r\nThe woody slopes about High Prairie and the sand hills beyond were\r\ncovered with the rich blue of huckleberries. They were dead ripe. One\r\nshower would spoil them. Geertje and Jozina Pool were going\r\nhuckleberrying and had consented to take Dirk\xe2\x80\x94a concession, for he was\r\nonly eight and considered, at their advanced age, a tagger. But the last\r\nof the tomatoes on the DeJong place were also ripe and ready for\r\npicking. They hung, firm, juicy scarlet globes, prime for the Chicago\r\nmarket. Pervus meant to haul them to town that day. And this was work in\r\nwhich the boy could help. To Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cCan I go berrying? The\r\nhuckleberries are ripe. Geert and Jozina are going,\xe2\x80\x9d his father shook a\r\nnegative head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, well tomatoes are ripe, too, and that comes before huckleberries.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s the whole patch to clean up this afternoon by four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina looked up, glanced at Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s face, at the boy\xe2\x80\x99s, said nothing.\r\nThe look said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a child. Let him go, Pervus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk flushed with disappointment. They were at breakfast. It was barely\r\ndaybreak. He looked down at his plate, his lip quivered, his long lashes\r\nlay heavy on his cheeks. Pervus got up, wiped his mouth with the back of\r\nhis hand. There was a hard day ahead of him. \xe2\x80\x9cTime I was your age,\r\nSobig, I would think it was an easy day when all I had to do was pick a\r\ntomato patch clean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk looked up then, quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I get it all picked can I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a day\xe2\x80\x99s job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I do pick the patch\xe2\x80\x94if I get through early enough\xe2\x80\x94can I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye Pervus saw the tomato patch, more scarlet than green,\r\nso thick hung the fruit upon the bushes. He smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. You pick them\r\ntomatoes and you can go. But no throwing into the baskets and getting\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em all softed up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSecretly Selina resolved to help him, but she knew that this could not\r\nbe until afternoon. The berry patches were fully three miles from the\r\nDeJong farm. Dirk would have to finish by three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at the latest,\r\nto get there. Selina had her morning full with the housework.\r\n\r\nHe was in the patch before six; fell to work, feverishly. He picked,\r\nheaped the fruit into hillocks. The scarlet patches glowed, blood-red,\r\nin the sun. The child worked like a machine, with an economy of gesture\r\ncalculated to the fraction of an inch. He picked, stooped, heaped the\r\nmounds in the sultry heat of the August morning. The sweat stood out on\r\nhis forehead, darkened his blond hair, slid down his cheeks that were\r\npink, then red, then tinged with a purplish tone beneath the summer tan.\r\nWhen dinner time came he gulped a dozen alarming mouthfuls and was out\r\nagain in the broiling noonday glare. Selina left her dinner dishes\r\nunwashed on the table to help him, but Pervus intervened. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nto do it alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll never do it, Pervus. He\xe2\x80\x99s only eight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime I was eight\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe actually had cleared the patch by three. He went to the well and took\r\na huge draught of water; drank two great dippersful, lipping it down\r\nthirstily, like a colt. It was cool and delicious beyond belief. Then he\r\nsloshed a third and a fourth dipperful over his hot head and neck, took\r\nan empty lard pail for berries and was off down the dusty road and\r\nacross the fields, running fleetly in spite of the quivering heat waves\r\nthat seemed to dance between fiery heaven and parched earth. Selina\r\nstood in the kitchen doorway a moment, watching him. He looked very\r\nsmall and determined.\r\n\r\nHe found Geertje and Jozina, surfeited with fruit, berry stained and\r\nbramble torn, lolling languidly in Kuyper\xe2\x80\x99s woods. He began to pick the\r\nplump blue balls but he ate them listlessly, though thriftily, because\r\nthat was what he had come for and his father was Dutch. When Geertje and\r\nJozina prepared to leave not an hour after he had come he was ready to\r\ngo, yet curiously loath to move. His lard pail was half filled. He\r\ntrotted home laboriously through the late afternoon, feeling giddy and\r\nsick, with horrid pains in his head. That night he tossed in delirium,\r\nbegged not to be made lie down, came perilously near to death.\r\n\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s heart was an engine pumping terror, hate, agony through her\r\nveins. Hate for her husband who had done this to the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did it! You did it! He\xe2\x80\x99s a baby and you made him work like a man.\r\nIf anything happens to him! If anything happens to him!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think the kid would go for to do it. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask him to\r\npick and then go berrying. He said could he and I said yes. If I had\r\nsaid no it would have been wrong, too, maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re all alike. Look at Roelf Pool! They tried to make a farmer of\r\nhim, too. And ruined him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with farming? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with a farmer? You\r\nsaid farm work was grand work, once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I did. It is. It could be. It\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Oh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking\r\nlike that now! Look at him! Don\xe2\x80\x99t, Sobig! Don\xe2\x80\x99t, baby. How hot his head\r\nis! Listen! Is that Jan with the doctor? No. No, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Mustard\r\nplasters. Are you sure that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was before the day of the omnipresent farmhouse telephone and the\r\nfarmhouse Ford. Jan\xe2\x80\x99s trip to High Prairie village for the doctor and\r\nback to the farm meant a delay of hours. But within two days the boy was\r\nagain about, rather pale, but otherwise seeming none the worse for his\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThat was Pervus. Thrifty, like his kind, but unlike them in shrewdness.\r\nPenny wise, pound foolish; a characteristic that brought him his death.\r\nSeptember, usually a succession of golden days and hazy opalescent\r\nevenings on the Illinois prairie land, was disastrously cold and rainy\r\nthat year. Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s great frame was racked by rheumatism. He was forty\r\nnow, and over, still of magnificent physique, so that to see him\r\nsuffering gave Selina the pangs of pity that one has at sight of the\r\nvery strong or the very weak in pain. He drove the weary miles to market\r\nthree times a week, for September was the last big month of the truck\r\nfarmer\xe2\x80\x99s season. After that only the hardier plants survived the\r\nfrosts\xe2\x80\x94the cabbages, beets, turnips, carrots, pumpkins, squash. The\r\nroads in places were morasses of mud into which the wheels were likely\r\nto sink to the hubs. Once stuck you had often to wait for a friendly\r\npassing team to haul you out. Pervus would start early, detour for miles\r\nin order to avoid the worst places. Jan was too stupid, too old, too\r\ninexpert to be trusted with the Haymarket trading. Selina would watch\r\nPervus drive off down the road in the creaking old market wagon, the\r\ngreen stuff protected by canvas, but Pervus wet before ever he climbed\r\ninto the seat. There never seemed to be enough waterproof canvas for\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPervus, take it off those sacks and put it over your shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s them white globe onions. The last of \xe2\x80\x99em. I can get a fancy\r\nprice for them but not if they\xe2\x80\x99re all wetted down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t sleep on the wagon to-night, Pervus. Sleep in. Be sure. It saves\r\nin the end. You know the last time you were laid up for a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll clear. Breaking now over there in the west.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clouds did break late in the afternoon; the false sun came out hot\r\nand bright. Pervus slept out in the Haymarket, for the night was close\r\nand humid. At midnight the lake wind sprang up, cold and treacherous,\r\nand with it came the rain again. Pervus was drenched by morning,\r\nchilled, thoroughly miserable. A hot cup of coffee at four and another\r\nat ten when the rush of trading was over stimulated him but little. When\r\nhe reached home it was mid-afternoon. Beneath the bronze wrought by the\r\nwind and sun of many years the gray-white of sickness shone dully, like\r\nsilver under enamel. Selina put him to bed against his half-hearted\r\nprotests. Banked him with hot water jars, a hot iron wrapped in flannel\r\nat his feet. But later came fever instead of the expected relief of\r\nperspiration. Ill though he was he looked more ruddy and hale than most\r\nmen in health; but suddenly Selina, startled, saw black lines like\r\ngashes etched under his eyes, about his mouth, in his cheeks.\r\n\r\nIn a day when pneumonia was known as lung fever and in a locality that\r\nadvised closed windows and hot air as a remedy, Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s battle was lost\r\nbefore the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s hooded buggy was seen standing in the yard for long\r\nhours through the night. Toward morning the doctor had Jan Steen stable\r\nthe horse. It was a sultry night, with flashes of heat lightning in the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think if you opened the windows,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said to the old High\r\nPrairie doctor over and over, emboldened by terror, \xe2\x80\x9cit would help him\r\nto breathe. He\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s breathing so\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s breathing so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She could not\r\nbring herself to say so terribly. The sound of the words wrung her as\r\ndid the sound of his terrible breathing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most poignant and touching feature of the days that followed\r\nwas not the sight of this stricken giant, lying majestic and aloof in\r\nhis unwonted black; nor of the boy Dirk, mystified but elated, too, with\r\nthe unaccustomed stir and excitement; nor of the shabby little farm that\r\nseemed to shrink and dwindle into further insignificance beneath the\r\nsudden publicity turned upon it. No; it was the sight of Selina,\r\nwidowed, but having no time for decent tears. The farm was there; it\r\nmust be tended. Illness, death, sorrow\xe2\x80\x94the garden must be tended, the\r\nvegetables pulled, hauled to market, sold. Upon the garden depended the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s future, and hers.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days following the funeral one or another of the\r\nneighbouring farmers drove the DeJong team to market, aided the\r\nblundering Jan in the fields. But each had his hands full with his own\r\nfarm work. On the fifth day Jan Steen had to take the garden truck to\r\nChicago, though not without many misgivings on Selina\xe2\x80\x99s part, all of\r\nwhich were realized when he returned late next day with half the load\r\nstill on his wagon and a sum of money representing exactly zero in\r\nprofits. The wilted left-over vegetables were dumped behind the barn to\r\nbe used later as fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t do so good this time,\xe2\x80\x9d Jan explained, \xe2\x80\x9con account I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nno right place in the market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou started early enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they kind of crowded me out, like. They see I was a new hand and\r\ntime I got the animals stabled and come back they had the wagon crowded\r\nout, like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina was standing in the kitchen doorway, Jan in the yard with the\r\nteam. She turned her face toward the fields. An observant person (Jan\r\nSteen was not one of these) would have noted the singularly determined\r\nand clear-cut jaw-line of this drably calicoed farm woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go myself Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJan stared. \xe2\x80\x9cGo? Go where, Monday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this seeming pleasantry Jan Steen smiled uncertainly, shrugged his\r\nshoulders, and was off to the barn. She was always saying things that\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. His horror and unbelief were shared by the rest of\r\nHigh Prairie when on Monday Selina literally took the reins in her own\r\nslim work-scarred hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo market!\xe2\x80\x9d argued Jan as excitedly as his phlegmatic nature would\r\npermit. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman she don\xe2\x80\x99t go to market. A woman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis woman does.\xe2\x80\x9d Selina had risen at three in the morning. Not only\r\nthat, she had got Jan up, grumbling. Dirk had joined them in the fields\r\nat five. Together the three of them had pulled and bunched a wagon load.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSize them,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina ordered, as they started to bunch radishes, beets,\r\nturnips, carrots. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t leave them loose like that. Tie them tight\r\nat the heads, like this. Twice around with the string, and through. Make\r\nbouquets of them, not bunches. And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to scrub them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHigh Prairie washed its vegetables desultorily; sometimes not at all.\r\nHiggledy piggledy, large and small, they were bunched and sold as\r\nvegetables, not objets d\xe2\x80\x99art. Generally there was a tan crust of good\r\nearth coating them which the housewife could scrub off at her own\r\nkitchen sink. What else had housewives to do!\r\n\r\nSelina, scrubbing the carrots vigorously under the pump, thought they\r\nemerged from their unaccustomed bath looking like clustered spears of\r\npure gold. She knew better, though, than to say this in Jan\xe2\x80\x99s hearing.\r\nJan, by now, was sullen with bewilderment. He refused to believe that\r\nshe actually intended to carry out her plan. A woman\xe2\x80\x94a High Prairie\r\nfarmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x94driving to market like a man! Alone at night in the\r\nmarket place\xe2\x80\x94or at best in one of the cheap rooming houses! By Sunday\r\nsomehow, mysteriously, the news had filtered through the district. High\r\nPrairie attended the Dutch Reformed church with a question hot on its\r\ntongue and Selina did not attend the morning services. A fine state of\r\nthings, and she a widow of a week! High Prairie called at the DeJong\r\nfarm on Sunday afternoon and was told that the widow was over in the wet\r\nwest sixteen, poking about with the boy Dirk at her heels.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Dekker appeared late Sunday afternoon on his way to evening\r\nservice. A dour dominie, the Reverend Dekker, and one whose talents were\r\nanachronistic. He would have been invaluable in the days when New York\r\nwas New Amsterdam. But the second and third generations of High Prairie\r\nDutch were beginning to chafe under his old-world r\xc3\xa9gime. A hard blue\r\neye, had the Reverend Dekker, and a fanatic one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this talk I hear, Mrs. DeJong, that you are going to the\r\nHaymarket with the garden stuff, a woman alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirk goes with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are doing, Mrs. DeJong. The Haymarket is no\r\nplace for a decent woman. As for the boy! There is card-playing,\r\ndrinking\xe2\x80\x94all manner of wickedness\xe2\x80\x94daughters of Jezebel on the street,\r\ngoing among the wagons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally!\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina. It sounded thrilling, after twelve years on the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe vegetables are rotting in the ground. And Dirk and I must live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember the two sparrows. \xe2\x80\x98One of them shall not fall on the ground\r\nwithout\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Matthew X-29.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Selina, simply, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat good that does the sparrow,\r\nonce it\xe2\x80\x99s fallen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy Monday afternoon the parlour curtains of every High Prairie farmhouse\r\nthat faced the Halsted road were agitated as though by a brisk wind\r\nbetween the hours of three and five, when the market wagons were to be\r\nseen moving toward Chicago. Klaas Pool at dinner that noon had spoken of\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s contemplated trip with a mingling of pity and disapproval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t decent a woman should drive to market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Klaas Pool (they still spoke of her as the Widow Paarlenberg)\r\nsmiled her slippery crooked smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could you expect! Look how\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s always acted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKlaas did not follow this. He was busy with his own train of thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t seem hardly possible. Time she come here school teacher I\r\ndrove her out and she was like a little robin or what, set up on the\r\nseat. She says, I remember like yesterday, cabbages was beautiful. I bet\r\nshe learned different by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. So little had Selina learned in these past eleven years\r\nthat now, having loaded the wagon in the yard she surveyed it with more\r\nsparkle in her eye than High Prairie would have approved in a widow of\r\nlittle more than a week. They had picked and bunched only the best of\r\nthe late crop\xe2\x80\x94the firmest reddest radishes, the roundest juiciest\r\nbeets; the carrots that tapered a good seven inches from base to tip;\r\nkraut cabbages of the drumhead variety that were flawless green balls;\r\nfirm juicy spears of cucumber; cauliflower (of her own planting; Pervus\r\nhad opposed it) that looked like a bride\xe2\x80\x99s bouquet. Selina stepped back\r\nnow and regarded this riot of crimson and green, of white and gold and\r\npurple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t they beautiful! Dirk, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk, capering in his excitement at the prospect of the trip before him,\r\nshook his head impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything beautiful.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina flung out her arms. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\xe2\x80\x94the whole wagon load. The cabbages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go, Mother. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t we\r\ngoing now? You said as soon as the load was on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Sobig, you\xe2\x80\x99re just exactly like your\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike my what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go now, son. There\xe2\x80\x99s cold meat for your supper, Jan, and potatoes\r\nall sliced for frying and half an apple pie left from noon. Wash your\r\ndishes\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t leave them cluttering around the kitchen. You ought to get\r\nin the rest of the squash and pumpkins by evening. Maybe I can sell the\r\nlot instead of taking them in by the load. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see a commission man.\r\nTake less, if I have to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had dressed the boy in his home-made suit cut down from one of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s. He wore a wide-brimmed straw hat which he hated. Selina had\r\nmade him an overcoat of stout bean-sacking and this she tucked under the\r\nwagon seat, together with an old black fascinator, for though the\r\nSeptember afternoon was white-hot she knew that the evenings were likely\r\nto be chilly, once the sun, a great crimson Chinese balloon, had burned\r\nitself out in a blaze of flame across the prairie horizon. Selina\r\nherself, in a full-skirted black-stuff dress, mounted the wagon agilely,\r\ntook up the reins, looked down at the boy seated beside her, clucked to\r\nthe horses. Jan Steen gave vent to a final outraged bellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever in my life did I hear of such a thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina turned the horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads toward the city. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised,\r\nJan, to know of all the things you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear of some day that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of before.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, when twenty years had passed and\r\nthe Ford, the phonograph, the radio, and the rural mail delivery had\r\ndumped the world at Jan\xe2\x80\x99s plodding feet he liked to tell of that\r\nmomentous day when Selina DeJong had driven off to market like a man\r\nwith a wagon load of hand-scrubbed garden truck and the boy Dirk perched\r\nbeside her on the seat.\r\n\r\nIf, then, you had been travelling the Halsted road, you would have seen\r\na decrepit wagon, vegetable-laden, driven by a too-thin woman, sallow,\r\nbright-eyed, in a shapeless black dress, a battered black felt hat that\r\nlooked like a man\xe2\x80\x99s old \xe2\x80\x9cfedora\xe2\x80\x9d and probably was. Her hair was\r\nunbecomingly strained away from the face with its high cheek bones, so\r\nthat unless you were really observant you failed to notice the exquisite\r\nlittle nose or the really fine eyes so unnaturally large now in the\r\nanxious face. On the seat beside her you would have seen a farm boy of\r\nnine or thereabouts\xe2\x80\x94a brown freckle-faced lad in a comically home-made\r\nsuit of clothes and a straw hat with a broken and flopping brim which he\r\nwas forever jerking off only to have it set firmly on again by the woman\r\nwho seemed to fear the effects of the hot afternoon sun on his\r\nclose-cropped head. But in the brief intervals when the hat was off you\r\nmust have noted how the boy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were shining.\r\n\r\nAt their feet was the dog Pom, a mongrel whose tail bore no relation to\r\nhis head, whose ill-assorted legs appeared wholly at variance with his\r\nsturdy barrel of a body. He dozed now, for it had been his duty to watch\r\nthe wagon load at night, while Pervus slept.\r\n\r\nA shabby enough little outfit, but magnificent, too. Here was Selina\r\nDeJong driving up the Halsted road toward the city instead of sitting,\r\nblack-robed, in the farm parlour while High Prairie came to condole. In\r\nSelina, as they jogged along the hot dusty way, there welled up a\r\nfeeling very like elation. Conscious of this, the New England strain in\r\nher took her to task. \xe2\x80\x9cSelina Peake, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you ashamed of yourself!\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a wicked woman! Feeling almost gay when you ought to be\r\nsad. . . . Poor Pervus . . . the farm . . . Dirk . . . and you can feel\r\nalmost gay! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, and knew it. For even as she thought this the little\r\nwave of elation came flooding over her again. More than ten years ago\r\nshe had driven with Klaas Pool up that same road for the first time, and\r\nin spite of the recent tragedy of her father\xe2\x80\x99s death, her youth, her\r\nloneliness, the terrifying thought of the new home to which she was\r\ngoing, a stranger among strangers, she had been conscious of a warm\r\nlittle thrill of elation, of excitement\xe2\x80\x94of adventure! That was it. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nwhole thing\xe2\x80\x99s just a grand adventure,\xe2\x80\x9d her father, Simeon Peake, had\r\nsaid. And now the sensations of that day were repeating themselves. Now,\r\nas then, she was doing what was considered a revolutionary and daring\r\nthing; a thing that High Prairie regarded with horror. And now, as then,\r\nshe took stock. Youth was gone, but she had health, courage; a boy of\r\nnine; twenty-five acres of wornout farm land; dwelling and out-houses in\r\na bad state of repair; and a gay adventuresome spirit that was never to\r\ndie, though it led her into curious places and she often found, at the\r\nend, only a trackless waste from which she had to retrace her steps\r\npainfully. But always, to her, red and green cabbages were to be jade\r\nand burgundy, chrysoprase and porphyry. Life has no weapons against a\r\nwoman like that.\r\n\r\nAnd the wine-red cashmere. She laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you laughing at, Mom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat sobered her. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing, Sobig. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was laughing. I\r\nwas just thinking about a red dress I had when I first came to High\r\nPrairie a girl. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that to laugh at?\xe2\x80\x9d He was following a yellow-hammer with his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Mother said it was nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWisht I\xe2\x80\x99d brought my sling-shot.\xe2\x80\x9d The yellow-hammer was perched on the\r\nfence by the roadside not ten feet away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSobig, you promised me you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t throw at any more birds, ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hit it. I would just like to aim at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDown the hot dusty country road. She was serious enough now. The cost of\r\nthe funeral to be paid. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s bills. Jan\xe2\x80\x99s wage. All the\r\nexpenses, large and small, of the poor little farm holding. Nothing to\r\nlaugh at, certainly. The boy was wiser than she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Pool on her porch, Mom. Rocking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere, indeed, was the erstwhile Widow Paarlenberg on her porch,\r\nrocking. A pleasant place to be in mid-afternoon of a hot September day.\r\nShe stared at the creaking farm wagon, vegetable laden; at the boy\r\nperched on the high seat; at the sallow shabby woman who was charioteer\r\nfor the whole crazy outfit. Mrs. Klaas Pool\xe2\x80\x99s pink face creased in a\r\nsmile. She sat forward in her chair and ceased to rock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you going this hot day, Mis\xe2\x80\x99 DeJong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina sat up very straight. \xe2\x80\x9cTo Bagdad, Mrs. Pool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo\xe2\x80\x94Where\xe2\x80\x99s that? What for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo sell my jewels, Mrs. Pool. And to see Aladdin, and Harun-al-Rashid\r\nand Ali Baba. And the Forty Thieves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Pool had left her rocker and had come down the steps. The wagon\r\ncreaked on past her gate. She took a step or two down the path, and\r\ncalled after them. \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard of it. Bag\xe2\x80\x94How do you get there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOver her shoulder Selina called out from the wagon seat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just go\r\nuntil you come to a closed door. And you say \xe2\x80\x98Open Sesame!\xe2\x80\x99 and there\r\nyou are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBewilderment shadowed Mrs. Pool\xe2\x80\x99s placid face. As the wagon lurched on\r\ndown the road it was Selina who was smiling and Mrs. Pool who was\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nThe boy, round eyed, was looking up at his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s out of\r\n_Arabian Nights_, what you said. Why did you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d Suddenly\r\nexcitement tinged his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s out of the book. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit! We\xe2\x80\x99re not really\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was a little contrite, but not very. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, not really, perhaps. But\r\n\xe2\x80\x99most any place is Bagdad if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will happen in it. And\r\nthis is an adventure, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going on? How can you tell!\r\nAll kind of things can happen. All kinds of people. People in disguise\r\nin the Haymarket. Caliphs, and princes, and slaves, and thieves, and\r\ngood fairies, and witches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Haymarket! That Pop went to all the time! That is just dumb\r\ntalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithin Selina something cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Sobig! Don\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn down the road. Here a head at a front room window. There a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncalicoed figure standing in the doorway. Mrs. Vander Sijde on the porch,\r\nfanning her flushed face with her apron; Cornelia Snip in the yard\r\npretending to tie up the drooping stalks of the golden-glow and eyeing\r\nthe approaching team with the avid gossip\xe2\x80\x99s gaze. To these Selina waved,\r\nbowed, called.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you do, Mrs. Vander Sijde!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA prim reply to this salutation. Disapproval writ large on the\r\nfarm-wife\xe2\x80\x99s flushed face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Cornelia!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pretended start, notable for its bad acting. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, is it you, Mrs.\r\nDeJong! Sun\xe2\x80\x99s in my eyes. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was you like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWomen\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, hostile, cold, peering.\r\n\r\nFive o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Six. The boy climbed over the wheel, filled a tin pail\r\nwith water at a farmhouse well. They ate and drank as they rode along,\r\nfor there was no time to lose. Bread and meat and pickles and pie. There\r\nwere vegetables in the wagon, ripe for eating. There were other\r\nvarieties that Selina might have cooked at home in preparation for this\r\nmeal\xe2\x80\x94German celery root boiled tender and soaked in vinegar; red beets,\r\npickled; onions; coleslaw; beans. They would have regarded these with an\r\napathetic eye all too familiar with the sight of them. Selina knew now\r\nwhy the Pools\xe2\x80\x99 table, in her school-teacher days, had been so lacking in\r\nthe green stuff she had craved. The thought of cooking the spinach which\r\nshe had planted, weeded, spaded, tended, picked, washed, bunched, filled\r\nher with a nausea of distaste such as she might have experienced at the\r\ncontemplation of cannibalism.\r\n\r\nThe boy had started out bravely enough in the heat of the day, sitting\r\nup very straight beside his mother, calling to the horses, shrieking and\r\nwaving his arms at chickens that flew squawking across the road. Now he\r\nbegan to droop. Evening was coming on. A cool blanket of air from the\r\nlake on the east enveloped them with the suddenness characteristic of\r\nthe region, and the mist began to drift across the prairie, softening\r\nthe autumn stubble, cooling the dusty road, misting the parched willows\r\nby the roadside, hazing the shabby squat farmhouses.\r\n\r\nShe brushed away the crumbs, packed the remaining bread and meat\r\nthriftily into the basket and covered it with a napkin against the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuture hunger should he waken in the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleepy, Sobig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Should say not.\xe2\x80\x9d His lids were heavy. His face and body, relaxed,\r\ntook on the soft baby contours that come with weariness. The sun was\r\nlow. Sunset gloried the west in a final flare of orange and crimson.\r\nDusk. The boy drooped against her heavy, sagging. She wrapped the old\r\nblack fascinator about him. He opened his eyes, tugged at the wrapping\r\nabout his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t want the old thing . . . fas\xe2\x80\x99nator . . .\r\nlike a girl . . .\xe2\x80\x9d drooped again with a sigh and found the soft curve\r\nwhere her side just cushioned his head. In the twilight the dust gleamed\r\nwhite on weeds, and brush, and grass. The far-off mellow sonance of a\r\ncowbell. Horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs clopping up behind them, a wagon passing in a\r\ncloud of dust, a curious backward glance, or a greeting exchanged.\r\n\r\nOne of the Ooms boys, or Jakob Boomsma. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re never going to market,\r\nMis\xe2\x80\x99 DeJong!\xe2\x80\x9d staring with china-blue eyes at her load.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am, Mr. Boomsma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ain\xe2\x80\x99t work for a woman, Mis\xe2\x80\x99 DeJong. You better stay home and let\r\nthe men folks go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s men folks looked up at her\xe2\x80\x94one with the asking eyes of a\r\nchild, one with the trusting eyes of a dog. \xe2\x80\x9cMy men folks are going,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Selina. But then, they had always thought her a little queer,\r\nso it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter much.\r\n\r\nShe urged the horses on, refusing to confess to herself her dread of the\r\ndestination which they were approaching. Lights now, in the houses along\r\nthe way, and those houses closer together. She wrapped the reins around\r\nthe whip, and holding the sleeping boy with one hand reached beneath the\r\nseat with the other for the coat of sacking. This she placed around him\r\nsnugly, folded an empty sack for a pillow, and lifting the boy in her\r\narms laid him gently on the lumpy bed formed by the bags of potatoes\r\npiled up just behind the seat in the back of the wagon. So the boy\r\nslept. Night had come on.\r\n\r\nThe figure of the woman drooped a little now as the old wagon creaked on\r\ntoward Chicago. A very small figure in the black dress and a shawl over\r\nher shoulders. She had taken off her old black felt hat. The breeze\r\nruffled her hair that was fine and soft, and it made a little halo about\r\nthe white face that gleamed almost luminously in the darkness as she\r\nturned it up toward the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep out with Sobig in the wagon. It won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt either of us. It\r\nwill be warm in town, there in the Haymarket. Twenty-five cents\xe2\x80\x94maybe\r\nfifty for the two of us, in the rooming house. Fifty cents just to\r\nsleep. It takes hours of work in the fields to make fifty cents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was sleepy now. The night air was deliciously soft and soothing. In\r\nher nostrils was the smell of the fields, of grass dew-wet, of damp\r\ndust, of cattle; the pungent prick of goldenrod, and occasionally a\r\nscented wave that meant wild phlox in a near-by ditch. She sniffed all\r\nthis gratefully, her mind and body curiously alert to sounds, scents,\r\nforms even, in the darkness. She had suffered much in the past week; had\r\neaten and slept but little. Had known terror, bewilderment, agony,\r\nshock. Now she was relaxed, receptive, a little light-headed perhaps,\r\nwhat with under-feeding and tears and over-work. The racking process had\r\ncleared brain and bowels; had washed her spiritually clean; had\r\nquickened her perceptions abnormally. Now she was like a delicate and\r\nsensitive electric instrument keyed to receive and register; vibrating\r\nto every ether wave.\r\n\r\nShe drove along in the dark, a dowdy farm woman in shapeless garments;\r\njust a bundle on the rickety seat of a decrepit truck wagon. The boy\r\nslept on his hard lumpy bed like the little vegetable that he was. The\r\nfarm lights went out. The houses were blurs in the black. The lights of\r\nthe city came nearer. She was thinking clearly, if disconnectedly,\r\nwithout bitterness, without reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father was wrong. He said that life was a great adventure\xe2\x80\x94a fine\r\nshow. He said the more things that happen to you the richer you are,\r\neven if they\xe2\x80\x99re not pleasant things. That\xe2\x80\x99s living, he said. No matter\r\nwhat happens to you, good or bad, it\xe2\x80\x99s just so much\xe2\x80\x94what was that word\r\nhe used?\xe2\x80\x94so much\xe2\x80\x94oh, yes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98velvet.\xe2\x80\x99 Just so much velvet. Well, it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t true. He had brains, and charm, and knowledge and he died in a\r\ngambling house, shot while looking on at some one else who was to have\r\nbeen killed. . . . Now we\xe2\x80\x99re on the cobblestones. Will Dirk wake up? My\r\nlittle So Big. . . . No, he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep. Asleep on a pile of potato sacks\r\nbecause his mother thought that life was a grand adventure\xe2\x80\x94a fine\r\nshow\xe2\x80\x94and that you took it as it came. A lie! I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken it as it came\r\nand made the best of it. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way. You take the best, and make\r\nthe most of it . . . Thirty-fifth Street, that was. Another hour and a\r\nhalf to reach the Haymarket. . . . I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid. After all, you just\r\nsell your vegetables for what you can get. . . . Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be\r\ndifferent with him. I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t call him Sobig any more. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nit. Dirk. That\xe2\x80\x99s a fine name. Dirk DeJong. . . . No drifting along for\r\nhim. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that he starts with a plan, and follows it. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nevery chance. Every chance. Too late for me, now, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ndifferent. . . . Twenty-second Street . . . Twelfth . . . Look at all\r\nthe people! . . . I\xe2\x80\x99m enjoying this. No use denying it. I\xe2\x80\x99m enjoying\r\nthis. Just as I enjoyed driving along with Klaas Pool that evening,\r\nyears and years ago. Scared, but enjoying it. Perhaps I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94but that\xe2\x80\x99s hypocritical and sneaking. Why not, if I really do enjoy\r\nit! I\xe2\x80\x99ll wake him. . . . Dirk! Dirk, we\xe2\x80\x99re almost there. Look at all the\r\npeople, and the lights. We\xe2\x80\x99re almost there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy awoke, raised himself from his bed of sacking, looked about,\r\nblinked, sank back again and curled into a ball. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t want to see the\r\nlights . . . people . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was asleep again. Selina guided the horses skilfully through the\r\ndowntown streets. She looked about with wide ambient eyes. Other wagons\r\npassed her. There was a line of them ahead of her. The men looked at her\r\ncuriously. They called to one another, and jerked a thumb in her\r\ndirection, but she paid no heed. She decided, though, to have the boy on\r\nthe seat beside her. They were within two blocks of the Haymarket, on\r\nRandolph Street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirk! Come, now. Come up here with mother.\xe2\x80\x9d Grumbling, he climbed to\r\nthe seat, yawned, smacked his lips, rubbed his knuckles into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we here for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we can sell the garden truck and earn money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo send you to school to learn things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s funny. I go to school already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA different school. A big school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was fully awake now, and looking about him interestedly. They turned\r\ninto the Haymarket. It was a tangle of horses, carts, men. The wagons\r\nwere streaming in from the German truck farms that lay to the north of\r\nChicago as well as from the Dutch farms that lay to the southwest,\r\nwhence Selina came. Fruits and vegetables\xe2\x80\x94tons of it\xe2\x80\x94acres of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94piled in the wagons that blocked the historic square. An unarmed\r\narmy bringing food to feed a great city. Through this little section,\r\nand South Water Street that lay to the east, passed all the verdant\r\ngrowing things that fed Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s millions. Something of this came to\r\nSelina as she man\xc5\x93uvred her way through the throng. She felt a little\r\nthrill of significance, of achievement. She knew the spot she wanted for\r\nher own. Since that first trip to Chicago with Pervus in the early days\r\nof her marriage she had made the journey into town perhaps not more than\r\na dozen times, but she had seen, and heard, and remembered. A place near\r\nthe corner of Des Plaines, not at the curb, but rather in the double\r\nline of wagons that extended down the middle of the road. Here the\r\npurchasing pedlers and grocers had easy access to the wagons. Here\r\nSelina could display her wares to the best advantage. It was just across\r\nthe way from Chris Spanknoebel\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant, rooming house, and saloon.\r\nChris knew her; had known Pervus for years and his father before him;\r\nwould be kind to her and the boy in case of need.\r\n\r\nDirk was wide awake now; eager, excited. The lights, the men, the\r\nhorses, the sound of talk, and laughter, and clinking glasses from the\r\neating houses along the street were bewilderingly strange to his\r\ncountry-bred eyes and ears. He called to the horses; stood up in the\r\nwagon; but clung closer to her as they found themselves in the thick of\r\nthe m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e.\r\n\r\nOn the street corners where the lights were brightest there were stands\r\nat which men sold chocolate, cigars, collar buttons, suspenders, shoe\r\nstrings, patent contrivances. It was like a fair. Farther down the men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaces loomed mysteriously out of the half light. Stolid, sunburned faces\r\nnow looked dark, terrifying, the whites of the eyes very white, the\r\nmustaches very black, their shoulders enormous. Here was a crap game\r\nbeneath the street light. There stood two girls laughing and chatting\r\nwith a policeman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a good place, Mother. Here! There\xe2\x80\x99s a dog on that wagon like\r\nPom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPom, hearing his name, stood up, looked into the boy\xe2\x80\x99s face, quivered,\r\nwagged a nervous tail, barked sharply. The Haymarket night life was an\r\nold story to Pom, but it never failed to stimulate him. Often he had\r\nguarded the wagon when Pervus was absent for a short time. He would\r\nstand on the seat ready to growl at any one who so much as fingered a\r\nradish in Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown, Pom! Quiet, Pom!\xe2\x80\x9d She did not want to attract attention to\r\nherself and the boy. It was still early. She had made excellent time.\r\nPervus had often slept in snatches as he drove into town and the horses\r\nhad lagged, but Selina had urged them on to-night. They had gained a\r\ngood half hour over the usual time. Halfway down the block Selina espied\r\nthe place she wanted. From the opposite direction came a truck farmer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncart obviously making for the same stand. For the first time that night\r\nSelina drew the whip out of its socket and clipped sharply her surprised\r\nnags. With a start and a shuffle they broke into an awkward lope. Ten\r\nseconds too late the German farmer perceived her intention, whipped up\r\nhis own tired team, arrived at the spot just as Selina, blocking the\r\nway, prepared to back into the vacant space.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeh, get out of there you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he roared; then, for the first time,\r\nperceived in the dim light of the street that his rival was a woman. He\r\nfaltered, stared open-mouthed, tried other tactics. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t go in\r\nthere, missus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I can.\xe2\x80\x9d She backed her team dexterously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we can!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Dirk in an attitude of fierce belligerence.\r\n\r\nFrom the wagons on either side heads were lifted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndemanded the defeated driver, glaring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Selina; put her hand on Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\nThe other, preparing to drive on, received this with incredulity. He\r\nassumed the existence of a husband in the neighbourhood\xe2\x80\x94at Chris\r\nSpanknoebel\xe2\x80\x99s probably, or talking prices with a friend at another wagon\r\nwhen he should be here attending to his own. In the absence of this, her\r\nnatural protector, he relieved his disgruntled feelings as he gathered\r\nup the reins. \xe2\x80\x9cWoman ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no business here in Haymarket, anyway.\r\nBetter you\xe2\x80\x99re home night time in your kitchen where you belong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis admonition, so glibly mouthed by so many people in the past few\r\ndays, now was uttered once too often. Selina\xe2\x80\x99s nerves snapped. A\r\nsurprised German truck farmer found himself being harangued from the\r\ndriver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of a vegetable wagon by an irate and fluent woman in a\r\nmashed black hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me like that, you great stupid! What good does it do a\r\nwoman to stay home in her kitchen if she\xe2\x80\x99s going to starve there, and\r\nher boy with her! Staying home in my kitchen won\xe2\x80\x99t earn me any money.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m here to sell the vegetables I helped raise and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do it.\r\nGet out of my way, you. Go along about your business or I\xe2\x80\x99ll report you\r\nto Mike, the street policeman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow she clambered over the wagon wheel to unhitch the tired horses. It\r\nis impossible to tell what interpretation the dumfounded north-sider put\r\nupon her movements. Certainly he had nothing to fear from this small\r\ngaunt creature with the blazing eyes. Nevertheless as he gathered up his\r\nreins terror was writ large on his rubicund face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Teufel!_ What a woman!\xe2\x80\x9d Was off in a clatter of wheels and hoofs on\r\nthe cobblestones.\r\n\r\nSelina unharnessed swiftly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou stay here, Dirk, with Pom. Mother\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nback in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d She marched down the street driving the horses to the\r\nbarns where, for twenty-five cents, the animals were to be housed in\r\nmore comfort than their owner. She returned to find Dirk deep in\r\nconversation with two young women in red shirtwaists, plaid skirts that\r\nswept the ground, and sailor hats tipped at a saucy angle over pyramidal\r\npompadours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense out of it, can you, Elsie? Sounds like Dirt to\r\nme, but nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to name a kid that, are they? Stands to reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come on. Your name\xe2\x80\x99ll be mud first thing you know. Here it\xe2\x80\x99s after\r\nnine already and not a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she turned and saw Selina\xe2\x80\x99s white face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk, triumphantly, pointing. The three women\r\nlooked at each other. Two saw the pathetic hat and the dowdy clothes,\r\nand knew. One saw the red shirtwaists and the loose red lips, and knew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe was just talking to the kid,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl who had been puzzled by\r\nDirk\xe2\x80\x99s name. Her tone was defensive. \xe2\x80\x9cJust asking him his name, and like\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name is Dirk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, mildly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a Dutch name\xe2\x80\x94Holland,\r\nyou know. We\xe2\x80\x99re from out High Prairie way, south. Dirk DeJong. I\xe2\x80\x99m Mrs.\r\nDeJong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other girl. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Elsie. Elsie from Chelsea, that\xe2\x80\x99s me.\r\nCome on, Mabel. Stand gabbin\xe2\x80\x99 all night.\xe2\x80\x9d She was blonde and shrill. The\r\nother was older, dark-haired. There was about her a paradoxical\r\nwholesomeness.\r\n\r\nMabel, the older one, looked at Selina sharply. From the next wagon came\r\nloud snores issuing from beneath the seat. From down the line where a\r\nlantern swung from the tailboard of a cart came the rattle of dice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you doing down here, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here to sell my stuff to-morrow morning. Vegetables. From the\r\nfarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMabel looked around. Hers was not a quick mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband died a week ago.\xe2\x80\x9d Selina was making up their bed for the\r\nnight. From beneath the seat she took a sack of hay, tight-packed, shook\r\nout its contents, spread them evenly on the floor of the wagon, at the\r\nfront, first having unhinged the seat and clapped it against the wagon\r\nside as a headboard. Over the hay she spread empty sacking. She shook\r\nout her shawl, which would serve as cover. The girl Mabel beheld these\r\npreparations. Her dull eyes showed a gleam of interest which deepened to\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, you ain\xe2\x80\x99t never going to sleep out here, are you? You and the kid.\r\nLike that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stared, turned to go, came back. From her belt that\r\ndipped so stylishly in the front hung an arsenal of jangling metal\r\narticles\xe2\x80\x94purse, pencil, mirror, comb\xe2\x80\x94a chatelaine, they called it. She\r\nopened the purse now and took from it a silver dollar. This she tendered\r\nSelina, almost roughly. \xe2\x80\x9cHere. Get the kid a decent roost for the night.\r\nYou and the kid, see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina stared at the shining round dollar; at Mabel\xe2\x80\x99s face. The quick\r\nsting of tears came to her eyes. She shook her head, smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind sleeping out here. Thank you just the same\xe2\x80\x94Mabel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl put her dollar plumply back into her purse. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, takes all\r\nkinds, I always say. I thought I had a bum deal but, say, alongside of\r\nwhat you got I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got it so worse. Place to sleep in, anyways, even\r\nif it is\xe2\x80\x94well, good-night. Listen to that Elsie, hollering for me. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ncomin\xe2\x80\x99! Shut up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou heard the two on their way up the street, arm in arm, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome Dirk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we going to sleep here!\xe2\x80\x9d He was delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight here, all snug in the hay, like campers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy lay down, wriggling, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cLike gypsies. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Mom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\xe2\x80\x99 Dirk\xe2\x80\x94not \xe2\x80\x98ain\xe2\x80\x99t it\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d The school teacher.\r\n\r\nShe lay down beside him. The boy seemed terribly wide awake. \xe2\x80\x9cI liked\r\nthe Mabel one best, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? She was the nicest, h\xe2\x80\x99m?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, much the nicest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, and put one arm around him and drew\r\nhim to her, close. And suddenly he was asleep, deeply. The street became\r\nquieter. The talking and laughter ceased. The lights were dim at Chris\r\nSpanknoebel\xe2\x80\x99s. Now and then the clatter of wheels and horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs\r\nproclaimed a late comer seeking a place, but the sound was not near by,\r\nfor this block and those to east and west were filled by now. These men\r\nhad been up at four that morning, must be up before four the next.\r\n\r\nThe night was cool, but not cold. Overhead you saw the wide strip of sky\r\nbetween the brick buildings on either side of the street. Two men came\r\nalong singing. \xe2\x80\x9cShut up!\xe2\x80\x9d growled a voice from a wagon along the curb.\r\nThe singers subsided. It must be ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock and after, Selina thought.\r\nShe had with her Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s nickel watch, but it was too dark to see its\r\nface, and she did not want to risk a match. Measured footsteps that\r\npassed and repassed at regular intervals. The night policeman.\r\n\r\nShe lay looking up at the sky. There were no tears in her eyes. She was\r\npast tears. She thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, Selina Peake, sleeping in a wagon,\r\nin the straw, like a bitch with my puppy snuggled beside me. I was going\r\nto be like Jo in Louisa Alcott\xe2\x80\x99s book. On my feet are boots and on my\r\nbody a dyed dress. How terribly long it is going to be until morning\r\n. . . I must try to sleep. . . . I must try to sleep . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did sleep, miraculously. The September stars twinkled brightly down\r\non them. As she lay there, the child in her arms, asleep, peace came to\r\nthe haggard face, relaxed the tired limbs. Much like another woman who\r\nhad lain in the straw with her child in her arms almost two thousand\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be enchanting to be able to record that Selina, next day, had\r\nphenomenal success, disposing of her carefully bunched wares to great\r\nadvantage, driving smartly off up Halsted Street toward High Prairie\r\nwith a goodly profit jingling in her scuffed leather purse. The truth is\r\nthat she had a day so devastating, so catastrophic, as would have\r\ndiscouraged most men and certainly any woman less desperate and\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nShe had awakened, not to daylight, but to the three o\xe2\x80\x99clock blackness.\r\nThe street was already astir. Selina brushed her skirt to rid it of the\r\nclinging hay, tidied herself as best she could. Leaving Dirk still\r\nasleep, she called Pom from beneath the wagon to act as sentinel at the\r\ndashboard, and crossed the street to Chris Spanknoebel\xe2\x80\x99s. She knew\r\nChris, and he her. He would let her wash at the faucet at the rear of\r\nthe eating house. She would buy hot coffee for herself and Dirk to warm\r\nand revivify them. They would eat the sandwiches left from the night\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nChris himself, a pot-paunched Austrian, blond, benevolent, was standing\r\nbehind his bar, wiping the slab with a large moist cloth. With the other\r\nhand he swept the surface with a rubber-tipped board about the size of a\r\nshingle. This contrivance gathered up such beads of moisture as might be\r\nleft by the cloth. Two sweeps of it rendered the counter dry and\r\nshining. Later Chris allowed Dirk to wield this rubber-tipped\r\ncontrivance\xe2\x80\x94a most satisfactory thing to do, leaving one with a feeling\r\nof perfect achievement.\r\n\r\nSpanknoebel seemed never to sleep, yet his colour was ruddy, his blue\r\neyes clear. The last truckster coming in at night for a beer or a cup of\r\ncoffee and a sandwich was greeted by Chris, white-aproned, pink-cheeked,\r\nwide awake, swabbing the bar\xe2\x80\x99s shining surface with the thirsty cloth,\r\nswishing it with the sly rubber-tipped board. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how goes it all the\r\nwhile?\xe2\x80\x9d said Chris. The earliest morning trader found Chris in a fresh\r\nwhite apron crackling with starch and ironing. He would swab the bar\r\nwith a gesture of welcome, of greeting. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how goes it all the\r\nwhile?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Selina entered the long room now there was something heartening,\r\nreassuring about Chris\xe2\x80\x99s clean white apron, his ruddy colour, the very\r\nsweep of his shirt-sleeved arm as it encompassed the bar-slab. From the\r\nkitchen at the rear came the sounds of sizzling and frying, and the\r\ngracious scent of coffee and of frying pork and potatoes. Already the\r\nmarket men were seated at the tables eating huge and hurried breakfasts:\r\nhunks of ham; eggs in pairs; potatoes cut in great cubes; cups of\r\nsteaming coffee and chunks of bread that they plastered liberally with\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\nSelina approached Chris. His round face loomed out through the smoke\r\nlike the sun in a fog. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how goes it all the while?\xe2\x80\x9d Then he\r\nrecognized her. \xe2\x80\x9c_Um Gottes!_\xe2\x80\x94why, it\xe2\x80\x99s Mis\xe2\x80\x99 DeJong!\xe2\x80\x9d He wiped his\r\ngreat hand on a convenient towel, extended it in sympathy to the widow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heerd,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI heerd.\xe2\x80\x9d His inarticulateness made his words\r\ndoubly effective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come in with the load, Mr. Spanknoebel. The boy and I. He\xe2\x80\x99s still\r\nasleep in the wagon. May I bring him over here to clean him up a little\r\nbefore breakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure! Sure!\xe2\x80\x9d A sudden suspicion struck him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t slept in the\r\nwagon, Mis\xe2\x80\x99 DeJong! _Um Gottes!_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad. The boy slept the night through. I slept, too,\r\nquite a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy you didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here! Why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d At the look in Selina\xe2\x80\x99s face he knew\r\nthen. \xe2\x80\x9cFor nothing you and the boy could sleep here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that! That\xe2\x80\x99s why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk dumb, Mrs. DeJong. Half the time the rooms is vacant. You\r\nand the boy chust as well\xe2\x80\x94twenty cents, then, and pay me when you got\r\nit. But any way you don\xe2\x80\x99t come in reg\xe2\x80\x99lar with the load, do you? That\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t for womans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no one to do it for me, except Jan. And he\xe2\x80\x99s worse than nobody.\r\nJust through September and October. After that, maybe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice\r\ntrailed off. It is hard to be hopeful at three in the morning, before\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nShe went to the little wash room at the rear, felt better immediately\r\nshe had washed vigorously, combed her hair. She returned to the wagon to\r\nfind a panic-stricken Dirk sure of nothing but that he had been deserted\r\nby his mother. Fifteen minutes later the two were seated at a table on\r\nwhich was spread what Chris Spanknoebel considered an adequate\r\nbreakfast. A heartening enough beginning for the day, and a deceptive.\r\n\r\nThe Haymarket buyers did not want to purchase its vegetables from Selina\r\nDeJong. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to buying of women, but to selling to them.\r\nPedlers and small grocers swarmed in at four\xe2\x80\x94Greeks, Italians, Jews.\r\nThey bought shrewdly, craftily, often dishonestly. They sold their wares\r\nto the housewives. Their tricks were many. They would change a box of\r\ntomatoes while your back was turned; filch a head of cauliflower. There\r\nwas little system or organization.\r\n\r\nTake Luigi. Luigi peddled on the north side. He called his wares through\r\nthe alleys and side streets of Chicago, adding his raucous voice to the\r\ndin of an inchoate city. A swarthy face had Luigi, a swift brilliant\r\nsmile, a crafty eye. The Haymarket called him Loogy. When prices did not\r\nplease Luigi he pretended not to understand. Then the Haymarket would\r\nyell, undeceived, \xe2\x80\x9cHeh, Loogy, what de mattah! Spika da Engleesh!\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\nknew him.\r\n\r\nSelina had taken the covers off her vegetables. They were revealed\r\ncrisp, fresh, colourful. But Selina knew they must be sold now, quickly.\r\nWhen the leaves began to wilt, when the edges of the cauliflower heads\r\ncurled ever so slightly, turned brown and limp, their value decreased by\r\nhalf, even though the heads themselves remained white and firm.\r\n\r\nDown the street came the buyers\xe2\x80\x94little black-eyed swarthy men; plump,\r\nshirt-sleeved, greasy men; shrewd, tobacco-chewing men in overalls.\r\nStolid red Dutch faces, sunburned. Lean dark foreign faces. Shouting,\r\nclatter, turmoil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeh! Get your horse outta here! What the hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much for the whole barrel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot any beans? No, don\xe2\x80\x99t want no cauliflower. Beans!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, keep \xe2\x80\x99em. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuarter for the sack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cG\xe2\x80\x99wan, them ain\xe2\x80\x99t five-pound heads. Bet they don\xe2\x80\x99t come four pounds to\r\nthe head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho says they don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGimme five bushels them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFood for Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s millions. In and out of the wagons. Under horses\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhoofs. Bare-footed children, baskets on their arms, snatching bits of\r\nfallen vegetables from the cobbles. Gutter Annie, a shawl pinned across\r\nher pendulous breasts, scavengering a potato there, an onion fallen to\r\nthe street, scraps of fruit and green stuff in the ditch. Big Kate\r\nbuying carrots, parsley, turnips, beets, all slightly wilted and cheap,\r\nwhich she would tie into bunches with her bit of string and sell to the\r\nreal grocers for soup greens.\r\n\r\nThe day broke warm. The sun rose red. It would be a humid September day\r\nsuch as frequently came in the autumn to this lake region. Garden stuff\r\nwould have to move quickly this morning. Afternoon would find it\r\nworthless.\r\n\r\nSelina stationed herself by her wagon. She saw the familiar faces of a\r\nhalf dozen or more High Prairie neighbours. These called to her, or came\r\nover briefly to her wagon, eyeing her wares with a calculating glance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you making out, Mis\xe2\x80\x99 DeJong? Well, you got a good load there. Move\r\nit along quick this morning. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hot I betcha.\xe2\x80\x9d Their tone\r\nwas kindly, but disapproving, too. Their look said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo place for a\r\nwoman. No place for a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pedlers looked at her bunched bouquets, glanced at her, passed her\r\nby. It was not unkindness that prompted them, but a certain shyness, a\r\nfear of the unaccustomed. They saw her pale fine face with its great\r\nsombre eyes; the slight figure in the decent black dress; the slim brown\r\nhands clasped so anxiously together. Her wares were tempting but they\r\npassed her by with the instinct that the ignorant have against that\r\nwhich is unusual.\r\n\r\nBy nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock trading began to fall off. In a panic Selina realized\r\nthat the sales she had made amounted to little more than two dollars. If\r\nshe stayed there until noon she might double that, but no more. In\r\ndesperation she harnessed the horses, threaded her way out of the\r\nswarming street, and made for South Water Street farther east. Here were\r\nthe commission houses. The district was jammed with laden carts and\r\nwagons exactly as the Haymarket had been, but trading was done on a\r\ndifferent scale. She knew that Pervus had sometimes left his entire load\r\nwith an established dealer here, to be sold on commission. She\r\nremembered the name\xe2\x80\x94Talcott\xe2\x80\x94though she did not know the exact\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere we going now, Mom?\xe2\x80\x9d The boy had been almost incredibly patient\r\nand good. He had accepted his bewildering new surroundings with the\r\nadaptability of childhood. He had revelled richly in Chris Spanknoebel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngenerous breakfast. He had thought the four dusty artificial palms that\r\ngraced Chris\xe2\x80\x99s back room luxuriantly tropical. He had been fascinated by\r\nthe kitchen with its long glowing range, its great tables for slicing,\r\nparing, cutting. He liked the ruddy cheer of it, the bustle, the\r\nmouth-watering smells. At the wagon he had stood sturdily next his\r\nmother, had busied himself vastly assisting her in her few pitiful\r\nsales; had plucked wilted leaves, brought forward the freshest and\r\ncrispest vegetables. But now she saw that he was drooping a little as\r\nwere her wares, with the heat and the absence from accustomed soil.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere we going now, Mom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo another street, Sobig\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Dirk, where there\xe2\x80\x99s a man who\xe2\x80\x99ll buy all our stuff at once\xe2\x80\x94maybe.\r\nWon\xe2\x80\x99t that be fine! Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go home. You help mother find his name\r\nover the store. Talcott\xe2\x80\x94T-a-l-c-o-double t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSouth Water Street was changing with the city\xe2\x80\x99s growth. Yankee names\r\nthey used to be\xe2\x80\x94Flint\xe2\x80\x94Keen\xe2\x80\x94Rusk\xe2\x80\x94Lane. Now you saw\r\nCuneo\xe2\x80\x94Meleges\xe2\x80\x94Garibaldi\xe2\x80\x94Campagna. There it was: William Talcott.\r\nFruits and Vegetables.\r\n\r\nWilliam Talcott, standing in the cool doorway of his great deep\r\nshed-like store, was the antithesis of the feverish crowded street which\r\nhe so calmly surveyed. He had dealt for forty years in provender. His\r\nwas the unruffled demeanour of a man who knows the world must have what\r\nhe has to sell. Every week-day morning at six his dim shaded cavern of a\r\nstore was packed with sacks, crates, boxes, barrels from which peeped\r\nruffles and sprigs of green; flashes of scarlet, plum-colour, orange. He\r\nbought the best only; sold at high prices. He had known Pervus, and\r\nPervus\xe2\x80\x99s father before him, and had adjudged them honest, admirable men.\r\nBut of their garden truck he had small opinion. The Great Lakes boats\r\nbrought him choice Michigan peaches and grapes; refrigerator cars\r\nbrought him the products of California\xe2\x80\x99s soil in a day when\r\nout-of-season food was a rare luxury. He wore neat pepper-and-salt pants\r\nand vest; shirt sleeves a startling white in that blue-shirted overalled\r\nworld; a massive gold watch chain spanning his middle; square-toed\r\nboots; a straw fedora set well back; a pretty good cigar, unlighted, in\r\nhis mouth. Shrewd blue eyes he had; sparse hair much the colour of his\r\nsuit. Like a lean laconic god he stood in his doorway niche while\r\ntoilers offered for his inspection the fruits of the earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNope. Can\xe2\x80\x99t use that lot, Jake. Runty. H\xe2\x80\x99m. Wa-a-al, guess you\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\ntake them farther up the street, Tunis. Edges look kind of brown.\r\nWilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStewards from the best Chicago hotels of that day\xe2\x80\x94the Sherman House,\r\nthe Auditorium, the Palmer House, the Wellington, the Stratford\xe2\x80\x94came to\r\nWill Talcott for their daily supplies. The grocers who catered to the\r\nwell-to-do north-side families and those in the neighbourhood of\r\nfashionable Prairie Avenue on the south bought of him.\r\n\r\nNow, in his doorway, he eyed the spare little figure that appeared\r\nbefore him all in rusty black, with its strained anxious face, its great\r\ndeep-sunk eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeJong, eh? Sorry to hear about your loss, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Pervus was a fine\r\nlad. No great shakes at truck farming, though. His widow, h\xe2\x80\x99m? Hm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHere, he saw, was no dull-witted farm woman; no stolid Dutch woman\r\ntruckster. He went out to her wagon, tweaked the boy\xe2\x80\x99s brown cheek.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWa-al now, Mis\xe2\x80\x99 DeJong, you got a right smart lot of garden stuff here\r\nand it looks pretty good. Yessir, pretty good. But you\xe2\x80\x99re too late. Ten,\r\npret\xe2\x80\x99 near.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Selina. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! Not too late!\xe2\x80\x9d And at the agony in her\r\nvoice he looked at her sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell you what, mebbe I can move half of \xe2\x80\x99em along for you. But stuff\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t keep this weather. Turns wilty and my trade won\xe2\x80\x99t touch it . . .\r\nFirst trip in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wiped her face that was damp and yet cold to the touch. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst\xe2\x80\x94trip\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d Suddenly she was finding it absurdly hard to breathe.\r\n\r\nHe called from the sidewalk to the men within: \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge! Ben! Hustle this\r\nstuff in. Half of it. The best. Send you check to-morrow, Mis\xe2\x80\x99 DeJong.\r\nPicked a bad day, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, for your first day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHot, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWa-al, hot, yes. But I mean a holiday like this pedlers mostly ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbuying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoliday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew it was a Jew holiday, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x94Wa-al, my sakes!\r\nWorst day in the year. Jew pedlers all at church to-day and all the\r\nothers not pedlers bought in Saturday for two days. Chicken men down the\r\nstreet got empty coops and will have till to-morrow. Yessir. Biggest\r\nchicken eaters, Jews are, in the world . . . Hm . . . Better just drive\r\nalong home and just dump the rest that stuff, my good woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne hand on the seat she prepared to climb up again\xe2\x80\x94did step to the\r\nhub. You saw her shabby, absurd side-boots that were so much too big for\r\nthe slim little feet. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re just buying my stuff because you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsorry for me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The Peake pride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do business that way. Can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. My da\xe2\x80\x99ter she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudying to be a singer. In Italy now, Car\xe2\x80\x99line is, and costs like all\r\nget-out. Takes all the money I can scrape together, just about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a little colour in Selina\xe2\x80\x99s face now. \xe2\x80\x9cItaly! Oh, Mr.\r\nTalcott!\xe2\x80\x9d You\xe2\x80\x99d have thought she had seen it, from her face. She began\r\nto thank him, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Mis\xe2\x80\x99 DeJong. I notice your stuff\xe2\x80\x99s bunched kind\r\nof extry, and all of a size. Fixin\xe2\x80\x99 to do that way right along?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I thought\xe2\x80\x94they looked prettier that way\xe2\x80\x94of course vegetables\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to look pretty, I expect\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered, stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fix \xe2\x80\x99em pretty like that and bring \xe2\x80\x99em in to me first thing, or\r\nsend \xe2\x80\x99em. My trade, they like their stuff kind of special. Yessir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she gathered up the reins he stood again in his doorway, cool,\r\nremote, his unlighted cigar in his mouth, while hand-trucks rattled past\r\nhim, barrels and boxes thumped to the sidewalk in front of him, wheels\r\nand hoofs and shouts made a great clamour all about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe going home now?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Dirk. \xe2\x80\x9cWe going home now? I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, lamb.\xe2\x80\x9d Two dollars in her pocket. All yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s grim toil, and\r\nall to-day\xe2\x80\x99s, and months of labour behind those two days. Two dollars in\r\nthe pocket of her black calico petticoat. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll get something to eat\r\nwhen we drive out a ways. Some milk and bread and cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sun was very hot. She took the boy\xe2\x80\x99s hat off, passed her tender\r\nwork-calloused hand over the damp hair that clung to his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen fun, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLike an adventure. Look at all the kind\r\npeople we\xe2\x80\x99ve met. Mr. Spanknoebel, and Mr. Talcott\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mabel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStartled, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mabel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wanted suddenly to kiss him, knew he would hate it with all the boy\r\nand all the Holland Dutch in him, and did not.\r\n\r\nShe made up her mind to drive east and then south. Pervus had sometimes\r\nachieved a late sale to outlying grocers. Jan\xe2\x80\x99s face if she came home\r\nwith half the load still on the wagon! And what of the unpaid bills? She\r\nhad, perhaps, thirty dollars, all told. She owed four hundred. More than\r\nthat. There were seedlings that Pervus had bought in April to be paid\r\nfor at the end of the growing season, in the fall. And now fall was\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nFear shook her. She told herself she was tired, nervous. That terrible\r\nweek. And now this. The heat. Soon they\xe2\x80\x99d be home, she and Dirk. How\r\ncool and quiet the house would seem. The squares of the kitchen\r\ntablecloth. Her own neat bedroom with the black walnut bed and dresser.\r\nThe sofa in the parlour with the ruffled calico cover. The old chair on\r\nthe porch with the cane seat sagging where warp and woof had become\r\nloosened with much use and stuck out in ragged tufts. It seemed years\r\nsince she had seen all this. The comfort of it, the peace of it. Safe,\r\ndesirable, suddenly dear. No work for a woman, this. Well, perhaps they\r\nwere right.\r\n\r\nDown Wabash Avenue, with the L trains thundering overhead and her\r\nhorses, frightened and uneasy with the unaccustomed roar and clangour of\r\ntraffic, stepping high and swerving stiffly, grotesque and angular in\r\ntheir movements. A dowdy farm woman and a sunburned boy in a rickety\r\nvegetable wagon absurdly out of place in this canyon of cobblestones,\r\nshops, street-cars, drays, carriages, bicycles, pedestrians. It was\r\nterribly hot.\r\n\r\nThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes popped with excitement and bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty soon,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said. The muscles showed white beneath the skin of\r\nher jaw. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty soon. Prairie Avenue. Great big houses, and lawns, all\r\nquiet.\xe2\x80\x9d She even managed a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like it better home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrairie Avenue at last, turning in at Sixteenth Street. It was like calm\r\nafter a storm. Selina felt battered, spent.\r\n\r\nThere were groceries near Eighteenth, and at the other\r\ncross-streets\xe2\x80\x94Twenty-second, Twenty-sixth, Thirty-first, Thirty-fifth.\r\nThey were passing the great stone houses of Prairie Avenue of the \xe2\x80\x9990s.\r\nTurrets and towers, cornices and cupolas, humpbacked conservatories,\r\nporte-coch\xc3\xa8res, bow windows\xe2\x80\x94here lived Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s rich that had made\r\ntheir riches in pork and wheat and dry goods; the selling of necessities\r\nto a city that clamoured for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust like me,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina thought, humorously. Then another thought came to\r\nher. Her vegetables, canvas covered, were fresher than those in the\r\nnear-by markets. Why not try to sell some of them here, in these big\r\nhouses? In an hour she might earn a few dollars this way at retail\r\nprices slightly less than those asked by the grocers of the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nShe stopped her wagon in the middle of the block on Twenty-fourth\r\nStreet. Agilely she stepped down the wheel, gave the reins to Dirk. The\r\nhorses were no more minded to run than the wooden steeds on a carrousel.\r\nShe filled a large market basket with the finest and freshest of her\r\nstock and with this on her arm looked up a moment at the house in front\r\nof which she had stopped. It was a four-story brownstone, with a hideous\r\nhigh stoop. Beneath the steps were a little vestibule and a door that\r\nwas the tradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s entrance. The kitchen entrance, she knew, was by way\r\nof the alley at the back, but this she would not take. Across the\r\nsidewalk, down a little flight of stone steps, into the vestibule under\r\nthe porch. She looked at the bell\xe2\x80\x94a brass knob. You pulled it out,\r\nshoved it in, and there sounded a jangling down the dim hallway beyond.\r\nSimple enough. Her hand was on the bell. \xe2\x80\x9cPull it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the desperate\r\nSelina. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t! I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d cried all the prim dim Vermont Peakes, in\r\nchorus. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Starve to death and let them take the farm and Dirk,\r\nthen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that she pulled the knob hard. Jangle went the bell in the hall.\r\nAgain. Again.\r\n\r\nFootsteps up the hall. The door opened to disclose a large woman, high\r\ncheek-boned, in a work apron; a cook, apparently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you like some fresh country\r\nvegetables?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d She half shut the door, opening it again to ask, \xe2\x80\x9cGot any fresh\r\neggs or butter?\xe2\x80\x9d At Selina\xe2\x80\x99s negative she closed the door, bolted it.\r\nSelina, standing there, basket on arm, could hear her heavy tread down\r\nthe passageway toward the kitchen. Well, that was all right. Nothing so\r\nterrible about that, Selina told herself. Simply hadn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted any\r\nvegetables. The next house. The next house, and the next, and the next.\r\nUp one side of the street, and down the other. Four times she refilled\r\nher basket. At one house she sold a quarter\xe2\x80\x99s worth. Fifteen at another.\r\nTwenty cents here. Almost fifty there. \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she always said\r\nat the door in her clear, distinct way. They stared, usually. But they\r\nwere curious, too, and did not often shut the door in her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know of a good place?\xe2\x80\x9d one kitchen maid said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis place ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nso good. She only pays me three dollars. You can get four now. Maybe you\r\nknow a lady wants a good girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina answered. \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt another house the cook had offered her a cup of coffee, noting the\r\nwhite face, the look of weariness. Selina refused it, politely.\r\nTwenty-first Street\xe2\x80\x94Twenty-fifth\xe2\x80\x94Twenty-eighth. She had over four\r\ndollars in her purse. Dirk was weary now and hungry to the point of\r\ntears. \xe2\x80\x9cThe last house,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina promised him, \xe2\x80\x9cthe very last one. After\r\nthis one we\xe2\x80\x99ll go home.\xe2\x80\x9d She filled her basket again. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nsomething to eat on the way, and maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll go to sleep with the\r\ncanvas over you, high, fastened to the seat like a tent. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nhome in a jiffy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last house was a new gray stone one, already beginning to turn dingy\r\nfrom the smoke of the Illinois Central suburban trains that puffed along\r\nthe lake front a block to the east. The house had large bow windows,\r\nplump and shining. There was a lawn, with statues, and a conservatory in\r\nthe rear. Real lace curtains at the downstairs windows with plush\r\nhangings behind them. A high iron grille ran all about the property\r\ngiving it an air of aloofness, of security. Selina glanced at this\r\nwrought-iron fence. And it seemed to bar her out. There was something\r\nforbidding about it\xe2\x80\x94menacing. She was tired, that was it. The last\r\nhouse. She had almost five dollars, earned in the last hour. \xe2\x80\x9cJust five\r\nminutes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Dirk, trying to make her tone bright, her voice\r\ngay. Her arms full of vegetables which she was about to place in the\r\nbasket at her feet she heard at her elbow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, where\xe2\x80\x99s your license?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned. A policeman at her side. She stared up at him. How\r\nenormously tall, she thought; and how red his face. \xe2\x80\x9cLicense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh, you heard me. License. Where\xe2\x80\x99s your pedler\xe2\x80\x99s license? You got one,\r\nI s\xe2\x80\x99pose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no. No.\xe2\x80\x9d She stared at him, still.\r\n\r\nHis face grew redder. Selina was a little worried about him. She\r\nthought, stupidly, that if it grew any redder\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, say, where d\xe2\x80\x99ye think you are, peddlin\xe2\x80\x99 without a license! A good\r\nmind to run you in. Get along out of here, you and the kid. Leave me\r\nketch you around here again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble, Officer?\xe2\x80\x9d said a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice. A smart open\r\ncarriage of the type known as a victoria, with two chestnut horses whose\r\nharness shone with metal. Spanking, was the word that came to Selina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind, which was acting perversely certainly; crazily. A spanking team.\r\nThe spankers disdainfully faced Selina\xe2\x80\x99s comic bony nags which were\r\ngrazing the close-cropped grass that grew in the neat little\r\nlawn-squares between curb and sidewalk. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble, Reilly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman stepped out of the victoria. She wore a black silk Eton suit,\r\nvery modish, and a black hat with a plume.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman peddling without a license, Mrs. Arnold. You got to watch \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nlike a hawk. . . . Get along wid you, then.\xe2\x80\x9d He put a hand on Selina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder and gave her a gentle push.\r\n\r\nThere shook Selina from head to foot such a passion, such a storm of\r\noutraged sensibilities, as to cause street, victoria, silk-clad woman,\r\nhorses, and policeman to swim and shiver in a haze before her eyes. The\r\nrage of a fastidious woman who had had an alien male hand put upon her.\r\nHer face was white. Her eyes glowed black, enormous. She seemed tall,\r\nmajestic even.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake your hand off me!\xe2\x80\x9d Her speech was clipped, vibrant. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you\r\ntouch me! How dare you! Take your hand!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The blazing eyes in the\r\nwhite mask. He took his hand from her shoulder. The red surged into her\r\nface. A tanned weather-beaten toil-worn woman, her abundant hair\r\nskewered into a knob and held by a long gray-black hairpin, her full\r\nskirt grimed with the mud of the wagon wheel, a pair of old side-boots\r\non her slim feet, a grotesquely battered old felt hat (her husband\xe2\x80\x99s) on\r\nher head, her arms full of ears of sweet corn, and carrots, and radishes\r\nand bunches of beets; a woman with bad teeth, flat breasts\xe2\x80\x94even then\r\nJulie had known her by her eyes. And she had stared and then run to her\r\nin her silk dress and her plumed hat, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Selina! My dear! My\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x9d with a sob of horror and pity. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear!\xe2\x80\x9d And had taken Selina,\r\ncarrots, beets, corn, and radishes in her arms. The vegetables lay\r\nscattered all about them on the sidewalk in front of Julie Hempel\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s great stone house on Prairie Avenue. But strangely enough it\r\nhad been Selina who had done the comforting, patting Julie\xe2\x80\x99s plump\r\nsilken shoulder and saying, over and over, soothingly, as to a child,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there! It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Julie. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthere to cry for! Sh-sh! It\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulie lifted her head in its modish black plumed hat, wiped her eyes,\r\nblew her nose. \xe2\x80\x9cGet along with you, do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Reilly, the\r\npoliceman, using his very words to Selina. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to report you to\r\nMr. Arnold, see if I don\xe2\x80\x99t. And you know what that means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, Mrs. Arnold, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I was only doing my duty. How cud I know\r\nthe lady was a friend of yours. Sure, I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He surveyed Selina, cart,\r\njaded horses, wilted vegetables. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how _cud_ I, now, Mrs. Arnold,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not!\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Julie with superb unreasonableness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know. Do get along with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got along, a defeated officer of the law, and a bitter. And now it\r\nwas Julie who surveyed Selina, cart, Dirk, jaded horses, wilted\r\nleft-over vegetables. \xe2\x80\x9cSelina, whatever in the world! What are you doing\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She caught sight of Selina\xe2\x80\x99s absurd boots then and she began\r\nto cry again. At that Selina\xe2\x80\x99s overwrought nerves snapped and she began\r\nto laugh, hysterically. It frightened Julie, that laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cSelina,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t! Come in the house with me. What are you laughing at! Selina!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith shaking finger Selina was pointing at the vegetables that lay\r\ntumbled at her feet. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see that cabbage, Julie? Do you remember\r\nhow I used to despise Mrs. Tebbitt\xe2\x80\x99s because she used to have boiled\r\ncabbage on Monday nights?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to laugh at, is it? Stop laughing this minute, Selina\r\nPeake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stop. I\xe2\x80\x99ve stopped now. I was just laughing at my ignorance. Sweat\r\nand blood and health and youth go into every cabbage. Did you know that,\r\nJulie? One doesn\xe2\x80\x99t despise them as food, knowing that. . . . Come, climb\r\ndown, Dirk. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a lady mother used to know\xe2\x80\x94oh, years and years ago,\r\nwhen she was a girl. Thousands of years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best thing for Dirk. The best thing for Dirk. It was the phrase that\r\nrepeated itself over and over in Selina\xe2\x80\x99s speech during the days that\r\nfollowed. Julie Arnold was all for taking him into her gray stone house,\r\ndressing him like Lord Fauntleroy and sending him to the north-side\r\nprivate school attended by Eugene, her boy, and Pauline, her girl. In\r\nthis period of bewilderment and fatigue Julie had attempted to take\r\ncharge of Selina much as she had done a dozen years before at the time\r\nof Simeon Peake\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic death. And now, as then, she pressed into\r\nservice her wonder-working father and bounden slave, August Hempel. Her\r\nhusband she dismissed with affectionate disregard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d she had said on that day of their first meeting,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you tell him what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done. He\xe2\x80\x99ll always do it. But Pa\xe2\x80\x99s the one\r\nthat thinks of things. He\xe2\x80\x99s like a general, and Michael\xe2\x80\x99s the captain.\r\nWell, now, Pa\xe2\x80\x99ll be out to-morrow and I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably come with him. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a committee meeting, but I can easily\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said\xe2\x80\x94did you say your father would be out to-morrow! Out where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your place. Farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should he? It\xe2\x80\x99s a little twenty-five-acre truck farm, and half\r\nof it under water a good deal of the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPa\xe2\x80\x99ll find a use for it, never fear. He won\xe2\x80\x99t say much, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll think\r\nof things. And then everything will be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s miles. Miles. Way out in High Prairie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you could make it with those horses, Selina, I guess we can\r\nwith Pa\xe2\x80\x99s two grays that hold a record for a mile in three minutes or\r\nthree miles in a minute, I forget which. Or in the auto, though Pa hates\r\nit. Michael is the only one in the family who likes it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA species of ugly pride now possessed Selina. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t need help. Really\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t, Julie dear. It\xe2\x80\x99s never been like to-day. Never before. We were\r\ngetting on very well, Pervus and I. Then after Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s death so\r\nsuddenly like that I was frightened. Terribly frightened. About Dirk. I\r\nwanted him to have everything. Beautiful things. I wanted his life to be\r\nbeautiful. Life can be so ugly, Julie. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I say. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be out to-morrow, Pa and I. Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing to have everything beautiful. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was then that Selina had said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s just it. I want to do it\r\nmyself, for him. I can. I want to give him all these things myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s selfish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be. I just want to do the best thing for Dirk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after noon that High Prairie, hearing the unaccustomed\r\nchug of a motor, rushed to its windows or porches to behold Selina\r\nDeJong in her mashed black felt hat and Dirk waving his battered straw\r\nwildly, riding up the Halsted road toward the DeJong farm in a bright\r\nred automobile that had shattered the nerves of every farmer\xe2\x80\x99s team it\r\nhad met on the way. Of the DeJong team and the DeJong dog Pom, and the\r\nDeJong vegetable wagon there was absolutely no sign. High Prairie was\r\nrendered unfit for work throughout the next twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe idea had been Julie\xe2\x80\x99s, and Selina had submitted rather than\r\nacquiesced, for by now she was too tired to combat anything or any one.\r\nIf Julie had proposed her entering High Prairie on the back of an\r\nelephant with a mahout perched between his ears Selina would have\r\nagreed\xe2\x80\x94rather, would have been unable to object.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll get you home in no time,\xe2\x80\x9d Julie had said, energetically. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nlook like a ghost and the boy\xe2\x80\x99s half asleep. I\xe2\x80\x99ll telephone Pa and he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave one of the men from the barns drive your team out so it\xe2\x80\x99ll be there\r\nby six. Just you leave it all to me. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you ever ridden in one!\r\nWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be scared of. I like the horses best, myself.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m like Pa. He says if you use horses you get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk had accepted the new conveyance with the adaptability of childhood,\r\nhad even predicted, grandly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to have one when I grow up\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99ll go faster \xe2\x80\x99n this, even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go faster than this, Dirk,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina had\r\nprotested breathlessly as they chugged along at the alarming rate of\r\nalmost fifteen miles an hour.\r\n\r\nJan Snip had been rendered speechless. Until the actual arrival of the\r\nteam and wagon at six he counted them as mysteriously lost and DeJong\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwidow clearly gone mad. August Hempel\xe2\x80\x99s arrival next day with Julie\r\nseated beside him in the light spider-phaeton drawn by two slim\r\nwild-eyed quivering grays made little tumult in Jan\xe2\x80\x99s stunned mind by\r\nnow incapable of absorbing any fresh surprises.\r\n\r\nIn the twelve years\xe2\x80\x99 transition from butcher to packer Aug Hempel had\r\ntaken on a certain authority and distinction. Now, at fifty-five, his\r\nhair was gray, relieving the too-ruddy colour of his face. He talked\r\nalmost without an accent; used the idiomatic American speech he heard\r\nabout the yards, where the Hempel packing plant was situated. Only his\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99s were likely to sound like t\xe2\x80\x99s. The letter j had a slightly ch sound.\r\nIn the last few years he had grown very deaf in one ear, so that when\r\nyou spoke to him he looked at you intently. This had given him a\r\nreputation for keenness and great character insight, when it was merely\r\nthe protective trick of a man who does not want to confess that he is\r\nhard of hearing. He wore square-toed shoes with soft tips and square-cut\r\ngray clothes and a large gray hat with a chronically inadequate\r\nsweat-band. The square-cut boots were expensive, and the square-cut gray\r\nclothes and the large gray hat, but in them he always gave the effect of\r\nbeing dressed in the discarded garments of a much larger man.\r\n\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s domain he surveyed with a keen and comprehensive eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to sell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xe2\x80\x9d (It was nearly goot as he said it.) \xe2\x80\x9cFew years from now\r\nthis land will be worth money.\xe2\x80\x9d He had spent a bare fifteen minutes\r\ntaking shrewd valuation of the property from fields to barn, from barn\r\nto house. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what _do_ you want to do, heh, Selina?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were seated in the cool and unexpectedly pleasing little parlour,\r\nwith its old Dutch lustre set gleaming softly in the cabinet, its three\r\nrows of books, its air of comfort and usage.\r\n\r\nDirk was in the yard with one of the Van Ruys boys, surveying the grays\r\nproprietorially. Jan was rooting in the fields. Selina clasped her hands\r\ntightly in her lap\xe2\x80\x94those hands that, from much grubbing in the soil,\r\nhad taken on something of the look of the gnarled things they tended.\r\nThe nails were short, discoloured, broken. The palms rough, calloused.\r\nThe whole story of the last twelve years of Selina\xe2\x80\x99s life was written in\r\nher two hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to stay here, and work the farm, and make it pay. I can. By next\r\nspring my asparagus is going to begin to bring in money. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going\r\nto grow just the common garden stuff any more\xe2\x80\x94not much, anyway. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to specialize in the fine things\xe2\x80\x94the kind the South Water Street\r\ncommission men want. I want to drain the low land. Tile it. That land\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t been used for years. It ought to be rich growing land by now, if\r\nonce it\xe2\x80\x99s properly drained. And I want Dirk to go to school. Good\r\nschools. I never want my son to go to the Haymarket. Never. Never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulie stirred with a little rustle and click of silk and beads. Her\r\ngentle amiability was vaguely alarmed by the iron quality of\r\ndetermination in the other\xe2\x80\x99s tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but what about you, Selina?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course. You talk as though you didn\xe2\x80\x99t count. Your life. Things\r\nto make you happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy life doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count, except as something for Dirk to use. I\xe2\x80\x99m done\r\nwith anything else. Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that I\xe2\x80\x99m discouraged, or\r\ndisappointed in life, or anything like that. I mean I started out with\r\nthe wrong idea. I know better now. I\xe2\x80\x99m here to keep Dirk from making the\r\nmistakes I made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Aug Hempel, lounging largely in his chair and eyeing Selina\r\nintently, turned his gaze absently through the window to where the\r\ngrays, a living equine statue, stood before the house. His tone was one\r\nof meditation, not of argument. \xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t work out that way, seems.\r\nAbout mistakes it\xe2\x80\x99s funny. You got to make your own; and not only that,\r\nif you try to keep people from making theirs they get mad.\xe2\x80\x9d He whistled\r\nsoftly through his teeth following this utterance and tapped the chair\r\nseat with his finger nails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said then, almost passionately. Aug Hempel and\r\nJulie plainly could make nothing of this remark so she went on, eager,\r\nexplanatory. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to think that if you wanted beauty\xe2\x80\x94if you wanted\r\nit hard enough and hopefully enough\xe2\x80\x94it came to you. You just waited,\r\nand lived your life as best you could, knowing that beauty might be just\r\naround the corner. You just waited, and then it came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeauty!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Julie, weakly. She stared at Selina in the evident\r\nbelief that this work-worn haggard woman was bemoaning her lack of\r\npersonal pulchritude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. All the worth-while things in life. All mixed up. Rooms in\r\ncandle-light. Leisure. Colour. Travel. Books. Music. Pictures.\r\nPeople\xe2\x80\x94all kinds of people. Work that you love. And growth\xe2\x80\x94growth and\r\nwatching people grow. Feeling very strongly about things and then\r\ndeveloping that feeling to\xe2\x80\x94to make something fine come of it.\xe2\x80\x9d The word\r\nself-expression was not in cant use then, and Selina hadn\xe2\x80\x99t it to offer\r\nthem. They would not have known what she meant if she had. She threw out\r\nher hands now in a futile gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean by beauty. I want\r\nDirk to have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulie blinked and nodded with the wise amiable look of comprehension\r\nassumed by one who has understood no single word of what has been said.\r\nAugust Hempel cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re driving at Selina, maybe. About Julie I felt\r\njust like that. She should have everything fine. I wanted her to have\r\neverything. And she did, too. Cried for the moon she had it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never did have it Pa, any such thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever cried for it, I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Julie, the literal, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s stop talking and\r\ndo something. My goodness, anybody with a little money can have books\r\nand candles and travel around and look at pictures, if that\xe2\x80\x99s all. So\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s _do_ something. Pa, you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably got it all fixed in your mind\r\nlong ago. It\xe2\x80\x99s time we heard it. Here Selina was one of the most popular\r\ngirls in Miss Fister\xe2\x80\x99s school, and lots of people thought the prettiest.\r\nAnd now just look at her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA flicker of the old flame leaped up in Selina. \xe2\x80\x9cFlatterer!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\nAug Hempel stood up. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you think giving your whole life to making the\r\nboy happy is going to make him happy you ain\xe2\x80\x99t so smart as I took you\r\nfor. You go trying to live somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s life for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to live his life for him. I want to show him how to live\r\nit so that he\xe2\x80\x99ll get full value out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeeping him out of the Haymarket if the Haymarket\xe2\x80\x99s the natural place\r\nfor him to be won\xe2\x80\x99t do that. How can you tell! Monkeying with what\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nbe. I\xe2\x80\x99m out at the yards every day, in and out of the cattle pens,\r\ntalking to the drovers and herders, mixing in with the buyers. I can\r\ntell the weight of a hog and what he\xe2\x80\x99s worth just by a look at him, and\r\na steer, too. My son-in-law Michael Arnold sits up in the office all day\r\nin our plant, dictating letters. His clothes they never stink of the\r\npens like mine do. . . . Now I ain\xe2\x80\x99t saying anything against him, Julie.\r\nBut I bet my grandson Eugene\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he repeated it, stressing the name so\r\nthat you sensed his dislike of it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEugene, if he comes into the\r\nbusiness at all when he grows up, won\xe2\x80\x99t go within smelling distance of\r\nthe yards. His office I bet will be in a new office building on, say\r\nMadison Street, with a view of the lake. Life! You\xe2\x80\x99ll be hoggin\xe2\x80\x99 it all\r\nyourself and not know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t pay any attention to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Julie interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe goes on like\r\nthat. Old yards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAugust Hempel bit off the end of a cigar, was about to spit out the\r\nspeck explosively, thought better of it and tucked it in his vest\r\npocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change places with Mike, not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t call him Mike, Pa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael, then. Not for ten million. And I need ten million right now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Selina, spiritedly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when your son-in-law\r\nMichael Arnold is your age he\xe2\x80\x99ll be telling Eugene how he roughed it in\r\nan office over at the yards in the old days. These will be the old\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAugust Hempel laughed good humouredly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat can be, Selina. That can\r\nbe.\xe2\x80\x9d He chewed his cigar and settled to the business at hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to drain and tile. Plant high-grade stuff. You got to have a\r\nman on the place that knows what\xe2\x80\x99s what, not this Rip Van Winkle we saw\r\nin the cabbage field. New horses. A wagon.\xe2\x80\x9d His eyes narrowed\r\nspeculatively. Shrewd wrinkles radiated from their corners. \xe2\x80\x9cI betcha\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll see the day when you truck farmers will run into town with your\r\nstuff in big automobile wagons that will get you there in under an hour.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s bound to come. The horse is doomed, that\xe2\x80\x99s chust what.\xe2\x80\x9d Then,\r\nabruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cI will get you the horses, a bargain, at the yards.\xe2\x80\x9d He took\r\nout a long flat check book. He began writing in it with a pen that he\r\ntook from his pocket\xe2\x80\x94some sort of marvellous pen that seemed already\r\nfilled with ink and that you unscrewed at the top and then screwed at\r\nthe bottom. He squinted through his cigar smoke, the check book propped\r\non his knee. He tore off the check with a clean rip. \xe2\x80\x9cFor a starter,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. He held it out to Selina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Julie, in triumphant satisfaction. That was more\r\nlike it. Doing something.\r\n\r\nBut Selina did not take the check. She sat very still in her chair, her\r\nhands folded. \xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t the regular way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAugust Hempel was screwing the top on his fountain pen again. \xe2\x80\x9cRegular\r\nway? for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m borrowing this money, not taking it. Oh, yes, I am! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nalong without it. I realize that now, after yesterday. Yesterday! But in\r\nfive years\xe2\x80\x94seven\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay it back.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, at a half-uttered protest\r\nfrom Julie, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the only way I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it. It\xe2\x80\x99s for Dirk. But I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to earn it\xe2\x80\x94and pay it back. I want a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she was being\r\nenormously businesslike, and unconsciously enjoying it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x94an I. O.\r\nU. A promise to pay you back just as\xe2\x80\x94as soon as I can. That\xe2\x80\x99s business,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And I\xe2\x80\x99ll sign it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aug Hempel, and unscrewed his fountain pen again. \xe2\x80\x9cSure\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xe2\x80\x9d Very serious, he scribbled again, busily, on a piece\r\nof paper. A year later, when Selina had learned many things, among them\r\nthat simple and compound interest on money loaned are not mere problems\r\ndevised to fill Duffy\xe2\x80\x99s Arithmetic in her school-teaching days, she went\r\nto August Hempel between laughter and tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t say one word about interest, that day. Not a word. What a\r\nlittle fool you must have thought me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween friends,\xe2\x80\x9d protested August Hempel.\r\n\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cInterest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess I better start me a bank pretty soon if you keep on so\r\nbusinesslike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTen years later he was actually the controlling power in the Yards &\r\nRangers\xe2\x80\x99 Bank. And Selina had that original I. O. U. with its \xe2\x80\x9cPaid In\r\nFull. Aug Hempel,\xe2\x80\x9d carefully tucked away in the carved oak chest\r\ntogether with other keepsakes that she foolishly treasured\xe2\x80\x94ridiculous\r\nscraps that no one but she would have understood or valued\xe2\x80\x94a small\r\nschool slate such as little children use (the one on which she had\r\ntaught Pervus to figure and parse); a dried bunch of trilliums; a\r\nbustled and panniered wine-red cashmere dress, absurdly old-fashioned; a\r\nletter telling about the Infanta Eulalie of Spain, and signed Julie\r\nHempel Arnold; a pair of men\xe2\x80\x99s old side-boots with mud caked on them; a\r\ncrude sketch, almost obliterated now, done on a torn scrap of brown\r\npaper and showing the Haymarket with the wagons vegetable-laden and the\r\nmen gathered beneath the street-flares, and the patient farm\r\nhorses\xe2\x80\x94Roelf\xe2\x80\x99s childish sketch.\r\n\r\nAmong this rubbish she rummaged periodically in the years that followed.\r\nIndeed, twenty years later Dirk, coming upon her smoothing out the\r\nwrinkled yellow creases of the I. O. U. or shaking the camphor-laden\r\nfolds of the wine-red cashmere, would say, \xe2\x80\x9cAt it again! What a\r\nsentimental generation yours was, Mother. Pressed flowers! They went out\r\nwith the attic, didn\xe2\x80\x99t they? If the house caught fire you\xe2\x80\x99d probably run\r\nfor the junk in that chest. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth two cents, the lot of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said, slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, there\xe2\x80\x99d be some money value,\r\nI suppose, in an early original signed sketch by Rodin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRodin! You haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but here\xe2\x80\x99s one by Pool\xe2\x80\x94Roelf Pool\xe2\x80\x94signed. At a sale in New York\r\nlast week one of his sketches\xe2\x80\x94not a finished thing at all\xe2\x80\x94just a rough\r\ndrawing that he\xe2\x80\x99d made of some figures in a group that went into the\r\nDoughboy statue\xe2\x80\x94brought one thous\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, that\xe2\x80\x94yes. But the rest of the stuff you\xe2\x80\x99ve got there\xe2\x80\x94funny\r\nhow people will treasure old stuff like that. Useless stuff. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, and shut the lid of the old chest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nDirk\xe2\x80\x94Dirk! You don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what beauty is. You never will know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIf those vague characteristics called (variously) magnetism, manner,\r\ngrace, distinction, attractiveness, fascination, go to make up that\r\nnebulous quality known as charm; and if the possessor of that quality is\r\naccounted fortunate in his equipment for that which the class-day\r\norators style the battle of life, then Dirk DeJong was a lucky lad and\r\nlife lay promisingly before him. Undoubtedly he had it; and undoubtedly\r\nit did. People said that things \xe2\x80\x9ccame easy\xe2\x80\x9d for Dirk. He said so\r\nhimself, not boastfully, but rather shyly. He was not one to talk a\r\ngreat deal. Perhaps that was one of his most charming qualities. He\r\nlistened so well. And he was so quietly effortless. He listened while\r\nother people talked, his fine head inclined just a little to one side\r\nand bent toward you. Intent on what you were saying, and evidently\r\nimpressed by it. You felt him immensely intelligent, appreciative. It\r\nwas a gift more valuable than any other social talent he might have\r\npossessed. He himself did not know how precious an attribute this was to\r\nprove in a later day when to be allowed to finish a sentence was an\r\nexperience all too rare. Older men especially said he was a smart young\r\nfeller and would make his mark. This, surprisingly enough, after a\r\nconversation to which he had contributed not a word other than \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re right, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d in the proper places.\r\n\r\nSelina thought constantly of Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s future. A thousand other thoughts\r\nmight be racing through her mind during the day\xe2\x80\x94plans for the farm, for\r\nthe house\xe2\x80\x94but always, over and above and through all these, like the\r\nsteady beat of a drum penetrating sharper and more urgent sounds\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nthe thought of Dirk. He did well enough at high school. Not a brilliant\r\nstudent, nor even a very good one. But good enough. Average. And well\r\nliked.\r\n\r\nIt was during those careless years of Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s boyhood between nine and\r\nfifteen that Selina changed the DeJong acres from a worn-out and\r\ndown-at-heel truck farm whose scant products brought a second-rate price\r\nin a second-rate market to a prosperous and blooming vegetable garden\r\nwhose output was sought a year in advance by the South Water Street\r\ncommission merchants. DeJong asparagus with firm white thick stalk bases\r\ntapering to a rich green streaked with lavender at the tips. DeJong\r\nhothouse tomatoes in February, plump, scarlet, juicy. You paid for a\r\npound a sum Pervus had been glad to get for a bushel.\r\n\r\nThese six or seven years of relentless labour had been no showy success\r\nwith Selina posing grandly as the New Woman in Business. No, it had been\r\na painful, grubbing, heart-breaking process as is any project that\r\ndepends on the actual soil for its realization. She drove herself\r\npitilessly. She literally tore a living out of the earth with her two\r\nbare hands. Yet there was nothing pitiable about this small energetic\r\nwoman of thirty-five or forty with her fine soft dark eyes, her\r\nclean-cut jaw-line, her shabby decent clothes that were so likely to be\r\nspattered with the mud of the road or fields, her exquisite nose with\r\nthe funny little wrinkle across the bridge when she laughed. Rather,\r\nthere was something splendid about her; something rich, prophetic. It\r\nwas the splendour and richness that achievement imparts.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful that she ever could have succeeded without the money\r\nborrowed from August Hempel; without his shrewd counsel. She told him\r\nthis, sometimes. He denied it. \xe2\x80\x9cEasier, yes. But you would have found a\r\nway, Selina. Some way. Julie, no. But you, yes. You are like that. Me,\r\ntoo. Say, plenty fellers that was butchers with me twenty years ago over\r\non North Clark Street are butchers yet, cutting off a steak or a chop.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good morning, Mrs. Kruger. What\xe2\x80\x99ll it be to-day?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Hempel Packing Company was a vast monster now stretching great arms\r\ninto Europe, into South America. In some of the yellow journals that had\r\ncropped up in the last few years you even saw old Aug himself portrayed\r\nin cartoons as an octopus with cold slimy eyes and a hundred writhing\r\nreaching tentacles. These bothered Aug a little, though he pretended to\r\nlaugh at them. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they want to go to work and make me out like\r\nthat for? I sell good meat for all I can get for it. That\xe2\x80\x99s business,\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk had his tasks on the farm. Selina saw to that. But they were not\r\nheavy. He left for school at eight in the morning, driving, for the\r\ndistance was too great for walking. Often it was dark on his return in\r\nthe late afternoon. Between these hours Selina had accomplished the work\r\nof two men. She had two field-helpers on the place now during the busy\r\nseason and a woman in the house, the wife of Adam Bras, one of the\r\nlabourers. Jan Snip, too, still worked about the place in the barn, the\r\nsheds, tending the coldframes and hothouses, doing odd jobs of\r\ncarpentering. He distrusted Selina\xe2\x80\x99s new-fangled methods, glowered at\r\nany modern piece of machinery, predicted dire things when Selina bought\r\nthe twenty acres that comprised the old Bouts place adjoining the DeJong\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bit off more as you can chaw,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou choke yet. You\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy the time Dirk returned from school the rough work of the day was\r\nover. His food was always hot, appetizing, plentiful. The house was\r\nneat, comfortable. Selina had installed a bathroom\xe2\x80\x94one of the two\r\nbathrooms in High Prairie. The neighbourhood was still rocking with the\r\nshock of this when it was informed by Jan that Selina and Dirk ate with\r\ncandles lighted on the supper table. High Prairie slapped its thigh and\r\nhowled with mirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCabbages is beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Klaas Pool when he heard this.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCabbages is beautiful I betcha.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina, during the years of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s adolescence, had never urged him\r\nto a decision about his future. That, she decided, would come. As the\r\nfarm prospered and the pressure of necessity lifted she tried, in\r\nvarious ingenious ways, to extract from him some unconscious sign of\r\ndefinite preference for this calling, that profession. As in her leanest\r\ndays she had bought an occasional book at the cost of much-needed shoes\r\nfor herself so now she bought many of them with money that another woman\r\nwould have used for luxury or adornments. Years of personal privation\r\nhad not killed her love of fine soft silken things, mellow colouring,\r\nexquisite workmanship. But they had made it impossible for her to covet\r\nthese things for herself. She loved to see them, to feel them. Could not\r\nwear them. Years later, when she could well afford a French hat in one\r\nof the Michigan Avenue millinery shops, she would look at the silk and\r\nsatin trifles blooming in the windows like gay brilliant flowers in a\r\nconservatory\xe2\x80\x94and would buy an untrimmed \xe2\x80\x9cshape\xe2\x80\x9d for $2.95 in Field\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbasement. The habit of a lifetime is strong. Just once she made herself\r\nbuy one of these costly silk-and-feather extravagances, going about the\r\npurchase deliberately and coldly as a man gets drunk once for the\r\nexperience. The hat had cost twenty-two dollars. She never had worn it.\r\n\r\nUntil Dirk was sixteen she had been content to let him develop as\r\nnaturally as possible, and to absorb impressions unconsciously from the\r\ntraps she so guilefully left about him. Books on the lives of great\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x94lives of Lincoln, of Washington, Gladstone, Disraeli, Voltaire.\r\nHistory. Books on painting, charmingly illustrated. Books on\r\narchitecture; law; medicine, even. She subscribed to two of the best\r\nengineering magazines. There was a shed which he was free to use as a\r\nworkshop, fitted up with all sorts of tools. He did not use it much,\r\nafter the first few weeks. He was pleasantly and mildly interested in\r\nall these things; held by none of them. Selina had thought of Roelf when\r\nthey were fitting up the workshop. The Pools had heard from Roelf just\r\nonce since his flight from the farm. A letter had come from France. In\r\nit was a sum of money for Geertje and Jozina\xe2\x80\x94a small sum to take the\r\ntrouble to send all the way from an outlandish country, the well-to-do\r\nPool household thought. Geertje was married now to Vander Sijde\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\nGerrit and living on a farm out Low Prairie way. Jozina had a crazy idea\r\nthat she wanted to go into the city as a nurse. Roelf\xe2\x80\x99s small gift of\r\nmoney made little difference in their day. They never knew the struggle\r\nthat the impecunious young Paris art student had had to save it sou by\r\nsou. Selina had never heard from him. But one day years later she had\r\ncome running to Dirk with an illustrated magazine in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d she had cried, and pointed to a picture. He had rarely seen her\r\nso excited, so stirred. The illustration showed a photographic\r\nreproduction of a piece of sculpture\xe2\x80\x94a woman\xe2\x80\x99s figure. It was called\r\nThe Seine. A figure sinuous, snake-like, graceful, revolting, beautiful,\r\nterrible. The face alluring, insatiable, generous, treacherous, all at\r\nonce. It was the Seine that fed the fertile valley land; the Seine that\r\nclaimed a thousand bloated lifeless floating Things; the red-eyed hag of\r\n1793; the dimpling coquette of 1650. Beneath the illustration a line or\r\ntwo\xe2\x80\x94Roelf Pool . . . Salon . . . American . . . future . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Roelf!\xe2\x80\x9d Selina had cried. \xe2\x80\x9cRoelf. Little Roelf Pool!\xe2\x80\x9d Tears in her\r\neyes. Dirk had been politely interested. But then he had never known\r\nhim, really. He had heard his mother speak of him, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nSelina showed the picture to the Pools, driving over there one evening\r\nto surprise them with it. Mrs. Klaas Pool had been horrified at the\r\npicture of a nude woman\xe2\x80\x99s figure; had cried \xe2\x80\x9cOg heden!\xe2\x80\x9d in disgust, and\r\nhad seemed to think that Selina had brought it over in a spirit of\r\nspite. Was she going to show it to the rest of High Prairie!\r\n\r\nSelina understood High Prairie folk better now, though not altogether,\r\neven after almost twenty years of living amongst them. A cold people,\r\nyet kindly. Suspicious, yet generous. Distrustful of all change, yet\r\nprogressing by sheer force of thrift and unceasing labour. Unimaginative\r\nfor generations, only to produce\xe2\x80\x94a Roelf Pool.\r\n\r\nShe tried now to explain the meaning of the figure Roelf had moulded so\r\nmasterfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to represent the Seine. The River\r\nSeine that flows through Paris into the countryside beyond. The whole\r\nhistory of Paris\xe2\x80\x94of France\xe2\x80\x94is bound up in the Seine; intertwined with\r\nit. Terrible things, and magnificent things. It flows just beneath the\r\nLouvre. You can see it from the Bastille. On its largest island stands\r\nNotre Dame. The Seine has seen such things, Mrs. Pool!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _dom_ talk!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the late widow. \xe2\x80\x9cA river can\xe2\x80\x99t see.\r\nAnybody knows that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt seventeen Dirk and Selina talked of the year to come. He was going to\r\na university. But to what university? And what did he want to study?\r\nWe-e-ll, hard to say. Kind of a general course, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there? Some\r\nlanguages\xe2\x80\x94little French or something\xe2\x80\x94and political economy, and some\r\nliterature and maybe history.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina had said. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. General. Of course, if a person wanted to\r\nbe an architect, why, I suppose Cornell would be the place. Or Harvard\r\nfor law. Or Boston Tech for engineering, or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, yeh, if a fellow wanted any of those things. Good idea, though, to\r\ntake a kind of general course until you found out exactly what you\r\nwanted to do. Languages and literature and that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nSelina was rather delighted than otherwise. That, she knew, was the way\r\nthey did it in England. You sent your son to a university not to cram\r\nsome technical course into him, or to railroad him through a\r\nbook-knowledge of some profession. You sent him so that he might develop\r\nin an atmosphere of books, of learning; spending relaxed hours in the\r\ncompanionship of men who taught for the love of teaching; whose informal\r\ntalks before a study fire were more richly valuable than whole courses\r\nof classroom lectures. She had read of these things in English novels.\r\nOxford. Cambridge. Dons. Ivy. Punting. Prints. Mullioned windows. Books.\r\nDiscussion. Literary clubs.\r\n\r\nThis was England. An older civilization, of course. But there must be\r\nsomething of that in American universities. And if that was what Dirk\r\nwanted she was glad. Glad! A reaching after true beauty.\r\n\r\nYou heard such wonderful things about Midwest University, in Chicago. On\r\nthe south side. It was new, yes. But those Gothic buildings gave an\r\neffect, somehow, of age and permanence (the smoke and cinders from the\r\nIllinois Central suburban trains were largely responsible for that, as\r\nwell as the soft coal from a thousand neighbouring chimneys). And there\r\nactually was ivy. Undeniable ivy, and mullioned windows.\r\n\r\nDirk had suggested it, not she. The entrance requirements were quite\r\nmild. Harvard? Yale? Oh, those fellows all had wads of money. Eugene\r\nArnold had his own car at New Haven.\r\n\r\nIn that case, they decided, Midwest University, in Chicago, on the south\r\nside near the lake, would do splendidly. For a general course, sort of.\r\nThe world lay ahead of Dirk. It was like the childhood game of counting\r\nbuttons.\r\n\r\n    Rich man, poor man, beggar-man, thief,\r\n    Doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief.\r\n\r\nTogether they counted Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s mental buttons but it never came out twice\r\nthe same. It depended on the suit you happened to be wearing, of course.\r\nEugene Arnold was going to take law at Yale. He said it would be\r\nnecessary if he was going into the business. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t put it just that\r\nway, when talking to Dirk. He said the damned old hog business. Pauline\r\n(she insisted that they call her Paula now) was at a girls\xe2\x80\x99 school up\r\nthe Hudson\xe2\x80\x94one of those schools that never advertise even in the front\r\nof the thirty-five-cent magazines.\r\n\r\nSo, at eighteen, it had been Midwest University for Dirk. It was a much\r\nmore economical plan than would have resulted from the choice of an\r\neastern college. High Prairie heard that Dirk DeJong was going away to\r\ncollege. A neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s son said, \xe2\x80\x9cGoing to Wisconsin? Agricultural\r\ncourse there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy gosh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk had answered. He told this to Selina, laughing. But\r\nshe had not laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to take that course myself, if you must know. They say it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him, suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cDirk, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\ntake it, would you? To go to Madison, I mean. Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99d like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared. \xe2\x80\x9cMe! No! . . . Unless you want me to, Mother. Then I would,\r\ngladly. I hate your working like this, on the farm, while I go off to\r\nschool. It makes me feel kind of rotten, having my mother working for\r\nme. The other fellows\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m doing the work I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in, for the person I love best in the\r\nworld. I\xe2\x80\x99d be lost\xe2\x80\x94unhappy\xe2\x80\x94without the farm. If the city creeps up on\r\nme here, as they predict it will, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I shall do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Dirk had a prediction of his own to make. \xe2\x80\x9cChicago\xe2\x80\x99ll never grow\r\nthis way, with all those steel mills and hunkies to the south of us. The\r\nnorth side is going to be the place to live. It is already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place for whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the people with money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled then so that you saw the funny little wrinkle across her\r\nnose. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then the south section of Chicago is going to be all right\r\nfor us yet a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust you wait till I\xe2\x80\x99m successful. Then there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no more working for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98successful\xe2\x80\x99, Sobig?\xe2\x80\x9d She had not called him that\r\nin years. But now the old nickname came to her tongue perhaps because\r\nthey were speaking of his future, his success. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by\r\n\xe2\x80\x98successful\xe2\x80\x99, Sobig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRich. Lots of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, Dirk! No! That\xe2\x80\x99s not success. Roelf\xe2\x80\x94the thing Roelf\r\ndoes\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, if you have money enough you can buy the things he makes, and\r\nhave \xe2\x80\x99em. That\xe2\x80\x99s almost as good, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMidwest University had sprung up almost literally overnight on the\r\nproperty that had been the site of the Midway Plaisance during the\r\nWorld\xe2\x80\x99s Fair in Chicago in \xe2\x80\x9993. One man\xe2\x80\x99s millions had been the magic\r\nwand that, waved over a bare stretch of prairie land, had produced a\r\nseat of learning. The university guide book spoke of him reverently as\r\nthe Founder, capitalizing the word as one does the Deity. The student\r\nbody spoke of him with somewhat less veneration. They called him\r\nCoal-Oil Johnny. He had already given thirty millions to the university\r\nand still the insatiable maw of this institute of learning yawned for\r\nmore. When oil went up a fraction of a cent they said, \xe2\x80\x9cGuess Coal-Oil\r\nJohnny\xe2\x80\x99s fixing to feed us another million.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk commenced his studies at Midwest University in the autumn of 1909.\r\nHis first year was none too agreeable, as is usually the case in first\r\nyears. He got on well, though. A large proportion of the men students\r\nwere taking law, which accounts for the great number of real-estate\r\nsalesmen and insurance agents now doing business in and about Chicago.\r\nBefore the end of the first semester he was popular. He was a\r\nnatural-born floor committeeman and badges bloomed in his buttonhole.\r\nMerely by donning a ready-made dress suit he could give it a\r\nmade-to-order air. He had great natural charm of manner. The men liked\r\nhim, and the girls, too. He learned to say, \xe2\x80\x9cGot Pol Econ at ten,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nmeant that he took Political Economy at that hour; and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to cut\r\nPsyk,\xe2\x80\x9d meant that he was not up on his approaching lesson in Applied\r\nPsychology. He rarely \xe2\x80\x9ccut\xe2\x80\x9d a class. He would have felt that this was\r\nunfair and disloyal to his mother. Some of his fellow students joked\r\nabout this faithfulness to his classes. \xe2\x80\x9cPerson would think you were an\r\nUnclassified,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\r\n\r\nThe Unclassifieds were made up, for the most part, of earnest and rather\r\nmiddle-aged students whose education was a delayed blooming. They\r\nusually were not enrolled for a full course, or were taking double work\r\nfeverishly. The Classifieds, on the other hand, were the regularly\r\nenrolled students, pretty well of an age (between seventeen and\r\ntwenty-three) who took their education with a sprinkling of sugar. Of\r\nthe Unclassified students the University catalogue said:\r\n\r\n    Persons at least twenty-one years of age, not seeking a degree,\r\n    may be admitted through the office of the University Examiner to\r\n    the courses of instruction offered in the University, as\r\n    unclassified students. They shall present evidence of successful\r\n    experience as a teacher or _other valuable educative experience\r\n    in practical life_. . . . They are ineligible for public\r\n    appearance. . . .\r\n\r\nYou saw them the Cinderellas and the Smikes of this temple of learning.\r\n\r\nThe Classifieds and the Unclassifieds rarely mixed. Not age alone, but\r\npurpose separated them. The Classifieds, boys and girls, were, for the\r\nmost part, slim young lads with caps and pipes and sweaters, their talk\r\nof football, baseball, girls; slim young girls in sheer shirtwaists with\r\npink ribbons run through the corset covers showing beneath, pleated\r\nskirts that switched delightfully as they strolled across the campus arm\r\nin arm, their talk of football games, fudge, clothes, boys. They cut\r\nclasses whenever possible. The Student Body. Midwest turned them out by\r\nthe hundreds\xe2\x80\x94almost by the link, one might say, as Aug Hempel\xe2\x80\x99s sausage\r\nfactory turned out its fine plump sausages, each one exactly like the\r\none behind and the one ahead of it. So many hundreds graduated in this\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s class. So many more hundreds to be graduated in next year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclass. Occasionally an unruly sausage burst its skin and was discarded.\r\nThey attended a university because their parents\xe2\x80\x94thrifty shop-keepers,\r\nmanufacturers, merchants, or professional men and their good\r\nwives\xe2\x80\x94wanted their children to have an education. Were ambitious for\r\nthem. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it myself, and always regretted it. Now I want my\r\nboy (or girl) to have a good education that\xe2\x80\x99ll fit \xe2\x80\x99em for the battle of\r\nlife. This is an age of specialization, let me tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootball, fudge, I-said-to-Jim, I-said-to-Bessie.\r\n\r\nThe Unclassifieds would no more have deliberately cut a class than they\r\nwould have thrown their sparse weekly budget-allowance into the gutter.\r\nIf it had been physically possible they would have attended two classes\r\nat once, listened to two lectures, prepared two papers simultaneously.\r\nDrab and earnest women between thirty and forty-eight, their hair not an\r\nornament, but something to be pinned up quickly out of the way, their\r\nclothes a covering, their shoes not even smartly \xe2\x80\x9csensible,\xe2\x80\x9d but just\r\nshoes, scuffed, patched, utilitarian. The men were serious, shabby,\r\noften spectacled; dandruff on their coat collars; their lined, anxious\r\nfaces in curious contrast to the fresh, boyish, care-free countenances\r\nof the Classifieds. They said, carefully, almost sonorously, \xe2\x80\x9cPolitical\r\nEconomy. Applied Psychology.\xe2\x80\x9d Most of them had worked ten years, fifteen\r\nyears for this deferred schooling. This one had had to support a mother;\r\nthat one a family of younger brothers and sisters. This plump woman of\r\nthirty-nine, with the jolly kindly face, had had a paralyzed father.\r\nAnother had known merely poverty, grinding, sordid poverty, with fifteen\r\nyears of painful penny savings to bring true this gloriously realized\r\ndream of a university education. Here was one studying to be a trained\r\nSocial Service Worker. She had done everything from housework as a\r\nservant girl to clerking in a 5- and 10-cent store. She had studied\r\nevenings; saved pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters. _Other valuable\r\neducative experience in practical life._ They had had it, God knows.\r\n\r\nThey regarded the university at first with the love-blind eyes of a\r\nbridegroom who looks with the passionate tenderness of possession upon\r\nhis mistress for whom he has worked and waited through the years of his\r\nyouth. The university was to bring back that vanished youth\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsomething more. Wisdom. Knowledge. Power. Understanding. They would have\r\ndied for it\xe2\x80\x94they almost had, what with privation, self-denial, work.\r\n\r\nThey came with love clasped close in their two hands, an offertory.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI come with all I have. Devotion, hope, desire\r\nto learn, a promise to be a credit to you. I have had experience,\r\nbitter-sweet experience. I have known the battle. See, here are my\r\nscars. I can bring to your classrooms much that is valuable. I ask only\r\nfor bread\xe2\x80\x94the bread of knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the University gave them a stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet on to the hat!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Classifieds, humorously, crossing the\r\ncampus. \xe2\x80\x9cA fright!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe professors found them a shade too eager, perhaps; too inquiring;\r\ndemanding too much. They stayed after class and asked innumerable\r\nquestions. They bristled with interrogation. They were prone to hold\r\nforth in the classroom, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have found it to be the case in my\r\nexperience that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the professor preferred to do the lecturing himself. If there was to\r\nbe any experience related it should come from the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s platform,\r\nnot the student\xe2\x80\x99s chair. Besides, this sort of thing interfered with the\r\nroutine; kept you from covering ground fast enough. The period bell\r\nrang, and there you were, halfway through the day\xe2\x80\x99s prescribed lesson.\r\n\r\nIn his first year Dirk made the almost fatal mistake of being rather\r\nfriendly with one of these Unclassifieds\xe2\x80\x94a female Unclassified. She was\r\nin his Pol Econ class and sat next to him. A large, good-humoured, plump\r\ngirl, about thirty-eight, with a shiny skin which she never powdered and\r\nthick hair that exuded a disagreeable odour of oil. She was sympathetic\r\nand jolly, but her clothes were a fright, the Classifieds would have\r\ntold you, and no matter how cold the day there was always a half-moon of\r\nstain showing under her armpits. She had a really fine mind, quick,\r\neager, balanced, almost judicial. She knew just which references were\r\nvaluable, which useless. Just how to go about getting information for\r\nnext day\xe2\x80\x99s class; for the weekly paper to be prepared. Her name was\r\nSchwengauer\xe2\x80\x94Mattie Schwengauer. Terrible!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say good-naturedly, to Dirk. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t need to read\r\nall those. My, no! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get exactly what you want by\r\nreading pages 256 to 273 in Blaine\xe2\x80\x99s; 549 to 567 in Jaeckel; and the\r\nfirst eleven\xe2\x80\x94no, twelve\xe2\x80\x94pages of Trowbridge\xe2\x80\x99s report. That\xe2\x80\x99ll give you\r\npractically everything you need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk was grateful. Her notes were always copious, perfect. She never\r\nhesitated to let him copy them. They got in the way of walking out of\r\nthe classroom together, across the campus. She told him something of\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour people farmers!\xe2\x80\x9d Surprised, she looked at his well-cut clothes,\r\nhis slim, strong, unmarked hands, his smart shoes and cap. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, so are\r\nmine. Iowa.\xe2\x80\x9d She pronounced it Ioway. \xe2\x80\x9cI lived on the farm all my life\r\ntill I was twenty-seven. I always wanted to go away to school, but we\r\nnever had the money and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to town to earn because I was\r\nthe oldest, and Ma was sickly after Emma\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the youngest\xe2\x80\x94there are\r\nnine of us\xe2\x80\x94was born. Ma was anxious I should go and Pa was willing, but\r\nit couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. No fault of theirs. One year the summer would be so hot,\r\nwith no rain hardly from spring till fall, and the corn would just dry\r\nup on the stalks, like paper. The next year it would be so wet the seed\r\nwould rot in the ground. Ma died when I was twenty-six. The kids were\r\nall pretty well grown up by that time. Pa married again in a year and I\r\nwent to Des Moines to work. I stayed there six years but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t save\r\nmuch on account of my brother. He was kind of wild. He had come to Des\r\nMoines, too, after Pa married. He and Aggie\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the second\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t get along. I came to Chicago about five years ago. . . .\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve done all kinds of work, I guess, except digging in a coal mine. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave done that if I\xe2\x80\x99d had to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe told him all this ingenuously, simply. Dirk felt drawn toward her,\r\nsorry for her. His was a nature quick to sympathy. Something she said\r\nnow stirred him while it bewildered him a little, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t have any idea what it means to me to be here . . . All those\r\nyears! I used to dream about it. Even now it seems to me it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ntrue. I\xe2\x80\x99m conscious of my surroundings all the time and yet I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve them. You know, like when you are asleep and dream about\r\nsomething beautiful, and then wake up and find it\xe2\x80\x99s actually true. I get\r\na thrill out of just being here. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m crossing the campus,\xe2\x80\x99 I say to\r\nmyself. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a student\xe2\x80\x94a girl student\xe2\x80\x94in Midwest University and now\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m crossing the campus of my university to go to a class.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face was very greasy and earnest and fine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s great,\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk replied, weakly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s cer\xe2\x80\x99nly great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe told his mother about her. Usually he went home on Friday nights to\r\nstay until Monday morning. His first Monday-morning class was not until\r\nten. Selina was deeply interested and stirred. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she\xe2\x80\x99d spend\r\nsome Saturday and Sunday here with us on the farm? She could come with\r\nyou on Friday and go back Sunday night if she wanted to. Or stay until\r\nMonday morning and go back with you. There\xe2\x80\x99s the spare room, all quiet\r\nand cool. She could do as she liked. I\xe2\x80\x99d give her cream and all the\r\nfresh fruit and vegetables she wanted. And Meena would bake one of her\r\nfresh cocoanut cakes. I\xe2\x80\x99d have Adam bring a fresh cocoanut from South\r\nWater Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMattie came one Friday night. It was the end of October, and Indian\r\nsummer, the most beautiful time of the year on the Illinois prairie. A\r\nmellow golden light seemed to suffuse everything. It was as if the very\r\nair were liquid gold, and tonic. The squash and pumpkins next the good\r\nbrown earth gave back the glow, and the frost-turned leaves of the\r\nmaples in the sun. About the countryside for miles was the look of\r\nbounteousness, of plenty, of prophecy fulfilled as when a beautiful and\r\nfertile woman having borne her children and found them good, now sits\r\nserene-eyed, gracious, ample bosomed, satisfied.\r\n\r\nInto the face of Mattie Schwengauer there came a certain glory. When she\r\nand Selina clasped hands Selina stared at her rather curiously, as\r\nthough startled. Afterward she said to Dirk, aside, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you\r\nsaid she was ugly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she is, or\xe2\x80\x94well, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMattie Schwengauer was talking to Meena Bras, the houseworker. She was\r\nstanding with her hands on her ample hips, her fine head thrown back,\r\nher eyes alight, her lips smiling so that you saw her strong square\r\nteeth. A new cream separator was the subject of their conversation.\r\nSomething had amused Mattie. She laughed. It was the laugh of a young\r\ngirl, care-free, relaxed, at ease.\r\n\r\nFor two days Mattie did as she pleased, which meant she helped pull\r\nvegetables in the garden, milk the cows, saddle the horses; rode them\r\nwithout a saddle in the pasture. She tramped the road. She scuffled\r\nthrough the leaves in the woods, wore a scarlet maple leaf in her hair,\r\nslept like one gloriously dead from ten until six; ate prodigiously of\r\ncream, fruits, vegetables, eggs, sausage, cake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt got so I hated to do all those things on the farm,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nlaughing a little shamefacedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess it was because I had to. But\r\nnow it comes back to me and I enjoy it because it\xe2\x80\x99s natural to me, I\r\nsuppose. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m having a grand time, Mrs. DeJong. The grandest time\r\nI ever had in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d Her face was radiant and almost beautiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want me to believe that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mattie Schwengauer never did come again.\r\n\r\nEarly the next week one of the university students approached Dirk. He\r\nwas a Junior, very influential in his class, and a member of the\r\nfraternity to which Dirk was practically pledged. A decidedly desirable\r\nfrat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, look here, DeJong, I want to talk to you a minute. Uh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nto cut out that girl\xe2\x80\x94Swinegour or whatever her name is\xe2\x80\x94or it\xe2\x80\x99s all off\r\nwith the fellows in the frat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean! Cut out! What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatter! She\xe2\x80\x99s Unclassified, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she! And do you know what the story\r\nis? She told it herself as an economy hint to a girl who was working her\r\nway through. She bathes with her union suit and white stockings on to\r\nsave laundry soap. Scrubs \xe2\x80\x99em on her! \xe2\x80\x99S the God\xe2\x80\x99s truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInto Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s mind there flashed a picture of this large girl in her tight\r\nknitted union suit and her white stockings sitting in a tub half full of\r\nwater and scrubbing them and herself simultaneously. A comic picture,\r\nand a revolting one. Pathetic, too, but he would not admit that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagine!\xe2\x80\x9d the frat brother-to-be was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we can\xe2\x80\x99t have a\r\nfellow who goes around with a girl like that. You got to cut her out,\r\nsee! Completely. The fellahs won\xe2\x80\x99t stand for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk had a mental picture of himself striking a noble attitude and\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t stand for it, huh! She\xe2\x80\x99s worth more than the whole\r\ncaboodle of you put together. And you can all go to hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead he said, vaguely, \xe2\x80\x9cOh. Well. Uh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk changed his seat in the classroom, avoided Mattie\xe2\x80\x99s eye, shot out\r\nof the door the minute class was over. One day he saw her coming toward\r\nhim on the campus and he sensed that she intended to stop and speak to\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94chide him laughingly, perhaps. He quickened his pace, swerved a\r\nlittle to one side, and as he passed lifted his cap and nodded, keeping\r\nhis eyes straight ahead. Out of the tail of his eye he could see her\r\nstanding a moment irresolutely in the path.\r\n\r\nHe got into the fraternity. The fellahs liked him from the first. Selina\r\nsaid once or twice, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you bring that nice Mattie home with you\r\nagain some time soon? Such a nice girl\xe2\x80\x94woman, rather. But she seemed so\r\nyoung and care-free while she was here, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she? A fine mind, too,\r\nthat girl. She\xe2\x80\x99ll make something of herself. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see. Bring her next\r\nweek, h\xe2\x80\x99m?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk shuffled, coughed, looked away. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I dunno. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her\r\nlately. Guess she\xe2\x80\x99s busy with another crowd, or something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried not to think of what he had done, for he was honestly ashamed.\r\nTerribly ashamed. So he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what of it!\xe2\x80\x9d and hid his\r\nshame. A month later Selina again said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d invite Mattie for\r\nThanksgiving dinner. Unless she\xe2\x80\x99s going home, which I doubt. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nturkey and pumpkin pie and all the rest of it. She\xe2\x80\x99ll love it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMattie?\xe2\x80\x9d He had actually forgotten her name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right? Mattie Schwengauer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, her. Uh\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been seeing her lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Dirk, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t quarrelled with that nice girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe decided to have it out. \xe2\x80\x9cListen, Mother. There are a lot of different\r\ncrowds at the U, see? And Mattie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to any of \xe2\x80\x99em. You\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, but it\xe2\x80\x99s like this. She\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s smart and jolly and\r\neverything but she just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong. Being friends with a girl like\r\nthat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get you anywhere. Besides, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t a girl. She\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmiddle-aged woman, when you come to think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t get you anywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d Selina\xe2\x80\x99s tone was cool and even. Then, as\r\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s gaze did not meet hers: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Dirk DeJong, Mattie Schwengauer\r\nis one of my reasons for sending you to a university. She\xe2\x80\x99s what I call\r\npart of a university education. Just talking to her is learning\r\nsomething valuable. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t naturally prefer\r\npretty young girls of your own age to go around with, and all. It would\r\nbe queer if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t. But this Mattie\xe2\x80\x94why, she\xe2\x80\x99s life. Do you\r\nremember that story of when she washed dishes in the kosher restaurant\r\nover on Twelfth Street and the proprietor used to rent out dishes and\r\ncutlery for Irish and Italian neighbourhood weddings where they had pork\r\nand goodness knows what all, and then use them next day in the\r\nrestaurant again for the kosher customers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, Dirk remembered. Selina wrote Mattie, inviting her to the farm for\r\nThanksgiving, and Mattie answered gratefully, declining. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall always\r\nremember you,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote in that letter, \xe2\x80\x9cwith love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s Freshman year there were, for him, no heartening,\r\ninformal, mellow talks before the wood-fire in the book-lined study of\r\nsome professor whose wisdom was such a mixture of classic lore and\r\nmodernism as to be an inspiration to his listeners. Midwest professors\r\ndelivered their lectures in the classroom as they had been delivering\r\nthem in the past ten or twenty years and as they would deliver them\r\nuntil death or a trustees\xe2\x80\x99 meeting should remove them. The younger\r\nprofessors and instructors in natty gray suits and bright-coloured ties\r\nmade a point of being unpedantic in the classroom and rather overdid it.\r\nThey posed as being one of the fellows; would dashingly use a bit of\r\nslang to create a laugh from the boys and an adoring titter from the\r\ngirls. Dirk somehow preferred the pedants to these. When these had to\r\ngive an informal talk to the men before some university event they would\r\nstart by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow listen, fellahs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d At the dances they were not\r\nabove \xe2\x80\x9crushing\xe2\x80\x9d the pretty co-eds.\r\n\r\nTwo of Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s classes were conducted by women professors. They were well\r\non toward middle age, or past it; desiccated women. Only their eyes were\r\nalive. Their clothes were of some indefinite dark stuff, brown or\r\ndrab-gray; their hair lifeless; their hands long, bony, unvital. They\r\nhad seen classes and classes and classes. A roomful of fresh young faces\r\nthat appeared briefly only to be replaced by another roomful of fresh\r\nyoung faces like round white pencil marks manipulated momentarily on a\r\nslate, only to be sponged off to give way to other round white marks. Of\r\nthe two women one\xe2\x80\x94the elder\xe2\x80\x94was occasionally likely to flare into\r\nsudden life; a flame in the ashes of a burned-out grate. She had humour\r\nand a certain caustic wit, qualities that had managed miraculously to\r\nsurvive even the deadly and numbing effects of thirty years in the\r\nclassroom. A fine mind, and iconoclastic, hampered by the restrictions\r\nof a conventional community and the soul of a congenital spinster.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of these Dirk chafed and grew restless. Miss Euphemia\r\nHollingswood had a way of emphasizing every third or fifth syllable,\r\nbringing her voice down hard on it, thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the _con_sideration of _all_ the facts in the _case_ presented\r\nbe_fore_ us we must _first_ review the _his_tory and at_tempt_ to\r\nanalyze the _out_standing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe found himself waiting for that emphasis and shrinking from it as from\r\na sledge-hammer blow. It hurt his head.\r\n\r\nMiss Lodge droned. She approached a word with a maddening uh-uh-uh-uh.\r\nIn the uh-uh-uh face of the uh-uh-uh-uh geometrical situation of the\r\nuh-uh-uh uh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe shifted restlessly in his chair, found his hands clenched into fists,\r\nand took refuge in watching the shadow cast by an oak branch outside the\r\nwindow on a patch of sunlight against the blackboard behind her.\r\n\r\nDuring the early spring Dirk and Selina talked things over again, seated\r\nbefore their own fireplace in the High Prairie farmhouse. Selina had had\r\nthat fireplace built five years before and her love of it amounted to\r\nfire-worship. She had it lighted always on winter evenings and in the\r\nspring when the nights were sharp. In Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s absence she would sit\r\nbefore it at night long after the rest of the weary household had gone\r\nto bed. Old Pom, the mongrel, lay stretched at her feet enjoying such\r\nluxury in old age as he had never dreamed of in his bastard youth. High\r\nPrairie, driving by from some rare social gathering or making a late\r\ntrip to market as they sometimes were forced to do, saw the rosy flicker\r\nof Mrs. DeJong\xe2\x80\x99s fire dancing on the wall and warmed themselves by it\r\neven while they resented it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good heater in there and yet anyway she\xe2\x80\x99s got to have a fire going in\r\na grate. Always she does something funny like that. I should think she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe lonesome sitting there like that with her dog only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey never knew how many guests Selina entertained there before her fire\r\nthose winter evenings\xe2\x80\x94old friends and new. Sobig was there, the plump\r\nearth-grimed baby who rolled and tumbled in the fields while his young\r\nmother wiped the sweat from her face to look at him with fond eyes. Dirk\r\nDeJong of ten years hence was there. Simeon Peake, dapper, soft-spoken,\r\nironic, in his shiny boots and his hat always a little on one side.\r\nPervus DeJong, a blue-shirted giant with strong tender hands and little\r\nfine golden hairs on the backs of them. Fanny Davenport, the\r\nactress-idol of her girlhood came back to her, smiling, bowing; and the\r\ngorgeous spangled creatures in the tights and bodices of the old\r\nExtravaganzas. In strange contrast to these was the patient, tireless\r\nfigure of Maartje Pool standing in the doorway of Roelf\xe2\x80\x99s little shed,\r\nher arms tucked in her apron for warmth. \xe2\x80\x9cYou make fun, huh?\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nwistfully, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and Roelf. You make fun.\xe2\x80\x9d And Roelf, the dark vivid boy,\r\nmisunderstood. Roelf, the genius. He was always one of the company.\r\n\r\nOh, Selina DeJong never was lonely on these winter evenings before her\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nShe and Dirk sat there one fine sharp evening in early April. It was\r\nSaturday. Of late Dirk had not always come to the farm for the week-end.\r\nEugene and Paula Arnold had been home for the Easter holidays. Julie\r\nArnold had invited Dirk to the gay parties at the Prairie Avenue house.\r\nHe had even spent two entire week-ends there. After the brocaded luxury\r\nof the Prairie Avenue house his farm bedroom seemed almost startlingly\r\nstark and bare. Selina frankly enjoyed Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat fragmentary\r\naccounts of these visits; extracted from them as much vicarious pleasure\r\nas he had had in the reality\xe2\x80\x94more, probably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow tell me what you had to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, sociably, like a\r\nchild. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you have for dinner, for example? Was it grand? Julie\r\ntells me they have a butler now. Well! I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait till I hear Aug\r\nHempel on the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would tell her of the grandeurs of the Arnold m\xc3\xa9nage. She would\r\ninterrupt and exclaim: \xe2\x80\x9cMayonnaise! On fruit! Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike _that_. You did! Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have it for you next week when you come\r\nhome. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the recipe from Julie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99d be home next week. One of the fellows he\xe2\x80\x99d met at\r\nthe Arnolds\xe2\x80\x99 had invited him to their place out north, on the lake. He\r\nhad a boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll be lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d Selina exclaimed, after an almost unnoticeable\r\nmoment of silence\xe2\x80\x94silence with panic in it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try not to fuss and\r\nbe worried like an old hen every minute of the time I think you\xe2\x80\x99re on\r\nthe water. . . . Now do go on, Sobig. First fruit with mayonnaise, h\xe2\x80\x99m?\r\nWhat kind of soup?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not a naturally talkative person. There was nothing surly about\r\nhis silence. It was a taciturn streak inherited from his Dutch ancestry.\r\nThis time, though, he was more voluble than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cPaula . . .\xe2\x80\x9d came\r\nagain and again into his conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cPaula . . . Paula . . .\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nagain \xe2\x80\x9c. . . Paula.\xe2\x80\x9d He did not seem conscious of the repetition, but\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s quick ear caught it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said, \xe2\x80\x9csince she went away to school the\r\nfirst year. She must be\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s see\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s a year older than you are.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s nineteen going on twenty. Last time I saw her I thought she was a\r\ndark scrawny little thing. Too bad she didn\xe2\x80\x99t inherit Julie\xe2\x80\x99s lovely\r\ngold colouring and good looks, instead of Eugene, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk, hotly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s dark and slim and sort\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94uh\xe2\x80\x94sensuous\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Selina started visibly, and raised her hand quickly\r\nto her mouth to hide a smile\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clike Cleopatra. Her eyes are big and kind\r\nof slanting\xe2\x80\x94not squinty I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean, but slanting up a little at the\r\ncorners. Cut out, kind of, so that they look bigger than most people\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy eyes used to be considered rather fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, mischievously;\r\nbut he did not hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe makes all the other girls look sort of blowzy.\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent a\r\nmoment. Selina was silent, too, and it was not a happy silence. Dirk\r\nspoke again, suddenly, as though continuing aloud a train of thought,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94all but her hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina made her voice sound natural, not sharply inquisitive. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe matter with her hands, Dirk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pondered a moment, his brows knitted. At last, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow. They\xe2\x80\x99re brown, and awfully thin and sort of\xe2\x80\x94grabby. I mean it\r\nmakes me nervous to watch them. And when the rest of her is cool they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nhot when you touch them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at his mother\xe2\x80\x99s hands that were busy with some sewing. The\r\nstuff on which she was working was a bit of satin ribbon; part of a hood\r\nintended to grace the head of Geertje Pool Vander Sijde\xe2\x80\x99s second baby.\r\nShe had difficulty in keeping her rough fingers from catching on the\r\nsoft surface of the satin. Manual work, water, sun, and wind had tanned\r\nthose hands, hardened them, enlarged the knuckles, spread them,\r\nroughened them. Yet how sure they were, and strong, and cool and\r\nreliable\xe2\x80\x94and tender. Suddenly, looking at them, Dirk said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow your\r\nhands. I love your hands, Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put down her work hastily, yet quietly, so that the sudden rush of\r\nhappy grateful tears in her eyes should not sully the pink satin ribbon.\r\nShe was flushed, like a girl. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you, Sobig?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment she took up her sewing again. Her face looked young,\r\neager, fresh, like the face of the girl who had found cabbages so\r\nbeautiful that night when she bounced along the rutty Halsted road with\r\nKlaas Pool, many years ago. It came into her face, that look, when she\r\nwas happy, exhilarated, excited. That was why those who loved her and\r\nbrought that look into her face thought her beautiful, while those who\r\ndid not love her never saw the look and consequently considered her a\r\nplain woman.\r\n\r\nThere was another silence between the two. Then: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, what would you\r\nthink of my going East next fall, to take a course in architecture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like that, Dirk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think so\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99d like it better than anything in the world. I\xe2\x80\x94it makes me\r\nhappy just to think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would\xe2\x80\x94cost an awful lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll manage. I\xe2\x80\x99ll manage. . . . What made you decide on architecture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, exactly. The new buildings at the university\xe2\x80\x94Gothic, you\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94are such a contrast to the old. Then Paula and I were talking the\r\nother day. She hates their house on Prairie\xe2\x80\x94terrible old lumpy gray\r\nstone pile, with the black of the I. C. trains all over it. She wants\r\nher father to build north\xe2\x80\x94an Italian villa or French ch\xc3\xa2teau. Something\r\nof that sort. So many of her friends are moving to the north shore, away\r\nfrom these hideous south-side and north-side Chicago houses with their\r\nstoops, and their bay windows, and their terrible turrets. Ugh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina remonstrated mildly, \xe2\x80\x9cI like \xe2\x80\x99em. I\r\nsuppose I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, but to me they seem sort of natural and solid and\r\nunpretentious, like the clothes that old August Hempel wears, so\r\nsquarecut and baggy. Those houses look dignified to me, and fitting.\r\nThey may be ugly\xe2\x80\x94probably are\xe2\x80\x94but anyway they\xe2\x80\x99re not ridiculous. They\r\nhave a certain rugged grandeur. They\xe2\x80\x99re Chicago. Those French and\r\nItalian gimcracky things they\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re incongruous. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if Abraham\r\nLincoln were to appear suddenly in pink satin knee breeches and buckled\r\nshoes, and lace ruffles at his wrists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk could laugh at that picture. But he protested, too. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nnative architecture, so what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done! You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call those\r\nsmoke-blackened old stone and brick piles with their iron fences and\r\ntheir conservatories and cupolas and gingerbread exactly native, would\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cbut those Italian villas and French ch\xc3\xa2teaux in\r\nnorth Chicago suburbs are a good deal like a lace evening gown in the\r\nArizona desert. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep you cool in the daytime, and it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be warm enough at night. I suppose a native architecture is\r\nevolved from building for the local climate and the needs of the\r\ncommunity, keeping beauty in mind as you go. We don\xe2\x80\x99t need turrets and\r\ntowers any more than we need draw-bridges and moats. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right to\r\nkeep them, I suppose, where they grew up, in a country where the feudal\r\nsystem meant that any day your next-door neighbour might take it into\r\nhis head to call his gang around him and sneak up to steal your wife and\r\ntapestries and gold drinking cups.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk was interested and amused. Talks with his mother were likely to\r\naffect him thus. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your idea of a real Chicago house, Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina answered quickly, as if she had thought often about it; as if she\r\nwould have liked just such a dwelling on the site of the old DeJong\r\nfarmhouse in which they now were seated so comfortably. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it would\r\nneed big porches for the hot days and nights so\xe2\x80\x99s to catch the\r\nprevailing southwest winds from the prairies in the summer\xe2\x80\x94a porch that\r\nwould be swung clear around to the east, too\xe2\x80\x94or a terrace or another\r\nporch east so that if the precious old lake breeze should come up just\r\nwhen you think you\xe2\x80\x99re dying of the heat, as it sometimes does, you could\r\ncatch that, too. It ought to be built\xe2\x80\x94the house, I mean\xe2\x80\x94rather\r\nsquarish and tight and solid against our cold winters and north-easters.\r\nThen sleeping porches, of course. There\xe2\x80\x99s a grand American institution\r\nfor you! England may have its afternoon tea on the terrace, and Spain\r\nmay have its patio, and France its courtyard, and Italy its pergola,\r\nvine-covered; but America\xe2\x80\x99s got the sleeping porch\xe2\x80\x94the screened-in\r\nopen-air sleeping porch, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if the man who first\r\nthought of that would get precedence, on Judgment Day, over the men who\r\ninvented the aeroplane, the talking machine, and the telephone. After\r\nall, he had nothing in mind but the health of the human race.\xe2\x80\x9d After\r\nwhich grand period Selina grinned at Dirk, and Dirk grinned at Selina\r\nand the two giggled together there by the fireplace, companionably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, you\xe2\x80\x99re simply wonderful!\xe2\x80\x94only your native Chicago dwelling\r\nseems to be mostly porch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina waved such carping criticism away with a careless hand. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nwell, any house that has enough porches, and two or three bathrooms and\r\nat least eight closets can be lived in comfortably, no matter what else\r\nit has or hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext day they were more serious. The eastern college and the\r\narchitectural career seemed to be settled things. Selina was content,\r\nhappy. Dirk was troubled about the expense. He spoke of it at breakfast\r\nnext morning (Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast; his mother had had hers hours before and\r\nnow as he drank his coffee, was sitting with him a moment and glancing\r\nat the paper that had come in the rural mail delivery). She had been out\r\nin the fields overseeing the transplanting of young tomato seedlings\r\nfrom hotbed to field. She wore an old gray sweater buttoned up tight,\r\nfor the air was still sharp. On her head was a battered black felt soft\r\nhat (an old one of Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s) much like the one she had worn to the\r\nHaymarket that day ten years ago. Selina\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks were faintly pink from\r\nher walk across the fields in the brisk morning air.\r\n\r\nShe sniffed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat coffee smells wonderful. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll just\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\npoured herself a half cup with the air of virtue worn by one who really\r\nlongs for a whole cup and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cthe expense\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPigs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, serenely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPigs!\xe2\x80\x9d He looked around, bewildered; stared at his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPigs\xe2\x80\x99ll do it,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina explained, calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting to put\r\nthem in for three or four years. It\xe2\x80\x99s August Hempel\xe2\x80\x99s idea. Hogs, I\r\nshould have said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain, as before, he echoed, \xe2\x80\x9cHogs!\xe2\x80\x9d rather faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh-bred hogs. They\xe2\x80\x99re worth their weight in silver this minute, and\r\nwill be for years to come. I won\xe2\x80\x99t go in for them extensively. Just\r\nenough to make an architect out of Mr. Dirk DeJong.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, at the\r\nexpression in his face: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look so pained, son. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nrevolting about a hog\xe2\x80\x94not my kind, brought up in a pen as sanitary as a\r\ntiled bathroom and fed on corn. He\xe2\x80\x99s a handsome, impressive-looking\r\nanimal, the hog, when he isn\xe2\x80\x99t treated like one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked dejected. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather not go to school on\xe2\x80\x94hogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took off the felt hat and tossed it over to the old couch by the\r\nwindow; smoothed her hair back with the flat of her palm. You saw that\r\nthe soft dark hair was liberally sprinkled with gray now, but the eyes\r\nwere bright and clear as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Sobig, this is what they call a paying farm\xe2\x80\x94as vegetable\r\nfarms go. We\xe2\x80\x99re out of debt, the land\xe2\x80\x99s in good shape, the crop promises\r\nwell if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have another rainy cold spring like last year\xe2\x80\x99s. But no\r\ntruck garden is going to make its owner rich these days, with labour so\r\nhigh and the market what it is, and the expense of hauling and all. Any\r\ntruck farmer who comes out even thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s come out ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather miserably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell. I\xe2\x80\x99m not complaining, son. I\xe2\x80\x99m just telling you. I\xe2\x80\x99m having a\r\ngrand time. When I see the asparagus plantation actually yielding, that\r\nI planted ten years ago, I\xe2\x80\x99m as happy as if I\xe2\x80\x99d stumbled on a gold mine.\r\nI think, sometimes, of the way your father objected to my planting the\r\nfirst one. April, like this, in the country, with everything coming up\r\ngreen and new in the rich black loam\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. And when I know\r\nthat it goes to market as food\xe2\x80\x94the best kind of food, that keeps\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s bodies clean and clear and flexible and strong! I like to think\r\nof babies\xe2\x80\x99 mothers saying: \xe2\x80\x98Now eat your spinach, every scrap, or you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t have any dessert! . . . Carrots make your eyes bright. . . .\r\nFinish your potato. Potatoes make you strong!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina laughed, flushed a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but how about hogs? Do you feel that way about hogs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, briskly. She pushed toward him a little\r\nblue-and-white platter that lay on the white cloth near her elbow. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\na bit more bacon, Dirk. One of these nice curly slivers that are so\r\ncrisp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve finished my breakfast, Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose.\r\n\r\nThe following autumn saw him a student of architecture at Cornell. He\r\nworked hard, studied even during his vacations. He would come home to\r\nthe heat and humidity of the Illinois summers and spend hours each day\r\nin his own room that he had fitted up with a long work table and a\r\ndrawing board. His T-square was at hand; two triangles\xe2\x80\x94a 45 and a 60;\r\nhis compass; a pair of dividers. Selina sometimes stood behind him\r\nwatching him as he carefully worked on the tracing paper. His contempt\r\nfor the local architecture was now complete. Especially did he hold\r\nforth on the subject of the apartment-houses that were mushrooming on\r\nevery street in Chicago from Hyde Park on the south to Evanston on the\r\nnorth. Chicago was very elegant in speaking of these; never called them\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cflats\xe2\x80\x9d; always apartments. In front of each of these (there were\r\nusually six to a building), was stuck a little glass-enclosed cubicle\r\nknown as a sun-parlour. In these (sometimes you heard them spoken of,\r\ngrandly, as solariums) Chicago dwellers took refuge from the leaden\r\nskies, the heavy lake atmosphere, the gray mist and fog and smoke that\r\nso frequently swathed the city in gloom. They were done in yellow or\r\nrose cretonnes. Silk lamp shades glowed therein, and flower-laden boxes.\r\nIn these frank little boxes Chicago read its paper, sewed, played\r\nbridge, even ate its breakfast. It never pulled down the shades.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerrible!\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk fumed. \xe2\x80\x9cNot only are they hideous in themselves, stuck\r\non the front of those houses like three pairs of spectacles; but the\r\nlack of decent privacy! They do everything but bathe in \xe2\x80\x99em. Have they\r\nnever heard the advice given people who live in glass houses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy his junior year he was talking in a large way about the Beaux Arts.\r\nBut Selina did not laugh at this. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWho can tell!\r\nAfter a year or two in an office here, why not another year of study in\r\nParis if he needs it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough it was her busiest time on the farm Selina went to Ithaca for his\r\ngraduation in 1913. He was twenty-two and, she was calmly sure, the\r\nbest-looking man in his class. Undeniably he was a figure to please the\r\neye; tall, well-built, as his father had been, and blond, too, like his\r\nfather, except for his eyes. These were brown\xe2\x80\x94not so dark as Selina\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nbut with some of the soft liquid quality of her glance. They\r\nstrengthened his face, somehow; gave him an ardent look of which he was\r\nnot conscious. Women, feeling the ardour of that dark glance turned upon\r\nthem, were likely to credit him with feelings toward themselves of which\r\nhe was quite innocent. They did not know that the glance and its effect\r\nwere mere matters of pigmentation and eye-conformation. Then, too, the\r\ngaze of a man who talks little is always more effective than that of one\r\nwho is loquacious.\r\n\r\nSelina, in her black silk dress, and her plain black hat, and her\r\nsensible shoes was rather a quaint little figure amongst all those\r\nvivacious, bevoiled, and beribboned mammas. But a distinctive little\r\nfigure, too. Dirk need not be ashamed of her. She eyed the rather\r\npaunchy, prosperous, middle-aged fathers and thought, with a pang, how\r\nmuch handsomer Pervus would have been than any of these, if only he\r\ncould have lived to see this day. Then, involuntarily, she wondered if\r\nthis day would ever have occurred, had Pervus lived. Chided herself for\r\nthinking thus.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Chicago, Dirk went into the office of Hollis &\r\nSprague, Architects. He thought himself lucky to work with this firm,\r\nfor it was doing much to guide Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s taste in architecture away from\r\nthe box car. Already Michigan Boulevard\xe2\x80\x99s skyline soared somewhat above\r\nthe grimly horizontal. But his work there was little more than that of\r\ndraughtsman, and his weekly stipend could hardly be dignified by the\r\nterm of salary. But he had large ideas about architecture and he found\r\nexpression for his suppressed feelings on his week-ends spent with\r\nSelina at the farm. \xe2\x80\x9cBaroque\xe2\x80\x9d was the word with which he dismissed the\r\nnew Beachside Hotel, north. He said the new Lincoln Park band-stand\r\nlooked like an igloo. He said that the city council ought to order the\r\nPotter Palmer mansion destroyed as a blot on the landscape, and waxed\r\nprofane on the subject of the east face of the Public Library Building,\r\ndown town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina assured him, happily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was all thrown up so\r\nhastily. Remember that just yesterday, or the day before, Chicago was an\r\nIndian fort, with tepees where towers are now, and mud wallows in place\r\nof asphalt. Beauty needs time to perfect it. Perhaps we\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting\r\nall these years for just such youngsters as you. And maybe some day I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe driving down Michigan Boulevard with a distinguished visitor\xe2\x80\x94Roelf\r\nPool, perhaps. Why not? Let\xe2\x80\x99s say Roelf Pool, the famous sculptor. And\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x98Who designed that building\xe2\x80\x94the one that is so strong and\r\nyet so light? So gay and graceful, and yet so reticent!\xe2\x80\x99 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that! That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the earlier efforts of my son, Dirk DeJong.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Dirk pulled at his pipe moodily; shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow, Mother. It\xe2\x80\x99s so damned slow. First thing you know I\xe2\x80\x99ll be thirty.\r\nAnd what am I! An office boy\xe2\x80\x94or little more than that\xe2\x80\x94at Hollis\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring his university years Dirk had seen much of the Arnolds, Eugene\r\nand Paula, but it sometimes seemed to Selina that he avoided these\r\nmeetings\xe2\x80\x94these parties and week-ends. She was content that this should\r\nbe so, for she guessed that the matter of money held him back. She\r\nthought it was well that he should realize the difference now. Eugene\r\nhad his own car\xe2\x80\x94one of five in the Arnold garage. Paula, too, had hers.\r\nShe had been one of the first Chicago girls to drive a gas car; had\r\nbreezed about Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s boulevards in one when she had been little more\r\nthan a child in short skirts. At the wheel she was dexterous,\r\ndare-devil, incredibly relaxed. Her fascination for Dirk was strong.\r\nSelina knew that, too. In the last year or two he had talked very little\r\nof Paula and that, Selina knew, meant that he was hard hit.\r\n\r\nSometimes Paula and Eugene drove out to the farm, making the distance\r\nfrom their new north-shore house to the DeJong place far south in some\r\nbreath-taking number of minutes. Eugene would appear in rakish cap,\r\nloose London coat, knickers, queer brogans with an English look about\r\nthem, a carefully careless looseness about the hang and fit of his\r\njacket. Paula did not affect sports clothes for herself. She was not the\r\ntype, she said. Slim, dark, vivacious, she wore slinky clothes\xe2\x80\x94cr\xc3\xaapes,\r\nchiffons. Her feet were slim in sheer silk stockings and slippers with\r\nbuckles. Her eyes were languorous, lovely. She worshipped luxury and\r\nsaid so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to marry money,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that they\xe2\x80\x99ve finished\r\ncalling poor Grandpa a beef-baron and taken I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many\r\nmillions away from him, we\xe2\x80\x99re practically on the streets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look it!\xe2\x80\x9d from Dirk; and there was bitterness beneath his light\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s true. All this silly muckraking in the past ten years or\r\nmore. Poor Father! Of course Grand-dad was pur-ty rough, let me tell\r\nyou. I read some of the accounts of that last indictment\xe2\x80\x94the 1910\r\none\xe2\x80\x94and I must say I gathered that dear old Aug made Jesse James look\r\nlike a philanthropist. I should think, at his age, he\xe2\x80\x99d be a little\r\nscared. After all, when you\xe2\x80\x99re over seventy you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to have some\r\ndoubts and fears about punishment in the next world. But not a grand old\r\npirate like Grandfather. He\xe2\x80\x99ll sack and burn and plunder until he goes\r\ndown with the ship. And it looks to me as if the old boat had a pretty\r\nstrong list to starboard right now. Father says himself that unless a\r\nwar breaks, or something, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all likely, the packing\r\nindustry is going to spring a leak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElaborate figure of speech,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Eugene. The four of them\xe2\x80\x94Paula,\r\nDirk, Eugene, and Selina\xe2\x80\x94, were sitting on the wide screened porch that\r\nSelina had had built at the southwest corner of the house. Paula was, of\r\ncourse, in the couch-swing. Occasionally she touched one slim languid\r\nfoot to the floor and gave indolent impetus to the couch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, rather, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Might as well finish it, then. Darling Aug\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen the grand old captain right through the vi\xe2\x80\x99age. Dad\xe2\x80\x99s never been\r\nmore than a pretty bum second mate. And as for you, Gene my love, cabin\r\nboy would be, y\xe2\x80\x99understand me, big.\xe2\x80\x9d Eugene had gone into the business a\r\nyear before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you expect,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Eugene, \xe2\x80\x9cof a lad that hates salt pork?\r\nAnd every other kind of pig meat?\xe2\x80\x9d He despised the yards and all that\r\nwent with it.\r\n\r\nSelina now got up and walked to the end of the porch. She looked out\r\nacross the fields, shading her eyes with her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Adam coming\r\nin with the last load for the day. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be driving into town now.\r\nCornelius started an hour ago.\xe2\x80\x9d The DeJong farm sent two great loads to\r\nthe city now. Selina was contemplating the purchase of one of the large\r\nautomobile trucks that would do away with the plodding horses and save\r\nhours of time on the trip. She went down the steps now on her way to\r\noversee the loading of Adam Bras\xe2\x80\x99s wagon. At the bottom of the steps she\r\nturned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t you two stay to supper? You can quarrel comfortably\r\nright through the meal and drive home in the cool of the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paula, \xe2\x80\x9cthanks. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll have all kinds of\r\nvegetables, cooked and uncooked. The cooked ones smothered in cream and\r\noozing butter. And let me go out into the fields and pick \xe2\x80\x99em myself\r\nlike Maud Muller or Marie Antoinette or any of those make-believe rustic\r\ngals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn her French-heeled slippers and her filmy silk stockings she went out\r\ninto the rich black furrows of the fields, Dirk carrying the basket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsparagus,\xe2\x80\x9d she ordered first. Then, \xe2\x80\x9cBut where is it? Is _that_ it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dig for it, idiot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk, stooping, and taking from his basket\r\nthe queerly curved sharp knife or spud used for cutting the asparagus\r\nshoots. \xe2\x80\x9cCut the shoots three or four inches below the surface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let me do it!\xe2\x80\x9d She was down on her silken knees in the dirt, ruined\r\na goodly patch of the fine tender shoots, gave it up and sat watching\r\nDirk\xe2\x80\x99s expert manipulation of the knife. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have radishes, and corn,\r\nand tomatoes and lettuce and peas and artichokes and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArtichokes grow in California, not Illinois.\xe2\x80\x9d He was more than usually\r\nuncommunicative, and noticeably moody.\r\n\r\nPaula remarked it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the Othello brow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that rot, did you? about marrying a rich man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I meant it. What other sort of man do you think I ought to\r\nmarry?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her, silently. She smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I make an\r\nideal bride for a farmer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a farmer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, architect then. Your job as draughtsman at Hollis & Sprague\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmust pay you all of twenty-five a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-five,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk, grimly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that got to do with it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a thing, darling.\xe2\x80\x9d She stuck out one foot. \xe2\x80\x9cThese slippers cost\r\nthirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be getting thirty-five a week all my life. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got brains\r\nenough to know that. Eugene wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be getting that much if he weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe son of his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe grandson of his grandfather,\xe2\x80\x9d Paula corrected him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m not so\r\nsure he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Gene\xe2\x80\x99s a born mechanic if they\xe2\x80\x99d just let him work at\r\nit. He\xe2\x80\x99s crazy about engines and all that junk. But no\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Millionaire\r\nPacker\xe2\x80\x99s Son Learns Business from Bottom Rung of Ladder.\xe2\x80\x99 Picture of\r\nGene in workman\xe2\x80\x99s overalls and cap in the Sunday papers. He drives to\r\nthe office on Michigan at ten and leaves at four and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know a\r\nsteer from a cow when he sees it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn about Gene. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about you. You were joking,\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99d hate being poor, or even just moderately rich. I\xe2\x80\x99m used\r\nto money\xe2\x80\x94loads of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m twenty-four. And I\xe2\x80\x99m looking around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kicked an innocent beet-top with his boot. \xe2\x80\x9cYou like me better than\r\nany man you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do. Just my luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, let\xe2\x80\x99s take these weggibles in and have \xe2\x80\x99em cooked in cream,\r\nas ordered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made a pretense of lifting the heavy basket. Dirk snatched it\r\nroughly out of her hand so that she gave a little cry and looked\r\nruefully down at the red mark on her palm. He caught her by the\r\nshoulder\xe2\x80\x94even shook her a little. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Paula. Do you mean to\r\ntell me you\xe2\x80\x99d marry a man simply because he happened to have a lot of\r\nmoney!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not simply because he had a lot of money. But it certainly\r\nwould be a factor, among other things. Certainly he would be preferable\r\nto a man who knocked me about the fields as if I were a bag of\r\npotatoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, forgive me. But\xe2\x80\x94listen, Paula\xe2\x80\x94you know I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94gosh!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 And there I\r\nam stuck in an architect\xe2\x80\x99s office and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be years before I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be years before I meet the millions I require,\r\ntoo. So why bother? And even if I do, you and I can be just as good\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, shut up. Don\xe2\x80\x99t pull that ing\xc3\xa9nue stuff on me, please. Remember I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nknown you since you were ten years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know just how black my heart is, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, what? You want,\r\nreally, some nice hearty lass who can tell asparagus from peas when she\r\nsees \xe2\x80\x99em, and who\xe2\x80\x99ll offer to race you from here to the kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSix months later Paula Arnold was married to Theodore A. Storm, a man of\r\nfifty, a friend of her father\xe2\x80\x99s, head of so many companies, stockholder\r\nin so many banks, director of so many corporations that even old Aug\r\nHempel seemed a recluse from business in comparison. She never called\r\nhim Teddy. No one ever did. Theodore Storm was a large man\xe2\x80\x94not exactly\r\nstout, perhaps, but flabby. His inches saved him from grossness. He had\r\na large white serious face, fine thick dark hair, graying at the\r\ntemples, and he dressed very well except for a leaning toward rather\r\neffeminate ties. He built for Paula a town house on the Lake Shore drive\r\nin the region known as the Gold Coast. The house looked like a\r\nrestrained public library. There was a country place beyond Lake Forest\r\nfar out on the north shore, sloping down to the lake and surrounded by\r\nacres and acres of fine woodland, expertly parked. There were drives,\r\nravines, brooks, bridges, hothouses, stables, a race-track, gardens,\r\ndairies, fountains, bosky paths, keeper\xe2\x80\x99s cottage (twice the size of\r\nSelina\xe2\x80\x99s farmhouse). Within three years Paula had two children, a boy\r\nand a girl. \xe2\x80\x9cThere! That\xe2\x80\x99s done,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Her marriage was a great\r\nmistake and she knew it. For the war, coming in 1914, a few months after\r\nher wedding, sent the Hempel-Arnold interests sky-rocketing. Millions of\r\npounds of American beef and pork were shipped to Europe. In two years\r\nthe Hempel fortune was greater than it ever had been. Paula was up to\r\nher eyes in relief work for Bleeding Belgium. All the Gold Coast was.\r\nThe Beautiful Mrs. Theodore A. Storm in her Gift Shop Conducted for the\r\nRelief of Bleeding Belgium.\r\n\r\nDirk had not seen her in months. She telephoned him unexpectedly one\r\nFriday afternoon in his office at Hollis & Sprague\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome out and spend Saturday and Sunday with us, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nrunning away to the country this afternoon. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sick of Bleeding\r\nBelgium, you can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine. I\xe2\x80\x99m sending the children out this morning. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get away so early. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call for you in the roadster this\r\nafternoon at four and drive you out myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to spend the week-end with Mother. She\xe2\x80\x99s expecting me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring her along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come. You know she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy all that velvet-footed\r\nservitor stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but we live quite simply out there, really. Just sort of rough it.\r\nDo come, Dirk. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some plans to talk over with you . . . How\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\njob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, good enough. There\xe2\x80\x99s very little building going on, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call for you at four. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be at the curb. Don\xe2\x80\x99t keep me waiting,\r\nwill you? The cops fuss so if you park in the Loop after four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XV\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun along!\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, when he called her on the farm telephone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll do you good. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been as grumpy as a gander for weeks. How\r\nabout shirts? And you left one pair of flannel tennis pants out here\r\nlast fall\xe2\x80\x94clean ones. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you need . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn town he lived in a large front room and alcove on the third floor of\r\na handsome old-fashioned three-story-and-basement house in Deming Place.\r\nHe used the front room as a living room, the alcove as a bedroom. He and\r\nSelina had furnished it together, discarding all of the room\xe2\x80\x99s original\r\nbelongings except the bed, a table, and one fat comfortable faded old\r\narmchair whose brocade surface hinted a past grandeur. When he had got\r\nhis books ranged in open shelves along one wall, soft-shaded lamps on\r\ntable and desk, the place looked more than livable; lived in. During the\r\nprocess of furnishing Selina got into the way of coming into town for a\r\nday or two to prowl the auction rooms and the second-hand stores. She\r\nhad a genius for this sort of thing; hated the spick-and-span varnish\r\nand veneer of the new furniture to be got in the regular way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny piece of furniture, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how beautiful it is, has got to be\r\nlived with, and kicked about, and rubbed down, and mistreated by\r\nservants, and repolished, and knocked around and dusted and sat on or\r\nslept in or eaten off of before it develops its real character,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cA good deal like human beings. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have my old maple\r\ntable, mellow with age and rubbing, that Pervus\xe2\x80\x99s father put together\r\nhimself by hand seventy years ago, than all the mahogany library slabs\r\non Wabash Avenue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe enjoyed these rare trips into town; made a holiday of them. Dirk\r\nwould take her to the theatre and she would sit entranced. Her feeling\r\nfor this form of entertainment was as fresh and eager as it had been in\r\nthe days of the Daly Stock Company when she, a little girl, had been\r\nseated in the parquet with her father, Simeon Peake. Strangely enough,\r\nconsidering the lack of what the world calls romance and adventure in\r\nher life, she did not like the motion pictures. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the difference in\r\nthe world,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the movies and the thrill I get out\r\nof a play at the theatre. My, yes! Like fooling with paper dolls when\r\nyou could be playing with a real live baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe developed a mania for nosing into strange corners of the huge\r\nsprawling city; seemed to discover a fresh wonder on each visit. In a\r\nshort time she was more familiar with Chicago than was Dirk\xe2\x80\x94for that\r\nmatter, than old Aug Hempel who had lived in it for over half a century\r\nbut who never had gone far afield in his pendulum path between the yards\r\nand his house, his house and the yards.\r\n\r\nThe things that excited her about Chicago did not seem to interest Dirk\r\nat all. Sometimes she took a vacant room for a day or two in Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboarding house. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think!\xe2\x80\x9d she would say to him, breathlessly,\r\nwhen he returned from the office in the evening. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been way over on\r\nthe northwest side. It\xe2\x80\x99s another world. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s Poland. Cathedrals\r\nand shops and men sitting in restaurants all day long reading papers and\r\ndrinking coffee and playing dominoes or something like it. And what do\r\nyou think I found out! Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s got the second largest Polish\r\npopulation of any city in the world. In the _world_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh?\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk would reply, absently.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing absent-minded about his tone this afternoon as he\r\ntalked to his mother on the telephone. \xe2\x80\x9cSure you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind? Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe out next Saturday. Or I may run out in the middle of the week to stay\r\nover night . . . Are you all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fine. Be sure and remember all about Paula\xe2\x80\x99s new house so\xe2\x80\x99s you can\r\ntell me about it. Julie says it\xe2\x80\x99s like the kind you read of in the\r\nnovels. She says old Aug saw it just once and now won\xe2\x80\x99t go near it even\r\nto visit his grandchildren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day was marvellously mild for March in Chicago. Spring, usually so\r\ncoy in this region, had flung herself at them head first. As the massive\r\nrevolving door of Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s office building fanned him into the street he\r\nsaw Paula in her long low sporting roadster at the curb. She was dressed\r\nin black. All feminine fashionable and middle-class Chicago was dressed\r\nin black. All feminine fashionable and middle-class America was dressed\r\nin black. Two years of war had robbed Paris of its husbands, brothers,\r\nsons. All Paris walked in black. America, untouched, gayly borrowed the\r\nsmart habiliments of mourning and now Michigan Boulevard and Fifth\r\nAvenue walked demurely in the gloom of cr\xc3\xaape and chiffon; black hats,\r\nblack gloves, black slippers. Only black was \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d this year.\r\n\r\nPaula did not wear black well. She was a shade too sallow for these\r\nsombre swathings even though relieved by a pearl strand of exquisite\r\ncolour, flawlessly matched; and a new sly face-powder. Paula smiled up\r\nat him, patted the leather seat beside her with one hand that was\r\nabsurdly thick-fingered in its fur-lined glove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s cold driving. Button up tight. Where\xe2\x80\x99ll we stop for your bag? Are\r\nyou still in Deming Place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was still in Deming Place. He climbed into the seat beside her\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfeat for the young and nimble. Theodore Storm never tried to double his\r\nbulk into the jack-knife position necessary to riding in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroadster. The car was built for speed, not comfort. One sat flat with\r\nthe length of one\xe2\x80\x99s legs stretched out. Paula\xe2\x80\x99s feet, pedalling brake\r\nand clutch so expertly, were inadequately clothed in sheer black silk\r\nstockings and slim buckled patent-leather slippers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not dressed warmly enough,\xe2\x80\x9d her husband would have said. \xe2\x80\x9cThose\r\nshoes are idiotic for driving.\xe2\x80\x9d And he would have been right.\r\n\r\nDirk said nothing.\r\n\r\nHer manipulation of the wheel was witchcraft. The roadster slid in and\r\nout of traffic like a fluid thing, an enamel stream, silent as a swift\r\ncurrent in a river. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t let her out here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paula. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till we\r\nget past Lincoln Park. Do you suppose they\xe2\x80\x99ll ever really get rid of\r\nthis terrible Rush Street bridge?\xe2\x80\x9d When his house was reached, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ncoming up,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you haven\xe2\x80\x99t any tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh, no! What do you think I am! A young man in an English novel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t be provincial and Chicago-ish, Dirk.\xe2\x80\x9d They climbed the three\r\nflights of stairs. She looked about. Her glance was not disapproving.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad. Who did it? She did! Very nice. But of course you\r\nought to have your own smart little apartment, with a Jap to do you up.\r\nTo do that for you, for example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d grimly. He was packing his bag\xe2\x80\x94not throwing clothes into it, but\r\nfolding them deftly, neatly, as the son of a wise mother packs. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nsalary\xe2\x80\x99d just about keep him in white linen house-coats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was walking about the living room, picking up a book, putting it\r\ndown, fingering an ash tray, gazing out of the window, examining a\r\nphotograph, smoking a cigarette from the box on his table. Restless,\r\nnervously alive, catlike. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to send you some things for your\r\nroom, Dirk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo kinds of women in the world. I learned that at college. Those who\r\nsend men things for their rooms and those that don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very rude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou asked me. There! I\xe2\x80\x99m all set.\xe2\x80\x9d He snapped the lock of his bag. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsorry I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you anything. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a thing. Not even a glass of\r\nwine and a\xe2\x80\x94what is it they say in books?\xe2\x80\x94oh, yeh\xe2\x80\x94a biscuit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the roadster again they slid smoothly out along the drive, along\r\nSheridan Road, swung sharply around the cemetery curve into Evanston,\r\npast the smug middle-class suburban neatness of Wilmette and Winnetka.\r\nShe negotiated expertly the nerve-racking curves of the Hubbard Woods\r\nhills, then maintained a fierce and steady speed for the remainder of\r\nthe drive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe call the place Stormwood,\xe2\x80\x9d Paula told him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd nobody outside the\r\ndear family knows how fitting that is. Don\xe2\x80\x99t scowl. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to\r\ntell you my marital woes. And don\xe2\x80\x99t you say I asked for it. . . . How\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe job?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like it? The work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like it well enough, only\xe2\x80\x94well, you see we leave the university\r\narchitectural course thinking we\xe2\x80\x99re all going to be Stanford Whites or\r\nCass Gilberts, tossing off a Woolworth building and making ourselves\r\nfamous overnight. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent all yesterday and to-day planning how to\r\nwork in space for toilets on every floor of the new office building, six\r\nstories high and shaped like a drygoods box, that\xe2\x80\x99s going up on the\r\ncorner of Milwaukee Avenue and Ashland, west.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ten years from now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen years from now maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll let me do the plans for the drygoods\r\nbox all alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you drop it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was startled. \xe2\x80\x9cDrop it! How do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChuck it. Do something that will bring you quick results. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t an\r\nage of waiting. Suppose, twenty years from now, you do plan a grand\r\nGothic office building to grace this new and glorified Michigan\r\nBoulevard they\xe2\x80\x99re always shouting about! You\xe2\x80\x99ll be a middle-aged man\r\nliving in a middle-class house in a middle-class suburb with a\r\nmiddle-class wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94slightly nettled. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the Sir Christopher Wren\r\nof Chicago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, how often have you been in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext time you find yourself there you might cast your eye over a very\r\nnice little structure called St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Cathedral. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen it\r\nbut it has been very well spoken of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey turned in at the gates of Stormwood. Though the trees and bushes\r\nwere gaunt and bare the grass already showed stretches of vivid green.\r\nIn the fading light one caught glimpses through the shrubbery of the\r\nlake beyond. It was a dazzling sapphire blue in the sunset. A final turn\r\nof the drive. An avenue of trees. A house, massive, pillared, porticoed.\r\nThe door opened as they drew up at the entrance. A maid in cap and apron\r\nstood in the doorway. A man appeared at the side of the car, coming\r\nseemingly from nowhere, greeted Paula civilly and drove the car off. The\r\nglow of an open fire in the hall welcomed them. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll bring up your\r\nbag,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paula. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99re the babies, Anna? Has Mr. Storm got here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe telephoned, Mrs. Storm. He says he won\xe2\x80\x99t be out till late\xe2\x80\x94maybe ten\r\nor after. Anyway, you\xe2\x80\x99re not to wait dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaula, from being the limp, expert, fearless driver of the high-powered\r\nroadster was now suddenly very much the mistress of the house, quietly\r\nobservant, giving an order with a lift of the eyebrow or a nod of the\r\nhead. Would Dirk like to go to his room at once? Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99d like to\r\nlook at the babies before they went to sleep for the night, though the\r\nnurse would probably throw him out. One of those stern British females.\r\nDinner at seven-thirty. He needn\xe2\x80\x99t dress. Just as he liked. Everything\r\nwas very informal here. They roughed it. (Dirk had counted thirteen\r\nservants by noon next day and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been near the kitchen, laundry, or\r\ndairy.)\r\n\r\nHis room, when he reached it, he thought pretty awful. A great square\r\nchamber with narrow leaded windows, deep-set, on either side. From one\r\nhe could get a glimpse of the lake, but only a glimpse. Evidently the\r\nfamily bedrooms were the lake rooms. In the DeJong code and class the\r\nguest had the best but evidently among these moneyed ones the family had\r\nthe best and the guest was made comfortable, but was not pampered. It\r\nwas a new angle for Dirk. He thought it startling but rather sensible.\r\nHis bag had been brought up, unpacked, and stowed away in a closet\r\nbefore he reached his room. \xe2\x80\x9cHave to tell that to Selina,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought,\r\ngrinning. He looked about the room, critically. It was done in a style\r\nthat he vaguely defined as French. It gave him the feeling that he had\r\nstumbled accidentally into the chamber of a R\xc3\xa9camier and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nout. Rose brocade with gold net and cream lace and rosebuds. \xe2\x80\x9cSwell\r\nplace for a man,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and kicked a footstool\xe2\x80\x94a _fauteuil_ he\r\nsupposed it was called, and was secretly glad that he could pronounce it\r\nfaultlessly. Long mirrors, silken hanging, cream walls. The bed was lace\r\nhung. The coverlet was rose satin, feather-light. He explored his\r\nbathroom. It actually was a room, much larger than his alcove bedroom on\r\nDeming Place\xe2\x80\x94as large as his own bedroom at home on the farm. The bath\r\nwas done dazzlingly in blue and white. The tub was enormous and as solid\r\nas if the house had been built around it. There were towels and towels\r\nand towels in blue and white, ranging in size all the way from tiny\r\nembroidered wisps to fuzzy all-enveloping bath towels as big as a\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\nHe was much impressed.\r\n\r\nHe decided to bathe and change into dinner clothes and was glad of this\r\nwhen he found Paula in black chiffon before the fire in the great beamed\r\nroom she had called the library. Dirk thought she looked very beautiful\r\nin that diaphanous stuff, with the pearls. Her heart-shaped face, with\r\nits large eyes that slanted a little at the corners; her long slim\r\nthroat; her dark hair piled high and away from her little ears. He\r\ndecided not to mention it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look extremely dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paula.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dirk, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s hunger that brings this look of the\r\nbeast to my usually mild Dutch features. Also, why do you call this the\r\nlibrary?\xe2\x80\x9d Empty shelves gaped from the wall on all sides. The room was\r\nmeant to hold hundreds of volumes. Perhaps fifty or sixty in all now\r\nleaned limply against each other or lay supine.\r\n\r\nPaula laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey do look sort of sparse, don\xe2\x80\x99t they? Theodore bought\r\nthis place, you know, as is. We\xe2\x80\x99ve books enough in town, of course. But\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t read much out here. And Theodore!\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he ever in\r\nhis life read anything but detective stories and the newspapers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk told himself that Paula had known her husband would not be home\r\nuntil ten and had deliberately planned a t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate meal. He would not,\r\ntherefore, confess himself a little nettled when Paula said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve asked\r\nthe Emerys in for dinner; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a game of bridge afterward.\r\nPhil Emery, you know, the Third. He used to have it on his visiting\r\ncard, like royalty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Emerys were drygoods; had been drygoods for sixty years; were\r\naccounted Chicago aristocracy; preferred England; rode to hounds in pink\r\ncoats along Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s prim and startled suburban prairies. They had a\r\nvast estate on the lake near Stormwood. They arrived a trifle late. Dirk\r\nhad seen pictures of old Phillip Emery (\xe2\x80\x9cPhillip the First,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought,\r\nwith an inward grin) and decided, looking at the rather an\xc3\xa6mic third\r\nedition, that the stock was running a little thin. Mrs. Emery was\r\nblonde, statuesque, and unmagnetic. In contrast Paula seemed to glow\r\nlike a sombre jewel. The dinner was delicious but surprisingly simple;\r\nlittle more than Selina would have given him, Dirk thought, had he come\r\nhome to the farm this week-end. The talk was desultory and rather dull.\r\nAnd this chap had millions, Dirk said to himself. Millions. No\r\nscratching in an architect\xe2\x80\x99s office for this lad. Mrs. Emery was\r\ninterested in the correct pronunciation of Chicago street names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s terrible,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think there ought to be a Movement for the\r\nproper pronunciation. The people ought to be taught; and the children in\r\nthe schools. They call Goethe Street \xe2\x80\x98Gerty\xe2\x80\x99; and pronounce all the s\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin Des Plaines. Even Illinois they call \xe2\x80\x98Illi_noise_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d She was very\r\nmuch in earnest. Her breast rose and fell. She ate her salad rapidly.\r\nDirk thought that large blondes oughn\xe2\x80\x99t to get excited. It made their\r\nfaces red.\r\n\r\nAt bridge after dinner Phillip the Third proved to be sufficiently the\r\nson of his father to win from Dirk more money than he could conveniently\r\nafford to lose. Though Mrs. Phil had much to do with this, as Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npartner. Paula played with Emery, a bold shrewd game.\r\n\r\nTheodore Storm came in at ten and stood watching them. When the guests\r\nhad left the three sat before the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d Storm\r\nasked Dirk. Dirk refused but Storm mixed a stiff highball for himself,\r\nand then another. The whiskey brought no flush to his large white\r\nimpassive face. He talked almost not at all. Dirk, naturally silent, was\r\nloquacious by comparison. But while there was nothing heavy, unvital\r\nabout Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s silence this man\xe2\x80\x99s was oppressive, irritating. His paunch,\r\nhis large white hands, his great white face gave the effect of bleached\r\nbloodless bulk. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how she stands him,\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk thought. Husband\r\nand wife seemed to be on terms of polite friendliness. Storm excused\r\nhimself and took himself off with a word about being tired, and seeing\r\nthem in the morning.\r\n\r\nAfter he had gone: \xe2\x80\x9cHe likes you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paula.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImportant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk, \xe2\x80\x9cif true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is important. He can help you a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me how? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do. I want you to be successful. I want you to be. You can be.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got it written all over you. In the way you stand, and talk, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t talk. In the way you look at people. In something in the way you\r\ncarry yourself. It\xe2\x80\x99s what they call force, I suppose. Anyway, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas your husband got it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheodore! No! That is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the force, but he\xe2\x80\x99s got the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can have both.\xe2\x80\x9d She was leaning forward. Her eyes were bright,\r\nenormous. Her hands\xe2\x80\x94those thin dark hot hands\xe2\x80\x94were twisted in her lap.\r\nHe looked at her quietly. Suddenly there were tears in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook at me that way, Dirk.\xe2\x80\x9d She huddled back in her chair, limp. She\r\nlooked a little haggard and older, somehow. \xe2\x80\x9cMy marriage is a mess, of\r\ncourse. You can see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew it would be, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Yes. Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Anyway, what\xe2\x80\x99s the difference, now? I\xe2\x80\x99m not\r\ntrying to be what they call an Influence in your life. I\xe2\x80\x99m just fond of\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94you know that\xe2\x80\x94and I want you to be great and successful. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaternal, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think two babies would satisfy that urge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get excited about two pink healthy lumps of babies. I love\r\nthem and all that, but all they need is to have a bottle stuffed into\r\ntheir mouths at proper intervals and to be bathed, and dressed and aired\r\nand slept. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mechanical routine and about as exciting as a\r\ntreadmill. I can\xe2\x80\x99t go round being maternal and beating my breast over\r\ntwo nice firm lumps of flesh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what do you want me to do, Paula?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was eager again, vitally concerned in him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all so ridiculous.\r\nAll these men whose incomes are thirty\xe2\x80\x94forty\xe2\x80\x94sixty\xe2\x80\x94a hundred thousand\r\na year usually haven\xe2\x80\x99t any qualities, really, that the\r\nfive-thousand-a-year man hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. The doctor who sent Theodore a bill for\r\nfour thousand dollars when each of my babies was born didn\xe2\x80\x99t do a thing\r\nthat a country doctor with a Ford wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. But he knew he could get\r\nit and he asked it. Somebody has to get the fifty-thousand-dollar\r\nsalaries\xe2\x80\x94some advertising man, or bond salesman or\xe2\x80\x94why, look at Phil\r\nEmery! He probably couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell a yard of pink ribbon to a schoolgirl\r\nif he had to. Look at Theodore! He just sits and blinks and says\r\nnothing. But when the time comes he doubles up his fat white fist and\r\nmumbles, \xe2\x80\x98Ten million,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Fifteen million,\xe2\x80\x99 and that settles it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk laughed to hide his own little mounting sensation of excitement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as simple as that, I imagine. There\xe2\x80\x99s more to it than\r\nmeets the eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t! I tell you I know the whole crowd of them. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nbrought up with this moneyed pack all my life, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I? Pork packers\r\nand wheat grabbers and pedlers of gas and electric light and dry goods.\r\nGrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s the only one of the crowd that I respect. He has stayed\r\nthe same. They can\xe2\x80\x99t fool him. He knows he just happened to go into\r\nwholesale beef and pork when wholesale beef and pork was a new game in\r\nChicago. Now look at him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, you will admit there\xe2\x80\x99s something in knowing when,\xe2\x80\x9d he argued.\r\n\r\nPaula stood up. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t know I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. Now is when. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nGrandfather and Dad and Theodore to work with. You can go on being an\r\narchitect if you want to. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fine enough profession. But unless\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a genius where\xe2\x80\x99ll it get you! Go in with them, and Dirk, in five\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d They were both standing, facing each other, she tense, eager; he\r\nrelaxed but stimulated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry it and see what, will you? Will you, Dirk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Paula. I should say my mother wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think much of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she know! Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that she isn\xe2\x80\x99t a fine, wonderful\r\nperson. She is. I love her. But success! She thinks success is another\r\nacre of asparagus or cabbage; or a new stove in the kitchen now that\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve brought gas out as far as High Prairie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a feeling that she possessed him; that her hot eager hands held\r\nhim though they stood apart and eyed each other almost hostilely.\r\n\r\nAs he undressed that night in his rose and satin room he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s her game? What\xe2\x80\x99s she up to? Be careful, Dirk, old boy.\xe2\x80\x9d On coming\r\ninto the room he had gone immediately to the long mirror and had looked\r\nat himself carefully, searchingly, not knowing that Paula, in her room,\r\nhad done the same. He ran a hand over his close-shaved chin, looked at\r\nthe fit of his dinner coat. He wished he had had it made at Peter\r\nPeel\xe2\x80\x99s, the English tailor on Michigan Boulevard. But Peel was so damned\r\nexpensive. Perhaps next time . . .\r\n\r\nAs he lay in the soft bed with the satin coverlet over him he thought,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow what\xe2\x80\x99s her lit-tle game!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe awoke at eight, enormously hungry. He wondered, uneasily, just how he\r\nwas going to get his breakfast. She had said his breakfast would be\r\nbrought him in his room. He stretched luxuriously, sprang up, turned on\r\nhis bath water, bathed. When he emerged in dressing gown and slippers\r\nhis breakfast tray had been brought him mysteriously and its contents\r\nlay appetizingly on a little portable table. There were flocks of small\r\ncovered dishes and a charming individual coffee service. The morning\r\npapers, folded and virgin, lay next this. A little note from Paula:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to take a walk at about half-past nine? Stroll down to\r\nthe stables. I want to show you my new horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe distance from the house to the stables was actually quite a brisk\r\nlittle walk in itself. Paula, in riding clothes, was waiting for him.\r\nShe looked boyish and young standing beside the sturdy bulk of Pat, the\r\nhead stableman. She wore tan whipcord breeches, a coat of darker stuff,\r\na little round felt hat whose brim curved away from her face.\r\n\r\nShe greeted him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been out two hours. Had my ride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate people who tell you, first thing in the morning, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen out two hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of mood you\xe2\x80\x99re in we won\xe2\x80\x99t show him the horse, will\r\nwe, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPat thought they would. Pat showed him the new saddle mare as a mother\r\nexhibits her latest offspring, tenderly, proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at her back,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Pat. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way you tell a horse, sir. By the length of this\r\nhere line. Lookut it! There\xe2\x80\x99s a picture for you, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaula looked up at Dirk. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ride, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to ride the old nags, bareback, on the farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to learn. We\xe2\x80\x99ll teach him, won\xe2\x80\x99t we, Pat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPat surveyed Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s lean, flexible figure. \xe2\x80\x9cEasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, say!\xe2\x80\x9d protested Dirk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll have some one to ride with me. Theodore never rides. He never\r\ntakes any sort of exercise. Sits in that great fat car of his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went into the coach house, a great airy whitewashed place with\r\nglittering harness and spurs and bridles like jewels in glass cases.\r\nThere were ribbons, too, red and yellow and blue in a rack on the wall;\r\nand trophy cups. The coach house gave Dirk a little hopeless feeling. He\r\nhad never before seen anything like it. In the first place, there were\r\nno motors in it. He had forgotten that people rode in anything but\r\nmotors. A horse on Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s boulevards raised a laugh. The sight of a\r\nshining brougham with two sleek chestnuts driving down Michigan Avenue\r\nwould have set that street to staring and sniggering as a Roman chariot\r\ndrawn by zebras might have done. Yet here was such a brougham,\r\nglittering, spotless. Here was a smart cream surrey with a\r\ncream-coloured top hung with fringe. There were two-wheeled carts high\r\nand slim and chic. A victoria. Two pony carts. One would have thought,\r\nseeing this room, that the motor vehicle had never been invented. And\r\ntowering over all, dwarfing the rest, out-glittering them, stood a\r\ntally-ho, a sheer piece of wanton insolence. It was in perfect order.\r\nIts cushions were immaculate. Its sides shone. Its steps glistened.\r\nDirk, looking up at it, laughed outright. It seemed too splendid, too\r\nabsurd. With a sudden boyish impulse he swung himself up the three steps\r\nthat led to the box and perched himself on the fawn cushioned seat. He\r\nlooked very handsome there. \xe2\x80\x9cA coach and four\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what they call\r\nit? Got any Roman juggernauts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to drive it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Paula. \xe2\x80\x9cThis afternoon? Do you think\r\nyou can? Four horses, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed up at him, her dark face\r\nupturned to his.\r\n\r\nDirk looked down at her. \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d He climbed down. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose that at about\r\nthe time they drove this hereabouts my father was taking the farm plugs\r\ninto the Haymarket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething had annoyed him, she saw. Would he wait while she changed to\r\nwalking things? Or perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99d rather drive in the roadster. They\r\nwalked up to the house together. He wished that she would not consult\r\nhis wishes so anxiously. It made him sulky, impatient.\r\n\r\nShe put a hand on his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cDirk, are you annoyed at me for what I said\r\nlast night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you think when you went to your room last night? Tell me. What\r\ndid you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought: \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s bored with her husband and she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to vamp me.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be careful.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaula laughed delightedly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nice and frank . . . What else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought my coat didn\xe2\x80\x99t fit very well and I wished I could afford to\r\nhave Peel make my next one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, Dirk was spared the necessity of worrying about the\r\nfit of his next dinner coat for the following year and a half. His coat,\r\nduring that period, was a neat olive drab as was that of some millions\r\nof young men of his age, or thereabouts. He wore it very well, and with\r\nthe calm assurance of one who knows that his shoulders are broad, his\r\nwaist slim, his stomach flat, his flanks lean, and his legs straight.\r\nMost of that time he spent at Fort Sheridan, first as an officer in\r\ntraining, then as an officer training others to be officers. He was\r\nexcellent at this job. Influence put him there and kept him there even\r\nafter he began to chafe at the restraint. Fort Sheridan is a few miles\r\noutside Chicago, north. No smart North Shore dinner was considered\r\ncomplete without at least a major, a colonel, two captains, and a\r\nsprinkling of first lieutenants. Their boots shone so delightfully while\r\ndancing.\r\n\r\nIn the last six months of it (though he did not, of course, know that it\r\nwas to be the last six months) Dirk tried desperately to get to France.\r\nHe was suddenly sick of the neat job at home; of the dinners; of the\r\nsmug routine; of the olive-drab motor car that whisked him wherever he\r\nwanted to go (he had a captaincy); of making them \xe2\x80\x9csnap into it\xe2\x80\x9d; of\r\nPaula; of his mother, even. Two months before the war\xe2\x80\x99s close he\r\nsucceeded in getting over; but Paris was his headquarters.\r\n\r\nBetween Dirk and his mother the first rift had appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were a man,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d make up my mind straight about this\r\nwar and then I\xe2\x80\x99d do one of two things. I\xe2\x80\x99d go into it the way Jan Snip\r\ngoes at forking the manure pile\xe2\x80\x94a dirty job that\xe2\x80\x99s got to be cleaned\r\nup; or I\xe2\x80\x99d refuse to do it altogether if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in it as a job\r\nfor me. I\xe2\x80\x99d fight, or I\xe2\x80\x99d be a conscientious objector. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nin between for any one who isn\xe2\x80\x99t old or crippled, or sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaula was aghast when she heard this. So was Julie whose wailings had\r\nbeen loud when Eugene had gone into the air service. He was in France\r\nnow, thoroughly happy. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Paula, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you actually\r\nwant Dirk to go over there and be wounded or killed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. If Dirk were killed my life would stop. I\xe2\x80\x99d go on living, I\r\nsuppose, but my life would have stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all were doing some share in the work to be done.\r\n\r\nSelina had thought about her own place in this war welter. She had\r\nwanted to do canteen work in France but had decided against this as\r\nbeing selfish. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing for me to do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cis to go on raising\r\nvegetables and hogs as fast as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d She supplied countless households\r\nwith free food while their men were gone. She herself worked like a man,\r\ntaking the place of the able-bodied helper who had been employed on her\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nPaula was lovely in her Red Cross uniform. She persuaded Dirk to go into\r\nthe Liberty Bond selling drive and he was unexpectedly effective in his\r\nquiet, serious way; most convincing and undeniably thrilling to look at\r\nin uniform. Paula\xe2\x80\x99s little air of possession had grown until now it\r\nenveloped him. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t playing now; was deeply and terribly in love\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1918, Dirk took off his uniform he went into the bond\r\ndepartment of the Great Lakes Trust Company in which Theodore Storm had\r\na large interest. He said that the war had disillusioned him. It was a\r\nword you often heard uttered as a reason or an excuse for abandoning the\r\nnormal. \xe2\x80\x9cDisillusioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you think war was going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina. \xe2\x80\x9cPurify! It never\r\nhas yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was understood, by Selina at least, that Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s abandoning of his\r\nprofession was a temporary thing. Quick as she usually was to arrive at\r\nconclusions, she did not realize until too late that this son of hers\r\nhad definitely deserted building for bonds; that the only structures he\r\nwould rear were her own castles in Spain. His first two months as a bond\r\nsalesman netted him more than a year\xe2\x80\x99s salary at his old post at Hollis\r\n& Sprague\xe2\x80\x99s. When he told this to Selina, in triumph, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\nbut there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much fun in it, is there? This selling things on paper?\r\nNow architecture, that must be thrilling. Next to writing a play and\r\nseeing it acted by real people\xe2\x80\x94seeing it actually come alive before\r\nyour eyes\xe2\x80\x94architecture must be the next most fun. Putting a building\r\ndown on paper\xe2\x80\x94little marks here, straight lines there, figures,\r\ncalculations, blueprints, measurements\xe2\x80\x94and then, suddenly one day, the\r\nactual building itself. Steel and stone and brick, with engines\r\nthrobbing inside it like a heart, and people flowing in and out. Part of\r\na city. A piece of actual beauty conceived by you! Oh, Dirk!\xe2\x80\x9d To see her\r\nface then must have given him a pang, it was so alive, so eager.\r\n\r\nHe found excuses for himself. \xe2\x80\x9cSelling bonds that make that building\r\npossible isn\xe2\x80\x99t so dull, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she waved that aside almost contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense, Dirk.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s like selling seats at the box office of a theatre for the play\r\ninside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk had made many new friends in the last year and a half. More than\r\nthat, he had acquired a new manner; an air of quiet authority, of\r\nassurance. The profession of architecture was put definitely behind him.\r\nThere had been no building in all the months of the war; probably would\r\nbe none in years. Materials were prohibitive, labour exorbitant. He did\r\nnot say to Selina that he had put the other work from him. But after six\r\nmonths in his new position he knew that he would never go back.\r\n\r\nFrom the start he was a success. Within one year he was so successful\r\nthat you could hardly distinguish him from a hundred other successful\r\nyoung Chicago business and professional men whose clothes were made at\r\nPeel\xe2\x80\x99s; who kept their collars miraculously clean in the soot-laden\r\natmosphere of the Loop; whose shoes were bench-made; who lunched at the\r\nNoon Club on the roof of the First National Bank where Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmillionaires ate corned-beef hash whenever that plebeian dish appeared\r\non the bill of fare. He had had a little thrill out of his first meal at\r\nthis club whose membership was made up of the \xe2\x80\x9cbig men\xe2\x80\x9d of the city\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinancial circle. Now he could even feel a little flicker of contempt\r\nfor them. He had known old Aug Hempel, of course, for years, as well as\r\nMichael Arnold, and, later, Phillip Emery, Theodore Storm, and others.\r\nBut he had expected these men to be different.\r\n\r\nPaula had said, \xe2\x80\x9cTheodore, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take Dirk up to the Noon Club\r\nsome day? There are a lot of big men he ought to meet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk went in some trepidation. The great grilled elevator, as large as a\r\nroom, whisked them up to the roof of the fortress of gold. The club\r\nlounge furnished his first disappointment. It looked like a Pullman\r\nsmoker. The chairs were upholstered in black leather or red plush. The\r\nwoodwork was shiny red imitation mahogany. The carpet was green. There\r\nwere bright shining brass cuspidors in the hall near the cigar counter.\r\nThe food was well cooked. Man\xe2\x80\x99s food. Nine out of every ten of these men\r\npossessed millions. Whenever corned beef and cabbage appeared on the\r\nluncheon menu nine out of ten took it. These were not at all the\r\nAmerican Big Business Man of the comic papers and of fiction\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nyellow, nervous, dyspeptic creature who lunches off milk and pie. They\r\nwere divided into two definite types. The older men of between fifty and\r\nsixty were great high-coloured fellows of full habit. Many of them had\r\nhad a physician\xe2\x80\x99s warning of high blood pressure, hardening arteries,\r\noverworked heart, rebellious kidneys. So now they waxed cautious, taking\r\ntime over their substantial lunches, smoking and talking. Their faces\r\nwere impassive, their eyes shrewd, hard. Their talk was colloquial and\r\nfrequently illiterate. They often said \xe2\x80\x9cwas\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cwere.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWas you going\r\nto see Baldwin about that South American stuff or is he going to ship it\r\nthrough without?\xe2\x80\x9d Most of them had known little of play in their youth\r\nand now they played ponderously and a little sadly and yet eagerly as\r\ndoes one to whom the gift of leisure had come too late. On Saturday\r\nafternoon you saw them in imported heather green golf stockings and\r\nScotch tweed suits making for the links or the lake. They ruined their\r\npalates and livers with strong cigars, thinking cigarette smoking\r\nundignified and pipes common. \xe2\x80\x9cHave a cigar!\xe2\x80\x9d was their greeting, their\r\npassword, their open sesame. \xe2\x80\x9cHave a cigar.\xe2\x80\x9d Only a few were so rich, so\r\nassured as to smoke cheap light panatellas. Old Aug Hempel was one of\r\nthese. Dirk noticed that when he made one of his rare visits to the Noon\r\nClub his entrance was met with a little stir, a deference. He was\r\nnearing seventy-five now; was still straight, strong, zestful of life; a\r\nmagnificent old buccaneer among the pettier crew. His had been the\r\ndirect and brutal method\xe2\x80\x94swish! swash! and his enemies walked the\r\nplank. The younger men eyed him with a certain amusement and respect.\r\n\r\nThese younger men whose ages ranged from twenty-eight to forty-five were\r\ndisciples of the new system in business. They were graduates of\r\nuniversities. They had known luxury all their lives. They were the\r\nsecond or third generation. They used the word \xe2\x80\x9cpsychology.\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\npractised restraint. They knew the power of suggestion. Where old Aug\r\nHempel had flown the black flag they resorted to the periscope. Dirk\r\nlearned that these men did not talk business during meal time except\r\nwhen they had met definitely for that purpose. They wasted a good deal\r\nof time, Dirk thought, and often, when they were supposed to be \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\nconference\xe2\x80\x9d or when their secretaries said primly that they were very\r\nbusy and not to be disturbed until three, they were dozing off for a\r\ncomfortable half hour in their private offices. They were the sons or\r\ngrandsons of those bearded, rugged, and rather terrible old boys who, in\r\n1835 or 1840, had come out of County Limerick or County Kilkenny or out\r\nof Scotland or the Rhineland to mold this new country in their strong\r\nhairy hands; those hands whose work had made possible the symphony\r\norchestras, the yacht clubs, the golf clubs through which their\r\ndescendants now found amusement and relaxation.\r\n\r\nDirk listened to the talk of the Noon Club.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made it in eighty-six. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad for the Tippecanoe course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c. . . boxes are going pretty well but the Metropolitan grabs up all the\r\nbig ones and the house wants names. Garden doesn\xe2\x80\x99t draw the way she used\r\nto, even in Chicago. It\xe2\x80\x99s the popular subscription that counts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c. . . grabbed the Century out of New York at two-forty-five and got\r\nback here in time to try out my new horse in the park. She\xe2\x80\x99s a little\r\nnervous for city riding but we\xe2\x80\x99re opening the house at Lake Forest next\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c. . . pretty good show but they don\xe2\x80\x99t send the original companies here,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c. . . in London. It\xe2\x80\x99s a neat shade of green, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? You can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nties like this over here, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. Got a dozen last time I was\r\nover. Yeh, Plumbridge in Bond Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, Dirk could talk like that easily enough. He listened quietly,\r\nnodded, smiled, agreed or disagreed. He looked about him carefully,\r\nappraisingly. Waist lines well kept in; carefully tailored clothes;\r\nshrewd wrinkles of experience radiating in fine sprays in the skin\r\naround the corners of their eyes. The president of an advertising firm\r\nlunching with a banker; a bond salesman talking to a rare book\r\ncollector; a packer seated at a small table with Horatio Craft, the\r\nsculptor.\r\n\r\nTwo years and Dirk, too, had learned to \xe2\x80\x9cgrab the Century\xe2\x80\x9d in order to\r\nsave an hour or so of time between Chicago and New York. Peel said it\r\nwas a pleasure to fit a coat to his broad, flat tapering back, and\r\ntrousers to his strong sturdy legs. His colour, inherited from his\r\nred-cheeked Dutch ancestors brought up in the fresh sea-laden air of the\r\nHolland flats, was fine and clear. Sometimes Selina, in pure sensuous\r\ndelight, passed her gnarled, work-worn hand over his shoulders and down\r\nhis fine, strong, straight back. He had been abroad twice. He learned to\r\ncall it \xe2\x80\x9crunning over to Europe for a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d It had all come about\r\nin a scant two years, as is the theatrical way in which life speeds in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nSelina was a little bewildered now at this new Dirk whose life was so\r\nfull without her. Sometimes she did not see him for two weeks, or three.\r\nHe sent her gifts which she smoothed and touched delightedly and put\r\naway; fine soft silken things, hand-made\xe2\x80\x94which she could not wear. The\r\nhabit of years was too strong upon her. Though she had always been a\r\nwoman of dainty habits and fastidious tastes the grind of her early\r\nmarried life had left its indelible mark. Now, as she dressed, you might\r\nhave seen that her petticoat was likely to be black sateen and her\r\nplain, durable corset cover neatly patched where it had worn under the\r\narms. She employed none of the artifices of a youth-mad day. Sun and\r\nwind and rain and the cold and heat of the open prairie had wreaked\r\ntheir vengeance on her flouting of them. Her skin was tanned,\r\nweather-beaten; her hair rough and dry. Her eyes, in that frame,\r\nstartled you by their unexpectedness, they were so calm, so serene, yet\r\nso alive. They were the beautiful eyes of a wise young girl in the face\r\nof a middle-aged woman. Life was still so fresh to her.\r\n\r\nShe had almost poignantly few personal belongings. Her bureau drawers\r\nwere like a nun\xe2\x80\x99s; her brush and comb, a scant stock of plain white\r\nunderwear. On the bathroom shelf her toothbrush, some vaseline, a box of\r\ntalcum powder. None of those aids to artifice with which the elderly\r\nwoman deludes herself into thinking that she is hoodwinking the world.\r\nShe wore well-made walking oxfords now, with sensible heels\xe2\x80\x94the kind\r\nknown as Field\xe2\x80\x99s special; plain shirtwaists and neat dark suits, or a\r\nblue cloth dress. A middle-aged woman approaching elderliness; a woman\r\nwho walked and carried herself well; who looked at you with a glance\r\nthat was direct but never hard. That was all. Yet there was about her\r\nsomething arresting, something compelling. You felt it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you do it!\xe2\x80\x9d Julie Arnold complained one day as Selina\r\nwas paying her one of her rare visits in town. \xe2\x80\x9cYour eyes are as bright\r\nas a baby\xe2\x80\x99s and mine look like dead oysters.\xe2\x80\x9d They were up in Julie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressing room in the new house on the north side\xe2\x80\x94the new house that was\r\nnow the old house. Julie\xe2\x80\x99s dressing table was a bewildering thing.\r\nSelina DeJong, in her neat black suit and her plain black hat, sat\r\nregarding it and Julie seated before it, with a grim and lively\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina said, \xe2\x80\x9clike Mandel\xe2\x80\x99s toilette section, or a hospital\r\noperating room just before a major operation.\xe2\x80\x9d There were great glass\r\njars that contained meal, white and gold. There were rows and rows of\r\ncream pots holding massage cream, vanishing cream, cleansing cream.\r\nThere were little china bowls of scarlet and white and yellowish pastes.\r\nA perforated container spouted a wisp of cotton. You saw toilet waters,\r\nperfumes, atomizers, French soaps, unguents, tubes. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a dressing\r\ntable merely, but a laboratory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Julie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to see Paula\xe2\x80\x99s. Compared to her\r\ntoilette ceremony mine is just a splash at the kitchen sink.\xe2\x80\x9d She rubbed\r\ncold cream now around her eyes with her two forefingers, using a\r\npractised upward stroke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks fascinating,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cSome day I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try it.\r\nThere are so many things I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try some day. So many things I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever done that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do for the fun of it. Think of it, Julie!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a manicure! Some day I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have one. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the\r\ngirl to paint my nails a beautiful bright vermilion. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tip her\r\ntwenty-five cents. They\xe2\x80\x99re so pretty with their bobbed hair and their\r\nqueer bright eyes. I s\xe2\x80\x99pose you\xe2\x80\x99ll think I\xe2\x80\x99m crazy if I tell you they\r\nmake me feel young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulie was massaging. Her eyes had an absent look. Suddenly: \xe2\x80\x9cListen,\r\nSelina. Dirk and Paula are together too much. People are talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalking?\xe2\x80\x9d The smile faded from Selina\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness knows I\xe2\x80\x99m not strait-laced. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be in this day and age.\r\nIf I had ever thought I\xe2\x80\x99d live to see the time when\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Well, since the\r\nwar of course anything\xe2\x80\x99s all right, seems. But Paula has no sense.\r\nEverybody knows she\xe2\x80\x99s insane about Dirk. That\xe2\x80\x99s all right for Dirk, but\r\nhow about Paula! She won\xe2\x80\x99t go anywhere unless he\xe2\x80\x99s invited. Of course\r\nDirk is awfully popular. Goodness knows there are few enough young men\r\nlike him in Chicago\xe2\x80\x94handsome and successful and polished and all. Most\r\nof them dash off East just as soon as they can get their fathers to\r\nestablish an Eastern branch or something. . . . They\xe2\x80\x99re together all the\r\ntime, everywhere. I asked her if she was going to divorce Storm and she\r\nsaid no, she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t enough money of her own and Dirk wasn\xe2\x80\x99t earning\r\nenough. His salary\xe2\x80\x99s thousands, but she\xe2\x80\x99s used to millions. Well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were boy and girl together,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina interrupted, feebly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not any more. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly, Selina. You\xe2\x80\x99re not as young as\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, she was not as young as that. When Dirk next paid one of his rare\r\nvisits to the farm she called him into her bedroom\xe2\x80\x94the cool, dim shabby\r\nbedroom with the old black walnut bed in which she had lain as Pervus\r\nDeJong\xe2\x80\x99s bride more than thirty years ago. She had on a little knitted\r\njacket over her severe white nightgown. Her abundant hair was neatly\r\nbraided in two long plaits. She looked somehow girlish there in the dim\r\nlight, her great soft eyes gazing up at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirk, sit down here at the side of my bed the way you used to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m dead tired, Mother. Twenty-seven holes of golf before I came out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. You ache all over\xe2\x80\x94a nice kind of ache. I used to feel like\r\nthat when I\xe2\x80\x99d worked in the fields all day, pulling vegetables, or\r\nplanting.\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent. She caught his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that. My\r\nsaying that. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it to make you feel bad, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you didn\xe2\x80\x99t, Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirk, do you know what that woman who writes the society news in the\r\nSunday _Tribune_ called you to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. What? I never read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said you were one of the _jeunesse dor\xc3\xa9e_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk grinned. \xe2\x80\x9cGosh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember enough of my French at Miss Fister\xe2\x80\x99s school to know that\r\nthat means gilded youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe! That\xe2\x80\x99s good! I\xe2\x80\x99m not even spangled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirk!\xe2\x80\x9d her voice was low, vibrant. \xe2\x80\x9cDirk, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be a\r\ngilded youth, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how thick the gilding. Dirk, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t what\r\nI worked in the sun and cold for. I\xe2\x80\x99m not reproaching you; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nthe work. Forgive me for even mentioning it. But, Dirk, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want my\r\nson to be known as one of the _jeunesse dor\xc3\xa9e_. No! Not my son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, listen, Mother. That\xe2\x80\x99s foolish. If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk like that.\r\nLike a mother in a melodrama whose son\xe2\x80\x99s gone wrong. . . . I work like a\r\ndog. You know that. You get the wrong angle on things, stuck out here on\r\nthis little farm. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come into town and take a little place\r\nand sell the farm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLive with you, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d Pure mischievousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like that,\xe2\x80\x9d hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, I\xe2\x80\x99d never be there.\r\nAt the office all day, and out somewhere in the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you do your reading, Dirk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94uh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat up in bed, looking down at the thin end of her braid as she\r\ntwined it round and round her finger. \xe2\x80\x9cDirk, what is this you sell in\r\nthat mahogany office of yours? I never did get the hang of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBonds, Mother. You know that perfectly well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBonds.\xe2\x80\x9d She considered this a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cAre they hard to sell? Who buys\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends. Everybody buys them\xe2\x80\x94that is . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t. I suppose because whenever I had any money it went back into\r\nthe farm for implements, or repairs, or seed, or stock, or improvements.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s always the way with a farmer\xe2\x80\x94even on a little truck farm like\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d She pondered again a moment. He fidgeted, yawned. \xe2\x80\x9cDirk\r\nDeJong\xe2\x80\x94Bond Salesman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way you say it, Mother, it sounds like a low criminal pursuit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirk, do you know sometimes I actually think that if you had stayed\r\nhere on the farm\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, Mother! What for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Time to dream. Time to\xe2\x80\x94no, I suppose that isn\xe2\x80\x99t true\r\nany more. I suppose the day is past when the genius came from the farm.\r\nMachinery has cut into his dreams. He used to sit for hours on the wagon\r\nseat, the reins slack in his hands, while the horses plodded into town.\r\nNow he whizzes by in a jitney. Patent binders, ploughs, reapers\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmechanic. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t time to dream. I guess if Lincoln had lived to-day\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d have split his rails to the tune of a humming, snarling patent wood\r\ncutter, and in the evening he\xe2\x80\x99d have whirled into town to get his books\r\nat the public library, and he\xe2\x80\x99d have read them under the glare of the\r\nelectric light bulb instead of lying flat in front of the flickering\r\nwood fire. . . . Well. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lay back, looked up at him. \xe2\x80\x9cDirk, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you marry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no one I want to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one who\xe2\x80\x99s free, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood up. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean no one.\xe2\x80\x9d He stooped and kissed her lightly. Her\r\narms went round him close. Her hand with the thick gold wedding band on\r\nit pressed his head to her hard. \xe2\x80\x9cSobig!\xe2\x80\x9d He was a baby again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t called me that in years.\xe2\x80\x9d He was laughing.\r\n\r\nShe reverted to the old game they had played when he was a child. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nbig is my son! How big?\xe2\x80\x9d She was smiling, but her eyes were sombre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo big!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dirk, and measured a very tiny space between thumb\r\nand forefinger. \xe2\x80\x9cSo big.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe faced him, sitting up very straight in bed, the little wool shawl\r\nhunched about her shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cDirk, are you ever going back to\r\narchitecture? The war is history. It\xe2\x80\x99s now or never with you. Pretty\r\nsoon it will be too late. Are you ever going back to architecture? To\r\nyour profession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA clean amputation. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave an actual gasp, as though icy water had been thrown full in her\r\nface. She looked suddenly old, tired. Her shoulders sagged. He stood in\r\nthe doorway, braced for her reproaches. But when she spoke it was to\r\nreproach herself. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99m a failure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what nonsense, Mother. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy. You can\xe2\x80\x99t live somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife. You used to tell me, when I was a kid I remember, that life wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\njust an adventure, to be taken as it came, with the hope that something\r\nglorious was always hidden just around the corner. You said you had\r\nlived that way and it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t worked. You said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him with a little cry. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I did. I know I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSuddenly she raised a warning finger. Her eyes were luminous, prophetic.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirk, you can\xe2\x80\x99t desert her like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDesert who?\xe2\x80\x9d He was startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeauty! Self-expression. Whatever you want to call it. You wait! She\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nturn on you some day. Some day you\xe2\x80\x99ll want her, and she won\xe2\x80\x99t be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInwardly he had been resentful of this bedside conversation with his\r\nmother. She made little of him, he thought, while outsiders appreciated\r\nhis success. He had said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo big,\xe2\x80\x9d measuring a tiny space between thumb\r\nand forefinger in answer to her half-playful question, but he had not\r\nhonestly meant it. He thought her ridiculously old-fashioned now in her\r\nviewpoint, and certainly unreasonable. But he would not quarrel with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wait, too, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said now, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cSome day your wayward\r\nson will be a real success. Wait till the millions roll in. Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lay down, turned her back deliberately upon him, pulled the covers\r\nup about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I turn out your light, Mother, and open the windows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeena\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. She always does. Just call her. . . . Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knew that he had come to be a rather big man in his world. Influence\r\nhad helped. He knew that, too. But he shut his mind to much of Paula\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nman\xc5\x93uvring and wire pulling\xe2\x80\x94refused to acknowledge that her lean, dark,\r\neager fingers had manipulated the mechanism that ordered his career.\r\nPaula herself was wise enough to know that to hold him she must not let\r\nhim feel indebted to her. She knew that the debtor hates his creditor.\r\nShe lay awake at night planning for him, scheming for his advancement,\r\nthen suggested these schemes to him so deftly as to make him think he\r\nhimself had devised them. She had even realized of late that their\r\ngrowing intimacy might handicap him if openly commented on. But now she\r\nmust see him daily, or speak to him. In the huge house on Lake Shore\r\nDrive her own rooms\xe2\x80\x94sitting room, bedroom, dressing room, bath\xe2\x80\x94were as\r\ndetached as though she occupied a separate apartment. Her telephone was\r\na private wire leading only to her own bedroom. She called him the first\r\nthing in the morning; the last thing at night. Her voice, when she spoke\r\nto him, was an organ transformed; low, vibrant, with a timbre in its\r\ntone that would have made it unrecognizable to an outsider. Her words\r\nwere commonplace enough, but pregnant and meaningful for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do to-day? Did you have a good day? . . . Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ncall me? . . . Did you follow up that suggestion you made about Kennedy?\r\nI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful idea, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? You\xe2\x80\x99re a wonderful man, Dirk;\r\ndid you know that? . . . I miss you. . . . Do you? . . . When? . . . Why\r\nnot lunch? . . . Oh, not if you have a business appointment . . . How\r\nabout five o\xe2\x80\x99clock? . . . No, not there . . . Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\npublic . . . Yes . . . Good-bye. . . . Good-night. . . .\r\nGood-night. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey began to meet rather furtively, in out-of-the-way places. They\r\nwould lunch in department store restaurants where none of their friends\r\never came. They spent off afternoon hours in the dim, close atmosphere\r\nof the motion picture palaces, sitting in the back row, seeing nothing\r\nof the film, talking in eager whispers that failed to annoy the\r\nscattered devotees in the middle of the house. When they drove it was on\r\nobscure streets of the south side, as secure there from observation as\r\nthough they had been in Africa, for to the north sider the south side of\r\nChicago is the hinterland of civilization.\r\n\r\nPaula had grown very beautiful, her world thought. There was about her\r\nthe aura, the glow, the roseate exhalation that surrounds the woman in\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nFrequently she irritated Dirk. At such times he grew quieter than ever;\r\nmore reserved. As he involuntarily withdrew she advanced. Sometimes he\r\nthought he hated her\xe2\x80\x94her hot eager hands, her glowing asking eyes, her\r\nthin red mouth, her sallow heart-shaped exquisite face, her perfumed\r\nclothing, her air of ownership. That was it! Her possessiveness. She\r\nclutched him so with her every look and gesture, even when she did not\r\ntouch him. There was about her something avid, sultry. It was like the\r\nhot wind that sometimes blew over the prairie\xe2\x80\x94blowing, blowing, but\r\nnever refreshing. It made you feel dry, arid, irritated, parched.\r\nSometimes Dirk wondered what Theodore Storm thought and knew behind that\r\nimpassive flabby white mask of his.\r\n\r\nDirk met plenty of other girls. Paula was clever enough to see to that.\r\nShe asked them to share her box at the opera. She had them at her\r\ndinners. She affected great indifference to their effect on him. She\r\nsuffered when he talked to one of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirk, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take out that nice Farnham girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she nice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she! You were talking to her long enough at the Kirks\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndance. What were you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBooks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh. Books. She\xe2\x80\x99s awfully nice and intelligent, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she? A lovely\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d She was suddenly happy. Books.\r\n\r\nThe Farnham girl was a nice girl. She was the kind of girl one should\r\nfall in love with and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. The Farnham girl was one of many\r\nwell-bred Chicago girls of her day and class. Fine, honest,\r\nclear-headed, frank, capable, good-looking in an indefinite and\r\nunarresting sort of way. Hair-coloured hair, good teeth, good enough\r\neyes, clear skin, sensible medium hands and feet; skated well, danced\r\nwell, talked well. Read the books you had read. A companionable girl.\r\nLoads of money but never spoke of it. Travelled. Her hand met yours\r\nfirmly\xe2\x80\x94and it was just a hand. At the contact no current darted through\r\nyou, sending its shaft with a little zing to your heart.\r\n\r\nBut when Paula showed you a book her arm, as she stood next you, would\r\nsomehow fit into the curve of yours and you were conscious of the feel\r\nof her soft slim side against you.\r\n\r\nHe knew many girls. There was a distinct type known as the North Shore\r\nGirl. Slim, tall, exquisite; a little fine nose, a high, sweet, slightly\r\nnasal voice, earrings, a cigarette, luncheon at Huyler\xe2\x80\x99s. All these\r\ngirls looked amazingly alike, Dirk thought; talked very much alike. They\r\nall spoke French with a pretty good accent; danced intricate symbolic\r\ndances; read the new books; had the same patter. They prefaced,\r\ninterlarded, concluded their remarks to each other with, \xe2\x80\x9cMy deah!\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\nexpressed, for them, surprise, sympathy, amusement, ridicule, horror,\r\nresignation. \xe2\x80\x9cMy _deah_! You should have seen her! My\r\n_dee-ah_!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94horror. Their slang was almost identical with that used by\r\nthe girls working in his office. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a good kid,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, speaking\r\nin admiration of another girl. They made a fetish of frankness. In a day\r\nwhen everyone talked in screaming headlines they knew it was necessary\r\nto red-ink their remarks in order to get them noticed at all. The word\r\nrot was replaced by garbage and garbage gave way to the ultimate swill.\r\nOne no longer said \xe2\x80\x9cHow shocking!\xe2\x80\x9d but, \xe2\x80\x9cHow perfectly obscene!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nwords, spoken in their sweet clear voices, fell nonchalantly from their\r\npretty lips. All very fearless and uninhibited and free. That, they told\r\nyou, was the main thing. Sometimes Dirk wished they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work so\r\nhard at their play. They were forever getting up pageants and plays and\r\nlarge festivals for charity; Venetian f\xc3\xaates, Oriental bazaars, charity\r\nballs. In the programme performance of these many of them sang better,\r\nacted better, danced better than most professional performers, but the\r\nwhole thing always lacked the flavour, somehow, of professional\r\nperformance. On these affairs they lavished thousands in costumes and\r\ndecorations, receiving in return other thousands which they soberly\r\nturned over to the Cause. They found nothing ludicrous in this.\r\nSpasmodically they went into business or semi-professional ventures,\r\ndefying the conventions. Paula did this, too. She or one of her friends\r\nwere forever opening blouse shops; starting Gifte Shoppes; burgeoning\r\ninto tea rooms decorated in crude green and vermilion and orange and\r\nblack; announcing their affiliation with an advertising agency. These\r\nadventures blossomed, withered, died. They were the result of post-war\r\nrestlessness. Many of these girls had worked indefatigably during the\r\n1917-1918 period; had driven service cars, managed ambulances, nursed,\r\nscrubbed, conducted canteens. They missed the excitement, the\r\nsatisfaction of achievement.\r\n\r\nThey found Dirk fair game, resented Paula\xe2\x80\x99s proprietorship. Susans and\r\nJanes and Kates and Bettys and Sallys\xe2\x80\x94plain old-fashioned names for\r\nmodern, erotic misses\xe2\x80\x94they talked to Dirk, danced with him, rode with\r\nhim, flirted with him. His very unattainableness gave him piquancy. That\r\nPaula Storm had him fast. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t care a hoot about girls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. DeJong,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cyour name\xe2\x80\x99s Dirk, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? What a slick\r\nname! What does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, I suppose. It\xe2\x80\x99s a Dutch name. My people\xe2\x80\x94my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94were Dutch, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dirk\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of sword, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, or poniard? Anyway, it sounds very\r\nkeen and cruel and fatal\xe2\x80\x94Dirk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would flush a little (one of his assets) and smile, and look at them,\r\nand say nothing. He found that to be all that was necessary.\r\n\r\nHe got on enormously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween these girls and the girls that worked in his office there\r\nexisted a similarity that struck and amused Dirk. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cTake a\r\nletter, Miss Roach,\xe2\x80\x9d to a slim young creature as exquisite as the girl\r\nwith whom he had danced the day before; or ridden or played tennis or\r\nbridge. Their very clothes were faultless imitations. They even used the\r\nsame perfume. He wondered, idly, how they did it. They were eighteen,\r\nnineteen, twenty, and their faces and bodies and desires and natural\r\nequipment made their presence in a business office a paradox, an\r\nabsurdity. Yet they were capable, too, in a mechanical sort of way.\r\nTheirs were mechanical jobs. They answered telephones, pressed levers,\r\nclicked buttons, tapped typewriters, jotted down names. They were lovely\r\ncreatures with the minds of fourteen-year-old children. Their hair was\r\nshining, perfectly undulated, as fine and glossy and tenderly curling as\r\na young child\xe2\x80\x99s. Their breasts were flat, their figures singularly\r\nsexless like that of a very young boy. They were wise with the wisdom of\r\nthe serpent. They wore wonderful little sweaters and flat babyish\r\ncollars and ridiculously sensible stockings and oxfords. Their legs were\r\nslim and sturdy. Their mouths were pouting, soft, pink, the lower lip a\r\nlittle curled back, petal-wise, like the moist mouth of a baby that has\r\njust finished nursing. Their eyes were wide apart, empty, knowledgeous.\r\nThey managed their private affairs like generals. They were cool,\r\nremote, disdainful. They reduced their boys to desperation. They were\r\nbrigands, desperadoes, pirates, taking all, giving little. They came,\r\nfor the most part, from sordid homes, yet they knew, in some miraculous\r\nway, all the fine arts that Paula knew and practised. They were\r\ncorsetless, pliant, bewildering, lovely, dangerous. They ate lunches\r\nthat were horrible mixtures of cloying sweets and biting acids yet their\r\nskin was like velvet and cream. Their voices were thin, nasal, vulgar;\r\ntheir faces like those in a Greuze or a Fragonard. They said, with a\r\ntwang that racked the listener, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t of went if I got an invite\r\nbut he could of give me a ring, anyways. I called him right. I was\r\nsore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeh? Wha\xe2\x80\x99d he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he laffed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidja go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe! No! Whatcha think I yam, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a good kid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmong these Dirk worked immune, aloof, untouched. He would have been\r\nsurprised to learn that he was known among them as Frosty. They approved\r\nhis socks, his scarfs, his nails, his features, his legs in their\r\nwell-fitting pants, his flat strong back in the Peel coat. They admired\r\nand resented him. Not one that did not secretly dream of the day when he\r\nwould call her into his office, shut the door, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cLoretta\xe2\x80\x9d (their\r\nnames were burbankian monstrosities, born of grafting the original\r\nappellation onto their own idea of beauty in nomenclature\xe2\x80\x94hence\r\nLoretta, Imogene, Nadine, Natalie, Ardella), \xe2\x80\x9cLoretta, I have watched\r\nyou for a long, long time and you must have noticed how deeply I admire\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t impossible. Those things happen. The movies had taught them\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nDirk, all unconscious of their pitiless, all-absorbing scrutiny, would\r\nhave been still further appalled to learn how fully aware they were of\r\nhis personal and private affairs. They knew about Paula, for example.\r\nThey admired and resented her, too. They were fair in granting her the\r\nperfection of her clothes, drew immense satisfaction from the knowledge\r\nof their own superiority in the matters of youth and colouring; despised\r\nher for the way in which she openly displayed her feeling for him (how\r\nthey knew this was a miracle and a mystery, for she almost never came\r\ninto the office and disguised all her telephone talks with him). They\r\nthought he was grand to his mother. Selina had been in his office twice,\r\nperhaps. On one of these occasions she had spent five minutes chatting\r\nsociably with Ethelinda Quinn who had the face of a Da Vinci cherub and\r\nthe soul of a man-eating shark. Selina always talked to everyone. She\r\nenjoyed listening to street car conductors, washwomen, janitors,\r\nlandladies, clerks, doormen, chauffeurs, policemen. Something about her\r\nmade them talk. They opened to her as flowers to the sun. They sensed\r\nher interest, her liking. As they talked Selina would exclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say! Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyes would be bright with\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nSelina had said, on entering Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s office, \xe2\x80\x9cMy land! I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how\r\nyou can work among those pretty creatures and not be a sultan. I\xe2\x80\x99m going\r\nto ask some of them down to the farm over Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Mother! They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I scarcely see them. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\njust part of the office equipment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfterward, Ethelinda Quinn had passed expert opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cSay, she\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nten times the guts that Frosty\xe2\x80\x99s got. I like her fine. Did you see her\r\nterrible hat! But say, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look funny on her, did it? Anybody else\r\nin that getup would look comical, but she\xe2\x80\x99s the kind that could walk off\r\nwith anything. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She\xe2\x80\x99s got what I call an air. It beats\r\nstyle. Nice, too. She said I was a pretty little thing. Can you beat it!\r\nAt that she\xe2\x80\x99s right. I cer\xe2\x80\x99nly yam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll unconscious, \xe2\x80\x9cTake a letter, Miss Quinn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk half an hour\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nIn the midst, then, of this fiery furnace of femininity Dirk walked\r\nunscorched. Paula, the North Shore girls, well-bred business and\r\nprofessional women he occasionally met in the course of business, the\r\nenticing little nymphs he encountered in his own office, all practised\r\non him their warm and perfumed wiles. He moved among them cool and\r\nserene. Perhaps his sudden success had had something to do with this;\r\nand his quiet ambition for further success. For he really was accounted\r\nsuccessful now, even in the spectacular whirl of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s meteoric\r\nfinancial constellation. North-side mammas regarded his income, his\r\ncareer, and his future with eyes of respect and wily speculation. There\r\nwas always a neat little pile of invitations in the mail that lay on the\r\ncorrect little console in the correct little apartment ministered by the\r\ncorrect little Jap on the correct north-side street near (but not too\r\nnear) the lake, and overlooking it.\r\n\r\nThe apartment had been furnished with Paula\xe2\x80\x99s aid. Together she and Dirk\r\nhad gone to interior decorators. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to use your own taste,\r\ntoo,\xe2\x80\x9d Paula had said, \xe2\x80\x9cto give it the individual touch.\xe2\x80\x9d The apartment\r\nwas furnished in a good deal of Italian furniture, the finish a dark oak\r\nor walnut, the whole massive and yet somehow unconvincing. The effect\r\nwas sombre without being impressive. There were long carved tables on\r\nwhich an ash tray seemed a desecration; great chairs roomy enough for\r\nlolling, yet in which you did not relax; dull silver candlesticks;\r\nvestments; Dante\xe2\x80\x99s saturnine features sneering down upon you from a\r\ncorrect cabinet. There were not many books. Tiny foyer, large living\r\nroom, bedroom, dining room, kitchen, and a cubby-hole for the Jap. Dirk\r\ndid not spend much time in the place. Sometimes he did not sit in a\r\nchair in the sitting room for days at a time, using the room only as a\r\nshort cut in his rush for the bedroom to change from office to dinner\r\nclothes. His upward climb was a treadmill, really. His office, the\r\napartment, a dinner, a dance. His contacts were monotonous, and too few.\r\nHis office was a great splendid office in a great splendid office\r\nbuilding in LaSalle Street. He drove back and forth in a motor car along\r\nthe boulevards. His social engagements lay north. LaSalle Street bounded\r\nhim on the west, Lake Michigan on the east, Jackson Boulevard on the\r\nsouth, Lake Forest on the north. He might have lived a thousand miles\r\naway for all he knew of the rest of Chicago\xe2\x80\x94the mighty, roaring,\r\nsweltering, pushing, screaming, magnificent hideous steel giant that was\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nSelina had had no hand in the furnishing of his apartment. When it was\r\nfinished Dirk had brought her in triumph to see it. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think of it, Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had stood in the centre of the room, a small plain figure in the\r\nmidst of these massive sombre carved tables, chairs, chests. A little\r\nsmile had quirked the corner of her mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s as cosy as a\r\ncathedral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes Selina remonstrated with him, though of late she had taken on\r\na strange reticence. She no longer asked him about the furnishings of\r\nthe houses he visited (Italian villas on Ohio Street), or the exotic\r\nfood he ate at splendid dinners. The farm flourished. The great steel\r\nmills and factories to the south were closing in upon her but had not\r\nyet set iron foot on her rich green acres. She was rather famous now for\r\nthe quality of her farm products and her pens. You saw \xe2\x80\x9cDeJong\r\nasparagus\xe2\x80\x9d on the menu at the Blackstone and the Drake hotels. Sometimes\r\nDirk\xe2\x80\x99s friends twitted him about this and he did not always acknowledge\r\nthat the similarity of names was not a coincidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirk, you seem to see no one but just these people,\xe2\x80\x9d Selina told him in\r\none of her infrequent rebukes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t get the full flavour of life.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have a vulgar curiosity about people and things. All kinds\r\nof people. All kinds of things. You revolve in the same little circle,\r\nover and over and over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t time. Can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to take the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t afford not to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes Selina came into town for a week or ten days at a stretch, and\r\nindulged in what she called an orgy. At such times Julie Arnold would\r\ninvite her to occupy one of the guest rooms at the Arnold house, or Dirk\r\nwould offer her his bedroom and tell her that he would be comfortable on\r\nthe big couch in the living room, or that he would take a room at the\r\nUniversity Club. She always declined. She would take a room in a hotel,\r\nsometimes north, sometimes south. Her holiday before her she would go\r\noff roaming gaily as a small boy on a Saturday morning, with the day\r\nstretching gorgeously and adventuresomely ahead of him, sallies down the\r\nstreet without plan or appointment, knowing that richness in one form or\r\nanother lies before him for the choosing. She loved the Michigan\r\nBoulevard and State Street shop windows in which haughty waxed ladies in\r\nglittering evening gowns postured, fingers elegantly crooked as they\r\nheld a fan, a rose, a programme, meanwhile smiling condescendingly out\r\nupon an envious world flattening its nose against the plate glass\r\nbarrier. A sociable woman, Selina, savouring life, she liked the lights,\r\nthe colour, the rush, the noise. Her years of grinding work, with her\r\nface pressed down to the very soil itself, had failed to kill her zest\r\nfor living. She prowled into the city\xe2\x80\x99s foreign quarters\xe2\x80\x94Italian,\r\nGreek, Chinese, Jewish. She penetrated the Black Belt, where Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvast and growing Negro population shifted and moved and stretched its\r\ngreat limbs ominously, reaching out and out in protest and overflowing\r\nthe bounds that irked it. Her serene face and her quiet manner, her\r\nbland interest and friendly look protected her. They thought her a\r\nsocial worker, perhaps; one of the uplifters. She bought and read the\r\n_Independent_, the Negro newspaper in which herb doctors advertised\r\nmagic roots. She even sent the twenty-five cents required for a box of\r\nthese, charmed by their names\xe2\x80\x94Adam and Eve roots, Master of the Woods,\r\nDragon\xe2\x80\x99s Blood, High John the Conqueror, Jezebel Roots, Grains of\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk would protest, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t wander around like\r\nthat. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t safe. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t High Prairie, you know. If you want to\r\ngo round I\xe2\x80\x99ll get Saki to drive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, mildly. But she never availed herself of\r\nthis offer. Sometimes she went over to South Water Street, changed now,\r\nand swollen to such proportions that it threatened to burst its\r\nconfines. She liked to stroll along the crowded sidewalks, lined with\r\ncrates and boxes and barrels of fruits, vegetables, poultry. Swarthy\r\nforeign faces predominated now. Where the red-faced overalled men had\r\nbeen she now saw lean muscular lads in old army shirts and khaki pants\r\nand scuffed puttees wheeling trucks, loading boxes, charging down the\r\nstreet in huge rumbling auto vans. Their faces were hard, their talk\r\nterse. They moved gracefully, with an economy of gesture. Any one of\r\nthese, she reflected, was more vital, more native, functioned more\r\nusefully and honestly than her successful son, Dirk DeJong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere \xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99 beans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn th\xe2\x80\x99 ol\xe2\x80\x99 beanery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBest you can get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMany of the older men knew her, shook hands with her, chatted a moment\r\nfriendlily. William Talcott, a little more dried up, more wrinkled, his\r\nsparse hair quite gray now, still leaned up against the side of his\r\ndoorway in his shirt sleeves and his neat pepper-and-salt pants and\r\nvest, a pretty good cigar, unlighted, in his mouth, the heavy gold watch\r\nchain spanning his middle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you certainly made good, Mrs. DeJong. Remember the day you come\r\nhere with your first load?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, yes. She remembered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat boy of yours has made his mark, too, I see. Doing grand, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\r\nWa-al, great satisfaction having a son turn out well like that. Yes,\r\nsirree! Why, look at my da\xe2\x80\x99ter Car\xe2\x80\x99line\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLife at High Prairie had its savour, too. Frequently you saw strange\r\nvisitors there for a week or ten days at a time\xe2\x80\x94boys and girls whose\r\ncity pallor gave way to a rich tan; tired-looking women with sagging\r\nfigures who drank Selina\xe2\x80\x99s cream and ate her abundant vegetables and\r\ntender chickens as though they expected these viands to be momentarily\r\nsnatched from them. Selina picked these up in odd corners of the city.\r\nDirk protested against this, too. Selina was a member of the High\r\nPrairie school board now. She often drove about the roads and into town\r\nin a disreputable Ford which she manipulated with imagination and skill.\r\nShe was on the Good Roads Committee and the Truck Farmers\xe2\x80\x99 Association\r\nvalued her opinion. Her life was full, pleasant, prolific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nPaula had a scheme for interesting women in bond buying. It was a good\r\nscheme. She suggested it so that Dirk thought he had thought of it. Dirk\r\nwas head now of the bond department in the Great Lakes Trust Company\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmagnificent new white building on Michigan Boulevard north. Its white\r\ntowers gleamed pink in the lake mists. Dirk said it was a terrible\r\nbuilding, badly proportioned, and that it looked like a vast vanilla\r\nsundae. His new private domain was more like a splendid bookless library\r\nthan a business office. It was finished in rich dull walnut and there\r\nwere great upholstered chairs, soft rugs, shaded lights. Special\r\nattention was paid to women clients. There was a room for their\r\nconvenience fitted with low restful chairs and couches, lamps, writing\r\ndesks, in mauve and rose. Paula had selected the furnishings for this\r\nroom. Ten years earlier it would have been considered absurd in a suite\r\nof business offices. Now it was a routine part of the equipment.\r\n\r\nDirk\xe2\x80\x99s private office was almost as difficult of access as that of the\r\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s executive. Cards, telephones, office boys, secretaries stood\r\nbetween the caller and Dirk DeJong, head of the bond department. You\r\nasked for him, uttering his name in the ear of the six-foot statuesque\r\ndetective who, in the guise of usher, stood in the centre of the marble\r\nrotunda eyeing each visitor with a coldly appraising gaze. This one\r\npadded softly ahead of you on rubber heels, only to give you over to the\r\ncare of a glorified office boy who took your name. You waited. He\r\nreturned. You waited. Presently there appeared a young woman with\r\ninquiring eyebrows. She conversed with you. She vanished. You waited.\r\nShe reappeared. You were ushered into Dirk DeJong\xe2\x80\x99s large and luxurious\r\ninner office. And there formality fled.\r\n\r\nDirk was glad to see you; quietly, interestedly glad to see you. As you\r\nstated your business he listened attentively, as was his charming way.\r\nThe volume of business done with women clients by the Great Lakes Trust\r\nCompany was enormous. Dirk was conservative, helpful\xe2\x80\x94and he always got\r\nthe business. He talked little. He was amazingly effective. Ladies in\r\nthe modish black of recent bereavement made quite a sombre procession to\r\nhis door. His suggestions (often originating with Paula) made the Great\r\nLakes Trust Company\xe2\x80\x99s discreet advertising rich in results. Neat little\r\npamphlets written for women on the subjects of saving, investments. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare not dealing with a soulless corporation,\xe2\x80\x9d said these brochures. \xe2\x80\x9cMay\r\nwe serve you? You need more than friends. Before acting, you should have\r\nyour judgment vindicated by an organization of investment specialists.\r\nYou may have relatives and friends, some of whom would gladly advise you\r\non investments. But perhaps you rightly feel that the less they know\r\nabout your financial affairs, the better. To handle trusts, and to care\r\nfor the securities of widows and orphans, is our business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was startling to note how this sort of thing mounted into millions.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen are becoming more and more used to the handling of money,\xe2\x80\x9d Paula\r\nsaid, shrewdly. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty soon their patronage is going to be as valuable\r\nas that of men. The average woman doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know about bonds\xe2\x80\x94about bond\r\nbuying. They think they\xe2\x80\x99re something mysterious and risky. They ought to\r\nbe educated up to it. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say something, Dirk, about classes in\r\nfinance for women? You could make a sort of semi-social affair of it.\r\nSend out invitations and get various bankers\xe2\x80\x94big men, whose names are\r\nknown\xe2\x80\x94to talk to these women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut would the women come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they\xe2\x80\x99d come. Women will accept any invitation that\xe2\x80\x99s engraved\r\non heavy cream paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Great Lakes Trust had a branch in Cleveland now, and one in New\r\nYork, on Fifth Avenue. The drive to interest women in bond buying and to\r\ninstruct them in finance was to take on almost national proportions.\r\nThere was to be newspaper and magazine advertising.\r\n\r\nThe Talks for Women on the Subject of Finance were held every two weeks\r\nin the crystal room of the Blackstone and were a great success. Paula\r\nwas right. Much of old Aug Hempel\xe2\x80\x99s shrewdness and business foresight\r\nhad descended to her. The women came\xe2\x80\x94widows with money to invest;\r\nbusiness women who had thriftily saved a portion of their salaries;\r\nmoneyed women who wanted to manage their own property, or who resented a\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s interference. Some came out of curiosity. Others for lack of\r\nanything better to do. Others to gaze on the well-known banker or lawyer\r\nor business man who was scheduled to address the meeting. Dirk spoke\r\nthree or four times during the winter and was markedly a favourite. The\r\nwomen, in smart cr\xc3\xaape gowns and tailored suits and small chic hats,\r\ntwittered and murmured about him, even while they sensibly digested his\r\nwell-thought-out remarks. He looked very handsome, clean-cut, and\r\ndistinguished there on the platform in his admirably tailored clothes, a\r\nsmall white flower in his buttonhole. He talked easily, clearly,\r\nfluently; answered the questions put to him afterward with just the\r\nright mixture of thoughtful hesitation and confidence.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that for the national advertising there must be an\r\nillustration that would catch the eye of women, and interest them. The\r\nperson to do it, Dirk thought, was this Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara whose queer\r\nhen-track signature you saw scrawled on half the advertising\r\nillustrations that caught your eye. Paula had not been enthusiastic\r\nabout this idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM-m-m, she\xe2\x80\x99s very good,\xe2\x80\x9d Paula had said, guardedly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut aren\xe2\x80\x99t there\r\nothers who are better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe!\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk had exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it a woman? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. That name\r\nmight be anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman. She\xe2\x80\x99s said to be very\xe2\x80\x94very attractive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk sent for Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara. She replied, suggesting an appointment two\r\nweeks from that date. Dirk decided not to wait, consulted other\r\ncommercial artists, looked at their work, heard their plans outlined,\r\nand was satisfied with none of them. The time was short. Ten days had\r\npassed. He had his secretary call Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara on the telephone. Could\r\nshe come down to see him that day at eleven?\r\n\r\nNo: she worked until four daily at her studio.\r\n\r\nCould she come to his office at four-thirty, then?\r\n\r\nYes, but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be better if he could come to her studio where he\r\ncould see something of the various types of drawings\xe2\x80\x94oils, or\r\nblack-and-white, or crayons. She was working mostly in crayons now.\r\n\r\nAll this relayed by his secretary at the telephone to Dirk at his desk.\r\nHe jammed his cigarette-end viciously into a tray, blew a final\r\ninfuriated wraith of smoke, and picked up the telephone connection on\r\nhis own desk. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of those damned temperamental near-artists trying to\r\nbe grand,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, his hand over the mouthpiece. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Miss\r\nRawlings\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to her. Switch her over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Miss\xe2\x80\x94uh\xe2\x80\x94O\xe2\x80\x99Mara. This is Mr. DeJong talking. I much prefer that\r\nyou come to my office and talk to me.\xe2\x80\x9d (No more of this nonsense.)\r\n\r\nHer voice: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, if you prefer it. I thought the other would save\r\nus both some time. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there at four-thirty.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice was\r\nleisurely, low, rounded. An admirable voice. Restful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Four-thirty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk, crisply. Jerked the receiver onto\r\nthe hook. That was the way to handle \xe2\x80\x99em. These females of forty with\r\nstraggling hair and a bundle of drawings under their arm.\r\n\r\nThe female of forty with straggling hair and a bundle of drawings under\r\nher arm was announced at four-thirty to the dot. Dirk let her wait five\r\nminutes in the outer office, being still a little annoyed. At\r\nfour-thirty-five there entered his private office a tall slim girl in a\r\nsmart little broadtail jacket, fur-trimmed skirt, and a black hat at\r\nonce so daring and so simple that even a man must recognize its French\r\nnativity. She carried no portfolio of drawings under her arms.\r\n\r\nThrough the man\xe2\x80\x99s mind flashed a series of unbusinesslike thoughts such\r\nas: \xe2\x80\x9cGosh! . . . Eyes! . . . That\xe2\x80\x99s way I like to see girl dress . . .\r\nTired looking . . . No, guess it\xe2\x80\x99s her eyes\xe2\x80\x94sort of fatigued. . . .\r\nPretty . . . No, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t . . . yes, she . . .\xe2\x80\x9d Aloud he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nvery kind of you, Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he thought that sounded pompous and\r\nsaid, curtly, \xe2\x80\x9cSit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara sat down. Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara looked at him with her tired deep blue\r\neyes. Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara said nothing. She regarded him pleasantly, quietly,\r\ncomposedly. He waited for her to say that usually she did not come to\r\nbusiness offices; that she had only twenty minutes to give him; that the\r\nday was warm, or cold; his office handsome; the view over the river\r\nmagnificent. Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara said nothing, pleasantly. So Dirk began to\r\ntalk, rather hurriedly.\r\n\r\nNow, this was a new experience for Dirk DeJong. Usually women spoke to\r\nhim first and fluently. Quiet women waxed voluble under his silence;\r\nvoluble women chattered. Paula always spoke a hundred words to his one.\r\nBut here was a woman more silent than he; not sullenly silent, nor\r\nheavily silent, but quietly, composedly, restfully silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the sort of thing we want, Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara.\xe2\x80\x9d He told her.\r\nWhen he had finished she probably would burst out with three or four\r\nplans. The others had done that.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll think about it for a couple of days\r\nwhile I\xe2\x80\x99m working on something else. I always do. I\xe2\x80\x99m doing an olive\r\nsoap picture now. I can begin work on yours Wednesday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see it\xe2\x80\x94that is, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have an idea of what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re planning to do with it.\xe2\x80\x9d Did she think he was going to let her go\r\nahead without consulting his judgment!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it will be all right. But drop into the studio if you like. It will\r\ntake me about a week, I suppose. I\xe2\x80\x99m over on Ontario in that old studio\r\nbuilding. You\xe2\x80\x99ll know it by the way most of the bricks have fallen out\r\nof the building and are scattered over the sidewalk.\xe2\x80\x9d She smiled a slow\r\nwide smile. Her teeth were good but her mouth was too big, he thought.\r\nNice big warm kind of smile, though. He found himself smiling, too,\r\nsociably. Then he became businesslike again. Very businesslike.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you\xe2\x80\x94what is your\xe2\x80\x94what would you expect to get for a\r\ndrawing such as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen hundred dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her then. Perhaps that had been humour. But she\r\nwas not smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean fifteen hundred for a single drawing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor that sort of thing, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we can\xe2\x80\x99t pay that, Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara stood up. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is my price.\xe2\x80\x9d She was not at all\r\nembarrassed. He realized that he had never seen such effortless\r\ncomposure. It was he who was fumbling with the objects on his\r\nflat-topped desk\xe2\x80\x94a pen, a sheet of paper, a blotter. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Mr.\r\nDeJong.\xe2\x80\x9d She held out a friendly hand. He took it. Her hair was\r\ngold\xe2\x80\x94dull gold, not bright\xe2\x80\x94and coiled in a single great knot at the\r\nback of her head, low. He took her hand. The tired eyes looked up at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if that\xe2\x80\x99s your price, Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared to pay any\r\nsuch\xe2\x80\x94but of course I suppose you top-notchers do get crazy prices for\r\nyour work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot any crazier than the prices you top-notchers get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, fifteen hundred dollars is quite a lot of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so, too. But then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll always think anything over nine dollars\r\nis quite a lot of money. You see, I used to get twenty-five cents apiece\r\nfor sketching hats for Gage\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was undeniably attractive. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you\xe2\x80\x99ve arrived. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsuccessful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArrived! Heavens, no! I\xe2\x80\x99ve started.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gets more money than you do for a drawing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, in another minute I\xe2\x80\x99ll be telling you the story of my\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled again her slow wide smile; turned to leave. Dirk decided that\r\nwhile most women\xe2\x80\x99s mouths were merely features this girl\xe2\x80\x99s was a\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\nShe was gone. Miss Ethelinda Quinn _et al._, in the outer office,\r\nappraised the costume of Miss Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara from her made-to-order\r\nfootgear to her made-in-France millinery and achieved a lightning mental\r\nreconstruction of their own costumes. Dirk DeJong in the inner office\r\nrealized that he had ordered a fifteen-hundred-dollar drawing, sight\r\nunseen, and that Paula was going to ask questions about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake a note, Miss Rawlings, to call Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara\xe2\x80\x99s studio on Thursday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the next few days he learned that a surprising lot of people knew a\r\nsurprisingly good deal about this Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara. She hailed from Texas,\r\nhence the absurd name. She was\r\ntwenty-eight\xe2\x80\x94twenty-five\xe2\x80\x94thirty-two\xe2\x80\x94thirty-six. She was beautiful.\r\nShe was ugly. She was an orphan. She had worked her way through art\r\nschool. She had no sense of the value of money. Two years ago she had\r\nachieved sudden success with her drawings. Her ambition was to work in\r\noils. She toiled like a galley-slave; played like a child; had twenty\r\nbeaux and no lover; her friends, men and women, were legion and wandered\r\nin and out of her studio as though it were a public thoroughfare. You\r\nwere likely to find there at any hour any one from Bert Colson, the\r\nblackface musical comedy star, to Mrs. Robinson Gilman of Lake Forest\r\nand Paris; from Leo Mahler, first violin with the Chicago Symphony\r\nOrchestra, to Fanny Whipple who designed dresses for Carson\xe2\x80\x99s. She\r\nsupported an assortment of unlucky brothers and spineless sisters in\r\nTexas and points west.\r\n\r\nMiss Rawlings made an appointment for Thursday at three. Paula said\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d go with him and went. She dressed for Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara and the result\r\nwas undeniably enchanting. Dallas sometimes did a crayon portrait, or\r\neven attempted one in oils. Had got a prize for her portrait of Mrs.\r\nRobinson Gilman at last spring\xe2\x80\x99s portrait exhibit at the Chicago Art\r\nInstitute. It was considered something of an achievement to be asked to\r\npose for her. Paula\xe2\x80\x99s hat had been chosen in deference to her hair and\r\nprofile, and the neck line of her gown in deference to hat, hair, and\r\nprofile, and her pearls with an eye to all four. The whole defied\r\ncompetition on the part of Miss Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara.\r\n\r\nMiss Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara, in her studio, was perched on a high stool before an\r\neasel with a large tray of assorted crayons at her side. She looked a\r\nsight and didn\xe2\x80\x99t care at all. She greeted Dirk and Paula with a cheerful\r\nfriendliness and went right on working. A model, very smartly gowned,\r\nwas sitting for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is it. Do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to\r\nlike it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that it?\xe2\x80\x9d It was merely the beginning of a drawing\r\nof the smartly gowned model. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Fifteen hundred\r\ndollars!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was going to be a picture of a woman buying\r\nbonds.\xe2\x80\x9d She went on working. She squinted one eye, picked up a funny\r\nlittle mirror thing which she held to one side, looked into, and put\r\ndown. She made a black mark on the board with a piece of crayon then\r\nsmeared the mark with her thumb. She had on a faded all-enveloping smock\r\nover which French ink, rubber cement, pencil marks, crayon dust and wash\r\nwere so impartially distributed that the whole blended and mixed in a\r\nrich mellow haze like the Chicago atmosphere itself. The collar of a\r\nwhite silk blouse, not especially clean, showed above this. On her feet\r\nwere soft kid bedroom slippers, scuffed, with pompons on them. Her dull\r\ngold hair was carelessly rolled into that great loose knot at the back.\r\nAcross one cheek was a swipe of black.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Dirk, \xe2\x80\x9cshe looks a sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara waved a friendly hand toward some chairs on which were\r\npiled hats, odd garments, bristol board and (on the broad arm of one) a\r\npiece of yellow cake. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down.\xe2\x80\x9d She called to the girl who had opened\r\nthe door to them: \xe2\x80\x9cGilda, will you dump some of those things. This is\r\nMrs. Storm, Mr. DeJong\xe2\x80\x94Gilda Hanan.\xe2\x80\x9d Her secretary, Dirk later learned.\r\n\r\nThe place was disorderly, comfortable, shabby. A battered grand piano\r\nstood in one corner. A great skylight formed half the ceiling and sloped\r\ndown at the north end of the room. A man and a girl sat talking\r\nearnestly on the couch in another corner. A swarthy foreign-looking\r\nchap, vaguely familiar to Dirk, was playing softly at the piano. The\r\ntelephone rang. Miss Hanan took the message, transmitted it to Dallas\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Mara, received the answer, repeated it. Perched atop the stool, one\r\nslippered foot screwed in a rung, Dallas worked on concentratedly,\r\ncalmly, earnestly. A lock of hair straggled over her eyes. She pushed it\r\nback with her wrist and left another dark splotch on her forehead. There\r\nwas something splendid, something impressive, something magnificent\r\nabout her absorption, her indifference to appearance, her unawareness of\r\noutsiders, her concentration on the work before her. Her nose was shiny.\r\nDirk hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen a girl with a shiny nose in years. They were always\r\ntaking out those little boxes and things and plastering themselves with\r\nthe stuff in \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you work with all this crowd around?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dallas in that deep restful leisurely voice of hers, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nare always between twenty and thirty\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she slapped a quick scarlet line\r\non the board, rubbed it out at once\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthousand people in and out of here\r\nevery hour, just about. I like it. Friends around me while I\xe2\x80\x99m slaving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go?\xe2\x80\x9d said Paula.\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten all about her. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready if you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOutside, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to like the picture?\xe2\x80\x9d Paula asked.\r\nThey stepped into her car.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Can\xe2\x80\x99t tell much about it at this stage, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack to your office?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttractive, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he was going to be on his guard, was he! Paula threw in the clutch\r\nviciously, jerked the lever into second speed. \xe2\x80\x9cHer neck was dirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrayon dust,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot necessarily,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Paula.\r\n\r\nDirk turned sideways to look at her. It was as though he saw her for the\r\nfirst time. She looked brittle, hard, artificial\xe2\x80\x94small, somehow. Not in\r\nphysique but in personality.\r\n\r\nThe picture was finished and delivered within ten days. In that time\r\nDirk went twice to the studio in Ontario Street. Dallas did not seem to\r\nmind. Neither did she appear particularly interested. She was working\r\nhard both times. Once she looked as he had seen her on her first visit.\r\nThe second time she had on a fresh crisp smock of faded yellow that was\r\nglorious with her hair; and high-heeled beige kid slippers, very smart.\r\nShe was like a little girl who has just been freshly scrubbed and\r\ndressed in a clean pinafore, Dirk thought.\r\n\r\nHe thought a good deal about Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara. He found himself talking\r\nabout her in what he assumed to be a careless offhand manner. He liked\r\nto talk about her. He told his mother of her. He could let himself go\r\nwith Selina and he must have taken advantage of this for she looked at\r\nhim intently and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to meet her. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met a girl like\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask her if she\xe2\x80\x99ll let me bring you up to the studio some time when\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re in town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was practically impossible to get a minute with her alone. That\r\nirritated him. People were always drifting in and out of the\r\nstudio\xe2\x80\x94queer, important, startling people; little, dejected, shabby\r\npeople. An impecunious girl art student, red-haired and wistful, that\r\nDallas was taking in until the girl got some money from home; a\r\npearl-hung grand-opera singer who was condescending to the Chicago Opera\r\nfor a fortnight. He did not know that Dallas played until he came upon\r\nher late one afternoon sitting at the piano in the twilight with Bert\r\nColson, the blackface comedian. Colson sang those terrible songs about\r\nApril showers bringing violets, and about mah Ma-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-my\r\nbut they didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem terrible when he sang them. There was about this\r\nlean, hollow-chested, sombre-eyed comedian a poignant pathos, a gorgeous\r\nsense of rhythm\xe2\x80\x94a something unnameable that bound you to him, made you\r\nlove him. In the theatre he came out to the edge of the runway and took\r\nthe audience in his arms. He talked like a bootblack and sang like an\r\nangel. Dallas at the piano, he leaning over it, were doing \xe2\x80\x9cblues.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ntwo were rapt, ecstatic. I got the blues\xe2\x80\x94I said the blues\xe2\x80\x94I got the\r\nthis or that\xe2\x80\x94the somethingorother\xe2\x80\x94blue\xe2\x80\x94hoo-hoos. They scarcely\r\nnoticed Dirk. Dallas had nodded when he came in, and had gone on\r\nplaying. Colson sang the cheaply sentimental ballad as though it were\r\nthe folksong of a tragic race. His arms were extended, his face rapt. As\r\nDallas played the tears stood in her eyes. When they had finished,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it a terrible song?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m crazy about it. Bert\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\nto try it out to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x94uh\xe2\x80\x94wrote it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dirk politely.\r\n\r\nDallas began to play again. \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m? Oh, I did.\xe2\x80\x9d They were off once more.\r\nThey paid no more attention to Dirk. Yet there was nothing rude about\r\ntheir indifference. They simply were more interested in what they were\r\ndoing. He left telling himself that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go there again. Hanging\r\naround a studio. But next day he was back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara,\xe2\x80\x9d he had got her alone for a second. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\r\nwill you come out to dinner with me some time? And the theatre?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d He was actually trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night.\xe2\x80\x9d He had an important engagement. He cast it out of his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night! That\xe2\x80\x99s grand. Where do you want to dine? The Casino?\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nsmartest club in Chicago; a little pink stucco Italian box of a place on\r\nthe Lake Shore Drive. He was rather proud of being in a position to take\r\nher there as his guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I hate those arty little places. I like dining in a hotel full\r\nof all sorts of people. Dining in a club means you\xe2\x80\x99re surrounded by\r\npeople who\xe2\x80\x99re pretty much alike. Their membership in the club means\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re there because they are all interested in golf, or because\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re university graduates, or belong to the same political party or\r\nwrite, or paint, or have incomes of over fifty thousand a year, or\r\nsomething. I like \xe2\x80\x99em mixed up, higgledy-piggledy. A dining room full of\r\ngamblers, and insurance agents, and actors, and merchants, thieves,\r\nbootleggers, lawyers, kept ladies, wives, flaps, travelling men,\r\nmillionaires\xe2\x80\x94everything. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I call dining out. Unless one is\r\ndining at a friend\xe2\x80\x99s house, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d A rarely long speech for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll dine at my little apartment some time. Just\r\nfour or six of us, or even\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like the Drake to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks too much like a Roman bath. The pillars scare me. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to\r\nthe Blackstone. I\xe2\x80\x99ll always be sufficiently from Texas to think the\r\nBlackstone French room the last word in elegance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went to the Blackstone. The head waiter knew him. \xe2\x80\x9cGood evening,\r\nMr. DeJong.\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk was secretly gratified. Then, with a shock, he\r\nrealized that the head waiter was grinning at Dallas and Dallas was\r\ngrinning at the head waiter. \xe2\x80\x9cHello, Andr\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dallas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Miss O\xe2\x80\x99Mara.\xe2\x80\x9d The text of his greeting was correct and\r\nbefitting the head waiter of the French room at the Blackstone. But his\r\nvoice was lyric and his eyes glowed. His manner of seating her at a\r\ntable was an enthronement.\r\n\r\nAt the look in Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cI met him in the army,\xe2\x80\x9d Dallas explained,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen I was in France. He\xe2\x80\x99s a grand lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you in\xe2\x80\x94what did you do in France?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, odd jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer dinner gown was very smart, but the pink ribbon strap of an\r\nunder-garment showed untidily at one side. Her silk brassiere, probably.\r\nPaula would have\xe2\x80\x94but then, a thing like that was impossible in Paula\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfection of toilette. He loved the way the gown cut sharply away at\r\nthe shoulder to show her firm white arms. It was dull gold, the colour\r\nof her hair. This was one Dallas. There were a dozen\xe2\x80\x94a hundred. Yet she\r\nwas always the same. You never knew whether you were going to meet the\r\ngamin of the rumpled smock and the smudged face or the beauty of the\r\nlittle fur jacket. Sometimes Dirk thought she looked like a Swede hired\r\ngirl with those high cheek bones of hers and her deep-set eyes and her\r\nlarge capable hands. Sometimes he thought she looked like the splendid\r\ngoddesses you saw in paintings\xe2\x80\x94the kind with high pointed breasts and\r\ngracious gentle pose\xe2\x80\x94holding out a horn of plenty. There was about her\r\nsomething genuine and earthy and elemental. He noticed that her nails\r\nwere short and not well cared for\xe2\x80\x94not glittering and pointed and\r\ncruelly sharp and horridly vermilion, like Paula\xe2\x80\x99s. That pleased him,\r\ntoo, somehow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome oysters?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly safe here. Or fruit\r\ncocktail? Then breast of guinea hen under glass and an artichoke\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked a little worried. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x94suppose you take that. Me, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike a steak and some potatoes au gratin and a salad with Russian\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s fine!\xe2\x80\x9d He was delighted. He doubled that order and they consumed\r\nit with devastating thoroughness. She ate rolls. She ate butter. She\r\nmade no remarks about the food except to say, once, that it was good and\r\nthat she had forgotten to eat lunch because she had been so busy\r\nworking. All this Dirk found most restful and refreshing. Usually, when\r\nyou dined in a restaurant with a woman she said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to eat\r\none of those crisp little rolls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInvariably the answer to this was, \xe2\x80\x9cI daren\xe2\x80\x99t! Goodness! A half pound at\r\nleast. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t eaten a roll with butter in a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain you said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid I\xe2\x80\x99ll get fat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAutomatically, \xe2\x80\x9cYou! Nonsense. You\xe2\x80\x99re just right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was bored with these women who talked about their weight, figure,\r\nlines. He thought it in bad taste. Paula was always rigidly refraining\r\nfrom this or that. It made him uncomfortable to sit at the table facing\r\nher; eating his thorough meal while she nibbled fragile curls of Melba\r\ntoast, a lettuce leaf, and half a sugarless grapefruit. It lessened his\r\nenjoyment of his own oysters, steak, coffee. He thought that she always\r\neyed his food a little avidly, for all her expressed indifference to it.\r\nShe was looking a little haggard, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe theatre\xe2\x80\x99s next door,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cJust a step. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to leave\r\nhere until after eight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nice.\xe2\x80\x9d She had her cigarette with her coffee in a mellow\r\nsensuous atmosphere of enjoyment. He was talking about himself a good\r\ndeal. He felt relaxed, at ease, happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I\xe2\x80\x99m an architect\xe2\x80\x94at least, I was one. Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\r\nlike to hang around your shop so. I get sort of homesick for the pencils\r\nand the drawing board\xe2\x80\x94the whole thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you give it up, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean\xe2\x80\x94nothing in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo money. After the war nobody was building. Oh, I suppose if I\xe2\x80\x99d hung\r\non\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you became a banker, h\xe2\x80\x99m? Well, there ought to be money enough\r\nin a bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was a little nettled. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a banker\xe2\x80\x94at first. I was a bond\r\nsalesman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer brows met in a little frown. Her eyebrows were thick and strongly\r\nmarked and a little uneven and inclined to meet over her nose. Paula\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrows were a mere line of black\xe2\x80\x94a carefully traced half-parenthesis\r\nabove her unmysterious dark eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather,\xe2\x80\x9d Dallas said, slowly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cplan one back door of a building that\xe2\x80\x99s going to help make this town\r\nbeautiful and significant than sell all the bonds that ever floated\r\na\xe2\x80\x94whatever it is that bonds are supposed to float.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe defended himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt that way, too. But you see my mother had\r\ngiven me my education, really. She worked for it. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go dubbing\r\nalong, earning just enough to keep me. I wanted to give her things. I\r\nwanted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she want those things? Did she want you to give up architecture and\r\ngo into bonds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that she exactly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He was too decent\xe2\x80\x94still\r\ntoo much the son of Selina DeJong\xe2\x80\x94to be able to lie about that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you were going to let me meet her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you let me bring her in? Or perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d even\xe2\x80\x94would you drive\r\nout to the farm with me some day. She\xe2\x80\x99d like that so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo would I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned toward her, suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cListen, Dallas. What do you think of\r\nme, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d He wanted to know. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand not knowing any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re a nice young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was terrible. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to think I\xe2\x80\x99m a nice young man.\r\nI want you to like me\xe2\x80\x94a lot. Tell me, what haven\xe2\x80\x99t I got that you think\r\nI ought to have? Why do you put me off so many times? I never feel that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m really near you. What is it I lack?\xe2\x80\x9d He was abject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking for it. I do demand of the people I see often\r\nthat they possess at least a splash of splendour in their makeup. Some\r\npeople are nine tenths splendour and one tenth tawdriness, like Gene\r\nMeran. And some are nine tenths tawdriness and one tenth splendour, like\r\nSam Huebch. But some people are all just a nice even pink without a\r\nsingle patch of royal purple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s me, h\xe2\x80\x99m?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was horribly disappointed, hurt, wretched. But a little angry, too.\r\nHis pride. Why, he was Dirk DeJong, the most successful of Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyounger men; the most promising; the most popular. After all, what did\r\nshe do but paint commercial pictures for fifteen hundred dollars apiece?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happens to the men who fall in love with you? What do they do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDallas stirred her coffee thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThey usually tell me about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they seem to feel better and we become great friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you ever fall in love with them?\xe2\x80\x9d Pretty damned sure of\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you ever fall in love with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost always do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dallas.\r\n\r\nHe plunged. \xe2\x80\x9cI could give you a lot of things you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got, purple or\r\nno purple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to France in April. Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean! Paris. What for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStudy. I want to do portraits. Oils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was terrified. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you do them here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. Not what I need. I have been studying here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking\r\nlife-work three nights a week at the Art Institute, just to keep my hand\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s where you are, evenings.\xe2\x80\x9d He was strangely relieved. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\r\ngo with you some time, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d Anything. Anything.\r\n\r\nShe took him with her one evening, steering him successfully past the\r\nstern Irishman who guarded the entrance to the basement classrooms; to\r\nher locker, got into her smock, grabbed her brushes. She rushed down the\r\nhall. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk,\xe2\x80\x9d she cautioned him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt bothers them. I wonder what\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d think of my shop.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned into a small, cruelly bright,\r\nbreathlessly hot little room, its walls whitewashed. Every inch of the\r\nfloor space was covered with easels. Before them stood men and women,\r\nbrushes in hand, intent. Dallas went directly to her place, fell to work\r\nat once. Dirk blinked in the strong light. He glanced at the dais toward\r\nwhich they were all gazing from time to time as they worked. On it lay a\r\nnude woman.\r\n\r\nTo himself Dirk said in a sort of panic: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, say, she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got any\r\nclothes on! My gosh! this is fierce. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got anything on!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ntried, meanwhile, to look easy, careless, critical. Strangely enough, he\r\nsucceeded, after the first shock, not only in looking at ease, but\r\nfeeling so. The class was doing the whole figure in oils.\r\n\r\nThe model was a moron with a skin like velvet and rose petals. She fell\r\ninto poses that flowed like cream. Her hair was waved in wooden\r\nundulations and her nose was pure vulgarity and her earrings were\r\ndrug-store pearls in triple strands but her back was probably finer than\r\nHelen\xe2\x80\x99s and her breasts twin snowdrifts peaked with coral. In twenty\r\nminutes Dirk found himself impersonally interested in tone, shadows,\r\ncolours, line. He listened to the low-voiced instructor and squinted\r\ncarefully to ascertain whether that shadow on the model\xe2\x80\x99s stomach really\r\nshould be painted blue or brown. Even he could see that Dallas\xe2\x80\x99s canvas\r\nwas almost insultingly superior to that of the men and women about her.\r\nBeneath the flesh on her canvas there were muscles, and beneath those\r\nmuscles blood and bone. You felt she had a surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of\r\nanatomy. That, Dirk decided, was what made her commercial pictures so\r\nattractive. The drawing she had done for the Great Lakes Trust Company\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbond department had been conventional enough in theme. The treatment,\r\nthe technique, had made it arresting. He thought that if she ever did\r\nportraits in oils they would be vital and compelling portraits. But oh,\r\nhe wished she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do portraits in oils. He wished\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nIt was after eleven when they emerged from the Art Institute doorway and\r\nstood a moment together at the top of the broad steps surveying the\r\nworld that lay before them. Dallas said nothing. Suddenly the beauty of\r\nthe night rushed up and overwhelmed Dirk. Gorgeousness and tawdriness;\r\ncolour and gloom. At the right the white tower of the Wrigley building\r\nrose wraithlike against a background of purple sky. Just this side of it\r\na swarm of impish electric lights grinned their message in scarlet and\r\nwhite. In white:\r\n\r\n                                TRADE AT\r\n\r\nthen blackness, while you waited against your will. In red:\r\n\r\n                                THE FAIR\r\n\r\nBlackness again. Then, in a burst of both colours, in bigger letters,\r\nand in a blaze that hurled itself at your eyeballs, momentarily shutting\r\nout tower, sky, and street:\r\n\r\n                               SAVE MONEY\r\n\r\nStraight ahead the hut of the Adams Street L station in midair was a\r\nVenetian bridge with the black canal of asphalt flowing sluggishly\r\nbeneath. The reflection of cafeteria and cigar-shop windows on either\r\nside were slender shafts of light along the canal. An enchanting sight.\r\nDirk thought suddenly that Dallas was a good deal like that\xe2\x80\x94like\r\nChicago. A mixture of grandeur and cheapness; of tawdriness and\r\nmagnificence; of splendour and ugliness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dallas. A long breath. She was a part of all this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt an outsider. \xe2\x80\x9cWant a sandwich? Are you hungry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m starved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had sandwiches and coffee at an all-night one-arm lunch room\r\nbecause Dallas said her face was too dirty for a restaurant and she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to bother to wash it. She was more than ordinarily\r\ncompanionable that night; a little tired; less buoyant and independent\r\nthan usual. This gave her a little air of helplessness\xe2\x80\x94of fatigue\xe2\x80\x94that\r\naroused all his tenderness. Her smile gave him a warm rush of pure\r\nhappiness\xe2\x80\x94until he saw her smile in exactly the same way at the pimply\r\nyoung man who lorded it over the shining nickel coffee container, as she\r\ntold him that his coffee was grand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe things that had mattered so vitally didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be important,\r\nsomehow, now. The people who had seemed so desirable had become suddenly\r\ninsignificant. The games he had played appeared silly games. He was\r\nseeing things through Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara\xe2\x80\x99s wise, beauty-loving eyes.\r\nStrangely enough, he did not realize that this girl saw life from much\r\nthe same angle as that at which his mother regarded it. In the last few\r\nyears his mother had often offended him by her attitude toward these\r\nrich and powerful friends of his\xe2\x80\x94their ways, their games, their\r\namusements, their manners. And her way of living in turn offended him.\r\nOn his rare visits to the farm it seemed to him there was always some\r\ndrab dejected female in the kitchen or living room or on the porch\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nwoman with broken teeth and comic shoes and tragic eyes\xe2\x80\x94drinking great\r\ndraughts of coffee and telling her woes to Selina\xe2\x80\x94Sairey Gampish ladies\r\nsmelling unpleasantly of peppermint and perspiration and poverty. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nhe ain\xe2\x80\x99t had a lick of work since November\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say! That\xe2\x80\x99s terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wished she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nSometimes old Aug Hempel drove out there and Dirk would come upon the\r\ntwo snickering wickedly together about something that he knew concerned\r\nthe North Shore crowd.\r\n\r\nIt had been years since Selina had said, sociably, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did they have\r\nfor dinner, Dirk? H\xe2\x80\x99m?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94soup\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing before the soup?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yeh. Some kind of a\xe2\x80\x94one of those canap\xc3\xa9 things, you know.\r\nCaviare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy! Caviare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes Selina giggled like a naughty girl at things that Dirk had\r\ntaken quite seriously. The fox hunts, for example. Lake Forest had taken\r\nto fox hunting, and the Tippecanoe crowd kept kennels. Dirk had learned\r\nto ride\xe2\x80\x94pretty well. An Englishman\xe2\x80\x94a certain Captain\r\nStokes-Beatty\xe2\x80\x94had initiated the North Shore into the mysteries of fox\r\nhunting. Huntin\xe2\x80\x99. The North Shore learned to say nec\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99ry and\r\nconservat\xe2\x80\x99ry. Captain Stokes-Beatty was a tall, bow-legged, and somewhat\r\nhorse-faced young man, remote in manner. The nice Farnham girl seemed\r\nfated to marry him. Paula had had a hunt breakfast at Stormwood and it\r\nhad been very successful, though the American men had balked a little at\r\nthe devilled kidneys. The food had been patterned as far as possible\r\nafter the pale flabby viands served at English hunt breakfasts and\r\nruined in an atmosphere of luke-warm steam. The women were slim and\r\nperfectly tailored but wore their hunting clothes a trifle uneasily and\r\nself-consciously like girls in their first low-cut party dresses. Most\r\nof the men had turned stubborn on the subject of pink coats, but Captain\r\nStokes-Beatty wore his handsomely. The fox\xe2\x80\x94a worried and somewhat\r\ndejected-looking animal\xe2\x80\x94had been shipped in a crate from the south and\r\non being released had a way of sitting sociably in an Illinois corn\r\nfield instead of leaping fleetly to cover. At the finish you had a\r\nfeeling of guilt, as though you had killed a cockroach.\r\n\r\nDirk had told Selina about it, feeling rather magnificent. A fox hunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fox hunt! What for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor! Why, what\xe2\x80\x99s any fox hunt for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine. They used to be for the purpose of ridding a\r\nfox-infested country of a nuisance. Have the foxes been bothering \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nout in Lake Forest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mother, don\xe2\x80\x99t be funny.\xe2\x80\x9d He told her about the breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so silly, Dirk. It\xe2\x80\x99s smart to copy from another country\r\nthe things that that country does better than we do. England does\r\ngardens and wood-fires and dogs and tweeds and walking shoes and pipes\r\nand leisure better than we do. But those luke-warm steamy breakfasts of\r\ntheirs! It\xe2\x80\x99s because they haven\xe2\x80\x99t gas, most of them. No Kansas or\r\nNebraska farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife would stand for one of their kitchens\xe2\x80\x94not for a\r\nminute. And the hired man would balk at such bacon.\xe2\x80\x9d She giggled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Dallas O\xe2\x80\x99Mara felt much the same about these things. Dallas, it\r\nappeared, had been something of a fad with the North Shore society crowd\r\nafter she had painted Mrs. Robinson Gilman\xe2\x80\x99s portrait. She had been\r\ninvited to dinners and luncheons and dances, but their doings, she told\r\nDirk, had bored her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they don\xe2\x80\x99t have much fun. They\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\ntrying to be something they\xe2\x80\x99re not. And that\xe2\x80\x99s such hard work. The women\r\nwere always explaining that they lived in Chicago because their\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s business was here. They all do things pretty well\xe2\x80\x94dance or\r\npaint or ride or write or sing\xe2\x80\x94but not well enough. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nprofessional amateurs, trying to express something they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel; or\r\nthat they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel strongly enough to make it worth while expressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe admitted, though, that they did appreciate the things that other\r\npeople did well. Visiting and acknowledged writers, painters, lecturers,\r\nheroes, they entertained lavishly and hospitably in their Florentine or\r\nEnglish or Spanish or French palaces on the north side of Chicago,\r\nIllinois. Especially foreign notables of this description. Since 1918\r\nthese had descended upon Chicago (and all America) like a plague of\r\nlocusts, starting usually in New York and sweeping westward, devouring\r\nthe pleasant verdure of greenbacks and chirping as they came. Returning\r\nto Europe, bursting with profits and spleen, they thriftily wrote of\r\nwhat they had seen and the result was more clever than amiable; bearing,\r\ntoo, the taint of bad taste.\r\n\r\nNorth Shore hostesses vied for the honour of entertaining these\r\nnotables. Paula\xe2\x80\x94pretty, clever, moneyed, shrewd\xe2\x80\x94often emerged from\r\nthese contests the winner. Her latest catch was Emile Goguet\xe2\x80\x94General\r\nEmile Goguet, hero of Champagne\xe2\x80\x94Goguet of the stiff white beard, the\r\nempty left coat-sleeve, and the score of medals. He was coming to\r\nAmerica ostensibly to be the guest of the American Division which, with\r\nGoguet\xe2\x80\x99s French troops, had turned the German onslaught at Champagne,\r\nbut really, it was whispered, to cement friendly relations between his\r\ncountry and a somewhat diffident United States.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd guess,\xe2\x80\x9d trilled Paula, \xe2\x80\x9cguess who\xe2\x80\x99s coming with him, Dirk! That\r\nwonderful Roelf Pool, the French sculptor! Goguet\xe2\x80\x99s going to be my\r\nguest. Pool\xe2\x80\x99s going to do a bust, you know, of young Quentin Roosevelt\r\nfrom a photograph that Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you mean\xe2\x80\x94French sculptor! He\xe2\x80\x99s no more French than I am. He was\r\nborn within a couple of miles of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s farm. His people were Dutch\r\ntruck farmers. His father lived in High Prairie until a year ago, when\r\nhe died of a stroke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he told Selina she flushed like a girl, as she sometimes still did\r\nwhen she was much excited. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw it in the paper. I wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cif I shall see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat evening you might have seen her sitting, crosslegged, before the\r\nold carved chest, fingering the faded shabby time-worn objects the\r\nsaving of which Dirk had denounced as sentimental. The crude drawing of\r\nthe Haymarket; the wine-red cashmere dress; some faded brittle flowers.\r\n\r\nPaula was giving a large\xe2\x80\x94but not too large\xe2\x80\x94dinner on the second night.\r\nShe was very animated about it, excited, gay. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Dirk,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat Goguet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything but hard-boiled eggs and rusks. Oh,\r\nwell, the others won\xe2\x80\x99t object to squabs and mushrooms and things. And\r\nhis hobby is his farm in Brittany. Pool\xe2\x80\x99s stunning\xe2\x80\x94dark and sombre and\r\nvery white teeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPaula was very gay these days. Too gay. It seemed to Dirk that her\r\nnervous energy was inexhaustible\xe2\x80\x94and exhausting. Dirk refused to admit\r\nto himself how irked he was by the sallow heart-shaped exquisite face,\r\nthe lean brown clutching fingers, the air of ownership. He had begun to\r\ndislike things about her as an unfaithful spouse is irritated by quite\r\ninnocent mannerisms of his unconscious mate. She scuffed her heels a\r\nlittle when she walked, for example. It maddened him. She had a way of\r\nbiting the rough skin around her carefully tended nails when she was\r\nnervous. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t _do_ that!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nDallas never irritated him. She rested him, he told himself. He would\r\narm himself against her, but one minute after meeting her he would sink\r\ngratefully and resistlessly into her quiet depths. Sometimes he thought\r\nall this was an assumed manner in her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis calm of your\xe2\x80\x94this effortlessness,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her one day, \xe2\x80\x9cis a\r\npose, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Anything to get her notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartly,\xe2\x80\x9d Dallas had replied, amiably. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a nice pose though, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat are you going to do with a girl like that!\r\n\r\nHere was the woman who could hold him entirely, and who never held out a\r\nfinger to hold him. He tore at the smooth wall of her indifference,\r\nthough he only cut and bruised his own hands in doing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it because I\xe2\x80\x99m a successful business man that you don\xe2\x80\x99t like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you don\xe2\x80\x99t find me attractive, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think you\xe2\x80\x99re an awfully attractive man. Dangerous, that\xe2\x80\x99s wot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be the wide-eyed ing\xc3\xa9nue. You know damned well what I mean.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got me and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want me. If I had been a successful\r\narchitect instead of a successful business man would that have made any\r\ndifference?\xe2\x80\x9d He was thinking of what his mother had said just a few\r\nyears back, that night when they had talked at her bedside. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that it?\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s got to be an artist, I suppose, to interest you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, no! Some day I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably marry a horny-handed son of toil,\r\nand if I do it\xe2\x80\x99ll be the horny hands that will win me. If you want to\r\nknow, I like \xe2\x80\x99em with their scars on them. There\xe2\x80\x99s something about a man\r\nwho has fought for it\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is\xe2\x80\x94a look in his eye\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfeel of his hand. He needn\xe2\x80\x99t have been successful\xe2\x80\x94though he probably\r\nwould be. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m not very good at this analysis stuff. I only\r\nknow he\xe2\x80\x94well, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t a mark on you. Not a mark. You quit being an\r\narchitect, or whatever it was, because architecture was an uphill\r\ndisheartening job at the time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that you should have kept on.\r\nFor all I know you were a bum architect. But if you had kept on\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\nhad loved it enough to keep on\xe2\x80\x94fighting, and struggling, and sticking\r\nit out\xe2\x80\x94why, that fight would show in your face to-day\xe2\x80\x94in your eyes and\r\nyour jaw and your hands and in your way of standing and walking and\r\nsitting and talking. Listen. I\xe2\x80\x99m not criticizing you. But you\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nsmooth. I like \xe2\x80\x99em bumpy. That sounds terrible. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t what I mean at\r\nall. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk said, wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I know what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nsat looking down at his hands\xe2\x80\x94his fine strong unscarred hands. Suddenly\r\nand unreasonably he thought of another pair of hands\xe2\x80\x94his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nthe knuckles enlarged, the skin broken\xe2\x80\x94expressive\xe2\x80\x94her life written on\r\nthem. Scars. She had them. \xe2\x80\x9cListen, Dallas. If I thought\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d go back to\r\nHollis & Sprague\xe2\x80\x99s and begin all over again at forty a week if I thought\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XX\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Goguet and Roelf Pool had been in Chicago one night and part of\r\na day. Dirk had not met them\xe2\x80\x94was to meet them at Paula\xe2\x80\x99s dinner that\r\nevening. He was curious about Pool but not particularly interested in\r\nthe warrior. Restless, unhappy, wanting to see Dallas (he admitted it,\r\nbitterly) he dropped into her studio at an unaccustomed hour almost\r\nimmediately after lunch and heard gay voices and laughter. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe work alone once in a while without that rabble around her!\r\n\r\nDallas in a grimy smock and the scuffed kid slippers was entertaining\r\ntwo truants from Chicago society\xe2\x80\x94General Emile Goguet and Roelf Pool.\r\nThey seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely. She introduced Dirk as\r\ncasually as though their presence were a natural and expected\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94which it was. She had never mentioned them to him. Yet now: \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nis Dirk DeJong\xe2\x80\x94General Emile Goguet. We were campaigners together in\r\nFrance. Roelf Pool. So were we, weren\xe2\x80\x99t we, Roelf?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeneral Emile Goguet bowed formally, but his eyes were twinkling. He\r\nappeared to be having a very good time. Roelf Pool\xe2\x80\x99s dark face had\r\nlighted up with such a glow of surprise and pleasure as to transform it.\r\nHe strode over to Dirk, clasped his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cDirk DeJong! Not\xe2\x80\x94why, say,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you know me? I\xe2\x80\x99m Roelf Pool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to know you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dirk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but I mean I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94I knew you when you were a kid. You\xe2\x80\x99re Selina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDirk. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? My Selina. I\xe2\x80\x99m driving out to see her this afternoon.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s one of my reasons for being here. Why, I\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He was laughing,\r\ntalking excitedly, like a boy. Dallas, all agrin, was enjoying it\r\nimmensely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve run away,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained to Dirk, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the elaborate programme\r\nthat was arranged for them this afternoon. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the French\r\ngot their reputation for being polite. The General is a perfect boor,\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t you? And scared to death of women. He\xe2\x80\x99s the only French general\r\nin captivity who ever took the trouble to learn English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeneral Goguet nodded violently and roared. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Dirk\r\nin his careful and perfect English. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, too, are an artist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk said, \xe2\x80\x9cnot an artist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94uh\xe2\x80\x94bonds. That is, the banking business. Bonds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said General Goguet, politely. \xe2\x80\x9cBonds. A very good thing,\r\nbonds. We French are very fond of them. We have great respect for\r\nAmerican bonds, we French.\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded and twinkled and turned away to\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all going,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Dallas, and made a dash for the stuffy\r\nlittle bedroom off the studio.\r\n\r\nWell, this was a bit too informal. \xe2\x80\x9cGoing where?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Dirk. The\r\nGeneral, too, appeared bewildered.\r\n\r\nRoelf explained, delightedly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a plot. We\xe2\x80\x99re all going to drive out\r\nto your mother\xe2\x80\x99s. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? You simply must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo?\xe2\x80\x9d now put in General Goguet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it that we go? I thought we\r\nstayed here, quietly. It is quiet here, and no reception committees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHis tone was wistful.\r\n\r\nRoelf attempted to make it clear. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. DeJong\xe2\x80\x99s mother is a farmer. You\r\nremember I told you all about her in the ship coming over. She was\r\nwonderful to me when I was a kid. She was the first person to tell me\r\nwhat beauty was\xe2\x80\x94is. She\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent. She raises vegetables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! A farm! But yes! I, too, am a farmer. Well!\xe2\x80\x9d He shook Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nagain. He appeared now for the first time to find him interesting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. Does Mother know you\xe2\x80\x99re coming? She has been hoping\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d see you but she thought you\xe2\x80\x99d grown so grand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait until I tell her about the day I landed in Paris with five francs\r\nin my pocket. No, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know we\xe2\x80\x99re coming, but she\xe2\x80\x99ll be there,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t she? I\xe2\x80\x99ve a feeling she\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, exactly the same. She will,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be there.\xe2\x80\x9d It was early spring; the busiest of seasons on the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nDallas emerged in greatcoat and a new spring hat. She waved a hand to\r\nthe faithful Gilda Hanan. \xe2\x80\x9cTell any one who inquires for me that I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nfelt the call of spring. And if the boy comes for that clay pack picture\r\ntell him to-morrow was the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were down the stairs and off in the powerful car that seemed to be\r\nat the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 disposal. Through the Loop, up Michigan Avenue, into\r\nthe south side. Chicago, often lowering and gray in April, was wearing\r\ngold and blue to-day. The air was sharp but beneath the brusqueness of\r\nit was a gentle promise. Dallas and Pool were very much absorbed in\r\nParis plans, Paris reminiscences. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you remember the time we . . .\r\nonly seven francs among the lot of us and the dinner was . . . you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsurely coming over in June, then . . . oils . . . you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the thing,\r\nI tell you . . . you\xe2\x80\x99ll be great, Dallas . . . remember what Vibray said\r\n. . . study . . . work . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk was wretched. He pointed out objects of interest to General Goguet.\r\nSixty miles of boulevard. Park system. Finest in the country. Grand\r\nBoulevard. Drexel Boulevard. Jackson Park. Illinois Central trains.\r\nTerrible, yes, but they were electrifying. Going to make \xe2\x80\x99em run by\r\nelectricity, you know. Things wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look so dirty, after that.\r\nHalsted Street. Longest street in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the General, politely. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes. Quite so. Most\r\ninteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rich black loam of High Prairie. A hint of fresh green things just\r\npeeping out of the earth. Hothouses. Coldframes. The farm.\r\n\r\nIt looked very trim and neat. The house, white with green shutters\r\n(Selina\xe2\x80\x99s dream realized), smiled at them from among the willows that\r\nwere already burgeoning hazily under the wooing of a mild and early\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you said it was a small farm!\xe2\x80\x9d said General Goguet, as\r\nthey descended from the car. He looked about at the acreage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is small,\xe2\x80\x9d Dirk assured him. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly about forty acres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, you Americans. In France we farm on a very small scale, you\r\nunderstand. We have not the land. The great vast country.\xe2\x80\x9d He waved his\r\nright arm. You felt that if the left sleeve had not been empty he would\r\nhave made a large and sweeping gesture with both arms.\r\n\r\nSelina was not in the neat quiet house. She was not on the porch, or in\r\nthe yard. Meena Bras, phlegmatic and unflustered, came in from the\r\nkitchen. Mis\xe2\x80\x99 DeJong was in the fields. She would call her. This she\r\nproceeded to do by blowing three powerful blasts and again three on a\r\nhorn which she took from a hook on the wall. She stood in the kitchen\r\ndoorway facing the fields, blowing, her red cheeks puffed outrageously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat brings her,\xe2\x80\x9d Meena assured them; and went back to her work. They\r\ncame out on the porch to await Selina. She was out on the west\r\nsixteen\xe2\x80\x94the west sixteen that used to be unprolific, half-drowned\r\nmuckland. Dirk felt a little uneasy, and ashamed that he should feel so.\r\n\r\nThen they saw her coming, a small dark figure against the background of\r\nsun and sky and fields. She came swiftly yet ploddingly, for the ground\r\nwas heavy. They stood facing her, the four of them. As she came nearer\r\nthey saw that she was wearing a dark skirt pinned up about her ankles to\r\nprotect it from the wet spring earth and yet it was spattered with a\r\nborder of mud spots. A rough heavy gray sweater was buttoned closely\r\nabout the straight slim body. On her head was a battered soft black hat.\r\nHer feet, in broad-toed sensible boots, she lifted high out of the soft\r\nclinging soil. As she came nearer she took off her hat and holding it a\r\nlittle to one side against the sun, shaded her eyes with it. Her hair\r\nblew a little in the gentle spring breeze. Her cheeks were faintly pink.\r\nShe was coming up the path now. She could distinguish their faces. She\r\nsaw Dirk; smiled, waved. Her glance went inquiringly to the others\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nbearded man in uniform, the tall girl, the man with the dark vivid face.\r\nThen she stopped, suddenly, and her hand went to her heart as though she\r\nhad felt a great pang, and her lips were parted, and her eyes enormous.\r\nAs Roelf came forward swiftly she took a few quick running steps toward\r\nhim like a young girl. He took the slight figure in the mud-spattered\r\nskirt, the rough gray sweater, and the battered old hat into his arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had had tea in the farm sitting room and Dallas had made a little\r\nmoaning over the beauty of the Dutch lustre set. Selina had entertained\r\nthem with the shining air of one who is robed in silk and fine linen.\r\nShe and General Goguet had got on famously from the start, meeting on\r\nthe common ground of asparagus culture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how thick?\xe2\x80\x9d he had demanded, for he, too, had his pet asparagus\r\nbeds on the farm in Brittany. \xe2\x80\x9cHow thick at the base?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina made a circle with thumb and forefinger. The General groaned with\r\nenvy and despair. He was very comfortable, the General. He partook\r\nlargely of tea and cakes. He flattered Selina with his eyes. She\r\nactually dimpled, flushed, laughed like a girl. But it was to Roelf she\r\nturned; it was on Roelf that her eyes dwelt and rested. It was with him\r\nshe walked when she was silent and the others talked. It was as though\r\nhe were her one son, and had come home. Her face was radiant, beautiful.\r\n\r\nSeated next to Dirk, Dallas said, in a low voice: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nmean. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean when I say I want to do portraits. Not\r\nportraits of ladies with a string of pearls and one lily hand half\r\nhidden in the folds of a satin skirt. I mean character portraits of men\r\nand women who are really distinguished looking\xe2\x80\x94distinguishedly\r\nAmerican, for example\xe2\x80\x94like your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk looked up at her quickly, half smiling, as though expecting to find\r\nher smiling, too. But she was not smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if she\xe2\x80\x99d let me. With that fine splendid face all lit up with the\r\nlight that comes from inside; and the jaw-line like that of the women\r\nwho came over in the _Mayflower_; or crossed the continent in a covered\r\nwagon; and her eyes! And that battered funny gorgeous bum old hat and\r\nthe white shirtwaist\xe2\x80\x94and her hands! She\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. She\xe2\x80\x99d make me\r\nfamous at one leap. You\xe2\x80\x99d see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirk stared at her. It was as though he could not comprehend. Then he\r\nturned in his chair to stare at his mother. Selina was talking to Roelf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve done all the famous men of Europe, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you, Roelf! To\r\nthink of it! You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the world, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it in your hand.\r\nLittle Roelf Pool. And you did it all alone. In spite of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoelf leaned toward her. He put his hand over her rough one. \xe2\x80\x9cCabbages\r\nare beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Then they both laughed as at some exquisite\r\njoke. Then, seriously: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine life you\xe2\x80\x99ve had, too, Selina. A full\r\nlife, and a rich one and successful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Selina. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Roelf, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here all these years, just\r\nwhere you left me when you were a boy. I think the very hat and dress\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m wearing might be the same I wore then. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been nowhere, done\r\nnothing, seen nothing. When I think of all the places I was going to\r\nsee! All the things I was going to do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been everywhere in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roelf. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all the\r\nplaces of great beauty and light. You remember you told me that your\r\nfather had once said, when you were a little girl, that there were only\r\ntwo kinds of people who really mattered in the world. One kind was wheat\r\nand the other kind emeralds. You\xe2\x80\x99re wheat, Selina.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re emerald,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, quickly.\r\n\r\nThe General was interested but uncomprehending. He glanced now at the\r\nwatch on his wrist and gave a little exclamation. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the dinner! Our\r\nhostess, Madame Storm! It is very fine to run away but one must come\r\nback. Our so beautiful hostess.\xe2\x80\x9d He had sprung to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is beautiful, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Roelf replied, abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mouth is smaller than the eyes. With\r\nMrs. Storm from here to here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he illustrated by turning to Dallas,\r\ntouching her lips, her eyes, lightly with his slender powerful brown\r\nfingers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis smaller than from here to here. When the mouth is smaller\r\nthan the eyes there is no real beauty. Now Dallas here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, me,\xe2\x80\x9d scoffed Dallas, all agrin. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a grand mouth for you. If\r\na large mouth is your notion of beauty then I must look like Helen of\r\nTroy to you, Roelf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roelf, simply.\r\n\r\nInside Dirk something was saying, over and over, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re nothing but a\r\nrubber stamp, Dirk DeJong. You\xe2\x80\x99re nothing but a rubber stamp.\xe2\x80\x9d Over and\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese dinners!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the General. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish to seem\r\nungracious, but these dinners! Much rather would I remain here on this\r\nquiet and beautiful farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the porch steps he turned, brought his heels together with a sharp\r\nsmack, bent from the waist, picked up Selina\xe2\x80\x99s rough work-worn hand and\r\nkissed it. And then, as she smiled a little, uncertainly, her left hand\r\nat her breast, her cheeks pink, Roelf, too, kissed her hand tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selina, and laughed a soft tremulous little laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never had my hand kissed before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood on the porch steps and waved at them as they were whirled\r\nswiftly away, the four of them. A slight straight little figure in the\r\nplain white blouse and the skirt spattered with the soil of the farm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come out again?\xe2\x80\x9d she had said to Dallas. And Dallas had said\r\nyes, but that she was leaving soon for Paris, to study and work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I come back you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me do your portrait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My_ portrait!\xe2\x80\x9d Selina had exclaimed, wonderingly.\r\n\r\nNow as the four were whirled back to Chicago over the asphalted Halsted\r\nroad they were relaxed, a little tired. They yielded to the narcotic of\r\nspring that was in the air.\r\n\r\nRoelf Pool took off his hat. In the cruel spring sunshine you saw that\r\nthe black hair was sprinkled with gray. \xe2\x80\x9cOn days like this I refuse to\r\nbelieve that I\xe2\x80\x99m forty-five. Dallas, tell me I\xe2\x80\x99m not forty-five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not forty-five,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dallas in her leisurely caressing voice.\r\n\r\nRoelf\xe2\x80\x99s lean brown hand reached over frankly and clasped her strong\r\nwhite one. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you say it like that, Dallas, it sounds true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dallas.\r\n\r\nThey dropped Dallas first at the shabby old Ontario Street studio, then\r\nDirk at his smart little apartment, and went on.\r\n\r\nDirk turned his key in the lock. Saki, the Japanese houseman, slid\r\nsilently into the hall making little hissing noises of greeting. On the\r\ncorrect little console in the hall there was a correct little pile of\r\nletters and invitations. He went through the Italian living room and\r\ninto his bedroom. The Jap followed him. Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s correct evening clothes\r\n(made by Peel the English tailor on Michigan Boulevard) were laid\r\ncorrectly on his bed\xe2\x80\x94trousers, vest, shirt, coat; fine, immaculate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMessages, Saki?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissy Stlom telephone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh. Leave any message?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Say s\xe2\x80\x99e call \xe2\x80\x99gain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Saki.\xe2\x80\x9d He waved him away and out of the room. The man went\r\nand closed the door softly behind him as a correct Jap servant should.\r\nDirk took off his coat, his vest, threw them on a chair near the bed. He\r\nstood at the bedside looking down at his Peel evening clothes, at the\r\nglossy shirtfront that never bulged. A bath, he thought, dully,\r\nautomatically. Then, quite suddenly, he flung himself on the fine\r\nsilk-covered bed, face down, and lay there, his head in his arms, very\r\nstill. He was lying there half an hour later when he heard the\r\ntelephone\xe2\x80\x99s shrill insistence and Saki\xe2\x80\x99s gentle deferential rap at the\r\nbedroom door.\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EDNA FERBER\r\n                          BY ROGERS DICKINSON\r\n\r\n\r\nEdna Ferber is an arresting personality. In speech, in appearance, and\r\nin manner she stands out clear against the mass.\r\n\r\nAnyone who really knows her realizes why her stories, both long and\r\nshort, reach the understanding and touch the hearts of the readers. One\r\nis very likely to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I know somebody like that,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI knew she\r\nwould do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knows folks, all sorts of people, but she is interested chiefly in\r\npeople who do things: not the men who run great corporations and control\r\nthe destinies of thousands of men and women, but the men and women who\r\nhave jobs, and under that classification come that vast number who run\r\nmodest households, who struggle to bring up children, who, in fact, form\r\nthe permanent solid stratum on which our society is built.\r\n\r\nShe has the large-minded sympathy that makes for understanding of the\r\nunder dog. She will take French lessons, not only because she wants to\r\nstudy the language, but because a cultivated Frenchman needs money and\r\nwill not accept charity.\r\n\r\nEdna Ferber enjoys a talk with a washwoman and the woman enjoys the talk\r\ntoo. Her colored maid adores her\xe2\x80\x94and imposes on her (as is the way with\r\ncolored maids).\r\n\r\nShe hates pretension and is very likely to speak her mind not only to\r\nher intimates but straight to the face of the objectionable person.\r\nSometimes she speaks more strongly than she should, for she is impulsive\r\nand quick-tempered, but no one is more generous than she in the\r\nacknowledgment of mistakes.\r\n\r\nHer letters are characteristic. They just begin. No salutation, no\r\nsparring for an opening\xe2\x80\x94they begin at the beginning and when she is\r\nthrough she stops. She just adds her initials.\r\n\r\nShe stands on her own small feet. If you say to her, \xe2\x80\x9cThe mantle of O.\r\nHenry has fallen on your shoulders\xe2\x80\x9d (it has been said with complimentary\r\nintent), you will get a flash from her black eyes that will scorch you\r\nand a rush of words that will make you wish you were elsewhere. She does\r\nnot want anyone\xe2\x80\x99s else mantle or footgear for that matter\xe2\x80\x94she is\r\nherself, Edna Ferber.\r\n\r\nHer earlier picturesque, sometimes flippant style, the surprise\r\nclimaxes, and the short pithy sentences, come from her newspaper\r\nexperience and not from any influence of O. Henry. The newspaper\r\neditor\xe2\x80\x99s command is to \xe2\x80\x9ctell the story and make it snappy,\xe2\x80\x9d and it has\r\naffected Edna Ferber\xe2\x80\x99s style, as it has affected the work of many other\r\nwriters who grew out of newspaper offices.\r\n\r\nHer style has changed as all thoughtful readers must have noticed. The\r\nliterary form of the Emma McChesney stories is quite different from that\r\nof the stories in \xe2\x80\x9cCheerful by Request\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGigolo.\xe2\x80\x9d Read a story in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoast Beef Medium\xe2\x80\x9d and then read \xe2\x80\x9cOld Man Minick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is a depth and richness, a dignity and soundness, that the earlier\r\nworks lacked. Yet there is no loss of strength and vital freshness in\r\nher later books.\r\n\r\nThere is a vitality about Edna Ferber that is recognizable the moment\r\nshe comes into a room. She enters almost with a rush, with a quick, firm\r\nstep; though she is short, scarcely more than five feet three, I should\r\nthink, she dominates most groups. Her rather large head with its thick\r\nblack hair, cropped so one may see the admirable shape of the skull, is\r\nheld erect. She greets one with a cordiality that is sometimes disarming\r\nand she speaks with a curious drawl that seems quite out of character\r\nwith her forthright nature. What she says is worth listening to, for\r\neven the most commonplace occasions bring forth unbromidic speech from\r\nEdna Ferber.\r\n\r\nAs she talks in private conversation so she talks in public. She is a\r\ngood speech-maker, a good lecturer. Her spoken words have the pungent\r\nvitality of her writing and the reading of her own stories makes the\r\ncharacters come alive startlingly.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange to those of us who do not make our own living by\r\ncreative writing that a woman who has made her mark as a reporter and\r\nwho still occasionally reports a national convention, finds it so hard\r\nto write fiction. Edna Ferber has written for newspapers about all sorts\r\nof things under every sort of difficult handicap of time and place, and\r\nhas produced good \xe2\x80\x9ccopy.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet her short stories, novels and plays, are\r\nslowly and laboriously produced. And when the job is done, so closely\r\nhas she held her nose to the grindstone, that she is unable to perceive\r\nthe work as a whole, and realize how good it is.\r\n\r\nShe once rented an apartment on the lake front in Chicago, her desk\r\nfacing the blue waters. She was in the midst of her novel, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe complained that she could not get on with it, it was hard labor, so\r\nhard that in spite of her best efforts she would look at the lake and\r\nthe trees and the children playing in the street below. Her anxious\r\npublisher besought her to turn her typewriter table so she faced the\r\nblank wall. She did; and the book was speedily born.\r\n\r\nIn an article in _The American Magazine_, under the characteristic title\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cThe Joy of the Job,\xe2\x80\x9d she tells of her methods of work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the risk of being hated I wanted to state that I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt\r\nsorry for any woman who could play whenever she wanted to. She never\r\nwill know how sweet play can be. Chocolate is no treat for a girl in a\r\ncandy factory. Play is no treat for an idler. My work is such that\r\nmorning engagements and festive luncheoning are forbidden. On those rare\r\noccasions, two or three times a year, perhaps, when I deliberately, and\r\nfor the good of my soul, break the rule and sneak off down-town for\r\nluncheon, the affair takes on the proportions of an orgy. No college\r\ngirls\xe2\x80\x99 midnight fudge spree could be more thrilling. To my unaccustomed\r\neyes the girls in their new hats all look pretty. The matrons appear\r\namazingly well dressed. The men, chatting over their after-luncheon\r\ncigarettes, are captains of finance, discussing problems of national\r\nimport. I refuse to believe what my _vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_ says about their being\r\ncloak-and-suit salesmen whose conversation probably runs thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I come into his place at ten this morning and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at my\r\nstuff till twelve, and finally I goes up to him, and I says to him, I\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cLooka here, Marx.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very waiters interest me. The \xe2\x80\x99bus boys are deft, and I refuse to\r\nbe bothered by their finger nails. The chicken salad is a poem, the\r\ncoffee a dream, the French pastry a divine concoction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you work three hundred and fifty mornings in the year, a game of\r\ngolf on the three hundred and fifty-first is a lark. That\xe2\x80\x99s one reason\r\nwhy I play so atrociously, I suppose. They who say that work hardens\r\none, or wearies, or dulls, have chosen the wrong occupation, or have\r\nnever really tasted the delights of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the finest freshener in the\r\nworld. It\xe2\x80\x99s an appetizer. It\xe2\x80\x99s a combination cocktail and _hors\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99\xc5\x93uvre_, to be taken before playing. It gives color to the most\r\ncommonplace of holidays. It makes a run through the park a treat.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s very little thrill in a brisk walk if you can brisk-walk from\r\nmorning until night. But after having sat before a typewriter, or desk,\r\nor table, for hours together, to be able to stretch one\xe2\x80\x99s legs for a\r\nswing of two or three miles\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s living.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe entire output of my particular job depends upon me. By that I mean\r\nthat when I put the cover on my typewriter the works are closed. The\r\noffice equipment consists of one flat table, rather messy; one\r\ntypewriter, much abused, and one typewriter table; a chunk of yellow\r\ncopy paper, and one of white. All the wheels, belts, wires, bolts,\r\nfiles, tools\xe2\x80\x94the whole manufacturing scheme of things\xe2\x80\x94has got to be\r\ncontained in the space between my chin and my topmost hairpin. And my\r\none horror, my nightmare of nightmares, is that some morning I\xe2\x80\x99ll wake\r\nup and find that space vacant, and the works closed down, with a mental\r\nsign over the front door reading:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98For Rent. Fine, large empty head. Inquire within.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was one year when there was a sign reading, \xe2\x80\x98Closed for repairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe horror of it is still with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn another place she says: \xe2\x80\x9cNo autobiographical sketch is complete\r\nwithout a statement of ambitions. I have two. I want to be allowed to\r\nsit in a rocking chair on the curb at the corner of State and Madison\r\nstreets and watch the folks go by. And I would fain live on a houseboat\r\nin the Vale of Cashmere. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the Vale of Cashmere is, nor\r\nwhether it boasts a water course or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat a lot she would get out of her view of life from a rocking chair at\r\nState and Madison streets!\r\n\r\nShe complained bitterly once that a certain writer, now opulent and\r\nlazy, who knew Chicago from the stockyards to the North Shore, did not\r\nuse the stuff he had in his head. She felt not so much that he was\r\nmissing an opportunity, but that he had buried the talent of experience\r\nthat should have been passed on to others after he had gone.\r\n\r\nThough Edna Ferber lives in New York\xe2\x80\x94her apartment faces Central\r\nPark\xe2\x80\x94she is not of New York. She knows Chicago, she thinks Chicago,\r\njust as Booth Tarkington thinks and knows Indianapolis and would not\r\nlive wholly away from it. The author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Girls,\xe2\x80\x9d that masterpiece of\r\nChicago, frequently visits the Windy City and sits, metaphorically, at\r\nthe corner of State and Madison and soaks in the spirit of the city,\r\nthat city so recently a pioneer town, so lately an effete city. No\r\nwonder she finds it fascinating and inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nEdna Ferber\xe2\x80\x99s apartment is the place where she meets her friends,\r\nbreakfasts, lunches, dines, and sleeps. It is her rest house, her\r\nrelaxation. The furnishing of it was an adventure. The choosing of\r\ndraperies for the windows (there are many facing east), the tints for\r\nthe walls, and the fabrics for the upholstery, she found an exhilarating\r\nventure into the unknown. She has been a hotel dweller, a renter of the\r\nhomes of other people. But here she is rioting in her own home with her\r\nown furniture and hers is the sole responsibility for the color scheme,\r\nthe style, and the composition. And it is good. Her taste in furnishing\r\nas in writing is to be relied upon. It is also most comfortable, too\r\ncomfortable. It would be hard enough to break away from this interesting\r\nwoman if one were standing talking in a windy street, but when\r\nsurrounded by all the comforts it is almost impossible not to overstay\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s welcome.\r\n\r\nBut she works in a bare studio, close by, away from the telephone and\r\ntoo friendly visitors. Every morning she sits down at the typewriter and\r\nworks\xe2\x80\x94and most afternoons. No writer produces good work without\r\nwearying effort, long hours of concentration, and at times great\r\ndiscouragement.\r\n\r\nWhat Miss Ferber wears while she works, whether dress, sweater, or\r\nsmock, I do not know, for she does not do her writing in public as a\r\nprize fighter trains for a battle. Her battles are fought out alone.\r\n\r\nOne of her old and understanding friends, William Allen White, has\r\nwritten a most illuminating account of her life, her struggles, and her\r\nachievement. Mr. White being a Middle Westerner himself, quite\r\nunderstands Edna Ferber\xe2\x80\x99s point of view. The following extract is taken\r\nfrom an introduction by the famous editor of the _Emporia Gazette_ for\r\nan edition of \xe2\x80\x9cCheerful by Request\xe2\x80\x9d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdna Ferber\xe2\x80\x99s pasture is long and narrow geographically; ranging from a\r\nthin pennant running westward to the mountains, to a slim tatter as far\r\neast as Vienna. But it is close clipped around Chicago, in Illinois,\r\nMinnesota, and Wisconsin; and well cropped in and about New York. In its\r\nsocial boundaries her field is more compact; chiefly lying in the middle\r\nclass, sometimes taking in those who are just climbing out of poverty,\r\nand often considering those who are happily wiggling into our\r\nplutocracy. But one thread will string every character she ever\r\nconceived; all her people do something for a living. She is the goddess\r\nof the worker. And from her typewriter keys spring hard-working bankers,\r\nmerchants, burglars, garage-helpers, stenographers, actors, traveling\r\nsalesmen, hotel clerks, porters and reporters, wholesalers, pushcart\r\nmen, wine touts, welfare workers, farmers, writers\xe2\x80\x94always doers of\r\nthings: money makers, men and women who pull their weight in the boat.\r\nAnd her stories chiefly tell what a fine time these hardworking\r\nAmericans have with their day\xe2\x80\x99s work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Great American Short Story, which must tell of American life\r\nrather than our Great American Novel, Edna Ferber\xe2\x80\x99s section will be\r\namong the workers. Mrs. Wharton and Henry Fuller and Sherwood Anderson\r\ncan have the loafers, in high life and low life. But Miss Ferber\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npeople will come from the stores and offices and workshops. They will,\r\nas the Gospel Hymn has it, come rejoicing, bringing home the bacon.\r\nTheir dramatic moments are oftenest in aprons, shirt-sleeves, overalls,\r\nat desks, behind counters, in kitchens, behind stage curtains, in the\r\nmidst of the business of earning a living. Precious little is done in\r\nthe Ferber stories \xe2\x80\x98in God\xe2\x80\x99s great out of doors\xe2\x80\x94in the wide open\r\nspaces.\xe2\x80\x99 When anything has to be open in Miss Ferber\xe2\x80\x99s work it is a\r\nlively and festive wide-open town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo let us consider who she is and how she happened to be a writing\r\nwoman. In the middle or late \xe2\x80\x99eighties of the nineteenth century she was\r\nborn in Kalamazoo, Michigan, of Jewish parents. Her father was a\r\nHungarian. Her mother an American, born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her\r\nfather was the owner of a general merchandise store, first in Iowa, then\r\nin Appleton, Wisconsin. Miss Ferber at seventeen was graduated from the\r\nRyan High School in Appleton. For her graduating essay she wrote an\r\naccount of the life of the women workers in a local mill. The local\r\neditor saw it: recognized that it was good reporting and gave her a job\r\nas local reporter at $3.00 a week\xe2\x80\x94a rather princely salary twenty years\r\nago for a new girl reporter in a country town. She wrote local items,\r\nfrom the court house, the city hall, the fire department, the home of\r\nthe village Cr\xc5\x93sus, and the police court. Then she was graduated from\r\nthe Appleton paper to Milwaukee. In Milwaukee also she was a reporter.\r\nAnd while she was earning a living as a reporter she wrote \xe2\x80\x98Dawn\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Hara,\xe2\x80\x99 her first novel. It sold well. While it was in the press and\r\nselling during 1911 and \xe2\x80\x9912, the magazines began telling the story of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Emma McChesney.\xe2\x80\x99 Here was something new; the traveling saleswoman\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nwas rather more woman than merchant, but who was altogether human. The\r\ncharacter appealed to the public, and Edna Ferber had her knee in the\r\ndoor of success. In 1913 the stories were collected under the title\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Roast Beef Medium,\xe2\x80\x99 and that book sold well. Two years later appeared\r\nmore McChesney stories under the title \xe2\x80\x98Emma McChesney & Co.\xe2\x80\x99 Then came\r\nthe play \xe2\x80\x98Emma McChesney,\xe2\x80\x99 and Edna Ferber was well in the ante-room of\r\nthe hall of fame, with her card going to posterity. In the meantime, a\r\nbook of short stories, \xe2\x80\x98Buttered Side Down,\xe2\x80\x99 had been written and sold\r\nto the magazines and successfully published. In 1917 Miss Ferber\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsecond novel appeared, \xe2\x80\x98Fanny, Herself,\xe2\x80\x99 and in 1918 came \xe2\x80\x98Cheerful by\r\nRequest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn 1922 all the promise of ten years of conscientious work was\r\nfulfilled, when Miss Ferber wrote \xe2\x80\x98The Girls,\xe2\x80\x99 a novel of Chicago. The\r\nhumor of it, the strength of it, the art of it, must make posterity give\r\nmore than a glance at Edna Ferber\xe2\x80\x99s card. She has something to tell\r\nposterity about America.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so we must tell posterity something about her\xe2\x80\x94about Edna Ferber,\r\nherself. The best description of her family life ever written, she wrote\r\nin the dedication of \xe2\x80\x98Dawn O\xe2\x80\x99Hara,\xe2\x80\x99 to Julia Ferber, her \xe2\x80\x98dear mother\r\nwho frequently interrupts, and to Sister Fannie who says Sh-Sh-Sh-\r\noutside my door.\xe2\x80\x99 Some shadowy hint of the life of the Ferbers after the\r\nhusband and father died, and before the family moved to Chicago, may be\r\nfound in the earlier chapters of \xe2\x80\x98Fanny, Herself\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94at least it is a good\r\npicture of Julia Ferber, the mother, a strong, devoted, capable woman\r\nwho is a credit to her country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll around Edna Ferber is an atmosphere of work. She works hard and all\r\nthe time. Her friends work hard, and all the time. So when she takes her\r\ntypewriter in hand to tell of the world she knows, she describes a\r\nworking world. It is a world deeply American. For whatever else we\r\nAmericans are, we are workers. Here and there a man lives without work,\r\na white rich man\xe2\x80\x99s son or a black washerwoman\xe2\x80\x99s son. We have no leisure\r\nclasses. But the world of Edna Ferber\xe2\x80\x99s people in its economic status is\r\nthe real world of America. And she, a working woman, is typical of the\r\nmodern American woman. If for any reason posterity is interested in this\r\nAmerican world of the first three decades of the twentieth century,\r\nposterity will do well\xe2\x80\x94indeed posterity probably can do no better than\r\nto tell the butler to bring Edna Ferber for a few moments and let her\r\nread \xe2\x80\x98The Gay Old Dog,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98The Eldest.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSince Mr. White wrote the foregoing, Edna Ferber has made two big steps\r\nforward. In the volume, \xe2\x80\x9cGigolo,\xe2\x80\x9d is to be found that masterpiece, \xe2\x80\x9cOld\r\nMan Minick,\xe2\x80\x9d to mention but one of a group of eight. The play from this\r\nstory, written by her in collaboration with George S. Kaufman, has\r\nbecome an artistic and a financial success. The story, \xe2\x80\x9cOld Man Minick,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ntogether with the play, \xe2\x80\x9cMinick,\xe2\x80\x9d have been published in a separate\r\nvolume, so one can see how a short story can be turned into a successful\r\nplay. It is interesting to compare the fictional use of an idea with the\r\ndramatic, especially when the work is done by the same hand.\r\n\r\nEdna Ferber has always been interested in plays and play-writing. She\r\nhas written three that I know of, and two have been highly successful.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c$1,200 a Year,\xe2\x80\x9d written with Newman Levy, deserved a greater success\r\nthan it won. As a piece of literature it deserves more than one\r\nrereading.\r\n\r\nOf course \xe2\x80\x9cSo Big\xe2\x80\x9d has done more to interest people in Edna Ferber than\r\nanything else, yet the quality that has made such a success of that book\r\nlies also in most of her earlier work. That she herself was not too sure\r\nabout it is made clear in an interview, titled \xe2\x80\x9cHow it Feels to be a\r\nBest Seller\xe2\x80\x9d:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are people who write Best Sellers as a matter of business. That\r\nis, they are in the Best Seller business. They write them, I am told,\r\ndeliberately and mathematically, using a formula as a cook uses a\r\nrecipe. You hear a name and you say, in your ignorance, \xe2\x80\x98Who? . . .\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s he?\xe2\x80\x99 And the answer is, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s Whosis. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever read him! He writes Best Sellers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they do it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know. I suppose they have\r\nsome peculiar thermometer or mechanism by which they gauge that fickle\r\nphenomenon known as the public pulse. But occasionally some one comes\r\nalong who commits a Best Seller in all innocence, and with no such\r\nintent. Of such am I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot only did I not plan to write a Best Seller when I wrote \xe2\x80\x98So Big\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbut I thought, when I had finished it, that I had written the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworst seller. Not that alone, I thought I had written a complete\r\nNon-Seller. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone would ever read it. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nliteral truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was this way. I had worked on it, day after day, day after day, for\r\nmany months, starting at nine each morning and working until four in the\r\nafternoon. I knew where I was going and why I wanted to get there, but\r\nafter a time I became like a patient plodder who must travel weary miles\r\nalong a lonely road before he arrives at the city of his destination.\r\nMile after mile I covered the distance, sometimes traveling fairly\r\nswiftly, sometimes scarcely able to lift one tired foot after the other.\r\nWhen it was finished I was so dulled by contact with it that I scarcely\r\ncould see it. The last stretch of the work, during June and July, had\r\nbeen written in Chicago. That June and July in Chicago I recall as a\r\nperiod during which the thermometer hovered gracefully between 90 and 96\r\nin the shade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the work of final correction began and progressed I began to dole\r\nout sheaves of copy to the typist. She used to call for a chunk of the\r\nstory every day or two. She would appear at about four in the afternoon\r\nwhen I had finished work for the day, and when I was at my limpest,\r\ndampest and lowest. I remember her as a nice fresh-looking red-haired\r\ngirl in crisp cool orchid organdie. She would make four copies of each\r\nfresh sheaf as she received it, return these, and call for more. No\r\nother soul except myself had seen a line of that story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEach time she called I waited eagerly, hopefully, for her to make some\r\ncomment. I wanted her to say she liked Selina. I wanted her to say she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t care for Dirk. I wanted her to say she thought the story should\r\nhave ended this way, or that. I wanted her to evince some interest in\r\nthe novel; to show some liking for it, or even to show dislike. She\r\nnever did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said I to Miss E. Ferber, \xe2\x80\x98that settles it. There you are,\r\nEdna! I told you so! Who would be interested in a novel about a\r\nmiddle-aged woman in a calico dress and with wispy hair and bad teeth,\r\ngrubbing on a little truck farm south of Chicago! Nobody. Who cares\r\nabout cabbages! Nobody. Who would read the thing if it came out as a\r\nnovel! A dull plodding book, written because I was interested; because I\r\nwanted intensely to write it; because I had carried the thought of it\r\naround in my head for five years or more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe story was to be serialized in the _Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Home Companion_ before\r\nbeing published in novel form. Well, that was all right. It might go\r\nwell enough as a serial. But as a novel! Never.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote Mr. Russell Doubleday, of Doubleday, Page & Company, telling\r\nhim that I had finished the book but that it was not, in my opinion, a\r\nbook that would sell. No one, I wrote him, would read it. I thought it\r\nwould be better for his firm, as publishers, and for me, as author, if\r\nwe gave up the idea of publishing this story as a novel. It would be a\r\nflat failure, receiving bad reviews, having no sale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Doubleday replied that I might be right, but that perhaps I should\r\nlet some one besides myself have a chance to judge its merits and\r\nfaults. Perhaps, he said, I had been too close to it. Would I let him\r\nread it before deciding against it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe read it. He wrote me a letter. I keep that letter to read on rainy\r\ndays when I\xe2\x80\x99m not feeling well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98So Big\xe2\x80\x99 has, for some reason I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain, been a best seller since\r\nit was published in February, selling on an average of a thousand a day.\r\nI know how the ugly duckling felt who turned into a swan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so, unlike Dirk de Jong, who thought he was so big and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, the\r\nnovel is so very big, when the author thought it of much less\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that at least seven million people read \xe2\x80\x9cSo Big\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nits serial and book form. All these people will be looking forward\r\nhopefully to her next book. That there will be no disappointment can be\r\nconfidently predicted because Edna Ferber has built upon so sure a\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nI believe that big work cannot come of small people. Edna Ferber is a\r\nbig person (not in stature nor avoirdupois) in mind, in heart, in soul,\r\nand in vision. A study of her work shows her growth and she is still\r\ngrowing, and will keep on growing as long as she lives. She will keep on\r\ngrowing because she sees so much farther than she has been able to\r\nreach. Her vision is so big.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TRANSCRIBER NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nMis-spelled words and printer errors have been fixed.\r\n\r\nInconsistency in hyphenation has been retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of So Big, by Edna Ferber\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SO BIG ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 61686-0.txt or 61686-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/1/6/8/61686/\r\n\r\nProduced by Alex White and the online Distributed\r\nProofreaders Canada team at https://www.pgdpcanada.net\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
