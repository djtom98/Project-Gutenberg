While still a medical\r\nstudent I had published a novel called _Liza of Lambeth_ which caused a\r\nmild sensation, and on the strength of that I rashly decided to abandon\r\ndoctoring and earn my living as a writer; so, as soon as I was\r\n\'qualified\', I set out for Spain and spent the best part of a year in\r\nSeville. I amused myself hugely and wrote a bad novel. Then I returned to\r\nLondon and, with a friend of my own age, took and furnished a small flat\r\nnear Victoria Station. A maid of all work cooked for us and kept the flat\r\nneat and tidy. My friend was at the Bar, and so I had the day (and the\r\nflat) to myself and my work. During the next six years I wrote several\r\nnovels and a number of plays. Only one of these novels had any success,\r\nbut even that failed to make the stir that my first one had made. I could\r\nget no manager to take my plays. At last, in desperation, I sent one,\r\nwhich I called _A Man of Honour_, to the Stage Society, which gave two\r\nperformances, one on Sunday night, another on Monday afternoon, of plays\r\nwhich, unsuitable for the commercial theatre, were considered of\r\nsufficient merit to please an intellectual audience. As every one knows,\r\nit was the Stage Society that produced the early plays of Bernard Shaw.\r\nThe committee accepted _A Man of Honour_, and W.L. Courtney, who was a\r\nmember of it, thought well enough of my crude play to publish it in _The\r\nFortnightly Review_, of which he was then editor. It was a feather in my\r\ncap.\r\n\r\nThough these efforts of mine brought me very little money, they attracted\r\nnot a little attention, and I made friends. I was looked upon as a\r\npromising young writer and, I think I may say it without vanity, was\r\naccepted as a member of the intelligentsia, an honourable condition\r\nwhich, some years later, when I became a popular writer of light\r\ncomedies, I lost; and have never since regained. I was invited to\r\nliterary parties and to parties given by women of rank and fashion who\r\nthought it behoved them to patronise the arts. An unattached and fairly\r\npresentable young man is always in demand. I lunched out and dined out.\r\nSince I could not afford to take cabs, when I dined out, in tails and a\r\nwhite tie, as was then the custom, I went and came back by bus. I was\r\nasked to spend week-ends in the country. They were something of a trial\r\non account of the tips you had to give to the butler and to the footman\r\nwho brought you your morning tea. He unpacked your gladstone bag, and\r\nyou were uneasily aware that your well-worn pyjamas and modest toilet\r\narticles had made an unfavourable impression upon him. For all that, I\r\nfound life pleasant and I enjoyed myself. There seemed no reason why I\r\nshould not go on indefinitely in the same way, bringing out a novel once\r\na year (which seldom earned more than the small advance the publisher\r\nhad given me but which was on the whole respectably reviewed), going to\r\nmore and more parties, making more and more friends. It was all very\r\nnice, but I couldn\'t see that it was leading me anywhere. I was thirty.\r\nI was in a rut. I felt I must get out of it. It did not take me long to\r\nmake up my mind. I told the friend with whom I shared the flat that I\r\nwanted to be rid of it and go abroad. He could not keep it by himself,\r\nbut we luckily found a middle-aged gentleman who wished to install his\r\nmistress in it, and was prepared to take it off our hands. We sold the\r\nfurniture for what it could fetch, and within a month I was on my way to\r\nParis. I took a room in a cheap hotel on the Left Bank.\r\n\r\nA few months before this, I had been fortunate enough to make friends\r\nwith a young painter who had a studio in the Rue Campagne Premiere. His\r\nname was Gerald Kelly. He had had an upbringing unusual for a painter,\r\nfor he had been to Eton and to Cambridge. He was highly talented,\r\nabundantly loquacious, and immensely enthusiastic. It was he who first\r\nmade me acquainted with the Impressionists, whose pictures had recently\r\nbeen accepted by the Luxembourg. To my shame, I must admit that I could\r\nnot make head or tail of them. Without much searching, I found an\r\napartment on the fifth floor of a house near the Lion de Belfort. It had\r\ntwo rooms and a kitchen, and cost seven hundred francs a year, which was\r\nthen twenty-eight pounds. I bought, second-hand, such furniture and\r\nhousehold utensils as were essential, and the _concierge_ told me of a\r\nwoman who would come in for half a day and make my _cafe au lait_ in the\r\nmorning and my luncheon at noon. I settled down and set to work on still\r\nanother novel. Soon after my arrival, Gerald Kelly took me to a\r\nrestaurant called Le Chat Blanc in the Rue d\'Odessa, near the Gare\r\nMontparnasse, where a number of artists were in the habit of dining;\r\nand from then on I dined there every night. I have described the place\r\nelsewhere, and in some detail in the novel to which these pages are meant\r\nto serve as a preface, so that I need not here say more about it. As a\r\nrule, the same people came in every night, but now and then others came,\r\nperhaps only once, perhaps two or three times. We were apt to look upon\r\nthem as interlopers, and I don\'t think we made them particularly welcome.\r\nIt was thus that I first met Arnold Bennett and Clive Bell. One of these\r\ncasual visitors was Aleister Crowley. He was spending the winter in\r\nParis. I took an immediate dislike to him, but he interested and amused\r\nme. He was a great talker and he talked uncommonly well. In early youth,\r\nI was told, he was extremely handsome, but when I knew him he had put on\r\nweight, and his hair was thinning. He had fine eyes and a way, whether\r\nnatural or acquired I do not know, of so focusing them that, when he\r\nlooked at you, he seemed to look behind you. He was a fake, but not\r\nentirely a fake. At Cambridge he had won his chess blue and was esteemed\r\nthe best whist player of his time. He was a liar and unbecomingly\r\nboastful, but the odd thing was that he had actually done some of the\r\nthings he boasted of. As a mountaineer, he had made an ascent of K2 in\r\nthe Hindu Kush, the second highest mountain in India, and he made it\r\nwithout the elaborate equipment, the cylinders of oxygen and so forth,\r\nwhich render the endeavours of the mountaineers of the present day more\r\nlikely to succeed. He did not reach the top, but got nearer to it than\r\nanyone had done before.\r\n\r\nCrowley was a voluminous writer of verse, which he published sumptuously\r\nat his own expense. He had a gift for rhyming, and his verse is not\r\nentirely without merit. He had been greatly influenced by Swinburne and\r\nRobert Browning. He was grossly, but not unintelligently, imitative. As\r\nyou flip through the pages you may well read a stanza which, if you\r\ncame across it in a volume of Swinburne\'s, you would accept without\r\nquestion as the work of the master. \'_It\'s rather hard, isn\'t it, Sir,\r\nto make sense of it?_\' If you were shown this line and asked what poet\r\nhad written it, I think you would be inclined to say, Robert Browning.\r\nYou would be wrong. It was written by Aleister Crowley.\r\n\r\nAt the time I knew him he was dabbling in Satanism, magic and the occult.\r\nThere was just then something of a vogue in Paris for that sort of thing,\r\noccasioned, I surmise, by the interest that was still taken in a book of\r\nHuysmans\'s, _La Bas_. Crowley told fantastic stories of his experiences,\r\nbut it was hard to say whether he was telling the truth or merely pulling\r\nyour leg. During that winter I saw him several times, but never after I\r\nleft Paris to return to London. Once, long afterwards, I received a\r\ntelegram from him which ran as follows: \'Please send twenty-five pounds\r\nat once. Mother of God and I starving. Aleister Crowley.\' I did not do\r\nso, and he lived on for many disgraceful years.\r\n\r\nI was glad to get back to London. My old friend had by then rooms in Pall\r\nMall, and I was able to take a bedroom in the same building and use his\r\nsitting-room to work in. _The Magician_ was published in 1908, so I\r\nsuppose it was written during the first six months of 1907. I do not\r\nremember how I came to think that Aleister Crowley might serve as the\r\nmodel for the character whom I called Oliver Haddo; nor, indeed,\r\nhow I came to think of writing that particular novel at all. When, a\r\nlittle while ago, my publisher expressed a wish to reissue it, I felt\r\nthat, before consenting to this, I really should read it again. Nearly\r\nfifty years had passed since I had done so, and I had completely\r\nforgotten it. Some authors enjoy reading their old works; some cannot\r\nbear to. Of these I am. When I have corrected the proofs of a book, I\r\nhave finished with it for good and all. I am impatient when people insist\r\non talking to me about it; I am glad if they like it, but do not much\r\ncare if they don\'t. I am no more interested in it than in a worn-out\r\nsuit of clothes that I have given away. It was thus with disinclination\r\nthat I began to read _The Magician_. It held my interest, as two of my\r\nearly novels, which for the same reason I have been obliged to read, did\r\nnot. One, indeed, I simply could not get through. Another had to my mind\r\nsome good dramatic scenes, but the humour filled me with mortification,\r\nand I should have been ashamed to see it republished. As I read _The\r\nMagician_, I wondered how on earth I could have come by all the material\r\nconcerning the black arts which I wrote of. I must have spent days and\r\ndays reading in the library of the British Museum. The style is lush and\r\nturgid, not at all the sort of style I approve of now, but perhaps not\r\nunsuited to the subject; and there are a great many more adverbs and\r\nadjectives than I should use today. I fancy I must have been impressed by\r\nthe _ecriture artiste_ which the French writers of the time had not yet\r\nentirely abandoned, and unwisely sought to imitate them.\r\n\r\nThough Aleister Crowley served, as I have said, as the model for Oliver\r\nHaddo, it is by no means a portrait of him. I made my character more\r\nstriking in appearance, more sinister and more ruthless than Crowley ever\r\nwas. I gave him magical powers that Crowley, though he claimed them,\r\ncertainly never possessed. Crowley, however, recognized himself in the\r\ncreature of my invention, for such it was, and wrote a full-page review\r\nof the novel in _Vanity Fair_, which he signed \'Oliver Haddo\'. I did not\r\nread it, and wish now that I had. I daresay it was a pretty piece of\r\nvituperation, but probably, like his poems, intolerably verbose.\r\n\r\nI do not remember what success, if any, my novel had when it was\r\npublished, and I did not bother about it much, for by then a great change\r\nhad come into my life. The manager of the Court Theatre, one Otho Stuart,\r\nhad brought out a play which failed to please, and he could not\r\nimmediately get the cast he wanted for the next play he had in mind to\r\nproduce. He had read one of mine, and formed a very poor opinion of\r\nit; but he was in a quandary, and it occurred to him that it might just\r\nserve to keep his theatre open for a few weeks, by the end of which the\r\nactors he wanted for the play he had been obliged to postpone would be at\r\nliberty. He put mine on. It was an immediate success. The result of this\r\nwas that in a very little while other managers accepted the plays they\r\nhad consistently refused, and I had four running in London at the same\r\ntime. I, who for ten years had earned an average of one hundred pounds a\r\nyear, found myself earning several hundred pounds a week. I made up my\r\nmind to abandon the writing of novels for the rest of my life. I did not\r\nknow that this was something out of my control and that when the urge to\r\nwrite a novel seized me, I should be able to do nothing but submit. Five\r\nyears later, the urge came and, refusing to write any more plays for the\r\ntime, I started upon the longest of all my novels. I called it _Of Human\r\nBondage_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Magician\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Burdon and Dr Porhoet walked in silence. They had lunched at a\r\nrestaurant in the Boulevard Saint Michel, and were sauntering now in the\r\ngardens of the Luxembourg. Dr Porhoet walked with stooping shoulders, his\r\nhands behind him. He beheld the scene with the eyes of the many painters\r\nwho have sought by means of the most charming garden in Paris to express\r\ntheir sense of beauty. The grass was scattered with the fallen leaves,\r\nbut their wan decay little served to give a touch of nature to the\r\nartifice of all besides. The trees were neatly surrounded by bushes,\r\nand the bushes by trim beds of flowers. But the trees grew without\r\nabandonment, as though conscious of the decorative scheme they helped to\r\nform. It was autumn, and some were leafless already. Many of the flowers\r\nwere withered. The formal garden reminded one of a light woman, no longer\r\nyoung, who sought, with faded finery, with powder and paint, to make a\r\nbrave show of despair. It had those false, difficult smiles of uneasy\r\ngaiety, and the pitiful graces which attempt a fascination that the\r\nhurrying years have rendered vain.\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet drew more closely round his fragile body the heavy cloak which\r\neven in summer he could not persuade himself to discard. The best part of\r\nhis life had been spent in Egypt, in the practice of medicine, and the\r\nfrigid summers of Europe scarcely warmed his blood. His memory flashed\r\nfor an instant upon those multi-coloured streets of Alexandria; and then,\r\nlike a homing bird, it flew to the green woods and the storm-beaten\r\ncoasts of his native Brittany. His brown eyes were veiled with sudden\r\nmelancholy.\r\n\r\n\'Let us wait here for a moment,\' he said.\r\n\r\nThey took two straw-bottomed chairs and sat near the octagonal water\r\nwhich completes with its fountain of Cupids the enchanting artificiality\r\nof the Luxembourg. The sun shone more kindly now, and the trees which\r\nframed the scene were golden and lovely. A balustrade of stone gracefully\r\nenclosed the space, and the flowers, freshly bedded, were very gay. In\r\none corner they could see the squat, quaint towers of Saint Sulpice, and\r\non the other side the uneven roofs of the Boulevard Saint Michel.\r\n\r\nThe palace was grey and solid. Nurses, some in the white caps of their\r\nnative province, others with the satin streamers of the _nounou_, marched\r\nsedately two by two, wheeling perambulators and talking. Brightly dressed\r\nchildren trundled hoops or whipped a stubborn top. As he watched them, Dr\r\nPorhoet\'s lips broke into a smile, and it was so tender that his thin\r\nface, sallow from long exposure to subtropical suns, was transfigured.\r\nHe no longer struck you merely as an insignificant little man with hollow\r\ncheeks and a thin grey beard; for the weariness of expression which was\r\nhabitual to him vanished before the charming sympathy of his smile. His\r\nsunken eyes glittered with a kindly but ironic good-humour. Now passed a\r\nguard in the romantic cloak of a brigand in comic opera and a peaked cap\r\nlike that of an _alguacil_. A group of telegraph boys in blue stood round\r\na painter, who was making a sketch--notwithstanding half-frozen fingers.\r\nHere and there, in baggy corduroys, tight jackets, and wide-brimmed hats,\r\nstrolled students who might have stepped from the page of Murger\'s\r\nimmortal romance. But the students now are uneasy with the fear of\r\nridicule, and more often they walk in bowler hats and the neat coats\r\nof the _boulevardier_.\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet spoke English fluently, with scarcely a trace of foreign\r\naccent, but with an elaboration which suggested that he had learned the\r\nlanguage as much from study of the English classics as from conversation.\r\n\r\n\'And how is Miss Dauncey?\' he asked, turning to his friend.\r\n\r\nArthur Burdon smiled.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I expect she\'s all right. I\'ve not seen her today, but I\'m going to\r\ntea at the studio this afternoon, and we want you to dine with us at the\r\nChien Noir.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall be much pleased. But do you not wish to be by yourselves?\'\r\n\r\n\'She met me at the station yesterday, and we dined together. We talked\r\nsteadily from half past six till midnight.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or, rather, she talked and you listened with the delighted attention of\r\na happy lover.\'\r\n\r\nArthur Burdon had just arrived in Paris. He was a surgeon on the staff of\r\nSt Luke\'s, and had come ostensibly to study the methods of the French\r\noperators; but his real object was certainly to see Margaret Dauncey. He\r\nwas furnished with introductions from London surgeons of repute, and had\r\nalready spent a morning at the Hotel Dieu, where the operator, warned\r\nthat his visitor was a bold and skilful surgeon, whose reputation in\r\nEngland was already considerable, had sought to dazzle him by feats that\r\nsavoured almost of legerdemain. Though the hint of charlatanry in the\r\nFrenchman\'s methods had not escaped Arthur Burdon\'s shrewd eyes, the\r\naudacious sureness of his hand had excited his enthusiasm. During\r\nluncheon he talked of nothing else, and Dr Porhoet, drawing upon his\r\nmemory, recounted the more extraordinary operations that he had witnessed\r\nin Egypt.\r\n\r\nHe had known Arthur Burdon ever since he was born, and indeed had missed\r\nbeing present at his birth only because the Khedive Ismail had summoned\r\nhim unexpectedly to Cairo. But the Levantine merchant who was Arthur\'s\r\nfather had been his most intimate friend, and it was with singular\r\npleasure that Dr Porhoet saw the young man, on his advice, enter his\r\nown profession and achieve a distinction which himself had never won.\r\n\r\nThough too much interested in the characters of the persons whom chance\r\nthrew in his path to have much ambition on his own behalf, it pleased him\r\nto see it in others. He observed with satisfaction the pride which Arthur\r\ntook in his calling and the determination, backed by his confidence and\r\ntalent, to become a master of his art. Dr Porhoet knew that a diversity\r\nof interests, though it adds charm to a man\'s personality, tends to\r\nweaken him. To excel one\'s fellows it is needful to be circumscribed.\r\nHe did not regret, therefore, that Arthur in many ways was narrow.\r\nLetters and the arts meant little to him. Nor would he trouble himself\r\nwith the graceful trivialities which make a man a good talker. In mixed\r\ncompany he was content to listen silently to others, and only something\r\nvery definite to say could tempt him to join in the general conversation.\r\nHe worked very hard, operating, dissecting, or lecturing at his hospital,\r\nand took pains to read every word, not only in English, but in French and\r\nGerman, which was published concerning his profession. Whenever he could\r\nsnatch a free day he spent it on the golf-links of Sunningdale, for he\r\nwas an eager and a fine player.\r\n\r\nBut at the operating-table Arthur was different. He was no longer the\r\nawkward man of social intercourse, who was sufficiently conscious of his\r\nlimitations not to talk of what he did not understand, and sincere enough\r\nnot to express admiration for what he did not like. Then, on the other\r\nhand, a singular exhilaration filled him; he was conscious of his power,\r\nand he rejoiced in it. No unforeseen accident was able to confuse him.\r\nHe seemed to have a positive instinct for operating, and his hand and\r\nhis brain worked in a manner that appeared almost automatic. He never\r\nhesitated, and he had no fear of failure. His success had been no less\r\nthan his courage, and it was plain that soon his reputation with the\r\npublic would equal that which he had already won with the profession.\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet had been making listless patterns with his stick upon the\r\ngravel, and now, with that charming smile of his, turned to Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'I never cease to be astonished at the unexpectedness of human nature,\'\r\nhe remarked. \'It is really very surprising that a man like you should\r\nfall so deeply in love with a girl like Margaret Dauncey.\'\r\n\r\nArthur made no reply, and Dr Porhoet, fearing that his words might\r\noffend, hastened to explain.\r\n\r\n\'You know as well as I do that I think her a very charming young person.\r\nShe has beauty and grace and sympathy. But your characters are more\r\ndifferent than chalk and cheese. Notwithstanding your birth in the East\r\nand your boyhood spent amid the very scenes of the Thousand and One\r\nNights, you are the most matter-of-fact creature I have ever come\r\nacross.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see no harm in your saying insular,\' smiled Arthur. \'I confess that I\r\nhave no imagination and no sense of humour. I am a plain, practical man,\r\nbut I can see to the end of my nose with extreme clearness. Fortunately\r\nit is rather a long one.\'\r\n\r\n\'One of my cherished ideas is that it is impossible to love without\r\nimagination.\'\r\n\r\nAgain Arthur Burdon made no reply, but a curious look came into his\r\neyes as he gazed in front of him. It was the look which might fill the\r\npassionate eyes of a mystic when he saw in ecstasy the Divine Lady of\r\nhis constant prayers.\r\n\r\n\'But Miss Dauncey has none of that narrowness of outlook which, if you\r\nforgive my saying so, is perhaps the secret of your strength. She has a\r\ndelightful enthusiasm for every form of art. Beauty really means as much\r\nto her as bread and butter to the more soberly-minded. And she takes a\r\npassionate interest in the variety of life.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is right that Margaret should care for beauty, since there is beauty\r\nin every inch of her,\' answered Arthur.\r\n\r\nHe was too reticent to proceed to any analysis of his feelings; but\r\nhe knew that he had cared for her first on account of the physical\r\nperfection which contrasted so astonishingly with the countless\r\ndeformities in the study of which his life was spent. But one phrase\r\nescaped him almost against his will.\r\n\r\n\'The first time I saw her I felt as though a new world had opened to my\r\nken.\'\r\n\r\nThe divine music of Keats\'s lines rang through Arthur\'s remark, and to\r\nthe Frenchman\'s mind gave his passion a romantic note that foreboded\r\nfuture tragedy. He sought to dispel the cloud which his fancy had cast\r\nupon the most satisfactory of love affairs.\r\n\r\n\'You are very lucky, my friend. Miss Margaret admires you as much as you\r\nadore her. She is never tired of listening to my prosy stories of your\r\nchildhood in Alexandria, and I\'m quite sure that she will make you the\r\nmost admirable of wives.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t be more sure than I am,\' laughed Arthur.\r\n\r\nHe looked upon himself as a happy man. He loved Margaret with all his\r\nheart, and he was confident in her great affection for him. It was\r\nimpossible that anything should arise to disturb the pleasant life\r\nwhich they had planned together. His love cast a glamour upon his\r\nwork, and his work, by contrast, made love the more entrancing.\r\n\r\n\'We\'re going to fix the date of our marriage now,\' he said. \'I\'m buying\r\nfurniture already.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think only English people could have behaved so oddly as you, in\r\npostponing your marriage without reason for two mortal years.\'\r\n\r\n\'You see, Margaret was ten when I first saw her, and only seventeen when\r\nI asked her to marry me. She thought she had reason to be grateful to me\r\nand would have married me there and then. But I knew she hankered after\r\nthese two years in Paris, and I didn\'t feel it was fair to bind her to me\r\ntill she had seen at least something of the world. And she seemed hardly\r\nready for marriage, she was growing still.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did I not say that you were a matter-of-fact young man?\' smiled Dr\r\nPorhoet.\r\n\r\n\'And it\'s not as if there had been any doubt about our knowing our minds.\r\nWe both cared, and we had a long time before us. We could afford to\r\nwait.\'\r\n\r\nAt that moment a man strolled past them, a big stout fellow, showily\r\ndressed in a check suit; and he gravely took off his hat to Dr Porhoet.\r\nThe doctor smiled and returned the salute.\r\n\r\n\'Who is your fat friend?\' asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'That is a compatriot of yours. His name is Oliver Haddo.\'\r\n\r\n\'Art-student?\' inquired Arthur, with the scornful tone he used when\r\nreferring to those whose walk in life was not so practical as his own.\r\n\r\n\'Not exactly. I met him a little while ago by chance. When I was getting\r\ntogether the material for my little book on the old alchemists I read a\r\ngreat deal at the library of the Arsenal, which, you may have heard, is\r\nsingularly rich in all works dealing with the occult sciences.\'\r\n\r\nBurden\'s face assumed an expression of amused disdain. He could not\r\nunderstand why Dr Porhoet occupied his leisure with studies so\r\nprofitless. He had read his book, recently published, on the more\r\nfamous of the alchemists; and, though forced to admire the profound\r\nknowledge upon which it was based, he could not forgive the waste of\r\ntime which his friend might have expended more usefully on topics of\r\npressing moment.\r\n\r\n\'Not many people study in that library,\' pursued the doctor, \'and I\r\nsoon knew by sight those who were frequently there. I saw this gentleman\r\nevery day. He was immersed in strange old books when I arrived early in\r\nthe morning, and he was reading them still when I left, exhausted.\r\nSometimes it happened that he had the volumes I asked for, and I\r\ndiscovered that he was studying the same subjects as myself. His\r\nappearance was extraordinary, but scarcely sympathetic; so, though I\r\nfancied that he gave me opportunities to address him, I did not avail\r\nmyself of them. One day, however, curiously enough, I was looking up\r\nsome point upon which it seemed impossible to find authorities. The\r\nlibrarian could not help me, and I had given up the search, when this\r\nperson brought me the very book I needed. I surmised that the librarian\r\nhad told him of my difficulty. I was very grateful to the stranger. We\r\nleft together that afternoon, and our kindred studies gave us a common\r\ntopic of conversation. I found that his reading was extraordinarily wide,\r\nand he was able to give me information about works which I had never\r\neven heard of. He had the advantage over me that he could apparently\r\nread, Hebrew as well as Arabic, and he had studied the Kabbalah in the\r\noriginal.\'\r\n\r\n\'And much good it did him, I have no doubt,\' said Arthur. \'And what is he\r\nby profession?\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet gave a deprecating smile.\r\n\r\n\'My dear fellow, I hardly like to tell you. I tremble in every limb at\r\nthe thought of your unmitigated scorn.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well?\'\r\n\r\n\'You know, Paris is full of queer people. It is the chosen home of every\r\nkind of eccentricity. It sounds incredible in this year of grace, but my\r\nfriend Oliver Haddo claims to be a magician. I think he is quite\r\nserious.\'\r\n\r\n\'Silly ass!\' answered Arthur with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret Dauncey shared a flat near the Boulevard du Montparnasse with\r\nSusie Boyd; and it was to meet her that Arthur had arranged to come to\r\ntea that afternoon. The young women waited for him in the studio. The\r\nkettle was boiling on the stove; cups and _petits fours_ stood in\r\nreadiness on a model stand. Susie looked forward to the meeting with\r\ninterest. She had heard a good deal of the young man, and knew that the\r\nconnexion between him and Margaret was not lacking in romance. For years\r\nSusie had led the monotonous life of a mistress in a school for young\r\nladies, and had resigned herself to its dreariness for the rest of her\r\nlife, when a legacy from a distant relation gave her sufficient income\r\nto live modestly upon her means. When Margaret, who had been her pupil,\r\ncame, soon after this, to announce her intention of spending a couple\r\nof years in Paris to study art, Susie willingly agreed to accompany\r\nher. Since then she had worked industriously at Colarossi\'s Academy,\r\nby no means under the delusion that she had talent, but merely to\r\namuse herself. She refused to surrender the pleasing notion that her\r\nenvironment was slightly wicked. After the toil of many years it relieved\r\nher to be earnest in nothing; and she found infinite satisfaction in\r\nwatching the lives of those around her.\r\n\r\nShe had a great affection for Margaret, and though her own stock of\r\nenthusiasms was run low, she could enjoy thoroughly Margaret\'s young\r\nenchantment in all that was exquisite. She was a plain woman; but there\r\nwas no envy in her, and she took the keenest pleasure in Margaret\'s\r\ncomeliness. It was almost with maternal pride that she watched each year\r\nadd a new grace to that exceeding beauty. But her common sense was sound,\r\nand she took care by good-natured banter to temper the praises which\r\nextravagant admirers at the drawing-class lavished upon the handsome girl\r\nboth for her looks and for her talent. She was proud to think that she\r\nwould hand over to Arthur Burdon a woman whose character she had helped\r\nto form, and whose loveliness she had cultivated with a delicate care.\r\n\r\nSusie knew, partly from fragments of letters which Margaret read to her,\r\npartly from her conversation, how passionately he adored his bride; and\r\nit pleased her to see that Margaret loved him in return with a grateful\r\ndevotion. The story of this visit to Paris touched her imagination.\r\nMargaret was the daughter of a country barrister, with whom Arthur had\r\nbeen in the habit of staying; and when he died, many years after his\r\nwife, Arthur found himself the girl\'s guardian and executor. He sent her\r\nto school; saw that she had everything she could possibly want; and when,\r\nat seventeen, she told him of her wish to go to Paris and learn drawing,\r\nhe at once consented. But though he never sought to assume authority over\r\nher, he suggested that she should not live alone, and it was on this\r\naccount that she went to Susie. The preparations for the journey were\r\nscarcely made when Margaret discovered by chance that her father had died\r\npenniless and she had lived ever since at Arthur\'s entire expense. When\r\nshe went to see him with tears in her eyes, and told him what she knew,\r\nArthur was so embarrassed that it was quite absurd.\r\n\r\n\'But why did you do it?\' she asked him. \'Why didn\'t you tell me?\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t think it fair to put you under any obligation to me, and I\r\nwanted you to feel quite free.\'\r\n\r\nShe cried. She couldn\'t help it.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be so silly,\' he laughed. \'You owe me nothing at all. I\'ve done\r\nvery little for you, and what I have done has given me a great deal of\r\npleasure.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know how I can ever repay you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t say that,\' he cried. \'It makes it so much harder for me to say\r\nwhat I want to.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him quickly and reddened. Her deep blue eyes were veiled\r\nwith tears.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you know that I\'d do anything in the world for you?\' she cried.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want you to be grateful to me, because I was hoping--I might ask\r\nyou to marry me some day.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret laughed charmingly as she held out her hands.\r\n\r\n\'You must know that I\'ve been wanting you to do that ever since I was\r\nten.\'\r\n\r\nShe was quite willing to give up her idea of Paris and be married without\r\ndelay, but Arthur pressed her not to change her plans. At first Margaret\r\nvowed it was impossible to go, for she knew now that she had no money,\r\nand she could not let her lover pay.\r\n\r\n\'But what does it matter?\' he said. \'It\'ll give me such pleasure to go\r\non with the small allowance I\'ve been making you. After all, I\'m pretty\r\nwell-to-do. My father left me a moderate income, and I\'m making a good\r\ndeal already by operating.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, but it\'s different now. I didn\'t know before. I thought I\r\nwas spending my own money.\'\r\n\r\n\'If I died tomorrow, every penny I have would be yours. We shall be\r\nmarried in two years, and we\'ve known one another much too long to\r\nchange our minds. I think that our lives are quite irrevocably united.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret wished very much to spend this time in Paris, and Arthur had\r\nmade up his mind that in fairness to her they could not marry till she\r\nwas nineteen. She consulted Susie Boyd, whose common sense prevented her\r\nfrom paying much heed to romantic notions of false delicacy.\r\n\r\n\'My dear, you\'d take his money without scruple if you\'d signed your\r\nnames in a church vestry, and as there\'s not the least doubt that you\'ll\r\nmarry, I don\'t see why you shouldn\'t now. Besides, you\'ve got nothing\r\nwhatever to live on, and you\'re equally unfitted to be a governess or a\r\ntypewriter. So it\'s Hobson\'s choice, and you\'d better put your exquisite\r\nsentiments in your pocket.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Boyd, by one accident after another, had never seen Arthur, but\r\nshe had heard so much that she looked upon him already as an old friend.\r\nShe admired him for his talent and strength of character as much as for\r\nhis loving tenderness to Margaret. She had seen portraits of him, but\r\nMargaret said he did not photograph well. She had asked if he was\r\ngood-looking.\r\n\r\n\'No, I don\'t think he is,\' answered Margaret, \'but he\'s very paintable.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is an answer which has the advantage of sounding well and meaning\r\nnothing,\' smiled Susie.\r\n\r\nShe believed privately that Margaret\'s passion for the arts was a not\r\nunamiable pose which would disappear when she was happily married. To\r\nhave half a dozen children was in her mind much more important than to\r\npaint pictures. Margaret\'s gift was by no means despicable, but Susie\r\nwas not convinced that callous masters would have been so enthusiastic\r\nif Margaret had been as plain and old as herself.\r\n\r\nMiss Boyd was thirty. Her busy life had not caused the years to pass\r\neasily, and she looked older. But she was one of those plain women whose\r\nplainness does not matter. A gallant Frenchman had to her face called her\r\na _belle laide_, and, far from denying the justness of his observation,\r\nshe had been almost flattered. Her mouth was large, and she had little\r\nround bright eyes. Her skin was colourless and much disfigured by\r\nfreckles. Her nose was long and thin. But her face was so kindly, her\r\nvivacity so attractive, that no one after ten minutes thought of her\r\nugliness. You noticed then that her hair, though sprinkled with white,\r\nwas pretty, and that her figure was exceedingly neat. She had good hands,\r\nvery white and admirably formed, which she waved continually in the\r\nfervour of her gesticulation. Now that her means were adequate she took\r\ngreat pains with her dress, and her clothes, though they cost much more\r\nthan she could afford, were always beautiful. Her taste was so great,\r\nher tact so sure, that she was able to make the most of herself. She\r\nwas determined that if people called her ugly they should be forced\r\nin the same breath to confess that she was perfectly gowned. Susie\'s\r\ntalent for dress was remarkable, and it was due to her influence that\r\nMargaret was arrayed always in the latest mode. The girl\'s taste inclined\r\nto be artistic, and her sense of colour was apt to run away with her\r\ndiscretion. Except for the display of Susie\'s firmness, she would\r\nscarcely have resisted her desire to wear nondescript garments of\r\nviolent hue. But the older woman expressed herself with decision.\r\n\r\n\'My dear, you won\'t draw any the worse for wearing a well-made corset,\r\nand to surround your body with bands of grey flannel will certainly not\r\nincrease your talent.\'\r\n\r\n\'But the fashion is so hideous,\' smiled Margaret.\r\n\r\n\'Fiddlesticks! The fashion is always beautiful. Last year it was\r\nbeautiful to wear a hat like a pork-pie tipped over your nose; and\r\nnext year, for all I know, it will be beautiful to wear a bonnet like\r\na sitz-bath at the back of your head. Art has nothing to do with a smart\r\nfrock, and whether a high-heeled pointed shoe commends itself or not to\r\nthe painters in the quarter, it\'s the only thing in which a woman\'s foot\r\nlooks really nice.\'\r\n\r\nSusie Boyd vowed that she would not live with Margaret at all unless she\r\nlet her see to the buying of her things.\r\n\r\n\'And when you\'re married, for heaven\'s sake ask me to stay with you four\r\ntimes a year, so that I can see after your clothes. You\'ll never keep\r\nyour husband\'s affection if you trust to your own judgment.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Boyd\'s reward had come the night before, when Margaret, coming home\r\nfrom dinner with Arthur, had repeated an observation of his.\r\n\r\n\'How beautifully you\'re dressed!\' he had said. \'I was rather afraid you\'d\r\nbe wearing art-serges.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course you didn\'t tell him that I insisted on buying every stitch\r\nyou\'d got on,\' cried Susie.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I did,\' answered Margaret simply. \'I told him I had no taste at\r\nall, but that you were responsible for everything.\'\r\n\r\n\'That was the least you could do,\' answered Miss Boyd.\r\n\r\nBut her heart went out to Margaret, for the trivial incident showed once\r\nmore how frank the girl was. She knew quite well that few of her friends,\r\nthough many took advantage of her matchless taste, would have made such\r\nan admission to the lover who congratulated them on the success of their\r\ncostume.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door, and Arthur came in.\r\n\r\n\'This is the fairy prince,\' said Margaret, bringing him to her friend.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m glad to see you in order to thank you for all you\'ve done for\r\nMargaret,\' he smiled, taking the proffered hand.\r\n\r\nSusie remarked that he looked upon her with friendliness, but with a\r\ncertain vacancy, as though too much engrossed in his beloved really to\r\nnotice anyone else; and she wondered how to make conversation with a man\r\nwho was so manifestly absorbed. While Margaret busied herself with the\r\npreparations for tea, his eyes followed her movements with a doglike,\r\ntouching devotion. They travelled from her smiling mouth to her deft\r\nhands. It seemed that he had never seen anything so ravishing as the way\r\nin which she bent over the kettle. Margaret felt that he was looking at\r\nher, and turned round. Their eyes met, and they stood for an appreciable\r\ntime gazing at one another silently.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be a pair of perfect idiots,\' cried Susie gaily. \'I\'m dying for my\r\ntea.\'\r\n\r\nThe lovers laughed and reddened. It struck Arthur that he should say\r\nsomething polite.\r\n\r\n\'I hope you\'ll show me your sketches afterwards, Miss Boyd. Margaret says\r\nthey\'re awfully good.\'\r\n\r\n\'You really needn\'t think it in the least necessary to show any interest\r\nin me,\' she replied bluntly.\r\n\r\n\'She draws the most delightful caricatures,\' said Margaret. \'I\'ll bring\r\nyou a horror of yourself, which she\'ll do the moment you leave us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be so spiteful, Margaret.\'\r\n\r\nMiss Boyd could not help thinking all the same that Arthur Burdon would\r\ncaricature very well. Margaret was right when she said that he was not\r\nhandsome, but his clean-shaven face was full of interest to so passionate\r\nan observer of her kind. The lovers were silent, and Susie had the\r\nconversation to herself. She chattered without pause and had the\r\nsatisfaction presently of capturing their attention. Arthur seemed to\r\nbecome aware of her presence, and laughed heartily at her burlesque\r\naccount of their fellow-students at Colarossi\'s. Meanwhile Susie examined\r\nhim. He was very tall and very thin. His frame had a Yorkshireman\'s\r\nsolidity, and his bones were massive. He missed being ungainly only\r\nthrough the serenity of his self-reliance. He had high cheek-bones and\r\na long, lean face. His nose and mouth were large, and his skin was\r\nsallow. But there were two characteristics which fascinated her, an\r\nimposing strength of purpose and a singular capacity for suffering. This\r\nwas a man who knew his mind and was determined to achieve his desire; it\r\nrefreshed her vastly after the extreme weakness of the young painters\r\nwith whom of late she had mostly consorted. But those quick dark eyes\r\nwere able to express an anguish that was hardly tolerable, and the mobile\r\nmouth had a nervous intensity which suggested that he might easily suffer\r\nthe very agonies of woe.\r\n\r\nTea was ready, and Arthur stood up to receive his cup.\r\n\r\n\'Sit down,\' said Margaret. \'I\'ll bring you everything you want, and I\r\nknow exactly how much sugar to put in. It pleases me to wait on you.\'\r\n\r\nWith the grace that marked all her movements she walked cross the studio,\r\nthe filled cup in one hand and the plate of cakes in the other. To Susie\r\nit seemed that he was overwhelmed with gratitude by Margaret\'s\r\ncondescension. His eyes were soft with indescribable tenderness as he\r\ntook the sweetmeats she gave him. Margaret smiled with happy pride. For\r\nall her good-nature, Susie could not prevent the pang that wrung her\r\nheart; for she too was capable of love. There was in her a wealth of\r\npassionate affection that none had sought to find. None had ever\r\nwhispered in her ears the charming nonsense that she read in books. She\r\nrecognised that she had no beauty to help her, but once she had at least\r\nthe charm of vivacious youth. That was gone now, and the freedom to go\r\ninto the world had come too late; yet her instinct told her that she was\r\nmade to be a decent man\'s wife and the mother of children. She stopped\r\nin the middle of her bright chatter, fearing to trust her voice, but\r\nMargaret and Arthur were too much occupied to notice that she had ceased\r\nto speak. They sat side by side and enjoyed the happiness of one\r\nanother\'s company.\r\n\r\n\'What a fool I am!\' thought Susie.\r\n\r\nShe had learnt long ago that common sense, intelligence, good-nature, and\r\nstrength of character were unimportant in comparison with a pretty face.\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know if you young things realise that it\'s growing late. If you\r\nwant us to dine at the Chien Noir, you must leave us now, so that we can\r\nmake ourselves tidy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well,\' said Arthur, getting up. \'I\'ll go back to my hotel and have\r\na wash. We\'ll meet at half-past seven.\'\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret had closed the door on him, she turned to her friend.\r\n\r\n\'Well, what do you think?\' she asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t expect me to form a definite opinion of a man whom I\'ve seen\r\nfor so short a time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense!\' said Margaret.\r\n\r\nSusie hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n\'I think he has an extraordinarily good face,\' she said at last\r\ngravely. \'I\'ve never seen a man whose honesty of purpose was so\r\ntransparent.\'\r\n\r\nSusie Boyd was so lazy that she could never be induced to occupy herself\r\nwith household matters and, while Margaret put the tea things away, she\r\nbegan to draw the caricature which every new face suggested to her. She\r\nmade a little sketch of Arthur, abnormally lanky, with a colossal nose,\r\nwith the wings and the bow and arrow of the God of Love, but it was not\r\nhalf done before she thought it silly. She tore it up with impatience.\r\nWhen Margaret came back, she turned round and looked at her steadily.\r\n\r\n\'Well?\' said the girl, smiling under the scrutiny.\r\n\r\nShe stood in the middle of the lofty studio. Half-finished canvases\r\nleaned with their faces against the wall; pieces of stuff were hung\r\nhere and there, and photographs of well-known pictures. She had fallen\r\nunconsciously into a wonderful pose, and her beauty gave her,\r\nnotwithstanding her youth, a rare dignity. Susie smiled mockingly.\r\n\r\n\'You look like a Greek goddess in a Paris frock,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'What have you to say to me?\' asked Margaret, divining from the searching\r\nlook that something was in her friend\'s mind.\r\n\r\nSusie stood up and went to her.\r\n\r\n\'You know, before I\'d seen him I hoped with all my heart that he\'d make\r\nyou happy. Notwithstanding all you\'d told me of him, I was afraid. I\r\nknew he was much older than you. He was the first man you\'d ever known.\r\nI could scarcely bear to entrust you to him in case you were miserable.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think you need have any fear.\'\r\n\r\n\'But now I hope with all my heart that you\'ll make him happy. It\'s not\r\nyou I\'m frightened for now, but him.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret did not answer; she could not understand what Susie meant.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve never seen anyone with such a capacity for wretchedness as that man\r\nhas. I don\'t think you can conceive how desperately he might suffer. Be\r\nvery careful, Margaret, and be very good to him, for you have the power\r\nto make him more unhappy than any human being should be.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but I want him to be happy,\' cried Margaret vehemently. \'You know\r\nthat I owe everything to him. I\'d do all I could to make him happy, even\r\nif I had to sacrifice myself. But I can\'t sacrifice myself, because I\r\nlove him so much that all I do is pure delight.\'\r\n\r\nHer eyes filled with tears and her voice broke. Susie, with a little\r\nlaugh that was half hysterical, kissed her.\r\n\r\n\'My dear, for heaven\'s sake don\'t cry! You know I can\'t bear people who\r\nweep, and if he sees your eyes red, he\'ll never forgive me.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chien Noir, where Susie Boyd and Margaret generally dined, was the\r\nmost charming restaurant in the quarter. Downstairs was a public room,\r\nwhere all and sundry devoured their food, for the little place had a\r\nreputation for good cooking combined with cheapness; and the _patron_,\r\na retired horse-dealer who had taken to victualling in order to build up\r\na business for his son, was a cheery soul whose loud-voiced friendliness\r\nattracted custom. But on the first floor was a narrow room, with three\r\ntables arranged in a horse-shoe, which was reserved for a small party of\r\nEnglish or American painters and a few Frenchmen with their wives. At\r\nleast, they were so nearly wives, and their manner had such a matrimonial\r\nrespectability, that Susie, when first she and Margaret were introduced\r\ninto this society, judged it would be vulgar to turn up her nose. She\r\nheld that it was prudish to insist upon the conventions of Notting Hill\r\nin the Boulevard de Montparnasse. The young women who had thrown in their\r\nlives with these painters were modest in demeanour and quiet in dress.\r\nThey were model housewives, who had preserved their self-respect\r\nnotwithstanding a difficult position, and did not look upon their\r\nrelation with less seriousness because they had not muttered a few\r\nwords before _Monsieur le Maire_.\r\n\r\nThe room was full when Arthur Burdon entered, but Margaret had kept him\r\nan empty seat between herself and Miss Boyd. Everyone was speaking at\r\nonce, in French, at the top of his voice, and a furious argument was\r\nproceeding on the merit of the later Impressionists. Arthur sat down, and\r\nwas hurriedly introduced to a lanky youth, who sat on the other side of\r\nMargaret. He was very tall, very thin, very fair. He wore a very high\r\ncollar and very long hair, and held himself like an exhausted lily.\r\n\r\n\'He always reminds me of an Aubrey Beardsley that\'s been dreadfully\r\nsmudged,\' said Susie in an undertone. \'He\'s a nice, kind creature, but\r\nhis name is Jagson. He has virtue and industry. I haven\'t seen any of his\r\nwork, but he has absolutely _no_ talent.\'\r\n\r\n\'How do you know, if you\'ve not seen his pictures?\' asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it\'s one of our conventions here that nobody has talent,\' laughed\r\nSusie. \'We suffer one another personally, but we have no illusions about\r\nthe value of our neighbour\'s work.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tell me who everyone is.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, look at that little bald man in the corner. That is Warren.\'\r\n\r\nArthur looked at the man she pointed out. He was a small person, with\r\na pate as shining as a billiard-ball, and a pointed beard. He had\r\nprotruding, brilliant eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Hasn\'t he had too much to drink?\' asked Arthur frigidly.\r\n\r\n\'Much,\' answered Susie promptly, \'but he\'s always in that condition, and\r\nthe further he gets from sobriety the more charming he is. He\'s the only\r\nman in this room of whom you\'ll never hear a word of evil. The strange\r\nthing is that he\'s very nearly a great painter. He has the most\r\nfascinating sense of colour in the world, and the more intoxicated he is,\r\nthe more delicate and beautiful is his painting. Sometimes, after more\r\nthan the usual number of _aperitifs_, he will sit down in a cafe to do a\r\nsketch, with his hand so shaky that he can hardly hold a brush; he has to\r\nwait for a favourable moment, and then he makes a jab at the panel. And\r\nthe immoral thing is that each of these little jabs is lovely. He\'s the\r\nmost delightful interpreter of Paris I know, and when you\'ve seen his\r\nsketches--he\'s done hundreds, of unimaginable grace and feeling and\r\ndistinction--you can never see Paris in the same way again.\'\r\n\r\nThe little maid who looked busily after the varied wants of the customers\r\nstood in front of them to receive Arthur\'s order. She was a hard-visaged\r\ncreature of mature age, but she looked neat in her black dress and white\r\ncap; and she had a motherly way of attending to these people, with a\r\ncapacious smile of her large mouth which was full of charm.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mind what I eat,\' said Arthur. \'Let Margaret order my dinner for\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\n\'It would have been just as good if I had ordered it,\' laughed Susie.\r\n\r\nThey began a lively discussion with Marie as to the merits of the various\r\ndishes, and it was only interrupted by Warren\'s hilarious expostulations.\r\n\r\n\'Marie, I precipitate myself at your feet, and beg you to bring me a\r\n_poule au riz_.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but give me one moment, _monsieur_,\' said the maid.\r\n\r\n\'Do not pay any attention to that gentleman. His morals are detestable,\r\nand he only seeks to lead you from the narrow path of virtue.\'\r\n\r\nArthur protested that on the contrary the passion of hunger occupied at\r\nthat moment his heart to the exclusion of all others.\r\n\r\n\'Marie, you no longer love me,\' cried Warren. \'There was a time when you\r\ndid not look so coldly upon me when I ordered a bottle of white wine.\'\r\n\r\nThe rest of the party took up his complaint, and all besought her not to\r\nshow too hard a heart to the bald and rubicund painter.\r\n\r\n\'_Mais si, je vous aime, Monsieur Warren,_\' she cried, laughing, \'_Je\r\nvous aime tous, tous._\'\r\n\r\nShe ran downstairs, amid the shouts of men and women, to give her orders.\r\n\r\n\'The other day the Chien Noir was the scene of a tragedy,\' said Susie.\r\n\'Marie broke off relations with her lover, who is a waiter at Lavenue\'s,\r\nand would have no reconciliation. He waited till he had a free evening,\r\nand then came to the room downstairs and ordered dinner. Of course, she\r\nwas obliged to wait on him, and as she brought him each dish he\r\nexpostulated with her, and they mingled their tears.\'\r\n\r\n\'She wept in floods,\' interrupted a youth with neatly brushed hair and\r\nfat nose. \'She wept all over our food, and we ate it salt with tears. We\r\nbesought her not to yield; except for our encouragement she would have\r\ngone back to him; and he beats her.\'\r\n\r\nMarie appeared again, with no signs now that so short a while ago romance\r\nhad played a game with her, and brought the dishes that had been ordered.\r\nSusie seized once more upon Arthur Burdon\'s attention.\r\n\r\n\'Now please look at the man who is sitting next to Mr Warren.\'\r\n\r\nArthur saw a tall, dark fellow with strongly-marked features, untidy\r\nhair, and a ragged black moustache.\r\n\r\n\'That is Mr O\'Brien, who is an example of the fact that strength of will\r\nand an earnest purpose cannot make a painter. He\'s a failure, and he\r\nknows it, and the bitterness has warped his soul. If you listen to him,\r\nyou\'ll hear every painter of eminence come under his lash. He can forgive\r\nnobody who\'s successful, and he never acknowledges merit in anyone till\r\nhe\'s safely dead and buried.\'\r\n\r\n\'He must be a cheerful companion,\' answered Arthur. \'And who is the stout\r\nold lady by his side, with the flaunting hat?\'\r\n\r\n\'That is the mother of Madame Rouge, the little palefaced woman sitting\r\nnext to her. She is the mistress of Rouge, who does all the illustrations\r\nfor _La Semaine_. At first it rather tickled me that the old lady should\r\ncall him _mon gendre_, my son-in-law, and take the irregular union of her\r\ndaughter with such a noble unconcern for propriety; but now it seems\r\nquite natural.\'\r\n\r\nThe mother of Madame Rouge had the remains of beauty, and she sat bolt\r\nupright, picking the leg of a chicken with a dignified gesture. Arthur\r\nlooked away quickly, for, catching his eye, she gave him an amorous\r\nglance. Rouge had more the appearance of a prosperous tradesman than of\r\nan artist; but he carried on with O\'Brien, whose French was perfect, an\r\nargument on the merits of Cezanne. To one he was a great master and to\r\nthe other an impudent charlatan. Each hotly repeated his opinion, as\r\nthough the mere fact of saying the same thing several times made it more\r\nconvincing.\r\n\r\n\'Next to me is Madame Meyer,\' proceeded Susie. \'She was a governess in\r\nPoland, but she was much too pretty to remain one, and now she lives with\r\nthe landscape painter who is by her side.\'\r\n\r\nArthur\'s eyes followed her words and rested on a cleanshaven man with a\r\nlarge quantity of grey, curling hair. He had a handsome face of a\r\ndeliberately aesthetic type and was very elegantly dressed. His manner\r\nand his conversation had the flamboyance of the romantic thirties. He\r\ntalked in flowing periods with an air of finality, and what he said was\r\nno less just than obvious. The gay little lady who shared his fortunes\r\nlistened to his wisdom with an admiration that plainly flattered him.\r\n\r\nMiss Boyd had described everyone to Arthur except young Raggles, who\r\npainted still life with a certain amount of skill, and Clayson, the\r\nAmerican sculptor. Raggles stood for rank and fashion at the Chien\r\nNoir. He was very smartly dressed in a horsey way, and he walked with\r\nbowlegs, as though he spent most of his time in the saddle. He alone\r\nused scented pomade upon his neat smooth hair. His chief distinction\r\nwas a greatcoat he wore, with a scarlet lining; and Warren, whose memory\r\nfor names was defective, could only recall him by that peculiarity. But\r\nit was understood that he knew duchesses in fashionable streets, and\r\noccasionally dined with them in solemn splendour.\r\n\r\nClayson had a vinous nose and a tedious habit of saying brilliant things.\r\nWith his twinkling eyes, red cheeks, and fair, pointed beard, he looked\r\nexactly like a Franz Hals; but he was dressed like the caricature of a\r\nFrenchman in a comic paper. He spoke English with a Parisian accent.\r\n\r\nMiss Boyd was beginning to tear him gaily limb from limb, when the door\r\nwas flung open, and a large person entered. He threw off his cloak with a\r\ndramatic gesture.\r\n\r\n\'Marie, disembarrass me of this coat of frieze. Hang my sombrero upon a\r\nconvenient peg.\'\r\n\r\nHe spoke execrable French, but there was a grandiloquence about his\r\nvocabulary which set everyone laughing.\r\n\r\n\'Here is somebody I don\'t know,\' said Susie.\r\n\r\n\'But I do, at least, by sight,\' answered Burdon. He leaned over to Dr\r\nPorhoet who was sitting opposite, quietly eating his dinner and enjoying\r\nthe nonsense which everyone talked. \'Is not that your magician?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oliver Haddo,\' said Dr Porhoet, with a little nod of amusement.\r\n\r\nThe new arrival stood at the end of the room with all eyes upon him. He\r\nthrew himself into an attitude of command and remained for a moment\r\nperfectly still.\r\n\r\n\'You look as if you were posing, Haddo,\' said Warren huskily.\r\n\r\n\'He couldn\'t help doing that if he tried,\' laughed Clayson.\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo slowly turned his glance to the painter.\r\n\r\n\'I grieve to see, O most excellent Warren, that the ripe juice of the\r\n_aperitif_ has glazed your sparkling eye.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean to say I\'m drunk, sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'In one gross, but expressive, word, drunk.\'\r\n\r\nThe painter grotesquely flung himself back in his chair as though he had\r\nbeen struck a blow, and Haddo looked steadily at Clayson.\r\n\r\n\'How often have I explained to you, O Clayson, that your deplorable lack\r\nof education precludes you from the brilliancy to which you aspire?\'\r\n\r\nFor an instant Oliver Haddo resumed his effective pose; and Susie,\r\nsmiling, looked at him. He was a man of great size, two or three\r\ninches more than six feet high; but the most noticeable thing about\r\nhim was a vast obesity. His paunch was of imposing dimensions. His face\r\nwas large and fleshy. He had thrown himself into the arrogant attitude\r\nof Velasquez\'s portrait of Del Borro in the Museum of Berlin; and his\r\ncountenance bore of set purpose the same contemptuous smile. He advanced\r\nand shook hands with Dr Porhoet.\r\n\r\n\'Hail, brother wizard! I greet in you, if not a master, at least a\r\nstudent not unworthy my esteem.\'\r\n\r\nSusie was convulsed with laughter at his pompousness, and he turned to\r\nher with the utmost gravity.\r\n\r\n\'Madam, your laughter is more soft in mine ears than the singing of\r\nBulbul in a Persian garden.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet interposed with introductions. The magician bowed solemnly as\r\nhe was in turn made known to Susie Boyd, and Margaret, and Arthur Burdon.\r\nHe held out his hand to the grim Irish painter.\r\n\r\n\'Well, my O\'Brien, have you been mixing as usual the waters of bitterness\r\nwith the thin claret of Bordeaux?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t you sit down and eat your dinner?\' returned the other,\r\ngruffly.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, my dear fellow, I wish I could drive the fact into this head of\r\nyours that rudeness is not synonymous with wit. I shall not have lived in\r\nvain if I teach you in time to realize that the rapier of irony is more\r\neffective an instrument than the bludgeon of insolence.\'\r\n\r\nO\'Brien reddened with anger, but could not at once find a retort, and\r\nHaddo passed on to that faded, harmless youth who sat next to Margaret.\r\n\r\n\'Do my eyes deceive me, or is this the Jagson whose name in its inanity\r\nis so appropriate to the bearer? I am eager to know if you still devote\r\nupon the ungrateful arts talents which were more profitably employed upon\r\nhaberdashery.\'\r\n\r\nThe unlucky creature, thus brutally attacked, blushed feebly without\r\nanswering, and Haddo went on to the Frenchman, Meyer as more worthy of\r\nhis mocking.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid my entrance interrupted you in a discourse. Was it the\r\ncelebrated harangue on the greatness of Michelangelo, or was it the\r\nsearching analysis of the art of Wagner?\'\r\n\r\n\'We were just going,\' said Meyer, getting up with a frown.\r\n\r\n\'I am desolated to lose the pearls of wisdom that habitually fall from\r\nyour cultivated lips,\' returned Haddo, as he politely withdrew Madame\r\nMeyer\'s chair.\r\n\r\nHe sat down with a smile.\r\n\r\n\'I saw the place was crowded, and with Napoleonic instinct decided\r\nthat I could only make room by insulting somebody. It is cause for\r\ncongratulation that my gibes, which Raggles, a foolish youth, mistakes\r\nfor wit, have caused the disappearance of a person who lives in open sin;\r\nthereby vacating two seats, and allowing me to eat a humble meal with\r\nample room for my elbows.\'\r\n\r\nMarie brought him the bill of fare, and he looked at it gravely.\r\n\r\n\'I will have a vanilla ice, O well-beloved, and a wing of a tender\r\nchicken, a fried sole, and some excellent pea-soup.\'\r\n\r\n\'_Bien, un potage, une sole,_ one chicken, and an ice.\'\r\n\r\n\'But why should you serve them in that order rather than in the order I\r\ngave you?\'\r\n\r\nMarie and the two Frenchwomen who were still in the room broke into\r\nexclamations at this extravagance, but Oliver Haddo waved his fat hand.\r\n\r\n\'I shall start with the ice, O Marie, to cool the passion with which\r\nyour eyes inflame me, and then without hesitation I will devour the wing\r\nof a chicken in order to sustain myself against your smile. I shall then\r\nproceed to a fresh sole, and with the pea-soup I will finish a not\r\nunsustaining meal.\'\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded in capturing the attention of everyone in the room,\r\nOliver Haddo proceeded to eat these dishes in the order he had named.\r\nMargaret and Burdon watched him with scornful eyes, but Susie, who was\r\nnot revolted by the vanity which sought to attract notice, looked at him\r\ncuriously. He was clearly not old, though his corpulence added to his\r\napparent age. His features were good, his ears small, and his nose\r\ndelicately shaped. He had big teeth, but they were white and even. His\r\nmouth was large, with heavy moist lips. He had the neck of a bullock. His\r\ndark, curling hair had retreated from the forehead and temples in such a\r\nway as to give his clean-shaven face a disconcerting nudity. The baldness\r\nof his crown was vaguely like a tonsure. He had the look of a very\r\nwicked, sensual priest. Margaret, stealing a glance at him as he ate,\r\non a sudden violently shuddered; he affected her with an uncontrollable\r\ndislike. He lifted his eyes slowly, and she looked away, blushing as\r\nthough she had been taken in some indiscretion. These eyes were the most\r\ncurious thing about him. They were not large, but an exceedingly pale\r\nblue, and they looked at you in a way that was singularly embarrassing.\r\nAt first Susie could not discover in what precisely their peculiarity\r\nlay, but in a moment she found out: the eyes of most persons converge\r\nwhen they look at you, but Oliver Haddo\'s, naturally or by a habit he\r\nhad acquired for effect, remained parallel. It gave the impression that\r\nhe looked straight through you and saw the wall beyond. It was uncanny.\r\nBut another strange thing about him was the impossibility of telling\r\nwhether he was serious. There was a mockery in that queer glance, a\r\nsardonic smile upon the mouth, which made you hesitate how to take his\r\noutrageous utterances. It was irritating to be uncertain whether, while\r\nyou were laughing at him, he was not really enjoying an elaborate joke at\r\nyour expense.\r\n\r\nHis presence cast an unusual chill upon the party. The French members\r\ngot up and left. Warren reeled out with O\'Brien, whose uncouth sarcasms\r\nwere no match for Haddo\'s bitter gibes. Raggles put on his coat with the\r\nscarlet lining and went out with the tall Jagson, who smarted still under\r\nHaddo\'s insolence. The American sculptor paid his bill silently. When\r\nhe was at the door, Haddo stopped him.\r\n\r\n\'You have modelled lions at the Jardin des Plantes, my dear Clayson. Have\r\nyou ever hunted them on their native plains?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I haven\'t.\'\r\n\r\nClayson did not know why Haddo asked the question, but he bristled with\r\nincipient wrath.\r\n\r\n\'Then you have not seen the jackal, gnawing at a dead antelope, scamper\r\naway in terror when the King of Beasts stalked down to make his meal.\'\r\n\r\nClayson slammed the door behind him. Haddo was left with Margaret, and\r\nArthur Burdon, Dr Porhoet, and Susie. He smiled quietly.\r\n\r\n\'By the way, are _you_ a lion-hunter?\' asked Susie flippantly.\r\n\r\nHe turned on her his straight uncanny glance.\r\n\r\n\'I have no equal with big game. I have shot more lions than any man\r\nalive. I think Jules Gerard, whom the French of the nineteenth century\r\ncalled _Le Tueur de Lions_, may have been fit to compare with me, but I\r\ncan call to mind no other.\'\r\n\r\nThis statement, made with the greatest calm, caused a moment of silence.\r\nMargaret stared at him with amazement.\r\n\r\n\'You suffer from no false modesty,\' said Arthur Burdon.\r\n\r\n\'False modesty is a sign of ill-breeding, from which my birth amply\r\nprotects me.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet looked up with a smile of irony.\r\n\r\n\'I wish Mr Haddo would take this opportunity to disclose to us the\r\nmystery of his birth and family. I have a suspicion that, like the\r\nimmortal Cagliostro, he was born of unknown but noble parents, and\r\neducated secretly in Eastern palaces.\'\r\n\r\n\'In my origin I am more to be compared with Denis Zachaire or with\r\nRaymond Lully. My ancestor, George Haddo, came to Scotland in the suite\r\nof Anne of Denmark, and when James I, her consort, ascended the English\r\nthrone, he was granted the estates in Staffordshire which I still\r\npossess. My family has formed alliances with the most noble blood of\r\nEngland, and the Merestons, the Parnabys, the Hollingtons, have been\r\nproud to give their daughters to my house.\'\r\n\r\n\'Those are facts which can be verified in works of reference,\' said\r\nArthur dryly.\r\n\r\n\'They can,\' said Oliver.\r\n\r\n\'And the Eastern palaces in which your youth was spent, and the black\r\nslaves who waited on you, and the bearded sheikhs who imparted to you\r\nsecret knowledge?\' cried Dr Porhoet.\r\n\r\n\'I was educated at Eton, and I left Oxford in 1896.\'\r\n\r\n\'Would you mind telling me at what college you were?\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'I was at the House.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you must have been there with Frank Hurrell.\'\r\n\r\n\'Now assistant physician at St Luke\'s Hospital. He was one of my most\r\nintimate friends.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll write and ask him about you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m dying to know what you did with all the lions you slaughtered,\' said\r\nSusie Boyd.\r\n\r\nThe man\'s effrontery did not exasperate her as it obviously exasperated\r\nMargaret and Arthur. He amused her, and she was anxious to make him talk.\r\n\r\n\'They decorate the floors of Skene, which is the name of my place in\r\nStaffordshire.\' He paused for a moment to light a cigar. \'I am the only\r\nman alive who has killed three lions with three successive shots.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should have thought you could have demolished them by the effects of\r\nyour oratory,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nOliver leaned back and placed his two large hands on the table.\r\n\r\n\'Burkhardt, a German with whom I was shooting, was down with fever and\r\ncould not stir from his bed. I was awakened one night by the uneasiness\r\nof my oxen, and I heard the roaring of lions close at hand. I took my\r\ncarbine and came out of my tent. There was only the meagre light of the\r\nmoon. I walked alone, for I knew natives could be of no use to me.\r\nPresently I came upon the carcass of an antelope, half-consumed, and I\r\nmade up my mind to wait for the return of the lions. I hid myself among\r\nthe boulders twenty paces from the prey. All about me was the immensity\r\nof Africa and the silence. I waited, motionless, hour after hour, till\r\nthe dawn was nearly at hand. At last three lions appeared over a rock.\r\nI had noticed, the day before, spoor of a lion and two females.\'\r\n\r\n\'May I ask how you could distinguish the sex?\' asked Arthur,\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n\'The prints of a lion\'s fore feet are disproportionately larger than\r\nthose of the hind feet. The fore feet and hind feet of the lioness are\r\nnearly the same size.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pray go on,\' said Susie.\r\n\r\n\'They came into full view, and in the dim light, as they stood chest on,\r\nthey appeared as huge as the strange beasts of the Arabian tales. I aimed\r\nat the lioness which stood nearest to me and fired. Without a sound, like\r\na bullock felled at one blow, she dropped. The lion gave vent to a\r\nsonorous roar. Hastily I slipped another cartridge in my rifle. Then I\r\nbecame conscious that he had seen me. He lowered his head, and his crest\r\nwas erect. His lifted tail was twitching, his lips were drawn back from\r\nthe red gums, and I saw his great white fangs. Living fire flashed from\r\nhis eyes, and he growled incessantly. Then he advanced a few steps, his\r\nhead held low; and his eyes were fixed on mine with a look of rage.\r\nSuddenly he jerked up his tail, and when a lion does this he charges. I\r\ngot a quick sight on his chest and fired. He reared up on his hind legs,\r\nroaring loudly and clawing at the air, and fell back dead. One lioness\r\nremained, and through the smoke I saw her spring to her feet and rush\r\ntowards me. Escape was impossible, for behind me were high boulders that\r\nI could not climb. She came on with hoarse, coughing grunts, and with\r\ndesperate courage I fired my remaining barrel. I missed her clean. I took\r\none step backwards in the hope of getting a cartridge into my rifle, and\r\nfell, scarcely two lengths in front of the furious beast. She missed me.\r\nI owed my safety to that fall. And then suddenly I found that she had\r\ncollapsed. I had hit her after all. My bullet went clean through her\r\nheart, but the spring had carried her forwards. When I scrambled to my\r\nfeet I found that she was dying. I walked back to my camp and ate a\r\ncapital breakfast.\'\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo\'s story was received with astonished silence. No one could\r\nassert that it was untrue, but he told it with a grandiloquence that\r\ncarried no conviction. Arthur would have wagered a considerable sum that\r\nthere was no word of truth in it. He had never met a person of this kind\r\nbefore, and could not understand what pleasure there might be in the\r\nelaborate invention of improbable adventures.\r\n\r\n\'You are evidently very brave,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'To follow a wounded lion into thick cover is probably the most dangerous\r\nproceeding in the world,\' said Haddo calmly. \'It calls for the utmost\r\ncoolness and for iron nerve.\'\r\n\r\nThe answer had an odd effect on Arthur. He gave Haddo a rapid glance, and\r\nwas seized suddenly with uncontrollable laughter. He leaned back in his\r\nchair and roared. His hilarity affected the others, and they broke into\r\npeal upon peal of laughter. Oliver watched them gravely. He seemed\r\nneither disconcerted nor surprised. When Arthur recovered himself, he\r\nfound Haddo\'s singular eyes fixed on him.\r\n\r\n\'Your laughter reminds me of the crackling of thorns under a pot,\' he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHaddo looked round at the others. Though his gaze preserved its fixity,\r\nhis lips broke into a queer, sardonic smile.\r\n\r\n\'It must be plain even to the feeblest intelligence that a man can only\r\ncommand the elementary spirits if he is without fear. A capricious mind\r\ncan never rule the sylphs, nor a fickle disposition the undines.\'\r\n\r\nArthur stared at him with amazement. He did not know what on earth the\r\nman was talking about. Haddo paid no heed.\r\n\r\n\'But if the adept is active, pliant, and strong, the whole world will be\r\nat his command. He will pass through the storm and no rain shall fall\r\nupon his head. The wind will not displace a single fold of his garment.\r\nHe will go through fire and not be burned.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet ventured upon an explanation of these cryptic utterances.\r\n\r\n\'These ladies are unacquainted with the mysterious beings of whom you\r\nspeak, _cher ami_. They should know that during the Middle Ages\r\nimagination peopled the four elements with intelligences, normally\r\nunseen, some of which were friendly to man and others hostile. They were\r\nthought to be powerful and conscious of their power, though at the same\r\ntime they were profoundly aware that they possessed no soul. Their life\r\ndepended upon the continuance of some natural object, and hence for them\r\nthere could be no immortality. They must return eventually to the abyss\r\nof unending night, and the darkness of death afflicted them always. But\r\nit was thought that in the same manner as man by his union with God had\r\nwon a spark of divinity, so might the sylphs, gnomes, undines, and\r\nsalamanders by an alliance with man partake of his immortality. And many\r\nof their women, whose beauty was more than human, gained a human soul by\r\nloving one of the race of men. But the reverse occurred also, and often a\r\nlove-sick youth lost his immortality because he left the haunts of his\r\nkind to dwell with the fair, soulless denizens of the running streams or\r\nof the forest airs.\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t know that you spoke figuratively,\' said Arthur to Oliver Haddo.\r\n\r\nThe other shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\'What else is the world than a figure? Life itself is but a symbol. You\r\nmust be a wise man if you can tell us what is reality.\'\r\n\r\n\'When you begin to talk of magic and mysticism I confess that I am out of\r\nmy depth.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yet magic is no more than the art of employing consciously invisible\r\nmeans to produce visible effects. Will, love, and imagination are magic\r\npowers that everyone possesses; and whoever knows how to develop them to\r\ntheir fullest extent is a magician. Magic has but one dogma, namely, that\r\nthe seen is the measure of the unseen.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you tell us what the powers are that the adept possesses?\'\r\n\r\n\'They are enumerated in a Hebrew manuscript of the sixteenth century,\r\nwhich is in my possession. The privileges of him who holds in his right\r\nhand the Keys of Solomon and in his left the Branch of the Blossoming\r\nAlmond are twenty-one. He beholds God face to face without dying, and\r\nconverses intimately with the Seven Genii who command the celestial army.\r\nHe is superior to every affliction and to every fear. He reigns with all\r\nheaven and is served by all hell. He holds the secret of the resurrection\r\nof the dead, and the key of immortality.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you possess even these you have evidently the most varied\r\nattainments,\' said Arthur ironically.\r\n\r\n\'Everyone can make game of the unknown,\' retorted Haddo, with a shrug of\r\nhis massive shoulders.\r\n\r\nArthur did not answer. He looked at Haddo curiously. He asked himself\r\nwhether he believed seriously these preposterous things, or whether he\r\nwas amusing himself in an elephantine way at their expense. His mariner\r\nwas earnest, but there was an odd expression about the mouth, a hard\r\ntwinkle of the eyes, which seemed to belie it. Susie was vastly\r\nentertained. It diverted her enormously to hear occult matters discussed\r\nwith apparent gravity in this prosaic tavern. Dr Porhoet broke the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\'Arago, after whom has been named a neighbouring boulevard, declared that\r\ndoubt was a proof of modesty, which has rarely interfered with the\r\nprogress of science. But one cannot say the same of incredulity, and he\r\nthat uses the word impossible outside of pure mathematics is lacking in\r\nprudence. It should be remembered that Lactantius proclaimed belief in\r\nthe existence of antipodes inane, and Saint Augustine of Hippo added that\r\nin any case there could be no question of inhabited lands.\'\r\n\r\n\'That sounds as if you were not quite sceptical, dear doctor,\' said Miss\r\nBoyd.\r\n\r\n\'In my youth I believed nothing, for science had taught me to distrust\r\neven the evidence of my five senses,\' he replied, with a shrug of\r\nthe shoulders. \'But I have seen many things in the East which are\r\ninexplicable by the known processes of science. Mr Haddo has given\r\nyou one definition of magic, and I will give you another. It may be\r\ndescribed merely as the intelligent utilization of forces which are\r\nunknown, contemned, or misunderstood of the vulgar. The young man who\r\nsettles in the East sneers at the ideas of magic which surround him,\r\nbut I know not what there is in the atmosphere that saps his unbelief.\r\nWhen he has sojourned for some years among Orientals, he comes insensibly\r\nto share the opinion of many sensible men that perhaps there is something\r\nin it after all.\'\r\n\r\nArthur Burdon made a gesture of impatience.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot imagine that, however much I lived in Eastern countries, I\r\ncould believe anything that had the whole weight of science against it.\r\nIf there were a word of truth in anything Haddo says, we should be unable\r\nto form any reasonable theory of the universe.\'\r\n\r\n\'For a scientific man you argue with singular fatuity,\' said Haddo icily,\r\nand his manner had an offensiveness which was intensely irritating. \'You\r\nshould be aware that science, dealing only with the general, leaves out\r\nof consideration the individual cases that contradict the enormous\r\nmajority. Occasionally the heart is on the right side of the body, but\r\nyou would not on that account ever put your stethoscope in any other\r\nthan the usual spot. It is possible that under certain conditions the\r\nlaw of gravity does not apply, yet you will conduct your life under the\r\nconviction that it does so invariably. Now, there are some of us who\r\nchoose to deal only with these exceptions to the common run. The dull man\r\nwho plays at Monte Carlo puts his money on the colours, and generally\r\nblack or red turns up; but now and then zero appears, and he loses. But\r\nwe, who have backed zero all the time, win many times our stake. Here and\r\nthere you will find men whose imagination raises them above the humdrum\r\nof mankind. They are willing to lose their all if only they have chance\r\nof a great prize. Is it nothing not only to know the future, as did the\r\nprophets of old, but by making it to force the very gates of the\r\nunknown?\'\r\n\r\nSuddenly the bantering gravity with which he spoke fell away from him. A\r\nsingular light came into his eyes, and his voice was hoarse. Now at last\r\nthey saw that he was serious.\r\n\r\n\'What should you know of that lust for great secrets which consumes me to\r\nthe bottom of my soul!\'\r\n\r\n\'Anyhow, I\'m perfectly delighted to meet a magician,\' cried Susie gaily.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, call me not that,\' he said, with a flourish of his fat hands,\r\nregaining immediately his portentous flippancy. \'I would be known rather\r\nas the Brother of the Shadow.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should have thought you could be only a very distant relation of\r\nanything so unsubstantial,\' said Arthur, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nOliver\'s face turned red with furious anger. His strange blue eyes grew\r\ncold with hatred, and he thrust out his scarlet lips till he had the\r\nruthless expression of a Nero. The gibe at his obesity had caught him on\r\nthe raw. Susie feared that he would make so insulting a reply that a\r\nquarrel must ensure.\r\n\r\n\'Well, really, if we want to go to the fair we must start,\' she said\r\nquickly. \'And Marie is dying to be rid of us.\'\r\n\r\nThey got up, and clattered down the stairs into the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nThey came down to the busy, narrow street which led into the Boulevard du\r\nMontparnasse. Electric trams passed through it with harsh ringing of\r\nbells, and people surged along the pavements.\r\n\r\nThe fair to which they were going was held at the Lion de Belfort, not\r\nmore than a mile away, and Arthur hailed a cab. Susie told the driver\r\nwhere they wanted to be set down. She noticed that Haddo, who was waiting\r\nfor them to start, put his hand on the horse\'s neck. On a sudden, for no\r\napparent reason, it began to tremble. The trembling passed through the\r\nbody and down its limbs till it shook from head to foot as though it had\r\nthe staggers. The coachman jumped off his box and held the wretched\r\ncreature\'s head. Margaret and Susie got out. It was a horribly painful\r\nsight. The horse seemed not to suffer from actual pain, but from an\r\nextraordinary fear. Though she knew not why, an idea came to Susie.\r\n\r\n\'Take your hand away, Mr Haddo,\' she said sharply.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and did as she bade him. At the same moment the trembling\r\nbegan to decrease, and in a moment the poor old cab-horse was in its\r\nusual state. It seemed a little frightened still, but otherwise\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder what the deuce was the matter with it,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo looked at him with the blue eyes that seemed to see right\r\nthrough people, and then, lifting his hat, walked away. Susie turned\r\nsuddenly to Dr Porhoet.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think he could have made the horse do that? It came immediately\r\nhe put his hand on its neck, and it stopped as soon as he took it away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense!\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'It occurred to me that he was playing some trick,\' said Dr Porhoet\r\ngravely. \'An odd thing happened once when he came to see me. I have two\r\nPersian cats, which are the most properly conducted of all their tribe.\r\nThey spend their days in front of my fire, meditating on the problems of\r\nmetaphysics. But as soon as he came in they started up, and their fur\r\nstood right on end. Then they began to run madly round and round the\r\nroom, as though the victims of uncontrollable terror. I opened the door,\r\nand they bolted out. I have never been able to understand exactly what\r\ntook place.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret shuddered.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve never met a man who filled me with such loathing,\' she said. \'I\r\ndon\'t know what there is about him that frightens me. Even now I feel his\r\neyes fixed strangely upon me. I hope I shall never see him again.\'\r\n\r\nArthur gave a little laugh and pressed her hand. She would not let his\r\ngo, and he felt that she was trembling. Personally, he had no doubt about\r\nthe matter. He would have no trifling with credibility. Either Haddo\r\nbelieved things that none but a lunatic could, or else he was a charlatan\r\nwho sought to attract attention by his extravagances. In any case he was\r\ncontemptible. It was certain, at all events, that neither he nor anyone\r\nelse could work miracles.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do,\' said Arthur. \'If he really knows Frank\r\nHurrell I\'ll find out all about him. I\'ll drop a note to Hurrell tonight\r\nand ask him to tell me anything he can.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish you would,\' answered Susie, \'because he interests me enormously.\r\nThere\'s no place like Paris for meeting queer folk. Sooner or later you\r\nrun across persons who believe in everything. There\'s no form of\r\nreligion, there\'s no eccentricity or enormity, that hasn\'t its votaries.\r\nJust think what a privilege it is to come upon a man in the twentieth\r\ncentury who honestly believes in the occult.\'\r\n\r\n\'Since I have been occupied with these matters, I have come across\r\nstrange people,\' said Dr Porhoet quietly, \'but I agree with Miss Boyd\r\nthat Oliver Haddo is the most extraordinary. For one thing, it is\r\nimpossible to know how much he really believes what he says. Is he an\r\nimpostor or a madman? Does he deceive himself, or is he laughing up his\r\nsleeve at the folly of those who take him seriously? I cannot tell. All\r\nI know is that he has travelled widely and is acquainted with many\r\ntongues. He has a minute knowledge of alchemical literature, and there\r\nis no book I have heard of, dealing with the black arts, which he does\r\nnot seem to know.\' Dr Porhoet shook his head slowly. \'I should not care\r\nto dogmatize about this man. I know I shall outrage the feelings of my\r\nfriend Arthur, but I am bound to confess it would not surprise me to\r\nlearn that he possessed powers by which he was able to do things\r\nseemingly miraculous.\'\r\n\r\nArthur was prevented from answering by their arrival at the Lion de\r\nBelfort.\r\n\r\nThe fair was in full swing. The noise was deafening. Steam bands\r\nthundered out the popular tunes of the moment, and to their din\r\nmerry-go-rounds were turning. At the door of booths men vociferously\r\nimportuned the passers-by to enter. From the shooting saloons came a\r\ncontinual spatter of toy rifles. Linking up these sounds, were the voices\r\nof the serried crowd that surged along the central avenue, and the\r\nshuffle of their myriad feet. The night was lurid with acetylene torches,\r\nwhich flamed with a dull unceasing roar. It was a curious sight, half\r\ngay, half sordid. The throng seemed bent with a kind of savagery upon\r\namusement, as though, resentful of the weary round of daily labour, it\r\nsought by a desperate effort to be merry.\r\n\r\nThe English party with Dr Porhoet, mildly ironic, had scarcely entered\r\nbefore they were joined by Oliver Haddo. He was indifferent to the plain\r\nfact that they did not want his company. He attracted attention, for his\r\nappearance and his manner were remarkable, and Susie noticed that he was\r\npleased to see people point him out to one another. He wore a Spanish\r\ncloak, the _capa_, and he flung the red and green velvet of its lining\r\ngaudily over his shoulder. He had a large soft hat. His height was great,\r\nthough less noticeable on account of his obesity, and he towered over the\r\npuny multitude.\r\n\r\nThey looked idly at the various shows, resisting the melodramas, the\r\ncircuses, the exhibitions of eccentricity, which loudly clamoured for\r\ntheir custom. Presently they came to a man who was cutting silhouettes in\r\nblack paper, and Haddo insisted on posing for him. A little crowd\r\ncollected and did not spare their jokes at his singular appearance. He\r\nthrew himself into his favourite attitude of proud command. Margaret\r\nwished to take the opportunity of leaving him, but Miss Boyd insisted on\r\nstaying.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s the most ridiculous creature I\'ve ever seen in my life,\' she\r\nwhispered. \'I wouldn\'t let him out of my sight for worlds.\'\r\n\r\nWhen the silhouette was done, he presented it with a low bow to Margaret.\r\n\r\n\'I implore your acceptance of the only portrait now in existence of\r\nOliver Haddo,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' she answered frigidly.\r\n\r\nShe was unwilling to take it, but had not the presence of mind to put\r\nhim off by a jest, and would not be frankly rude. As though certain she\r\nset much store on it, he placed it carefully in an envelope. They walked\r\non and suddenly came to a canvas booth on which was an Eastern name.\r\nRoughly painted on sail-cloth was a picture of an Arab charming snakes,\r\nand above were certain words in Arabic. At the entrance, a native sat\r\ncross-legged, listlessly beating a drum. When he saw them stop, he\r\naddressed them in bad French.\r\n\r\n\'Does not this remind you of the turbid Nile, Dr Porhoet?\' said Haddo.\r\n\'Let us go in and see what the fellow has to show.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet stepped forward and addressed the charmer, who brightened on\r\nhearing the language of his own country.\r\n\r\n\'He is an Egyptian from Assiut,\' said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\'I will buy tickets for you all,\' said Haddo.\r\n\r\nHe held up the flap that gave access to the booth, and Susie went in.\r\nMargaret and Arthur Burdon, somewhat against their will, were obliged to\r\nfollow. The native closed the opening behind them. They found themselves\r\nin a dirty little tent, ill-lit by two smoking lamps; a dozen stools were\r\nplaced in a circle on the bare ground. In one corner sat a fellah woman,\r\nmotionless, in ample robes of dingy black. Her face was hidden by a long\r\nveil, which was held in place by a queer ornament of brass in the middle\r\nof the forehead, between the eyes. These alone were visible, large and\r\nsombre, and the lashes were darkened with kohl: her fingers were brightly\r\nstained with henna. She moved slightly as the visitors entered, and the\r\nman gave her his drum. She began to rub it with her hands, curiously, and\r\nmade a droning sound, which was odd and mysterious. There was a peculiar\r\nodour in the place, so that Dr Porhoet was for a moment transported to\r\nthe evil-smelling streets of Cairo. It was an acrid mixture of incense,\r\nof attar of roses, with every imaginable putrescence. It choked the two\r\nwomen, and Susie asked for a cigarette. The native grinned when he heard\r\nthe English tongue. He showed a row of sparkling and beautiful teeth.\r\n\r\n\'My name Mohammed,\' he said. \'Me show serpents to Sirdar Lord Kitchener.\r\nWait and see. Serpents very poisonous.\'\r\n\r\nHe was dressed in a long blue gabardine, more suited to the sunny banks\r\nof the Nile than to a fair in Paris, and its colour could hardly be seen\r\nfor dirt. On his head was the national tarboosh.\r\n\r\nA rug lay at one side of the tent, and from under it he took a goatskin\r\nsack. He placed it on the ground in the middle of the circle formed by\r\nthe seats and crouched down on his haunches. Margaret shuddered, for the\r\nuneven surface of the sack moved strangely. He opened the mouth of it.\r\nThe woman in the corner listlessly droned away on the drum, and\r\noccasionally uttered a barbaric cry. With a leer and a flash of his\r\nbright teeth, the Arab thrust his hand into the sack and rummaged as a\r\nman would rummage in a sack of corn. He drew out a long, writhing snake.\r\nHe placed it on the ground and for a moment waited, then he passed his\r\nhand over it: it became immediately as rigid as a bar of iron. Except\r\nthat the eyes, the cruel eyes, were open still, there might have been no\r\nlife in it.\r\n\r\n\'Look,\' said Haddo. \'That is the miracle which Moses did before Pharaoh.\'\r\n\r\nThen the Arab took a reed instrument, not unlike the pipe which Pan\r\nin the hills of Greece played to the dryads, and he piped a weird,\r\nmonotonous tune. The stiffness broke away from the snake suddenly, and\r\nit lifted its head and raised its long body till it stood almost on the\r\ntip of its tail, and it swayed slowly to and fro.\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo seemed extraordinarily fascinated. He leaned forward with\r\neager face, and his unnatural eyes were fixed on the charmer with an\r\nindescribable expression. Margaret drew back in terror.\r\n\r\n\'You need not be frightened,\' said Arthur. \'These people only work with\r\nanimals whose fangs have been extracted.\'\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo looked at him before answering. He seemed to consider each\r\ntime what sort of man this was to whom he spoke.\r\n\r\n\'A man is only a snake-charmer because, without recourse to medicine, he\r\nis proof against the fangs of the most venomous serpents.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think so?\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'I saw the most noted charmer of Madras die two hours after he had been\r\nbitten by a cobra,\' said Haddo. I had heard many tales of his prowess,\r\nand one evening asked a friend to take me to him. He was out when we\r\narrived, but we waited, and presently, accompanied by some friends, he\r\ncame. We told him what we wanted. He had been at a marriage-feast and was\r\ndrunk. But he sent for his snakes, and forthwith showed us marvels which\r\nthis man has never heard of. At last he took a great cobra from his sack\r\nand began to handle it. Suddenly it darted at his chin and bit him. It\r\nmade two marks like pin-points. The juggler started back.\r\n\r\n\'"I am a dead man," he said.\r\n\r\n\'Those about him would have killed the cobra, but he prevented them.\r\n\r\n\'"Let the creature live," he said. "It may be of service to others of my\r\ntrade. To me it can be of no other use. Nothing can save me."\r\n\r\n\'His friends and the jugglers, his fellows, gathered round him and placed\r\nhim in a chair. In two hours he was dead. In his drunkenness he had\r\nforgotten a portion of the spell which protected him, and so he died.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have a marvellous collection of tall stories,\' said Arthur. \'I\'m\r\nafraid I should want better proof that these particular snakes are\r\npoisonous.\'\r\n\r\nOliver turned to the charmer and spoke to him in Arabic. Then he answered\r\nArthur.\r\n\r\n\'The man has a horned viper, _cerastes_ is the name under which you\r\ngentlemen of science know it, and it is the most deadly of all Egyptian\r\nsnakes. It is commonly known as Cleopatra\'s Asp, for that is the serpent\r\nwhich was brought in a basket of figs to the paramour of Caesar in order\r\nthat she might not endure the triumph of Augustus.\'\r\n\r\n\'What are you going to do?\' asked Susie.\r\n\r\nHe smiled but did not answer. He stepped forward to the centre of the\r\ntent and fell on his knees. He uttered Arabic words, which Dr. Porhoet\r\ntranslated to the others.\r\n\r\n\'O viper, I adjure you, by the great God who is all-powerful, to come\r\nforth. You are but a snake, and God is greater than all snakes. Obey my\r\ncall and come.\'\r\n\r\nA tremor went through the goatskin bag, and in a moment a head was\r\nprotruded. A lithe body wriggled out. It was a snake of light grey\r\ncolour, and over each eye was a horn. It lay slightly curled.\r\n\r\n\'Do you recognize it?\' said Oliver in a low voice to the doctor.\r\n\r\n\'I do.\'\r\n\r\nThe charmer sat motionless, and the woman in the dim background ceased\r\nher weird rubbing of the drum. Haddo seized the snake and opened its\r\nmouth. Immediately it fastened on his hand, and the reptile teeth went\r\ndeep into his flesh. Arthur watched him for signs of pain, but he did not\r\nwince. The writhing snake dangled from his hand. He repeated a sentence\r\nin Arabic, and, with the peculiar suddenness of a drop of water falling\r\nfrom a roof, the snake fell to the ground. The blood flowed freely. Haddo\r\nspat upon the bleeding place three times, muttering words they could not\r\nhear, and three times he rubbed the wound with his fingers. The bleeding\r\nstopped. He stretched out his hand for Arthur to look at.\r\n\r\n\'That surely is what a surgeon would call healing by first intention,\' he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBurdon was astonished, but he was irritated, too, and would not allow\r\nthat there was anything strange in the cessation of the flowing blood.\r\n\r\n\'You haven\'t yet shown that the snake was poisonous.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have not finished yet,\' smiled Haddo.\r\n\r\nHe spoke again to the Egyptian, who gave an order to his wife. Without a\r\nword she rose to her feet and from a box took a white rabbit. She lifted\r\nit up by the ears, and it struggled with its four quaint legs. Haddo put\r\nit in front of the horned viper. Before anyone could have moved, the\r\nsnake darted forward, and like a flash of lightning struck the rabbit.\r\nThe wretched little beast gave a slight scream, a shudder went through\r\nit, and it fell dead.\r\n\r\nMargaret sprang up with a cry.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, how cruel! How hatefully cruel!\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you convinced now?\' asked Haddo coolly.\r\n\r\nThe two women hurried to the doorway. They were frightened and disgusted.\r\nOliver Haddo was left alone with the snake-charmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet had asked Arthur to bring Margaret and Miss Boyd to see him on\r\nSunday at his apartment in the Ile Saint Louis; and the lovers arranged\r\nto spend an hour on their way at the Louvre. Susie, invited to accompany\r\nthem, preferred independence and her own reflections.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the crowd which throngs the picture galleries on holidays,\r\nthey went to that part of the museum where ancient sculpture is kept. It\r\nwas comparatively empty, and the long halls had the singular restfulness\r\nof places where works of art are gathered together. Margaret was filled\r\nwith a genuine emotion; and though she could not analyse it, as Susie,\r\nwho loved to dissect her state of mind, would have done, it strangely\r\nexhilarated her. Her heart was uplifted from the sordidness of earth,\r\nand she had a sensation of freedom which was as delightful as it was\r\nindescribable. Arthur had never troubled himself with art till Margaret\'s\r\nenthusiasm taught him that there was a side of life he did not realize.\r\nThough beauty meant little to his practical nature, he sought, in his\r\ngreat love for Margaret, to appreciate the works which excited her to\r\nsuch charming ecstasy. He walked by her side with docility and listened,\r\nnot without deference, to her outbursts. He admired the correctness of\r\nGreek anatomy, and there was one statue of an athlete which attracted\r\nhis prolonged attention, because the muscles were indicated with the\r\nprecision of a plate in a surgical textbook. When Margaret talked of the\r\nGreeks\' divine repose and of their blitheness, he thought it very clever\r\nbecause she said it; but in a man it would have aroused his impatience.\r\n\r\nYet there was one piece, the charming statue known as _La Diane de\r\nGabies_, which moved him differently, and to this presently he insisted\r\non going. With a laugh Margaret remonstrated, but secretly she was not\r\ndispleased. She was aware that his passion for this figure was due, not\r\nto its intrinsic beauty, but to a likeness he had discovered in it to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nIt stood in that fair wide gallery where is the mocking faun, with his\r\ninhuman savour of fellowship with the earth which is divine, and the\r\nsightless Homer. The goddess had not the arrogance of the huntress who\r\nloved Endymion, nor the majesty of the cold mistress of the skies. She\r\nwas in the likeness of a young girl, and with collected gesture fastened\r\nher cloak. There was nothing divine in her save a sweet strange spirit\r\nof virginity. A lover in ancient Greece, who offered sacrifice before\r\nthis fair image, might forget easily that it was a goddess to whom he\r\nknelt, and see only an earthly maid fresh with youth and chastity and\r\nloveliness. In Arthur\'s eyes Margaret had all the exquisite grace of the\r\nstatue, and the same unconscious composure; and in her also breathed the\r\nspring odours of ineffable purity. Her features were chiselled with\r\nthe clear and divine perfection of this Greek girl\'s; her ears were as\r\ndelicate and as finely wrought. The colour of her skin was so tender that\r\nit reminded you vaguely of all beautiful soft things, the radiance of\r\nsunset and the darkness of the night, the heart of roses and the depth of\r\nrunning water. The goddess\'s hand was raised to her right shoulder, and\r\nMargaret\'s hand was as small, as dainty, and as white.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be so foolish,\' said she, as Arthur looked silently at the statue.\r\n\r\nHe turned his eyes slowly, and they rested upon her. She saw that they\r\nwere veiled with tears.\r\n\r\n\'What on earth\'s the matter?\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish you weren\'t so beautiful,\' he answered, awkwardly, as though he\r\ncould scarcely bring himself to say such foolish things. \'I\'m so afraid\r\nthat something will happen to prevent us from being happy. It seems too\r\nmuch to expect that I should enjoy such extraordinarily good luck.\'\r\n\r\nShe had the imagination to see that it meant much for the practical man\r\nso to express himself. Love of her drew him out of his character, and,\r\nthough he could not resist, he resented the effect it had on him. She\r\nfound nothing to reply, but she took his hand.\r\n\r\n\'Everything has gone pretty well with me so far,\' he said, speaking\r\nalmost to himself. \'Whenever I\'ve really wanted anything, I\'ve managed to\r\nget it. I don\'t see why things should go against me now.\'\r\n\r\nHe was trying to reassure himself against an instinctive suspicion of the\r\nmalice of circumstances. But he shook himself and straightened his back.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s stupid to be so morbid as that,\' he muttered.\r\n\r\nMargaret laughed. They walked out of the gallery and turned to the quay.\r\nBy crossing the bridge and following the river, they must come eventually\r\nto Dr. Porhoet\'s house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Susie wandered down the Boulevard Saint Michel, alert with the\r\nSunday crowd, to that part of Paris which was dearest to her heart. L\'Ile\r\nSaint Louis to her mind offered a synthesis of the French spirit, and it\r\npleased her far more than the garish boulevards in which the English as a\r\nrule seek for the country\'s fascination. Its position on an island in\r\nthe Seine gave it a compact charm. The narrow streets, with their array\r\nof dainty comestibles, had the look of streets in a provincial town. They\r\nhad a quaintness which appealed to the fancy, and they were very restful.\r\nThe names of the streets recalled the monarchy that passed away in\r\nbloodshed, and in _poudre de riz_. The very plane trees had a greater\r\nsobriety than elsewhere, as though conscious they stood in a Paris where\r\nprogress was not. In front was the turbid Seine, and below, the twin\r\ntowers of Notre Dame. Susie could have kissed the hard paving stones of\r\nthe quay. Her good-natured, plain face lit up as she realized the delight\r\nof the scene upon which her eyes rested; and it was with a little pang,\r\nher mind aglow with characters and events from history and from fiction,\r\nthat she turned away to enter Dr Porhoet\'s house.\r\n\r\nShe was pleased that the approach did not clash with her fantasies. She\r\nmounted a broad staircase, dark but roomy, and, at the command of the\r\n_concierge_, rang a tinkling bell at one of the doorways that faced her.\r\nDr Porhoet opened in person..\r\n\r\n\'Arthur and Mademoiselle are already here,\' he said, as he led her in.\r\n\r\nThey went through a prim French dining-room, with much woodwork and heavy\r\nscarlet hangings, to the library. This was a large room, but the\r\nbookcases that lined the walls, and a large writing-table heaped up with\r\nbooks, much diminished its size. There were books everywhere. They were\r\nstacked on the floor and piled on every chair. There was hardly space to\r\nmove. Susie gave a cry of delight.\r\n\r\n\'Now you mustn\'t talk to me. I want to look at all your books.\'\r\n\r\n\'You could not please me more,\' said Dr Porhoet, \'but I am afraid they\r\nwill disappoint you. They are of many sorts, but I fear there are few\r\nthat will interest an English young lady.\'\r\n\r\nHe looked about his writing-table till he found a packet of cigarettes.\r\nHe gravely offered one to each of his guests. Susie was enchanted with\r\nthe strange musty smell of the old books, and she took a first glance at\r\nthem in general. For the most part they were in paper bindings, some of\r\nthem neat enough, but more with broken backs and dingy edges; they were\r\nset along the shelves in serried rows, untidily, without method or plan.\r\nThere were many older ones also in bindings of calf and pigskin, treasure\r\nfrom half the bookshops in Europe; and there were huge folios like\r\nPrussian grenadiers; and tiny Elzevirs, which had been read by patrician\r\nladies in Venice. Just as Arthur was a different man in the operating\r\ntheatre, Dr Porhoet was changed among his books. Though he preserved the\r\namiable serenity which made him always so attractive, he had there a\r\ndiverting brusqueness of demeanour which contrasted quaintly with his\r\nusual calm.\r\n\r\n\'I was telling these young people, when you came in, of an ancient Koran\r\nwhich I was given in Alexandria by a learned man whom I operated upon for\r\ncataract.\' He showed her a beautifully-written Arabic work, with\r\nwonderful capitals and headlines in gold. \'You know that it is almost\r\nimpossible for an infidel to acquire the holy book, and this is a\r\nparticularly rare copy, for it was written by Kait Bey, the greatest of\r\nthe Mameluke Sultans.\'\r\n\r\nHe handled the delicate pages as a lover of flowers would handle\r\nrose-leaves.\r\n\r\n\'And have you much literature on the occult sciences?\' asked Susie.\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet smiled.\r\n\r\n\'I venture to think that no private library contains so complete a\r\ncollection, but I dare not show it to you in the presence of our friend\r\nArthur. He is too polite to accuse me of foolishness, but his sarcastic\r\nsmile would betray him.\'\r\n\r\nSusie went to the shelves to which he vaguely waved, and looked with a\r\npeculiar excitement at the mysterious array. She ran her eyes along the\r\nnames. It seemed to her that she was entering upon an unknown region of\r\nromance. She felt like an adventurous princess who rode on her palfrey\r\ninto a forest of great bare trees and mystic silences, where wan,\r\nunearthly shapes pressed upon her way.\r\n\r\n\'I thought once of writing a life of that fantastic and grandiloquent\r\ncreature, Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast von\r\nHohenheim,\' said Dr Porhoet, \'and I have collected many of his books.\'\r\n\r\nHe took down a slim volume in duodecimo, printed in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, with queer plates, on which were all manner of cabbalistic\r\nsigns. The pages had a peculiar, musty odour. They were stained with\r\niron-mould.\r\n\r\n\'Here is one of the most interesting works concerning the black art.\r\nIt is the _Grimoire of Honorius_, and is the principal text-book of all\r\nthose who deal in the darkest ways of the science.\'\r\n\r\nThen he pointed out the _Hexameron_ of Torquemada and the _Tableau de\r\nl\'Inconstance des Demons_, by Delancre; he drew his finger down the\r\nleather back of Delrio\'s _Disquisitiones Magicae_ and set upright the\r\n_Pseudomonarchia Daemonorum_ of Wierus; his eyes rested for an instant on\r\nHauber\'s _Acta et Scripta Magica_, and he blew the dust carefully off the\r\nmost famous, the most infamous, of them all, Sprenger\'s _Malleus\r\nMalefikorum_.\r\n\r\n\'Here is one of my greatest treasures. It is the _Clavicula Salomonis_;\r\nand I have much reason to believe that it is the identical copy which\r\nbelonged to the greatest adventurer of the eighteenth century, Jacques\r\nCasanova. You will see that the owner\'s name had been cut out, but enough\r\nremains to indicate the bottom of the letters; and these correspond\r\nexactly with the signature of Casanova which I have found at the\r\nBibliotheque Nationale. He relates in his memoirs that a copy of this\r\nbook was seized among his effects when he was arrested in Venice for\r\ntraffic in the black arts; and it was there, on one of my journeys from\r\nAlexandria, that I picked it up.\'\r\n\r\nHe replaced the precious work, and his eye fell on a stout volume bound\r\nin vellum.\r\n\r\n\'I had almost forgotten the most wonderful, the most mysterious, of all\r\nthe books that treat of occult science. You have heard of the Kabbalah,\r\nbut I doubt if it is more than a name to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know nothing about it at all,\' laughed Susie, \'except that it\'s all\r\nvery romantic and extraordinary and ridiculous.\'\r\n\r\n\'This, then, is its history. Moses, who was learned in all the wisdom of\r\nEgypt, was first initiated into the Kabbalah in the land of his birth;\r\nbut became most proficient in it during his wanderings in the wilderness.\r\nHere he not only devoted the leisure hours of forty years to this\r\nmysterious science, but received lessons in it from an obliging angel. By\r\naid of it he was able to solve the difficulties which arose during his\r\nmanagement of the Israelites, notwithstanding the pilgrimages, wars, and\r\nmiseries of that most unruly nation. He covertly laid down the principles\r\nof the doctrine in the first four books of the Pentateuch, but withheld\r\nthem from Deuteronomy. Moses also initiated the Seventy Elders into these\r\nsecrets, and they in turn transmitted them from hand to hand. Of all who\r\nformed the unbroken line of tradition, David and Solomon were the most\r\ndeeply learned in the Kabbalah. No one, however, dared to write it down\r\ntill Schimeon ben Jochai, who lived in the time of the destruction of\r\nJerusalem; and after his death the Rabbi Eleazar, his son, and the Rabbi\r\nAbba, his secretary, collected his manuscripts and from them composed the\r\ncelebrated treatise called _Zohar_.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how much do you believe of this marvellous story?\' asked Arthur\r\nBurdon.\r\n\r\n\'Not a word,\' answered Dr Porhoet, with a smile. \'Criticism has shown\r\nthat _Zohar_ is of modern origin. With singular effrontery, it cites an\r\nauthor who is known to have lived during the eleventh century, mentions\r\nthe Crusades, and records events which occurred in the year of Our Lord\r\n1264. It was some time before 1291 that copies of _Zohar_ began to be\r\ncirculated by a Spanish Jew named Moses de Leon, who claimed to possess\r\nan autograph manuscript by the reputed author Schimeon ben Jochai. But\r\nwhen Moses de Leon was gathered to the bosom of his father Abraham, a\r\nwealthy Hebrew, Joseph de Avila, promised the scribe\'s widow, who had\r\nbeen left destitute, that his son should marry her daughter, to whom\r\nhe would pay a handsome dowry, if she would give him the original\r\nmanuscript from which these copies were made. But the widow (one can\r\nimagine with what gnashing of teeth) was obliged to confess that she had\r\nno such manuscript, for Moses de Leon had composed _Zohar_ out of his own\r\nhead, and written it with his own right hand.\'\r\n\r\nArthur got up to stretch his legs. He gave a laugh.\r\n\r\n\'I never know how much you really believe of all these things you tell\r\nus. You speak with such gravity that we are all taken in, and then it\r\nturns out that you\'ve been laughing at us.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear friend, I never know myself how much I believe,\' returned Dr\r\nPorhoet.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder if it is for the same reason that Mr Haddo puzzles us so much,\'\r\nsaid Susie.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, there you have a case that is really interesting,\' replied the\r\ndoctor. \'I assure you that, though I know him fairly intimately, I have\r\nnever been able to make up my mind whether he is an elaborate practical\r\njoker, or whether he is really convinced he has the wonderful powers to\r\nwhich he lays claim.\'\r\n\r\n\'We certainly saw things last night that were not quite normal,\' said\r\nSusie. \'Why had that serpent no effect on him though it was able to kill\r\nthe rabbit instantaneously? And how are you going to explain the violent\r\ntrembling of that horse, Mr. Burdon?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t explain it,\' answered Arthur, irritably, \'but I\'m not inclined\r\nto attribute to the supernatural everything that I can\'t immediately\r\nunderstand.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what there is about him that excites in me a sort of\r\nhorror,\' said Margaret. \'I\'ve never taken such a sudden dislike to\r\nanyone.\'\r\n\r\nShe was too reticent to say all she felt, but she had been strangely\r\naffected last night by the recollection of Haddo\'s words and of his acts.\r\nShe had awakened more than once from a nightmare in which he assumed\r\nfantastic and ghastly shapes. His mocking voice rang in her ears, and she\r\nseemed still to see that vast bulk and the savage, sensual face. It was\r\nlike a spirit of evil in her path, and she was curiously alarmed. Only\r\nher reliance on Arthur\'s common sense prevented her from giving way to\r\nridiculous terrors.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve written to Frank Hurrell and asked him to tell me all he knows\r\nabout him,\' said Arthur. \'I should get an answer very soon.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish we\'d never come across him,\' cried Margaret vehemently. \'I feel\r\nthat he will bring us misfortune.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re all of you absurdly prejudiced,\' answered Susie gaily. \'He\r\ninterests me enormously, and I mean to ask him to tea at the studio.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I shall be delighted to come.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret cried out, for she recognized Oliver Haddo\'s deep bantering\r\ntones; and she turned round quickly. They were all so taken aback that\r\nfor a moment no one spoke. They were gathered round the window and had\r\nnot heard him come in. They wondered guiltily how long he had been there\r\nand how much he had heard.\r\n\r\n\'How on earth did you get here?\' cried Susie lightly, recovering herself\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\'No well-bred sorcerer is so dead to the finer feelings as to enter a\r\nroom by the door,\' he answered, with his puzzling smile. \'You were\r\nstanding round the window, and I thought it would startle you if I chose\r\nthat mode of ingress, so I descended with incredible skill down the\r\nchimney.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see a little soot on your left elbow,\' returned Susie. \'I hope you\r\nweren\'t at all burned.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not at all, thanks,\' he answered, gravely brushing his coat.\r\n\r\n\'In whatever way you came, you are very welcome,\' said Dr Porhoet,\r\ngenially holding out his hand.\r\n\r\nBut Arthur impatiently turned to his host.\r\n\r\n\'I wish I knew what made you engage upon these studies,\' he said. \'I\r\nshould have thought your medical profession protected you from any\r\ntenderness towards superstition.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\'I have always been interested in the oddities of mankind. At one time\r\nI read a good deal of philosophy and a good deal of science, and I\r\nlearned in that way that nothing was certain. Some people, by the pursuit\r\nof science, are impressed with the dignity of man, but I was only made\r\nconscious of his insignificance. The greatest questions of all have been\r\nthreshed out since he acquired the beginnings of civilization and he\r\nis as far from a solution as ever. Man can know nothing, for his senses\r\nare his only means of knowledge, and they can give no certainty. There is\r\nonly one subject upon which the individual can speak with authority, and\r\nthat is his own mind, but even here he is surrounded with darkness. I\r\nbelieve that we shall always be ignorant of the matters which it most\r\nbehoves us to know, and therefore I cannot occupy myself with them. I\r\nprefer to set them all aside, and, since knowledge is unattainable, to\r\noccupy myself only with folly.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is a point of view I do not sympathize with,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'Yet I cannot be sure that it is all folly,\' pursued the Frenchman\r\nreflectively. He looked at Arthur with a certain ironic gravity. \'Do\r\nyou believe that I should lie to you when I promised to speak the truth?\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly not.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like to tell you of an experience that I once had in\r\nAlexandria. So far as I can see, it can be explained by none of the\r\nprinciples known to science. I ask you only to believe that I am not\r\nconsciously deceiving you.\'\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a seriousness which gave authority to his words. It was\r\nplain, even to Arthur, that he narrated the event exactly as it occurred.\r\n\r\n\'I had heard frequently of a certain shiekh who was able by means of a\r\nmagic mirror to show the inquirer persons who were absent or dead, and a\r\nnative friend of mine had often begged me to see him. I had never thought\r\nit worth while, but at last a time came when I was greatly troubled in\r\nmy mind. My poor mother was an old woman, a widow, and I had received no\r\nnews of her for many weeks. Though I wrote repeatedly, no answer reached\r\nme. I was very anxious and very unhappy. I thought no harm could come if\r\nI sent for the sorcerer, and perhaps after all he had the power which\r\nwas attributed to him. My friend, who was interpreter to the French\r\nConsulate, brought him to me one evening. He was a fine man, tall and\r\nstout, of a fair complexion, but with a dark brown beard. He was shabbily\r\ndressed, and, being a descendant of the Prophet, wore a green turban. In\r\nhis conversation he was affable and unaffected. I asked him what persons\r\ncould see in the magic mirror, and he said they were a boy not arrived at\r\npuberty, a virgin, a black female slave, and a pregnant woman. In order\r\nto make sure that there was no collusion, I despatched my servant to an\r\nintimate friend and asked him to send me his son. While we waited, I\r\nprepared by the magician\'s direction frankincense and coriander-seed,\r\nand a chafing-dish with live charcoal. Meanwhile, he wrote forms of\r\ninvocation on six strips of paper. When the boy arrived, the sorcerer\r\nthrew incense and one of the paper strips into the chafing-dish, then\r\ntook the boy\'s right hand and drew a square and certain mystical marks on\r\nthe palm. In the centre of the square he poured a little ink. This formed\r\nthe magic mirror. He desired the boy to look steadily into it without\r\nraising his head. The fumes of the incense filled the room with smoke.\r\nThe sorcerer muttered Arabic words, indistinctly, and this he continued\r\nto do all the time except when he asked the boy a question.\r\n\r\n\'"Do you see anything in the ink?" he said.\r\n\r\n\'"No," the boy answered.\r\n\r\n\'But a minute later, he began to tremble and seemed very much frightened.\r\n\r\n\'"I see a man sweeping the ground," he said.\r\n\r\n\'"When he has done sweeping, tell me," said the sheikh.\r\n\r\n\'"He has done," said the boy.\r\n\r\n\'The sorcerer turned to me and asked who it was that I wished the boy\r\nshould see.\r\n\r\n\'"I desire to see the widow Jeanne-Marie Porhoet."\r\n\r\n\'The magician put the second and third of the small strips of paper into\r\nthe chafing-dish, and fresh frankincense was added. The fumes were\r\npainful to my eyes. The boy began to speak.\r\n\r\n\'"I see an old woman lying on a bed. She has a black dress, and on her\r\nhead is a little white cap. She has a wrinkled face and her eyes are\r\nclosed. There is a band tied round her chin. The bed is in a sort of\r\nhole, in the wall, and there are shutters to it."\r\n\r\nThe boy was describing a Breton bed, and the white cap was the _coiffe_\r\nthat my mother wore. And if she lay there in her black dress, with a band\r\nabout her chin, I knew that it could mean but one thing.\r\n\r\n\'"What else does he see?" I asked the sorcerer.\r\n\r\n\'He repeated my question, and presently the boy spoke again.\r\n\r\n\'"I see four men come in with a long box. And there are women crying.\r\nThey all wear little white caps and black dresses. And I see a man in a\r\nwhite surplice, with a large cross in his hands, and a little boy in a\r\nlong red gown. And the men take off their hats. And now everyone is\r\nkneeling down."\r\n\r\n\'"I will hear no more," I said. "It is enough."\r\n\r\n\'I knew that my mother was dead.\r\n\r\n\'In a little while, I received a letter from the priest of the village in\r\nwhich she lived. They had buried her on the very day upon which the boy\r\nhad seen this sight in the mirror of ink.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet passed his hand across his eyes, and for a little while there\r\nwas silence.\r\n\r\n\'What have you to say to that?\' asked Oliver Haddo, at last.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing,\' answered Arthur.\r\n\r\nHaddo looked at him for a minute with those queer eyes of his which\r\nseemed to stare at the wall behind.\r\n\r\n\'Have you ever heard of Eliphas Levi?\' he inquired. \'He is the most\r\ncelebrated occultist of recent years. He is thought to have known more\r\nof the mysteries than any adept since the divine Paracelsus.\'\r\n\r\n\'I met him once,\' interrupted Dr Porhoet. \'You never saw a man who looked\r\nless like a magician. His face beamed with good-nature, and he wore a\r\nlong grey beard, which covered nearly the whole of his breast. He was of\r\na short and very corpulent figure.\'\r\n\r\n\'The practice of black arts evidently disposes to obesity,\' said Arthur,\r\nicily.\r\n\r\nSusie noticed that this time Oliver Haddo made no sign that the taunt\r\nmoved him. His unwinking, straight eyes remained upon Arthur without\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\'Levi\'s real name was Alphonse-Louis Constant, but he adopted that under\r\nwhich he is generally known for reasons that are plain to the romantic\r\nmind. His father was a bootmaker. He was destined for the priesthood, but\r\nfell in love with a damsel fair and married her. The union was unhappy.\r\nA fate befell him which has been the lot of greater men than he, and his\r\nwife presently abandoned the marital roof with her lover. To console\r\nhimself he began to make serious researches in the occult, and in due\r\ncourse published a vast number of mystical works dealing with magic in\r\nall its branches.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure Mr Haddo was going to tell us something very interesting about\r\nhim,\' said Susie.\r\n\r\n\'I wished merely to give you his account of how he raised the spirit of\r\nApollonius of Tyana in London.\'\r\n\r\nSusie settled herself more comfortably in her chair and lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\'He went there in the spring of 1856 to escape from internal disquietude\r\nand to devote himself without distraction to his studies. He had letters\r\nof introduction to various persons of distinction who concerned\r\nthemselves with the supernatural, but, finding them trivial and\r\nindifferent, he immersed himself in the study of the supreme Kabbalah.\r\nOne day, on returning to his hotel, he found a note in his room. It\r\ncontained half a card, transversely divided, on which he at once\r\nrecognized the character of Solomon\'s Seal, and a tiny slip of paper on\r\nwhich was written in pencil: _The other half of this card will be given\r\nyou at three o\'clock tomorrow in front of Westminster Abbey_. Next day,\r\ngoing to the appointed spot, with his portion of the card in his hand, he\r\nfound a baronial equipage waiting for him. A footman approached, and,\r\nmaking a sign to him, opened the carriage door. Within was a lady in\r\nblack satin, whose face was concealed by a thick veil. She motioned him\r\nto a seat beside her, and at the same time displayed the other part of\r\nthe card he had received. The door was shut, and the carriage rolled\r\naway. When the lady raised her veil, Eliphas Levi saw that she was of\r\nmature age; and beneath her grey eyebrows were bright black eyes of\r\npreternatural fixity.\'\r\n\r\nSusie Boyd clapped her hands with delight.\r\n\r\n\'I think it\'s delicious, and I\'m sure every word of it is true,\' she\r\ncried. \'I\'m enchanted with the mysterious meeting at Westminster Abbey\r\nin the Mid-Victorian era. Can\'t you see the elderly lady in a huge\r\ncrinoline and a black poke bonnet, and the wizard in a ridiculous hat,\r\na bottle-green frock-coat, and a flowing tie of black silk?\'\r\n\r\n\'Eliphas remarks that the lady spoke French with a marked English\r\naccent,\' pursued Haddo imperturbably. \'She addressed him as follows:\r\n"Sir, I am aware that the law of secrecy is rigorous among adepts; and I\r\nknow that you have been asked for phenomena, but have declined to gratify\r\na frivolous curiosity. It is possible that you do not possess the\r\nnecessary materials. I can show you a complete magical cabinet, but I\r\nmust require of you first the most inviolable silence. If you do not\r\nguarantee this on your honour, I will give the order for you to be driven\r\nhome."\'\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo told his story not ineffectively, but with a comic gravity\r\nthat prevented one from knowing exactly how to take it.\r\n\r\n\'Having given the required promise Eliphas Levi was shown a collection of\r\nvestments and of magical instruments. The lady lent him certain books of\r\nwhich he was in need; and at last, as a result of many conversations,\r\ndetermined him to attempt at her house the experience of a complete\r\nevocation. He prepared himself for twenty-one days, scrupulously\r\nobserving the rules laid down by the Ritual. At length everything\r\nwas ready. It was proposed to call forth the phantom of the divine\r\nApollonius, and to question it upon two matters, one of which concerned\r\nEliphas Levi and the other, the lady of the crinoline. She had at first\r\ncounted on assisting at the evocation with a trustworthy person, but at\r\nthe last moment her friend drew back; and as the triad or unity is\r\nrigorously prescribed in magical rites, Eliphas was left alone. The\r\ncabinet prepared for the experiment was situated in a turret. Four\r\nconcave mirrors were hung within it, and there was an altar of white\r\nmarble, surrounded by a chain of magnetic iron. On it was engraved\r\nthe sign of the Pentagram, and this symbol was drawn on the new, white\r\nsheepskin which was stretched beneath. A copper brazier stood on the\r\naltar, with charcoal of alder and of laurel wood, and in front a second\r\nbrazier was placed upon a tripod. Eliphas Levi was clothed in a white\r\nrobe, longer and more ample than the surplice of a priest, and he wore\r\nupon his head a chaplet of vervain leaves entwined about a golden chain.\r\nIn one hand he held a new sword and in the other the Ritual.\'\r\n\r\nSusie\'s passion for caricature at once asserted itself, and she laughed\r\nas she saw in fancy the portly little Frenchman, with his round, red\r\nface, thus wonderfully attired.\r\n\r\n\'He set alight the two fires with the prepared materials, and began, at\r\nfirst in a low voice, but rising by degrees, the invocations of the\r\nRitual. The flames invested every object with a wavering light. Presently\r\nthey went out. He set more twigs and perfumes on the brazier, and when\r\nthe flame started up once more, he saw distinctly before the altar a\r\nhuman figure larger than life, which dissolved and disappeared. He began\r\nthe invocations again and placed himself in a circle, which he had\r\nalready traced between the altar and the tripod. Then the depth of the\r\nmirror which was in front of him grew brighter by degrees, and a pale\r\nform arose, and it seemed gradually to approach. He closed his eyes, and\r\ncalled three times upon Apollonius. When he opened them, a man stood\r\nbefore him, wholly enveloped in a winding sheet, which seemed more grey\r\nthan black. His form was lean, melancholy, and beardless. Eliphas felt an\r\nintense cold, and when he sought to ask his questions found it impossible\r\nto speak. Thereupon, he placed his hand on the Pentagram, and directed\r\nthe point of his sword toward the figure, adjuring it mentally by that\r\nsign not to terrify, but to obey him. The form suddenly grew indistinct\r\nand soon it strangely vanished. He commanded it to return, and then felt,\r\nas it were, an air pass by him; and, something having touched the hand\r\nwhich held the sword, his arm was immediately benumbed as far as the\r\nshoulder. He supposed that the weapon displeased the spirit, and set it\r\ndown within the circle. The human figure at once reappeared, but Eliphas\r\nexperienced such a sudden exhaustion in all his limbs that he was obliged\r\nto sit down. He fell into a deep coma, and dreamed strange dreams. But of\r\nthese, when he recovered, only a vague memory remained to him. His arm\r\ncontinued for several days to be numb and painful. The figure had not\r\nspoken, but it seemed to Eliphas Levi that the questions were answered in\r\nhis own mind. For to each an inner voice replied with one grim word:\r\ndead.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your friend seems to have had as little fear of spooks as you have\r\nof lions,\' said Burdon. \'To my thinking it is plain that all these\r\npreparations, and the perfumes, the mirrors, the pentagrams, must have\r\nthe greatest effect on the imagination. My only surprise is that your\r\nmagician saw no more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Eliphas Levi talked to me himself of this evocation,\' said Dr Porhoet.\r\n\'He told me that its influence on him was very great. He was no longer\r\nthe same man, for it seemed to him that something from the world beyond\r\nhad passed into his soul.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am astonished that you should never have tried such an interesting\r\nexperiment yourself,\' said Arthur to Oliver Haddo.\r\n\r\n\'I have,\' answered the other calmly. \'My father lost his power of speech\r\nshortly before he died, and it was plain that he sought with all his\r\nmight to tell me something. A year after his death, I called up his\r\nphantom from the grave so that I might learn what I took to be a dying\r\nwish. The circumstances of the apparition are so similar to those I have\r\njust told you that it would only bore you if I repeated them. The only\r\ndifference was that my father actually spoke.\'\r\n\r\n\'What did he say?\' asked Susie.\r\n\r\n\'He said solemnly: "_Buy Ashantis, they are bound to go up._"\r\n\r\n\'I did as he told me; but my father was always unlucky in speculation,\r\nand they went down steadily. I sold out at considerable loss, and\r\nconcluded that in the world beyond they are as ignorant of the tendency\r\nof the Stock Exchange as we are in this vale of sorrow.\'\r\n\r\nSusie could not help laughing. But Arthur shrugged his shoulders\r\nimpatiently. It disturbed his practical mind never to be certain if\r\nHaddo was serious, or if, as now, he was plainly making game of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Arthur received Frank Hurrell\'s answer to his letter. It\r\nwas characteristic of Frank that he should take such pains to reply at\r\nlength to the inquiry, and it was clear that he had lost none of his old\r\ninterest in odd personalities. He analysed Oliver Haddo\'s character with\r\nthe patience of a scientific man studying a new species in which he is\r\npassionately concerned.\r\n\r\nMy dear Burdon:\r\n\r\nIt is singular that you should write just now to ask what I know of\r\nOliver Haddo, since by chance I met the other night at dinner at Queen\r\nAnne\'s Gate a man who had much to tell me of him. I am curious to know\r\nwhy he excites your interest, for I am sure his peculiarities make him\r\nrepugnant to a person of your robust common sense. I can with difficulty\r\nimagine two men less capable of getting on together. Though I have not\r\nseen Haddo now for years, I can tell you, in one way and another, a good\r\ndeal about him. He erred when he described me as his intimate friend. It\r\nis true that at one time I saw much of him, but I never ceased cordially\r\nto dislike him. He came up to Oxford from Eton with a reputation for\r\nathletics and eccentricity. But you know that there is nothing that\r\narouses the ill-will of boys more than the latter, and he achieved an\r\nunpopularity which was remarkable. It turned out that he played football\r\nadmirably, and except for his rather scornful indolence he might easily\r\nhave got his blue. He sneered at the popular enthusiasm for games, and\r\nwas used to say that cricket was all very well for boys but not fit for\r\nthe pastime of men. (He was then eighteen!) He talked grandiloquently of\r\nbig-game shooting and of mountain climbing as sports which demanded\r\ncourage and self-reliance. He seemed, indeed, to like football, but he\r\nplayed it with a brutal savagery which the other persons concerned\r\nnaturally resented. It became current opinion in other pursuits that he\r\ndid not play the game. He did nothing that was manifestly unfair, but was\r\ncapable of taking advantages which most people would have thought mean;\r\nand he made defeat more hard to bear because he exulted over the\r\nvanquished with the coarse banter that youths find so difficult to\r\nendure.\r\n\r\nWhat you would hardly believe is that, when he first came up, he was a\r\nperson of great physical attractions. He is now grown fat, but in those\r\ndays was extremely handsome. He reminded one of those colossal statues\r\nof Apollo in which the god is represented with a feminine roundness\r\nand delicacy. He was very tall and had a magnificent figure. It was\r\nso well-formed for his age that one might have foretold his precious\r\ncorpulence. He held himself with a dashing erectness. Many called it an\r\ninsolent swagger. His features were regular and fine. He had a great\r\nquantity of curling hair, which was worn long, with a sort of poetic\r\ngrace: I am told that now he is very bald; and I can imagine that this\r\nmust be a great blow to him, for he was always exceedingly vain. I\r\nremember a peculiarity of his eyes, which could scarcely have been\r\nnatural, but how it was acquired I do not know. The eyes of most people\r\nconverge upon the object at which they look, but his remained parallel.\r\nIt gave them a singular expression, as though he were scrutinising the\r\ninmost thought of the person with whom he talked. He was notorious also\r\nfor the extravagance of his costume, but, unlike the aesthetes of that\r\nday, who clothed themselves with artistic carelessness, he had a taste\r\nfor outrageous colours. Sometimes, by a queer freak, he dressed himself\r\nat unseasonable moments with excessive formality. He is the only\r\nundergraduate I have ever seen walk down the High in a tall hat and a\r\nclosely-buttoned frock-coat.\r\n\r\nI have told you he was very unpopular, but it was not an unpopularity\r\nof the sort which ignores a man and leaves him chiefly to his own\r\nsociety. Haddo knew everybody and was to be found in the most unlikely\r\nplaces. Though people disliked him, they showed a curious pleasure in his\r\ncompany, and he was probably entertained more than any man in Oxford. I\r\nnever saw him but he was surrounded by a little crowd, who abused him\r\nbehind his back, but could not resist his fascination.\r\n\r\nI often tried to analyse this, for I felt it as much as anyone, and\r\nthough I honestly could not bear him, I could never resist going to\r\nsee him whenever opportunity arose. I suppose he offered the charm\r\nof the unexpected to that mass of undergraduates who, for all their\r\nmatter-of-fact breeziness, are curiously alive to the romantic. It was\r\nimpossible to tell what he would do or say next, and you were kept\r\nperpetually on the alert. He was certainly not witty, but he had a coarse\r\nhumour which excited the rather gross sense of the ludicrous possessed by\r\nthe young. He had a gift for caricature which was really diverting, and\r\nan imperturbable assurance. He had also an ingenious talent for\r\nprofanity, and his inventiveness in this particular was a power among\r\nyouths whose imaginations stopped at the commoner sorts of bad language.\r\nI have heard him preach a sermon of the most blasphemous sort in the very\r\naccents of the late Dean of Christ Church, which outraged and at the same\r\ntime irresistibly amused everyone who heard it. He had a more varied\r\nknowledge than the greater part of undergraduates, and, having at the\r\nsame time a retentive memory and considerable quickness, he was able to\r\nassume an attitude of omniscience which was as impressive as it was\r\nirritating. I have never heard him confess that he had not read a book.\r\nOften, when I tried to catch him, he confounded me by quoting the\r\nidentical words of a passage in some work which I could have sworn he had\r\nnever set eyes on. I daresay it was due only to some juggling, like the\r\nconjuror\'s sleight of hand that apparently lets you choose a card, but in\r\nfact forces one on you; and he brought the conversation round cleverly to\r\na point when it was obvious I should mention a definite book. He talked\r\nvery well, with an entertaining flow of rather pompous language which\r\nmade the amusing things he said particularly funny. His passion for\r\neuphuism contrasted strikingly with the simple speech of those with whom\r\nhe consorted. It certainly added authority to what he said. He was proud\r\nof his family and never hesitated to tell the curious of his\r\ndistinguished descent. Unless he has much altered, you will already have\r\nheard of his relationship with various noble houses. He is, in fact,\r\nnearly connected with persons of importance, and his ancestry is no less\r\ndistinguished than he asserts. His father is dead, and he owns a place in\r\nStaffordshire which is almost historic. I have seen photographs of it,\r\nand it is certainly very fine. His forebears have been noted in the\r\nhistory of England since the days of the courtier who accompanied Anne of\r\nDenmark to Scotland, and, if he is proud of his stock, it is not without\r\ncause. So he passed his time at Oxford, cordially disliked, at the same\r\ntime respected and mistrusted; he had the reputation of a liar and a\r\nrogue, but it could not be denied that he had considerable influence over\r\nothers. He amused, angered, irritated, and interested everyone with whom\r\nhe came in contact. There was always something mysterious about him, and\r\nhe loved to wrap himself in a romantic impenetrability. Though he knew so\r\nmany people, no one knew him, and to the end he remained a stranger in\r\nour midst. A legend grew up around him, which he fostered sedulously, and\r\nit was reported that he had secret vices which could only be whispered\r\nwith bated breath. He was said to intoxicate himself with Oriental drugs,\r\nand to haunt the vilest opium-dens in the East of London. He kept the\r\ngreatest surprise for the last, since, though he was never seen to work,\r\nhe managed, to the universal surprise, to get a first. He went down, and\r\nto the best of my belief was never seen in Oxford again.\r\n\r\nI have heard vaguely that he was travelling over the world, and, when\r\nI met in town now and then some of the fellows who had known him at the\r\n\'Varsity, weird rumours reached me. One told me that he was tramping\r\nacross America, earning his living as he went; another asserted that he\r\nhad been seen in a monastry in India; a third assured me that he had\r\nmarried a ballet-girl in Milan; and someone else was positive that he\r\nhad taken to drink. One opinion, however, was common to all my\r\ninformants, and this was that he did something out of the common. It\r\nwas clear that he was not the man to settle down to the tame life of a\r\ncountry gentleman which his position and fortune indicated. At last I met\r\nhim one day in Piccadilly, and we dined together at the Savoy. I hardly\r\nrecognized him, for he was become enormously stout, and his hair had\r\nalready grown thin. Though he could not have been more than twenty-five,\r\nhe looked considerably older. I tried to find out what he had been up to,\r\nbut, with the air of mystery he affects, he would go into no details. He\r\ngave me to understand that he had sojourned in lands where the white man\r\nhad never been before, and had learnt esoteric secrets which overthrew\r\nthe foundations of modern science. It seemed to me that he had coarsened\r\nin mind as well as in appearance. I do not know if it was due to my own\r\ndevelopment since the old days at Oxford, and to my greater knowledge of\r\nthe world, but he did not seem to me so brilliant as I remembered. His\r\nfacile banter was rather stupid. In fact he bored me. The pose which had\r\nseemed amusing in a lad fresh from Eton now was intolerable, and I was\r\nglad to leave him. It was characteristic that, after asking me to dinner,\r\nhe left me in a lordly way to pay the bill.\r\n\r\nThen I heard nothing of him till the other day, when our friend Miss Ley\r\nasked me to meet at dinner the German explorer Burkhardt. I dare say you\r\nremember that Burkhardt brought out a book a little while ago on his\r\nadventures in Central Asia. I knew that Oliver Haddo was his companion in\r\nthat journey and had meant to read it on this account, but, having been\r\nexcessively busy, had omitted to do so. I took the opportunity to ask the\r\nGerman about our common acquaintance, and we had a long talk. Burkhardt\r\nhad met him by chance at Mombasa in East Africa, where he was arranging\r\nan expedition after big game, and they agreed to go together. He told me\r\nthat Haddo was a marvellous shot and a hunter of exceptional ability.\r\nBurkhardt had been rather suspicious of a man who boasted so much of his\r\nattainments, but was obliged soon to confess that he boasted of nothing\r\nunjustly. Haddo has had an extraordinary experience, the truth of which\r\nBurkhardt can vouch for. He went out alone one night on the trail of\r\nthree lions and killed them all before morning with one shot each. I know\r\nnothing of these things, but from the way in which Burkhardt spoke, I\r\njudge it must be a unique occurrence. But, characteristically enough, no\r\none was more conscious than Haddo of the singularity of his feat, and he\r\nmade life almost insufferable for his fellow-traveller in consequence.\r\nBurkhardt assures me that Haddo is really remarkable in pursuit of big\r\ngame. He has a sort of instinct which leads him to the most unlikely\r\nplaces, and a wonderful feeling for country, whereby he can cut across,\r\nand head off animals whose spoor he has noticed. His courage is very\r\ngreat. To follow a wounded lion into thick cover is the most dangerous\r\nproceeding in the world, and demands the utmost coolness. The animal\r\ninvariably sees the sportsman before he sees it, and in most cases\r\ncharges. But Haddo never hesitated on these occasions, and Burkhardt\r\ncould only express entire admiration for his pluck. It appears that he is\r\nnot what is called a good sportsman. He kills wantonly, when there can be\r\nno possible excuse, for the mere pleasure of it; and to Burkhardt\'s\r\nindignation frequently shot beasts whose skins and horns they did not\r\neven trouble to take. When antelope were so far off that it was\r\nimpossible to kill them, and the approach of night made it useless to\r\nfollow, he would often shoot, and leave a wretched wounded beast to die\r\nby inches. His selfishness was extreme, and he never shared any\r\ninformation with his friend that might rob him of an uninterrupted\r\npursuit of game. But notwithstanding all this, Burkhardt had so high an\r\nopinion of Haddo\'s general capacity and of his resourcefulness that, when\r\nhe was arranging his journey in Asia, he asked him to come also. Haddo\r\nconsented, and it appears that Burkhardt\'s book gives further proof, if\r\nit is needed, of the man\'s extraordinary qualities. The German confessed\r\nthat on more than one occasion he owed his life to Haddo\'s rare power\r\nof seizing opportunities. But they quarrelled at last through Haddo\'s\r\nover-bearing treatment of the natives. Burkhardt had vaguely suspected\r\nhim of cruelty, but at length it was clear that he used them in a manner\r\nwhich could not be defended. Finally he had a desperate quarrel with one\r\nof the camp servants, as a result of which the man was shot dead. Haddo\r\nswore that he fired in self-defence, but his action caused a general\r\ndesertion, and the travellers found themselves in a very dangerous\r\npredicament. Burkhardt thought that Haddo was clearly to blame and\r\nrefused to have anything more to do with him. They separated. Burkhardt\r\nreturned to England; and Haddo, pursued by the friends of the murdered\r\nman, had great difficulty in escaping with his life. Nothing has been\r\nheard of him since till I got your letter.\r\n\r\nAltogether, an extraordinary man. I confess that I can make nothing of\r\nhim. I shall never be surprised to hear anything in connexion with him.\r\nI recommend you to avoid him like the plague. He can be no one\'s friend.\r\nAs an acquaintance he is treacherous and insincere; as an enemy, I can\r\nwell imagine that he would be as merciless as he is unscrupulous.\r\n\r\nAn immensely long letter!\r\n\r\nGoodbye, my son. I hope that your studies in French methods of surgery\r\nwill have added to your wisdom. Your industry edifies me, and I am sure\r\nthat you will eventually be a baronet and the President of the Royal\r\nCollege of Surgeons; and you shall relieve royal persons of their,\r\nvermiform appendix.\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\n\r\nFRANK HURRELL\r\n\r\nArthur, having read this letter twice, put it in an envelope and left it\r\nwithout comment for Miss Boyd. Her answer came within a couple of hours:\r\n\'I\'ve asked him to tea on Wednesday, and I can\'t put him off. You must\r\ncome and help us; but please be as polite to him as if, like most of us,\r\nhe had only taken mental liberties with the Ten Commandments.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the day upon which they had asked him to tea, Oliver\r\nHaddo left at Margaret\'s door vast masses of chrysanthemums. There were\r\nso many that the austere studio was changed in aspect. It gained an\r\nephemeral brightness that Margaret, notwithstanding pieces of silk hung\r\nhere and there on the walls, had never been able to give it. When Arthur\r\narrived, he was dismayed that the thought had not occurred to him.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m so sorry,\' he said. \'You must think me very inconsiderate.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret smiled and held his hand.\r\n\r\n\'I think I like you because you don\'t trouble about the common little\r\nattentions of lovers.\'\r\n\r\n\'Margaret\'s a wise girl,\' smiled Susie. \'She knows that when a man sends\r\nflowers it is a sign that he has admired more women than one.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t suppose that these were sent particularly to me.\'\r\n\r\nArthur Burdon sat down and observed with pleasure the cheerful fire. The\r\ndrawn curtains and the lamps gave the place a nice cosiness, and there\r\nwas the peculiar air of romance which is always in a studio. There is a\r\nsense of freedom about it that disposes the mind to diverting\r\nspeculations. In such an atmosphere it is possible to be serious without\r\npompousness and flippant without inanity.\r\n\r\nIn the few days of their acquaintance Arthur and Susie had arrived at\r\nterms of pleasant familiarity. Susie, from her superior standpoint of an\r\nunmarried woman no longer young, used him with the good-natured banter\r\nwhich she affected. To her, he was a foolish young thing in love, and she\r\nmarvelled that even the cleverest man in that condition could behave\r\nlike a perfect idiot. But Margaret knew that, if her friend chaffed him,\r\nit was because she completely approved of him. As their intimacy\r\nincreased, Susie learnt to appreciate his solid character. She admired\r\nhis capacity in dealing with matters that were in his province, and the\r\nsimplicity with which he left alone those of which he was ignorant. There\r\nwas no pose in him. She was touched also by an ingenuous candour which\r\ngave a persuasive charm to his abruptness. And, though she set a plain\r\nwoman\'s value on good looks, his appearance, rough hewn like a statue in\r\nporphyry, pleased her singularly. It was an index of his character. The\r\nlook of him gave you the whole man, strong yet gentle, honest and simple,\r\nneither very imaginative nor very brilliant, but immensely reliable and\r\ntrustworthy to the bottom of his soul. He was seated now with Margaret\'s\r\nterrier on his knees, stroking its ears, and Susie, looking at him,\r\nwondered with a little pang why no man like that had even cared for her.\r\nIt was evident that he would make a perfect companion, and his love, once\r\nwon, was of the sort that did not alter.\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet came in and sat down with the modest quietness which was one\r\nof his charms. He was not a great talker and loved most to listen in\r\nsilence to the chatter of young people. The dog jumped down from Arthur\'s\r\nknee, went up to the doctor, and rubbed itself in friendly fashion\r\nagainst his legs. They began to talk in the soft light and had forgotten\r\nalmost that another guest was expected. Margaret hoped fervently that he\r\nwould not come. She had never looked more lovely than on this afternoon,\r\nand she busied herself with the preparations for tea with a housewifely\r\ngrace that added a peculiar delicacy to her comeliness. The dignity which\r\nencompassed the perfection of her beauty was delightfully softened, so\r\nthat you were reminded of those sweet domestic saints who lighten here\r\nand there the passionate records of the Golden Book.\r\n\r\n\'_C\'est tellement intime ici_,\' smiled Dr Porhoet, breaking into French\r\nin the impossibility of expressing in English the exact feeling which\r\nthat scene gave him.\r\n\r\nIt might have been a picture by some master of _genre_. It seemed hardly\r\nby chance that the colours arranged themselves in such agreeable tones,\r\nor that the lines of the wall and the seated persons achieved such a\r\ngraceful decoration. The atmosphere was extraordinarily peaceful.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door, and Arthur got up to open. The terrier\r\nfollowed at his heels. Oliver Haddo entered. Susie watched to see what\r\nthe dog would do and was by this time not surprised to see a change\r\ncome over it. With its tail between its legs, the friendly little beast\r\nslunk along the wall to the furthermost corner. It turned a suspicious,\r\nfrightened eye upon Haddo and then hid its head. The visitor, intent upon\r\nhis greetings, had not noticed even that there was an animal in the room.\r\nHe accepted with a simple courtesy they hardly expected from him the\r\nyoung woman\'s thanks for his flowers. His behaviour surprised them. He\r\nput aside his poses. He seemed genuinely to admire the cosy little\r\nstudio. He asked Margaret to show him her sketches and looked at them\r\nwith unassumed interest. His observations were pointed and showed a\r\ncertain knowledge of what he spoke about. He described himself as an\r\namateur, that object of a painter\'s derision: the man \'who knows what he\r\nlikes\'; but his criticism, though generous, showed that he was no fool.\r\nThe two women were impressed. Putting the sketches aside, he began to\r\ntalk, of the many places he had seen. It was evident that he sought to\r\nplease. Susie began to understand how it was that, notwithstanding\r\nhis affectations, he had acquired so great an influence over the\r\nundergraduates of Oxford. There was romance and laughter in his\r\nconversation; and though, as Frank Hurrell had said, lacking in wit,\r\nhe made up for it with a diverting pleasantry that might very well have\r\npassed for humour. But Susie, though amused, felt that this was not the\r\npurpose for which she had asked him to come. Dr Porhoet had lent her\r\nhis entertaining work on the old alchemists, and this gave her a chance\r\nto bring their conversation to matters on which Haddo was expert. She had\r\nread the book with delight and, her mind all aflame with those strange\r\nhistories wherein fact and fancy were so wonderfully mingled, she was\r\neager to know more. The long toil in which so many had engaged, always to\r\nlose their fortunes, often to suffer persecution and torture, interested\r\nher no less than the accounts, almost authenticated, of those who had\r\nsucceeded in their extraordinary quest.\r\n\r\nShe turned to Dr Porhoet.\r\n\r\n\'You are a bold man to assert that now and then the old alchemists\r\nactually did make gold,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'I have not gone quite so far as that,\' he smiled. \'I assert merely that,\r\nif evidence as conclusive were offered of any other historical event, it\r\nwould be credited beyond doubt. We can disbelieve these circumstantial\r\ndetails only by coming to the conclusion beforehand that it is impossible\r\nthey should be true.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish you would write that life of Paracelsus which you suggest in your\r\npreface.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet, smiling shook his head.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think I shall ever do that now,\' he said. \'Yet he is the most\r\ninteresting of all the alchemists, for he offers the fascinating problem\r\nof an immensely complex character. It is impossible to know to what\r\nextent he was a charlatan and to what a man of serious science.\'\r\n\r\nSusie glanced at Oliver Haddo, who sat in silence, his heavy face in\r\nshadow, his eyes fixed steadily on the speaker. The immobility of that\r\nvast bulk was peculiar.\r\n\r\n\'His name is not so ridiculous as later associations have made it seem,\'\r\nproceeded the doctor, \'for he belonged to the celebrated family of\r\nBombast, and they were called Hohenheim after their ancient residence,\r\nwhich was a castle near Stuttgart in Wuertemberg. The most interesting\r\npart of his life is that which the absence of documents makes it\r\nimpossible accurately to describe. He travelled in Germany, Italy,\r\nFrance, the Netherlands, in Denmark, Sweden, and Russia. He went even to\r\nIndia. He was taken prisoner by the Tartars, and brought to the Great\r\nKhan, whose son he afterwards accompanied to Constantinople. The mind\r\nmust be dull indeed that is not thrilled by the thought of this wandering\r\ngenius traversing the lands of the earth at the most eventful date of the\r\nworld\'s history. It was at Constantinople that, according to a certain\r\n_aureum vellus_ printed at Rorschach in the sixteenth century, he\r\nreceived the philosopher\'s stone from Solomon Trismosinus. This person\r\npossessed also the _Universal Panacea_, and it is asserted that he was\r\nseen still alive by a French traveller at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Paracelsus then passed through the countries that border the\r\nDanube, and so reached Italy, where he served as a surgeon in the\r\nimperial army. I see no reason why he should not have been present at the\r\nbattle of Pavia. He collected information from physicians, surgeons and\r\nalchemists; from executioners, barbers, shepherds, Jews, gipsies,\r\nmidwives, and fortune-tellers; from high and low, from learned and\r\nvulgar. In the sketch I have given of his career in that volume you hold,\r\nI have copied out a few words of his upon the acquirement of knowledge\r\nwhich affect me with a singular emotion.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet took his book from Miss Boyd and opened it thoughtfully. He\r\nread out the fine passage from the preface of the _Paragranum_:\r\n\r\n\'I went in search of my art, often incurring danger of life. I have not\r\nbeen ashamed to learn that which seemed useful to me even from vagabonds,\r\nhangmen, and barbers. We know that a lover will go far to meet the woman\r\nhe adores; how much more will the lover of Wisdom be tempted to go in\r\nsearch of his divine mistress.\'\r\n\r\nHe turned the page to find a few more lines further on:\r\n\r\n\'We should look for knowledge where we may expect to find it, and why\r\nshould a man be despised who goes in search of it? Those who remain at\r\nhome may grow richer and live more comfortably than those who wander; but\r\nI desire neither to live comfortably nor to grow rich.\'\r\n\r\n\'By Jove, those are fine words,\' said Arthur, rising to his feet.\r\n\r\nTheir brave simplicity moved him as no rhetoric could have done, and\r\nthey made him more eager still to devote his own life to the difficult\r\nacquisition of knowledge. Dr Porhoet gave him his ironic smile.\r\n\r\n\'Yet the man who could write that was in many ways a mere buffoon, who\r\npraised his wares with the vulgar glibness of a quack. He was vain and\r\nostentatious, intemperate and boastful. Listen:\r\n\r\n\'After me, O Avicenna, Galen, Rhases and Montagnana! After me, not I\r\nafter you, ye men of Paris, Montpellier, Meissen, and Cologne; all you\r\nthat come from the countries along the Danube and the Rhine, and you that\r\ncome from the islands of the sea. It is not for me to follow you, because\r\nmine is the lordship. The time will come when none of you shall remain in\r\nhis dark corner who will not be an object of contempt to the world,\r\nbecause I shall be the King, and the Monarchy will be mine.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet closed the book.\r\n\r\n\'Did you ever hear such gibberish in your life? Yet he did a bold thing.\r\nHe wrote in German instead of in Latin, and so, by weakening the old\r\nbelief in authority, brought about the beginning of free thought in\r\nscience. He continued to travel from place to place, followed by a crowd\r\nof disciples, some times attracted to a wealthy city by hope of gain,\r\nsometimes journeying to a petty court at the invitation of a prince. His\r\nfolly and the malice of his rivals prevented him from remaining anywhere\r\nfor long. He wrought many wonderful cures. The physicians of Nuremberg\r\ndenounced him as a quack, a charlatan, and an impostor. To refute them he\r\nasked the city council to put under his care patients that had been\r\npronounced incurable. They sent him several cases of elephantiasis,\r\nand he cured them: testimonials to that effect may still be found in the\r\narchives of Nuremberg. He died as the result of a tavern brawl and was\r\nburied at Salzburg. Tradition says that, his astral body having already\r\nduring physical existence become self-conscious, he is now a living\r\nadept, residing with others of his sort in a certain place in Asia. From\r\nthere he still influences the minds of his followers and at times even\r\nappears to them in visible and tangible substance.\'\r\n\r\n\'But look here,\' said Arthur, \'didn\'t Paracelsus, like most of these old\r\nfellows, in the course of his researches make any practical discoveries?\'\r\n\r\n\'I prefer those which were not practical,\' confessed the doctor, with\r\na smile. \'Consider for example the _Tinctura Physicorum_, which neither\r\nPope nor Emperor could buy with all his wealth. It was one of the\r\ngreatest alchemical mysteries, and, though mentioned under the name\r\nof _The Red Lion_ in many occult works, was actually known to few\r\nbefore Paracelsus, except Hermes Trismegistus and Albertus Magnus. Its\r\npreparation was extremely difficult, for the presence was needed of two\r\nperfectly harmonious persons whose skill was equal. It was said to be a\r\nred ethereal fluid. The least wonderful of its many properties was its\r\npower to transmute all inferior metals into gold. There is an old church\r\nin the south of Bavaria where the tincture is said to be still buried in\r\nthe ground. In the year 1698 some of it penetrated through the soil, and\r\nthe phenomenon was witnessed by many people, who believed it to be a\r\nmiracle. The church which was thereupon erected is still a well-known\r\nplace for pilgrimage. Paracelsus concludes his directions for its\r\nmanufacture with the words: _But if this be incomprehensible to you,\r\nremember that only he who desires with his whole heart will find, and to\r\nhim only who knocks vehemently shall the door be opened_.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall never try to make it,\' smiled Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'Then there was the _Electrum Magicum_, of which the wise made mirrors\r\nwherein they were able to see not only the events of the past and of the\r\npresent, but the doings of men in daytime and at night. They might see\r\nanything that had been written or spoken, and the person who said it,\r\nand the causes that made him say it. But I like best the _Primum Ens\r\nMelissae_. An elaborate prescription is given for its manufacture. It was\r\na remedy to prolong life, and not only Paracelsus, but his predecessors\r\nGalen, Arnold of Villanova, and Raymond Lulli, had laboured studiously to\r\ndiscover it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will it make me eighteen again?\' cried Susie.\r\n\r\n\'It is guaranteed to do so,\' answered Dr Porhoet gravely. \'Lesebren, a\r\nphysician to Louis XIV, gives an account of certain experiments witnessed\r\nby himself. It appears that one of his friends prepared the remedy, and\r\nhis curiosity would not let him rest until he had seen with his own eyes\r\nthe effect of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is the true scientific attitude,\' laughed Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'He took every morning at sunrise a glass of white wine tinctured with\r\nthis preparation; and after using it for fourteen days his nails began to\r\nfall out, without, however, causing him any pain. His courage failed him\r\nat this point, and he gave the same dose to an old female servant. She\r\nregained at least one of the characteristics of youth, much to her\r\nastonishment, for she did not know that she had been taking a medicine,\r\nand, becoming frightened, refused to continue. The experimenter then took\r\nsome grain, soaked it in the tincture, and gave it to an aged hen. On the\r\nsixth day the bird began to lose its feathers, and kept on losing them\r\ntill it was naked as a newborn babe; but before two weeks had passed\r\nother feathers grew, and these were more beautifully coloured than any\r\nthat fortunate hen had possessed in her youth. Her comb stood up, and she\r\nbegan again to lay eggs.\'\r\n\r\nArthur laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\'I confess I like that story much better than the others. The _Primum Ens\r\nMelissae_ at least offers a less puerile benefit than most magical\r\nsecrets.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you call the search for gold puerile?\' asked Haddo, who had been\r\nsitting for a long time in complete silence.\r\n\r\n\'I venture to call it sordid.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are very superior.\'\r\n\r\n\'Because I think the aims of mystical persons invariably gross or\r\ntrivial? To my plain mind, it is inane to raise the dead in order to hear\r\nfrom their phantom lips nothing but commonplaces. And I really cannot see\r\nthat the alchemist who spent his life in the attempted manufacture of\r\ngold was a more respectable object than the outside jobber of modern\r\ncivilization.\'\r\n\r\n\'But if he sought for gold it was for the power it gave him, and it was\r\npower he aimed at when he brooded night and day over dim secrets. Power\r\nwas the subject of all his dreams, but not a paltry, limited dominion\r\nover this or that; power over the whole world, power over all created\r\nthings, power over the very elements, power over God Himself. His lust\r\nwas so vast that he could not rest till the stars in their courses were\r\nobedient to his will.\'\r\n\r\nFor once Haddo lost his enigmatic manner. It was plain now that his words\r\nintoxicated him, and his face assumed a new, a strange, expression. A\r\npeculiar arrogance flashed in his shining eyes.\r\n\r\n\'And what else is it that men seek in life but power? If they want\r\nmoney, it is but for the power that attends it, and it is power again\r\nthat they strive for in all the knowledge they acquire. Fools and sots\r\naim at happiness, but men aim only at power. The magus, the sorcerer,\r\nthe alchemist, are seized with fascination of the unknown; and they\r\ndesire a greatness that is inaccessible to mankind. They think by the\r\nscience they study so patiently, but endurance and strength, by force of\r\nwill and by imagination, for these are the great weapons of the magician,\r\nthey may achieve at last a power with which they can face the God of\r\nHeaven Himself.\'\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo lifted his huge bulk from the low chair in which he had been\r\nsitting. He began to walk up and down the studio. It was curious to see\r\nthis heavy man, whose seriousness was always problematical, caught up by\r\na curious excitement.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve been talking of Paracelsus,\' he said. \'There is one of his\r\nexperiments which the doctor has withheld from you. You will find it\r\nneither mean nor mercenary, but it is very terrible. I do not know\r\nwhether the account of it is true, but it would be of extraordinary\r\ninterest to test it for oneself.\'\r\n\r\nHe looked round at the four persons who watched him intently. There was\r\na singular agitation in his manner, as though the thing of which he spoke\r\nwas very near his heart.\r\n\r\n\'The old alchemists believed in the possibility of spontaneous\r\ngeneration. By the combination of psychical powers and of strange\r\nessences, they claim to have created forms in which life became\r\nmanifest. Of these, the most marvellous were those strange beings,\r\nmale and female, which were called _homunculi_. The old philosophers\r\ndoubted the possibility of this operation, but Paracelsus asserts\r\npositively that it can be done. I picked up once for a song on a barrow\r\nat London Bridge a little book in German. It was dirty and thumbed,\r\nmany of the pages were torn, and the binding scarcely held the leaves\r\ntogether. It was called _Die Sphinx_ and was edited by a certain Dr Emil\r\nBesetzny. It contained the most extraordinary account I have ever read of\r\ncertain spirits generated by Johann-Ferdinand, Count von Kueffstein, in\r\nthe Tyrol, in 1775. The sources from which this account is taken consist\r\nof masonic manuscripts, but more especially of a diary kept by a certain\r\nJames Kammerer, who acted in the capacity of butler and famulus to the\r\nCount. The evidence is ten times stronger than any upon which men believe\r\nthe articles of their religion. If it related to less wonderful subjects,\r\nyou would not hesitate to believe implicitly every word you read. There\r\nwere ten _homunculi_--James Kammerer calls them prophesying spirits--kept\r\nin strong bottles, such as are used to preserve fruit, and these were\r\nfilled with water. They were made in five weeks, by the Count von\r\nKueffstein and an Italian mystic and rosicrucian, the Abbe Geloni. The\r\nbottles were closed with a magic seal. The spirits were about a span\r\nlong, and the Count was anxious that they should grow. They were\r\ntherefore buried under two cartloads of manure, and the pile daily\r\nsprinkled with a certain liquor prepared with great trouble by the\r\nadepts. The pile after such sprinklings began to ferment and steam, as\r\nif heated by a subterranean fire. When the bottles were removed, it was\r\nfound that the spirits had grown to about a span and a half each; the\r\nmale _homunculi_ were come into possession of heavy beards, and the nails\r\nof the fingers had grown. In two of the bottles there was nothing to be\r\nseen save clear water, but when the Abbe knocked thrice at the seal upon\r\nthe mouth, uttering at the same time certain Hebrew words, the water\r\nturned a mysterious colour, and the spirits showed their faces, very\r\nsmall at first, but growing in size till they attained that of a human\r\ncountenance. And this countenance was horrible and fiendish.\'\r\n\r\nHaddo spoke in a low voice that was hardly steady, and it was plain that\r\nhe was much moved. It appeared as if his story affected him so that he\r\ncould scarcely preserve his composure. He went on.\r\n\r\n\'These beings were fed every three days by the Count with a rose-coloured\r\nsubstance which was kept in a silver box. Once a week the bottles were\r\nemptied and filled again with pure rain-water. The change had to be made\r\nrapidly, because while the _homunculi_ were exposed to the air they\r\nclosed their eyes and seemed to grow weak and unconscious, as though they\r\nwere about to die. But with the spirits that were invisible, at certain\r\nintervals blood was poured into the water; and it disappeared at once,\r\ninexplicably, without colouring or troubling it. By some accident one of\r\nthe bottles fell one day and was broken. The _homunculus_ within died\r\nafter a few painful respirations in spite of all efforts to save him, and\r\nthe body was buried in the garden. An attempt to generate another, made\r\nby the Count without the assistance of the Abbe, who had left, failed; it\r\nproduced only a small thing like a leech, which had little vitality and\r\nsoon died.\'\r\n\r\nHaddo ceased speaking, and Arthur looked at him with amazement. \'But\r\ntaking for granted that the thing is possible, what on earth is the use\r\nof manufacturing these strange beasts?\' he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\'Use!\' cried Haddo passionately. \'What do you think would be man\'s\r\nsensations when he had solved the great mystery of existence, when he saw\r\nliving before him the substance which was dead? These _homunculi_ were\r\nseen by historical persons, by Count Max Lemberg, by Count Franz-Josef\r\nvon Thun, and by many others. I have no doubt that they were actually\r\ngenerated. But with our modern appliances, with our greater skill, what\r\nmight it not be possible to do now if we had the courage? There are\r\nchemists toiling away in their laboratories to create the primitive\r\nprotoplasm from matter which is dead, the organic from the inorganic. I\r\nhave studied their experiments. I know all that they know. Why shouldn\'t\r\none work on a larger scale, joining to the knowledge of the old adepts\r\nthe scientific discovery of the moderns? I don\'t know what would be the\r\nresult. It might be very strange and very wonderful. Sometimes my mind is\r\nverily haunted by the desire to see a lifeless substance move under my\r\nspells, by the desire to be as God.\'\r\n\r\nHe gave a low weird laugh, half cruel, half voluptuous. It made Margaret\r\nshudder with sudden fright. He had thrown himself down in the chair, and\r\nhe sat in complete shadow. By a singular effect his eyes appeared\r\nblood-red, and they stared into space, strangely parallel, with an\r\nintensity that was terrifying. Arthur started a little and gave him a\r\nsearching glance. The laugh and that uncanny glance, the unaccountable\r\nemotion, were extraordinarily significant. The whole thing was explained\r\nif Oliver Haddo was mad.\r\n\r\nThere was an uncomfortable silence. Haddo\'s words were out of tune\r\nwith the rest of the conversation. Dr Porhoet had spoken of magical\r\nthings with a sceptical irony that gave a certain humour to the subject,\r\nand Susie was resolutely flippant. But Haddo\'s vehemence put these\r\nincredulous people out of countenance. Dr Porhoet got up to go. He shook\r\nhands with Susie and with Margaret. Arthur opened the door for him. The\r\nkindly scholar looked round for Margaret\'s terrier...\r\n\r\n\'I must bid my farewells to your little dog.\'\r\n\r\nHe had been so quiet that they had forgotten his presence.\r\n\r\n\'Come here, Copper,\' said Margaret.\r\n\r\nThe dog slowly slunk up to them, and with a terrified expression crouched\r\nat Margaret\'s feet.\r\n\r\n\'What on earth\'s the matter with you?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s frightened of me,\' said Haddo, with that harsh laugh of his, which\r\ngave such an unpleasant impression.\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense!\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet bent down, stroked the dog\'s back, and shook its paw. Margaret\r\nlifted it up and set it on a table.\r\n\r\n\'Now, be good,\' she said, with lifted finger.\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet with a smile went out, and Arthur shut the door behind him.\r\nSuddenly, as though evil had entered into it, the terrier sprang at\r\nOliver Haddo and fixed its teeth in his hand. Haddo uttered a cry, and,\r\nshaking it off, gave it a savage kick. The dog rolled over with a loud\r\nbark that was almost a scream of pain, and lay still for a moment as if\r\nit were desperately hurt. Margaret cried out with horror and indignation.\r\nA fierce rage on a sudden seized Arthur so that he scarcely knew what he\r\nwas about. The wretched brute\'s suffering, Margaret\'s terror, his own\r\ninstinctive hatred of the man, were joined together in frenzied passion.\r\n\r\n\'You brute,\' he muttered.\r\n\r\nHe hit Haddo in the face with his clenched fist. The man collapsed\r\nbulkily to the floor, and Arthur, furiously seizing his collar, began\r\nto kick him with all his might. He shook him as a dog would shake a\r\nrat and then violently flung him down. For some reason Haddo made no\r\nresistance. He remained where he fell in utter helplessness. Arthur\r\nturned to Margaret. She was holding the poor hurt dog in her hands,\r\ncrying over it, and trying to comfort it in its pain. Very gently he\r\nexamined it to see if Haddo\'s brutal kick had broken a bone. They sat\r\ndown beside the fire. Susie, to steady her nerves, lit a cigarette. She\r\nwas horribly, acutely conscious of that man who lay in a mass on the\r\nfloor behind them. She wondered what he would do. She wondered why he did\r\nnot go. And she was ashamed of his humiliation. Then her heart stood\r\nstill; for she realized that he was raising himself to his feet, slowly,\r\nwith the difficulty of a very fat person. He leaned against the wall and\r\nstared at them. He remained there quite motionless. His stillness got on\r\nher nerves, and she could have screamed as she felt him look at them,\r\nlook with those unnatural eyes, whose expression now she dared not even\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\nAt last she could no longer resist the temptation to turn round just\r\nenough to see him. Haddo\'s eyes were fixed upon Margaret so intently\r\nthat he did not see he was himself observed. His face, distorted by\r\npassion, was horrible to look upon. That vast mass of flesh had a\r\nmalignancy that was inhuman, and it was terrible to see the satanic\r\nhatred which hideously deformed it. But it changed. The redness gave way\r\nto a ghastly pallor. The revengeful scowl disappeared; and a torpid smile\r\nspread over the features, a smile that was even more terrifying than the\r\nfrown of malice. What did it mean? Susie could have cried out, but her\r\ntongue cleaved to her throat. The smile passed away, and the face became\r\nonce more impassive. It seemed that Margaret and Arthur realized at last\r\nthe power of those inhuman eyes, and they became quite still. The dog\r\nceased its sobbing. The silence was so great that each one heard the\r\nbeating of his heart. It was intolerable.\r\n\r\nThen Oliver Haddo moved. He came forward slowly.\r\n\r\n\'I want to ask you to forgive me for what I did,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'The pain of the dog\'s bite was so keen that I lost my temper. I deeply\r\nregret that I kicked it. Mr Burdon was very right to thrash me. I feel\r\nthat I deserved no less.\'\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a low voice, but with great distinctness. Susie was\r\nastounded. An abject apology was the last thing she expected.\r\n\r\nHe paused for Margaret\'s answer. But she could not bear to look at him.\r\nWhen she spoke, her words were scarcely audible. She did not know why his\r\nrequest to be forgiven made him seem more detestable.\r\n\r\n\'I think, if you don\'t mind, you had better go away.\'\r\n\r\nHaddo bowed slightly. He looked at Burdon.\r\n\r\n\'I wish to tell you that I bear no malice for what you did. I recognize\r\nthe justice of your anger.\'\r\n\r\nArthur did not answer at all. Haddo hesitated a moment, while his eyes\r\nrested on them quietly. To Susie it seemed that they flickered with the\r\nshadow of a smile. She watched him with bewildered astonishment.\r\n\r\nHe reached for his hat, bowed again, and went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nSusie could not persuade herself that Haddo\'s regret was sincere. The\r\nhumility of it aroused her suspicion. She could not get out of her mind\r\nthe ugly slyness of that smile which succeeded on his face the first\r\npassionate look of deadly hatred. Her fancy suggested various dark means\r\nwhereby Oliver Haddo might take vengeance on his enemy, and she was at\r\npains to warn Arthur. But he only laughed.\r\n\r\n\'The man\'s a funk,\' he said. \'Do you think if he\'d had anything in him at\r\nall he would have let me kick him without trying to defend himself?\'\r\n\r\nHaddo\'s cowardice increased the disgust with which Arthur regarded him.\r\nHe was amused by Susie\'s trepidation.\r\n\r\n\'What on earth do you suppose he can do? He can\'t drop a brickbat on my\r\nhead. If he shoots me he\'ll get his head cut off, and he won\'t be such an\r\nass as to risk that!\'\r\n\r\nMargaret was glad that the incident had relieved them of Oliver\'s\r\nsociety. She met him in the street a couple of days later, and since\r\nhe took off his hat in the French fashion without waiting for her to\r\nacknowledge him, she was able to make her cut more pointed.\r\n\r\nShe began to discuss with Arthur the date of their marriage. It seemed\r\nto her that she had got out of Paris all it could give her, and she\r\nwished to begin a new life. Her love for Arthur appeared on a sudden\r\nmore urgent, and she was filled with delight at the thought of the\r\nhappiness she would give him.\r\n\r\nA day or two later Susie received a telegram. It ran as follows:\r\n\r\nPlease meet me at the Gare du Nord, 2:40.\r\n\r\nNancy Clerk\r\n\r\nIt was an old friend, who was apparently arriving in Paris that\r\nafternoon. A photograph of her, with a bold signature, stood on the\r\nchimney-piece, and Susie gave it an inquisitive glance. She had not seen\r\nNancy for so long that it surprised her to receive this urgent message.\r\n\r\n\'What a bore it is!\' she said. \'I suppose I must go.\'\r\n\r\nThey meant to have tea on the other side of the river, but the journey to\r\nthe station was so long that it would not be worth Susie\'s while to come\r\nback in the interval; and they arranged therefore to meet at the house to\r\nwhich they were invited. Susie started a little before two.\r\n\r\nMargaret had a class that afternoon and set out two or three minutes\r\nlater. As she walked through the courtyard she started nervously, for\r\nOliver Haddo passed slowly by. He did not seem to see her. Suddenly he\r\nstopped, put his hand to his heart, and fell heavily to the ground. The\r\n_concierge_, the only person at hand, ran forward with a cry. She knelt\r\ndown and, looking round with terror, caught sight of Margaret.\r\n\r\n\'_Oh, mademoiselle, venez vite!_\' she cried.\r\n\r\nMargaret was obliged to go. Her heart beat horribly. She looked down at\r\nOliver, and he seemed to be dead. She forgot that she loathed him.\r\nInstinctively she knelt down by his side and loosened his collar. He\r\nopened his eyes. An expression of terrible anguish came into his face.\r\n\r\n\'For the love of God, take me in for one moment,\' he sobbed. \'I shall die\r\nin the street.\'\r\n\r\nHer heart was moved towards him. He could not go into the poky den,\r\nevil-smelling and airless, of the _concierge_. But with her help Margaret\r\nraised him to his feet, and together they brought him to the studio. He\r\nsank painfully into a chair.\r\n\r\n\'Shall I fetch you some water?\' asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n\'Can you get a pastille out of my pocket?\'\r\n\r\nHe swallowed a white tabloid, which she took out of a case attached to\r\nhis watch-chain.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m very sorry to cause you this trouble,\' he gasped. \'I suffer from a\r\ndisease of the heart, and sometimes I am very near death.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m glad that I was able to help you,\' she said.\r\n\r\nHe seemed able to breathe more easily. She left him to himself for a\r\nwhile, so that he might regain his strength. She took up a book and began\r\nto read. Presently, without moving from his chair, he spoke.\r\n\r\n\'You must hate me for intruding on you.\'\r\n\r\nHis voice was stronger, and her pity waned as he seemed to recover. She\r\nanswered with freezing indifference.\r\n\r\n\'I couldn\'t do any less for you than I did. I would have brought a dog\r\ninto my room if it seemed hurt.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see that you wish me to go.\'\r\n\r\nHe got up and moved towards the door, but he staggered and with a groan\r\ntumbled to his knees. Margaret sprang forward to help him. She reproached\r\nherself bitterly for those scornful words. The man had barely escaped\r\ndeath, and she was merciless.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, please stay as long as you like,\' she cried. \'I\'m sorry, I didn\'t\r\nmean to hurt you.\'\r\n\r\nHe dragged himself with difficulty back to the chair, and she,\r\nconscience-stricken, stood over him helplessly. She poured out a\r\nglass of water, but he motioned it away as though he would not be\r\nbeholden to her even for that.\r\n\r\n\'Is there nothing I can do for you at all?\' she exclaimed, painfully.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing, except allow me to sit in this chair,\' he gasped.\r\n\r\n\'I hope you\'ll remain as long as you choose.\'\r\n\r\nHe did not reply. She sat down again and pretended to read. In a little\r\nwhile he began to speak. His voice reached her as if from a long way off.\r\n\r\n\'Will you never forgive me for what I did the other day?\'\r\n\r\nShe answered without looking at him, her back still turned.\r\n\r\n\'Can it matter to you if I forgive or not?\'\r\n\r\n\'You have not pity. I told you then how sorry I was that a sudden\r\nuncontrollable pain drove me to do a thing which immediately I bitterly\r\nregretted. Don\'t you think it must have been hard for me, under the\r\nactual circumstances, to confess my fault?\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish you not to speak of it. I don\'t want to think of that horrible\r\nscene.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you knew how lonely I was and how unhappy, you would have a little\r\nmercy.\'\r\n\r\nHis voice was strangely moved. She could not doubt now that he was\r\nsincere.\r\n\r\n\'You think me a charlatan because I aim at things that are unknown to\r\nyou. You won\'t try to understand. You won\'t give me any credit for\r\nstriving with all my soul to a very great end.\'\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, and for a time there was silence. His voice was\r\ndifferent now and curiously seductive.\r\n\r\n\'You look upon me with disgust and scorn. You almost persuaded yourself\r\nto let me die in the street rather than stretch out to me a helping hand.\r\nAnd if you hadn\'t been merciful then, almost against your will, I should\r\nhave died.\'\r\n\r\n\'It can make no difference to you how I regard you,\' she whispered.\r\n\r\nShe did not know why his soft, low tones mysteriously wrung her\r\nheartstrings. Her pulse began to beat more quickly.\r\n\r\n\'It makes all the difference in the world. It is horrible to think of\r\nyour contempt. I feel your goodness and your purity. I can hardly bear my\r\nown unworthiness. You turn your eyes away from me as though I were\r\nunclean.\'\r\n\r\nShe turned her chair a little and looked at him. She was astonished at\r\nthe change in his appearance. His hideous obesity seemed no longer\r\nrepellent, for his eyes wore a new expression; they were incredibly\r\ntender now, and they were moist with tears. His mouth was tortured by a\r\npassionate distress. Margaret had never seen so much unhappiness on a\r\nman\'s face, and an overwhelming remorse seized her.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want to be unkind to you,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'I will go. That is how I can best repay you for what you have done.\'\r\n\r\nThe words were so bitter, so humiliated, that the colour rose to her\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n\'I ask you to stay. But let us talk of other things.\'\r\n\r\nFor a moment he kept silence. He seemed no longer to see Margaret, and\r\nshe watched him thoughtfully. His eyes rested on a print of _La Gioconda_\r\nwhich hung on the wall. Suddenly he began to speak. He recited the\r\nhoneyed words with which Walter Pater expressed his admiration for that\r\nconsummate picture.\r\n\r\n\'Hers is the head upon which all the ends of the world are come, and the\r\neyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out from within upon\r\nthe flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and\r\nfantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it for a moment beside one\r\nof those white Greek goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how\r\nwould they be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its\r\nmaladies has passed. All the thoughts and experience of the world have\r\netched and moulded there, in that which they have of power to refine and\r\nmake expressive the outward form, the animalism of Greece, the lust of\r\nRome, the mysticism of the Middle Ages, with its spiritual ambition and\r\nimaginative loves, the return of the Pagan world, the sins of the\r\nBorgias.\'\r\n\r\nHis voice, poignant and musical, blended with the suave music of the\r\nwords so that Margaret felt she had never before known their divine\r\nsignificance. She was intoxicated with their beauty. She wished him to\r\ncontinue, but had not the strength to speak. As if he guessed her\r\nthought, he went on, and now his voice had a richness in it as of an\r\norgan heard afar off. It was like an overwhelming fragrance and she could\r\nhardly bear it.\r\n\r\n\'She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she\r\nhas been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has\r\nbeen a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her; and\r\ntrafficked for strange evils with Eastern merchants; and, as Leda, was\r\nthe mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary; and\r\nall this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes, and lives\r\nonly in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments,\r\nand tinged the eyelids and the hands.\'\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo began then to speak of Leonardo da Vinci, mingling with his\r\nown fantasies the perfect words of that essay which, so wonderful was his\r\nmemory, he seemed to know by heart. He found exotic fancies in the\r\nlikeness between Saint John the Baptist, with his soft flesh and waving\r\nhair, and Bacchus, with his ambiguous smile. Seen through his eyes, the\r\nseashore in the Saint Anne had the airless lethargy of some damasked\r\nchapel in a Spanish nunnery, and over the landscapes brooded a wan spirit\r\nof evil that was very troubling. He loved the mysterious pictures in\r\nwhich the painter had sought to express something beyond the limits of\r\npainting, something of unsatisfied desire and of longing for unhuman\r\npassions. Oliver Haddo found this quality in unlikely places, and his\r\nwords gave a new meaning to paintings that Margaret had passed\r\nthoughtlessly by. There was the portrait of a statuary by Bronzino in the\r\nLong Gallery of the Louvre. The features were rather large, the face\r\nrather broad. The expression was sombre, almost surly in the repose of\r\nthe painted canvas, and the eyes were brown, almond-shaped like those of\r\nan Oriental; the red lips were exquisitely modelled, and the sensuality\r\nwas curiously disturbing; the dark, chestnut hair, cut short, curled over\r\nthe head with an infinite grace. The skin was like ivory softened with a\r\ndelicate carmine. There was in that beautiful countenance more than\r\nbeauty, for what most fascinated the observer was a supreme and\r\ndisdainful indifference to the passion of others. It was a vicious face,\r\nexcept that beauty could never be quite vicious; it was a cruel face,\r\nexcept that indolence could never be quite cruel. It was a face that\r\nhaunted you, and yet your admiration was alloyed with an unreasoning\r\nterror. The hands were nervous and adroit, with long fashioning fingers;\r\nand you felt that at their touch the clay almost moulded itself into\r\ngracious forms. With Haddo\'s subtle words the character of that man rose\r\nbefore her, cruel yet indifferent, indolent and passionate, cold yet\r\nsensual; unnatural secrets dwelt in his mind, and mysterious crimes, and\r\na lust for the knowledge that was arcane. Oliver Haddo was attracted by\r\nall that was unusual, deformed, and monstrous, by the pictures that\r\nrepresented the hideousness of man or that reminded you of his mortality.\r\nHe summoned before Margaret the whole array of Ribera\'s ghoulish dwarfs,\r\nwith their cunning smile, the insane light of their eyes, and their\r\nmalice: he dwelt with a horrible fascination upon their malformations,\r\nthe humped backs, the club feet, the hydrocephalic heads. He described\r\nthe picture by Valdes Leal, in a certain place at Seville, which\r\nrepresents a priest at the altar; and the altar is sumptuous with gilt\r\nand florid carving. He wears a magnificent cope and a surplice of\r\nexquisite lace, but he wears them as though their weight was more than he\r\ncould bear; and in the meagre trembling hands, and in the white, ashen\r\nface, in the dark hollowness of the eyes, there is a bodily corruption\r\nthat is terrifying. He seems to hold together with difficulty the bonds\r\nof the flesh, but with no eager yearning of the soul to burst its prison,\r\nonly with despair; it is as if the Lord Almighty had forsaken him and the\r\nhigh heavens were empty of their solace. All the beauty of life appears\r\nforgotten, and there is nothing in the world but decay. A ghastly\r\nputrefaction has attacked already the living man; the worms of the grave,\r\nthe piteous horror of mortality, and the darkness before him offer naught\r\nbut fear. Beyond, dark night is seen and a turbulent sea, the dark night\r\nof the soul of which the mystics write, and the troublous sea of life\r\nwhereon there is no refuge for the weary and the sick at heart.\r\n\r\nThen, as if in pursuance of a definite plan, he analysed with a\r\nsearching, vehement intensity the curious talent of the modern Frenchman,\r\nGustave Moreau. Margaret had lately visited the Luxembourg, and his\r\npictures were fresh in her memory. She had found in them little save a\r\ndecorative arrangement marred by faulty drawing; but Oliver Haddo gave\r\nthem at once a new, esoteric import. Those effects as of a Florentine\r\njewel, the clustered colours, emerald and ruby, the deep blue of\r\nsapphires, the atmosphere of scented chambers, the mystic persons who\r\nseem ever about secret, religious rites, combined in his cunning phrases\r\nto create, as it were, a pattern on her soul of morbid and mysterious\r\nintricacy. Those pictures were filled with a strange sense of sin, and\r\nthe mind that contemplated them was burdened with the decadence of Rome\r\nand with the passionate vice of the Renaissance; and it was tortured,\r\ntoo, by all the introspection of this later day.\r\n\r\nMargaret listened, rather breathlessly, with the excitement of an\r\nexplorer before whom is spread the plain of an undiscovered continent.\r\nThe painters she knew spoke of their art technically, and this\r\nimaginative appreciation was new to her. She was horribly fascinated\r\nby the personality that imbued these elaborate sentences. Haddo\'s eyes\r\nwere fixed upon hers, and she responded to his words like a delicate\r\ninstrument made for recording the beatings of the heart. She felt an\r\nextraordinary languor. At last he stopped. Margaret neither moved nor\r\nspoke. She might have been under a spell. It seemed to her that she had\r\nno power in her limbs.\r\n\r\n\'I want to do something for you in return for what you have done for me,\'\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nHe stood up and went to the piano.\r\n\r\n\'Sit in this chair,\' he said.\r\n\r\nShe did not dream of disobeying. He began to play. Margaret was hardly\r\nsurprised that he played marvellously. Yet it was almost incredible that\r\nthose fat, large hands should have such a tenderness of touch. His\r\nfingers caressed the notes with a peculiar suavity, and he drew out of\r\nthe piano effects which she had scarcely thought possible. He seemed to\r\nput into the notes a troubling, ambiguous passion, and the instrument had\r\nthe tremulous emotion of a human being. It was strange and terrifying.\r\nShe was vaguely familiar with the music to which she listened; but there\r\nwas in it, under his fingers, an exotic savour that made it harmonious\r\nwith all that he had said that afternoon. His memory was indeed\r\nastonishing. He had an infinite tact to know the feeling that occupied\r\nMargaret\'s heart, and what he chose seemed to be exactly that which at\r\nthe moment she imperatively needed. Then he began to play things she did\r\nnot know. It was music the like of which she had never heard, barbaric,\r\nwith a plaintive weirdness that brought to her fancy the moonlit nights\r\nof desert places, with palm trees mute in the windless air, and tawny\r\ndistances. She seemed to know tortuous narrow streets, white houses of\r\nsilence with strange moon-shadows, and the glow of yellow light within,\r\nand the tinkling of uncouth instruments, and the acrid scents of Eastern\r\nperfumes. It was like a procession passing through her mind of persons\r\nwho were not human, yet existed mysteriously, with a life of vampires.\r\nMona Lisa and Saint John the Baptist, Bacchus and the mother of Mary,\r\nwent with enigmatic motions. But the daughter of Herodias raised her\r\nhands as though, engaged for ever in a mystic rite, to invoke outlandish\r\ngods. Her face was very pale, and her dark eyes were sleepless; the\r\njewels of her girdle gleamed with sombre fires; and her dress was of\r\ncolours that have long been lost. The smile, in which was all the sorrow\r\nof the world and all its wickedness, beheld the wan head of the Saint,\r\nand with a voice that was cold with the coldness of death she murmured\r\nthe words of the poet:\r\n\r\n\'I am amorous of thy body, Iokanaan! Thy body is white like the lilies of\r\na field that the mower hath never mowed. Thy body is white like the snows\r\nthat lie on the mountains of Judea, and come down into the valleys. The\r\nroses in the garden of the Queen of Arabia are not so white as thy body.\r\nNeither the roses in the garden of the Queen of Arabia, the garden of\r\nspices of the Queen of Arabia, nor the feet of the dawn when they light\r\non the leaves, nor the breast of the moon when she lies on the breast of\r\nthe sea... There is nothing in the world so white as thy body. Suffer me\r\nto touch thy body.\'\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo ceased to play. Neither of them stirred. At last Margaret\r\nsought by an effort to regain her self-control.\r\n\r\n\'I shall begin to think that you really are a magician,\' she said,\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\n\'I could show you strange things if you cared to see them,\' he answered,\r\nagain raising his eyes to hers.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think you will ever get me to believe in occult philosophy,\'\r\nshe laughed.\r\n\r\n\'Yet it reigned in Persia with the magi, it endowed India with wonderful\r\ntraditions, it civilised Greece to the sounds of Orpheus\'s lyre.\'\r\n\r\nHe stood before Margaret, towering over her in his huge bulk; and there\r\nwas a singular fascination in his gaze. It seemed that he spoke only to\r\nconceal from her that he was putting forth now all the power that was in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\'It concealed the first principles of science in the calculations of\r\nPythagoras. It established empires by its oracles, and at its voice\r\ntyrants grew pale upon their thrones. It governed the minds of some by\r\ncuriosity, and others it ruled by fear.\'\r\n\r\nHis voice grew very low, and it was so seductive that Margaret\'s brain\r\nreeled. The sound of it was overpowering like too sweet a fragrance.\r\n\r\nI tell you that for this art nothing is impossible. It commands the\r\nelements, and knows the language of the stars, and directs the planets\r\nin their courses. The moon at its bidding falls blood-red from the sky.\r\nThe dead rise up and form into ominous words the night wind that moans\r\nthrough their skulls. Heaven and Hell are in its province; and all forms,\r\nlovely and hideous; and love and hate. With Circe\'s wand it can change\r\nmen into beasts of the field, and to them it can give a monstrous\r\nhumanity. Life and death are in the right hand and in the left of him who\r\nknows its secrets. It confers wealth by the transmutation of metals and\r\nimmortality by its quintessence.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret could not hear what he said. A gradual lethargy seized her under\r\nhis baleful glance, and she had not even the strength to wish to free\r\nherself. She seemed bound to him already by hidden chains.\r\n\r\n\'If you have powers, show them,\' she whispered, hardly conscious that she\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he released the enormous tension with which he held her. Like a\r\nman who has exerted all his strength to some end, the victory won, he\r\nloosened his muscles, with a faint sigh of exhaustion. Margaret did not\r\nspeak, but she knew that something horrible was about to happen. Her\r\nheart beat like a prisoned bird, with helpless flutterings, but it seemed\r\ntoo late now to draw back. Her words by a mystic influence had settled\r\nsomething beyond possibility of recall.\r\n\r\nOn the stove was a small bowl of polished brass in which water was kept\r\nin order to give a certain moisture to the air. Oliver Haddo put his hand\r\nin his pocket and drew out a little silver box. He tapped it, with a\r\nsmile, as a man taps a snuff-box, and it opened. He took an infinitesimal\r\nquantity of a blue powder that it contained and threw it on the water in\r\nthe brass bowl. Immediately a bright flame sprang up, and Margaret gave a\r\ncry of alarm. Oliver looked at her quickly and motioned her to remain\r\nstill. She saw that the water was on fire. It was burning as brilliantly,\r\nas hotly, as if it were common gas; and it burned with the same dry,\r\nhoarse roar. Suddenly it was extinguished. She leaned forward and saw\r\nthat the bowl was empty.\r\n\r\nThe water had been consumed, as though it were straw, and not a drop\r\nremained. She passed her hand absently across her forehead.\r\n\r\n\'But water cannot burn,\' she muttered to herself.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that Haddo knew what she thought, for he smiled strangely.\r\n\r\n\'Do you know that nothing more destructive can be invented than this blue\r\npowder, and I have enough to burn up all the water in Paris? Who dreamt\r\nthat water might burn like chaff?\'\r\n\r\nHe paused, seeming to forget her presence. He looked thoughtfully at the\r\nlittle silver box.\r\n\r\n\'But it can be made only in trivial quantities, at enormous expense and\r\nwith exceeding labour; it is so volatile that you cannot keep it for\r\nthree days. I have sometimes thought that with a little ingenuity I might\r\nmake it more stable, I might so modify it that, like radium, it lost no\r\nstrength as it burned; and then I should possess the greatest secret that\r\nhas ever been in the mind of man. For there would be no end of it. It\r\nwould continue to burn while there was a drop of water on the earth, and\r\nthe whole world would be consumed. But it would be a frightful thing to\r\nhave in one\'s hands; for once it were cast upon the waters, the doom of\r\nall that existed would be sealed beyond repeal.\'\r\n\r\nHe took a long breath, and his eyes glittered with a devilish ardour. His\r\nvoice was hoarse with overwhelming emotion.\r\n\r\n\'Sometimes I am haunted by the wild desire to have seen the great and\r\nfinal scene when the irrevocable flames poured down the river, hurrying\r\nalong the streams of the earth, searching out the moisture in all growing\r\nthings, tearing it even from the eternal rocks; when the flames poured\r\ndown like the rushing of the wind, and all that lived fled from before\r\nthem till they came to the sea; and the sea itself was consumed in\r\nvehement fire.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret shuddered, but she did not think the man was mad. She had\r\nceased to judge him. He took one more particle of that atrocious powder\r\nand put it in the bowl. Again he thrust his hand in his pocket and\r\nbrought out a handful of some crumbling substance that might have been\r\ndried leaves, leaves of different sorts, broken and powdery. There was\r\na trace of moisture in them still, for a low flame sprang up immediately\r\nat the bottom of the dish, and a thick vapour filled the room. It had a\r\nsingular and pungent odour that Margaret did not know. It was difficult\r\nto breathe, and she coughed. She wanted to beg Oliver to stop, but could\r\nnot. He took the bowl in his hands and brought it to her.\r\n\r\n\'Look,\' he commanded.\r\n\r\nShe bent forward, and at the bottom saw a blue fire, of a peculiar\r\nsolidity, as though it consisted of molten metal. It was not still, but\r\nwrithed strangely, like serpents of fire tortured by their own unearthly\r\nardour.\r\n\r\n\'Breathe very deeply.\'\r\n\r\nShe did as he told her. A sudden trembling came over her, and darkness\r\nfell across her eyes. She tried to cry out, but could utter no sound. Her\r\nbrain reeled. It seemed to her that Haddo bade her cover her face. She\r\ngasped for breath, and it was as if the earth spun under her feet. She\r\nappeared to travel at an immeasurable speed. She made a slight movement,\r\nand Haddo told her not to look round. An immense terror seized her. She\r\ndid not know whither she was borne, and still they went quickly, quickly;\r\nand the hurricane itself would have lagged behind them. At last their\r\nmotion ceased; and Oliver was holding her arm.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be afraid,\' he said. \'Open your eyes and stand up.\'\r\n\r\nThe night had fallen; but it was not the comfortable night that soothes\r\nthe troubled minds of mortal men; it was a night that agitated the soul\r\nmysteriously so that each nerve in the body tingled. There was a lurid\r\ndarkness which displayed and yet distorted the objects that surrounded\r\nthem. No moon shone in the sky, but small stars appeared to dance on the\r\nheather, vague night-fires like spirits of the damned. They stood in a\r\nvast and troubled waste, with huge stony boulders and leafless trees,\r\nrugged and gnarled like tortured souls in pain. It was as if there had\r\nbeen a devastating storm, and the country reposed after the flood of\r\nrain and the tempestuous wind and the lightning. All things about them\r\nappeared dumbly to suffer, like a man racked by torments who has not the\r\nstrength even to realize that his agony has ceased. Margaret heard the\r\nflight of monstrous birds, and they seemed to whisper strange things\r\non their passage. Oliver took her hand. He led her steadily to a\r\ncross-road, and she did not know if they walked amid rocks or tombs.\r\n\r\nShe heard the sound of a trumpet, and from all parts, strangely appearing\r\nwhere before was nothing, a turbulent assembly surged about her. That\r\nvast empty space was suddenly filled by shadowy forms, and they swept\r\nalong like the waves of the sea, crowding upon one another\'s heels. And\r\nit seemed that all the mighty dead appeared before her; and she saw grim\r\ntyrants, and painted courtesans, and Roman emperors in their purple, and\r\nsultans of the East. All those fierce evil women of olden time passed by\r\nher side, and now it was Mona Lisa and now the subtle daughter of\r\nHerodias. And Jezebel looked out upon her from beneath her painted brows,\r\nand Cleopatra turned away a wan, lewd face; and she saw the insatiable\r\nmouth and the wanton eyes of Messalina, and Fustine was haggard with the\r\neternal fires of lust. She saw cardinals in their scarlet, and warriors\r\nin their steel, gay gentlemen in periwigs, and ladies in powder and\r\npatch. And on a sudden, like leaves by the wind, all these were driven\r\nbefore the silent throngs of the oppressed; and they were innumerable as\r\nthe sands of the sea. Their thin faces were earthy with want and\r\ncavernous from disease, and their eyes were dull with despair. They\r\npassed in their tattered motley, some in the fantastic rags of the\r\nbeggars of Albrecht Duerer and some in the grey cerecloths of Le Nain;\r\nmany wore the blouses and the caps of the rabble in France, and many the\r\ndingy, smoke-grimed weeds of English poor. And they surged onward like a\r\nriotous crowd in narrow streets flying in terror before the mounted\r\ntroops. It seemed as though all the world were gathered there in strange\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nThen all again was void; and Margaret\'s gaze was riveted upon a great,\r\nruined tree that stood in that waste place, alone, in ghastly desolation;\r\nand though a dead thing, it seemed to suffer a more than human pain. The\r\nlightning had torn it asunder, but the wind of centuries had sought\r\nin vain to drag up its roots. The tortured branches, bare of any twig,\r\nwere like a Titan\'s arms, convulsed with intolerable anguish. And in a\r\nmoment she grew sick with fear, for a change came into the tree, and the\r\ntremulousness of life was in it; the rough bark was changed into brutish\r\nflesh and the twisted branches into human arms. It became a monstrous,\r\ngoat-legged thing, more vast than the creatures of nightmare. She saw the\r\nhorns and the long beard, the great hairy legs with their hoofs, and the\r\nman\'s rapacious hands. The face was horrible with lust and cruelty, and\r\nyet it was divine. It was Pan, playing on his pipes, and the lecherous\r\neyes caressed her with a hideous tenderness. But even while she looked,\r\nas the mist of early day, rising, discloses a fair country, the animal\r\npart of that ghoulish creature seemed to fall away, and she saw a lovely\r\nyouth, titanic but sublime, leaning against a massive rock. He was more\r\nbeautiful than the Adam of Michelangelo who wakes into life at the call\r\nof the Almighty; and, like him freshly created, he had the adorable\r\nlanguor of one who feels still in his limbs the soft rain on the loose\r\nbrown earth. Naked and full of majesty he lay, the outcast son of the\r\nmorning; and she dared not look upon his face, for she knew it was\r\nimpossible to bear the undying pain that darkened it with ruthless\r\nshadows. Impelled by a great curiosity, she sought to come nearer,\r\nbut the vast figure seemed strangely to dissolve into a cloud; and\r\nimmediately she felt herself again surrounded by a hurrying throng.\r\nThen came all legendary monsters and foul beasts of a madman\'s fancy;\r\nin the darkness she saw enormous toads, with paws pressed to their\r\nflanks, and huge limping scarabs, shelled creatures the like of which\r\nshe had never seen, and noisome brutes with horny scales and round crabs\'\r\neyes, uncouth primeval things, and winged serpents, and creeping animals\r\nbegotten of the slime. She heard shrill cries and peals of laughter and\r\nthe terrifying rattle of men at the point of death. Haggard women,\r\ndishevelled and lewd, carried wine; and when they spilt it there were\r\nstains like the stains of blood. And it seemed to Margaret that a fire\r\nburned in her veins, and her soul fled from her body; but a new soul\r\ncame in its place, and suddenly she knew all that was obscene. She took\r\npart in some festival of hideous lust, and the wickedness of the world\r\nwas patent to her eyes. She saw things so vile that she screamed in\r\nterror, and she heard Oliver laugh in derision by her side. It was a\r\nscene of indescribable horror, and she put her hands to her eyes so that\r\nshe might not see.\r\n\r\nShe felt Oliver Haddo take her hands. She would not let him drag them\r\naway. Then she heard him speak.\r\n\r\n\'You need not be afraid.\'\r\n\r\nHis voice was quite natural once more, and she realized with a start that\r\nshe was sitting quietly in the studio. She looked around her with\r\nfrightened eyes. Everything was exactly as it had been. The early night\r\nof autumn was fallen, and the only light in the room came from the fire.\r\nThere was still that vague, acrid scent of the substance which Haddo had\r\nburned.\r\n\r\n\'Shall I light the candles?\' he said.\r\n\r\nHe struck a match and lit those which were on the piano. They threw a\r\nstrange light. Then Margaret suddenly remembered all that she had seen,\r\nand she remembered that Haddo had stood by her side. Shame seized her,\r\nintolerable shame, so that the colour, rising to her cheeks, seemed\r\nactually to burn them. She hid her face in her hands and burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\'Go away,\' she said. \'For God\'s sake, go.\'\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a moment; and the smile came to his lips which Susie\r\nhad seen after his tussle with Arthur, when last he was in the studio.\r\n\r\n\'When you want me you will find me in the Rue de Vaugiraud, number 209,\'\r\nhe said. \'Knock at the second door on the left, on the third floor.\'\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. She could only think of her appalling shame.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll write it down for you in case you forget.\'\r\n\r\nHe scribbled the address on a sheet of paper that he found on the table.\r\nMargaret took no notice, but sobbed as though her heart would break.\r\nSuddenly, looking up with a start, she saw that he was gone. She had not\r\nheard him open the door or close it. She sank down on her knees and\r\nprayed desperately, as though some terrible danger threatened her.\r\n\r\nBut when she heard Susie\'s key in the door, Margaret sprang to her feet.\r\nShe stood with her back to the fireplace, her hands behind her, in the\r\nattitude of a prisoner protesting his innocence. Susie was too much\r\nannoyed to observe this agitation.\r\n\r\n\'Why on earth didn\'t you come to tea?\' she asked. \'I couldn\'t make out\r\nwhat had become of you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I had a dreadful headache,\' answered Margaret, trying to control\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nSusie flung herself down wearily in a chair. Margaret forced herself to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\'Had Nancy anything particular to say to you?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'She never turned up,\' answered Susie irritably. \'I can\'t understand it.\r\nI waited till the train came in, but there was no sign of her. Then I\r\nthought she might have hit upon that time by chance and was not coming\r\nfrom England, so I walked about the station for half an hour.\'\r\n\r\nShe went to the chimneypiece, on which had been left the telegram that\r\nsummoned her to the Gare du Nord, and read it again. She gave a little\r\ncry of surprise.\r\n\r\n\'How stupid of me! I never noticed the postmark. It was sent from the Rue\r\nLittre.\'\r\n\r\nThis was less than ten minutes\' walk from the studio. Susie looked at the\r\nmessage with perplexity.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder if someone has been playing a silly practical joke on me.\' She\r\nshrugged her shoulders. \'But it\'s too foolish. If I were a suspicious\r\nwoman,\' she smiled, \'I should think you had sent it yourself to get me\r\nout of the way.\'\r\n\r\nThe idea flashed through Margaret that Oliver Haddo was the author of it.\r\nHe might easily have seen Nancy\'s name on the photograph during his first\r\nvisit to the studio. She had no time to think before she answered\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\n\'If I wanted to get rid of you, I should have no hesitation in saying\r\nso.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose no one has been here?\' asked Susie.\r\n\r\n\'No one.\'\r\n\r\nThe lie slipped from Margaret\'s lips before she had made up her mind to\r\ntell it. Her heart gave a great beat against her chest. She felt herself\r\nredden.\r\n\r\nSusie got up to light a cigarette. She wished to rest her nerves. The box\r\nwas on the table and, as she helped herself, her eyes fell carelessly on\r\nthe address that Haddo had left. She picked it up and read it aloud.\r\n\r\n\'Who on earth lives there?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know at all,\' answered Margaret.\r\n\r\nShe braced herself for further questions, but Susie, without interest,\r\nput down the sheet of paper and struck a match.\r\n\r\nMargaret was ashamed. Her nature was singularly truthful, and it troubled\r\nher extraordinarily that she had lied to her greatest friend. Something\r\nstronger than herself seemed to impel her. She would have given much to\r\nconfess her two falsehoods, but had not the courage. She could not bear\r\nthat Susie\'s implicit trust in her straightforwardness should be\r\ndestroyed; and the admission that Oliver Haddo had been there would\r\nentail a further acknowledgment of the nameless horrors she had\r\nwitnessed. Susie would think her mad.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door; and Margaret, her nerves shattered by all\r\nthat she had endured, could hardly restrain a cry of terror. She feared\r\nthat Haddo had returned. But it was Arthur Burdon. She greeted him with\r\na passionate relief that was unusual, for she was by nature a woman of\r\ngreat self-possession. She felt excessively weak, physically exhausted\r\nas though she had gone a long journey, and her mind was highly wrought.\r\nMargaret remembered that her state had been the same on her first arrival\r\nin Paris, when, in her eagerness to get a preliminary glimpse of its\r\nmarvels, she had hurried till her bones ached from one celebrated\r\nmonument to another. They began to speak of trivial things. Margaret\r\ntried to join calmly in the conversation, but her voice sounded\r\nunnatural, and she fancied that more than once Arthur gave her a curious\r\nlook. At length she could control herself no longer and burst into a\r\nsudden flood of tears. In a moment, uncomprehending but affectionate, he\r\ncaught her in his arms. He asked tenderly what was the matter. He sought\r\nto comfort her. She wept ungovernably, clinging to him for protection.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it\'s nothing,\' she gasped. \'I don\'t know what is the matter with me.\r\nI\'m only nervous and frightened.\'\r\n\r\nArthur had an idea that women were often afflicted with what he described\r\nby the old-fashioned name of vapours, and was not disposed to pay much\r\nattention to this vehement distress. He soothed her as he would have done\r\na child.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, take care of me, Arthur. I\'m so afraid that some dreadful thing will\r\nhappen to me. I want all your strength. Promise that you\'ll never forsake\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\nHe laughed, as he kissed away her tears, and she tried to smile.\r\n\r\n\'Why can\'t we be married at once?\' she asked. \'I don\'t want to wait any\r\nlonger. I shan\'t feel safe till I\'m actually your wife.\'\r\n\r\nHe reasoned with her very gently. After all, they were to be married in a\r\nfew weeks. They could not easily hasten matters, for their house was not\r\nyet ready, and she needed time to get her clothes. The date had been\r\nfixed by her. She listened sullenly to his words. Their wisdom was plain,\r\nand she did not see how she could possibly insist. Even if she told him\r\nall that had passed he would not believe her; he would think she was\r\nsuffering from some trick of her morbid fancy.\r\n\r\n\'If anything happens to me,\' she answered, with the dark, anguished eyes\r\nof a hunted beast, \'you will be to blame.\'\r\n\r\n\'I promise you that nothing will happen.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s night was disturbed, and next day she was unable to go about\r\nher work with her usual tranquillity. She tried to reason herself into\r\na natural explanation of the events that had happened. The telegram\r\nthat Susie had received pointed to a definite scheme on Haddo\'s part,\r\nand suggested that his sudden illness was but a device to get into the\r\nstudio. Once there, he had used her natural sympathy as a means whereby\r\nto exercise his hypnotic power, and all she had seen was merely the\r\ncreation of his own libidinous fancy. But though she sought to persuade\r\nherself that, in playing a vile trick on her, he had taken a shameful\r\nadvantage of her pity, she could not look upon him with anger. Her\r\ncontempt for him, her utter loathing, were alloyed with a feeling that\r\naroused in her horror and dismay. She could not get the man out of her\r\nthoughts. All that he had said, all that she had seen, seemed, as though\r\nit possessed a power of material growth, unaccountably to absorb her. It\r\nwas as if a rank weed were planted in her heart and slid long poisonous\r\ntentacles down every artery, so that each part of her body was enmeshed.\r\nWork could not distract her, conversation, exercise, art, left her\r\nlistless; and between her and all the actions of life stood the\r\nflamboyant, bulky form of Oliver Haddo. She was terrified of him now\r\nas never before, but curiously had no longer the physical repulsion\r\nwhich hitherto had mastered all other feelings. Although she repeated to\r\nherself that she wanted never to see him again, Margaret could scarcely\r\nresist an overwhelming desire to go to him. Her will had been taken from\r\nher, and she was an automaton. She struggled, like a bird in the fowler\'s\r\nnet with useless beating of the wings; but at the bottom of her heart she\r\nwas dimly conscious that she did not want to resist. If he had given her\r\nthat address, it was because he knew she would use it. She did not know\r\nwhy she wanted to go to him; she had nothing to say to him; she knew only\r\nthat it was necessary to go. But a few days before she had seen the\r\n_Phedre_ of Racine, and she felt on a sudden all the torments that wrung\r\nthe heart of that unhappy queen; she, too, struggled aimlessly to escape\r\nfrom the poison that the immortal gods poured in her veins. She asked\r\nherself frantically whether a spell had been cast over her, for now she\r\nwas willing to believe that Haddo\'s power was all-embracing. Margaret\r\nknew that if she yielded to the horrible temptation nothing could save\r\nher from destruction. She would have cried for help to Arthur or to\r\nSusie, but something, she knew not what, prevented her. At length, driven\r\nalmost to distraction, she thought that Dr Porhoet might do something for\r\nher. He, at least, would understand her misery. There seemed not a moment\r\nto lose, and she hastened to his house. They told her he was out. Her\r\nheart sank, for it seemed that her last hope was gone. She was like a\r\nperson drowning, who clings to a rock; and the waves dash against him,\r\nand beat upon his bleeding hands with a malice all too human, as if to\r\ntear them from their refuge.\r\n\r\nInstead of going to the sketch-class, which was held at six in the\r\nevening, she hurried to the address that Oliver Haddo had given her. She\r\nwent along the crowded street stealthily, as though afraid that someone\r\nwould see her, and her heart was in a turmoil. She desired with all her\r\nmight not to go, and sought vehemently to prevent herself, and yet withal\r\nshe went. She ran up the stairs and knocked at the door. She remembered\r\nhis directions distinctly. In a moment Oliver Haddo stood before her. He\r\ndid not seem astonished that she was there. As she stood on the landing,\r\nit occurred to her suddenly that she had no reason to offer for her\r\nvisit, but his words saved her from any need for explanation.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been waiting for you,\' he said.\r\n\r\nHaddo led her into a sitting-room. He had an apartment in a _maison\r\nmeublee_, and heavy hangings, the solid furniture of that sort of house\r\nin Paris, was unexpected in connexion with him. The surroundings were so\r\ncommonplace that they seemed to emphasise his singularity. There was a\r\npeculiar lack of comfort, which suggested that he was indifferent to\r\nmaterial things. The room was large, but so cumbered that it gave a\r\ncramped impression. Haddo dwelt there as if he were apart from any\r\nhabitation that might be his. He moved cautiously among the heavy\r\nfurniture, and his great obesity was somehow more remarkable. There was\r\nthe acrid perfume which Margaret remembered a few days before in her\r\nvision of an Eastern city.\r\n\r\nAsking her to sit down, he began to talk as if they were old\r\nacquaintances between whom nothing of moment had occurred. At last\r\nshe took her courage in both hands.\r\n\r\n\'Why did you make me come here?\' she asked suddenly,\r\n\r\n\'You give me credit now for very marvellous powers,\' he smiled.\r\n\r\n\'You knew I should come.\'\r\n\r\n\'I knew.\'\r\n\r\n\'What have I done to you that you should make me so unhappy? I want you\r\nto leave me alone.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall not prevent you from going out if you choose to go. No harm has\r\ncome to you. The door is open.\'\r\n\r\nHer heart beat quickly, painfully almost, and she remained silent. She\r\nknew that she did not want to go. There was something that drew her\r\nstrangely to him, and she was ceasing to resist. A strange feeling began\r\nto take hold of her, creeping stealthily through her limbs; and she was\r\nterrified, but unaccountably elated.\r\n\r\nHe began to talk with that low voice of his that thrilled her with a\r\ncurious magic. He spoke not of pictures now, nor of books, but of life.\r\nHe told her of strange Eastern places where no infidel had been, and her\r\nsensitive fancy was aflame with the honeyed fervour of his phrase. He\r\nspoke of the dawn upon sleeping desolate cities, and the moonlit nights\r\nof the desert, of the sunsets with their splendour, and of the crowded\r\nstreets at noon. The beauty of the East rose before her. He told her\r\nof many-coloured webs and of silken carpets, the glittering steel of\r\narmour damascened, and of barbaric, priceless gems. The splendour of the\r\nEast blinded her eyes. He spoke of frankincense and myrrh and aloes, of\r\nheavy perfumes of the scent-merchants, and drowsy odours of the Syrian\r\ngardens. The fragrance of the East filled her nostrils. And all these\r\nthings were transformed by the power of his words till life itself\r\nseemed offered to her, a life of infinite vivacity, a life of freedom,\r\na life of supernatural knowledge. It seemed to her that a comparison was\r\ndrawn for her attention between the narrow round which awaited her as\r\nArthur\'s wife and this fair, full existence. She shuddered to think of\r\nthe dull house in Harley Street and the insignificance of its humdrum\r\nduties. But it was possible for her also to enjoy the wonder of the\r\nworld. Her soul yearned for a beauty that the commonalty of men did not\r\nknow. And what devil suggested, a warp as it were in the woof of Oliver\'s\r\nspeech, that her exquisite loveliness gave her the right to devote\r\nherself to the great art of living? She felt a sudden desire for\r\nperilous adventures. As though fire passed through her, she sprang to\r\nher feet and stood with panting bosom, her flashing eyes bright with the\r\nmulti-coloured pictures that his magic presented.\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo stood too, and they faced one another. Then, on a sudden,\r\nshe knew what the passion was that consumed her. With a quick movement,\r\nhis eyes more than ever strangely staring, he took her in his arms, and\r\nhe kissed her lips. She surrendered herself to him voluptuously. Her\r\nwhole body burned with the ecstasy of his embrace.\r\n\r\n\'I think I love you,\' she said, hoarsely.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him. She did not feel ashamed.\r\n\r\n\'Now you must go,\' he said.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door, and, without another word, she went. She walked\r\nthrough the streets as if nothing at all had happened. She felt neither\r\nremorse nor revulsion.\r\n\r\nThen Margaret felt every day that uncontrollable desire to go to him;\r\nand, though she tried to persuade herself not to yield, she knew that her\r\neffort was only a pretence: she did not want anything to prevent her.\r\nWhen it seemed that some accident would do so, she could scarcely control\r\nher irritation. There was always that violent hunger of the soul which\r\ncalled her to him, and the only happy hours she had were those spent in\r\nhis company. Day after day she felt that complete ecstasy when he took\r\nher in his huge arms, and kissed her with his heavy, sensual lips. But\r\nthe ecstasy was extraordinarily mingled with loathing, and her physical\r\nattraction was allied with physical abhorrence.\r\n\r\nYet when he looked at her with those pale blue eyes, and threw into\r\nhis voice those troubling accents, she forgot everything. He spoke\r\nof unhallowed things. Sometimes, as it were, he lifted a corner of the\r\nveil, and she caught a glimpse of terrible secrets. She understood how\r\nmen had bartered their souls for infinite knowledge. She seemed to\r\nstand upon a pinnacle of the temple, and spiritual kingdoms of darkness,\r\nprincipalities of the unknown, were spread before her eyes to lure her\r\nto destruction. But of Haddo himself she learned nothing. She did not\r\nknow if he loved her. She did not know if he had ever loved. He appeared\r\nto stand apart from human kind. Margaret discovered by chance that his\r\nmother lived, but he would not speak of her.\r\n\r\n\'Some day you shall see her,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'When?\'\r\n\r\n\'Very soon.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile her life proceeded with all outward regularity. She found it\r\neasy to deceive her friends, because it occurred to neither that her\r\nfrequent absence was not due to the plausible reasons she gave. The lies\r\nwhich at first seemed intolerable now tripped glibly off her tongue. But\r\nthough they were so natural, she was seized often with a panic of fear\r\nlest they should be discovered; and sometimes, suffering agonies of\r\nremorse, she would lie in bed at night and think with utter shame of the\r\nway she was using Arthur. But things had gone too far now, and she must\r\nlet them take their course. She scarcely knew why her feelings towards\r\nhim had so completely changed. Oliver Haddo had scarcely mentioned his\r\nname and yet had poisoned her mind. The comparison between the two was to\r\nArthur\'s disadvantage. She thought him a little dull now, and his\r\ncommonplace way of looking at life contrasted with Haddo\'s fascinating\r\nboldness. She reproached Arthur in her heart because he had never\r\nunderstood what was in her. He narrowed her mind. And gradually she began\r\nto hate him because her debt of gratitude was so great. It seemed unfair\r\nthat he should have done so much for her. He forced her to marry him by\r\nhis beneficence. Yet Margaret continued to discuss with him the\r\narrangement of their house in Harley Street. It had been her wish to\r\nfurnish the drawing-room in the style of Louis XV; and together they made\r\nlong excursions to buy chairs or old pieces of silk with which to cover\r\nthem. Everything should be perfect in its kind. The date of their\r\nmarriage was fixed, and all the details were settled. Arthur was\r\nridiculously happy. Margaret made no sign. She did not think of the\r\nfuture, and she spoke of it only to ward off suspicion. She was inwardly\r\nconvinced now that the marriage would never take place, but what was to\r\nprevent it she did not know. She watched Susie and Arthur cunningly. But\r\nthough she watched in order to conceal her own secret, it was another\'s\r\nthat she discovered. Suddenly Margaret became aware that Susie was deeply\r\nin love with Arthur Burdon. The discovery was so astounding that at first\r\nit seemed absurd.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve never done that caricature of Arthur for me that you promised,\'\r\nshe said, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve tried, but he doesn\'t lend himself to it,\' laughed Susie.\r\n\r\n\'With that long nose and the gaunt figure I should have thought you could\r\nmake something screamingly funny.\'\r\n\r\n\'How oddly you talk of him! Somehow I can only see his beautiful, kind\r\neyes and his tender mouth. I would as soon do a caricature of him as\r\nwrite a parody on a poem I loved.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret took the portfolio in which Susie kept her sketches. She caught\r\nthe look of alarm that crossed her friend\'s face, but Susie had not the\r\ncourage to prevent her from looking. She turned the drawings carelessly\r\nand presently came to a sheet upon which, in a more or less finished\r\nstate, were half a dozen heads of Arthur. Pretending not to see it, she\r\nwent on to the end. When she closed the portfolio Susie gave a sigh of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\'I wish you worked harder,\' said Margaret, as she put the sketches down.\r\n\'I wonder you don\'t do a head of Arthur as you can\'t do a caricature.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear, you mustn\'t expect everyone to take such an overpowering\r\ninterest in that young man as you do.\'\r\n\r\nThe answer added a last certainty to Margaret\'s suspicion. She told\r\nherself bitterly that Susie was no less a liar than she. Next day, when\r\nthe other was out, Margaret looked through the portfolio once more, but\r\nthe sketches of Arthur had disappeared. She was seized on a sudden with\r\nanger because Susie dared to love the man who loved her.\r\n\r\nThe web in which Oliver Haddo enmeshed her was woven with skilful\r\nintricacy. He took each part of her character separately and fortified\r\nwith consummate art his influence over her. There was something satanic\r\nin his deliberation, yet in actual time it was almost incredible that he\r\ncould have changed the old abhorrence with which she regarded him into\r\nthat hungry passion. Margaret could not now realize her life apart from\r\nhis. At length he thought the time was ripe for the final step.\r\n\r\n\'It may interest you to know that I\'m leaving Paris on Thursday,\' he said\r\ncasually, one afternoon.\r\n\r\nShe started to her feet and stared at him with bewildered eyes.\r\n\r\n\'But what is to become of me?\'\r\n\r\n\'You will marry the excellent Mr Burdon.\'\r\n\r\n\'You know I cannot live without you. How can you be so cruel?\'\r\n\r\n\'Then the only alternative is that you should accompany me.\'\r\n\r\nHer blood ran cold, and her heart seemed pressed in an iron vice.\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'There is no need to be agitated. I am making you an eminently desirable\r\noffer of marriage.\'\r\n\r\nShe sank helplessly into her chair. Because she had refused to think of\r\nthe future, it had never struck her that the time must come when it would\r\nbe necessary to leave Haddo or to throw in her lot with his definitely.\r\nShe was seized with revulsion. Margaret realized that, though an odious\r\nattraction bound her to the man, she loathed and feared him. The scales\r\nfell from her eyes. She remembered on a sudden Arthur\'s great love and\r\nall that he had done for her sake. She hated herself. Like a bird at its\r\nlast gasp beating frantically against the bars of a cage, Margaret made a\r\ndesperate effort to regain her freedom. She sprang up.\r\n\r\n\'Let me go from here. I wish I\'d never seen you. I don\'t know what you\'ve\r\ndone with me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Go by all means if you choose,\' he answered.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door, so that she might see he used no compulsion, and\r\nstood lazily at the threshold, with a hateful smile on his face. There\r\nwas something terrible in his excessive bulk. Rolls of fat descended from\r\nhis chin and concealed his neck. His cheeks were huge, and the lack of\r\nbeard added to the hideous nakedness of his face. Margaret stopped as she\r\npassed him, horribly repelled yet horribly fascinated. She had an immense\r\ndesire that he should take her again in his arms and press her lips with\r\nthat red voluptuous mouth. It was as though fiends of hell were taking\r\nrevenge upon her loveliness by inspiring in her a passion for this\r\nmonstrous creature. She trembled with the intensity of her desire. His\r\neyes were hard and cruel.\r\n\r\n\'Go,\' he said.\r\n\r\nShe bent her head and fled from before him. To get home she passed\r\nthrough the gardens of the Luxembourg, but her legs failed her, and\r\nin exhaustion she sank upon a bench. The day was sultry. She tried to\r\ncollect herself. Margaret knew well the part in which she sat, for in the\r\nenthusiastic days that seemed so long gone by she was accustomed to come\r\nthere for the sake of a certain tree upon which her eyes now rested.\r\nIt had all the slim delicacy of a Japanese print. The leaves were slender\r\nand fragile, half gold with autumn, half green, but so tenuous that the\r\ndark branches made a pattern of subtle beauty against the sky. The hand\r\nof a draughtsman could not have fashioned it with a more excellent\r\nskill. But now Margaret could take no pleasure in its grace. She felt\r\na heartrending pang to think that thenceforward the consummate things\r\nof art would have no meaning for her. She had seen Arthur the evening\r\nbefore, and remembered with an agony of shame the lies to which she had\r\nbeen forced in order to explain why she could not see him till late that\r\nday. He had proposed that they should go to Versailles, and was bitterly\r\ndisappointed when she told him they could not, as usual on Sundays, spend\r\nthe whole day together. He accepted her excuse that she had to visit a\r\nsick friend. It would not have been so intolerable if he had suspected\r\nher of deceit, and his reproaches would have hardened her heart. It was\r\nhis entire confidence which was so difficult to bear.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, if I could only make a clean breast of it all,\' she cried.\r\n\r\nThe bell of Saint Sulpice was ringing for vespers. Margaret walked slowly\r\nto the church, and sat down in the seats reserved in the transept for the\r\nneedy. She hoped that the music she must hear there would rest her soul,\r\nand perhaps she might be able to pray. Of late she had not dared. There\r\nwas a pleasant darkness in the place, and its large simplicity was\r\nsoothing. In her exhaustion, she watched listlessly the people go to and\r\nfro. Behind her was a priest in the confessional. A little peasant girl,\r\nin a Breton _coiffe_, perhaps a maid-servant lately come from her native\r\nvillage to the great capital, passed in and knelt down. Margaret could\r\nhear her muttered words, and at intervals the deep voice of the priest.\r\nIn three minutes she tripped neatly away. She looked so fresh in her\r\nplain black dress, so healthy and innocent, that Margaret could not\r\nrestrain a sob of envy. The child had so little to confess, a few puny\r\nerrors which must excite a smile on the lips of the gentle priest, and\r\nher candid spirit was like snow. Margaret would have given anything to\r\nkneel down and whisper in those passionless ears all that she suffered,\r\nbut the priest\'s faith and hers were not the same. They spoke a different\r\ntongue, not of the lips only but of the soul, and he would not listen to\r\nthe words of an heretic.\r\n\r\nA long procession of seminarists came in from the college which is under\r\nthe shadow of that great church, two by two, in black cassocks and short\r\nwhite surplices. Many were tonsured already. Some were quite young.\r\nMargaret watched their faces, wondering if they were tormented by such\r\nagony as she. But they had a living faith to sustain them, and if some,\r\nas was plain, were narrow and obtuse, they had at least a fixed rule\r\nwhich prevented them from swerving into treacherous byways. One of two\r\nhad a wan ascetic look, such as the saints may have had when the terror\r\nof life was known to them only in the imaginings of the cloister. The\r\ncanons of the church followed in their more gorgeous vestments, and\r\nfinally the officiating clergy.\r\n\r\nThe music was beautiful. There was about it a staid, sad dignity; and it\r\nseemed to Margaret fit thus to adore God. But it did not move her. She\r\ncould not understand the words that the priests chanted; their gestures,\r\ntheir movements to and fro, were strange to her. For her that stately\r\nservice had no meaning. And with a great cry in her heart she said that\r\nGod had forsaken her. She was alone in an alien land. Evil was all about\r\nher, and in those ceremonies she could find no comfort. What could she\r\nexpect when the God of her fathers left her to her fate? So that she\r\nmight not weep in front of all those people, Margaret with down-turned\r\nface walked to the door. She felt utterly lost. As she walked along the\r\ninterminable street that led to her own house, she was shaken with sobs.\r\n\r\n\'God has forsaken me,\' she repeated. \'God has foresaken me.\'\r\n\r\nNext day, her eyes red with weeping, she dragged herself to Haddo\'s door.\r\nWhen he opened it, she went in without a word. She sat down, and he\r\nwatched her in silence.\r\n\r\n\'I am willing to marry you whenever you choose,\' she said at last.\r\n\r\n\'I have made all the necessary arrangements.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have spoken to me of your mother. Will you take me to her at once.\'\r\n\r\nThe shadow of a smile crossed his lips.\r\n\r\n\'If you wish it.\'\r\n\r\nHaddo told her that they could be married before the Consul early enough\r\non the Thursday morning to catch a train for England. She left everything\r\nin his hands.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m desperately unhappy,\' she said dully.\r\n\r\nOliver laid his hands upon her shoulders and looked into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Go home, and you will forget your tears. I command you to be happy.\'\r\n\r\nThen it seemed that the bitter struggle between the good and the evil in\r\nher was done, and the evil had conquered. She felt on a sudden curiously\r\nelated. It seemed no longer to matter that she deceived her faithful\r\nfriends. She gave a bitter laugh, as she thought how easy it was to\r\nhoodwink them.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWednesday happened to be Arthur\'s birthday, and he asked her to dine with\r\nhim alone.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll do ourselves proud, and hang the expense,\' he said.\r\n\r\nThey had arranged to eat at a fashionable restaurant on the other side of\r\nthe river, and soon after seven he fetched her. Margaret was dressed with\r\nexceeding care. She stood in the middle of the room, waiting for Arthur\'s\r\narrival, and surveyed herself in the glass. Susie thought she had never\r\nbeen more beautiful.\r\n\r\n\'I think you\'ve grown more pleasing to look upon than you ever were,\' she\r\nsaid. \'I don\'t know what it is that has come over you of late, but\r\nthere\'s a depth in your eyes that is quite new. It gives you an odd\r\nmysteriousness which is very attractive.\'\r\n\r\nKnowing Susie\'s love for Arthur, she wondered whether her friend was not\r\nheartbroken as she compared her own plainness with the radiant beauty\r\nthat was before her. Arthur came in, and Margaret did not move. He\r\nstopped at the door to look at her. Their eyes met. His heart beat\r\nquickly, and yet he was seized with awe. His good fortune was too great\r\nto bear, when he thought that this priceless treasure was his. He could\r\nhave knelt down and worshipped as though a goddess of old Greece stood\r\nbefore him. And to him also her eyes had changed. They had acquired a\r\nburning passion which disturbed and yet enchanted him. It seemed that the\r\nlovely girl was changed already into a lovely woman. An enigmatic smile\r\ncame to her lips.\r\n\r\n\'Are you pleased?\' she asked.\r\n\r\nArthur came forward and Margaret put her hands on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\'You have scent on,\' he said.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised, for she had never used it before. It was a faint,\r\nalmost acrid perfume that he did not know. It reminded him vaguely of\r\nthose odours which he remembered in his childhood in the East. It was\r\nremote and strange. It gave Margaret a new and troubling charm. There had\r\never been something cold in her statuesque beauty, but this touch somehow\r\ncuriously emphasized her sex. Arthur\'s lips twitched, and his gaunt face\r\ngrew pale with passion. His emotion was so great that it was nearly pain.\r\nHe was puzzled, for her eyes expressed things that he had never seen in\r\nthem before.\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t you kiss me?\' she said.\r\n\r\nShe did not see Susie, but knew that a quick look of anguish crossed her\r\nface. Margaret drew Arthur towards her. His hands began to tremble. He\r\nhad never ventured to express the passion that consumed him, and when he\r\nkissed her it was with a restraint that was almost brotherly. Now their\r\nlips met. Forgetting that anyone else was in the room, he flung his arms\r\naround Margaret. She had never kissed him in that way before, and the\r\nrapture was intolerable. Her lips were like living fire. He could not\r\ntake his own away. He forgot everything. All his strength, all his\r\nself-control, deserted him. It crossed his mind that at this moment he\r\nwould willingly die. But the delight of it was so great that he could\r\nscarcely withhold a cry of agony. At length Susie\'s voice reminded him\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\'You\'d far better go out to dinner instead of behaving like a pair of\r\ncomplete idiots.\'\r\n\r\nShe tried to make her tone as flippant as the words, but her voice was\r\ncut by a pang of agony. With a little laugh, Margaret withdrew from\r\nArthur\'s embrace and lightly looked at her friend. Susie\'s brave smile\r\ndied away as she caught this glance, for there was in it a malicious\r\nhatred that startled her. It was so unexpected that she was terrified.\r\nWhat had she done? She was afraid, dreadfully afraid, that Margaret had\r\nguessed her secret. Arthur stood as if his senses had left him, quivering\r\nstill with the extremity of passion.\r\n\r\n\'Susie says we must go,\' smiled Margaret.\r\n\r\nHe could not speak. He could not regain the conventional manner of polite\r\nsociety. Very pale, like a man suddenly awaked from deep sleep, he went\r\nout at Margaret\'s side. They walked along the passage. Though the door\r\nwas closed behind them and they were out of earshot, Margaret seemed not\r\nwithstanding to hear Susie\'s passionate sobbing. It gave her a horrible\r\ndelight. The tavern to which they went was on the Boulevard des Italiens,\r\nand at this date the most frequented in Paris. It was crowded, but Arthur\r\nhad reserved a table in the middle of the room. Her radiant loveliness\r\nmade people stare at Margaret as she passed, and her consciousness of the\r\nadmiration she excited increased her beauty. She was satisfied that amid\r\nthat throng of the best-dressed women in the world she had cause to envy\r\nno one. The gaiety was charming. Shaded lights gave an opulent cosiness\r\nto the scene, and there were flowers everywhere. Innumerable mirrors\r\nreflected women of the world, admirably gowned, actresses of renown, and\r\nfashionable courtesans. The noise was very great. A Hungarian band played\r\nin a distant corner, but the music was drowned by the loud talking of\r\nexcited men and the boisterous laughter of women. It was plain that\r\npeople had come to spend their money with a lavish hand. The vivacious\r\ncrowd was given over with all its heart to the pleasure of the fleeting\r\nmoment. Everyone had put aside grave thoughts and sorrow.\r\n\r\nMargaret had never been in better spirits. The champagne went quickly to\r\nher head, and she talked all manner of charming nonsense. Arthur was\r\nenchanted. He was very proud, very pleased, and very happy. They talked\r\nof all the things they would do when they were married. They talked of\r\nthe places they must go to, of their home and of the beautiful things\r\nwith which they would fill it. Margaret\'s animation was extraordinary.\r\nArthur was amused at her delight with the brightness of the place, with\r\nthe good things they ate, and with the wine. Her laughter was like a\r\nrippling brook. Everything tended to take him out of his usual reserve.\r\nLife was very pleasing, at that moment, and he felt singularly joyful.\r\n\r\n\'Let us drink to the happiness of our life,\' he said.\r\n\r\nThey touched glasses. He could not take his eyes away from her.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re simply wonderful tonight,\' he said. \'I\'m almost afraid of my good\r\nfortune.\'\r\n\r\n\'What is there to be afraid of?\' she cried.\r\n\r\n\'I should like to lose something I valued in order to propitiate the\r\nfates. I am too happy now. Everything goes too well with me.\'\r\n\r\nShe gave a soft, low laugh and stretched out her hand on the table. No\r\nsculptor could have modelled its exquisite delicacy. She wore only one\r\nring, a large emerald which Arthur had given her on their engagement. He\r\ncould not resist taking her hand.\r\n\r\n\'Would you like to go on anywhere?\' he said, when they had finished\r\ndinner and were drinking their coffee.\r\n\r\n\'No, let us stay here. I must go to bed early, as I have a tiring day\r\nbefore me tomorrow.\'\r\n\r\n\'What are you going to do?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing of any importance,\' she laughed.\r\n\r\nPresently the diners began to go in little groups, and Margaret suggested\r\nthat they should saunter towards the Madeleine. The night was fine, but\r\nrather cold, and the broad avenue was crowded. Margaret watched the\r\npeople. It was no less amusing than a play. In a little while, they took\r\na cab and drove through the streets, silent already, that led to the\r\nquarter of the Montparnasse. They sat in silence, and Margaret nestled\r\nclose to Arthur. He put his arm around her waist. In the shut cab that\r\nfaint, oriental odour rose again to his nostrils, and his head reeled as\r\nit had before dinner.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve made me very happy, Margaret,\' he whispered. \'I feel that,\r\nhowever long I live, I shall never have a happier day than this.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you love me very much?\' she asked, lightly.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, but took her face in his hands and kissed her\r\npassionately. They arrived at Margaret\'s house, and she tripped up\r\nto the door. She held out her hand to him, smiling.\r\n\r\n\'Goodnight.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s dreadful to think that I must spend a dozen hours without seeing\r\nyou. When may I come?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not in the morning, because I shall be too busy. Come at twelve.\'\r\n\r\nShe remembered that her train started exactly at that hour. The door was\r\nopened, and with a little wave of the hand she disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\nSusie stared without comprehension at the note that announced Margaret\'s\r\nmarriage. It was a _petit bleu_ sent off from the Gare du Nord, and ran\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nWhen you receive this I shall be on my way to London. I was married to\r\nOliver Haddo this morning. I love him as I never loved Arthur. I have\r\nacted in this manner because I thought I had gone too far with Arthur to\r\nmake an explanation possible. Please tell him.\r\n\r\nMARGARET\r\n\r\nSusie was filled with dismay. She did not know what to do nor what to\r\nthink. There was a knock at the door, and she knew it must be Arthur, for\r\nhe was expected at midday. She decided quickly that it was impossible to\r\nbreak the news to him then and there. It was needful first to find out\r\nall manner of things, and besides, it was incredible. Making up her mind,\r\nshe opened the door.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'m so sorry Margaret isn\'t here,\' she said. \'A friend of hers is\r\nill and sent for her suddenly.\'\r\n\r\n\'What a bore!\' answered Arthur. \'Mrs Bloomfield as usual, I suppose?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you know she\'s been ill?\'\r\n\r\n\'Margaret has spent nearly every afternoon with her for some days.\'\r\n\r\nSusie did not answer. This was the first she had heard of Mrs\r\nBloomfield\'s illness, and it was news that Margaret was in the habit\r\nof visiting her. But her chief object at this moment was to get rid\r\nof Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'Won\'t you come back at five o\'clock?\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'But, look here, why shouldn\'t we lunch together, you and I?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m very sorry, but I\'m expecting somebody in.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, all right. Then I\'ll come back at five.\'\r\n\r\nHe nodded and went out. Susie read the brief note once more, and\r\nasked herself if it could possibly be true. The callousness of it was\r\nappalling. She went to Margaret\'s room and saw that everything was in\r\nits place. It did not look as if the owner had gone on a journey. But\r\nthen she noticed that a number of letters had been destroyed. She opened\r\na drawer and found that Margaret\'s trinkets were gone. An idea struck\r\nher. Margaret had bought lately a number of clothes, and these she had\r\ninsisted should be sent to her dressmaker, saying that it was needless\r\nto cumber their little apartment with them. They could stay there till\r\nshe returned to England a few weeks later for her marriage, and it would\r\nbe simpler to despatch them all from one place. Susie went out. At the\r\ndoor it occurred to her to ask the _concierge_ if she knew where Margaret\r\nhad gone that morning.\r\n\r\n\'_Parfaitement, Mademoiselle_,\' answered the old woman. \'I heard her tell\r\nthe coachman to go to the British Consulate.\'\r\n\r\nThe last doubt was leaving Susie. She went to the dressmaker and there\r\ndiscovered that by Margaret\'s order the boxes containing her things had\r\ngone on the previous day to the luggage office of the Gare du Nord.\r\n\r\n\'I hope you didn\'t let them go till your bill was paid,\' said Susie\r\nlightly, as though in jest.\r\n\r\nThe dressmaker laughed.\r\n\r\n\'Mademoiselle paid for everything two or three days ago.\'\r\n\r\nWith indignation, Susie realised that Margaret had not only taken away\r\nthe trousseau bought for her marriage with Arthur; but, since she was\r\nherself penniless, had paid for it with the money which he had generously\r\ngiven her. Susie drove then to Mrs Bloomfield, who at once reproached her\r\nfor not coming to see her.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sorry, but I\'ve been exceedingly busy, and I knew that Margaret was\r\nlooking after you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve not seen Margaret for three weeks,\' said the invalid.\r\n\r\n\'Haven\'t you? I thought she dropped in quite often.\'\r\n\r\nSusie spoke as though the matter were of no importance. She asked herself\r\nnow where Margaret could have spent those afternoons. By a great effort\r\nshe forced herself to speak of casual things with the garrulous old lady\r\nlong enough to make her visit seem natural. On leaving her, she went to\r\nthe Consulate, and her last doubt was dissipated. Then nothing remained\r\nbut to go home and wait for Arthur. Her first impulse had been to see Dr\r\nPorhoet and ask for his advice; but, even if he offered to come back with\r\nher to the studio, his presence would be useless. She must see Arthur by\r\nhimself. Her heart was wrung as she thought of the man\'s agony when he\r\nknew the truth. She had confessed to herself long before that she loved\r\nhim passionately, and it seemed intolerable that she of all persons must\r\nbear him this great blow.\r\n\r\nShe sat in the studio, counting the minutes, and thought with a bitter\r\nsmile that his eagerness to see Margaret would make him punctual. She had\r\neaten nothing since the _petit dejeuner_ of the morning, and she was\r\nfaint with hunger. But she had not the heart to make herself tea. At last\r\nhe came. He entered joyfully and looked around.\r\n\r\n\'Is Margaret not here yet?\' he asked, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\'Won\'t you sit down?\'\r\n\r\nHe did not notice that her voice was strange, nor that she kept her eyes\r\naverted.\r\n\r\n\'How lazy you are,\' he cried. \'You haven\'t got the tea.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr Burdon, I have something to say to you. It will cause you very great\r\npain.\'\r\n\r\nHe observed now the hoarseness of her tone. He sprang to his feet, and\r\na thousand fancies flashed across his brain. Something horrible had\r\nhappened to Margaret. She was ill. His terror was so great that he could\r\nnot speak. He put out his hands as does a blind man. Susie had to make an\r\neffort to go on. But she could not. Her voice was choked, and she began\r\nto cry. Arthur trembled as though he were seized with ague. She gave him\r\nthe letter.\r\n\r\n\'What does it mean?\'\r\n\r\nHe looked at her vacantly. Then she told him all that she had done that\r\nday and the places to which she had been.\r\n\r\n\'When you thought she was spending every afternoon with Mrs Bloomfield,\r\nshe was with that man. She made all the arrangements with the utmost\r\ncare. It was quite premeditated.\'\r\n\r\nArthur sat down and leaned his head on his hand. He turned his back\r\nto her, so that she should not see his face. They remained in perfect\r\nsilence. And it was so terrible that Susie began to cry quietly. She knew\r\nthat the man she loved was suffering an agony greater than the agony of\r\ndeath, and she could not help him. Rage flared up in her heart, and\r\nhatred for Margaret.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it\'s infamous!\' she cried suddenly. \'She\'s lied to you, she\'s been\r\nodiously deceitful. She must be vile and heartless. She must be rotten to\r\nthe very soul.\'\r\n\r\nHe turned round sharply, and his voice was hard.\r\n\r\n\'I forbid you to say anything against her.\'\r\n\r\nSusie gave a little gasp. He had never spoken to her before in anger. She\r\nflashed out bitterly.\r\n\r\n\'Can you love her still, when she\'s shown herself capable of such vile\r\ntreachery? For nearly a month this man must have been making love to her,\r\nand she\'s listened to all we said of him. She\'s pretended to hate the\r\nsight of him, I\'ve seen her cut him in the street. She\'s gone on with all\r\nthe preparations for your marriage. She must have lived in a world of\r\nlies, and you never suspected anything because you had an unalterable\r\nbelief in her love and truthfulness. She owes everything to you. For four\r\nyears she\'s lived on your charity. She was only able to be here because\r\nyou gave her money to carry out a foolish whim, and the very clothes on\r\nher back were paid for by you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t help it if she didn\'t love me,\' he cried desperately.\r\n\r\n\'You know just as well as I do that she pretended to love you. Oh, she\'s\r\nbehaved shamefully. There can be no excuse for her.\'\r\n\r\nHe looked at Susie with haggard, miserable eyes.\r\n\r\n\'How can you be so cruel? For God\'s sake don\'t make it harder.\'\r\n\r\nThere was an indescribable agony in his voice. And as if his own words of\r\npain overcame the last barrier of his self-control, he broke down. He hid\r\nhis face in his hands and sobbed. Susie was horribly conscience-stricken.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'m so sorry,\' she said. \'I didn\'t mean to say such hateful things.\r\nI didn\'t mean to be unkind. I ought to have remembered how passionately\r\nyou love her.\'\r\n\r\nIt was very painful to see the effort he made to regain his self-command.\r\nSusie suffered as much as he did. Her impulse was to throw herself on her\r\nknees, and kiss his hands, and comfort him; but she knew that he was\r\ninterested in her only because she was Margaret\'s friend. At last he\r\ngot up and, taking his pipe from his pocket, filled it silently. She was\r\nterrified at the look on his face. The first time she had ever seen him,\r\nSusie wondered at the possibility of self-torture which was in that\r\nrough-hewn countenance; but she had never dreamed that it could express\r\nsuch unutterable suffering. Its lines were suddenly changed, and it was\r\nterrible to look upon.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t believe it\'s true,\' he muttered. \'I can\'t believe it.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door, and Arthur gave a startled cry.\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps she\'s come back.\'\r\n\r\nHe opened it hurriedly, his face suddenly lit up by expectation; but it\r\nwas Dr Porhoet.\r\n\r\n\'How do you do?\' said the Frenchman. \'What is happening?\'\r\n\r\nHe looked round and caught the dismay that was on the faces of Arthur and\r\nSusie.\r\n\r\n\'Where is Miss Margaret? I thought you must be giving a party.\'\r\n\r\nThere was something in his manner that made Susie ask why.\r\n\r\n\'I received a telegram from Mr Haddo this morning.\'\r\n\r\nHe took it from his pocket and handed it to Susie. She read it and passed\r\nit to Arthur. It said:\r\n\r\nCome to the studio at five. High jinks.\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo\r\n\r\n\'Margaret was married to Mr Haddo this morning,\' said Arthur, quietly. \'I\r\nunderstand they have gone to England.\'\r\n\r\nSusie quickly told the doctor the few facts they knew. He was as\r\nsurprised, as distressed, as they.\r\n\r\n\'But what is the explanation of it all?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nArthur shrugged his shoulders wearily.\r\n\r\n\'She cared for Haddo more than she cared for me, I suppose. It is\r\nnatural enough that she should go away in this fashion rather than offer\r\nexplanations. I suppose she wanted to save herself a scene she thought\r\nmight be rather painful.\'\r\n\r\n\'When did you see her last?\'\r\n\r\n\'We spent yesterday evening together.\'\r\n\r\n\'And did she not show in any way that she contemplated such a step?\'\r\n\r\nArthur shook his head.\r\n\r\n\'You had no quarrel?\'\r\n\r\n\'We\'ve never quarrelled. She was in the best of spirits. I\'ve never seen\r\nher more gay. She talked the whole time of our house in London, and of\r\nthe places we must visit when we were married.\'\r\n\r\nAnother contraction of pain passed over his face as he remembered that\r\nshe had been more affectionate than she had ever been before. The fire\r\nof her kisses still burnt upon his lips. He had spent a night of almost\r\nsleepless ecstasy because he had been certain for the first time that the\r\npassion which consumed him burnt in her heart too. Words were dragged out\r\nof him against his will.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'m sure she loved me.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Susie\'s eyes were fixed on Haddo\'s cruel telegram. She seemed\r\nto hear his mocking laughter.\r\n\r\n\'Margaret loathed Oliver Haddo with a hatred that was almost unnatural.\r\nIt was a physical repulsion like that which people sometimes have for\r\ncertain animals. What can have happened to change it into so great a love\r\nthat it has made her capable of such villainous acts?\'\r\n\r\n\'We mustn\'t be unfair to him,\' said Arthur. \'He put our backs up, and we\r\nwere probably unjust. He has done some very remarkable things in his day,\r\nand he\'s no fool. It\'s possible that some people wouldn\'t mind the\r\neccentricities which irritated us. He\'s certainly of very good family and\r\nhe\'s rich. In many ways it\'s an excellent match for Margaret.\'\r\n\r\nHe was trying with all his might to find excuses for her. It would not\r\nmake her treachery so intolerable if he could persuade himself that Haddo\r\nhad qualities which might explain her infatuation. But as his enemy stood\r\nbefore his fancy, monstrously obese, vulgar, and overbearing, a shudder\r\npassed through him. The thought of Margaret in that man\'s arms tortured\r\nhim as though his flesh were torn with iron hooks.\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps it\'s not true. Perhaps she\'ll return,\' he cried.\r\n\r\n\'Would you take her back if she came to you?\' asked Susie.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think anything she can do has the power to make me love her less?\r\nThere must be reasons of which we know nothing that caused her to do all\r\nshe has done. I daresay it was inevitable from the beginning.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet got up and walked across the room.\r\n\r\n\'If a woman had done me such an injury that I wanted to take some\r\nhorrible vengeance, I think I could devise nothing more subtly cruel than\r\nto let her be married to Oliver Haddo.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, poor thing, poor thing!\' said Arthur. \'If I could only suppose she\r\nwould be happy! The future terrifies me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder if she knew that Haddo had sent that telegram,\' said Susie.\r\n\r\n\'What can it matter?\'\r\n\r\nShe turned to Arthur gravely.\r\n\r\n\'Do you remember that day, in this studio, when he kicked Margaret\'s\r\ndog, and you thrashed him? Well, afterwards, when he thought no one saw\r\nhim, I happened to catch sight of his face. I never saw in my life such\r\nmalignant hatred. It was the face of a fiend of wickedness. And when\r\nhe tried to excuse himself, there was a cruel gleam in his eyes which\r\nterrified me. I warned you; I told you that he had made up his mind to\r\nrevenge himself, but you laughed at me. And then he seemed to go out of\r\nour lives and I thought no more about it. I wonder why he sent Dr Porhoet\r\nhere today. He must have known that the doctor would hear of his\r\nhumiliation, and he may have wished that he should be present at his\r\ntriumph. I think that very moment he made up his mind to be even with\r\nyou, and he devised this odious scheme.\'\r\n\r\n\'How could he know that it was possible to carry out such a horrible\r\nthing?\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder if Miss Boyd is right,\' murmured the doctor. \'After all, if\r\nyou come to think of it, he must have thought that he couldn\'t hurt\r\nyou more. The whole thing is fiendish. He took away from you all your\r\nhappiness. He must have known that you wanted nothing in the world more\r\nthan to make Margaret your wife, and he has not only prevented that, but\r\nhe has married her himself. And he can only have done it by poisoning\r\nher mind, by warping her very character. Her soul must be horribly\r\nbesmirched; he must have entirely changed her personality.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, I feel that,\' cried Arthur. \'If Margaret has broken her word to me,\r\nif she\'s gone to him so callously, it\'s because it\'s not the Margaret I\r\nknow. Some devil must have taken possession of her body.\'\r\n\r\n\'You use a figure of speech. I wonder if it can possibly be a reality.\'\r\n\r\nArthur and Dr Porhoet looked at Susie with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t believe that Margaret could have done such a thing,\' she went\r\non. \'The more I think of it, the more incredible it seems. I\'ve known\r\nMargaret for years, and she was incapable of deceit. She was very\r\nkind-hearted. She was honest and truthful. In the first moment of\r\nhorror, I was only indignant, but I don\'t want to think too badly of\r\nher. There is only one way to excuse her, and that is by supposing she\r\nacted under some strange compulsion.\'\r\n\r\nArthur clenched his hands.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m not sure if that doesn\'t make it more awful than before. If he\'s\r\nmarried her, not because he cares, but in order to hurt me, what life\r\nwill she lead with him? We know how heartless he is, how vindictive, how\r\nhorribly cruel.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dr Porhoet knows more about these things than we do,\' said Susie. \'Is it\r\npossible that Haddo can have cast some spell upon her that would make her\r\nunable to resist his will? Is it possible that he can have got such an\r\ninfluence over her that her whole character was changed?\'\r\n\r\n\'How can I tell?\' cried the doctor helplessly. \'I have heard that such\r\nthings may happen. I have read of them, but I have no proof. In these\r\nmatters all is obscurity. The adepts in magic make strange claims. Arthur\r\nis a man of science, and he knows what the limits of hypnotism are.\'\r\n\r\n\'We know that Haddo had powers that other men have not,\' answered Susie.\r\n\'Perhaps there was enough truth in his extravagant pretensions to enable\r\nhim to do something that we can hardly imagine.\'\r\n\r\nArthur passed his hands wearily over his face.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m so broken, so confused, that I cannot think sanely. At this moment\r\neverything seems possible. My faith in all the truths that have supported\r\nme is tottering.\'\r\n\r\nFor a while they remained silent. Arthur\'s eyes rested on the chair in\r\nwhich Margaret had so often sat. An unfinished canvas still stood upon\r\nthe easel. It was Dr Porhoet who spoke at last.\r\n\r\n\'But even if there were some truth in Miss Boyd\'s suppositions, I don\'t\r\nsee how it can help you. You cannot do anything. You have no remedy,\r\nlegal or otherwise. Margaret is apparently a free agent, and she has\r\nmarried this man. It is plain that many people will think she has done\r\nmuch better in marrying a country gentleman than in marrying a young\r\nsurgeon. Her letter is perfectly lucid. There is no trace of compulsion.\r\nTo all intents and purposes she has married him of her own free-will, and\r\nthere is nothing to show that she desires to be released from him or from\r\nthe passion which we may suppose enslaves her.\'\r\n\r\nWhat he said was obviously true, and no reply was possible.\r\n\r\n\'The only thing is to grin and bear it,\' said Arthur, rising.\r\n\r\n\'Where are you going?\' said Susie.\r\n\r\n\'I think I want to get away from Paris. Here everything will remind me of\r\nwhat I have lost. I must get back to my work.\'\r\n\r\nHe had regained command over himself, and except for the hopeless woe of\r\nhis face, which he could not prevent from being visible, he was as calm\r\nas ever. He held out his hand to Susie.\r\n\r\n\'I can only hope that you\'ll forget,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t wish to forget,\' he answered, shaking his head. \'It\'s possible\r\nthat you will hear from Margaret. She\'ll want the things that she has\r\nleft here, and I daresay will write to you. I should like you to tell her\r\nthat I bear her no ill-will for anything she has done, and I will never\r\nventure to reproach her. I don\'t know if I shall be able to do anything\r\nfor her, but I wish her to know that in any case and always I will do\r\neverything that she wants.\'\r\n\r\n\'If she writes to me, I will see that she is told,\' answered Susie\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\'And now goodbye.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t go to London till tomorrow. Shan\'t I see you in the morning?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think if you don\'t mind, I won\'t come here again. The sight of all\r\nthis rather disturbs me.\'\r\n\r\nAgain a contraction of pain passed across his eyes, and Susie saw that he\r\nwas using a superhuman effort to preserve the appearance of composure.\r\nShe hesitated a moment.\r\n\r\n\'Shall I never see you again?\' she said. \'I should be sorry to lose sight\r\nof you entirely.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should be sorry, too,\' he answered. \'I have learned how good and kind\r\nyou are, and I shall never forget that you are Margaret\'s friend. When\r\nyou come to London, I hope that you will let me know.\'\r\n\r\nHe went out. Dr Porhoet, his hands behind his back, began to walk up and\r\ndown the room. At last he turned to Susie.\r\n\r\n\'There is one thing that puzzles me,\' he said. \'Why did he marry her?\'\r\n\r\n\'You heard what Arthur said,\' answered Susie bitterly. \'Whatever\r\nhappened, he would have taken her back. The other man knew that he could\r\nonly bind her to him securely by going through the ceremonies of\r\nmarriage.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet shrugged his shoulders, and presently he left her. When Susie\r\nwas alone she began to weep broken-heartedly, not for herself, but\r\nbecause Arthur suffered an agony that was hardly endurable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur went back to London next day.\r\n\r\nSusie felt it impossible any longer to stay in the deserted studio, and\r\naccepted a friend\'s invitation to spend the winter in Italy. The good Dr\r\nPorhoet remained in Paris with his books and his occult studies.\r\n\r\nSusie travelled slowly through Tuscany and Umbria. Margaret had not\r\nwritten to her, and Susie, on leaving Paris, had sent her friend\'s\r\nbelongings to an address from which she knew they would eventually be\r\nforwarded. She could not bring herself to write. In answer to a note\r\nannouncing her change of plans, Arthur wrote briefly that he had much\r\nwork to do and was delivering a new course of lectures at St. Luke\'s; he\r\nhad lately been appointed visiting surgeon to another hospital, and his\r\nprivate practice was increasing. He did not mention Margaret. His letter\r\nwas abrupt, formal, and constrained. Susie, reading it for the tenth\r\ntime, could make little of it. She saw that he wrote only from civility,\r\nwithout interest; and there was nothing to indicate his state of mind.\r\nSusie and her companion had made up their minds to pass some weeks in\r\nRome; and here, to her astonishment, Susie had news of Haddo and his\r\nwife. It appeared that they had spent some time there, and the little\r\nEnglish circle was talking still of their eccentricities. They travelled\r\nin some state, with a courier and a suite of servants; they had taken a\r\ncarriage and were in the habit of driving every afternoon on the Pincio.\r\nHaddo had excited attention by the extravagance of his costume, and\r\nMargaret by her beauty; she was to be seen in her box at the opera every\r\nnight, and her diamonds were the envy of all beholders. Though people had\r\nlaughed a good deal at Haddo\'s pretentiousness, and been exasperated by\r\nhis arrogance, they could not fail to be impressed by his obvious wealth.\r\nBut finally the pair had disappeared suddenly without saying a word to\r\nanybody. A good many bills remained unpaid, but these, Susie learnt, had\r\nbeen settled later. It was reported that they were now in Monte Carlo.\r\n\r\n\'Did they seem happy?\' Susie asked the gossiping friend who gave her this\r\nscanty information.\r\n\r\n\'I think so. After all, Mrs Haddo has almost everything that a woman\r\ncan want, riches, beauty, nice clothes, jewels. She would be very\r\nunreasonable not to be happy.\'\r\n\r\nSusie had meant to pass the later spring on the Riviera, but when she\r\nheard that the Haddos were there, she hesitated. She did not want to\r\nrun the risk of seeing them, and yet she had a keen desire to find out\r\nexactly how things were going. Curiosity and distaste struggled in her\r\nmind, but curiosity won; and she persuaded her friend to go to Monte\r\nCarlo instead of to Beaulieu. At first Susie did not see the Haddos; but\r\nrumour was already much occupied with them, and she had only to keep her\r\nears open. In that strange place, where all that is extravagant and evil,\r\nall that is morbid, insane, and fantastic, is gathered together, the\r\nHaddos were in fit company. They were notorious for their assiduity at\r\nthe tables and for their luck, for the dinners and suppers they gave at\r\nplaces frequented by the very opulent, and for their eccentric\r\nappearance. It was a complex picture that Susie put together from the\r\nscraps of information she collected. After two or three days she saw\r\nthem at the tables, but they were so absorbed in their game that she felt\r\nquite safe from discovery. Margaret was playing, but Haddo stood behind\r\nher and directed her movements. Their faces were extraordinarily intent.\r\nSusie fixed her attention on Margaret, for in what she had heard of her\r\nshe had been quite unable to recognize the girl who had been her friend.\r\nAnd what struck her most now was that there was in Margaret\'s expression\r\na singular likeness to Haddo\'s. Notwithstanding her exquisite beauty, she\r\nhad a curiously vicious look, which suggested that somehow she saw\r\nliterally with Oliver\'s eyes. They had won great sums that evening, and\r\nmany persons watched them. It appeared that they played always in this\r\nfashion, Margaret putting on the stakes and Haddo telling her what to do\r\nand when to stop. Susie heard two Frenchmen talking of them. She listened\r\nwith all her ears. She flushed as she heard one of them make an\r\nobservation about Margaret which was more than coarse. The other laughed.\r\n\r\n\'It is incredible,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'I assure you it\'s true. They have been married six months, and she is\r\nstill only his wife in name. The superstitious through all the ages have\r\nbelieved in the power of virginity, and the Church has made use of the\r\nidea for its own ends. The man uses her simply as a mascot.\'\r\n\r\nThe men laughed, and their conversation proceeded so grossly that Susie\'s\r\ncheeks burned. But what she had heard made her look at Margaret more\r\nclosely still. She was radiant. Susie could not deny that something had\r\ncome to her that gave a new, enigmatic savour to her beauty. She was\r\ndressed more gorgeously than Susie\'s fastidious taste would have\r\npermitted; and her diamonds, splendid in themselves, were too magnificent\r\nfor the occasion. At last, sweeping up the money, Haddo touched her on\r\nthe shoulder, and she rose. Behind her was standing a painted woman of\r\nnotorious disreputability. Susie was astonished to see Margaret smile and\r\nnod as she passed her.\r\n\r\nSusie learnt that the Haddos had a suite of rooms at the most expensive\r\nof the hotels. They lived in a whirl of gaiety. They knew few English\r\nexcept those whose reputations were damaged, but seemed to prefer the\r\nsociety of those foreigners whose wealth and eccentricities made them the\r\ncynosure of that little world. Afterwards, she often saw them, in company\r\nof Russian Grand-Dukes and their mistresses, of South American women with\r\nprodigious diamonds, of noble gamblers and great ladies of doubtful fame,\r\nof strange men overdressed and scented. Rumour was increasingly busy with\r\nthem. Margaret moved among all those queer people with a cold\r\nmysteriousness that excited the curiosity of the sated idlers. The\r\nsuggestion which Susie overheard was repeated more circumstantially. But\r\nto this was joined presently the report of orgies that were enacted in\r\nthe darkened sitting-room of the hotel, when all that was noble and\r\nvicious in Monte Carlo was present. Oliver\'s eccentric imagination\r\ninvented whimsical festivities. He had a passion for disguise, and he\r\ngave a fancy-dress party of which fabulous stories were told. He sought\r\nto revive the mystical ceremonies of old religions, and it was reported\r\nthat horrible rites had been performed in the garden of the villa, under\r\nthe shining moon, in imitation of those he had seen in Eastern places. It\r\nwas said that Haddo had magical powers of extraordinary character, and\r\nthe tired imagination of those pleasure-seekers was tickled by his talk\r\nof black art. Some even asserted that the blasphemous ceremonies of the\r\nBlack Mass had been celebrated in the house of a Polish Prince. People\r\nbabbled of satanism and of necromancy. Haddo was thought to be immersed\r\nin occult studies for the performance of a magical operation; and some\r\nsaid that he was occupied with the Magnum Opus, the greatest and most\r\nfantastic of alchemical experiments. Gradually these stories were\r\nnarrowed down to the monstrous assertion that he was attempting to create\r\nliving beings. He had explained at length to somebody that magical\r\nreceipts existed for the manufacture of _homunculi_.\r\n\r\nHaddo was known generally by the name he was pleased to give himself.\r\nThe Brother of the Shadow; but most people used it in derision, for\r\nit contrasted absurdly with his astonishing bulk. They were amused or\r\noutraged by his vanity, but they could not help talking about him, and\r\nSusie knew well enough by now that nothing pleased him more. His exploits\r\nas a lion-hunter were well known, and it was reported that human blood\r\nwas on his hands. It was soon discovered that he had a queer power over\r\nanimals, so that in his presence they were seized with unaccountable\r\nterror. He succeeded in surrounding himself with an atmosphere of the\r\nfabulous, and nothing that was told of him was too extravagant for\r\nbelief. But unpleasant stories were circulated also, and someone related\r\nthat he had been turned out of a club in Vienna for cheating at cards.\r\nHe played many games, but here, as at Oxford, it was found that he was\r\nan unscrupulous opponent. And those old rumours followed him that he took\r\nstrange drugs. He was supposed to have odious vices, and people whispered\r\nto one another of scandals that had been with difficulty suppressed. No\r\none quite understood on what terms he was with his wife, and it was\r\nvaguely asserted that he was at times brutally cruel to her. Susie\'s\r\nheart sank when she heard this; but on the few occasions upon which she\r\ncaught sight of Margaret, she seemed in the highest spirits. One story\r\ninexpressibly shocked her. After lunching at some restaurant, Haddo gave\r\na bad louis among the money with which he paid the bill, and there was a\r\ndisgraceful altercation with the waiter. He refused to change the coin\r\ntill a policeman was brought in. His guests were furious, and several\r\ntook the first opportunity to cut him dead. One of those present narrated\r\nthe scene to Susie, and she was told that Margaret laughed unconcernedly\r\nwith her neighbour while the sordid quarrel was proceeding. The man\'s\r\nblood was as good as his fortune was substantial, but it seemed to please\r\nhim to behave like an adventurer. The incident was soon common property,\r\nand gradually the Haddos found themselves cold-shouldered. The persons\r\nwith whom they mostly consorted had reputations too delicate to stand the\r\nglare of publicity which shone upon all who were connected with him, and\r\nthe suggestion of police had thrown a shudder down many a spine. What had\r\nhappened in Rome happened here again: they suddenly disappeared.\r\n\r\nSusie had not been in London for some time, and as the spring advanced\r\nshe remembered that her friends would be glad to see her. It would be\r\ncharming to spend a few weeks there with an adequate income; for its\r\npleasures had hitherto been closed to her, and she looked forward to her\r\nvisit as if it were to a foreign city. But though she would not confess\r\nit to herself, her desire to see Arthur was the strongest of her motives.\r\nTime and absence had deadened a little the intensity of her feelings, and\r\nshe could afford to acknowledge that she regarded him with very great\r\naffection. She knew that he would never care for her, but she was content\r\nto be his friend. She could think of him without pain.\r\n\r\nSusie stayed in Paris for three weeks to buy some of the clothes which\r\nshe asserted were now her only pleasure in life, and then went to London.\r\n\r\nShe wrote to Arthur, and he invited her at once to lunch with him at a\r\nrestaurant. She was vexed, for she felt they could have spoken more\r\nfreely in his own house; but as soon as she saw him, she realized that\r\nhe had chosen their meeting-place deliberately. The crowd of people that\r\nsurrounded them, the gaiety, the playing of the band, prevented any\r\nintimacy of conversation. They were forced to talk of commonplaces.\r\nSusie was positively terrified at the change that had taken place in him.\r\nHe looked ten years older; he had lost flesh, and his hair was sprinkled\r\nwith white. His face was extraordinarily drawn, and his eyes were weary\r\nfrom lack of sleep. But what most struck her was the change in his\r\nexpression. The look of pain which she had seen on his face that last\r\nevening in the studio was now become settled, so that it altered the\r\nlines of his countenance. It was harrowing to look at him. He was more\r\nsilent than ever, and when he spoke it was in a strange low voice that\r\nseemed to come from a long way off. To be with him made Susie curiously\r\nuneasy, for there was a strenuousness in him which deprived his manner of\r\nall repose. One of the things that had pleased her in him formerly was\r\nthe tranquillity which gave one the impression that here was a man who\r\ncould be relied on in difficulties. At first she could not understand\r\nexactly what had happened, but in a moment saw that he was making an\r\nunceasing effort at self-control. He was never free from suffering and he\r\nwas constantly on the alert to prevent anyone from seeing it. The strain\r\ngave him a peculiar restlessness.\r\n\r\nBut he was gentler than he had ever been before. He seemed genuinely glad\r\nto see her and asked about her travels with interest. Susie led him to\r\ntalk of himself, and he spoke willingly enough of his daily round. He was\r\nearning a good deal of money, and his professional reputation was making\r\nsteady progress. He worked hard. Besides his duties at the two hospitals\r\nwith which he was now connected, his teaching, and his private practice,\r\nhe had read of late one or two papers before scientific bodies, and was\r\nediting a large work on surgery.\r\n\r\n\'How on earth can you find time to do so much?\' asked Susie.\r\n\r\n\'I can do with less sleep than I used,\' he answered. \'It almost doubles\r\nmy working-day.\'\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly and looked down. His remark had given accidentally\r\nsome hint at the inner life which he was striving to conceal. Susie knew\r\nthat her suspicion was well-founded. She thought of the long hours he\r\nlay awake, trying in vain to drive from his mind the agony that tortured\r\nhim, and the short intervals of troubled sleep. She knew that he delayed\r\nas long as possible the fatal moment of going to bed, and welcomed the\r\nfirst light of day, which gave him an excuse for getting up. And because\r\nhe knew that he had divulged the truth he was embarrassed. They sat\r\nin awkward silence. To Susie, the tragic figure in front of her was\r\nsingularly impressive amid that lighthearted throng: all about them happy\r\npersons were enjoying the good things of life, talking, laughing, and\r\nmaking merry. She wondered what refinement of self-torture had driven him\r\nto choose that place to come to. He must hate it.\r\n\r\nWhen they finished luncheon, Susie took her courage in both hands.\r\n\r\n\'Won\'t you come back to my rooms for half an hour? We can\'t talk here.\'\r\n\r\nHe made an instinctive motion of withdrawal, as though he sought to\r\nescape. He did not answer immediately, and she insisted.\r\n\r\n\'You have nothing to do for an hour, and there are many things I want to\r\nspeak to you about\'\r\n\r\n\'The only way to be strong is never to surrender to one\'s weakness,\' he\r\nsaid, almost in a whisper, as though ashamed to talk so intimately.\r\n\r\n\'Then you won\'t come?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary to specify the matter which it was proposed to\r\ndiscuss. Arthur knew perfectly that Susie wished to talk of Margaret, and\r\nhe was too straightforward to pretend otherwise. Susie paused for one\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\'I was never able to give Margaret your message. She did not write to\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\nA certain wildness came into his eyes, as if the effort he made was\r\nalmost too much for him.\r\n\r\n\'I saw her in Monte Carlo,\' said Susie. \'I thought you might like to hear\r\nabout her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see that it can do any good,\' he answered.\r\n\r\nSusie made a little hopeless gesture. She was beaten.\r\n\r\n\'Shall we go?\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'You are not angry with me?\' he asked. \'I know you mean to be kind. I\'m\r\nvery grateful to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall never be angry with you,\' she smiled.\r\n\r\nArthur paid the bill, and they threaded their way among the tables. At\r\nthe door she held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\'I think you do wrong in shutting yourself away from all human\r\ncomradeship,\' she said, with that good-humoured smile of hers. \'You\r\nmust know that you will only grow absurdly morbid.\'\r\n\r\n\'I go out a great deal,\' he answered patiently, as though he reasoned\r\nwith a child. \'I make a point of offering myself distractions from my\r\nwork. I go to the opera two or three times a week.\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought you didn\'t care for music.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think I did,\' he answered. \'But I find it rests me.\'\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a weariness that was appalling. Susie had never beheld so\r\nplainly the torment of a soul in pain.\r\n\r\n\'Won\'t you let me come to the opera with you one night?\' she asked. \'Or\r\ndoes it bore you to see me?\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like it above all things,\' he smiled, quite brightly. \'You\'re\r\nlike a wonderful tonic. They\'re giving Tristan on Thursday. Shall we go\r\ntogether?\'\r\n\r\n\'I should enjoy it enormously.\'\r\n\r\nShe shook hands with him and jumped into a cab.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, poor thing!\' she murmured. \'Poor thing! What can I do for him?\'\r\n\r\nShe clenched, her hands when she thought of Margaret. It was monstrous\r\nthat she should have caused such havoc in that good, strong man.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I hope she\'ll suffer for it,\' she whispered vindictively. \'I hope\r\nshe\'ll suffer all the agony that he has suffered.\'\r\n\r\nSusie dressed herself for Covent Garden as only she could do. Her gown\r\npleased her exceedingly, not only because it was admirably made, but\r\nbecause it had cost far more than she could afford. To dress well was her\r\nonly extravagance. It was of taffeta silk, in that exquisite green which\r\nthe learned in such matters call _Eau de Nil_; and its beauty was\r\nenhanced by the old lace which had formed not the least treasured part\r\nof her inheritance. In her hair she wore an ornament of Spanish paste,\r\nof exquisite workmanship, and round her neck a chain which had once\r\nadorned that of a madonna in an Andalusian church. Her individuality\r\nmade even her plainness attractive. She smiled at herself in the glass\r\nruefully, because Arthur would never notice that she was perfectly\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nWhen she tripped down the stairs and across the pavement to the cab with\r\nwhich he fetched her, Susie held up her skirt with a grace she flattered\r\nherself was quite Parisian. As they drove along, she flirted a little\r\nwith her Spanish fan and stole a glance at herself in the glass. Her\r\ngloves were so long and so new and so expensive that she was really\r\nindifferent to Arthur\'s inattention.\r\n\r\nHer joyous temperament expanded like a spring flower when she found\r\nherself in the Opera House. She put up her glasses and examined the women\r\nas they came into the boxes of the Grand Tier. Arthur pointed out a\r\nnumber of persons whose names were familiar to her, but she felt the\r\neffort he was making to be amiable. The weariness of his mouth that\r\nevening was more noticeable because of the careless throng. But when\r\nthe music began he seemed to forget that any eye was upon him; he relaxed\r\nthe constant tension in which he held himself; and Susie, watching him\r\nsurreptitiously, saw the emotions chase one another across his face. It\r\nwas now very mobile. The passionate sounds ate into his soul, mingling\r\nwith his own love and his own sorrow, till he was taken out of himself;\r\nand sometimes he panted strangely. Through the interval he remained\r\nabsorbed in his emotion. He sat as quietly as before and did not speak a\r\nword. Susie understood why Arthur, notwithstanding his old indifference,\r\nnow showed such eager appreciation of music; it eased the pain he\r\nsuffered by transferring it to an ideal world, and his own grievous\r\nsorrow made the music so real that it gave him an enjoyment of\r\nextraordinary vehemence. When it was all over and Isolde had given her\r\nlast wail of sorrow, Arthur was so exhausted that he could hardly stir.\r\n\r\nBut they went out with the crowd, and while they were waiting in the\r\nvestibule for space to move in, a common friend came up to them. This\r\nwas Arbuthnot, an eye-specialist, whom Susie had met on the Riviera and\r\nwho, she presently discovered, was a colleague of Arthur\'s at St Luke\'s.\r\nHe was a prosperous bachelor with grey hair and a red, contented face,\r\nwell-to-do, for his practice was large, and lavish with his money. He\r\nhad taken Susie out to luncheon once or twice in Monte Carlo; for he\r\nliked women, pretty or plain, and she attracted him by her good-humour.\r\nHe rushed up to them now and wrung their hands. He spoke in a jovial\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\'The very people I wanted to see! Why haven\'t you been to see me, you\r\nwicked woman? I\'m sure your eyes are in a deplorable condition.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think I would let a bold, bad man like you stare into them with\r\nan ophthalmoscope?\' laughed Susie.\r\n\r\n\'Now look here, I want you both to do me a great favour. I\'m giving a\r\nsupper party at the Savoy, and two of my people have suddenly failed me.\r\nThe table is ordered for eight, and you must come and take their places.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid I must get home,\' said Arthur. \'I have a deuce of a lot of\r\nwork to do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense,\' answered Arbuthnot. \'You work much too hard, and a little\r\nrelaxation will do you good.\' He turned to Susie: \'I know you like\r\ncuriosities in human nature; I\'m having a man and his wife who will\r\npositively thrill you, they\'re so queer, and a lovely actress, and an\r\nawfully jolly American girl.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should love to come,\' said Susie, with an appealing look at Arthur,\r\n\'if only to show you how much more amusing I am than lovely actresses.\'\r\n\r\nArthur, forcing himself to smile, accepted the invitation. The specialist\r\npatted him cheerily on the back, and they agreed to meet at the Savoy.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s awfully good of you to come,\' said Susie, as they drove along. \'Do\r\nyou know, I\'ve never been there in my life, and I\'m palpitating with\r\nexcitement.\'\r\n\r\n\'What a selfish brute I was to refuse!\' he answered.\r\n\r\nWhen Susie came out of the dressing-room, she found Arthur waiting for\r\nher. She was in the best of spirits.\r\n\r\n\'Now you must say you like my frock. I\'ve seen six women turn green with\r\nenvy at the sight of it. They think I must be French, and they\'re sure\r\nI\'m not respectable.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is evidently a great compliment,\' he smiled.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Arbuthnot came up to them in his eager way and seized\r\ntheir arms.\r\n\r\n\'Come along. We\'re waiting for you. I\'ll just introduce you all round,\r\nand then we\'ll go in to supper.\'\r\n\r\nThey walked down the steps into the foyer, and he led them to a group of\r\npeople. They found themselves face to face with Oliver Haddo and\r\nMargaret.\r\n\r\n\'Mr Arthur Burdon--Mrs Haddo. Mr Burdon is a colleague of mine at St\r\nLuke\'s; and he will cut out your appendix in a shorter time than any man\r\nalive.\'\r\n\r\nArbuthnot rattled on. He did not notice that Arthur had grown ghastly\r\npale and that Margaret was blank with consternation. Haddo, his heavy\r\nface wreathed with smiles, stepped forward heartily. He seemed thoroughly\r\nto enjoy the situation.\r\n\r\n\'Mr Burdon is an old friend of ours,\' he said. \'In fact, it was he who\r\nintroduced me to my wife. And Miss Boyd and I have discussed Art and the\r\nImmortality of the Soul with the gravity due to such topics.\'\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand, and Susie took it. She had a horror of scenes, and,\r\nthough this encounter was as unexpected as it was disagreeable, she felt\r\nit needful to behave naturally. She shook hands with Margaret.\r\n\r\n\'How disappointing!\' cried their host. \'I was hoping to give Miss Boyd\r\nsomething quite new in the way of magicians, and behold! she knows all\r\nabout him.\'\r\n\r\n\'If she did, I\'m quite sure she wouldn\'t speak to me,\' said Oliver, with\r\na bantering smile.\r\n\r\nThey went into the supper-room.\r\n\r\n\'Now, how shall we sit?\' said Arbuthnot, glancing round the table.\r\n\r\nOliver looked at Arthur, and his eyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n\'You must really let my wife and Mr Burdon be together. They haven\'t seen\r\none another for so long that I\'m sure they have no end of things to talk\r\nabout.\' He chuckled to himself. \'And pray give me Miss Boyd, so that she\r\ncan abuse me to her heart\'s content.\'\r\n\r\nThis arrangement thoroughly suited the gay specialist, for he was able to\r\nput the beautiful actress on one side of him and the charming American on\r\nthe other. He rubbed his hands.\r\n\r\n\'I feel that we\'re going to have a delightful supper.\'\r\n\r\nOliver laughed boisterously. He took, as was his habit, the whole\r\nconversation upon himself, and Susie was obliged to confess that he\r\nwas at his best. There was a grotesque drollery about him that was very\r\ndiverting, and it was almost impossible to resist him. He ate and drank\r\nwith tremendous appetite. Susie thanked her stars at that moment that she\r\nwas a woman who knew by long practice how to conceal her feelings, for\r\nArthur, overcome with dismay at the meeting, sat in stony silence. But\r\nshe talked gaily. She chaffed Oliver as though he were an old friend, and\r\nlaughed vivaciously. She noticed meanwhile that Haddo, more extravagantly\r\ndressed than usual, had managed to get an odd fantasy into his evening\r\nclothes: he wore knee-breeches, which in itself was enough to excite\r\nattention; but his frilled shirt, his velvet collar, and oddly-cut satin\r\nwaistcoat gave him the appearance of a comic Frenchman. Now that she\r\nwas able to examine him more closely, she saw that in the last six months\r\nhe was grown much balder; and the shiny whiteness of his naked crown\r\ncontrasted oddly with the redness of his face. He was stouter, too, and\r\nthe fat hung in heavy folds under his chin; his paunch was preposterous.\r\nThe vivacity of his movements made his huge corpulence subtly alarming.\r\nHe was growing indeed strangely terrible in appearance. His eyes had\r\nstill that fixed, parallel look, but there was in them now at times a\r\nferocious gleam. Margaret was as beautiful as ever, but Susie noticed\r\nthat his influence was apparent in her dress; for there could be no doubt\r\nthat it had crossed the line of individuality and had degenerated into\r\nthe eccentric. Her gown was much too gorgeous. It told against the\r\nclassical character of her beauty. Susie shuddered a little, for it\r\nreminded her of a courtesan\'s.\r\n\r\nMargaret talked and laughed as much as her husband, but Susie could not\r\ntell whether this animation was affected or due to an utter callousness.\r\nHer voice seemed natural enough, yet it was inconceivable that she should\r\nbe so lighthearted. Perhaps she was trying to show that she was happy.\r\nThe supper proceeded, and the lights, the surrounding gaiety, the\r\nchampagne, made everyone more lively. Their host was in uproarious\r\nspirits. He told a story or two at which everyone laughed. Oliver Haddo\r\nhad an amusing anecdote handy. It was a little risky, but it was so\r\nfunnily narrated that everyone roared but Arthur, who remained in perfect\r\nsilence. Margaret had been drinking glass after glass of wine, and no\r\nsooner had her husband finished than she capped his story with another.\r\nBut whereas his was wittily immoral, hers was simply gross. At first the\r\nother women could not understand to what she was tending, but when they\r\nsaw, they looked down awkwardly at their plates. Arbuthnot, Haddo, and\r\nthe other man who was there laughed very heartily; but Arthur flushed to\r\nthe roots of his hair. He felt horribly uncomfortable. He was ashamed. He\r\ndared not look at Margaret. It was inconceivable that from her exquisite\r\nmouth such indecency should issue. Margaret, apparently quite unconscious\r\nof the effect she had produced, went on talking and laughing.\r\n\r\nSoon the lights were put out, and Arthur\'s agony was ended. He wanted to\r\nrush away, to hide his face, to forget the sight of her and her gaiety,\r\nabove all to forget that story. It was horrible, horrible.\r\n\r\nShe shook hands with him quite lightly.\r\n\r\n\'You must come and see us one day. We\'ve got rooms at the Carlton.\'\r\n\r\nHe bowed and did not answer. Susie had gone to the dressing-room to get\r\nher cloak. She stood at the door when Margaret came out.\r\n\r\n\'Can we drop you anywhere?\' said Margaret. \'You must come and see us when\r\nyou have nothing better to do.\'\r\n\r\nSusie threw back her head. Arthur was standing just in front of them\r\nlooking down at the ground in complete abstraction.\r\n\r\n\'Do you see him?\' she said, in a low voice quivering with indignation.\r\n\'That is what you have made him.\'\r\n\r\nHe looked up at that moment and turned upon them his sunken, tormented\r\neyes. They saw his wan, pallid face with its look of hopeless woe.\r\n\r\n\'Do you know that he\'s killing himself on your account? He can\'t sleep at\r\nnight. He\'s suffered the tortures of the damned. Oh, I hope you\'ll suffer\r\nas he\'s suffered!\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder that you blame me,\' said Margaret. \'You ought to be rather\r\ngrateful.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why?\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re not going to deny that you\'ve loved him passionately from the\r\nfirst day you saw him? Do you think I didn\'t see that you cared for him\r\nin Paris? You care for him now more than ever.\'\r\n\r\nSusie felt suddenly sick at heart. She had never dreamt that her secret\r\nwas discovered. Margaret gave a bitter little laugh and walked past her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Burdon spent two or three days in a state of utter uncertainty,\r\nbut at last the idea he had in mind grew so compelling as to overcome all\r\nobjections. He went to the Carlton and asked for Margaret. He had learnt\r\nfrom the porter that Haddo was gone out and so counted on finding her\r\nalone. A simple device enabled him to avoid sending up his name. When he\r\nwas shown into her private room Margaret was sitting down. She neither\r\nread nor worked.\r\n\r\n\'You told me I might call upon you,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nShe stood up without answering, and turned deathly pale.\r\n\r\n\'May I sit down?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head. For a moment they looked at one another in silence.\r\nArthur suddenly forgot all he had prepared to say. His intrusion seemed\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\n\'Why have you come?\' she said hoarsely.\r\n\r\nThey both felt that it was useless to attempt the conventionality of\r\nsociety. It was impossible to deal with the polite commonplaces that ease\r\nan awkward situation.\r\n\r\n\'I thought that I might be able to help you,\' he answered gravely.\r\n\r\n\'I want no help. I\'m perfectly happy. I have nothing to say to you.\'\r\n\r\nShe spoke hurriedly, with a certain nervousness, and her eyes were fixed\r\nanxiously on the door as though she feared that someone would come in.\r\n\r\n\'I feel that we have much to say to one another,\' he insisted. \'If it is\r\ninconvenient for us to talk here, will you not come and see me?\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'d know,\' she cried suddenly, as if the words were dragged out of her.\r\n\'D\'you think anything can be hidden from him?\'\r\n\r\nArthur glanced at her. He was horrified by the terror that was in her\r\neyes. In the full light of day a change was plain in her expression. Her\r\nface was strangely drawn, and pinched, and there was in it a constant\r\nlook as of a person cowed. Arthur turned away.\r\n\r\n\'I want you to know that I do not blame you in the least for anything you\r\ndid. No action of yours can ever lessen my affection for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, why did you come here? Why do you torture me by saying such things?\'\r\n\r\nShe burst on a sudden into a flood of tears, and walked excitedly up and\r\ndown the room.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, if you wanted me to be punished for the pain I\'ve caused you, you\r\ncan triumph now. Susie said she hoped I\'d suffer all the agony that I\'ve\r\nmade you suffer. If she only knew!\'\r\n\r\nMargaret gave a hysterical laugh. She flung herself on her knees by\r\nArthur\'s side and seized his hands.\r\n\r\n\'Did you think I didn\'t see? My heart bled when I looked at your poor wan\r\nface and your tortured eyes. Oh, you\'ve changed. I could never have\r\nbelieved that a man could change so much in so few months, and it\'s I\r\nwho\'ve caused it all. Oh, Arthur, Arthur, you must forgive me. And you\r\nmust pity me.\'\r\n\r\n\'But there\'s nothing to forgive, darling,\' he cried.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him steadily. Her eyes now were shining with a hard\r\nbrightness.\r\n\r\n\'You say that, but you don\'t really think it. And yet if you only knew,\r\nall that I have endured is on your account.\'\r\n\r\nShe made a great effort to be calm.\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean?\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'He never loved me, he would never have thought of me if he hadn\'t wanted\r\nto wound you in what you treasured most. He hated you, and he\'s made me\r\nwhat I am so that you might suffer. It isn\'t I who did all this, but a\r\ndevil within me; it isn\'t I who lied to you and left you and caused you\r\nall this unhappiness.\'\r\n\r\nShe rose to her feet and sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n\'Once, I thought he was dying, and I helped him. I took him into the\r\nstudio and gave him water. And he gained some dreadful power over me so\r\nthat I\'ve been like wax in his hands. All my will has disappeared, and I\r\nhave to do his bidding. And if I try to resist ...\'\r\n\r\nHer face twitched with pain and fear.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve found out everything since. I know that on that day when he seemed\r\nto be at the point of death, he was merely playing a trick on me, and he\r\ngot Susie out of the way by sending a telegram from a girl whose name he\r\nhad seen on a photograph. I\'ve heard him roar with laughter at his\r\ncleverness.\'\r\n\r\nShe stopped suddenly, and a look of frightful agony crossed her face.\r\n\r\n\'And at this very minute, for all I know, it may be by his influence that\r\nI say this to you, so that he may cause you still greater suffering by\r\nallowing me to tell you that he never cared for me. You know now that my\r\nlife is hell, and his vengeance is complete.\'\r\n\r\n\'Vengeance for what?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you remember that you hit him once, and kicked him unmercifully? I\r\nknow him well now. He could have killed you, but he hated you too much.\r\nIt pleased him a thousand times more to devise this torture for you and\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret\'s agitation was terrible to behold. This was the first time that\r\nshe had ever spoken to a soul of all these things, and now the long\r\nrestraint had burst as burst the waters of a dam. Arthur sought to calm\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re ill and overwrought. You must try to compose yourself. After all,\r\nHaddo is a human being like the rest of us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you always laughed at his claims. You wouldn\'t listen to the things\r\nhe said. But I know. Oh, I can\'t explain it; I daresay common sense and\r\nprobability are all against it, but I\'ve seen things with my own eyes\r\nthat pass all comprehension. I tell you, he has powers of the most awful\r\nkind. That first day when I was alone with him, he seemed to take me to\r\nsome kind of sabbath. I don\'t know what it was, but I saw horrors, vile\r\nhorrors, that rankled for ever after like poison in my mind; and when we\r\nwent up to his house in Staffordshire, I recognized the scene; I\r\nrecognized the arid rocks, and the trees, and the lie of the land. I knew\r\nI\'d been there before on that fatal afternoon. Oh, you must believe me!\r\nSometimes I think I shall go mad with the terror of it all.\'\r\n\r\nArthur did not speak. Her words caused a ghastly suspicion to flash\r\nthrough his mind, and he could hardly contain himself. He thought that\r\nsome dreadful shock had turned her brain. She buried her face in her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' he said, \'you must come away at once. You can\'t continue to\r\nlive with him. You must never go back to Skene.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t leave him. We\'re bound together inseparably.\'\r\n\r\n\'But it\'s monstrous. There can be nothing to keep you to him. Come back\r\nto Susie. She\'ll be very kind to you; she\'ll help you to forget all\r\nyou\'ve endured.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s no use. You can do nothing for me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because, notwithstanding, I love him with all my soul.\'\r\n\r\n\'Margaret!\'\r\n\r\n\'I hate him. He fills me with repulsion. And yet I do not know what there\r\nis in my blood that draws me to him against my will. My flesh cries out\r\nfor him.\'\r\n\r\nArthur looked away in embarrassment. He could not help a slight,\r\ninstinctive movement of withdrawal.\r\n\r\n\'Do I disgust you?\' she said.\r\n\r\nHe flushed slightly, but scarcely knew how to answer. He made a vague\r\ngesture of denial.\r\n\r\n\'If you only knew,\' she said.\r\n\r\nThere was something so extraordinary in her tone that he gave her a quick\r\nglance of surprise. He saw that her cheeks were flaming. Her bosom was\r\npanting as though she were again on the point of breaking into a passion\r\nof tears.\r\n\r\n\'For God\'s sake, don\'t look at me!\' she cried.\r\n\r\nShe turned away and hid her face. The words she uttered were in a shamed,\r\nunnatural voice.\r\n\r\n\'If you\'d been at Monte Carlo, you\'d have heard them say, God knows how\r\nthey knew it, that it was only through me he had his luck at the tables.\r\nHe\'s contented himself with filling my soul with vice. I have no purity\r\nin me. I\'m sullied through and through. He has made me into a sink of\r\niniquity, and I loathe myself. I cannot look at myself without a shudder\r\nof disgust.\'\r\n\r\nA cold sweat came over Arthur, and he grew more pale than ever. He\r\nrealized now he was in the presence of a mystery that he could not\r\nunravel. She went on feverishly.\r\n\r\n\'The other night, at supper, I told a story, and I saw you wince with\r\nshame. It wasn\'t I that told it. The impulse came from him, and I knew it\r\nwas vile, and yet I told it with gusto. I enjoyed the telling of it; I\r\nenjoyed the pain I gave you, and the dismay of those women. There seem to\r\nbe two persons in me, and my real self, the old one that you knew and\r\nloved, is growing weaker day by day, and soon she will be dead entirely.\r\nAnd there will remain only the wanton soul in the virgin body.\'\r\n\r\nArthur tried to gather his wits together. He felt it an occasion on which\r\nit was essential to hold on to the normal view of things.\r\n\r\n\'But for God\'s sake leave him. What you\'ve told me gives you every ground\r\nfor divorce. It\'s all monstrous. The man must be so mad that he ought to\r\nbe put in a lunatic asylum.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can do nothing for me,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'But if he doesn\'t love you, what does he want you for?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know, but I\'m beginning to suspect.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at Arthur steadily. She was now quite calm.\r\n\r\n\'I think he wishes to use me for a magical operation. I don\'t know if\r\nhe\'s mad or not. But I think he means to try some horrible experiment,\r\nand I am needful for its success. That is my safeguard.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your safeguard?\'\r\n\r\n\'He won\'t kill me because he needs me for that. Perhaps in the process I\r\nshall regain my freedom.\'\r\n\r\nArthur was shocked at the callousness with which she spoke. He went up to\r\nher and put his hands on her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\'Look here, you must pull yourself together, Margaret. This isn\'t sane.\r\nIf you don\'t take care, your mind will give way altogether. You must\r\ncome with me now. When you\'re out of his hands, you\'ll soon regain your\r\ncalmness of mind. You need never see him again. If you\'re afraid, you\r\nshall be hidden from him, and lawyers shall arrange everything between\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'I daren\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I promise you that you can come to no harm. Be reasonable. We\'re in\r\nLondon now, surrounded by people on every side. How do you think he can\r\ntouch you while we drive through the crowded streets? I\'ll take you\r\nstraight to Susie. In a week you\'ll laugh at the idle fears you had.\'\r\n\r\n\'How do you know that he is not in the room at this moment, listening to\r\nall you say?\'\r\n\r\nThe question was so sudden, so unexpected, that Arthur was startled. He\r\nlooked round quickly.\r\n\r\n\'You must be mad. You see that the room is empty.\'\r\n\r\n\'I tell you that you don\'t know what powers he has. Have you ever heard\r\nthose old legends with which nurses used to frighten our childhood, of\r\nmen who could turn themselves into wolves, and who scoured the country at\r\nnight?\' She looked at him with staring eyes. \'Sometimes, when he\'s come\r\nin at Skene in the morning, with bloodshot eyes, exhausted with fatigue\r\nand strangely discomposed, I\'ve imagined that he too ...\' She stopped and\r\nthrew back her head. \'You\'re right, Arthur, I think I shall go mad.\'\r\n\r\nHe watched her helplessly. He did not know what to do. Margaret went on,\r\nher voice quivering with anguish.\r\n\r\n\'When we were married, I reminded him that he\'d promised to take me\r\nto his mother. He would never speak of her, but I felt I must see her.\r\nAnd one day, suddenly, he told me to get ready for a journey, and we\r\nwent a long way, to a place I did not know, and we drove into the\r\ncountry. We seemed to go miles and miles, and we reached at last a\r\nlarge house, surrounded by a high wall, and the windows were heavily\r\nbarred. We were shown into a great empty room. It was dismal and cold\r\nlike the waiting-room at a station. A man came in to us, a tall man,\r\nin a frock-coat and gold spectacles. He was introduced to me as Dr\r\nTaylor, and then, suddenly, I understood.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret spoke in hurried gasps, and her eyes were staring wide, as\r\nthough she saw still the scene which at the time had seemed the crowning\r\nhorror of her experience.\r\n\r\n\'I knew it was an asylum, and Oliver hadn\'t told me a word. He took us up\r\na broad flight of stairs, through a large dormitory--oh, if you only knew\r\nwhat I saw there! I was so horribly frightened, I\'d never been in such a\r\nplace before--to a cell. And the walls and the floor were padded.\'\r\n\r\nMargaret passed her hand across her forehead to chase away the\r\nrecollection of that awful sight.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I see it still. I can never get it out of my mind.\'\r\n\r\nShe remembered with a morbid vividness the vast misshapen mass which\r\nshe had seen heaped strangely in one corner. There was a slight movement\r\nin it as they entered, and she perceived that it was a human being. It\r\nwas a woman, dressed in shapeless brown flannel; a woman of great stature\r\nand of a revolting, excessive corpulence. She turned upon them a huge,\r\nimpassive face; and its unwrinkled smoothness gave it an appearance of\r\naborted childishness. The hair was dishevelled, grey, and scanty. But\r\nwhat most terrified Margaret was that she saw in this creature an\r\nappalling likeness to Oliver.\r\n\r\n\'He told me it was his mother, and she\'d been there for five-and-twenty\r\nyears.\'\r\n\r\nArthur could hardly bear the terror that was in Margaret\'s eyes. He did\r\nnot know what to say to her. In a little while she began to speak again,\r\nin a low voice and rapidly, as though to herself, and she wrung her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you don\'t know what I\'ve endured! He used to spend long periods away\r\nfrom me, and I remained alone at Skene from morning till night, alone\r\nwith my abject fear. Sometimes, it seemed that he was seized with a\r\ndevouring lust for the gutter, and he would go to Liverpool or Manchester\r\nand throw himself among the very dregs of the people. He used to pass\r\nlong days, drinking in filthy pot-houses. While the bout lasted, nothing\r\nwas too depraved for him. He loved the company of all that was criminal\r\nand low. He used to smoke opium in foetid dens--oh, you have no\r\nconception of his passion to degrade himself--and at last he would come\r\nback, dirty, with torn clothes, begrimed, sodden still with his long\r\ndebauch; and his mouth was hot with the kisses of the vile women of the\r\ndocks. Oh, he\'s so cruel when the fit takes him that I think he has a\r\nfiendish pleasure in the sight of suffering!\'\r\n\r\nIt was more than Arthur could stand. His mind was made up to try a bold\r\ncourse. He saw on the table a whisky bottle and glasses. He poured some\r\nneat spirit into a tumbler and gave it to Margaret.\r\n\r\n\'Drink this,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'What is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind! Drink it at once.\'\r\n\r\nObediently she put it to her lips. He stood over her as she emptied the\r\nglass. A sudden glow filled her.\r\n\r\n\'Now come with me.\'\r\n\r\nHe took her arm and led her down the stairs. He passed through the hall\r\nquickly. There was a cab just drawn up at the door, and he told her to\r\nget in. One or two persons stared at seeing a woman come out of that\r\nhotel in a teagown and without a hat. He directed the driver to the house\r\nin which Susie lived and looked round at Margaret. She had fainted\r\nimmediately she got into the cab.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived, he carried Margaret upstairs and laid her on a sofa.\r\nHe told Susie what had happened and what he wanted of her. The dear woman\r\nforgot everything except that Margaret was very ill, and promised\r\nwillingly to do all he wished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a week Margaret could not be moved. Arthur hired a little cottage in\r\nHampshire, opposite the Isle of Wight, hoping that amid the most\r\ncharming, restful scenery in England she would quickly regain her\r\nstrength; and as soon as it was possible Susie took her down. But she was\r\nmuch altered. Her gaiety had disappeared and with it her determination.\r\nAlthough her illness had been neither long nor serious, she seemed as\r\nexhausted, physically and mentally, as if she had been for months at the\r\npoint of death. She took no interest in her surroundings, and was\r\nindifferent to the shady lanes through which they drove and to the\r\ngracious trees and the meadows. Her old passion for beauty was gone, and\r\nshe cared neither for the flowers which filled their little garden nor\r\nfor the birds that sang continually. But at last it seemed necessary to\r\ndiscuss the future. Margaret acquiesced in all that was suggested to her,\r\nand agreed willingly that the needful steps should be taken to procure\r\nher release from Oliver Haddo. He made apparently no effort to trace her,\r\nand nothing had been heard of him. He did not know where Margaret was,\r\nbut he might have guessed that Arthur was responsible for her flight, and\r\nArthur was easily to be found. It made Susie vaguely uneasy that there\r\nwas no sign of his existence. She wished that Arthur were not kept by his\r\nwork in London.\r\n\r\nAt last a suit for divorce was instituted.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this, when Arthur was in his consultingroom, Haddo\'s card\r\nwas brought to him. Arthur\'s jaw set more firmly.\r\n\r\n\'Show the gentleman in,\' he ordered.\r\n\r\nWhen Haddo entered, Arthur, standing with his back to the fireplace,\r\nmotioned him to sit down.\r\n\r\n\'What can I do for you?\' he asked coldly.\r\n\r\n\'I have not come to avail myself of your surgical skill, my dear Burdon,\'\r\nsmiled Haddo, as he fell ponderously into an armchair.\r\n\r\n\'So I imagined.\'\r\n\r\n\'You perspicacity amazes me. I surmise that it is to you I owe this\r\namusing citation which was served on me yesterday.\'\r\n\r\n\'I allowed you to come in so that I might tell you I will have no\r\ncommunication with you except through my solicitors.\'\r\n\r\n\'My dear fellow, why do you treat me with such discourtesy? It is true\r\nthat you have deprived me of the wife of my bosom, but you might at least\r\nso far respect my marital rights as to use me civilly.\'\r\n\r\n\'My patience is not as good as it was,\' answered Arthur, \'I venture to\r\nremind you that once before I lost my temper with you, and the result you\r\nmust have found unpleasant.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should have thought you regretted that incident by now, O Burdon,\'\r\nanswered Haddo, entirely unabashed.\r\n\r\n\'My time is very short,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'Then I will get to my business without delay. I thought it might\r\ninterest you to know that I propose to bring a counter-petition\r\nagainst my wife, and I shall make you co-respondent.\'\r\n\r\n\'You infamous blackguard!\' cried Arthur furiously. \'You know as well as I\r\ndo that your wife is above suspicion.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know that she left my hotel in your company, and has been living since\r\nunder your protection.\'\r\n\r\nArthur grew livid with rage. He could hardly restrain himself from\r\nknocking the man down. He gave a short laugh.\r\n\r\n\'You can do what you like. I\'m really not frightened.\'\r\n\r\n\'The innocent are so very incautious. I assure you that I can make a good\r\nenough story to ruin your career and force you to resign your\r\nappointments at the various hospitals you honour with your attention.\'\r\n\r\n\'You forget that the case will not be tried in open court,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nHaddo looked at him steadily. He did not answer for a moment.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re quite right,\' he said at last, with a little smile. \'I had\r\nforgotten that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I need not detain you longer.\'\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo got up. He passed his hand reflectively over his huge face.\r\nArthur watched him with scornful eyes. He touched a bell, and the servant\r\nat once appeared.\r\n\r\n\'Show this gentleman out.\'\r\n\r\nNot in the least disconcerted, Haddo strolled calmly to the door.\r\n\r\nArthur gave a sigh of relief, for he concluded that Haddo would not show\r\nfight. His solicitor indeed had already assured him that Oliver would not\r\nventure to defend the case.\r\n\r\nMargaret seemed gradually to take more interest in the proceedings, and\r\nshe was full of eagerness to be set free. She did not shrink from the\r\nunpleasant ordeal of a trial. She could talk of Haddo with composure. Her\r\nfriends were able to persuade themselves that in a little while she would\r\nbe her old self again, for she was growing stronger and more cheerful;\r\nher charming laughter rang through the little house as it had been used\r\nto do in the Paris studio. The case was to come on at the end of July,\r\nbefore the long vacation, and Susie had agreed to take Margaret abroad as\r\nsoon as it was done.\r\n\r\nBut presently a change came over her. As the day of the trial drew\r\nnearer, Margaret became excited and disturbed; her gaiety deserted her,\r\nand she fell into long, moody silences. To some extent this was\r\ncomprehensible, for she would have to disclose to callous ears the most\r\nintimate details of her married life; but at last her nervousness grew so\r\nmarked that Susie could no longer ascribe it to natural causes. She\r\nthought it necessary to write to Arthur about it.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Arthur:\r\n\r\nI don\'t know what to make of Margaret, and I wish you would come down and\r\nsee her. The good-humour which I have noticed in her of late has given\r\nway to a curious irritability. She is so restless that she cannot keep\r\nstill for a moment. Even when she is sitting down her body moves in a\r\nmanner that is almost convulsive. I am beginning to think that the strain\r\nfrom which she suffered is bringing on some nervous disease, and I am\r\nreally alarmed. She walks about the house in a peculiarly aimless manner,\r\nup and down the stairs, in and out of the garden. She has grown suddenly\r\nmuch more silent, and the look has come back to her eyes which they had\r\nwhen first we brought her down here. When I beg her to tell me what is\r\ntroubling her, she says: \'I\'m afraid that something is going to happen.\'\r\nShe will not or cannot explain what she means. The last few weeks have\r\nset my own nerves on edge, so that I do not know how much of what I\r\nobserve is real, and how much is due to my fancy; but I wish you would\r\ncome and put a little courage into me. The oddness of it all is making me\r\nuneasy, and I am seized with preposterous terrors. I don\'t know what\r\nthere is in Haddo that inspires me with this unaccountable dread. He is\r\nalways present to my thoughts. I seem to see his dreadful eyes and his\r\ncold, sensual smile. I wake up at night, my heart beating furiously, with\r\nthe consciousness that something quite awful has happened.\r\n\r\nOh, I wish the trial were over, and that we were happy in Germany.\r\n\r\nYours ever\r\nSUSAN BOYD\r\n\r\nSusie took a certain pride in her common sense, and it was humiliating to\r\nfind that her nerves could be so distraught. She was worried and unhappy.\r\nIt had not been easy to take Margaret back to her bosom as if nothing had\r\nhappened. Susie was human; and, though she did ten times more than could\r\nbe expected of her, she could not resist a feeling of irritation that\r\nArthur sacrificed her so calmly. He had no room for other thoughts, and\r\nit seemed quite natural to him that she should devote herself entirely to\r\nMargaret\'s welfare.\r\n\r\nSusie walked some way along the road to post this letter and then went to\r\nher room. It was a wonderful night, starry and calm, and the silence was\r\nlike balm to her troubles. She sat at the window for a long time, and at\r\nlast, feeling more tranquil, went to bed. She slept more soundly than she\r\nhad done for many days. When she awoke the sun was streaming into her\r\nroom, and she gave a deep sigh of delight. She could see trees from her\r\nbed, and blue sky. All her troubles seemed easy to bear when the world\r\nwas so beautiful, and she was ready to laugh at the fears that had so\r\naffected her.\r\n\r\nShe got up, put on a dressing-gown, and went to Margaret\'s room. It was\r\nempty. The bed had not been slept in. On the pillow was a note.\r\n\r\nIt\'s no good; I can\'t help myself. I\'ve gone back to him. Don\'t trouble\r\nabout me any more. It\'s quite hopeless and useless.\r\n\r\nM\r\n\r\nSusie gave a little gasp. Her first thought was for Arthur, and she\r\nuttered a wail of sorrow because he must be cast again into the agony of\r\ndesolation. Once more she had to break the dreadful news. She dressed\r\nhurriedly and ate some breakfast. There was no train till nearly eleven,\r\nand she had to bear her impatience as best she could. At last it was time\r\nto start, and she put on her gloves. At that moment the door was opened,\r\nand Arthur came in.\r\n\r\nShe gave a cry of terror and turned pale.\r\n\r\n\'I was just coming to London to see you,\' she faltered. \'How did you find\r\nout?\'\r\n\r\n\'Haddo sent me a box of chocolates early this morning with a card on\r\nwhich was written: _I think the odd trick is mine_.\'\r\n\r\nThis cruel vindictiveness, joined with a schoolboy love of taunting the\r\nvanquished foe, was very characteristic. Susie gave Arthur Burdon the\r\nnote which she had found in Margaret\'s room. He read it and then thought\r\nfor a long time.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid she\'s right,\' he said at length. \'It seems quite hopeless.\r\nThe man has some power over her which we can\'t counteract.\'\r\n\r\nSusie wondered whether his strong scepticism was failing at last.\r\nShe could not withstand her own feeling that there was something\r\npreternatural about the hold that Oliver had over Margaret. She had\r\nno shadow of a doubt that he was able to affect his wife even at a\r\ndistance, and was convinced now that the restlessness of the last few\r\ndays was due to this mysterious power. He had been at work in some\r\nstrange way, and Margaret had been aware of it. At length she could\r\nnot resist and had gone to him instinctively: her will was as little\r\nconcerned as when a chip of steel flies to a magnet.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot find it in my heart now to blame her for anything she has\r\ndone,\' said Susie. \'I think she is the victim of a most lamentable fate.\r\nI can\'t help it. I must believe that he was able to cast a spell on her;\r\nand to that is due all that has happened. I have only pity for her great\r\nmisfortunes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Has it occurred to you what will happen when she is back in Haddo\'s\r\nhands?\' cried Arthur. \'You know as well as I do how revengeful he is and\r\nhow hatefully cruel. My heart bleeds when I think of the tortures, sheer\r\nphysical tortures, which she may suffer.\'\r\n\r\nHe walked up and down in desperation.\r\n\r\n\'And yet there\'s nothing whatever that one can do. One can\'t go to the\r\npolice and say that a man has cast a magic spell on his wife.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you believe it too?\' said Susie.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what I believe now,\' he cried. \'After all, we can\'t do\r\nanything if she chooses to go back to her husband. She\'s apparently her\r\nown mistress.\' He wrung his hands. \'And I\'m imprisoned in London! I can\'t\r\nleave it for a day. I ought not to be here now, and I must get back in a\r\ncouple of hours. I can do nothing, and yet I\'m convinced that Margaret is\r\nutterly wretched.\'\r\n\r\nSusie paused for a minute or two. She wondered how he would accept the\r\nsuggestion that was in her mind.\r\n\r\n\'Do you know, it seems to me that common methods are useless. The only\r\nchance is to fight him with his own weapons. Would you mind if I went\r\nover to Paris to consult Dr Porhoet? You know that he is learned in every\r\nbranch of the occult, and perhaps he might help us.\'\r\n\r\nBut Arthur pulled himself together.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s absurd. We mustn\'t give way to superstition. Haddo is merely a\r\nscoundrel and a charlatan. He\'s worked on our nerves as he\'s worked on\r\npoor Margaret\'s. It\'s impossible to suppose that he has any powers\r\ngreater than the common run of mankind.\'\r\n\r\n\'Even after all you\'ve seen with your own eyes?\'\r\n\r\n\'If my eyes show me what all my training assures me is impossible, I can\r\nonly conclude that my eyes deceive me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I shall run over to Paris.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\r\nSome weeks later Dr Porhoet was sitting among his books in the quiet, low\r\nroom that overlooked the Seine. He had given himself over to a pleasing\r\nmelancholy. The heat beat down upon the noisy streets of Paris, and the\r\ndin of the great city penetrated even to his fastness in the Ile Saint\r\nLouis. He remembered the cloud-laden sky of the country where he was\r\nborn, and the south-west wind that blew with a salt freshness. The long\r\nstreets of Brest, present to his fancy always in a drizzle of rain, with\r\nthe lights of cafes reflected on the wet pavements, had a familiar charm.\r\nEven in foul weather the sailor-men who trudged along them gave one a\r\ncurious sense of comfort. There was delight in the smell of the sea and\r\nin the freedom of the great Atlantic. And then he thought of the green\r\nlanes and of the waste places with their scented heather, the fair broad\r\nroads that led from one old sweet town to another, of the _Pardons_ and\r\ntheir gentle, sad crowds. Dr Porhoet gave a sigh.\r\n\r\n\'It is good to be born in the land of Brittany,\' he smiled.\r\n\r\nBut his _bonne_ showed Susie in, and he rose with a smile to greet her.\r\nShe had been in Paris for some time, and they had seen much of one\r\nanother. He basked in the gentle sympathy with which she interested\r\nherself in all the abstruse, quaint matters on which he spent his time;\r\nand, divining her love for Arthur, he admired the courage with which she\r\neffaced herself. They had got into the habit of eating many of their\r\nmeals together in a quiet house opposite the Cluny called La Reine\r\nBlanche, and here they had talked of so many things that their\r\nacquaintance was grown into a charming friendship.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m ashamed to come here so often,\' said Susie, as she entered. \'Matilde\r\nis beginning to look at me with a suspicious eye.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is very good of you to entertain a tiresome old man,\' he smiled,\r\nas he held her hand. \'But I should have been disappointed if you had\r\nforgotten your promise to come this afternoon, for I have much to tell\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tell me at once,\' she said, sitting down.\r\n\r\n\'I have discovered an MS. at the library of the Arsenal this morning that\r\nno one knew anything about.\'\r\n\r\nHe said this with an air of triumph, as though the achievement were of\r\nnational importance. Susie had a tenderness for his innocent mania; and,\r\nthough she knew the work in question was occult and incomprehensible,\r\ncongratulated him heartily.\r\n\r\n\'It is the original version of a book by Paracelsus. I have not read it\r\nyet, for the writing is most difficult to decipher, but one point caught\r\nmy eye on turning over the pages. That is the gruesome fact that\r\nParacelsus fed the _homunculi_ he manufactured on human blood. One\r\nwonders how he came by it.\'\r\n\r\nSusie gave a little start, which Dr Porhoet noticed.\r\n\r\n\'What is the matter with you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing,\' she said quickly.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a moment, then proceeded with the subject that\r\nstrangely fascinated him.\r\n\r\n\'You must let me take you one day to the library of the Arsenal. There\r\nis no richer collection in the world of books dealing with the occult\r\nsciences. And of course you know that it was at the Arsenal that the\r\ntribunal sat, under the suggestive name of _chambre ardente_, to deal\r\nwith cases of sorcery and magic?\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t,\' smiled Susie.\r\n\r\n\'I always think that these manuscripts and queer old books, which are\r\nthe pride of our library, served in many an old trial. There are volumes\r\nthere of innocent appearance that have hanged wretched men and sent\r\nothers to the stake. You would not believe how many persons of fortune,\r\nrank, and intelligence, during the great reign of Louis XIV, immersed\r\nthemselves in these satanic undertakings.\'\r\n\r\nSusie did not answer. She could not now deal with these matters in an\r\nindifferent spirit. Everything she heard might have some bearing on the\r\ncircumstances which she had discussed with Dr Porhoet times out of\r\nnumber. She had never been able to pin him down to an affirmation of\r\nfaith. Certain strange things had manifestly happened, but what the\r\nexplanation of them was, no man could say. He offered analogies from\r\nhis well-stored memory. He gave her books to read till she was saturated\r\nwith occult science. At one moment, she was inclined to throw them all\r\naside impatiently, and, at another, was ready to believe that everything\r\nwas possible.\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet stood up and stretched out a meditative finger. He spoke in\r\nthat agreeably academic manner which, at the beginning of their\r\nacquaintance, had always entertained Susie, because it contrasted so\r\nabsurdly with his fantastic utterances.\r\n\r\n\'It was a strange dream that these wizards cherished. They sought to make\r\nthemselves beloved of those they cared for and to revenge themselves on\r\nthose they hated; but, above all, they sought to become greater than the\r\ncommon run of men and to wield the power of the gods. They hesitated at\r\nnothing to gain their ends. But Nature with difficulty allows her secrets\r\nto be wrested from her. In vain they lit their furnaces, and in vain they\r\nstudied their crabbed books, called up the dead, and conjured ghastly\r\nspirits. Their reward was disappointment and wretchedness, poverty, the\r\nscorn of men, torture, imprisonment, and shameful death. And yet, perhaps\r\nafter all, there may be some particle of truth hidden away in these dark\r\nplaces.\'\r\n\r\n\'You never go further than the cautious perhaps,\' said Susie. \'You never\r\ngive me any definite opinion.\'\r\n\r\n\'In these matters it is discreet to have no definite opinion,\' he smiled,\r\nwith a shrug of the shoulders. \'If a wise man studies the science of the\r\noccult, his duty is not to laugh at everything, but to seek patiently,\r\nslowly, perseveringly, the truth that may be concealed in the night of\r\nthese illusions.\'\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly spoken when Matilde, the ancient _bonne_, opened\r\nthe door to let a visitor come in. It was Arthur Burdon. Susie gave a cry\r\nof surprise, for she had received a brief note from him two days before,\r\nand he had said nothing of crossing the Channel.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m glad to find you both here,\' said Arthur, as he shook hands with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\'Has anything happened?\' cried Susie.\r\n\r\nHis manner was curiously distressing, and there was a nervousness about\r\nhis movements that was very unexpected in so restrained a person.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve seen Margaret again,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Well?\'\r\n\r\nHe seemed unable to go on, and yet both knew that he had something\r\nimportant to tell them. He looked at them vacantly, as though all he had\r\nto say was suddenly gone out of his mind.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve come straight here,\' he said, in a dull, bewildered fashion. \'I\r\nwent to your hotel, Susie, in the hope of finding you; but when they told\r\nme you were out, I felt certain you would be here.\'\r\n\r\n\'You seem worn out, _cher ami_,\' said Dr Porhoet, looking at him. \'Will\r\nyou let Matilde make you a cup of coffee?\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like something,\' he answered, with a look of utter weariness.\r\n\r\n\'Sit still for a minute or two, and you shall tell us what you want to\r\nwhen you are a little rested.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet had not seen Arthur since that afternoon in the previous year\r\nwhen, in answer to Haddo\'s telegram, he had gone to the studio in the Rue\r\nCampagne Premiere. He watched him anxiously while Arthur drank his\r\ncoffee. The change in him was extraordinary; there was a cadaverous\r\nexhaustion about his face, and his eyes were sunken in their sockets. But\r\nwhat alarmed the good doctor most was that Arthur\'s personality seemed\r\nthoroughly thrown out of gear. All that he had endured during these nine\r\nmonths had robbed him of the strength of purpose, the matter-of-fact\r\nsureness, which had distinguished him. He was now unbalanced and\r\nneurotic.\r\n\r\nArthur did not speak. With his eyes fixed moodily on the ground, he\r\nwondered how much he could bring himself to tell them. It revolted him\r\nto disclose his inmost thoughts, yet he was come to the end of his tether\r\nand needed the doctor\'s advice. He found himself obliged to deal with\r\ncircumstances that might have existed in a world of nightmare, and he\r\nwas driven at last to take advantage of his friend\'s peculiar knowledge.\r\n\r\nReturning to London after Margaret\'s flight, Arthur Burdon had thrown\r\nhimself again into the work which for so long had been his only solace.\r\nIt had lost its savour; but he would not take this into account, and he\r\nslaved away mechanically, by perpetual toil seeking to deaden his\r\nanguish. But as the time passed he was seized on a sudden with a curious\r\nfeeling of foreboding, which he could in no way resist; it grew in\r\nstrength till it had all the power of an obsession, and he could not\r\nreason himself out of it. He was sure that a great danger threatened\r\nMargaret. He could not tell what it was, nor why the fear of it was so\r\npersistent, but the idea was there always, night and day; it haunted him\r\nlike a shadow and pursued him like remorse. His anxiety increased\r\ncontinually, and the vagueness of his terror made it more tormenting. He\r\nfelt quite certain that Margaret was in imminent peril, but he did not\r\nknow how to help her. Arthur supposed that Haddo had taken her back to\r\nSkene; but, even if he went there, he had no chance of seeing her. What\r\nmade it more difficult still, was that his chief at St Luke\'s was away,\r\nand he was obliged to be in London in case he should be suddenly called\r\nupon to do some operation. But he could think of nothing else. He felt\r\nit urgently needful to see Margaret. Night after night he dreamed that\r\nshe was at the point of death, and heavy fetters prevented him from\r\nstretching out a hand to help her. At last he could stand it no more. He\r\ntold a brother surgeon that private business forced him to leave London,\r\nand put the work into his hands. With no plan in his head, merely urged\r\nby an obscure impulse, he set out for the village of Venning, which was\r\nabout three miles from Skene.\r\n\r\nIt was a tiny place, with one public-house serving as a hotel to the rare\r\ntravellers who found it needful to stop there, and Arthur felt that some\r\nexplanation of his presence was necessary. Having seen at the station an\r\nadvertisement of a large farm to let, he told the inquisitive landlady\r\nthat he had come to see it. He arrived late at night. Nothing could be\r\ndone then, so he occupied the time by trying to find out something about\r\nthe Haddos.\r\n\r\nOliver was the local magnate, and his wealth would have made him an easy\r\ntopic of conversation even without his eccentricity. The landlady roundly\r\ncalled him insane, and as an instance of his queerness told Arthur, to\r\nhis great dismay, that Haddo would have no servants to sleep in the\r\nhouse: after dinner everyone was sent away to the various cottages in\r\nthe park, and he remained alone with his wife. It was an awful thought\r\nthat Margaret might be in the hands of a raving madman, with not a soul\r\nto protect her. But if he learnt no more than this of solid fact, Arthur\r\nheard much that was significant. To his amazement the old fear of the\r\nwizard had grown up again in that lonely place, and the garrulous woman\r\ngravely told him of Haddo\'s evil influence on the crops and cattle of\r\nfarmers who had aroused his anger. He had had an altercation with his\r\nbailiff, and the man had died within a year. A small freeholder in the\r\nneighbourhood had refused to sell the land which would have rounded off\r\nthe estate of Skene, and a disease had attacked every animal on his farm\r\nso that he was ruined. Arthur was impressed because, though she reported\r\nthese rumours with mock scepticism as the stories of ignorant yokels and\r\nold women, the innkeeper had evidently a terrified belief in their truth.\r\nNo one could deny that Haddo had got possession of the land he wanted;\r\nfor, when it was put up to auction, no one would bid against him, and he\r\nbought it for a song.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could do so naturally, Arthur asked after Margaret. The\r\nwoman shrugged her shoulders. No one knew anything about her. She never\r\ncame out of the park gates, but sometimes you could see her wandering\r\nabout inside by herself. She saw no one. Haddo had long since quarrelled\r\nwith the surrounding gentry; and though one old lady, the mother of a\r\nneighbouring landowner, had called when Margaret first came, she had not\r\nbeen admitted, and the visit was never returned.\r\n\r\n\'She\'ll come to no good, poor lady,\' said the hostess of the inn. \'And\r\nthey do say she\'s a perfect picture to look at.\'\r\n\r\nArthur went to his room. He longed for the day to come. There was no\r\ncertain means of seeing Margaret. It was useless to go to the park gates,\r\nsince even the tradesmen were obliged to leave their goods at the lodge;\r\nbut it appeared that she walked alone, morning and afternoon, and it\r\nmight be possible to see her then. He decided to climb into the park and\r\nwait till he came upon her in some spot where they were not likely to\r\nbe observed.\r\n\r\nNext day the great heat of the last week was gone, and the melancholy sky\r\nwas dark with lowering clouds. Arthur inquired for the road which led to\r\nSkene, and set out to walk the three miles which separated him from it.\r\nThe country was grey and barren. There was a broad waste of heath, with\r\ngigantic boulders strewn as though in pre-historic times Titans had waged\r\nthere a mighty battle. Here and there were trees, but they seemed hardly\r\nto withstand the fierce winds of winter; they were old and bowed before\r\nthe storm. One of them attracted his attention. It had been struck by\r\nlightning and was riven asunder, leafless; but the maimed branches were\r\ncuriously set on the trunk so that they gave it the appearance of a human\r\nbeing writhing in the torture of infernal agony. The wind whistled\r\nstrangely. Arthur\'s heart sank as he walked on. He had never seen a\r\ncountry so desolate.\r\n\r\nHe came to the park gates at last and stood for some time in front of\r\nthem. At the end of a long avenue, among the trees, he could see part of\r\na splendid house. He walked along the wooden palisade that surrounded the\r\npark. Suddenly he came to a spot where a board had been broken down. He\r\nlooked up and down the road. No one was in sight. He climbed up the low,\r\nsteep bank, wrenched down a piece more of the fence, and slipped in.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in a dense wood. There was no sign of a path, and he\r\nadvanced cautiously. The bracken was so thick and high that it easily\r\nconcealed him. Dead owners had plainly spent much care upon the place,\r\nfor here alone in the neighbourhood were trees in abundance; but of late\r\nit had been utterly neglected. It had run so wild that there were no\r\ntraces now of its early formal arrangement; and it was so hard to make\r\none\'s way, the vegetation was so thick, that it might almost have been\r\nsome remnant of primeval forest. But at last he came to a grassy path and\r\nwalked along it slowly. He stopped on a sudden, for he heard a sound. But\r\nit was only a pheasant that flew heavily through the low trees. He\r\nwondered what he should do if he came face to face with Oliver. The\r\ninnkeeper had assured him that the squire seldom came out, but spent his\r\ndays locked in the great attics at the top of the house. Smoke came from\r\nthe chimneys of them, even in the hottest days of summer, and weird tales\r\nwere told of the devilries there committed.\r\n\r\nArthur went on, hoping in the end to catch sight of Margaret, but he\r\nsaw no one. In that grey, chilly day the woods, notwithstanding their\r\ngreenery, were desolate and sad. A sombre mystery seemed to hang over\r\nthem. At last he came to a stone bench at a cross-way among the trees,\r\nand, since it was the only resting-place he had seen, it struck him that\r\nMargaret might come there to sit down. He hid himself in the bracken.\r\nHe had forgotten his watch and did not know how the time passed; he\r\nseemed to be there for hours.\r\n\r\nBut at length his heart gave a great beat against his ribs, for all at\r\nonce, so silently that he had not heard her approach, Margaret came into\r\nview. She sat on the stone bench. For a moment he dared not move in case\r\nthe sound frightened her. He could not tell how to make his presence\r\nknown. But it was necessary to do something to attract her attention,\r\nand he could only hope that she would not cry out.\r\n\r\n\'Margaret,\' he called softly.\r\n\r\nShe did not move, and he repeated her name more loudly. But still she\r\nmade no sign that she had heard. He came forward and stood in front of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\'Margaret.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him quietly. He might have been someone she had never set\r\neyes on, and yet from her composure she might have expected him to be\r\nstanding there.\r\n\r\n\'Margaret, don\'t you know me?\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you want?\' she answered placidly.\r\n\r\nHe was so taken aback that he did not know what to say. She kept gazing\r\nat him steadfastly. On a sudden her calmness vanished, and she sprang to\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\n\'Is it you really?\' she cried, terribly agitated. \'I thought it was only\r\na shape that mimicked you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Margaret, what do you mean? What has come over you?\'\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hand and touched him.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m flesh and blood all right,\' he said, trying to smile.\r\n\r\nShe shut her eyes for a moment, as though in an effort to collect\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve had hallucinations lately,\' she muttered. \'I thought it was some\r\ntrick played upon me.\'\r\n\r\nSuddenly she shook herself.\r\n\r\n\'But what are you doing here? You must go. How did you come? Oh, why\r\nwon\'t you leave me alone?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been haunted by a feeling that something horrible was going to\r\nhappen to you. I was obliged to come.\'\r\n\r\n\'For God\'s sake, go. You can do me no good. If he finds out you\'ve been\r\nhere--\'\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and her eyes were dilated with terror. Arthur seized her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\'Margaret, I can\'t go--I can\'t leave you like this. For Heaven\'s sake,\r\ntell me what is the matter. I\'m so dreadfully frightened.\'\r\n\r\nHe was aghast at the difference wrought in her during the two months\r\nsince he had seen her last. Her colour was gone, and her face had the\r\ngreyness of the dead. There were strange lines on her forehead, and her\r\neyes had an unnatural glitter. Her youth had suddenly left her. She\r\nlooked as if she were struck down by mortal illness.\r\n\r\n\'What is that matter with you?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Nothing.\' She looked about her anxiously. \'Oh, why don\'t you go? How can\r\nyou be so cruel?\'\r\n\r\n\'I must do something for you,\' he insisted.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s too late. Nothing can help me now.\' She paused; and when she spoke\r\nagain it was with a voice so ghastly that it might have come from the\r\nlips of a corpse. \'I\'ve found out at last what he\'s going to do with me\r\nHe wants me for his great experiment, and the time is growing shorter.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean by saying he wants you?\'\r\n\r\n\'He wants--my life.\'\r\n\r\nArthur gave a cry of dismay, but she put up her hand.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s no use resisting. It can\'t do any good--I think I shall be glad\r\nwhen the moment comes. I shall at least cease to suffer.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you must be mad.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know. I know that he is.\'\r\n\r\n\'But if your life is in danger, come away for God\'s sake. After all,\r\nyou\'re free. He can\'t stop you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should have to go back to him, as I did last time,\' she answered,\r\nshaking her head. \'I thought I was free then, but gradually I knew that\r\nhe was calling me. I tried to resist, but I couldn\'t. I simply had to go\r\nto him.\'\r\n\r\n\'But it\'s awful to think that you are alone with a man who\'s practically\r\nraving mad.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m safe for today,\' she said quietly. \'It can only be done in the very\r\nhot weather. If there\'s no more this year, I shall live till next\r\nsummer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Margaret, for God\'s sake don\'t talk like that. I love you--I want to\r\nhave you with me always. Won\'t you come away with me and let me take care\r\nof you? I promise you that no harm shall come to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t love me any more; you\'re only sorry for me now.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not true.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes it is. I saw it when we were in the country. Oh, I don\'t blame\r\nyou. I\'m a different woman from the one you loved. I\'m not the Margaret\r\nyou knew.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can never care for anyone but you.\'\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\'If you loved me, I implore you to go. You don\'t know what you expose me\r\nto. And when I\'m dead you must marry Susie. She loves you with all her\r\nheart, and she deserves your love.\'\r\n\r\n\'Margaret, don\'t go. Come with me.\'\r\n\r\n\'And take care. He will never forgive you for what you did. If he can, he\r\nwill kill you.\'\r\n\r\nShe started violently, as though she heard a sound. Her face was\r\nconvulsed with sudden fear.\r\n\r\n\'For God\'s sake go, go!\'\r\n\r\nShe turned from him quickly, and, before he could prevent her, had\r\nvanished. With heavy heart he plunged again into the bracken.\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur had given his friends some account of this meeting, he\r\nstopped and looked at Dr Porhoet. The doctor went thoughtfully to his\r\nbookcase.\r\n\r\n\'What is it you want me to tell you?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'I think the man is mad,\' said Arthur. \'I found out at what asylum his\r\nmother was, and by good luck was able to see the superintendent on my way\r\nthrough London. He told me that he had grave doubts about Haddo\'s sanity,\r\nbut it was impossible at present to take any steps. I came straight here\r\nbecause I wanted your advice. Granting that the man is out of his mind,\r\nis it possible that he may be trying some experiment that entails a\r\nsacrifice of human life?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothing is more probable,\' said Dr Porhoet gravely.\r\n\r\nSusie shuddered. She remembered the rumour that had reached her ears in\r\nMonte Carlo.\r\n\r\n\'They said there that he was attempting to make living creatures by a\r\nmagical operation.\' She glanced at the doctor, but spoke to Arthur. \'Just\r\nbefore you came in, our friend was talking of that book of Paracelsus in\r\nwhich he speaks of feeding the monsters he has made on human blood.\'\r\n\r\nArthur gave a horrified cry.\r\n\r\n\'The most significant thing to my mind is that fact about Margaret which\r\nwe are certain of,\' said Dr Porhoet. \'All works that deal with the Black\r\nArts are unanimous upon the supreme efficacy of the virginal condition.\'\r\n\r\n\'But what is to be done?\' asked Arthur is desperation. \'We can\'t leave\r\nher in the hands of a raving madman.\' He turned on a sudden deathly\r\nwhite. \'For all we know she may be dead now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you ever heard of Gilles de Rais?\' said Dr Porhoet, continuing his\r\nreflections. \'That is the classic instance of human sacrifice. I know the\r\ncountry in which he lived; and the peasants to this day dare not pass at\r\nnight in the neighbourhood of the ruined castle which was the scene of\r\nhis horrible crimes.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s awful to know that this dreadful danger hangs over her, and to be\r\nable to do nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'We can only wait,\' said Dr Porhoet.\r\n\r\n\'And if we wait too long, we may be faced by a terrible catastrophe.\'\r\n\r\n\'Fortunately we live in a civilized age. Haddo has a great care of his\r\nneck. I hope we are frightened unduly.\'\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Susie that the chief thing was to distract Arthur, and she\r\nturned over in her mind some means of directing his attention to other\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\'I was thinking of going down to Chartres for two days with Mrs\r\nBloomfield,\' she said. \'Won\'t you come with me? It is the most lovely\r\ncathedral in the world, and I think you will find it restful to wander\r\nabout it for a little while. You can do no good, here or in London.\r\nPerhaps when you are calm, you will be able to think of something\r\npractical.\'\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet saw what her plan was, and joined his entreaties to hers that\r\nArthur should spend a day or two in a place that had no associations for\r\nhim. Arthur was too exhausted to argue, and from sheer weariness\r\nconsented. Next day Susie took him to Chartres. Mrs Bloomfield was no\r\ntrouble to them, and Susie induced him to linger for a week in that\r\npleasant, quiet town. They passed many hours in the stately cathedral,\r\nand they wandered about the surrounding country. Arthur was obliged to\r\nconfess that the change had done him good, and a certain apathy succeeded\r\nthe agitation from which he had suffered so long. Finally Susie persuaded\r\nhim to spend three or four weeks in Brittany with Dr Porhoet, who was\r\nproposing to revisit the scenes of his childhood. They returned to Paris.\r\nWhen Arthur left her at the station, promising to meet her again in an\r\nhour at the restaurant where they were going to dine with Dr Porhoet, he\r\nthanked her for all she had done.\r\n\r\n\'I was in an absurdly hysterical condition,\' he said, holding her hand.\r\n\'You\'ve been quite angelic. I knew that nothing could be done, and yet I\r\nwas tormented with the desire to do something. Now I\'ve got myself in\r\nhand once more. I think my common sense was deserting me, and I was on\r\nthe point of believing in the farrago of nonsense which they call magic.\r\nAfter all, it\'s absurd to think that Haddo is going to do any harm to\r\nMargaret. As soon at I get back to London, I\'ll see my lawyers, and I\r\ndaresay something can be done. If he\'s really mad, we\'ll have to put him\r\nunder restraint, and Margaret will be free. I shall never forget your\r\nkindness.\'\r\n\r\nSusie smiled and shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\nShe was convinced that he would forget everything if Margaret came back\r\nto him. But she chid herself for the bitterness of the thought. She loved\r\nhim, and she was glad to be able to do anything for him.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the hotel, changed her frock, and walked slowly to the\r\nChien Noir. It always exhilarated her to come back to Paris; and she\r\nlooked with happy, affectionate eyes at the plane trees, the yellow trams\r\nthat rumbled along incessantly, and the lounging people. When she\r\narrived, Dr Porhoet was waiting, and his delight at seeing her again was\r\nflattering and pleasant. They talked of Arthur. They wondered why he was\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he came in. They saw at once that something quite\r\nextraordinary had taken place.\r\n\r\n\'Thank God, I\'ve found you at last!\' he cried.\r\n\r\nHis face was moving strangely. They had never seen him so discomposed.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been round to your hotel, but I just missed you. Oh, why did you\r\ninsist on my going away?\'\r\n\r\n\'What on earth\'s the matter?\' cried Susie.\r\n\r\n\'Something awful has happened to Margaret.\'\r\n\r\nSusie started to her feet with a sudden cry of dismay.\r\n\r\n\'How do you know?\' she asked quickly.\r\n\r\nHe looked at them for a moment and flushed. He kept his eyes upon them,\r\nas though actually to force his listeners into believing what he was\r\nabout to say.\r\n\r\n\'I feel it,\' he answered hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'It came upon me quite suddenly, I can\'t explain why or how. I only know\r\nthat something has happened.\'\r\n\r\nHe began again to walk up and down, prey to an agitation that was\r\nfrightful to behold. Susie and Dr Porhoet stared at him helplessly. They\r\ntried to think of something to say that would calm him.\r\n\r\n\'Surely if anything had occurred, we should have been informed.\'\r\n\r\nHe turned to Susie angrily.\r\n\r\n\'How do you suppose we could know anything? She was quite helpless. She\r\nwas imprisoned like a rat in a trap.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, my dear friend, you mustn\'t give way in this fashion,\' said the\r\ndoctor. \'What would you say of a patient who came to you with such a\r\nstory?\'\r\n\r\nArthur answered the question with a shrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\'I should say he was absurdly hysterical.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t help it, the feeling\'s there. If you try all night you\'ll never\r\nbe able to argue me out of it. I feel it in every bone of my body. I\r\ncouldn\'t be more certain if I saw Margaret lying dead in front of me.\'\r\n\r\nSusie saw that it was indeed useless to reason with him. The only course\r\nwas to accept his conviction and make the best of it.\r\n\r\n\'What do you want us to do?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'I want you both to come to England with me at once. If we start now we\r\ncan catch the evening train.\'\r\n\r\nSusie did not answer, but she got up. She touched the doctor on the arm.\r\n\r\n\'Please come,\' she whispered.\r\n\r\nHe nodded and untucked the napkin he had already arranged over his\r\nwaistcoat.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve got a cab at the door,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'And what about clothes for Miss Susie?\' said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, we can\'t wait for that,\' cried Arthur. \'For God\'s sake, come\r\nquickly.\'\r\n\r\nSusie knew that there was plenty of time to fetch a few necessary things\r\nbefore the train started, but Arthur\'s impatience was too great to be\r\nwithstood.\r\n\r\n\'It doesn\'t matter,\' she said. \'I can get all I want in England.\'\r\n\r\nHe hurried them to the door and told the cabman to drive to the station\r\nas quickly as ever he could.\r\n\r\n\'For Heaven\'s sake, calm down a little,\' said Susie. \'You\'ll be no good\r\nto anyone in that state.\'\r\n\r\n\'I feel certain we\'re too late.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense! I\'m convinced that you\'ll find Margaret safe and sound.\'\r\n\r\nHe did not answer. He gave a sigh of relief as they drove into the\r\ncourtyard of the station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n\r\nSusie never forgot the horror of that journey to England. They arrived in\r\nLondon early in the morning and, without stopping, drove to Euston. For\r\nthree or four days there had been unusual heat, and even at that hour the\r\nstreets were sultry and airless. The train north was crowded, and it\r\nseemed impossible to get a breath of air. Her head ached, but she was\r\nobliged to keep a cheerful demeanour in the effort to allay Arthur\'s\r\nincreasing anxiety. Dr Porhoet sat in front of her. After the sleepless\r\nnight his eyes were heavy and his face deeply lined. He was exhausted.\r\nAt length, after much tiresome changing, they reached Venning. She had\r\nexpected a greater coolness in that northern country; but there was a hot\r\nblight over the place, and, as they walked to the inn from the little\r\nstation, they could hardly drag their limbs along.\r\n\r\nArthur had telegraphed from London that they must have rooms ready, and\r\nthe landlady expected them. She recognized Arthur. He passionately\r\ndesired to ask her whether anything had happened since he went away,\r\nbut forced himself to be silent for a while. He greeted her with\r\ncheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Mrs Smithers, what has been going on since I left you?\' he cried.\r\n\r\n\'Of course you wouldn\'t have heard, sir,\' she answered gravely.\r\n\r\nHe began to tremble, but with an almost superhuman effort controlled his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\'Has the squire hanged himself?\' he asked lightly.\r\n\r\n\'No sir--but the poor lady\'s dead.\'\r\n\r\nHe did not answer. He seemed turned to stone. He stared with ghastly\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\'Poor thing!\' said Susie, forcing herself to speak. \'Was it--very\r\nsudden?\'\r\n\r\nThe woman turned to Susie, glad to have someone with whom to discuss the\r\nevent. She took no notice of Arthur\'s agony.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, mum; no one expected it. She died quite sudden like. She was only\r\nburied this morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'What did she die of?\' asked Susie, her eyes on Arthur.\r\n\r\nShe feared that he would faint. She wanted enormously to get him away,\r\nbut did not know how to manage it.\r\n\r\n\'They say it was heart disease,\' answered the landlady. \'Poor thing! It\'s\r\na happy release for her.\'\r\n\r\n\'Won\'t you get us some tea, Mrs Smithers? We\'re very tired, and we should\r\nlike something immediately.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, miss. I\'ll get it at once.\'\r\n\r\nThe good woman bustled away. Susie quickly locked the door. She seized\r\nArthur\'s arm.\r\n\r\n\'Arthur, Arthur.\'\r\n\r\nShe expected him to break down. She looked with agony at Dr Porhoet, who\r\nstood helplessly by.\r\n\r\n\'You couldn\'t have done anything if you\'d been here. You heard what the\r\nwoman said. If Margaret died of heart disease, your suspicions were quite\r\nwithout ground.\'\r\n\r\nHe shook her away, almost violently.\r\n\r\n\'For God\'s sake, speak to us,\' cried Susie.\r\n\r\nHis silence terrified her more than would have done any outburst of\r\ngrief. Dr Porhoet went up to him gently.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t try to be brave, my friend. You will not suffer as much if you\r\nallow yourself a little weakness.\'\r\n\r\n\'For Heaven\'s sake leave me alone!\' said Arthur, hoarsely.\r\n\r\nThey drew back and watched him silently. Susie heard their hostess come\r\nalong to the sitting-room with tea, and she unlocked the door. The\r\nlandlady brought in the things. She was on the point of leaving them when\r\nArthur stopped her.\r\n\r\n\'How do you know that Mrs Haddo died of heart disease?\' he asked\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\nHis voice was hard and stern. He spoke with a peculiar abruptness that\r\nmade the poor woman look at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n\'Dr Richardson told me so.\'\r\n\r\n\'Had he been attending her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir. Mr Haddo had called him in several times to see his lady.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where does Dr Richardson live?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, sir, he lives at the white house near the station.\'\r\n\r\nShe could not make out why Arthur asked these questions.\r\n\r\n\'Did Mr Haddo go to the funeral?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, sir. I\'ve never seen anyone so upset.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'ll do. You can go.\'\r\n\r\nSusie poured out the tea and handed a cup to Arthur. To her surprise, he\r\ndrank the tea and ate some bread and butter. She could not understand\r\nhim. The expression of strain, and the restlessness which had been so\r\npainful, were both gone from his face, and it was set now to a look of\r\ngrim determination. At last he spoke to them.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m going to see this doctor. Margaret\'s heart was as sound as mine.\'\r\n\r\n\'What are you going to do?\'\r\n\r\n\'Do?\'\r\n\r\nHe turned on her with a peculiar fierceness.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m going to put a rope round that man\'s neck, and if the law won\'t help\r\nme, by God, I\'ll kill him myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'_Mais, mon ami, vous etes fou_,\' cried Dr Porhoet, springing up.\r\n\r\nArthur put out his hand angrily, as though to keep him back. The frown on\r\nhis face grew darker.\r\n\r\n\'You _must_ leave me alone. Good Heavens, the time has gone by for tears\r\nand lamentation. After all I\'ve gone through for months, I can\'t weep\r\nbecause Margaret is dead. My heart is dried up. But I know that she\r\ndidn\'t die naturally, and I\'ll never rest so long as that fellow lives.\'\r\n\r\nHe stretched out his hands and with clenched jaws prayed that one day he\r\nmight hold the man\'s neck between them, and see his face turn livid and\r\npurple as he died.\r\n\r\n\'I am going to this fool of a doctor, and then I shall go to Skene.\'\r\n\r\n\'You must let us come with you,\' said Susie.\r\n\r\n\'You need not be frightened,\' he answered. \'I shall not take any steps of\r\nmy own till I find the law is powerless.\'\r\n\r\n\'I want to come with you all the same.\'\r\n\r\n\'As you like.\'\r\n\r\nSusie went out and ordered a trap to be got ready. But since Arthur would\r\nnot wait, she arranged that it should be sent for them to the doctor\'s\r\ndoor. They went there at once, on foot.\r\n\r\nDr Richardson was a little man of five-and-fifty, with a fair beard that\r\nwas now nearly white, and prominent blue eyes. He spoke with a broad\r\nStaffordshire accent. There was in him something of the farmer, something\r\nof the well-to-do tradesman, and at the first glance his intelligence did\r\nnot impress one.\r\n\r\nArthur was shewn with his two friends into the consulting-room, and after\r\na short interval the doctor came in. He was dressed in flannels and had\r\nan old-fashioned racket in his hand.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sorry to have kept you waiting, but Mrs Richardson has got a few\r\nlady-friends to tea, and I was just in the middle of a set.\'\r\n\r\nHis effusiveness jarred upon Arthur, whose manner by contrast became more\r\nthan usually abrupt.\r\n\r\n\'I have just learnt of the death of Mrs Haddo. I was her guardian and her\r\noldest friend. I came to you in the hope that you would be able to tell\r\nme something about it.\'\r\n\r\nDr Richardson gave him at once, the suspicious glance of a stupid man.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know why you come to me instead of to her husband. He will be\r\nable to tell you all that you wish to know.\'\r\n\r\n\'I came to you as a fellow-practitioner,\' answered Arthur. \'I am at St\r\nLuke\'s Hospital.\' He pointed to his card, which Dr Richardson still held.\r\n\'And my friend is Dr Porhoet, whose name will be familiar to you with\r\nrespect to his studies in Malta Fever.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think I read an article of yours in the _B.M.J._\' said the country\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nHis manner assumed a singular hostility. He had no sympathy with London\r\nspecialists, whose attitude towards the general practitioner he resented.\r\nHe was pleased to sneer at their pretensions to omniscience, and quite\r\nwilling to pit himself against them.\r\n\r\n\'What can I do for you, Mr Burdon?\'\r\n\r\n\'I should be very much obliged if you would tell me as exactly as\r\npossible how Mrs Haddo died.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was a very simple case of endocarditis.\'\r\n\r\n\'May I ask how long before death you were called in?\'\r\n\r\nThe doctor hesitated. He reddened a little.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m not inclined to be cross-examined,\' he burst out, suddenly making up\r\nhis mind to be angry. \'As a surgeon I daresay your knowledge of cardiac\r\ndiseases is neither extensive nor peculiar. But this was a very simple\r\ncase, and everything was done that was possible. I don\'t think there\'s\r\nanything I can tell you.\'\r\n\r\nArthur took no notice of the outburst.\r\n\r\n\'How many times did you see her?\'\r\n\r\n\'Really, sir, I don\'t understand your attitude. I can\'t see that you have\r\nany right to question me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you have a post-mortem?\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly not. In the first place there was no need, as the cause of\r\ndeath was perfectly clear, and secondly you must know as well as I do\r\nthat the relatives are very averse to anything of the sort. You gentlemen\r\nin Harley Street don\'t understand the conditions of private practice. We\r\nhaven\'t the time to do post-mortems to gratify a needless curiosity.\'\r\n\r\nArthur was silent for a moment. The little man was evidently convinced\r\nthat there was nothing odd about Margaret\'s death, but his foolishness\r\nwas as great as his obstinacy. It was clear that several motives would\r\ninduce him to put every obstacle in Arthur\'s way, and chief of these\r\nwas the harm it would do him if it were discovered that he had given a\r\ncertificate of death carelessly. He would naturally do anything to avoid\r\nsocial scandal. Still Arthur was obliged to speak.\r\n\r\n\'I think I\'d better tell you frankly that I\'m not satisfied, Dr\r\nRichardson. I can\'t persuade myself that this lady\'s death was due\r\nto natural causes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stuff and nonsense!\' cried the other angrily. \'I\'ve been in practice for\r\nhard upon thirty-five years, and I\'m willing to stake my professional\r\nreputation on it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have reason to think you are mistaken.\'\r\n\r\n\'And to what do you ascribe death, pray?\' asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know yet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Upon my soul, I think you must be out of your senses. Really, sir, your\r\nbehaviour is childish. You tell me that you are a surgeon of some\r\neminence ...\'\r\n\r\n\'I surely told you nothing of the sort.\'\r\n\r\n\'Anyhow, you read papers before learned bodies and have them printed.\r\nAnd you come with as silly a story as a Staffordshire peasant who thinks\r\nsomeone has been trying to poison him because he\'s got a stomach-ache.\r\nYou may be a very admirable surgeon, but I venture to think I am more\r\ncapable than you of judging in a case which I attended and you know\r\nnothing about.\'\r\n\r\n\'I mean to take the steps necessary to get an order for exhumation, Dr\r\nRichardson, and I cannot help thinking it will be worth your while to\r\nassist me in every possible way.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall do nothing of the kind. I think you very impertinent, sir. There\r\nis no need for exhumation, and I shall do everything in my power to\r\nprevent it. And I tell you as chairman of the board of magistrates, my\r\nopinion will have as great value as any specialist\'s in Harley Street.\'\r\n\r\nHe flounced to the door and held it open. Susie and Dr Porhoet walked\r\nout; and Arthur, looking down thoughtfully, followed on their heels. Dr\r\nRichardson slammed the street-door angrily.\r\n\r\nDr Porhoet slipped his arm in Arthur\'s.\r\n\r\n\'You must be reasonable, my friend,\' he said. \'From his own point of view\r\nthis doctor has all the rights on his side. You have nothing to justify\r\nyour demands. It is monstrous to expect that for a vague suspicion you\r\nwill be able to get an order for exhumation.\'\r\n\r\nArthur did not answer. The trap was waiting for them.\r\n\r\n\'Why do you want to see Haddo?\' insisted the doctor. \'You will do no more\r\ngood than you have with Dr Richardson.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have made up my mind to see him,\' answered Arthur shortly. \'But there\r\nis no need that either of you should accompany me.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you go, we will come with you,\' said Susie.\r\n\r\nWithout a word Arthur jumped into the dog-cart, and Susie took a seat by\r\nhis side. Dr Porhoet, with a shrug of the shoulders, mounted behind.\r\nArthur whipped up the pony, and at a smart trot they traversed the three\r\nmiles across the barren heath that lay between Venning and Skene.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the park gates, the lodgekeeper, as luck would have it,\r\nwas standing just inside, and she held one of them open for her little\r\nboy to come in. He was playing in the road and showed no inclination to\r\ndo so. Arthur jumped down.\r\n\r\n\'I want to see Mr Haddo,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Mr Haddo\'s not in,\' she answered roughly.\r\n\r\nShe tried to close the gate, but Arthur quickly put his foot inside.\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense! I have to see him on a matter of great importance.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr Haddo\'s orders are that no one is to be admitted.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t help that, I\'m proposing to come in, all the same.\'\r\n\r\nSusie and Dr Porhoet came forward. They promised the small boy a shilling\r\nto hold their horse.\r\n\r\n\'Now then, get out of here,\' cried the woman. \'You\'re not coming in,\r\nwhatever you say.\'\r\n\r\nShe tried to push the gate to, but Arthur\'s foot prevented her. Paying no\r\nheed to her angry expostulations, he forced his way in. He walked quickly\r\nup the drive. The lodge-keeper accompanied him, with shrill abuse. The\r\ngate was left unguarded, and the others were able to follow without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\'You can go to the door, but you won\'t see Mr Haddo,\' the woman cried\r\nangrily. \'You\'ll get me sacked for letting you come.\'\r\n\r\nSusie saw the house. It was a fine old building in the Elizabethan style,\r\nbut much in need of repair; and it had the desolate look of a place that\r\nhas been uninhabited. The garden that surrounded it had been allowed to\r\nrun wild, and the avenue up which they walked was green with rank weeds.\r\nHere and there a fallen tree, which none had troubled to remove, marked\r\nthe owner\'s negligence. Arthur went to the door and rang a bell. They\r\nheard it clang through the house as though not a soul lived there. A man\r\ncame to the door, and as soon as he opened it, Arthur, expecting to be\r\nrefused admission, pushed in. The fellow was as angry as the virago, his\r\nwife, who explained noisily how the three strangers had got into the\r\npark.\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t see the squire, so you\'d better be off. He\'s up in the attics,\r\nand no one\'s allowed to go to him.\'\r\n\r\nThe man tried to push Arthur away.\r\n\r\n\'Be off with you, or I\'ll send for the police.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be a fool,\' said Arthur. \'I mean to find Mr Haddo.\'\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper and his wife broke out with abuse, to which Arthur\r\nlistened in silence. Susie and Dr Porhoet stood by anxiously. They did\r\nnot know what to do. Suddenly a voice at their elbows made them start,\r\nand the two servants were immediately silent.\r\n\r\n\'What can I do for you?\'\r\n\r\nOliver Haddo was standing motionless behind them. It startled Susie that\r\nhe should have come upon them so suddenly, without a sound. Dr Porhoet,\r\nwho had not seen him for some time, was astounded at the change which had\r\ntaken place in him. The corpulence which had been his before was become\r\nnow a positive disease. He was enormous. His chin was a mass of heavy\r\nfolds distended with fat, and his cheeks were puffed up so that his eyes\r\nwere preternaturally small. He peered at you from between the swollen\r\nlids. All his features had sunk into that hideous obesity. His ears were\r\nhorribly bloated, and the lobes were large and swelled. He had apparently\r\na difficulty in breathing, for his large mouth, with its scarlet, shining\r\nlips, was constantly open. He had grown much balder and now there was\r\nonly a crescent of long hair stretching across the back of his head from\r\near to ear. There was something terrible about that great shining scalp.\r\nHis paunch was huge; he was a very tall man and held himself erect, so\r\nthat it protruded like a vast barrel. His hands were infinitely\r\nrepulsive; they were red and soft and moist. He was sweating freely, and\r\nbeads of perspiration stood on his forehead and on his shaven lip.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they all looked at one another in silence. Then Haddo turned\r\nto his servants.\r\n\r\n\'Go,\' he said.\r\n\r\nAs though frightened out of their wits, they made for the door and with a\r\nbustling hurry flung themselves out. A torpid smile crossed his face as\r\nhe watched them go. Then he moved a step nearer his visitors. His manner\r\nhad still the insolent urbanity which was customary to him.\r\n\r\n\'And now, my friends, will you tell me how I can be of service to you?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have come about Margaret\'s death,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nHaddo, as was his habit, did not immediately answer. He looked slowly\r\nfrom Arthur to Dr Porhoet, and from Dr Porhoet to Susie. His eyes rested\r\non her hat, and she felt uncomfortably that he was inventing some gibe\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\'I should have thought this hardly the moment to intrude upon my sorrow,\'\r\nhe said at last. \'If you have condolences to offer, I venture to suggest\r\nthat you might conveniently send them by means of the penny post.\'\r\n\r\nArthur frowned.\r\n\r\n\'Why did you not let me know that she was ill?\' he asked.\r\n\r\n\'Strange as it may seem to you, my worthy friend, it never occurred to me\r\nthat my wife\'s health could be any business of yours.\'\r\n\r\nA faint smile flickered once more on Haddo\'s lips, but his eyes had still\r\nthe peculiar hardness which was so uncanny. Arthur looked at him\r\nsteadily.\r\n\r\n\'I have every reason to believe that you killed her,\' he said.\r\n\r\nHaddo\'s face did not for an instant change its expression.\r\n\r\n\'And have you communicated your suspicions to the police?\'\r\n\r\n\'I propose to.\'\r\n\r\n\'And, if I am not indiscreet, may I inquire upon what you base them?\'\r\n\r\n\'I saw Margaret three weeks ago, and she told me that she went in terror\r\nof her life.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor Margaret! She had always the romantic temperament. I think it was\r\nthat which first brought us together.\'\r\n\r\n\'You damned scoundrel!\' cried Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'My dear fellow, pray moderate your language. This is surely not an\r\noccasion when you should give way to your lamentable taste for abuse. You\r\noutrage all Miss Boyd\'s susceptibilities.\' He turned to her with an airy\r\nwave of his fat hand. \'You must forgive me if I do not offer you the\r\nhospitality of Skene, but the loss I have so lately sustained does not\r\npermit me to indulge in the levity of entertaining.\'\r\n\r\nHe gave her an ironical, low bow; then looked once more at Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'If I can be of no further use to you, perhaps you would leave me to my\r\nown reflections. The lodgekeeper will give you the exact address of the\r\nvillage constable.\'\r\n\r\nArthur did not answer. He stared into vacancy, as if he were turning over\r\nthings in his mind. Then he turned sharply on his heel and walked towards\r\nthe gate. Susie and Dr Porhoet, taken completely aback, did not know what\r\nto do; and Haddo\'s little eyes twinkled as he watched their discomfiture.\r\n\r\n\'I always thought that your friend had deplorable manners,\' he murmured.\r\n\r\nSusie, feeling very ridiculous, flushed, and Dr Porhoet awkwardly took\r\noff his hat. As they walked away, they felt Haddo\'s mocking gaze fixed\r\nupon them, and they were heartily thankful to reach the gate. They found\r\nArthur waiting for them.\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon,\' he said, \'I forgot that I was not alone.\'\r\n\r\nThe three of them drove slowly back to the inn.\r\n\r\n\'What are you going to do now?\' asked Susie.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Arthur made no reply, and Susie thought he could not have\r\nheard her. At last he broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\'I see that I can do nothing by ordinary methods. I realize that it is\r\nuseless to make a public outcry. There is only my own conviction that\r\nMargaret came to a violent end, and I cannot expect anyone to pay heed to\r\nthat.\'\r\n\r\n\'After all, it\'s just possible that she really died of heart disease.\'\r\n\r\nArthur gave Susie a long look. He seemed to consider her words\r\ndeliberately.\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps there are means to decide that conclusively,\' he replied at\r\nlength, thoughtfully, as though he were talking to himself.\r\n\r\n\'What are they?\'\r\n\r\nArthur did not answer. When they came to the door of the inn, he stopped.\r\n\r\n\'Will you go in? I wish to take a walk by myself,\' he said.\r\n\r\nSusie looked at him anxiously.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re not going to do anything rash?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will do nothing till I have made quite sure that Margaret was foully\r\nmurdered.\'\r\n\r\nHe turned on his heel and walked quickly away. It was late now, and they\r\nfound a frugal meal waiting for them in the little sitting-room. It\r\nseemed no use to delay it till Arthur came back, and silently,\r\nsorrowfully, they ate. Afterwards, the doctor smoked cigarettes, while\r\nSusie sat at the open window and looked at the stars. She thought of\r\nMargaret, of her beauty and her charming frankness, of her fall and of\r\nher miserable end; and she began to cry quietly. She knew enough of the\r\nfacts now to be aware that the wretched girl was not to blame for\r\nanything that had happened. A cruel fate had fallen upon her, and she had\r\nbeen as powerless as in the old tales Phaedra, the daughter of Minos, or\r\nMyrrha of the beautiful hair. The hours passed, and still Arthur did not\r\nreturn. Susie thought now only of him, and she was frightfully anxious.\r\n\r\nBut at last he came in. The night was far advanced. He put down his hat\r\nand sat down. For a long while he looked silently at Dr. Porhoet.\r\n\r\n\'What is it, my friend?\' asked the good doctor at length.\r\n\r\n\'Do you remember that you told us once of an experiment you made in\r\nAlexandria?\' he said, after some hesitation.\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a curious voice.\r\n\r\n\'You told us that you took a boy, and when he looked in a magic mirror,\r\nhe saw things which he could not possibly have known.\'\r\n\r\n\'I remember very well,\' said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\'I was much inclined to laugh at you at the time. I was convinced that\r\nthe boy was a knave who deceived you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of late I\'ve thought of that story often. Some hidden recess of my\r\nmemory has been opened, and I seem to remember strange things. Was I\r\nthe boy who looked in the ink?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said the doctor quietly.\r\n\r\nArthur did not say anything. A profound silence fell upon them, while\r\nSusie and the doctor watched him intently. They wondered what was in his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\'There is a side of my character which I did not know till lately,\'\r\nArthur said at last. \'When first it dawned upon me, I fought against it.\r\nI said to myself that deep down in all of us, a relic from the long past,\r\nis the remains of the superstition that blinded our fathers; and it is\r\nneedful for the man of science to fight against it with all his might.\r\nAnd yet it was stronger than I. Perhaps my birth, my early years, in\r\nthose Eastern lands where everyone believes in the supernatural, affected\r\nme although I did not know it. I began to remember vague, mysterious\r\nthings, which I never knew had been part of my knowledge. And at last one\r\nday it seemed that a new window was opened on to my soul, and I saw with\r\nextraordinary clearness the incident which you had described. I knew\r\nsuddenly it was part of my own experience. I saw you take me by the hand\r\nand pour the ink on my palm and bid me look at it. I felt again the\r\nstrange glow that thrilled me, and with an indescribable bitterness I saw\r\nthings in the mirror which were not there before. I saw people whom I had\r\nnever seen. I saw them perform certain actions. And some force I knew\r\nnot, obliged me to speak. And at length everything grew dim, and I was as\r\nexhausted as if I had not eaten all day.\'\r\n\r\nHe went over to the open window and looked out. Neither of the others\r\nspoke. The look on Arthur\'s face, curiously outlined by the light of the\r\nlamp, was very stern. He seemed to undergo some mental struggle of\r\nextraordinary violence. He breath came quickly. At last he turned and\r\nfaced them. He spoke hoarsely, quickly.\r\n\r\n\'I must see Margaret again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Arthur, you\'re mad!\' cried Susie.\r\n\r\nHe went up to Dr Porhoet and, putting his hands on his shoulders, looked\r\nfixedly into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\'You have studied this science. You know all that can be known of it. I\r\nwant you to show her to me.\'\r\n\r\nThe doctor gave an exclamation of alarm.\r\n\r\n\'My dear fellow, how can I? I have read many books, but I have never\r\npractised anything. I have only studied these matters for my amusement.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you believe it can be done?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t understand what you want.\'\r\n\r\n\'I want you to bring her to me so that I may speak with her, so that I\r\nmay find out the truth.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think I am God that I can raise men from the dead?\'\r\n\r\nArthur\'s hands pressed him down in the chair from which he sought to\r\nrise. His fingers were clenched on the old man\'s shoulders so that he\r\ncould hardly bear the pain.\r\n\r\n\'You told us how once Eliphas Levi raised a spirit. Do you believe that\r\nwas true?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know. I have always kept an open mind. There was much to be said\r\non both sides.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, now you must believe. You must do what he did.\'\r\n\r\n\'You must be mad, Arthur.\'\r\n\r\n\'I want you to come to that spot where I saw her last. If her spirit can\r\nbe brought back anywhere, it must be in that place where she sat and\r\nwept. You know all the ceremonies and all the words that are necessary.\'\r\n\r\nBut Susie came forward and laid her hand on his arm. He looked at her\r\nwith a frown.\r\n\r\n\'Arthur, you know in your heart that nothing can come of it. You\'re only\r\nincreasing your unhappiness. And even if you could bring her from the\r\ngrave for a moment, why can you not let her troubled soul rest in peace?\'\r\n\r\n\'If she died a natural death we shall have no power over her, but if her\r\ndeath was violent perhaps her spirit is earthbound still. I tell you I\r\nmust be certain. I want to see her once more, and afterwards I shall know\r\nwhat to do.\'\r\n\r\n\'I cannot, I cannot,\' said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\'Give me the books and I will do it alone.\'\r\n\r\n\'You know that I have nothing here.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you must help me,\' said Arthur. \'After all, why should you mind? We\r\nperform a certain operation, and if nothing happens we are no worse off\r\nthen before. On the other hand, if we succeed.... Oh, for God\'s sake,\r\nhelp me! If you have any care for my happiness do this one thing for me.\'\r\n\r\nHe stepped back and looked at the doctor. The Frenchman\'s eyes were fixed\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s madness,\' he muttered.\r\n\r\nHe was intensely moved by Arthur\'s appeal. At last he shrugged his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\'After all, if it is but a foolish mummery it can do no harm.\'\r\n\r\n\'You will help me?\' cried Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'If it can give you any peace or any satisfaction, I am willing to do\r\nwhat I can. But I warn you to be prepared for a great disappointment.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur wished to set about the invocation then and there, but Dr Porhoet\r\nsaid it was impossible. They were all exhausted after the long journey,\r\nand it was necessary to get certain things together without which nothing\r\ncould be done. In his heart he thought that a night\'s rest would bring\r\nArthur to a more reasonable mind. When the light of day shone upon the\r\nearth he would be ashamed of the desire which ran counter to all his\r\nprepossessions. But Arthur remembered that on the next day it would be\r\nexactly a week since Margaret\'s death, and it seemed to him that then\r\ntheir spells might have a greater efficacy.\r\n\r\nWhen they came down in the morning and greeted one another, it was plain\r\nthat none of them had slept.\r\n\r\n\'Are you still of the same purpose as last night?\' asked Dr Porhoet\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\'I am.\'\r\n\r\nThe doctor hesitated nervously.\r\n\r\n\'It will be necessary, if you wish to follow out the rules of the old\r\nnecromancers, to fast through the whole day.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am ready to do anything.\'\r\n\r\n\'It will be no hardship to me,\' said Susie, with a little hysterical\r\nlaugh. \'I feel I couldn\'t eat a thing if I tried.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think the whole affair is sheer folly,\' said Dr Porhoet.\r\n\r\n\'You promised me you would try.\'\r\n\r\nThe day, the long summer day, passed slowly. There was a hard brilliancy\r\nin the sky that reminded the Frenchman of those Egyptian heavens when\r\nthe earth seemed crushed beneath a bowl of molten fire. Arthur was too\r\nrestless to remain indoors and left the others to their own devices. He\r\nwalked without aim, as fast as he could go; he felt no weariness. The\r\nburning sun beat down upon him, but he did not know it. The hours passed\r\nwith lagging feet. Susie lay on her bed and tried to read. Her nerves\r\nwere so taut that, when there was a sound in the courtyard of a pail\r\nfalling on the cobbles, she cried out in terror. The sun rose, and\r\npresently her window was flooded with quivering rays of gold. It was\r\nmidday. The day passed, and it was afternoon. The evening came, but it\r\nbrought no freshness. Meanwhile Dr Porhoet sat in the little parlour,\r\nwith his head between his hands, trying by a great mental effort to bring\r\nback to his memory all that he had read. His heart began to beat more\r\nquickly. Then the night fell, and one by one the stars shone out. There\r\nwas no wind. The air was heavy. Susie came downstairs and began to talk\r\nwith Dr Porhoet. But they spoke in a low tone, as if they were afraid\r\nthat someone would overhear. They were faint now with want of food. The\r\nhours went one by one, and the striking of a clock filled them each time\r\nwith a mysterious apprehension. The lights in the village were put out\r\nlittle by little, and everybody slept. Susie had lighted the lamp, and\r\nthey watched beside it. A cold shiver passed through her.\r\n\r\n\'I feel as though someone were lying dead in the room,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Why does not Arthur come?\'\r\n\r\nThey spoke inconsequently, and neither heeded what the other said. The\r\nwindow was wide open, but the air was difficult to breathe. And now the\r\nsilence was so unusual that Susie grew strangely nervous. She tried to\r\nthink of the noisy streets in Paris, the constant roar of traffic, and\r\nthe shuffling of the crowds toward evening as the work people returned to\r\ntheir homes. She stood up.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no air tonight. Look at the trees. Not a leaf is moving.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why does not Arthur come?\' repeated the doctor.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no moon tonight. It will be very dark at Skene.\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'s walked all day. He should be here by now.\'\r\n\r\nSusie felt an extraordinary oppression, and she panted for breath. At\r\nlast they heard a step on the road outside, and Arthur stood at the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\'Are you ready to come?\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ve been waiting for you.\'\r\n\r\nThey joined him, bringing the few things that Dr Porhoet had said were\r\nnecessary, and they walked along the solitary road that led to Skene.\r\nOn each side the heather stretched into the dark night, and there was\r\na blackness about it that was ominous. There was no sound save that of\r\ntheir own steps. Dimly, under the stars, they saw the desolation with\r\nwhich they were surrounded. The way seemed very long. They were utterly\r\nexhausted, and they could hardly drag one foot after the other.\r\n\r\n\'You must let me rest for a minute,\' said Susie.\r\n\r\nThey did not answer, but stopped, and she sat on a boulder by the\r\nwayside. They stood motionless in front of her, waiting patiently till\r\nshe was ready. After a little while she forced herself to get up.\r\n\r\n\'Now I can go,\' she said.\r\n\r\nStill they did not speak, but walked on. They moved like figures in\r\na dream, with a stealthy directness, as though they acted under the\r\ninfluence of another\'s will. Suddenly the road stopped, and they found\r\nthemselves at the gates of Skene.\r\n\r\n\'Follow me very closely,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nHe turned on one side, and they followed a paling. Susie could feel that\r\nthey walked along a narrow path. She could see hardly two steps in front\r\nof her. At last he stood still.\r\n\r\n\'I came here earlier in the night and made the opening easier to get\r\nthrough.\'\r\n\r\nHe turned back a broken piece of railing and slipped in. Susie followed,\r\nand Dr Porhoet entered after her.\r\n\r\n\'I can see nothing,\' said Susie.\r\n\r\n\'Give my your hand, and I will lead you.\'\r\n\r\nThey walked with difficulty through the tangled bracken, among closely\r\nplanted trees. They stumbled, and once Dr Porhoet fell. It seemed that\r\nthey went a long way. Susie\'s heart beat fast with anxiety. All her\r\nweariness was forgotten.\r\n\r\nThen Arthur stopped them, and he pointed in front of him. Through an\r\nopening in the trees, they saw the house. All the windows were dark\r\nexcept those just under the roof, and from them came bright lights.\r\n\r\n\'Those are the attics which he uses as a laboratory. You see, he is\r\nworking now. There is no one else in the house.\'\r\n\r\nSusie was curiously fascinated by the flaming lights. There was an awful\r\nmystery in those unknown labours which absorbed Oliver Haddo night after\r\nnight till the sun rose. What horrible things were done there, hidden\r\nfrom the eyes of men? By himself in that vast house the madman performed\r\nghastly experiments; and who could tell what dark secrets he trafficked\r\nin?\r\n\r\n\'There is no danger that he will come out,\' said Arthur. \'He remains\r\nthere till the break of day.\'\r\n\r\nHe took her hand again and led her on. Back they went among the trees,\r\nand presently they were on a pathway. They walked along with greater\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\'Are you all right, Porhoet?\' asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n\'Yes.\'\r\n\r\nBut the trees grew thicker and the night more sombre. Now the stars were\r\nshut out, and they could hardly see in front of them.\r\n\r\n\'Here we are,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nThey stopped, and found that there was in front of them a green space\r\nformed by four cross-ways. In the middle a stone bench gleamed vaguely\r\nagainst the darkness.\r\n\r\n\'This is where Margaret sat when last I saw her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can see to do nothing here,\' said the doctor.\r\n\r\nThey had brought two flat bowls of brass to serve as censers, and these\r\nArthur gave to Dr Porhoet. He stood by Susie\'s side while the doctor\r\nbusied himself with his preparations. They saw him move to and fro. They\r\nsaw him bend to the ground. Presently there was a crackling of wood, and\r\nfrom the brazen bowls red flames shot up. They did not know what he\r\nburnt, but there were heavy clouds of smoke, and a strong, aromatic\r\nodour filled the air. Now and again the doctor was sharply silhouetted\r\nagainst the light. His slight, bowed figure was singularly mysterious.\r\nWhen Susie caught sight of his face, she saw that it was touched with a\r\nstrong emotion. The work he was at affected him so that his doubts, his\r\nfears, had vanished. He looked like some old alchemist busied with\r\nunnatural things. Susie\'s heart began to beat painfully. She was growing\r\ndesperately frightened and stretched out her hand so that she might touch\r\nArthur. Silently he put his arm through hers. And now the doctor was\r\ntracing strange signs upon the ground. The flames died down and only a\r\nglow remained, but he seemed to have no difficulty in seeing what he was\r\nabout. Susie could not discern what figures he drew. Then he put more\r\ntwigs upon the braziers, and the flames sprang up once more, cutting the\r\ndarkness sharply as with a sword.\r\n\r\n\'Now come,\' he said.\r\n\r\nBut, inexplicably, a sudden terror seized Susie. She felt that the hairs\r\nof her head stood up, and a cold sweat broke out on her body. Her limbs\r\nhad grown on an instant inconceivably heavy so that she could not move.\r\nA panic such as she had never known came upon her, and, except that her\r\nlegs would not carry her, she would have fled blindly. She began to\r\ntremble. She tried to speak, but her tongue clave to her throat.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t, I\'m afraid,\' she muttered hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\'You must. Without you we can do nothing,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nShe could not reason with herself. She had forgotten everything except\r\nthat she was frightened to death. Her heart was beating so quickly that\r\nshe almost fainted. And now Arthur held her, so firmly that she winced.\r\n\r\n\'Let me go,\' she whispered. \'I won\'t help you. I\'m afraid.\'\r\n\r\n\'You must,\' he said. \'You must.\'\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'I tell you, you must come.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why?\'\r\n\r\nHer deadly fear expressed itself in a passion of sudden anger.\r\n\r\n\'Because you love me, and it\'s the only way to give me peace.\'\r\n\r\nShe uttered a low wail of pain, and her terror gave way to shame. She\r\nblushed to the roots of her hair because he too knew her secret. And then\r\nshe was seized again with anger because he had the cruelty to taunt her\r\nwith it. She had recovered her courage now, and she stepped forward. Dr.\r\nPorhoet told her where to stand. Arthur took his place in front of her.\r\n\r\n\'You must not move till I give you leave. If you go outside the figure I\r\nhave drawn, I cannot protect you.\'\r\n\r\nFor a moment Dr Porhoet stood in perfect silence. Then he began to recite\r\nstrange words in Latin. Susie heard him but vaguely. She did not know the\r\nsense, and his voice was so low that she could not have distinguished the\r\nwords. But his intonation had lost that gentle irony which was habitual\r\nto him, and he spoke with a trembling gravity that was extraordinarily\r\nimpressive. Arthur stood immobile as a rock. The flames died away, and\r\nthey saw one another only by the glow of the ashes, dimly, like persons\r\nin a vision of death. There was silence. Then the necromancer spoke\r\nagain, and now his voice was louder. He seemed to utter weird\r\ninvocations, but they were in a tongue that the others knew not. And\r\nwhile he spoke the light from the burning cinders on a sudden went out.\r\n\r\nIt did not die, but was sharply extinguished, as though by invisible\r\nhands. And now the darkness was more sombre than that of the blackest\r\nnight. The trees that surrounded them were hidden from their eyes, and\r\nthe whiteness of the stone bench was seen no longer. They stood but a\r\nlittle way one from the other, but each might have stood alone. Susie\r\nstrained her eyes, but she could see nothing. She looked up quickly;\r\nthe stars were gone out, and she could see no further over her head than\r\nround about. The darkness was terrifying. And from it, Dr Porhoet\'s voice\r\nhad a ghastly effect. It seemed to come, wonderfully changed, from the\r\nvoid of bottomless chaos. Susie clenched her hands so that she might not\r\nfaint.\r\n\r\nAll at once she started, for the old man\'s voice was cut by a sudden gust\r\nof wind. A moment before, the utter silence had been almost intolerable,\r\nand now a storm seemed to have fallen upon them. The trees all around\r\nthem rocked in the wind; they heard the branches creak; and they heard\r\nthe hissing of the leaves. They were in the midst of a hurricane. And\r\nthey felt the earth sway as it resisted the straining roots of great\r\ntrees, which seemed to be dragged up by the force of the furious gale.\r\nWhistling and roaring, the wind stormed all about them, and the doctor,\r\nraising his voice, tried in vain to command it. But the strangest thing\r\nof all was that, where they stood, there was no sign of the raging blast.\r\nThe air immediately about them was as still as it had been before, and\r\nnot a hair on Susie\'s head was moved. And it was terrible to hear the\r\ntumult, and yet to be in a calm that was almost unnatural.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden, Dr Porhoet raised his voice, and with a sternness they had\r\nnever heard in it before, cried out in that unknown language. Then he\r\ncalled upon Margaret. He called her name three times. In the uproar Susie\r\ncould scarcely hear. Terror had seized her again, but in her confusion\r\nshe remembered his command, and she dared not move.\r\n\r\n\'Margaret, Margaret, Margaret.\'\r\n\r\nWithout a pause between, as quickly as a stone falls to the ground, the\r\ndin which was all about them ceased. There was no gradual diminution. But\r\nat one moment there was a roaring hurricane and at the next a silence so\r\ncomplete that it might have been the silence of death.\r\n\r\nAnd then, seeming to come out of nothingness, extraordinarily, they heard\r\nwith a curious distinctness the sound of a woman weeping. Susie\'s heart\r\nstood still. They heard the sound of a woman weeping, and they recognized\r\nthe voice of Margaret. A groan of anguish burst from Arthur\'s lips, and\r\nhe was on the point of starting forward. But quickly Dr Porhoet put out\r\nhis hand to prevent him. The sound was heartrending, the sobbing of a\r\nwoman who had lost all hope, the sobbing of a woman terrified. If Susie\r\nhad been able to stir, she would have put her hands to her ears to shut\r\nout the ghastly agony of it.\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment, notwithstanding the heavy darkness of the starless\r\nnight, Arthur saw her. She was seated on the stone bench as when last he\r\nhad spoken with her. In her anguish she sought not to hide her face. She\r\nlooked at the ground, and the tears fell down her cheeks. Her bosom\r\nheaved with the pain of her weeping.\r\n\r\nThen Arthur knew that all his suspicions were justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur would not leave the little village of Venning. Neither Susie nor\r\nthe doctor could get him to make any decision. None of them spoke of the\r\nnight which they had spent in the woods of Skene; but it coloured all\r\ntheir thoughts, and they were not free for a single moment from the\r\nghastly memory of it. They seemed still to hear the sound of that\r\npassionate weeping. Arthur was moody. When he was with them, he spoke\r\nlittle; he opposed a stubborn resistance to their efforts at diverting\r\nhis mind. He spent long hours by himself, in the country, and they had no\r\nidea what he did. Susie was terribly anxious. He had lost his balance so\r\ncompletely that she was prepared for any rashness. She divined that his\r\nhatred of Haddo was no longer within the bounds of reason. The desire for\r\nvengeance filled him entirely, so that he was capable of any violence.\r\n\r\nSeveral days went by.\r\n\r\nAt last, in concert with Dr Porhoet, she determined to make one more\r\nattempt. It was late at night, and they sat with open windows in the\r\nsitting-room of the inn. There was a singular oppressiveness in the air\r\nwhich suggested that a thunderstorm was at hand. Susie prayed for it; for\r\nshe ascribed to the peculiar heat of the last few days much of Arthur\'s\r\nsullen irritability.\r\n\r\n\'Arthur, you _must_ tell us what you are going to do,\' she said. \'It\r\nis useless to stay here. We are all so ill and nervous that we cannot\r\nconsider anything rationally. We want you to come away with us tomorrow.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can go if you choose,\' he said. \'I shall remain till that man is\r\ndead.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is madness to talk like that. You can do nothing. You are only making\r\nyourself worse by staying here.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have quite made up my mind.\'\r\n\r\n\'The law can offer you no help, and what else can you do?\'\r\n\r\nShe asked the question, meaning if possible to get from him some hint of\r\nhis intentions; but the grimness of his answer, though it only confirmed\r\nher vague suspicions, startled her.\r\n\r\n\'If I can do nothing else, I shall shoot him like a dog.\'\r\n\r\nShe could think of nothing to say, and for a while they remained in\r\nsilence. Then he got up.\r\n\r\n\'I think I should prefer it if you went,\' he said. \'You can only hamper\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall stay here as long as you do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why?\'\r\n\r\n\'Because if you do anything, I shall be compromised. I may be arrested. I\r\nthink the fear of that may restrain you.\'\r\n\r\nHe looked at her steadily. She met his eyes with a calmness which\r\nshowed that she meant exactly what she said, and he turned uneasily\r\naway. A silence even greater than before fell upon them. They did not\r\nmove. It was so still in the room that it might have been empty. The\r\nbreathlessness of the air increased, so that it was horribly oppressive.\r\nSuddenly there was a loud rattle of thunder, and a flash of lightning\r\ntore across the heavy clouds. Susie thanked Heaven for the storm which\r\nwould give presently a welcome freshness. She felt excessively ill at\r\nease, and it was a relief to ascribe her sensation to a state of the\r\natmosphere. Again the thunder rolled. It was so loud that it seemed to\r\nbe immediately above their heads. And the wind rose suddenly and swept\r\nwith a long moan through the trees that surrounded the house. It was a\r\nsound so human that it might have come from the souls of dead men\r\nsuffering hopeless torments of regret.\r\n\r\nThe lamp went out, so suddenly that Susie was vaguely frightened. It gave\r\none flicker, and they were in total darkness. It seemed as though someone\r\nhad leaned over the chimney and blown it out. The night was very black,\r\nand they could not see the window which opened on to the country. The\r\ndarkness was so peculiar that for a moment no one stirred.\r\n\r\nThen Susie heard Dr Porhoet slip his hand across the table to find\r\nmatches, but it seemed that they were not there. Again a loud peal of\r\nthunder startled them, but the rain would not fall. They panted for fresh\r\nair. On a sudden Susie\'s heart gave a bound, and she sprang up.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s someone in the room.\'\r\n\r\nThe words were no sooner out of her mouth than she heard Arthur fling\r\nhimself upon the intruder. She knew at once, with the certainty of an\r\nintuition, that it was Haddo. But how had he come in? What did he want?\r\nShe tried to cry out, but no sound came from her throat. Dr Porhoet\r\nseemed bound to his chair. He did not move. He made no sound. She knew\r\nthat an awful struggle was proceeding. It was a struggle to the death\r\nbetween two men who hated one another, but the most terrible part of it\r\nwas that nothing was heard. They were perfectly noiseless. She tried to\r\ndo something, but she could not stir. And Arthur\'s heart exulted, for his\r\nenemy was in his grasp, under his hands, and he would not let him go\r\nwhile life was in him. He clenched his teeth and tightened his straining\r\nmuscles. Susie heard his laboured breathing, but she only heard the\r\nbreathing of one man. She wondered in abject terror what that could mean.\r\nThey struggled silently, hand to hand, and Arthur knew that his strength\r\nwas greater. He had made up his mind what to do and directed all his\r\nenergy to a definite end. His enemy was extraordinarily powerful, but\r\nArthur appeared to create some strength from the sheer force of his will.\r\nIt seemed for hours that they struggled. He could not bear him down.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, he knew that the other was frightened and sought to escape from\r\nhim. Arthur tightened his grasp; for nothing in the world now would he\r\never loosen his hold. He took a deep, quick breath, and then put out all\r\nhis strength in a tremendous effort. They swayed from side to side.\r\nArthur felt as if his muscles were being torn from the bones, he could\r\nnot continue for more than a moment longer; but the agony that flashed\r\nacross his mind at the thought of failure braced him to a sudden angry\r\njerk. All at once Haddo collapsed, and they fell heavily to the ground.\r\nArthur was breathing more quickly now. He thought that if he could keep\r\non for one instant longer, he would be safe. He threw all his weight on\r\nthe form that rolled beneath him, and bore down furiously on the man\'s\r\narm. He twisted it sharply, with all his might, and felt it give way. He\r\ngave a low cry of triumph; the arm was broken. And now his enemy was\r\nseized with panic; he struggled madly, he wanted only to get away from\r\nthose long hands that were killing him. They seemed to be of iron. Arthur\r\nseized the huge bullock throat and dug his fingers into it, and they sunk\r\ninto the heavy rolls of fat; and he flung the whole weight of his body\r\ninto them. He exulted, for he knew that his enemy was in his power at\r\nlast; he was strangling him, strangling the life out of him. He wanted\r\nlight so that he might see the horror of that vast face, and the deadly\r\nfear, and the staring eyes. And still he pressed with those iron hands.\r\nAnd now the movements were strangely convulsive. His victim writhed in\r\nthe agony of death. His struggles were desperate, but the avenging hands\r\nheld him as in a vice. And then the movements grew spasmodic, and then\r\nthey grew weaker. Still the hands pressed upon the gigantic throat, and\r\nArthur forgot everything. He was mad with rage and fury and hate and\r\nsorrow. He thought of Margaret\'s anguish and of her fiendish torture, and\r\nhe wished the man had ten lives so that he might take them one by one.\r\nAnd at last all was still, and that vast mass of flesh was motionless,\r\nand he knew that his enemy was dead. He loosened his grasp and slipped\r\none hand over the heart. It would never beat again. The man was stone\r\ndead. Arthur got up and straightened himself. The darkness was intense\r\nstill, and he could see nothing. Susie heard him, and at length she was\r\nable to speak.\r\n\r\n\'Arthur what have you done?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve killed him,\' he said hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\'O God, what shall we do?\'\r\n\r\nArthur began to laugh aloud, hysterically, and in the darkness his\r\nhilarity was terrifying.\r\n\r\n\'For God\'s sake let us have some light.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve found the matches,\' said Dr Porhoet.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to awake suddenly from his long stupor. He struck one, and it\r\nwould not light. He struck another, and Susie took off the globe and the\r\nchimney as he kindled the wick. Then he held up the lamp, and they saw\r\nArthur looking at them. His face was ghastly. The sweat ran off his\r\nforehead in great beads, and his eyes were bloodshot. He trembled in\r\nevery limb. Then Dr Porhoet advanced with the lamp and held it forward.\r\nThey looked down on the floor for the man who lay there dead. Susie gave\r\na sudden cry of horror.\r\n\r\nThere was no one there.\r\n\r\nArthur stepped back in terrified surprise. There was no one in the room,\r\nliving or dead, but the three friends. The ground sank under Susie\'s\r\nfeet, she felt horribly ill, and she fainted. When she awoke, seeming\r\ndifficultly to emerge from an eternal night, Arthur was holding down her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\'Bend down,\' he said. \'Bend down.\'\r\n\r\nAll that had happened came back to her, and she burst into tears. Her\r\nself-control deserted her, and, clinging to him for protection, she\r\nsobbed as though her heart would break. She was shaking from head to\r\nfoot. The strangeness of this last horror had overcome her, and she could\r\nhave shrieked with fright.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all right,\' he said. \'You need not be afraid.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, what does it mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'You must pluck up courage. We\'re going now to Skene.\'\r\n\r\nShe sprang to her feet, as though to get away from him; her heart beat\r\nwildly.\r\n\r\n\'No, I can\'t; I\'m frightened.\'\r\n\r\n\'We must see what it means. We have no time to lose, or the morning will\r\nbe upon us before we get back.\'\r\n\r\nThen she sought to prevent him.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, for God\'s sake, don\'t go, Arthur. Something awful may await you\r\nthere. Don\'t risk your life.\'\r\n\r\n\'There is no danger. I tell you the man is dead.\'\r\n\r\n\'If anything happened to you ...\'\r\n\r\nShe stopped, trying to restrain her sobs; she dared not go on. But he\r\nseemed to know what was in her mind.\r\n\r\n\'I will take no risks, because of you. I know that whether I live or die\r\nis not a--matter of indifference to you.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked up and saw that his eyes were fixed upon her gravely. She\r\nreddened. A curious feeling came into her heart.\r\n\r\n\'I will go with you wherever you choose,\' she said humbly.\r\n\r\n\'Come, then.\'\r\n\r\nThey stepped out into the night. And now, without rain, the storm had\r\npassed away, and the stars were shining. They walked quickly. Arthur\r\nwent in front of them. Dr Porhoet and Susie followed him, side by side,\r\nand they had to hasten their steps in order not to be left behind. It\r\nseemed to them that the horror of the night was passed, and there was\r\na fragrancy in the air which was wonderfully refreshing. The sky was\r\nbeautiful. And at last they came to Skene. Arthur led them again to the\r\nopening in the palisade, and he took Susie\'s hand. Presently they stood\r\nin the place from which a few days before they had seen the house. As\r\nthen, it stood in massive blackness against the night and, as then, the\r\nattic windows shone out with brilliant lights. Susie started, for she\r\nhad expected that the whole place would be in darkness.\r\n\r\n\'There is no danger, I promise you,\' said Arthur gently. \'We are going to\r\nfind out the meaning of all this mystery.\'\r\n\r\nHe began to walk towards the house.\r\n\r\n\'Have you a weapon of some sort?\' asked the doctor.\r\n\r\nArthur handed him a revolver.\r\n\r\n\'Take this. It will reassure you, but you will have no need of it. I\r\nbought it the other day when--I had other plans.\'\r\n\r\nSusie gave a little shudder. They reached the drive and walked to the\r\ngreat portico which adorned the facade of the house. Arthur tried the\r\nhandle, but it would not open.\r\n\r\n\'Will you wait here?\' he said. \'I can get through one of the windows, and\r\nI will let you in.\'\r\n\r\nHe left them. They stood quietly there, with anxious hearts; they could\r\nnot guess what they would see. They were afraid that something would\r\nhappen to Arthur, and Susie regretted that she had not insisted on going\r\nwith him. Suddenly she remembered that awful moment when the light of the\r\nlamp had been thrown where all expected to see a body, and there was\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\'What do you think it meant?\' she cried suddenly. \'What is the\r\nexplanation?\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps we shall see now,\' answered the doctor.\r\n\r\nArthur still lingered, and she could not imagine what had become of him.\r\nAll sorts of horrible fancies passed through her mind, and she dreaded\r\nshe knew not what. At last they heard a footstep inside the house, and\r\nthe door was opened.\r\n\r\n\'I was convinced that nobody slept here, but I was obliged to make sure.\r\nI had some difficulty in getting in.\'\r\n\r\nSusie hesitated to enter. She did not know what horrors awaited her, and\r\nthe darkness was terrifying.\r\n\r\n\'I cannot see,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve brought a torch,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nHe pressed a button, and a narrow ray of bright light was cast upon the\r\nfloor. Dr Porhoet and Susie went in. Arthur carefully closed the door,\r\nand flashed the light of his torch all round them. They stood in a large\r\nhall, the floor of which was scattered with the skins of lions that Haddo\r\non his celebrated expedition had killed in Africa. There were perhaps\r\na dozen, and their number gave a wild, barbaric note. A great oak\r\nstaircase led to the upper floors.\r\n\r\n\'We must go through all the rooms,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nHe did not expect to find Haddo till they came to the lighted attics, but\r\nit seemed needful nevertheless to pass right through the house on their\r\nway. A flash of his torch had shown him that the walls of the hall were\r\ndecorated with all manner of armour, ancient swords of Eastern handiwork,\r\nbarbaric weapons from central Africa, savage implements of medieval\r\nwarfare; and an idea came to him. He took down a huge battle-axe and\r\nswung it in his hand.\r\n\r\n\'Now come.\'\r\n\r\nSilently, holding their breath as though they feared to wake the dead,\r\nthey went into the first room. They saw it difficultly with their scant\r\nlight, since the thin shaft of brilliancy, emphasising acutely the\r\nsurrounding darkness, revealed it only piece by piece. It was a large\r\nroom, evidently unused, for the furniture was covered with holland, and\r\nthere was a mustiness about it which suggested that the windows were\r\nseldom opened. As in many old houses, the rooms led not from a passage\r\nbut into one another, and they walked through many till they came back\r\ninto the hall. They had all a desolate, uninhabited air. Their sombreness\r\nwas increased by the oak with which they were panelled. There was\r\npanelling in the hall too, and on the stairs that led broadly to the\r\ntop of the house. As they ascended, Arthur stopped for one moment and\r\npassed his hand over the polished wood.\r\n\r\n\'It would burn like tinder,\' he said.\r\n\r\nThey went through the rooms on the first floor, and they were as empty\r\nand as cheerless. Presently they came to that which had been Margaret\'s.\r\nIn a bowl were dead flowers. Her brushes were still on the toilet table.\r\nBut it was a gloomy chamber, with its dark oak, and, so comfortless that\r\nSusie shuddered. Arthur stood for a time and looked at it, but he said\r\nnothing. They found themselves again on the stairs and they went to the\r\nsecond storey. But here they seemed to be at the top of the house.\r\n\r\n\'How does one get up to the attics?\' said Arthur, looking about him with\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nHe paused for a while to think. Then he nodded his head.\r\n\r\n\'There must be some steps leading out of one of the rooms.\'\r\n\r\nThey went on. And now the ceilings were much lower, with heavy beams,\r\nand there was no furniture at all. The emptiness seemed to make\r\neverything more terrifying. They felt that they were on the threshold\r\nof a great mystery, and Susie\'s heart began to beat fast. Arthur\r\nconducted his examination with the greatest method; he walked round\r\neach room carefully, looking for a door that might lead to a staircase;\r\nbut there was no sign of one.\r\n\r\n\'What will you do if you can\'t find the way up?\' asked Susie.\r\n\r\n\'I shall find the way up,\' he answered.\r\n\r\nThey came to the staircase once more and had discovered nothing. They\r\nlooked at one another helplessly.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s quite clear there is a way,\' said Arthur, with impatience. \'There\r\nmust be something in the nature of a hidden door somewhere or other.\'\r\n\r\nHe leaned against the balustrade and meditated. The light of his lantern\r\nthrew a narrow ray upon the opposite wall.\r\n\r\n\'I feel certain it must be in one of the rooms at the end of the house.\r\nThat seems the most natural place to put a means of ascent to the\r\nattics.\'\r\n\r\nThey went back, and again he examined the panelling of a small room that\r\nhad outside walls on three sides of it. It was the only room that did not\r\nlead into another.\r\n\r\n\'It must be here,\' he said.\r\n\r\nPresently he gave a little laugh, for he saw that a small door was\r\nconcealed by the woodwork. He pressed it where he thought there might be\r\na spring, and it flew open. Their torch showed them a narrow wooden\r\nstaircase. They walked up and found themselves in front of a door. Arthur\r\ntried it, but it was locked. He smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n\'Will you get back a little,\' he said.\r\n\r\nHe lifted his axe and swung it down upon the latch. The handle was\r\nshattered, but the lock did not yield. He shook his head. As he paused\r\nfor a moment, an there was a complete silence, Susie distinctly heard a\r\nslight noise. She put her hand on Arthur\'s arm to call his attention to\r\nit, and with strained ears they listened. There was something alive on\r\nthe other side of the door. They heard its curious sound: it was not that\r\nof a human voice, it was not the crying of an animal, it was\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nIt was the sort of gibber, hoarse and rapid, and it filled them with an\r\nicy terror because it was so weird and so unnatural.\r\n\r\n\'Come away, Arthur,\' said Susie. \'Come away.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s some living thing in there,\' he answered.\r\n\r\nHe did not know why the sound horrified him. The sweat broke out on his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\'Something awful will happen to us,\' whispered Susie, shaking with\r\nuncontrollable fear.\r\n\r\n\'The only thing is to break the door down.\'\r\n\r\nThe horrid gibbering was drowned by the noise he made. Quickly, without\r\npausing, he began to hack at the oak door with all his might. In rapid\r\nsuccession his heavy blows rained down, and the sound echoed through the\r\nempty house. There was a crash, and the door swung back. They had been so\r\nlong in almost total darkness that they were blinded for an instant by\r\nthe dazzling light. And then instinctively they started back, for, as the\r\ndoor opened, a wave of heat came out upon them so that they could hardly\r\nbreathe. The place was like an oven.\r\n\r\nThey entered. It was lit by enormous lamps, the light of which was\r\nincreased by reflectors, and warmed by a great furnace. They could not\r\nunderstand why so intense a heat was necessary. The narrow windows were\r\nclosed. Dr Porhoet caught sight of a thermometer and was astounded at the\r\ntemperature it indicated. The room was used evidently as a laboratory. On\r\nbroad tables were test-tubes, basins and baths of white porcelain,\r\nmeasuring-glasses, and utensils of all sorts; but the surprising thing\r\nwas the great scale upon which everything was. Neither Arthur nor Dr\r\nPorhoet had ever seen such gigantic measures nor such large test-tubes.\r\nThere were rows of bottles, like those in the dispensary of a hospital,\r\neach containing great quantities of a different chemical. The three\r\nfriends stood in silence. The emptiness of the room contrasted so oddly\r\nwith its appearance of being in immediate use that it was uncanny. Susie\r\nfelt that he who worked there was in the midst of his labours, and might\r\nreturn at any moment; he could have only gone for an instant into another\r\nchamber in order to see the progress of some experiment. It was quite\r\nsilent. Whatever had made those vague, unearthly noises was hushed by\r\ntheir approach.\r\n\r\nThe door was closed between this room and the next. Arthur opened it, and\r\nthey found themselves in a long, low attic, ceiled with great rafters, as\r\nbrilliantly lit and as hot as the first. Here too were broad tables laden\r\nwith retorts, instruments for heating, huge test-tubes, and all manner of\r\nvessels. The furnace that warmed it gave a steady heat. Arthur\'s gaze\r\ntravelled slowly from table to table, and he wondered what Haddo\'s\r\nexperiments had really been. The air was heavy with an extraordinary\r\nodour: it was not musty, like that of the closed rooms through which they\r\nhad passed, but singularly pungent, disagreeable and sickly. He asked\r\nhimself what it could spring from. Then his eyes fell upon a huge\r\nreceptacle that stood on the table nearest to the furnace. It was covered\r\nwith a white cloth. He took it off. The vessel was about four feet high,\r\nround, and shaped somewhat like a washing tub, but it was made of glass\r\nmore than an inch thick. In it a spherical mass, a little larger than a\r\nfootball, of a peculiar, livid colour. The surface was smooth, but rather\r\ncoarsely grained, and over it ran a dense system of blood-vessels. It\r\nreminded the two medical men of those huge tumours which are preserved in\r\nspirit in hospital museums. Susie looked at it with an incomprehensible\r\ndisgust. Suddenly she gave a cry.\r\n\r\n\'Good God, it\'s moving!\'\r\n\r\nArthur put his hand on her arm quickly to quieten her and bent down with\r\nirresistible curiosity. They saw that it was a mass of flesh unlike that\r\nof any human being; and it pulsated regularly. The movement was quite\r\ndistinct, up and down, like the delicate heaving of a woman\'s breast when\r\nshe is asleep. Arthur touched the thing with one finger and it shrank\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\n\'Its quite warm,\' he said.\r\n\r\nHe turned it over, and it remained in the position in which he had placed\r\nit, as if there were neither top nor bottom to it. But they could see\r\nnow, irregularly placed on one side, a few short hairs. They were just\r\nlike human hairs.\r\n\r\n\'Is it alive?\' whispered Susie, struck with horror and amazement.\r\n\r\n\'Yes!\'\r\n\r\nArthur seemed fascinated. He could not take his eyes off the loathsome\r\nthing. He watched it slowly heave with even motion.\r\n\r\n\'What can it mean?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Dr Porhoet with pale startled face. A thought was coming to\r\nhim, but a thought so unnatural, extravagant, and terrible that he pushed\r\nit from him with a movement of both hands, as though it were a material\r\nthing. Then all three turned around abruptly with a start, for they heard\r\nagain the wild gibbering which had first shocked their ears. In the\r\nwonder of this revolting object they had forgotten all the rest. The\r\nsound seemed extraordinarily near, and Susie drew back instinctively, for\r\nit appeared to come from her very side.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s nothing here,\' said Arthur. \'It must be in the next room.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Arthur, let us go,\' cried Susie. \'I\'m afraid to see what may be in\r\nstore for us. It is nothing to us; and what we see may poison our sleep\r\nfor ever.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked appealingly at Dr Porhoet. He was white and anxious. The heat\r\nof that place had made the sweat break out on his forehead.\r\n\r\n\'I have seen enough. I want to see no more,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Then you may go, both of you,\' answered Arthur. \'I do not wish to force\r\nyou to see anything. But I shall go on. Whatever it is, I wish to find\r\nout.\'\r\n\r\n\'But Haddo? Supposing he is there, waiting? Perhaps you are only walking\r\ninto a trap that he has set for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am convinced that Haddo is dead.\'\r\n\r\nAgain that unintelligible jargon, unhuman and shrill, fell upon their\r\nears, and Arthur stepped forward. Susie did not hesitate. She was\r\nprepared to follow him anywhere. He opened the door, and there was a\r\nsudden quiet. Whatever made those sounds was there. It was a larger room\r\nthan any on the others and much higher, for it ran along the whole front\r\nof the house. The powerful lamps showed every corner of it at once, but,\r\nabove, the beams of the open ceiling were dark with shadow. And here the\r\nnauseous odour, which had struck them before, was so overpowering that\r\nfor a while they could not go in. It was indescribably foul. Even Arthur\r\nthought it would make him sick, and he looked at the windows to see if it\r\nwas possible to open them; but it seemed they were hermetically closed.\r\nThe extreme warmth made the air more overpowering. There were four\r\nfurnaces here, and they were all alight. In order to give out more heat\r\nand to burn slowly, the fronts of them were open, and one could see that\r\nthey were filled with glowing coke.\r\n\r\nThe room was furnished no differently from the others, but to the various\r\ninstruments for chemical operations on a large scale were added all\r\nmanner of electrical appliances. Several books were lying about, and one\r\nhad been left open face downwards on the edge of a table. But what\r\nimmediately attracted their attention was a row of those large glass\r\nvessels like that which they had seen in the adjoining room. Each was\r\ncovered with a white cloth. They hesitated a moment, for they knew that\r\nhere they were face to face with the great enigma. At last Arthur pulled\r\naway the cloth from one. None of them spoke. They stared with astonished\r\neyes. For here, too, was a strange mass of flesh, almost as large as a\r\nnew-born child, but there was in it the beginnings of something ghastly\r\nhuman. It was shaped vaguely like an infant, but the legs were joined\r\ntogether so that it looked like a mummy rolled up in its coverings.\r\nThere were neither feet nor knees. The trunk was formless, but there\r\nwas a curious thickening on each side; it was as if a modeller had meant\r\nto make a figure with the arms loosely bent, but had left the work\r\nunfinished so that they were still one with the body. There was something\r\nthat resembled a human head, covered with long golden hair, but it was\r\nhorrible; it was an uncouth mass, without eyes or nose or mouth. The\r\ncolour was a kind of sickly pink, and it was almost transparent. There\r\nwas a very slight movement in it, rhythmical and slow. It was living too.\r\n\r\nThen quickly Arthur removed the covering from all the other jars but one;\r\nand in a flash of the eyes they saw abominations so awful that Susie had\r\nto clench her fists in order not to scream. There was one monstrous thing\r\nin which the limbs approached nearly to the human. It was extraordinarily\r\nheaped up, with fat tiny arms, little bloated legs, and an absurd squat\r\nbody, so that it looked like a Chinese mandarin in porcelain. In another\r\nthe trunk was almost like that of a human child, except that it was\r\npatched strangely with red and grey. But the terror of it was that\r\nat the neck it branched hideously, and there were two distinct heads,\r\nmonstrously large, but duly provided with all their features. The\r\nfeatures were a caricature of humanity so shameful that one could hardly\r\nbear to look. And as the light fell on it, the eyes of each head opened\r\nslowly. They had no pigment in them, but were pink, like the eyes of\r\nwhite rabbits; and they stared for a moment with an odd, unseeing glance.\r\nThen they were shut again, and what was curiously terrifying was that the\r\nmovements were not quite simultaneous; the eyelids of one head fell\r\nslowly just before those of the other. And in another place was a ghastly\r\nmonster in which it seemed that two bodies had been dreadfully entangled\r\nwith one another. It was a creature of nightmare, with four arms and four\r\nlegs, and this one actually moved. With a peculiar motion it crawled\r\nalong the bottom of the great receptacle in which it was kept, towards\r\nthe three persons who looked at it. It seemed to wonder what they did.\r\nSusie started back with fright, as it raised itself on its four legs and\r\ntried to reach up to them.\r\n\r\nSusie turned away and hid her face. She could not look at those ghastly\r\ncounterfeits of humanity. She was terrified and ashamed.\r\n\r\n\'Do you understand what this means?\' said Dr Porhoet to Arthur, in an\r\nawed voice. \'It means that he has discovered the secret of life.\'\r\n\r\n\'Was it for these vile monstrosities that Margaret was sacrificed in all\r\nher loveliness?\'\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at one another with sad, wondering eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you remember that he talked of the manufacture of human beings?\r\nIt\'s these misshapen things that he\'s succeeding in producing,\' said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\'There is one more that we haven\'t seen,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the covering which still hid the largest of the vases. He\r\nhad a feeling that it contained the most fearful of all these monsters;\r\nand it was not without an effort that he drew the cloth away. But no\r\nsooner had he done this than something sprang up, so that instinctively\r\nhe started back, and it began to gibber in piercing tones. These were the\r\nunearthly sounds that they had heard. It was not a voice, it was a kind\r\nof raucous crying, hoarse yet shrill, uneven like the barking of a dog,\r\nand appalling. The sounds came forth in rapid succession, angrily, as\r\nthough the being that uttered them sought to express itself in furious\r\nwords. It was mad with passion and beat against the glass walls of its\r\nprison with clenched fists. For the hands were human hands, and the\r\nbody, though much larger, was of the shape of a new-born child. The\r\ncreature must have stood about four feet high. The head was horribly\r\nmisshapen. The skull was enormous, smooth and distended like that of a\r\nhydrocephalic, and the forehead protruded over the face hideously. The\r\nfeatures were almost unformed, preternaturally small under the great,\r\noverhanging brow; and they had an expression of fiendish malignity.\r\n\r\nThe tiny, misshapen countenance writhed with convulsive fury, and from\r\nthe mouth poured out a foaming spume. It raised its voice higher and\r\nhigher, shrieking senseless gibberish in its rage. Then it began to hurl\r\nits whole body madly against the glass walls and to beat its head. It\r\nappeared to have a sudden incomprehensible hatred for the three\r\nstrangers. It was trying to fly at them. The toothless gums moved\r\nspasmodically, and it threw its face into horrible grimaces. That\r\nnameless, loathsome abortion was the nearest that Oliver Haddo had\r\ncome to the human form.\r\n\r\n\'Come away,\' said Arthur. \'We must not look at this.\'\r\n\r\nHe quickly flung the covering over the jar.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, for God\'s sake let us go,\' said Susie.\r\n\r\n\'We haven\'t done yet,\' answered Arthur. \'We haven\'t found the author of\r\nall this.\'\r\n\r\nHe looked at the room in which they were, but there was no door except\r\nthat by which they had entered. Then he uttered a startled cry, and\r\nstepping forward fell on his knee.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the long tables heaped up with instruments, hidden\r\nso that at first they had not seen him, Oliver Haddo lay on the floor,\r\ndead. His blue eyes were staring wide, and they seemed larger than they\r\nhad ever been. They kept still the expression of terror which they had\r\nworn in the moment of his agony, and his heavy face was distorted with\r\ndeadly fear. It was purple and dark, and the eyes were injected with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n\'He died of suffocation,\' whispered Dr Porhoet.\r\n\r\nArthur pointed to the neck. There could be seen on it distinctly the\r\nmarks of the avenging fingers that had strangled the life out of him. It\r\nwas impossible to hesitate.\r\n\r\n\'I told you that I had killed him,\' said Arthur.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered something more. He took hold of the right arm. He was\r\nconvinced that it had been broken during that desperate struggle in the\r\ndarkness. He felt it carefully and listened. He heard plainly the two\r\nparts of the bone rub against one another. The dead man\'s arm was broken\r\njust in the place where he had broken it. Arthur stood up. He took one\r\nlast look at his enemy. That vast mass of flesh lay heaped up on the\r\nfloor in horrible disorder.\r\n\r\n\'Now that you have seen, will you come away?\' said Susie, interrupting\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe words seemed to bring him suddenly to himself.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, we must go quickly.\'\r\n\r\nThey turned away and with hurried steps walked through those bright\r\nattics till they came to the stairs.\r\n\r\n\'Now go down and wait for me at the door,\' said Arthur. \'I will follow\r\nyou immediately.\'\r\n\r\n\'What are you going to do?\' asked Susie.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind. Do as I tell you. I have not finished here yet.\'\r\n\r\nThey went down the great oak staircase and waited in the hall. They\r\nwondered what Arthur was about. Presently he came running down.\r\n\r\n\'Be quick!\' he cried. \'We have no time to lose.\'\r\n\r\n\'What have you done, Arthur?\'\r\n\r\nThere\'s no time to tell you now.\'\r\n\r\nHe hurried them out and slammed the door behind him. He took Susie\'s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\'Now we must run. Come.\'\r\n\r\nShe did not know what his haste signified, but her heart beat furiously.\r\nHe dragged her along. Dr Porhoet hurried on behind them. Arthur plunged\r\ninto the wood. He would not leave them time to breathe.\r\n\r\n\'You must be quick,\' he said.\r\n\r\nAt last they came to the opening in the fence, and he helped them to get\r\nthrough. Then he carefully replaced the wooden paling and, taking Susie\'s\r\narm began to walk rapidly towards their inn.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m frightfully tired,\' she said. \'I simply can\'t go so fast.\'\r\n\r\n\'You must. Presently you can rest as long as you like.\'\r\n\r\nThey walked very quickly for a while. Now and then Arthur looked back.\r\nThe night was still quite dark, and the stars shone out in their myriads.\r\nAt last he slackened their pace.\r\n\r\n\'Now you can go more slowly,\' he said.\r\n\r\nSusie saw the smiling glance that he gave her. His eyes were full of\r\ntenderness. He put his arm affectionately round her shoulders to support\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid you\'re quite exhausted, poor thing,\' he said. \'I\'m sorry to\r\nhave had to hustle you so much.\'\r\n\r\n\'It doesn\'t matter at all.\'\r\n\r\nShe leaned against him comfortably. With that protecting arm about her,\r\nshe felt capable of any fatigue. Dr Porhoet stopped.\r\n\r\n\'You must really let me roll myself a cigarette,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'You may do whatever you like,\' answered Arthur.\r\n\r\nThere was a different ring in his voice now, and it was soft with a\r\ngood-humour that they had not heard in it for many months. He appeared\r\nsingularly relieved. Susie was ready to forget the terrible past and\r\ngive herself over to the happiness that seemed at last in store for her.\r\nThey began to saunter slowly on. And now they could take pleasure in the\r\nexquisite night. The air was very suave, odorous with the heather that\r\nwas all about them, and there was an enchanting peace in that scene which\r\nwonderfully soothed their weariness. It was dark still, but they knew the\r\ndawn was at hand, and Susie rejoiced in the approaching day. In the east\r\nthe azure of the night began to thin away into pale amethyst, and the\r\ntrees seemed gradually to stand out from the darkness in a ghostly\r\nbeauty. Suddenly birds began to sing all around them in a splendid\r\nchorus. From their feet a lark sprang up with a rustle of wings and,\r\nmounting proudly upon the air, chanted blithe canticles to greet the\r\nmorning. They stood upon a little hill.\r\n\r\n\'Let us wait here and see the sun rise,\' said Susie.\r\n\r\n\'As you will.\'\r\n\r\nThey stood all three of them, and Susie took in deep, joyful breaths of\r\nthe sweet air of dawn. The whole land, spread at her feet, was clothed in\r\nthe purple dimness that heralds day, and she exulted in its beauty. But\r\nshe noticed that Arthur, unlike herself and Dr Porhoet, did not look\r\ntoward the east. His eyes were fixed steadily upon the place from which\r\nthey had come. What did he look for in the darkness of the west? She\r\nturned round, and a cry broke from her lips, for the shadows there were\r\nlurid with a deep red glow.\r\n\r\n\'It looks like a fire,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'It is. Skene is burning like tinder.\'\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke it seemed that the roof fell in, for suddenly vast flames\r\nsprang up, rising high into the still night air; and they saw that the\r\nhouse they had just left was blazing furiously. It was a magnificent\r\nsight from the distant hill on which they stood to watch the fire as it\r\nsoared and sank, as it shot scarlet tongues along like strange Titanic\r\nmonsters, as it raged from room to room. Skene was burning. It was beyond\r\nthe reach of human help. In a little while there would be no trace of all\r\nthose crimes and all those horrors. Now it was one mass of flame. It\r\nlooked like some primeval furnace, where the gods might work unheard-of\r\nmiracles.\r\n\r\n\'Arthur, what have you done?\' asked Susie, in a tone that was hardly\r\naudible.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer directly. He put his arm about her shoulder again, so\r\nthat she was obliged to turn round.\r\n\r\n\'Look, the sun is rising.\'\r\n\r\nIn the east, a long ray of light climbed up the sky, and the sun, yellow\r\nand round, appeared upon the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Magician, by Somerset Maugham\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAGICIAN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 14257.txt or 14257.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/2/5/14257/\r\n\r\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, Mary Meehan and the PG Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
