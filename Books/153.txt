The scheme was jotted down in 1890, from notes made in 1887\r\nand onward, some of the circumstances being suggested by the death of a\r\nwoman in the former year. The scenes were revisited in October, 1892;\r\nthe narrative was written in outline in 1892 and the spring of 1893,\r\nand at full length, as it now appears, from August, 1893, onward into\r\nthe next year; the whole, with the exception of a few chapters, being\r\nin the hands of the publisher by the end of 1894. It was begun as a\r\nserial story in HARPER\xe2\x80\x99S MAGAZINE at the end of November, 1894, and was\r\ncontinued in monthly parts.\r\n\r\nBut, as in the case of _Tess of the D\xe2\x80\x99Urbervilles_, the magazine\r\nversion was, for various reasons, abridged and modified in some degree,\r\nthe present edition being the first in which the whole appears as\r\noriginally written. And in the difficulty of coming to an early\r\ndecision in the matter of a title, the tale was issued under a\r\nprovisional name\xe2\x80\x94two such titles having, in fact, been successively\r\nadopted. The present and final title, deemed on the whole the best, was\r\none of the earliest thought of.\r\n\r\nFor a novel addressed by a man to men and women of full age, which\r\nattempts to deal unaffectedly with the fret and fever, derision and\r\ndisaster, that may press in the wake of the strongest passion known to\r\nhumanity, and to point, without a mincing of words, the tragedy of\r\nunfulfilled aims, I am not aware that there is anything in the handling\r\nto which exception can be taken.\r\n\r\nLike former productions of this pen, _Jude the Obscure_ is simply an\r\nendeavor to give shape and coherence to a series of seemings, or\r\npersonal impressions, the question of their consistency or their\r\ndiscordance, of their permanence or their transitoriness, being\r\nregarded as not of the first moment.\r\n\r\nT.H.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August_, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart First AT MARYGREEN\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cYea, many there be that have run out of their wits for women, and\r\nbecome servants for their sakes. Many also have perished, have erred,\r\nand sinned, for women\xe2\x80\xa6 O ye men, how can it be but women should be\r\nstrong, seeing they do thus?\xe2\x80\x9d_\xe2\x80\x94ESDRAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster was leaving the village, and everybody seemed sorry.\r\nThe miller at Cresscombe lent him the small white tilted cart and horse\r\nto carry his goods to the city of his destination, about twenty miles\r\noff, such a vehicle proving of quite sufficient size for the departing\r\nteacher\xe2\x80\x99s effects. For the schoolhouse had been partly furnished by the\r\nmanagers, and the only cumbersome article possessed by the master, in\r\naddition to the packing-case of books, was a cottage piano that he had\r\nbought at an auction during the year in which he thought of learning\r\ninstrumental music. But the enthusiasm having waned he had never\r\nacquired any skill in playing, and the purchased article had been a\r\nperpetual trouble to him ever since in moving house.\r\n\r\nThe rector had gone away for the day, being a man who disliked the\r\nsight of changes. He did not mean to return till the evening, when the\r\nnew school-teacher would have arrived and settled in, and everything\r\nwould be smooth again.\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith, the farm bailiff, and the schoolmaster himself were\r\nstanding in perplexed attitudes in the parlour before the instrument.\r\nThe master had remarked that even if he got it into the cart he should\r\nnot know what to do with it on his arrival at Christminster, the city\r\nhe was bound for, since he was only going into temporary lodgings just\r\nat first.\r\n\r\nA little boy of eleven, who had been thoughtfully assisting in the\r\npacking, joined the group of men, and as they rubbed their chins he\r\nspoke up, blushing at the sound of his own voice: \xe2\x80\x9cAunt have got a\r\ngreat fuel-house, and it could be put there, perhaps, till you\xe2\x80\x99ve found\r\na place to settle in, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA proper good notion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the blacksmith.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that a deputation should wait on the boy\xe2\x80\x99s aunt\xe2\x80\x94an old\r\nmaiden resident\xe2\x80\x94and ask her if she would house the piano till Mr.\r\nPhillotson should send for it. The smith and the bailiff started to see\r\nabout the practicability of the suggested shelter, and the boy and the\r\nschoolmaster were left standing alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry I am going, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the latter kindly.\r\n\r\nTears rose into the boy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, for he was not among the regular day\r\nscholars, who came unromantically close to the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s life, but\r\none who had attended the night school only during the present teacher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nterm of office. The regular scholars, if the truth must be told, stood\r\nat the present moment afar off, like certain historic disciples,\r\nindisposed to any enthusiastic volunteering of aid.\r\n\r\nThe boy awkwardly opened the book he held in his hand, which Mr.\r\nPhillotson had bestowed on him as a parting gift, and admitted that he\r\nwas sorry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Phillotson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you go, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94that would be a long story. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand my reasons,\r\nJude. You will, perhaps, when you are older.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I should now, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of this everywhere. You know what a university is,\r\nand a university degree? It is the necessary hallmark of a man who\r\nwants to do anything in teaching. My scheme, or dream, is to be a\r\nuniversity graduate, and then to be ordained. By going to live at\r\nChristminster, or near it, I shall be at headquarters, so to speak, and\r\nif my scheme is practicable at all, I consider that being on the spot\r\nwill afford me a better chance of carrying it out than I should have\r\nelsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe smith and his companion returned. Old Miss Fawley\xe2\x80\x99s fuel-house was\r\ndry, and eminently practicable; and she seemed willing to give the\r\ninstrument standing-room there. It was accordingly left in the school\r\ntill the evening, when more hands would be available for removing it;\r\nand the schoolmaster gave a final glance round.\r\n\r\nThe boy Jude assisted in loading some small articles, and at nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock Mr. Phillotson mounted beside his box of books and other\r\n_impedimenta_, and bade his friends good-bye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t forget you, Jude,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling, as the cart moved off.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe a good boy, remember; and be kind to animals and birds, and read\r\nall you can. And if ever you come to Christminster remember you hunt me\r\nout for old acquaintance\xe2\x80\x99 sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cart creaked across the green, and disappeared round the corner by\r\nthe rectory-house. The boy returned to the draw-well at the edge of the\r\ngreensward, where he had left his buckets when he went to help his\r\npatron and teacher in the loading. There was a quiver in his lip now\r\nand after opening the well-cover to begin lowering the bucket he paused\r\nand leant with his forehead and arms against the framework, his face\r\nwearing the fixity of a thoughtful child\xe2\x80\x99s who has felt the pricks of\r\nlife somewhat before his time. The well into which he was looking was\r\nas ancient as the village itself, and from his present position\r\nappeared as a long circular perspective ending in a shining disk of\r\nquivering water at a distance of a hundred feet down. There was a\r\nlining of green moss near the top, and nearer still the hart\xe2\x80\x99s-tongue\r\nfern.\r\n\r\nHe said to himself, in the melodramatic tones of a whimsical boy, that\r\nthe schoolmaster had drawn at that well scores of times on a morning\r\nlike this, and would never draw there any more. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him look\r\ndown into it, when he was tired with his drawing, just as I do now, and\r\nwhen he rested a bit before carrying the buckets home! But he was too\r\nclever to bide here any longer\xe2\x80\x94a small sleepy place like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tear rolled from his eye into the depths of the well. The morning was\r\na little foggy, and the boy\xe2\x80\x99s breathing unfurled itself as a thicker\r\nfog upon the still and heavy air. His thoughts were interrupted by a\r\nsudden outcry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring on that water, will ye, you idle young harlican!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt came from an old woman who had emerged from her door towards the\r\ngarden gate of a green-thatched cottage not far off. The boy quickly\r\nwaved a signal of assent, drew the water with what was a great effort\r\nfor one of his stature, landed and emptied the big bucket into his own\r\npair of smaller ones, and pausing a moment for breath, started with\r\nthem across the patch of clammy greensward whereon the well\r\nstood\xe2\x80\x94nearly in the centre of the little village, or rather hamlet of\r\nMarygreen.\r\n\r\nIt was as old-fashioned as it was small, and it rested in the lap of an\r\nundulating upland adjoining the North Wessex downs. Old as it was,\r\nhowever, the well-shaft was probably the only relic of the local\r\nhistory that remained absolutely unchanged. Many of the thatched and\r\ndormered dwelling-houses had been pulled down of late years, and many\r\ntrees felled on the green. Above all, the original church, hump-backed,\r\nwood-turreted, and quaintly hipped, had been taken down, and either\r\ncracked up into heaps of road-metal in the lane, or utilized as pig-sty\r\nwalls, garden seats, guard-stones to fences, and rockeries in the\r\nflower-beds of the neighbourhood. In place of it a tall new building of\r\nmodern Gothic design, unfamiliar to English eyes, had been erected on a\r\nnew piece of ground by a certain obliterator of historic records who\r\nhad run down from London and back in a day. The site whereon so long\r\nhad stood the ancient temple to the Christian divinities was not even\r\nrecorded on the green and level grass-plot that had immemorially been\r\nthe churchyard, the obliterated graves being commemorated by\r\neighteen-penny cast-iron crosses warranted to last five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nSlender as was Jude Fawley\xe2\x80\x99s frame he bore the two brimming\r\nhouse-buckets of water to the cottage without resting. Over the door\r\nwas a little rectangular piece of blue board, on which was painted in\r\nyellow letters, \xe2\x80\x9cDrusilla Fawley, Baker.\xe2\x80\x9d Within the little lead panes\r\nof the window\xe2\x80\x94this being one of the few old houses left\xe2\x80\x94were five\r\nbottles of sweets, and three buns on a plate of the willow pattern.\r\n\r\nWhile emptying the buckets at the back of the house he could hear an\r\nanimated conversation in progress within-doors between his great-aunt,\r\nthe Drusilla of the sign-board, and some other villagers. Having seen\r\nthe school-master depart, they were summing up particulars of the\r\nevent, and indulging in predictions of his future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who\xe2\x80\x99s he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one, comparatively a stranger, when the boy\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell ye med ask it, Mrs. Williams. He\xe2\x80\x99s my great-nephew\xe2\x80\x94come since you\r\nwas last this way.\xe2\x80\x9d The old inhabitant who answered was a tall, gaunt\r\nwoman, who spoke tragically on the most trivial subject, and gave a\r\nphrase of her conversation to each auditor in turn. \xe2\x80\x9cHe come from\r\nMellstock, down in South Wessex, about a year ago\xe2\x80\x94worse luck for \xe2\x80\x99n,\r\nBelinda\xe2\x80\x9d (turning to the right) \xe2\x80\x9cwhere his father was living, and was\r\ntook wi\xe2\x80\x99 the shakings for death, and died in two days, as you know,\r\nCaroline\xe2\x80\x9d (turning to the left). \xe2\x80\x9cIt would ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a blessing if\r\nGoddy-mighty had took thee too, wi\xe2\x80\x99 thy mother and father, poor useless\r\nboy! But I\xe2\x80\x99ve got him here to stay with me till I can see what\xe2\x80\x99s to be\r\ndone with un, though I am obliged to let him earn any penny he can.\r\nJust now he\xe2\x80\x99s a-scaring of birds for Farmer Troutham. It keeps him out\r\nof mischty. Why do ye turn away, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, as the boy,\r\nfeeling the impact of their glances like slaps upon his face, moved\r\naside.\r\n\r\nThe local washerwoman replied that it was perhaps a very good plan of\r\nMiss or Mrs. Fawley\xe2\x80\x99s (as they called her indifferently) to have him\r\nwith her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto kip \xe2\x80\x99ee company in your loneliness, fetch water, shet the\r\nwinder-shetters o\xe2\x80\x99 nights, and help in the bit o\xe2\x80\x99 baking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Fawley doubted it. \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t ye get the schoolmaster to take\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee to Christminster wi\xe2\x80\x99 un, and make a scholar of \xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued,\r\nin frowning pleasantry. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 took a better one.\r\nThe boy is crazy for books, that he is. It runs in our family rather.\r\nHis cousin Sue is just the same\xe2\x80\x94so I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard; but I have not seen the\r\nchild for years, though she was born in this place, within these four\r\nwalls, as it happened. My niece and her husband, after they were\r\nmarried, didn\xe2\x80\x99 get a house of their own for some year or more; and then\r\nthey only had one till\xe2\x80\x94Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go into that. Jude, my child,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you ever marry. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t for the Fawleys to take that step any\r\nmore. She, their only one, was like a child o\xe2\x80\x99 my own, Belinda, till\r\nthe split come! Ah, that a little maid should know such changes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude, finding the general attention again centering on himself, went\r\nout to the bakehouse, where he ate the cake provided for his breakfast.\r\nThe end of his spare time had now arrived, and emerging from the garden\r\nby getting over the hedge at the back he pursued a path northward, till\r\nhe came to a wide and lonely depression in the general level of the\r\nupland, which was sown as a corn-field. This vast concave was the scene\r\nof his labours for Mr. Troutham the farmer, and he descended into the\r\nmidst of it.\r\n\r\nThe brown surface of the field went right up towards the sky all round,\r\nwhere it was lost by degrees in the mist that shut out the actual verge\r\nand accentuated the solitude. The only marks on the uniformity of the\r\nscene were a rick of last year\xe2\x80\x99s produce standing in the midst of the\r\narable, the rooks that rose at his approach, and the path athwart the\r\nfallow by which he had come, trodden now by he hardly knew whom, though\r\nonce by many of his own dead family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow ugly it is here!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nThe fresh harrow-lines seemed to stretch like the channellings in a\r\npiece of new corduroy, lending a meanly utilitarian air to the expanse,\r\ntaking away its gradations, and depriving it of all history beyond that\r\nof the few recent months, though to every clod and stone there really\r\nattached associations enough and to spare\xe2\x80\x94echoes of songs from ancient\r\nharvest-days, of spoken words, and of sturdy deeds. Every inch of\r\nground had been the site, first or last, of energy, gaiety, horse-play,\r\nbickerings, weariness. Groups of gleaners had squatted in the sun on\r\nevery square yard. Love-matches that had populated the adjoining hamlet\r\nhad been made up there between reaping and carrying. Under the hedge\r\nwhich divided the field from a distant plantation girls had given\r\nthemselves to lovers who would not turn their heads to look at them by\r\nthe next harvest; and in that ancient cornfield many a man had made\r\nlove-promises to a woman at whose voice he had trembled by the next\r\nseed-time after fulfilling them in the church adjoining. But this\r\nneither Jude nor the rooks around him considered. For them it was a\r\nlonely place, possessing, in the one view, only the quality of a\r\nwork-ground, and in the other that of a granary good to feed in.\r\n\r\nThe boy stood under the rick before mentioned, and every few seconds\r\nused his clacker or rattle briskly. At each clack the rooks left off\r\npecking, and rose and went away on their leisurely wings, burnished\r\nlike tassets of mail, afterwards wheeling back and regarding him\r\nwarily, and descending to feed at a more respectful distance.\r\n\r\nHe sounded the clacker till his arm ached, and at length his heart grew\r\nsympathetic with the birds\xe2\x80\x99 thwarted desires. They seemed, like\r\nhimself, to be living in a world which did not want them. Why should he\r\nfrighten them away? They took upon more and more the aspect of gentle\r\nfriends and pensioners\xe2\x80\x94the only friends he could claim as being in the\r\nleast degree interested in him, for his aunt had often told him that\r\nshe was not. He ceased his rattling, and they alighted anew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little dears!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _shall_ have some\r\ndinner\xe2\x80\x94you shall. There is enough for us all. Farmer Troutham can\r\nafford to let you have some. Eat, then my dear little birdies, and make\r\na good meal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stayed and ate, inky spots on the nut-brown soil, and Jude enjoyed\r\ntheir appetite. A magic thread of fellow-feeling united his own life\r\nwith theirs. Puny and sorry as those lives were, they much resembled\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nHis clacker he had by this time thrown away from him, as being a mean\r\nand sordid instrument, offensive both to the birds and to himself as\r\ntheir friend. All at once he became conscious of a smart blow upon his\r\nbuttocks, followed by a loud clack, which announced to his surprised\r\nsenses that the clacker had been the instrument of offence used. The\r\nbirds and Jude started up simultaneously, and the dazed eyes of the\r\nlatter beheld the farmer in person, the great Troutham himself, his red\r\nface glaring down upon Jude\xe2\x80\x99s cowering frame, the clacker swinging in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Eat my dear birdies,\xe2\x80\x99 is it, young man? \xe2\x80\x98Eat, dear birdies,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nindeed! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tickle your breeches, and see if you say, \xe2\x80\x98Eat, dear\r\nbirdies,\xe2\x80\x99 again in a hurry! And you\xe2\x80\x99ve been idling at the\r\nschoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s too, instead of coming here, ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t ye, hey? That\xe2\x80\x99s how\r\nyou earn your sixpence a day for keeping the rooks off my corn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhilst saluting Jude\xe2\x80\x99s ears with this impassioned rhetoric, Troutham\r\nhad seized his left hand with his own left, and swinging his slim frame\r\nround him at arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length, again struck Jude on the hind parts with the\r\nflat side of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s own rattle, till the field echoed with the blows,\r\nwhich were delivered once or twice at each revolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ee, sir\xe2\x80\x94please don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the whirling child, as\r\nhelpless under the centrifugal tendency of his person as a hooked fish\r\nswinging to land, and beholding the hill, the rick, the plantation, the\r\npath, and the rooks going round and round him in an amazing circular\r\nrace. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I sir\xe2\x80\x94only meant that\xe2\x80\x94there was a good crop in the ground\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsaw \xe2\x80\x99em sow it\xe2\x80\x94and the rooks could have a little bit for dinner\xe2\x80\x94and you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss it, sir\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Phillotson said I was to be kind to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94oh, oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis truthful explanation seemed to exasperate the farmer even more\r\nthan if Jude had stoutly denied saying anything at all, and he still\r\nsmacked the whirling urchin, the clacks of the instrument continuing to\r\nresound all across the field and as far as the ears of distant\r\nworkers\xe2\x80\x94who gathered thereupon that Jude was pursuing his business of\r\nclacking with great assiduity\xe2\x80\x94and echoing from the brand-new church\r\ntower just behind the mist, towards the building of which structure the\r\nfarmer had largely subscribed, to testify his love for God and man.\r\n\r\nPresently Troutham grew tired of his punitive task, and depositing the\r\nquivering boy on his legs, took a sixpence from his pocket and gave it\r\nhim in payment for his day\xe2\x80\x99s work, telling him to go home and never let\r\nhim see him in one of those fields again.\r\n\r\nJude leaped out of arm\xe2\x80\x99s reach, and walked along the trackway\r\nweeping\xe2\x80\x94not from the pain, though that was keen enough; not from the\r\nperception of the flaw in the terrestrial scheme, by which what was\r\ngood for God\xe2\x80\x99s birds was bad for God\xe2\x80\x99s gardener; but with the awful\r\nsense that he had wholly disgraced himself before he had been a year in\r\nthe parish, and hence might be a burden to his great-aunt for life.\r\n\r\nWith this shadow on his mind he did not care to show himself in the\r\nvillage, and went homeward by a roundabout track behind a high hedge\r\nand across a pasture. Here he beheld scores of coupled earthworms lying\r\nhalf their length on the surface of the damp ground, as they always did\r\nin such weather at that time of the year. It was impossible to advance\r\nin regular steps without crushing some of them at each tread.\r\n\r\nThough Farmer Troutham had just hurt him, he was a boy who could not\r\nhimself bear to hurt anything. He had never brought home a nest of\r\nyoung birds without lying awake in misery half the night after, and\r\noften reinstating them and the nest in their original place the next\r\nmorning. He could scarcely bear to see trees cut down or lopped, from a\r\nfancy that it hurt them; and late pruning, when the sap was up and the\r\ntree bled profusely, had been a positive grief to him in his infancy.\r\nThis weakness of character, as it may be called, suggested that he was\r\nthe sort of man who was born to ache a good deal before the fall of the\r\ncurtain upon his unnecessary life should signify that all was well with\r\nhim again. He carefully picked his way on tiptoe among the earthworms,\r\nwithout killing a single one.\r\n\r\nOn entering the cottage he found his aunt selling a penny loaf to a\r\nlittle girl, and when the customer was gone she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how do you\r\ncome to be back here in the middle of the morning like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m turned away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Troutham have turned me away because I let the rooks have a few\r\npeckings of corn. And there\xe2\x80\x99s my wages\xe2\x80\x94the last I shall ever hae!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw the sixpence tragically on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said his aunt, suspending her breath. And she opened upon him a\r\nlecture on how she would now have him all the spring upon her hands\r\ndoing nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t skeer birds, what can ye do? There! don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nye look so deedy! Farmer Troutham is not so much better than myself,\r\ncome to that. But \xe2\x80\x99tis as Job said, \xe2\x80\x98Now they that are younger than I\r\nhave me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set\r\nwith the dogs of my flock.\xe2\x80\x99 His father was my father\xe2\x80\x99s journeyman,\r\nanyhow, and I must have been a fool to let \xe2\x80\x99ee go to work for \xe2\x80\x99n, which\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 done but to keep \xe2\x80\x99ee out of mischty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore angry with Jude for demeaning her by coming there than for\r\ndereliction of duty, she rated him primarily from that point of view,\r\nand only secondarily from a moral one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that you should have let the birds eat what Farmer Troutham\r\nplanted. Of course you was wrong in that. Jude, Jude, why didstn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\noff with that schoolmaster of thine to Christminster or somewhere? But,\r\noh no\xe2\x80\x94poor or\xe2\x80\x99nary child\xe2\x80\x94there never was any sprawl on thy side of the\r\nfamily, and never will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is this beautiful city, Aunt\xe2\x80\x94this place where Mr. Phillotson is\r\ngone to?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the boy, after meditating in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord! you ought to know where the city of Christminster is. Near a\r\nscore of miles from here. It is a place much too good for you ever to\r\nhave much to do with, poor boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m a-thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will Mr. Phillotson always be there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I go to see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, no! You didn\xe2\x80\x99t grow up hereabout, or you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask such as\r\nthat. We\xe2\x80\x99ve never had anything to do with folk in Christminster, nor\r\nfolk in Christminster with we.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude went out, and, feeling more than ever his existence to be an\r\nundemanded one, he lay down upon his back on a heap of litter near the\r\npig-sty. The fog had by this time become more translucent, and the\r\nposition of the sun could be seen through it. He pulled his straw hat\r\nover his face, and peered through the interstices of the plaiting at\r\nthe white brightness, vaguely reflecting. Growing up brought\r\nresponsibilities, he found. Events did not rhyme quite as he had\r\nthought. Nature\xe2\x80\x99s logic was too horrid for him to care for. That mercy\r\ntowards one set of creatures was cruelty towards another sickened his\r\nsense of harmony. As you got older, and felt yourself to be at the\r\ncentre of your time, and not at a point in its circumference, as you\r\nhad felt when you were little, you were seized with a sort of\r\nshuddering, he perceived. All around you there seemed to be something\r\nglaring, garish, rattling, and the noises and glares hit upon the\r\nlittle cell called your life, and shook it, and warped it.\r\n\r\nIf he could only prevent himself growing up! He did not want to be a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThen, like the natural boy, he forgot his despondency, and sprang up.\r\nDuring the remainder of the morning he helped his aunt, and in the\r\nafternoon, when there was nothing more to be done, he went into the\r\nvillage. Here he asked a man whereabouts Christminster lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristminster? Oh, well, out by there yonder; though I\xe2\x80\x99ve never bin\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94not I. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had any business at such a place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man pointed north-eastward, in the very direction where lay that\r\nfield in which Jude had so disgraced himself. There was something\r\nunpleasant about the coincidence for the moment, but the fearsomeness\r\nof this fact rather increased his curiosity about the city. The farmer\r\nhad said he was never to be seen in that field again; yet Christminster\r\nlay across it, and the path was a public one. So, stealing out of the\r\nhamlet, he descended into the same hollow which had witnessed his\r\npunishment in the morning, never swerving an inch from the path, and\r\nclimbing up the long and tedious ascent on the other side till the\r\ntrack joined the highway by a little clump of trees. Here the ploughed\r\nland ended, and all before him was bleak open down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a soul was visible on the hedgeless highway, or on either side of\r\nit, and the white road seemed to ascend and diminish till it joined the\r\nsky. At the very top it was crossed at right angles by a green\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cridgeway\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Ickneild Street and original Roman road through the\r\ndistrict. This ancient track ran east and west for many miles, and down\r\nalmost to within living memory had been used for driving flocks and\r\nherds to fairs and markets. But it was now neglected and overgrown.\r\n\r\nThe boy had never before strayed so far north as this from the nestling\r\nhamlet in which he had been deposited by the carrier from a railway\r\nstation southward, one dark evening some few months earlier, and till\r\nnow he had had no suspicion that such a wide, flat, low-lying country\r\nlay so near at hand, under the very verge of his upland world. The\r\nwhole northern semicircle between east and west, to a distance of forty\r\nor fifty miles, spread itself before him; a bluer, moister atmosphere,\r\nevidently, than that he breathed up here.\r\n\r\nNot far from the road stood a weather-beaten old barn of reddish-grey\r\nbrick and tile. It was known as the Brown House by the people of the\r\nlocality. He was about to pass it when he perceived a ladder against\r\nthe eaves; and the reflection that the higher he got, the further he\r\ncould see, led Jude to stand and regard it. On the slope of the roof\r\ntwo men were repairing the tiling. He turned into the ridgeway and drew\r\ntowards the barn.\r\n\r\nWhen he had wistfully watched the workmen for some time he took\r\ncourage, and ascended the ladder till he stood beside them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my lad, and what may you want up here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to know where the city of Christminster is, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristminster is out across there, by that clump. You can see it\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast you can on a clear day. Ah, no, you can\xe2\x80\x99t now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other tiler, glad of any kind of diversion from the monotony of his\r\nlabour, had also turned to look towards the quarter designated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t often see it in weather like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe time I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnoticed it is when the sun is going down in a blaze of flame, and it\r\nlooks like\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe heavenly Jerusalem,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the serious urchin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94though I should never ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought of it myself. \xe2\x80\xa6 But I can\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nno Christminster to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy strained his eyes also; yet neither could he see the far-off\r\ncity. He descended from the barn, and abandoning Christminster with the\r\nversatility of his age he walked along the ridge-track, looking for any\r\nnatural objects of interest that might lie in the banks thereabout.\r\nWhen he repassed the barn to go back to Marygreen he observed that the\r\nladder was still in its place, but that the men had finished their\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work and gone away.\r\n\r\nIt was waning towards evening; there was still a faint mist, but it had\r\ncleared a little except in the damper tracts of subjacent country and\r\nalong the river-courses. He thought again of Christminster, and wished,\r\nsince he had come two or three miles from his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house on purpose,\r\nthat he could have seen for once this attractive city of which he had\r\nbeen told. But even if he waited here it was hardly likely that the air\r\nwould clear before night. Yet he was loth to leave the spot, for the\r\nnorthern expanse became lost to view on retreating towards the village\r\nonly a few hundred yards.\r\n\r\nHe ascended the ladder to have one more look at the point the men had\r\ndesignated, and perched himself on the highest rung, overlying the\r\ntiles. He might not be able to come so far as this for many days.\r\nPerhaps if he prayed, the wish to see Christminster might be forwarded.\r\nPeople said that, if you prayed, things sometimes came to you, even\r\nthough they sometimes did not. He had read in a tract that a man who\r\nhad begun to build a church, and had no money to finish it, knelt down\r\nand prayed, and the money came in by the next post. Another man tried\r\nthe same experiment, and the money did not come; but he found\r\nafterwards that the breeches he knelt in were made by a wicked Jew.\r\nThis was not discouraging, and turning on the ladder Jude knelt on the\r\nthird rung, where, resting against those above it, he prayed that the\r\nmist might rise.\r\n\r\nHe then seated himself again, and waited. In the course of ten or\r\nfifteen minutes the thinning mist dissolved altogether from the\r\nnorthern horizon, as it had already done elsewhere, and about a quarter\r\nof an hour before the time of sunset the westward clouds parted, the\r\nsun\xe2\x80\x99s position being partially uncovered, and the beams streaming out\r\nin visible lines between two bars of slaty cloud. The boy immediately\r\nlooked back in the old direction.\r\n\r\nSome way within the limits of the stretch of landscape, points of light\r\nlike the topaz gleamed. The air increased in transparency with the\r\nlapse of minutes, till the topaz points showed themselves to be the\r\nvanes, windows, wet roof slates, and other shining spots upon the\r\nspires, domes, freestone-work, and varied outlines that were faintly\r\nrevealed. It was Christminster, unquestionably; either directly seen,\r\nor miraged in the peculiar atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe spectator gazed on and on till the windows and vanes lost their\r\nshine, going out almost suddenly like extinguished candles. The vague\r\ncity became veiled in mist. Turning to the west, he saw that the sun\r\nhad disappeared. The foreground of the scene had grown funereally dark,\r\nand near objects put on the hues and shapes of chimaeras.\r\n\r\nHe anxiously descended the ladder, and started homewards at a run,\r\ntrying not to think of giants, Herne the Hunter, Apollyon lying in wait\r\nfor Christian, or of the captain with the bleeding hole in his forehead\r\nand the corpses round him that remutinied every night on board the\r\nbewitched ship. He knew that he had grown out of belief in these\r\nhorrors, yet he was glad when he saw the church tower and the lights in\r\nthe cottage windows, even though this was not the home of his birth,\r\nand his great-aunt did not care much about him.\r\n\r\n\r\nInside and round about that old woman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cshop\xe2\x80\x9d window, with its\r\ntwenty-four little panes set in lead-work, the glass of some of them\r\noxidized with age, so that you could hardly see the poor penny articles\r\nexhibited within, and forming part of a stock which a strong man could\r\nhave carried, Jude had his outer being for some long tideless time. But\r\nhis dreams were as gigantic as his surroundings were small.\r\n\r\nThrough the solid barrier of cold cretaceous upland to the northward he\r\nwas always beholding a gorgeous city\xe2\x80\x94the fancied place he had likened\r\nto the new Jerusalem, though there was perhaps more of the painter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination and less of the diamond merchant\xe2\x80\x99s in his dreams thereof\r\nthan in those of the Apocalyptic writer. And the city acquired a\r\ntangibility, a permanence, a hold on his life, mainly from the one\r\nnucleus of fact that the man for whose knowledge and purposes he had so\r\nmuch reverence was actually living there; not only so, but living among\r\nthe more thoughtful and mentally shining ones therein.\r\n\r\nIn sad wet seasons, though he knew it must rain at Christminster too,\r\nhe could hardly believe that it rained so drearily there. Whenever he\r\ncould get away from the confines of the hamlet for an hour or two,\r\nwhich was not often, he would steal off to the Brown House on the hill\r\nand strain his eyes persistently; sometimes to be rewarded by the sight\r\nof a dome or spire, at other times by a little smoke, which in his\r\nestimate had some of the mysticism of incense.\r\n\r\nThen the day came when it suddenly occurred to him that if he ascended\r\nto the point of view after dark, or possibly went a mile or two\r\nfurther, he would see the night lights of the city. It would be\r\nnecessary to come back alone, but even that consideration did not deter\r\nhim, for he could throw a little manliness into his mood, no doubt.\r\n\r\nThe project was duly executed. It was not late when he arrived at the\r\nplace of outlook, only just after dusk, but a black north-east sky,\r\naccompanied by a wind from the same quarter, made the occasion dark\r\nenough. He was rewarded; but what he saw was not the lamps in rows, as\r\nhe had half expected. No individual light was visible, only a halo or\r\nglow-fog over-arching the place against the black heavens behind it,\r\nmaking the light and the city seem distant but a mile or so.\r\n\r\nHe set himself to wonder on the exact point in the glow where the\r\nschoolmaster might be\xe2\x80\x94he who never communicated with anybody at\r\nMarygreen now; who was as if dead to them here. In the glow he seemed\r\nto see Phillotson promenading at ease, like one of the forms in\r\nNebuchadnezzar\xe2\x80\x99s furnace.\r\n\r\nHe had heard that breezes travelled at the rate of ten miles an hour,\r\nand the fact now came into his mind. He parted his lips as he faced the\r\nnorth-east, and drew in the wind as if it were a sweet liquor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing the breeze caressingly \xe2\x80\x9cwere in\r\nChristminster city between one and two hours ago, floating along the\r\nstreets, pulling round the weather-cocks, touching Mr. Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, being breathed by him; and now you are here, breathed by me\xe2\x80\x94you,\r\nthe very same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came along this wind something towards him\xe2\x80\x94a message\r\nfrom the place\xe2\x80\x94from some soul residing there, it seemed. Surely it was\r\nthe sound of bells, the voice of the city, faint and musical, calling\r\nto him, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are happy here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had become entirely lost to his bodily situation during this mental\r\nleap, and only got back to it by a rough recalling. A few yards below\r\nthe brow of the hill on which he paused a team of horses made its\r\nappearance, having reached the place by dint of half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nserpentine progress from the bottom of the immense declivity. They had\r\na load of coals behind them\xe2\x80\x94a fuel that could only be got into the\r\nupland by this particular route. They were accompanied by a carter, a\r\nsecond man, and a boy, who now kicked a large stone behind one of the\r\nwheels, and allowed the panting animals to have a long rest, while\r\nthose in charge took a flagon off the load and indulged in a drink\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThey were elderly men, and had genial voices. Jude addressed them,\r\ninquiring if they had come from Christminster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid, with this load!\xe2\x80\x9d said they.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place I mean is that one yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d He was getting so romantically\r\nattached to Christminster that, like a young lover alluding to his\r\nmistress, he felt bashful at mentioning its name again. He pointed to\r\nthe light in the sky\xe2\x80\x94hardly perceptible to their older eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. There do seem a spot a bit brighter in the nor\xe2\x80\x99-east than\r\nelsewhere, though I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 noticed it myself, and no doubt it\r\nmed be Christminster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere a little book of tales which Jude had tucked up under his arm,\r\nhaving brought them to read on his way hither before it grew dark,\r\nslipped and fell into the road. The carter eyed him while he picked it\r\nup and straightened the leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d have to get your head screwed on\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other way before you could read what they read there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they never look at anything that folks like we can understand,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe carter continued, by way of passing the time. \xe2\x80\x9cOn\xe2\x80\x99y foreign tongues\r\nused in the days of the Tower of Babel, when no two families spoke\r\nalike. They read that sort of thing as fast as a night-hawk will whir.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis all learning there\xe2\x80\x94nothing but learning, except religion. And\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s learning too, for I never could understand it. Yes, \xe2\x80\x99tis a\r\nserious-minded place. Not but there\xe2\x80\x99s wenches in the streets o\xe2\x80\x99 nights\xe2\x80\xa6\r\nYou know, I suppose, that they raise pa\xe2\x80\x99sons there like radishes in a\r\nbed? And though it do take\xe2\x80\x94how many years, Bob?\xe2\x80\x94five years to turn a\r\nlirruping hobble-de-hoy chap into a solemn preaching man with no\r\ncorrupt passions, they\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, if it can be done, and polish un off\r\nlike the workmen they be, and turn un out wi\xe2\x80\x99 a long face, and a long\r\nblack coat and waistcoat, and a religious collar and hat, same as they\r\nused to wear in the Scriptures, so that his own mother wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know un\r\nsometimes. \xe2\x80\xa6 There, \xe2\x80\x99tis their business, like anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how should you know\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t you interrupt, my boy. Never interrupt your senyers. Move\r\nthe fore hoss aside, Bobby; here\xe2\x80\x99s som\xe2\x80\x99at coming\xe2\x80\xa6 You must mind that I\r\nbe a-talking of the college life. \xe2\x80\x99Em lives on a lofty level; there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno gainsaying it, though I myself med not think much of \xe2\x80\x99em. As we be\r\nhere in our bodies on this high ground, so be they in their\r\nminds\xe2\x80\x94noble-minded men enough, no doubt\xe2\x80\x94some on \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94able to earn\r\nhundreds by thinking out loud. And some on \xe2\x80\x99em be strong young fellows\r\nthat can earn a\xe2\x80\x99most as much in silver cups. As for music, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeautiful music everywhere in Christminster. You med be religious, or\r\nyou med not, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t help striking in your homely note with the\r\nrest. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a street in the place\xe2\x80\x94the main street\xe2\x80\x94that ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanother like it in the world. I should think I did know a little about\r\nChristminster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the horses had recovered breath and bent to their collars\r\nagain. Jude, throwing a last adoring look at the distant halo, turned\r\nand walked beside his remarkably well-informed friend, who had no\r\nobjection to telling him as they moved on more yet of the city\xe2\x80\x94its\r\ntowers and halls and churches. The waggon turned into a cross-road,\r\nwhereupon Jude thanked the carter warmly for his information, and said\r\nhe only wished he could talk half as well about Christminster as he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99tis oonly what has come in my way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the carter\r\nunboastfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been there, no more than you; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve picked\r\nup the knowledge here and there, and you be welcome to it. A-getting\r\nabout the world as I do, and mixing with all classes of society, one\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help hearing of things. A friend o\xe2\x80\x99 mine, that used to clane the\r\nboots at the Crozier Hotel in Christminster when he was in his prime,\r\nwhy, I knowed un as well as my own brother in his later years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude continued his walk homeward alone, pondering so deeply that he\r\nforgot to feel timid. He suddenly grew older. It had been the yearning\r\nof his heart to find something to anchor on, to cling to\xe2\x80\x94for some place\r\nwhich he could call admirable. Should he find that place in this city\r\nif he could get there? Would it be a spot in which, without fear of\r\nfarmers, or hindrance, or ridicule, he could watch and wait, and set\r\nhimself to some mighty undertaking like the men of old of whom he had\r\nheard? As the halo had been to his eyes when gazing at it a quarter of\r\nan hour earlier, so was the spot mentally to him as he pursued his dark\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a city of light,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tree of knowledge grows there,\xe2\x80\x9d he added a few steps further on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a place that teachers of men spring from and go to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is what you may call a castle, manned by scholarship and religion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this figure he was silent a long while, till he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would just suit me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWalking somewhat slowly by reason of his concentration, the boy\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nancient man in some phases of thought, much younger than his years in\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x94was overtaken by a light-footed pedestrian, whom,\r\nnotwithstanding the gloom, he could perceive to be wearing an\r\nextraordinarily tall hat, a swallow-tailed coat, and a watch-chain that\r\ndanced madly and threw around scintillations of sky-light as its owner\r\nswung along upon a pair of thin legs and noiseless boots. Jude,\r\nbeginning to feel lonely, endeavoured to keep up with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my man! I\xe2\x80\x99m in a hurry, so you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to walk pretty fast if\r\nyou keep alongside of me. Do you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think. Physician Vilbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m known everywhere, I see! That comes of being a public\r\nbenefactor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilbert was an itinerant quack-doctor, well known to the rustic\r\npopulation, and absolutely unknown to anybody else, as he, indeed, took\r\ncare to be, to avoid inconvenient investigations. Cottagers formed his\r\nonly patients, and his Wessex-wide repute was among them alone. His\r\nposition was humbler and his field more obscure than those of the\r\nquacks with capital and an organized system of advertising. He was, in\r\nfact, a survival. The distances he traversed on foot were enormous, and\r\nextended nearly the whole length and breadth of Wessex. Jude had one\r\nday seen him selling a pot of coloured lard to an old woman as a\r\ncertain cure for a bad leg, the woman arranging to pay a guinea, in\r\ninstalments of a shilling a fortnight, for the precious salve, which,\r\naccording to the physician, could only be obtained from a particular\r\nanimal which grazed on Mount Sinai, and was to be captured only at\r\ngreat risk to life and limb. Jude, though he already had his doubts\r\nabout this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s medicines, felt him to be unquestionably a\r\ntravelled personage, and one who might be a trustworthy source of\r\ninformation on matters not strictly professional.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI s\xe2\x80\x99pose you\xe2\x80\x99ve been to Christminster, Physician?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have\xe2\x80\x94many times,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the long thin man. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of my\r\ncentres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful city for scholarship and religion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d say so, my boy, if you\xe2\x80\x99d seen it. Why, the very sons of the old\r\nwomen who do the washing of the colleges can talk in Latin\xe2\x80\x94not good\r\nLatin, that I admit, as a critic: dog-Latin\xe2\x80\x94cat-Latin, as we used to\r\ncall it in my undergraduate days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Greek?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s more for the men who are in training for bishops, that\r\nthey may be able to read the New Testament in the original.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to learn Latin and Greek myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lofty desire. You must get a grammar of each tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to go to Christminster some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you do, you say that Physician Vilbert is the only proprietor\r\nof those celebrated pills that infallibly cure all disorders of the\r\nalimentary system, as well as asthma and shortness of breath. Two and\r\nthreepence a box\xe2\x80\x94specially licensed by the government stamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you get me the grammars if I promise to say it hereabout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sell you mine with pleasure\xe2\x80\x94those I used as a student.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank you, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude gratefully, but in gasps, for the\r\namazing speed of the physician\xe2\x80\x99s walk kept him in a dog-trot which was\r\ngiving him a stitch in the side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99d better drop behind, my young man. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you the grammars, and give you a first lesson, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll remember, at every house in the village, to recommend Physician\r\nVilbert\xe2\x80\x99s golden ointment, life-drops, and female pills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will you be with the grammars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be passing here this day fortnight at precisely this hour of\r\nfive-and-twenty minutes past seven. My movements are as truly timed as\r\nthose of the planets in their courses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I\xe2\x80\x99ll be to meet you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith orders for my medicines?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Physician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude then dropped behind, waited a few minutes to recover breath, and\r\nwent home with a consciousness of having struck a blow for\r\nChristminster.\r\n\r\nThrough the intervening fortnight he ran about and smiled outwardly at\r\nhis inward thoughts, as if they were people meeting and nodding to\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94smiled with that singularly beautiful irradiation which is seen to\r\nspread on young faces at the inception of some glorious idea, as if a\r\nsupernatural lamp were held inside their transparent natures, giving\r\nrise to the flattering fancy that heaven lies about them then.\r\n\r\nHe honestly performed his promise to the man of many cures, in whom he\r\nnow sincerely believed, walking miles hither and thither among the\r\nsurrounding hamlets as the Physician\xe2\x80\x99s agent in advance. On the evening\r\nappointed he stood motionless on the plateau, at the place where he had\r\nparted from Vilbert, and there awaited his approach. The road-physician\r\nwas fairly up to time; but, to the surprise of Jude on striking into\r\nhis pace, which the pedestrian did not diminish by a single unit of\r\nforce, the latter seemed hardly to recognize his young companion,\r\nthough with the lapse of the fortnight the evenings had grown light.\r\nJude thought it might perhaps be owing to his wearing another hat, and\r\nhe saluted the physician with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter abstractedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? who are you? Oh yes\xe2\x80\x94to be sure! Got any orders, lad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d And Jude told him the names and addresses of the cottagers who\r\nwere willing to test the virtues of the world-renowned pills and salve.\r\nThe quack mentally registered these with great care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Latin and Greek grammars?\xe2\x80\x9d Jude\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were to bring me yours, that you used before you took your\r\ndegree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, yes! Forgot all about it\xe2\x80\x94all! So many lives depending on my\r\nattention, you see, my man, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t give so much thought as I\r\nwould like to other things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude controlled himself sufficiently long to make sure of the truth;\r\nand he repeated, in a voice of dry misery, \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But you must get me some more orders from sick people, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbring the grammars next time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude dropped behind. He was an unsophisticated boy, but the gift of\r\nsudden insight which is sometimes vouchsafed to children showed him all\r\nat once what shoddy humanity the quack was made of. There was to be no\r\nintellectual light from this source. The leaves dropped from his\r\nimaginary crown of laurel; he turned to a gate, leant against it, and\r\ncried bitterly.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment was followed by an interval of blankness. He might,\r\nperhaps, have obtained grammars from Alfredston, but to do that\r\nrequired money, and a knowledge of what books to order; and though\r\nphysically comfortable, he was in such absolute dependence as to be\r\nwithout a farthing of his own.\r\n\r\nAt this date Mr. Phillotson sent for his pianoforte, and it gave Jude a\r\nlead. Why should he not write to the schoolmaster, and ask him to be so\r\nkind as to get him the grammars in Christminster? He might slip a\r\nletter inside the case of the instrument, and it would be sure to reach\r\nthe desired eyes. Why not ask him to send any old second-hand copies,\r\nwhich would have the charm of being mellowed by the university\r\natmosphere?\r\n\r\nTo tell his aunt of his intention would be to defeat it. It was\r\nnecessary to act alone.\r\n\r\nAfter a further consideration of a few days he did act, and on the day\r\nof the piano\xe2\x80\x99s departure, which happened to be his next birthday,\r\nclandestinely placed the letter inside the packing-case, directed to\r\nhis much-admired friend, being afraid to reveal the operation to his\r\naunt Drusilla, lest she should discover his motive, and compel him to\r\nabandon his scheme.\r\n\r\nThe piano was despatched, and Jude waited days and weeks, calling every\r\nmorning at the cottage post office before his great-aunt was stirring.\r\nAt last a packet did indeed arrive at the village, and he saw from the\r\nends of it that it contained two thin books. He took it away into a\r\nlonely place, and sat down on a felled elm to open it.\r\n\r\nEver since his first ecstasy or vision of Christminster and its\r\npossibilities, Jude had meditated much and curiously on the probable\r\nsort of process that was involved in turning the expressions of one\r\nlanguage into those of another. He concluded that a grammar of the\r\nrequired tongue would contain, primarily, a rule, prescription, or clue\r\nof the nature of a secret cipher, which, once known, would enable him,\r\nby merely applying it, to change at will all words of his own speech\r\ninto those of the foreign one. His childish idea was, in fact, a\r\npushing to the extremity of mathematical precision what is everywhere\r\nknown as Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s Law\xe2\x80\x94an aggrandizement of rough rules to ideal\r\ncompleteness. Thus he assumed that the words of the required language\r\nwere always to be found somewhere latent in the words of the given\r\nlanguage by those who had the art to uncover them, such art being\r\nfurnished by the books aforesaid.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, having noted that the packet bore the postmark of\r\nChristminster, he cut the string, opened the volumes, and turned to the\r\nLatin grammar, which chanced to come uppermost, he could scarcely\r\nbelieve his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe book was an old one\xe2\x80\x94thirty years old, soiled, scribbled wantonly\r\nover with a strange name in every variety of enmity to the letterpress,\r\nand marked at random with dates twenty years earlier than his own day.\r\nBut this was not the cause of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s amazement. He learnt for the first\r\ntime that there was no law of transmutation, as in his innocence he had\r\nsupposed (there was, in some degree, but the grammarian did not\r\nrecognize it), but that every word in both Latin and Greek was to be\r\nindividually committed to memory at the cost of years of plodding.\r\n\r\nJude flung down the books, lay backward along the broad trunk of the\r\nelm, and was an utterly miserable boy for the space of a quarter of an\r\nhour. As he had often done before, he pulled his hat over his face and\r\nwatched the sun peering insidiously at him through the interstices of\r\nthe straw. This was Latin and Greek, then, was it this grand delusion!\r\nThe charm he had supposed in store for him was really a labour like\r\nthat of Israel in Egypt.\r\n\r\nWhat brains they must have in Christminster and the great schools, he\r\npresently thought, to learn words one by one up to tens of thousands!\r\nThere were no brains in his head equal to this business; and as the\r\nlittle sun-rays continued to stream in through his hat at him, he\r\nwished he had never seen a book, that he might never see another, that\r\nhe had never been born.\r\n\r\nSomebody might have come along that way who would have asked him his\r\ntrouble, and might have cheered him by saying that his notions were\r\nfurther advanced than those of his grammarian. But nobody did come,\r\nbecause nobody does; and under the crushing recognition of his gigantic\r\nerror Jude continued to wish himself out of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the three or four succeeding years a quaint and singular vehicle\r\nmight have been discerned moving along the lanes and by-roads near\r\nMarygreen, driven in a quaint and singular way.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a month or two after the receipt of the books Jude had\r\ngrown callous to the shabby trick played him by the dead languages. In\r\nfact, his disappointment at the nature of those tongues had, after a\r\nwhile, been the means of still further glorifying the erudition of\r\nChristminster. To acquire languages, departed or living in spite of\r\nsuch obstinacies as he now knew them inherently to possess, was a\r\nherculean performance which gradually led him on to a greater interest\r\nin it than in the presupposed patent process. The mountain-weight of\r\nmaterial under which the ideas lay in those dusty volumes called the\r\nclassics piqued him into a dogged, mouselike subtlety of attempt to\r\nmove it piecemeal.\r\n\r\nHe had endeavoured to make his presence tolerable to his crusty maiden\r\naunt by assisting her to the best of his ability, and the business of\r\nthe little cottage bakery had grown in consequence. An aged horse with\r\na hanging head had been purchased for eight pounds at a sale, a\r\ncreaking cart with a whity-brown tilt obtained for a few pounds more,\r\nand in this turn-out it became Jude\xe2\x80\x99s business thrice a week to carry\r\nloaves of bread to the villagers and solitary cotters immediately round\r\nMarygreen.\r\n\r\nThe singularity aforesaid lay, after all, less in the conveyance itself\r\nthan in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s manner of conducting it along its route. Its interior\r\nwas the scene of most of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s education by \xe2\x80\x9cprivate study.\xe2\x80\x9d As soon\r\nas the horse had learnt the road and the houses at which he was to\r\npause awhile, the boy, seated in front, would slip the reins over his\r\narm, ingeniously fix open, by means of a strap attached to the tilt,\r\nthe volume he was reading, spread the dictionary on his knees, and\r\nplunge into the simpler passages from Caesar, Virgil, or Horace, as the\r\ncase might be, in his purblind stumbling way, and with an expenditure\r\nof labour that would have made a tender-hearted pedagogue shed tears;\r\nyet somehow getting at the meaning of what he read, and divining rather\r\nthan beholding the spirit of the original, which often to his mind was\r\nsomething else than that which he was taught to look for.\r\n\r\nThe only copies he had been able to lay hands on were old Delphin\r\neditions, because they were superseded, and therefore cheap. But, bad\r\nfor idle schoolboys, it did so happen that they were passably good for\r\nhim. The hampered and lonely itinerant conscientiously covered up the\r\nmarginal readings, and used them merely on points of construction, as\r\nhe would have used a comrade or tutor who should have happened to be\r\npassing by. And though Jude may have had little chance of becoming a\r\nscholar by these rough and ready means, he was in the way of getting\r\ninto the groove he wished to follow.\r\n\r\nWhile he was busied with these ancient pages, which had already been\r\nthumbed by hands possibly in the grave, digging out the thoughts of\r\nthese minds so remote yet so near, the bony old horse pursued his\r\nrounds, and Jude would be aroused from the woes of Dido by the stoppage\r\nof his cart and the voice of some old woman crying, \xe2\x80\x9cTwo to-day, baker,\r\nand I return this stale one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was frequently met in the lanes by pedestrians and others without\r\nhis seeing them, and by degrees the people of the neighbourhood began\r\nto talk about his method of combining work and play (such they\r\nconsidered his reading to be), which, though probably convenient enough\r\nto himself, was not altogether a safe proceeding for other travellers\r\nalong the same roads. There were murmurs. Then a private resident of an\r\nadjoining place informed the local policeman that the baker\xe2\x80\x99s boy\r\nshould not be allowed to read while driving, and insisted that it was\r\nthe constable\xe2\x80\x99s duty to catch him in the act, and take him to the\r\npolice court at Alfredston, and get him fined for dangerous practices\r\non the highway. The policeman thereupon lay in wait for Jude, and one\r\nday accosted him and cautioned him.\r\n\r\nAs Jude had to get up at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning to heat the oven,\r\nand mix and set in the bread that he distributed later in the day, he\r\nwas obliged to go to bed at night immediately after laying the sponge;\r\nso that if he could not read his classics on the highways he could\r\nhardly study at all. The only thing to be done was, therefore, to keep\r\na sharp eye ahead and around him as well as he could in the\r\ncircumstances, and slip away his books as soon as anybody loomed in the\r\ndistance, the policeman in particular. To do that official justice, he\r\ndid not put himself much in the way of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s bread-cart, considering\r\nthat in such a lonely district the chief danger was to Jude himself,\r\nand often on seeing the white tilt over the hedges he would move in\r\nanother direction.\r\n\r\nOn a day when Fawley was getting quite advanced, being now about\r\nsixteen, and had been stumbling through the \xe2\x80\x9cCarmen S\xc3\xa6culare,\xe2\x80\x9d on his\r\nway home, he found himself to be passing over the high edge of the\r\nplateau by the Brown House. The light had changed, and it was the sense\r\nof this which had caused him to look up. The sun was going down, and\r\nthe full moon was rising simultaneously behind the woods in the\r\nopposite quarter. His mind had become so impregnated with the poem\r\nthat, in a moment of the same impulsive emotion which years before had\r\ncaused him to kneel on the ladder, he stopped the horse, alighted, and\r\nglancing round to see that nobody was in sight, knelt down on the\r\nroadside bank with open book. He turned first to the shiny goddess, who\r\nseemed to look so softly and critically at his doings, then to the\r\ndisappearing luminary on the other hand, as he began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPh\xc5\x93be silvarumque potens Diana!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horse stood still till he had finished the hymn, which Jude\r\nrepeated under the sway of a polytheistic fancy that he would never\r\nhave thought of humouring in broad daylight.\r\n\r\nReaching home, he mused over his curious superstition, innate or\r\nacquired, in doing this, and the strange forgetfulness which had led to\r\nsuch a lapse from common sense and custom in one who wished, next to\r\nbeing a scholar, to be a Christian divine. It had all come of reading\r\nheathen works exclusively. The more he thought of it the more convinced\r\nhe was of his inconsistency. He began to wonder whether he could be\r\nreading quite the right books for his object in life. Certainly there\r\nseemed little harmony between this pagan literature and the medi\xc3\xa6val\r\ncolleges at Christminster, that ecclesiastical romance in stone.\r\n\r\nUltimately he decided that in his sheer love of reading he had taken up\r\na wrong emotion for a Christian young man. He had dabbled in Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHomer, but had never yet worked much at the New Testament in the Greek,\r\nthough he possessed a copy, obtained by post from a second-hand\r\nbookseller. He abandoned the now familiar Ionic for a new dialect, and\r\nfor a long time onward limited his reading almost entirely to the\r\nGospels and Epistles in Griesbach\xe2\x80\x99s text. Moreover, on going into\r\nAlfredston one day, he was introduced to patristic literature by\r\nfinding at the bookseller\xe2\x80\x99s some volumes of the Fathers which had been\r\nleft behind by an insolvent clergyman of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAs another outcome of this change of groove he visited on Sundays all\r\nthe churches within a walk, and deciphered the Latin inscriptions on\r\nfifteenth-century brasses and tombs. On one of these pilgrimages he met\r\nwith a hunch-backed old woman of great intelligence, who read\r\neverything she could lay her hands on, and she told him more yet of the\r\nromantic charms of the city of light and lore. Thither he resolved as\r\nfirmly as ever to go.\r\n\r\nBut how live in that city? At present he had no income at all. He had\r\nno trade or calling of any dignity or stability whatever on which he\r\ncould subsist while carrying out an intellectual labour which might\r\nspread over many years.\r\n\r\nWhat was most required by citizens? Food, clothing, and shelter. An\r\nincome from any work in preparing the first would be too meagre; for\r\nmaking the second he felt a distaste; the preparation of the third\r\nrequisite he inclined to. They built in a city; therefore he would\r\nlearn to build. He thought of his unknown uncle, his cousin Susanna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather, an ecclesiastical worker in metal, and somehow medi\xc3\xa6val art in\r\nany material was a trade for which he had rather a fancy. He could not\r\ngo far wrong in following his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps, and engaging himself\r\nawhile with the carcases that contained the scholar souls.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary he obtained some small blocks of freestone, metal not\r\nbeing available, and suspending his studies awhile, occupied his spare\r\nhalf-hours in copying the heads and capitals in his parish church.\r\n\r\nThere was a stone-mason of a humble kind in Alfredston, and as soon as\r\nhe had found a substitute for himself in his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s little business, he\r\noffered his services to this man for a trifling wage. Here Jude had the\r\nopportunity of learning at least the rudiments of freestone-working.\r\nSome time later he went to a church-builder in the same place, and\r\nunder the architect\xe2\x80\x99s direction became handy at restoring the\r\ndilapidated masonries of several village churches round about.\r\n\r\nNot forgetting that he was only following up this handicraft as a prop\r\nto lean on while he prepared those greater engines which he flattered\r\nhimself would be better fitted for him, he yet was interested in his\r\npursuit on its own account. He now had lodgings during the week in the\r\nlittle town, whence he returned to Marygreen village every Saturday\r\nevening. And thus he reached and passed his nineteenth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this memorable date of his life he was, one Saturday, returning from\r\nAlfredston to Marygreen about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon. It was\r\nfine, warm, and soft summer weather, and he walked with his tools at\r\nhis back, his little chisels clinking faintly against the larger ones\r\nin his basket. It being the end of the week he had left work early, and\r\nhad come out of the town by a round-about route which he did not\r\nusually frequent, having promised to call at a flour-mill near\r\nCresscombe to execute a commission for his aunt.\r\n\r\nHe was in an enthusiastic mood. He seemed to see his way to living\r\ncomfortably in Christminster in the course of a year or two, and\r\nknocking at the doors of one of those strongholds of learning of which\r\nhe had dreamed so much. He might, of course, have gone there now, in\r\nsome capacity or other, but he preferred to enter the city with a\r\nlittle more assurance as to means than he could be said to feel at\r\npresent. A warm self-content suffused him when he considered what he\r\nhad already done. Now and then as he went along he turned to face the\r\npeeps of country on either side of him. But he hardly saw them; the act\r\nwas an automatic repetition of what he had been accustomed to do when\r\nless occupied; and the one matter which really engaged him was the\r\nmental estimate of his progress thus far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have acquired quite an average student\xe2\x80\x99s power to read the common\r\nancient classics, Latin in particular.\xe2\x80\x9d This was true, Jude possessing\r\na facility in that language which enabled him with great ease to\r\nhimself to beguile his lonely walks by imaginary conversations therein.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have read two books of the _Iliad_, besides being pretty familiar\r\nwith passages such as the speech of Ph\xc5\x93nix in the ninth book, the fight\r\nof Hector and Ajax in the fourteenth, the appearance of Achilles\r\nunarmed and his heavenly armour in the eighteenth, and the funeral\r\ngames in the twenty-third. I have also done some Hesiod, a little scrap\r\nof Thucydides, and a lot of the Greek Testament\xe2\x80\xa6 I wish there was only\r\none dialect all the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done some mathematics, including the first six and the eleventh\r\nand twelfth books of Euclid; and algebra as far as simple equations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know something of the Fathers, and something of Roman and English\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese things are only a beginning. But I shall not make much farther\r\nadvance here, from the difficulty of getting books. Hence I must next\r\nconcentrate all my energies on settling in Christminster. Once there I\r\nshall so advance, with the assistance I shall there get, that my\r\npresent knowledge will appear to me but as childish ignorance. I must\r\nsave money, and I will; and one of those colleges shall open its doors\r\nto me\xe2\x80\x94shall welcome whom now it would spurn, if I wait twenty years for\r\nthe welcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be D.D. before I have done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he continued to dream, and thought he might become even a\r\nbishop by leading a pure, energetic, wise, Christian life. And what an\r\nexample he would set! If his income were \xc2\xa35000 a year, he would give\r\naway \xc2\xa34500 in one form and another, and live sumptuously (for him) on\r\nthe remainder. Well, on second thoughts, a bishop was absurd. He would\r\ndraw the line at an archdeacon. Perhaps a man could be as good and as\r\nlearned and as useful in the capacity of archdeacon as in that of\r\nbishop. Yet he thought of the bishop again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile I will read, as soon as I am settled in Christminster, the\r\nbooks I have not been able to get hold of here: Livy, Tacitus,\r\nHerodotus, \xc3\x86schylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha! Hoity-toity!\xe2\x80\x9d The sounds were expressed in light voices on\r\nthe other side of the hedge, but he did not notice them. His thoughts\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Euripides, Plato, Aristotle, Lucretius, Epictetus, Seneca, Antoninus.\r\nThen I must master other things: the Fathers thoroughly; Bede and\r\necclesiastical history generally; a smattering of Hebrew\xe2\x80\x94I only know\r\nthe letters as yet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoity-toity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94but I can work hard. I have staying power in abundance, thank God!\r\nand it is that which tells\xe2\x80\xa6 Yes, Christminster shall be my Alma Mater;\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll be her beloved son, in whom she shall be well pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his deep concentration on these transactions of the future Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalk had slackened, and he was now standing quite still, looking at the\r\nground as though the future were thrown thereon by a magic lantern. On\r\na sudden something smacked him sharply in the ear, and he became aware\r\nthat a soft cold substance had been flung at him, and had fallen at his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nA glance told him what it was\xe2\x80\x94a piece of flesh, the characteristic part\r\nof a barrow-pig, which the countrymen used for greasing their boots, as\r\nit was useless for any other purpose. Pigs were rather plentiful\r\nhereabout, being bred and fattened in large numbers in certain parts of\r\nNorth Wessex.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the hedge was a stream, whence, as he now for the\r\nfirst time realized, had come the slight sounds of voices and laughter\r\nthat had mingled with his dreams. He mounted the bank and looked over\r\nthe fence. On the further side of the stream stood a small homestead,\r\nhaving a garden and pig-sties attached; in front of it, beside the\r\nbrook, three young women were kneeling, with buckets and platters\r\nbeside them containing heaps of pigs\xe2\x80\x99 chitterlings, which they were\r\nwashing in the running water. One or two pairs of eyes slyly glanced\r\nup, and perceiving that his attention had at last been attracted, and\r\nthat he was watching them, they braced themselves for inspection by\r\nputting their mouths demurely into shape and recommencing their rinsing\r\noperations with assiduity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude severely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ throw it, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d asserted one girl to her neighbour,\r\nas if unconscious of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I,\xe2\x80\x9d the second answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anny, how can you!\xe2\x80\x9d said the third.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had thrown anything at all, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been _that_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for him!\xe2\x80\x9d And they laughed and continued their\r\nwork, without looking up, still ostentatiously accusing each other.\r\n\r\nJude grew sarcastic as he wiped his face, and caught their remarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it\xe2\x80\x94oh no!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the up-stream one of the three.\r\n\r\nShe whom he addressed was a fine dark-eyed girl, not exactly handsome,\r\nbut capable of passing as such at a little distance, despite some\r\ncoarseness of skin and fibre. She had a round and prominent bosom, full\r\nlips, perfect teeth, and the rich complexion of a Cochin hen\xe2\x80\x99s egg. She\r\nwas a complete and substantial female animal\xe2\x80\x94no more, no less; and Jude\r\nwas almost certain that to her was attributable the enterprise of\r\nattracting his attention from dreams of the humaner letters to what was\r\nsimmering in the minds around him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you\xe2\x80\x99ll never be told,\xe2\x80\x9d said she deedily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever did it was wasteful of other people\xe2\x80\x99s property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you want to speak to me, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; if you like to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I clamber across, or will you come to the plank above here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps she foresaw an opportunity; for somehow or other the eyes of\r\nthe brown girl rested in his own when he had said the words, and there\r\nwas a momentary flash of intelligence, a dumb announcement of affinity\r\n_in posse_ between herself and him, which, so far as Jude Fawley was\r\nconcerned, had no sort of premeditation in it. She saw that he had\r\nsingled her out from the three, as a woman is singled out in such\r\ncases, for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance, but in\r\ncommonplace obedience to conjunctive orders from headquarters,\r\nunconsciously received by unfortunate men when the last intention of\r\ntheir lives is to be occupied with the feminine.\r\n\r\nSpringing to her feet, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cBring back what is lying there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude was now aware that no message on any matter connected with her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s business had prompted her signal to him. He set down his\r\nbasket of tools, picked up the scrap of offal, beat a pathway for\r\nhimself with his stick, and got over the hedge. They walked in parallel\r\nlines, one on each bank of the stream, towards the small plank bridge.\r\nAs the girl drew nearer to it, she gave without Jude perceiving it, an\r\nadroit little suck to the interior of each of her cheeks in succession,\r\nby which curious and original man\xc5\x93uvre she brought as by magic upon its\r\nsmooth and rotund surface a perfect dimple, which she was able to\r\nretain there as long as she continued to smile. This production of\r\ndimples at will was a not unknown operation, which many attempted, but\r\nonly a few succeeded in accomplishing.\r\n\r\nThey met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her\r\nmissile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously\r\nstopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him.\r\n\r\nBut she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards\r\nand forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till,\r\nmoved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think _I_ would shy things at you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are doing this for my father, who naturally doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want anything\r\nthrown away. He makes that into dubbin.\xe2\x80\x9d She nodded towards the\r\nfragment on the grass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made either of the others throw it, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d Jude asked,\r\npolitely accepting her assertion, though he had very large doubts as to\r\nits truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpudence. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell folk it was I, mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know your name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no. Shall I tell it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArabella Donn. I\xe2\x80\x99m living here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have known it if I had often come this way. But I mostly go\r\nstraight along the high-road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father is a pig-breeder, and these girls are helping me wash the\r\ninnerds for black-puddings and such like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding\r\neach other and leaning against the hand-rail of the bridge. The\r\nunvoiced call of woman to man, which was uttered very distinctly by\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s personality, held Jude to the spot against his\r\nintention\xe2\x80\x94almost against his will, and in a way new to his experience.\r\nIt is scarcely an exaggeration to say that till this moment Jude had\r\nnever looked at a woman to consider her as such, but had vaguely\r\nregarded the sex as beings outside his life and purposes. He gazed from\r\nher eyes to her mouth, thence to her bosom, and to her full round naked\r\narms, wet, mottled with the chill of the water, and firm as marble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a nice-looking girl you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, though the words had\r\nnot been necessary to express his sense of her magnetism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you should see me Sundays!\xe2\x80\x9d she said piquantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I could?\xe2\x80\x9d he answered\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for you to think on. There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody after me just now, though\r\nthere med be in a week or two.\xe2\x80\x9d She had spoken this without a smile,\r\nand the dimples disappeared.\r\n\r\nJude felt himself drifting strangely, but could not help it. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you\r\nlet me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time she had managed to get back one dimple by turning her face\r\naside for a moment and repeating the odd little sucking operation\r\nbefore mentioned, Jude being still unconscious of more than a general\r\nimpression of her appearance. \xe2\x80\x9cNext Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d he hazarded. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\r\nthat is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I call?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe brightened with a little glow of triumph, swept him almost tenderly\r\nwith her eyes in turning, and retracing her steps down the brookside\r\ngrass rejoined her companions.\r\n\r\nJude Fawley shouldered his tool-basket and resumed his lonely way,\r\nfilled with an ardour at which he mentally stood at gaze. He had just\r\ninhaled a single breath from a new atmosphere, which had evidently been\r\nhanging round him everywhere he went, for he knew not how long, but had\r\nsomehow been divided from his actual breathing as by a sheet of glass.\r\nThe intentions as to reading, working, and learning, which he had so\r\nprecisely formulated only a few minutes earlier, were suffering a\r\ncurious collapse into a corner, he knew not how.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s only a bit of fun,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, faintly conscious\r\nthat to common sense there was something lacking, and still more\r\nobviously something redundant in the nature of this girl who had drawn\r\nhim to her which made it necessary that he should assert mere\r\nsportiveness on his part as his reason in seeking her\xe2\x80\x94something in her\r\nquite antipathetic to that side of him which had been occupied with\r\nliterary study and the magnificent Christminster dream. It had been no\r\nvestal who chose _that_ missile for opening her attack on him. He saw\r\nthis with his intellectual eye, just for a short fleeting while, as by\r\nthe light of a falling lamp one might momentarily see an inscription on\r\na wall before being enshrouded in darkness. And then this passing\r\ndiscriminative power was withdrawn, and Jude was lost to all conditions\r\nof things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure, that of having\r\nfound a new channel for emotional interest hitherto unsuspected, though\r\nit had lain close beside him. He was to meet this enkindling one of the\r\nother sex on the following Sunday.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the girl had joined her companions, and she silently resumed\r\nher flicking and sousing of the chitterlings in the pellucid stream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatched un, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d laconically asked the girl called Anny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I wish I had thrown something else than that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nregretfully murmured Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord! he\xe2\x80\x99s nobody, though you med think so. He used to drive old\r\nDrusilla Fawley\xe2\x80\x99s bread-cart out at Marygreen, till he \xe2\x80\x99prenticed\r\nhimself at Alfredston. Since then he\xe2\x80\x99s been very stuck up, and always\r\nreading. He wants to be a scholar, they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what he is, or anything about \xe2\x80\x99n. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it,\r\nmy child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t ye! You needn\xe2\x80\x99t try to deceive us! What did you stay talking\r\nto him for, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want un? Whether you do or whether you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as a child. I could see it as you courted on the bridge,\r\nwhen he looked at \xe2\x80\x99ee as if he had never seen a woman before in his\r\nborn days. Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s to be had by any woman who can get him to care\r\nfor her a bit, if she likes to set herself to catch him the right way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Jude Fawley was pausing in his bedroom with the sloping\r\nceiling, looking at the books on the table, and then at the black mark\r\non the plaster above them, made by the smoke of his lamp in past\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday afternoon, four-and-twenty hours after his meeting with\r\nArabella Donn. During the whole bygone week he had been resolving to\r\nset this afternoon apart for a special purpose,\xe2\x80\x94the re-reading of his\r\nGreek Testament\xe2\x80\x94his new one, with better type than his old copy,\r\nfollowing Griesbach\xe2\x80\x99s text as amended by numerous correctors, and with\r\nvariorum readings in the margin. He was proud of the book, having\r\nobtained it by boldly writing to its London publisher, a thing he had\r\nnever done before.\r\n\r\nHe had anticipated much pleasure in this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s reading, under the\r\nquiet roof of his great-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house as formerly, where he now slept\r\nonly two nights a week. But a new thing, a great hitch, had happened\r\nyesterday in the gliding and noiseless current of his life, and he felt\r\nas a snake must feel who has sloughed off its winter skin, and cannot\r\nunderstand the brightness and sensitiveness of its new one.\r\n\r\nHe would not go out to meet her, after all. He sat down, opened the\r\nbook, and with his elbows firmly planted on the table, and his hands to\r\nhis temples, began at the beginning:\r\n\r\n\xce\x97 \xce\x9a\xce\x91\xce\x99\xce\x9d\xce\x97 \xce\x94\xce\x99\xce\x91\xce\x98\xce\x97\xce\x9a\xce\x97.\r\n\r\nHad he promised to call for her? Surely he had! She would wait indoors,\r\npoor girl, and waste all her afternoon on account of him. There was a\r\nsomething in her, too, which was very winning, apart from promises. He\r\nought not to break faith with her. Even though he had only Sundays and\r\nweek-day evenings for reading he could afford one afternoon, seeing\r\nthat other young men afforded so many. After to-day he would never\r\nprobably see her again. Indeed, it would be impossible, considering\r\nwhat his plans were.\r\n\r\nIn short, as if materially, a compelling arm of extraordinary muscular\r\npower seized hold of him\xe2\x80\x94something which had nothing in common with the\r\nspirits and influences that had moved him hitherto. This seemed to care\r\nlittle for his reason and his will, nothing for his so-called elevated\r\nintentions, and moved him along, as a violent schoolmaster a schoolboy\r\nhe has seized by the collar, in a direction which tended towards the\r\nembrace of a woman for whom he had no respect, and whose life had\r\nnothing in common with his own except locality.\r\n\r\n\xce\x97 \xce\x9a\xce\x91\xce\x99\xce\x9d\xce\x97 \xce\x94\xce\x99\xce\x91\xce\x98\xce\x97\xce\x9a\xce\x97 was no more heeded, and the predestinate Jude sprang up\r\nand across the room. Foreseeing such an event he had already arrayed\r\nhimself in his best clothes. In three minutes he was out of the house\r\nand descending by the path across the wide vacant hollow of corn-ground\r\nwhich lay between the village and the isolated house of Arabella in the\r\ndip beyond the upland.\r\n\r\nAs he walked he looked at his watch. He could be back in two hours,\r\neasily, and a good long time would still remain to him for reading\r\nafter tea.\r\n\r\nPassing the few unhealthy fir-trees and cottage where the path joined\r\nthe highway he hastened along, and struck away to the left, descending\r\nthe steep side of the country to the west of the Brown House. Here at\r\nthe base of the chalk formation he neared the brook that oozed from it,\r\nand followed the stream till he reached her dwelling. A smell of\r\npiggeries came from the back, and the grunting of the originators of\r\nthat smell. He entered the garden, and knocked at the door with the\r\nknob of his stick.\r\n\r\nSomebody had seen him through the window, for a male voice on the\r\ninside said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArabella! Here\xe2\x80\x99s your young man come coorting! Mizzle, my girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude winced at the words. Courting in such a businesslike aspect as it\r\nevidently wore to the speaker was the last thing he was thinking of. He\r\nwas going to walk with her, perhaps kiss her; but \xe2\x80\x9ccourting\xe2\x80\x9d was too\r\ncoolly purposeful to be anything but repugnant to his ideas. The door\r\nwas opened and he entered, just as Arabella came downstairs in radiant\r\nwalking attire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a chair, Mr. What\xe2\x80\x99s-your-name?\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, an energetic,\r\nblack-whiskered man, in the same businesslike tones Jude had heard from\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather go out at once, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered to Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll walk up to the Brown House and back, we can do\r\nit in half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella looked so handsome amid her untidy surroundings that he felt\r\nglad he had come, and all the misgivings vanished that had hitherto\r\nhaunted him.\r\n\r\nFirst they clambered to the top of the great down, during which ascent\r\nhe had occasionally to take her hand to assist her. Then they bore off\r\nto the left along the crest into the ridgeway, which they followed till\r\nit intersected the high-road at the Brown House aforesaid, the spot of\r\nhis former fervid desires to behold Christminster. But he forgot them\r\nnow. He talked the commonest local twaddle to Arabella with greater\r\nzest than he would have felt in discussing all the philosophies with\r\nall the Dons in the recently adored university, and passed the spot\r\nwhere he had knelt to Diana and Ph\xc5\x93bus without remembering that there\r\nwere any such people in the mythology, or that the sun was anything\r\nelse than a useful lamp for illuminating Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s face. An\r\nindescribable lightness of heel served to lift him along; and Jude, the\r\nincipient scholar, prospective D.D., professor, bishop, or what not,\r\nfelt himself honoured and glorified by the condescension of this\r\nhandsome country wench in agreeing to take a walk with him in her\r\nSunday frock and ribbons.\r\n\r\nThey reached the Brown House barn\xe2\x80\x94the point at which he had planned to\r\nturn back. While looking over the vast northern landscape from this\r\nspot they were struck by the rising of a dense volume of smoke from the\r\nneighbourhood of the little town which lay beneath them at a distance\r\nof a couple of miles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fire,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s run and see it\xe2\x80\x94do! It is not\r\nfar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tenderness which had grown up in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s bosom left him no will to\r\nthwart her inclination now\xe2\x80\x94which pleased him in affording him excuse\r\nfor a longer time with her. They started off down the hill almost at a\r\ntrot; but on gaining level ground at the bottom, and walking a mile,\r\nthey found that the spot of the fire was much further off than it had\r\nseemed.\r\n\r\nHaving begun their journey, however, they pushed on; but it was not\r\ntill five o\xe2\x80\x99clock that they found themselves on the scene,\xe2\x80\x94the distance\r\nbeing altogether about half-a-dozen miles from Marygreen, and three\r\nfrom Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s. The conflagration had been got under by the time they\r\nreached it, and after a short inspection of the melancholy ruins they\r\nretraced their steps\xe2\x80\x94their course lying through the town of Alfredston.\r\n\r\nArabella said she would like some tea, and they entered an inn of an\r\ninferior class, and gave their order. As it was not for beer they had a\r\nlong time to wait. The maid-servant recognized Jude, and whispered her\r\nsurprise to her mistress in the background, that he, the student \xe2\x80\x9cwho\r\nkept hisself up so particular,\xe2\x80\x9d should have suddenly descended so low\r\nas to keep company with Arabella. The latter guessed what was being\r\nsaid, and laughed as she met the serious and tender gaze of her\r\nlover\xe2\x80\x94the low and triumphant laugh of a careless woman who sees she is\r\nwinning her game.\r\n\r\nThey sat and looked round the room, and at the picture of Samson and\r\nDelilah which hung on the wall, and at the circular beer-stains on the\r\ntable, and at the spittoons underfoot filled with sawdust. The whole\r\naspect of the scene had that depressing effect on Jude which few places\r\ncan produce like a tap-room on a Sunday evening when the setting sun is\r\nslanting in, and no liquor is going, and the unfortunate wayfarer finds\r\nhimself with no other haven of rest.\r\n\r\nIt began to grow dusk. They could not wait longer, really, for the tea,\r\nthey said. \xe2\x80\x9cYet what else can we do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a three-mile\r\nwalk for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we can have some beer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeer, oh yes. I had forgotten that. Somehow it seems odd to come to a\r\npublic-house for beer on a Sunday evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Jude by this time wished he was out of such an\r\nuncongenial atmosphere; but he ordered the beer, which was promptly\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nArabella tasted it. \xe2\x80\x9cUgh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nJude tasted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nbeer very much now, it is true. I like it well enough, but it is bad to\r\nread on, and I find coffee better. But this seems all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdulterated\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t touch it!\xe2\x80\x9d She mentioned three or four ingredients\r\nthat she detected in the liquor beyond malt and hops, much to Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much you know!\xe2\x80\x9d he said good-humouredly.\r\n\r\nNevertheless she returned to the beer and drank her share, and they\r\nwent on their way. It was now nearly dark, and as soon as they had\r\nwithdrawn from the lights of the town they walked closer together, till\r\nthey touched each other. She wondered why he did not put his arm round\r\nher waist, but he did not; he merely said what to himself seemed a\r\nquite bold enough thing: \xe2\x80\x9cTake my arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it, thoroughly, up to the shoulder. He felt the warmth of her\r\nbody against his, and putting his stick under his other arm held with\r\nhis right hand her right as it rested in its place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we are well together, dear, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d he observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; adding to herself: \xe2\x80\x9cRather mild!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fast I have become!\xe2\x80\x9d he was thinking.\r\n\r\nThus they walked till they reached the foot of the upland, where they\r\ncould see the white highway ascending before them in the gloom. From\r\nthis point the only way of getting to Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s was by going up the\r\nincline, and dipping again into her valley on the right. Before they\r\nhad climbed far they were nearly run into by two men who had been\r\nwalking on the grass unseen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese lovers\xe2\x80\x94you find \xe2\x80\x99em out o\xe2\x80\x99 doors in all seasons and\r\nweathers\xe2\x80\x94lovers and homeless dogs only,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men as they\r\nvanished down the hill.\r\n\r\nArabella tittered lightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we lovers?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor answer she inclined her head upon his shoulder. Jude took the hint,\r\nand encircling her waist with his arm, pulled her to him and kissed\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThey walked now no longer arm in arm but, as she had desired, clasped\r\ntogether. After all, what did it matter since it was dark, said Jude to\r\nhimself. When they were half-way up the long hill they paused as by\r\narrangement, and he kissed her again. They reached the top, and he\r\nkissed her once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can keep your arm there, if you would like to,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gently.\r\n\r\nHe did so, thinking how trusting she was.\r\n\r\nThus they slowly went towards her home. He had left his cottage at\r\nhalf-past three, intending to be sitting down again to the New\r\nTestament by half-past five. It was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock when, with another\r\nembrace, he stood to deliver her up at her father\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nShe asked him to come in, if only for a minute, as it would seem so odd\r\notherwise, and as if she had been out alone in the dark. He gave way,\r\nand followed her in. Immediately that the door was opened he found, in\r\naddition to her parents, several neighbours sitting round. They all\r\nspoke in a congratulatory manner, and took him seriously as Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintended partner.\r\n\r\nThey did not belong to his set or circle, and he felt out of place and\r\nembarrassed. He had not meant this: a mere afternoon of pleasant\r\nwalking with Arabella, that was all he had meant. He did not stay\r\nlonger than to speak to her stepmother, a simple, quiet woman without\r\nfeatures or character; and bidding them all good night plunged with a\r\nsense of relief into the track over the down.\r\n\r\nBut that sense was only temporary: Arabella soon re-asserted her sway\r\nin his soul. He walked as if he felt himself to be another man from the\r\nJude of yesterday. What were his books to him? what were his\r\nintentions, hitherto adhered to so strictly, as to not wasting a single\r\nminute of time day by day? \xe2\x80\x9cWasting!\xe2\x80\x9d It depended on your point of view\r\nto define that: he was just living for the first time: not wasting\r\nlife. It was better to love a woman than to be a graduate, or a parson;\r\nay, or a pope!\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to the house his aunt had gone to bed, and a general\r\nconsciousness of his neglect seemed written on the face of all things\r\nconfronting him. He went upstairs without a light, and the dim interior\r\nof his room accosted him with sad inquiry. There lay his book open,\r\njust as he had left it, and the capital letters on the title-page\r\nregarded him with fixed reproach in the grey starlight, like the\r\nunclosed eyes of a dead man:\r\n\r\n\xce\x97 \xce\x9a\xce\x91\xce\x99\xce\x9d\xce\x97 \xce\x94\xce\x99\xce\x91\xce\x98\xce\x97\xce\x9a\xce\x97.\r\n\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nJude had to leave early next morning for his usual week of absence at\r\nlodgings; and it was with a sense of futility that he threw into his\r\nbasket upon his tools and other necessaries the unread book he had\r\nbrought with him.\r\n\r\nHe kept his impassioned doings a secret almost from himself. Arabella,\r\non the contrary, made them public among all her friends and\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\nRetracing by the light of dawn the road he had followed a few hours\r\nearlier under cover of darkness, with his sweetheart by his side, he\r\nreached the bottom of the hill, where he walked slowly, and stood\r\nstill. He was on the spot where he had given her the first kiss. As the\r\nsun had only just risen it was possible that nobody had passed there\r\nsince. Jude looked on the ground and sighed. He looked closely, and\r\ncould just discern in the damp dust the imprints of their feet as they\r\nhad stood locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms. She was not there now, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nembroidery of imagination upon the stuff of nature\xe2\x80\x9d so depicted her\r\npast presence that a void was in his heart which nothing could fill. A\r\npollard willow stood close to the place, and that willow was different\r\nfrom all other willows in the world. Utter annihilation of the six days\r\nwhich must elapse before he could see her again as he had promised\r\nwould have been his intensest wish if he had had only the week to live.\r\n\r\nAn hour and a half later Arabella came along the same way with her two\r\ncompanions of the Saturday. She passed unheedingly the scene of the\r\nkiss, and the willow that marked it, though chattering freely on the\r\nsubject to the other two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did he tell \xe2\x80\x99ee next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d And she related almost word for word some of his\r\ntenderest speeches. If Jude had been behind the fence he would have\r\nfelt not a little surprised at learning how very few of his sayings and\r\ndoings on the previous evening were private.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got him to care for \xe2\x80\x99ee a bit, \xe2\x80\x99nation if you han\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured\r\nAnny judicially. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s well to be you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Arabella replied in a curiously low, hungry tone of\r\nlatent sensuousness: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got him to care for me: yes! But I want him\r\nto more than care for me; I want him to have me\xe2\x80\x94to marry me! I must\r\nhave him. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do without him. He\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of man I long for. I\r\nshall go mad if I can\xe2\x80\x99t give myself to him altogether! I felt I should\r\nwhen I first saw him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs he is a romancing, straightfor\xe2\x80\x99ard, honest chap, he\xe2\x80\x99s to be had,\r\nand as a husband, if you set about catching him in the right way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella remained thinking awhile. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat med be the right way?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sarah, the third girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x94No further, that is, than by plain courting, and\r\ntaking care he don\xe2\x80\x99t go too far!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe third girl looked at the second. \xe2\x80\x9cShe _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis clear she don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd having lived in a town, too, as one may say! Well, we can teach\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee som\xe2\x80\x99at then, as well as you us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And how do you mean\xe2\x80\x94a sure way to gain a man? Take me for an\r\ninnocent, and have done wi\xe2\x80\x99 it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA countryman that\xe2\x80\x99s honourable and serious-minded such as he; God\r\nforbid that I should say a sojer, or sailor, or commercial gent from\r\nthe towns, or any of them that be slippery with poor women! I\xe2\x80\x99d do no\r\nfriend that harm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, such as he, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s companions looked at each other, and turning up their eyes\r\nin drollery began smirking. Then one went up close to Arabella, and,\r\nalthough nobody was near, imparted some information in a low tone, the\r\nother observing curiously the effect upon Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the last-named slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI own I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of that way! \xe2\x80\xa6\r\nBut suppose he _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ honourable? A woman had better not have tried\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing venture nothing have! Besides, you make sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhonourable before you begin. You\xe2\x80\x99d be safe enough with yours. I wish I\r\nhad the chance! Lots of girls do it; or do you think they\xe2\x80\x99d get married\r\nat all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella pursued her way in silent thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try it!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered; but not to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOne week\xe2\x80\x99s end Jude was as usual walking out to his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s at Marygreen\r\nfrom his lodging in Alfredston, a walk which now had large attractions\r\nfor him quite other than his desire to see his aged and morose\r\nrelative. He diverged to the right before ascending the hill with the\r\nsingle purpose of gaining, on his way, a glimpse of Arabella that\r\nshould not come into the reckoning of regular appointments. Before\r\nquite reaching the homestead his alert eye perceived the top of her\r\nhead moving quickly hither and thither over the garden hedge. Entering\r\nthe gate he found that three young unfattened pigs had escaped from\r\ntheir sty by leaping clean over the top, and that she was endeavouring\r\nunassisted to drive them in through the door which she had set open.\r\nThe lines of her countenance changed from the rigidity of business to\r\nthe softness of love when she saw Jude, and she bent her eyes\r\nlanguishingly upon him. The animals took advantage of the pause by\r\ndoubling and bolting out of the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were only put in this morning!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, stimulated to pursue\r\nin spite of her lover\xe2\x80\x99s presence. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were drove from Spaddleholt\r\nFarm only yesterday, where Father bought \xe2\x80\x99em at a stiff price enough.\r\nThey are wanting to get home again, the stupid toads! Will you shut the\r\ngarden gate, dear, and help me to get \xe2\x80\x99em in. There are no men folk at\r\nhome, only Mother, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be lost if we don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe set himself to assist, and dodged this way and that over the potato\r\nrows and the cabbages. Every now and then they ran together, when he\r\ncaught her for a moment and kissed her. The first pig was got back\r\npromptly; the second with some difficulty; the third a long-legged\r\ncreature, was more obstinate and agile. He plunged through a hole in\r\nthe garden hedge, and into the lane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be lost if I don\xe2\x80\x99t follow \xe2\x80\x99n!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rushed in full pursuit out of the garden, Jude alongside her,\r\nbarely contriving to keep the fugitive in sight. Occasionally they\r\nwould shout to some boy to stop the animal, but he always wriggled past\r\nand ran on as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me take your hand, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are getting out of\r\nbreath.\xe2\x80\x9d She gave him her now hot hand with apparent willingness, and\r\nthey trotted along together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis comes of driving \xe2\x80\x99em home,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cThey always know the\r\nway back if you do that. They ought to have been carted over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the pig had reached an unfastened gate admitting to the\r\nopen down, across which he sped with all the agility his little legs\r\nafforded. As soon as the pursuers had entered and ascended to the top\r\nof the high ground it became apparent that they would have to run all\r\nthe way to the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s if they wished to get at him. From this summit\r\nhe could be seen as a minute speck, following an unerring line towards\r\nhis old home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no good!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be there long before we get\r\nthere. It don\xe2\x80\x99t matter now we know he\xe2\x80\x99s not lost or stolen on the way.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ll see it is ours, and send un back. Oh dear, how hot I be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout relinquishing her hold of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s hand she swerved aside and\r\nflung herself down on the sod under a stunted thorn, precipitately\r\npulling Jude on to his knees at the same time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I ask pardon\xe2\x80\x94I nearly threw you down, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I! But I am so\r\ntired!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lay supine, and straight as an arrow, on the sloping sod of this\r\nhill-top, gazing up into the blue miles of sky, and still retaining her\r\nwarm hold of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s hand. He reclined on his elbow near her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve run all this way for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, her form heaving and\r\nfalling in quick pants, her face flushed, her full red lips parted, and\r\na fine dew of perspiration on her skin. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak,\r\ndeary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m blown too. It was all up hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were in absolute solitude\xe2\x80\x94the most apparent of all solitudes, that\r\nof empty surrounding space. Nobody could be nearer than a mile to them\r\nwithout their seeing him. They were, in fact, on one of the summits of\r\nthe county, and the distant landscape around Christminster could be\r\ndiscerned from where they lay. But Jude did not think of that then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can see such a pretty thing up this tree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nsort of a\xe2\x80\x94caterpillar, of the most loveliest green and yellow you ever\r\ncame across!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, sitting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t see him there\xe2\x80\x94you must come here,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nHe bent nearer and put his head in front of hers. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t see it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, on the limb there where it branches off\xe2\x80\x94close to the moving\r\nleaf\xe2\x80\x94there!\xe2\x80\x9d She gently pulled him down beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see it,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, the back of his head against her cheek.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can, perhaps, standing up.\xe2\x80\x9d He stood accordingly, placing\r\nhimself in the direct line of her gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow stupid you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she said crossly, turning away her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to see it, dear: why should I?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied looking down\r\nupon her. \xe2\x80\x9cGet up, Abby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to let me kiss you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting to ever so long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rolled round her face, remained a moment looking deedily aslant at\r\nhim; then with a slight curl of the lip sprang to her feet, and\r\nexclaiming abruptly \xe2\x80\x9cI must mizzle!\xe2\x80\x9d walked off quickly homeward. Jude\r\nfollowed and rejoined her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust one!\xe2\x80\x9d he coaxed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShan\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe, surprised: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept her two lips resentfully together, and Jude followed her like\r\na pet lamb till she slackened her pace and walked beside him, talking\r\ncalmly on indifferent subjects, and always checking him if he tried to\r\ntake her hand or clasp her waist. Thus they descended to the precincts\r\nof her father\xe2\x80\x99s homestead, and Arabella went in, nodding good-bye to\r\nhim with a supercilious, affronted air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect I took too much liberty with her, somehow,\xe2\x80\x9d Jude said to\r\nhimself, as he withdrew with a sigh and went on to Marygreen.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning the interior of Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s home was, as usual, the\r\nscene of a grand weekly cooking, the preparation of the special Sunday\r\ndinner. Her father was shaving before a little glass hung on the\r\nmullion of the window, and her mother and Arabella herself were\r\nshelling beans hard by. A neighbour passed on her way home from morning\r\nservice at the nearest church, and seeing Donn engaged at the window\r\nwith the razor, nodded and came in.\r\n\r\nShe at once spoke playfully to Arabella: \xe2\x80\x9cI zeed \xe2\x80\x99ee running with\r\n\xe2\x80\x99un\xe2\x80\x94hee-hee! I hope \xe2\x80\x99tis coming to something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella merely threw a look of consciousness into her face without\r\nraising her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s for Christminster, I hear, as soon as he can get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard that lately\xe2\x80\x94quite lately?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arabella with a\r\njealous, tigerish indrawing of breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! But it has been known a long time that it is his plan. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\non\xe2\x80\x99y waiting here for an opening. Ah well: he must walk about with\r\nsomebody, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose. Young men don\xe2\x80\x99t mean much now-a-days. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a sip\r\nhere and a sip there with \xe2\x80\x99em. \xe2\x80\x99Twas different in my time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the gossip had departed Arabella said suddenly to her mother: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant you and Father to go and inquire how the Edlins be, this evening\r\nafter tea. Or no\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s evening service at Fensworth\xe2\x80\x94you can walk to\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh? What\xe2\x80\x99s up to-night, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Only I want the house to myself. He\xe2\x80\x99s shy; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get un\r\nto come in when you are here. I shall let him slip through my fingers\r\nif I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, much as I care for \xe2\x80\x99n!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is fine we med as well go, since you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Arabella met and walked with Jude, who had now for\r\nweeks ceased to look into a book of Greek, Latin, or any other tongue.\r\nThey wandered up the slopes till they reached the green track along the\r\nridge, which they followed to the circular British earth-bank\r\nadjoining, Jude thinking of the great age of the trackway, and of the\r\ndrovers who had frequented it, probably before the Romans knew the\r\ncountry. Up from the level lands below them floated the chime of church\r\nbells. Presently they were reduced to one note, which quickened, and\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll go back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella, who had attended to the sounds.\r\n\r\nJude assented. So long as he was near her he minded little where he\r\nwas. When they arrived at her house he said lingeringly: \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nin. Why are you in such a hurry to go in to-night? It is not near\r\ndark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. She tried the handle of the door and found\r\nit locked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94they are gone to church,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. And searching behind the\r\nscraper she found the key and unlocked the door. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, you\xe2\x80\x99ll come in a\r\nmoment?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be all alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude with alacrity, the case being unexpectedly\r\naltered.\r\n\r\nIndoors they went. Did he want any tea? No, it was too late: he would\r\nrather sit and talk to her. She took off her jacket and hat, and they\r\nsat down\xe2\x80\x94naturally enough close together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t touch me, please,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am part egg-shell. Or\r\nperhaps I had better put it in a safe place.\xe2\x80\x9d She began unfastening the\r\ncollar of her gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said her lover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn egg\xe2\x80\x94a cochin\xe2\x80\x99s egg. I am hatching a very rare sort. I carry it\r\nabout everywhere with me, and it will get hatched in less than three\r\nweeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you carry it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust here.\xe2\x80\x9d She put her hand into her bosom and drew out the egg,\r\nwhich was wrapped in wool, outside it being a piece of pig\xe2\x80\x99s bladder,\r\nin case of accidents. Having exhibited it to him she put it back, \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nmind you don\xe2\x80\x99t come near me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get it broke, and have to\r\nbegin another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you do such a strange thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an old custom. I suppose it is natural for a woman to want to\r\nbring live things into the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very awkward for me just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt serves you right. There\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all you can have of me\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had turned round her chair, and, reaching over the back of it,\r\npresented her cheek to him gingerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very shabby of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have catched me a minute ago when I had put the egg down!\r\nThere!\xe2\x80\x9d she said defiantly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am without it now!\xe2\x80\x9d She had quickly\r\nwithdrawn the egg a second time; but before he could quite reach her\r\nshe had put it back as quickly, laughing with the excitement of her\r\nstrategy. Then there was a little struggle, Jude making a plunge for it\r\nand capturing it triumphantly. Her face flushed; and becoming suddenly\r\nconscious he flushed also.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other, panting; till he rose and said: \xe2\x80\x9cOne kiss,\r\nnow I can do it without damage to property; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she had jumped up too. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must find me first!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nHer lover followed her as she withdrew. It was now dark inside the\r\nroom, and the window being small he could not discover for a long time\r\nwhat had become of her, till a laugh revealed her to have rushed up the\r\nstairs, whither Jude rushed at her heels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was some two months later in the year, and the pair had met\r\nconstantly during the interval. Arabella seemed dissatisfied; she was\r\nalways imagining, and waiting, and wondering.\r\n\r\nOne day she met the itinerant Vilbert. She, like all the cottagers\r\nthereabout, knew the quack well, and she began telling him of her\r\nexperiences. Arabella had been gloomy, but before he left her she had\r\ngrown brighter. That evening she kept an appointment with Jude, who\r\nseemed sad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I ought to go. I think it\r\nwill be better both for you and for me. I wish some things had never\r\nbegun! I was much to blame, I know. But it is never too late to mend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella began to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know it is not too late?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very well to say! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told you yet!\xe2\x80\x9d and she looked\r\ninto his face with streaming eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, turning pale. \xe2\x80\x9cNot\xe2\x80\xa6?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! And what shall I do if you desert me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Arabella\xe2\x80\x94how can you say that, my dear! You _know_ I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndesert you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have next to no wages as yet, you know; or perhaps I should have\r\nthought of this before\xe2\x80\xa6 But, of course if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, we must\r\nmarry! What other thing do you think I could dream of doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought\xe2\x80\x94I thought, deary, perhaps you would go away all the more for\r\nthat, and leave me to face it alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew better! Of course I never dreamt six months ago, or even\r\nthree, of marrying. It is a complete smashing up of my plans\xe2\x80\x94I mean my\r\nplans before I knew you, my dear. But what are they, after all! Dreams\r\nabout books, and degrees, and impossible fellowships, and all that.\r\nCertainly we\xe2\x80\x99ll marry: we must!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night he went out alone, and walked in the dark self-communing. He\r\nknew well, too well, in the secret centre of his brain, that Arabella\r\nwas not worth a great deal as a specimen of womankind. Yet, such being\r\nthe custom of the rural districts among honourable young men who had\r\ndrifted so far into intimacy with a woman as he unfortunately had done,\r\nhe was ready to abide by what he had said, and take the consequences.\r\nFor his own soothing he kept up a factitious belief in her. His idea of\r\nher was the thing of most consequence, not Arabella herself, he\r\nsometimes said laconically.\r\n\r\nThe banns were put in and published the very next Sunday. The people of\r\nthe parish all said what a simple fool young Fawley was. All his\r\nreading had only come to this, that he would have to sell his books to\r\nbuy saucepans. Those who guessed the probable state of affairs,\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s parents being among them, declared that it was the sort of\r\nconduct they would have expected of such an honest young man as Jude in\r\nreparation of the wrong he had done his innocent sweetheart. The parson\r\nwho married them seemed to think it satisfactory too. And so, standing\r\nbefore the aforesaid officiator, the two swore that at every other time\r\nof their lives till death took them, they would assuredly believe,\r\nfeel, and desire precisely as they had believed, felt, and desired\r\nduring the few preceding weeks. What was as remarkable as the\r\nundertaking itself was the fact that nobody seemed at all surprised at\r\nwhat they swore.\r\n\r\nFawley\xe2\x80\x99s aunt being a baker she made him a bride-cake, saying bitterly\r\nthat it was the last thing she could do for him, poor silly fellow; and\r\nthat it would have been far better if, instead of his living to trouble\r\nher, he had gone underground years before with his father and mother.\r\nOf this cake Arabella took some slices, wrapped them up in white\r\nnote-paper, and sent them to her companions in the pork-dressing\r\nbusiness, Anny and Sarah, labelling each packet \xe2\x80\x9c_In remembrance of\r\ngood advice_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prospects of the newly married couple were certainly not very\r\nbrilliant even to the most sanguine mind. He, a stone-mason\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napprentice, nineteen years of age, was working for half wages till he\r\nshould be out of his time. His wife was absolutely useless in a\r\ntown-lodging, where he at first had considered it would be necessary\r\nfor them to live. But the urgent need of adding to income in ever so\r\nlittle a degree caused him to take a lonely roadside cottage between\r\nthe Brown House and Marygreen, that he might have the profits of a\r\nvegetable garden, and utilize her past experiences by letting her keep\r\na pig. But it was not the sort of life he had bargained for, and it was\r\na long way to walk to and from Alfredston every day. Arabella, however,\r\nfelt that all these make-shifts were temporary; she had gained a\r\nhusband; that was the thing\xe2\x80\x94a husband with a lot of earning power in\r\nhim for buying her frocks and hats when he should begin to get\r\nfrightened a bit, and stick to his trade, and throw aside those stupid\r\nbooks for practical undertakings.\r\n\r\nSo to the cottage he took her on the evening of the marriage, giving up\r\nhis old room at his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94where so much of the hard labour at Greek\r\nand Latin had been carried on.\r\n\r\nA little chill overspread him at her first unrobing. A long tail of\r\nhair, which Arabella wore twisted up in an enormous knob at the back of\r\nher head, was deliberately unfastened, stroked out, and hung upon the\r\nlooking-glass which he had bought her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your own?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sudden distaste for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94it never is nowadays with the better class.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! Perhaps not in towns. But in the country it is supposed to\r\nbe different. Besides, you\xe2\x80\x99ve enough of your own, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, enough as country notions go. But in town the men expect more,\r\nand when I was barmaid at Aldbrickham\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarmaid at Aldbrickham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not exactly barmaid\xe2\x80\x94I used to draw the drink at a public-house\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94just for a little time; that was all. Some people put me up to\r\ngetting this, and I bought it just for a fancy. The more you have the\r\nbetter in Aldbrickham, which is a finer town than all your\r\nChristminsters. Every lady of position wears false hair\xe2\x80\x94the barber\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassistant told me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude thought with a feeling of sickness that though this might be true\r\nto some extent, for all that he knew, many unsophisticated girls would\r\nand did go to towns and remain there for years without losing their\r\nsimplicity of life and embellishments. Others, alas, had an instinct\r\ntowards artificiality in their very blood, and became adepts in\r\ncounterfeiting at the first glimpse of it. However, perhaps there was\r\nno great sin in a woman adding to her hair, and he resolved to think no\r\nmore of it.\r\n\r\nA new-made wife can usually manage to excite interest for a few weeks,\r\neven though the prospects of the household ways and means are cloudy.\r\nThere is a certain piquancy about her situation, and her manner to her\r\nacquaintance at the sense of it, which carries off the gloom of facts,\r\nand renders even the humblest bride independent awhile of the real.\r\nMrs. Jude Fawley was walking in the streets of Alfredston one\r\nmarket-day with this quality in her carriage when she met Anny her\r\nformer friend, whom she had not seen since the wedding.\r\n\r\nAs usual they laughed before talking; the world seemed funny to them\r\nwithout saying it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it turned out a good plan, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the girl to the wife.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it would with such as him. He\xe2\x80\x99s a dear good fellow, and you\r\nought to be proud of un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Fawley quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when do you expect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSsh! Not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Arabella, Arabella; you be a deep one! Mistaken! well, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclever\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a real stroke of genius! It is a thing I never thought o\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 all my experience! I never thought beyond bringing about the real\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94not that one could sham it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you be too quick to cry sham! \xe2\x80\x99Twasn\xe2\x80\x99t sham. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t he be in a taking! He\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to \xe2\x80\x99ee o\xe2\x80\x99 Saturday\r\nnights! Whatever it was, he\xe2\x80\x99ll say it was a trick\xe2\x80\x94a double one, by the\r\nLord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll own to the first, but not to the second\xe2\x80\xa6 Pooh\xe2\x80\x94he won\xe2\x80\x99t care!\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad I was wrong in what I said. He\xe2\x80\x99ll shake down, bless\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee\xe2\x80\x94men always do. What can \xe2\x80\x99em do otherwise? Married is married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was with a little uneasiness that Arabella approached\r\nthe time when in the natural course of things she would have to reveal\r\nthat the alarm she had raised had been without foundation. The occasion\r\nwas one evening at bedtime, and they were in their chamber in the\r\nlonely cottage by the wayside to which Jude walked home from his work\r\nevery day. He had worked hard the whole twelve hours, and had retired\r\nto rest before his wife. When she came into the room he was between\r\nsleeping and waking, and was barely conscious of her undressing before\r\nthe little looking-glass as he lay.\r\n\r\nOne action of hers, however, brought him to full cognition. Her face\r\nbeing reflected towards him as she sat, he could perceive that she was\r\namusing herself by artificially producing in each cheek the dimple\r\nbefore alluded to, a curious accomplishment of which she was mistress,\r\neffecting it by a momentary suction. It seemed to him for the first\r\ntime that the dimples were far oftener absent from her face during his\r\nintercourse with her nowadays than they had been in the earlier weeks\r\nof their acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do that, Arabella!\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no harm in it,\r\nbut\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned and laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cLord, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were awake!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow countrified you are! That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you learn it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere that I know of. They used to stay without any trouble when I\r\nwas at the public-house; but now they won\xe2\x80\x99t. My face was fatter then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care about dimples. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they improve a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94particularly a married woman, and of full-sized figure like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost men think otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what most men think, if they do. How do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to be told so when I was serving in the tap-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94that public-house experience accounts for your knowing about the\r\nadulteration of the ale when we went and had some that Sunday evening.\r\nI thought when I married you that you had always lived in your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have known better than that, and seen I was a little more\r\nfinished than I could have been by staying where I was born. There was\r\nnot much to do at home, and I was eating my head off, so I went away\r\nfor three months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll soon have plenty to do now, dear, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course\xe2\x80\x94little things to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will it be? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me exactly, instead of in such general\r\nterms as you have used?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94the date.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to tell. I made a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat bolt upright in bed and looked at her. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen fancy wrong things sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94! Why, of course, so unprepared as I was, without a stick of\r\nfurniture, and hardly a shilling, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have hurried on our\r\naffair, and brought you to a half-furnished hut before I was ready, if\r\nit had not been for the news you gave me, which made it necessary to\r\nsave you, ready or no\xe2\x80\xa6 Good God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take on, dear. What\xe2\x80\x99s done can\xe2\x80\x99t be undone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no more to say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave the answer simply, and lay down; and there was silence between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen Jude awoke the next morning he seemed to see the world with a\r\ndifferent eye. As to the point in question he was compelled to accept\r\nher word; in the circumstances he could not have acted otherwise while\r\nordinary notions prevailed. But how came they to prevail?\r\n\r\nThere seemed to him, vaguely and dimly, something wrong in a social\r\nritual which made necessary a cancelling of well-formed schemes\r\ninvolving years of thought and labour, of foregoing a man\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nopportunity of showing himself superior to the lower animals, and of\r\ncontributing his units of work to the general progress of his\r\ngeneration, because of a momentary surprise by a new and transitory\r\ninstinct which had nothing in it of the nature of vice, and could be\r\nonly at the most called weakness. He was inclined to inquire what he\r\nhad done, or she lost, for that matter, that he deserved to be caught\r\nin a gin which would cripple him, if not her also, for the rest of a\r\nlifetime? There was perhaps something fortunate in the fact that the\r\nimmediate reason of his marriage had proved to be non-existent. But the\r\nmarriage remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time arrived for killing the pig which Jude and his wife had\r\nfattened in their sty during the autumn months, and the butchering was\r\ntimed to take place as soon as it was light in the morning, so that\r\nJude might get to Alfredston without losing more than a quarter of a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe night had seemed strangely silent. Jude looked out of the window\r\nlong before dawn, and perceived that the ground was covered with\r\nsnow\xe2\x80\x94snow rather deep for the season, it seemed, a few flakes still\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid the pig-killer won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99ll come. You must get up and make the water hot, if you want\r\nChallow to scald him. Though I like singeing best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cI like the way of my own county.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went downstairs, lit the fire under the copper, and began feeding it\r\nwith bean-stalks, all the time without a candle, the blaze flinging a\r\ncheerful shine into the room; though for him the sense of cheerfulness\r\nwas lessened by thoughts on the reason of that blaze\xe2\x80\x94to heat water to\r\nscald the bristles from the body of an animal that as yet lived, and\r\nwhose voice could be continually heard from a corner of the garden. At\r\nhalf-past six, the time of appointment with the butcher, the water\r\nboiled, and Jude\xe2\x80\x99s wife came downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Challow come?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey waited, and it grew lighter, with the dreary light of a snowy\r\ndawn. She went out, gazed along the road, and returning said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\ncoming. Drunk last night, I expect. The snow is not enough to hinder\r\nhim, surely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we must put it off. It is only the water boiled for nothing. The\r\nsnow may be deep in the valley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t be put off. There\xe2\x80\x99s no more victuals for the pig. He ate the\r\nlast mixing o\xe2\x80\x99 barleymeal yesterday morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday morning? What has he lived on since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94he has been starving?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. We always do it the last day or two, to save bother with the\r\ninnerds. What ignorance, not to know that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat accounts for his crying so. Poor creature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94you must do the sticking\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no help for it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you\r\nhow. Or I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it myself\xe2\x80\x94I think I could. Though as it is such a big\r\npig I had rather Challow had done it. However, his basket o\xe2\x80\x99 knives and\r\nthings have been already sent on here, and we can use \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you shan\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, since it must be\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out to the sty, shovelled away the snow for the space of a\r\ncouple of yards or more, and placed the stool in front, with the knives\r\nand ropes at hand. A robin peered down at the preparations from the\r\nnearest tree, and, not liking the sinister look of the scene, flew\r\naway, though hungry. By this time Arabella had joined her husband, and\r\nJude, rope in hand, got into the sty, and noosed the affrighted animal,\r\nwho, beginning with a squeak of surprise, rose to repeated cries of\r\nrage. Arabella opened the sty-door, and together they hoisted the\r\nvictim on to the stool, legs upward, and while Jude held him Arabella\r\nbound him down, looping the cord over his legs to keep him from\r\nstruggling.\r\n\r\nThe animal\xe2\x80\x99s note changed its quality. It was not now rage, but the cry\r\nof despair; long-drawn, slow and hopeless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul I would sooner have gone without the pig than have had\r\nthis to do!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cA creature I have fed with my own hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be such a tender-hearted fool! There\xe2\x80\x99s the sticking-knife\xe2\x80\x94the\r\none with the point. Now whatever you do, don\xe2\x80\x99t stick un too deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stick him effectually, so as to make short work of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nchief thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThe meat must be well bled, and to do that\r\nhe must die slow. We shall lose a shilling a score if the meat is red\r\nand bloody! Just touch the vein, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. I was brought up to it,\r\nand I know. Every good butcher keeps un bleeding long. He ought to be\r\neight or ten minutes dying, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall not be half a minute if I can help it, however the meat may\r\nlook,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude determinedly. Scraping the bristles from the pig\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nupturned throat, as he had seen the butchers do, he slit the fat; then\r\nplunged in the knife with all his might.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Od damn it all!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthat ever I should say it! You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nover-stuck un! And I telling you all the time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo be quiet, Arabella, and have a little pity on the creature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold up the pail to catch the blood, and don\xe2\x80\x99t talk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever unworkmanlike the deed, it had been mercifully done. The blood\r\nflowed out in a torrent instead of in the trickling stream she had\r\ndesired. The dying animal\xe2\x80\x99s cry assumed its third and final tone, the\r\nshriek of agony; his glazing eyes riveting themselves on Arabella with\r\nthe eloquently keen reproach of a creature recognizing at last the\r\ntreachery of those who had seemed his only friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake un stop that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a noise will bring somebody\r\nor other up here, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want people to know we are doing it\r\nourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d Picking up the knife from the ground whereon Jude had flung\r\nit, she slipped it into the gash, and slit the windpipe. The pig was\r\ninstantly silent, his dying breath coming through the hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s better,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a hateful business!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPigs must be killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe animal heaved in a final convulsion, and, despite the rope, kicked\r\nout with all his last strength. A tablespoonful of black clot came\r\nforth, the trickling of red blood having ceased for some seconds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it; now he\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cArtful creatures\xe2\x80\x94they always keep\r\nback a drop like that as long as they can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last plunge had come so unexpectedly as to make Jude stagger, and\r\nin recovering himself he kicked over the vessel in which the blood had\r\nbeen caught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, thoroughly in a passion. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I can\xe2\x80\x99t make any\r\nblackpot. There\xe2\x80\x99s a waste, all through you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude put the pail upright, but only about a third of the whole steaming\r\nliquid was left in it, the main part being splashed over the snow, and\r\nforming a dismal, sordid, ugly spectacle\xe2\x80\x94to those who saw it as other\r\nthan an ordinary obtaining of meat. The lips and nostrils of the animal\r\nturned livid, then white, and the muscles of his limbs relaxed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d Jude said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s God got to do with such a messy job as a pig-killing, I should\r\nlike to know!\xe2\x80\x9d she said scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor folks must live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t scold you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly they became aware of a voice at hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, young married volk! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have carried it out much\r\nbetter myself, cuss me if I could!\xe2\x80\x9d The voice, which was husky, came\r\nfrom the garden-gate, and looking up from the scene of slaughter they\r\nsaw the burly form of Mr. Challow leaning over the gate, critically\r\nsurveying their performance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis well for \xe2\x80\x99ee to stand there and glane!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cOwing to\r\nyour being late the meat is blooded and half spoiled! \xe2\x80\x99Twon\xe2\x80\x99t fetch so\r\nmuch by a shilling a score!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChallow expressed his contrition. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should have waited a bit\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cand not have done this\xe2\x80\x94in the delicate state,\r\ntoo, that you be in at present, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. \xe2\x80\x99Tis risking yourself too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be concerned about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella, laughing. Jude\r\ntoo laughed, but there was a strong flavour of bitterness in his\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nChallow made up for his neglect of the killing by zeal in the scalding\r\nand scraping. Jude felt dissatisfied with himself as a man at what he\r\nhad done, though aware of his lack of common sense, and that the deed\r\nwould have amounted to the same thing if carried out by deputy. The\r\nwhite snow, stained with the blood of his fellow-mortal, wore an\r\nillogical look to him as a lover of justice, not to say a Christian;\r\nbut he could not see how the matter was to be mended. No doubt he was,\r\nas his wife had called him, a tender-hearted fool.\r\n\r\nHe did not like the road to Alfredston now. It stared him cynically in\r\nthe face. The wayside objects reminded him so much of his courtship of\r\nhis wife that, to keep them out of his eyes, he read whenever he could\r\nas he walked to and from his work. Yet he sometimes felt that by caring\r\nfor books he was not escaping common-place nor gaining rare ideas,\r\nevery working-man being of that taste now. When passing near the spot\r\nby the stream on which he had first made her acquaintance he one day\r\nheard voices just as he had done at that earlier time. One of the girls\r\nwho had been Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s companions was talking to a friend in a shed,\r\nhimself being the subject of discourse, possibly because they had seen\r\nhim in the distance. They were quite unaware that the shed-walls were\r\nso thin that he could hear their words as he passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowsomever, \xe2\x80\x99twas I put her up to it! \xe2\x80\x98Nothing venture nothing have,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI said. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she\xe2\x80\x99d no more have been his mis\xe2\x80\x99ess than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis my belief she knew there was nothing the matter when she told him\r\nshe was\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat had Arabella been put up to by this woman, so that he should make\r\nher his \xe2\x80\x9cmis\xe2\x80\x99ess,\xe2\x80\x9d otherwise wife? The suggestion was horridly\r\nunpleasant, and it rankled in his mind so much that instead of entering\r\nhis own cottage when he reached it he flung his basket inside the\r\ngarden-gate and passed on, determined to go and see his old aunt and\r\nget some supper there.\r\n\r\nThis made his arrival home rather late. Arabella however, was busy\r\nmelting down lard from fat of the deceased pig, for she had been out on\r\na jaunt all day, and so delayed her work. Dreading lest what he had\r\nheard should lead him to say something regrettable to her he spoke\r\nlittle. But Arabella was very talkative, and said among other things\r\nthat she wanted some money. Seeing the book sticking out of his pocket\r\nshe added that he ought to earn more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn apprentice\xe2\x80\x99s wages are not meant to be enough to keep a wife on, as\r\na rule, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Arabella! That\xe2\x80\x99s too bad, when you know how it came about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll declare afore Heaven that I thought what I told you was true.\r\nDoctor Vilbert thought so. It was a good job for you that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nso!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean before that time. I know\r\nit was not your fault; but those women friends of yours gave you bad\r\nadvice. If they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, or you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken it, we should at this\r\nmoment have been free from a bond which, not to mince matters, galls\r\nboth of us devilishly. It may be very sad, but it is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s been telling you about my friends? What advice? I insist upon\r\nyou telling me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you shall\xe2\x80\x94you ought to. It is mean of \xe2\x80\x99ee not to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d And he hinted gently what had been revealed to him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish to dwell upon it. Let us say no more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer defensive manner collapsed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laughing\r\ncoldly. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery woman has a right to do such as that. The risk is hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite deny it, Bella. She might if no lifelong penalty attached to\r\nit for the man, or, in his default, for herself; if the weakness of the\r\nmoment could end with the moment, or even with the year. But when\r\neffects stretch so far she should not go and do that which entraps a\r\nman if he is honest, or herself if he is otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ought I to have done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiven me time\xe2\x80\xa6 Why do you fuss yourself about melting down that pig\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfat to-night? Please put it away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I must do it to-morrow morning. It won\xe2\x80\x99t keep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, which was Sunday, she resumed operations about ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock; and the renewed work recalled the conversation which had\r\naccompanied it the night before, and put her back into the same\r\nintractable temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the story about me in Marygreen, is it\xe2\x80\x94that I entrapped \xe2\x80\x99ee?\r\nMuch of a catch you were, Lord send!\xe2\x80\x9d As she warmed she saw some of\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s dear ancient classics on a table where they ought not to have\r\nbeen laid. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have them books here in the way!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried\r\npetulantly; and seizing them one by one she began throwing them upon\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave my books alone!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might have thrown them aside if\r\nyou had liked, but as to soiling them like that, it is disgusting!\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\nthe operation of making lard Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s hands had become smeared with\r\nthe hot grease, and her fingers consequently left very perceptible\r\nimprints on the book-covers. She continued deliberately to toss the\r\nbooks severally upon the floor, till Jude, incensed beyond bearing,\r\ncaught her by the arms to make her leave off. Somehow, in going so, he\r\nloosened the fastening of her hair, and it rolled about her ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPromise to leave the books alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPromise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a pause: \xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude relinquished his hold, and she crossed the room to the door, out\r\nof which she went with a set face, and into the highway. Here she began\r\nto saunter up and down, perversely pulling her hair into a worse\r\ndisorder than he had caused, and unfastening several buttons of her\r\ngown. It was a fine Sunday morning, dry, clear and frosty, and the\r\nbells of Alfredston Church could be heard on the breeze from the north.\r\nPeople were going along the road, dressed in their holiday clothes;\r\nthey were mainly lovers\xe2\x80\x94such pairs as Jude and Arabella had been when\r\nthey sported along the same track some months earlier. These\r\npedestrians turned to stare at the extraordinary spectacle she now\r\npresented, bonnetless, her dishevelled hair blowing in the wind, her\r\nbodice apart, her sleeves rolled above her elbows for her work, and her\r\nhands reeking with melted fat. One of the passers said in mock terror:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord deliver us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how he\xe2\x80\x99s served me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cMaking me work Sunday mornings\r\nwhen I ought to be going to my church, and tearing my hair off my head,\r\nand my gown off my back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude was exasperated, and went out to drag her in by main force. Then\r\nhe suddenly lost his heat. Illuminated with the sense that all was over\r\nbetween them, and that it mattered not what she did, or he, her husband\r\nstood still, regarding her. Their lives were ruined, he thought; ruined\r\nby the fundamental error of their matrimonial union: that of having\r\nbased a permanent contract on a temporary feeling which had no\r\nnecessary connection with affinities that alone render a lifelong\r\ncomradeship tolerable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to ill-use me on principle, as your father ill-used your mother,\r\nand your father\xe2\x80\x99s sister ill-used her husband?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAll you be\r\na queer lot as husbands and wives!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude fixed an arrested, surprised look on her. But she said no more,\r\nand continued her saunter till she was tired. He left the spot, and,\r\nafter wandering vaguely a little while, walked in the direction of\r\nMarygreen. Here he called upon his great-aunt, whose infirmities daily\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt\xe2\x80\x94did my father ill-use my mother, and my aunt her husband?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJude abruptly, sitting down by the fire.\r\n\r\nShe raised her ancient eyes under the rim of the by-gone bonnet that\r\nshe always wore. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s been telling you that?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard it spoken of, and want to know all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou med so well, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose; though your wife\xe2\x80\x94I reckon \xe2\x80\x99twas she\xe2\x80\x94must\r\nhave been a fool to open up that! There isn\xe2\x80\x99t much to know after all.\r\nYour father and mother couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get on together, and they parted. It\r\nwas coming home from Alfredston market, when you were a baby\xe2\x80\x94on the\r\nhill by the Brown House barn\xe2\x80\x94that they had their last difference, and\r\ntook leave of one another for the last time. Your mother soon\r\nafterwards died\xe2\x80\x94she drowned herself, in short, and your father went\r\naway with you to South Wessex, and never came here any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude recalled his father\xe2\x80\x99s silence about North Wessex and Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother, never speaking of either till his dying day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the same with your father\xe2\x80\x99s sister. Her husband offended her,\r\nand she so disliked living with him afterwards that she went away to\r\nLondon with her little maid. The Fawleys were not made for wedlock: it\r\nnever seemed to sit well upon us. There\xe2\x80\x99s sommat in our blood that\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t take kindly to the notion of being bound to do what we do readily\r\nenough if not bound. That\xe2\x80\x99s why you ought to have hearkened to me, and\r\nnot ha\xe2\x80\x99 married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did Father and Mother part\xe2\x80\x94by the Brown House, did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little further on\xe2\x80\x94where the road to Fenworth branches off, and the\r\nhandpost stands. A gibbet once stood there not onconnected with our\r\nhistory. But let that be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the dusk of that evening Jude walked away from his old aunt\xe2\x80\x99s as if\r\nto go home. But as soon as he reached the open down he struck out upon\r\nit till he came to a large round pond. The frost continued, though it\r\nwas not particularly sharp, and the larger stars overhead came out slow\r\nand flickering. Jude put one foot on the edge of the ice, and then the\r\nother: it cracked under his weight; but this did not deter him. He\r\nploughed his way inward to the centre, the ice making sharp noises as\r\nhe went. When just about the middle he looked around him and gave a\r\njump. The cracking repeated itself; but he did not go down. He jumped\r\nagain, but the cracking had ceased. Jude went back to the edge, and\r\nstepped upon the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was curious, he thought. What was he reserved for? He supposed he\r\nwas not a sufficiently dignified person for suicide. Peaceful death\r\nabhorred him as a subject, and would not take him.\r\n\r\nWhat could he do of a lower kind than self-extermination; what was\r\nthere less noble, more in keeping with his present degraded position?\r\nHe could get drunk. Of course that was it; he had forgotten. Drinking\r\nwas the regular, stereotyped resource of the despairing worthless. He\r\nbegan to see now why some men boozed at inns. He struck down the hill\r\nnorthwards and came to an obscure public-house. On entering and sitting\r\ndown the sight of the picture of Samson and Delilah on the wall caused\r\nhim to recognize the place as that he had visited with Arabella on that\r\nfirst Sunday evening of their courtship. He called for liquor and drank\r\nbriskly for an hour or more.\r\n\r\nStaggering homeward late that night, with all his sense of depression\r\ngone, and his head fairly clear still, he began to laugh boisterously,\r\nand to wonder how Arabella would receive him in his new aspect. The\r\nhouse was in darkness when he entered, and in his stumbling state it\r\nwas some time before he could get a light. Then he found that, though\r\nthe marks of pig-dressing, of fats and scallops, were visible, the\r\nmaterials themselves had been taken away. A line written by his wife on\r\nthe inside of an old envelope was pinned to the cotton blower of the\r\nfireplace:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Have gone to my friends. Shall not return._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the next day he remained at home, and sent off the carcase of the\r\npig to Alfredston. He then cleaned up the premises, locked the door,\r\nput the key in a place she would know if she came back, and returned to\r\nhis masonry at Alfredston.\r\n\r\nAt night when he again plodded home he found she had not visited the\r\nhouse. The next day went in the same way, and the next. Then there came\r\na letter from her.\r\n\r\nThat she had gone tired of him she frankly admitted. He was such a slow\r\nold coach, and she did not care for the sort of life he led. There was\r\nno prospect of his ever bettering himself or her. She further went on\r\nto say that her parents had, as he knew, for some time considered the\r\nquestion of emigrating to Australia, the pig-jobbing business being a\r\npoor one nowadays. They had at last decided to go, and she proposed to\r\ngo with them, if he had no objection. A woman of her sort would have\r\nmore chance over there than in this stupid country.\r\n\r\nJude replied that he had not the least objection to her going. He\r\nthought it a wise course, since she wished to go, and one that might be\r\nto the advantage of both. He enclosed in the packet containing the\r\nletter the money that had been realized by the sale of the pig, with\r\nall he had besides, which was not much.\r\n\r\nFrom that day he heard no more of her except indirectly, though her\r\nfather and his household did not immediately leave, but waited till his\r\ngoods and other effects had been sold off. When Jude learnt that there\r\nwas to be an auction at the house of the Donns he packed his own\r\nhousehold goods into a waggon, and sent them to her at the aforesaid\r\nhomestead, that she might sell them with the rest, or as many of them\r\nas she should choose.\r\n\r\nHe then went into lodgings at Alfredston, and saw in a shopwindow the\r\nlittle handbill announcing the sale of his father-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s furniture.\r\nHe noted its date, which came and passed without Jude\xe2\x80\x99s going near the\r\nplace, or perceiving that the traffic out of Alfredston by the southern\r\nroad was materially increased by the auction. A few days later he\r\nentered a dingy broker\xe2\x80\x99s shop in the main street of the town, and amid\r\na heterogeneous collection of saucepans, a clothes-horse, rolling-pin,\r\nbrass candlestick, swing looking-glass, and other things at the back of\r\nthe shop, evidently just brought in from a sale, he perceived a framed\r\nphotograph, which turned out to be his own portrait.\r\n\r\nIt was one which he had had specially taken and framed by a local man\r\nin bird\xe2\x80\x99s-eye maple, as a present for Arabella, and had duly given her\r\non their wedding-day. On the back was still to be read, \xe2\x80\x9c_Jude to\r\nArabella_,\xe2\x80\x9d with the date. She must have thrown it in with the rest of\r\nher property at the auction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the broker, seeing him look at this and the other articles\r\nin the heap, and not perceiving that the portrait was of himself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis a small lot of stuff that was knocked down to me at a cottage sale\r\nout on the road to Marygreen. The frame is a very useful one, if you\r\ntake out the likeness. You shall have it for a shilling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe utter death of every tender sentiment in his wife, as brought home\r\nto him by this mute and undesigned evidence of her sale of his portrait\r\nand gift, was the conclusive little stroke required to demolish all\r\nsentiment in him. He paid the shilling, took the photograph away with\r\nhim, and burnt it, frame and all, when he reached his lodging.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days later he heard that Arabella and her parents had\r\ndeparted. He had sent a message offering to see her for a formal\r\nleave-taking, but she had said that it would be better otherwise, since\r\nshe was bent on going, which perhaps was true. On the evening following\r\ntheir emigration, when his day\xe2\x80\x99s work was done, he came out of doors\r\nafter supper, and strolled in the starlight along the too familiar road\r\ntowards the upland whereon had been experienced the chief emotions of\r\nhis life. It seemed to be his own again.\r\n\r\nHe could not realize himself. On the old track he seemed to be a boy\r\nstill, hardly a day older than when he had stood dreaming at the top of\r\nthat hill, inwardly fired for the first time with ardours for\r\nChristminster and scholarship. \xe2\x80\x9cYet I am a man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a\r\nwife. More, I have arrived at the still riper stage of having disagreed\r\nwith her, disliked her, had a scuffle with her, and parted from her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remembered then that he was standing not far from the spot at which\r\nthe parting between his father and his mother was said to have\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nA little further on was the summit whence Christminster, or what he had\r\ntaken for that city, had seemed to be visible. A milestone, now as\r\nalways, stood at the roadside hard by. Jude drew near it, and felt\r\nrather than read the mileage to the city. He remembered that once on\r\nhis way home he had proudly cut with his keen new chisel an inscription\r\non the back of that milestone, embodying his aspirations. It had been\r\ndone in the first week of his apprenticeship, before he had been\r\ndiverted from his purposes by an unsuitable woman. He wondered if the\r\ninscription were legible still, and going to the back of the milestone\r\nbrushed away the nettles. By the light of a match he could still\r\ndiscern what he had cut so enthusiastically so long ago:\r\n\r\n[THITHER\xe2\x80\x94J. F. [with a pointing finger]]\r\n\r\nThe sight of it, unimpaired, within its screen of grass and nettles,\r\nlit in his soul a spark of the old fire. Surely his plan should be to\r\nmove onward through good and ill\xe2\x80\x94to avoid morbid sorrow even though he\r\ndid see uglinesses in the world? _Bene agere et l\xc3\xa6tari_\xe2\x80\x94to do good\r\ncheerfully\xe2\x80\x94which he had heard to be the philosophy of one Spinoza,\r\nmight be his own even now.\r\n\r\nHe might battle with his evil star, and follow out his original\r\nintention.\r\n\r\nBy moving to a spot a little way off he uncovered the horizon in a\r\nnorth-easterly direction. There actually rose the faint halo, a small\r\ndim nebulousness, hardly recognizable save by the eye of faith. It was\r\nenough for him. He would go to Christminster as soon as the term of his\r\napprenticeship expired.\r\n\r\nHe returned to his lodgings in a better mood, and said his prayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Second AT CHRISTMINSTER\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cSave his own soul he hath no star.\xe2\x80\x9d_\xe2\x80\x94SWINBURNE.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cNotitiam primosque gradus vicinia fecit;\r\nTempore crevit amor.\xe2\x80\x9d_\xe2\x80\x94OVID.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next noteworthy move in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s life was that in which he appeared\r\ngliding steadily onward through a dusky landscape of some three years\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlater leafage than had graced his courtship of Arabella, and the\r\ndisruption of his coarse conjugal life with her. He was walking towards\r\nChristminster City, at a point a mile or two to the south-west of it.\r\n\r\nHe had at last found himself clear of Marygreen and Alfredston: he was\r\nout of his apprenticeship, and with his tools at his back seemed to be\r\nin the way of making a new start\xe2\x80\x94the start to which, barring the\r\ninterruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with\r\nArabella, he had been looking forward for about ten years.\r\n\r\nJude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible,\r\nmeditative, and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance. He\r\nwas of dark complexion, with dark harmonizing eyes, and he wore a\r\nclosely trimmed black beard of more advanced growth than is usual at\r\nhis age; this, with his great mass of black curly hair, was some\r\ntrouble to him in combing and washing out the stone-dust that settled\r\non it in the pursuit of his trade. His capabilities in the latter,\r\nhaving been acquired in the country, were of an all-round sort,\r\nincluding monumental stone-cutting, gothic free-stone work for the\r\nrestoration of churches, and carving of a general kind. In London he\r\nwould probably have become specialized and have made himself a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmoulding mason,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cfoliage sculptor\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a \xe2\x80\x9cstatuary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had that afternoon driven in a cart from Alfredston to the village\r\nnearest the city in this direction, and was now walking the remaining\r\nfour miles rather from choice than from necessity, having always\r\nfancied himself arriving thus.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate impulse to come had had a curious origin\xe2\x80\x94one more nearly\r\nrelated to the emotional side of him than to the intellectual, as is\r\noften the case with young men. One day while in lodgings at Alfredston\r\nhe had gone to Marygreen to see his old aunt, and had observed between\r\nthe brass candlesticks on her mantlepiece the photograph of a pretty\r\ngirlish face, in a broad hat with radiating folds under the brim like\r\nthe rays of a halo. He had asked who she was. His grand-aunt had\r\ngruffly replied that she was his cousin Sue Bridehead, of the inimical\r\nbranch of the family; and on further questioning the old woman had\r\nreplied that the girl lived in Christminster, though she did not know\r\nwhere, or what she was doing.\r\n\r\nHis aunt would not give him the photograph. But it haunted him; and\r\nultimately formed a quickening ingredient in his latent intent of\r\nfollowing his friend the school master thither.\r\n\r\nHe now paused at the top of a crooked and gentle declivity, and\r\nobtained his first near view of the city. Grey-stoned and dun-roofed,\r\nit stood within hail of the Wessex border, and almost with the tip of\r\none small toe within it, at the northernmost point of the crinkled line\r\nalong which the leisurely Thames strokes the fields of that ancient\r\nkingdom. The buildings now lay quiet in the sunset, a vane here and\r\nthere on their many spires and domes giving sparkle to a picture of\r\nsober secondary and tertiary hues.\r\n\r\nReaching the bottom he moved along the level way between pollard\r\nwillows growing indistinct in the twilight, and soon confronted the\r\noutmost lamps of the town\xe2\x80\x94some of those lamps which had sent into the\r\nsky the gleam and glory that caught his strained gaze in his days of\r\ndreaming, so many years ago. They winked their yellow eyes at him\r\ndubiously, and as if, though they had been awaiting him all these years\r\nin disappointment at his tarrying, they did not much want him now.\r\n\r\nHe was a species of Dick Whittington whose spirit was touched to finer\r\nissues than a mere material gain. He went along the outlying streets\r\nwith the cautious tread of an explorer. He saw nothing of the real city\r\nin the suburbs on this side. His first want being a lodging he\r\nscrutinized carefully such localities as seemed to offer on inexpensive\r\nterms the modest type of accommodation he demanded; and after inquiry\r\ntook a room in a suburb nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cBeersheba,\xe2\x80\x9d though he did not know\r\nthis at the time. Here he installed himself, and having had some tea\r\nsallied forth.\r\n\r\nIt was a windy, whispering, moonless night. To guide himself he opened\r\nunder a lamp a map he had brought. The breeze ruffled and fluttered it,\r\nbut he could see enough to decide on the direction he should take to\r\nreach the heart of the place.\r\n\r\nAfter many turnings he came up to the first ancient medi\xc3\xa6val pile that\r\nhe had encountered. It was a college, as he could see by the gateway.\r\nHe entered it, walked round, and penetrated to dark corners which no\r\nlamplight reached. Close to this college was another; and a little\r\nfurther on another; and then he began to be encircled as it were with\r\nthe breath and sentiment of the venerable city. When he passed objects\r\nout of harmony with its general expression he allowed his eyes to slip\r\nover them as if he did not see them.\r\n\r\nA bell began clanging, and he listened till a hundred-and-one strokes\r\nhad sounded. He must have made a mistake, he thought: it was meant for\r\na hundred.\r\n\r\nWhen the gates were shut, and he could no longer get into the\r\nquadrangles, he rambled under the walls and doorways, feeling with his\r\nfingers the contours of their mouldings and carving. The minutes\r\npassed, fewer and fewer people were visible, and still he serpentined\r\namong the shadows, for had he not imagined these scenes through ten\r\nbygone years, and what mattered a night\xe2\x80\x99s rest for once? High against\r\nthe black sky the flash of a lamp would show crocketed pinnacles and\r\nindented battlements. Down obscure alleys, apparently never trodden now\r\nby the foot of man, and whose very existence seemed to be forgotten,\r\nthere would jut into the path porticoes, oriels, doorways of enriched\r\nand florid middle-age design, their extinct air being accentuated by\r\nthe rottenness of the stones. It seemed impossible that modern thought\r\ncould house itself in such decrepit and superseded chambers.\r\n\r\nKnowing not a human being here, Jude began to be impressed with the\r\nisolation of his own personality, as with a self-spectre, the sensation\r\nbeing that of one who walked but could not make himself seen or heard.\r\nHe drew his breath pensively, and, seeming thus almost his own ghost,\r\ngave his thoughts to the other ghostly presences with which the nooks\r\nwere haunted.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval of preparation for this venture, since his wife and\r\nfurniture\xe2\x80\x99s uncompromising disappearance into space, he had read and\r\nlearnt almost all that could be read and learnt by one in his position,\r\nof the worthies who had spent their youth within these reverend walls,\r\nand whose souls had haunted them in their maturer age. Some of them, by\r\nthe accidents of his reading, loomed out in his fancy\r\ndisproportionately large by comparison with the rest. The brushings of\r\nthe wind against the angles, buttresses, and door-jambs were as the\r\npassing of these only other inhabitants, the tappings of each ivy leaf\r\non its neighbour were as the mutterings of their mournful souls, the\r\nshadows as their thin shapes in nervous movement, making him comrades\r\nin his solitude. In the gloom it was as if he ran against them without\r\nfeeling their bodily frames.\r\n\r\nThe streets were now deserted, but on account of these things he could\r\nnot go in. There were poets abroad, of early date and of late, from the\r\nfriend and eulogist of Shakespeare down to him who has recently passed\r\ninto silence, and that musical one of the tribe who is still among us.\r\nSpeculative philosophers drew along, not always with wrinkled foreheads\r\nand hoary hair as in framed portraits, but pink-faced, slim, and active\r\nas in youth; modern divines sheeted in their surplices, among whom the\r\nmost real to Jude Fawley were the founders of the religious school\r\ncalled Tractarian; the well-known three, the enthusiast, the poet, and\r\nthe formularist, the echoes of whose teachings had influenced him even\r\nin his obscure home. A start of aversion appeared in his fancy to move\r\nthem at sight of those other sons of the place, the form in the\r\nfull-bottomed wig, statesman, rake, reasoner, and sceptic; the smoothly\r\nshaven historian so ironically civil to Christianity; with others of\r\nthe same incredulous temper, who knew each quad as well as the\r\nfaithful, and took equal freedom in haunting its cloisters.\r\n\r\nHe regarded the statesmen in their various types, men of firmer\r\nmovement and less dreamy air; the scholar, the speaker, the plodder;\r\nthe man whose mind grew with his growth in years, and the man whose\r\nmind contracted with the same.\r\n\r\nThe scientists and philologists followed on in his mind-sight in an odd\r\nimpossible combination, men of meditative faces, strained foreheads,\r\nand weak-eyed as bats with constant research; then official\r\ncharacters\xe2\x80\x94such men as governor-generals and lord-lieutenants, in whom\r\nhe took little interest; chief-justices and lord chancellors, silent\r\nthin-lipped figures of whom he knew barely the names. A keener regard\r\nattached to the prelates, by reason of his own former hopes. Of them he\r\nhad an ample band\xe2\x80\x94some men of heart, others rather men of head; he who\r\napologized for the Church in Latin; the saintly author of the Evening\r\nHymn; and near them the great itinerant preacher, hymn-writer, and\r\nzealot, shadowed like Jude by his matrimonial difficulties.\r\n\r\nJude found himself speaking out loud, holding conversations with them\r\nas it were, like an actor in a melodrama who apostrophizes the audience\r\non the other side of the footlights; till he suddenly ceased with a\r\nstart at his absurdity. Perhaps those incoherent words of the wanderer\r\nwere heard within the walls by some student or thinker over his lamp;\r\nand he may have raised his head, and wondered what voice it was, and\r\nwhat it betokened. Jude now perceived that, so far as solid flesh went,\r\nhe had the whole aged city to himself with the exception of a belated\r\ntownsman here and there, and that he seemed to be catching a cold.\r\n\r\nA voice reached him out of the shade; a real and local voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-settin\xe2\x80\x99 a long time on that plinth-stone, young man.\r\nWhat med you be up to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt came from a policeman who had been observing Jude without the latter\r\nobserving him.\r\n\r\nJude went home and to bed, after reading up a little about these men\r\nand their several messages to the world from a book or two that he had\r\nbrought with him concerning the sons of the university. As he drew\r\ntowards sleep various memorable words of theirs that he had just been\r\nconning seemed spoken by them in muttering utterances; some audible,\r\nsome unintelligible to him. One of the spectres (who afterwards mourned\r\nChristminster as \xe2\x80\x9cthe home of lost causes,\xe2\x80\x9d though Jude did not\r\nremember this) was now apostrophizing her thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful city! so venerable, so lovely, so unravaged by the fierce\r\nintellectual life of our century, so serene! \xe2\x80\xa6 Her ineffable charm\r\nkeeps ever calling us to the true goal of all of us, to the ideal, to\r\nperfection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother voice was that of the Corn Law convert, whose phantom he had\r\njust seen in the quadrangle with a great bell. Jude thought his soul\r\nmight have been shaping the historic words of his master-speech:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, I may be wrong, but my impression is that my duty towards a\r\ncountry threatened with famine requires that that which has been the\r\nordinary remedy under all similar circumstances should be resorted to\r\nnow, namely, that there should be free access to the food of man from\r\nwhatever quarter it may come\xe2\x80\xa6 Deprive me of office to-morrow, you can\r\nnever deprive me of the consciousness that I have exercised the powers\r\ncommitted to me from no corrupt or interested motives, from no desire\r\nto gratify ambition, for no personal gain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the sly author of the immortal Chapter on Christianity: \xe2\x80\x9cHow shall\r\nwe excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and philosophic world, to\r\nthose evidences [miracles] which were presented by Omnipotence? \xe2\x80\xa6 The\r\nsages of Greece and Rome turned aside from the awful spectacle, and\r\nappeared unconscious of any alterations in the moral or physical\r\ngovernment of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the shade of the poet, the last of the optimists:\r\n\r\nHow the world is made for each of us!\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nAnd each of the Many helps to recruit\r\nThe life of the race by a general plan.\r\n\r\nThen one of the three enthusiasts he had seen just now, the author of\r\nthe _Apologia_:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy argument was \xe2\x80\xa6 that absolute certitude as to the truths of natural\r\ntheology was the result of an assemblage of concurring and converging\r\nprobabilities \xe2\x80\xa6 that probabilities which did not reach to logical\r\ncertainty might create a mental certitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe second of them, no polemic, murmured quieter things:\r\n\r\nWhy should we faint, and fear to live alone,\r\nSince all alone, so Heaven has will\xe2\x80\x99d, we die?\r\n\r\nHe likewise heard some phrases spoken by the phantom with the short\r\nface, the genial Spectator:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I look upon the tombs of the great, every motion of envy dies in\r\nme; when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire\r\ngoes out; when I meet with the grief of parents upon a tombstone, my\r\nheart melts with compassion; when I see the tombs of the parents\r\nthemselves, I consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we must\r\nquickly follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd lastly a gentle-voiced prelate spoke, during whose meek, familiar\r\nrhyme, endeared to him from earliest childhood, Jude fell asleep:\r\n\r\nTeach me to live, that I may dread\r\nThe grave as little as my bed.\r\nTeach me to die\xe2\x80\xa6\r\n\r\nHe did not wake till morning. The ghostly past seemed to have gone, and\r\neverything spoke of to-day. He started up in bed, thinking he had\r\noverslept himself and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove\xe2\x80\x94I had quite forgotten my sweet-faced cousin, and that she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhere all the time! \xe2\x80\xa6 and my old schoolmaster, too.\xe2\x80\x9d His words about his\r\nschoolmaster had, perhaps, less zest in them than his words concerning\r\nhis cousin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nNecessary meditations on the actual, including the mean\r\nbread-and-cheese question, dissipated the phantasmal for a while, and\r\ncompelled Jude to smother high thinkings under immediate needs. He had\r\nto get up, and seek for work, manual work; the only kind deemed by many\r\nof its professors to be work at all.\r\n\r\nPassing out into the streets on this errand he found that the colleges\r\nhad treacherously changed their sympathetic countenances: some were\r\npompous; some had put on the look of family vaults above ground;\r\nsomething barbaric loomed in the masonries of all. The spirits of the\r\ngreat men had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe numberless architectural pages around him he read, naturally, less\r\nas an artist-critic of their forms than as an artizan and comrade of\r\nthe dead handicraftsmen whose muscles had actually executed those\r\nforms. He examined the mouldings, stroked them as one who knew their\r\nbeginning, said they were difficult or easy in the working, had taken\r\nlittle or much time, were trying to the arm, or convenient to the tool.\r\n\r\nWhat at night had been perfect and ideal was by day the more or less\r\ndefective real. Cruelties, insults, had, he perceived, been inflicted\r\non the aged erections. The condition of several moved him as he would\r\nhave been moved by maimed sentient beings. They were wounded, broken,\r\nsloughing off their outer shape in the deadly struggle against years,\r\nweather, and man.\r\n\r\nThe rottenness of these historical documents reminded him that he was\r\nnot, after all, hastening on to begin the morning practically as he had\r\nintended. He had come to work, and to live by work, and the morning had\r\nnearly gone. It was, in one sense, encouraging to think that in a place\r\nof crumbling stones there must be plenty for one of his trade to do in\r\nthe business of renovation. He asked his way to the workyard of the\r\nstone-mason whose name had been given him at Alfredston; and soon heard\r\nthe familiar sound of the rubbers and chisels.\r\n\r\nThe yard was a little centre of regeneration. Here, with keen edges and\r\nsmooth curves, were forms in the exact likeness of those he had seen\r\nabraded and time-eaten on the walls. These were the ideas in modern\r\nprose which the lichened colleges presented in old poetry. Even some of\r\nthose antiques might have been called prose when they were new. They\r\nhad done nothing but wait, and had become poetical. How easy to the\r\nsmallest building; how impossible to most men.\r\n\r\nHe asked for the foreman, and looked round among the new traceries,\r\nmullions, transoms, shafts, pinnacles, and battlements standing on the\r\nbankers half worked, or waiting to be removed. They were marked by\r\nprecision, mathematical straightness, smoothness, exactitude: there in\r\nthe old walls were the broken lines of the original idea; jagged\r\ncurves, disdain of precision, irregularity, disarray.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there fell on Jude a true illumination; that here in the\r\nstone yard was a centre of effort as worthy as that dignified by the\r\nname of scholarly study within the noblest of the colleges. But he lost\r\nit under stress of his old idea. He would accept any employment which\r\nmight be offered him on the strength of his late employer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecommendation; but he would accept it as a provisional thing only.\r\nThis was his form of the modern vice of unrest.\r\n\r\nMoreover he perceived that at best only copying, patching and imitating\r\nwent on here; which he fancied to be owing to some temporary and local\r\ncause. He did not at that time see that medi\xc3\xa6valism was as dead as a\r\nfern-leaf in a lump of coal; that other developments were shaping in\r\nthe world around him, in which Gothic architecture and its associations\r\nhad no place. The deadly animosity of contemporary logic and vision\r\ntowards so much of what he held in reverence was not yet revealed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHaving failed to obtain work here as yet he went away, and thought\r\nagain of his cousin, whose presence somewhere at hand he seemed to feel\r\nin wavelets of interest, if not of emotion. How he wished he had that\r\npretty portrait of her! At last he wrote to his aunt to send it. She\r\ndid so, with a request, however, that he was not to bring disturbance\r\ninto the family by going to see the girl or her relations. Jude, a\r\nridiculously affectionate fellow, promised nothing, put the photograph\r\non the mantel-piece, kissed it\xe2\x80\x94he did not know why\xe2\x80\x94and felt more at\r\nhome. She seemed to look down and preside over his tea. It was\r\ncheering\xe2\x80\x94the one thing uniting him to the emotions of the living city.\r\n\r\nThere remained the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x94probably now a reverend parson. But he\r\ncould not possibly hunt up such a respectable man just yet; so raw and\r\nunpolished was his condition, so precarious were his fortunes. Thus he\r\nstill remained in loneliness. Although people moved round him he\r\nvirtually saw none. Not as yet having mingled with the active life of\r\nthe place it was largely non-existent to him. But the saints and\r\nprophets in the window-tracery, the paintings in the galleries, the\r\nstatues, the busts, the gargoyles, the corbel-heads\xe2\x80\x94these seemed to\r\nbreathe his atmosphere. Like all newcomers to a spot on which the past\r\nis deeply graven he heard that past announcing itself with an emphasis\r\naltogether unsuspected by, and even incredible to, the habitual\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\nFor many days he haunted the cloisters and quadrangles of the colleges\r\nat odd minutes in passing them, surprised by impish echoes of his own\r\nfootsteps, smart as the blows of a mallet. The Christminster\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csentiment,\xe2\x80\x9d as it had been called, ate further and further into him;\r\ntill he probably knew more about those buildings materially,\r\nartistically, and historically, than any one of their inmates.\r\n\r\nIt was not till now, when he found himself actually on the spot of his\r\nenthusiasm, that Jude perceived how far away from the object of that\r\nenthusiasm he really was. Only a wall divided him from those happy\r\nyoung contemporaries of his with whom he shared a common mental life;\r\nmen who had nothing to do from morning till night but to read, mark,\r\nlearn, and inwardly digest. Only a wall\xe2\x80\x94but what a wall!\r\n\r\nEvery day, every hour, as he went in search of labour, he saw them\r\ngoing and coming also, rubbed shoulders with them, heard their voices,\r\nmarked their movements. The conversation of some of the more thoughtful\r\namong them seemed oftentimes, owing to his long and persistent\r\npreparation for this place, to be peculiarly akin to his own thoughts.\r\nYet he was as far from them as if he had been at the antipodes. Of\r\ncourse he was. He was a young workman in a white blouse, and with\r\nstone-dust in the creases of his clothes; and in passing him they did\r\nnot even see him, or hear him, rather saw through him as through a pane\r\nof glass at their familiars beyond. Whatever they were to him, he to\r\nthem was not on the spot at all; and yet he had fancied he would be\r\nclose to their lives by coming there.\r\n\r\nBut the future lay ahead after all; and if he could only be so\r\nfortunate as to get into good employment he would put up with the\r\ninevitable. So he thanked God for his health and strength, and took\r\ncourage. For the present he was outside the gates of everything,\r\ncolleges included: perhaps some day he would be inside. Those palaces\r\nof light and leading; he might some day look down on the world through\r\ntheir panes.\r\n\r\nAt length he did receive a message from the stone-mason\xe2\x80\x99s yard\xe2\x80\x94that a\r\njob was waiting for him. It was his first encouragement, and he closed\r\nwith the offer promptly.\r\n\r\nHe was young and strong, or he never could have executed with such zest\r\nthe undertakings to which he now applied himself, since they involved\r\nreading most of the night after working all the day. First he bought a\r\nshaded lamp for four and six-pence, and obtained a good light. Then he\r\ngot pens, paper, and such other necessary books as he had been unable\r\nto obtain elsewhere. Then, to the consternation of his landlady, he\r\nshifted all the furniture of his room\xe2\x80\x94a single one for living and\r\nsleeping\xe2\x80\x94rigged up a curtain on a rope across the middle, to make a\r\ndouble chamber out of one, hung up a thick blind that nobody should\r\nknow how he was curtailing the hours of sleep, laid out his books, and\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\nHaving been deeply encumbered by marrying, getting a cottage, and\r\nbuying the furniture which had disappeared in the wake of his wife, he\r\nhad never been able to save any money since the time of those\r\ndisastrous ventures, and till his wages began to come in he was obliged\r\nto live in the narrowest way. After buying a book or two he could not\r\neven afford himself a fire; and when the nights reeked with the raw and\r\ncold air from the Meadows he sat over his lamp in a great-coat, hat,\r\nand woollen gloves.\r\n\r\nFrom his window he could perceive the spire of the cathedral, and the\r\nogee dome under which resounded the great bell of the city. The tall\r\ntower, tall belfry windows, and tall pinnacles of the college by the\r\nbridge he could also get a glimpse of by going to the staircase. These\r\nobjects he used as stimulants when his faith in the future was dim.\r\n\r\nLike enthusiasts in general he made no inquiries into details of\r\nprocedure. Picking up general notions from casual acquaintance, he\r\nnever dwelt upon them. For the present, he said to himself, the one\r\nthing necessary was to get ready by accumulating money and knowledge,\r\nand await whatever chances were afforded to such an one of becoming a\r\nson of the University. \xe2\x80\x9cFor wisdom is a defence, and money is a\r\ndefence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to\r\nthem that have it.\xe2\x80\x9d His desire absorbed him, and left no part of him to\r\nweigh its practicability.\r\n\r\nAt this time he received a nervously anxious letter from his poor old\r\naunt, on the subject which had previously distressed her\xe2\x80\x94a fear that\r\nJude would not be strong-minded enough to keep away from his cousin Sue\r\nBridehead and her relations. Sue\xe2\x80\x99s father, his aunt believed, had gone\r\nback to London, but the girl remained at Christminster. To make her\r\nstill more objectionable, she was an artist or designer of some sort in\r\nwhat was called an ecclesiastical warehouse, which was a perfect\r\nseed-bed of idolatry, and she was no doubt abandoned to mummeries on\r\nthat account\xe2\x80\x94if not quite a Papist. (Miss Drusilla Fawley was of her\r\ndate, Evangelical.)\r\n\r\nAs Jude was rather on an intellectual track than a theological, this\r\nnews of Sue\xe2\x80\x99s probable opinions did not much influence him one way or\r\nthe other, but the clue to her whereabouts was decidedly interesting.\r\nWith an altogether singular pleasure he walked at his earliest spare\r\nminutes past the shops answering to his great-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s description; and\r\nbeheld in one of them a young girl sitting behind a desk, who was\r\nsuspiciously like the original of the portrait. He ventured to enter on\r\na trivial errand, and having made his purchase lingered on the scene.\r\nThe shop seemed to be kept entirely by women. It contained Anglican\r\nbooks, stationery, texts, and fancy goods: little plaster angels on\r\nbrackets, Gothic-framed pictures of saints, ebony crosses that were\r\nalmost crucifixes, prayer-books that were almost missals. He felt very\r\nshy of looking at the girl in the desk; she was so pretty that he could\r\nnot believe it possible that she should belong to him. Then she spoke\r\nto one of the two older women behind the counter; and he recognized in\r\nthe accents certain qualities of his own voice; softened and sweetened,\r\nbut his own. What was she doing? He stole a glance round. Before her\r\nlay a piece of zinc, cut to the shape of a scroll three or four feet\r\nlong, and coated with a dead-surface paint on one side. Hereon she was\r\ndesigning or illuminating, in characters of Church text, the single\r\nword\r\n\r\n[A L L E L U J A]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sweet, saintly, Christian business, hers!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\r\n\r\nHer presence here was now fairly enough explained, her skill in work of\r\nthis sort having no doubt been acquired from her father\xe2\x80\x99s occupation as\r\nan ecclesiastical worker in metal. The lettering on which she was\r\nengaged was clearly intended to be fixed up in some chancel to assist\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\nHe came out. It would have been easy to speak to her there and then,\r\nbut it seemed scarcely honourable towards his aunt to disregard her\r\nrequest so incontinently. She had used him roughly, but she had brought\r\nhim up: and the fact of her being powerless to control him lent a\r\npathetic force to a wish that would have been inoperative as an\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nSo Jude gave no sign. He would not call upon Sue just yet. He had other\r\nreasons against doing so when he had walked away. She seemed so dainty\r\nbeside himself in his rough working-jacket and dusty trousers that he\r\nfelt he was as yet unready to encounter her, as he had felt about Mr.\r\nPhillotson. And how possible it was that she had inherited the\r\nantipathies of her family, and would scorn him, as far as a Christian\r\ncould, particularly when he had told her that unpleasant part of his\r\nhistory which had resulted in his becoming enchained to one of her own\r\nsex whom she would certainly not admire.\r\n\r\nThus he kept watch over her, and liked to feel she was there. The\r\nconsciousness of her living presence stimulated him. But she remained\r\nmore or less an ideal character, about whose form he began to weave\r\ncurious and fantastic day-dreams.\r\n\r\nBetween two and three weeks afterwards Jude was engaged with some more\r\nmen, outside Crozier College in Old-time Street, in getting a block of\r\nworked freestone from a waggon across the pavement, before hoisting it\r\nto the parapet which they were repairing. Standing in position the head\r\nman said, \xe2\x80\x9cSpaik when he heave! He-ho!\xe2\x80\x9d And they heaved.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, as he lifted, his cousin stood close to his elbow,\r\npausing a moment on the bend of her foot till the obstructing object\r\nshould have been removed. She looked right into his face with liquid,\r\nuntranslatable eyes, that combined, or seemed to him to combine,\r\nkeenness with tenderness, and mystery with both, their expression, as\r\nwell as that of her lips, taking its life from some words just spoken\r\nto a companion, and being carried on into his face quite unconsciously.\r\nShe no more observed his presence than that of the dust-motes which his\r\nmanipulations raised into the sunbeams.\r\n\r\nHis closeness to her was so suggestive that he trembled, and turned his\r\nface away with a shy instinct to prevent her recognizing him, though as\r\nshe had never once seen him she could not possibly do so; and might\r\nvery well never have heard even his name. He could perceive that though\r\nshe was a country-girl at bottom, a latter girlhood of some years in\r\nLondon, and a womanhood here, had taken all rawness out of her.\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone he continued his work, reflecting on her. He had been\r\nso caught by her influence that he had taken no count of her general\r\nmould and build. He remembered now that she was not a large figure,\r\nthat she was light and slight, of the type dubbed elegant. That was\r\nabout all he had seen. There was nothing statuesque in her; all was\r\nnervous motion. She was mobile, living, yet a painter might not have\r\ncalled her handsome or beautiful. But the much that she was surprised\r\nhim. She was quite a long way removed from the rusticity that was his.\r\nHow could one of his cross-grained, unfortunate, almost accursed stock,\r\nhave contrived to reach this pitch of niceness? London had done it, he\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment the emotion which had been accumulating in his breast\r\nas the bottled-up effect of solitude and the poetized locality he dwelt\r\nin, insensibly began to precipitate itself on this half-visionary form;\r\nand he perceived that, whatever his obedient wish in a contrary\r\ndirection, he would soon be unable to resist the desire to make himself\r\nknown to her.\r\n\r\nHe affected to think of her quite in a family way, since there were\r\ncrushing reasons why he should not and could not think of her in any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe first reason was that he was married, and it would be wrong. The\r\nsecond was that they were cousins. It was not well for cousins to fall\r\nin love even when circumstances seemed to favour the passion. The\r\nthird: even were he free, in a family like his own where marriage\r\nusually meant a tragic sadness, marriage with a blood-relation would\r\nduplicate the adverse conditions, and a tragic sadness might be\r\nintensified to a tragic horror.\r\n\r\nTherefore, again, he would have to think of Sue with only a relation\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmutual interest in one belonging to him; regard her in a practical way\r\nas some one to be proud of; to talk and nod to; later on, to be invited\r\nto tea by, the emotion spent on her being rigorously that of a kinsman\r\nand well-wisher. So would she be to him a kindly star, an elevating\r\npower, a companion in Anglican worship, a tender friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBut under the various deterrent influences Jude\xe2\x80\x99s instinct was to\r\napproach her timidly, and the next Sunday he went to the morning\r\nservice in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College to gain a further\r\nview of her, for he had found that she frequently attended there.\r\n\r\nShe did not come, and he awaited her in the afternoon, which was finer.\r\nHe knew that if she came at all she would approach the building along\r\nthe eastern side of the great green quadrangle from which it was\r\naccessible, and he stood in a corner while the bell was going. A few\r\nminutes before the hour for service she appeared as one of the figures\r\nwalking along under the college walls, and at sight of her he advanced\r\nup the side opposite, and followed her into the building, more than\r\never glad that he had not as yet revealed himself. To see her, and to\r\nbe himself unseen and unknown, was enough for him at present.\r\n\r\nHe lingered awhile in the vestibule, and the service was some way\r\nadvanced when he was put into a seat. It was a louring, mournful, still\r\nafternoon, when a religion of some sort seems a necessity to ordinary\r\npractical men, and not only a luxury of the emotional and leisured\r\nclasses. In the dim light and the baffling glare of the clerestory\r\nwindows he could discern the opposite worshippers indistinctly only,\r\nbut he saw that Sue was among them. He had not long discovered the\r\nexact seat that she occupied when the chanting of the 119th Psalm in\r\nwhich the choir was engaged reached its second part, _In quo corriget_,\r\nthe organ changing to a pathetic Gregorian tune as the singers gave\r\nforth:\r\n\r\nWherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?\r\n\r\nIt was the very question that was engaging Jude\xe2\x80\x99s attention at this\r\nmoment. What a wicked worthless fellow he had been to give vent as he\r\nhad done to an animal passion for a woman, and allow it to lead to such\r\ndisastrous consequences; then to think of putting an end to himself;\r\nthen to go recklessly and get drunk. The great waves of pedal music\r\ntumbled round the choir, and, nursed on the supernatural as he had\r\nbeen, it is not wonderful that he could hardly believe that the psalm\r\nwas not specially set by some regardful Providence for this moment of\r\nhis first entry into the solemn building. And yet it was the ordinary\r\npsalm for the twenty-fourth evening of the month.\r\n\r\nThe girl for whom he was beginning to nourish an extraordinary\r\ntenderness was at this time ensphered by the same harmonies as those\r\nwhich floated into his ears; and the thought was a delight to him. She\r\nwas probably a frequenter of this place, and, steeped body and soul in\r\nchurch sentiment as she must be by occupation and habit, had, no doubt,\r\nmuch in common with him. To an impressionable and lonely young man the\r\nconsciousness of having at last found anchorage for his thoughts, which\r\npromised to supply both social and spiritual possibilities, was like\r\nthe dew of Hermon, and he remained throughout the service in a\r\nsustaining atmosphere of ecstasy.\r\n\r\nThough he was loth to suspect it, some people might have said to him\r\nthat the atmosphere blew as distinctly from Cyprus as from Galilee.\r\n\r\nJude waited till she had left her seat and passed under the screen\r\nbefore he himself moved. She did not look towards him, and by the time\r\nhe reached the door she was half-way down the broad path. Being dressed\r\nup in his Sunday suit he was inclined to follow her and reveal himself.\r\nBut he was not quite ready; and, alas, ought he to do so with the kind\r\nof feeling that was awakening in him?\r\n\r\nFor though it had seemed to have an ecclesiastical basis during the\r\nservice, and he had persuaded himself that such was the case, he could\r\nnot altogether be blind to the real nature of the magnetism. She was\r\nsuch a stranger that the kinship was affectation, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be! I, a man with a wife, must not know her!\xe2\x80\x9d Still Sue _was_ his\r\nown kin, and the fact of his having a wife, even though she was not in\r\nevidence in this hemisphere, might be a help in one sense. It would put\r\nall thought of a tender wish on his part out of Sue\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and make\r\nher intercourse with him free and fearless. It was with some heartache\r\nthat he saw how little he cared for the freedom and fearlessness that\r\nwould result in her from such knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome little time before the date of this service in the cathedral the\r\npretty, liquid-eyed, light-footed young woman, Sue Bridehead, had an\r\nafternoon\xe2\x80\x99s holiday, and leaving the ecclesiastical establishment in\r\nwhich she not only assisted but lodged, took a walk into the country\r\nwith a book in her hand. It was one of those cloudless days which\r\nsometimes occur in Wessex and elsewhere between days of cold and wet,\r\nas if intercalated by caprice of the weather-god. She went along for a\r\nmile or two until she came to much higher ground than that of the city\r\nshe had left behind her. The road passed between green fields, and\r\ncoming to a stile Sue paused there, to finish the page she was reading,\r\nand then looked back at the towers and domes and pinnacles new and old.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the stile, in the footpath, she beheld a foreigner\r\nwith black hair and a sallow face, sitting on the grass beside a large\r\nsquare board whereon were fixed, as closely as they could stand, a\r\nnumber of plaster statuettes, some of them bronzed, which he was\r\nre-arranging before proceeding with them on his way. They were in the\r\nmain reduced copies of ancient marbles, and comprised divinities of a\r\nvery different character from those the girl was accustomed to see\r\nportrayed, among them being a Venus of standard pattern, a Diana, and,\r\nof the other sex, Apollo, Bacchus, and Mars. Though the figures were\r\nmany yards away from her the south-west sun brought them out so\r\nbrilliantly against the green herbage that she could discern their\r\ncontours with luminous distinctness; and being almost in a line between\r\nherself and the church towers of the city they awoke in her an oddly\r\nforeign and contrasting set of ideas by comparison. The man rose, and,\r\nseeing her, politely took off his cap, and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI-i-i-mages!\xe2\x80\x9d in an\r\naccent that agreed with his appearance. In a moment he dexterously\r\nlifted upon his knee the great board with its assembled notabilities\r\ndivine and human, and raised it to the top of his head, bringing them\r\non to her and resting the board on the stile. First he offered her his\r\nsmaller wares\xe2\x80\x94the busts of kings and queens, then a minstrel, then a\r\nwinged Cupid. She shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much are these two?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, touching with her finger the Venus\r\nand the Apollo\xe2\x80\x94the largest figures on the tray.\r\n\r\nHe said she should have them for ten shillings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot afford that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue. She offered considerably less, and to\r\nher surprise the image-man drew them from their wire stay and handed\r\nthem over the stile. She clasped them as treasures.\r\n\r\nWhen they were paid for, and the man had gone, she began to be\r\nconcerned as to what she should do with them. They seemed so very large\r\nnow that they were in her possession, and so very naked. Being of a\r\nnervous temperament she trembled at her enterprise. When she handled\r\nthem the white pipeclay came off on her gloves and jacket. After\r\ncarrying them along a little way openly an idea came to her, and,\r\npulling some huge burdock leaves, parsley, and other rank growths from\r\nthe hedge, she wrapped up her burden as well as she could in these, so\r\nthat what she carried appeared to be an enormous armful of green stuff\r\ngathered by a zealous lover of nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, anything is better than those everlasting church fallals!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. But she was still in a trembling state, and seemed almost to wish\r\nshe had not bought the figures.\r\n\r\nOccasionally peeping inside the leaves to see that Venus\xe2\x80\x99s arm was not\r\nbroken, she entered with her heathen load into the most Christian city\r\nin the country by an obscure street running parallel to the main one,\r\nand round a corner to the side door of the establishment to which she\r\nwas attached. Her purchases were taken straight up to her own chamber,\r\nand she at once attempted to lock them in a box that was her very own\r\nproperty; but finding them too cumbersome she wrapped them in large\r\nsheets of brown paper, and stood them on the floor in a corner.\r\n\r\nThe mistress of the house, Miss Fontover, was an elderly lady in\r\nspectacles, dressed almost like an abbess; a dab at Ritual, as become\r\none of her business, and a worshipper at the ceremonial church of St.\r\nSilas, in the suburb of Beersheba before-mentioned, which Jude also had\r\nbegun to attend. She was the daughter of a clergyman in reduced\r\ncircumstances, and at his death, which had occurred several years\r\nbefore this date, she boldly avoided penury by taking over a little\r\nshop of church requisites and developing it to its present creditable\r\nproportions. She wore a cross and beads round her neck as her only\r\nornament, and knew the Christian Year by heart.\r\n\r\nShe now came to call Sue to tea, and, finding that the girl did not\r\nrespond for a moment, entered the room just as the other was hastily\r\nputting a string round each parcel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething you have been buying, Miss Bridehead?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, regarding\r\nthe enwrapped objects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94just something to ornament my room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I should have thought I had put enough here already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss\r\nFontover, looking round at the Gothic-framed prints of saints, the\r\nChurch-text scrolls, and other articles which, having become too stale\r\nto sell, had been used to furnish this obscure chamber. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\r\nHow bulky!\xe2\x80\x9d She tore a little hole, about as big as a wafer, in the\r\nbrown paper, and tried to peep in. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, statuary? Two figures? Where\r\ndid you get them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I bought them of a travelling man who sells casts\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo saints?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Peter and St.\xe2\x80\x94St. Mary Magdalen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94now come down to tea, and go and finish that organ-text, if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s light enough afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese little obstacles to the indulgence of what had been the merest\r\npassing fancy created in Sue a great zest for unpacking her objects and\r\nlooking at them; and at bedtime, when she was sure of being\r\nundisturbed, she unrobed the divinities in comfort. Placing the pair of\r\nfigures on the chest of drawers, a candle on each side of them, she\r\nwithdrew to the bed, flung herself down thereon, and began reading a\r\nbook she had taken from her box, which Miss Fontover knew nothing of.\r\nIt was a volume of Gibbon, and she read the chapter dealing with the\r\nreign of Julian the Apostate. Occasionally she looked up at the\r\nstatuettes, which appeared strange and out of place, there happening to\r\nbe a Calvary print hanging between them, and, as if the scene suggested\r\nthe action, she at length jumped up and withdrew another book from her\r\nbox\xe2\x80\x94a volume of verse\xe2\x80\x94and turned to the familiar poem\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThou hast conquered, O pale Galilean:\r\nThe world has grown grey from thy breath!\r\n\r\nwhich she read to the end. Presently she put out the candles,\r\nundressed, and finally extinguished her own light.\r\n\r\nShe was of an age which usually sleeps soundly, yet to-night she kept\r\nwaking up, and every time she opened her eyes there was enough diffused\r\nlight from the street to show her the white plaster figures, standing\r\non the chest of drawers in odd contrast to their environment of text\r\nand martyr, and the Gothic-framed Crucifix-picture that was only\r\ndiscernible now as a Latin cross, the figure thereon being obscured by\r\nthe shades.\r\n\r\nOn one of these occasions the church clocks struck some small hour. It\r\nfell upon the ears of another person who sat bending over his books at\r\na not very distant spot in the same city. Being Saturday night the\r\nmorrow was one on which Jude had not set his alarm-clock to call him at\r\nhis usually early time, and hence he had stayed up, as was his custom,\r\ntwo or three hours later than he could afford to do on any other day of\r\nthe week. Just then he was earnestly reading from his Griesbach\xe2\x80\x99s text.\r\nAt the very time that Sue was tossing and staring at her figures, the\r\npoliceman and belated citizens passing along under his window might\r\nhave heard, if they had stood still, strange syllables mumbled with\r\nfervour within\xe2\x80\x94words that had for Jude an indescribable enchantment:\r\ninexplicable sounds something like these:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_All hemin heis Theos ho Pater, ex hou ta panta, kai hemeis eis\r\nauton:_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTill the sounds rolled with reverent loudness, as a book was heard to\r\nclose:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Kai heis Kurios Iesous Christos, di hou ta panta kai hemeis di\r\nautou!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was a handy man at his trade, an all-round man, as artizans in\r\ncountry-towns are apt to be. In London the man who carves the boss or\r\nknob of leafage declines to cut the fragment of moulding which merges\r\nin that leafage, as if it were a degradation to do the second half of\r\none whole. When there was not much Gothic moulding for Jude to run, or\r\nmuch window-tracery on the bankers, he would go out lettering monuments\r\nor tombstones, and take a pleasure in the change of handiwork.\r\n\r\nThe next time that he saw her was when he was on a ladder executing a\r\njob of this sort inside one of the churches. There was a short morning\r\nservice, and when the parson entered Jude came down from his ladder,\r\nand sat with the half-dozen people forming the congregation, till the\r\nprayer should be ended, and he could resume his tapping. He did not\r\nobserve till the service was half over that one of the women was Sue,\r\nwho had perforce accompanied the elderly Miss Fontover thither.\r\n\r\nJude sat watching her pretty shoulders, her easy, curiously nonchalant\r\nrisings and sittings, and her perfunctory genuflexions, and thought\r\nwhat a help such an Anglican would have been to him in happier\r\ncircumstances. It was not so much his anxiety to get on with his work\r\nthat made him go up to it immediately the worshipers began to take\r\ntheir leave: it was that he dared not, in this holy spot, confront the\r\nwoman who was beginning to influence him in such an indescribable\r\nmanner. Those three enormous reasons why he must not attempt intimate\r\nacquaintance with Sue Bridehead, now that his interest in her had shown\r\nitself to be unmistakably of a sexual kind, loomed as stubbornly as\r\never. But it was also obvious that man could not live by work alone;\r\nthat the particular man Jude, at any rate, wanted something to love.\r\nSome men would have rushed incontinently to her, snatched the pleasure\r\nof easy friendship which she could hardly refuse, and have left the\r\nrest to chance. Not so Jude\xe2\x80\x94at first.\r\n\r\nBut as the days, and still more particularly the lonely evenings,\r\ndragged along, he found himself, to his moral consternation, to be\r\nthinking more of her instead of thinking less of her, and experiencing\r\na fearful bliss in doing what was erratic, informal, and unexpected.\r\nSurrounded by her influence all day, walking past the spots she\r\nfrequented, he was always thinking of her, and was obliged to own to\r\nhimself that his conscience was likely to be the loser in this battle.\r\n\r\nTo be sure she was almost an ideality to him still. Perhaps to know her\r\nwould be to cure himself of this unexpected and unauthorized passion. A\r\nvoice whispered that, though he desired to know her, he did not desire\r\nto be cured.\r\n\r\nThere was not the least doubt that from his own orthodox point of view\r\nthe situation was growing immoral. For Sue to be the loved one of a man\r\nwho was licensed by the laws of his country to love Arabella and none\r\nother unto his life\xe2\x80\x99s end, was a pretty bad second beginning when the\r\nman was bent on such a course as Jude purposed. This conviction was so\r\nreal with him that one day when, as was frequent, he was at work in a\r\nneighbouring village church alone, he felt it to be his duty to pray\r\nagainst his weakness. But much as he wished to be an exemplar in these\r\nthings he could not get on. It was quite impossible, he found, to ask\r\nto be delivered from temptation when your heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire was to be\r\ntempted unto seventy times seven. So he excused himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not altogether an _erotolepsy_ that is the matter with\r\nme, as at that first time. I can see that she is exceptionally bright;\r\nand it is partly a wish for intellectual sympathy, and a craving for\r\nloving-kindness in my solitude.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus he went on adoring her, fearing\r\nto realize that it was human perversity. For whatever Sue\xe2\x80\x99s virtues,\r\ntalents, or ecclesiastical saturation, it was certain that those items\r\nwere not at all the cause of his affection for her.\r\n\r\nOn an afternoon at this time a young girl entered the stone-mason\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyard with some hesitation, and, lifting her skirts to avoid draggling\r\nthem in the white dust, crossed towards the office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a nice girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men known as Uncle Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her about here and there. Why, yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndaughter of that clever chap Bridehead who did all the wrought ironwork\r\nat St. Silas\xe2\x80\x99 ten years ago, and went away to London afterwards. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing now\xe2\x80\x94not much I fancy\xe2\x80\x94as she\xe2\x80\x99s come back\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the young woman had knocked at the office door and asked if\r\nMr. Jude Fawley was at work in the yard. It so happened that Jude had\r\ngone out somewhere or other that afternoon, which information she\r\nreceived with a look of disappointment, and went away immediately. When\r\nJude returned they told him, and described her, whereupon he exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s my cousin Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked along the street after her, but she was out of sight. He had\r\nno longer any thought of a conscientious avoidance of her, and resolved\r\nto call upon her that very evening. And when he reached his lodging he\r\nfound a note from her\xe2\x80\x94a first note\xe2\x80\x94one of those documents which, simple\r\nand commonplace in themselves, are seen retrospectively to have been\r\npregnant with impassioned consequences. The very unconsciousness of a\r\nlooming drama which is shown in such innocent first epistles from women\r\nto men, or _vice versa_, makes them, when such a drama follows, and\r\nthey are read over by the purple or lurid light of it, all the more\r\nimpressive, solemn, and in cases, terrible.\r\n\r\nSue\xe2\x80\x99s was of the most artless and natural kind. She addressed him as\r\nher dear cousin Jude; said she had only just learnt by the merest\r\naccident that he was living in Christminster, and reproached him with\r\nnot letting her know. They might have had such nice times together, she\r\nsaid, for she was thrown much upon herself, and had hardly any\r\ncongenial friend. But now there was every probability of her soon going\r\naway, so that the chance of companionship would be lost perhaps for\r\never.\r\n\r\nA cold sweat overspread Jude at the news that she was going away. That\r\nwas a contingency he had never thought of, and it spurred him to write\r\nall the more quickly to her. He would meet her that very evening, he\r\nsaid, one hour from the time of writing, at the cross in the pavement\r\nwhich marked the spot of the Martyrdoms.\r\n\r\nWhen he had despatched the note by a boy he regretted that in his hurry\r\nhe should have suggested to her to meet him out of doors, when he might\r\nhave said he would call upon her. It was, in fact, the country custom\r\nto meet thus, and nothing else had occurred to him. Arabella had been\r\nmet in the same way, unfortunately, and it might not seem respectable\r\nto a dear girl like Sue. However, it could not be helped now, and he\r\nmoved towards the point a few minutes before the hour, under the\r\nglimmer of the newly lighted lamps.\r\n\r\nThe broad street was silent, and almost deserted, although it was not\r\nlate. He saw a figure on the other side, which turned out to be hers,\r\nand they both converged towards the crossmark at the same moment.\r\nBefore either had reached it she called out to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to meet you just there, for the first time in my life!\r\nCome further on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice, though positive and silvery, had been tremulous. They walked\r\non in parallel lines, and, waiting her pleasure, Jude watched till she\r\nshowed signs of closing in, when he did likewise, the place being where\r\nthe carriers\xe2\x80\x99 carts stood in the daytime, though there was none on the\r\nspot then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry that I asked you to meet me, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t call,\xe2\x80\x9d began Jude\r\nwith the bashfulness of a lover. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought it would save time if\r\nwe were going to walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with the freedom of a friend. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nreally no place to ask anybody in to. What I meant was that the place\r\nyou chose was so horrid\xe2\x80\x94I suppose I ought not to say horrid\xe2\x80\x94I mean\r\ngloomy and inauspicious in its associations\xe2\x80\xa6 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it funny to\r\nbegin like this, when I don\xe2\x80\x99t know you yet?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked him up and down\r\ncuriously, though Jude did not look much at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to know me more than I know you,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I have seen you now and then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you knew who I was, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak? And now I am going away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. That\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate. I have hardly any other friend. I have,\r\nindeed, one very old friend here somewhere, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite like to\r\ncall on him just yet. I wonder if you know anything of him\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\r\nPhillotson? A parson somewhere about the county I think he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I only know of one Mr. Phillotson. He lives a little way out in the\r\ncountry, at Lumsdon. He\xe2\x80\x99s a village schoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I wonder if he\xe2\x80\x99s the same. Surely it is impossible! Only a\r\nschoolmaster still! Do you know his Christian name\xe2\x80\x94is it Richard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94it is; I\xe2\x80\x99ve directed books to him, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s countenance fell, for how could he succeed in an enterprise\r\nwherein the great Phillotson had failed? He would have had a day of\r\ndespair if the news had not arrived during his sweet Sue\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\nbut even at this moment he had visions of how Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s failure in\r\nthe grand university scheme would depress him when she had gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we are going to take a walk, suppose we go and call upon him?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJude suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe agreed, and they went along up a hill, and through some prettily\r\nwooded country. Presently the embattled tower and square turret of the\r\nchurch rose into the sky, and then the school-house. They inquired of a\r\nperson in the street if Mr. Phillotson was likely to be at home, and\r\nwere informed that he was always at home. A knock brought him to the\r\nschool-house door, with a candle in his hand and a look of inquiry on\r\nhis face, which had grown thin and careworn since Jude last set eyes on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThat after all these years the meeting with Mr. Phillotson should be of\r\nthis homely complexion destroyed at one stroke the halo which had\r\nsurrounded the school-master\xe2\x80\x99s figure in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s imagination ever since\r\ntheir parting. It created in him at the same time a sympathy with\r\nPhillotson as an obviously much chastened and disappointed man. Jude\r\ntold him his name, and said he had come to see him as an old friend who\r\nhad been kind to him in his youthful days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember you in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d said the school-master\r\nthoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were one of my pupils, you say? Yes, no doubt; but\r\nthey number so many thousands by this time of my life, and have\r\nnaturally changed so much, that I remember very few except the quite\r\nrecent ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was out at Marygreen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, wishing he had not come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I was there a short time. And is this an old pupil, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s my cousin\xe2\x80\xa6 I wrote to you for some grammars, if you\r\nrecollect, and you sent them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94yes!\xe2\x80\x94I do dimly recall that incident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was very kind of you to do it. And it was you who first started me\r\non that course. On the morning you left Marygreen, when your goods were\r\non the waggon, you wished me good-bye, and said your scheme was to be a\r\nuniversity man and enter the Church\xe2\x80\x94that a degree was the necessary\r\nhall-mark of one who wanted to do anything as a theologian or teacher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember I thought all that privately; but I wonder I did not keep\r\nmy own counsel. The idea was given up years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never forgotten it. It was that which brought me to this part\r\nof the country, and out here to see you to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd your cousin, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey entered the parlour of the school-house, where there was a lamp\r\nwith a paper shade, which threw the light down on three or four books.\r\nPhillotson took it off, so that they could see each other better, and\r\nthe rays fell on the nervous little face and vivacious dark eyes and\r\nhair of Sue, on the earnest features of her cousin, and on the\r\nschoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s own maturer face and figure, showing him to be a spare\r\nand thoughtful personage of five-and-forty, with a thin-lipped,\r\nsomewhat refined mouth, a slightly stooping habit, and a black frock\r\ncoat, which from continued frictions shone a little at the\r\nshoulder-blades, the middle of the back, and the elbows.\r\n\r\nThe old friendship was imperceptibly renewed, the schoolmaster speaking\r\nof his experiences, and the cousins of theirs. He told them that he\r\nstill thought of the Church sometimes, and that though he could not\r\nenter it as he had intended to do in former years he might enter it as\r\na licentiate. Meanwhile, he said, he was comfortable in his present\r\nposition, though he was in want of a pupil-teacher.\r\n\r\nThey did not stay to supper, Sue having to be indoors before it grew\r\nlate, and the road was retraced to Christminster. Though they had\r\ntalked of nothing more than general subjects, Jude was surprised to\r\nfind what a revelation of woman his cousin was to him. She was so\r\nvibrant that everything she did seemed to have its source in feeling.\r\nAn exciting thought would make her walk ahead so fast that he could\r\nhardly keep up with her; and her sensitiveness on some points was such\r\nthat it might have been misread as vanity. It was with heart-sickness\r\nhe perceived that, while her sentiments towards him were those of the\r\nfrankest friendliness only, he loved her more than before becoming\r\nacquainted with her; and the gloom of the walk home lay not in the\r\nnight overhead, but in the thought of her departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy must you leave Christminster?\xe2\x80\x9d he said regretfully. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you\r\ndo otherwise than cling to a city in whose history such men as Newman,\r\nPusey, Ward, Keble, loom so large!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94they do. Though how large do they loom in the history of the\r\nworld? \xe2\x80\xa6 What a funny reason for caring to stay! I should never have\r\nthought of it!\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I must go,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Fontover, one of the partners\r\nwhom I serve, is offended with me, and I with her; and it is best to\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did that happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe broke some statuary of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh? Wilfully?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She found it in my room, and though it was my property she threw\r\nit on the floor and stamped on it, because it was not according to her\r\ntaste, and ground the arms and the head of one of the figures all to\r\nbits with her heel\xe2\x80\x94a horrid thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo Catholic-Apostolic for her, I suppose? No doubt she called them\r\npopish images and talked of the invocation of saints.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\xa6 No, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that. She saw the matter quite differently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Then I am surprised!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It was for quite some other reason that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like my\r\npatron-saints. So I was led to retort upon her; and the end of it was\r\nthat I resolved not to stay, but to get into an occupation in which I\r\nshall be more independent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you try teaching again? You once did, I heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of resuming it; for I was getting on as an\r\nart-designer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ let me ask Mr. Phillotson to let you try your hand in his school?\r\nIf you like it, and go to a training college, and become a first-class\r\ncertificated mistress, you get twice as large an income as any designer\r\nor church artist, and twice as much freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94ask him. Now I must go in. Good-bye, dear Jude! I am so glad we\r\nhave met at last. We needn\xe2\x80\x99t quarrel because our parents did, need we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude did not like to let her see quite how much he agreed with her, and\r\nwent his way to the remote street in which he had his lodging.\r\n\r\nTo keep Sue Bridehead near him was now a desire which operated without\r\nregard of consequences, and the next evening he again set out for\r\nLumsdon, fearing to trust to the persuasive effects of a note only. The\r\nschool-master was unprepared for such a proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I rather wanted was a second year\xe2\x80\x99s transfer, as it is called,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course your cousin would do, personally; but she has had\r\nno experience. Oh\xe2\x80\x94she has, has she? Does she really think of adopting\r\nteaching as a profession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude said she was disposed to do so, he thought, and his ingenious\r\narguments on her natural fitness for assisting Mr. Phillotson, of which\r\nJude knew nothing whatever, so influenced the schoolmaster that he said\r\nhe would engage her, assuring Jude as a friend that unless his cousin\r\nreally meant to follow on in the same course, and regarded this step as\r\nthe first stage of an apprenticeship, of which her training in a normal\r\nschool would be the second stage, her time would be wasted quite, the\r\nsalary being merely nominal.\r\n\r\nThe day after this visit Phillotson received a letter from Jude,\r\ncontaining the information that he had again consulted his cousin, who\r\ntook more and more warmly to the idea of tuition; and that she had\r\nagreed to come. It did not occur for a moment to the schoolmaster and\r\nrecluse that Jude\xe2\x80\x99s ardour in promoting the arrangement arose from any\r\nother feelings towards Sue than the instinct of co-operation common\r\namong members of the same family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster sat in his homely dwelling attached to the school,\r\nboth being modern erections; and he looked across the way at the old\r\nhouse in which his teacher Sue had a lodging. The arrangement had been\r\nconcluded very quickly. A pupil-teacher who was to have been\r\ntransferred to Mr. Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s school had failed him, and Sue had been\r\ntaken as stop-gap. All such provisional arrangements as these could\r\nonly last till the next annual visit of H.M. Inspector, whose approval\r\nwas necessary to make them permanent. Having taught for some two years\r\nin London, though she had abandoned that vocation of late, Miss\r\nBridehead was not exactly a novice, and Phillotson thought there would\r\nbe no difficulty in retaining her services, which he already wished to\r\ndo, though she had only been with him three or four weeks. He had found\r\nher quite as bright as Jude had described her; and what\r\nmaster-tradesman does not wish to keep an apprentice who saves him half\r\nhis labour?\r\n\r\nIt was a little over half-past eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning and he was\r\nwaiting to see her cross the road to the school, when he would follow.\r\nAt twenty minutes to nine she did cross, a light hat tossed on her\r\nhead; and he watched her as a curiosity. A new emanation, which had\r\nnothing to do with her skill as a teacher, seemed to surround her this\r\nmorning. He went to the school also, and Sue remained governing her\r\nclass at the other end of the room, all day under his eye. She\r\ncertainly was an excellent teacher.\r\n\r\nIt was part of his duty to give her private lessons in the evening, and\r\nsome article in the Code made it necessary that a respectable, elderly\r\nwoman should be present at these lessons when the teacher and the\r\ntaught were of different sexes. Richard Phillotson thought of the\r\nabsurdity of the regulation in this case, when he was old enough to be\r\nthe girl\xe2\x80\x99s father; but he faithfully acted up to it; and sat down with\r\nher in a room where Mrs. Hawes, the widow at whose house Sue lodged,\r\noccupied herself with sewing. The regulation was, indeed, not easy to\r\nevade, for there was no other sitting-room in the dwelling.\r\n\r\nSometimes as she figured\xe2\x80\x94it was arithmetic that they were working\r\nat\xe2\x80\x94she would involuntarily glance up with a little inquiring smile at\r\nhim, as if she assumed that, being the master, he must perceive all\r\nthat was passing in her brain, as right or wrong. Phillotson was not\r\nreally thinking of the arithmetic at all, but of her, in a novel way\r\nwhich somehow seemed strange to him as preceptor. Perhaps she knew that\r\nhe was thinking of her thus.\r\n\r\nFor a few weeks their work had gone on with a monotony which in itself\r\nwas a delight to him. Then it happened that the children were to be\r\ntaken to Christminster to see an itinerant exhibition, in the shape of\r\na model of Jerusalem, to which schools were admitted at a penny a head\r\nin the interests of education. They marched along the road two and two,\r\nshe beside her class with her simple cotton sunshade, her little thumb\r\ncocked up against its stem; and Phillotson behind in his long dangling\r\ncoat, handling his walking-stick genteelly, in the musing mood which\r\nhad come over him since her arrival. The afternoon was one of sun and\r\ndust, and when they entered the exhibition room few people were present\r\nbut themselves. The model of the ancient city stood in the middle of\r\nthe apartment, and the proprietor, with a fine religious philanthropy\r\nwritten on his features, walked round it with a pointer in his hand,\r\nshowing the young people the various quarters and places known to them\r\nby name from reading their Bibles; Mount Moriah, the Valley of\r\nJehoshaphat, the City of Zion, the walls and the gates, outside one of\r\nwhich there was a large mound like a tumulus, and on the mound a little\r\nwhite cross. The spot, he said, was Calvary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue to the schoolmaster, as she stood with him a little\r\nin the background, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this model, elaborate as it is, is a very\r\nimaginary production. How does anybody know that Jerusalem was like\r\nthis in the time of Christ? I am sure this man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is made after the best conjectural maps, based on actual visits to\r\nthe city as it now exists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy we have had enough of Jerusalem,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cconsidering we\r\nare not descended from the Jews. There was nothing first-rate about the\r\nplace, or people, after all\xe2\x80\x94as there was about Athens, Rome,\r\nAlexandria, and other old cities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my dear girl, consider what it is to us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent, for she was easily repressed; and then perceived behind\r\nthe group of children clustered round the model a young man in a white\r\nflannel jacket, his form being bent so low in his intent inspection of\r\nthe Valley of Jehoshaphat that his face was almost hidden from view by\r\nthe Mount of Olives. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at your cousin Jude,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\nschoolmaster. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think we have had enough of Jerusalem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see him!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried in her quick, light voice. \xe2\x80\x9cJude\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nseriously you are going into it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude started up from his reverie, and saw her. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with\r\na glad flush of embarrassment. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are your school-children, of\r\ncourse! I saw that schools were admitted in the afternoons, and thought\r\nyou might come; but I got so deeply interested that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t remember\r\nwhere I was. How it carries one back, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it! I could examine it\r\nfor hours, but I have only a few minutes, unfortunately; for I am in\r\nthe middle of a job out here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cousin is so terribly clever that she criticizes it\r\nunmercifully,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson, with good-humoured satire. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\r\nquite sceptical as to its correctness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Phillotson, I am not\xe2\x80\x94altogether! I hate to be what is called a\r\nclever girl\xe2\x80\x94there are too many of that sort now!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sue\r\nsensitively. \xe2\x80\x9cI only meant\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I meant\xe2\x80\x94except that it was\r\nwhat you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ know your meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude ardently (although he did not). \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI think you are quite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good Jude\xe2\x80\x94I know _you_ believe in me!\xe2\x80\x9d She impulsively seized\r\nhis hand, and leaving a reproachful look on the schoolmaster turned\r\naway to Jude, her voice revealing a tremor which she herself felt to be\r\nabsurdly uncalled for by sarcasm so gentle. She had not the least\r\nconception how the hearts of the twain went out to her at this\r\nmomentary revelation of feeling, and what a complication she was\r\nbuilding up thereby in the futures of both.\r\n\r\nThe model wore too much of an educational aspect for the children not\r\nto tire of it soon, and a little later in the afternoon they were all\r\nmarched back to Lumsdon, Jude returning to his work. He watched the\r\njuvenile flock in their clean frocks and pinafores, filing down the\r\nstreet towards the country beside Phillotson and Sue, and a sad,\r\ndissatisfied sense of being out of the scheme of the latters\xe2\x80\x99 lives had\r\npossession of him. Phillotson had invited him to walk out and see them\r\non Friday evening, when there would be no lessons to give to Sue, and\r\nJude had eagerly promised to avail himself of the opportunity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the scholars and teachers moved homewards, and the next day,\r\non looking on the blackboard in Sue\xe2\x80\x99s class, Phillotson was surprised\r\nto find upon it, skilfully drawn in chalk, a perspective view of\r\nJerusalem, with every building shown in its place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you took no interest in the model, and hardly looked at it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly did,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I remembered that much of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is more than I had remembered myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s school-inspector was at that time paying\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csurprise-visits\xe2\x80\x9d in this neighbourhood to test the teaching unawares;\r\nand two days later, in the middle of the morning lessons, the latch of\r\nthe door was softly lifted, and in walked my gentleman, the king of\r\nterrors\xe2\x80\x94to pupil-teachers.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Phillotson the surprise was not great; like the lady in the\r\nstory, he had been played that trick too many times to be unprepared.\r\nBut Sue\xe2\x80\x99s class was at the further end of the room, and her back was\r\ntowards the entrance; the inspector therefore came and stood behind her\r\nand watched her teaching some half-minute before she became aware of\r\nhis presence. She turned, and realized that an oft-dreaded moment had\r\ncome. The effect upon her timidity was such that she uttered a cry of\r\nfright. Phillotson, with a strange instinct of solicitude quite beyond\r\nhis control, was at her side just in time to prevent her falling from\r\nfaintness. She soon recovered herself, and laughed; but when the\r\ninspector had gone there was a reaction, and she was so white that\r\nPhillotson took her into his room, and gave her some brandy to bring\r\nher round. She found him holding her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have told me,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped petulantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one of the\r\ninspector\xe2\x80\x99s surprise-visits was imminent! Oh, what shall I do! Now\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll write and tell the managers that I am no good, and I shall be\r\ndisgraced for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t do that, my dear little girl. You are the best teacher ever I\r\nhad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked so gently at her that she was moved, and regretted that she\r\nhad upbraided him. When she was better she went home.\r\n\r\nJude in the meantime had been waiting impatiently for Friday. On both\r\nWednesday and Thursday he had been so much under the influence of his\r\ndesire to see her that he walked after dark some distance along the\r\nroad in the direction of the village, and, on returning to his room to\r\nread, found himself quite unable to concentrate his mind on the page.\r\nOn Friday, as soon as he had got himself up as he thought Sue would\r\nlike to see him, and made a hasty tea, he set out, notwithstanding that\r\nthe evening was wet. The trees overhead deepened the gloom of the hour,\r\nand they dripped sadly upon him, impressing him with\r\nforebodings\xe2\x80\x94illogical forebodings; for though he knew that he loved her\r\nhe also knew that he could not be more to her than he was.\r\n\r\nOn turning the corner and entering the village the first sight that\r\ngreeted his eyes was that of two figures under one umbrella coming out\r\nof the vicarage gate. He was too far back for them to notice him, but\r\nhe knew in a moment that they were Sue and Phillotson. The latter was\r\nholding the umbrella over her head, and they had evidently been paying\r\na visit to the vicar\xe2\x80\x94probably on some business connected with the\r\nschool work. And as they walked along the wet and deserted lane Jude\r\nsaw Phillotson place his arm round the girl\xe2\x80\x99s waist; whereupon she\r\ngently removed it; but he replaced it; and she let it remain, looking\r\nquickly round her with an air of misgiving. She did not look absolutely\r\nbehind her, and therefore did not see Jude, who sank into the hedge\r\nlike one struck with a blight. There he remained hidden till they had\r\nreached Sue\xe2\x80\x99s cottage and she had passed in, Phillotson going on to the\r\nschool hard by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s too old for her\xe2\x80\x94too old!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jude in all the terrible\r\nsickness of hopeless, handicapped love.\r\n\r\nHe could not interfere. Was he not Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s? He was unable to go on\r\nfurther, and retraced his steps towards Christminster. Every tread of\r\nhis feet seemed to say to him that he must on no account stand in the\r\nschoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s way with Sue. Phillotson was perhaps twenty years her\r\nsenior, but many a happy marriage had been made in such conditions of\r\nage. The ironical clinch to his sorrow was given by the thought that\r\nthe intimacy between his cousin and the schoolmaster had been brought\r\nabout entirely by himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s old and embittered aunt lay unwell at Marygreen, and on the\r\nfollowing Sunday he went to see her\xe2\x80\x94a visit which was the result of a\r\nvictorious struggle against his inclination to turn aside to the\r\nvillage of Lumsdon and obtain a miserable interview with his cousin, in\r\nwhich the word nearest his heart could not be spoken, and the sight\r\nwhich had tortured him could not be revealed.\r\n\r\nHis aunt was now unable to leave her bed, and a great part of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshort day was occupied in making arrangements for her comfort. The\r\nlittle bakery business had been sold to a neighbour, and with the\r\nproceeds of this and her savings she was comfortably supplied with\r\nnecessaries and more, a widow of the same village living with her and\r\nministering to her wants. It was not till the time had nearly come for\r\nhim to leave that he obtained a quiet talk with her, and his words\r\ntended insensibly towards his cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Sue born here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was\xe2\x80\x94in this room. They were living here at that time. What made\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee ask that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I wanted to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing her!\xe2\x80\x9d said the harsh old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did I\r\ntell \xe2\x80\x99ee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94that I was not to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you gossiped with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t keep it up. She was brought up by her father to hate her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s family; and she\xe2\x80\x99ll look with no favour upon a working chap\r\nlike you\xe2\x80\x94a townish girl as she\xe2\x80\x99s become by now. I never cared much\r\nabout her. A pert little thing, that\xe2\x80\x99s what she was too often, with her\r\ntight-strained nerves. Many\xe2\x80\x99s the time I\xe2\x80\x99ve smacked her for her\r\nimpertinence. Why, one day when she was walking into the pond with her\r\nshoes and stockings off, and her petticoats pulled above her knees,\r\nafore I could cry out for shame, she said: \xe2\x80\x98Move on, Aunty! This is no\r\nsight for modest eyes!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a little child then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was twelve if a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94of course. But now she\xe2\x80\x99s older she\xe2\x80\x99s of a thoughtful, quivering,\r\ntender nature, and as sensitive as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJude!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his aunt, springing up in bed. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you be a fool about\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, of course not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour marrying that woman Arabella was about as bad a thing as a man\r\ncould possibly do for himself by trying hard. But she\xe2\x80\x99s gone to the\r\nother side of the world, and med never trouble you again. And there\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe a worse thing if you, tied and bound as you be, should have a fancy\r\nfor Sue. If your cousin is civil to you, take her civility for what it\r\nis worth. But anything more than a relation\xe2\x80\x99s good wishes it is stark\r\nmadness for \xe2\x80\x99ee to give her. If she\xe2\x80\x99s townish and wanton it med bring\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee to ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say anything against her, Aunt! Don\xe2\x80\x99t, please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA relief was afforded to him by the entry of the companion and nurse of\r\nhis aunt, who must have been listening to the conversation, for she\r\nbegan a commentary on past years, introducing Sue Bridehead as a\r\ncharacter in her recollections. She described what an odd little maid\r\nSue had been when a pupil at the village school across the green\r\nopposite, before her father went to London\xe2\x80\x94how, when the vicar arranged\r\nreadings and recitations, she appeared on the platform, the smallest of\r\nthem all, \xe2\x80\x9cin her little white frock, and shoes, and pink sash\xe2\x80\x9d; how\r\nshe recited \xe2\x80\x9cExcelsior,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a sound of revelry by night,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Raven\xe2\x80\x9d; how during the delivery she would knit her little brows\r\nand glare round tragically, and say to the empty air, as if some real\r\ncreature stood there\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGhastly, grim, and ancient Raven,\r\n    wandering from the Nightly shore,\r\nTell me what thy lordly name is\r\n    on the Night\xe2\x80\x99s Plutonian shore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d bring up the nasty carrion bird that clear,\xe2\x80\x9d corroborated the\r\nsick woman reluctantly, \xe2\x80\x9cas she stood there in her little sash and\r\nthings, that you could see un a\xe2\x80\x99most before your very eyes. You too,\r\nJude, had the same trick as a child of seeming to see things in the\r\nair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe neighbour told also of Sue\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments in other kinds:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was not exactly a tomboy, you know; but she could do things that\r\nonly boys do, as a rule. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her hit in and steer down the long\r\nslide on yonder pond, with her little curls blowing, one of a file of\r\ntwenty moving along against the sky like shapes painted on glass, and\r\nup the back slide without stopping. All boys except herself; and then\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d cheer her, and then she\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be saucy, boys,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nsuddenly run indoors. They\xe2\x80\x99d try to coax her out again. But \xe2\x80\x99a wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese retrospective visions of Sue only made Jude the more miserable\r\nthat he was unable to woo her, and he left the cottage of his aunt that\r\nday with a heavy heart. He would fain have glanced into the school to\r\nsee the room in which Sue\xe2\x80\x99s little figure had so glorified itself; but\r\nhe checked his desire and went on.\r\n\r\nIt being Sunday evening some villagers who had known him during his\r\nresidence here were standing in a group in their best clothes. Jude was\r\nstartled by a salute from one of them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99ve got there right enough, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude showed that he did not understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to the seat of l\xe2\x80\x99arning\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x98City of Light\xe2\x80\x99 you used to talk to\r\nus about as a little boy! Is it all you expected of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; more!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was there once for an hour I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see much in it for my part;\r\nauld crumbling buildings, half church, half almshouse, and not much\r\ngoing on at that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong, John; there is more going on than meets the eye of a\r\nman walking through the streets. It is a unique centre of thought and\r\nreligion\xe2\x80\x94the intellectual and spiritual granary of this country. All\r\nthat silence and absence of goings-on is the stillness of infinite\r\nmotion\xe2\x80\x94the sleep of the spinning-top, to borrow the simile of a\r\nwell-known writer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, it med be all that, or it med not. As I say, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nnothing of it the hour or two I was there; so I went in and had a pot\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 beer, and a penny loaf, and a ha\xe2\x80\x99porth o\xe2\x80\x99 cheese, and waited till it\r\nwas time to come along home. You\xe2\x80\x99ve j\xe2\x80\x99ined a college by this time, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cI am almost as far off that as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude slapped his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what we thought! Such places be not for such as you\xe2\x80\x94only for them\r\nwith plenty o\xe2\x80\x99 money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, with some bitterness. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are for\r\nsuch ones!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill, the remark was sufficient to withdraw Jude\xe2\x80\x99s attention from the\r\nimaginative world he had lately inhabited, in which an abstract figure,\r\nmore or less himself, was steeping his mind in a sublimation of the\r\narts and sciences, and making his calling and election sure to a seat\r\nin the paradise of the learned. He was set regarding his prospects in a\r\ncold northern light. He had lately felt that he could not quite satisfy\r\nhimself in his Greek\xe2\x80\x94in the Greek of the dramatists particularly. So\r\nfatigued was he sometimes after his day\xe2\x80\x99s work that he could not\r\nmaintain the critical attention necessary for thorough application. He\r\nfelt that he wanted a coach\xe2\x80\x94a friend at his elbow to tell him in a\r\nmoment what sometimes would occupy him a weary month in extracting from\r\nunanticipative, clumsy books.\r\n\r\nIt was decidedly necessary to consider facts a little more closely than\r\nhe had done of late. What was the good, after all, of using up his\r\nspare hours in a vague labour called \xe2\x80\x9cprivate study\xe2\x80\x9d without giving an\r\noutlook on practicabilities?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have thought of this before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he journeyed\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been better never to have embarked in the scheme\r\nat all than to do it without seeing clearly where I am going, or what I\r\nam aiming at\xe2\x80\xa6 This hovering outside the walls of the colleges, as if\r\nexpecting some arm to be stretched out from them to lift me inside,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do! I must get special information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next week accordingly he sought it. What at first seemed an\r\nopportunity occurred one afternoon when he saw an elderly gentleman,\r\nwho had been pointed out as the head of a particular college, walking\r\nin the public path of a parklike enclosure near the spot at which Jude\r\nchanced to be sitting. The gentleman came nearer, and Jude looked\r\nanxiously at his face. It seemed benign, considerate, yet rather\r\nreserved. On second thoughts Jude felt that he could not go up and\r\naddress him; but he was sufficiently influenced by the incident to\r\nthink what a wise thing it would be for him to state his difficulties\r\nby letter to some of the best and most judicious of these old masters,\r\nand obtain their advice.\r\n\r\nDuring the next week or two he accordingly placed himself in such\r\npositions about the city as would afford him glimpses of several of the\r\nmost distinguished among the provosts, wardens, and other heads of\r\nhouses; and from those he ultimately selected five whose physiognomies\r\nseemed to say to him that they were appreciative and far-seeing men. To\r\nthese five he addressed letters, briefly stating his difficulties, and\r\nasking their opinion on his stranded situation.\r\n\r\nWhen the letters were posted Jude mentally began to criticize them; he\r\nwished they had not been sent. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is just one of those intrusive,\r\nvulgar, pushing, applications which are so common in these days,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I know better than address utter strangers in\r\nsuch a way? I may be an impostor, an idle scamp, a man with a bad\r\ncharacter, for all that they know to the contrary\xe2\x80\xa6 Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he found himself clinging to the hope of some reply as to\r\nhis one last chance of redemption. He waited day after day, saying that\r\nit was perfectly absurd to expect, yet expecting. While he waited he\r\nwas suddenly stirred by news about Phillotson. Phillotson was giving up\r\nthe school near Christminster, for a larger one further south, in\r\nMid-Wessex. What this meant; how it would affect his cousin; whether,\r\nas seemed possible, it was a practical move of the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntowards a larger income, in view of a provision for two instead of one,\r\nhe would not allow himself to say. And the tender relations between\r\nPhillotson and the young girl of whom Jude was passionately enamoured\r\neffectually made it repugnant to Jude\xe2\x80\x99s tastes to apply to Phillotson\r\nfor advice on his own scheme.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the academic dignitaries to whom Jude had written vouchsafed\r\nno answer, and the young man was thus thrown back entirely on himself,\r\nas formerly, with the added gloom of a weakened hope. By indirect\r\ninquiries he soon perceived clearly what he had long uneasily\r\nsuspected, that to qualify himself for certain open scholarships and\r\nexhibitions was the only brilliant course. But to do this a good deal\r\nof coaching would be necessary, and much natural ability. It was next\r\nto impossible that a man reading on his own system, however widely and\r\nthoroughly, even over the prolonged period of ten years, should be able\r\nto compete with those who had passed their lives under trained teachers\r\nand had worked to ordained lines.\r\n\r\nThe other course, that of buying himself in, so to speak, seemed the\r\nonly one really open to men like him, the difficulty being simply of a\r\nmaterial kind. With the help of his information he began to reckon the\r\nextent of this material obstacle, and ascertained, to his dismay, that,\r\nat the rate at which, with the best of fortune, he would be able to\r\nsave money, fifteen years must elapse before he could be in a position\r\nto forward testimonials to the head of a college and advance to a\r\nmatriculation examination. The undertaking was hopeless.\r\n\r\nHe saw what a curious and cunning glamour the neighbourhood of the\r\nplace had exercised over him. To get there and live there, to move\r\namong the churches and halls and become imbued with the _genius loci_,\r\nhad seemed to his dreaming youth, as the spot shaped its charms to him\r\nfrom its halo on the horizon, the obvious and ideal thing to do. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nme only get there,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said with the fatuousness of Crusoe over his\r\nbig boat, \xe2\x80\x9cand the rest is but a matter of time and energy.\xe2\x80\x9d It would\r\nhave been far better for him in every way if he had never come within\r\nsight and sound of the delusive precincts, had gone to some busy\r\ncommercial town with the sole object of making money by his wits, and\r\nthence surveyed his plan in true perspective. Well, all that was clear\r\nto him amounted to this, that the whole scheme had burst up, like an\r\niridescent soap-bubble, under the touch of a reasoned inquiry. He\r\nlooked back at himself along the vista of his past years, and his\r\nthought was akin to Heine\xe2\x80\x99s:\r\n\r\nAbove the youth\xe2\x80\x99s inspired and flashing eyes\r\nI see the motley mocking fool\xe2\x80\x99s-cap rise!\r\n\r\nFortunately he had not been allowed to bring his disappointment into\r\nhis dear Sue\xe2\x80\x99s life by involving her in this collapse. And the painful\r\ndetails of his awakening to a sense of his limitations should now be\r\nspared her as far as possible. After all, she had only known a little\r\npart of the miserable struggle in which he had been engaged thus\r\nunequipped, poor, and unforeseeing.\r\n\r\nHe always remembered the appearance of the afternoon on which he awoke\r\nfrom his dream. Not quite knowing what to do with himself, he went up\r\nto an octagonal chamber in the lantern of a singularly built theatre\r\nthat was set amidst this quaint and singular city. It had windows all\r\nround, from which an outlook over the whole town and its edifices could\r\nbe gained. Jude\xe2\x80\x99s eyes swept all the views in succession, meditatively,\r\nmournfully, yet sturdily. Those buildings and their associations and\r\nprivileges were not for him. From the looming roof of the great\r\nlibrary, into which he hardly ever had time to enter, his gaze\r\ntravelled on to the varied spires, halls, gables, streets, chapels,\r\ngardens, quadrangles, which composed the ensemble of this unrivalled\r\npanorama. He saw that his destiny lay not with these, but among the\r\nmanual toilers in the shabby purlieu which he himself occupied,\r\nunrecognized as part of the city at all by its visitors and\r\npanegyrists, yet without whose denizens the hard readers could not read\r\nnor the high thinkers live.\r\n\r\nHe looked over the town into the country beyond, to the trees which\r\nscreened her whose presence had at first been the support of his heart,\r\nand whose loss was now a maddening torture. But for this blow he might\r\nhave borne with his fate. With Sue as companion he could have renounced\r\nhis ambitions with a smile. Without her it was inevitable that the\r\nreaction from the long strain to which he had subjected himself should\r\naffect him disastrously. Phillotson had no doubt passed through a\r\nsimilar intellectual disappointment to that which now enveloped him.\r\nBut the schoolmaster had been since blest with the consolation of sweet\r\nSue, while for him there was no consoler.\r\n\r\nDescending to the streets, he went listlessly along till he arrived at\r\nan inn, and entered it. Here he drank several glasses of beer in rapid\r\nsuccession, and when he came out it was night. By the light of the\r\nflickering lamps he rambled home to supper, and had not long been\r\nsitting at table when his landlady brought up a letter that had just\r\narrived for him. She laid it down as if impressed with a sense of its\r\npossible importance, and on looking at it Jude perceived that it bore\r\nthe embossed stamp of one of the colleges whose heads he had addressed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_One_\xe2\x80\x94at last!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jude.\r\n\r\nThe communication was brief, and not exactly what he had expected;\r\nthough it really was from the master in person. It ran thus:\r\n\r\nBIBLIOLL COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,\xe2\x80\x94I have read your letter with interest; and, judging from your\r\ndescription of yourself as a working-man, I venture to think that you\r\nwill have a much better chance of success in life by remaining in your\r\nown sphere and sticking to your trade than by adopting any other\r\ncourse. That, therefore, is what I advise you to do. Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\r\nT. TETUPHENAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mr. J. FAWLEY, Stone-mason.\r\n\r\nThis terribly sensible advice exasperated Jude. He had known all that\r\nbefore. He knew it was true. Yet it seemed a hard slap after ten years\r\nof labour, and its effect upon him just now was to make him rise\r\nrecklessly from the table, and, instead of reading as usual, to go\r\ndownstairs and into the street. He stood at a bar and tossed off two or\r\nthree glasses, then unconsciously sauntered along till he came to a\r\nspot called The Fourways in the middle of the city, gazing abstractedly\r\nat the groups of people like one in a trance, till, coming to himself,\r\nhe began talking to the policeman fixed there.\r\n\r\nThat officer yawned, stretched out his elbows, elevated himself an inch\r\nand a half on the balls of his toes, smiled, and looking humorously at\r\nJude, said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had a wet, young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I\xe2\x80\x99ve only begun,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied cynically.\r\n\r\nWhatever his wetness, his brains were dry enough. He only heard in part\r\nthe policeman\xe2\x80\x99s further remarks, having fallen into thought on what\r\nstruggling people like himself had stood at that crossway, whom nobody\r\never thought of now. It had more history than the oldest college in the\r\ncity. It was literally teeming, stratified, with the shades of human\r\ngroups, who had met there for tragedy, comedy, farce; real enactments\r\nof the intensest kind. At Fourways men had stood and talked of\r\nNapoleon, the loss of America, the execution of King Charles, the\r\nburning of the Martyrs, the Crusades, the Norman Conquest, possibly of\r\nthe arrival of Caesar. Here the two sexes had met for loving, hating,\r\ncoupling, parting; had waited, had suffered, for each other; had\r\ntriumphed over each other; cursed each other in jealousy, blessed each\r\nother in forgiveness.\r\n\r\nHe began to see that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely\r\nmore palpitating, varied, and compendious than the gown life. These\r\nstruggling men and women before him were the reality of Christminster,\r\nthough they knew little of Christ or Minster. That was one of the\r\nhumours of things. The floating population of students and teachers,\r\nwho did know both in a way, were not Christminster in a local sense at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch, and, in pursuit of this idea, he went on till\r\nhe came to a public hall, where a promenade concert was in progress.\r\nJude entered, and found the room full of shop youths and girls,\r\nsoldiers, apprentices, boys of eleven smoking cigarettes, and light\r\nwomen of the more respectable and amateur class. He had tapped the real\r\nChristminster life. A band was playing, and the crowd walked about and\r\njostled each other, and every now and then a man got upon a platform\r\nand sang a comic song.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Sue seemed to hover round him and prevent his flirting\r\nand drinking with the frolicsome girls who made advances\xe2\x80\x94wistful to\r\ngain a little joy. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock he came away, choosing a circuitous\r\nroute homeward to pass the gates of the college whose head had just\r\nsent him the note.\r\n\r\nThe gates were shut, and, by an impulse, he took from his pocket the\r\nlump of chalk which as a workman he usually carried there, and wrote\r\nalong the wall:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea,\r\nwho knoweth not such things as these?_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Job xii. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stroke of scorn relieved his mind, and the next morning he laughed\r\nat his self-conceit. But the laugh was not a healthy one. He re-read\r\nthe letter from the master, and the wisdom in its lines, which had at\r\nfirst exasperated him, chilled and depressed him now. He saw himself as\r\na fool indeed.\r\n\r\nDeprived of the objects of both intellect and emotion, he could not\r\nproceed to his work. Whenever he felt reconciled to his fate as a\r\nstudent, there came to disturb his calm his hopeless relations with\r\nSue. That the one affined soul he had ever met was lost to him through\r\nhis marriage returned upon him with cruel persistency, till, unable to\r\nbear it longer, he again rushed for distraction to the real\r\nChristminster life. He now sought it out in an obscure and low-ceiled\r\ntavern up a court which was well known to certain worthies of the\r\nplace, and in brighter times would have interested him simply by its\r\nquaintness. Here he sat more or less all the day, convinced that he was\r\nat bottom a vicious character, of whom it was hopeless to expect\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the frequenters of the house dropped in one by one, Jude\r\nstill retaining his seat in the corner, though his money was all spent,\r\nand he had not eaten anything the whole day except a biscuit. He\r\nsurveyed his gathering companions with all the equanimity and\r\nphilosophy of a man who has been drinking long and slowly, and made\r\nfriends with several: to wit, Tinker Taylor, a decayed\r\nchurch-ironmonger who appeared to have been of a religious turn in\r\nearlier years, but was somewhat blasphemous now; also a red-nosed\r\nauctioneer; also two Gothic masons like himself, called Uncle Jim and\r\nUncle Joe. There were present, too, some clerks, and a gown- and\r\nsurplice-maker\xe2\x80\x99s assistant; two ladies who sported moral characters of\r\nvarious depths of shade, according to their company, nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cBower\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 Bliss\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFreckles\xe2\x80\x9d; some horsey men \xe2\x80\x9cin the know\xe2\x80\x9d of betting\r\ncircles; a travelling actor from the theatre, and two devil-may-care\r\nyoung men who proved to be gownless undergraduates; they had slipped in\r\nby stealth to meet a man about bull-pups, and stayed to drink and smoke\r\nshort pipes with the racing gents aforesaid, looking at their watches\r\nevery now and then.\r\n\r\nThe conversation waxed general. Christminster society was criticized,\r\nthe dons, magistrates, and other people in authority being sincerely\r\npitied for their shortcomings, while opinions on how they ought to\r\nconduct themselves and their affairs to be properly respected, were\r\nexchanged in a large-minded and disinterested manner.\r\n\r\nJude Fawley, with the self-conceit, effrontery, and _aplomb_ of a\r\nstrong-brained fellow in liquor, threw in his remarks somewhat\r\nperemptorily; and his aims having been what they were for so many\r\nyears, everything the others said turned upon his tongue, by a sort of\r\nmechanical craze, to the subject of scholarship and study, the extent\r\nof his own learning being dwelt upon with an insistence that would have\r\nappeared pitiable to himself in his sane hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cfor any provost, warden,\r\nprincipal, fellow, or cursed master of arts in the university! What I\r\nknow is that I\xe2\x80\x99d lick \xe2\x80\x99em on their own ground if they\xe2\x80\x99d give me a\r\nchance, and show \xe2\x80\x99em a few things they are not up to yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d said the undergraduates from the corner, where they were\r\ntalking privately about the pups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always was fond o\xe2\x80\x99 books, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tinker Taylor, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t doubt what you state. Now with me \xe2\x80\x99twas different. I always saw\r\nthere was more to be learnt outside a book than in; and I took my steps\r\naccordingly, or I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been the man I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou aim at the Church, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are such a\r\nscholar as to pitch yer hopes so high as that, why not give us a\r\nspecimen of your scholarship? Canst say the Creed in Latin, man? That\r\nwas how they once put it to a chap down in my country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot he! Like his conceit!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed one of the ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust you shut up, Bower o\xe2\x80\x99 Bliss!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the undergraduates.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d He drank off the spirits in his tumbler, rapped with it on\r\nthe counter, and announced, \xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman in the corner is going to\r\nrehearse the Articles of his Belief, in the Latin tongue, for the\r\nedification of the company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94have a try!\xe2\x80\x9d said the surplice-maker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he can!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tinker Taylor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll swear I can!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, come now, stand me a small Scotch\r\ncold, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it straight off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fair offer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the undergraduate, throwing down the money\r\nfor the whisky.\r\n\r\nThe barmaid concocted the mixture with the bearing of a person\r\ncompelled to live amongst animals of an inferior species, and the glass\r\nwas handed across to Jude, who, having drunk the contents, stood up and\r\nbegan rhetorically, without hesitation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Credo in unum Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, Factorem coeli et terrae,\r\nvisibilium omnium et invisibilium._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! Excellent Latin!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the undergraduates, who, however,\r\nhad not the slightest conception of a single word.\r\n\r\nA silence reigned among the rest in the bar, and the maid stood still,\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s voice echoing sonorously into the inner parlour, where the\r\nlandlord was dozing, and bringing him out to see what was going on.\r\nJude had declaimed steadily ahead, and was continuing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Crucifixus etiam pro nobis: sub Pontio Pilato passus, et sepultus\r\nest. Et resurrexit tertia die, secundum Scripturas._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the Nicene,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered the second undergraduate. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we wanted\r\nthe Apostles\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so! And every fool knows, except you, that the Nicene\r\nis the most historic creed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet un go on, let un go on!\xe2\x80\x9d said the auctioneer.\r\n\r\nBut Jude\xe2\x80\x99s mind seemed to grow confused soon, and he could not get on.\r\nHe put his hand to his forehead, and his face assumed an expression of\r\npain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him another glass\xe2\x80\x94then he\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch up and get through it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTinker Taylor.\r\n\r\nSomebody threw down threepence, the glass was handed, Jude stretched\r\nout his arm for it without looking, and having swallowed the liquor,\r\nwent on in a moment in a revived voice, raising it as he neared the end\r\nwith the manner of a priest leading a congregation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem, qui ex Patre\r\nFilioque procedit. Qui cum Patre et Filio simul adoratur et\r\nconglorificatur. Qui locutus est per prophetas._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Et unam Catholicam et Apostolicam Ecclesiam. Confiteor unum Baptisma\r\nin remissionem peccatorum. Et exspecto Resurrectionem mortuorum. Et\r\nvitam venturi saeculi. Amen._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done!\xe2\x80\x9d said several, enjoying the last word, as being the first\r\nand only one they had recognized.\r\n\r\nThen Jude seemed to shake the fumes from his brain, as he stared round\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pack of fools!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich one of you knows whether I have\r\nsaid it or no? It might have been the Ratcatcher\xe2\x80\x99s Daughter in double\r\nDutch for all that your besotted heads can tell! See what I have\r\nbrought myself to\xe2\x80\x94the crew I have come among!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord, who had already had his license endorsed for harbouring\r\nqueer characters, feared a riot, and came outside the counter; but\r\nJude, in his sudden flash of reason, had turned in disgust and left the\r\nscene, the door slamming with a dull thud behind him.\r\n\r\nHe hastened down the lane and round into the straight broad street,\r\nwhich he followed till it merged in the highway, and all sound of his\r\nlate companions had been left behind. Onward he still went, under the\r\ninfluence of a childlike yearning for the one being in the world to\r\nwhom it seemed possible to fly\xe2\x80\x94an unreasoning desire, whose ill\r\njudgement was not apparent to him now. In the course of an hour, when\r\nit was between ten and eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, he entered the village of\r\nLumsdon, and reaching the cottage, saw that a light was burning in a\r\ndownstairs room, which he assumed, rightly as it happened, to be hers.\r\n\r\nJude stepped close to the wall, and tapped with his finger on the pane,\r\nsaying impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cSue, Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe must have recognized his voice, for the light disappeared from the\r\napartment, and in a second or two the door was unlocked and opened, and\r\nSue appeared with a candle in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Jude? Yes, it is! My dear, dear cousin, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help coming, Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, sinking down upon the\r\ndoorstep. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so wicked, Sue\xe2\x80\x94my heart is nearly broken, and I could\r\nnot bear my life as it was! So I have been drinking, and blaspheming,\r\nor next door to it, and saying holy things in disreputable\r\nquarters\xe2\x80\x94repeating in idle bravado words which ought never to be\r\nuttered but reverently! Oh, do anything with me, Sue\xe2\x80\x94kill me\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare! Only don\xe2\x80\x99t hate me and despise me like all the rest of the\r\nworld!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are ill, poor dear! No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t despise you; of course I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\r\nCome in and rest, and let me see what I can do for you. Now lean on me,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d With one hand holding the candle and the other\r\nsupporting him, she led him indoors, and placed him in the only easy\r\nchair the meagrely furnished house afforded, stretching his feet upon\r\nanother, and pulling off his boots. Jude, now getting towards his sober\r\nsenses, could only say, \xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d in a voice broken by grief\r\nand contrition.\r\n\r\nShe asked him if he wanted anything to eat, but he shook his head. Then\r\ntelling him to go to sleep, and that she would come down early in the\r\nmorning and get him some breakfast, she bade him good-night and\r\nascended the stairs.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately he fell into a heavy slumber, and did not wake till\r\ndawn. At first he did not know where he was, but by degrees his\r\nsituation cleared to him, and he beheld it in all the ghastliness of a\r\nright mind. She knew the worst of him\xe2\x80\x94the very worst. How could he face\r\nher now? She would soon be coming down to see about breakfast, as she\r\nhad said, and there would he be in all his shame confronting her. He\r\ncould not bear the thought, and softly drawing on his boots, and taking\r\nhis hat from the nail on which she had hung it, he slipped noiselessly\r\nout of the house.\r\n\r\nHis fixed idea was to get away to some obscure spot and hide, and\r\nperhaps pray; and the only spot which occurred to him was Marygreen. He\r\ncalled at his lodging in Christminster, where he found awaiting him a\r\nnote of dismissal from his employer; and having packed up he turned his\r\nback upon the city that had been such a thorn in his side, and struck\r\nsouthward into Wessex. He had no money left in his pocket, his small\r\nsavings, deposited at one of the banks in Christminster, having\r\nfortunately been left untouched. To get to Marygreen, therefore, his\r\nonly course was walking; and the distance being nearly twenty miles, he\r\nhad ample time to complete on the way the sobering process begun in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAt some hour of the evening he reached Alfredston. Here he pawned his\r\nwaistcoat, and having gone out of the town a mile or two, slept under a\r\nrick that night. At dawn he rose, shook off the hayseeds and stems from\r\nhis clothes, and started again, breasting the long white road up the\r\nhill to the downs, which had been visible to him a long way off, and\r\npassing the milestone at the top, whereon he had carved his hopes years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nHe reached the ancient hamlet while the people were at breakfast. Weary\r\nand mud-bespattered, but quite possessed of his ordinary clearness of\r\nbrain, he sat down by the well, thinking as he did so what a poor\r\nChrist he made. Seeing a trough of water near he bathed his face, and\r\nwent on to the cottage of his great-aunt, whom he found breakfasting in\r\nbed, attended by the woman who lived with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94out o\xe2\x80\x99 work?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his relative, regarding him through eyes\r\nsunken deep, under lids heavy as pot-covers, no other cause for his\r\ntumbled appearance suggesting itself to one whose whole life had been a\r\nstruggle with material things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I must have a little rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRefreshed by some breakfast, he went up to his old room and lay down in\r\nhis shirt-sleeves, after the manner of the artizan. He fell asleep for\r\na short while, and when he awoke it was as if he had awakened in hell.\r\nIt _was_ hell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe hell of conscious failure,\xe2\x80\x9d both in ambition and in\r\nlove. He thought of that previous abyss into which he had fallen before\r\nleaving this part of the country; the deepest deep he had supposed it\r\nthen; but it was not so deep as this. That had been the breaking in of\r\nthe outer bulwarks of his hope: this was of his second line.\r\n\r\nIf he had been a woman he must have screamed under the nervous tension\r\nwhich he was now undergoing. But that relief being denied to his\r\nvirility, he clenched his teeth in misery, bringing lines about his\r\nmouth like those in the Laoco\xc3\xb6n, and corrugations between his brows.\r\n\r\nA mournful wind blew through the trees, and sounded in the chimney like\r\nthe pedal notes of an organ. Each ivy leaf overgrowing the wall of the\r\nchurchless church-yard hard by, now abandoned, pecked its neighbour\r\nsmartly, and the vane on the new Victorian-Gothic church in the new\r\nspot had already begun to creak. Yet apparently it was not always the\r\noutdoor wind that made the deep murmurs; it was a voice. He guessed its\r\norigin in a moment or two; the curate was praying with his aunt in the\r\nadjoining room. He remembered her speaking of him. Presently the sounds\r\nceased, and a step seemed to cross the landing. Jude sat up, and\r\nshouted \xe2\x80\x9cHoi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe step made for his door, which was open, and a man looked in. It was\r\na young clergyman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are Mr. Highridge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt has mentioned you\r\nmore than once. Well, here I am, just come home; a fellow gone to the\r\nbad; though I had the best intentions in the world at one time. Now I\r\nam melancholy mad, what with drinking and one thing and another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly Jude unfolded to the curate his late plans and movements, by an\r\nunconscious bias dwelling less upon the intellectual and ambitious side\r\nof his dream, and more upon the theological, though this had, up till\r\nnow, been merely a portion of the general plan of advancement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I know I have been a fool, and that folly is with me,\xe2\x80\x9d added Jude\r\nin conclusion. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t regret the collapse of my university hopes\r\none jot. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t begin again if I were sure to succeed. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nfor social success any more at all. But I do feel I should like to do\r\nsome good thing; and I bitterly regret the Church, and the loss of my\r\nchance of being her ordained minister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe curate, who was a new man to this neighbourhood, had grown deeply\r\ninterested, and at last he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you feel a real call to the\r\nministry, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t say from your conversation that you do not, for\r\nit is that of a thoughtful and educated man, you might enter the Church\r\nas a licentiate. Only you must make up your mind to avoid strong\r\ndrink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could avoid that easily enough, if I had any kind of hope to support\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Third AT MELCHESTER\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cFor there was no other girl, O bridegroom, like her!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\xe2\x80\x94SAPPHO (H. T. Wharton).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a new idea\xe2\x80\x94the ecclesiastical and altruistic life as distinct\r\nfrom the intellectual and emulative life. A man could preach and do\r\ngood to his fellow-creatures without taking double-firsts in the\r\nschools of Christminster, or having anything but ordinary knowledge.\r\nThe old fancy which had led on to the culminating vision of the\r\nbishopric had not been an ethical or theological enthusiasm at all, but\r\na mundane ambition masquerading in a surplice. He feared that his whole\r\nscheme had degenerated to, even though it might not have originated in,\r\na social unrest which had no foundation in the nobler instincts; which\r\nwas purely an artificial product of civilization. There were thousands\r\nof young men on the same self-seeking track at the present moment. The\r\nsensual hind who ate, drank, and lived carelessly with his wife through\r\nthe days of his vanity was a more likable being than he.\r\n\r\nBut to enter the Church in such an unscholarly way that he could not in\r\nany probability rise to a higher grade through all his career than that\r\nof the humble curate wearing his life out in an obscure village or city\r\nslum\xe2\x80\x94that might have a touch of goodness and greatness in it; that\r\nmight be true religion, and a purgatorial course worthy of being\r\nfollowed by a remorseful man.\r\n\r\nThe favourable light in which this new thought showed itself by\r\ncontrast with his foregone intentions cheered Jude, as he sat there,\r\nshabby and lonely; and it may be said to have given, during the next\r\nfew days, the _coup de gr\xc3\xa2ce_ to his intellectual career\xe2\x80\x94a career which\r\nhad extended over the greater part of a dozen years. He did nothing,\r\nhowever, for some long stagnant time to advance his new desire,\r\noccupying himself with little local jobs in putting up and lettering\r\nheadstones about the neighbouring villages, and submitting to be\r\nregarded as a social failure, a returned purchase, by the half-dozen or\r\nso of farmers and other country-people who condescended to nod to him.\r\n\r\nThe human interest of the new intention\xe2\x80\x94and a human interest is\r\nindispensable to the most spiritual and self-sacrificing\xe2\x80\x94was created by\r\na letter from Sue, bearing a fresh postmark. She evidently wrote with\r\nanxiety, and told very little about her own doings, more than that she\r\nhad passed some sort of examination for a Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Scholarship, and was\r\ngoing to enter a training college at Melchester to complete herself for\r\nthe vocation she had chosen, partly by his influence. There was a\r\ntheological college at Melchester; Melchester was a quiet and soothing\r\nplace, almost entirely ecclesiastical in its tone; a spot where worldly\r\nlearning and intellectual smartness had no establishment; where the\r\naltruistic feeling that he did possess would perhaps be more highly\r\nestimated than a brilliancy which he did not.\r\n\r\nAs it would be necessary that he should continue for a time to work at\r\nhis trade while reading up Divinity, which he had neglected at\r\nChristminster for the ordinary classical grind, what better course for\r\nhim than to get employment at the further city, and pursue this plan of\r\nreading? That his excessive human interest in the new place was\r\nentirely of Sue\xe2\x80\x99s making, while at the same time Sue was to be regarded\r\neven less than formerly as proper to create it, had an ethical\r\ncontradictoriness to which he was not blind. But that much he conceded\r\nto human frailty, and hoped to learn to love her only as a friend and\r\nkinswoman.\r\n\r\nHe considered that he might so mark out his coming years as to begin\r\nhis ministry at the age of thirty\xe2\x80\x94an age which much attracted him as\r\nbeing that of his exemplar when he first began to teach in Galilee.\r\nThis would allow him plenty of time for deliberate study, and for\r\nacquiring capital by his trade to help his aftercourse of keeping the\r\nnecessary terms at a theological college.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas had come and passed, and Sue had gone to the Melchester\r\nNormal School. The time was just the worst in the year for Jude to get\r\ninto new employment, and he had written suggesting to her that he\r\nshould postpone his arrival for a month or so, till the days had\r\nlengthened. She had acquiesced so readily that he wished he had not\r\nproposed it\xe2\x80\x94she evidently did not much care about him, though she had\r\nnever once reproached him for his strange conduct in coming to her that\r\nnight, and his silent disappearance. Neither had she ever said a word\r\nabout her relations with Mr. Phillotson.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, quite a passionate letter arrived from Sue. She was\r\nquite lonely and miserable, she told him. She hated the place she was\r\nin; it was worse than the ecclesiastical designer\xe2\x80\x99s; worse than\r\nanywhere. She felt utterly friendless; could he come\r\nimmediately?\xe2\x80\x94though when he did come she would only be able to see him\r\nat limited times, the rules of the establishment she found herself in\r\nbeing strict to a degree. It was Mr. Phillotson who had advised her to\r\ncome there, and she wished she had never listened to him.\r\n\r\nPhillotson\xe2\x80\x99s suit was not exactly prospering, evidently; and Jude felt\r\nunreasonably glad. He packed up his things and went to Melchester with\r\na lighter heart than he had known for months.\r\n\r\nThis being the turning over a new leaf he duly looked about for a\r\ntemperance hotel, and found a little establishment of that description\r\nin the street leading from the station. When he had had something to\r\neat he walked out into the dull winter light over the town bridge, and\r\nturned the corner towards the Close. The day was foggy, and standing\r\nunder the walls of the most graceful architectural pile in England he\r\npaused and looked up. The lofty building was visible as far as the\r\nroofridge; above, the dwindling spire rose more and more remotely, till\r\nits apex was quite lost in the mist drifting across it.\r\n\r\nThe lamps now began to be lighted, and turning to the west front he\r\nwalked round. He took it as a good omen that numerous blocks of stone\r\nwere lying about, which signified that the cathedral was undergoing\r\nrestoration or repair to a considerable extent. It seemed to him, full\r\nof the superstitions of his beliefs, that this was an exercise of\r\nforethought on the part of a ruling Power, that he might find plenty to\r\ndo in the art he practised while waiting for a call to higher labours.\r\n\r\nThen a wave of warmth came over him as he thought how near he now stood\r\nto the bright-eyed vivacious girl with the broad forehead and pile of\r\ndark hair above it; the girl with the kindling glance, daringly soft at\r\ntimes\xe2\x80\x94something like that of the girls he had seen in engravings from\r\npaintings of the Spanish school. She was here\xe2\x80\x94actually in this Close\xe2\x80\x94in\r\none of the houses confronting this very west fa\xc3\xa7ade.\r\n\r\nHe went down the broad gravel path towards the building. It was an\r\nancient edifice of the fifteenth century, once a palace, now a\r\ntraining-school, with mullioned and transomed windows, and a courtyard\r\nin front shut in from the road by a wall. Jude opened the gate and went\r\nup to the door through which, on inquiring for his cousin, he was\r\ngingerly admitted to a waiting-room, and in a few minutes she came.\r\n\r\nThough she had been here such a short while, she was not as he had seen\r\nher last. All her bounding manner was gone; her curves of motion had\r\nbecome subdued lines. The screens and subtleties of convention had\r\nlikewise disappeared. Yet neither was she quite the woman who had\r\nwritten the letter that summoned him. That had plainly been dashed off\r\nin an impulse which second thoughts had somewhat regretted; thoughts\r\nthat were possibly of his recent self-disgrace. Jude was quite overcome\r\nwith emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94think me a demoralized wretch\xe2\x80\x94for coming to you as I was\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ngoing so shamefully, Sue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have tried not to! You said enough to let me know what had\r\ncaused it. I hope I shall never have any doubt of your worthiness, my\r\npoor Jude! And I am glad you have come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wore a murrey-coloured gown with a little lace collar. It was made\r\nquite plain, and hung about her slight figure with clinging\r\ngracefulness. Her hair, which formerly she had worn according to the\r\ncustom of the day was now twisted up tightly, and she had altogether\r\nthe air of a woman clipped and pruned by severe discipline, an\r\nunder-brightness shining through from the depths which that discipline\r\nhad not yet been able to reach.\r\n\r\nShe had come forward prettily, but Jude felt that she had hardly\r\nexpected him to kiss her, as he was burning to do, under other colours\r\nthan those of cousinship. He could not perceive the least sign that Sue\r\nregarded him as a lover, or ever would do so, now that she knew the\r\nworst of him, even if he had the right to behave as one; and this\r\nhelped on his growing resolve to tell her of his matrimonial\r\nentanglement, which he had put off doing from time to time in sheer\r\ndread of losing the bliss of her company.\r\n\r\nSue came out into the town with him, and they walked and talked with\r\ntongues centred only on the passing moments. Jude said he would like to\r\nbuy her a little present of some sort, and then she confessed, with\r\nsomething of shame, that she was dreadfully hungry. They were kept on\r\nvery short allowances in the college, and a dinner, tea, and supper all\r\nin one was the present she most desired in the world. Jude thereupon\r\ntook her to an inn and ordered whatever the house afforded, which was\r\nnot much. The place, however, gave them a delightful opportunity for a\r\n_t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_, nobody else being in the room, and they talked freely.\r\n\r\nShe told him about the school as it was at that date, and the rough\r\nliving, and the mixed character of her fellow-students, gathered\r\ntogether from all parts of the diocese, and how she had to get up and\r\nwork by gas-light in the early morning, with all the bitterness of a\r\nyoung person to whom restraint was new. To all this he listened; but it\r\nwas not what he wanted especially to know\xe2\x80\x94her relations with\r\nPhillotson. That was what she did not tell. When they had sat and\r\neaten, Jude impulsively placed his hand upon hers; she looked up and\r\nsmiled, and took his quite freely into her own little soft one,\r\ndividing his fingers and coolly examining them, as if they were the\r\nfingers of a glove she was purchasing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour hands are rather rough, Jude, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. So would yours be if they held a mallet and chisel all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t dislike it, you know. I think it is noble to see a man\xe2\x80\x99s hands\r\nsubdued to what he works in\xe2\x80\xa6 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m rather glad I came to this\r\ntraining-school, after all. See how independent I shall be after the\r\ntwo years\xe2\x80\x99 training! I shall pass pretty high, I expect, and Mr.\r\nPhillotson will use his influence to get me a big school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had touched the subject at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a suspicion, a fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJude, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\xe2\x80\x94cared about you rather warmly, and perhaps wanted to\r\nmarry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t be such a silly boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has said something about it, I expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he had, what would it matter? An old man like him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come, Sue; he\xe2\x80\x99s not so very old. And I know what I saw him doing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot kissing me\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x99m certain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But putting his arm round your waist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94I remember. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was going to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wriggling out if it, Sue, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite kind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer ever-sensitive lip began to quiver, and her eye to blink, at\r\nsomething this reproof was deciding her to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you\xe2\x80\x99ll be angry if I tell you everything, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no real right to\r\nask you, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with the perverseness that was part of\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I have done: I have promised\xe2\x80\x94I have promised\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\nwill marry him when I come out of the training-school two years hence,\r\nand have got my certificate; his plan being that we shall then take a\r\nlarge double school in a great town\xe2\x80\x94he the boys\xe2\x80\x99 and I the girls\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nmarried school-teachers often do, and make a good income between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Sue! \xe2\x80\xa6 But of course it is right\xe2\x80\x94you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her and their eyes met, the reproach in his own belying\r\nhis words. Then he drew his hand quite away from hers, and turned his\r\nface in estrangement from her to the window. Sue regarded him passively\r\nwithout moving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would be angry!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with an air of no emotion\r\nwhatever. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94I am wrong, I suppose! I ought not to have let you\r\ncome to see me! We had better not meet again; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll only correspond\r\nat long intervals, on purely business matters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was just the one thing he would not be able to bear, as she\r\nprobably knew, and it brought him round at once. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, we will,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cYour being engaged can make no difference to me\r\nwhatever. I have a perfect right to see you when I want to; and I\r\nshall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t let us talk of it any more. It is quite spoiling our\r\nevening together. What does it matter about what one is going to do two\r\nyears hence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was something of a riddle to him, and he let the subject drift\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we go and sit in the cathedral?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, when their meal\r\nwas finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCathedral? Yes. Though I think I\xe2\x80\x99d rather sit in the railway station,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe answered, a remnant of vexation still in her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ncentre of the town life now. The cathedral has had its day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow modern you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo would you be if you had lived so much in the Middle Ages as I have\r\ndone these last few years! The cathedral was a very good place four or\r\nfive centuries ago; but it is played out now\xe2\x80\xa6 I am not modern, either.\r\nI am more ancient than medi\xc3\xa6valism, if you only knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude looked distressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t say any more of that!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow bad I am, from your point of view, or you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think so much of\r\nme, or care whether I was engaged or not. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s just time for us\r\nto walk round the Close, then I must go in, or I shall be locked out\r\nfor the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her to the gate and they parted. Jude had a conviction that his\r\nunhappy visit to her on that sad night had precipitated this marriage\r\nengagement, and it did anything but add to his happiness. Her reproach\r\nhad taken that shape, then, and not the shape of words. However, next\r\nday he set about seeking employment, which it was not so easy to get as\r\nat Christminster, there being, as a rule, less stone-cutting in\r\nprogress in this quiet city, and hands being mostly permanent. But he\r\nedged himself in by degrees. His first work was some carving at the\r\ncemetery on the hill; and ultimately he became engaged on the labour he\r\nmost desired\xe2\x80\x94the cathedral repairs, which were very extensive, the\r\nwhole interior stonework having been overhauled, to be largely replaced\r\nby new. It might be a labour of years to get it all done, and he had\r\nconfidence enough in his own skill with the mallet and chisel to feel\r\nthat it would be a matter of choice with himself how long he would\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nThe lodgings he took near the Close Gate would not have disgraced a\r\ncurate, the rent representing a higher percentage on his wages than\r\nmechanics of any sort usually care to pay. His combined bed and\r\nsitting-room was furnished with framed photographs of the rectories and\r\ndeaneries at which his landlady had lived as trusted servant in her\r\ntime, and the parlour downstairs bore a clock on the mantelpiece\r\ninscribed to the effect that it was presented to the same\r\nserious-minded woman by her fellow-servants on the occasion of her\r\nmarriage. Jude added to the furniture of his room by unpacking\r\nphotographs of the ecclesiastical carvings and monuments that he had\r\nexecuted with his own hands; and he was deemed a satisfactory\r\nacquisition as tenant of the vacant apartment.\r\n\r\nHe found an ample supply of theological books in the city book-shops,\r\nand with these his studies were recommenced in a different spirit and\r\ndirection from his former course. As a relaxation from the Fathers, and\r\nsuch stock works as Paley and Butler, he read Newman, Pusey, and many\r\nother modern lights. He hired a harmonium, set it up in his lodging,\r\nand practised chants thereon, single and double.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow is our grand day, you know. Where shall we go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have leave from three till nine. Wherever we can get to and come\r\nback from in that time. Not ruins, Jude\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94Wardour Castle. And then we can do Fonthill if we like\xe2\x80\x94all in the\r\nsame afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWardour is Gothic ruins\xe2\x80\x94and I hate Gothic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Quite otherwise. It is a classic building\xe2\x80\x94Corinthian, I think;\r\nwith a lot of pictures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94that will do. I like the sound of Corinthian. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir conversation had run thus some few weeks later, and next morning\r\nthey prepared to start. Every detail of the outing was a facet\r\nreflecting a sparkle to Jude, and he did not venture to meditate on the\r\nlife of inconsistency he was leading. His Sue\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was one lovely\r\nconundrum to him; he could say no more.\r\n\r\nThere duly came the charm of calling at the college door for her; her\r\nemergence in a nunlike simplicity of costume that was rather enforced\r\nthan desired; the traipsing along to the station, the porters\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x99your\r\nleave!,\xe2\x80\x9d the screaming of the trains\xe2\x80\x94everything formed the basis of a\r\nbeautiful crystallization. Nobody stared at Sue, because she was so\r\nplainly dressed, which comforted Jude in the thought that only himself\r\nknew the charms those habiliments subdued. A matter of ten pounds spent\r\nin a drapery-shop, which had no connection with her real life or her\r\nreal self, would have set all Melchester staring. The guard of the\r\ntrain thought they were lovers, and put them into a compartment all by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good intention wasted!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nJude did not respond. He thought the remark unnecessarily cruel, and\r\npartly untrue.\r\n\r\nThey reached the park and castle and wandered through the\r\npicture-galleries, Jude stopping by preference in front of the\r\ndevotional pictures by Del Sarto, Guido Reni, Spagnoletto,\r\nSassoferrato, Carlo Dolci, and others. Sue paused patiently beside him,\r\nand stole critical looks into his face as, regarding the Virgins, Holy\r\nFamilies, and Saints, it grew reverent and abstracted. When she had\r\nthoroughly estimated him at this, she would move on and wait for him\r\nbefore a Lely or Reynolds. It was evident that her cousin deeply\r\ninterested her, as one might be interested in a man puzzling out his\r\nway along a labyrinth from which one had one\xe2\x80\x99s self escaped.\r\n\r\nWhen they came out a long time still remained to them and Jude proposed\r\nthat as soon as they had had something to eat they should walk across\r\nthe high country to the north of their present position, and intercept\r\nthe train of another railway leading back to Melchester, at a station\r\nabout seven miles off. Sue, who was inclined for any adventure that\r\nwould intensify the sense of her day\xe2\x80\x99s freedom, readily agreed; and\r\naway they went, leaving the adjoining station behind them.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed open country, wide and high. They talked and bounded on,\r\nJude cutting from a little covert a long walking-stick for Sue as tall\r\nas herself, with a great crook, which made her look like a shepherdess.\r\nAbout half-way on their journey they crossed a main road running due\r\neast and west\xe2\x80\x94the old road from London to Land\xe2\x80\x99s End. They paused, and\r\nlooked up and down it for a moment, and remarked upon the desolation\r\nwhich had come over this once lively thoroughfare, while the wind\r\ndipped to earth and scooped straws and hay-stems from the ground.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the road and passed on, but during the next half-mile Sue\r\nseemed to grow tired, and Jude began to be distressed for her. They had\r\nwalked a good distance altogether, and if they could not reach the\r\nother station it would be rather awkward. For a long time there was no\r\ncottage visible on the wide expanse of down and turnip-land; but\r\npresently they came to a sheepfold, and next to the shepherd, pitching\r\nhurdles. He told them that the only house near was his mother\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nhis, pointing to a little dip ahead from which a faint blue smoke\r\narose, and recommended them to go on and rest there.\r\n\r\nThis they did, and entered the house, admitted by an old woman without\r\na single tooth, to whom they were as civil as strangers can be when\r\ntheir only chance of rest and shelter lies in the favour of the\r\nhouseholder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice little cottage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the niceness. I shall have to thatch it soon,\r\nand where the thatch is to come from I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell, for straw do get\r\nthat dear, that \xe2\x80\x99twill soon be cheaper to cover your house wi\xe2\x80\x99 chainey\r\nplates than thatch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat resting, and the shepherd came in. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ee mind I,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nwith a deprecating wave of the hand; \xe2\x80\x9cbide here as long as ye will. But\r\nmid you be thinking o\xe2\x80\x99 getting back to Melchester to-night by train?\r\nBecause you\xe2\x80\x99ll never do it in this world, since you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the lie\r\nof the country. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind going with ye some o\xe2\x80\x99 the ways, but even\r\nthen the train mid be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey started up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can bide here, you know, over the night\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99em, Mother? The\r\nplace is welcome to ye. \xe2\x80\x99Tis hard lying, rather, but volk may do\r\nworse.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to Jude and asked privately: \xe2\x80\x9cBe you a married\r\ncouple?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHsh\xe2\x80\x94no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I meant nothing ba\xe2\x80\x99dy\xe2\x80\x94not I! Well then, she can go into Mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, and you and I can lie in the outer chimmer after they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone\r\nthrough. I can call ye soon enough to catch the first train back.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve lost this one now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn consideration they decided to close with this offer, and drew up and\r\nshared with the shepherd and his mother the boiled bacon and greens for\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather like this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue, while their entertainers were clearing\r\naway the dishes. \xe2\x80\x9cOutside all laws except gravitation and germination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou only think you like it; you don\xe2\x80\x99t: you are quite a product of\r\ncivilization,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, a recollection of her engagement reviving his\r\nsoreness a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I am not, Jude. I like reading and all that, but I crave to get\r\nback to the life of my infancy and its freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember it so well? You seem to me to have nothing\r\nunconventional at all about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s inside me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Ishmaelite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn urban miss is what you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked severe disagreement, and turned away.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd aroused them the next morning, as he had said. It was\r\nbright and clear, and the four miles to the train were accomplished\r\npleasantly. When they had reached Melchester, and walked to the Close,\r\nand the gables of the old building in which she was again to be immured\r\nrose before Sue\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, she looked a little scared. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect I shall\r\ncatch it!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nThey rang the great bell and waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I bought something for you, which I had nearly forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid quickly, searching her pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a new little photograph of\r\nme. Would you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Would_ I!\xe2\x80\x9d He took it gladly, and the porter came. There seemed to be\r\nan ominous glance on his face when he opened the gate. She passed in,\r\nlooking back at Jude, and waving her hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventy young women, of ages varying in the main from nineteen to\r\none-and-twenty, though several were older, who at this date filled the\r\nspecies of nunnery known as the Training-School at Melchester, formed a\r\nvery mixed community, which included the daughters of mechanics,\r\ncurates, surgeons, shopkeepers, farmers, dairy-men, soldiers, sailors,\r\nand villagers. They sat in the large school-room of the establishment\r\non the evening previously described, and word was passed round that Sue\r\nBridehead had not come in at closing-time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went out with her young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said a second-year\xe2\x80\x99s student, who\r\nknew about young men. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Miss Traceley saw her at the station with\r\nhim. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have it hot when she does come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said he was her cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d observed a youthful new girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat excuse has been made a little too often in this school to be\r\neffectual in saving our souls,\xe2\x80\x9d said the head girl of the year, drily.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that, only twelve months before, there had occurred a\r\nlamentable seduction of one of the pupils who had made the same\r\nstatement in order to gain meetings with her lover. The affair had\r\ncreated a scandal, and the management had consequently been rough on\r\ncousins ever since.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the names were called, Sue\xe2\x80\x99s being pronounced three\r\ntimes sonorously by Miss Traceley without eliciting an answer.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past nine the seventy stood up to sing the \xe2\x80\x9cEvening Hymn,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand then knelt down to prayers. After prayers they went in to supper,\r\nand every girl\xe2\x80\x99s thought was, Where is Sue Bridehead? Some of the\r\nstudents, who had seen Jude from the window, felt that they would not\r\nmind risking her punishment for the pleasure of being kissed by such a\r\nkindly-faced young man. Hardly one among them believed in the\r\ncousinship.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later they all lay in their cubicles, their tender\r\nfeminine faces upturned to the flaring gas-jets which at intervals\r\nstretched down the long dormitories, every face bearing the legend \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nWeaker\xe2\x80\x9d upon it, as the penalty of the sex wherein they were moulded,\r\nwhich by no possible exertion of their willing hearts and abilities\r\ncould be made strong while the inexorable laws of nature remain what\r\nthey are. They formed a pretty, suggestive, pathetic sight, of whose\r\npathos and beauty they were themselves unconscious, and would not\r\ndiscover till, amid the storms and strains of after-years, with their\r\ninjustice, loneliness, child-bearing, and bereavement, their minds\r\nwould revert to this experience as to something which had been allowed\r\nto slip past them insufficiently regarded.\r\n\r\nOne of the mistresses came in to turn out the lights, and before doing\r\nso gave a final glance at Sue\xe2\x80\x99s cot, which remained empty, and at her\r\nlittle dressing-table at the foot, which, like all the rest, was\r\nornamented with various girlish trifles, framed photographs being not\r\nthe least conspicuous among them. Sue\xe2\x80\x99s table had a moderate show, two\r\nmen in their filigree and velvet frames standing together beside her\r\nlooking-glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are these men\xe2\x80\x94did she ever say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the mistress. \xe2\x80\x9cStrictly\r\nspeaking, relations\xe2\x80\x99 portraits only are allowed on these tables, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\x94the middle-aged man,\xe2\x80\x9d said a student in the next bed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis the\r\nschoolmaster she served under\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Phillotson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the other\xe2\x80\x94this undergraduate in cap and gown\xe2\x80\x94who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a friend, or was. She has never told his name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it either of these two who came for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure \xe2\x80\x99twas not the undergraduate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite. He was a young man with a black beard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lights were promptly extinguished, and till they fell asleep the\r\ngirls indulged in conjectures about Sue, and wondered what games she\r\nhad carried on in London and at Christminster before she came here,\r\nsome of the more restless ones getting out of bed and looking from the\r\nmullioned windows at the vast west front of the cathedral opposite, and\r\nthe spire rising behind it.\r\n\r\nWhen they awoke the next morning they glanced into Sue\xe2\x80\x99s nook, to find\r\nit still without a tenant. After the early lessons by gas-light, in\r\nhalf-toilet, and when they had come up to dress for breakfast, the bell\r\nof the entrance gate was heard to ring loudly. The mistress of the\r\ndormitory went away, and presently came back to say that the\r\nprincipal\xe2\x80\x99s orders were that nobody was to speak to Bridehead without\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nWhen, accordingly, Sue came into the dormitory to hastily tidy herself,\r\nlooking flushed and tired, she went to her cubicle in silence, none of\r\nthem coming out to greet her or to make inquiry. When they had gone\r\ndownstairs they found that she did not follow them into the dining-hall\r\nto breakfast, and they then learnt that she had been severely\r\nreprimanded, and ordered to a solitary room for a week, there to be\r\nconfined, and take her meals, and do all her reading.\r\n\r\nAt this the seventy murmured, the sentence being, they thought, too\r\nsevere. A round robin was prepared and sent in to the principal, asking\r\nfor a remission of Sue\xe2\x80\x99s punishment. No notice was taken. Towards\r\nevening, when the geography mistress began dictating her subject, the\r\ngirls in the class sat with folded arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that you are not going to work?\xe2\x80\x9d said the mistress at last.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may as well tell you that it has been ascertained that the young man\r\nBridehead stayed out with was not her cousin, for the very good reason\r\nthat she has no such relative. We have written to Christminster to\r\nascertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are willing to take her word,\xe2\x80\x9d said the head girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis young man was discharged from his work at Christminster for\r\ndrunkenness and blasphemy in public-houses, and he has come here to\r\nlive, entirely to be near her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, they remained stolid and motionless, and the mistress left the\r\nroom to inquire from her superiors what was to be done.\r\n\r\nPresently, towards dusk, the pupils, as they sat, heard exclamations\r\nfrom the first-year\xe2\x80\x99s girls in an adjoining classroom, and one rushed\r\nin to say that Sue Bridehead had got out of the back window of the room\r\nin which she had been confined, escaped in the dark across the lawn,\r\nand disappeared. How she had managed to get out of the garden nobody\r\ncould tell, as it was bounded by the river at the bottom, and the side\r\ndoor was locked.\r\n\r\nThey went and looked at the empty room, the casement between the middle\r\nmullions of which stood open. The lawn was again searched with a\r\nlantern, every bush and shrub being examined, but she was nowhere\r\nhidden. Then the porter of the front gate was interrogated, and on\r\nreflection he said that he remembered hearing a sort of splashing in\r\nthe stream at the back, but he had taken no notice, thinking some ducks\r\nhad come down the river from above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must have walked through the river!\xe2\x80\x9d said a mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr drownded herself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the porter.\r\n\r\nThe mind of the matron was horrified\xe2\x80\x94not so much at the possible death\r\nof Sue as at the possible half-column detailing that event in all the\r\nnewspapers, which, added to the scandal of the year before, would give\r\nthe college an unenviable notoriety for many months to come.\r\n\r\nMore lanterns were procured, and the river examined; and then, at last,\r\non the opposite shore, which was open to the fields, some little\r\nboot-tracks were discerned in the mud, which left no doubt that the too\r\nexcitable girl had waded through a depth of water reaching nearly to\r\nher shoulders\xe2\x80\x94for this was the chief river of the county, and was\r\nmentioned in all the geography books with respect. As Sue had not\r\nbrought disgrace upon the school by drowning herself, the matron began\r\nto speak superciliously of her, and to express gladness that she was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nOn the self-same evening Jude sat in his lodgings by the Close Gate.\r\nOften at this hour after dusk he would enter the silent Close, and\r\nstand opposite the house that contained Sue, and watch the shadows of\r\nthe girls\xe2\x80\x99 heads passing to and fro upon the blinds, and wish he had\r\nnothing else to do but to sit reading and learning all day what many of\r\nthe thoughtless inmates despised. But to-night, having finished tea and\r\nbrushed himself up, he was deep in the perusal of the Twenty-ninth\r\nVolume of Pusey\xe2\x80\x99s Library of the Fathers, a set of books which he had\r\npurchased of a second-hand dealer at a price that seemed to him to be\r\none of miraculous cheapness for that invaluable work. He fancied he\r\nheard something rattle lightly against his window; then he heard it\r\nagain. Certainly somebody had thrown gravel. He rose and gently lifted\r\nthe sash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJude!\xe2\x80\x9d (from below).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94it is! Can I come up without being seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t come down. Shut the window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude waited, knowing that she could enter easily enough, the front door\r\nbeing opened merely by a knob which anybody could turn, as in most old\r\ncountry towns. He palpitated at the thought that she had fled to him in\r\nher trouble as he had fled to her in his. What counterparts they were!\r\nHe unlatched the door of his room, heard a stealthy rustle on the dark\r\nstairs, and in a moment she appeared in the light of his lamp. He went\r\nup to seize her hand, and found she was clammy as a marine deity, and\r\nthat her clothes clung to her like the robes upon the figures in the\r\nParthenon frieze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so cold!\xe2\x80\x9d she said through her chattering teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I come by\r\nyour fire, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe crossed to his little grate and very little fire, but as the water\r\ndripped from her as she moved, the idea of drying herself was absurd.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever have you done, darling?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with alarm, the tender\r\nepithet slipping out unawares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalked through the largest river in the county\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done!\r\nThey locked me up for being out with you; and it seemed so unjust that\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear it, so I got out of the window and escaped across the\r\nstream!\xe2\x80\x9d She had begun the explanation in her usual slightly\r\nindependent tones, but before she had finished the thin pink lips\r\ntrembled, and she could hardly refrain from crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must take off all your things! And let me\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x94you must borrow some from the landlady. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her know, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! We are so near the school\r\nthat they\xe2\x80\x99ll come after me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must put on mine. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Sunday suit, you know. It is close here.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, everything was\r\nclose and handy in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s single chamber, because there was not room\r\nfor it to be otherwise. He opened a drawer, took out his best dark\r\nsuit, and giving the garments a shake, said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, how long shall I\r\ngive you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude left the room and went into the street, where he walked up and\r\ndown. A clock struck half-past seven, and he returned. Sitting in his\r\nonly arm-chair he saw a slim and fragile being masquerading as himself\r\non a Sunday, so pathetic in her defencelessness that his heart felt big\r\nwith the sense of it. On two other chairs before the fire were her wet\r\ngarments. She blushed as he sat down beside her, but only for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, Jude, it is odd that you should see me like this and all my\r\nthings hanging there? Yet what nonsense! They are only a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothes\xe2\x80\x94sexless cloth and linen\xe2\x80\xa6 I wish I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel so ill and sick!\r\nWill you dry my clothes now? Please do, Jude, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get a lodging by\r\nand by. It is not late yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you shan\xe2\x80\x99t, if you are ill. You must stay here. Dear, dear Sue,\r\nwhat can I get for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know! I can\xe2\x80\x99t help shivering. I wish I could get warm.\xe2\x80\x9d Jude\r\nput on her his great-coat in addition, and then ran out to the nearest\r\npublic-house, whence he returned with a little bottle in his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s six of best brandy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you drink it, dear; all of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t out of the bottle, can I?\xe2\x80\x9d Jude fetched the glass from the\r\ndressing-table, and administered the spirit in some water. She gasped a\r\nlittle, but gulped it down, and lay back in the armchair.\r\n\r\nShe then began to relate circumstantially her experiences since they\r\nhad parted; but in the middle of her story her voice faltered, her head\r\nnodded, and she ceased. She was in a sound sleep. Jude, dying of\r\nanxiety lest she should have caught a chill which might permanently\r\ninjure her, was glad to hear the regular breathing. He softly went\r\nnearer to her, and observed that a warm flush now rosed her hitherto\r\nblue cheeks, and felt that her hanging hand was no longer cold. Then he\r\nstood with his back to the fire regarding her, and saw in her almost a\r\ndivinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s reverie was interrupted by the creak of footsteps ascending the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nHe whisked Sue\xe2\x80\x99s clothing from the chair where it was drying, thrust it\r\nunder the bed, and sat down to his book. Somebody knocked and opened\r\nthe door immediately. It was the landlady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you was in or not, Mr. Fawley. I wanted to\r\nknow if you would require supper. I see you\xe2\x80\x99ve a young gentleman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. But I think I won\xe2\x80\x99t come down to-night. Will you bring\r\nsupper up on a tray, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a cup of tea as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Jude\xe2\x80\x99s custom to go downstairs to the kitchen, and eat his meals\r\nwith the family, to save trouble. His landlady brought up the supper,\r\nhowever, on this occasion, and he took it from her at the door.\r\n\r\nWhen she had descended he set the teapot on the hob, and drew out Sue\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothes anew; but they were far from dry. A thick woollen gown, he\r\nfound, held a deal of water. So he hung them up again, and enlarged his\r\nfire and mused as the steam from the garments went up the chimney.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she said, \xe2\x80\x9cJude!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. All right. How do you feel now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter. Quite well. Why, I fell asleep, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I? What time is it? Not\r\nlate surely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is past ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it really? What _shall_ I do!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, starting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to do. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they would say!\r\nAnd what will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to sit here by the fire all night, and read. To-morrow is\r\nSunday, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t to go out anywhere. Perhaps you will be saved a\r\nsevere illness by resting there. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened. I\xe2\x80\x99m all right.\r\nLook here, what I have got for you. Some supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had sat upright she breathed plaintively and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do feel\r\nrather weak still. I thought I was well; and I ought not to be here,\r\nought I?\xe2\x80\x9d But the supper fortified her somewhat, and when she had had\r\nsome tea and had lain back again she was bright and cheerful.\r\n\r\nThe tea must have been green, or too long drawn, for she seemed\r\npreternaturally wakeful afterwards, though Jude, who had not taken any,\r\nbegan to feel heavy; till her conversation fixed his attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou called me a creature of civilization, or something, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, breaking a silence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very odd you should have done\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, because it is provokingly wrong. I am a sort of negation of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very philosophical. \xe2\x80\x98A negation\xe2\x80\x99 is profound talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it? Do I strike you as being learned?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a touch of\r\nraillery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not learned. Only you don\xe2\x80\x99t talk quite like a girl\xe2\x80\x94well, a girl who\r\nhas had no advantages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had advantages. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know Latin and Greek, though I know the\r\ngrammars of those tongues. But I know most of the Greek and Latin\r\nclassics through translations, and other books too. I read Lempri\xc3\xa8re,\r\nCatullus, Martial, Juvenal, Lucian, Beaumont and Fletcher, Boccaccio,\r\nScarron, De Brant\xc3\xb4me, Sterne, De Foe, Smollett, Fielding, Shakespeare,\r\nthe Bible, and other such; and found that all interest in the\r\nunwholesome part of those books ended with its mystery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have read more than I,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cHow came you to read\r\nsome of those queerer ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cit was by accident. My life has been\r\nentirely shaped by what people call a peculiarity in me. I have no fear\r\nof men, as such, nor of their books. I have mixed with them\xe2\x80\x94one or two\r\nof them particularly\xe2\x80\x94almost as one of their own sex. I mean I have not\r\nfelt about them as most women are taught to feel\xe2\x80\x94to be on their guard\r\nagainst attacks on their virtue; for no average man\xe2\x80\x94no man short of a\r\nsensual savage\xe2\x80\x94will molest a woman by day or night, at home or abroad,\r\nunless she invites him. Until she says by a look \xe2\x80\x98Come on\xe2\x80\x99 he is always\r\nafraid to, and if you never say it, or look it, he never comes.\r\nHowever, what I was going to say is that when I was eighteen I formed a\r\nfriendly intimacy with an undergraduate at Christminster, and he taught\r\nme a great deal, and lent me books which I should never have got hold\r\nof otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your friendship broken off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. He died, poor fellow, two or three years after he had taken\r\nhis degree and left Christminster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw a good deal of him, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. We used to go about together\xe2\x80\x94on walking tours, reading tours, and\r\nthings of that sort\xe2\x80\x94like two men almost. He asked me to live with him,\r\nand I agreed to by letter. But when I joined him in London I found he\r\nmeant a different thing from what I meant. He wanted me to be his\r\nmistress, in fact, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in love with him\xe2\x80\x94and on my saying I\r\nshould go away if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree to _my_ plan, he did so. We shared a\r\nsitting-room for fifteen months; and he became a leader-writer for one\r\nof the great London dailies; till he was taken ill, and had to go\r\nabroad. He said I was breaking his heart by holding out against him so\r\nlong at such close quarters; he could never have believed it of woman.\r\nI might play that game once too often, he said. He came home merely to\r\ndie. His death caused a terrible remorse in me for my cruelty\xe2\x80\x94though I\r\nhope he died of consumption and not of me entirely. I went down to\r\nSandbourne to his funeral, and was his only mourner. He left me a\r\nlittle money\xe2\x80\x94because I broke his heart, I suppose. That\xe2\x80\x99s how men\r\nare\xe2\x80\x94so much better than women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x94what did you do then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94now you are angry with me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a contralto note of tragedy\r\ncoming suddenly into her silvery voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told you if I\r\nhad known!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not. Tell me all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I invested his money, poor fellow, in a bubble scheme, and lost\r\nit. I lived about London by myself for some time, and then I returned\r\nto Christminster, as my father\xe2\x80\x94 who was also in London, and had started\r\nas an art metal-worker near Long-Acre\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have me back; and I got\r\nthat occupation in the artist-shop where you found me\xe2\x80\xa6 I said you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know how bad I was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude looked round upon the arm-chair and its occupant, as if to read\r\nmore carefully the creature he had given shelter to. His voice trembled\r\nas he said: \xe2\x80\x9cHowever you have lived, Sue, I believe you are as innocent\r\nas you are unconventional!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not particularly innocent, as you see, now that I have\r\n\r\n                                        \xe2\x80\x98twitched the robe\r\nFrom that blank lay-figure your fancy draped,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nsaid she, with an ostensible sneer, though he could hear that she was\r\nbrimming with tears. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have never yielded myself to any lover, if\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean! I have remained as I began.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite believe you. But some women would not have remained as they\r\nbegan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not. Better women would not. People say I must be\r\ncold-natured\xe2\x80\x94sexless\xe2\x80\x94on account of it. But I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it! Some of the\r\nmost passionately erotic poets have been the most self-contained in\r\ntheir daily lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you told Mr. Phillotson about this university scholar friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94long ago. I have never made any secret of it to anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not pass any criticism\xe2\x80\x94only said I was everything to him,\r\nwhatever I did; and things like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude felt much depressed; she seemed to get further and further away\r\nfrom him with her strange ways and curious unconsciousness of gender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you _really_ vexed with me, dear Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d she suddenly asked, in\r\na voice of such extraordinary tenderness that it hardly seemed to come\r\nfrom the same woman who had just told her story so lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cI would\r\nrather offend anybody in the world than you, I think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I am vexed or not. I know I care very much about\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI care as much for you as for anybody I ever met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t care _more_! There, I ought not to say that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t answer\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another long silence. He felt that she was treating him\r\ncruelly, though he could not quite say in what way. Her very\r\nhelplessness seemed to make her so much stronger than he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am awfully ignorant on general matters, although I have worked so\r\nhard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, to turn the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cI am absorbed in theology, you\r\nknow. And what do you think I should be doing just about now, if you\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t here? I should be saying my evening prayers. I suppose you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. I\r\nshould seem so\xe2\x80\x94such a hypocrite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t join, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t propose it. You must remember\r\nthat I hope to be a useful minister some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be ordained, I think you said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you haven\xe2\x80\x99t given up the idea?\xe2\x80\x94I thought that perhaps you had by\r\nthis time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not. I fondly thought at first that you felt as I do about\r\nthat, as you were so mixed up in Christminster Anglicanism. And Mr.\r\nPhillotson\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no respect for Christminster whatever, except, in a qualified\r\ndegree, on its intellectual side,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue Bridehead earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nfriend I spoke of took that out of me. He was the most irreligious man\r\nI ever knew, and the most moral. And intellect at Christminster is new\r\nwine in old bottles. The medi\xc3\xa6valism of Christminster must go, be\r\nsloughed off, or Christminster itself will have to go. To be sure, at\r\ntimes one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help having a sneaking liking for the traditions of\r\nthe old faith, as preserved by a section of the thinkers there in\r\ntouching and simple sincerity; but when I was in my saddest, rightest\r\nmind I always felt,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue, you are not a good friend of mine to talk like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I won\xe2\x80\x99t, dear Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d The emotional throat-note had come back, and\r\nshe turned her face away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still think Christminster has much that is glorious; though I was\r\nresentful because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get there.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke gently, and resisted\r\nhis impulse to pique her on to tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an ignorant place, except as to the townspeople, artizans,\r\ndrunkards, and paupers,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, perverse still at his differing from\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9c_They_ see life as it is, of course; but few of the people in the\r\ncolleges do. You prove it in your own person. You are one of the very\r\nmen Christminster was intended for when the colleges were founded; a\r\nman with a passion for learning, but no money, or opportunities, or\r\nfriends. But you were elbowed off the pavement by the millionaires\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can do without what it confers. I care for something higher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I for something broader, truer,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cAt present\r\nintellect in Christminster is pushing one way, and religion the other;\r\nand so they stand stock-still, like two rams butting each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would Mr. Phillotson\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a place full of fetishists and ghost-seers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe noticed that whenever he tried to speak of the schoolmaster she\r\nturned the conversation to some generalizations about the offending\r\nuniversity. Jude was extremely, morbidly, curious about her life as\r\nPhillotson\xe2\x80\x99s _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e_ and betrothed; yet she would not enlighten him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s just what I am, too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am fearful of life,\r\nspectre-seeing always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are good and dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nHis heart bumped, and he made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in the Tractarian stage just now, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nputting on flippancy to hide real feeling, a common trick with her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see\xe2\x80\x94when was I there? In the year eighteen hundred and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a sarcasm in that which is rather unpleasant to me, Sue. Now\r\nwill you do what I want you to? At this time I read a chapter, and then\r\nsay prayers, as I told you. Now will you concentrate your attention on\r\nany book of these you like, and sit with your back to me, and leave me\r\nto my custom? You are sure you won\xe2\x80\x99t join me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll look at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tease, Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll do just as you bid me, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t vex you, Jude,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreplied, in the tone of a child who was going to be good for ever\r\nafter, turning her back upon him accordingly. A small Bible other than\r\nthe one he was using lay near her, and during his retreat she took it\r\nup, and turned over the leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJude,\xe2\x80\x9d she said brightly, when he had finished and come back to her;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwill you let me make you a _new_ New Testament, like the one I made\r\nfor myself at Christminster?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes. How was that made?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI altered my old one by cutting up all the Epistles and Gospels into\r\nseparate _brochures_, and rearranging them in chronological order as\r\nwritten, beginning the book with Thessalonians, following on with the\r\nEpistles, and putting the Gospels much further on. Then I had the\r\nvolume rebound. My university friend Mr.\xe2\x80\x94but never mind his name, poor\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x94said it was an excellent idea. I know that reading it afterwards\r\nmade it twice as interesting as before, and twice as understandable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, with a sense of sacrilege.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a literary enormity this is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she glanced into\r\nthe pages of Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s Song. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean the synopsis at the head of each\r\nchapter, explaining away the real nature of that rhapsody. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe alarmed: nobody claims inspiration for the chapter headings. Indeed,\r\nmany divines treat them with contempt. It seems the drollest thing to\r\nthink of the four-and-twenty elders, or bishops, or whatever number\r\nthey were, sitting with long faces and writing down such stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude looked pained. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite Voltairean!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? Then I won\xe2\x80\x99t say any more, except that people have no right to\r\nfalsify the Bible! I _hate_ such hum-bug as could attempt to plaster\r\nover with ecclesiastical abstractions such ecstatic, natural, human\r\nlove as lies in that great and passionate song!\xe2\x80\x9d Her speech had grown\r\nspirited, and almost petulant at his rebuke, and her eyes moist. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n_wish_ I had a friend here to support me; but nobody is ever on my\r\nside!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my dear Sue, my very dear Sue, I am not against you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ntaking her hand, and surprised at her introducing personal feeling into\r\nmere argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes you are, yes you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, turning away her face that he\r\nmight not see her brimming eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are on the side of the people in\r\nthe training-school\xe2\x80\x94at least you seem almost to be! What I insist on\r\nis, that to explain such verses as this: \xe2\x80\x98Whither is thy beloved gone,\r\nO thou fairest among women?\xe2\x80\x99 by the note: \xe2\x80\x98_The Church professeth her\r\nfaith_,\xe2\x80\x99 is supremely ridiculous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, let it be! You make such a personal matter of everything! I\r\nam\xe2\x80\x94only too inclined just now to apply the words profanely. You know\r\n_you_ are fairest among women to me, come to that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not to say it now!\xe2\x80\x9d Sue replied, her voice changing to its\r\nsoftest note of severity. Then their eyes met, and they shook hands\r\nlike cronies in a tavern, and Jude saw the absurdity of quarrelling on\r\nsuch a hypothetical subject, and she the silliness of crying about what\r\nwas written in an old book like the Bible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t disturb your convictions\xe2\x80\x94I really won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on\r\nsoothingly, for now he was rather more ruffled than she. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I did\r\nwant and long to ennoble some man to high aims; and when I saw you, and\r\nknew you wanted to be my comrade, I\xe2\x80\x94shall I confess it?\xe2\x80\x94thought that\r\nman might be you. But you take so much tradition on trust that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear; I suppose one must take some things on trust. Life isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlong enough to work out everything in Euclid problems before you\r\nbelieve it. I take Christianity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps you might take something worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I might. Perhaps I have done so!\xe2\x80\x9d He thought of Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t ask what, because we are going to be _very_ nice with each\r\nother, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we, and never, never, vex each other any more?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlooked up trustfully, and her voice seemed trying to nestle in his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall always care for you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I for you. Because you are single-hearted, and forgiving to your\r\nfaulty and tiresome little Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked away, for that epicene tenderness of hers was too harrowing.\r\nWas it that which had broken the heart of the poor leader-writer; and\r\nwas he to be the next one? \xe2\x80\xa6 But Sue was so dear! \xe2\x80\xa6 If he could only\r\nget over the sense of her sex, as she seemed to be able to do so easily\r\nof his, what a comrade she would make; for their difference of opinion\r\non conjectural subjects only drew them closer together on matters of\r\ndaily human experience. She was nearer to him than any other woman he\r\nhad ever met, and he could scarcely believe that time, creed, or\r\nabsence, would ever divide him from her.\r\n\r\nBut his grief at her incredulities returned. They sat on till she fell\r\nasleep again, and he nodded in his chair likewise. Whenever he aroused\r\nhimself he turned her things, and made up the fire anew. About six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock he awoke completely, and lighting a candle, found that her\r\nclothes were dry. Her chair being a far more comfortable one than his\r\nshe still slept on inside his great-coat, looking warm as a new bun and\r\nboyish as a Ganymede. Placing the garments by her and touching her on\r\nthe shoulder he went downstairs, and washed himself by starlight in the\r\nyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he returned she was dressed as usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow could I get out without anybody seeing me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThe town\r\nis not yet astir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have had no breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any! I fear I ought not to have run away from that\r\nschool! Things seem so different in the cold light of morning, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey? What Mr. Phillotson will say I don\xe2\x80\x99t know! It was quite by his\r\nwish that I went there. He is the only man in the world for whom I have\r\nany respect or fear. I hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me; but he\xe2\x80\x99ll scold me\r\ndreadfully, I expect!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to him and explain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, you shan\xe2\x80\x99t. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for him! He may think what he likes\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nshall do just as I choose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you just this moment said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I did, I shall do as I like for all him! I have thought of\r\nwhat I shall do\xe2\x80\x94go to the sister of one of my fellow-students in the\r\ntraining-school, who has asked me to visit her. She has a school near\r\nShaston, about eighteen miles from here\xe2\x80\x94and I shall stay there till\r\nthis has blown over, and I get back to the training-school again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the last moment he persuaded her to let him make her a cup of\r\ncoffee, in a portable apparatus he kept in his room for use on rising\r\nto go to his work every day before the household was astir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow a dew-bit to eat with it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand off we go. You can have a\r\nregular breakfast when you get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went quietly out of the house, Jude accompanying her to the\r\nstation. As they departed along the street a head was thrust out of an\r\nupper window of his lodging and quickly withdrawn. Sue still seemed\r\nsorry for her rashness, and to wish she had not rebelled; telling him\r\nat parting that she would let him know as soon as she got re-admitted\r\nto the training-school. They stood rather miserably together on the\r\nplatform; and it was apparent that he wanted to say more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you something\xe2\x80\x94two things,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hurriedly as the\r\ntrain came up. \xe2\x80\x9cOne is a warm one, the other a cold one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJude,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know one of them. And you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t love me. You are to like me\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s face became so full of complicated glooms that hers was agitated\r\nin sympathy as she bade him adieu through the carriage window. And then\r\nthe train moved on, and waving her pretty hand to him she vanished\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMelchester was a dismal place enough for Jude that Sunday of her\r\ndeparture, and the Close so hateful that he did not go once to the\r\ncathedral services. The next morning there came a letter from her,\r\nwhich, with her usual promptitude, she had written directly she had\r\nreached her friend\xe2\x80\x99s house. She told him of her safe arrival and\r\ncomfortable quarters, and then added:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nWhat I really write about, dear Jude, is something I said to you at\r\nparting. You had been so very good and kind to me that when you were\r\nout of sight I felt what a cruel and ungrateful woman I was to say it,\r\nand it has reproached me ever since. _If you want to love me, Jude, you\r\nmay_: I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind at all; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll never say again that you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t!\r\n    Now I won\xe2\x80\x99t write any more about that. You do forgive your\r\n    thoughtless friend for her cruelty? and won\xe2\x80\x99t make her miserable by\r\n    saying you don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x94Ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nSUE.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to say what his answer was; and how he thought\r\nwhat he would have done had he been free, which should have rendered a\r\nlong residence with a female friend quite unnecessary for Sue. He felt\r\nhe might have been pretty sure of his own victory if it had come to a\r\nconflict between Phillotson and himself for the possession of her.\r\n\r\nYet Jude was in danger of attaching more meaning to Sue\xe2\x80\x99s impulsive\r\nnote than it really was intended to bear.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a few days he found himself hoping that she would\r\nwrite again. But he received no further communication; and in the\r\nintensity of his solicitude he sent another note, suggesting that he\r\nshould pay her a visit some Sunday, the distance being under eighteen\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nHe expected a reply on the second morning after despatching his\r\nmissive; but none came. The third morning arrived; the postman did not\r\nstop. This was Saturday, and in a feverish state of anxiety about her\r\nhe sent off three brief lines stating that he was coming the following\r\nday, for he felt sure something had happened.\r\n\r\nHis first and natural thought had been that she was ill from her\r\nimmersion; but it soon occurred to him that somebody would have written\r\nfor her in such a case. Conjectures were put an end to by his arrival\r\nat the village school-house near Shaston on the bright morning of\r\nSunday, between eleven and twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when the parish was as\r\nvacant as a desert, most of the inhabitants having gathered inside the\r\nchurch, whence their voices could occasionally be heard in unison.\r\n\r\nA little girl opened the door. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bridehead is up-stairs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you please walk up to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she ill?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jude hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a little\xe2\x80\x94not very.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude entered and ascended. On reaching the landing a voice told him\r\nwhich way to turn\xe2\x80\x94the voice of Sue calling his name. He passed the\r\ndoorway, and found her lying in a little bed in a room a dozen feet\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, sitting down beside her and taking her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nis this! You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t write?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI did catch a bad cold\xe2\x80\x94but I could\r\nhave written. Only I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x94frightening me like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94that was what I was afraid of! But I had decided not to write to\r\nyou any more. They won\xe2\x80\x99t have me back at the school\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t write. Not the fact, but the reason!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey not only won\xe2\x80\x99t have me, but they gave me a parting piece of\r\nadvice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer directly. \xe2\x80\x9cI vowed I never would tell you, Jude\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nis so vulgar and distressing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it about us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94somebody has sent them baseless reports about us, and they say\r\nyou and I ought to marry as soon as possible, for the sake of my\r\nreputation! \xe2\x80\xa6 There\xe2\x80\x94now I have told you, and I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, poor Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think of you like that means! It did just _occur_ to me to\r\nregard you in the way they think I do, but I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t begun to. I _have_\r\nrecognized that the cousinship was merely nominal, since we met as\r\ntotal strangers. But my marrying you, dear Jude\xe2\x80\x94why, of course, if I\r\nhad reckoned upon marrying you I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come to you so often!\r\nAnd I never supposed you thought of such a thing as marrying me till\r\nthe other evening; when I began to fancy you did love me a little.\r\nPerhaps I ought not to have been so intimate with you. It is all my\r\nfault. Everything is my fault always!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speech seemed a little forced and unreal, and they regarded each\r\nother with a mutual distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so blind at first!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see what you felt at\r\nall. Oh, you have been unkind to me\xe2\x80\x94you have\xe2\x80\x94to look upon me as a\r\nsweetheart without saying a word, and leaving me to discover it myself!\r\nYour attitude to me has become known; and naturally they think we\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen doing wrong! I\xe2\x80\x99ll never trust you again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sue,\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply; \xe2\x80\x9cI am to blame\xe2\x80\x94more than you think. I was\r\nquite aware that you did not suspect till within the last meeting or\r\ntwo what I was feeling about you. I admit that our meeting as strangers\r\nprevented a sense of relationship, and that it was a sort of subterfuge\r\nto avail myself of it. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I deserve a little\r\nconsideration for concealing my wrong, very wrong, sentiments, since I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help having them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes doubtfully towards him, and then looked away as if\r\nafraid she might forgive him.\r\n\r\nBy every law of nature and sex a kiss was the only rejoinder that\r\nfitted the mood and the moment, under the suasion of which Sue\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nundemonstrative regard of him might not inconceivably have changed its\r\ntemperature. Some men would have cast scruples to the winds, and\r\nventured it, oblivious both of Sue\xe2\x80\x99s declaration of her neutral\r\nfeelings, and of the pair of autographs in the vestry chest of\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s parish church. Jude did not. He had, in fact, come in part\r\nto tell his own fatal story. It was upon his lips; yet at the hour of\r\nthis distress he could not disclose it. He preferred to dwell upon the\r\nrecognized barriers between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course\xe2\x80\x94I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94care about me in any particular way,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsorrowed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought not, and you are right. You belong to\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\r\nPhillotson. I suppose he has been to see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said shortly, her face changing a little. \xe2\x80\x9cThough I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nask him to come. You are glad, of course, that he has been! But I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come any more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was very perplexing to her lover that she should be piqued at his\r\nhonest acquiescence in his rival, if Jude\xe2\x80\x99s feelings of love were\r\ndeprecated by her. He went on to something else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will blow over, dear Sue,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe training-school\r\nauthorities are not all the world. You can get to be a student in some\r\nother, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Mr. Phillotson,\xe2\x80\x9d she said decisively.\r\n\r\nSue\xe2\x80\x99s kind hostess now returned from church, and there was no more\r\nintimate conversation. Jude left in the afternoon, hopelessly unhappy.\r\nBut he had seen her, and sat with her. Such intercourse as that would\r\nhave to content him for the remainder of his life. The lesson of\r\nrenunciation it was necessary and proper that he, as a parish priest,\r\nshould learn.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning when he awoke he felt rather vexed with her, and\r\ndecided that she was rather unreasonable, not to say capricious. Then,\r\nin illustration of what he had begun to discern as one of her redeeming\r\ncharacteristics there came promptly a note, which she must have written\r\nalmost immediately he had gone from her:\r\n\r\nForgive me for my petulance yesterday! I was horrid to you; I know it,\r\nand I feel perfectly miserable at my horridness. It was so dear of you\r\nnot to be angry! Jude, please still keep me as your friend and\r\nassociate, with all my faults. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try not to be like it again.\r\n    I am coming to Melchester on Saturday, to get my things away from\r\n    the T. S., &c. I could walk with you for half an hour, if you would\r\n    like?\xe2\x80\x94Your repentant\r\n\r\n\r\nSUE.\r\n\r\nJude forgave her straightway, and asked her to call for him at the\r\ncathedral works when she came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a middle-aged man was dreaming a dream of great beauty\r\nconcerning the writer of the above letter. He was Richard Phillotson,\r\nwho had recently removed from the mixed village school at Lumsdon near\r\nChristminster, to undertake a large boys\xe2\x80\x99 school in his native town of\r\nShaston, which stood on a hill sixty miles to the south-west as the\r\ncrow flies.\r\n\r\nA glance at the place and its accessories was almost enough to reveal\r\nthat the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s plans and dreams so long indulged in had been\r\nabandoned for some new dream with which neither the Church nor\r\nliterature had much in common. Essentially an unpractical man, he was\r\nnow bent on making and saving money for a practical purpose\xe2\x80\x94that of\r\nkeeping a wife, who, if she chose, might conduct one of the girls\xe2\x80\x99\r\nschools adjoining his own; for which purpose he had advised her to go\r\ninto training, since she would not marry him offhand.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Jude was removing from Marygreen to Melchester, and\r\nentering on adventures at the latter place with Sue, the schoolmaster\r\nwas settling down in the new school-house at Shaston. All the furniture\r\nbeing fixed, the books shelved, and the nails driven, he had begun to\r\nsit in his parlour during the dark winter nights and re-attempt some of\r\nhis old studies\xe2\x80\x94one branch of which had included Roman-Britannic\r\nantiquities\xe2\x80\x94an unremunerative labour for a national school-master but a\r\nsubject, that, after his abandonment of the university scheme, had\r\ninterested him as being a comparatively unworked mine; practicable to\r\nthose who, like himself, had lived in lonely spots where these remains\r\nwere abundant, and were seen to compel inferences in startling contrast\r\nto accepted views on the civilization of that time.\r\n\r\nA resumption of this investigation was the outward and apparent hobby\r\nof Phillotson at present\xe2\x80\x94his ostensible reason for going alone into\r\nfields where causeways, dykes, and tumuli abounded, or shutting himself\r\nup in his house with a few urns, tiles, and mosaics he had collected,\r\ninstead of calling round upon his new neighbours, who for their part\r\nhad showed themselves willing enough to be friendly with him. But it\r\nwas not the real, or the whole, reason, after all. Thus on a particular\r\nevening in the month, when it had grown quite late\xe2\x80\x94to near midnight,\r\nindeed\xe2\x80\x94and the light of his lamp, shining from his window at a salient\r\nangle of the hill-top town over infinite miles of valley westward,\r\nannounced as by words a place and person given over to study, he was\r\nnot exactly studying.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the room\xe2\x80\x94the books, the furniture, the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloose coat, his attitude at the table, even the flickering of the fire,\r\nbespoke the same dignified tale of undistracted research\xe2\x80\x94more than\r\ncreditable to a man who had had no advantages beyond those of his own\r\nmaking. And yet the tale, true enough till latterly, was not true now.\r\nWhat he was regarding was not history. They were historic notes,\r\nwritten in a bold womanly hand at his dictation some months before, and\r\nit was the clerical rendering of word after word that absorbed him.\r\n\r\nHe presently took from a drawer a carefully tied bundle of letters,\r\nfew, very few, as correspondence counts nowadays. Each was in its\r\nenvelope just as it had arrived, and the handwriting was of the same\r\nwomanly character as the historic notes. He unfolded them one by one\r\nand read them musingly. At first sight there seemed in these small\r\ndocuments to be absolutely nothing to muse over. They were\r\nstraightforward, frank letters, signed \xe2\x80\x9cSue B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d; just such ones as\r\nwould be written during short absences, with no other thought than\r\ntheir speedy destruction, and chiefly concerning books in reading and\r\nother experiences of a training school, forgotten doubtless by the\r\nwriter with the passing of the day of their inditing. In one of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94quite a recent note\xe2\x80\x94the young woman said that she had received his\r\nconsiderate letter, and that it was honourable and generous of him to\r\nsay he would not come to see her oftener than she desired (the school\r\nbeing such an awkward place for callers, and because of her strong wish\r\nthat her engagement to him should not be known, which it would\r\ninfallibly be if he visited her often). Over these phrases the\r\nschool-master pored. What precise shade of satisfaction was to be\r\ngathered from a woman\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude that the man who loved her had not\r\nbeen often to see her? The problem occupied him, distracted him.\r\n\r\nHe opened another drawer, and found therein an envelope, from which he\r\ndrew a photograph of Sue as a child, long before he had known her,\r\nstanding under trellis-work with a little basket in her hand. There was\r\nanother of her as a young woman, her dark eyes and hair making a very\r\ndistinct and attractive picture of her, which just disclosed, too, the\r\nthoughtfulness that lay behind her lighter moods. It was a duplicate of\r\nthe one she had given Jude, and would have given to any man. Phillotson\r\nbrought it half-way to his lips, but withdrew it in doubt at her\r\nperplexing phrases: ultimately kissing the dead pasteboard with all the\r\npassionateness, and more than all the devotion, of a young man of\r\neighteen.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s was an unhealthy-looking, old-fashioned face,\r\nrendered more old-fashioned by his style of shaving. A certain\r\ngentlemanliness had been imparted to it by nature, suggesting an\r\ninherent wish to do rightly by all. His speech was a little slow, but\r\nhis tones were sincere enough to make his hesitation no defect. His\r\ngreying hair was curly, and radiated from a point in the middle of his\r\ncrown. There were four lines across his forehead, and he only wore\r\nspectacles when reading at night. It was almost certainly a\r\nrenunciation forced upon him by his academic purpose, rather than a\r\ndistaste for women, which had hitherto kept him from closing with one\r\nof the sex in matrimony.\r\n\r\nSuch silent proceedings as those of this evening were repeated many and\r\noft times when he was not under the eye of the boys, whose quick and\r\npenetrating regard would frequently become almost intolerable to the\r\nself-conscious master in his present anxious care for Sue, making him,\r\nin the grey hours of morning, dread to meet anew the gimlet glances,\r\nlest they should read what the dream within him was.\r\n\r\nHe had honourably acquiesced in Sue\xe2\x80\x99s announced wish that he was not\r\noften to visit her at the training school; but at length, his patience\r\nbeing sorely tried, he set out one Saturday afternoon to pay her an\r\nunexpected call. There the news of her departure\xe2\x80\x94expulsion as it might\r\nalmost have been considered\xe2\x80\x94was flashed upon him without warning or\r\nmitigation as he stood at the door expecting in a few minutes to behold\r\nher face; and when he turned away he could hardly see the road before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSue had, in fact, never written a line to her suitor on the subject,\r\nalthough it was fourteen days old. A short reflection told him that\r\nthis proved nothing, a natural delicacy being as ample a reason for\r\nsilence as any degree of blameworthiness.\r\n\r\nThey had informed him at the school where she was living, and having no\r\nimmediate anxiety about her comfort, his thoughts took the direction of\r\na burning indignation against the training school committee. In his\r\nbewilderment Phillotson entered the adjacent cathedral, just now in a\r\ndirely dismantled state by reason of the repairs. He sat down on a\r\nblock of freestone, regardless of the dusty imprint it made on his\r\nbreeches; and his listless eyes following the movements of the workmen\r\nhe presently became aware that the reputed culprit, Sue\xe2\x80\x99s lover Jude,\r\nwas one amongst them.\r\n\r\nJude had never spoken to his former hero since the meeting by the model\r\nof Jerusalem. Having inadvertently witnessed Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s tentative\r\ncourtship of Sue in the lane there had grown up in the younger man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind a curious dislike to think of the elder, to meet him, to\r\ncommunicate in any way with him; and since Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s success in\r\nobtaining at least her promise had become known to Jude, he had frankly\r\nrecognized that he did not wish to see or hear of his senior any more,\r\nlearn anything of his pursuits, or even imagine again what excellencies\r\nmight appertain to his character. On this very day of the\r\nschoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s visit Jude was expecting Sue, as she had promised; and\r\nwhen therefore he saw the schoolmaster in the nave of the building,\r\nsaw, moreover, that he was coming to speak to him, he felt no little\r\nembarrassment; which Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s own embarrassment prevented his\r\nobserving.\r\n\r\nJude joined him, and they both withdrew from the other workmen to the\r\nspot where Phillotson had been sitting. Jude offered him a piece of\r\nsackcloth for a cushion, and told him it was dangerous to sit on the\r\nbare block.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson abstractedly, as he reseated himself, his\r\neyes resting on the ground as if he were trying to remember where he\r\nwas. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t keep you long. It was merely that I have heard that you\r\nhave seen my little friend Sue recently. It occurred to me to speak to\r\nyou on that account. I merely want to ask\xe2\x80\x94about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I know what!\xe2\x80\x9d Jude hurriedly said. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout her escaping from\r\nthe training school, and her coming to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Jude for a moment felt an unprincipled and fiendish wish to\r\nannihilate his rival at all cost. By the exercise of that treachery\r\nwhich love for the same woman renders possible to men the most\r\nhonourable in every other relation of life, he could send off\r\nPhillotson in agony and defeat by saying that the scandal was true, and\r\nthat Sue had irretrievably committed herself with him. But his action\r\ndid not respond for a moment to his animal instinct; and what he said\r\nwas, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of your kindness in coming to talk plainly to me about\r\nit. You know what they say?\xe2\x80\x94that I ought to marry her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wish with all my soul I could!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhillotson trembled, and his naturally pale face acquired a corpselike\r\nsharpness in its lines. \xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea that it was of this nature! God\r\nforbid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude aghast. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you understood? I mean that were\r\nI in a position to marry her, or someone, and settle down, instead of\r\nliving in lodgings here and there, I should be glad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat he had really meant was simply that he loved her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94since this painful matter has been opened up\xe2\x80\x94what really\r\nhappened?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Phillotson, with the firmness of a man who felt that a\r\nsharp smart now was better than a long agony of suspense hereafter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCases arise, and this is one, when even ungenerous questions must be\r\nput to make false assumptions impossible, and to kill scandal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude explained readily; giving the whole series of adventures,\r\nincluding the night at the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s, her wet arrival at his lodging,\r\nher indisposition from her immersion, their vigil of discussion, and\r\nhis seeing her off next morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson at the conclusion, \xe2\x80\x9cI take it as your final\r\nword, and I know I can believe you, that the suspicion which led to her\r\nrustication is an absolutely baseless one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely. So help me God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster rose. Each of the twain felt that the interview could\r\nnot comfortably merge in a friendly discussion of their recent\r\nexperiences, after the manner of friends; and when Jude had taken him\r\nround, and shown him some features of the renovation which the old\r\ncathedral was undergoing, Phillotson bade the young man good-day and\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nThis visit took place about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning; but no Sue\r\nappeared. When Jude went to his dinner at one he saw his beloved ahead\r\nof him in the street leading up from the North Gate, walking as if no\r\nway looking for him. Speedily overtaking her he remarked that he had\r\nasked her to come to him at the cathedral, and she had promised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been to get my things from the college,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nobservation which he was expected to take as an answer, though it was\r\nnot one. Finding her to be in this evasive mood he felt inclined to\r\ngive her the information so long withheld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not seen Mr. Phillotson to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d he ventured to inquire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not. But I am not going to be cross-examined about him; and if\r\nyou ask anything more I won\xe2\x80\x99t answer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very odd that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, regarding her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you are often not so nice in your real presence as you are in\r\nyour letters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it really seem so to you?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smiling with quick\r\ncuriosity. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s strange; but I feel just the same about you,\r\nJude. When you are gone away I seem such a coldhearted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she knew his sentiment towards her Jude saw that they were getting\r\nupon dangerous ground. It was now, he thought, that he must speak as an\r\nhonest man.\r\n\r\nBut he did not speak, and she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was that which made me\r\nwrite and say\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind your loving me\xe2\x80\x94if you wanted to, much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exultation he might have felt at what that implied, or seemed to\r\nimply, was nullified by his intention, and he rested rigid till he\r\nbegan: \xe2\x80\x9cI have never told you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes you have,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, I have never told you my history\xe2\x80\x94all of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I guess it. I know nearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude looked up. Could she possibly know of that morning performance of\r\nhis with Arabella; which in a few months had ceased to be a marriage\r\nmore completely than by death? He saw that she did not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t quite tell you here in the street,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with a gloomy\r\ntongue. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you had better not come to my lodgings. Let us go in\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe building by which they stood was the market-house; it was the only\r\nplace available; and they entered, the market being over, and the\r\nstalls and areas empty. He would have preferred a more congenial spot,\r\nbut, as usually happens, in place of a romantic field or solemn aisle\r\nfor his tale, it was told while they walked up and down over a floor\r\nlittered with rotten cabbage-leaves, and amid all the usual squalors of\r\ndecayed vegetable matter and unsaleable refuse. He began and finished\r\nhis brief narrative, which merely led up to the information that he had\r\nmarried a wife some years earlier, and that his wife was living still.\r\nAlmost before her countenance had time to change she hurried out the\r\nwords,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. It seemed so cruel to tell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo yourself, Jude. So it was better to be cruel to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear darling!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jude passionately. He tried to take her hand,\r\nbut she withdrew it. Their old relations of confidence seemed suddenly\r\nto have ended, and the antagonisms of sex to sex were left without any\r\ncounter-poising predilections. She was his comrade, friend, unconscious\r\nsweetheart no longer; and her eyes regarded him in estranged silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was ashamed of the episode in my life which brought about the\r\nmarriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t explain it precisely now. I could\r\nhave done it if you had taken it differently!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I?\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cHere I have been saying, or writing,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94that you might love me, or something of the sort!\xe2\x80\x94just out of\r\ncharity\xe2\x80\x94and all the time\xe2\x80\x94oh, it is perfectly damnable how things are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, stamping her foot in a nervous quiver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take me wrong, Sue! I never thought you cared for me at all, till\r\nquite lately; so I felt it did not matter! Do you care for me, Sue?\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nknow how I mean?\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t like \xe2\x80\x98out of charity\xe2\x80\x99 at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a question which in the circumstances Sue did not choose to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose she\xe2\x80\x94your wife\xe2\x80\x94is\xe2\x80\x94a very pretty woman, even if she\xe2\x80\x99s wicked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s pretty enough, as far as that goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrettier than I am, no doubt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not the least alike. And I have never seen her for years\xe2\x80\xa6 But\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s sure to come back\xe2\x80\x94they always do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange of you to stay apart from her like this!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue, her\r\ntrembling lip and lumpy throat belying her irony. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, such a\r\nreligious man. How will the demi-gods in your Pantheon\xe2\x80\x94I mean those\r\nlegendary persons you call saints\xe2\x80\x94intercede for you after this? Now if\r\nI had done such a thing it would have been different, and not\r\nremarkable, for I at least don\xe2\x80\x99t regard marriage as a sacrament. Your\r\ntheories are not so advanced as your practice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue, you are terribly cutting when you like to be\xe2\x80\x94a perfect Voltaire!\r\nBut you must treat me as you will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she saw how wretched he was she softened, and trying to blink away\r\nher sympathetic tears said with all the winning reproachfulness of a\r\nheart-hurt woman: \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94you should have told me before you gave me that\r\nidea that you wanted to be allowed to love me! I had no feeling before\r\nthat moment at the railway-station, except\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d For once Sue was as\r\nmiserable as he, in her attempts to keep herself free from emotion, and\r\nher less than half-success.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d he implored.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am\xe2\x80\x94not crying\xe2\x80\x94because I meant to\xe2\x80\x94love you; but because of your want\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94confidence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were quite screened from the market-square without, and he could\r\nnot help putting out his arm towards her waist. His momentary desire\r\nwas the means of her rallying. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, drawing back\r\nstringently, and wiping her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course not! It would be hypocrisy\r\nto pretend that it would be meant as from my cousin; and it can\xe2\x80\x99t be in\r\nany other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey moved on a dozen paces, and she showed herself recovered. It was\r\ndistracting to Jude, and his heart would have ached less had she\r\nappeared anyhow but as she did appear; essentially large-minded and\r\ngenerous on reflection, despite a previous exercise of those narrow\r\nwomanly humours on impulse that were necessary to give her sex.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you for what you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nshould I be so foolish? I do blame you a little bit for not telling me\r\nbefore. But, after all, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. We should have had to keep\r\napart, you see, even if this had not been in your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, Sue! This is the only obstacle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget that I must have loved you, and wanted to be your wife,\r\neven if there had been no obstacle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue, with a gentle\r\nseriousness which did not reveal her mind. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then we are cousins,\r\nand it is bad for cousins to marry. And\xe2\x80\x94I am engaged to somebody else.\r\nAs to our going on together as we were going, in a sort of friendly\r\nway, the people round us would have made it unable to continue. Their\r\nviews of the relations of man and woman are limited, as is proved by\r\ntheir expelling me from the school. Their philosophy only recognizes\r\nrelations based on animal desire. The wide field of strong attachment\r\nwhere desire plays, at least, only a secondary part, is ignored by\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94the part of\xe2\x80\x94who is it?\xe2\x80\x94Venus Urania.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer being able to talk learnedly showed that she was mistress of\r\nherself again; and before they parted she had almost regained her\r\nvivacious glance, her reciprocity of tone, her gay manner, and her\r\nsecond-thought attitude of critical largeness towards others of her age\r\nand sex.\r\n\r\nHe could speak more freely now. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were several reasons against my\r\ntelling you rashly. One was what I have said; another, that it was\r\nalways impressed upon me that I ought not to marry\xe2\x80\x94that I belonged to\r\nan odd and peculiar family\xe2\x80\x94the wrong breed for marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94who used to say that to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy great-aunt. She said it always ended badly with us Fawleys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s strange. My father used to say the same to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood possessed by the same thought, ugly enough, even as an\r\nassumption: that a union between them, had such been possible, would\r\nhave meant a terrible intensification of unfitness\xe2\x80\x94two bitters in one\r\ndish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but there can\xe2\x80\x99t be anything in it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with nervous\r\nlightness. \xe2\x80\x9cOur family have been unlucky of late years in choosing\r\nmates\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then they pretended to persuade themselves that all that had\r\nhappened was of no consequence, and that they could still be cousins\r\nand friends and warm correspondents, and have happy genial times when\r\nthey met, even if they met less frequently than before. Their parting\r\nwas in good friendship, and yet Jude\xe2\x80\x99s last look into her eyes was\r\ntinged with inquiry, for he felt that he did not even now quite know\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nTidings from Sue a day or two after passed across Jude like a withering\r\nblast.\r\n\r\nBefore reading the letter he was led to suspect that its contents were\r\nof a somewhat serious kind by catching sight of the signature\xe2\x80\x94which was\r\nin her full name, never used in her correspondence with him since her\r\nfirst note:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDE,\xe2\x80\x94I have something to tell you which perhaps you will not\r\nbe surprised to hear, though certainly it may strike you as being\r\naccelerated (as the railway companies say of their trains). Mr.\r\nPhillotson and I are to be married quite soon\xe2\x80\x94in three or four weeks.\r\nWe had intended, as you know, to wait till I had gone through my course\r\nof training and obtained my certificate, so as to assist him, if\r\nnecessary, in the teaching. But he generously says he does not see any\r\nobject in waiting, now I am not at the training school. It is so good\r\nof him, because the awkwardness of my situation has really come about\r\nby my fault in getting expelled.\r\n    Wish me joy. Remember I say you are to, and you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n    refuse!\xe2\x80\x94Your affectionate cousin,\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD.\r\n\r\nJude staggered under the news; could eat no breakfast; and kept on\r\ndrinking tea because his mouth was so dry. Then presently he went back\r\nto his work and laughed the usual bitter laugh of a man so confronted.\r\nEverything seemed turning to satire. And yet, what could the poor girl\r\ndo? he asked himself, and felt worse than shedding tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Susanna Florence Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he worked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nmarriage means!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCould it be possible that his announcement of his own marriage had\r\npricked her on to this, just as his visit to her when in liquor may\r\nhave pricked her on to her engagement? To be sure, there seemed to\r\nexist these other and sufficient reasons, practical and social, for her\r\ndecision; but Sue was not a very practical or calculating person; and\r\nhe was compelled to think that a pique at having his secret sprung upon\r\nher had moved her to give way to Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s probable representations,\r\nthat the best course to prove how unfounded were the suspicions of the\r\nschool authorities would be to marry him off-hand, as in fulfilment of\r\nan ordinary engagement. Sue had, in fact, been placed in an awkward\r\ncorner. Poor Sue!\r\n\r\nHe determined to play the Spartan; to make the best of it, and support\r\nher; but he could not write the requested good wishes for a day or two.\r\nMeanwhile there came another note from his impatient little dear:\r\n\r\nJude, will you give me away? I have nobody else who could do it so\r\nconveniently as you, being the only married relation I have here on the\r\nspot, even if my father were friendly enough to be willing, which he\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t. I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t think it a trouble? I have been looking at the\r\nmarriage service in the prayer-book, and it seems to me very\r\nhumiliating that a giver-away should be required at all. According to\r\nthe ceremony as there printed, my bridegroom chooses me of his own will\r\nand pleasure; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t choose him. Somebody _gives_ me to him, like\r\na she-ass or she-goat, or any other domestic animal. Bless your exalted\r\nviews of woman, O churchman! But I forget: I am no longer privileged to\r\ntease you.\xe2\x80\x94Ever,\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD.\r\n\r\nJude screwed himself up to heroic key; and replied:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SUE,\xe2\x80\x94Of course I wish you joy! And also of course I will give\r\nyou away. What I suggest is that, as you have no house of your own, you\r\ndo not marry from your school friend\xe2\x80\x99s, but from mine. It would be more\r\nproper, I think, since I am, as you say, the person nearest related to\r\nyou in this part of the world.\r\n    I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you sign your letter in such a new and terribly\r\n    formal way? Surely you care a bit about me still!\xe2\x80\x94Ever your\r\n    affectionate,\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDE.\r\n\r\nWhat had jarred on him even more than the signature was a little sting\r\nhe had been silent on\xe2\x80\x94the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmarried relation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94What an idiot it\r\nmade him seem as her lover! If Sue had written that in satire, he could\r\nhardly forgive her; if in suffering\xe2\x80\x94ah, that was another thing!\r\n\r\nHis offer of his lodging must have commended itself to Phillotson at\r\nany rate, for the schoolmaster sent him a line of warm thanks,\r\naccepting the convenience. Sue also thanked him. Jude immediately moved\r\ninto more commodious quarters, as much to escape the espionage of the\r\nsuspicious landlady who had been one cause of Sue\xe2\x80\x99s unpleasant\r\nexperience as for the sake of room.\r\n\r\nThen Sue wrote to tell him the day fixed for the wedding; and Jude\r\ndecided, after inquiry, that she should come into residence on the\r\nfollowing Saturday, which would allow of a ten days\xe2\x80\x99 stay in the city\r\nprior to the ceremony, sufficiently representing a nominal residence of\r\nfifteen.\r\n\r\nShe arrived by the ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock train on the day aforesaid, Jude not\r\ngoing to meet her at the station, by her special request, that he\r\nshould not lose a morning\xe2\x80\x99s work and pay, she said (if this were her\r\ntrue reason). But so well by this time did he know Sue that the\r\nremembrance of their mutual sensitiveness at emotional crises might, he\r\nthought, have weighed with her in this. When he came home to dinner she\r\nhad taken possession of her apartment.\r\n\r\nShe lived in the same house with him, but on a different floor, and\r\nthey saw each other little, an occasional supper being the only meal\r\nthey took together, when Sue\xe2\x80\x99s manner was something like that of a\r\nscared child. What she felt he did not know; their conversation was\r\nmechanical, though she did not look pale or ill. Phillotson came\r\nfrequently, but mostly when Jude was absent. On the morning of the\r\nwedding, when Jude had given himself a holiday, Sue and her cousin had\r\nbreakfast together for the first and last time during this curious\r\ninterval; in his room\xe2\x80\x94the parlour\xe2\x80\x94which he had hired for the period of\r\nSue\xe2\x80\x99s residence. Seeing, as women do, how helpless he was in making the\r\nplace comfortable, she bustled about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly.\r\n\r\nHe was leaning with his elbows on the table and his chin on his hands,\r\nlooking into a futurity which seemed to be sketched out on the\r\ntablecloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are \xe2\x80\x98father\xe2\x80\x99, you know. That\xe2\x80\x99s what they call the man who gives\r\nyou away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude could have said \xe2\x80\x9cPhillotson\xe2\x80\x99s age entitles him to be called that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut he would not annoy her by such a cheap retort.\r\n\r\nShe talked incessantly, as if she dreaded his indulgence in reflection,\r\nand before the meal was over both he and she wished they had not put\r\nsuch confidence in their new view of things, and had taken breakfast\r\napart. What oppressed Jude was the thought that, having done a wrong\r\nthing of this sort himself, he was aiding and abetting the woman he\r\nloved in doing a like wrong thing, instead of imploring and warning her\r\nagainst it. It was on his tongue to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have quite made up your\r\nmind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they went out on an errand together moved by a mutual\r\nthought that it was the last opportunity they would have of indulging\r\nin unceremonious companionship. By the irony of fate, and the curious\r\ntrick in Sue\xe2\x80\x99s nature of tempting Providence at critical times, she\r\ntook his arm as they walked through the muddy street\xe2\x80\x94a thing she had\r\nnever done before in her life\xe2\x80\x94and on turning the corner they found\r\nthemselves close to a grey perpendicular church with a low-pitched\r\nroof\xe2\x80\x94the church of St. Thomas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the church,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere I am going to be married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed with curiosity. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I should like to go in and\r\nsee what the spot is like where I am so soon to kneel and do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cShe does not realize what marriage means!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passively acquiesced in her wish to go in, and they entered by the\r\nwestern door. The only person inside the gloomy building was a\r\ncharwoman cleaning. Sue still held Jude\xe2\x80\x99s arm, almost as if she loved\r\nhim. Cruelly sweet, indeed, she had been to him that morning; but his\r\nthoughts of a penance in store for her were tempered by an ache:\r\n\r\n                                        \xe2\x80\xa6 I can find no way\r\nHow a blow should fall, such as falls on men,\r\nNor prove too much for your womanhood!\r\n\r\nThey strolled undemonstratively up the nave towards the altar railing,\r\nwhich they stood against in silence, turning then and walking down the\r\nnave again, her hand still on his arm, precisely like a couple just\r\nmarried. The too suggestive incident, entirely of her making, nearly\r\nbroke down Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to do things like this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in the delicate voice of an\r\nepicure in emotions, which left no doubt that she spoke the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you do!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are interesting, because they have probably never been done\r\nbefore. I shall walk down the church like this with my husband in about\r\ntwo hours, shan\xe2\x80\x99t I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt you will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it like this when you were married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, Sue\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be so awfully merciless! \xe2\x80\xa6 There, dear one, I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94you are vexed!\xe2\x80\x9d she said regretfully, as she blinked away an access\r\nof eye moisture. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I promised never to vex you! \xe2\x80\xa6 I suppose I ought\r\nnot to have asked you to bring me in here. Oh, I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t! I see it\r\nnow. My curiosity to hunt up a new sensation always leads me into these\r\nscrapes. Forgive me! \xe2\x80\xa6 You will, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe appeal was so remorseful that Jude\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were even wetter than\r\nhers as he pressed her hand for Yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll hurry away, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it any more!\xe2\x80\x9d she continued\r\nhumbly; and they came out of the building, Sue intending to go on to\r\nthe station to meet Phillotson. But the first person they encountered\r\non entering the main street was the schoolmaster himself, whose train\r\nhad arrived sooner than Sue expected. There was nothing really to demur\r\nto in her leaning on Jude\xe2\x80\x99s arm; but she withdrew her hand, and Jude\r\nthought that Phillotson had looked surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been doing such a funny thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smiling candidly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been to the church, rehearsing as it were. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t we, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson curiously.\r\n\r\nJude inwardly deplored what he thought to be unnecessary frankness; but\r\nshe had gone too far not to explain all, which she accordingly did,\r\ntelling him how they had marched up to the altar.\r\n\r\nSeeing how puzzled Phillotson seemed, Jude said as cheerfully as he\r\ncould, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to buy her another little present. Will you both\r\ncome to the shop with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go on to the house with him\xe2\x80\x9d; and requesting her\r\nlover not to be a long time she departed with the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nJude soon joined them at his rooms, and shortly after they prepared for\r\nthe ceremony. Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s hair was brushed to a painful extent, and\r\nhis shirt collar appeared stiffer than it had been for the previous\r\ntwenty years. Beyond this he looked dignified and thoughtful, and\r\naltogether a man of whom it was not unsafe to predict that he would\r\nmake a kind and considerate husband. That he adored Sue was obvious;\r\nand she could almost be seen to feel that she was undeserving his\r\nadoration.\r\n\r\nAlthough the distance was so short he had hired a fly from the Red\r\nLion, and six or seven women and children had gathered by the door when\r\nthey came out. The schoolmaster and Sue were unknown, though Jude was\r\ngetting to be recognized as a citizen; and the couple were judged to be\r\nsome relations of his from a distance, nobody supposing Sue to have\r\nbeen a recent pupil at the training school.\r\n\r\nIn the carriage Jude took from his pocket his extra little\r\nwedding-present, which turned out to be two or three yards of white\r\ntulle, which he threw over her bonnet and all, as a veil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks so odd over a bonnet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take the bonnet off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94let it stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson. And she obeyed.\r\n\r\nWhen they had passed up the church and were standing in their places\r\nJude found that the antecedent visit had certainly taken off the edge\r\nof this performance, but by the time they were half-way on with the\r\nservice he wished from his heart that he had not undertaken the\r\nbusiness of giving her away. How could Sue have had the temerity to ask\r\nhim to do it\xe2\x80\x94a cruelty possibly to herself as well as to him? Women\r\nwere different from men in such matters. Was it that they were, instead\r\nof more sensitive, as reputed, more callous, and less romantic; or were\r\nthey more heroic? Or was Sue simply so perverse that she wilfully gave\r\nherself and him pain for the odd and mournful luxury of practising\r\nlong-suffering in her own person, and of being touched with tender pity\r\nfor him at having made him practise it? He could perceive that her face\r\nwas nervously set, and when they reached the trying ordeal of Jude\r\ngiving her to Phillotson she could hardly command herself; rather,\r\nhowever, as it seemed, from her knowledge of what her cousin must feel,\r\nwhom she need not have had there at all, than from self-consideration.\r\nPossibly she would go on inflicting such pains again and again, and\r\ngrieving for the sufferer again and again, in all her colossal\r\ninconsistency.\r\n\r\nPhillotson seemed not to notice, to be surrounded by a mist which\r\nprevented his seeing the emotions of others. As soon as they had signed\r\ntheir names and come away, and the suspense was over, Jude felt\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nThe meal at his lodging was a very simple affair, and at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nthey went off. In crossing the pavement to the fly she looked back; and\r\nthere was a frightened light in her eyes. Could it be that Sue had\r\nacted with such unusual foolishness as to plunge into she knew not what\r\nfor the sake of asserting her independence of him, of retaliating on\r\nhim for his secrecy? Perhaps Sue was thus venturesome with men because\r\nshe was childishly ignorant of that side of their natures which wore\r\nout women\xe2\x80\x99s hearts and lives.\r\n\r\nWhen her foot was on the carriage-step she turned round, saying that\r\nshe had forgotten something. Jude and the landlady offered to get it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, running back. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my handkerchief. I know where I\r\nleft it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude followed her back. She had found it, and came holding it in her\r\nhand. She looked into his eyes with her own tearful ones, and her lips\r\nsuddenly parted as if she were going to avow something. But she went\r\non; and whatever she had meant to say remained unspoken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nJude wondered if she had really left her handkerchief behind; or\r\nwhether it were that she had miserably wished to tell him of a love\r\nthat at the last moment she could not bring herself to express.\r\n\r\nHe could not stay in his silent lodging when they were gone, and\r\nfearing that he might be tempted to drown his misery in alcohol he went\r\nupstairs, changed his dark clothes for his white, his thin boots for\r\nhis thick, and proceeded to his customary work for the afternoon.\r\n\r\nBut in the cathedral he seemed to hear a voice behind him, and to be\r\npossessed with an idea that she would come back. She could not possibly\r\ngo home with Phillotson, he fancied. The feeling grew and stirred. The\r\nmoment that the clock struck the last of his working hours he threw\r\ndown his tools and rushed homeward. \xe2\x80\x9cHas anybody been for me?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nNobody had been there.\r\n\r\nAs he could claim the downstairs sitting-room till twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock that\r\nnight he sat in it all the evening; and even when the clock had struck\r\neleven, and the family had retired, he could not shake off the feeling\r\nthat she would come back and sleep in the little room adjoining his own\r\nin which she had slept so many previous days. Her actions were always\r\nunpredictable: why should she not come? Gladly would he have compounded\r\nfor the denial of her as a sweetheart and wife by having her live thus\r\nas a fellow-lodger and friend, even on the most distant terms. His\r\nsupper still remained spread, and going to the front door, and softly\r\nsetting it open, he returned to the room and sat as watchers sit on\r\nOld-Midsummer eves, expecting the phantom of the Beloved. But she did\r\nnot come.\r\n\r\nHaving indulged in this wild hope he went upstairs, and looked out of\r\nthe window, and pictured her through the evening journey to London,\r\nwhither she and Phillotson had gone for their holiday; their rattling\r\nalong through the damp night to their hotel, under the same sky of\r\nribbed cloud as that he beheld, through which the moon showed its\r\nposition rather than its shape, and one or two of the larger stars made\r\nthemselves visible as faint nebul\xc3\xa6 only. It was a new beginning of\r\nSue\xe2\x80\x99s history. He projected his mind into the future, and saw her with\r\nchildren more or less in her own likeness around her. But the\r\nconsolation of regarding them as a continuation of her identity was\r\ndenied to him, as to all such dreamers, by the wilfulness of Nature in\r\nnot allowing issue from one parent alone. Every desired renewal of an\r\nexistence is debased by being half alloy. \xe2\x80\x9cIf at the estrangement or\r\ndeath of my lost love, I could go and see her child\xe2\x80\x94hers solely\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwould be comfort in it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. And then he again uneasily saw, as\r\nhe had latterly seen with more and more frequency, the scorn of Nature\r\nfor man\xe2\x80\x99s finer emotions, and her lack of interest in his aspirations.\r\n\r\nThe oppressive strength of his affection for Sue showed itself on the\r\nmorrow and following days yet more clearly. He could no longer endure\r\nthe light of the Melchester lamps; the sunshine was as drab paint, and\r\nthe blue sky as zinc. Then he received news that his old aunt was\r\ndangerously ill at Marygreen, which intelligence almost coincided with\r\na letter from his former employer at Christminster, who offered him\r\npermanent work of a good class if he would come back. The letters were\r\nalmost a relief to him. He started to visit Aunt Drusilla, and resolved\r\nto go onward to Christminster to see what worth there might be in the\r\nbuilder\xe2\x80\x99s offer.\r\n\r\nJude found his aunt even worse than the communication from the Widow\r\nEdlin had led him to expect. There was every possibility of her\r\nlingering on for weeks or months, though little likelihood. He wrote to\r\nSue informing her of the state of her aunt, and suggesting that she\r\nmight like to see her aged relative alive. He would meet her at\r\nAlfredston Road, the following evening, Monday, on his way back from\r\nChristminster, if she could come by the up-train which crossed his\r\ndown-train at that station. Next morning, according, he went on to\r\nChristminster, intending to return to Alfredston soon enough to keep\r\nthe suggested appointment with Sue.\r\n\r\nThe city of learning wore an estranged look, and he had lost all\r\nfeeling for its associations. Yet as the sun made vivid lights and\r\nshades of the mullioned architecture of the fa\xc3\xa7ades, and drew patterns\r\nof the crinkled battlements on the young turf of the quadrangles, Jude\r\nthought he had never seen the place look more beautiful. He came to the\r\nstreet in which he had first beheld Sue. The chair she had occupied\r\nwhen, leaning over her ecclesiastical scrolls, a hog-hair brush in her\r\nhand, her girlish figure had arrested the gaze of his inquiring eyes,\r\nstood precisely in its former spot, empty. It was as if she were dead,\r\nand nobody had been found capable of succeeding her in that artistic\r\npursuit. Hers was now the city phantom, while those of the intellectual\r\nand devotional worthies who had once moved him to emotion were no\r\nlonger able to assert their presence there.\r\n\r\nHowever, here he was; and in fulfilment of his intention he went on to\r\nhis former lodging in \xe2\x80\x9cBeersheba,\xe2\x80\x9d near the ritualistic church of St.\r\nSilas. The old landlady who opened the door seemed glad to see him\r\nagain, and bringing some lunch informed him that the builder who had\r\nemployed him had called to inquire his address.\r\n\r\nJude went on to the stone-yard where he had worked. But the old sheds\r\nand bankers were distasteful to him; he felt it impossible to engage\r\nhimself to return and stay in this place of vanished dreams. He longed\r\nfor the hour of the homeward train to Alfredston, where he might\r\nprobably meet Sue.\r\n\r\nThen, for one ghastly half-hour of depression caused by these scenes,\r\nthere returned upon him that feeling which had been his undoing more\r\nthan once\xe2\x80\x94that he was not worth the trouble of being taken care of\r\neither by himself or others; and during this half-hour he met Tinker\r\nTaylor, the bankrupt ecclesiastical ironmonger, at Fourways, who\r\nproposed that they should adjourn to a bar and drink together. They\r\nwalked along the street till they stood before one of the great\r\npalpitating centres of Christminster life, the inn wherein he formerly\r\nhad responded to the challenge to rehearse the Creed in Latin\xe2\x80\x94now a\r\npopular tavern with a spacious and inviting entrance, which gave\r\nadmittance to a bar that had been entirely renovated and refitted in\r\nmodern style since Jude\xe2\x80\x99s residence here.\r\n\r\nTinker Taylor drank off his glass and departed, saying it was too\r\nstylish a place now for him to feel at home in unless he was drunker\r\nthan he had money to be just then. Jude was longer finishing his, and\r\nstood abstractedly silent in the, for the minute, almost empty place.\r\nThe bar had been gutted and newly arranged throughout, mahogany\r\nfixtures having taken the place of the old painted ones, while at the\r\nback of the standing-space there were stuffed sofa-benches. The room\r\nwas divided into compartments in the approved manner, between which\r\nwere screens of ground glass in mahogany framing, to prevent topers in\r\none compartment being put to the blush by the recognitions of those in\r\nthe next. On the inside of the counter two barmaids leant over the\r\nwhite-handled beer-engines, and the row of little silvered taps inside,\r\ndripping into a pewter trough.\r\n\r\nFeeling tired, and having nothing more to do till the train left, Jude\r\nsat down on one of the sofas. At the back of the barmaids rose\r\nbevel-edged mirrors, with glass shelves running along their front, on\r\nwhich stood precious liquids that Jude did not know the name of, in\r\nbottles of topaz, sapphire, ruby and amethyst. The moment was enlivened\r\nby the entrance of some customers into the next compartment, and the\r\nstarting of the mechanical tell-tale of monies received, which emitted\r\na ting-ting every time a coin was put in.\r\n\r\nThe barmaid attending to this compartment was invisible to Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndirect glance, though a reflection of her back in the glass behind her\r\nwas occasionally caught by his eyes. He had only observed this\r\nlistlessly, when she turned her face for a moment to the glass to set\r\nher hair tidy. Then he was amazed to discover that the face was\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nIf she had come on to his compartment she would have seen him. But she\r\ndid not, this being presided over by the maiden on the other side. Abby\r\nwas in a black gown, with white linen cuffs and a broad white collar,\r\nand her figure, more developed than formerly, was accentuated by a\r\nbunch of daffodils that she wore on her left bosom. In the compartment\r\nshe served stood an electro-plated fountain of water over a\r\nspirit-lamp, whose blue flame sent a steam from the top, all this being\r\nvisible to him only in the mirror behind her; which also reflected the\r\nfaces of the men she was attending to\xe2\x80\x94one of them a handsome,\r\ndissipated young fellow, possibly an undergraduate, who had been\r\nrelating to her an experience of some humorous sort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Cockman, now! How can you tell such a tale to me in my\r\ninnocence!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Cockman, what do you use to make your\r\nmoustache curl so beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d As the young man was clean shaven, the\r\nretort provoked a laugh at his expense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have a cura\xc3\xa7ao; and a light, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe served the liqueur from one of the lovely bottles and striking a\r\nmatch held it to his cigarette with ministering archness while he\r\nwhiffed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a sound,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left him in Australia; and I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s there still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s eyes grew rounder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you part from him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you ask questions, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t hear lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome then, give me my change, which you\xe2\x80\x99ve been keeping from me for\r\nthe last quarter of an hour; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll romantically vanish up the street\r\nof this picturesque city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe handed the change over the counter, in taking which he caught her\r\nfingers and held them. There was a slight struggle and titter, and he\r\nbade her good-bye and left.\r\n\r\nJude had looked on with the eye of a dazed philosopher. It was\r\nextraordinary how far removed from his life Arabella now seemed to be.\r\nHe could not realize their nominal closeness. And, this being the case,\r\nin his present frame of mind he was indifferent to the fact that\r\nArabella was his wife indeed.\r\n\r\nThe compartment that she served emptied itself of visitors, and after a\r\nbrief thought he entered it, and went forward to the counter. Arabella\r\ndid not recognize him for a moment. Then their glances met. She\r\nstarted; till a humorous impudence sparkled in her eyes, and she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m blest! I thought you were underground years ago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard anything of you, or I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I should have come\r\nhere. But never mind! What shall I treat you to this afternoon? A\r\nScotch and soda? Come, anything that the house will afford, for old\r\nacquaintance\xe2\x80\x99 sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, Arabella,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude without a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nanything more than I\xe2\x80\x99ve had.\xe2\x80\x9d The fact was that her unexpected presence\r\nthere had destroyed at a stroke his momentary taste for strong liquor\r\nas completely as if it had whisked him back to his milk-fed infancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pity, now you could get it for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you been here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout six weeks. I returned from Sydney three months ago. I always\r\nliked this business, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder you came to this place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as I say, I thought you were gone to glory, and being in London\r\nI saw the situation in an advertisement. Nobody was likely to know me\r\nhere, even if I had minded, for I was never in Christminster in my\r\ngrowing up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you return from Australia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I had my reasons\xe2\x80\xa6 Then you are not a don yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even a reverend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor so much as a rather reverend dissenting gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am as I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue\xe2\x80\x94you look so.\xe2\x80\x9d She idly allowed her fingers to rest on the pull of\r\nthe beer-engine as she inspected him critically. He observed that her\r\nhands were smaller and whiter than when he had lived with her, and that\r\non the hand which pulled the engine she wore an ornamental ring set\r\nwith what seemed to be real sapphires\xe2\x80\x94which they were, indeed, and were\r\nmuch admired as such by the young men who frequented the bar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you pass as having a living husband,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I thought it might be awkward if I called myself a widow, as I\r\nshould have liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. I am known here a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean on that account\xe2\x80\x94for as I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect you. It\r\nwas for other reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to go into them,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied evasively. \xe2\x80\x9cI make a very\r\ngood living, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I want your company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere a chappie with no chin, and a moustache like a lady\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrow,\r\ncame and asked for a curiously compounded drink, and Arabella was\r\nobliged to go and attend to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t talk here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nstepping back a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you wait till nine? Say yes, and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe a fool. I can get off duty two hours sooner than usual, if I ask. I\r\nam not living in the house at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reflected and said gloomily, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come back. I suppose we\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\narrange something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, bother arranging! I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to arrange anything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must know a thing or two; and, as you say, we can\xe2\x80\x99t talk here.\r\nVery well; I\xe2\x80\x99ll call for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDepositing his unemptied glass he went out and walked up and down the\r\nstreet. Here was a rude flounce into the pellucid sentimentality of his\r\nsad attachment to Sue. Though Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s word was absolutely\r\nuntrustworthy, he thought there might be some truth in her implication\r\nthat she had not wished to disturb him, and had really supposed him\r\ndead. However, there was only one thing now to be done, and that was to\r\nplay a straightforward part, the law being the law, and the woman\r\nbetween whom and himself there was no more unity than between east and\r\nwest, being in the eye of the Church one person with him.\r\n\r\nHaving to meet Arabella here, it was impossible to meet Sue at\r\nAlfredston as he had promised. At every thought of this a pang had gone\r\nthrough him; but the conjuncture could not be helped. Arabella was\r\nperhaps an intended intervention to punish him for his unauthorized\r\nlove. Passing the evening, therefore, in a desultory waiting about the\r\ntown wherein he avoided the precincts of every cloister and hall,\r\nbecause he could not bear to behold them, he repaired to the tavern bar\r\nwhile the hundred and one strokes were resounding from the Great Bell\r\nof Cardinal College, a coincidence which seemed to him gratuitous\r\nirony. The inn was now brilliantly lighted up, and the scene was\r\naltogether more brisk and gay. The faces of the barmaidens had risen in\r\ncolour, each having a pink flush on her cheek; their manners were still\r\nmore vivacious than before\xe2\x80\x94more abandoned, more excited, more sensuous,\r\nand they expressed their sentiments and desires less euphemistically,\r\nlaughing in a lackadaisical tone, without reserve.\r\n\r\nThe bar had been crowded with men of all sorts during the previous\r\nhour, and he had heard from without the hubbub of their voices; but the\r\ncustomers were fewer at last. He nodded to Arabella, and told her that\r\nshe would find him outside the door when she came away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must have something with me first,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with great good\r\nhumour. \xe2\x80\x9cJust an early night-cap: I always do. Then you can go out and\r\nwait a minute, as it is best we should not be seen going together.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ndrew a couple of liqueur glasses of brandy; and though she had\r\nevidently, from her countenance, already taken in enough alcohol either\r\nby drinking or, more probably, from the atmosphere she had breathed for\r\nso many hours, she finished hers quickly. He also drank his, and went\r\noutside the house.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes she came, in a thick jacket and a hat with a black\r\nfeather. \xe2\x80\x9cI live quite near,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking his arm, \xe2\x80\x9cand can let\r\nmyself in by a latch-key at any time. What arrangement do you want to\r\ncome to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94none in particular,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, thoroughly sick and tired, his\r\nthoughts again reverting to Alfredston, and the train he did not go by;\r\nthe probable disappointment of Sue that he was not there when she\r\narrived, and the missed pleasure of her company on the long and lonely\r\nclimb by starlight up the hills to Marygreen. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have gone\r\nback really! My aunt is on her deathbed, I fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go over with you to-morrow morning. I think I could get a day\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something particularly uncongenial in the idea of Arabella,\r\nwho had no more sympathy than a tigress with his relations or him,\r\ncoming to the bedside of his dying aunt, and meeting Sue. Yet he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to, you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider\xe2\x80\xa6 Now, until we have come to some agreement\r\nit is awkward our being together here\xe2\x80\x94where you are known, and I am\r\ngetting known, though without any suspicion that I have anything to do\r\nwith you. As we are going towards the station, suppose we take the\r\nnine-forty train to Aldbrickham? We shall be there in little more than\r\nhalf an hour, and nobody will know us for one night, and we shall be\r\nquite free to act as we choose till we have made up our minds whether\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll make anything public or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen wait till I get two or three things. This is my lodging.\r\nSometimes when late I sleep at the hotel where I am engaged, so nobody\r\nwill think anything of my staying out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe speedily returned, and they went on to the railway, and made the\r\nhalf-hour\xe2\x80\x99s journey to Aldbrickham, where they entered a third-rate inn\r\nnear the station in time for a late supper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morrow between nine and half-past they were journeying back to\r\nChristminster, the only two occupants of a compartment in a third-class\r\nrailway-carriage. Having, like Jude, made rather a hasty toilet to\r\ncatch the train, Arabella looked a little frowsy, and her face was very\r\nfar from possessing the animation which had characterized it at the bar\r\nthe night before. When they came out of the station she found that she\r\nstill had half an hour to spare before she was due at the bar. They\r\nwalked in silence a little way out of the town in the direction of\r\nAlfredston. Jude looked up the far highway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh \xe2\x80\xa6 poor feeble me!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the very road by which I came into Christminster years ago\r\nfull of plans!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, whatever the road is I think my time is nearly up, as I have to\r\nbe in the bar by eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. And as I said, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t ask for the\r\nday to go with you to see your aunt. So perhaps we had better part\r\nhere. I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner not walk up Chief Street with you, since we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to\r\nno conclusion at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. But you said when we were getting up this morning that you\r\nhad something you wished to tell me before I left?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I had\xe2\x80\x94two things\xe2\x80\x94one in particular. But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t promise to\r\nkeep it a secret. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you now if you promise? As an honest woman\r\nI wish you to know it\xe2\x80\xa6 It was what I began telling you in the\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94about that gentleman who managed the Sydney hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d Arabella\r\nspoke somewhat hurriedly for her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it close?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94I promise!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nreveal your secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever I met him out for a walk, he used to say that he was much\r\ntaken with my looks, and he kept pressing me to marry him. I never\r\nthought of coming back to England again; and being out there in\r\nAustralia, with no home of my own after leaving my father, I at last\r\nagreed, and did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94marry him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegularly\xe2\x80\x94legally\xe2\x80\x94in church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And lived with him till shortly before I left. It was stupid, I\r\nknow; but I did! There, now I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t round upon me! He\r\ntalks of coming back to England, poor old chap. But if he does, he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be likely to find me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude stood pale and fixed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the devil didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me last, night!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6 Won\xe2\x80\x99t you make it up with me, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo in talking of \xe2\x80\x98your husband\xe2\x80\x99 to the bar gentlemen you meant him, of\r\ncourse\xe2\x80\x94not me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course\xe2\x80\xa6 Come, don\xe2\x80\x99t fuss about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing more to say!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing at all to\r\nsay about the\xe2\x80\x94crime\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve confessed to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrime! Pooh. They don\xe2\x80\x99t think much of such as that over there! Lots of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em do it\xe2\x80\xa6 Well, if you take it like that I shall go back to him! He\r\nwas very fond of me, and we lived honourable enough, and as respectable\r\nas any married couple in the colony! How did I know where you were?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go blaming you. I could say a good deal; but perhaps it would\r\nbe misplaced. What do you wish me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. There was one thing more I wanted to tell you; but I fancy\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen enough of one another for the present! I shall think over\r\nwhat you said about your circumstances, and let you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they parted. Jude watched her disappear in the direction of the\r\nhotel, and entered the railway station close by. Finding that it wanted\r\nthree-quarters of an hour of the time at which he could get a train\r\nback to Alfredston, he strolled mechanically into the city as far as to\r\nthe Fourways, where he stood as he had so often stood before, and\r\nsurveyed Chief Street stretching ahead, with its college after college,\r\nin picturesqueness unrivalled except by such Continental vistas as the\r\nStreet of Palaces in Genoa; the lines of the buildings being as\r\ndistinct in the morning air as in an architectural drawing. But Jude\r\nwas far from seeing or criticizing these things; they were hidden by an\r\nindescribable consciousness of Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s midnight contiguity, a sense\r\nof degradation at his revived experiences with her, of her appearance\r\nas she lay asleep at dawn, which set upon his motionless face a look as\r\nof one accurst. If he could only have felt resentment towards her he\r\nwould have been less unhappy; but he pitied while he contemned her.\r\n\r\nJude turned and retraced his steps. Drawing again towards the station\r\nhe started at hearing his name pronounced\xe2\x80\x94less at the name than at the\r\nvoice. To his great surprise no other than Sue stood like a vision\r\nbefore him\xe2\x80\x94her look bodeful and anxious as in a dream, her little mouth\r\nnervous, and her strained eyes speaking reproachful inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Jude\xe2\x80\x94I am so glad\xe2\x80\x94to meet you like this!\xe2\x80\x9d she said in quick,\r\nuneven accents not far from a sob. Then she flushed as she observed his\r\nthought that they had not met since her marriage.\r\n\r\nThey looked away from each other to hide their emotion, took each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s hand without further speech, and went on together awhile, till\r\nshe glanced at him with furtive solicitude. \xe2\x80\x9cI arrived at Alfredston\r\nstation last night, as you asked me to, and there was nobody to meet\r\nme! But I reached Marygreen alone, and they told me Aunt was a trifle\r\nbetter. I sat up with her, and as you did not come all night I was\r\nfrightened about you\xe2\x80\x94I thought that perhaps, when you found yourself\r\nback in the old city, you were upset at\xe2\x80\x94at thinking I was\xe2\x80\x94married, and\r\nnot there as I used to be; and that you had nobody to speak to; so you\r\nhad tried to drown your gloom\xe2\x80\x94as you did at that former time when you\r\nwere disappointed about entering as a student, and had forgotten your\r\npromise to me that you never would again. And this, I thought, was why\r\nyou hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to meet me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you came to hunt me up, and deliver me, like a good angel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I would come by the morning train and try to find you\xe2\x80\x94in\r\ncase\xe2\x80\x94in case\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did think of my promise to you, dear, continually! I shall never\r\nbreak out again as I did, I am sure. I may have been doing nothing\r\nbetter, but I was not doing that\xe2\x80\x94I loathe the thought of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad your staying had nothing to do with that. But,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nthe faintest pout entering into her tone, \xe2\x80\x9cyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back last\r\nnight and meet me, as you engaged to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I am sorry to say. I had an appointment at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94too\r\nlate for me to catch the train that would have met yours, or to get\r\nhome at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking at his loved one as she appeared to him now, in his tender\r\nthought the sweetest and most disinterested comrade that he had ever\r\nhad, living largely in vivid imaginings, so ethereal a creature that\r\nher spirit could be seen trembling through her limbs, he felt heartily\r\nashamed of his earthliness in spending the hours he had spent in\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s company. There was something rude and immoral in thrusting\r\nthese recent facts of his life upon the mind of one who, to him, was so\r\nuncarnate as to seem at times impossible as a human wife to any average\r\nman. And yet she was Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s. How she had become such, how she\r\nlived as such, passed his comprehension as he regarded her to-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll go back with me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a train just now. I wonder\r\nhow my aunt is by this time\xe2\x80\xa6 And so, Sue, you really came on my account\r\nall this way! At what an early time you must have started, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Sitting up watching alone made me all nerves for you, and instead\r\nof going to bed when it got light I started. And now you won\xe2\x80\x99t frighten\r\nme like this again about your morals for nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not so sure that she had been frightened about his morals for\r\nnothing. He released her hand till they had entered the train,\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nseemed the same carriage he had lately got out of with another\xe2\x80\x94where\r\nthey sat down side by side, Sue between him and the window. He regarded\r\nthe delicate lines of her profile, and the small, tight, applelike\r\nconvexities of her bodice, so different from Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s amplitudes.\r\nThough she knew he was looking at her she did not turn to him, but kept\r\nher eyes forward, as if afraid that by meeting his own some troublous\r\ndiscussion would be initiated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue\xe2\x80\x94you are married now, you know, like me; and yet we have been in\r\nsuch a hurry that we have not said a word about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d she quickly returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well\xe2\x80\x94perhaps not\xe2\x80\xa6 But I wish\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJude\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about _me_\xe2\x80\x94I wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she entreated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\ndistresses me, rather. Forgive my saying it! \xe2\x80\xa6 Where did you stay last\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had asked the question in perfect innocence, to change the topic.\r\nHe knew that, and said merely, \xe2\x80\x9cAt an inn,\xe2\x80\x9d though it would have been a\r\nrelief to tell her of his meeting with an unexpected one. But the\r\nlatter\xe2\x80\x99s final announcement of her marriage in Australia bewildered him\r\nlest what he might say should do his ignorant wife an injury.\r\n\r\nTheir talk proceeded but awkwardly till they reached Alfredston. That\r\nSue was not as she had been, but was labelled \xe2\x80\x9cPhillotson,\xe2\x80\x9d paralyzed\r\nJude whenever he wanted to commune with her as an individual. Yet she\r\nseemed unaltered\xe2\x80\x94he could not say why. There remained the five-mile\r\nextra journey into the country, which it was just as easy to walk as to\r\ndrive, the greater part of it being uphill. Jude had never before in\r\nhis life gone that road with Sue, though he had with another. It was\r\nnow as if he carried a bright light which temporarily banished the\r\nshady associations of the earlier time.\r\n\r\nSue talked; but Jude noticed that she still kept the conversation from\r\nherself. At length he inquired if her husband were well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is obliged to be in the school all the day, or\r\nhe would have come with me. He is so good and kind that to accompany me\r\nhe would have dismissed the school for once, even against his\r\nprinciples\xe2\x80\x94for he is strongly opposed to giving casual holidays\xe2\x80\x94only I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him. I felt it would be better to come alone. Aunt\r\nDrusilla, I knew, was so very eccentric; and his being almost a\r\nstranger to her now would have made it irksome to both. Since it turns\r\nout that she is hardly conscious I am glad I did not ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude had walked moodily while this praise of Phillotson was being\r\nexpressed. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Phillotson obliges you in everything, as he ought,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be a happy wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of course I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBride, I might almost have said, as yet. It is not so many weeks since\r\nI gave you to him, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know! I know!\xe2\x80\x9d There was something in her face which belied her\r\nlate assuring words, so strictly proper and so lifelessly spoken that\r\nthey might have been taken from a list of model speeches in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nGuide to Conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d Jude knew the quality of every vibration in Sue\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice, could read every symptom of her mental condition; and he was\r\nconvinced that she was unhappy, although she had not been a month\r\nmarried. But her rushing away thus from home, to see the last of a\r\nrelative whom she had hardly known in her life, proved nothing; for Sue\r\nnaturally did such things as those.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you have my good wishes now as always, Mrs. Phillotson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reproached him by a glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you are not Mrs. Phillotson,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are dear, free\r\nSue Bridehead, only you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it! Wifedom has not yet squashed up\r\nand digested you in its vast maw as an atom which has no further\r\nindividuality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue put on a look of being offended, till she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNor has\r\nhusbandom you, so far as I can see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it has!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shaking his head sadly.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the lone cottage under the firs, between the Brown\r\nHouse and Marygreen, in which Jude and Arabella had lived and\r\nquarrelled, he turned to look at it. A squalid family lived there now.\r\nHe could not help saying to Sue: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the house my wife and I\r\noccupied the whole of the time we lived together. I brought her home to\r\nthat house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat to you was what the school-house at Shaston is\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but I was not very happy there as you are in yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe closed her lips in retortive silence, and they walked some way till\r\nshe glanced at him to see how he was taking it. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I may have\r\nexaggerated your happiness\xe2\x80\x94one never knows,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued blandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think that, Jude, for a moment, even though you may have said it\r\nto sting me! He\xe2\x80\x99s as good to me as a man can be, and gives me perfect\r\nliberty\xe2\x80\x94which elderly husbands don\xe2\x80\x99t do in general\xe2\x80\xa6 If you think I am\r\nnot happy because he\xe2\x80\x99s too old for me, you are wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything against him\xe2\x80\x94to you dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you won\xe2\x80\x99t say things to distress me, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said no more, but he knew that, from some cause or other, in taking\r\nPhillotson as a husband, Sue felt that she had done what she ought not\r\nto have done.\r\n\r\nThey plunged into the concave field on the other side of which rose the\r\nvillage\xe2\x80\x94the field wherein Jude had received a thrashing from the farmer\r\nmany years earlier. On ascending to the village and approaching the\r\nhouse they found Mrs. Edlin standing at the door, who at sight of them\r\nlifted her hands deprecatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s downstairs, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the widow. \xe2\x80\x9cOut o\xe2\x80\x99 bed she got, and nothing could turn her.\r\nWhat will come o\xe2\x80\x99t I do not know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn entering, there indeed by the fireplace sat the old woman, wrapped\r\nin blankets, and turning upon them a countenance like that of\r\nSebastiano\xe2\x80\x99s Lazarus. They must have looked their amazement, for she\r\nsaid in a hollow voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94sceered ye, have I! I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to bide up there no longer, to\r\nplease nobody! \xe2\x80\x99Tis more than flesh and blood can bear, to be ordered\r\nto do this and that by a feller that don\xe2\x80\x99t know half as well as you do\r\nyourself! \xe2\x80\xa6 Ah\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll rue this marrying as well as he!\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nturning to Sue. \xe2\x80\x9cAll our family do\xe2\x80\x94and nearly all everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s. You\r\nshould have done as I did, you simpleton! And Phillotson the\r\nschoolmaster, of all men! What made \xe2\x80\x99ee marry him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes most women marry, Aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You mean to say you loved the man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t meant to say anything definite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo ye love un?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me, Aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can mind the man very well. A very civil, honourable liver; but\r\nLord!\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wownd your feelings, but\xe2\x80\x94there be certain men\r\nhere and there that no woman of any niceness can stomach. I should have\r\nsaid he was one. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say so _now_, since you must ha\xe2\x80\x99 known better\r\nthan I\xe2\x80\x94but that\xe2\x80\x99s what I _should_ have said!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue jumped up and went out. Jude followed her, and found her in the\r\nouthouse, crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude in distress. \xe2\x80\x9cShe means well, but is very\r\ncrusty and queer now, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue, trying to dry her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nher roughness one bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is that what she says is\xe2\x80\x94is true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t like him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that!\xe2\x80\x9d she said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cThat I ought\xe2\x80\x94perhaps I ought\r\nnot to have married!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wondered if she had really been going to say that at first. They\r\nwent back, and the subject was smoothed over, and her aunt took rather\r\nkindly to Sue, telling her that not many young women newly married\r\nwould have come so far to see a sick old crone like her. In the\r\nafternoon Sue prepared to depart, Jude hiring a neighbour to drive her\r\nto Alfredston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you to the station, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe would not let him. The man came round with the trap, and Jude\r\nhelped her into it, perhaps with unnecessary attention, for she looked\r\nat him prohibitively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\xe2\x80\x94I may come to see you some day, when I am back again at\r\nMelchester?\xe2\x80\x9d he half-crossly observed.\r\n\r\nShe bent down and said softly: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear\xe2\x80\x94you are not to come yet. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think you are in a good mood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d She waved her hand and was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s right! I won\xe2\x80\x99t go!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nHe passed the evening and following days in mortifying by every\r\npossible means his wish to see her, nearly starving himself in attempts\r\nto extinguish by fasting his passionate tendency to love her. He read\r\nsermons on discipline, and hunted up passages in Church history that\r\ntreated of the Ascetics of the second century. Before he had returned\r\nfrom Marygreen to Melchester there arrived a letter from Arabella. The\r\nsight of it revived a stronger feeling of self-condemnation for his\r\nbrief return to her society than for his attachment to Sue.\r\n\r\nThe letter, he perceived, bore a London postmark instead of the\r\nChristminster one. Arabella informed him that a few days after their\r\nparting in the morning at Christminster, she had been surprised by an\r\naffectionate letter from her Australian husband, formerly manager of\r\nthe hotel in Sydney. He had come to England on purpose to find her; and\r\nhad taken a free, fully-licensed public, in Lambeth, where he wished\r\nher to join him in conducting the business, which was likely to be a\r\nvery thriving one, the house being situated in an excellent, densely\r\npopulated, gin-drinking neighbourhood, and already doing a trade of\r\n\xc2\xa3200 a month, which could be easily doubled.\r\n\r\nAs he had said that he loved her very much still, and implored her to\r\ntell him where she was, and as they had only parted in a slight tiff,\r\nand as her engagement in Christminster was only temporary, she had just\r\ngone to join him as he urged. She could not help feeling that she\r\nbelonged to him more than to Jude, since she had properly married him,\r\nand had lived with him much longer than with her first husband. In thus\r\nwishing Jude good-bye she bore him no ill-will, and trusted he would\r\nnot turn upon her, a weak woman, and inform against her, and bring her\r\nto ruin now that she had a chance of improving her circumstances and\r\nleading a genteel life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nJude returned to Melchester, which had the questionable recommendation\r\nof being only a dozen and a half miles from his Sue\xe2\x80\x99s now permanent\r\nresidence. At first he felt that this nearness was a distinct reason\r\nfor not going southward at all; but Christminster was too sad a place\r\nto bear, while the proximity of Shaston to Melchester might afford him\r\nthe glory of worsting the Enemy in a close engagement, such as was\r\ndeliberately sought by the priests and virgins of the early Church,\r\nwho, disdaining an ignominious flight from temptation, became even\r\nchamber-partners with impunity. Jude did not pause to remember that, in\r\nthe laconic words of the historian, \xe2\x80\x9cinsulted Nature sometimes\r\nvindicated her rights\xe2\x80\x9d in such circumstances.\r\n\r\nHe now returned with feverish desperation to his study for the\r\npriesthood\xe2\x80\x94in the recognition that the single-mindedness of his aims,\r\nand his fidelity to the cause, had been more than questionable of late.\r\nHis passion for Sue troubled his soul; yet his lawful abandonment to\r\nthe society of Arabella for twelve hours seemed instinctively a worse\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94even though she had not told him of her Sydney husband till\r\nafterwards. He had, he verily believed, overcome all tendency to fly to\r\nliquor\xe2\x80\x94which, indeed, he had never done from taste, but merely as an\r\nescape from intolerable misery of mind. Yet he perceived with\r\ndespondency that, taken all round, he was a man of too many passions to\r\nmake a good clergyman; the utmost he could hope for was that in a life\r\nof constant internal warfare between flesh and spirit the former might\r\nnot always be victorious.\r\n\r\nAs a hobby, auxiliary to his readings in Divinity, he developed his\r\nslight skill in church-music and thorough-bass, till he could join in\r\npart-singing from notation with some accuracy. A mile or two from\r\nMelchester there was a restored village church, to which Jude had\r\noriginally gone to fix the new columns and capitals. By this means he\r\nhad become acquainted with the organist, and the ultimate result was\r\nthat he joined the choir as a bass voice.\r\n\r\nHe walked out to this parish twice every Sunday, and sometimes in the\r\nweek. One evening about Easter the choir met for practice, and a new\r\nhymn which Jude had heard of as being by a Wessex composer was to be\r\ntried and prepared for the following week. It turned out to be a\r\nstrangely emotional composition. As they all sang it over and over\r\nagain its harmonies grew upon Jude, and moved him exceedingly.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished he went round to the organist to make inquiries.\r\nThe score was in manuscript, the name of the composer being at the\r\nhead, together with the title of the hymn: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Foot of the Cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the organist. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a local man. He is a professional\r\nmusician at Kennetbridge\xe2\x80\x94between here and Christminster. The vicar\r\nknows him. He was brought up and educated in Christminster traditions,\r\nwhich accounts for the quality of the piece. I think he plays in the\r\nlarge church there, and has a surpliced choir. He comes to Melchester\r\nsometimes, and once tried to get the cathedral organ when the post was\r\nvacant. The hymn is getting about everywhere this Easter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he walked humming the air on his way home, Jude fell to musing on\r\nits composer, and the reasons why he composed it. What a man of\r\nsympathies he must be! Perplexed and harassed as he himself was about\r\nSue and Arabella, and troubled as was his conscience by the\r\ncomplication of his position, how he would like to know that man! \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nof all men would understand my difficulties,\xe2\x80\x9d said the impulsive Jude.\r\nIf there were any person in the world to choose as a confidant, this\r\ncomposer would be the one, for he must have suffered, and throbbed, and\r\nyearned.\r\n\r\nIn brief, ill as he could afford the time and money for the journey,\r\nFawley resolved, like the child that he was, to go to Kennetbridge the\r\nvery next Sunday. He duly started, early in the morning, for it was\r\nonly by a series of crooked railways that he could get to the town.\r\nAbout mid-day he reached it, and crossing the bridge into the quaint\r\nold borough he inquired for the house of the composer.\r\n\r\nThey told him it was a red brick building some little way further on.\r\nAlso that the gentleman himself had just passed along the street not\r\nfive minutes before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich way?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jude with alacrity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStraight along homeward from church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude hastened on, and soon had the pleasure of observing a man in a\r\nblack coat and a black slouched felt hat no considerable distance\r\nahead. Stretching out his legs yet more widely, he stalked after. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nhungry soul in pursuit of a full soul!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI must speak to that\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not, however, overtake the musician before he had entered his\r\nown house, and then arose the question if this were an expedient time\r\nto call. Whether or not he decided to do so there and then, now that he\r\nhad got here, the distance home being too great for him to wait till\r\nlate in the afternoon. This man of soul would understand scant\r\nceremony, and might be quite a perfect adviser in a case in which an\r\nearthly and illegitimate passion had cunningly obtained entrance into\r\nhis heart through the opening afforded for religion.\r\n\r\nJude accordingly rang the bell, and was admitted.\r\n\r\nThe musician came to him in a moment, and being respectably dressed,\r\ngood-looking, and frank in manner, Jude obtained a favourable\r\nreception. He was nevertheless conscious that there would be a certain\r\nawkwardness in explaining his errand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been singing in the choir of a little church near Melchester,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we have this week practised \xe2\x80\x98The Foot of the Cross,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhich I understand, sir, that you composed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did\xe2\x80\x94a year or so ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94like it. I think it supremely beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well\xe2\x80\x94other people have said so too. Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s money in it, if I\r\ncould only see about getting it published. I have other compositions to\r\ngo with it, too; I wish I could bring them out; for I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made a\r\nfive-pound note out of any of them yet. These publishing people\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nwant the copyright of an obscure composer\xe2\x80\x99s work, such as mine is, for\r\nalmost less than I should have to pay a person for making a fair\r\nmanuscript copy of the score. The one you speak of I have lent to\r\nvarious friends about here and Melchester, and so it has got to be sung\r\na little. But music is a poor staff to lean on\xe2\x80\x94I am giving it up\r\nentirely. You must go into trade if you want to make money nowadays.\r\nThe wine business is what I am thinking of. This is my forthcoming\r\nlist\xe2\x80\x94it is not issued yet\xe2\x80\x94but you can take one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed Jude an advertisement list of several pages in booklet shape,\r\nornamentally margined with a red line, in which were set forth the\r\nvarious clarets, champagnes, ports, sherries, and other wines with\r\nwhich he purposed to initiate his new venture. It took Jude more than\r\nby surprise that the man with the soul was thus and thus; and he felt\r\nthat he could not open up his confidences.\r\n\r\nThey talked a little longer, but constrainedly, for when the musician\r\nfound that Jude was a poor man his manner changed from what it had been\r\nwhile Jude\xe2\x80\x99s appearance and address deceived him as to his position and\r\npursuits. Jude stammered out something about his feelings in wishing to\r\ncongratulate the author on such an exalted composition, and took an\r\nembarrassed leave.\r\n\r\nAll the way home by the slow Sunday train, sitting in the fireless\r\nwaiting-rooms on this cold spring day, he was depressed enough at his\r\nsimplicity in taking such a journey. But no sooner did he reach his\r\nMelchester lodging than he found awaiting him a letter which had\r\narrived that morning a few minutes after he had left the house. It was\r\na contrite little note from Sue, in which she said, with sweet\r\nhumility, that she felt she had been horrid in telling him he was not\r\nto come to see her, that she despised herself for having been so\r\nconventional; and that he was to be sure to come by the\r\neleven-forty-five train that very Sunday, and have dinner with them at\r\nhalf-past one.\r\n\r\nJude almost tore his hair at having missed this letter till it was too\r\nlate to act upon its contents; but he had chastened himself\r\nconsiderably of late, and at last his chimerical expedition to\r\nKennetbridge really did seem to have been another special intervention\r\nof Providence to keep him away from temptation. But a growing\r\nimpatience of faith, which he had noticed in himself more than once of\r\nlate, made him pass over in ridicule the idea that God sent people on\r\nfools\xe2\x80\x99 errands. He longed to see her; he was angry at having missed\r\nher: and he wrote instantly, telling her what had happened, and saying\r\nhe had not enough patience to wait till the following Sunday, but would\r\ncome any day in the week that she liked to name.\r\n\r\nSince he wrote a little over-ardently, Sue, as her manner was, delayed\r\nher reply till Thursday before Good Friday, when she said he might come\r\nthat afternoon if he wished, this being the earliest day on which she\r\ncould welcome him, for she was now assistant-teacher in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nschool. Jude therefore got leave from the cathedral works at the\r\ntrifling expense of a stoppage of pay, and went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Fourth AT SHASTON\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cWhoso prefers either Matrimony or other Ordinance before the Good of\r\nMan and the plain Exigence of Charity, let him profess Papist, or\r\nProtestant, or what he will, he is no better than a Pharisee.\xe2\x80\x9d_\xe2\x80\x94J.\r\nMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nShaston, the ancient British Palladour,\r\n\r\nFrom whose foundation first such strange reports arise,\r\n\r\n(as Drayton sang it), was, and is, in itself the city of a dream. Vague\r\nimaginings of its castle, its three mints, its magnificent apsidal\r\nabbey, the chief glory of South Wessex, its twelve churches, its\r\nshrines, chantries, hospitals, its gabled freestone mansions\xe2\x80\x94all now\r\nruthlessly swept away\xe2\x80\x94throw the visitor, even against his will, into a\r\npensive melancholy, which the stimulating atmosphere and limitless\r\nlandscape around him can scarcely dispel. The spot was the burial-place\r\nof a king and a queen, of abbots and abbesses, saints and bishops,\r\nknights and squires. The bones of King Edward \xe2\x80\x9cthe Martyr,\xe2\x80\x9d carefully\r\nremoved hither for holy preservation, brought Shaston a renown which\r\nmade it the resort of pilgrims from every part of Europe, and enabled\r\nit to maintain a reputation extending far beyond English shores. To\r\nthis fair creation of the great Middle-Age the Dissolution was, as\r\nhistorians tell us, the death-knell. With the destruction of the\r\nenormous abbey the whole place collapsed in a general ruin: the\r\nMartyr\xe2\x80\x99s bones met with the fate of the sacred pile that held them, and\r\nnot a stone is now left to tell where they lie.\r\n\r\nThe natural picturesqueness and singularity of the town still remain;\r\nbut strange to say these qualities, which were noted by many writers in\r\nages when scenic beauty is said to have been unappreciated, are passed\r\nover in this, and one of the queerest and quaintest spots in England\r\nstands virtually unvisited to-day.\r\n\r\nIt has a unique position on the summit of a steep and imposing scarp,\r\nrising on the north, south, and west sides of the borough out of the\r\ndeep alluvial Vale of Blackmoor, the view from the Castle Green over\r\nthree counties of verdant pasture\xe2\x80\x94South, Mid, and Nether Wessex\xe2\x80\x94being\r\nas sudden a surprise to the unexpectant traveller\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as the\r\nmedicinal air is to his lungs. Impossible to a railway, it can best be\r\nreached on foot, next best by light vehicles; and it is hardly\r\naccessible to these but by a sort of isthmus on the north-east, that\r\nconnects it with the high chalk table-land on that side.\r\n\r\nSuch is, and such was, the now world-forgotten Shaston or Palladour.\r\nIts situation rendered water the great want of the town; and within\r\nliving memory, horses, donkeys and men may have been seen toiling up\r\nthe winding ways to the top of the height, laden with tubs and barrels\r\nfilled from the wells beneath the mountain, and hawkers retailing their\r\ncontents at the price of a halfpenny a bucketful.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty in the water supply, together with two other odd facts,\r\nnamely, that the chief graveyard slopes up as steeply as a roof behind\r\nthe church, and that in former times the town passed through a curious\r\nperiod of corruption, conventual and domestic, gave rise to the saying\r\nthat Shaston was remarkable for three consolations to man, such as the\r\nworld afforded not elsewhere. It was a place where the churchyard lay\r\nnearer heaven than the church steeple, where beer was more plentiful\r\nthan water, and where there were more wanton women than honest wives\r\nand maids. It is also said that after the Middle Ages the inhabitants\r\nwere too poor to pay their priests, and hence were compelled to pull\r\ndown their churches, and refrain altogether from the public worship of\r\nGod; a necessity which they bemoaned over their cups in the settles of\r\ntheir inns on Sunday afternoons. In those days the Shastonians were\r\napparently not without a sense of humour.\r\n\r\nThere was another peculiarity\xe2\x80\x94this a modern one\xe2\x80\x94which Shaston appeared\r\nto owe to its site. It was the resting-place and headquarters of the\r\nproprietors of wandering vans, shows, shooting-galleries, and other\r\nitinerant concerns, whose business lay largely at fairs and markets. As\r\nstrange wild birds are seen assembled on some lofty promontory,\r\nmeditatively pausing for longer flights, or to return by the course\r\nthey followed thither, so here, in this cliff-town, stood in stultified\r\nsilence the yellow and green caravans bearing names not local, as if\r\nsurprised by a change in the landscape so violent as to hinder their\r\nfurther progress; and here they usually remained all the winter till\r\nthey turned to seek again their old tracks in the following spring.\r\n\r\nIt was to this breezy and whimsical spot that Jude ascended from the\r\nnearest station for the first time in his life about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock one\r\nafternoon, and entering on the summit of the peak after a toilsome\r\nclimb, passed the first houses of the aerial town; and drew towards the\r\nschool-house. The hour was too early; the pupils were still in school,\r\nhumming small, like a swarm of gnats; and he withdrew a few steps along\r\nAbbey Walk, whence he regarded the spot which fate had made the home of\r\nall he loved best in the world. In front of the schools, which were\r\nextensive and stone-built, grew two enormous beeches with smooth\r\nmouse-coloured trunks, as such trees will only grow on chalk uplands.\r\nWithin the mullioned and transomed windows he could see the black,\r\nbrown, and flaxen crowns of the scholars over the sills, and to pass\r\nthe time away he walked down to the level terrace where the abbey\r\ngardens once had spread, his heart throbbing in spite of him.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to enter till the children were dismissed he remained here\r\ntill young voices could be heard in the open air, and girls in white\r\npinafores over red and blue frocks appeared dancing along the paths\r\nwhich the abbess, prioress, subprioress, and fifty nuns had demurely\r\npaced three centuries earlier. Retracing his steps he found that he had\r\nwaited too long, and that Sue had gone out into the town at the heels\r\nof the last scholar, Mr. Phillotson having been absent all the\r\nafternoon at a teachers\xe2\x80\x99 meeting at Shottsford.\r\n\r\nJude went into the empty schoolroom and sat down, the girl who was\r\nsweeping the floor having informed him that Mrs. Phillotson would be\r\nback again in a few minutes. A piano stood near\xe2\x80\x94actually the old piano\r\nthat Phillotson had possessed at Marygreen\xe2\x80\x94and though the dark\r\nafternoon almost prevented him seeing the notes Jude touched them in\r\nhis humble way, and could not help modulating into the hymn which had\r\nso affected him in the previous week.\r\n\r\nA figure moved behind him, and thinking it was still the girl with the\r\nbroom Jude took no notice, till the person came close and laid her\r\nfingers lightly upon his bass hand. The imposed hand was a little one\r\nhe seemed to know, and he turned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue. \xe2\x80\x9cI like it. I learnt it before I left\r\nMelchester. They used to play it in the training school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t strum before you! Play it for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue sat down, and her rendering of the piece, though not remarkable,\r\nseemed divine as compared with his own. She, like him, was evidently\r\ntouched\xe2\x80\x94to her own surprise\xe2\x80\x94by the recalled air; and when she had\r\nfinished, and he moved his hand towards hers, it met his own half-way.\r\nJude grasped it\xe2\x80\x94just as he had done before her marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is odd,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a voice quite changed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should care\r\nabout that air; because\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not that sort\xe2\x80\x94quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot easily moved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite mean that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but you _are_ one of that sort, for you are just like me at\r\nheart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not at head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe played on and suddenly turned round; and by an unpremeditated\r\ninstinct each clasped the other\xe2\x80\x99s hand again.\r\n\r\nShe uttered a forced little laugh as she relinquished his quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nfunny!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what we both did that for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose because we are both alike, as I said before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in our thoughts! Perhaps a little in our feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they rule thoughts\xe2\x80\xa6 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it enough to make one blaspheme that the\r\ncomposer of that hymn is one of the most commonplace men I ever met!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you goose\xe2\x80\x94to do just what I should have done! Why did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we are not alike,\xe2\x80\x9d he said drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we have it here instead of\r\nin my house? It is no trouble to get the kettle and things brought in.\r\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t live at the school you know, but in that ancient dwelling\r\nacross the way called Old-Grove Place. It is so antique and dismal that\r\nit depresses me dreadfully. Such houses are very well to visit, but not\r\nto live in\xe2\x80\x94I feel crushed into the earth by the weight of so many\r\nprevious lives there spent. In a new place like these schools there is\r\nonly your own life to support. Sit down, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Ada to bring the\r\ntea-things across.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited in the light of the stove, the door of which she flung open\r\nbefore going out, and when she returned, followed by the maiden with\r\ntea, they sat down by the same light, assisted by the blue rays of a\r\nspirit-lamp under the brass kettle on the stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of your wedding-presents to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, signifying the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\nThe kettle of his gift sang with some satire in its note, to his mind;\r\nand to change the subject he said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know of any good readable\r\nedition of the uncanonical books of the New Testament? You don\xe2\x80\x99t read\r\nthem in the school I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear no!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99twould alarm the neighbourhood\xe2\x80\xa6 Yes, there is one. I am\r\nnot familiar with it now, though I was interested in it when my former\r\nfriend was alive. Cowper\xe2\x80\x99s _Apocryphal Gospels_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds like what I want.\xe2\x80\x9d His thoughts, however reverted with a\r\ntwinge to the \xe2\x80\x9cformer friend\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94by whom she meant, as he knew, the\r\nuniversity comrade of her earlier days. He wondered if she talked of\r\nhim to Phillotson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gospel of Nicodemus is very nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on to keep him from\r\nhis jealous thoughts, which she read clearly, as she always did. Indeed\r\nwhen they talked on an indifferent subject, as now, there was ever a\r\nsecond silent conversation passing between their emotions, so perfect\r\nwas the reciprocity between them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite like the genuine\r\narticle. All cut up into verses, too; so that it is like one of the\r\nother evangelists read in a dream, when things are the same, yet not\r\nthe same. But, Jude, do you take an interest in those questions still?\r\nAre you getting up _Apologetica_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am reading Divinity harder than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe regarded him curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you look at me like that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94why do you want to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you can tell me anything I may be ignorant of in that\r\nsubject. You must have learnt a lot of everything from your dear dead\r\nfriend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t get on to that now!\xe2\x80\x9d she coaxed. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you be carving out at\r\nthat church again next week, where you learnt the pretty hymn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be very nice. Shall I come and see you there? It is in this\r\ndirection, and I could come any afternoon by train for half an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Don\xe2\x80\x99t come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94aren\xe2\x80\x99t we going to be friends, then, any longer, as we used to\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that. I thought you were always going to be kind to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done, then? I am sure I thought we two\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The _tremolo_ in\r\nher voice caused her to break off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue, I sometimes think you are a flirt,\xe2\x80\x9d said he abruptly.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause, till she suddenly jumped up; and to his\r\nsurprise he saw by the kettle-flame that her face was flushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to you any longer, Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, the tragic contralto\r\nnote having come back as of old. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is getting too dark to stay\r\ntogether like this, after playing morbid Good Friday tunes that make\r\none feel what one shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t! \xe2\x80\xa6 We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t sit and talk in this way any\r\nmore. Yes\xe2\x80\x94you must go away, for you mistake me! I am very much the\r\nreverse of what you say so cruelly\xe2\x80\x94Oh, Jude, it _was_ cruel to say\r\nthat! Yet I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you the truth\xe2\x80\x94I should shock you by letting you\r\nknow how I give way to my impulses, and how much I feel that I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been provided with attractiveness unless it were meant\r\nto be exercised! Some women\xe2\x80\x99s love of being loved is insatiable; and\r\nso, often, is their love of loving; and in the last case they may find\r\nthat they can\xe2\x80\x99t give it continuously to the chamber-officer appointed\r\nby the bishop\xe2\x80\x99s licence to receive it. But you are so straightforward,\r\nJude, that you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand me! \xe2\x80\xa6 Now you must go. I am sorry my\r\nhusband is not at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perceive I have said that in mere convention! Honestly I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nI am sorry. It does not matter, either way, sad to say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they had overdone the grasp of hands some time sooner, she touched\r\nhis fingers but lightly when he went out now. He had hardly gone from\r\nthe door when, with a dissatisfied look, she jumped on a form and\r\nopened the iron casement of a window beneath which he was passing in\r\nthe path without. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you leave here to catch your train, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked up in some surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cThe coach that runs to meet it goes in\r\nthree-quarters of an hour or so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do with yourself for the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94wander about, I suppose. Perhaps I shall go and sit in the old\r\nchurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does seem hard of me to pack you off so! You have thought enough of\r\nchurches, Heaven knows, without going into one in the dark. Stay\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you are. I can talk to you better like this than when you were\r\ninside\xe2\x80\xa6 It was so kind and tender of you to give up half a day\xe2\x80\x99s work\r\nto come to see me! \xe2\x80\xa6 You are Joseph the dreamer of dreams, dear Jude.\r\nAnd a tragic Don Quixote. And sometimes you are St. Stephen, who, while\r\nthey were stoning him, could see Heaven opened. Oh, my poor friend and\r\ncomrade, you\xe2\x80\x99ll suffer yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow that the high window-sill was between them, so that he could not\r\nget at her, she seemed not to mind indulging in a frankness she had\r\nfeared at close quarters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, still in the tone of one brimful\r\nof feeling, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the social moulds civilization fits us into have no\r\nmore relation to our actual shapes than the conventional shapes of the\r\nconstellations have to the real star-patterns. I am called Mrs. Richard\r\nPhillotson, living a calm wedded life with my counterpart of that name.\r\nBut I am not really Mrs. Richard Phillotson, but a woman tossed about,\r\nall alone, with aberrant passions, and unaccountable antipathies\xe2\x80\xa6 Now\r\nyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t wait longer, or you will lose the coach. Come and see me\r\nagain. You must come to the house then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow week. Good-bye\xe2\x80\x94good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d She stretched out her hand and\r\nstroked his forehead pitifully\xe2\x80\x94just once. Jude said good-bye, and went\r\naway into the darkness.\r\n\r\nPassing along Bimport Street he thought he heard the wheels of the\r\ncoach departing, and, truly enough, when he reached the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s Arms in\r\nthe Market Place the coach had gone. It was impossible for him to get\r\nto the station on foot in time for this train, and he settled himself\r\nperforce to wait for the next\xe2\x80\x94the last to Melchester that night.\r\n\r\nHe wandered about awhile, obtained something to eat; and then, having\r\nanother half-hour on his hands, his feet involuntarily took him through\r\nthe venerable graveyard of Trinity Church, with its avenues of limes,\r\nin the direction of the schools again. They were entirely in darkness.\r\nShe had said she lived over the way at Old-Grove Place, a house which\r\nhe soon discovered from her description of its antiquity.\r\n\r\nA glimmering candlelight shone from a front window, the shutters being\r\nyet unclosed. He could see the interior clearly\xe2\x80\x94the floor sinking a\r\ncouple of steps below the road without, which had become raised during\r\nthe centuries since the house was built. Sue, evidently just come in,\r\nwas standing with her hat on in this front parlour or sitting-room,\r\nwhose walls were lined with wainscoting of panelled oak reaching from\r\nfloor to ceiling, the latter being crossed by huge moulded beams only a\r\nlittle way above her head. The mantelpiece was of the same heavy\r\ndescription, carved with Jacobean pilasters and scroll-work. The\r\ncenturies did, indeed, ponderously overhang a young wife who passed her\r\ntime here.\r\n\r\nShe had opened a rosewood work-box, and was looking at a photograph.\r\nHaving contemplated it a little while she pressed it against her bosom,\r\nand put it again in its place.\r\n\r\nThen becoming aware that she had not obscured the windows she came\r\nforward to do so, candle in hand. It was too dark for her to see Jude\r\nwithout, but he could see her face distinctly, and there was an\r\nunmistakable tearfulness about the dark, long-lashed eyes.\r\n\r\nShe closed the shutters, and Jude turned away to pursue his solitary\r\njourney home. \xe2\x80\x9cWhose photograph was she looking at?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He had\r\nonce given her his; but she had others, he knew. Yet it was his,\r\nsurely?\r\n\r\nHe knew he should go to see her again, according to her invitation.\r\nThose earnest men he read of, the saints, whom Sue, with gentle\r\nirreverence, called his demi-gods, would have shunned such encounters\r\nif they doubted their own strength. But he could not. He might fast and\r\npray during the whole interval, but the human was more powerful in him\r\nthan the Divine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, if God disposed not, woman did. The next morning but one\r\nbrought him this note from her:\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t come next week. On your own account don\xe2\x80\x99t! We were too free,\r\nunder the influence of that morbid hymn and the twilight. Think no more\r\nthan you can help of\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSANNA FLORENCE MARY.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment was keen. He knew her mood, the look of her face,\r\nwhen she subscribed herself at length thus. But, whatever her mood, he\r\ncould not say she was wrong in her view. He replied:\r\n\r\nI acquiesce. You are right. It is a lesson in renunciation which I\r\nsuppose I ought to learn at this season.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDE.\r\n\r\nHe despatched the note on Easter Eve, and there seemed a finality in\r\ntheir decisions. But other forces and laws than theirs were in\r\noperation. On Easter Monday morning he received a message from the\r\nWidow Edlin, whom he had directed to telegraph if anything serious\r\nhappened:\r\n\r\nYour aunt is sinking. Come at once.\r\n\r\nHe threw down his tools and went. Three and a half hours later he was\r\ncrossing the downs about Marygreen, and presently plunged into the\r\nconcave field across which the short cut was made to the village. As he\r\nascended on the other side a labouring man, who had been watching his\r\napproach from a gate across the path, moved uneasily, and prepared to\r\nspeak. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see in his face that she is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Aunt\r\nDrusilla!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as he had supposed, and Mrs. Edlin had sent out the man to break\r\nthe news to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have knowed \xe2\x80\x99ee. She lay like a doll wi\xe2\x80\x99 glass eyes; so\r\nit didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that you wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nJude went on to the house, and in the afternoon, when everything was\r\ndone, and the layers-out had finished their beer, and gone, he sat down\r\nalone in the silent place. It was absolutely necessary to communicate\r\nwith Sue, though two or three days earlier they had agreed to mutual\r\nseverance. He wrote in the briefest terms:\r\n\r\nAunt Drusilla is dead, having been taken almost suddenly. The funeral\r\nis on Friday afternoon.\r\n\r\nHe remained in and about Marygreen through the intervening days, went\r\nout on Friday morning to see that the grave was finished, and wondered\r\nif Sue would come. She had not written, and that seemed to signify\r\nrather that she would come than that she would not. Having timed her by\r\nher only possible train, he locked the door about mid-day, and crossed\r\nthe hollow field to the verge of the upland by the Brown House, where\r\nhe stood and looked over the vast prospect northwards, and over the\r\nnearer landscape in which Alfredston stood. Two miles behind it a jet\r\nof white steam was travelling from the left to the right of the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nThere was a long time to wait, even now, till he would know if she had\r\narrived. He did wait, however, and at last a small hired vehicle pulled\r\nup at the bottom of the hill, and a person alighted, the conveyance\r\ngoing back, while the passenger began ascending the hill. He knew her;\r\nand she looked so slender to-day that it seemed as if she might be\r\ncrushed in the intensity of a too passionate embrace\xe2\x80\x94such as it was not\r\nfor him to give. Two-thirds of the way up her head suddenly took a\r\nsolicitous poise, and he knew that she had at that moment recognized\r\nhim. Her face soon began a pensive smile, which lasted till, having\r\ndescended a little way, he met her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought,\xe2\x80\x9d she began with nervous quickness, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it would be so sad\r\nto let you attend the funeral alone! And so\xe2\x80\x94at the last moment\xe2\x80\x94I came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear faithful Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Jude.\r\n\r\nWith the elusiveness of her curious double nature, however, Sue did not\r\nstand still for any further greeting, though it wanted some time to the\r\nburial. A pathos so unusually compounded as that which attached to this\r\nhour was unlikely to repeat itself for years, if ever, and Jude would\r\nhave paused, and meditated, and conversed. But Sue either saw it not at\r\nall, or, seeing it more than he, would not allow herself to feel it.\r\n\r\nThe sad and simple ceremony was soon over, their progress to the church\r\nbeing almost at a trot, the bustling undertaker having a more important\r\nfuneral an hour later, three miles off. Drusilla was put into the new\r\nground, quite away from her ancestors. Sue and Jude had gone side by\r\nside to the grave, and now sat down to tea in the familiar house; their\r\nlives united at least in this last attention to the dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was opposed to marriage, from first to last, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured\r\nSue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Particularly for members of our family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes met his, and remained on him awhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are rather a sad family, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said we made bad husbands and wives. Certainly we make unhappy\r\nones. At all events, I do, for one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue was silent. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it wrong, Jude,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a tentative tremor,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor a husband or wife to tell a third person that they are unhappy in\r\ntheir marriage? If a marriage ceremony is a religious thing, it is\r\npossibly wrong; but if it is only a sordid contract, based on material\r\nconvenience in householding, rating, and taxing, and the inheritance of\r\nland and money by children, making it necessary that the male parent\r\nshould be known\xe2\x80\x94which it seems to be\xe2\x80\x94why surely a person may say, even\r\nproclaim upon the housetops, that it hurts and grieves him or her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said so, anyhow, to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently she went on: \xe2\x80\x9cAre there many couples, do you think, where one\r\ndislikes the other for no definite fault?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose. If either cares for another person, for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut even apart from that? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the woman, for example, be very\r\nbad-natured if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to live with her husband; merely\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nvoice undulated, and he guessed things\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmerely because she had a\r\npersonal feeling against it\xe2\x80\x94a physical objection\xe2\x80\x94a fastidiousness, or\r\nwhatever it may be called\xe2\x80\x94although she might respect and be grateful to\r\nhim? I am merely putting a case. Ought she to try to overcome her\r\npruderies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude threw a troubled look at her. He said, looking away: \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be\r\njust one of those cases in which my experiences go contrary to my\r\ndogmas. Speaking as an order-loving man\xe2\x80\x94which I hope I am, though I\r\nfear I am not\xe2\x80\x94I should say, yes. Speaking from experience and unbiased\r\nnature, I should say, no. \xe2\x80\xa6 Sue, I believe you are not happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I am!\xe2\x80\x9d she contradicted. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can a woman be unhappy who has\r\nonly been married eight weeks to a man she chose freely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Chose freely!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you repeat it? \xe2\x80\xa6 But I have to go back by the six o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\ntrain. You will be staying on here, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a few days to wind up Aunt\xe2\x80\x99s affairs. This house is gone now.\r\nShall I go to the train with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little laugh of objection came from Sue. \xe2\x80\x9cI think not. You may come\r\npart of the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut stop\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t go to-night! That train won\xe2\x80\x99t take you to Shaston.\r\nYou must stay and go back to-morrow. Mrs. Edlin has plenty of room, if\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t like to stay here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said dubiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him I would come for\r\ncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude went to the widow\xe2\x80\x99s house adjoining, to let her know; and\r\nreturning in a few minutes sat down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is horrible how we are circumstanced, Sue\xe2\x80\x94horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nabruptly, with his eyes bent to the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you all my part of the gloom. Your part is that you ought\r\nnot to have married him. I saw it before you had done it, but I thought\r\nI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere. I was wrong. I ought to have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what makes you assume all this, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x94I can see you through your feathers, my poor little bird!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer hand lay on the table, and Jude put his upon it. Sue drew hers\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s absurd, Sue,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cafter what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about! I\r\nam more strict and formal than you, if it comes to that; and that you\r\nshould object to such an innocent action shows that you are\r\nridiculously inconsistent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it was too prudish,\xe2\x80\x9d she said repentantly. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I have\r\nfancied it was a sort of trick of ours\xe2\x80\x94too frequent perhaps. There, you\r\nmay hold it as much as you like. Is that good of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; very.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94of course, if you think it necessary. But as it means nothing it\r\nmay be bothering him needlessly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94are you sure you mean it only as my cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely sure. I have no feelings of love left in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s news. How has it come to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Arabella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe winced at the hit; then said curiously, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was at Christminster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she\xe2\x80\x99s come back; and you never told me! I suppose you will live\r\nwith her now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course\xe2\x80\x94just as you live with your husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at the window pots with the geraniums and cactuses, withered\r\nfor want of attention, and through them at the outer distance, till her\r\neyes began to grow moist. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, in a softened tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you be so glad to go back to her if\xe2\x80\x94if what you used to say\r\nto me is still true\xe2\x80\x94I mean if it were true then! Of course it is not\r\nnow! How could your heart go back to Arabella so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA special Providence, I suppose, helped it on its way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with gentle resentment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are teasing\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all\xe2\x80\x94because you think I am not happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were unhappy it would be my fault, my wickedness; not that I\r\nshould have a right to dislike him! He is considerate to me in\r\neverything; and he is very interesting, from the amount of general\r\nknowledge he has acquired by reading everything that comes in his way.\r\n\xe2\x80\xa6 Do you think, Jude, that a man ought to marry a woman his own age, or\r\none younger than himself\xe2\x80\x94eighteen years\xe2\x80\x94as I am than he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends upon what they feel for each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave her no opportunity of self-satisfaction, and she had to go on\r\nunaided, which she did in a vanquished tone, verging on tears:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I think I must be equally honest with you as you have been with me.\r\nPerhaps you have seen what it is I want to say?\xe2\x80\x94that though I like Mr.\r\nPhillotson as a friend, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like him\xe2\x80\x94it is a torture to me to\xe2\x80\x94live\r\nwith him as a husband!\xe2\x80\x94There, now I have let it out\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\r\nalthough I have been\xe2\x80\x94pretending I am happy.\xe2\x80\x94Now you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a contempt\r\nfor me for ever, I suppose!\xe2\x80\x9d She bent down her face upon her hands as\r\nthey lay upon the cloth, and silently sobbed in little jerks that made\r\nthe fragile three-legged table quiver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only been married a month or two!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, still remaining\r\nbent upon the table, and sobbing into her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is said that\r\nwhat a woman shrinks from\xe2\x80\x94in the early days of her marriage\xe2\x80\x94she shakes\r\ndown to with comfortable indifference in half a dozen years. But that\r\nis much like saying that the amputation of a limb is no affliction,\r\nsince a person gets comfortably accustomed to the use of a wooden leg\r\nor arm in the course of time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude could hardly speak, but he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought there was something\r\nwrong, Sue! Oh, I thought there was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not as you think!\xe2\x80\x94there is nothing wrong except my own\r\nwickedness, I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d call it\xe2\x80\x94a repugnance on my part, for a\r\nreason I cannot disclose, and what would not be admitted as one by the\r\nworld in general! \xe2\x80\xa6 What tortures me so much is the necessity of being\r\nresponsive to this man whenever he wishes, good as he is morally!\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndreadful contract to feel in a particular way in a matter whose essence\r\nis its voluntariness! \xe2\x80\xa6 I wish he would beat me, or be faithless to me,\r\nor do some open thing that I could talk about as a justification for\r\nfeeling as I do! But he does nothing, except that he has grown a little\r\ncold since he has found out how I feel. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to\r\nthe funeral\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, I am very miserable\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do! \xe2\x80\xa6 Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome near me, Jude, because you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he had jumped up and put his face against hers\xe2\x80\x94or rather against\r\nher ear, her face being inaccessible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you not to, Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you did\xe2\x80\x94I only wish to\xe2\x80\x94console you! It all arose through my\r\nbeing married before we met, didn\xe2\x80\x99t it? You would have been my wife,\r\nSue, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of replying she rose quickly, and saying she was going to walk\r\nto her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s grave in the churchyard to recover herself, went out of\r\nthe house. Jude did not follow her. Twenty minutes later he saw her\r\ncross the village green towards Mrs. Edlin\xe2\x80\x99s, and soon she sent a\r\nlittle girl to fetch her bag, and tell him she was too tired to see him\r\nagain that night.\r\n\r\nIn the lonely room of his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house, Jude sat watching the cottage\r\nof the Widow Edlin as it disappeared behind the night shade. He knew\r\nthat Sue was sitting within its walls equally lonely and disheartened;\r\nand again questioned his devotional motto that all was for the best.\r\n\r\nHe retired to rest early, but his sleep was fitful from the sense that\r\nSue was so near at hand. At some time near two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when he was\r\nbeginning to sleep more soundly, he was aroused by a shrill squeak that\r\nhad been familiar enough to him when he lived regularly at Marygreen.\r\nIt was the cry of a rabbit caught in a gin. As was the little\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x99s habit, it did not soon repeat its cry; and probably would\r\nnot do so more than once or twice; but would remain bearing its torture\r\ntill the morrow when the trapper would come and knock it on the head.\r\n\r\nHe who in his childhood had saved the lives of the earthworms now began\r\nto picture the agonies of the rabbit from its lacerated leg. If it were\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cbad catch\xe2\x80\x9d by the hind-leg, the animal would tug during the ensuing\r\nsix hours till the iron teeth of the trap had stripped the leg-bone of\r\nits flesh, when, should a weak-springed instrument enable it to escape,\r\nit would die in the fields from the mortification of the limb. If it\r\nwere a \xe2\x80\x9cgood catch,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, by the fore-leg, the bone would be broken\r\nand the limb nearly torn in two in attempts at an impossible escape.\r\n\r\nAlmost half an hour passed, and the rabbit repeated its cry. Jude could\r\nrest no longer till he had put it out of its pain, so dressing himself\r\nquickly he descended, and by the light of the moon went across the\r\ngreen in the direction of the sound. He reached the hedge bordering the\r\nwidow\xe2\x80\x99s garden, when he stood still. The faint click of the trap as\r\ndragged about by the writhing animal guided him now, and reaching the\r\nspot he struck the rabbit on the back of the neck with the side of his\r\npalm, and it stretched itself out dead.\r\n\r\nHe was turning away when he saw a woman looking out of the open\r\ncasement at a window on the ground floor of the adjacent cottage.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJude!\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice timidly\xe2\x80\x94Sue\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is you\xe2\x80\x94is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to sleep at all, and then I heard the rabbit, and\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking of what it suffered, till I felt I must come\r\ndown and kill it! But I am so glad you got there first\xe2\x80\xa6 They ought not\r\nto be allowed to set these steel traps, ought they!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude had reached the window, which was quite a low one, so that she was\r\nvisible down to her waist. She let go the casement-stay and put her\r\nhand upon his, her moonlit face regarding him wistfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid it keep you awake?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I was awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know\xe2\x80\x94now! I know you, with your religious doctrines, think\r\nthat a married woman in trouble of a kind like mine commits a mortal\r\nsin in making a man the confidant of it, as I did you. I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t wish it, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat may have _been_ my view; but my\r\ndoctrines and I begin to part company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it\xe2\x80\x94I knew it! And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I vowed I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t disturb your\r\nbelief. But\xe2\x80\x94I am _so glad_ to see you!\xe2\x80\x94and, oh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to see\r\nyou again, now the last tie between us, Aunt Drusilla, is dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude seized her hand and kissed it. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a stronger one left!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never care about my doctrines or my religion any more! Let\r\nthem go! Let me help you, even if I do love you, and even if you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say it!\xe2\x80\x94I know what you mean; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t admit so much as that.\r\nThere! Guess what you like, but don\xe2\x80\x99t press me to answer questions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you were happy, whatever I may be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ be! So few could enter into my feeling\xe2\x80\x94they would say \xe2\x80\x99twas\r\nmy fanciful fastidiousness, or something of that sort, and condemn me\xe2\x80\xa6\r\nIt is none of the natural tragedies of love that\xe2\x80\x99s love\xe2\x80\x99s usual tragedy\r\nin civilized life, but a tragedy artificially manufactured for people\r\nwho in a natural state would find relief in parting! \xe2\x80\xa6 It would have\r\nbeen wrong, perhaps, for me to tell my distress to you, if I had been\r\nable to tell it to anybody else. But I have nobody. And I _must_ tell\r\nsomebody! Jude, before I married him I had never thought out fully what\r\nmarriage meant, even though I knew. It was idiotic of me\xe2\x80\x94there is no\r\nexcuse. I was old enough, and I thought I was very experienced. So I\r\nrushed on, when I had got into that training school scrape, with all\r\nthe cock-sureness of the fool that I was! \xe2\x80\xa6 I am certain one ought to\r\nbe allowed to undo what one had done so ignorantly! I daresay it\r\nhappens to lots of women, only they submit, and I kick\xe2\x80\xa6 When people of\r\na later age look back upon the barbarous customs and superstitions of\r\nthe times that we have the unhappiness to live in, what _will_ they\r\nsay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very bitter, darling Sue! How I wish\xe2\x80\x94I wish\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must go in now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment of impulse she bent over the sill, and laid her face upon\r\nhis hair, weeping, and then imprinting a scarcely perceptible little\r\nkiss upon the top of his head, withdrawing quickly, so that he could\r\nnot put his arms round her, as otherwise he unquestionably would have\r\ndone. She shut the casement, and he returned to his cottage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSue\xe2\x80\x99s distressful confession recurred to Jude\xe2\x80\x99s mind all the night as\r\nbeing a sorrow indeed.\r\n\r\nThe morning after, when it was time for her to go, the neighbours saw\r\nher companion and herself disappearing on foot down the hill path which\r\nled into the lonely road to Alfredston. An hour passed before he\r\nreturned along the same route, and in his face there was a look of\r\nexaltation not unmixed with recklessness. An incident had occurred.\r\n\r\nThey had stood parting in the silent highway, and their tense and\r\npassionate moods had led to bewildered inquiries of each other on how\r\nfar their intimacy ought to go; till they had almost quarrelled, and\r\nshe said tearfully that it was hardly proper of him as a parson in\r\nembryo to think of such a thing as kissing her even in farewell as he\r\nnow wished to do. Then she had conceded that the fact of the kiss would\r\nbe nothing: all would depend upon the spirit of it. If given in the\r\nspirit of a cousin and a friend she saw no objection: if in the spirit\r\nof a lover she could not permit it. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you swear that it will not be\r\nin that spirit?\xe2\x80\x9d she had said.\r\n\r\nNo: he would not. And then they had turned from each other in\r\nestrangement, and gone their several ways, till at a distance of twenty\r\nor thirty yards both had looked round simultaneously. That look behind\r\nwas fatal to the reserve hitherto more or less maintained. They had\r\nquickly run back, and met, and embracing most unpremeditatedly, kissed\r\nclose and long. When they parted for good it was with flushed cheeks on\r\nher side, and a beating heart on his.\r\n\r\nThe kiss was a turning-point in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s career. Back again in the\r\ncottage, and left to reflection, he saw one thing: that though his kiss\r\nof that aerial being had seemed the purest moment of his faultful life,\r\nas long as he nourished this unlicensed tenderness it was glaringly\r\ninconsistent for him to pursue the idea of becoming the soldier and\r\nservant of a religion in which sexual love was regarded as at its best\r\na frailty, and at its worst damnation. What Sue had said in warmth was\r\nreally the cold truth. When to defend his affection tooth and nail, to\r\npersist with headlong force in impassioned attentions to her, was all\r\nhe thought of, he was condemned _ipso facto_ as a professor of the\r\naccepted school of morals. He was as unfit, obviously, by nature, as he\r\nhad been by social position, to fill the part of a propounder of\r\naccredited dogma.\r\n\r\nStrange that his first aspiration\xe2\x80\x94towards academical proficiency\xe2\x80\x94had\r\nbeen checked by a woman, and that his second aspiration\xe2\x80\x94towards\r\napostleship\xe2\x80\x94had also been checked by a woman. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthe women are to blame; or is it the artificial system of things, under\r\nwhich the normal sex-impulses are turned into devilish domestic gins\r\nand springs to noose and hold back those who want to progress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had been his standing desire to become a prophet, however humble, to\r\nhis struggling fellow-creatures, without any thought of personal gain.\r\nYet with a wife living away from him with another husband, and himself\r\nin love erratically, the loved one\xe2\x80\x99s revolt against her state being\r\npossibly on his account, he had sunk to be barely respectable according\r\nto regulation views.\r\n\r\nIt was not for him to consider further: he had only to confront the\r\nobvious, which was that he had made himself quite an impostor as a\r\nlaw-abiding religious teacher.\r\n\r\nAt dusk that evening he went into the garden and dug a shallow hole, to\r\nwhich he brought out all the theological and ethical works that he\r\npossessed, and had stored here. He knew that, in this country of true\r\nbelievers, most of them were not saleable at a much higher price than\r\nwaste-paper value, and preferred to get rid of them in his own way,\r\neven if he should sacrifice a little money to the sentiment of thus\r\ndestroying them. Lighting some loose pamphlets to begin with, he cut\r\nthe volumes into pieces as well as he could, and with a three-pronged\r\nfork shook them over the flames. They kindled, and lighted up the back\r\nof the house, the pigsty, and his own face, till they were more or less\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\nThough he was almost a stranger here now, passing cottagers talked to\r\nhim over the garden hedge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurning up your awld aunt\xe2\x80\x99s rubbidge, I suppose? Ay; a lot gets heaped\r\nup in nooks and corners when you\xe2\x80\x99ve lived eighty years in one house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning before the leaves, covers, and\r\nbinding of Jeremy Taylor, Butler, Doddridge, Paley, Pusey, Newman and\r\nthe rest had gone to ashes, but the night was quiet, and as he turned\r\nand turned the paper shreds with the fork, the sense of being no longer\r\na hypocrite to himself afforded his mind a relief which gave him calm.\r\nHe might go on believing as before, but he professed nothing, and no\r\nlonger owned and exhibited engines of faith which, as their proprietor,\r\nhe might naturally be supposed to exercise on himself first of all. In\r\nhis passion for Sue he could not stand as an ordinary sinner, and not\r\nas a whited sepulchre.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sue, after parting from him earlier in the day, had gone\r\nalong to the station, with tears in her eyes for having run back and\r\nlet him kiss her. Jude ought not to have pretended that he was not a\r\nlover, and made her give way to an impulse to act unconventionally, if\r\nnot wrongly. She was inclined to call it the latter; for Sue\xe2\x80\x99s logic\r\nwas extraordinarily compounded, and seemed to maintain that before a\r\nthing was done it might be right to do, but that being done it became\r\nwrong; or, in other words, that things which were right in theory were\r\nwrong in practice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been too weak, I think!\xe2\x80\x9d she jerked out as she pranced on,\r\nshaking down tear-drops now and then. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was burning, like a\r\nlover\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94oh, it was! And I won\xe2\x80\x99t write to him any more, or at least for\r\na long time, to impress him with my dignity! And I hope it will hurt\r\nhim very much\xe2\x80\x94expecting a letter to-morrow morning, and the next, and\r\nthe next, and no letter coming. He\xe2\x80\x99ll suffer then with suspense\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe, that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x94and I am very glad of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Tears of pity for Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napproaching sufferings at her hands mingled with those which had surged\r\nup in pity for herself.\r\n\r\nThen the slim little wife of a husband whose person was disagreeable to\r\nher, the ethereal, fine-nerved, sensitive girl, quite unfitted by\r\ntemperament and instinct to fulfil the conditions of the matrimonial\r\nrelation with Phillotson, possibly with scarce any man, walked fitfully\r\nalong, and panted, and brought weariness into her eyes by gazing and\r\nworrying hopelessly.\r\n\r\nPhillotson met her at the arrival station, and, seeing that she was\r\ntroubled, thought it must be owing to the depressing effect of her\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s death and funeral. He began telling her of his day\xe2\x80\x99s doings, and\r\nhow his friend Gillingham, a neighbouring schoolmaster whom he had not\r\nseen for years, had called upon him. While ascending to the town,\r\nseated on the top of the omnibus beside him, she said suddenly and with\r\nan air of self-chastisement, regarding the white road and its bordering\r\nbushes of hazel:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichard\xe2\x80\x94I let Mr. Fawley hold my hand a long while. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhether you think it wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe, waking apparently from thoughts of far different mould, said\r\nvaguely, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, did you? What did you do that for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He wanted to, and I let him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it pleased him. I should think it was hardly a novelty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey lapsed into silence. Had this been a case in the court of an\r\nomniscient judge, he might have entered on his notes the curious fact\r\nthat Sue had placed the minor for the major indiscretion, and had not\r\nsaid a word about the kiss.\r\n\r\nAfter tea that evening Phillotson sat balancing the school registers.\r\nShe remained in an unusually silent, tense, and restless condition, and\r\nat last, saying she was tired, went to bed early. When Phillotson\r\narrived upstairs, weary with the drudgery of the attendance-numbers, it\r\nwas a quarter to twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Entering their chamber, which by day\r\ncommanded a view of some thirty or forty miles over the Vale of\r\nBlackmoor, and even into Outer Wessex, he went to the window, and,\r\npressing his face against the pane, gazed with hard-breathing fixity\r\ninto the mysterious darkness which now covered the far-reaching scene.\r\nHe was musing, \xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, without turning his head,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I must get the committee to change the school-stationer. All the\r\ncopybooks are sent wrong this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no reply. Thinking Sue was dozing he went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there must be a rearrangement of that ventilator in the\r\nclass-room. The wind blows down upon my head unmercifully and gives me\r\nthe ear-ache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the silence seemed more absolute than ordinarily he turned round.\r\nThe heavy, gloomy oak wainscot, which extended over the walls upstairs\r\nand down in the dilapidated \xe2\x80\x9cOld-Grove Place,\xe2\x80\x9d and the massive\r\nchimney-piece reaching to the ceiling, stood in odd contrast to the new\r\nand shining brass bedstead, and the new suite of birch furniture that\r\nhe had bought for her, the two styles seeming to nod to each other\r\nacross three centuries upon the shaking floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said (this being the way in which he pronounced her name).\r\n\r\nShe was not in the bed, though she had apparently been there\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nclothes on her side being flung back. Thinking she might have forgotten\r\nsome kitchen detail and gone downstairs for a moment to see to it, he\r\npulled off his coat and idled quietly enough for a few minutes, when,\r\nfinding she did not come, he went out upon the landing, candle in hand,\r\nand said again \xe2\x80\x9cSoo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d came back to him in her voice, from the distant kitchen quarter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing down there at midnight\xe2\x80\x94tiring yourself out for\r\nnothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sleepy; I am reading; and there is a larger fire here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to bed. Some time in the night he awoke. She was not there,\r\neven now. Lighting a candle he hastily stepped out upon the landing,\r\nand again called her name.\r\n\r\nShe answered \xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d as before, but the tones were small and confined,\r\nand whence they came he could not at first understand. Under the\r\nstaircase was a large clothes-closet, without a window; they seemed to\r\ncome from it. The door was shut, but there was no lock or other\r\nfastening. Phillotson, alarmed, went towards it, wondering if she had\r\nsuddenly become deranged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing in there?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to disturb you I came here, as it was so late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no bed, is there? And no ventilation! Why, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nsuffocated if you stay all night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I think not. Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Phillotson seized the knob and pulled at the door. She had\r\nfastened it inside with a piece of string, which broke at his pull.\r\nThere being no bedstead she had flung down some rugs and made a little\r\nnest for herself in the very cramped quarters the closet afforded.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked in upon her she sprang out of her lair, great-eyed and\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought not to have pulled open the door!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis not becoming in you! Oh, will you go away; please will you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked so pitiful and pleading in her white nightgown against the\r\nshadowy lumber-hole that he was quite worried. She continued to beseech\r\nhim not to disturb her.\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been kind to you, and given you every liberty; and it is\r\nmonstrous that you should feel in this way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, weeping. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that! It is wrong and wicked of me, I\r\nsuppose! I am very sorry. But it is not I altogether that am to blame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is then? Am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know! The universe, I suppose\xe2\x80\x94things in general, because\r\nthey are so horrid and cruel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is no use talking like that. Making a man\xe2\x80\x99s house so unseemly\r\nat this time o\xe2\x80\x99 night! Eliza will hear if we don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d (He meant the\r\nservant.) \xe2\x80\x9cJust think if either of the parsons in this town was to see\r\nus now! I hate such eccentricities, Sue. There\xe2\x80\x99s no order or regularity\r\nin your sentiments! \xe2\x80\xa6 But I won\xe2\x80\x99t intrude on you further; only I would\r\nadvise you not to shut the door too tight, or I shall find you stifled\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn rising the next morning he immediately looked into the closet, but\r\nSue had already gone downstairs. There was a little nest where she had\r\nlain, and spiders\xe2\x80\x99 webs hung overhead. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must a woman\xe2\x80\x99s aversion be\r\nwhen it is stronger than her fear of spiders!\xe2\x80\x9d he said bitterly.\r\n\r\nHe found her sitting at the breakfast-table, and the meal began almost\r\nin silence, the burghers walking past upon the pavement\xe2\x80\x94or rather\r\nroadway, pavements being scarce here\xe2\x80\x94which was two or three feet above\r\nthe level of the parlour floor. They nodded down to the happy couple\r\ntheir morning greetings, as they went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichard,\xe2\x80\x9d she said all at once; \xe2\x80\x9cwould you mind my living away from\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway from me? Why, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you were doing when I married you. What\r\nthen was the meaning of marrying at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like me any the better for telling you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t object to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I thought I could do nothing else. You had got my promise a\r\nlong time before that, remember. Then, as time went on, I regretted I\r\nhad promised you, and was trying to see an honourable way to break it\r\noff. But as I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I became rather reckless and careless about the\r\nconventions. Then you know what scandals were spread, and how I was\r\nturned out of the training school you had taken such time and trouble\r\nto prepare me for and get me into; and this frightened me and it seemed\r\nthen that the one thing I could do would be to let the engagement\r\nstand. Of course I, of all people, ought not to have cared what was\r\nsaid, for it was just what I fancied I never did care for. But I was a\r\ncoward\xe2\x80\x94as so many women are\xe2\x80\x94and my theoretic unconventionality broke\r\ndown. If that had not entered into the case it would have been better\r\nto have hurt your feelings once for all then, than to marry you and\r\nhurt them all my life after\xe2\x80\xa6 And you were so generous in never giving\r\ncredit for a moment to the rumour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am bound in honesty to tell you that I weighed its probability and\r\ninquired of your cousin about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with pained surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you inquired!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took his word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes had filled. \xe2\x80\x9c_He_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have inquired!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t answered me. Will you let me go away? I know how irregular it\r\nis of me to ask it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is irregular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do ask it! Domestic laws should be made according to\r\ntemperaments, which should be classified. If people are at all peculiar\r\nin character they have to suffer from the very rules that produce\r\ncomfort in others! \xe2\x80\xa6 Will you let me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we married\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the use of thinking of laws and ordinances,\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif they make you miserable when you know you are committing no sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are committing a sin in not liking me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _do_ like you! But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect it would be\xe2\x80\x94that it would be so\r\nmuch more than that\xe2\x80\xa6 For a man and woman to live on intimate terms when\r\none feels as I do is adultery, in any circumstances, however legal.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it! \xe2\x80\xa6 Will you let me, Richard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou distress me, Susanna, by such importunity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t we agree to free each other? We made the compact, and surely\r\nwe can cancel it\xe2\x80\x94not legally of course; but we can morally, especially\r\nas no new interests, in the shape of children, have arisen to be looked\r\nafter. Then we might be friends, and meet without pain to either. Oh\r\nRichard, be my friend and have pity! We shall both be dead in a few\r\nyears, and then what will it matter to anybody that you relieved me\r\nfrom constraint for a little while? I daresay you think me eccentric,\r\nor super-sensitive, or something absurd. Well\xe2\x80\x94why should I suffer for\r\nwhat I was born to be, if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt other people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it does\xe2\x80\x94it hurts _me_! And you vowed to love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s it! I am in the wrong. I always am! It is as culpable to\r\nbind yourself to love always as to believe a creed always, and as silly\r\nas to vow always to like a particular food or drink!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you mean, by living away from me, living by yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you insisted, yes. But I meant living with Jude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhillotson writhed.\r\n\r\nSue continued: \xe2\x80\x9cShe, or he, \xe2\x80\x98who lets the world, or his own portion of\r\nit, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other faculty\r\nthan the apelike one of imitation.\xe2\x80\x99 J. S. Mill\xe2\x80\x99s words, those are. I\r\nhave been reading it up. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you act upon them? I wish to,\r\nalways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care about J. S. Mill!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned he. \xe2\x80\x9cI only want to lead a\r\nquiet life! Do you mind my saying that I have guessed what never once\r\noccurred to me before our marriage\xe2\x80\x94that you were in love, and are in\r\nlove, with Jude Fawley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may go on guessing that I am, since you have begun. But do you\r\nsuppose that if I had been I should have asked you to let me go and\r\nlive with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ringing of the school bell saved Phillotson from the necessity of\r\nreplying at present to what apparently did not strike him as being such\r\na convincing _argumentum ad verecundiam_ as she, in her loss of courage\r\nat the last moment, meant it to appear. She was beginning to be so\r\npuzzling and unstateable that he was ready to throw in with her other\r\nlittle peculiarities the extremest request which a wife could make.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded to the schools that morning as usual, Sue entering the\r\nclass-room, where he could see the back of her head through the glass\r\npartition whenever he turned his eyes that way. As he went on giving\r\nand hearing lessons his forehead and eyebrows twitched from\r\nconcentrated agitation of thought, till at length he tore a scrap from\r\na sheet of scribbling paper and wrote:\r\n\r\nYour request prevents my attending to work at all. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\r\nam doing! Was it seriously made?\r\n\r\nHe folded the piece of paper very small, and gave it to a little boy to\r\ntake to Sue. The child toddled off into the class-room. Phillotson saw\r\nhis wife turn and take the note, and the bend of her pretty head as she\r\nread it, her lips slightly crisped, to prevent undue expression under\r\nfire of so many young eyes. He could not see her hands, but she changed\r\nher position, and soon the child returned, bringing nothing in reply.\r\nIn a few minutes, however, one of Sue\xe2\x80\x99s class appeared, with a little\r\nnote similar to his own. These words only were pencilled therein:\r\n\r\nI am sincerely sorry to say that it was seriously made.\r\n\r\nPhillotson looked more disturbed than before, and the meeting-place of\r\nhis brows twitched again. In ten minutes he called up the child he had\r\njust sent to her, and dispatched another missive:\r\n\r\nGod knows I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to thwart you in any reasonable way. My whole\r\nthought is to make you comfortable and happy. But I cannot agree to\r\nsuch a preposterous notion as your going to live with your lover. You\r\nwould lose everybody\xe2\x80\x99s respect and regard; and so should I!\r\n\r\nAfter an interval a similar part was enacted in the class-room, and an\r\nanswer came:\r\n\r\nI know you mean my good. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be respectable! To produce\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuman development in its richest diversity\xe2\x80\x9d (to quote your Humboldt)\r\nis to my mind far above respectability. No doubt my tastes are low\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nyour view\xe2\x80\x94hopelessly low! If you won\xe2\x80\x99t let me go to him, will you grant\r\nme this one request\xe2\x80\x94allow me to live in your house in a separate way?\r\n\r\nTo this he returned no answer.\r\n\r\nShe wrote again:\r\n\r\nI know what you think. But cannot you have pity on me? I beg you to; I\r\nimplore you to be merciful! I would not ask if I were not almost\r\ncompelled by what I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear! No poor woman has ever wished more than\r\nI that Eve had not fallen, so that (as the primitive Christians\r\nbelieved) some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled Paradise.\r\nBut I won\xe2\x80\x99t trifle! Be kind to me\xe2\x80\x94even though I have not been kind to\r\nyou! I will go away, go abroad, anywhere, and never trouble you.\r\n\r\nNearly an hour passed, and then he returned an answer:\r\n\r\nI do not wish to pain you. How well you _know_ I don\xe2\x80\x99t! Give me a\r\nlittle time. I am disposed to agree to your last request.\r\n\r\nOne line from her:\r\n\r\nThank you from my heart, Richard. I do not deserve your kindness.\r\n\r\nAll day Phillotson bent a dazed regard upon her through the glazed\r\npartition; and he felt as lonely as when he had not known her.\r\n\r\nBut he was as good as his word, and consented to her living apart in\r\nthe house. At first, when they met at meals, she had seemed more\r\ncomposed under the new arrangement; but the irksomeness of their\r\nposition worked on her temperament, and the fibres of her nature seemed\r\nstrained like harp-strings. She talked vaguely and indiscriminately to\r\nprevent his talking pertinently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nPhillotson was sitting up late, as was often his custom, trying to get\r\ntogether the materials for his long-neglected hobby of Roman\r\nantiquities. For the first time since reviving the subject he felt a\r\nreturn of his old interest in it. He forgot time and place, and when he\r\nremembered himself and ascended to rest it was nearly two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nHis preoccupation was such that, though he now slept on the other side\r\nof the house, he mechanically went to the room that he and his wife had\r\noccupied when he first became a tenant of Old-Grove Place, which since\r\nhis differences with Sue had been hers exclusively. He entered, and\r\nunconsciously began to undress.\r\n\r\nThere was a cry from the bed, and a quick movement. Before the\r\nschoolmaster had realized where he was he perceived Sue starting up\r\nhalf-awake, staring wildly, and springing out upon the floor on the\r\nside away from him, which was towards the window. This was somewhat\r\nhidden by the canopy of the bedstead, and in a moment he heard her\r\nflinging up the sash. Before he had thought that she meant to do more\r\nthan get air she had mounted upon the sill and leapt out. She\r\ndisappeared in the darkness, and he heard her fall below.\r\n\r\nPhillotson, horrified, ran downstairs, striking himself sharply against\r\nthe newel in his haste. Opening the heavy door he ascended the two or\r\nthree steps to the level of the ground, and there on the gravel before\r\nhim lay a white heap. Phillotson seized it in his arms, and bringing\r\nSue into the hall seated her on a chair, where he gazed at her by the\r\nflapping light of the candle which he had set down in the draught on\r\nthe bottom stair.\r\n\r\nShe had certainly not broken her neck. She looked at him with eyes that\r\nseemed not to take him in; and though not particularly large in general\r\nthey appeared so now. She pressed her side and rubbed her arm, as if\r\nconscious of pain; then stood up, averting her face, in evident\r\ndistress at his gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God\xe2\x80\x94you are not killed! Though it\xe2\x80\x99s not for want of trying\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nmuch hurt I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer fall, in fact, had not been a serious one, probably owing to the\r\nlowness of the old rooms and to the high level of the ground without.\r\nBeyond a scraped elbow and a blow in the side she had apparently\r\nincurred little harm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was asleep, I think!\xe2\x80\x9d she began, her pale face still turned away\r\nfrom him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd something frightened me\xe2\x80\x94a terrible dream\xe2\x80\x94I thought I saw\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The actual circumstances seemed to come back to her, and she was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nHer cloak was hanging at the back of the door, and the wretched\r\nPhillotson flung it round her. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I help you upstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\ndrearily; for the significance of all this sickened him of himself and\r\nof everything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thank you, Richard. I am very little hurt. I can walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to lock your door,\xe2\x80\x9d he mechanically said, as if lecturing in\r\nschool. \xe2\x80\x9cThen no one could intrude even by accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have tried\xe2\x80\x94it won\xe2\x80\x99t lock. All the doors are out of order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe aspect of things was not improved by her admission. She ascended\r\nthe staircase slowly, the waving light of the candle shining on her.\r\nPhillotson did not approach her, or attempt to ascend himself till he\r\nheard her enter her room. Then he fastened up the front door, and\r\nreturning, sat down on the lower stairs, holding the newel with one\r\nhand, and bowing his face into the other. Thus he remained for a long\r\nlong time\xe2\x80\x94a pitiable object enough to one who had seen him; till,\r\nraising his head and sighing a sigh which seemed to say that the\r\nbusiness of his life must be carried on, whether he had a wife or no,\r\nhe took the candle and went upstairs to his lonely room on the other\r\nside of the landing.\r\n\r\nNo further incident touching the matter between them occurred till the\r\nfollowing evening, when, immediately school was over, Phillotson walked\r\nout of Shaston, saying he required no tea, and not informing Sue where\r\nhe was going. He descended from the town level by a steep road in a\r\nnorth-westerly direction, and continued to move downwards till the soil\r\nchanged from its white dryness to a tough brown clay. He was now on the\r\nlow alluvial beds\r\n\r\nWhere Duncliffe is the traveller\xe2\x80\x99s mark,\r\nAnd cloty Stour\xe2\x80\x99s a-rolling dark.\r\n\r\nMore than once he looked back in the increasing obscurity of evening.\r\nAgainst the sky was Shaston, dimly visible\r\n\r\nOn the grey-topp\xe2\x80\x99d height\r\nOf Paladore, as pale day wore\r\nAway\xe2\x80\xa6[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] William Barnes.\r\n\r\nThe new-lit lights from its windows burnt with a steady shine as if\r\nwatching him, one of which windows was his own. Above it he could just\r\ndiscern the pinnacled tower of Trinity Church. The air down here,\r\ntempered by the thick damp bed of tenacious clay, was not as it had\r\nbeen above, but soft and relaxing, so that when he had walked a mile or\r\ntwo he was obliged to wipe his face with his handkerchief.\r\n\r\nLeaving Duncliffe Hill on the left he proceeded without hesitation\r\nthrough the shade, as a man goes on, night or day, in a district over\r\nwhich he has played as a boy. He had walked altogether about four and a\r\nhalf miles\r\n\r\nWhere Stour receives her strength,\r\nFrom six cleere fountains fed,[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] Drayton.\r\n\r\nwhen he crossed a tributary of the Stour, and reached Leddenton\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlittle town of three or four thousand inhabitants\xe2\x80\x94where he went on to\r\nthe boys\xe2\x80\x99 school, and knocked at the door of the master\xe2\x80\x99s residence.\r\n\r\nA boy pupil-teacher opened it, and to Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry if Mr.\r\nGillingham was at home, replied that he was, going at once off to his\r\nown house, and leaving Phillotson to find his way in as he could. He\r\ndiscovered his friend putting away some books from which he had been\r\ngiving evening lessons. The light of the paraffin lamp fell on\r\nPhillotson\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94pale and wretched by contrast with his friend\xe2\x80\x99s, who\r\nhad a cool, practical look. They had been schoolmates in boyhood, and\r\nfellow-students at Wintoncester Training College, many years before\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad to see you, Dick! But you don\xe2\x80\x99t look well! Nothing the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhillotson advanced without replying, and Gillingham closed the\r\ncupboard and pulled up beside his visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been here\xe2\x80\x94let me see\xe2\x80\x94since you were married? I called,\r\nyou know, but you were out; and upon my word it is such a climb after\r\ndark that I have been waiting till the days are longer before lumpering\r\nup again. I am glad you didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, however.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough well-trained and even proficient masters, they occasionally used\r\na dialect-word of their boyhood to each other in private.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come, George, to explain to you my reasons for taking a step that\r\nI am about to take, so that you, at least, will understand my motives\r\nif other people question them anywhen\xe2\x80\x94as they may, indeed certainly\r\nwill\xe2\x80\xa6 But anything is better than the present condition of things. God\r\nforbid that you should ever have such an experience as mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\xe2\x80\x94anything wrong between you and Mrs.\r\nPhillotson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do\xe2\x80\xa6 My wretched state is that I\xe2\x80\x99ve a wife I love who not only does\r\nnot love me, but\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94 Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say. I know her feeling! I should\r\nprefer hatred from her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSsh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the sad part of it is that she is not so much to blame as I. She\r\nwas a pupil-teacher under me, as you know, and I took advantage of her\r\ninexperience, and toled her out for walks, and got her to agree to a\r\nlong engagement before she well knew her own mind. Afterwards she saw\r\nsomebody else, but she blindly fulfilled her engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoving the other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; with a curious tender solicitude seemingly; though her exact\r\nfeeling for him is a riddle to me\xe2\x80\x94and to him too, I think\xe2\x80\x94possibly to\r\nherself. She is one of the oddest creatures I ever met. However, I have\r\nbeen struck with these two facts; the extraordinary sympathy, or\r\nsimilarity, between the pair. He is her cousin, which perhaps accounts\r\nfor some of it. They seem to be one person split in two! And with her\r\nunconquerable aversion to myself as a husband, even though she may like\r\nme as a friend, \xe2\x80\x99tis too much to bear longer. She has conscientiously\r\nstruggled against it, but to no purpose. I cannot bear it\xe2\x80\x94I cannot! I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t answer her arguments\xe2\x80\x94she has read ten times as much as I. Her\r\nintellect sparkles like diamonds, while mine smoulders like brown\r\npaper\xe2\x80\xa6 She\xe2\x80\x99s one too many for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll get over it, good-now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! It is\xe2\x80\x94but I won\xe2\x80\x99t go into it\xe2\x80\x94there are reasons why she never\r\nwill. At last she calmly and firmly asked if she might leave me and go\r\nto him. The climax came last night, when, owing to my entering her room\r\nby accident, she jumped out of window\xe2\x80\x94so strong was her dread of me!\r\nShe pretended it was a dream, but that was to soothe me. Now when a\r\nwoman jumps out of window without caring whether she breaks her neck or\r\nno, she\xe2\x80\x99s not to be mistaken; and this being the case I have come to a\r\nconclusion: that it is wrong to so torture a fellow-creature any\r\nlonger; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t be the inhuman wretch to do it, cost what it may!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll let her go? And with her lover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom with is her matter. I shall let her go; with him certainly, if\r\nshe wishes. I know I may be wrong\xe2\x80\x94I know I can\xe2\x80\x99t logically, or\r\nreligiously, defend my concession to such a wish of hers, or harmonize\r\nit with the doctrines I was brought up in. Only I know one thing:\r\nsomething within me tells me I am doing wrong in refusing her. I, like\r\nother men, profess to hold that if a husband gets such a so-called\r\npreposterous request from his wife, the only course that can possibly\r\nbe regarded as right and proper and honourable in him is to refuse it,\r\nand put her virtuously under lock and key, and murder her lover\r\nperhaps. But is that essentially right, and proper, and honourable, or\r\nis it contemptibly mean and selfish? I don\xe2\x80\x99t profess to decide. I\r\nsimply am going to act by instinct, and let principles take care of\r\nthemselves. If a person who has blindly walked into a quagmire cries\r\nfor help, I am inclined to give it, if possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94you see, there\xe2\x80\x99s the question of neighbours and society\xe2\x80\x94what will\r\nhappen if everybody\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am not going to be a philosopher any longer! I only see what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunder my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with your instinct, Dick!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gillingham gravely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite amazed, to tell the truth, that such a sedate, plodding\r\nfellow as you should have entertained such a craze for a moment. You\r\nsaid when I called that she was puzzling and peculiar: I think you\r\nare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever stood before a woman whom you know to be intrinsically a\r\ngood woman, while she has pleaded for release\xe2\x80\x94been the man she has\r\nknelt to and implored indulgence of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thankful to say I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you are in a position to give an opinion. I have\r\nbeen that man, and it makes all the difference in the world, if one has\r\nany manliness or chivalry in him. I had not the remotest idea\xe2\x80\x94living\r\napart from women as I have done for so many years\xe2\x80\x94that merely taking a\r\nwoman to church and putting a ring upon her finger could by any\r\npossibility involve one in such a daily, continuous tragedy as that now\r\nshared by her and me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I could admit some excuse for letting her leave you, provided\r\nshe kept to herself. But to go attended by a cavalier\xe2\x80\x94that makes a\r\ndifference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit. Suppose, as I believe, she would rather endure her present\r\nmisery than be made to promise to keep apart from him? All that is a\r\nquestion for herself. It is not the same thing at all as the treachery\r\nof living on with a husband and playing him false\xe2\x80\xa6 However, she has not\r\ndistinctly implied living with him as wife, though I think she means\r\nto... And, to the best of my understanding, it is not an ignoble,\r\nmerely animal, feeling between the two: that is the worst of it;\r\nbecause it makes me think their affection will be enduring. I did not\r\nmean to confess to you that in the first jealous weeks of my marriage,\r\nbefore I had come to my right mind, I hid myself in the school one\r\nevening when they were together there, and I heard what they said. I am\r\nashamed of it now, though I suppose I was only exercising a legal\r\nright. I found from their manner that an extraordinary affinity, or\r\nsympathy, entered into their attachment, which somehow took away all\r\nflavour of grossness. Their supreme desire is to be together\xe2\x80\x94to share\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s emotions, and fancies, and dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlatonic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell no. Shelleyan would be nearer to it. They remind me of\xe2\x80\x94what are\r\ntheir names\xe2\x80\x94Laon and Cythna. Also of Paul and Virginia a little. The\r\nmore I reflect, the more _entirely_ I am on their side!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if people did as you want to do, there\xe2\x80\x99d be a general domestic\r\ndisintegration. The family would no longer be the social unit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I am all abroad, I suppose!\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was never a\r\nvery bright reasoner, you remember. \xe2\x80\xa6 And yet, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why the\r\nwoman and the children should not be the unit without the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Lord Harry!\xe2\x80\x94Matriarchy! \xe2\x80\xa6 Does _she_ say all this too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. She little thinks I have out-Sued Sue in this\xe2\x80\x94all in the last\r\ntwelve hours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will upset all received opinion hereabout. Good God\xe2\x80\x94what will\r\nShaston say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say that it won\xe2\x80\x99t. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know! \xe2\x80\xa6 As I say, I am\r\nonly a feeler, not a reasoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gillingham, \xe2\x80\x9clet us take it quietly, and have something to\r\ndrink over it.\xe2\x80\x9d He went under the stairs, and produced a bottle of\r\ncider-wine, of which they drank a rummer each. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you are rafted,\r\nand not yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cDo go back and make up your mind to\r\nput up with a few whims. But keep her. I hear on all sides that she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncharming young thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes! That\xe2\x80\x99s the bitterness of it! Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t stay. I have a long\r\nwalk before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGillingham accompanied his friend a mile on his way, and at parting\r\nexpressed his hope that this consultation, singular as its subject was,\r\nwould be the renewal of their old comradeship. \xe2\x80\x9cStick to her!\xe2\x80\x9d were his\r\nlast words, flung into the darkness after Phillotson; from which his\r\nfriend answered \xe2\x80\x9cAye, aye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when Phillotson was alone under the clouds of night, and no sound\r\nwas audible but that of the purling tributaries of the Stour, he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Gillingham, my friend, you had no stronger arguments against it\r\nthan those!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she ought to be smacked, and brought to her senses\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nI think!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Gillingham, as he walked back alone.\r\n\r\nThe next morning came, and at breakfast Phillotson told Sue:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may go\xe2\x80\x94with whom you will. I absolutely and unconditionally\r\nagree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving once come to this conclusion it seemed to Phillotson more and\r\nmore indubitably the true one. His mild serenity at the sense that he\r\nwas doing his duty by a woman who was at his mercy almost overpowered\r\nhis grief at relinquishing her.\r\n\r\nSome days passed, and the evening of their last meal together had\r\ncome\xe2\x80\x94a cloudy evening with wind\xe2\x80\x94which indeed was very seldom absent in\r\nthis elevated place. How permanently it was imprinted upon his vision;\r\nthat look of her as she glided into the parlour to tea; a slim flexible\r\nfigure; a face, strained from its roundness, and marked by the pallors\r\nof restless days and nights, suggesting tragic possibilities quite at\r\nvariance with her times of buoyancy; a trying of this morsel and that,\r\nand an inability to eat either. Her nervous manner, begotten of a fear\r\nlest he should be injured by her course, might have been interpreted by\r\na stranger as displeasure that Phillotson intruded his presence on her\r\nfor the few brief minutes that remained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better have a slice of ham or an egg, or something with your\r\ntea? You can\xe2\x80\x99t travel on a mouthful of bread and butter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took the slice he helped her to; and they discussed as they sat\r\ntrivial questions of housekeeping, such as where he would find the key\r\nof this or that cupboard, what little bills were paid, and what not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a bachelor by nature, as you know, Sue,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a heroic\r\nattempt to put her at her ease. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that being without a wife will not\r\nreally be irksome to me, as it might be to other men who have had one a\r\nlittle while. I have, too, this grand hobby in my head of writing \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nRoman Antiquities of Wessex,\xe2\x80\x99 which will occupy all my spare hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will send me some of the manuscript to copy at any time, as you\r\nused to, I will do it with so much pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with amenable\r\ngentleness. \xe2\x80\x9cI should much like to be some help to you still\xe2\x80\x94as\r\na\xe2\x80\x94f-f-friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhillotson mused, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think we ought to be really\r\nseparate, if we are to be at all. And for this reason, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwish to ask you any questions, and particularly wish you not to give me\r\ninformation as to your movements, or even your address\xe2\x80\xa6 Now, what money\r\ndo you want? You must have some, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course, Richard, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of having any of your money\r\nto go away from you with! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any either. I have enough of my\r\nown to last me for a long while, and Jude will let me have\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not know anything about him, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. You are\r\nfree, absolutely; and your course is your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that I have packed only a change or two\r\nof my own personal clothing, and one or two little things besides that\r\nare my very own. I wish you would look into my trunk before it is\r\nclosed. Besides that I have only a small parcel that will go into\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s portmanteau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I shall do no such thing as examine your luggage! I wish you\r\nwould take three-quarters of the household furniture. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nbe bothered with it. I have a sort of affection for a little of it that\r\nbelonged to my poor mother and father. But the rest you are welcome to\r\nwhenever you like to send for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I shall never do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go by the six-thirty train, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? It is now a quarter to\r\nsix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\xa6 You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem very sorry I am going, Richard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94perhaps not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like you much for how you have behaved. It is a curious thing that\r\ndirectly I have begun to regard you as not my husband, but as my old\r\nteacher, I like you. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be so affected as to say I love you,\r\nbecause you know I don\xe2\x80\x99t, except as a friend. But you do seem that to\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue was for a few moments a little tearful at these reflections, and\r\nthen the station omnibus came round to take her up. Phillotson saw her\r\nthings put on the top, handed her in, and was obliged to make an\r\nappearance of kissing her as he wished her good-bye, which she quite\r\nunderstood and imitated. From the cheerful manner in which they parted\r\nthe omnibus-man had no other idea than that she was going for a short\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nWhen Phillotson got back into the house he went upstairs and opened the\r\nwindow in the direction the omnibus had taken. Soon the noise of its\r\nwheels died away. He came down then, his face compressed like that of\r\none bearing pain; he put on his hat and went out, following by the same\r\nroute for nearly a mile. Suddenly turning round he came home.\r\n\r\nHe had no sooner entered than the voice of his friend Gillingham\r\ngreeted him from the front room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could make nobody hear; so finding your door open I walked in, and\r\nmade myself comfortable. I said I would call, you remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am much obliged to you, Gillingham, particularly for coming\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Mrs.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is quite well. She is gone\xe2\x80\x94just gone. That\xe2\x80\x99s her tea-cup, that she\r\ndrank out of only an hour ago. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the plate she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthroat got choked up, and he could not go on. He turned and pushed the\r\ntea-things aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you had any tea, by the by?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked presently in a renewed\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gillingham, preoccupied. \xe2\x80\x9cGone, you say she\r\nis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\xa6 I would have died for her; but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be cruel to her in the\r\nname of the law. She is, as I understand, gone to join her lover. What\r\nthey are going to do I cannot say. Whatever it may be she has my full\r\nconsent to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a stability, a ballast, in Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s pronouncement which\r\nrestrained his friend\xe2\x80\x99s comment. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I\xe2\x80\x94leave you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. It is a mercy to me that you have come. I have some articles\r\nto arrange and clear away. Would you help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGillingham assented; and having gone to the upper rooms the\r\nschoolmaster opened drawers, and began taking out all Sue\xe2\x80\x99s things that\r\nshe had left behind, and laying them in a large box. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nall I wanted her to,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when I made up my mind to her\r\ngoing to live in her own way I did make up my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome men would have stopped at an agreement to separate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve gone into all that, and don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to argue it. I was, and am,\r\nthe most old-fashioned man in the world on the question of marriage\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nfact I had never thought critically about its ethics at all. But\r\ncertain facts stared me in the face, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go against them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went on with the packing silently. When it was done Phillotson\r\nclosed the box and turned the key.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo adorn her in somebody\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; never again in\r\nmine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nFour-and-twenty hours before this time Sue had written the following\r\nnote to Jude:\r\n\r\nIt is as I told you; and I am leaving to-morrow evening. Richard and I\r\nthought it could be done with less obtrusiveness after dark. I feel\r\nrather frightened, and therefore ask you to be sure you are on the\r\nMelchester platform to meet me. I arrive at a little to seven. I know\r\nyou will, of course, dear Jude; but I feel so timid that I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nbegging you to be punctual. He has been so _very_ kind to me through it\r\nall!\r\n    Now to our meeting!\r\n\r\n\r\nS.\r\n\r\nAs she was carried by the omnibus farther and farther down from the\r\nmountain town\xe2\x80\x94the single passenger that evening\xe2\x80\x94she regarded the\r\nreceding road with a sad face. But no hesitation was apparent therein.\r\n\r\nThe up-train by which she was departing stopped by signal only. To Sue\r\nit seemed strange that such a powerful organization as a railway train\r\nshould be brought to a stand-still on purpose for her\xe2\x80\x94a fugitive from\r\nher lawful home.\r\n\r\nThe twenty minutes\xe2\x80\x99 journey drew towards its close, and Sue began\r\ngathering her things together to alight. At the moment that the train\r\ncame to a stand-still by the Melchester platform a hand was laid on the\r\ndoor and she beheld Jude. He entered the compartment promptly. He had a\r\nblack bag in his hand, and was dressed in the dark suit he wore on\r\nSundays and in the evening after work. Altogether he looked a very\r\nhandsome young fellow, his ardent affection for her burning in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d She clasped his hand with both hers, and her tense state\r\ncaused her to simmer over in a little succession of dry sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\nso glad! I get out here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I get in, dear one! I\xe2\x80\x99ve packed. Besides this bag I\xe2\x80\x99ve only a big\r\nbox which is labelled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t I get out? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t we going to stay here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see. We are known here\xe2\x80\x94I, at any rate,\r\nam well known. I\xe2\x80\x99ve booked for Aldbrickham; and here\xe2\x80\x99s your ticket for\r\nthe same place, as you have only one to here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought we should have stayed here,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Perhaps not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t time for me to write and say the place I had decided on.\r\nAldbrickham is a much bigger town\xe2\x80\x94sixty or seventy thousand\r\ninhabitants\xe2\x80\x94and nobody knows anything about us there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have given up your cathedral work here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It was rather sudden\xe2\x80\x94your message coming unexpectedly. Strictly,\r\nI might have been made to finish out the week. But I pleaded urgency\r\nand I was let off. I would have deserted any day at your command, dear\r\nSue. I have deserted more than that for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear I am doing you a lot of harm. Ruining your prospects of the\r\nChurch; ruining your progress in your trade; everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Church is no more to me. Let it lie! _I_ am not to be one of\r\n\r\n    The soldier-saints who, row on row,\r\nBurn upward each to his point of bliss,\r\n\r\nif any such there be! My point of bliss is not upward, but here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I seem so bad\xe2\x80\x94upsetting men\xe2\x80\x99s courses like this!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, taking\r\nup in her voice the emotion that had begun in his. But she recovered\r\nher equanimity by the time they had travelled a dozen miles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been so good in letting me go,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s a note\r\nI found on my dressing-table, addressed to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He\xe2\x80\x99s not an unworthy fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, glancing at the note.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am ashamed of myself for hating him because he married you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the rule of women\xe2\x80\x99s whims I suppose I ought to suddenly\r\nlove him, because he has let me go so generously and unexpectedly,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am so cold, or devoid of gratitude, or so\r\nsomething, that even this generosity hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made me love him, or\r\nrepent, or want to stay with him as his wife; although I do feel I like\r\nhis large-mindedness, and respect him more than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may not work so well for us as if he had been less kind, and you\r\nhad run away against his will,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I _never_ would have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s eyes rested musingly on her face. Then he suddenly kissed her;\r\nand was going to kiss her again. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94only once now\xe2\x80\x94please, Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s rather cruel,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; but acquiesced. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a strange\r\nthing has happened to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Jude continued after a silence. \xe2\x80\x9cArabella\r\nhas actually written to ask me to get a divorce from her\xe2\x80\x94in kindness to\r\nher, she says. She wants to honestly and legally marry that man she has\r\nalready married virtually; and begs me to enable her to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have agreed. I thought at first I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it without getting her\r\ninto trouble about that second marriage, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to injure her\r\nin any way. Perhaps she\xe2\x80\x99s no worse than I am, after all! But nobody\r\nknows about it over here, and I find it will not be a difficult\r\nproceeding at all. If she wants to start afresh I have only too obvious\r\nreasons for not hindering her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99ll be free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall be free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we booked for?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with the discontinuity that\r\nmarked her to-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAldbrickham, as I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it will be very late when we get there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I thought of that, and I wired for a room for us at the\r\nTemperance Hotel there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d Sue bent her forehead against the corner\r\nof the compartment. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you might do it; and that I was\r\ndeceiving you. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the pause which followed, Jude\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fixed themselves with a\r\nstultified expression on the opposite seat. \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remained in silence; and seeing how discomfited he was she put her\r\nface against his cheek, murmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be vexed, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm done,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94I understood it like that\xe2\x80\xa6 Is\r\nthis a sudden change of mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no right to ask me such a question; and I shan\xe2\x80\x99t answer!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear one, your happiness is more to me than anything\xe2\x80\x94although we\r\nseem to verge on quarrelling so often!\xe2\x80\x94and your will is law to me. I am\r\nsomething more than a mere\xe2\x80\x94selfish fellow, I hope. Have it as you\r\nwish!\xe2\x80\x9d On reflection his brow showed perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps it is\r\nthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t love me\xe2\x80\x94not that you have become conventional! Much as,\r\nunder your teaching, I hate convention, I hope it _is_ that, not the\r\nother terrible alternative!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven at this obvious moment for candour Sue could not be quite candid\r\nas to the state of that mystery, her heart. \xe2\x80\x9cPut it down to my\r\ntimidity,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with hurried evasiveness; \xe2\x80\x9cto a woman\xe2\x80\x99s natural\r\ntimidity when the crisis comes. I may feel as well as you that I have a\r\nperfect right to live with you as you thought\xe2\x80\x94from this moment. I may\r\nhold the opinion that, in a proper state of society, the father of a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s child will be as much a private matter of hers as the cut of\r\nher underlinen, on whom nobody will have any right to question her. But\r\npartly, perhaps, because it is by his generosity that I am now free, I\r\nwould rather not be other than a little rigid. If there had been a\r\nrope-ladder, and he had run after us with pistols, it would have seemed\r\ndifferent, and I may have acted otherwise. But don\xe2\x80\x99t press me and\r\ncriticize me, Jude! Assume that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the courage of my opinions. I\r\nknow I am a poor miserable creature. My nature is not so passionate as\r\nyours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe repeated simply! \xe2\x80\x9cI thought\xe2\x80\x94what I naturally thought. But if we are\r\nnot lovers, we are not. Phillotson thought so, I am sure. See, here is\r\nwhat he has written to me.\xe2\x80\x9d He opened the letter she had brought, and\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make only one condition\xe2\x80\x94that you are tender and kind to her. I know\r\nyou love her. But even love may be cruel at times. You are made for\r\neach other: it is obvious, palpable, to any unbiased older person. You\r\nwere all along \xe2\x80\x98the shadowy third\xe2\x80\x99 in my short life with her. I repeat,\r\ntake care of Sue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with latent tears. On\r\nreconsideration she added, \xe2\x80\x9cHe was very resigned to letting me go\xe2\x80\x94too\r\nresigned almost! I never was so near being in love with him as when he\r\nmade such thoughtful arrangements for my being comfortable on my\r\njourney, and offering to provide money. Yet I was not. If I loved him\r\never so little as a wife, I\xe2\x80\x99d go back to him even now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true\xe2\x80\x94oh so terribly true!\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor me neither, I half-fear!\xe2\x80\x9d he said pettishly. \xe2\x80\x9cNor anybody perhaps!\r\nSue, sometimes, when I am vexed with you, I think you are incapable of\r\nreal love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not good and loyal of you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and drawing away from him\r\nas far as she could, looked severely out into the darkness. She added\r\nin hurt tones, without turning round: \xe2\x80\x9cMy liking for you is not as some\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps. But it is a delight in being with you, of a supremely\r\ndelicate kind, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go further and risk it by\xe2\x80\x94an attempt\r\nto intensify it! I quite realized that, as woman with man, it was a\r\nrisk to come. But, as me with you, I resolved to trust you to set my\r\nwishes above your gratification. Don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss it further, dear Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, if it would make you reproach yourself\xe2\x80\xa6 but you do like me\r\nvery much, Sue? Say you do! Say that you do a quarter, a tenth, as much\r\nas I do you, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be content!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve let you kiss me, and that tells enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust once or so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be a greedy boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leant back, and did not look at her for a long time. That episode in\r\nher past history of which she had told him\xe2\x80\x94of the poor Christminster\r\ngraduate whom she had handled thus, returned to Jude\xe2\x80\x99s mind; and he saw\r\nhimself as a possible second in such a torturing destiny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a queer elopement!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are making a\r\ncat\xe2\x80\x99s paw of me with Phillotson all this time. Upon my word it almost\r\nseems so\xe2\x80\x94to see you sitting up there so prim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be angry\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you!\xe2\x80\x9d she coaxed, turning and\r\nmoving nearer to him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou did kiss me just now, you know; and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndislike you to, I own it, Jude. Only I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to let you do it\r\nagain, just yet\xe2\x80\x94considering how we are circumstanced, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could never resist her when she pleaded (as she well knew). And they\r\nsat side by side with joined hands, till she aroused herself at some\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly go to that Temperance Inn, after your telegraphing\r\nthat message!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can see well enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; there\xe2\x80\x99ll be some other one open, no doubt. I have sometimes\r\nthought, since your marrying Phillotson because of a stupid scandal,\r\nthat under the affectation of independent views you are as enslaved to\r\nthe social code as any woman I know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot mentally. But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the courage of my views, as I said before.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t marry him altogether because of the scandal. But sometimes a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s _love of being loved_ gets the better of her conscience, and\r\nthough she is agonized at the thought of treating a man cruelly, she\r\nencourages him to love her while she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love him at all. Then,\r\nwhen she sees him suffering, her remorse sets in, and she does what she\r\ncan to repair the wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou simply mean that you flirted outrageously with him, poor old chap,\r\nand then repented, and to make reparation, married him, though you\r\ntortured yourself to death by doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94if you will put it brutally!\xe2\x80\x94it was a little like that\xe2\x80\x94that and\r\nthe scandal together\xe2\x80\x94and your concealing from me what you ought to have\r\ntold me before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could see that she was distressed and tearful at his criticisms, and\r\nsoothed her, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, dear; don\xe2\x80\x99t mind! Crucify me, if you will!\r\nYou know you are all the world to me, whatever you do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very bad and unprincipled\xe2\x80\x94I know you think that!\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ntrying to blink away her tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think and know you are my dear Sue, from whom neither length nor\r\nbreadth, nor things present nor things to come, can divide me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough so sophisticated in many things, she was such a child in others\r\nthat this satisfied her, and they reached the end of their journey on\r\nthe best of terms. It was about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock when they arrived at\r\nAldbrickham, the county town of North Wessex. As she would not go to\r\nthe Temperance Hotel because of the form of his telegram, Jude inquired\r\nfor another; and a youth who volunteered to find one wheeled their\r\nluggage to the George farther on, which proved to be the inn at which\r\nJude had stayed with Arabella on that one occasion of their meeting\r\nafter their division for years.\r\n\r\nOwing, however, to their now entering it by another door, and to his\r\npreoccupation, he did not at first recognize the place. When they had\r\nengaged their respective rooms they went down to a late supper. During\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s temporary absence the waiting-maid spoke to Sue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I remember your relation, or friend, or whatever he\r\nis, coming here once before\xe2\x80\x94late, just like this, with his wife\xe2\x80\x94a lady,\r\nat any rate, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t you by no manner of means\xe2\x80\x94jest as med be with\r\nyou now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh do you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue, with a certain sickness of heart. \xe2\x80\x9cThough I\r\nthink you must be mistaken! How long ago was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a month or two. A handsome, full-figured woman. They had this\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Jude came back and sat down to supper Sue seemed moping and\r\nmiserable. \xe2\x80\x9cJude,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him plaintively, at their parting that\r\nnight upon the landing, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not so nice and pleasant as it used to\r\nbe with us! I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it here\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear the place! And I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike you so well as I did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fidgeted you seem, dear! Why do you change like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it was cruel to bring me here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were lately here with Arabella. There, now I have said it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude looking round him. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94it is the same! I\r\nreally didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it, Sue. Well\xe2\x80\x94it is not cruel, since we have come as\r\nwe have\xe2\x80\x94two relations staying together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long ago was it you were here? Tell me, tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day before I met you in Christminster, when we went back to\r\nMarygreen together. I told you I had met her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you said you had met her, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me all. Your story\r\nwas that you had met as estranged people, who were not husband and wife\r\nat all in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sight\xe2\x80\x94not that you had made it up with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t explain, Sue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been false to me; you, my last hope! And I shall never forget\r\nit, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut by your own wish, dear Sue, we are only to be friends, not lovers!\r\nIt is so very inconsistent of you to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriends can be jealous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that. You concede nothing to me and I have to concede\r\neverything to you. After all, you were on good terms with your husband\r\nat that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, Jude. Oh how can you think so! And you have taken me in,\r\neven if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to.\xe2\x80\x9d She was so mortified that he was obliged\r\nto take her into her room and close the door lest the people should\r\nhear. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it this room? Yes it was\xe2\x80\x94I see by your look it was! I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave it for mine! Oh it was treacherous of you to have her again! _I_\r\njumped out of the window!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Sue, she was, after all, my legal wife, if not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlipping down on her knees Sue buried her face in the bed and wept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knew such an unreasonable\xe2\x80\x94such a dog-in-the-manger feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not to approach you, nor anybody else!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh don\xe2\x80\x99t you _understand_ my feeling? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Why are you so\r\ngross? _I_ jumped out of the window?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJumped out of window?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t explain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was true that he did not understand her feelings very well. But he\r\ndid a little; and began to love her none the less.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I thought you cared for nobody\xe2\x80\x94desired nobody in the world but me at\r\nthat time\xe2\x80\x94and ever since!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true. I did not, and don\xe2\x80\x99t now!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, as distressed as\r\nshe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must have thought much of her! Or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I need not\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand me either\xe2\x80\x94women never do! Why\r\nshould you get into such a tantrum about nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking up from the quilt she pouted provokingly: \xe2\x80\x9cIf it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nfor that, perhaps I would have gone on to the Temperance Hotel, after\r\nall, as you proposed; for I was beginning to think I did belong to\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is of no consequence!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude distantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought, of course, that she had never been really your wife since\r\nshe left you of her own accord years and years ago! My sense of it was,\r\nthat a parting such as yours from her, and mine from him, ended the\r\nmarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say more without speaking against her, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYet I must tell you one thing, which would settle the\r\nmatter in any case. She has married another man\xe2\x80\x94really married him! I\r\nknew nothing about it till after the visit we made here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried another? \xe2\x80\xa6 It is a crime\xe2\x80\x94as the world treats it, but does not\r\nbelieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94now you are yourself again. Yes, it is a crime\xe2\x80\x94as you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhold, but would fearfully concede. But I shall never inform against\r\nher! And it is evidently a prick of conscience in her that has led her\r\nto urge me to get a divorce, that she may remarry this man legally. So\r\nyou perceive I shall not be likely to see her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know anything of this when you saw her?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSue more gently, as she rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not. Considering all things, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you ought to be\r\nangry, darling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not. But I shan\xe2\x80\x99t go to the Temperance Hotel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that I am near you, I am\r\ncomparatively happy. It is more than this earthly wretch called Me\r\ndeserves\xe2\x80\x94you spirit, you disembodied creature, you dear, sweet,\r\ntantalizing phantom\xe2\x80\x94hardly flesh at all; so that when I put my arms\r\nround you I almost expect them to pass through you as through air!\r\nForgive me for being gross, as you call it! Remember that our calling\r\ncousins when really strangers was a snare. The enmity of our parents\r\ngave a piquancy to you in my eyes that was intenser even than the\r\nnovelty of ordinary new acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay those pretty lines, then, from Shelley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Epipsychidion\xe2\x80\x99 as if\r\nthey meant me!\xe2\x80\x9d she solicited, slanting up closer to him as they stood.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know hardly any poetry,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied mournfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you? These are some of them:\r\n\r\nThere was a Being whom my spirit oft\r\nMet on its visioned wanderings far aloft.\r\n\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nA seraph of Heaven, too gentle to be human,\r\nVeiling beneath that radiant form of woman\xe2\x80\xa6\r\n\r\nOh it is too flattering, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t go on! But say it\xe2\x80\x99s me! Say it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is you, dear; exactly like you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I forgive you! And you shall kiss me just once there\xe2\x80\x94not very\r\nlong.\xe2\x80\x9d She put the tip of her finger gingerly to her cheek; and he did\r\nas commanded. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do care for me very much, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, in spite of my\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sweet!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a sigh; and bade her good-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn returning to his native town of Shaston as schoolmaster Phillotson\r\nhad won the interest and awakened the memories of the inhabitants, who,\r\nthough they did not honour him for his miscellaneous acquirements as he\r\nwould have been honoured elsewhere, retained for him a sincere regard.\r\nWhen, shortly after his arrival, he brought home a pretty\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x94awkwardly pretty for him, if he did not take care, they said\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nwere glad to have her settle among them.\r\n\r\nFor some time after her flight from that home Sue\xe2\x80\x99s absence did not\r\nexcite comment. Her place as monitor in the school was taken by another\r\nyoung woman within a few days of her vacating it, which substitution\r\nalso passed without remark, Sue\xe2\x80\x99s services having been of a provisional\r\nnature only. When, however, a month had passed, and Phillotson casually\r\nadmitted to an acquaintance that he did not know where his wife was\r\nstaying, curiosity began to be aroused; till, jumping to conclusions,\r\npeople ventured to affirm that Sue had played him false and run away\r\nfrom him. The schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s growing languor and listlessness over his\r\nwork gave countenance to the idea.\r\n\r\nThough Phillotson had held his tongue as long as he could, except to\r\nhis friend Gillingham, his honesty and directness would not allow him\r\nto do so when misapprehensions as to Sue\xe2\x80\x99s conduct spread abroad. On a\r\nMonday morning the chairman of the school committee called, and after\r\nattending to the business of the school drew Phillotson aside out of\r\nearshot of the children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my asking, Phillotson, since everybody is talking of it:\r\nis this true as to your domestic affairs\xe2\x80\x94that your wife\xe2\x80\x99s going away\r\nwas on no visit, but a secret elopement with a lover? If so, I condole\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no secret about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone to visit friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone away under circumstances that usually call for condolence\r\nwith the husband. But I gave my consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chairman looked as if he had not apprehended the remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I say is quite true,\xe2\x80\x9d Phillotson continued testily. \xe2\x80\x9cShe asked\r\nleave to go away with her lover, and I let her. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I? A\r\nwoman of full age, it was a question of her own conscience\xe2\x80\x94not for me.\r\nI was not her gaoler. I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain any further. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to be\r\nquestioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children observed that much seriousness marked the faces of the two\r\nmen, and went home and told their parents that something new had\r\nhappened about Mrs. Phillotson. Then Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s little maidservant,\r\nwho was a schoolgirl just out of her standards, said that Mr.\r\nPhillotson had helped in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s packing, had offered her what money\r\nshe required, and had written a friendly letter to her young man,\r\ntelling him to take care of her. The chairman of committee thought the\r\nmatter over, and talked to the other managers of the school, till a\r\nrequest came to Phillotson to meet them privately. The meeting lasted a\r\nlong time, and at the end the school-master came home, looking as usual\r\npale and worn. Gillingham was sitting in his house awaiting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; it is as you said,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Phillotson, flinging himself down\r\nwearily in a chair. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have requested me to send in my resignation\r\non account of my scandalous conduct in giving my tortured wife her\r\nliberty\xe2\x80\x94or, as they call it, condoning her adultery. But I shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nresign!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t. It is no business of theirs. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect me in my\r\npublic capacity at all. They may expel me if they like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you make a fuss it will get into the papers, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get\r\nappointed to another school. You see, they have to consider what you\r\ndid as done by a teacher of youth\xe2\x80\x94and its effects as such upon the\r\nmorals of the town; and, to ordinary opinion, your position is\r\nindefensible. You must let me say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this good advice, however, Phillotson would not listen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t go unless I am turned out. And for\r\nthis reason; that by resigning I acknowledge I have acted wrongly by\r\nher; when I am more and more convinced every day that in the sight of\r\nHeaven and by all natural, straightforward humanity, I have acted\r\nrightly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGillingham saw that his rather headstrong friend would not be able to\r\nmaintain such a position as this; but he said nothing further, and in\r\ndue time\xe2\x80\x94indeed, in a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x94the formal letter of dismissal\r\narrived, the managers having remained behind to write it after\r\nPhillotson\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal. The latter replied that he should not accept\r\ndismissal; and called a public meeting, which he attended, although he\r\nlooked so weak and ill that his friend implored him to stay at home.\r\nWhen he stood up to give his reasons for contesting the decision of the\r\nmanagers he advanced them firmly, as he had done to his friend, and\r\ncontended, moreover, that the matter was a domestic theory which did\r\nnot concern them. This they over-ruled, insisting that the private\r\neccentricities of a teacher came quite within their sphere of control,\r\nas it touched the morals of those he taught. Phillotson replied that he\r\ndid not see how an act of natural charity could injure morals.\r\n\r\nAll the respectable inhabitants and well-to-do fellow-natives of the\r\ntown were against Phillotson to a man. But, somewhat to his surprise,\r\nsome dozen or more champions rose up in his defence as from the ground.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that Shaston was the anchorage of a curious and\r\ninteresting group of itinerants, who frequented the numerous fairs and\r\nmarkets held up and down Wessex during the summer and autumn months.\r\nAlthough Phillotson had never spoken to one of these gentlemen they now\r\nnobly led the forlorn hope in his defence. The body included two cheap\r\nJacks, a shooting-gallery proprietor and the ladies who loaded the\r\nguns, a pair of boxing-masters, a steam-roundabout manager, two\r\ntravelling broom-makers, who called themselves widows, a\r\ngingerbread-stall keeper, a swing-boat owner, and a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctest-your-strength\xe2\x80\x9d man.\r\n\r\nThis generous phalanx of supporters, and a few others of independent\r\njudgment, whose own domestic experiences had been not without\r\nvicissitude, came up and warmly shook hands with Phillotson; after\r\nwhich they expressed their thoughts so strongly to the meeting that\r\nissue was joined, the result being a general scuffle, wherein a black\r\nboard was split, three panes of the school windows were broken, an\r\ninkbottle was spilled over a town-councillor\xe2\x80\x99s shirt front, a\r\nchurchwarden was dealt such a topper with the map of Palestine that his\r\nhead went right through Samaria, and many black eyes and bleeding noses\r\nwere given, one of which, to everybody\xe2\x80\x99s horror, was the venerable\r\nincumbent\xe2\x80\x99s, owing to the zeal of an emancipated chimney-sweep, who\r\ntook the side of Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s party. When Phillotson saw the blood\r\nrunning down the rector\xe2\x80\x99s face he deplored almost in groans the\r\nuntoward and degrading circumstances, regretted that he had not\r\nresigned when called upon, and went home so ill that next morning he\r\ncould not leave his bed.\r\n\r\nThe farcical yet melancholy event was the beginning of a serious\r\nillness for him; and he lay in his lonely bed in the pathetic state of\r\nmind of a middle-aged man who perceives at length that his life,\r\nintellectual and domestic, is tending to failure and gloom. Gillingham\r\ncame to see him in the evenings, and on one occasion mentioned Sue\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care anything about me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should\r\nshe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know you are ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better for both of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are her lover and she living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Melchester\xe2\x80\x94I suppose; at least he was living there some time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Gillingham reached home he sat and reflected, and at last wrote an\r\nanonymous line to Sue, on the bare chance of its reaching her, the\r\nletter being enclosed in an envelope addressed to Jude at the diocesan\r\ncapital. Arriving at that place it was forwarded to Marygreen in North\r\nWessex, and thence to Aldbrickham by the only person who knew his\r\npresent address\xe2\x80\x94the widow who had nursed his aunt.\r\n\r\nThree days later, in the evening, when the sun was going down in\r\nsplendour over the lowlands of Blackmoor, and making the Shaston\r\nwindows like tongues of fire to the eyes of the rustics in that vale,\r\nthe sick man fancied that he heard somebody come to the house, and a\r\nfew minutes after there was a tap at the bedroom door. Phillotson did\r\nnot speak; the door was hesitatingly opened, and there entered\xe2\x80\x94Sue.\r\n\r\nShe was in light spring clothing, and her advent seemed ghostly\xe2\x80\x94like\r\nthe flitting in of a moth. He turned his eyes upon her, and flushed;\r\nbut appeared to check his primary impulse to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no business here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, bending her frightened face to\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I heard you were ill\xe2\x80\x94very ill; and\xe2\x80\x94and as I know that you\r\nrecognize other feelings between man and woman than physical love, I\r\nhave come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not very ill, my dear friend. Only unwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that; and I am afraid that only a severe illness would\r\nhave justified my coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\xa6 yes. And I almost wish you had not come! It is a little too\r\nsoon\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all I mean. Still, let us make the best of it. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nheard about the school, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94what about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly that I am going away from here to another place. The managers and\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t agree, and we are going to part\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue did not for a moment, either now or later, suspect what troubles\r\nhad resulted to him from letting her go; it never once seemed to cross\r\nher mind, and she had received no news whatever from Shaston. They\r\ntalked on slight and ephemeral subjects, and when his tea was brought\r\nup he told the amazed little servant that a cup was to be set for Sue.\r\nThat young person was much more interested in their history than they\r\nsupposed, and as she descended the stairs she lifted her eyes and hands\r\nin grotesque amazement. While they sipped Sue went to the window and\r\nthoughtfully said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is such a beautiful sunset, Richard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are mostly beautiful from here, owing to the rays crossing the\r\nmist of the vale. But I lose them all, as they don\xe2\x80\x99t shine into this\r\ngloomy corner where I lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to see this particular one? It is like heaven\r\nopened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes! But I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94the bedstead can\xe2\x80\x99t be shifted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut see how I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to where a swing-glass stood, and taking it in her hands\r\ncarried it to a spot by the window where it could catch the sunshine,\r\nmoving the glass till the beams were reflected into Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94you can see the great red sun now!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am sure it\r\nwill cheer you\xe2\x80\x94I do so hope it will!\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke with a childlike,\r\nrepentant kindness, as if she could not do too much for him.\r\n\r\nPhillotson smiled sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are an odd creature!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured as the\r\nsun glowed in his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea of your coming to see me after what\r\nhas passed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us go back upon that!\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to catch\r\nthe omnibus for the train, as Jude doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know I have come; he was out\r\nwhen I started; so I must return home almost directly. Richard, I am so\r\nvery glad you are better. You don\xe2\x80\x99t hate me, do you? You have been such\r\na kind friend to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to know you think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson huskily. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhate you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt grew dusk quickly in the gloomy room during their intermittent chat,\r\nand when candles were brought and it was time to leave she put her hand\r\nin his or rather allowed it to flit through his; for she was\r\nsignificantly light in touch. She had nearly closed the door when he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cSue!\xe2\x80\x9d He had noticed that, in turning away from him, tears were\r\non her face and a quiver in her lip.\r\n\r\nIt was bad policy to recall her\xe2\x80\x94he knew it while he pursued it. But he\r\ncould not help it. She came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you wish to make it up, and stay? I\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive\r\nyou and condone everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you can\xe2\x80\x99t, you can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t condone it\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_He_ is your husband now, in effect, you mean, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may assume it. He is obtaining a divorce from his wife Arabella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis wife! It is altogether news to me that he has a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a bad marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike mine. He is not doing it so much on his own account as on hers.\r\nShe wrote and told him it would be a kindness to her, since then she\r\ncould marry and live respectably. And Jude has agreed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wife\xe2\x80\xa6 A kindness to her. Ah, yes; a kindness to her to release her\r\naltogether\xe2\x80\xa6 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the sound of it. I can forgive, Sue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! You can\xe2\x80\x99t have me back now I have been so wicked\xe2\x80\x94as to do what\r\nI have done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere had arisen in Sue\xe2\x80\x99s face that incipient fright which showed\r\nitself whenever he changed from friend to husband, and which made her\r\nadopt any line of defence against marital feeling in him. \xe2\x80\x9cI _must_ go\r\nnow. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come again\xe2\x80\x94may I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to go, even now. I ask you to stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, Richard; but I must. As you are not so ill as I thought,\r\nI _cannot_ stay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s his\xe2\x80\x94his from lips to heel!\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson; but so faintly that\r\nin closing the door she did not hear it. The dread of a reactionary\r\nchange in the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments, coupled, perhaps, with a faint\r\nshamefacedness at letting even him know what a slipshod lack of\r\nthoroughness, from a man\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, characterized her transferred\r\nallegiance, prevented her telling him of her, thus far, incomplete\r\nrelations with Jude; and Phillotson lay writhing like a man in hell as\r\nhe pictured the prettily dressed, maddening compound of sympathy and\r\naverseness who bore his name, returning impatiently to the home of her\r\nlover.\r\n\r\nGillingham was so interested in Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s affairs, and so seriously\r\nconcerned about him, that he walked up the hill-side to Shaston two or\r\nthree times a week, although, there and back, it was a journey of nine\r\nmiles, which had to be performed between tea and supper, after a hard\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s work in school. When he called on the next occasion after Sue\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvisit his friend was downstairs, and Gillingham noticed that his\r\nrestless mood had been supplanted by a more fixed and composed one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been here since you called last,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot Mrs. Phillotson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You have made it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\xa6 She just came, patted my pillow with her little white hand, played\r\nthe thoughtful nurse for half an hour, and went away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m hanged! A little hussy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, what a tantalizing, capricious little woman! If she were not\r\nyour wife\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not; she\xe2\x80\x99s another man\xe2\x80\x99s except in name and law. And I have\r\nbeen thinking\xe2\x80\x94it was suggested to me by a conversation I had with\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94that, in kindness to her, I ought to dissolve the legal tie\r\naltogether; which, singularly enough, I think I can do, now she has\r\nbeen back, and refused my request to stay after I said I had forgiven\r\nher. I believe that fact would afford me opportunity of doing it,\r\nthough I did not see it at the moment. What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of keeping her\r\nchained on to me if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to me? I know\xe2\x80\x94I feel absolutely\r\ncertain\xe2\x80\x94that she would welcome my taking such a step as the greatest\r\ncharity to her. For though as a fellow-creature she sympathizes with,\r\nand pities me, and even weeps for me, as a husband she cannot endure\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94she loathes me\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no use in mincing words\xe2\x80\x94she loathes me, and\r\nmy only manly, and dignified, and merciful course is to complete what I\r\nhave begun\xe2\x80\xa6 And for worldly reasons, too, it will be better for her to\r\nbe independent. I have hopelessly ruined my prospects because of my\r\ndecision as to what was best for us, though she does not know it; I see\r\nonly dire poverty ahead from my feet to the grave; for I can be\r\naccepted as teacher no more. I shall probably have enough to do to make\r\nboth ends meet during the remainder of my life, now my occupation\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone; and I shall be better able to bear it alone. I may as well tell\r\nyou that what has suggested my letting her go is some news she brought\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94the news that Fawley is doing the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94he had a spouse, too? A queer couple, these lovers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want your opinion on that. What I was going to say is\r\nthat my liberating her can do her no possible harm, and will open up a\r\nchance of happiness for her which she has never dreamt of hitherto. For\r\nthen they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to marry, as they ought to have done at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGillingham did not hurry to reply. \xe2\x80\x9cI may disagree with your motive,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said gently, for he respected views he could not share. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think\r\nyou are right in your determination\xe2\x80\x94if you can carry it out. I doubt,\r\nhowever, if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Fifth AT ALDBRICKHAM AND ELSEWHERE\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cThy aerial part, and all the fiery parts which are mingled in thee,\r\nthough by nature they have an upward tendency, still in obedience to\r\nthe disposition of the universe they are over-powered here in the\r\ncompound mass the body.\xe2\x80\x9d_\xe2\x80\x94M. ANTONINUS (Long).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Gillingham\xe2\x80\x99s doubts were disposed of will most quickly appear by\r\npassing over the series of dreary months and incidents that followed\r\nthe events of the last chapter, and coming on to a Sunday in the\r\nFebruary of the year following.\r\n\r\nSue and Jude were living in Aldbrickham, in precisely the same\r\nrelations that they had established between themselves when she left\r\nShaston to join him the year before. The proceedings in the law-courts\r\nhad reached their consciousness, but as a distant sound and an\r\noccasional missive which they hardly understood.\r\n\r\nThey had met, as usual, to breakfast together in the little house with\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s name on it, that he had taken at fifteen pounds a year, with\r\nthree-pounds-ten extra for rates and taxes, and furnished with his\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s ancient and lumbering goods, which had cost him about their full\r\nvalue to bring all the way from Marygreen. Sue kept house, and managed\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the room this morning Sue held up a letter she had just\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; and what is it about?\xe2\x80\x9d he said after kissing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat the decree _nisi_ in the case of Phillotson _versus_ Phillotson\r\nand Fawley, pronounced six months ago, has just been made absolute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, as he sat down.\r\n\r\nThe same concluding incident in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s suit against Arabella had\r\noccurred about a month or two earlier. Both cases had been too\r\ninsignificant to be reported in the papers, further than by name in a\r\nlong list of other undefended cases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, Sue, at any rate, you can do what you like!\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at\r\nhis sweetheart curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we\xe2\x80\x94you and I\xe2\x80\x94just as free now as if we had never married at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as free\xe2\x80\x94except, I believe, that a clergyman may object personally\r\nto remarry you, and hand the job on to somebody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I wonder\xe2\x80\x94do you think it is really so with us? I know it is\r\ngenerally. But I have an uncomfortable feeling that my freedom has been\r\nobtained under false pretences!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94if the truth about us had been known, the decree wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nbeen pronounced. It is only, is it, because we have made no defence,\r\nand have led them into a false supposition? Therefore is my freedom\r\nlawful, however proper it may be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94why did you let it be under false pretences? You have only\r\nyourself to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d he said mischievously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJude\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t! You ought not to be touchy about that still. You must take\r\nme as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, darling: so I will. Perhaps you were right. As to your\r\nquestion, we were not obliged to prove anything. That was their\r\nbusiness. Anyhow we are living together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Though not in their sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing is certain, that however the decree may be brought about, a\r\nmarriage is dissolved when it is dissolved. There is this advantage in\r\nbeing poor obscure people like us\xe2\x80\x94that these things are done for us in\r\na rough and ready fashion. It was the same with me and Arabella. I was\r\nafraid her criminal second marriage would have been discovered, and she\r\npunished; but nobody took any interest in her\xe2\x80\x94nobody inquired, nobody\r\nsuspected it. If we\xe2\x80\x99d been patented nobilities we should have had\r\ninfinite trouble, and days and weeks would have been spent in\r\ninvestigations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy degrees Sue acquired her lover\xe2\x80\x99s cheerfulness at the sense of\r\nfreedom, and proposed that they should take a walk in the fields, even\r\nif they had to put up with a cold dinner on account of it. Jude agreed,\r\nand Sue went up-stairs and prepared to start, putting on a joyful\r\ncoloured gown in observance of her liberty; seeing which Jude put on a\r\nlighter tie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll strut arm and arm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clike any other engaged couple.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve a legal right to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey rambled out of the town, and along a path over the low-lying lands\r\nthat bordered it, though these were frosty now, and the extensive\r\nseed-fields were bare of colour and produce. The pair, however, were so\r\nabsorbed in their own situation that their surroundings were little in\r\ntheir consciousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dearest, the result of all this is that we can marry after a\r\ndecent interval.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I suppose we can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd aren\xe2\x80\x99t we going to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to say no, dear Jude; but I feel just the same about it\r\nnow as I have done all along. I have just the same dread lest an iron\r\ncontract should extinguish your tenderness for me, and mine for you, as\r\nit did between our unfortunate parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, what can we do? I do love you, as you know, Sue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it abundantly. But I think I would much rather go on living\r\nalways as lovers, as we are living now, and only meeting by day. It is\r\nso much sweeter\xe2\x80\x94for the woman at least, and when she is sure of the\r\nman. And henceforward we needn\xe2\x80\x99t be so particular as we have been about\r\nappearances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur experiences of matrimony with others have not been encouraging, I\r\nown,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with some gloom; \xe2\x80\x9ceither owing to our own dissatisfied,\r\nunpractical natures, or by our misfortune. But we two\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould be two dissatisfied ones linked together, which would be twice\r\nas bad as before\xe2\x80\xa6 I think I should begin to be afraid of you, Jude, the\r\nmoment you had contracted to cherish me under a Government stamp, and I\r\nwas licensed to be loved on the premises by you\xe2\x80\x94Ugh, how horrible and\r\nsordid! Although, as you are, free, I trust you more than any other man\r\nin the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t say I should change!\xe2\x80\x9d he expostulated; yet there was\r\nmisgiving in his own voice also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApart from ourselves, and our unhappy peculiarities, it is foreign to\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s nature to go on loving a person when he is told that he must\r\nand shall be that person\xe2\x80\x99s lover. There would be a much likelier chance\r\nof his doing it if he were told not to love. If the marriage ceremony\r\nconsisted in an oath and signed contract between the parties to cease\r\nloving from that day forward, in consideration of personal possession\r\nbeing given, and to avoid each other\xe2\x80\x99s society as much as possible in\r\npublic, there would be more loving couples than there are now. Fancy\r\nthe secret meetings between the perjuring husband and wife, the denials\r\nof having seen each other, the clambering in at bedroom windows, and\r\nthe hiding in closets! There\xe2\x80\x99d be little cooling then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but admitting this, or something like it, to be true, you are not\r\nthe only one in the world to see it, dear little Sue. People go on\r\nmarrying because they can\xe2\x80\x99t resist natural forces, although many of\r\nthem may know perfectly well that they are possibly buying a month\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npleasure with a life\xe2\x80\x99s discomfort. No doubt my father and mother, and\r\nyour father and mother, saw it, if they at all resembled us in habits\r\nof observation. But then they went and married just the same, because\r\nthey had ordinary passions. But you, Sue, are such a phantasmal,\r\nbodiless creature, one who\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me to say it\xe2\x80\x94has so little\r\nanimal passion in you, that you can act upon reason in the matter, when\r\nwe poor unfortunate wretches of grosser substance can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve owned that it would probably end in misery\r\nfor us. And I am not so exceptional a woman as you think. Fewer women\r\nlike marriage than you suppose, only they enter into it for the dignity\r\nit is assumed to confer, and the social advantages it gains them\r\nsometimes\xe2\x80\x94a dignity and an advantage that I am quite willing to do\r\nwithout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude fell back upon his old complaint\xe2\x80\x94that, intimate as they were, he\r\nhad never once had from her an honest, candid declaration that she\r\nloved or could love him. \xe2\x80\x9cI really fear sometimes that you cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, with a dubiousness approaching anger. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are so reticent. I\r\nknow that women are taught by other women that they must never admit\r\nthe full truth to a man. But the highest form of affection is based on\r\nfull sincerity on both sides. Not being men, these women don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthat in looking back on those he has had tender relations with, a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart returns closest to her who was the soul of truth in her conduct.\r\nThe better class of man, even if caught by airy affectations of dodging\r\nand parrying, is not retained by them. A Nemesis attends the woman who\r\nplays the game of elusiveness too often, in the utter contempt for her\r\nthat, sooner or later, her old admirers feel; under which they allow\r\nher to go unlamented to her grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue, who was regarding the distance, had acquired a guilty look; and\r\nshe suddenly replied in a tragic voice: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I like you\r\nto-day so well as I did, Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well\xe2\x80\x94you are not nice\xe2\x80\x94too sermony. Though I suppose I am so bad\r\nand worthless that I deserve the utmost rigour of lecturing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you are not bad. You are a dear. But as slippery as an eel when I\r\nwant to get a confession from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I am bad, and obstinate, and all sorts! It is no use your\r\npretending I am not! People who are good don\xe2\x80\x99t want scolding as I do\xe2\x80\xa6\r\nBut now that I have nobody but you, and nobody to defend me, it is very\r\nhard that I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t have my own way in deciding how I\xe2\x80\x99ll live with you,\r\nand whether I\xe2\x80\x99ll be married or no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue, my own comrade and sweetheart, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to force you either\r\nto marry or to do the other thing\xe2\x80\x94of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t! It is too wicked\r\nof you to be so pettish! Now we won\xe2\x80\x99t say any more about it, and go on\r\njust the same as we have done; and during the rest of our walk we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntalk of the meadows only, and the floods, and the prospect of the\r\nfarmers this coming year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this the subject of marriage was not mentioned by them for\r\nseveral days, though living as they were with only a landing between\r\nthem it was constantly in their minds. Sue was assisting Jude very\r\nmaterially now: he had latterly occupied himself on his own account in\r\nworking and lettering headstones, which he kept in a little yard at the\r\nback of his little house, where in the intervals of domestic duties she\r\nmarked out the letters full size for him, and blacked them in after he\r\nhad cut them. It was a lower class of handicraft than were his former\r\nperformances as a cathedral mason, and his only patrons were the poor\r\npeople who lived in his own neighbourhood, and knew what a cheap man\r\nthis \xe2\x80\x9cJude Fawley: Monumental Mason\xe2\x80\x9d (as he called himself on his front\r\ndoor) was to employ for the simple memorials they required for their\r\ndead. But he seemed more independent than before, and it was the only\r\narrangement under which Sue, who particularly wished to be no burden on\r\nhim, could render any assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an evening at the end of the month, and Jude had just returned\r\nhome from hearing a lecture on ancient history in the public hall not\r\nfar off. When he entered, Sue, who had been keeping indoors during his\r\nabsence, laid out supper for him. Contrary to custom she did not speak.\r\nJude had taken up some illustrated paper, which he perused till,\r\nraising his eyes, he saw that her face was troubled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you depressed, Sue?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a message for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody has called?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. A woman.\xe2\x80\x9d Sue\xe2\x80\x99s voice quavered as she spoke, and she suddenly sat\r\ndown from her preparations, laid her hands in her lap, and looked into\r\nthe fire. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I did right or not!\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsaid you were not at home, and when she said she would wait, I said I\r\nthought you might not be able to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you say that, dear? I suppose she wanted a headstone. Was she\r\nin mourning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in mourning, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a headstone; and I\r\nthought you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see her.\xe2\x80\x9d Sue looked critically and imploringly at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who was she? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t she say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give her name. But I know who she was\xe2\x80\x94I think I do!\r\nIt was Arabella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven save us! What should Arabella come for? What made you think it\r\nwas she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can hardly tell. But I know it was! I feel perfectly certain it\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94by the light in her eyes as she looked at me. She was a fleshy,\r\ncoarse woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I should not have called Arabella coarse exactly, except in\r\nspeech, though she may be getting so by this time under the duties of\r\nthe public house. She was rather handsome when I knew her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandsome! But yes!\xe2\x80\x94so she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I heard a quiver in your little mouth. Well, waiving that, as\r\nshe is nothing to me, and virtuously married to another man, why should\r\nshe come troubling us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure she\xe2\x80\x99s married? Have you definite news of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not definite news. But that was why she asked me to release her.\r\nShe and the man both wanted to lead a proper life, as I understood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Jude\xe2\x80\x94it was, it _was_ Arabella!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sue, covering her eyes with\r\nher hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am so miserable! It seems such an ill omen, whatever\r\nshe may have come for. You could not possibly see her, could you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t really think I could. It would be so very painful to talk to\r\nher now\xe2\x80\x94for her as much as for me. However, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Did she say she\r\nwould come again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But she went away very reluctantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue, whom the least thing upset, could not eat any supper, and when\r\nJude had finished his he prepared to go to bed. He had no sooner raked\r\nout the fire, fastened the doors, and got to the top of the stairs than\r\nthere came a knock. Sue instantly emerged from her room, which she had\r\nbut just entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere she is again!\xe2\x80\x9d Sue whispered in appalled accents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe knocked like that last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey listened, and the knocking came again. No servant was kept in the\r\nhouse, and if the summons were to be responded to one of them would\r\nhave to do it in person. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll open a window,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever it\r\nis cannot be expected to be let in at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe accordingly went into his bedroom and lifted the sash. The lonely\r\nstreet of early retiring workpeople was empty from end to end save of\r\none figure\xe2\x80\x94that of a woman walking up and down by the lamp a few yards\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that Mr. Fawley?\xe2\x80\x9d came up from the woman, in a voice which was\r\nunmistakably Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nJude replied that it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sue from the door, with lips apart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, Arabella?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Jude, for disturbing you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella humbly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I called earlier\xe2\x80\x94I wanted particularly to see you to-night, if I\r\ncould. I am in trouble, and have nobody to help me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn trouble, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. An inconvenient sympathy seemed to be rising in\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s breast at the appeal. \xe2\x80\x9cBut aren\xe2\x80\x99t you married?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nArabella hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Jude, I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nafter all. And I am in great difficulty. I hope to get another\r\nsituation as barmaid soon. But it takes time, and I really am in great\r\ndistress because of a sudden responsibility that\xe2\x80\x99s been sprung upon me\r\nfrom Australia; or I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you\xe2\x80\x94believe me I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I want\r\nto tell you about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue remained at gaze, in painful tension, hearing every word, but\r\nspeaking none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not really in want of money, Arabella?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in a\r\ndistinctly softened tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have enough to pay for the night\xe2\x80\x99s lodging I have obtained, but\r\nbarely enough to take me back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn London still.\xe2\x80\x9d She was about to give the address, but she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam afraid somebody may hear, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to call out particulars of\r\nmyself so loud. If you could come down and walk a little way with me\r\ntowards the Prince Inn, where I am staying to-night, I would explain\r\nall. You may as well, for old time\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing! I must do her the kindness of hearing what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, I\r\nsuppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude in much perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cAs she\xe2\x80\x99s going back to-morrow\r\nit can\xe2\x80\x99t make much difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can go and see her to-morrow, Jude! Don\xe2\x80\x99t go now, Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d came\r\nin plaintive accents from the doorway. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is only to entrap you, I\r\nknow it is, as she did before! Don\xe2\x80\x99t go, dear! She is such a\r\nlow-passioned woman\xe2\x80\x94I can see it in her shape, and hear it in her\r\nvoice!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I shall go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to detain me, Sue. God\r\nknows I love her little enough now, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be cruel to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s not your wife!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sue distractedly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are not either, dear, yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but are you going to her? Don\xe2\x80\x99t! Stay at home! Please, please stay\r\nat home, Jude, and not go to her, now she\xe2\x80\x99s not your wife any more than\r\nI!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she is, rather more than you, come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking his\r\nhat determinedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted you to be, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve waited with the\r\npatience of Job, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got anything by my\r\nself-denial. I shall certainly give her something, and hear what it is\r\nshe is so anxious to tell me; no man could do less!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was that in his manner which she knew it would be futile to\r\noppose. She said no more, but, turning to her room as meekly as a\r\nmartyr, heard him go downstairs, unbolt the door, and close it behind\r\nhim. With a woman\xe2\x80\x99s disregard of her dignity when in the presence of\r\nnobody but herself, she also trotted down, sobbing articulately as she\r\nwent. She listened. She knew exactly how far it was to the inn that\r\nArabella had named as her lodging. It would occupy about seven minutes\r\nto get there at an ordinary walking pace; seven to come back again. If\r\nhe did not return in fourteen minutes he would have lingered. She\r\nlooked at the clock. It was twenty-five minutes to eleven. He _might_\r\nenter the inn with Arabella, as they would reach it before closing\r\ntime; she might get him to drink with her; and Heaven only knew what\r\ndisasters would befall him then.\r\n\r\nIn a still suspense she waited on. It seemed as if the whole time had\r\nnearly elapsed when the door was opened again, and Jude appeared.\r\n\r\nSue gave a little ecstatic cry. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I knew I could trust you!\xe2\x80\x94how good\r\nyou are!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t find her anywhere in this street, and I went out in my\r\nslippers only. She has walked on, thinking I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so hard-hearted as\r\nto refuse her requests entirely, poor woman. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come back for my\r\nboots, as it is beginning to rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but why should you take such trouble for a woman who has served\r\nyou so badly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue in a jealous burst of disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Sue, she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman, and I once cared for her; and one can\xe2\x80\x99t be a\r\nbrute in such circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe isn\xe2\x80\x99t your wife any longer!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sue, passionately excited.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou _mustn\xe2\x80\x99t_ go out to find her! It isn\xe2\x80\x99t right! You _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ join\r\nher, now she\xe2\x80\x99s a stranger to you. How can you forget such a thing, my\r\ndear, dear one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe seems much the same as ever\xe2\x80\x94an erring, careless, unreflecting\r\nfellow-creature,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, continuing to pull on his boots. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat those\r\nlegal fellows have been playing at in London makes no difference in my\r\nreal relations to her. If she was my wife while she was away in\r\nAustralia with another husband, she\xe2\x80\x99s my wife now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t! That\xe2\x80\x99s just what I hold! There\xe2\x80\x99s the absurdity!\xe2\x80\x94\r\nWell\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll come straight back, after a few minutes, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, dear?\r\nShe is too low, too coarse for you to talk to long, Jude, and was\r\nalways!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I am coarse too, worse luck! I have the germs of every human\r\ninfirmity in me, I verily believe\xe2\x80\x94that was why I saw it was so\r\npreposterous of me to think of being a curate. I have cured myself of\r\ndrunkenness I think; but I never know in what new form a suppressed\r\nvice will break out in me! I do love you, Sue, though I have danced\r\nattendance on you so long for such poor returns! All that\xe2\x80\x99s best and\r\nnoblest in me loves you, and your freedom from everything that\xe2\x80\x99s gross\r\nhas elevated me, and enabled me to do what I should never have dreamt\r\nmyself capable of, or any man, a year or two ago. It is all very well\r\nto preach about self-control, and the wickedness of coercing a woman.\r\nBut I should just like a few virtuous people who have condemned me in\r\nthe past, about Arabella and other things, to have been in my\r\ntantalizing position with you through these late weeks!\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99d believe,\r\nI think, that I have exercised some little restraint in always giving\r\nin to your wishes\xe2\x80\x94living here in one house, and not a soul between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you have been good to me, Jude; I know you have, my dear\r\nprotector.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94Arabella has appealed to me for help. I must go out and speak to\r\nher, Sue, at least!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say any more!\xe2\x80\x94Oh, if you must, you must!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, bursting\r\nout into sobs that seemed to tear her heart. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nobody but you,\r\nJude, and you are deserting me! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were like this\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bear it, I can\xe2\x80\x99t! If she were yours it would be different!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr if you were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well then\xe2\x80\x94if I must I must. Since you will have it so, I agree! I\r\nwill be. Only I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to! And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry again,\r\neither! \xe2\x80\xa6 But, yes\xe2\x80\x94I agree, I agree! I do love you. I ought to have\r\nknown that you would conquer in the long run, living like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ran across and flung her arms round his neck. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a\r\ncold-natured, sexless creature, am I, for keeping you at such a\r\ndistance? I am sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t think so! Wait and see! I do belong to\r\nyou, don\xe2\x80\x99t I? I give in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll arrange for our marriage to-morrow, or as soon as ever you\r\nwish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Jude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll let her go,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, embracing Sue softly. \xe2\x80\x9cI do feel that\r\nit would be unfair to you to see her, and perhaps unfair to her. She is\r\nnot like you, my darling, and never was: it is only bare justice to say\r\nthat. Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry any more. There; and there; and there!\xe2\x80\x9d He kissed her\r\non one side, and on the other, and in the middle, and rebolted the\r\nfront door.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning it was wet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude gaily at breakfast; \xe2\x80\x9cas this is Saturday I mean\r\nto call about the banns at once, so as to get the first publishing done\r\nto-morrow, or we shall lose a week. Banns will do? We shall save a\r\npound or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue absently agreed to banns. But her mind for the moment was running\r\non something else. A glow had passed away from her, and depression sat\r\nupon her features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel I was wickedly selfish last night!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was sheer\r\nunkindness in me\xe2\x80\x94or worse\xe2\x80\x94to treat Arabella as I did. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nabout her being in trouble, and what she wished to tell you! Perhaps it\r\nwas really something she was justified in telling you. That\xe2\x80\x99s some more\r\nof my badness, I suppose! Love has its own dark morality when rivalry\r\nenters in\xe2\x80\x94at least, mine has, if other people\xe2\x80\x99s hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6 I wonder how\r\nshe got on? I hope she reached the inn all right, poor woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes: she got on all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude placidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t shut out, and that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t to walk the streets in\r\nthe rain. Do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to see if\r\nshe got in? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking of her all the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94is it necessary? You haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea how Arabella is able\r\nto shift for herself. Still, darling, if you want to go and inquire you\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no limit to the strange and unnecessary penances which Sue\r\nwould meekly undertake when in a contrite mood; and this going to see\r\nall sorts of extraordinary persons whose relation to her was precisely\r\nof a kind that would have made other people shun them was her instinct\r\never, so that the request did not surprise him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when you come back,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to go about the\r\nbanns. You\xe2\x80\x99ll come with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue agreed, and went off under cloak and umbrella letting Jude kiss her\r\nfreely, and returning his kisses in a way she had never done before.\r\nTimes had decidedly changed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe little bird is caught at last!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, a sadness showing in her smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94only nested,\xe2\x80\x9d he assured her.\r\n\r\nShe walked along the muddy street till she reached the public house\r\nmentioned by Arabella, which was not so very far off. She was informed\r\nthat Arabella had not yet left, and in doubt how to announce herself so\r\nthat her predecessor in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s affections would recognize her, she sent\r\nup word that a friend from Spring Street had called, naming the place\r\nof Jude\xe2\x80\x99s residence. She was asked to step upstairs, and on being shown\r\ninto a room found that it was Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, and that the latter\r\nhad not yet risen. She halted on the turn of her toe till Arabella\r\ncried from the bed, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in and shut the door,\xe2\x80\x9d which Sue accordingly\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nArabella lay facing the window, and did not at once turn her head: and\r\nSue was wicked enough, despite her penitence, to wish for a moment that\r\nJude could behold her forerunner now, with the daylight full upon her.\r\nShe may have seemed handsome enough in profile under the lamps, but a\r\nfrowsiness was apparent this morning; and the sight of her own fresh\r\ncharms in the looking-glass made Sue\xe2\x80\x99s manner bright, till she\r\nreflected what a meanly sexual emotion this was in her, and hated\r\nherself for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just looked in to see if you got back comfortably last night,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid afterwards that you might\r\nhave met with any mishap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94how stupid this is! I thought my visitor was\xe2\x80\x94your friend\xe2\x80\x94your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Fawley, as I suppose you call yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella,\r\nflinging her head back upon the pillows with a disappointed toss, and\r\nceasing to retain the dimple she had just taken the trouble to produce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I thought you might have, even if he\xe2\x80\x99s not really yours. Decency\r\nis decency, any hour of the twenty-four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue stiffly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is mine, if you\r\ncome to that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue coloured roseate, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom your manner when you talked to me at the door. Well, my dear,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been quick about it, and I expect my visit last night helped it\r\non\xe2\x80\x94ha-ha! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get him away from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue looked out at the rain, and at the dirty toilet-cover, and at the\r\ndetached tail of Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s hair hanging on the looking-glass, just as\r\nit had done in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s time; and wished she had not come. In the pause\r\nthere was a knock at the door, and the chambermaid brought in a\r\ntelegram for \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Cartlett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella opened it as she lay, and her ruffled look disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you for your anxiety about me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said blandly\r\nwhen the maid had gone; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is not necessary you should feel it. My\r\nman finds he can\xe2\x80\x99t do without me after all, and agrees to stand by the\r\npromise to marry again over here that he has made me all along. See\r\nhere! This is in answer to one from me.\xe2\x80\x9d She held out the telegram for\r\nSue to read, but Sue did not take it. \xe2\x80\x9cHe asks me to come back. His\r\nlittle corner public in Lambeth would go to pieces without me, he says.\r\nBut he isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to knock me about when he has had a drop, any more\r\nafter we are spliced by English law than before! \xe2\x80\xa6 As for you, I should\r\ncoax Jude to take me before the parson straight off, and have done with\r\nit, if I were in your place. I say it as a friend, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s waiting to, any day,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sue, with frigid pride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let him, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name. Life with a man is more businesslike\r\nafter it, and money matters work better. And then, you see, if you have\r\nrows, and he turns you out of doors, you can get the law to protect\r\nyou, which you can\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise, unless he half-runs you through with a\r\nknife, or cracks your noddle with a poker. And if he bolts away from\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94I say it friendly, as woman to woman, for there\xe2\x80\x99s never any knowing\r\nwhat a man med do\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the sticks o\xe2\x80\x99 furniture, and won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nlooked upon as a thief. I shall marry my man over again, now he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwilling, as there was a little flaw in the first ceremony. In my\r\ntelegram last night which this is an answer to, I told him I had almost\r\nmade it up with Jude; and that frightened him, I expect! Perhaps I\r\nshould quite have done it if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nlaughing; \xe2\x80\x9cand then how different our histories might have been from\r\nto-day! Never such a tender fool as Jude is if a woman seems in\r\ntrouble, and coaxes him a bit! Just as he used to be about birds and\r\nthings. However, as it happens, it is just as well as if I had made it\r\nup, and I forgive you. And, as I say, I\xe2\x80\x99d advise you to get the\r\nbusiness legally done as soon as possible. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find it an awful\r\nbother later on if you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you he is asking me to marry him\xe2\x80\x94to make our natural\r\nmarriage a legal one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue, with yet more dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was quite\r\nby my wish that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t the moment I was free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes\xe2\x80\x94you are a oneyer too, like myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella, eyeing her\r\nvisitor with humorous criticism. \xe2\x80\x9cBolted from your first, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you,\r\nlike me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning!\xe2\x80\x94I must go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, too, must up and off!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, springing out of bed\r\nso suddenly that the soft parts of her person shook. Sue jumped aside\r\nin trepidation. \xe2\x80\x9cLord, I am only a woman\xe2\x80\x94not a six-foot sojer! \xe2\x80\xa6 Just a\r\nmoment, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, putting her hand on Sue\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI really\r\ndid want to consult Jude on a little matter of business, as I told him.\r\nI came about that more than anything else. Would he run up to speak to\r\nme at the station as I am going? You think not. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to him\r\nabout it. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to write it, but never mind\xe2\x80\x94I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sue reached home Jude was awaiting her at the door to take the\r\ninitial step towards their marriage. She clasped his arm, and they went\r\nalong silently together, as true comrades oft-times do. He saw that she\r\nwas preoccupied, and forbore to question her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Jude\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to her,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t!\r\nAnd yet it is best to be reminded of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she was civil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t help liking her\xe2\x80\x94just a little bit! She\xe2\x80\x99s not an\r\nungenerous nature; and I am so glad her difficulties have all suddenly\r\nended.\xe2\x80\x9d She explained how Arabella had been summoned back, and would be\r\nenabled to retrieve her position. \xe2\x80\x9cI was referring to our old question.\r\nWhat Arabella has been saying to me has made me feel more than ever how\r\nhopelessly vulgar an institution legal marriage is\xe2\x80\x94a sort of trap to\r\ncatch a man\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think of it. I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t promised to\r\nlet you put up the banns this morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me. Any time will do for me. I thought you might like\r\nto get it over quickly, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel any more anxious now than I did before. Perhaps\r\nwith any other man I might be a little anxious; but among the very few\r\nvirtues possessed by your family and mine, dear, I think I may set\r\nstaunchness. So I am not a bit frightened about losing you, now I\r\nreally am yours and you really are mine. In fact, I am easier in my\r\nmind than I was, for my conscience is clear about Richard, who now has\r\na right to his freedom. I felt we were deceiving him before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue, you seem when you are like this to be one of the women of some\r\ngrand old civilization, whom I used to read about in my bygone, wasted,\r\nclassical days, rather than a denizen of a mere Christian country. I\r\nalmost expect you to say at these times that you have just been talking\r\nto some friend whom you met in the Via Sacra, about the latest news of\r\nOctavia or Livia; or have been listening to Aspasia\xe2\x80\x99s eloquence, or\r\nhave been watching Praxiteles chiselling away at his latest Venus,\r\nwhile Phryne made complaint that she was tired of posing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the house of the parish clerk. Sue stood back,\r\nwhile her lover went up to the door. His hand was raised to knock when\r\nshe said: \xe2\x80\x9cJude!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute, would you mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe came back to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust let us think,\xe2\x80\x9d she said timidly. \xe2\x80\x9cI had such a horrid dream one\r\nnight! \xe2\x80\xa6 And Arabella\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Arabella say to you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she said that when people were tied up you could get the law of a\r\nman better if he beat you\xe2\x80\x94and how when couples quarrelled\xe2\x80\xa6 Jude, do you\r\nthink that when you must have me with you by law, we shall be so happy\r\nas we are now? The men and women of our family are very generous when\r\neverything depends upon their goodwill, but they always kick against\r\ncompulsion. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of\r\nlegal obligation? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it is destructive to a passion whose\r\nessence is its gratuitousness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, love, you are beginning to frighten me, too, with all\r\nthis foreboding! Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back and think it over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face brightened. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94so we will!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. And they turned from\r\nthe clerk\xe2\x80\x99s door, Sue taking his arm and murmuring as they walked on\r\nhomeward:\r\n\r\nCan you keep the bee from ranging,\r\nOr the ring-dove\xe2\x80\x99s neck from changing?\r\nNo! Nor fetter\xe2\x80\x99d love\xe2\x80\xa6\r\n\r\nThey thought it over, or postponed thinking. Certainly they postponed\r\naction, and seemed to live on in a dreamy paradise. At the end of a\r\nfortnight or three weeks matters remained unadvanced, and no banns were\r\nannounced to the ears of any Aldbrickham congregation.\r\n\r\nWhilst they were postponing and postponing thus a letter and a\r\nnewspaper arrived before breakfast one morning from Arabella. Seeing\r\nthe handwriting Jude went up to Sue\xe2\x80\x99s room and told her, and as soon as\r\nshe was dressed she hastened down. Sue opened the newspaper; Jude the\r\nletter. After glancing at the paper she held across the first page to\r\nhim with her finger on a paragraph; but he was so absorbed in his\r\nletter that he did not turn awhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nHe looked and read. The paper was one that circulated in South London\r\nonly, and the marked advertisement was simply the announcement of a\r\nmarriage at St. John\xe2\x80\x99s Church, Waterloo Road, under the names,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCARTLETT\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94DONN\xe2\x80\x9d; the united pair being Arabella and the inn-keeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is satisfactory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue complacently. \xe2\x80\x9cThough, after this,\r\nit seems rather low to do likewise, and I am glad. However, she is\r\nprovided for now in a way, I suppose, whatever her faults, poor thing.\r\nIt is nicer that we are able to think that, than to be uneasy about\r\nher. I ought, too, to write to Richard and ask him how he is getting\r\non, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Jude\xe2\x80\x99s attention was still absorbed. Having merely glanced at the\r\nannouncement he said in a disturbed voice: \xe2\x80\x9cListen to this letter. What\r\nshall I say or do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHE THREE HORNS, LAMBETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR JUDE (I won\xe2\x80\x99t be so distant as to call you Mr. Fawley),\xe2\x80\x94I send\r\nto-day a newspaper, from which useful document you will learn that I\r\nwas married over again to Cartlett last Tuesday. So that business is\r\nsettled right and tight at last. But what I write about more particular\r\nis that private affair I wanted to speak to you on when I came down to\r\nAldbrickham. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t very well tell it to your lady friend, and\r\nshould much have liked to let you know it by word of mouth, as I could\r\nhave explained better than by letter. The fact is, Jude, that, though I\r\nhave never informed you before, there was a boy born of our marriage,\r\neight months after I left you, when I was at Sydney, living with my\r\nfather and mother. All that is easily provable. As I had separated from\r\nyou before I thought such a thing was going to happen, and I was over\r\nthere, and our quarrel had been sharp, I did not think it convenient to\r\nwrite about the birth. I was then looking out for a good situation, so\r\nmy parents took the child, and he has been with them ever since. That\r\nwas why I did not mention it when I met you in Christminster, nor at\r\nthe law proceedings. He is now of an intelligent age, of course, and my\r\nmother and father have lately written to say that, as they have rather\r\na hard struggle over there, and I am settled comfortably here, they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see why they should be encumbered with the child any longer, his\r\nparents being alive. I would have him with me here in a moment, but he\r\nis not old enough to be of any use in the bar nor will be for years and\r\nyears, and naturally Cartlett might think him in the way. They have,\r\nhowever, packed him off to me in charge of some friends who happened to\r\nbe coming home, and I must ask you to take him when he arrives, for I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with him. He is lawfully yours, that I solemnly\r\nswear. If anybody says he isn\xe2\x80\x99t, call them brimstone liars, for my\r\nsake. Whatever I may have done before or afterwards, I was honest to\r\nyou from the time we were married till I went away, and I remain,\r\nyours, &c.,\r\n\r\n\r\nARABELLA CARTLETT.\r\n\r\nSue\xe2\x80\x99s look was one of dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nfaintly.\r\n\r\nJude did not reply, and Sue watched him anxiously, with heavy breaths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt hits me hard!\xe2\x80\x9d said he in an under-voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt _may_ be true! I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t make it out. Certainly, if his birth was exactly when she says,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s mine. I cannot think why she didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me when I met her at\r\nChristminster, and came on here that evening with her! \xe2\x80\xa6 Ah\xe2\x80\x94I do\r\nremember now that she said something about having a thing on her mind\r\nthat she would like me to know, if ever we lived together again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor child seems to be wanted by nobody!\xe2\x80\x9d Sue replied, and her\r\neyes filled.\r\n\r\nJude had by this time come to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a view of life he must\r\nhave, mine or not mine!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI must say that, if I were better\r\noff, I should not stop for a moment to think whose he might be. I would\r\ntake him and bring him up. The beggarly question of parentage\xe2\x80\x94what is\r\nit, after all? What does it matter, when you come to think of it,\r\nwhether a child is yours by blood or not? All the little ones of our\r\ntime are collectively the children of us adults of the time, and\r\nentitled to our general care. That excessive regard of parents for\r\ntheir own children, and their dislike of other people\xe2\x80\x99s, is, like\r\nclass-feeling, patriotism, save-your-own-soul-ism, and other virtues, a\r\nmean exclusiveness at bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue jumped up and kissed Jude with passionate devotion. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94so it is,\r\ndearest! And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have him here! And if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t yours it makes it all\r\nthe better. I do hope he isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94though perhaps I ought not to feel quite\r\nthat! If he isn\xe2\x80\x99t, I should like so much for us to have him as an\r\nadopted child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must assume about him what is most pleasing to you, my\r\ncurious little comrade!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel that, anyhow, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nleave the unfortunate little fellow to neglect. Just think of his life\r\nin a Lambeth pothouse, and all its evil influences, with a parent who\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t want him, and has, indeed, hardly seen him, and a stepfather\r\nwho doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know him. \xe2\x80\x98Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the\r\nnight in which it was said, There is a man child conceived!\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat the boy\xe2\x80\x94_my_ boy, perhaps, will find himself saying before long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I was the petitioner, I am really entitled to his custody, I\r\nsuppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether or no, we must have him. I see that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the best I can to\r\nbe a mother to him, and we can afford to keep him somehow. I\xe2\x80\x99ll work\r\nharder. I wonder when he\xe2\x80\x99ll arrive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the course of a few weeks, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish\xe2\x80\x94When shall we have courage to marry, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you have it, I think I shall. It remains with you entirely,\r\ndear. Only say the word, and it\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the boy comes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would make a more natural home for him, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nJude thereupon wrote in purely formal terms to request that the boy\r\nshould be sent on to them as soon as he arrived, making no remark\r\nwhatever on the surprising nature of Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s information, nor\r\nvouchsafing a single word of opinion on the boy\xe2\x80\x99s paternity, nor on\r\nwhether, had he known all this, his conduct towards her would have been\r\nquite the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the down train that was timed to reach Aldbrickham station about ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock the next evening, a small, pale child\xe2\x80\x99s face could be seen in\r\nthe gloom of a third-class carriage. He had large, frightened eyes, and\r\nwore a white woollen cravat, over which a key was suspended round his\r\nneck by a piece of common string: the key attracting attention by its\r\noccasional shine in the lamplight. In the band of his hat his\r\nhalf-ticket was stuck. His eyes remained mostly fixed on the back of\r\nthe seat opposite, and never turned to the window even when a station\r\nwas reached and called. On the other seat were two or three passengers,\r\none of them a working woman who held a basket on her lap, in which was\r\na tabby kitten. The woman opened the cover now and then, whereupon the\r\nkitten would put out its head, and indulge in playful antics. At these\r\nthe fellow-passengers laughed, except the solitary boy bearing the key\r\nand ticket, who, regarding the kitten with his saucer eyes, seemed\r\nmutely to say: \xe2\x80\x9cAll laughing comes from misapprehension. Rightly looked\r\nat, there is no laughable thing under the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOccasionally, at a stoppage, the guard would look into the compartment\r\nand say to the boy, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, my man. Your box is safe in the van.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe boy would say, \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d without animation, would try to smile, and\r\nfail.\r\n\r\nHe was Age masquerading as Juvenility, and doing it so badly that his\r\nreal self showed through crevices. A ground-swell from ancient years of\r\nnight seemed now and then to lift the child in this his morning-life,\r\nwhen his face took a back view over some great Atlantic of Time, and\r\nappeared not to care about what it saw.\r\n\r\nWhen the other travellers closed their eyes, which they did one by\r\none\xe2\x80\x94even the kitten curling itself up in the basket, weary of its too\r\ncircumscribed play\xe2\x80\x94the boy remained just as before. He then seemed to\r\nbe doubly awake, like an enslaved and dwarfed divinity, sitting passive\r\nand regarding his companions as if he saw their whole rounded lives\r\nrather than their immediate figures.\r\n\r\nThis was Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s boy. With her usual carelessness, she had postponed\r\nwriting to Jude about him till the eve of his landing, when she could\r\nabsolutely postpone no longer, though she had known for weeks of his\r\napproaching arrival, and had, as she truly said, visited Aldbrickham\r\nmainly to reveal the boy\xe2\x80\x99s existence and his near home-coming to Jude.\r\nThis very day on which she had received her former husband\xe2\x80\x99s answer at\r\nsome time in the afternoon, the child reached the London Docks, and the\r\nfamily in whose charge he had come, having put him into a cab for\r\nLambeth and directed the cabman to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, bade him\r\ngood-bye, and went their way.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at the Three Horns, Arabella had looked him over with an\r\nexpression that was as good as saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very much what I\r\nexpected you to be,\xe2\x80\x9d had given him a good meal, a little money, and,\r\nlate as it was getting, dispatched him to Jude by the next train,\r\nwishing her husband Cartlett, who was out, not to see him.\r\n\r\nThe train reached Aldbrickham, and the boy was deposited on the lonely\r\nplatform beside his box. The collector took his ticket, and, with a\r\nmeditative sense of the unfitness of things, asked him where he was\r\ngoing by himself at that time of night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to Spring Street,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little one impassively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s a long way from here; a\xe2\x80\x99most out in the country; and the\r\nfolks will be gone to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have a fly for your box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I must walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well: you\xe2\x80\x99d better leave your box here and send for it. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98bus goes half-way, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to walk the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t your friends come to meet \xe2\x80\x99ee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is your friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish me to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I can do, then, is to take charge of this. Now walk as fast as you\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaying nothing further the boy came out into the street, looking round\r\nto see that nobody followed or observed him. When he had walked some\r\nlittle distance he asked for the street of his destination. He was told\r\nto go straight on quite into the outskirts of the place.\r\n\r\nThe child fell into a steady mechanical creep which had in it an\r\nimpersonal quality\xe2\x80\x94the movement of the wave, or of the breeze, or of\r\nthe cloud. He followed his directions literally, without an inquiring\r\ngaze at anything. It could have been seen that the boy\xe2\x80\x99s ideas of life\r\nwere different from those of the local boys. Children begin with\r\ndetail, and learn up to the general; they begin with the contiguous,\r\nand gradually comprehend the universal. The boy seemed to have begun\r\nwith the generals of life, and never to have concerned himself with the\r\nparticulars. To him the houses, the willows, the obscure fields beyond,\r\nwere apparently regarded not as brick residences, pollards, meadows;\r\nbut as human dwellings in the abstract, vegetation, and the wide dark\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHe found the way to the little lane, and knocked at the door of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. Jude had just retired to bed, and Sue was about to enter her\r\nchamber adjoining when she heard the knock and came down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this where Father lives?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Fawley, that\xe2\x80\x99s his name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue ran up to Jude\xe2\x80\x99s room and told him, and he hurried down as soon as\r\nhe could, though to her impatience he seemed long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94is it he\xe2\x80\x94so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked as Jude came.\r\n\r\nShe scrutinized the child\xe2\x80\x99s features, and suddenly went away into the\r\nlittle sitting-room adjoining. Jude lifted the boy to a level with\r\nhimself, keenly regarded him with gloomy tenderness, and telling him he\r\nwould have been met if they had known of his coming so soon, set him\r\nprovisionally in a chair whilst he went to look for Sue, whose\r\nsupersensitiveness was disturbed, as he knew. He found her in the dark,\r\nbending over an arm-chair. He enclosed her with his arm, and putting\r\nhis face by hers, whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Arabella says is true\xe2\x80\x94true! I see you in him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell: that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing in my life as it should be, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the other half of him is\xe2\x80\x94_she_! And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear! But\r\nI ought to\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get used to it; yes, I ought!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJealous little Sue! I withdraw all remarks about your sexlessness.\r\nNever mind! Time may right things\xe2\x80\xa6 And Sue, darling; I have an idea!\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll educate and train him with a view to the university. What I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish in my own person perhaps I can carry out through\r\nhim? They are making it easier for poor students now, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you dreamer!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, and holding his hand returned to the child\r\nwith him. The boy looked at her as she had looked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it you\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s my _real_ mother at last?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Do I look like your father\xe2\x80\x99s wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes; \xe2\x80\x99cept he seems fond of you, and you of him. Can I call you\r\nMother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen a yearning look came over the child and he began to cry. Sue\r\nthereupon could not refrain from instantly doing likewise, being a harp\r\nwhich the least wind of emotion from another\xe2\x80\x99s heart could make to\r\nvibrate as readily as a radical stir in her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may call me Mother, if you wish to, my poor dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nbending her cheek against his to hide her tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this round your neck?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jude with affected calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe key of my box that\xe2\x80\x99s at the station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey bustled about and got him some supper, and made him up a temporary\r\nbed, where he soon fell asleep. Both went and looked at him as he lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe called you Mother two or three times before he dropped off,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmurmured Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it odd that he should have wanted to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94it was significant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s more for us to think\r\nabout in that one little hungry heart than in all the stars of the sky\xe2\x80\xa6\r\nI suppose, dear, we must pluck up courage, and get that ceremony over?\r\nIt is no use struggling against the current, and I feel myself getting\r\nintertwined with my kind. Oh Jude, you\xe2\x80\x99ll love me dearly, won\xe2\x80\x99t you,\r\nafterwards? I do want to be kind to this child, and to be a mother to\r\nhim; and our adding the legal form to our marriage might make it easier\r\nfor me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir next and second attempt thereat was more deliberately made,\r\nthough it was begun on the morning following the singular child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival at their home.\r\n\r\nHim they found to be in the habit of sitting silent, his quaint and\r\nweird face set, and his eyes resting on things they did not see in the\r\nsubstantial world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis face is like the tragic mask of Melpomene,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\r\nyour name, dear? Did you tell us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Father Time is what they always called me. It is a nickname;\r\nbecause I look so aged, they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you talk so, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is strange, Jude, that\r\nthese preternaturally old boys almost always come from new countries.\r\nBut what were you christened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, if I died in damnation, \xe2\x80\x99twould save the expense of a\r\nChristian funeral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94your name is not Jude, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said his father with some\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nThe boy shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNever heerd on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue quickly; \xe2\x80\x9csince she was hating you all the\r\ntime!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have him christened,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude; and privately to Sue: \xe2\x80\x9cThe day\r\nwe are married.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet the advent of the child disturbed him.\r\n\r\nTheir position lent them shyness, and having an impression that a\r\nmarriage at a superintendent registrar\xe2\x80\x99s office was more private than\r\nan ecclesiastical one, they decided to avoid a church this time. Both\r\nSue and Jude together went to the office of the district to give\r\nnotice: they had become such companions that they could hardly do\r\nanything of importance except in each other\xe2\x80\x99s company.\r\n\r\nJude Fawley signed the form of notice, Sue looking over his shoulder\r\nand watching his hand as it traced the words. As she read the\r\nfour-square undertaking, never before seen by her, into which her own\r\nand Jude\xe2\x80\x99s names were inserted, and by which that very volatile\r\nessence, their love for each other, was supposed to be made permanent,\r\nher face seemed to grow painfully apprehensive. \xe2\x80\x9cNames and Surnames of\r\nthe Parties\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(they were to be parties now, not lovers, she thought).\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCondition\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(a horrid idea)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cRank or Occupation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAge\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDwelling\r\nat\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLength of Residence\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cChurch or Building in which the Marriage is\r\nto be solemnized\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDistrict and County in which the Parties\r\nrespectively dwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt spoils the sentiment, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said on their way home. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nseems making a more sordid business of it even than signing the\r\ncontract in a vestry. There is a little poetry in a church. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntry to get through with it, dearest, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will. \xe2\x80\x98For what man is he that hath betrothed a wife and hath not\r\ntaken her? Let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the\r\nbattle, and another man take her.\xe2\x80\x99 So said the Jewish law-giver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you know the Scriptures, Jude! You really ought to have been a\r\nparson. I can only quote profane writers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring the interval before the issuing of the certificate, Sue, in her\r\nhousekeeping errands, sometimes walked past the office, and furtively\r\nglancing in saw affixed to the wall the notice of the purposed clinch\r\nto their union. She could not bear its aspect. Coming after her\r\nprevious experience of matrimony, all the romance of their attachment\r\nseemed to be starved away by placing her present case in the same\r\ncategory. She was usually leading little Father Time by the hand, and\r\nfancied that people thought him hers, and regarded the intended\r\nceremony as the patching up of an old error.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jude decided to link his present with his past in some slight\r\ndegree by inviting to the wedding the only person remaining on earth\r\nwho was associated with his early life at Marygreen\xe2\x80\x94the aged widow Mrs.\r\nEdlin, who had been his great-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s friend and nurse in her last\r\nillness. He hardly expected that she would come; but she did, bringing\r\nsingular presents, in the form of apples, jam, brass snuffers, an\r\nancient pewter dish, a warming-pan, and an enormous bag of goose\r\nfeathers towards a bed. She was allotted the spare room in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, whither she retired early, and where they could hear her through\r\nthe ceiling below, honestly saying the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer in a loud voice,\r\nas the Rubric directed.\r\n\r\nAs, however, she could not sleep, and discovered that Sue and Jude were\r\nstill sitting up\xe2\x80\x94it being in fact only ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94she dressed herself\r\nagain and came down, and they all sat by the fire till a late\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x94Father Time included; though, as he never spoke, they were hardly\r\nconscious of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I bain\xe2\x80\x99t set against marrying as your great-aunt was,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nwidow. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I hope \xe2\x80\x99twill be a jocund wedding for ye in all respects\r\nthis time. Nobody can hope it more, knowing what I do of your families,\r\nwhich is more, I suppose, than anybody else now living. For they have\r\nbeen unlucky that way, God knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue breathed uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey was always good-hearted people, too\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill a fly if they\r\nknowed it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the wedding guest. \xe2\x80\x9cBut things happened to thwart\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, and if everything wasn\xe2\x80\x99t vitty they were upset. No doubt that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhow he that the tale is told of came to do what \xe2\x80\x99a did\xe2\x80\x94if he _were_ one\r\nof your family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94that tale, ye know; he that was gibbeted just on the brow of the\r\nhill by the Brown House\xe2\x80\x94not far from the milestone between Marygreen\r\nand Alfredston, where the other road branches off. But Lord, \xe2\x80\x99twas in\r\nmy grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s time; and it medn\xe2\x80\x99 have been one of your folk at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know where the gibbet is said to have stood, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured\r\nJude. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I never heard of this. What\xe2\x80\x94did this man\xe2\x80\x94my ancestor and\r\nSue\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94kill his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twer not that exactly. She ran away from him, with their child, to\r\nher friends; and while she was there the child died. He wanted the\r\nbody, to bury it where his people lay, but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give it up. Her\r\nhusband then came in the night with a cart, and broke into the house to\r\nsteal the coffin away; but he was catched, and being obstinate,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell what he broke in for. They brought it in burglary, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s why he was hanged and gibbeted on Brown House Hill. His wife\r\nwent mad after he was dead. But it medn\xe2\x80\x99t be true that he belonged to\r\nye more than to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA small slow voice rose from the shade of the fireside, as if out of\r\nthe earth: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was you, Mother, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry Father!\xe2\x80\x9d It came\r\nfrom little Time, and they started, for they had forgotten him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is only a tale,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue cheeringly.\r\n\r\nAfter this exhilarating tradition from the widow on the eve of the\r\nsolemnization they rose, and, wishing their guest good-night, retired.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Sue, whose nervousness intensified with the hours,\r\ntook Jude privately into the sitting-room before starting. \xe2\x80\x9cJude, I\r\nwant you to kiss me, as a lover, incorporeally,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, tremulously\r\nnestling up to him, with damp lashes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be ever like this any\r\nmore, will it? I wish we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t begun the business. But I suppose we\r\nmust go on. How horrid that story was last night! It spoilt my thoughts\r\nof to-day. It makes me feel as if a tragic doom overhung our family, as\r\nit did the house of Atreus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr the house of Jeroboam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the quondam theologian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And it seems awful temerity in us two to go marrying! I am going\r\nto vow to you in the same words I vowed in to my other husband, and you\r\nto me in the same as you used to your other wife; regardless of the\r\ndeterrent lesson we were taught by those experiments!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are uneasy I am made unhappy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI had hoped you would\r\nfeel quite joyful. But if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you don\xe2\x80\x99t. It is no use\r\npretending. It is a dismal business to you, and that makes it so to\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unpleasantly like that other morning\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go on now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey started arm in arm for the office aforesaid, no witness\r\naccompanying them except the Widow Edlin. The day was chilly and dull,\r\nand a clammy fog blew through the town from \xe2\x80\x9cRoyal-tower\xe2\x80\x99d Thame.\xe2\x80\x9d On\r\nthe steps of the office there were the muddy foot-marks of people who\r\nhad entered, and in the entry were damp umbrellas. Within the office\r\nseveral persons were gathered, and our couple perceived that a marriage\r\nbetween a soldier and a young woman was just in progress. Sue, Jude,\r\nand the widow stood in the background while this was going on, Sue\r\nreading the notices of marriage on the wall. The room was a dreary\r\nplace to two of their temperament, though to its usual frequenters it\r\ndoubtless seemed ordinary enough. Law-books in musty calf covered one\r\nwall, and elsewhere were post-office directories, and other books of\r\nreference. Papers in packets tied with red tape were pigeon-holed\r\naround, and some iron safes filled a recess, while the bare wood floor\r\nwas, like the door-step, stained by previous visitors.\r\n\r\nThe soldier was sullen and reluctant: the bride sad and timid; she was\r\nsoon, obviously, to become a mother, and she had a black eye. Their\r\nlittle business was soon done, and the twain and their friends\r\nstraggled out, one of the witnesses saying casually to Jude and Sue in\r\npassing, as if he had known them before: \xe2\x80\x9cSee the couple just come in?\r\nHa, ha! That fellow is just out of gaol this morning. She met him at\r\nthe gaol gates, and brought him straight here. She\xe2\x80\x99s paying for\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue turned her head and saw an ill-favoured man, closely cropped, with\r\na broad-faced, pock-marked woman on his arm, ruddy with liquor and the\r\nsatisfaction of being on the brink of a gratified desire. They jocosely\r\nsaluted the outgoing couple, and went forward in front of Jude and Sue,\r\nwhose diffidence was increasing. The latter drew back and turned to her\r\nlover, her mouth shaping itself like that of a child about to give way\r\nto grief:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJude\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it here! I wish we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come! The place gives me\r\nthe horrors: it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love! I wish it\r\nhad been at church, if it had to be at all. It is not so vulgar there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear little girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cHow troubled and pale you look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be performed here now, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94perhaps not necessarily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke to the clerk, and came back. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94we need not marry here or\r\nanywhere, unless we like, even now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can be married in a\r\nchurch, if not with the same certificate with another he\xe2\x80\x99ll give us, I\r\nthink. Anyhow, let us go out till you are calmer, dear, and I too, and\r\ntalk it over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went out stealthily and guiltily, as if they had committed a\r\nmisdemeanour, closing the door without noise, and telling the widow,\r\nwho had remained in the entry, to go home and await them; that they\r\nwould call in any casual passers as witnesses, if necessary. When in\r\nthe street they turned into an unfrequented side alley where they\r\nwalked up and down as they had done long ago in the market-house at\r\nMelchester.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, darling, what shall we do? We are making a mess of it, it strikes\r\nme. Still, _anything_ that pleases you will please me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Jude, dearest, I am worrying you! You wanted it to be there,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to tell the truth, when I got inside I felt as if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nmuch about it. The place depressed me almost as much as it did you\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas ugly. And then I thought of what you had said this morning as to\r\nwhether we ought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked on vaguely, till she paused, and her little voice began\r\nanew: \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems so weak, too, to vacillate like this! And yet how much\r\nbetter than to act rashly a second time\xe2\x80\xa6 How terrible that scene was to\r\nme! The expression in that flabby woman\xe2\x80\x99s face, leading her on to give\r\nherself to that gaol-bird, not for a few hours, as she would, but for a\r\nlifetime, as she must. And the other poor soul\xe2\x80\x94to escape a nominal\r\nshame which was owing to the weakness of her character, degrading\r\nherself to the real shame of bondage to a tyrant who scorned her\xe2\x80\x94a man\r\nwhom to avoid for ever was her only chance of salvation\xe2\x80\xa6 This is our\r\nparish church, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? This is where it would have to be, if we did\r\nit in the usual way? A service or something seems to be going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude went up and looked in at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94it is a wedding here too,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody seems to be on our tack to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue said she supposed it was because Lent was just over, when there was\r\nalways a crowd of marriages. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us listen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand find how\r\nit feels to us when performed in a church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stepped in, and entered a back seat, and watched the proceedings\r\nat the altar. The contracting couple appeared to belong to the\r\nwell-to-do middle class, and the wedding altogether was of ordinary\r\nprettiness and interest. They could see the flowers tremble in the\r\nbride\xe2\x80\x99s hand, even at that distance, and could hear her mechanical\r\nmurmur of words whose meaning her brain seemed to gather not at all\r\nunder the pressure of her self-consciousness. Sue and Jude listened,\r\nand severally saw themselves in time past going through the same form\r\nof self-committal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the same to her, poor thing, as it would be to me doing it\r\nover again with my present knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d Sue whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, they\r\nare fresh to it, and take the proceedings as a matter of course. But\r\nhaving been awakened to its awful solemnity as we have, or at least as\r\nI have, by experience, and to my own too squeamish feelings perhaps\r\nsometimes, it really does seem immoral in me to go and undertake the\r\nsame thing again with open eyes. Coming in here and seeing this has\r\nfrightened me from a church wedding as much as the other did from a\r\nregistry one\xe2\x80\xa6 We are a weak, tremulous pair, Jude, and what others may\r\nfeel confident in I feel doubts of\xe2\x80\x94my being proof against the sordid\r\nconditions of a business contract again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they tried to laugh, and went on debating in whispers the\r\nobject-lesson before them. And Jude said he also thought they were both\r\ntoo thin-skinned\xe2\x80\x94that they ought never to have been born\xe2\x80\x94much less have\r\ncome together for the most preposterous of all joint ventures for\r\n_them_\xe2\x80\x94matrimony.\r\n\r\nHis betrothed shuddered; and asked him earnestly if he indeed felt that\r\nthey ought not to go in cold blood and sign that life-undertaking\r\nagain? \xe2\x80\x9cIt is awful if you think we have found ourselves not strong\r\nenough for it, and knowing this, are proposing to perjure ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy I do think it\xe2\x80\x94since you ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nit if you wish, own darling.\xe2\x80\x9d While she hesitated he went on to confess\r\nthat, though he thought they ought to be able to do it, he felt checked\r\nby the dread of incompetency just as she did\xe2\x80\x94from their peculiarities,\r\nperhaps, because they were unlike other people. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are horribly\r\nsensitive; that\xe2\x80\x99s really what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with us, Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy more are like us than we think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. The intention of the contract is good, and right\r\nfor many, no doubt; but in our case it may defeat its own ends because\r\nwe are the queer sort of people we are\xe2\x80\x94folk in whom domestic ties of a\r\nforced kind snuff out cordiality and spontaneousness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue still held that there was not much queer or exceptional in them:\r\nthat all were so. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody is getting to feel as we do. We are a\r\nlittle beforehand, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. In fifty, a hundred, years the\r\ndescendants of these two will act and feel worse than we. They will see\r\nweltering humanity still more vividly than we do now, as\r\n\r\nShapes like our own selves hideously multiplied,\r\n\r\nand will be afraid to reproduce them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a terrible line of poetry! \xe2\x80\xa6 though I have felt it myself about\r\nmy fellow-creatures, at morbid times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they murmured on, till Sue said more brightly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94the general question is not our business, and why should we\r\nplague ourselves about it? However different our reasons are, we come\r\nto the same conclusion: that for us particular two, an irrevocable oath\r\nis risky. Then, Jude, let us go home without killing our dream! Yes?\r\nHow good you are, my friend: you give way to all my whims!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey accord very much with my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave her a little kiss behind a pillar while the attention of\r\neverybody present was taken up in observing the bridal procession\r\nentering the vestry; and then they came outside the building. By the\r\ndoor they waited till two or three carriages, which had gone away for a\r\nwhile, returned, and the new husband and wife came into the open\r\ndaylight. Sue sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe flowers in the bride\xe2\x80\x99s hand are sadly like the garland which\r\ndecked the heifers of sacrifice in old times!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, Sue, it is no worse for the woman than for the man. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nsome women fail to see, and instead of protesting against the\r\nconditions they protest against the man, the other victim; just as a\r\nwoman in a crowd will abuse the man who crushes against her, when he is\r\nonly the helpless transmitter of the pressure put upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94some are like that, instead of uniting with the man against the\r\ncommon enemy, coercion.\xe2\x80\x9d The bride and bridegroom had by this time\r\ndriven off, and the two moved away with the rest of the idlers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s do it,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least, just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey reached home, and passing the window arm in arm saw the widow\r\nlooking out at them. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d cried their guest when they entered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsaid to myself when I zeed ye coming so loving up to the door, \xe2\x80\x98They\r\nmade up their minds at last, then!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey briefly hinted that they had not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94and ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t ye really done it? Chok\xe2\x80\x99 it all, that I should have\r\nlived to see a good old saying like \xe2\x80\x98marry in haste and repent at\r\nleisure\xe2\x80\x99 spoiled like this by you two! \xe2\x80\x99Tis time I got back again to\r\nMarygreen\xe2\x80\x94sakes if tidden\xe2\x80\x94if this is what the new notions be leading us\r\nto! Nobody thought o\xe2\x80\x99 being afeard o\xe2\x80\x99 matrimony in my time, nor of much\r\nelse but a cannon-ball or empty cupboard! Why when I and my poor man\r\nwere married we thought no more o\xe2\x80\x99t than of a game o\xe2\x80\x99 dibs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell the child when he comes in,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Sue nervously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll think it has all gone on right, and it will be better that he\r\nshould not be surprised and puzzled. Of course it is only put off for\r\nreconsideration. If we are happy as we are, what does it matter to\r\nanybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a chronicler of moods and deeds does not require him to\r\nexpress his personal views upon the grave controversy above given. That\r\nthe twain were happy\xe2\x80\x94between their times of sadness\xe2\x80\x94was indubitable.\r\nAnd when the unexpected apparition of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s child in the house had\r\nshown itself to be no such disturbing event as it had looked, but one\r\nthat brought into their lives a new and tender interest of an ennobling\r\nand unselfish kind, it rather helped than injured their happiness.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, with such pleasing anxious beings as they were, the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoming also brought with it much thought for the future, particularly\r\nas he seemed at present to be singularly deficient in all the usual\r\nhopes of childhood. But the pair tried to dismiss, for a while at\r\nleast, a too strenuously forward view.\r\n\r\nThere is in Upper Wessex an old town of nine or ten thousand souls; the\r\ntown may be called Stoke-Barehills. It stands with its gaunt,\r\nunattractive, ancient church, and its new red brick suburb, amid the\r\nopen, chalk-soiled cornlands, near the middle of an imaginary triangle\r\nwhich has for its three corners the towns of Aldbrickham and\r\nWintoncester, and the important military station of Quartershot. The\r\ngreat western highway from London passes through it, near a point where\r\nthe road branches into two, merely to unite again some twenty miles\r\nfurther westward. Out of this bifurcation and reunion there used to\r\narise among wheeled travellers, before railway days, endless questions\r\nof choice between the respective ways. But the question is now as dead\r\nas the scot-and-lot freeholder, the road waggoner, and the mail\r\ncoachman who disputed it; and probably not a single inhabitant of\r\nStoke-Barehills is now even aware that the two roads which part in his\r\ntown ever meet again; for nobody now drives up and down the great\r\nwestern highway dally.\r\n\r\nThe most familiar object in Stoke-Barehills nowadays is its cemetery,\r\nstanding among some picturesque medi\xc3\xa6val ruins beside the railway; the\r\nmodern chapels, modern tombs, and modern shrubs having a look of\r\nintrusiveness amid the crumbling and ivy-covered decay of the ancient\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nOn a certain day, however, in the particular year which has now been\r\nreached by this narrative\xe2\x80\x94the month being early June\xe2\x80\x94the features of\r\nthe town excite little interest, though many visitors arrive by the\r\ntrains; some down-trains, in especial, nearly emptying themselves here.\r\nIt is the week of the Great Wessex Agricultural Show, whose vast\r\nencampment spreads over the open outskirts of the town like the tents\r\nof an investing army. Rows of marquees, huts, booths, pavilions,\r\narcades, porticoes\xe2\x80\x94every kind of structure short of a permanent\r\none\xe2\x80\x94cover the green field for the space of a square half-mile, and the\r\ncrowds of arrivals walk through the town in a mass, and make straight\r\nfor the exhibition ground. The way thereto is lined with shows, stalls,\r\nand hawkers on foot, who make a market-place of the whole roadway to\r\nthe show proper, and lead some of the improvident to lighten their\r\npockets appreciably before they reach the gates of the exhibition they\r\ncame expressly to see.\r\n\r\nIt is the popular day, the shilling day, and of the fast arriving\r\nexcursion trains two from different directions enter the two contiguous\r\nrailway stations at almost the same minute. One, like several which\r\nhave preceded it, comes from London: the other by a cross-line from\r\nAldbrickham; and from the London train alights a couple; a short,\r\nrather bloated man, with a globular stomach and small legs, resembling\r\na top on two pegs, accompanied by a woman of rather fine figure and\r\nrather red face, dressed in black material, and covered with beads from\r\nbonnet to skirt, that made her glisten as if clad in chain-mail.\r\n\r\nThey cast their eyes around. The man was about to hire a fly as some\r\nothers had done, when the woman said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be in such a hurry,\r\nCartlett. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t so very far to the show-yard. Let us walk down the\r\nstreet into the place. Perhaps I can pick up a cheap bit of furniture\r\nor old china. It is years since I was here\xe2\x80\x94never since I lived as a\r\ngirl at Aldbrickham, and used to come across for a trip sometimes with\r\nmy young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t carry home furniture by excursion train,\xe2\x80\x9d said, in a thick\r\nvoice, her husband, the landlord of The Three Horns, Lambeth; for they\r\nhad both come down from the tavern in that \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent, densely\r\npopulated, gin-drinking neighbourhood,\xe2\x80\x9d which they had occupied ever\r\nsince the advertisement in those words had attracted them thither. The\r\nconfiguration of the landlord showed that he, too, like his customers,\r\nwas becoming affected by the liquors he retailed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it sent, if I see any worth having,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife.\r\n\r\nThey sauntered on, but had barely entered the town when her attention\r\nwas attracted by a young couple leading a child, who had come out from\r\nthe second platform, into which the train from Aldbrickham had steamed.\r\nThey were walking just in front of the inn-keepers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSakes alive!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cartlett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho do you think that couple is? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you recognize the man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot from the photos I have showed you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Fawley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well. I suppose he was inclined for a little sight-seeing like the\r\nrest of us.\xe2\x80\x9d Cartlett\xe2\x80\x99s interest in Jude whatever it might have been\r\nwhen Arabella was new to him, had plainly flagged since her charms and\r\nher idiosyncrasies, her supernumerary hair-coils, and her optional\r\ndimples, were becoming as a tale that is told.\r\n\r\nArabella so regulated her pace and her husband\xe2\x80\x99s as to keep just in the\r\nrear of the other three, which it was easy to do without notice in such\r\na stream of pedestrians. Her answers to Cartlett\xe2\x80\x99s remarks were vague\r\nand slight, for the group in front interested her more than all the\r\nrest of the spectacle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are rather fond of one another and of their child, seemingly,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the publican.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Their_ child! \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t their child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella with a curious,\r\nsudden covetousness. \xe2\x80\x9cThey haven\xe2\x80\x99t been married long enough for it to\r\nbe theirs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut although the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough in her\r\nto lead her to quash her husband\xe2\x80\x99s conjecture, she was not disposed on\r\nsecond thoughts to be more candid than necessary. Mr. Cartlett had no\r\nother idea than that his wife\xe2\x80\x99s child by her first husband was with his\r\ngrandparents at the Antipodes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I suppose not. She looks quite a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are only lovers, or lately married, and have the child in charge,\r\nas anybody can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll continued to move ahead. The unwitting Sue and Jude, the couple in\r\nquestion, had determined to make this agricultural exhibition within\r\ntwenty miles of their own town the occasion of a day\xe2\x80\x99s excursion which\r\nshould combine exercise and amusement with instruction, at small\r\nexpense. Not regardful of themselves alone, they had taken care to\r\nbring Father Time, to try every means of making him kindle and laugh\r\nlike other boys, though he was to some extent a hindrance to the\r\ndelightfully unreserved intercourse in their pilgrimages which they so\r\nmuch enjoyed. But they soon ceased to consider him an observer, and\r\nwent along with that tender attention to each other which the shyest\r\ncan scarcely disguise, and which these, among entire strangers as they\r\nimagined, took less trouble to disguise than they might have done at\r\nhome. Sue, in her new summer clothes, flexible and light as a bird, her\r\nlittle thumb stuck up by the stem of her white cotton sunshade, went\r\nalong as if she hardly touched ground, and as if a moderately strong\r\npuff of wind would float her over the hedge into the next field. Jude,\r\nin his light grey holiday-suit, was really proud of her companionship,\r\nnot more for her external attractiveness than for her sympathetic words\r\nand ways. That complete mutual understanding, in which every glance and\r\nmovement was as effectual as speech for conveying intelligence between\r\nthem, made them almost the two parts of a single whole.\r\n\r\nThe pair with their charge passed through the turnstiles, Arabella and\r\nher husband not far behind them. When inside the enclosure the\r\npublican\xe2\x80\x99s wife could see that the two ahead began to take trouble with\r\nthe youngster, pointing out and explaining the many objects of\r\ninterest, alive and dead; and a passing sadness would touch their faces\r\nat their every failure to disturb his indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow she sticks to him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94I fancy they are not\r\nmarried, or they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so much to one another as that\xe2\x80\xa6 I wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you said he did marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard he was going to\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all, going to make another attempt,\r\nafter putting it off once or twice\xe2\x80\xa6 As far as they themselves are\r\nconcerned they are the only two in the show. I should be ashamed of\r\nmaking myself so silly if I were he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see as how there\xe2\x80\x99s anything remarkable in their behaviour. I\r\nshould never have noticed their being in love, if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never see anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined. Nevertheless Cartlett\xe2\x80\x99s view of\r\nthe lovers\xe2\x80\x99 or married pair\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was undoubtedly that of the\r\ngeneral crowd, whose attention seemed to be in no way attracted by what\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s sharpened vision discerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s charmed by her as if she were some fairy!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Arabella.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how he looks round at her, and lets his eyes rest on her. I am\r\ninclined to think that she don\xe2\x80\x99t care for him quite so much as he does\r\nfor her. She\xe2\x80\x99s not a particular warm-hearted creature to my thinking,\r\nthough she cares for him pretty middling much\xe2\x80\x94as much as she\xe2\x80\x99s able to;\r\nand he could make her heart ache a bit if he liked to try\xe2\x80\x94which he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo simple to do. There\xe2\x80\x94now they are going across to the cart-horse\r\nsheds. Come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see the cart-horses. It is no business of ours to\r\nfollow these two. If we have come to see the show let us see it in our\r\nown way, as they do in theirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94suppose we agree to meet somewhere in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time\xe2\x80\x94say at that\r\nrefreshment tent over there, and go about independent? Then you can\r\nlook at what you choose to, and so can I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCartlett was not loath to agree to this, and they parted\xe2\x80\x94he proceeding\r\nto the shed where malting processes were being exhibited, and Arabella\r\nin the direction taken by Jude and Sue. Before, however, she had\r\nregained their wake a laughing face met her own, and she was confronted\r\nby Anny, the friend of her girlhood.\r\n\r\nAnny had burst out in hearty laughter at the mere fact of the chance\r\nencounter. \xe2\x80\x9cI am still living down there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as soon as she was\r\ncomposed. \xe2\x80\x9cI am soon going to be married, but my intended couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nup here to-day. But there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of us come by excursion, though I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlost the rest of \xe2\x80\x99em for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you met Jude and his young woman, or wife, or whatever she is? I\r\nsaw \xe2\x80\x99em by now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Not a glimpse of un for years!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they are close by here somewhere. Yes\xe2\x80\x94there they are\xe2\x80\x94by that\r\ngrey horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s his present young woman\xe2\x80\x94wife did you say? Has he married\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s pretty, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94nothing to complain of; or jump at. Not much to depend on, though;\r\na slim, fidgety little thing like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a nice-looking chap, too! You ought to ha\xe2\x80\x99 stuck to un,\r\nArabella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know but I ought,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she.\r\n\r\nAnny laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s you, Arabella! Always wanting another man than\r\nyour own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what woman don\xe2\x80\x99t I should like to know? As for that body\r\nwith him\xe2\x80\x94she don\xe2\x80\x99t know what love is\xe2\x80\x94at least what I call love! I can\r\nsee in her face she don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd perhaps, Abby dear, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she calls love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to! \xe2\x80\xa6 Ah\xe2\x80\x94they are making for the art department.\r\nI should like to see some pictures myself. Suppose we go that way?\xe2\x80\x94\r\nWhy, if all Wessex isn\xe2\x80\x99t here, I verily believe! There\xe2\x80\x99s Dr. Vilbert.\r\nHaven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him for years, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not looking a day older than when\r\nI used to know him. How do you do, Physician? I was just saying that\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t look a day older than when you knew me as a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply the result of taking my own pills regular, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Only two and\r\nthreepence a box\xe2\x80\x94warranted efficacious by the Government stamp. Now let\r\nme advise you to purchase the same immunity from the ravages of time by\r\nfollowing my example? Only two-and-three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe physician had produced a box from his waistcoat pocket, and\r\nArabella was induced to make the purchase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, when the pills were paid for, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nhave the advantage of me, Mrs.\xe2\x80\x94 Surely not Mrs. Fawley, once Miss Donn,\r\nof the vicinity of Marygreen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But Mrs. Cartlett now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94you lost him, then? Promising young fellow! A pupil of mine, you\r\nknow. I taught him the dead languages. And believe me, he soon knew\r\nnearly as much as I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lost him; but not as you think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lawyers\r\nuntied us. There he is, look, alive and lusty; along with that young\r\nwoman, entering the art exhibition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94dear me! Fond of her, apparently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey _say_ they are cousins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousinship is a great convenience to their feelings, I should say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. So her husband thought, no doubt, when he divorced her\xe2\x80\xa6 Shall we\r\nlook at the pictures, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trio followed across the green and entered. Jude and Sue, with the\r\nchild, unaware of the interest they were exciting, had gone up to a\r\nmodel at one end of the building, which they regarded with considerable\r\nattention for a long while before they went on. Arabella and her\r\nfriends came to it in due course, and the inscription it bore was:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cModel of Cardinal College, Christminster; by J. Fawley and S. F. M.\r\nBridehead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmiring their own work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cHow like Jude\xe2\x80\x94always\r\nthinking of colleges and Christminster, instead of attending to his\r\nbusiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey glanced cursorily at the pictures, and proceeded to the\r\nband-stand. When they had stood a little while listening to the music\r\nof the military performers, Jude, Sue, and the child came up on the\r\nother side. Arabella did not care if they should recognize her; but\r\nthey were too deeply absorbed in their own lives, as translated into\r\nemotion by the military band, to perceive her under her beaded veil.\r\nShe walked round the outside of the listening throng, passing behind\r\nthe lovers, whose movements had an unexpected fascination for her\r\nto-day. Scrutinizing them narrowly from the rear she noticed that\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s hand sought Sue\xe2\x80\x99s as they stood, the two standing close together\r\nso as to conceal, as they supposed, this tacit expression of their\r\nmutual responsiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilly fools\xe2\x80\x94like two children!\xe2\x80\x9d Arabella whispered to herself\r\nmorosely, as she rejoined her companions, with whom she preserved a\r\npreoccupied silence.\r\n\r\nAnny meanwhile had jokingly remarked to Vilbert on Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s hankering\r\ninterest in her first husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the physician to Arabella, apart; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you want anything\r\nsuch as this, Mrs. Cartlett? It is not compounded out of my regular\r\npharmacop\xc5\x93ia, but I am sometimes asked for such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d He produced a\r\nsmall phial of clear liquid. \xe2\x80\x9cA love-philtre, such as was used by the\r\nancients with great effect. I found it out by study of their writings,\r\nand have never known it to fail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it made of?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arabella curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94a distillation of the juices of doves\xe2\x80\x99 hearts\xe2\x80\x94otherwise\r\npigeons\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94is one of the ingredients. It took nearly a hundred hearts to\r\nproduce that small bottle full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you get pigeons enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell a secret, I get a piece of rock-salt, of which pigeons are\r\ninordinately fond, and place it in a dovecot on my roof. In a few hours\r\nthe birds come to it from all points of the compass\xe2\x80\x94east, west, north,\r\nand south\xe2\x80\x94and thus I secure as many as I require. You use the liquid by\r\ncontriving that the desired man shall take about ten drops of it in his\r\ndrink. But remember, all this is told you because I gather from your\r\nquestions that you mean to be a purchaser. You must keep faith with\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a bottle\xe2\x80\x94to give some friend or other to try it\r\non her young man.\xe2\x80\x9d She produced five shillings, the price asked, and\r\nslipped the phial in her capacious bosom. Saying presently that she was\r\ndue at an appointment with her husband, she sauntered away towards the\r\nrefreshment bar, Jude, his companion, and the child having gone on to\r\nthe horticultural tent, where Arabella caught a glimpse of them\r\nstanding before a group of roses in bloom.\r\n\r\nShe waited a few minutes observing them, and then proceeded to join her\r\nspouse with no very amiable sentiments. She found him seated on a stool\r\nby the bar, talking to one of the gaily dressed maids who had served\r\nhim with spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think you had enough of this business at home!\xe2\x80\x9d Arabella\r\nremarked gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely you didn\xe2\x80\x99t come fifty miles from your own\r\nbar to stick in another? Come, take me round the show, as other men do\r\ntheir wives! Dammy, one would think you were a young bachelor, with\r\nnobody to look after but yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we agreed to meet here; and what could I do but wait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now we have met, come along,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, ready to quarrel\r\nwith the sun for shining on her. And they left the tent together, this\r\npot-bellied man and florid woman, in the antipathetic, recriminatory\r\nmood of the average husband and wife of Christendom.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the more exceptional couple and the boy still lingered\r\nin the pavilion of flowers\xe2\x80\x94an enchanted palace to their appreciative\r\ntaste\xe2\x80\x94Sue\xe2\x80\x99s usually pale cheeks reflecting the pink of the tinted roses\r\nat which she gazed; for the gay sights, the air, the music, and the\r\nexcitement of a day\xe2\x80\x99s outing with Jude had quickened her blood and made\r\nher eyes sparkle with vivacity. She adored roses, and what Arabella had\r\nwitnessed was Sue detaining Jude almost against his will while she\r\nlearnt the names of this variety and that, and put her face within an\r\ninch of their blooms to smell them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to push my face quite into them\xe2\x80\x94the dears!\xe2\x80\x9d she had\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I suppose it is against the rules to touch them\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nJude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you baby,\xe2\x80\x9d said he: and then playfully gave her a little push, so\r\nthat her nose went among the petals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe policeman will be down on us, and I shall say it was my husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfault!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she looked up at him, and smiled in a way that told so much to\r\nArabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy?\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Because you have come to the great Wessex Agricultural Show\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nbecause _we_ have come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are always trying to make me confess to all sorts of absurdities.\r\nBecause I am improving my mind, of course, by seeing all these\r\nsteam-ploughs, and threshing-machines, and chaff-cutters, and cows, and\r\npigs, and sheep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude was quite content with a baffle from his ever evasive companion.\r\nBut when he had forgotten that he had put the question, and because he\r\nno longer wished for an answer, she went on: \xe2\x80\x9cI feel that we have\r\nreturned to Greek joyousness, and have blinded ourselves to sickness\r\nand sorrow, and have forgotten what twenty-five centuries have taught\r\nthe race since their time, as one of your Christminster luminaries\r\nsays\xe2\x80\xa6 There is one immediate shadow, however\xe2\x80\x94only one.\xe2\x80\x9d And she looked\r\nat the aged child, whom, though they had taken him to everything likely\r\nto attract a young intelligence, they had utterly failed to interest.\r\n\r\nHe knew what they were saying and thinking. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very, very sorry,\r\nFather and Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut please don\xe2\x80\x99t mind!\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I\r\nshould like the flowers very very much, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep on thinking\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d be all withered in a few days!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unnoticed lives that the pair had hitherto led began, from the day\r\nof the suspended wedding onwards, to be observed and discussed by other\r\npersons than Arabella. The society of Spring Street and the\r\nneighbourhood generally did not understand, and probably could not have\r\nbeen made to understand, Sue and Jude\xe2\x80\x99s private minds, emotions,\r\npositions, and fears. The curious facts of a child coming to them\r\nunexpectedly, who called Jude \xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d and Sue \xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d and a hitch\r\nin a marriage ceremony intended for quietness to be performed at a\r\nregistrar\xe2\x80\x99s office, together with rumours of the undefended cases in\r\nthe law-courts, bore only one translation to plain minds.\r\n\r\nLittle Time\xe2\x80\x94for though he was formally turned into \xe2\x80\x9cJude,\xe2\x80\x9d the apt\r\nnickname stuck to him\xe2\x80\x94would come home from school in the evening, and\r\nrepeat inquiries and remarks that had been made to him by the other\r\nboys; and cause Sue, and Jude when he heard them, a great deal of pain\r\nand sadness.\r\n\r\nThe result was that shortly after the attempt at the registrar\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npair went off\xe2\x80\x94to London it was believed\xe2\x80\x94for several days, hiring\r\nsomebody to look to the boy. When they came back they let it be\r\nunderstood indirectly, and with total indifference and weariness of\r\nmien, that they were legally married at last. Sue, who had previously\r\nbeen called Mrs. Bridehead now openly adopted the name of Mrs. Fawley.\r\nHer dull, cowed, and listless manner for days seemed to substantiate\r\nall this.\r\n\r\nBut the mistake (as it was called) of their going away so secretly to\r\ndo the business, kept up much of the mystery of their lives; and they\r\nfound that they made not such advances with their neighbours as they\r\nhad expected to do thereby. A living mystery was not much less\r\ninteresting than a dead scandal.\r\n\r\nThe baker\xe2\x80\x99s lad and the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s boy, who at first had used to lift\r\ntheir hats gallantly to Sue when they came to execute their errands, in\r\nthese days no longer took the trouble to render her that homage, and\r\nthe neighbouring artizans\xe2\x80\x99 wives looked straight along the pavement\r\nwhen they encountered her.\r\n\r\nNobody molested them, it is true; but an oppressive atmosphere began to\r\nencircle their souls, particularly after their excursion to the show,\r\nas if that visit had brought some evil influence to bear on them. And\r\ntheir temperaments were precisely of a kind to suffer from this\r\natmosphere, and to be indisposed to lighten it by vigorous and open\r\nstatements. Their apparent attempt at reparation had come too late to\r\nbe effective.\r\n\r\nThe headstone and epitaph orders fell off: and two or three months\r\nlater, when autumn came, Jude perceived that he would have to return to\r\njourney-work again, a course all the more unfortunate just now, in that\r\nhe had not as yet cleared off the debt he had unavoidably incurred in\r\nthe payment of the law-costs of the previous year.\r\n\r\nOne evening he sat down to share the common meal with Sue and the child\r\nas usual. \xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold on here no\r\nlonger. The life suits us, certainly; but if we could get away to a\r\nplace where we are unknown, we should be lighter hearted, and have a\r\nbetter chance. And so I am afraid we must break it up here, however\r\nawkward for you, poor dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue was always much affected at a picture of herself as an object of\r\npity, and she saddened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I am not sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said she presently. \xe2\x80\x9cI am much depressed by the\r\nway they look at me here. And you have been keeping on this house and\r\nfurniture entirely for me and the boy! You don\xe2\x80\x99t want it yourself, and\r\nthe expense is unnecessary. But whatever we do, wherever we go, you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t take him away from me, Jude dear? I could not let him go now! The\r\ncloud upon his young mind makes him so pathetic to me; I do hope to\r\nlift it some day! And he loves me so. You won\xe2\x80\x99t take him away from me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I won\xe2\x80\x99t, dear little girl! We\xe2\x80\x99ll get nice lodgings, wherever\r\nwe go. I shall be moving about probably\xe2\x80\x94getting a job here and a job\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall do something too, of course, till\xe2\x80\x94till\xe2\x80\x94 Well, now I can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nuseful in the lettering it behoves me to turn my hand to something\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t hurry about getting employment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said regretfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant you to do that. I wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, Sue. The boy and yourself are\r\nenough for you to attend to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door, and Jude answered it. Sue could hear the\r\nconversation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Fawley at home? \xe2\x80\xa6 Biles and Willis, the building contractors,\r\nsent me to know if you\xe2\x80\x99ll undertake the relettering of the ten\r\ncommandments in a little church they\xe2\x80\x99ve been restoring lately in the\r\ncountry near here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude reflected, and said he could undertake it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a very artistic job,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the messenger. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nclergyman is a very old-fashioned chap, and he has refused to let\r\nanything more be done to the church than cleaning and repairing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent old man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue to herself, who was sentimentally opposed\r\nto the horrors of over-restoration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Ten Commandments are fixed to the east end,\xe2\x80\x9d the messenger went\r\non, \xe2\x80\x9cand they want doing up with the rest of the wall there, since he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have them carted off as old materials belonging to the contractor\r\nin the usual way of the trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA bargain as to terms was struck, and Jude came indoors. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, you\r\nsee,\xe2\x80\x9d he said cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cOne more job yet, at any rate, and you can\r\nhelp in it\xe2\x80\x94at least you can try. We shall have all the church to\r\nourselves, as the rest of the work is finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNext day Jude went out to the church, which was only two miles off. He\r\nfound that what the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s clerk had said was true. The tables of\r\nthe Jewish law towered sternly over the utensils of Christian grace, as\r\nthe chief ornament of the chancel end, in the fine dry style of the\r\nlast century. And as their framework was constructed of ornamental\r\nplaster they could not be taken down for repair. A portion, crumbled by\r\ndamp, required renewal; and when this had been done, and the whole\r\ncleansed, he began to renew the lettering. On the second morning Sue\r\ncame to see what assistance she could render, and also because they\r\nliked to be together.\r\n\r\nThe silence and emptiness of the building gave her confidence, and,\r\nstanding on a safe low platform erected by Jude, which she was\r\nnevertheless timid at mounting, she began painting in the letters of\r\nthe first Table while he set about mending a portion of the second. She\r\nwas quite pleased at her powers; she had acquired them in the days she\r\npainted illumined texts for the church-fitting shop at Christminster.\r\nNobody seemed likely to disturb them; and the pleasant twitter of\r\nbirds, and rustle of October leafage, came in through an open window,\r\nand mingled with their talk.\r\n\r\nThey were not, however, to be left thus snug and peaceful for long.\r\nAbout half-past twelve there came footsteps on the gravel without. The\r\nold vicar and his churchwarden entered, and, coming up to see what was\r\nbeing done, seemed surprised to discover that a young woman was\r\nassisting. They passed on into an aisle, at which time the door again\r\nopened, and another figure entered\xe2\x80\x94a small one, that of little Time,\r\nwho was crying. Sue had told him where he might find her between\r\nschool-hours, if he wished. She came down from her perch, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay to eat my dinner in school, because they said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ndescribed how some boys had taunted him about his nominal mother, and\r\nSue, grieved, expressed her indignation to Jude aloft. The child went\r\ninto the churchyard, and Sue returned to her work. Meanwhile the door\r\nhad opened again, and there shuffled in with a businesslike air the\r\nwhite-aproned woman who cleaned the church. Sue recognized her as one\r\nwho had friends in Spring Street, whom she visited. The church-cleaner\r\nlooked at Sue, gaped, and lifted her hands; she had evidently\r\nrecognized Jude\xe2\x80\x99s companion as the latter had recognized her. Next came\r\ntwo ladies, and after talking to the charwoman they also moved forward,\r\nand as Sue stood reaching upward, watched her hand tracing the letters,\r\nand critically regarded her person in relief against the white wall,\r\ntill she grew so nervous that she trembled visibly.\r\n\r\nThey went back to where the others were standing, talking in\r\nundertones: and one said\xe2\x80\x94Sue could not hear which\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s his wife, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome say Yes: some say No,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply from the charwoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot? Then she ought to be, or somebody\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s very clear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve only been married a very few weeks, whether or no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange pair to be painting the Two Tables! I wonder Biles and\r\nWillis could think of such a thing as hiring those!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe churchwarden supposed that Biles and Willis knew of nothing wrong,\r\nand then the other, who had been talking to the old woman, explained\r\nwhat she meant by calling them strange people.\r\n\r\nThe probable drift of the subdued conversation which followed was made\r\nplain by the churchwarden breaking into an anecdote, in a voice that\r\neverybody in the church could hear, though obviously suggested by the\r\npresent situation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, it is a curious thing, but my grandfather told me a strange\r\ntale of a most immoral case that happened at the painting of the\r\nCommandments in a church out by Gaymead\xe2\x80\x94which is quite within a walk of\r\nthis one. In them days Commandments were mostly done in gilt letters on\r\na black ground, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how they were out where I say, before the\r\nowld church was rebuilded. It must have been somewhere about a hundred\r\nyears ago that them Commandments wanted doing up just as ours do here,\r\nand they had to get men from Aldbrickham to do \xe2\x80\x99em. Now they wished to\r\nget the job finished by a particular Sunday, so the men had to work\r\nlate Saturday night, against their will, for overtime was not paid then\r\nas \xe2\x80\x99tis now. There was no true religion in the country at that date,\r\nneither among pa\xe2\x80\x99sons, clerks, nor people, and to keep the men up to\r\ntheir work the vicar had to let \xe2\x80\x99em have plenty of drink during the\r\nafternoon. As evening drawed on they sent for some more themselves;\r\nrum, by all account. It got later and later, and they got more and more\r\nfuddled, till at last they went a-putting their rum-bottle and rummers\r\nupon the communion table, and drawed up a trestle or two, and sate\r\nround comfortable and poured out again right hearty bumpers. No sooner\r\nhad they tossed off their glasses than, so the story goes, they fell\r\ndown senseless, one and all. How long they bode so they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\r\nbut when they came to themselves there was a terrible thunder-storm\r\na-raging, and they seemed to see in the gloom a dark figure with very\r\nthin legs and a curious voot, a-standing on the ladder, and finishing\r\ntheir work. When it got daylight they could see that the work was\r\nreally finished, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t at all mind finishing it themselves. They\r\nwent home, and the next thing they heard was that a great scandal had\r\nbeen caused in the church that Sunday morning, for when the people came\r\nand service began, all saw that the Ten Commandments wez painted with\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98nots\xe2\x80\x99 left out. Decent people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t attend service there for a\r\nlong time, and the Bishop had to be sent for to reconsecrate the\r\nchurch. That\xe2\x80\x99s the tradition as I used to hear it as a child. You must\r\ntake it for what it is wo\xe2\x80\x99th, but this case to-day has reminded me o\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nas I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitors gave one more glance, as if to see whether Jude and Sue\r\nhad left the \xe2\x80\x9cnots\xe2\x80\x9d out likewise, and then severally left the church,\r\neven the old woman at last. Sue and Jude, who had not stopped working,\r\nsent back the child to school, and remained without speaking; till,\r\nlooking at her narrowly, he found she had been crying silently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, comrade!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t _bear_ that they, and everybody, should think people wicked\r\nbecause they may have chosen to live their own way! It is really these\r\nopinions that make the best intentioned people reckless, and actually\r\nbecome immoral!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever be cast down! It was only a funny story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but we suggested it! I am afraid I have done you mischief, Jude,\r\ninstead of helping you by coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo have suggested such a story was certainly not very exhilarating, in\r\na serious view of their position. However, in a few minutes Sue seemed\r\nto see that their position this morning had a ludicrous side, and\r\nwiping her eyes she laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is droll, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we two, of all people, with\r\nour queer history, should happen to be here painting the Ten\r\nCommandments! You a reprobate, and I\xe2\x80\x94in my condition\xe2\x80\xa6 O dear!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 And\r\nwith her hand over her eyes she laughed again silently and\r\nintermittently, till she was quite weak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we are right again, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we,\r\nlittle girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but it is serious, all the same!\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed as she took up the\r\nbrush and righted herself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut do you see they don\xe2\x80\x99t think we are\r\nmarried? They _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ believe it! It is extraordinary!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether they think so or not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nany more trouble to make them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat down to lunch\xe2\x80\x94which they had brought with them not to hinder\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94and having eaten it, were about to set to work anew when a man\r\nentered the church, and Jude recognized in him the contractor Willis.\r\nHe beckoned to Jude, and spoke to him apart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve just had a complaint about this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with rather\r\nbreathless awkwardness. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to go into the matter\xe2\x80\x94as of\r\ncourse I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was going on\xe2\x80\x94but I am afraid I must ask you\r\nand her to leave off, and let somebody else finish this! It is best, to\r\navoid all unpleasantness. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you for the week, all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude was too independent to make any fuss; and the contractor paid him,\r\nand left. Jude picked up his tools, and Sue cleansed her brush. Then\r\ntheir eyes met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could we be so simple as to suppose we might do this!\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\ndropping to her tragic note. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we ought not\xe2\x80\x94I ought not\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nhave come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea that anybody was going to intrude into such a lonely\r\nplace and see us!\xe2\x80\x9d Jude returned. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, dear; and\r\nof course I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to injure Willis\xe2\x80\x99s trade-connection by\r\nstaying.\xe2\x80\x9d They sat down passively for a few minutes, proceeded out of\r\nthe church, and overtaking the boy pursued their thoughtful way to\r\nAldbrickham.\r\n\r\nFawley had still a pretty zeal in the cause of education, and, as was\r\nnatural with his experiences, he was active in furthering \xe2\x80\x9cequality of\r\nopportunity\xe2\x80\x9d by any humble means open to him. He had joined an\r\nArtizans\xe2\x80\x99 Mutual Improvement Society established in the town about the\r\ntime of his arrival there; its members being young men of all creeds\r\nand denominations, including Churchmen, Congregationalists, Baptists,\r\nUnitarians, Positivists, and others\xe2\x80\x94Agnostics had scarcely been heard\r\nof at this time\xe2\x80\x94their one common wish to enlarge their minds forming a\r\nsufficiently close bond of union. The subscription was small, and the\r\nroom homely; and Jude\xe2\x80\x99s activity, uncustomary acquirements, and, above\r\nall, singular intuition on what to read and how to set about\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94begotten of his years of struggle against malignant stars\xe2\x80\x94had led to\r\nhis being placed on the committee.\r\n\r\nA few evenings after his dismissal from the church repairs, and before\r\nhe had obtained any more work to do, he went to attend a meeting of the\r\naforesaid committee. It was late when he arrived: all the others had\r\ncome, and as he entered they looked dubiously at him, and hardly\r\nuttered a word of greeting. He guessed that something bearing on\r\nhimself had been either discussed or mooted. Some ordinary business was\r\ntransacted, and it was disclosed that the number of subscriptions had\r\nshown a sudden falling off for that quarter. One member\xe2\x80\x94a really\r\nwell-meaning and upright man\xe2\x80\x94began speaking in enigmas about certain\r\npossible causes: that it behoved them to look well into their\r\nconstitution; for if the committee were not respected, and had not at\r\nleast, in their differences, a common standard of _conduct_, they would\r\nbring the institution to the ground. Nothing further was said in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence, but he knew what this meant; and turning to the table wrote a\r\nnote resigning his office there and then.\r\n\r\nThus the supersensitive couple were more and more impelled to go away.\r\nAnd then bills were sent in, and the question arose, what could Jude do\r\nwith his great-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s heavy old furniture, if he left the town to\r\ntravel he knew not whither? This, and the necessity of ready money,\r\ncompelled him to decide on an auction, much as he would have preferred\r\nto keep the venerable goods.\r\n\r\nThe day of the sale came on; and Sue for the last time cooked her own,\r\nthe child\xe2\x80\x99s, and Jude\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast in the little house he had furnished.\r\nIt chanced to be a wet day; moreover Sue was unwell, and not wishing to\r\ndesert her poor Jude in such gloomy circumstances, for he was compelled\r\nto stay awhile, she acted on the suggestion of the auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s man,\r\nand ensconced herself in an upper room, which could be emptied of its\r\neffects, and so kept closed to the bidders. Here Jude discovered her;\r\nand with the child, and their few trunks, baskets, and bundles, and two\r\nchairs and a table that were not in the sale, the two sat in meditative\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\nFootsteps began stamping up and down the bare stairs, the comers\r\ninspecting the goods, some of which were of so quaint and ancient a\r\nmake as to acquire an adventitious value as art. Their door was tried\r\nonce or twice, and to guard themselves against intrusion Jude wrote\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate\xe2\x80\x9d on a scrap of paper, and stuck it upon the panel.\r\n\r\nThey soon found that, instead of the furniture, their own personal\r\nhistories and past conduct began to be discussed to an unexpected and\r\nintolerable extent by the intending bidders. It was not till now that\r\nthey really discovered what a fools\xe2\x80\x99 paradise of supposed unrecognition\r\nthey had been living in of late. Sue silently took her companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, and with eyes on each other they heard these passing remarks\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nquaint and mysterious personality of Father Time being a subject which\r\nformed a large ingredient in the hints and innuendoes. At length the\r\nauction began in the room below, whence they could hear each familiar\r\narticle knocked down, the highly prized ones cheaply, the unconsidered\r\nat an unexpected price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t understand us,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad we have\r\ndecided to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question is, where to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ought to be to London. There one can live as one chooses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not London, dear! I know it well. We should be unhappy there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause Arabella is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the chief reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in the country I shall always be uneasy lest there should be some\r\nmore of our late experience. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to lessen it by\r\nexplaining, for one thing, all about the boy\xe2\x80\x99s history. To cut him off\r\nfrom his past I have determined to keep silence. I am sickened of\r\necclesiastical work now; and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to accept it, if offered\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have learnt classic. Gothic is barbaric art, after all.\r\nPugin was wrong, and Wren was right. Remember the interior of\r\nChristminster Cathedral\xe2\x80\x94almost the first place in which we looked in\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s faces. Under the picturesqueness of those Norman details\r\none can see the grotesque childishness of uncouth people trying to\r\nimitate the vanished Roman forms, remembered by dim tradition only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94you have half-converted me to that view by what you have said\r\nbefore. But one can work, and despise what one does. I must do\r\nsomething, if not church-gothic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we could both follow an occupation in which personal\r\ncircumstances don\xe2\x80\x99t count,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling up wistfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI am as\r\ndisqualified for teaching as you are for ecclesiastical art. You must\r\nfall back upon railway stations, bridges, theatres, music-halls,\r\nhotels\xe2\x80\x94everything that has no connection with conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not skilled in those\xe2\x80\xa6 I ought to take to bread-baking. I grew up\r\nin the baking business with aunt, you know. But even a baker must be\r\nconventional, to get customers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless he keeps a cake and gingerbread stall at markets and fairs,\r\nwhere people are gloriously indifferent to everything except the\r\nquality of the goods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir thoughts were diverted by the voice of the auctioneer: \xe2\x80\x9cNow this\r\nantique oak settle\xe2\x80\x94a unique example of old English furniture, worthy\r\nthe attention of all collectors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was my great-grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish we could have\r\nkept the poor old thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne by one the articles went, and the afternoon passed away. Jude and\r\nthe other two were getting tired and hungry, but after the conversation\r\nthey had heard they were shy of going out while the purchasers were in\r\ntheir line of retreat. However, the later lots drew on, and it became\r\nnecessary to emerge into the rain soon, to take on Sue\xe2\x80\x99s things to\r\ntheir temporary lodging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow the next lot: two pairs of pigeons, all alive and plump\xe2\x80\x94a nice pie\r\nfor somebody for next Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe impending sale of these birds had been the most trying suspense of\r\nthe whole afternoon. They were Sue\xe2\x80\x99s pets, and when it was found that\r\nthey could not possibly be kept, more sadness was caused than by\r\nparting from all the furniture. Sue tried to think away her tears as\r\nshe heard the trifling sum that her dears were deemed to be worth\r\nadvanced by small stages to the price at which they were finally\r\nknocked down. The purchaser was a neighbouring poulterer, and they were\r\nunquestionably doomed to die before the next market day.\r\n\r\nNoting her dissembled distress Jude kissed her, and said it was time to\r\ngo and see if the lodgings were ready. He would go on with the boy, and\r\nfetch her soon.\r\n\r\nWhen she was left alone she waited patiently, but Jude did not come\r\nback. At last she started, the coast being clear, and on passing the\r\npoulterer\xe2\x80\x99s shop, not far off, she saw her pigeons in a hamper by the\r\ndoor. An emotion at sight of them, assisted by the growing dusk of\r\nevening, caused her to act on impulse, and first looking around her\r\nquickly, she pulled out the peg which fastened down the cover, and went\r\non. The cover was lifted from within, and the pigeons flew away with a\r\nclatter that brought the chagrined poulterer cursing and swearing to\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nSue reached the lodging trembling, and found Jude and the boy making it\r\ncomfortable for her. \xe2\x80\x9cDo the buyers pay before they bring away the\r\nthings?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think. Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done such a wicked thing!\xe2\x80\x9d And she explained, in\r\nbitter contrition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to pay the poulterer for them, if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t catch them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cBut never mind. Don\xe2\x80\x99t fret about it, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was so foolish of me! Oh why should Nature\xe2\x80\x99s law be mutual\r\nbutchery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it so, Mother?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the boy intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue vehemently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they must take their chance, now, poor things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\nsoon as the sale-account is wound up, and our bills paid, we go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do we go to?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Time, in suspense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must sail under sealed orders, that nobody may trace us\xe2\x80\xa6 We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo to Alfredston, or to Melchester, or to Shaston, or to Christminster.\r\nApart from those we may go anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy mustn\xe2\x80\x99t we go there, Father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of a cloud that has gathered over us; though \xe2\x80\x98we have wronged\r\nno man, corrupted no man, defrauded no man!\xe2\x80\x99 Though perhaps we have\r\n\xe2\x80\x98done that which was right in our own eyes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom that week Jude Fawley and Sue walked no more in the town of\r\nAldbrickham.\r\n\r\nWhither they had gone nobody knew, chiefly because nobody cared to\r\nknow. Any one sufficiently curious to trace the steps of such an\r\nobscure pair might have discovered without great trouble that they had\r\ntaken advantage of his adaptive craftsmanship to enter on a shifting,\r\nalmost nomadic, life, which was not without its pleasantness for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWherever Jude heard of free-stone work to be done, thither he went,\r\nchoosing by preference places remote from his old haunts and Sue\xe2\x80\x99s. He\r\nlaboured at a job, long or briefly, till it was finished; and then\r\nmoved on.\r\n\r\nTwo whole years and a half passed thus. Sometimes he might have been\r\nfound shaping the mullions of a country mansion, sometimes setting the\r\nparapet of a town-hall, sometimes ashlaring an hotel at Sandbourne,\r\nsometimes a museum at Casterbridge, sometimes as far down as Exonbury,\r\nsometimes at Stoke-Barehills. Later still he was at Kennetbridge, a\r\nthriving town not more than a dozen miles south of Marygreen, this\r\nbeing his nearest approach to the village where he was known; for he\r\nhad a sensitive dread of being questioned as to his life and fortunes\r\nby those who had been acquainted with him during his ardent young\r\nmanhood of study and promise, and his brief and unhappy married life at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nAt some of these places he would be detained for months, at others only\r\na few weeks. His curious and sudden antipathy to ecclesiastical work,\r\nboth episcopal and noncomformist, which had risen in him when suffering\r\nunder a smarting sense of misconception, remained with him in cold\r\nblood, less from any fear of renewed censure than from an\r\nultra-conscientiousness which would not allow him to seek a living out\r\nof those who would disapprove of his ways; also, too, from a sense of\r\ninconsistency between his former dogmas and his present practice,\r\nhardly a shred of the beliefs with which he had first gone up to\r\nChristminster now remaining with him. He was mentally approaching the\r\nposition which Sue had occupied when he first met her.\r\n\r\nOn a Saturday evening in May, nearly three years after Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecognition of Sue and himself at the agricultural show, some of those\r\nwho there encountered each other met again.\r\n\r\nIt was the spring fair at Kennetbridge, and, though this ancient\r\ntrade-meeting had much dwindled from its dimensions of former times,\r\nthe long straight street of the borough presented a lively scene about\r\nmidday. At this hour a light trap, among other vehicles, was driven\r\ninto the town by the north road, and up to the door of a temperance\r\ninn. There alighted two women, one the driver, an ordinary country\r\nperson, the other a finely built figure in the deep mourning of a\r\nwidow. Her sombre suit, of pronounced cut, caused her to appear a\r\nlittle out of place in the medley and bustle of a provincial fair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will just find out where it is, Anny,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow-lady to her\r\ncompanion, when the horse and cart had been taken by a man who came\r\nforward: \xe2\x80\x9cand then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back, and meet you here; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go in\r\nand have something to eat and drink. I begin to feel quite a sinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cThough I would sooner have put up\r\nat the Chequers or The Jack. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get much at these temperance\r\nhouses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t you give way to gluttonous desires, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nwoman in weeds reprovingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the proper place. Very well: we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmeet in half an hour, unless you come with me to find out where the\r\nsite of the new chapel is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to. You can tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe companions then went their several ways, the one in crape walking\r\nfirmly along with a mien of disconnection from her miscellaneous\r\nsurroundings. Making inquiries she came to a hoarding, within which\r\nwere excavations denoting the foundations of a building; and on the\r\nboards without one or two large posters announcing that the\r\nfoundation-stone of the chapel about to be erected would be laid that\r\nafternoon at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock by a London preacher of great popularity\r\namong his body.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained thus much the immensely weeded widow retraced her\r\nsteps, and gave herself leisure to observe the movements of the fair.\r\nBy and by her attention was arrested by a little stall of cakes and\r\nginger-breads, standing between the more pretentious erections of\r\ntrestles and canvas. It was covered with an immaculate cloth, and\r\ntended by a young woman apparently unused to the business, she being\r\naccompanied by a boy with an octogenarian face, who assisted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my\xe2\x80\x94senses!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the widow to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cHis wife Sue\xe2\x80\x94if she\r\nis so!\xe2\x80\x9d She drew nearer to the stall. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Mrs. Fawley?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid blandly.\r\n\r\nSue changed colour and recognized Arabella through the crape veil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Mrs. Cartlett?\xe2\x80\x9d she said stiffly. And then perceiving\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s garb her voice grew sympathetic in spite of herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x94you have lost\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor husband. Yes. He died suddenly, six weeks ago, leaving me none\r\ntoo well off, though he was a kind husband to me. But whatever profit\r\nthere is in public-house keeping goes to them that brew the liquors,\r\nand not to them that retail \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\xa6 And you, my little old man! You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow me, I expect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do. You be the woman I thought wer my mother for a bit, till I\r\nfound you wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Father Time, who had learned to use the\r\nWessex tongue quite naturally by now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Never mind. I am a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJuey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cgo down to the station platform with this\r\ntray\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s another train coming in, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone Arabella continued: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll never be a beauty, will he,\r\npoor chap! Does he know I am his mother really?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He thinks there is some mystery about his parentage\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\r\nJude is going to tell him when he is a little older.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you come to be doing this? I am surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only a temporary occupation\xe2\x80\x94a fancy of ours while we are in a\r\ndifficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are living with him still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd another coming soon, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue writhed under the hard and direct questioning, and her tender\r\nlittle mouth began to quiver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord\xe2\x80\x94I mean goodness gracious\xe2\x80\x94what is there to cry about? Some folks\r\nwould be proud enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not that I am ashamed\xe2\x80\x94not as you think! But it seems such a\r\nterribly tragic thing to bring beings into the world\xe2\x80\x94so\r\npresumptuous\xe2\x80\x94that I question my right to do it sometimes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it easy, my dear\xe2\x80\xa6 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me why you do such a thing\r\nas this? Jude used to be a proud sort of chap\xe2\x80\x94above any business\r\nalmost, leave alone keeping a standing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps my husband has altered a little since then. I am sure he is\r\nnot proud now!\xe2\x80\x9d And Sue\xe2\x80\x99s lips quivered again. \xe2\x80\x9cI am doing this because\r\nhe caught a chill early in the year while putting up some stonework of\r\na music-hall, at Quartershot, which he had to do in the rain, the work\r\nhaving to be executed by a fixed day. He is better than he was; but it\r\nhas been a long, weary time! We have had an old widow friend with us to\r\nhelp us through it; but she\xe2\x80\x99s leaving soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am respectable too, thank God, and of a serious way of\r\nthinking since my loss. Why did you choose to sell gingerbreads?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pure accident. He was brought up to the baking business, and\r\nit occurred to him to try his hand at these, which he can make without\r\ncoming out of doors. We call them Christminster cakes. They are a great\r\nsuccess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw any like \xe2\x80\x99em. Why, they are windows and towers, and\r\npinnacles! And upon my word they are very nice.\xe2\x80\x9d She had helped\r\nherself, and was unceremoniously munching one of the cakes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. They are reminiscences of the Christminster Colleges. Traceried\r\nwindows, and cloisters, you see. It was a whim of his to do them in\r\npastry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill harping on Christminster\xe2\x80\x94even in his cakes!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Arabella.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust like Jude. A ruling passion. What a queer fellow he is, and\r\nalways will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue sighed, and she looked her distress at hearing him criticized.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think he is? Come now; you do, though you are so fond of\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course Christminster is a sort of fixed vision with him, which I\r\nsuppose he\xe2\x80\x99ll never be cured of believing in. He still thinks it a\r\ngreat centre of high and fearless thought, instead of what it is, a\r\nnest of commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid\r\nobsequiousness to tradition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella was quizzing Sue with more regard of how she was speaking than\r\nof what she was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cHow odd to hear a woman selling cakes talk\r\nlike that!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you go back to school-keeping?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t have me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the divorce, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat and other things. And there is no reason to wish it. We gave up\r\nall ambition, and were never so happy in our lives till his illness\r\ncame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere in Kennetbridge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue\xe2\x80\x99s manner showed Arabella that her random guess was right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere comes the boy back again,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cMy boy and\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue\xe2\x80\x99s eyes darted a spark. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t throw that in my face!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94though I half-feel as if I should like to have him with me!\r\n\xe2\x80\xa6 But Lord, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take him from \xe2\x80\x99ee\xe2\x80\x94ever I should sin to\r\nspeak so profane\xe2\x80\x94though I should think you must have enough of your\r\nown! He\xe2\x80\x99s in very good hands, that I know; and I am not the woman to\r\nfind fault with what the Lord has ordained. I\xe2\x80\x99ve reached a more\r\nresigned frame of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! I wish I had been able to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should try,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the widow, from the serene heights of a soul\r\nconscious not only of spiritual but of social superiority. \xe2\x80\x9cI make no\r\nboast of my awakening, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not what I was. After Cartlett\xe2\x80\x99s death I\r\nwas passing the chapel in the street next ours, and went into it for\r\nshelter from a shower of rain. I felt a need of some sort of support\r\nunder my loss, and, as \xe2\x80\x99twas righter than gin, I took to going there\r\nregular, and found it a great comfort. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve left London now, you\r\nknow, and at present I am living at Alfredston, with my friend Anny, to\r\nbe near my own old country. I\xe2\x80\x99m not come here to the fair to-day.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s to be the foundation-stone of a new chapel laid this afternoon\r\nby a popular London preacher, and I drove over with Anny. Now I must go\r\nback to meet her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Arabella wished Sue good-bye, and went on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Sue and the other people bustling about Kennetbridge\r\nfair could hear singing inside the placarded hoarding farther down the\r\nstreet. Those who peeped through the opening saw a crowd of persons in\r\nbroadcloth, with hymn-books in their hands, standing round the\r\nexcavations for the new chapel-walls. Arabella Cartlett and her weeds\r\nstood among them. She had a clear, powerful voice, which could be\r\ndistinctly heard with the rest, rising and falling to the tune, her\r\ninflated bosom being also seen doing likewise.\r\n\r\nIt was two hours later on the same day that Anny and Mrs. Cartlett,\r\nhaving had tea at the Temperance Hotel, started on their return journey\r\nacross the high and open country which stretches between Kennetbridge\r\nand Alfredston. Arabella was in a thoughtful mood; but her thoughts\r\nwere not of the new chapel, as Anny at first surmised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94it is something else,\xe2\x80\x9d at last said Arabella sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI came here\r\nto-day never thinking of anybody but poor Cartlett, or of anything but\r\nspreading the Gospel by means of this new tabernacle they\xe2\x80\x99ve begun this\r\nafternoon. But something has happened to turn my mind another way\r\nquite. Anny, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of un again, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen _her_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of Jude, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen his wife. And ever since, do what I\r\nwill, and though I sung the hymns wi\xe2\x80\x99 all my strength, I have not been\r\nable to help thinking about \xe2\x80\x99n; which I\xe2\x80\x99ve no right to do as a chapel\r\nmember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t ye fix your mind upon what was said by the London preacher\r\nto-day, and try to get rid of your wandering fancies that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. But my wicked heart will ramble off in spite of myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I know what it is to have a wanton mind o\xe2\x80\x99 my own, too! If you\r\non\xe2\x80\x99y knew what I do dream sometimes o\xe2\x80\x99 nights quite against my wishes,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d say I had my struggles!\xe2\x80\x9d (Anny, too, had grown rather serious of\r\nlate, her lover having jilted her.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do about it?\xe2\x80\x9d urged Arabella morbidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could take a lock of your late-lost husband\xe2\x80\x99s hair, and have it\r\nmade into a mourning brooch, and look at it every hour of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t a morsel!\xe2\x80\x94and if I had \xe2\x80\x99twould be no good\xe2\x80\xa6 After all that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsaid about the comforts of this religion, I wish I had Jude back\r\nagain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must fight valiant against the feeling, since he\xe2\x80\x99s another\xe2\x80\x99s. And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that another good thing for it, when it afflicts volupshious\r\nwidows, is to go to your husband\xe2\x80\x99s grave in the dusk of evening, and\r\nstand a long while a-bowed down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! I know as well as you what I should do; only I don\xe2\x80\x99t do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey drove in silence along the straight road till they were within the\r\nhorizon of Marygreen, which lay not far to the left of their route.\r\nThey came to the junction of the highway and the cross-lane leading to\r\nthat village, whose church-tower could be seen athwart the hollow. When\r\nthey got yet farther on, and were passing the lonely house in which\r\nArabella and Jude had lived during the first months of their marriage,\r\nand where the pig-killing had taken place, she could control herself no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s more mine than hers!\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat right has she to him,\r\nI should like to know! I\xe2\x80\x99d take him from her if I could!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFie, Abby! And your husband only six weeks gone! Pray against it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe damned if I do! Feelings are feelings! I won\xe2\x80\x99t be a creeping\r\nhypocrite any longer\xe2\x80\x94so there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella had hastily drawn from her pocket a bundle of tracts which she\r\nhad brought with her to distribute at the fair, and of which she had\r\ngiven away several. As she spoke she flung the whole remainder of the\r\npacket into the hedge. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve tried that sort o\xe2\x80\x99 physic and have failed\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 it. I must be as I was born!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! You be excited, dear! Now you come along home quiet, and have a\r\ncup of tea, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let us talk about un no more. We won\xe2\x80\x99t come out\r\nthis road again, as it leads to where he is, because it inflames \xe2\x80\x99ee\r\nso. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right again soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella did calm herself down by degrees; and they crossed the\r\nridge-way. When they began to descend the long, straight hill, they saw\r\nplodding along in front of them an elderly man of spare stature and\r\nthoughtful gait. In his hand he carried a basket; and there was a touch\r\nof slovenliness in his attire, together with that indefinable something\r\nin his whole appearance which suggested one who was his own\r\nhousekeeper, purveyor, confidant, and friend, through possessing nobody\r\nelse at all in the world to act in those capacities for him. The\r\nremainder of the journey was down-hill, and guessing him to be going to\r\nAlfredston they offered him a lift, which he accepted.\r\n\r\nArabella looked at him, and looked again, till at length she spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake I am talking to Mr. Phillotson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wayfarer faced round and regarded her in turn. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; my name is\r\nPhillotson,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember you well enough when you used to be schoolmaster out at\r\nMarygreen, and I one of your scholars. I used to walk up there from\r\nCresscombe every day, because we had only a mistress down at our place,\r\nand you taught better. But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember me as I should\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x94Arabella Donn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said politely, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t recall the name.\r\nAnd I should hardly recognize in your present portly self the slim\r\nschool child no doubt you were then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I always had plenty of flesh on my bones. However, I am staying\r\ndown here with some friends at present. You know, I suppose, who I\r\nmarried?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJude Fawley\xe2\x80\x94also a scholar of yours\xe2\x80\x94at least a night scholar\xe2\x80\x94for some\r\nlittle time, I think? And known to you afterwards, if I am not\r\nmistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, dear me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson, starting out of his stiffness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ Fawley\xe2\x80\x99s wife? To be sure\xe2\x80\x94he had a wife! And he\xe2\x80\x94I understood\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDivorced her\xe2\x80\x94as you did yours\xe2\x80\x94perhaps for better reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94he med have been right in doing it\xe2\x80\x94right for both; for I soon\r\nmarried again, and all went pretty straight till my husband died\r\nlately. But you\xe2\x80\x94you were decidedly wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson, with sudden testiness. \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not talk\r\nof this, but\xe2\x80\x94I am convinced I did only what was right, and just, and\r\nmoral. I have suffered for my act and opinions, but I hold to them;\r\nthough her loss was a loss to me in more ways than one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lost your school and good income through her, did you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to talk of it. I have recently come back here\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nMarygreen. I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are keeping the school there again, just as formerly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pressure of a sadness that would out unsealed him. \xe2\x80\x9cI am there,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as formerly, no. Merely on sufferance. It was a last\r\nresource\xe2\x80\x94a small thing to return to after my move upwards, and my long\r\nindulged hopes\xe2\x80\x94a returning to zero, with all its humiliations. But it\r\nis a refuge. I like the seclusion of the place, and the vicar having\r\nknown me before my so-called eccentric conduct towards my wife had\r\nruined my reputation as a schoolmaster, he accepted my services when\r\nall other schools were closed against me. However, although I take\r\nfifty pounds a year here after taking above two hundred elsewhere, I\r\nprefer it to running the risk of having my old domestic experiences\r\nraked up against me, as I should do if I tried to make a move.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight you are. A contented mind is a continual feast. She has done no\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not doing well, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met her by accident at Kennetbridge this very day, and she is\r\nanything but thriving. Her husband is ill, and she anxious. You made a\r\nfool of a mistake about her, I tell \xe2\x80\x99ee again, and the harm you did\r\nyourself by dirting your own nest serves you right, excusing the\r\nliberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was innocent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut nonsense! They did not even defend the case!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t care to. She was quite innocent of what\r\nobtained you your freedom, at the time you obtained it. I saw her just\r\nafterwards, and proved it to myself completely by talking to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhillotson grasped the edge of the spring-cart, and appeared to be much\r\nstressed and worried by the information. \xe2\x80\x9cStill\xe2\x80\x94she wanted to go,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let her. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way with these\r\nfanciful women that chaw high\xe2\x80\x94innocent or guilty. She\xe2\x80\x99d have come round\r\nin time. We all do! Custom does it! It\xe2\x80\x99s all the same in the end!\r\nHowever, I think she\xe2\x80\x99s fond of her man still\xe2\x80\x94whatever he med be of her.\r\nYou were too quick about her. _I_ shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let her go! I should\r\nhave kept her chained on\xe2\x80\x94her spirit for kicking would have been broke\r\nsoon enough! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like bondage and a stone-deaf taskmaster\r\nfor taming us women. Besides, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the laws on your side. Moses\r\nknew. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you call to mind what he says?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for the moment, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I regret to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall yourself a schoolmaster! I used to think o\xe2\x80\x99t when they read it in\r\nchurch, and I was carrying on a bit. \xe2\x80\x98Then shall the man be guiltless;\r\nbut the woman shall bear her iniquity.\xe2\x80\x99 Damn rough on us women; but we\r\nmust grin and put up wi\xe2\x80\x99 it! Haw haw! Well; she\xe2\x80\x99s got her deserts now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson, with biting sadness. \xe2\x80\x9cCruelty is the law\r\npervading all nature and society; and we can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of it if we\r\nwould!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget to try it next time, old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot answer you, madam. I have never known much of womankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the low levels bordering Alfredston, and passing\r\nthrough the outskirts approached a mill, to which Phillotson said his\r\nerrand led him; whereupon they drew up, and he alighted, bidding them\r\ngood-night in a preoccupied mood.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Sue, though remarkably successful in her cake-selling\r\nexperiment at Kennetbridge fair, had lost the temporary brightness\r\nwhich had begun to sit upon her sadness on account of that success.\r\nWhen all her \xe2\x80\x9cChristminster\xe2\x80\x9d cakes had been disposed of she took upon\r\nher arm the empty basket, and the cloth which had covered the standing\r\nshe had hired, and giving the other things to the boy left the street\r\nwith him. They followed a lane to a distance of half a mile, till they\r\nmet an old woman carrying a child in short clothes, and leading a\r\ntoddler in the other hand.\r\n\r\nSue kissed the children, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is he now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill better!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs. Edlin cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore you are\r\nupstairs again your husband will be well enough\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ee trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey turned, and came to some old, dun-tiled cottages with gardens and\r\nfruit-trees. Into one of these they entered by lifting the latch\r\nwithout knocking, and were at once in the general living-room. Here\r\nthey greeted Jude, who was sitting in an arm-chair, the increased\r\ndelicacy of his normally delicate features, and the childishly\r\nexpectant look in his eyes, being alone sufficient to show that he had\r\nbeen passing through a severe illness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94you have sold them all?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, a gleam of interest lighting up\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Arcades, gables, east windows and all.\xe2\x80\x9d She told him the\r\npecuniary results, and then hesitated. At last, when they were left\r\nalone, she informed him of the unexpected meeting with Arabella, and\r\nthe latter\xe2\x80\x99s widowhood.\r\n\r\nJude was discomposed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94is she living here?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; at Alfredston,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue.\r\n\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s countenance remained clouded. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I had better tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe continued, kissing him anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\xa6 Dear me! Arabella not in the depths of London, but down here! It\r\nis only a little over a dozen miles across the country to Alfredston.\r\nWhat is she doing there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe told him all she knew. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has taken to chapel-going,\xe2\x80\x9d Sue added;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand talks accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps it is for the best that we have almost\r\ndecided to move on. I feel much better to-day, and shall be well enough\r\nto leave in a week or two. Then Mrs. Edlin can go home again\xe2\x80\x94dear\r\nfaithful old soul\xe2\x80\x94the only friend we have in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you think to go to?\xe2\x80\x9d Sue asked, a troublousness in her tones.\r\n\r\nThen Jude confessed what was in his mind. He said it would surprise\r\nher, perhaps, after his having resolutely avoided all the old places\r\nfor so long. But one thing and another had made him think a great deal\r\nof Christminster lately, and, if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, he would like to go\r\nback there. Why should they care if they were known? It was\r\noversensitive of them to mind so much. They could go on selling cakes\r\nthere, for that matter, if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t work. He had no sense of shame\r\nat mere poverty; and perhaps he would be as strong as ever soon, and\r\nable to set up stone-cutting for himself there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you care so much for Christminster?\xe2\x80\x9d she said pensively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristminster cares nothing for you, poor dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I do, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I love the place\xe2\x80\x94although I know how it\r\nhates all men like me\xe2\x80\x94the so-called self-taught\xe2\x80\x94how it scorns our\r\nlaboured acquisitions, when it should be the first to respect them; how\r\nit sneers at our false quantities and mispronunciations, when it should\r\nsay, I see you want help, my poor friend! \xe2\x80\xa6 Nevertheless, it is the\r\ncentre of the universe to me, because of my early dream: and nothing\r\ncan alter it. Perhaps it will soon wake up, and be generous. I pray so!\r\n\xe2\x80\xa6 I should like to go back to live there\xe2\x80\x94perhaps to die there! In two\r\nor three weeks I might, I think. It will then be June, and I should\r\nlike to be there by a particular day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hope that he was recovering proved so far well grounded that in\r\nthree weeks they had arrived in the city of many memories; were\r\nactually treading its pavements, receiving the reflection of the\r\nsunshine from its wasting walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart Sixth AT CHRISTMINSTER AGAIN\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 And she humbled her body greatly, and all the places of her joy she\r\nfilled with her torn hair.\xe2\x80\x9d_\xe2\x80\x94ESTHER (Apoc.).\r\n\r\n    _\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two who decline, a woman and I,_\r\n    _And enjoy our death in the darkness here.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n                \xe2\x80\x94R. BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn their arrival the station was lively with straw-hatted young men,\r\nwelcoming young girls who bore a remarkable family likeness to their\r\nwelcomers, and who were dressed up in the brightest and lightest of\r\nraiment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place seems gay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94it is Remembrance Day!\xe2\x80\x94Jude\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nsly of you\xe2\x80\x94you came to-day on purpose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude quietly, as he took charge of the small child, and\r\ntold Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s boy to keep close to them, Sue attending to their own\r\neldest. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought we might as well come to-day as on any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am afraid it will depress you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking anxiously at\r\nhim up and down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t let it interfere with our business; and we have a good\r\ndeal to do before we shall be settled here. The first thing is\r\nlodgings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving left their luggage and his tools at the station they proceeded\r\non foot up the familiar street, the holiday people all drifting in the\r\nsame direction. Reaching the Fourways they were about to turn off to\r\nwhere accommodation was likely to be found when, looking at the clock\r\nand the hurrying crowd, Jude said: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and see the procession,\r\nand never mind the lodgings just now. We can get them afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOughtn\xe2\x80\x99t we to get a house over our heads first?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nBut his soul seemed full of the anniversary, and together they went\r\ndown Chief Street, their smallest child in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s arms, Sue leading her\r\nlittle girl, and Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s boy walking thoughtfully and silently\r\nbeside them. Crowds of pretty sisters in airy costumes, and meekly\r\nignorant parents who had known no college in their youth, were under\r\nconvoy in the same direction by brothers and sons bearing the opinion\r\nwritten large on them that no properly qualified human beings had lived\r\non earth till they came to grace it here and now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy failure is reflected on me by every one of those young fellows,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cA lesson on presumption is awaiting me to-day!\xe2\x80\x94Humiliation\r\nDay for me! \xe2\x80\xa6 If you, my dear darling, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to my rescue, I\r\nshould have gone to the dogs with despair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw from his face that he was getting into one of his tempestuous,\r\nself-harrowing moods. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been better if we had gone at once\r\nabout our own affairs, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure this sight will\r\nawaken old sorrows in you, and do no good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94we are near; we will see it now,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nThey turned in on the left by the church with the Italian porch, whose\r\nhelical columns were heavily draped with creepers, and pursued the lane\r\ntill there arose on Jude\xe2\x80\x99s sight the circular theatre with that\r\nwell-known lantern above it, which stood in his mind as the sad symbol\r\nof his abandoned hopes, for it was from that outlook that he had\r\nfinally surveyed the City of Colleges on the afternoon of his great\r\nmeditation, which convinced him at last of the futility of his attempt\r\nto be a son of the university.\r\n\r\nTo-day, in the open space stretching between this building and the\r\nnearest college, stood a crowd of expectant people. A passage was kept\r\nclear through their midst by two barriers of timber, extending from the\r\ndoor of the college to the door of the large building between it and\r\nthe theatre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the place\xe2\x80\x94they are just going to pass!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jude in sudden\r\nexcitement. And pushing his way to the front he took up a position\r\nclose to the barrier, still hugging the youngest child in his arms,\r\nwhile Sue and the others kept immediately behind him. The crowd filled\r\nin at their back, and fell to talking, joking, and laughing as carriage\r\nafter carriage drew up at the lower door of the college, and solemn\r\nstately figures in blood-red robes began to alight. The sky had grown\r\novercast and livid, and thunder rumbled now and then.\r\n\r\nFather Time shuddered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt do seem like the Judgment Day!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are only learned Doctors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue.\r\n\r\nWhile they waited big drops of rain fell on their heads and shoulders,\r\nand the delay grew tedious. Sue again wished not to stay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t be long now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, without turning his head.\r\n\r\nBut the procession did not come forth, and somebody in the crowd, to\r\npass the time, looked at the fa\xc3\xa7ade of the nearest college, and said he\r\nwondered what was meant by the Latin inscription in its midst. Jude,\r\nwho stood near the inquirer, explained it, and finding that the people\r\nall round him were listening with interest, went on to describe the\r\ncarving of the frieze (which he had studied years before), and to\r\ncriticize some details of masonry in other college fronts about the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe idle crowd, including the two policemen at the doors, stared like\r\nthe Lycaonians at Paul, for Jude was apt to get too enthusiastic over\r\nany subject in hand, and they seemed to wonder how the stranger should\r\nknow more about the buildings of their town than they themselves did;\r\ntill one of them said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I know that man; he used to work here\r\nyears ago\xe2\x80\x94Jude Fawley, that\xe2\x80\x99s his name! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you mind he used to be\r\nnicknamed Tutor of St. Slums, d\xe2\x80\x99ye mind?\xe2\x80\x94because he aimed at that line\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 business? He\xe2\x80\x99s married, I suppose, then, and that\xe2\x80\x99s his child he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncarrying. Taylor would know him, as he knows everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a man named Jack Stagg, with whom Jude had formerly\r\nworked in repairing the college masonries; Tinker Taylor was seen to be\r\nstanding near. Having his attention called the latter cried across the\r\nbarriers to Jude: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve honoured us by coming back again, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have done any great things for yourself by going\r\naway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude assented to this also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept found more mouths to fill!\xe2\x80\x9d This came in a new voice, and Jude\r\nrecognized its owner to be Uncle Joe, another mason whom he had known.\r\n\r\nJude replied good-humouredly that he could not dispute it; and from\r\nremark to remark something like a general conversation arose between\r\nhim and the crowd of idlers, during which Tinker Taylor asked Jude if\r\nhe remembered the Apostles\xe2\x80\x99 Creed in Latin still, and the night of the\r\nchallenge in the public house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Fortune didn\xe2\x80\x99t lie that way?\xe2\x80\x9d threw in Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cYer powers wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nenough to carry \xe2\x80\x99ee through?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t answer them any more!\xe2\x80\x9d entreated Sue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I like Christminster!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured little Time mournfully,\r\nas he stood submerged and invisible in the crowd.\r\n\r\nBut finding himself the centre of curiosity, quizzing, and comment,\r\nJude was not inclined to shrink from open declarations of what he had\r\nno great reason to be ashamed of; and in a little while was stimulated\r\nto say in a loud voice to the listening throng generally:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a difficult question, my friends, for any young man\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nquestion I had to grapple with, and which thousands are weighing at the\r\npresent moment in these uprising times\xe2\x80\x94whether to follow uncritically\r\nthe track he finds himself in, without considering his aptness for it,\r\nor to consider what his aptness or bent may be, and re-shape his course\r\naccordingly. I tried to do the latter, and I failed. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t admit\r\nthat my failure proved my view to be a wrong one, or that my success\r\nwould have made it a right one; though that\xe2\x80\x99s how we appraise such\r\nattempts nowadays\xe2\x80\x94I mean, not by their essential soundness, but by\r\ntheir accidental outcomes. If I had ended by becoming like one of these\r\ngentlemen in red and black that we saw dropping in here by now,\r\neverybody would have said: \xe2\x80\x98See how wise that young man was, to follow\r\nthe bent of his nature!\xe2\x80\x99 But having ended no better than I began they\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x98See what a fool that fellow was in following a freak of his\r\nfancy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever it was my poverty and not my will that consented to be beaten.\r\nIt takes two or three generations to do what I tried to do in one; and\r\nmy impulses\xe2\x80\x94affections\xe2\x80\x94vices perhaps they should be called\xe2\x80\x94were too\r\nstrong not to hamper a man without advantages; who should be as\r\ncold-blooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig to have a really good\r\nchance of being one of his country\xe2\x80\x99s worthies. You may ridicule me\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\nquite willing that you should\xe2\x80\x94I am a fit subject, no doubt. But I think\r\nif you knew what I have gone through these last few years you would\r\nrather pity me. And if they knew\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he nodded towards the college at\r\nwhich the dons were severally arriving\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit is just possible they would\r\ndo the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe do look ill and worn-out, it is true!\xe2\x80\x9d said a woman.\r\n\r\nSue\xe2\x80\x99s face grew more emotional; but though she stood close to Jude she\r\nwas screened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may do some good before I am dead\xe2\x80\x94be a sort of success as a\r\nfrightful example of what not to do; and so illustrate a moral story,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Jude, beginning to grow bitter, though he had opened serenely\r\nenough. \xe2\x80\x9cI was, perhaps, after all, a paltry victim to the spirit of\r\nmental and social restlessness that makes so many unhappy in these\r\ndays!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell them that!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Sue with tears, at perceiving Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstate of mind. \xe2\x80\x9cYou weren\xe2\x80\x99t that. You struggled nobly to acquire\r\nknowledge, and only the meanest souls in the world would blame you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude shifted the child into a more easy position on his arm, and\r\nconcluded: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what I appear, a sick and poor man, is not the worst of\r\nme. I am in a chaos of principles\xe2\x80\x94groping in the dark\xe2\x80\x94acting by\r\ninstinct and not after example. Eight or nine years ago when I came\r\nhere first, I had a neat stock of fixed opinions, but they dropped away\r\none by one; and the further I get the less sure I am. I doubt if I have\r\nanything more for my present rule of life than following inclinations\r\nwhich do me and nobody else any harm, and actually give pleasure to\r\nthose I love best. There, gentlemen, since you wanted to know how I was\r\ngetting on, I have told you. Much good may it do you! I cannot explain\r\nfurther here. I perceive there is something wrong somewhere in our\r\nsocial formulas: what it is can only be discovered by men or women with\r\ngreater insight than mine\xe2\x80\x94if, indeed, they ever discover it\xe2\x80\x94at least in\r\nour time. \xe2\x80\x98For who knoweth what is good for man in this life?\xe2\x80\x94and who\r\ncan tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the populace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell preached!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tinker Taylor. And privately to his neighbours:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, one of them jobbing pa\xe2\x80\x99sons swarming about here, that takes the\r\nservices when our head reverends want a holiday, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndiscoursed such doctrine for less than a guinea down. Hey? I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my\r\noath not one o\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em would! And then he must have had it wrote down for\r\n\xe2\x80\x99n. And this only a working-man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs a sort of objective commentary on Jude\xe2\x80\x99s remarks there drove up at\r\nthis moment with a belated Doctor, robed and panting, a cab whose horse\r\nfailed to stop at the exact point required for setting down the hirer,\r\nwho jumped out and entered the door. The driver, alighting, began to\r\nkick the animal in the belly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that can be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, \xe2\x80\x9cat college gates in the most\r\nreligious and educational city in the world, what shall we say as to\r\nhow far we\xe2\x80\x99ve got?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrder!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the policemen, who had been engaged with a comrade\r\nin opening the large doors opposite the college. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep yer tongue\r\nquiet, my man, while the procession passes.\xe2\x80\x9d The rain came on more\r\nheavily, and all who had umbrellas opened them. Jude was not one of\r\nthese, and Sue only possessed a small one, half sunshade. She had grown\r\npale, though Jude did not notice it then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go on, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, endeavouring to shelter him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t any lodgings yet, remember, and all our things are at the\r\nstation; and you are by no means well yet. I am afraid this wet will\r\nhurt you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming now. Just a moment, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nA peal of six bells struck out, human faces began to crowd the windows\r\naround, and the procession of heads of houses and new Doctors emerged,\r\ntheir red and black gowned forms passing across the field of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvision like inaccessible planets across an object-glass.\r\n\r\nAs they went their names were called by knowing informants, and when\r\nthey reached the old round theatre of Wren a cheer rose high.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go that way!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jude, and though it now rained steadily he\r\nseemed not to know it, and took them round to the theatre. Here they\r\nstood upon the straw that was laid to drown the discordant noise of\r\nwheels, where the quaint and frost-eaten stone busts encircling the\r\nbuilding looked with pallid grimness on the proceedings, and in\r\nparticular at the bedraggled Jude, Sue, and their children, as at\r\nludicrous persons who had no business there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could get in!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her fervidly. \xe2\x80\x9cListen\xe2\x80\x94I may catch a\r\nfew words of the Latin speech by staying here; the windows are open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, beyond the peals of the organ, and the shouts and hurrahs\r\nbetween each piece of oratory, Jude\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the wet did not bring\r\nmuch Latin to his intelligence more than, now and then, a sonorous word\r\nin _um_ or _ibus_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m an outsider to the end of my days!\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed after a while.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ll go, my patient Sue. How good of you to wait in the rain all\r\nthis time\xe2\x80\x94to gratify my infatuation! I\xe2\x80\x99ll never care any more about the\r\ninfernal cursed place, upon my soul I won\xe2\x80\x99t! But what made you tremble\r\nso when we were at the barrier? And how pale you are, Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw Richard amongst the people on the other side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94did you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is evidently come up to Jerusalem to see the festival like the rest\r\nof us: and on that account is probably living not so very far away. He\r\nhad the same hankering for the university that you had, in a milder\r\nform. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he saw me, though he must have heard you speaking\r\nto the crowd. But he seemed not to notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94suppose he did. Your mind is free from worries about him now, my\r\nSue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose so. But I am weak. Although I know it is all right with\r\nour plans, I felt a curious dread of him; an awe, or terror, of\r\nconventions I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in. It comes over me at times like a sort\r\nof creeping paralysis, and makes me so sad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are getting tired, Sue. Oh\xe2\x80\x94I forgot, darling! Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go on at\r\nonce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey started in quest of the lodging, and at last found something that\r\nseemed to promise well, in Mildew Lane\xe2\x80\x94a spot which to Jude was\r\nirresistible\xe2\x80\x94though to Sue it was not so fascinating\xe2\x80\x94a narrow lane\r\nclose to the back of a college, but having no communication with it.\r\nThe little houses were darkened to gloom by the high collegiate\r\nbuildings, within which life was so far removed from that of the people\r\nin the lane as if it had been on opposite sides of the globe; yet only\r\na thickness of wall divided them. Two or three of the houses had\r\nnotices of rooms to let, and the newcomers knocked at the door of one,\r\nwhich a woman opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94listen!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude suddenly, instead of addressing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the bells\xe2\x80\x94what church can that be? The tones are familiar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother peal of bells had begun to sound out at some distance off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlady tartly. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you knock to ask that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; for lodgings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, coming to himself.\r\n\r\nThe householder scrutinized Sue\xe2\x80\x99s figure a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t any to\r\nlet,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, shutting the door.\r\n\r\nJude looked discomfited, and the boy distressed. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Jude,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet me try. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey found a second place hard by; but here the occupier, observing not\r\nonly Sue, but the boy and the small children, said civilly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry\r\nto say we don\xe2\x80\x99t let where there are children\xe2\x80\x9d; and also closed the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe small child squared its mouth and cried silently, with an instinct\r\nthat trouble loomed. The boy sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like Christminster!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cAre the great old houses gaols?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; colleges,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude; \xe2\x80\x9cwhich perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll study in some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather not!\xe2\x80\x9d the boy rejoined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll try again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pull my cloak more round me\xe2\x80\xa6\r\nLeaving Kennetbridge for this place is like coming from Caiaphas to\r\nPilate! \xe2\x80\xa6 How do I look now, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody would notice it now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\nThere was one other house, and they tried a third time. The woman here\r\nwas more amiable; but she had little room to spare, and could only\r\nagree to take in Sue and the children if her husband could go\r\nelsewhere. This arrangement they perforce adopted, in the stress from\r\ndelaying their search till so late. They came to terms with her, though\r\nher price was rather high for their pockets. But they could not afford\r\nto be critical till Jude had time to get a more permanent abode; and in\r\nthis house Sue took possession of a back room on the second floor with\r\nan inner closet-room for the children. Jude stayed and had a cup of\r\ntea; and was pleased to find that the window commanded the back of\r\nanother of the colleges. Kissing all four he went to get a few\r\nnecessaries and look for lodgings for himself.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone the landlady came up to talk a little with Sue, and\r\ngather something of the circumstances of the family she had taken in.\r\nSue had not the art of prevarication, and, after admitting several\r\nfacts as to their late difficulties and wanderings, she was startled by\r\nthe landlady saying suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really a married woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue hesitated; and then impulsively told the woman that her husband and\r\nherself had each been unhappy in their first marriages, after which,\r\nterrified at the thought of a second irrevocable union, and lest the\r\nconditions of the contract should kill their love, yet wishing to be\r\ntogether, they had literally not found the courage to repeat it, though\r\nthey had attempted it two or three times. Therefore, though in her own\r\nsense of the words she was a married woman, in the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s sense she\r\nwas not.\r\n\r\nThe housewife looked embarrassed, and went downstairs. Sue sat by the\r\nwindow in a reverie, watching the rain. Her quiet was broken by the\r\nnoise of someone entering the house, and then the voices of a man and\r\nwoman in conversation in the passage below. The landlady\xe2\x80\x99s husband had\r\narrived, and she was explaining to him the incoming of the lodgers\r\nduring his absence.\r\n\r\nHis voice rose in sudden anger. \xe2\x80\x9cNow who wants such a woman here? and\r\nperhaps a confinement! \xe2\x80\xa6 Besides, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nchildren? The hall and stairs fresh painted, to be kicked about by\r\nthem! You must have known all was not straight with \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94coming like\r\nthat. Taking in a family when I said a single man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wife expostulated, but, as it seemed, the husband insisted on his\r\npoint; for presently a tap came to Sue\xe2\x80\x99s door, and the woman appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to tell you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you have\r\nthe room for the week after all. My husband objects; and therefore I\r\nmust ask you to go. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind your staying over to-night, as it is\r\ngetting late in the afternoon; but I shall be glad if you can leave\r\nearly in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough she knew that she was entitled to the lodging for a week, Sue\r\ndid not wish to create a disturbance between the wife and husband, and\r\nshe said she would leave as requested. When the landlady had gone Sue\r\nlooked out of the window again. Finding that the rain had ceased she\r\nproposed to the boy that, after putting the little ones to bed, they\r\nshould go out and search about for another place, and bespeak it for\r\nthe morrow, so as not to be so hard-driven then as they had been that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nTherefore, instead of unpacking her boxes, which had just been sent on\r\nfrom the station by Jude, they sallied out into the damp though not\r\nunpleasant streets, Sue resolving not to disturb her husband with the\r\nnews of her notice to quit while he was perhaps worried in obtaining a\r\nlodging for himself. In the company of the boy she wandered into this\r\nstreet and into that; but though she tried a dozen different houses she\r\nfared far worse alone than she had fared in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s company, and could\r\nget nobody to promise her a room for the following day. Every\r\nhouseholder looked askance at such a woman and child inquiring for\r\naccommodation in the gloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought not to be born, ought I?\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy with misgiving.\r\n\r\nThoroughly tired at last Sue returned to the place where she was not\r\nwelcome, but where at least she had temporary shelter. In her absence\r\nJude had left his address; but knowing how weak he still was she\r\nadhered to her determination not to disturb him till the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nSue sat looking at the bare floor of the room, the house being little\r\nmore than an old intramural cottage, and then she regarded the scene\r\noutside the uncurtained window. At some distance opposite, the outer\r\nwalls of Sarcophagus College\xe2\x80\x94silent, black, and windowless\xe2\x80\x94threw their\r\nfour centuries of gloom, bigotry, and decay into the little room she\r\noccupied, shutting out the moonlight by night and the sun by day. The\r\noutlines of Rubric College also were discernible beyond the other, and\r\nthe tower of a third farther off still. She thought of the strange\r\noperation of a simple-minded man\xe2\x80\x99s ruling passion, that it should have\r\nled Jude, who loved her and the children so tenderly, to place them\r\nhere in this depressing purlieu, because he was still haunted by his\r\ndream. Even now he did not distinctly hear the freezing negative that\r\nthose scholared walls had echoed to his desire.\r\n\r\nThe failure to find another lodging, and the lack of room in this house\r\nfor his father, had made a deep impression on the boy\xe2\x80\x94a brooding\r\nundemonstrative horror seemed to have seized him. The silence was\r\nbroken by his saying: \xe2\x80\x9cMother, _what_ shall we do to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue despondently. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid this will trouble\r\nyour father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish Father was quite well, and there had been room for him! Then it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter so much! Poor Father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I do anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! All is trouble, adversity, and suffering!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather went away to give us children room, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better to be out o\xe2\x80\x99 the world than in it, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would almost, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis because of us children, too, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, that you can\xe2\x80\x99t get a good\r\nlodging?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94people do object to children sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen if children make so much trouble, why do people have \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94because it is a law of nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we don\xe2\x80\x99t ask to be born?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what makes it worse with me is that you are not my real mother,\r\nand you needn\xe2\x80\x99t have had me unless you liked. I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have come\r\nto \xe2\x80\x99ee\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the real truth! I troubled \xe2\x80\x99em in Australia, and I\r\ntrouble folk here. I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been born!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that whenever children be born that are not wanted they should\r\nbe killed directly, before their souls come to \xe2\x80\x99em, and not allowed to\r\ngrow big and walk about!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue did not reply. She was doubtfully pondering how to treat this too\r\nreflective child.\r\n\r\nShe at last concluded that, so far as circumstances permitted, she\r\nwould be honest and candid with one who entered into her difficulties\r\nlike an aged friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is going to be another in our family soon,\xe2\x80\x9d she hesitatingly\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is going to be another baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d The boy jumped up wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh God, Mother, you\xe2\x80\x99ve never a-sent\r\nfor another; and such trouble with what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have, I am sorry to say!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Sue, her eyes glistening\r\nwith suspended tears.\r\n\r\nThe boy burst out weeping. \xe2\x80\x9cOh you don\xe2\x80\x99t care, you don\xe2\x80\x99t care!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried in bitter reproach. \xe2\x80\x9cHow _ever_ could you, Mother, be so wicked\r\nand cruel as this, when you needn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it till we was better\r\noff, and Father well! To bring us all into _more_ trouble! No room for\r\nus, and Father a-forced to go away, and we turned out to-morrow; and\r\nyet you be going to have another of us soon! \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x99Tis done o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npurpose!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis!\xe2\x80\x9d He walked up and down sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cY-you must forgive me, little Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded, her bosom heaving\r\nnow as much as the boy\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t explain\xe2\x80\x94I will when you are older.\r\nIt does seem\xe2\x80\x94as if I had done it on purpose, now we are in these\r\ndifficulties! I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain, dear! But it\xe2\x80\x94is not quite on purpose\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes it is\xe2\x80\x94it must be! For nobody would interfere with us, like that,\r\nunless you agreed! I won\xe2\x80\x99t forgive you, ever, ever! I\xe2\x80\x99ll never believe\r\nyou care for me, or Father, or any of us any more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up, and went away into the closet adjoining her room, in which a\r\nbed had been spread on the floor. There she heard him say: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\r\nchildren was gone there\xe2\x80\x99d be no trouble at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think that, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, rather peremptorily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut go to\r\nsleep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe following morning she awoke at a little past six, and decided to\r\nget up and run across before breakfast to the inn which Jude had\r\ninformed her to be his quarters, to tell him what had happened before\r\nhe went out. She arose softly, to avoid disturbing the children, who,\r\nas she knew, must be fatigued by their exertions of yesterday.\r\n\r\nShe found Jude at breakfast in the obscure tavern he had chosen as a\r\ncounterpoise to the expense of her lodging: and she explained to him\r\nher homelessness. He had been so anxious about her all night, he said.\r\nSomehow, now it was morning, the request to leave the lodgings did not\r\nseem such a depressing incident as it had seemed the night before, nor\r\ndid even her failure to find another place affect her so deeply as at\r\nfirst. Jude agreed with her that it would not be worth while to insist\r\nupon her right to stay a week, but to take immediate steps for removal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must all come to this inn for a day or two,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\nrough place, and it will not be so nice for the children, but we shall\r\nhave more time to look round. There are plenty of lodgings in the\r\nsuburbs\xe2\x80\x94in my old quarter of Beersheba. Have breakfast with me now you\r\nare here, my bird. You are sure you are well? There will be plenty of\r\ntime to get back and prepare the children\xe2\x80\x99s meal before they wake. In\r\nfact, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe joined Jude in a hasty meal, and in a quarter of an hour they\r\nstarted together, resolving to clear out from Sue\xe2\x80\x99s too respectable\r\nlodging immediately. On reaching the place and going upstairs she found\r\nthat all was quiet in the children\xe2\x80\x99s room, and called to the landlady\r\nin timorous tones to please bring up the tea-kettle and something for\r\ntheir breakfast. This was perfunctorily done, and producing a couple of\r\neggs which she had brought with her she put them into the boiling\r\nkettle, and summoned Jude to watch them for the youngsters, while she\r\nwent to call them, it being now about half-past eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nJude stood bending over the kettle, with his watch in his hand, timing\r\nthe eggs, so that his back was turned to the little inner chamber where\r\nthe children lay. A shriek from Sue suddenly caused him to start round.\r\nHe saw that the door of the room, or rather closet\xe2\x80\x94which had seemed to\r\ngo heavily upon its hinges as she pushed it back\xe2\x80\x94was open, and that Sue\r\nhad sunk to the floor just within it. Hastening forward to pick her up\r\nhe turned his eyes to the little bed spread on the boards; no children\r\nwere there. He looked in bewilderment round the room. At the back of\r\nthe door were fixed two hooks for hanging garments, and from these the\r\nforms of the two youngest children were suspended, by a piece of\r\nbox-cord round each of their necks, while from a nail a few yards off\r\nthe body of little Jude was hanging in a similar manner. An overturned\r\nchair was near the elder boy, and his glazed eyes were slanted into the\r\nroom; but those of the girl and the baby boy were closed.\r\n\r\nHalf-paralyzed by the strange and consummate horror of the scene, he\r\nlet Sue lie, cut the cords with his pocket-knife and threw the three\r\nchildren on the bed; but the feel of their bodies in the momentary\r\nhandling seemed to say that they were dead. He caught up Sue, who was\r\nin fainting fits, and put her on the bed in the other room, after which\r\nhe breathlessly summoned the landlady and ran out for a doctor.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back Sue had come to herself, and the two helpless women,\r\nbending over the children in wild efforts to restore them, and the\r\ntriplet of little corpses, formed a sight which overthrew his\r\nself-command. The nearest surgeon came in, but, as Jude had inferred,\r\nhis presence was superfluous. The children were past saving, for though\r\ntheir bodies were still barely cold it was conjectured that they had\r\nbeen hanging more than an hour. The probability held by the parents\r\nlater on, when they were able to reason on the case, was that the elder\r\nboy, on waking, looked into the outer room for Sue, and, finding her\r\nabsent, was thrown into a fit of aggravated despondency that the events\r\nand information of the evening before had induced in his morbid\r\ntemperament. Moreover a piece of paper was found upon the floor, on\r\nwhich was written, in the boy\xe2\x80\x99s hand, with the bit of lead pencil that\r\nhe carried:\r\n\r\n_Done because we are too menny._\r\n\r\nAt sight of this Sue\xe2\x80\x99s nerves utterly gave way, an awful conviction\r\nthat her discourse with the boy had been the main cause of the tragedy,\r\nthrowing her into a convulsive agony which knew no abatement. They\r\ncarried her away against her wish to a room on the lower floor; and\r\nthere she lay, her slight figure shaken with her gasps, and her eyes\r\nstaring at the ceiling, the woman of the house vainly trying to soothe\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThey could hear from this chamber the people moving about above, and\r\nshe implored to be allowed to go back, and was only kept from doing so\r\nby the assurance that, if there were any hope, her presence might do\r\nharm, and the reminder that it was necessary to take care of herself\r\nlest she should endanger a coming life. Her inquiries were incessant,\r\nand at last Jude came down and told her there was no hope. As soon as\r\nshe could speak she informed him what she had said to the boy, and how\r\nshe thought herself the cause of this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was in his nature to do it. The Doctor says there\r\nare such boys springing up amongst us\xe2\x80\x94boys of a sort unknown in the\r\nlast generation\xe2\x80\x94the outcome of new views of life. They seem to see all\r\nits terrors before they are old enough to have staying power to resist\r\nthem. He says it is the beginning of the coming universal wish not to\r\nlive. He\xe2\x80\x99s an advanced man, the Doctor: but he can give no consolation\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude had kept back his own grief on account of her; but he now broke\r\ndown; and this stimulated Sue to efforts of sympathy which in some\r\ndegree distracted her from her poignant self-reproach. When everybody\r\nwas gone, she was allowed to see the children.\r\n\r\nThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s face expressed the whole tale of their situation. On that\r\nlittle shape had converged all the inauspiciousness and shadow which\r\nhad darkened the first union of Jude, and all the accidents, mistakes,\r\nfears, errors of the last. He was their nodal point, their focus, their\r\nexpression in a single term. For the rashness of those parents he had\r\ngroaned, for their ill assortment he had quaked, and for the\r\nmisfortunes of these he had died.\r\n\r\nWhen the house was silent, and they could do nothing but await the\r\ncoroner\xe2\x80\x99s inquest, a subdued, large, low voice spread into the air of\r\nthe room from behind the heavy walls at the back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue, her spasmodic breathing suspended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe organ of the college chapel. The organist practising I suppose.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the anthem from the seventy-third Psalm; \xe2\x80\x98Truly God is loving unto\r\nIsrael.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sobbed again. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh my babies! They had done no harm! Why should\r\nthey have been taken away, and not I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another stillness\xe2\x80\x94broken at last by two persons in\r\nconversation somewhere without.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are talking about us, no doubt!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Sue. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We are made a\r\nspectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude listened\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94they are not talking of us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are two\r\nclergymen of different views, arguing about the eastward position. Good\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x94the eastward position, and all creation groaning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen another silence, till she was seized with another uncontrollable\r\nfit of grief. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something external to us which says, \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 First it said, \xe2\x80\x98You shan\xe2\x80\x99t learn!\xe2\x80\x99 Then it said, \xe2\x80\x98You shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlabour!\xe2\x80\x99 Now it says, \xe2\x80\x98You shan\xe2\x80\x99t love!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to soothe her by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s bitter of you, darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they waited, and she went back again to her room. The baby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfrock, shoes, and socks, which had been lying on a chair at the time of\r\nhis death, she would not now have removed, though Jude would fain have\r\ngot them out of her sight. But whenever he touched them she implored\r\nhim to let them lie, and burst out almost savagely at the woman of the\r\nhouse when she also attempted to put them away.\r\n\r\nJude dreaded her dull apathetic silences almost more than her\r\nparoxysms. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak to me, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out, after one\r\nof these. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t turn away from me! I can\xe2\x80\x99t _bear_ the loneliness of\r\nbeing out of your looks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, dear; here I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting his face close to hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\xa6 Oh, my comrade, our perfect union\xe2\x80\x94our two-in-oneness\xe2\x80\x94is now\r\nstained with blood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShadowed by death\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh; but it was I who incited him really, though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was\r\ndoing it! I talked to the child as one should only talk to people of\r\nmature age. I said the world was against us, that it was better to be\r\nout of life than in it at this price; and he took it literally. And I\r\ntold him I was going to have another child. It upset him. Oh how\r\nbitterly he upbraided me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you do it, Sue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell. It was that I wanted to be truthful. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\ndeceiving him as to the facts of life. And yet I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t truthful, for\r\nwith a false delicacy I told him too obscurely.\xe2\x80\x94Why was I half-wiser\r\nthan my fellow-women? And not entirely wiser! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell him\r\npleasant untruths, instead of half-realities? It was my want of\r\nself-control, so that I could neither conceal things nor reveal them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour plan might have been a good one for the majority of cases; only\r\nin our peculiar case it chanced to work badly perhaps. He must have\r\nknown sooner or later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was just making my baby darling a new frock; and now I shall\r\nnever see him in it, and never talk to him any more! \xe2\x80\xa6 My eyes are so\r\nswollen that I can scarcely see; and yet little more than a year ago I\r\ncalled myself happy! We went about loving each other too much\xe2\x80\x94indulging\r\nourselves to utter selfishness with each other! We said\xe2\x80\x94do you\r\nremember?\xe2\x80\x94that we would make a virtue of joy. I said it was Nature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintention, Nature\xe2\x80\x99s law and _raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre_ that we should be joyful in\r\nwhat instincts she afforded us\xe2\x80\x94instincts which civilization had taken\r\nupon itself to thwart. What dreadful things I said! And now Fate has\r\ngiven us this stab in the back for being such fools as to take Nature\r\nat her word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sank into a quiet contemplation, till she said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is best,\r\nperhaps, that they should be gone.\xe2\x80\x94Yes\xe2\x80\x94I see it is! Better that they\r\nshould be plucked fresh than stay to wither away miserably!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cSome say that the elders should rejoice when\r\ntheir children die in infancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they don\xe2\x80\x99t know! \xe2\x80\xa6 Oh my babies, my babies, could you be alive\r\nnow! You may say the boy wished to be out of life, or he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ndone it. It was not unreasonable for him to die: it was part of his\r\nincurably sad nature, poor little fellow! But then the others\xe2\x80\x94my _own_\r\nchildren and yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Sue looked at the hanging little frock and at the socks and\r\nshoes; and her figure quivered like a string. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a pitiable\r\ncreature,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cgood neither for earth nor heaven any more! I am\r\ndriven out of my mind by things! What ought to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d She stared at\r\nJude, and tightly held his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing can be done,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThings are as they are, and will be\r\nbrought to their destined issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused. \xe2\x80\x9cYes! Who said that?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt comes in the chorus of the _Agamemnon_. It has been in my mind\r\ncontinually since this happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Jude\xe2\x80\x94how you\xe2\x80\x99ve missed everything!\xe2\x80\x94you more than I, for I did\r\nget you! To think you should know that by your unassisted reading, and\r\nyet be in poverty and despair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter such momentary diversions her grief would return in a wave.\r\n\r\nThe jury duly came and viewed the bodies, the inquest was held; and\r\nnext arrived the melancholy morning of the funeral. Accounts in the\r\nnewspapers had brought to the spot curious idlers, who stood apparently\r\ncounting the window-panes and the stones of the walls. Doubt of the\r\nreal relations of the couple added zest to their curiosity. Sue had\r\ndeclared that she would follow the two little ones to the grave, but at\r\nthe last moment she gave way, and the coffins were quietly carried out\r\nof the house while she was lying down. Jude got into the vehicle, and\r\nit drove away, much to the relief of the landlord, who now had only Sue\r\nand her luggage remaining on his hands, which he hoped to be also clear\r\nof later on in the day, and so to have freed his house from the\r\nexasperating notoriety it had acquired during the week through his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s unlucky admission of these strangers. In the afternoon he\r\nprivately consulted with the owner of the house, and they agreed that\r\nif any objection to it arose from the tragedy which had occurred there\r\nthey would try to get its number changed.\r\n\r\nWhen Jude had seen the two little boxes\xe2\x80\x94one containing little Jude, and\r\nthe other the two smallest\xe2\x80\x94deposited in the earth he hastened back to\r\nSue, who was still in her room, and he therefore did not disturb her\r\njust then. Feeling anxious, however, he went again about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nThe woman thought she was still lying down, but returned to him to say\r\nthat she was not in her bedroom after all. Her hat and jacket, too,\r\nwere missing: she had gone out. Jude hurried off to the public house\r\nwhere he was sleeping. She had not been there. Then bethinking himself\r\nof possibilities he went along the road to the cemetery, which he\r\nentered, and crossed to where the interments had recently taken place.\r\nThe idlers who had followed to the spot by reason of the tragedy were\r\nall gone now. A man with a shovel in his hands was attempting to earth\r\nin the common grave of the three children, but his arm was held back by\r\nan expostulating woman who stood in the half-filled hole. It was Sue,\r\nwhose coloured clothing, which she had never thought of changing for\r\nthe mourning he had bought, suggested to the eye a deeper grief than\r\nthe conventional garb of bereavement could express.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s filling them in, and he shan\xe2\x80\x99t till I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen my little ones\r\nagain!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried wildly when she saw Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see them once\r\nmore. Oh Jude\xe2\x80\x94please Jude\xe2\x80\x94I want to see them! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you would\r\nlet them be taken away while I was asleep! You said perhaps I should\r\nsee them once more before they were screwed down; and then you didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nbut took them away! Oh Jude, you are cruel to me too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been wanting me to dig out the grave again, and let her get to\r\nthe coffins,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man with the spade. \xe2\x80\x9cShe ought to be took home,\r\nby the look o\xe2\x80\x99 her. She is hardly responsible, poor thing, seemingly.\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t dig \xe2\x80\x99em up again now, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Do ye go home with your husband, and\r\ntake it quiet, and thank God that there\xe2\x80\x99ll be another soon to swage yer\r\ngrief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Sue kept asking piteously: \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I see them once more\xe2\x80\x94just once!\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t I? Only just one little minute, Jude? It would not take long! And\r\nI should be so glad, Jude! I will be so good, and not disobey you ever\r\nany more, Jude, if you will let me? I would go home quietly afterwards,\r\nand not want to see them any more! Can\xe2\x80\x99t I? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus she went on. Jude was thrown into such acute sorrow that he almost\r\nfelt he would try to get the man to accede. But it could do no good,\r\nand might make her still worse; and he saw that it was imperative to\r\nget her home at once. So he coaxed her, and whispered tenderly, and put\r\nhis arm round her to support her; till she helplessly gave in, and was\r\ninduced to leave the cemetery.\r\n\r\nHe wished to obtain a fly to take her back in, but economy being so\r\nimperative she deprecated his doing so, and they walked along slowly,\r\nJude in black crape, she in brown and red clothing. They were to have\r\ngone to a new lodging that afternoon, but Jude saw that it was not\r\npracticable, and in course of time they entered the now hated house.\r\nSue was at once got to bed, and the Doctor sent for.\r\n\r\nJude waited all the evening downstairs. At a very late hour the\r\nintelligence was brought to him that a child had been prematurely born,\r\nand that it, like the others, was a corpse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSue was convalescent, though she had hoped for death, and Jude had\r\nagain obtained work at his old trade. They were in other lodgings now,\r\nin the direction of Beersheba, and not far from the Church of\r\nCeremonies\xe2\x80\x94Saint Silas.\r\n\r\nThey would sit silent, more bodeful of the direct antagonism of things\r\nthan of their insensate and stolid obstructiveness. Vague and quaint\r\nimaginings had haunted Sue in the days when her intellect scintillated\r\nlike a star, that the world resembled a stanza or melody composed in a\r\ndream; it was wonderfully excellent to the half-aroused intelligence,\r\nbut hopelessly absurd at the full waking; that the First Cause worked\r\nautomatically like a somnambulist, and not reflectively like a sage;\r\nthat at the framing of the terrestrial conditions there seemed never to\r\nhave been contemplated such a development of emotional perceptiveness\r\namong the creatures subject to those conditions as that reached by\r\nthinking and educated humanity. But affliction makes opposing forces\r\nloom anthropomorphous; and those ideas were now exchanged for a sense\r\nof Jude and herself fleeing from a persecutor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must conform!\xe2\x80\x9d she said mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the ancient wrath of the\r\nPower above us has been vented upon us, His poor creatures, and we must\r\nsubmit. There is no choice. We must. It is no use fighting against\r\nGod!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only against man and senseless circumstance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I been thinking of! I am getting as\r\nsuperstitious as a savage! \xe2\x80\xa6 But whoever or whatever our foe may be, I\r\nam cowed into submission. I have no more fighting strength left; no\r\nmore enterprise. I am beaten, beaten! \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98We are made a spectacle unto\r\nthe world, and to angels, and to men!\xe2\x80\x99 I am always saying that now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel the same!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do? You are in work now; but remember, it may only be\r\nbecause our history and relations are not absolutely known\xe2\x80\xa6 Possibly,\r\nif they knew our marriage had not been formalized they would turn you\r\nout of your job as they did at Aldbrickham!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know. Perhaps they would hardly do that. However, I think\r\nthat we ought to make it legal now\xe2\x80\x94as soon as you are able to go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think we ought?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Jude fell into thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seemed to myself lately,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto belong to that vast band of men shunned by the virtuous\xe2\x80\x94the men\r\ncalled seducers. It amazes me when I think of it! I have not been\r\nconscious of it, or of any wrongdoing towards you, whom I love more\r\nthan myself. Yet I am one of those men! I wonder if any other of them\r\nare the same purblind, simple creatures as I? \xe2\x80\xa6 Yes, Sue\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nam. I seduced you\xe2\x80\xa6 You were a distinct type\xe2\x80\x94a refined creature,\r\nintended by Nature to be left intact. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave you alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t reproach yourself with being\r\nwhat you are not. If anybody is to blame it is I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI supported you in your resolve to leave Phillotson; and without me\r\nperhaps you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have urged him to let you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have, just the same. As to ourselves, the fact of our not\r\nhaving entered into a legal contract is the saving feature in our\r\nunion. We have thereby avoided insulting, as it were, the solemnity of\r\nour first marriages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSolemnity?\xe2\x80\x9d Jude looked at her with some surprise, and grew conscious\r\nthat she was not the Sue of their earlier time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a little quiver in her words, \xe2\x80\x9cI have had\r\ndreadful fears, a dreadful sense of my own insolence of action. I have\r\nthought\xe2\x80\x94that I am still his wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichard\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, dearest!\xe2\x80\x94why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain! Only the thought comes to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your weakness\xe2\x80\x94a sick fancy, without reason or meaning! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nit trouble you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue sighed uneasily.\r\n\r\nAs a set-off against such discussions as these there had come an\r\nimprovement in their pecuniary position, which earlier in their\r\nexperience would have made them cheerful. Jude had quite unexpectedly\r\nfound good employment at his old trade almost directly he arrived, the\r\nsummer weather suiting his fragile constitution; and outwardly his days\r\nwent on with that monotonous uniformity which is in itself so grateful\r\nafter vicissitude. People seemed to have forgotten that he had ever\r\nshown any awkward aberrancies, and he daily mounted to the parapets and\r\ncopings of colleges he could never enter, and renewed the crumbling\r\nfreestones of mullioned windows he would never look from, as if he had\r\nknown no wish to do otherwise.\r\n\r\nThere was this change in him; that he did not often go to any service\r\nat the churches now. One thing troubled him more than any other; that\r\nSue and himself had mentally travelled in opposite directions since the\r\ntragedy: events which had enlarged his own views of life, laws,\r\ncustoms, and dogmas, had not operated in the same manner on Sue\xe2\x80\x99s. She\r\nwas no longer the same as in the independent days, when her intellect\r\nplayed like lambent lightning over conventions and formalities which he\r\nat that time respected, though he did not now.\r\n\r\nOn a particular Sunday evening he came in rather late. She was not at\r\nhome, but she soon returned, when he found her silent and meditative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of, little woman?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell clearly! I have thought that we have been selfish,\r\ncareless, even impious, in our courses, you and I. Our life has been a\r\nvain attempt at self-delight. But self-abnegation is the higher road.\r\nWe should mortify the flesh\xe2\x80\x94the terrible flesh\xe2\x80\x94the curse of Adam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has come over you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to be continually sacrificing ourselves on the altar of duty!\r\nBut I have always striven to do what has pleased me. I well deserved\r\nthe scourging I have got! I wish something would take the evil right\r\nout of me, and all my monstrous errors, and all my sinful ways!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue\xe2\x80\x94my own too suffering dear!\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no evil woman in you. Your\r\nnatural instincts are perfectly healthy; not quite so impassioned,\r\nperhaps, as I could wish; but good, and dear, and pure. And as I have\r\noften said, you are absolutely the most ethereal, least sensual woman I\r\never knew to exist without inhuman sexlessness. Why do you talk in such\r\na changed way? We have not been selfish, except when no one could\r\nprofit by our being otherwise. You used to say that human nature was\r\nnoble and long-suffering, not vile and corrupt, and at last I thought\r\nyou spoke truly. And now you seem to take such a much lower view!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a humble heart; and a chastened mind; and I have never had them\r\nyet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been fearless, both as a thinker and as a feeler, and you\r\ndeserved more admiration than I gave. I was too full of narrow dogmas\r\nat that time to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Jude! I wish my every fearless word and thought could\r\nbe rooted out of my history. Self-renunciation\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s everything! I\r\ncannot humiliate myself too much. I should like to prick myself all\r\nover with pins and bleed out the badness that\xe2\x80\x99s in me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pressing her little face against his breast as if she\r\nwere an infant. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is bereavement that has brought you to this! Such\r\nremorse is not for you, my sensitive plant, but for the wicked ones of\r\nthe earth\xe2\x80\x94who never feel it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought not to stay like this,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, when she had remained in\r\nthe position a long while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indulgence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill on the same tack! But is there anything better on earth than\r\nthat we should love one another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It depends on the sort of love; and yours\xe2\x80\x94ours\xe2\x80\x94is the wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have it, Sue! Come, when do you wish our marriage to be signed\r\nin a vestry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, and looked up uneasily. \xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\nNot knowing the whole of her meaning he took the objection serenely,\r\nand said nothing. Several minutes elapsed, and he thought she had\r\nfallen asleep; but he spoke softly, and found that she was wide awake\r\nall the time. She sat upright and sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a strange, indescribable perfume or atmosphere about you\r\nto-night, Sue,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean not only mentally, but about your\r\nclothes, also. A sort of vegetable scent, which I seem to know, yet\r\ncannot remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is incense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIncense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been to the service at St. Silas\xe2\x80\x99, and I was in the fumes of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94St. Silas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I go there sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed. You go there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Jude, it is lonely here in the weekday mornings, when you are\r\nat work, and I think and think of\xe2\x80\x94of my\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped till she could\r\ncontrol the lumpiness of her throat. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have taken to go in there,\r\nas it is so near.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well\xe2\x80\x94of course, I say nothing against it. Only it is odd, for you.\r\nThey little think what sort of chiel is amang them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94a sceptic, to be plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you pain me so, dear Jude, in my trouble! Yet I know you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it. But you ought not to say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t. But I am much surprised!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I want to tell you something else, Jude. You won\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, will\r\nyou? I have thought of it a good deal since my babies died. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I ought to be your wife\xe2\x80\x94or as your wife\xe2\x80\x94any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? \xe2\x80\xa6 But you _are_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom your point of view; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we were afraid of the ceremony, and a good many others would\r\nhave been in our places, with such strong reasons for fears. But\r\nexperience has proved how we misjudged ourselves, and overrated our\r\ninfirmities; and if you are beginning to respect rites and ceremonies,\r\nas you seem to be, I wonder you don\xe2\x80\x99t say it shall be carried out\r\ninstantly? You certainly _are_ my wife, Sue, in all but law. What do\r\nyou mean by what you said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot? But suppose we _had_ gone through the ceremony? Would you feel\r\nthat you were then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I should not feel even then that I was. I should feel worse than I\r\ndo now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so\xe2\x80\x94in the name of all that\xe2\x80\x99s perverse, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am Richard\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94you hinted that absurd fancy to me before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only an impression with me then; I feel more and more convinced\r\nas time goes on that\xe2\x80\x94I belong to him, or to nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good heavens\xe2\x80\x94how we are changing places!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Perhaps so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome few days later, in the dusk of the summer evening, they were\r\nsitting in the same small room downstairs, when a knock came to the\r\nfront door of the carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s house where they were lodging, and in a\r\nfew moments there was a tap at the door of their room. Before they\r\ncould open it the comer did so, and a woman\xe2\x80\x99s form appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mr. Fawley here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude and Sue started as he mechanically replied in the affirmative, for\r\nthe voice was Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHe formally requested her to come in, and she sat down in the window\r\nbench, where they could distinctly see her outline against the light;\r\nbut no characteristic that enabled them to estimate her general aspect\r\nand air. Yet something seemed to denote that she was not quite so\r\ncomfortably circumstanced, nor so bouncingly attired, as she had been\r\nduring Cartlett\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe three attempted an awkward conversation about the tragedy, of which\r\nJude had felt it to be his duty to inform her immediately, though she\r\nhad never replied to his letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just come from the cemetery,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI inquired and found\r\nthe child\xe2\x80\x99s grave. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to the funeral\xe2\x80\x94thank you for\r\ninviting me all the same. I read all about it in the papers, and I felt\r\nI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted\xe2\x80\xa6 No\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to the funeral,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Arabella,\r\nwho, seeming utterly unable to reach the ideal of a catastrophic\r\nmanner, fumbled with iterations. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am glad I found the grave. As\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis your trade, Jude, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to put up a handsome stone to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall put up a headstone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude drearily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was my child, and naturally I feel for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so. We all did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe others that weren\xe2\x80\x99t mine I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel so much for, as was\r\nnatural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sigh came from the dark corner where Sue sat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had often wished I had mine with me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Cartlett.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps \xe2\x80\x99twouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened then! But of course I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to\r\ntake him away from your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not his wife,\xe2\x80\x9d came from Sue.\r\n\r\nThe unexpectedness of her words struck Jude silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I beg your pardon, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude had known from the quality of Sue\xe2\x80\x99s tone that her new and\r\ntranscendental views lurked in her words; but all except their obvious\r\nmeaning was, naturally, missed by Arabella. The latter, after evincing\r\nthat she was struck by Sue\xe2\x80\x99s avowal, recovered herself, and went on to\r\ntalk with placid bluntness about \xe2\x80\x9cher\xe2\x80\x9d boy, for whom, though in his\r\nlifetime she had shown no care at all, she now exhibited a ceremonial\r\nmournfulness that was apparently sustaining to the conscience. She\r\nalluded to the past, and in making some remark appealed again to Sue.\r\nThere was no answer: Sue had invisibly left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said she was not your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Arabella in another voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should she do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot inform you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she? She once told me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t criticize what she says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94I see! Well, my time is up. I am staying here to-night, and thought\r\nI could do no less than call, after our mutual affliction. I am\r\nsleeping at the place where I used to be barmaid, and to-morrow I go\r\nback to Alfredston. Father is come home again, and I am living with\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has returned from Australia?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude with languid curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get on there. Had a rough time of it. Mother died of\r\ndys\xe2\x80\x94what do you call it\xe2\x80\x94in the hot weather, and Father and two of the\r\nyoung ones have just got back. He has got a cottage near the old place,\r\nand for the present I am keeping house for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s former wife had maintained a stereotyped manner of strict good\r\nbreeding even now that Sue was gone, and limited her stay to a number\r\nof minutes that should accord with the highest respectability. When she\r\nhad departed Jude, much relieved, went to the stairs and called\r\nSue\xe2\x80\x94feeling anxious as to what had become of her.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, and the carpenter who kept the lodgings said she\r\nhad not come in. Jude was puzzled, and became quite alarmed at her\r\nabsence, for the hour was growing late. The carpenter called his wife,\r\nwho conjectured that Sue might have gone to St. Silas\xe2\x80\x99 church, as she\r\noften went there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely not at this time o\xe2\x80\x99 night?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is shut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe knows somebody who keeps the key, and she has it whenever she\r\nwants it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long has she been going on with this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, some few weeks, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude went vaguely in the direction of the church, which he had never\r\nonce approached since he lived out that way years before, when his\r\nyoung opinions were more mystical than they were now. The spot was\r\ndeserted, but the door was certainly unfastened; he lifted the latch\r\nwithout noise, and pushing to the door behind him, stood absolutely\r\nstill inside. The prevalent silence seemed to contain a faint sound,\r\nexplicable as a breathing, or a sobbing, which came from the other end\r\nof the building. The floor-cloth deadened his footsteps as he moved in\r\nthat direction through the obscurity, which was broken only by the\r\nfaintest reflected night-light from without.\r\n\r\nHigh overhead, above the chancel steps, Jude could discern a huge,\r\nsolidly constructed Latin cross\xe2\x80\x94as large, probably, as the original it\r\nwas designed to commemorate. It seemed to be suspended in the air by\r\ninvisible wires; it was set with large jewels, which faintly glimmered\r\nin some weak ray caught from outside, as the cross swayed to and fro in\r\na silent and scarcely perceptible motion. Underneath, upon the floor,\r\nlay what appeared to be a heap of black clothes, and from this was\r\nrepeated the sobbing that he had heard before. It was his Sue\xe2\x80\x99s form,\r\nprostrate on the paving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\nSomething white disclosed itself; she had turned up her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94do you want with me here, Jude?\xe2\x80\x9d she said almost sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come! I wanted to be alone! Why did you intrude here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you ask!\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted in quick reproach, for his full heart\r\nwas wounded to its centre at this attitude of hers towards him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do\r\nI come? Who has a right to come, I should like to know, if I have not!\r\nI, who love you better than my own self\xe2\x80\x94better\xe2\x80\x94far better\xe2\x80\x94than you have\r\nloved me! What made you leave me to come here alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t criticize me, Jude\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it!\xe2\x80\x94I have often told you so.\r\nYou must take me as I am. I am a wretch\xe2\x80\x94broken by my distractions! I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t _bear_ it when Arabella came\xe2\x80\x94I felt so utterly miserable I had\r\nto come away. She seems to be your wife still, and Richard to be my\r\nhusband!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are nothing to us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear friend, they are. I see marriage differently now. My babies\r\nhave been taken from me to show me this! Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s child killing mine\r\nwas a judgement\xe2\x80\x94the right slaying the wrong. What, __ shall I do! I am\r\nsuch a vile creature\xe2\x80\x94too worthless to mix with ordinary human beings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, verging on tears. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is monstrous and\r\nunnatural for you to be so remorseful when you have done no wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t know my badness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe returned vehemently: \xe2\x80\x9cI do! Every atom and dreg of it! You make me\r\nhate Christianity, or mysticism, or Sacerdotalism, or whatever it may\r\nbe called, if it\xe2\x80\x99s that which has caused this deterioration in you.\r\nThat a woman-poet, a woman-seer, a woman whose soul shone like a\r\ndiamond\xe2\x80\x94whom all the wise of the world would have been proud of, if\r\nthey could have known you\xe2\x80\x94should degrade herself like this! I am glad I\r\nhad nothing to do with Divinity\xe2\x80\x94damn glad\xe2\x80\x94if it\xe2\x80\x99s going to ruin you in\r\nthis way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are angry, Jude, and unkind to me, and don\xe2\x80\x99t see how things are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen come along home with me, dearest, and perhaps I shall. I am\r\noverburdened\xe2\x80\x94and you, too, are unhinged just now.\xe2\x80\x9d He put his arm round\r\nher and lifted her; but though she came, she preferred to walk without\r\nhis support.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t dislike you, Jude,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a sweet and imploring voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you as much as ever! Only\xe2\x80\x94I ought not to love you\xe2\x80\x94any more. Oh\r\nI must not any more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t own it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have made up my mind that I am not your wife! I belong to him\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsacramentally joined myself to him for life. Nothing can alter it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely we are man and wife, if ever two people were in this world?\r\nNature\xe2\x80\x99s own marriage it is, unquestionably!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s. Another was made for me there, and ratified\r\neternally in the church at Melchester.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue, Sue\xe2\x80\x94affliction has brought you to this unreasonable state! After\r\nconverting me to your views on so many things, to find you suddenly\r\nturn to the right-about like this\xe2\x80\x94for no reason whatever, confounding\r\nall you have formerly said through sentiment merely! You root out of me\r\nwhat little affection and reverence I had left in me for the Church as\r\nan old acquaintance\xe2\x80\xa6 What I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand in you is your\r\nextraordinary blindness now to your old logic. Is it peculiar to you,\r\nor is it common to woman? Is a woman a thinking unit at all, or a\r\nfraction always wanting its integer? How you argued that marriage was\r\nonly a clumsy contract\xe2\x80\x94which it is\xe2\x80\x94how you showed all the objections to\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94all the absurdities! If two and two made four when we were happy\r\ntogether, surely they make four now? I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it, I repeat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dear Jude; that\xe2\x80\x99s because you are like a totally deaf man\r\nobserving people listening to music. You say \xe2\x80\x98What are they regarding?\r\nNothing is there.\xe2\x80\x99 But something is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a hard saying from you; and not a true parallel! You threw off\r\nold husks of prejudices, and taught me to do it; and now you go back\r\nupon yourself. I confess I am utterly stultified in my estimate of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear friend, my only friend, don\xe2\x80\x99t be hard with me! I can\xe2\x80\x99t help being\r\nas I am, I am convinced I am right\xe2\x80\x94that I see the light at last. But\r\noh, how to profit by it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked along a few more steps till they were outside the building\r\nand she had returned the key. \xe2\x80\x9cCan this be the girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude when\r\nshe came back, feeling a slight renewal of elasticity now that he was\r\nin the open street; \xe2\x80\x9ccan this be the girl who brought the pagan deities\r\ninto this most Christian city?\xe2\x80\x94who mimicked Miss Fontover when she\r\ncrushed them with her heel?\xe2\x80\x94quoted Gibbon, and Shelley, and Mill? Where\r\nare dear Apollo, and dear Venus now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t be so cruel to me, Jude, and I so unhappy!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it! I was in error\xe2\x80\x94I cannot reason with you. I\r\nwas wrong\xe2\x80\x94proud in my own conceit! Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s coming was the finish.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t satirize me: it cuts like a knife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flung his arms round her and kissed her passionately there in the\r\nsilent street, before she could hinder him. They went on till they came\r\nto a little coffee-house. \xe2\x80\x9cJude,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with suppressed tears,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwould you mind getting a lodging here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will\xe2\x80\x94if, if you really wish? But do you? Let me go to our door and\r\nunderstand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went and conducted her in. She said she wanted no supper, and went\r\nin the dark upstairs and struck a light. Turning she found that Jude\r\nhad followed her, and was standing at the chamber door. She went to\r\nhim, put her hand in his, and said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Sue! Don\xe2\x80\x99t we live here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you would do as I wished!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Very well! \xe2\x80\xa6 Perhaps it was wrong of me to argue distastefully as\r\nI have done! Perhaps as we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t conscientiously marry at first in\r\nthe old-fashioned way, we ought to have parted. Perhaps the world is\r\nnot illuminated enough for such experiments as ours! Who were we, to\r\nthink we could act as pioneers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad you see that much, at any rate. I never deliberately\r\nmeant to do as I did. I slipped into my false position through jealousy\r\nand agitation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely through love\xe2\x80\x94you loved me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But I wanted to let it stop there, and go on always as mere\r\nlovers; until\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut people in love couldn\xe2\x80\x99t live for ever like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen could: men can\xe2\x80\x99t, because they\xe2\x80\x94won\xe2\x80\x99t. An average woman is in\r\nthis superior to an average man\xe2\x80\x94that she never instigates, only\r\nresponds. We ought to have lived in mental communion, and no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was the unhappy cause of the change, as I have said before! \xe2\x80\xa6 Well,\r\nas you will! \xe2\x80\xa6 But human nature can\xe2\x80\x99t help being itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s just what it has to learn\xe2\x80\x94self-mastery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat\xe2\x80\x94if either were to blame it was not you but I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94it was I. Your wickedness was only the natural man\xe2\x80\x99s desire to\r\npossess the woman. Mine was not the reciprocal wish till envy\r\nstimulated me to oust Arabella. I had thought I ought in charity to let\r\nyou approach me\xe2\x80\x94that it was damnably selfish to torture you as I did my\r\nother friend. But I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have given way if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t broken me\r\ndown by making me fear you would go back to her\xe2\x80\xa6 But don\xe2\x80\x99t let us say\r\nany more about it! Jude, will you leave me to myself now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\xa6 But Sue\xe2\x80\x94my wife, as you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out; \xe2\x80\x9cmy old reproach to\r\nyou was, after all, a true one. You have never loved me as I love\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94never\xe2\x80\x94never! Yours is not a passionate heart\xe2\x80\x94your heart does not\r\nburn in a flame! You are, upon the whole, a sort of fay, or sprite\xe2\x80\x94not\r\na woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first I did not love you, Jude; that I own. When I first knew you I\r\nmerely wanted you to love me. I did not exactly flirt with you; but\r\nthat inborn craving which undermines some women\xe2\x80\x99s morals almost more\r\nthan unbridled passion\xe2\x80\x94the craving to attract and captivate, regardless\r\nof the injury it may do the man\xe2\x80\x94was in me; and when I found I had\r\ncaught you, I was frightened. And then\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it was\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to let you go\xe2\x80\x94possibly to Arabella again\xe2\x80\x94and so I got to\r\nlove you, Jude. But you see, however fondly it ended, it began in the\r\nselfish and cruel wish to make your heart ache for me without letting\r\nmine ache for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you add to your cruelty by leaving me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94yes! The further I flounder, the more harm I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d said he with a sudden sense of his own danger. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not do an\r\nimmoral thing for moral reasons! You have been my social salvation.\r\nStay with me for humanity\xe2\x80\x99s sake! You know what a weak fellow I am. My\r\ntwo arch-enemies you know\xe2\x80\x94my weakness for womankind and my impulse to\r\nstrong liquor. Don\xe2\x80\x99t abandon me to them, Sue, to save your own soul\r\nonly! They have been kept entirely at a distance since you became my\r\nguardian-angel! Since I have had you I have been able to go into any\r\ntemptations of the sort, without risk. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t my safety worth a little\r\nsacrifice of dogmatic principle? I am in terror lest, if you leave me,\r\nit will be with me another case of the pig that was washed turning back\r\nto his wallowing in the mire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue burst out weeping. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, but you must not, Jude! You won\xe2\x80\x99t! I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npray for you night and day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94never mind; don\xe2\x80\x99t grieve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude generously. \xe2\x80\x9cI did suffer,\r\nGod knows, about you at that time; and now I suffer again. But perhaps\r\nnot so much as you. The woman mostly gets the worst of it in the long\r\nrun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless she is absolutely worthless and contemptible. And this one is\r\nnot that, anyhow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue drew a nervous breath or two. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\xe2\x80\x94I fear! \xe2\x80\xa6 Now\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x94good-night,\xe2\x80\x94please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t stay?\xe2\x80\x94Not just once more? As it has been so many times\xe2\x80\x94O\r\nSue, my wife, why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94not wife! \xe2\x80\xa6 I am in your hands, Jude\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t tempt me back now I\r\nhave advanced so far!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I do your bidding. I owe that to you, darling, in penance\r\nfor how I overruled it at the first time. My God, how selfish I was!\r\nPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94perhaps I spoilt one of the highest and purest loves that ever\r\nexisted between man and woman! \xe2\x80\xa6 Then let the veil of our temple be\r\nrent in two from this hour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went to the bed, removed one of the pair of pillows thereon, and\r\nflung it to the floor.\r\n\r\nSue looked at him, and bending over the bed-rail wept silently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see that it is a matter of conscience with me, and not of dislike\r\nto you!\xe2\x80\x9d she brokenly murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cDislike to you! But I can\xe2\x80\x99t say any\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94it breaks my heart\xe2\x80\x94it will be undoing all I have begun!\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x94good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and turned to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh but you shall kiss me!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, starting up. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94bear\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clasped her, and kissed her weeping face as he had scarcely ever\r\ndone before, and they remained in silence till she said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\r\ngood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d And then gently pressing him away she got free, trying to\r\nmitigate the sadness by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be dear friends just the same,\r\nJude, won\xe2\x80\x99t we? And we\xe2\x80\x99ll see each other sometimes\xe2\x80\x94yes!\xe2\x80\x94and forget all\r\nthis, and try to be as we were long ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude did not permit himself to speak, but turned and descended the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man whom Sue, in her mental _volte-face_, was now regarding as her\r\ninseparable husband, lived still at Marygreen.\r\n\r\nOn the day before the tragedy of the children, Phillotson had seen both\r\nher and Jude as they stood in the rain at Christminster watching the\r\nprocession to the theatre. But he had said nothing of it at the moment\r\nto his companion Gillingham, who, being an old friend, was staying with\r\nhim at the village aforesaid, and had, indeed, suggested the day\xe2\x80\x99s trip\r\nto Christminster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gillingham, as they went home. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nuniversity degree you never obtained?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson gruffly. \xe2\x80\x9cOf somebody I saw to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d In a\r\nmoment he added, \xe2\x80\x9cSusanna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw her, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to draw your attention to her. But, as you did see her,\r\nyou should have said: \xe2\x80\x98How d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, my dear-that-was?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well. I might have. But what do you think of this: I have good\r\nreason for supposing that she was innocent when I divorced her\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\nwas all wrong. Yes, indeed! Awkward, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has taken care to set you right since, anyhow, apparently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m. That\xe2\x80\x99s a cheap sneer. I ought to have waited, unquestionably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week, when Gillingham had gone back to his school\r\nnear Shaston, Phillotson, as was his custom, went to Alfredston market;\r\nruminating again on Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence as he walked down the long\r\nhill which he had known before Jude knew it, though his history had not\r\nbeaten so intensely upon its incline. Arrived in the town he bought his\r\nusual weekly local paper; and when he had sat down in an inn to refresh\r\nhimself for the five miles\xe2\x80\x99 walk back, he pulled the paper from his\r\npocket and read awhile. The account of the \xe2\x80\x9cstrange suicide of a\r\nstone-mason\xe2\x80\x99s children\xe2\x80\x9d met his eye.\r\n\r\nUnimpassioned as he was, it impressed him painfully, and puzzled him\r\nnot a little, for he could not understand the age of the elder child\r\nbeing what it was stated to be. However, there was no doubt that the\r\nnewspaper report was in some way true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir cup of sorrow is now full!\xe2\x80\x9d he said: and thought and thought of\r\nSue, and what she had gained by leaving him.\r\n\r\nArabella having made her home at Alfredston, and the schoolmaster\r\ncoming to market there every Saturday, it was not wonderful that in a\r\nfew weeks they met again\xe2\x80\x94the precise time being just after her return\r\nfrom Christminster, where she had stayed much longer than she had at\r\nfirst intended, keeping an interested eye on Jude, though Jude had seen\r\nno more of her. Phillotson was on his way homeward when he encountered\r\nArabella, and she was approaching the town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like walking out this way, Mrs. Cartlett?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just begun to again,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is where I lived as maid\r\nand wife, and all the past things of my life that are interesting to my\r\nfeelings are mixed up with this road. And they have been stirred up in\r\nme too, lately; for I\xe2\x80\x99ve been visiting at Christminster. Yes; I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nJude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! How do they bear their terrible affliction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a ve-ry strange way\xe2\x80\x94ve-ry strange! She don\xe2\x80\x99t live with him any\r\nlonger. I only heard of it as a certainty just before I left; though I\r\nhad thought things were drifting that way from their manner when I\r\ncalled on them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot live with her husband? Why, I should have thought \xe2\x80\x99twould have\r\nunited them more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not her husband, after all. She has never really married him\r\nalthough they have passed as man and wife so long. And now, instead of\r\nthis sad event making \xe2\x80\x99em hurry up, and get the thing done legally,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s took in a queer religious way, just as I was in my affliction at\r\nlosing Cartlett, only hers is of a more \xe2\x80\x99sterical sort than mine. And\r\nshe says, so I was told, that she\xe2\x80\x99s your wife in the eye of Heaven and\r\nthe Church\xe2\x80\x94yours only; and can\xe2\x80\x99t be anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s by any act of man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94indeed? \xe2\x80\xa6 Separated, have they!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, the eldest boy was mine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, poor little fellow\xe2\x80\x94born in lawful wedlock, thank God. And perhaps\r\nshe feels, over and above other things, that I ought to have been in\r\nher place. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. However, as for me, I am soon off from here.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got Father to look after now, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t live in such a hum-drum\r\nplace as this. I hope soon to be in a bar again at Christminster, or\r\nsome other big town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey parted. When Phillotson had ascended the hill a few steps he\r\nstopped, hastened back, and called her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is, or was, their address?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella gave it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. Good afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella smiled grimly as she resumed her way, and practised\r\ndimple-making all along the road from where the pollard willows begin\r\nto the old almshouses in the first street of the town.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Phillotson ascended to Marygreen, and for the first time\r\nduring a lengthened period he lived with a forward eye. On crossing\r\nunder the large trees of the green to the humble schoolhouse to which\r\nhe had been reduced he stood a moment, and pictured Sue coming out of\r\nthe door to meet him. No man had ever suffered more inconvenience from\r\nhis own charity, Christian or heathen, than Phillotson had done in\r\nletting Sue go. He had been knocked about from pillar to post at the\r\nhands of the virtuous almost beyond endurance; he had been nearly\r\nstarved, and was now dependent entirely upon the very small stipend\r\nfrom the school of this village (where the parson had got ill-spoken of\r\nfor befriending him). He had often thought of Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s remarks that\r\nhe should have been more severe with Sue, that her recalcitrant spirit\r\nwould soon have been broken. Yet such was his obstinate and illogical\r\ndisregard of opinion, and of the principles in which he had been\r\ntrained, that his convictions on the rightness of his course with his\r\nwife had not been disturbed.\r\n\r\nPrinciples which could be subverted by feeling in one direction were\r\nliable to the same catastrophe in another. The instincts which had\r\nallowed him to give Sue her liberty now enabled him to regard her as\r\nnone the worse for her life with Jude. He wished for her still, in his\r\ncurious way, if he did not love her, and, apart from policy, soon felt\r\nthat he would be gratified to have her again as his, always provided\r\nthat she came willingly.\r\n\r\nBut artifice was necessary, he had found, for stemming the cold and\r\ninhumane blast of the world\xe2\x80\x99s contempt. And here were the materials\r\nready made. By getting Sue back and remarrying her on the respectable\r\nplea of having entertained erroneous views of her, and gained his\r\ndivorce wrongfully, he might acquire some comfort, resume his old\r\ncourses, perhaps return to the Shaston school, if not even to the\r\nChurch as a licentiate.\r\n\r\nHe thought he would write to Gillingham to inquire his views, and what\r\nhe thought of his, Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s, sending a letter to her. Gillingham\r\nreplied, naturally, that now she was gone it were best to let her be,\r\nand considered that if she were anybody\xe2\x80\x99s wife she was the wife of the\r\nman to whom she had borne three children and owed such tragical\r\nadventures. Probably, as his attachment to her seemed unusually strong,\r\nthe singular pair would make their union legal in course of time, and\r\nall would be well, and decent, and in order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94Sue won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Phillotson to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGillingham is so matter of fact. She\xe2\x80\x99s affected by Christminster\r\nsentiment and teaching. I can see her views on the indissolubility of\r\nmarriage well enough, and I know where she got them. They are not mine;\r\nbut I shall make use of them to further mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrote a brief reply to Gillingham. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I am entirely wrong, but\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you. As to her having lived with and had three\r\nchildren by him, my feeling is (though I can advance no logical or\r\nmoral defence of it, on the old lines) that it has done little more\r\nthan finish her education. I shall write to her, and learn whether what\r\nthat woman said is true or no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he had made up his mind to do this before he had written to his\r\nfriend, there had not been much reason for writing to the latter at\r\nall. However, it was Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s way to act thus.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly addressed a carefully considered epistle to Sue, and,\r\nknowing her emotional temperament, threw a Rhadamanthine strictness\r\ninto the lines here and there, carefully hiding his heterodox feelings,\r\nnot to frighten her. He stated that, it having come to his knowledge\r\nthat her views had considerably changed, he felt compelled to say that\r\nhis own, too, were largely modified by events subsequent to their\r\nparting. He would not conceal from her that passionate love had little\r\nto do with his communication. It arose from a wish to make their lives,\r\nif not a success, at least no such disastrous failure as they\r\nthreatened to become, through his acting on what he had considered at\r\nthe time a principle of justice, charity, and reason.\r\n\r\nTo indulge one\xe2\x80\x99s instinctive and uncontrolled sense of justice and\r\nright, was not, he had found, permitted with impunity in an old\r\ncivilization like ours. It was necessary to act under an acquired and\r\ncultivated sense of the same, if you wished to enjoy an average share\r\nof comfort and honour; and to let crude loving kindness take care of\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nHe suggested that she should come to him there at Marygreen.\r\n\r\nOn second thoughts he took out the last paragraph but one; and having\r\nrewritten the letter he dispatched it immediately, and in some\r\nexcitement awaited the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after a figure moved through the white fog which enveloped\r\nthe Beersheba suburb of Christminster, towards the quarter in which\r\nJude Fawley had taken up his lodging since his division from Sue. A\r\ntimid knock sounded upon the door of his abode.\r\n\r\nIt was evening\xe2\x80\x94so he was at home; and by a species of divination he\r\njumped up and rushed to the door himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come out with me? I would rather not come in. I want to\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ntalk with you\xe2\x80\x94and to go with you to the cemetery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had been in the trembling accents of Sue that these words came. Jude\r\nput on his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is dreary for you to be out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you\r\nprefer not to come in, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I do. I shall not keep you long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude was too much affected to go on talking at first; she, too, was now\r\nsuch a mere cluster of nerves that all initiatory power seemed to have\r\nleft her, and they proceeded through the fog like Acherontic shades for\r\na long while, without sound or gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently said, her voice now quick, now\r\nslow, \xe2\x80\x9cso that you may not hear of it by chance. I am going back to\r\nRichard. He has\xe2\x80\x94so magnanimously\xe2\x80\x94agreed to forgive all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing back? How can you go\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is going to marry me again. That is for form\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and to satisfy\r\nthe world, which does not see things as they are. But of course I _am_\r\nhis wife already. Nothing has changed that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned upon her with an anguish that was well-nigh fierce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are _my_ wife! Yes, you are. You know it. I have always\r\nregretted that feint of ours in going away and pretending to come back\r\nlegally married, to save appearances. I loved you, and you loved me;\r\nand we closed with each other; and that made the marriage. We still\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x94you as well as I\xe2\x80\x94_know_ it, Sue! Therefore our marriage is not\r\ncancelled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I know how you see it,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered with despairing\r\nself-suppression. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am going to marry him again, as it would be\r\ncalled by you. Strictly speaking you, too\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my saying it,\r\nJude!\xe2\x80\x94you should take back\xe2\x80\x94Arabella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should? Good God\xe2\x80\x94what next! But how if you and I had married\r\nlegally, as we were on the point of doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have felt just the same\xe2\x80\x94that ours was not a marriage. And I\r\nwould go back to Richard without repeating the sacrament, if he asked\r\nme. But \xe2\x80\x98the world and its ways have a certain worth\xe2\x80\x99 (I suppose),\r\ntherefore I concede a repetition of the ceremony\xe2\x80\xa6 Don\xe2\x80\x99t crush all the\r\nlife out of me by satire and argument, I implore you! I was strongest\r\nonce, I know, and perhaps I treated you cruelly. But Jude, return good\r\nfor evil! I am the weaker now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t retaliate upon me, but be kind. Oh\r\nbe kind to me\xe2\x80\x94a poor wicked woman who is trying to mend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head hopelessly, his eyes wet. The blow of her bereavement\r\nseemed to have destroyed her reasoning faculty. The once keen vision\r\nwas dimmed. \xe2\x80\x9cAll wrong, all wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d he said huskily. \xe2\x80\x9cError\xe2\x80\x94perversity!\r\nIt drives me out of my senses. Do you care for him? Do you love him?\r\nYou know you don\xe2\x80\x99t! It will be a fanatic prostitution\xe2\x80\x94God forgive me,\r\nyes\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t love him\xe2\x80\x94I must, must, own it, in deepest remorse! But I shall\r\ntry to learn to love him by obeying him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude argued, urged, implored; but her conviction was proof against all.\r\nIt seemed to be the one thing on earth on which she was firm, and that\r\nher firmness in this had left her tottering in every other impulse and\r\nwish she possessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been considerate enough to let you know the whole truth, and to\r\ntell it you myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in cut tones; \xe2\x80\x9cthat you might not\r\nconsider yourself slighted by hearing of it at second hand. I have even\r\nowned the extreme fact that I do not love him. I did not think you\r\nwould be so rough with me for doing so! I was going to ask you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo give you away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. To send\xe2\x80\x94my boxes to me\xe2\x80\x94if you would. But I suppose you won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course I will. What\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t he coming to fetch you\xe2\x80\x94to marry you\r\nfrom here? He won\xe2\x80\x99t condescend to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t let him. I go to him voluntarily, just as I went away from\r\nhim. We are to be married at his little church at Marygreen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was so sadly sweet in what he called her wrong-headedness that Jude\r\ncould not help being moved to tears more than once for pity of her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever knew such a woman for doing impulsive penances, as you, Sue! No\r\nsooner does one expect you to go straight on, as the one rational\r\nproceeding, than you double round the corner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well; let that go! \xe2\x80\xa6 Jude, I must say good-bye! But I wanted you\r\nto go to the cemetery with me. Let our farewell be there\xe2\x80\x94beside the\r\ngraves of those who died to bring home to me the error of my views.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey turned in the direction of the place, and the gate was opened to\r\nthem on application. Sue had been there often, and she knew the way to\r\nthe spot in the dark. They reached it, and stood still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is here\xe2\x80\x94I should like to part,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think me hard because I have acted on conviction. Your generous\r\ndevotion to me is unparalleled, Jude! Your worldly failure, if you have\r\nfailed, is to your credit rather than to your blame. Remember that the\r\nbest and greatest among mankind are those who do themselves no worldly\r\ngood. Every successful man is more or less a selfish man. The devoted\r\nfail\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98Charity seeketh not her own.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that chapter we are at one, ever beloved darling, and on it we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npart friends. Its verses will stand fast when all the rest that you\r\ncall religion has passed away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss it. Good-bye, Jude; my fellow-sinner, and kindest\r\nfriend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, my mistaken wife. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon the familiar Christminster fog still hung over all\r\nthings. Sue\xe2\x80\x99s slim shape was only just discernible going towards the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nJude had no heart to go to his work that day. Neither could he go\r\nanywhere in the direction by which she would be likely to pass. He went\r\nin an opposite one, to a dreary, strange, flat scene, where boughs\r\ndripped, and coughs and consumption lurked, and where he had never been\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue\xe2\x80\x99s gone from me\xe2\x80\x94gone!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured miserably.\r\n\r\nShe in the meantime had left by the train, and reached Alfredston Road,\r\nwhere she entered the steam-tram and was conveyed into the town. It had\r\nbeen her request to Phillotson that he should not meet her. She wished,\r\nshe said, to come to him voluntarily, to his very house and\r\nhearthstone.\r\n\r\nIt was Friday evening, which had been chosen because the schoolmaster\r\nwas disengaged at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock that day till the Monday morning\r\nfollowing. The little car she hired at the Bear to drive her to\r\nMarygreen set her down at the end of the lane, half a mile from the\r\nvillage, by her desire, and preceded her to the schoolhouse with such\r\nportion of her luggage as she had brought. On its return she\r\nencountered it, and asked the driver if he had found the master\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nopen. The man informed her that he had, and that her things had been\r\ntaken in by the schoolmaster himself.\r\n\r\nShe could now enter Marygreen without exciting much observation. She\r\ncrossed by the well and under the trees to the pretty new school on the\r\nother side, and lifted the latch of the dwelling without knocking.\r\nPhillotson stood in the middle of the room, awaiting her, as requested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come, Richard,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, looking pale and shaken, and sinking\r\ninto a chair. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot believe\xe2\x80\x94you forgive your\xe2\x80\x94wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything, darling Susanna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson.\r\n\r\nShe started at the endearment, though it had been spoken advisedly\r\nwithout fervour. Then she nerved herself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy children\xe2\x80\x94are dead\xe2\x80\x94and it is right that they should be! I am\r\nglad\xe2\x80\x94almost. They were sin-begotten. They were sacrificed to teach me\r\nhow to live! Their death was the first stage of my purification. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhy they have not died in vain! \xe2\x80\xa6 You will take me back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was so stirred by her pitiful words and tone that he did more than\r\nhe had meant to do. He bent and kissed her cheek.\r\n\r\nSue imperceptibly shrank away, her flesh quivering under the touch of\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\nPhillotson\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank, for desire was renascent in him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou still\r\nhave an aversion to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, dear\xe2\x80\x94I have been driving through the damp, and I was chilly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, with a hurried smile of apprehension. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen are we going to\r\nhave the marriage? Soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning, early, I thought\xe2\x80\x94if you really wish. I am sending\r\nround to the vicar to let him know you are come. I have told him all,\r\nand he highly approves\xe2\x80\x94he says it will bring our lives to a triumphant\r\nand satisfactory issue. But\xe2\x80\x94are you sure of yourself? It is not too\r\nlate to refuse now if\xe2\x80\x94you think you can\xe2\x80\x99t bring yourself to it, you\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I can! I want it done quick. Tell him, tell him at once! My\r\nstrength is tried by the undertaking\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave something to eat and drink then, and go over to your room at Mrs.\r\nEdlin\xe2\x80\x99s. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the vicar half-past eight to-morrow, before anybody\r\nis about\xe2\x80\x94if that\xe2\x80\x99s not too soon for you? My friend Gillingham is here\r\nto help us in the ceremony. He\xe2\x80\x99s been good enough to come all the way\r\nfrom Shaston at great inconvenience to himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnlike a woman in ordinary, whose eye is so keen for material things,\r\nSue seemed to see nothing of the room they were in, or any detail of\r\nher environment. But on moving across the parlour to put down her muff\r\nshe uttered a little \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d and grew paler than before. Her look was\r\nthat of the condemned criminal who catches sight of his coffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson.\r\n\r\nThe flap of the bureau chanced to be open, and in placing her muff upon\r\nit her eye had caught a document which lay there. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94only a\xe2\x80\x94funny\r\nsurprise!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, trying to laugh away her cry as she came back to\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson. \xe2\x80\x9cThe licence\xe2\x80\xa6 It has just come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGillingham now joined them from his room above, and Sue nervously made\r\nherself agreeable to him by talking on whatever she thought likely to\r\ninterest him, except herself, though that interested him most of all.\r\nShe obediently ate some supper, and prepared to leave for her lodging\r\nhard by. Phillotson crossed the green with her, bidding her good-night\r\nat Mrs. Edlin\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nThe old woman accompanied Sue to her temporary quarters, and helped her\r\nto unpack. Among other things she laid out a night-gown tastefully\r\nembroidered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know _that_ was put in!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nit to be. Here is a different one.\xe2\x80\x9d She handed a new and absolutely\r\nplain garment, of coarse and unbleached calico.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is the prettiest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Edlin. \xe2\x80\x9cThat one is no better\r\nthan very sackcloth o\xe2\x80\x99 Scripture!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I meant it to be. Give me the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it, and began rending it with all her might, the tears\r\nresounding through the house like a screech-owl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my dear, dear!\xe2\x80\x94whatever....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is adulterous! It signifies what I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel\xe2\x80\x94I bought it long\r\nago\xe2\x80\x94to please Jude. It must be destroyed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Edlin lifted her hands, and Sue excitedly continued to tear the\r\nlinen into strips, laying the pieces in the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou med ha\xe2\x80\x99 give it to me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow. \xe2\x80\x9cIt do make my heart ache\r\nto see such pretty open-work as that a-burned by the flames\xe2\x80\x94not that\r\nornamental night-rails can be much use to a\xe2\x80\x99 ould \xe2\x80\x99ooman like I. My\r\ndays for such be all past and gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an accursed thing\xe2\x80\x94it reminds me of what I want to forget!\xe2\x80\x9d Sue\r\nrepeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only fit for the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, you be too strict! What do ye use such words for, and condemn to\r\nhell your dear little innocent children that\xe2\x80\x99s lost to \xe2\x80\x99ee! Upon my\r\nlife I don\xe2\x80\x99t call that religion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue flung her face upon the bed, sobbing. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t! That kills\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d She remained shaken with her grief, and slipped down upon her\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell \xe2\x80\x99ee what\xe2\x80\x94you ought not to marry this man again!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nEdlin indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are in love wi\xe2\x80\x99 t\xe2\x80\x99 other still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I must\xe2\x80\x94I am his already!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshoo! You be t\xe2\x80\x99 other man\xe2\x80\x99s. If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to commit yourselves\r\nto the binding vow again, just at first, \xe2\x80\x99twas all the more credit to\r\nyour consciences, considering your reasons, and you med ha\xe2\x80\x99 lived on,\r\nand made it all right at last. After all, it concerned nobody but your\r\nown two selves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichard says he\xe2\x80\x99ll have me back, and I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to go! If he had\r\nrefused, it might not have been so much my duty to\xe2\x80\x94give up Jude. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe remained with her face in the bed-clothes, and Mrs. Edlin left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nPhillotson in the interval had gone back to his friend Gillingham, who\r\nstill sat over the supper-table. They soon rose, and walked out on the\r\ngreen to smoke awhile. A light was burning in Sue\xe2\x80\x99s room, a shadow\r\nmoving now and then across the blind.\r\n\r\nGillingham had evidently been impressed with the indefinable charm of\r\nSue, and after a silence he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell: you\xe2\x80\x99ve all but got her again\r\nat last. She can\xe2\x80\x99t very well go a second time. The pear has dropped\r\ninto your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! \xe2\x80\xa6 I suppose I am right in taking her at her word. I confess there\r\nseems a touch of selfishness in it. Apart from her being what she is,\r\nof course, a luxury for a fogey like me, it will set me right in the\r\neyes of the clergy and orthodox laity, who have never forgiven me for\r\nletting her go. So I may get back in some degree into my old track.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got any sound reason for marrying her again, do it now\r\nin God\xe2\x80\x99s name! I was always against your opening the cage-door and\r\nletting the bird go in such an obviously suicidal way. You might have\r\nbeen a school inspector by this time, or a reverend, if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nso weak about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did myself irreparable damage\xe2\x80\x94I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce you\xe2\x80\x99ve got her housed again, stick to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhillotson was more evasive to-night. He did not care to admit clearly\r\nthat his taking Sue to him again had at bottom nothing to do with\r\nrepentance of letting her go, but was, primarily, a human instinct\r\nflying in the face of custom and profession. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I shall do\r\nthat. I know woman better now. Whatever justice there was in releasing\r\nher, there was little logic, for one holding my views on other\r\nsubjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGillingham looked at him, and wondered whether it would ever happen\r\nthat the reactionary spirit induced by the world\xe2\x80\x99s sneers and his own\r\nphysical wishes would make Phillotson more orthodoxly cruel to her than\r\nhe had erstwhile been informally and perversely kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perceive it won\xe2\x80\x99t do to give way to impulse,\xe2\x80\x9d Phillotson resumed,\r\nfeeling more and more every minute the necessity of acting up to his\r\nposition. \xe2\x80\x9cI flew in the face of the Church\xe2\x80\x99s teaching; but I did it\r\nwithout malice prepense. Women are so strange in their influence that\r\nthey tempt you to misplaced kindness. However, I know myself better\r\nnow. A little judicious severity, perhaps\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but you must tighten the reins by degrees only. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be too\r\nstrenuous at first. She\xe2\x80\x99ll come to any terms in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe caution was unnecessary, though Phillotson did not say so. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nremember what my vicar at Shaston said, when I left after the row that\r\nwas made about my agreeing to her elopement. \xe2\x80\x98The only thing you can do\r\nto retrieve your position and hers is to admit your error in not\r\nrestraining her with a wise and strong hand, and to get her back again\r\nif she\xe2\x80\x99ll come, and be firm in the future.\xe2\x80\x99 But I was so headstrong at\r\nthat time that I paid no heed. And that after the divorce she should\r\nhave thought of doing so I did not dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gate of Mrs. Edlin\xe2\x80\x99s cottage clicked, and somebody began crossing\r\nin the direction of the school. Phillotson said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is that Mr. Phillotson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Edlin. \xe2\x80\x9cI was going over to see\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been upstairs with her, helping her to unpack her things; and\r\nupon my word, sir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this ought to be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94the wedding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She\xe2\x80\x99s forcing herself to it, poor dear little thing; and you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nno notion what she\xe2\x80\x99s suffering. I was never much for religion nor\r\nagainst it, but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be right to let her do this, and you ought to\r\npersuade her out of it. Of course everybody will say it was very good\r\nand forgiving of \xe2\x80\x99ee to take her to \xe2\x80\x99ee again. But for my part I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s her wish, and I am willing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson with grave reserve,\r\nopposition making him illogically tenacious now. \xe2\x80\x9cA great piece of\r\nlaxity will be rectified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. She\xe2\x80\x99s his wife if anybody\xe2\x80\x99s. She\xe2\x80\x99s had three\r\nchildren by him, and he loves her dearly; and it\xe2\x80\x99s a wicked shame to\r\negg her on to this, poor little quivering thing! She\xe2\x80\x99s got nobody on\r\nher side. The one man who\xe2\x80\x99d be her friend the obstinate creature won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nallow to come near her. What first put her into this mood o\xe2\x80\x99 mind, I\r\nwonder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell. Not I certainly. It is all voluntary on her part. Now\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all I have to say.\xe2\x80\x9d Phillotson spoke stiffly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve turned\r\nround, Mrs. Edlin. It is unseemly of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I knowed you\xe2\x80\x99d be affronted at what I had to say; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind that. The truth\xe2\x80\x99s the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not affronted, Mrs. Edlin. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been too kind a neighbour for\r\nthat. But I must be allowed to know what\xe2\x80\x99s best for myself and Susanna.\r\nI suppose you won\xe2\x80\x99t go to church with us, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Be hanged if I can\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the times be coming to!\r\nMatrimony have growed to be that serious in these days that one really\r\ndo feel afeard to move in it at all. In my time we took it more\r\ncareless; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we was any the worse for it! When I and\r\nmy poor man were jined in it we kept up the junketing all the week, and\r\ndrunk the parish dry, and had to borrow half a crown to begin\r\nhousekeeping!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Edlin had gone back to her cottage Phillotson spoke moodily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I ought to do it\xe2\x80\x94at any rate quite so rapidly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she is really compelling herself to this against her\r\ninstincts\xe2\x80\x94merely from this new sense of duty or religion\xe2\x80\x94I ought\r\nperhaps to let her wait a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99ve got so far you ought not to back out of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nopinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t very well put it off now; that\xe2\x80\x99s true. But I had a qualm when\r\nshe gave that little cry at sight of the licence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, never you have qualms, old boy. I mean to give her away to-morrow\r\nmorning, and you mean to take her. It has always been on my conscience\r\nthat I didn\xe2\x80\x99t urge more objections to your letting her go, and now\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to this stage I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be content if I don\xe2\x80\x99t help you to set\r\nthe matter right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhillotson nodded, and seeing how staunch his friend was, became more\r\nfrank. \xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt when it gets known what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done I shall be thought a\r\nsoft fool by many. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t know Sue as I do. Though so elusive,\r\nhers is such an honest nature at bottom that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she has ever\r\ndone anything against her conscience. The fact of her having lived with\r\nFawley goes for nothing. At the time she left me for him she thought\r\nshe was quite within her right. Now she thinks otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning came, and the self-sacrifice of the woman on the altar\r\nof what she was pleased to call her principles was acquiesced in by\r\nthese two friends, each from his own point of view. Phillotson went\r\nacross to the Widow Edlin\xe2\x80\x99s to fetch Sue a few minutes after eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. The fog of the previous day or two on the low-lands had\r\ntravelled up here by now, and the trees on the green caught armfuls,\r\nand turned them into showers of big drops. The bride was waiting,\r\nready; bonnet and all on. She had never in her life looked so much like\r\nthe lily her name connoted as she did in that pallid morning light.\r\nChastened, world-weary, remorseful, the strain on her nerves had preyed\r\nupon her flesh and bones, and she appeared smaller in outline than she\r\nhad formerly done, though Sue had not been a large woman in her days of\r\nrudest health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrompt,\xe2\x80\x9d said the schoolmaster, magnanimously taking her hand. But he\r\nchecked his impulse to kiss her, remembering her start of yesterday,\r\nwhich unpleasantly lingered in his mind.\r\n\r\nGillingham joined them, and they left the house, Widow Edlin continuing\r\nsteadfast in her refusal to assist in the ceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the church?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue. She had not lived there for any length\r\nof time since the old church was pulled down, and in her preoccupation\r\nforgot the new one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillotson; and presently the tower loomed large and\r\nsolemn in the fog. The vicar had already crossed to the building, and\r\nwhen they entered he said pleasantly: \xe2\x80\x9cWe almost want candles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do\xe2\x80\x94wish me to be yours, Richard?\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Sue in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, dear; above all things in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue said no more; and for the second or third time he felt he was not\r\nquite following out the humane instinct which had induced him to let\r\nher go.\r\n\r\nThere they stood, five altogether: the parson, the clerk, the couple,\r\nand Gillingham; and the holy ordinance was resolemnized forthwith. In\r\nthe nave of the edifice were two or three villagers, and when the\r\nclergyman came to the words, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat God hath joined,\xe2\x80\x9d a woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nfrom among these was heard to utter audibly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod hath jined indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was like a re-enactment by the ghosts of their former selves of the\r\nsimilar scene which had taken place at Melchester years before. When\r\nthe books were signed the vicar congratulated the husband and wife on\r\nhaving performed a noble, and righteous, and mutually forgiving act.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cMay you long be happy\r\ntogether, after thus having been \xe2\x80\x98saved as by fire.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey came down the nearly empty building, and crossed to the\r\nschoolhouse. Gillingham wanted to get home that night, and left early.\r\nHe, too, congratulated the couple. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in parting from\r\nPhillotson, who walked out a little way, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be able to tell the\r\npeople in your native place a good round tale; and they\xe2\x80\x99ll all say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done,\xe2\x80\x99 depend on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the schoolmaster got back Sue was making a pretence of doing some\r\nhousewifery as if she lived there. But she seemed timid at his\r\napproach, and compunction wrought on him at sight of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, my dear, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t expect to intrude upon your personal\r\nprivacy any more than I did before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is for our\r\ngood socially to do this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s its justification, if it was not\r\nmy reason.\xe2\x80\x9d Sue brightened a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place was the door of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s lodging in the out-skirts of\r\nChristminster\xe2\x80\x94far from the precincts of St. Silas\xe2\x80\x99 where he had\r\nformerly lived, which saddened him to sickness. The rain was coming\r\ndown. A woman in shabby black stood on the doorstep talking to Jude,\r\nwho held the door in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am lonely, destitute, and houseless\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I am! Father has\r\nturned me out of doors after borrowing every penny I\xe2\x80\x99d got, to put it\r\ninto his business, and then accusing me of laziness when I was only\r\nwaiting for a situation. I am at the mercy of the world! If you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake me and help me, Jude, I must go to the workhouse, or to something\r\nworse. Only just now two undergraduates winked at me as I came along.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis hard for a woman to keep virtuous where there\xe2\x80\x99s so many young\r\nmen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman in the rain who spoke thus was Arabella, the evening being\r\nthat of the day after Sue\xe2\x80\x99s remarriage with Phillotson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for you, but I am only in lodgings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you turn me away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you enough to get food and lodging for a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but can\xe2\x80\x99t you have the kindness to take me in? I cannot endure\r\ngoing to a public house to lodge; and I am so lonely. Please, Jude, for\r\nold times\xe2\x80\x99 sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be reminded of those\r\nthings; and if you talk about them I shall not help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I suppose I must go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. She bent her head against\r\nthe doorpost and began sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house is full,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have only a little extra room to\r\nmy own\xe2\x80\x94not much more than a closet\xe2\x80\x94where I keep my tools, and\r\ntemplates, and the few books I have left!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a palace for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no bedstead in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bit of a bed could be made on the floor. It would be good enough for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnable to be harsh with her, and not knowing what to do, Jude called\r\nthe man who let the lodgings, and said this was an acquaintance of his\r\nin great distress for want of temporary shelter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may remember me as barmaid at the Lamb and Flag formerly?\xe2\x80\x9d spoke\r\nup Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father has insulted me this afternoon, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve left\r\nhim, though without a penny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe householder said he could not recall her features. \xe2\x80\x9cBut still, if\r\nyou are a friend of Mr. Fawley\xe2\x80\x99s we\xe2\x80\x99ll do what we can for a day or\r\ntwo\xe2\x80\x94if he\xe2\x80\x99ll make himself answerable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has really taken me quite unawares; but I\r\nshould wish to help her out of her difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d And an arrangement was\r\nultimately come to under which a bed was to be thrown down in Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlumber-room, to make it comfortable for Arabella till she could get out\r\nof the strait she was in\xe2\x80\x94not by her own fault, as she declared\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nreturn to her father\xe2\x80\x99s again.\r\n\r\nWhile they were waiting for this to be done Arabella said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nthe news, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess what you mean; but I know nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a letter from Anny at Alfredston to-day. She had just heard that\r\nthe wedding was to be yesterday: but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if it had come\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to talk of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no: of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Only it shows what kind of woman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak of her I say! She\xe2\x80\x99s a fool! And she\xe2\x80\x99s an angel, too, poor\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s done, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance of getting back to his old position,\r\nby everybody\xe2\x80\x99s account, so Anny says. All his well-wishers will be\r\npleased, including the bishop himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo spare me, Arabella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella was duly installed in the little attic, and at first she did\r\nnot come near Jude at all. She went to and fro about her own business,\r\nwhich, when they met for a moment on the stairs or in the passage, she\r\ninformed him was that of obtaining another place in the occupation she\r\nunderstood best. When Jude suggested London as affording the most\r\nlikely opening in the liquor trade, she shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ntemptations are too many,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAny humble tavern in the country\r\nbefore that for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday morning following, when he breakfasted later than on\r\nother days, she meekly asked him if she might come in to breakfast with\r\nhim, as she had broken her teapot, and could not replace it\r\nimmediately, the shops being shut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d he said indifferently.\r\n\r\nWhile they sat without speaking she suddenly observed: \xe2\x80\x9cYou seem all in\r\na brood, old man. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am all in a brood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is about her, I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s no business of mine, but I could find\r\nout all about the wedding\xe2\x80\x94if it really did take place\xe2\x80\x94if you wanted to\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to go to Alfredston to get a few things I left there. And I\r\ncould see Anny, who\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to have heard all about it, as she has\r\nfriends at Marygreen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude could not bear to acquiesce in this proposal; but his suspense\r\npitted itself against his discretion, and won in the struggle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\r\nask about it if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard a sound from there.\r\nIt must have been very private, if\xe2\x80\x94they have married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I haven\xe2\x80\x99t enough cash to take me there and back, or I\r\nshould have gone before. I must wait till I have earned some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I can pay the journey for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said impatiently. And thus his\r\nsuspense as to Sue\xe2\x80\x99s welfare, and the possible marriage, moved him to\r\ndispatch for intelligence the last emissary he would have thought of\r\nchoosing deliberately.\r\n\r\nArabella went, Jude requesting her to be home not later than by the\r\nseven o\xe2\x80\x99clock train. When she had gone he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I have\r\ncharged her to be back by a particular time! She\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to me\xe2\x80\x94nor\r\nthe other neither!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut having finished work he could not help going to the station to meet\r\nArabella, dragged thither by feverish haste to get the news she might\r\nbring, and know the worst. Arabella had made dimples most successfully\r\nall the way home, and when she stepped out of the railway carriage she\r\nsmiled. He merely said \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d with the very reverse of a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94of course they are!\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. She observed, however, the hard\r\nstrain upon his lip as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnny says she has heard from Belinda, her relation out at Marygreen,\r\nthat it was very sad, and curious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean sad? She wanted to marry him again, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she? And he\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94that was it. She wanted to in one sense, but not in the other.\r\nMrs. Edlin was much upset by it all, and spoke out her mind at\r\nPhillotson. But Sue was that excited about it that she burnt her best\r\nembroidery that she\xe2\x80\x99d worn with you, to blot you out entirely. Well\xe2\x80\x94if\r\na woman feels like it, she ought to do it. I commend her for it, though\r\nothers don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Arabella sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe felt he was her only husband, and\r\nthat she belonged to nobody else in the sight of God A\xe2\x80\x99mighty while he\r\nlived. Perhaps another woman feels the same about herself, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nArabella sighed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any cant!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t cant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel exactly the same as she!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe closed that issue by remarking abruptly: \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94now I know all I\r\nwanted to know. Many thanks for your information. I am not going back\r\nto my lodgings just yet.\xe2\x80\x9d And he left her straightway.\r\n\r\nIn his misery and depression Jude walked to well-nigh every spot in the\r\ncity that he had visited with Sue; thence he did not know whither, and\r\nthen thought of going home to his usual evening meal. But having all\r\nthe vices of his virtues, and some to spare, he turned into a public\r\nhouse, for the first time during many months. Among the possible\r\nconsequences of her marriage Sue had not dwelt on this.\r\n\r\nArabella, meanwhile, had gone back. The evening passed, and Jude did\r\nnot return. At half-past nine Arabella herself went out, first\r\nproceeding to an outlying district near the river where her father\r\nlived, and had opened a small and precarious pork-shop lately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cfor all your rowing me that night, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ncalled in, for I have something to tell you. I think I shall get\r\nmarried and settled again. Only you must help me: and you can do no\r\nless, after what I\xe2\x80\x99ve stood \xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything to get thee off my hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I am now going to look for my young man. He\xe2\x80\x99s on the loose\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, and I must get him home. All I want you to do to-night is\r\nnot to fasten the door, in case I should want to sleep here, and should\r\nbe late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\xe2\x80\x99d soon get tired of giving yourself airs and keeping\r\naway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t do the door. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then sallied out again, and first hastening back to Jude\xe2\x80\x99s to make\r\nsure that he had not returned, began her search for him. A shrewd guess\r\nas to his probable course took her straight to the tavern which Jude\r\nhad formerly frequented, and where she had been barmaid for a brief\r\nterm. She had no sooner opened the door of the \xe2\x80\x9cPrivate Bar\xe2\x80\x9d than her\r\neyes fell upon him\xe2\x80\x94sitting in the shade at the back of the compartment,\r\nwith his eyes fixed on the floor in a blank stare. He was drinking\r\nnothing stronger than ale just then. He did not observe her, and she\r\nentered and sat beside him.\r\n\r\nJude looked up, and said without surprise: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve come to have\r\nsomething, Arabella? \xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to forget her: that\xe2\x80\x99s all! But I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t; and I am going home.\xe2\x80\x9d She saw that he was a little way on in\r\nliquor, but only a little as yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come entirely to look for you, dear boy. You are not well. Now\r\nyou must have something better than that.\xe2\x80\x9d Arabella held up her finger\r\nto the barmaid. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have a liqueur\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s better fit for a man\r\nof education than beer. You shall have maraschino, or cura\xc3\xa7ao dry or\r\nsweet, or cherry brandy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll treat you, poor chap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care which! Say cherry brandy\xe2\x80\xa6 Sue has served me badly, very\r\nbadly. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it of Sue! I stuck to her, and she ought to have\r\nstuck to me. I\xe2\x80\x99d have sold my soul for her sake, but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t risk\r\nhers a jot for me. To save her own soul she lets mine go damn! \xe2\x80\xa6 But it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t her fault, poor little girl\xe2\x80\x94I am sure it isn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow Arabella had obtained money did not appear, but she ordered a\r\nliqueur each, and paid for them. When they had drunk these Arabella\r\nsuggested another; and Jude had the pleasure of being, as it were,\r\npersonally conducted through the varieties of spirituous delectation by\r\none who knew the landmarks well. Arabella kept very considerably in the\r\nrear of Jude; but though she only sipped where he drank, she took as\r\nmuch as she could safely take without losing her head\xe2\x80\x94which was not a\r\nlittle, as the crimson upon her countenance showed.\r\n\r\nHer tone towards him to-night was uniformly soothing and cajoling; and\r\nwhenever he said \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what happens to me,\xe2\x80\x9d a thing he did\r\ncontinually, she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I do very much!\xe2\x80\x9d The closing hour came,\r\nand they were compelled to turn out; whereupon Arabella put her arm\r\nround his waist, and guided his unsteady footsteps.\r\n\r\nWhen they were in the streets she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what our landlord\r\nwill say to my bringing you home in this state. I expect we are\r\nfastened out, so that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to come down and let us in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of not having a home of your own. I tell you, Jude,\r\nwhat we had best do. Come round to my father\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94I made it up with him a\r\nbit to-day. I can let you in, and nobody will see you at all; and by\r\nto-morrow morning you\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything\xe2\x80\x94anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil does it matter to\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went along together, like any other fuddling couple, her arm still\r\nround his waist, and his, at last, round hers; though with no amatory\r\nintent; but merely because he was weary, unstable, and in need of\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis\xe2\x80\x94is th\xe2\x80\x99 Martyrs\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94burning-place,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered as they dragged\r\nacross a broad street. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember\xe2\x80\x94in old Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s _Holy State_\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nam reminded of it\xe2\x80\x94by our passing by here\xe2\x80\x94old Fuller in his _Holy State_\r\nsays, that at the burning of Ridley, Doctor Smith\xe2\x80\x94preached sermon, and\r\ntook as his text _\xe2\x80\x98Though I give my body to be burned, and have not\r\ncharity, it profiteth me nothing.\xe2\x80\x99_\xe2\x80\x94Often think of it as I pass here.\r\nRidley was a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Exactly. Very thoughtful of you, deary, even though it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmuch to do with our present business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes it has! I\xe2\x80\x99m giving my body to be burned! But\xe2\x80\x94ah you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand!\xe2\x80\x94it wants Sue to understand such things! And I was her\r\nseducer\xe2\x80\x94poor little girl! And she\xe2\x80\x99s gone\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about myself!\r\nDo what you like with me! \xe2\x80\xa6 And yet she did it for conscience\xe2\x80\x99 sake,\r\npoor little Sue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang her!\xe2\x80\x94I mean, I think she was right,\xe2\x80\x9d hiccuped Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve my\r\nfeelings too, like her; and I feel I belong to you in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and\r\nto nobody else, till death us do part! It is\xe2\x80\x94hic\xe2\x80\x94never too late\xe2\x80\x94hic to\r\nmend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had reached her father\xe2\x80\x99s house, and she softly unfastened the\r\ndoor, groping about for a light within.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances were not altogether unlike those of their entry into\r\nthe cottage at Cresscombe, such a long time before. Nor were perhaps\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s motives. But Jude did not think of that, though she did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t find the matches, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said when she had fastened up the\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut never mind\xe2\x80\x94this way. As quiet as you can, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as dark as pitch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll lead you. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Just sit down here,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll pull off your boots. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wake him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather. He\xe2\x80\x99d make a row, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pulled off his boots. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9ctake hold of me\xe2\x80\x94never\r\nmind your weight. Now\xe2\x80\x94first stair, second stair\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94are we out in our old house by Marygreen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the stupefied\r\nJude. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been inside it for years till now! Hey? And where are\r\nmy books? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are at my house, dear, where there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody to spy out how ill you\r\nare. Now\xe2\x80\x94third stair, fourth stair\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s it. Now we shall get on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nArabella was preparing breakfast in the downstairs back room of this\r\nsmall, recently hired tenement of her father\xe2\x80\x99s. She put her head into\r\nthe little pork-shop in front, and told Mr. Donn it was ready. Donn,\r\nendeavouring to look like a master pork-butcher, in a greasy blue\r\nblouse, and with a strap round his waist from which a steel dangled,\r\ncame in promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must mind the shop this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said casually. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve to go\r\nand get some inwards and half a pig from Lumsdon, and to call\r\nelsewhere. If you live here you must put your shoulder to the wheel, at\r\nleast till I get the business started!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, for to-day I can\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked deedily into his face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a prize upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh? What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA husband\xe2\x80\x94almost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It\xe2\x80\x99s Jude. He\xe2\x80\x99s come back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour old original one? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m damned!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I always did like him, that I will say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how does he come to be up there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Donn, humour-struck, and\r\nnodding to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask inconvenient questions, Father. What we\xe2\x80\x99ve to do is to keep\r\nhim here till he and I are\xe2\x80\x94as we were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\xa6 Well it is the rummest thing I ever heard of\xe2\x80\x94marrying an old\r\nhusband again, and so much new blood in the world! He\xe2\x80\x99s no catch, to my\r\nthinking. I\xe2\x80\x99d have had a new one while I was about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t rum for a woman to want her old husband back for\r\nrespectability, though for a man to want his old wife back\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nperhaps it is funny, rather!\xe2\x80\x9d And Arabella was suddenly seized with a\r\nfit of loud laughter, in which her father joined more moderately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe civil to him, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the rest,\xe2\x80\x9d she said when she had\r\nrecovered seriousness. \xe2\x80\x9cHe told me this morning that his head ached fit\r\nto burst, and he hardly seemed to know where he was. And no wonder,\r\nconsidering how he mixed his drink last night. We must keep him jolly\r\nand cheerful here for a day or two, and not let him go back to his\r\nlodging. Whatever you advance I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay back to you again. But I must go\r\nup and see how he is now, poor deary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella ascended the stairs, softly opened the door of the first\r\nbedroom, and peeped in. Finding that her shorn Samson was asleep she\r\nentered to the bedside and stood regarding him. The fevered flush on\r\nhis face from the debauch of the previous evening lessened the\r\nfragility of his ordinary appearance, and his long lashes, dark brows,\r\nand curly back hair and beard against the white pillow completed the\r\nphysiognomy of one whom Arabella, as a woman of rank passions, still\r\nfelt it worth while to recapture, highly important to recapture as a\r\nwoman straitened both in means and in reputation. Her ardent gaze\r\nseemed to affect him; his quick breathing became suspended, and he\r\nopened his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you now, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is I\xe2\x80\x94Arabella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x94oh yes, I remember! You gave me shelter\xe2\x80\xa6 I am\r\nstranded\xe2\x80\x94ill\xe2\x80\x94demoralized\xe2\x80\x94damn bad! That\xe2\x80\x99s what I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do stay here. There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody in the house but father and me, and\r\nyou can rest till you are thoroughly well. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them at the\r\nstoneworks that you are knocked up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what they are thinking at the lodgings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go round and explain. Perhaps you had better let me pay up, or\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll think we\xe2\x80\x99ve run away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find enough money in my pocket there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuite indifferent, and shutting his eyes because he could not bear the\r\ndaylight in his throbbing eye-balls, Jude seemed to doze again.\r\nArabella took his purse, softly left the room, and putting on her\r\noutdoor things went off to the lodgings she and he had quitted the\r\nevening before.\r\n\r\nScarcely half an hour had elapsed ere she reappeared round the corner,\r\nwalking beside a lad wheeling a truck on which were piled all Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhousehold possessions, and also the few of Arabella\xe2\x80\x99s things which she\r\nhad taken to the lodging for her short sojourn there. Jude was in such\r\nphysical pain from his unfortunate break-down of the previous night,\r\nand in such mental pain from the loss of Sue and from having yielded in\r\nhis half-somnolent state to Arabella, that when he saw his few chattels\r\nunpacked and standing before his eyes in this strange bedroom,\r\nintermixed with woman\xe2\x80\x99s apparel, he scarcely considered how they had\r\ncome there, or what their coming signalized.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella to her father downstairs, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must keep plenty of\r\ngood liquor going in the house these next few days. I know his nature,\r\nand if he once gets into that fearfully low state that he does get into\r\nsometimes, he\xe2\x80\x99ll never do the honourable thing by me in this world, and\r\nI shall be left in the lurch. He must be kept cheerful. He has a little\r\nmoney in the savings bank, and he has given me his purse to pay for\r\nanything necessary. Well, that will be the licence; for I must have\r\nthat ready at hand, to catch him the moment he\xe2\x80\x99s in the humour. You\r\nmust pay for the liquor. A few friends, and a quiet convivial party\r\nwould be the thing, if we could get it up. It would advertise the shop,\r\nand help me too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat can be got up easy enough by anybody who\xe2\x80\x99ll afford victuals and\r\ndrink\xe2\x80\xa6 Well yes\xe2\x80\x94it would advertise the shop\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree days later, when Jude had recovered somewhat from the fearful\r\nthrobbing of his eyes and brain, but was still considerably confused in\r\nhis mind by what had been supplied to him by Arabella during the\r\ninterval\xe2\x80\x94to keep him, jolly, as she expressed it\xe2\x80\x94the quiet convivial\r\ngathering, suggested by her, to wind Jude up to the striking point,\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nDonn had only just opened his miserable little pork and sausage shop,\r\nwhich had as yet scarce any customers; nevertheless that party\r\nadvertised it well, and the Donns acquired a real notoriety among a\r\ncertain class in Christminster who knew not the colleges, nor their\r\nworks, nor their ways. Jude was asked if he could suggest any guest in\r\naddition to those named by Arabella and her father, and in a saturnine\r\nhumour of perfect recklessness mentioned Uncle Joe, and Stagg, and the\r\ndecayed auctioneer, and others whom he remembered as having been\r\nfrequenters of the well-known tavern during his bout therein years\r\nbefore. He also suggested Freckles and Bower o\xe2\x80\x99 Bliss. Arabella took\r\nhim at his word so far as the men went, but drew the line at the\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nAnother man they knew, Tinker Taylor, though he lived in the same\r\nstreet, was not invited; but as he went homeward from a late job on the\r\nevening of the party, he had occasion to call at the shop for trotters.\r\nThere were none in, but he was promised some the next morning. While\r\nmaking his inquiry Taylor glanced into the back room, and saw the\r\nguests sitting round, card-playing, and drinking, and otherwise\r\nenjoying themselves at Donn\xe2\x80\x99s expense. He went home to bed, and on his\r\nway out next morning wondered how the party went off. He thought it\r\nhardly worth while to call at the shop for his provisions at that hour,\r\nDonn and his daughter being probably not up, if they caroused late the\r\nnight before. However, he found in passing that the door was open, and\r\nhe could hear voices within, though the shutters of the meat-stall were\r\nnot down. He went and tapped at the sitting-room door, and opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, astonished.\r\n\r\nHosts and guests were sitting card-playing, smoking, and talking,\r\nprecisely as he had left them eleven hours earlier; the gas was burning\r\nand the curtains drawn, though it had been broad daylight for two hours\r\nout of doors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Arabella, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cHere we are, just the same. We ought\r\nto be ashamed of ourselves, oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t we? But it is a sort of\r\nhousewarming, you see; and our friends are in no hurry. Come in, Mr.\r\nTaylor, and sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tinker, or rather reduced ironmonger, was nothing loath, and\r\nentered and took a seat. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall lose a quarter, but never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, really, I could hardly believe my eyes when I looked in!\r\nIt seemed as if I was flung back again into last night, all of a\r\nsudden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are. Pour out for Mr. Taylor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe now perceived that she was sitting beside Jude, her arm being round\r\nhis waist. Jude, like the rest of the company, bore on his face the\r\nsigns of how deeply he had been indulging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for certain legal hours to arrive, to tell\r\nthe truth,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued bashfully, and making her spirituous crimson\r\nlook as much like a maiden blush as possible. \xe2\x80\x9cJude and I have decided\r\nto make up matters between us by tying the knot again, as we find we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do without one another after all. So, as a bright notion, we\r\nagreed to sit on till it was late enough, and go and do it off-hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude seemed to pay no great heed to what she was announcing, or indeed\r\nto anything whatever. The entrance of Taylor infused fresh spirit into\r\nthe company, and they remained sitting, till Arabella whispered to her\r\nfather: \xe2\x80\x9cNow we may as well go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the parson don\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I told him last night that we might come between eight and nine,\r\nas there were reasons of decency for doing it as early and quiet as\r\npossible; on account of it being our second marriage, which might make\r\npeople curious to look on if they knew. He highly approved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh very well, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father, getting up and shaking\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, old darling,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along, as you promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did I promise anything?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he, whom she had made so tipsy by\r\nher special knowledge of that line of business as almost to have made\r\nhim sober again\xe2\x80\x94or to seem so to those who did not know him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella, affecting dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve promised to marry me\r\nseveral times as we\xe2\x80\x99ve sat here to-night. These gentlemen have heard\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude doggedly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one woman\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t mention her in this Capharnaum!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella looked towards her father. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Fawley be honourable,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Donn. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and my daughter have been living here together these\r\nthree or four days, quite on the understanding that you were going to\r\nmarry her. Of course I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had such goings on in my house if\r\nI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t understood that. As a point of honour you must do it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say anything against my honour!\xe2\x80\x9d enjoined Jude hotly, standing\r\nup. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d marry the W\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93 of Babylon rather than do anything\r\ndishonourable! No reflection on you, my dear. It is a mere rhetorical\r\nfigure\xe2\x80\x94what they call in the books, hyperbole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your figures for your debts to friends who shelter you,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDonn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am bound in honour to marry her\xe2\x80\x94as I suppose I am\xe2\x80\x94though how I\r\ncame to be here with her I know no more than a dead man\xe2\x80\x94marry her I\r\nwill, so help me God! I have never behaved dishonourably to a woman or\r\nto any living thing. I am not a man who wants to save himself at the\r\nexpense of the weaker among us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94never mind him, deary,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, putting her cheek against\r\nJude\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cCome up and wash your face, and just put yourself tidy, and\r\noff we\xe2\x80\x99ll go. Make it up with Father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey shook hands. Jude went upstairs with her, and soon came down\r\nlooking tidy and calm. Arabella, too, had hastily arranged herself, and\r\naccompanied by Donn away they went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the guests at parting. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told the little\r\nmaid to get the breakfast while we are gone; and when we come back\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll all have some. A good strong cup of tea will set everybody right\r\nfor going home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Arabella, Jude, and Donn had disappeared on their matrimonial\r\nerrand the assembled guests yawned themselves wider awake, and\r\ndiscussed the situation with great interest. Tinker Taylor, being the\r\nmost sober, reasoned the most lucidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to speak against friends,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it do seem a\r\nrare curiosity for a couple to marry over again! If they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\non the first time when their minds were limp, they won\xe2\x80\x99t the second, by\r\nmy reckoning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been put upon his honour by the woman, so he med.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d hardly do it straight off like this. He\xe2\x80\x99s got no licence nor\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s got that, bless you. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear her say so to her father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tinker Taylor, relighting his pipe at the gas-jet. \xe2\x80\x9cTake\r\nher all together, limb by limb, she\xe2\x80\x99s not such a bad-looking\r\npiece\xe2\x80\x94particular by candlelight. To be sure, halfpence that have been\r\nin circulation can\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to look like new ones from the mint.\r\nBut for a woman that\xe2\x80\x99s been knocking about the four hemispheres for\r\nsome time, she\xe2\x80\x99s passable enough. A little bit thick in the flitch\r\nperhaps: but I like a woman that a puff o\xe2\x80\x99 wind won\xe2\x80\x99t blow down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes followed the movements of the little girl as she spread the\r\nbreakfast-cloth on the table they had been using, without wiping up the\r\nslops of the liquor. The curtains were undrawn, and the expression of\r\nthe house made to look like morning. Some of the guests, however, fell\r\nasleep in their chairs. One or two went to the door, and gazed along\r\nthe street more than once. Tinker Taylor was the chief of these, and\r\nafter a time he came in with a leer on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Gad, they are coming! I think the deed\xe2\x80\x99s done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Joe, following him in. \xe2\x80\x9cTake my word, he turned rusty\r\nat the last minute. They are walking in a very unusual way; and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe meaning of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey waited in silence till the wedding-party could be heard entering\r\nthe house. First into the room came Arabella boisterously; and her face\r\nwas enough to show that her strategy had succeeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Fawley, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tinker Taylor with mock courtesy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Mrs. Fawley again,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Arabella blandly, pulling off\r\nher glove and holding out her left hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the padlock, see\xe2\x80\xa6\r\nWell, he was a very nice, gentlemanly man indeed. I mean the clergyman.\r\nHe said to me as gentle as a babe when all was done: \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Fawley, I\r\ncongratulate you heartily,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. \xe2\x80\x98For having heard your history,\r\nand that of your husband, I think you have both done the right and\r\nproper thing. And for your past errors as a wife, and his as a husband,\r\nI think you ought now to be forgiven by the world, as you have forgiven\r\neach other,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. Yes; he was a very nice, gentlemanly man. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nChurch don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize divorce in her dogma, strictly speaking,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsays: \xe2\x80\x98and bear in mind the words of the service in your goings out and\r\nyour comings in: What God hath joined together let no man put asunder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nYes; he was a very nice, gentlemanly man\xe2\x80\xa6 But, Jude, my dear, you were\r\nenough to make a cat laugh! You walked that straight, and held yourself\r\nthat steady, that one would have thought you were going \xe2\x80\x99prentice to a\r\njudge; though I knew you were seeing double all the time, from the way\r\nyou fumbled with my finger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I\xe2\x80\x99d do anything to\xe2\x80\x94save a woman\xe2\x80\x99s honour,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Jude. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, old deary, come along and have some breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want\xe2\x80\x94some\xe2\x80\x94more whisky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude stolidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, dear. Not now! There\xe2\x80\x99s no more left. The tea will take the\r\nmuddle out of our heads, and we shall be as fresh as larks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\xe2\x80\x94married you. She said I ought to marry you again, and\r\nI have straightway. It is true religion! Ha\xe2\x80\x94ha\xe2\x80\x94ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMichaelmas came and passed, and Jude and his wife, who had lived but a\r\nshort time in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house after their remarriage, were in\r\nlodgings on the top floor of a dwelling nearer to the centre of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nHe had done a few days\xe2\x80\x99 work during the two or three months since the\r\nevent, but his health had been indifferent, and it was now precarious.\r\nHe was sitting in an arm-chair before the fire, and coughed a good\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bargain for my trouble in marrying thee over again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nArabella was saying to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to keep \xe2\x80\x99ee entirely\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat \xe2\x80\x99twill come to! I shall have to make black-pot and sausages, and\r\nhawk \xe2\x80\x99em about the street, all to support an invalid husband I\xe2\x80\x99d no\r\nbusiness to be saddled with at all. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you keep your health,\r\ndeceiving one like this? You were well enough when the wedding was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, laughing acridly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking of my\r\nfoolish feeling about the pig you and I killed during our first\r\nmarriage. I feel now that the greatest mercy that could be vouchsafed\r\nto me would be that something should serve me as I served that animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the sort of discourse that went on between them every day now.\r\nThe landlord of the lodging, who had heard that they were a queer\r\ncouple, had doubted if they were married at all, especially as he had\r\nseen Arabella kiss Jude one evening when she had taken a little\r\ncordial; and he was about to give them notice to quit, till by chance\r\noverhearing her one night haranguing Jude in rattling terms, and\r\nultimately flinging a shoe at his head, he recognized the note of\r\ngenuine wedlock; and concluding that they must be respectable, said no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nJude did not get any better, and one day he requested Arabella, with\r\nconsiderable hesitation, to execute a commission for him. She asked him\r\nindifferently what it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo write to Sue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the name\xe2\x80\x94do you want me to write to her for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo ask how she is, and if she\xe2\x80\x99ll come to see me, because I\xe2\x80\x99m ill, and\r\nshould like to see her\xe2\x80\x94once again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is like you to insult a lawful wife by asking such a thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just in order not to insult you that I ask you to do it. You\r\nknow I love Sue. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to mince the matter\xe2\x80\x94there stands the\r\nfact: I love her. I could find a dozen ways of sending a letter to her\r\nwithout your knowledge. But I wish to be quite above-board with you,\r\nand with her husband. A message through you asking her to come is at\r\nleast free from any odour of intrigue. If she retains any of her old\r\nnature at all, she\xe2\x80\x99ll come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve no respect for marriage whatever, or its rights and duties!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _does_ it matter what my opinions are\xe2\x80\x94a wretch like me! Can it\r\nmatter to anybody in the world who comes to see me for half an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x94here with one foot in the grave! \xe2\x80\xa6 Come, please write, Arabella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cRepay my candour by a little generosity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think _not_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot just once?\xe2\x80\x94Oh do!\xe2\x80\x9d He felt that his physical weakness had taken\r\naway all his dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want _her_ to know how you are for? She don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee. She\xe2\x80\x99s the rat that forsook the sinking ship!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I stuck to un\xe2\x80\x94the more fool I! Have that strumpet in the house\r\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as the words were spoken Jude sprang from the chair, and\r\nbefore Arabella knew where she was he had her on her back upon a little\r\ncouch which stood there, he kneeling above her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay another word of that sort,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you\xe2\x80\x94here\r\nand now! I\xe2\x80\x99ve everything to gain by it\xe2\x80\x94my own death not being the least\r\npart. So don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s no meaning in what I say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPromise never to speak of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take your word,\xe2\x80\x9d he said scornfully as he loosened her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what it\r\nis worth I can\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill the pig, but you could kill me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94there you have me! No\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill you\xe2\x80\x94even in a passion. Taunt\r\naway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then began coughing very much, and she estimated his life with an\r\nappraiser\xe2\x80\x99s eye as he sank back ghastly pale. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send for her,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nArabella murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99ll agree to my being in the room with you\r\nall the time she\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe softer side of his nature, the desire to see Sue, made him unable\r\nto resist the offer even now, provoked as he had been; and he replied\r\nbreathlessly: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I agree. Only send for her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the evening he inquired if she had written.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote a note telling her you were ill, and asking\r\nher to come to-morrow or the day after. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t posted it yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day Jude wondered if she really did post it, but would not ask\r\nher; and foolish Hope, that lives on a drop and a crumb, made him\r\nrestless with expectation. He knew the times of the possible trains,\r\nand listened on each occasion for sounds of her.\r\n\r\nShe did not come; but Jude would not address Arabella again thereon. He\r\nhoped and expected all the next day; but no Sue appeared; neither was\r\nthere any note of reply. Then Jude decided in the privacy of his mind\r\nthat Arabella had never posted hers, although she had written it. There\r\nwas something in her manner which told it. His physical weakness was\r\nsuch that he shed tears at the disappointment when she was not there to\r\nsee. His suspicions were, in fact, well founded. Arabella, like some\r\nother nurses, thought that your duty towards your invalid was to pacify\r\nhim by any means short of really acting upon his fancies.\r\n\r\nHe never said another word to her about his wish or his conjecture. A\r\nsilent, undiscerned resolve grew up in him, which gave him, if not\r\nstrength, stability and calm. One midday when, after an absence of two\r\nhours, she came into the room, she beheld the chair empty.\r\n\r\nDown she flopped on the bed, and sitting, meditated. \xe2\x80\x9cNow where the\r\ndevil is my man gone to!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nA driving rain from the north-east had been falling with more or less\r\nintermission all the morning, and looking from the window at the\r\ndripping spouts it seemed impossible to believe that any sick man would\r\nhave ventured out to almost certain death. Yet a conviction possessed\r\nArabella that he had gone out, and it became a certainty when she had\r\nsearched the house. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s such a fool, let him be!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\ndo no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude was at that moment in a railway train that was drawing near to\r\nAlfredston, oddly swathed, pale as a monumental figure in alabaster,\r\nand much stared at by other passengers. An hour later his thin form, in\r\nthe long great-coat and blanket he had come with, but without an\r\numbrella, could have been seen walking along the five-mile road to\r\nMarygreen. On his face showed the determined purpose that alone\r\nsustained him, but to which has weakness afforded a sorry foundation.\r\nBy the up-hill walk he was quite blown, but he pressed on; and at\r\nhalf-past three o\xe2\x80\x99clock stood by the familiar well at Marygreen. The\r\nrain was keeping everybody indoors; Jude crossed the green to the\r\nchurch without observation, and found the building open. Here he stood,\r\nlooking forth at the school, whence he could hear the usual sing-song\r\ntones of the little voices that had not learnt Creation\xe2\x80\x99s groan.\r\n\r\nHe waited till a small boy came from the school\xe2\x80\x94one evidently allowed\r\nout before hours for some reason or other. Jude held up his hand, and\r\nthe child came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease call at the schoolhouse and ask Mrs. Phillotson if she will be\r\nkind enough to come to the church for a few minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child departed, and Jude heard him knock at the door of the\r\ndwelling. He himself went further into the church. Everything was new,\r\nexcept a few pieces of carving preserved from the wrecked old fabric,\r\nnow fixed against the new walls. He stood by these: they seemed akin to\r\nthe perished people of that place who were his ancestors and Sue\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nA light footstep, which might have been accounted no more than an added\r\ndrip to the rainfall, sounded in the porch, and he looked round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was you! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94Oh, Jude!\xe2\x80\x9d A hysterical catch\r\nin her breath ended in a succession of them. He advanced, but she\r\nquickly recovered and went back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t go!\xe2\x80\x9d he implored. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my last time! I thought it\r\nwould be less intrusive than to enter your house. And I shall never\r\ncome again. Don\xe2\x80\x99t then be unmerciful. Sue, Sue! We are acting by the\r\nletter; and \xe2\x80\x98the letter killeth\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t be unkind!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, her mouth quivering and her\r\ntears flowing as she allowed him to come closer. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why did you come,\r\nand do this wrong thing, after doing such a right thing as you have\r\ndone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat right thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarrying Arabella again. It was in the Alfredston paper. She has never\r\nbeen other than yours, Jude\xe2\x80\x94in a proper sense. And therefore you did so\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94Oh so well!\xe2\x80\x94in recognizing it\xe2\x80\x94and taking her to you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod above\xe2\x80\x94and is that all I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to hear? If there is anything more\r\ndegrading, immoral, unnatural, than another in my life, it is this\r\nmeretricious contract with Arabella which has been called doing the\r\nright thing! And you too\xe2\x80\x94you call yourself Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s wife! _His_\r\nwife! You are mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make me rush away from you\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear much! But on this point\r\nI am decided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot understand how you did it\xe2\x80\x94how you think it\xe2\x80\x94I cannot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that. He is a kind husband to me\xe2\x80\x94And I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve wrestled and\r\nstruggled, and fasted, and prayed. I have nearly brought my body into\r\ncomplete subjection. And you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94will you\xe2\x80\x94wake\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you darling little fool; where is your reason? You seem to have\r\nsuffered the loss of your faculties! I would argue with you if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow that a woman in your state of feeling is quite beyond all appeals\r\nto her brains. Or is it that you are humbugging yourself, as so many\r\nwomen do about these things; and don\xe2\x80\x99t actually believe what you\r\npretend to, and only are indulging in the luxury of the emotion raised\r\nby an affected belief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuxury! How can you be so cruel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dear, sad, soft, most melancholy wreck of a promising human\r\nintellect that it has ever been my lot to behold! Where is your scorn\r\nof convention gone? I _would_ have died game!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou crush, almost insult me, Jude! Go away from me!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned off\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will. I would never come to see you again, even if I had the\r\nstrength to come, which I shall not have any more. Sue, Sue, you are\r\nnot worth a man\xe2\x80\x99s love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer bosom began to go up and down. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t endure you to say that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe burst out, and her eye resting on him a moment, she turned back\r\nimpulsively. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t scorn me! Kiss me, oh kiss me lots of times,\r\nand say I am not a coward and a contemptible humbug\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe rushed up to him and, with her mouth on his, continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\ntell you\xe2\x80\x94oh I must\xe2\x80\x94my darling Love! It has been\xe2\x80\x94only a church\r\nmarriage\xe2\x80\x94an apparent marriage I mean! He suggested it at the very\r\nfirst!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean it is a nominal marriage only. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been more than that at\r\nall since I came back to him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Pressing her to him in his arms, he bruised her lips\r\nwith kisses. \xe2\x80\x9cIf misery can know happiness, I have a moment\xe2\x80\x99s happiness\r\nnow! Now, in the name of all you hold holy, tell me the truth, and no\r\nlie. You do love me still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do! You know it too well! \xe2\x80\xa6 But I _mustn\xe2\x80\x99t_ do this! I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t kiss\r\nyou back as I would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you are so dear!\xe2\x80\x94and you look so ill\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so do you! There\xe2\x80\x99s one more, in memory of our dead little\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94yours and mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words struck her like a blow, and she bent her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI _mustn\xe2\x80\x99t_\xe2\x80\x94I\r\n_can\xe2\x80\x99t_ go on with this!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped presently. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there, there,\r\ndarling; I give you back your kisses; I do, I do! \xe2\x80\xa6 And now I\xe2\x80\x99ll _hate_\r\nmyself for ever for my sin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94let me make my last appeal. Listen to this! We\xe2\x80\x99ve both remarried\r\nout of our senses. I was made drunk to do it. You were the same. I was\r\ngin-drunk; you were creed-drunk. Either form of intoxication takes away\r\nthe nobler vision\xe2\x80\xa6 Let us then shake off our mistakes, and run away\r\ntogether!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; again no! \xe2\x80\xa6 Why do you tempt me so far, Jude! It is too merciless!\r\n\xe2\x80\xa6 But I\xe2\x80\x99ve got over myself now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t follow me\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me. Leave\r\nme, for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ran up the church to the east end, and Jude did as she requested.\r\nHe did not turn his head, but took up his blanket, which she had not\r\nseen, and went straight out. As he passed the end of the church she\r\nheard his coughs mingling with the rain on the windows, and in a last\r\ninstinct of human affection, even now unsubdued by her fetters, she\r\nsprang up as if to go and succour him. But she knelt down again, and\r\nstopped her ears with her hands till all possible sound of him had\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nHe was by this time at the corner of the green, from which the path ran\r\nacross the fields in which he had scared rooks as a boy. He turned and\r\nlooked back, once, at the building which still contained Sue; and then\r\nwent on, knowing that his eyes would light on that scene no more.\r\n\r\nThere are cold spots up and down Wessex in autumn and winter weather;\r\nbut the coldest of all when a north or east wind is blowing is the\r\ncrest of the down by the Brown House, where the road to Alfredston\r\ncrosses the old Ridgeway. Here the first winter sleets and snows fall\r\nand lie, and here the spring frost lingers last unthawed. Here in the\r\nteeth of the north-east wind and rain Jude now pursued his way, wet\r\nthrough, the necessary slowness of his walk from lack of his former\r\nstrength being insufficent to maintain his heat. He came to the\r\nmilestone, and, raining as it was, spread his blanket and lay down\r\nthere to rest. Before moving on he went and felt at the back of the\r\nstone for his own carving. It was still there; but nearly obliterated\r\nby moss. He passed the spot where the gibbet of his ancestor and Sue\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhad stood, and descended the hill.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when he reached Alfredston, where he had a cup of tea, the\r\ndeadly chill that began to creep into his bones being too much for him\r\nto endure fasting. To get home he had to travel by a steam tram-car,\r\nand two branches of railway, with much waiting at a junction. He did\r\nnot reach Christminster till ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the platform stood Arabella. She looked him up and down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been to see her?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jude, literally tottering with cold and lassitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now you\xe2\x80\x99d best march along home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe water ran out of him as he went, and he was compelled to lean\r\nagainst the wall to support himself while coughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve done for yourself by this, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhether you know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do. I meant to do for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94to commit suicide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m blest! Kill yourself for a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, Arabella. You think you are the stronger; and so you\r\nare, in a physical sense, now. You could push me over like a nine-pin.\r\nYou did not send that letter the other day, and I could not resent your\r\nconduct. But I am not so weak in another way as you think. I made up my\r\nmind that a man confined to his room by inflammation of the lungs, a\r\nfellow who had only two wishes left in the world, to see a particular\r\nwoman, and then to die, could neatly accomplish those two wishes at one\r\nstroke by taking this journey in the rain. That I\xe2\x80\x99ve done. I have seen\r\nher for the last time, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve finished myself\xe2\x80\x94put an end to a\r\nfeverish life which ought never to have been begun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord\xe2\x80\x94you do talk lofty! Won\xe2\x80\x99t you have something warm to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thank you. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went along by the silent colleges, and Jude kept stopping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you looking at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupid fancies. I see, in a way, those spirits of the dead again, on\r\nthis my last walk, that I saw when I first walked here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a curious chap you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seem to see them, and almost hear them rustling. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t revere\r\nall of them as I did then. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in half of them. The\r\ntheologians, the apologists, and their kin the metaphysicians, the\r\nhigh-handed statesmen, and others, no longer interest me. All that has\r\nbeen spoilt for me by the grind of stern reality!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe expression of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s corpselike face in the watery lamplight was\r\nindeed as if he saw people where there was nobody. At moments he stood\r\nstill by an archway, like one watching a figure walk out; then he would\r\nlook at a window like one discerning a familiar face behind it. He\r\nseemed to hear voices, whose words he repeated as if to gather their\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey seem laughing at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I was talking to myself! The phantoms all about here, in the\r\ncollege archways, and windows. They used to look friendly in the old\r\ndays, particularly Addison, and Gibbon, and Johnson, and Dr. Browne,\r\nand Bishop Ken\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along do! Phantoms! There\xe2\x80\x99s neither living nor dead hereabouts\r\nexcept a damn policeman! I never saw the streets emptier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy! The Poet of Liberty used to walk here, and the great Dissector\r\nof Melancholy there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about \xe2\x80\x99em! They bore me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalter Raleigh is beckoning to me from that\r\nlane\xe2\x80\x94Wycliffe\xe2\x80\x94Harvey\xe2\x80\x94Hooker\xe2\x80\x94Arnold\xe2\x80\x94and a whole crowd of Tractarian\r\nShades\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _don\xe2\x80\x99t want_ to know their names, I tell you! What do I care about\r\nfolk dead and gone? Upon my soul you are more sober when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ndrinking than when you have not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must rest a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and as he paused, holding to the\r\nrailings, he measured with his eye the height of a college front. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nis old Rubric. And that Sarcophagus; and up that lane Crozier and\r\nTudor: and all down there is Cardinal with its long front, and its\r\nwindows with lifted eyebrows, representing the polite surprise of the\r\nuniversity at the efforts of such as I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll treat you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. It will help me home, for I feel the chilly fog from the\r\nmeadows of Cardinal as if death-claws were grabbing me through and\r\nthrough. As Antigone said, I am neither a dweller among men nor ghosts.\r\nBut, Arabella, when I am dead, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see my spirit flitting up and\r\ndown here among these!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! You mayn\xe2\x80\x99t die after all. You are tough enough yet, old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was night at Marygreen, and the rain of the afternoon showed no sign\r\nof abatement. About the time at which Jude and Arabella were walking\r\nthe streets of Christminster homeward, the Widow Edlin crossed the\r\ngreen, and opened the back door of the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling, which\r\nshe often did now before bedtime, to assist Sue in putting things away.\r\n\r\nSue was muddling helplessly in the kitchen, for she was not a good\r\nhousewife, though she tried to be, and grew impatient of domestic\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord love \xe2\x80\x99ee, what do ye do that yourself for, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve come o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npurpose! You knew I should come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I forgot! No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t forget. I did it to discipline\r\nmyself. I have scrubbed the stairs since eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I _must_\r\npractise myself in my household duties. I\xe2\x80\x99ve shamefully neglected\r\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should ye? He\xe2\x80\x99ll get a better school, perhaps be a parson, in\r\ntime, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep two servants. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a pity to spoil them pretty\r\nhands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk of my pretty hands, Mrs. Edlin. This pretty body of mine\r\nhas been the ruin of me already!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshoo\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve got no body to speak of! You put me more in mind of a\r\nsperrit. But there seems something wrong to-night, my dear. Husband\r\ncross?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He never is. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone to bed early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you. I have done wrong to-day. And I want to eradicate\r\nit\xe2\x80\xa6 Well\xe2\x80\x94I will tell you this\xe2\x80\x94Jude has been here this afternoon, and I\r\nfind I still love him\xe2\x80\x94oh, grossly! I cannot tell you more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow. \xe2\x80\x9cI told \xe2\x80\x99ee how \xe2\x80\x99twould be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it shan\xe2\x80\x99t be! I have not told my husband of his visit; it is not\r\nnecessary to trouble him about it, as I never mean to see Jude any\r\nmore. But I am going to make my conscience right on my duty to\r\nRichard\xe2\x80\x94by doing a penance\xe2\x80\x94the ultimate thing. I must!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94since he agrees to it being otherwise, and it has gone on\r\nthree months very well as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94he agrees to my living as I choose; but I feel it is an indulgence\r\nI ought not to exact from him. It ought not to have been accepted by\r\nme. To reverse it will be terrible\xe2\x80\x94but I must be more just to him. O\r\nwhy was I so unheroic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you don\xe2\x80\x99t like in him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Edlin curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you. It is something\xe2\x80\xa6 I cannot say. The mournful thing\r\nis, that nobody would admit it as a reason for feeling as I do; so that\r\nno excuse is left me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever tell Jude what it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard strange tales o\xe2\x80\x99 husbands in my time,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the widow\r\nin a lowered voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say that when the saints were upon the earth\r\ndevils used to take husbands\xe2\x80\x99 forms o\xe2\x80\x99 nights, and get poor women into\r\nall sorts of trouble. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why that should come into my\r\nhead, for it is only a tale\xe2\x80\xa6 What a wind and rain it is to-night!\r\nWell\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be in a hurry to alter things, my dear. Think it over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! I\xe2\x80\x99ve screwed my weak soul up to treating him more\r\ncourteously\xe2\x80\x94and it must be now\xe2\x80\x94at once\xe2\x80\x94before I break down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you ought to force your nature. No woman ought to be\r\nexpected to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my duty. I will drink my cup to the dregs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later when Mrs. Edlin put on her bonnet and shawl to\r\nleave, Sue seemed to be seized with vague terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t go, Mrs. Edlin,\xe2\x80\x9d she implored, her eyes enlarged, and with\r\na quick nervous look over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is bedtime, child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s the little spare room\xe2\x80\x94my room that was. It is quite\r\nready. Please stay, Mrs. Edlin!\xe2\x80\x94I shall want you in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, if you wish. Nothing will happen to my four old\r\nwalls, whether I be there or no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then fastened up the doors, and they ascended the stairs together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait here, Mrs. Edlin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sue. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go into my old room a moment\r\nby myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeaving the widow on the landing Sue turned to the chamber which had\r\nbeen hers exclusively since her arrival at Marygreen, and pushing to\r\nthe door knelt down by the bed for a minute or two. She then arose, and\r\ntaking her night-gown from the pillow undressed and came out to Mrs.\r\nEdlin. A man could be heard snoring in the room opposite. She wished\r\nMrs. Edlin good-night, and the widow entered the room that Sue had just\r\nvacated.\r\n\r\nSue unlatched the other chamber door, and, as if seized with faintness,\r\nsank down outside it. Getting up again she half opened the door, and\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cRichard.\xe2\x80\x9d As the word came out of her mouth she visibly\r\nshuddered.\r\n\r\nThe snoring had quite ceased for some time, but he did not reply. Sue\r\nseemed relieved, and hurried back to Mrs. Edlin\xe2\x80\x99s chamber. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in\r\nbed, Mrs. Edlin?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow, opening the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI be old and slow, and\r\nit takes me a long while to un-ray. I han\xe2\x80\x99t unlaced my jumps yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t hear him! And perhaps\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s dead!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then\xe2\x80\x94I should be _free_, and I\r\ncould go to Jude! \xe2\x80\xa6 Ah\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94I forgot _her_\xe2\x80\x94and God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go and hearken. No\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s snoring again. But the rain and the wind\r\nis so loud that you can hardly hear anything but between whiles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSue had dragged herself back. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Edlin, good-night again! I am sorry\r\nI called you out.\xe2\x80\x9d The widow retreated a second time.\r\n\r\nThe strained, resigned look returned to Sue\xe2\x80\x99s face when she was alone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must do it\xe2\x80\x94I must! I must drink to the dregs!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichard!\xe2\x80\x9d she said again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey\xe2\x80\x94what? Is that you, Susanna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want? Anything the matter? Wait a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d He pulled on\r\nsome articles of clothing, and came to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we were at Shaston I jumped out of the window rather than that\r\nyou should come near me. I have never reversed that treatment till\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94when I have come to beg your pardon for it, and ask you to let me\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you only think you ought to do this? I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish you to come\r\nagainst your impulses, as I have said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I beg to be admitted.\xe2\x80\x9d She waited a moment, and repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg\r\nto be admitted! I have been in error\xe2\x80\x94even to-day. I have exceeded my\r\nrights. I did not mean to tell you, but perhaps I ought. I sinned\r\nagainst you this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met Jude! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was coming. And\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kissed him, and let him kiss me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94the old story!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichard, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know we were going to kiss each other till we did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many times?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good many. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I am horrified to look back on it, and the\r\nleast I can do after it is to come to you like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome\xe2\x80\x94this is pretty bad, after what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done! Anything else to\r\nconfess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d She had been intending to say: \xe2\x80\x9cI called him my darling Love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut, as a contrite woman always keeps back a little, that portion of\r\nthe scene remained untold. She went on: \xe2\x80\x9cI am never going to see him\r\nany more. He spoke of some things of the past, and it overcame me. He\r\nspoke of\xe2\x80\x94the children. But, as I have said, I am glad\xe2\x80\x94almost glad I\r\nmean\xe2\x80\x94that they are dead, Richard. It blots out all that life of mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94about not seeing him again any more. Come\xe2\x80\x94you really mean this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere was something in Phillotson\xe2\x80\x99s tone now which seemed to show that\r\nhis three months of remarriage with Sue had somehow not been so\r\nsatisfactory as his magnanimity or amative patience had anticipated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll swear it on the New Testament?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went back to the room and brought out a little brown Testament. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nthen: So help you God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe swore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I supplicate you, Richard, to whom I belong, and whom I wish to\r\nhonour and obey, as I vowed, to let me in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink it over well. You know what it means. Having you back in the\r\nhouse was one thing\xe2\x80\x94this another. So think again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought\xe2\x80\x94I wish this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a complaisant spirit\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps you are right. With a lover\r\nhanging about, a half-marriage should be completed. But I repeat my\r\nreminder this third and last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my wish! \xe2\x80\xa6 O God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say \xe2\x80\x98O God\xe2\x80\x99 for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes you do! But \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d He gloomily considered her thin and fragile form a\r\nmoment longer as she crouched before him in her night-clothes. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\r\nthought it might end like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said presently. \xe2\x80\x9cI owe you nothing,\r\nafter these signs; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you in at your word, and forgive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his arm round her to lift her up. Sue started back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, speaking for the first time sternly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shrink from me again?\xe2\x80\x94just as formerly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Richard\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94was not thinking\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish to come in here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou still bear in mind what it means?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It is my duty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlacing the candlestick on the chest of drawers he led her through the\r\ndoorway, and lifting her bodily, kissed her. A quick look of aversion\r\npassed over her face, but clenching her teeth she uttered no cry.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edlin had by this time undressed, and was about to get into bed\r\nwhen she said to herself: \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99d better go and see if the\r\nlittle thing is all right. How it do blow and rain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe widow went out on the landing, and saw that Sue had disappeared.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Poor soul! Weddings be funerals \xe2\x80\x99a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve nowadays. Fifty-five\r\nyears ago, come Fall, since my man and I married! Times have changed\r\nsince then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite himself Jude recovered somewhat, and worked at his trade for\r\nseveral weeks. After Christmas, however, he broke down again.\r\n\r\nWith the money he had earned he shifted his lodgings to a yet more\r\ncentral part of the town. But Arabella saw that he was not likely to do\r\nmuch work for a long while, and was cross enough at the turn affairs\r\nhad taken since her remarriage to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hanged if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nclever in this last stroke!\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, \xe2\x80\x9cto get a nurse for nothing\r\nby marrying me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJude was absolutely indifferent to what she said, and indeed, often\r\nregarded her abuse in a humorous light. Sometimes his mood was more\r\nearnest, and as he lay he often rambled on upon the defeat of his early\r\naims.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery man has some little power in some one direction,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was never really stout enough for the stone trade, particularly the\r\nfixing. Moving the blocks always used to strain me, and standing the\r\ntrying draughts in buildings before the windows are in always gave me\r\ncolds, and I think that began the mischief inside. But I felt I could\r\ndo one thing if I had the opportunity. I could accumulate ideas, and\r\nimpart them to others. I wonder if the founders had such as I in their\r\nminds\xe2\x80\x94a fellow good for nothing else but that particular thing? \xe2\x80\xa6 I\r\nhear that soon there is going to be a better chance for such helpless\r\nstudents as I was. There are schemes afoot for making the university\r\nless exclusive, and extending its influence. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about\r\nit. And it is too late, too late for me! Ah\xe2\x80\x94and for how many worthier\r\nones before me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you keep a-mumbling!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave got over all that craze about books by this time. And so you\r\nwould, if you\xe2\x80\x99d had any sense to begin with. You are as bad now as when\r\nwe were first married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn one occasion while soliloquizing thus he called her \xe2\x80\x9cSue\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nunconsciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d mind who you are talking to!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella indignantly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalling a respectable married woman by the name of that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nremembered herself and he did not catch the word.\r\n\r\nBut in the course of time, when she saw how things were going, and how\r\nvery little she had to fear from Sue\xe2\x80\x99s rivalry, she had a fit of\r\ngenerosity. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you want to see your\xe2\x80\x94Sue?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind her coming. You can have her here if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to see her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a change!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t tell her anything about me\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x99m ill, or anything. She\r\nhas chosen her course. Let her go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne day he received a surprise. Mrs. Edlin came to see him, quite on\r\nher own account. Jude\xe2\x80\x99s wife, whose feelings as to where his affections\r\nwere centred had reached absolute indifference by this time, went out,\r\nleaving the old woman alone with Jude. He impulsively asked how Sue\r\nwas, and then said bluntly, remembering what Sue had told him: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose they are still only husband and wife in name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Edlin hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, no\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s different now. She\xe2\x80\x99s begun it\r\nquite lately\xe2\x80\x94all of her own free will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did she begin?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe night after you came. But as a punishment to her poor self. He\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t wish it, but she insisted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSue, my Sue\xe2\x80\x94you darling fool\xe2\x80\x94this is almost more than I can endure! \xe2\x80\xa6\r\nMrs. Edlin\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened at my rambling\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to talk to\r\nmyself lying here so many hours alone\xe2\x80\x94she was once a woman whose\r\nintellect was to mine like a star to a benzoline lamp: who saw all _my_\r\nsuperstitions as cobwebs that she could brush away with a word. Then\r\nbitter affliction came to us, and her intellect broke, and she veered\r\nround to darkness. Strange difference of sex, that time and\r\ncircumstance, which enlarge the views of most men, narrow the views of\r\nwomen almost invariably. And now the ultimate horror has come\xe2\x80\x94her\r\ngiving herself like this to what she loathes, in her enslavement to\r\nforms! She, so sensitive, so shrinking, that the very wind seemed to\r\nblow on her with a touch of deference\xe2\x80\xa6 As for Sue and me when we were\r\nat our own best, long ago\xe2\x80\x94when our minds were clear, and our love of\r\ntruth fearless\xe2\x80\x94the time was not ripe for us! Our ideas were fifty years\r\ntoo soon to be any good to us. And so the resistance they met with\r\nbrought reaction in her, and recklessness and ruin on me! \xe2\x80\xa6 There\xe2\x80\x94this,\r\nMrs. Edlin, is how I go on to myself continually, as I lie here. I must\r\nbe boring you awfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, my dear boy. I could hearken to \xe2\x80\x99ee all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Jude reflected more and more on her news, and grew more restless, he\r\nbegan in his mental agony to use terribly profane language about social\r\nconventions, which started a fit of coughing. Presently there came a\r\nknock at the door downstairs. As nobody answered it Mrs. Edlin herself\r\nwent down.\r\n\r\nThe visitor said blandly: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d The lanky form was that of\r\nPhysician Vilbert, who had been called in by Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is my patient at present?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the physician.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh bad\xe2\x80\x94very bad! Poor chap, he got excited, and do blaspeam terribly,\r\nsince I let out some gossip by accident\xe2\x80\x94the more to my blame. But\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94you must excuse a man in suffering for what he says, and I hope\r\nGod will forgive him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go up and see him. Mrs. Fawley at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not in at present, but she\xe2\x80\x99ll be here soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilbert went; but though Jude had hitherto taken the medicines of that\r\nskilful practitioner with the greatest indifference whenever poured\r\ndown his throat by Arabella, he was now so brought to bay by events\r\nthat he vented his opinion of Vilbert in the physician\xe2\x80\x99s face, and so\r\nforcibly, and with such striking epithets, that Vilbert soon scurried\r\ndownstairs again. At the door he met Arabella, Mrs. Edlin having left.\r\nArabella inquired how he thought her husband was now, and seeing that\r\nthe Doctor looked ruffled, asked him to take something. He assented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it to you here in the passage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody\r\nbut me about the house to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe brought him a bottle and a glass, and he drank.\r\n\r\nArabella began shaking with suppressed laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this, my\r\ndear?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, smacking his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94a drop of wine\xe2\x80\x94and something in it.\xe2\x80\x9d Laughing again she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\npoured your own love-philtre into it, that you sold me at the\r\nagricultural show, don\xe2\x80\x99t you re-member?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, I do! Clever woman! But you must be prepared for the\r\nconsequences.\xe2\x80\x9d Putting his arm round her shoulders he kissed her there\r\nand then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, laughing good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy man will\r\nhear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe let him out of the house, and as she went back she said to herself:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Weak women must provide for a rainy day. And if my poor fellow\r\nupstairs do go off\xe2\x80\x94as I suppose he will soon\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s well to keep chances\r\nopen. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t pick and choose now as I could when I was younger.\r\nAnd one must take the old if one can\xe2\x80\x99t get the young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last pages to which the chronicler of these lives would ask the\r\nreader\xe2\x80\x99s attention are concerned with the scene in and out of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedroom when leafy summer came round again.\r\n\r\nHis face was now so thin that his old friends would hardly have known\r\nhim. It was afternoon, and Arabella was at the looking-glass curling\r\nher hair, which operation she performed by heating an umbrella-stay in\r\nthe flame of a candle she had lighted, and using it upon the flowing\r\nlock. When she had finished this, practised a dimple, and put on her\r\nthings, she cast her eyes round upon Jude. He seemed to be sleeping,\r\nthough his position was an elevated one, his malady preventing him\r\nlying down.\r\n\r\nArabella, hatted, gloved, and ready, sat down and waited, as if\r\nexpecting some one to come and take her place as nurse.\r\n\r\nCertain sounds from without revealed that the town was in festivity,\r\nthough little of the festival, whatever it might have been, could be\r\nseen here. Bells began to ring, and the notes came into the room\r\nthrough the open window, and travelled round Jude\xe2\x80\x99s head in a hum. They\r\nmade her restless, and at last she said to herself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy ever doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nFather come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked again at Jude, critically gauged his ebbing life, as she had\r\ndone so many times during the late months, and glancing at his watch,\r\nwhich was hung up by way of timepiece, rose impatiently. Still he\r\nslept, and coming to a resolution she slipped from the room, closed the\r\ndoor noiselessly, and descended the stairs. The house was empty. The\r\nattraction which moved Arabella to go abroad had evidently drawn away\r\nthe other inmates long before.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm, cloudless, enticing day. She shut the front door, and\r\nhastened round into Chief Street, and when near the theatre could hear\r\nthe notes of the organ, a rehearsal for a coming concert being in\r\nprogress. She entered under the archway of Oldgate College, where men\r\nwere putting up awnings round the quadrangle for a ball in the hall\r\nthat evening. People who had come up from the country for the day were\r\npicnicking on the grass, and Arabella walked along the gravel paths and\r\nunder the aged limes. But finding this place rather dull she returned\r\nto the streets, and watched the carriages drawing up for the concert,\r\nnumerous Dons and their wives, and undergraduates with gay female\r\ncompanions, crowding up likewise. When the doors were closed, and the\r\nconcert began, she moved on.\r\n\r\nThe powerful notes of that concert rolled forth through the swinging\r\nyellow blinds of the open windows, over the housetops, and into the\r\nstill air of the lanes. They reached so far as to the room in which\r\nJude lay; and it was about this time that his cough began again and\r\nawakened him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could speak he murmured, his eyes still closed: \xe2\x80\x9cA little\r\nwater, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing but the deserted room received his appeal, and he coughed to\r\nexhaustion again\xe2\x80\x94saying still more feebly: \xe2\x80\x9cWater\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x94Sue\xe2\x80\x94Arabella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe room remained still as before. Presently he gasped again:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThroat\xe2\x80\x94water\xe2\x80\x94Sue\xe2\x80\x94darling\xe2\x80\x94drop of water\xe2\x80\x94please\xe2\x80\x94oh please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo water came, and the organ notes, faint as a bee\xe2\x80\x99s hum, rolled in as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWhile he remained, his face changing, shouts and hurrahs came from\r\nsomewhere in the direction of the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94yes! The Remembrance games,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I here. And Sue\r\ndefiled!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hurrahs were repeated, drowning the faint organ notes. Jude\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nchanged more: he whispered slowly, his parched lips scarcely moving:\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cLet the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was\r\nsaid, There is a man-child conceived.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cLet that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither\r\nlet the light shine upon it. Lo, let that night be solitary, let no\r\njoyful voice come therein.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cWhy died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when I\r\ncame out of the belly? \xe2\x80\xa6 For now should I have lain still and been\r\nquiet. I should have slept: then had I been at rest!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cThere the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the\r\noppressor\xe2\x80\xa6 The small and the great are there; and the servant is free\r\nfrom his master. Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and\r\nlife unto the bitter in soul?\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Arabella, in her journey to discover what was going on, took\r\na short cut down a narrow street and through an obscure nook into the\r\nquad of Cardinal. It was full of bustle, and brilliant in the sunlight\r\nwith flowers and other preparations for a ball here also. A carpenter\r\nnodded to her, one who had formerly been a fellow-workman of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s. A\r\ncorridor was in course of erection from the entrance to the hall\r\nstaircase, of gay red and buff bunting. Waggon-loads of boxes\r\ncontaining bright plants in full bloom were being placed about, and the\r\ngreat staircase was covered with red cloth. She nodded to one workman\r\nand another, and ascended to the hall on the strength of their\r\nacquaintance, where they were putting down a new floor and decorating\r\nfor the dance.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral bell close at hand was sounding for five o\xe2\x80\x99clock service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not mind having a spin there with a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s arm round my\r\nwaist,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to one of the men. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Lord, I must be getting home\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to do. No dancing for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she reached home she was met at the door by Stagg, and one or two\r\nother of Jude\xe2\x80\x99s fellow stoneworkers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are just going down to the\r\nriver,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former, \xe2\x80\x9cto see the boat-bumping. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve called\r\nround on our way to ask how your husband is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping nicely, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. Well now, can\xe2\x80\x99t you give yourself half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelaxation, Mrs. Fawley, and come along with us? \xe2\x80\x99Twould do you good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to go,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen the boat-racing, and\r\nI hear it is good fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I _wish_ I could!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked longingly down the street. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a\r\nminute, then. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just run up and see how he is now. Father is with\r\nhim, I believe; so I can most likely come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey waited, and she entered. Downstairs the inmates were absent as\r\nbefore, having, in fact, gone in a body to the river where the\r\nprocession of boats was to pass. When she reached the bedroom she found\r\nthat her father had not even now come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he have been here!\xe2\x80\x9d she said impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to\r\nsee the boats himself\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, on looking round to the bed she brightened, for she saw that\r\nJude was apparently sleeping, though he was not in the usual\r\nhalf-elevated posture necessitated by his cough. He had slipped down,\r\nand lay flat. A second glance caused her to start, and she went to the\r\nbed. His face was quite white, and gradually becoming rigid. She\r\ntouched his fingers; they were cold, though his body was still warm.\r\nShe listened at his chest. All was still within. The bumping of near\r\nthirty years had ceased.\r\n\r\nAfter her first appalled sense of what had happened, the faint notes of\r\na military or other brass band from the river reached her ears; and in\r\na provoked tone she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cTo think he should die just now! Why\r\ndid he die just now!\xe2\x80\x9d Then meditating another moment or two she went to\r\nthe door, softly closed it as before, and again descended the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere she is!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the workmen. \xe2\x80\x9cWe wondered if you were coming\r\nafter all. Come along; we must be quick to get a good place\xe2\x80\xa6 Well, how\r\nis he? Sleeping well still? Of course, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to drag \xe2\x80\x99ee away\r\nif\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94sleeping quite sound. He won\xe2\x80\x99t wake yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hurriedly.\r\n\r\nThey went with the crowd down Cardinal Street, where they presently\r\nreached the bridge, and the gay barges burst upon their view. Thence\r\nthey passed by a narrow slit down to the riverside path\xe2\x80\x94now dusty, hot,\r\nand thronged. Almost as soon as they had arrived the grand procession\r\nof boats began; the oars smacking with a loud kiss on the face of the\r\nstream, as they were lowered from the perpendicular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I say\xe2\x80\x94how jolly! I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I\xe2\x80\x99ve come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94it can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhurt my husband\xe2\x80\x94my being away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the river, on the crowded barges, were gorgeous\r\nnosegays of feminine beauty, fashionably arrayed in green, pink, blue,\r\nand white. The blue flag of the boat club denoted the centre of\r\ninterest, beneath which a band in red uniform gave out the notes she\r\nhad already heard in the death-chamber. Collegians of all sorts, in\r\ncanoes with ladies, watching keenly for \xe2\x80\x9cour\xe2\x80\x9d boat, darted up and down.\r\nWhile she regarded the lively scene somebody touched Arabella in the\r\nribs, and looking round she saw Vilbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat philtre is operating, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a leer. \xe2\x80\x9cShame on\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee to wreck a heart so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t talk of love to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? It is a general holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not reply. Vilbert\xe2\x80\x99s arm stole round her waist, which act could\r\nbe performed unobserved in the crowd. An arch expression overspread\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s face at the feel of the arm, but she kept her eyes on the\r\nriver as if she did not know of the embrace.\r\n\r\nThe crowd surged, pushing Arabella and her friends sometimes nearly\r\ninto the river, and she would have laughed heartily at the horse-play\r\nthat succeeded, if the imprint on her mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye of a pale, statuesque\r\ncountenance she had lately gazed upon had not sobered her a little.\r\n\r\nThe fun on the water reached the acme of excitement; there were\r\nimmersions, there were shouts: the race was lost and won, the pink and\r\nblue and yellow ladies retired from the barges, and the people who had\r\nwatched began to move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s been awfully good,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I must get\r\nback to my poor man. Father is there, so far as I know; but I had\r\nbetter get back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your hurry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must go\xe2\x80\xa6 Dear, dear, this is awkward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the narrow gangway where the people ascended from the riverside path\r\nto the bridge the crowd was literally jammed into one hot mass\xe2\x80\x94Arabella\r\nand Vilbert with the rest; and here they remained motionless, Arabella\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d more and more impatiently; for it had just\r\noccurred to her mind that if Jude were discovered to have died alone an\r\ninquest might be deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fidget you are, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d said the physician, who, being\r\npressed close against her by the throng, had no need of personal effort\r\nfor contact. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as well have patience: there\xe2\x80\x99s no getting away yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was nearly ten minutes before the wedged multitude moved\r\nsufficiently to let them pass through. As soon as she got up into the\r\nstreet Arabella hastened on, forbidding the physician to accompany her\r\nfurther that day. She did not go straight to her house; but to the\r\nabode of a woman who performed the last necessary offices for the\r\npoorer dead; where she knocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband has just gone, poor soul,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you come and lay\r\nhim out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArabella waited a few minutes; and the two women went along, elbowing\r\ntheir way through the stream of fashionable people pouring out of\r\nCardinal meadow, and being nearly knocked down by the carriages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must call at the sexton\xe2\x80\x99s about the bell, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis just round here, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I\xe2\x80\x99ll meet you at my door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night Jude was lying on the bedstead at his lodging\r\ncovered with a sheet, and straight as an arrow. Through the partly\r\nopened window the joyous throb of a waltz entered from the ball-room at\r\nCardinal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later, when the sky was equally cloudless, and the air equally\r\nstill, two persons stood beside Jude\xe2\x80\x99s open coffin in the same little\r\nbedroom. On one side was Arabella, on the other the Widow Edlin. They\r\nwere both looking at Jude\xe2\x80\x99s face, the worn old eyelids of Mrs. Edlin\r\nbeing red.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x99andsome corpse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella.\r\n\r\nThe window was still open to ventilate the room, and it being about\r\nnoontide the clear air was motionless and quiet without. From a\r\ndistance came voices; and an apparent noise of persons stamping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the Doctors in the theatre, conferring Honorary degrees on\r\nthe Duke of Hamptonshire and a lot more illustrious gents of that sort.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s Remembrance Week, you know. The cheers come from the young men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye; young and strong-lunged! Not like our poor boy here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn occasional word, as from some one making a speech, floated from the\r\nopen windows of the theatre across to this quiet corner, at which there\r\nseemed to be a smile of some sort upon the marble features of Jude;\r\nwhile the old, superseded, Delphin editions of Virgil and Horace, and\r\nthe dog-eared Greek Testament on the neighbouring shelf, and the few\r\nother volumes of the sort that he had not parted with, roughened with\r\nstone-dust where he had been in the habit of catching them up for a few\r\nminutes between his labours, seemed to pale to a sickly cast at the\r\nsounds. The bells struck out joyously; and their reverberations\r\ntravelled round the bed-room.\r\n\r\nArabella\xe2\x80\x99s eyes removed from Jude to Mrs. Edlin. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye think she will\r\ncome?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not say. She swore not to see him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is she looking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTired and miserable, poor heart. Years and years older than when you\r\nsaw her last. Quite a staid, worn woman now. \xe2\x80\x99Tis the man\xe2\x80\x94she can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstomach un, even now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Jude had been alive to see her, he would hardly have cared for her\r\nany more, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what we don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\xa6 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he ever ask you to send for her,\r\nsince he came to see her in that strange way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Quite the contrary. I offered to send, and he said I was not to\r\nlet her know how ill he was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he forgive her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94poor little thing, \xe2\x80\x99tis to be believed she\xe2\x80\x99s found forgiveness\r\nsomewhere! She said she had found peace!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may swear that on her knees to the holy cross upon her necklace\r\ntill she\xe2\x80\x99s hoarse, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t be true!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arabella. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s never\r\nfound peace since she left his arms, and never will again till she\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nhe is now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JUDE THE OBSCURE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
