J. Hogarth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. WHAT I CONSIDER TO HAVE BEEN THE BEGINNING OF MY YOUTH\r\n\r\nI have said that my friendship with Dimitri opened up for me a new view\r\nof my life and of its aim and relations. The essence of that view lay\r\nin the conviction that the destiny of man is to strive for moral\r\nimprovement, and that such improvement is at once easy, possible, and\r\nlasting. Hitherto, however, I had found pleasure only in the new ideas\r\nwhich I discovered to arise from that conviction, and in the forming of\r\nbrilliant plans for a moral, active future, while all the time my life\r\nhad been continuing along its old petty, muddled, pleasure-seeking\r\ncourse, and the same virtuous thoughts which I and my adored friend\r\nDimitri ("my own marvellous Mitia," as I used to call him to myself in\r\na whisper) had been wont to exchange with one another still pleased my\r\nintellect, but left my sensibility untouched. Nevertheless there came\r\na moment when those thoughts swept into my head with a sudden freshness\r\nand force of moral revelation which left me aghast at the amount of\r\ntime which I had been wasting, and made me feel as though I must at\r\nonce--that very second--apply those thoughts to life, with the firm\r\nintention of never again changing them.\r\n\r\nIt is from that moment that I date the beginning of my youth.\r\n\r\nI was then nearly sixteen. Tutors still attended to give me lessons,\r\nSt. Jerome still acted as general supervisor of my education, and,\r\nwilly-nilly, I was being prepared for the University. In addition to my\r\nstudies, my occupations included certain vague dreamings and ponderings,\r\na number of gymnastic exercises to make myself the finest athlete in the\r\nworld, a good deal of aimless, thoughtless wandering through the rooms\r\nof the house (but more especially along the maidservants\' corridor), and\r\nmuch looking at myself in the mirror. From the latter, however, I always\r\nturned away with a vague feeling of depression, almost of repulsion. Not\r\nonly did I feel sure that my exterior was ugly, but I could derive no\r\ncomfort from any of the usual consolations under such circumstances. I\r\ncould not say, for instance, that I had at least an expressive, clever,\r\nor refined face, for there was nothing whatever expressive about it. Its\r\nfeatures were of the most humdrum, dull, and unbecoming type, with small\r\ngrey eyes which seemed to me, whenever I regarded them in the mirror,\r\nto be stupid rather than clever. Of manly bearing I possessed even less,\r\nsince, although I was not exactly small of stature, and had, moreover,\r\nplenty of strength for my years, every feature in my face was of the\r\nmeek, sleepy-looking, indefinite type. Even refinement was lacking\r\nin it, since, on the contrary, it precisely resembled that of a\r\nsimple-looking moujik, while I also had the same big hands and feet as\r\nhe. At the time, all this seemed to me very shameful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SPRINGTIME\r\n\r\nEaster of the year when I entered the University fell late in April, so\r\nthat the examinations were fixed for St. Thomas\'s Week, [Easter week.]\r\nand I had to spend Good Friday in fasting and finally getting myself\r\nready for the ordeal.\r\n\r\nFollowing upon wet snow (the kind of stuff which Karl Ivanitch used to\r\ndescribe as "a child following, its father"), the weather had for three\r\ndays been bright and mild and still. Not a clot of snow was now to be\r\nseen in the streets, and the dirty slush had given place to wet, shining\r\npavements and coursing rivulets. The last icicles on the roofs were fast\r\nmelting in the sunshine, buds were swelling on the trees in the little\r\ngarden, the path leading across the courtyard to the stables was soft\r\ninstead of being a frozen ridge of mud, and mossy grass was showing\r\ngreen between the stones around the entrance-steps. It was just that\r\nparticular time in spring when the season exercises the strongest\r\ninfluence upon the human soul--when clear sunlight illuminates\r\neverything, yet sheds no warmth, when rivulets run trickling under one\'s\r\nfeet, when the air is charged with an odorous freshness, and when the\r\nbright blue sky is streaked with long, transparent clouds.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or another the influence of this early stage in the\r\nbirth of spring always seems to me more perceptible and more impressive\r\nin a great town than in the country. One sees less, but one feels more.\r\nI was standing near the window--through the double frames of which the\r\nmorning sun was throwing its mote-flecked beams upon the floor of what\r\nseemed to me my intolerably wearisome schoolroom--and working out a\r\nlong algebraical equation on the blackboard. In one hand I was holding a\r\nragged, long-suffering "Algebra" and in the other a small piece of chalk\r\nwhich had already besmeared my hands, my face, and the elbows of my\r\njacket. Nicola, clad in an apron, and with his sleeves rolled up, was\r\npicking out the putty from the window-frames with a pair of nippers, and\r\nunfastening the screws. The window looked out upon the little garden. At\r\nlength his occupation and the noise which he was making over it arrested\r\nmy attention. At the moment I was in a very cross, dissatisfied frame of\r\nmind, for nothing seemed to be going right with me. I had made a mistake\r\nat the very beginning of my algebra, and so should have to work it out\r\nagain; twice I had let the chalk drop. I was conscious that my hands and\r\nface were whitened all over; the sponge had rolled away into a corner;\r\nand the noise of Nicola\'s operations was fast getting on my nerves. I\r\nhad a feeling as though I wanted to fly into a temper and grumble at\r\nsome one, so I threw down chalk and "Algebra" alike, and began to\r\npace the room. Then suddenly I remembered that to-day we were to go to\r\nconfession, and that therefore I must refrain from doing anything\r\nwrong. Next, with equal suddenness I relapsed into an extraordinarily\r\ngoodhumoured frame of mind, and walked across to Nicola.\r\n\r\n"Let me help you, Nicola," I said, trying to speak as pleasantly as I\r\npossibly could. The idea that I was performing a meritorious action in\r\nthus suppressing my ill-temper and offering to help him increased my\r\ngood-humour all the more.\r\n\r\nBy this time the putty had been chipped out, and the screws removed,\r\nyet, though Nicola pulled with might and main at the cross-piece, the\r\nwindow-frame refused to budge.\r\n\r\n"If it comes out as soon as he and I begin to pull at it together," I\r\nthought, "it will be rather a shame, as then I shall have nothing more\r\nof the kind to do to-day."\r\n\r\nSuddenly the frame yielded a little at one side, and came out.\r\n\r\n"Where shall I put it?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Let ME see to it, if you please," replied Nicola, evidently surprised\r\nas well as, seemingly, not over-pleased at my zeal. "We must not leave\r\nit here, but carry it away to the lumber-room, where I keep all the\r\nframes stored and numbered."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I can manage it," I said as I lifted it up. I verily believe\r\nthat if the lumber-room had been a couple of versts away, and the frame\r\ntwice as heavy as it was, I should have been the more pleased. I felt\r\nas though I wanted to tire myself out in performing this service for\r\nNicola. When I returned to the room the bricks and screws had been\r\nreplaced on the windowsill, and Nicola was sweeping the debris, as well\r\nas a few torpid flies, out of the open window. The fresh, fragrant air\r\nwas rushing into and filling all the room, while with it came also the\r\ndull murmur of the city and the twittering of sparrows in the garden.\r\nEverything was in brilliant light, the room looked cheerful, and a\r\ngentle spring breeze was stirring Nicola\'s hair and the leaves of my\r\n"Algebra." Approaching the window, I sat down upon the sill, turned my\r\neyes downwards towards the garden, and fell into a brown study.\r\n\r\nSomething new to me, something extraordinarily potent and unfamiliar,\r\nhad suddenly invaded my soul. The wet ground on which, here and there,\r\na few yellowish stalks and blades of bright-green grass were to be seen;\r\nthe little rivulets glittering in the sunshine, and sweeping clods of\r\nearth and tiny chips of wood along with them; the reddish twigs of the\r\nlilac, with their swelling buds, which nodded just beneath the window;\r\nthe fussy twitterings of birds as they fluttered in the bush below; the\r\nblackened fence shining wet from the snow which had lately melted off\r\nit; and, most of all, the raw, odorous air and radiant sunlight--all\r\nspoke to me, clearly and unmistakably, of something new and beautiful,\r\nof something which, though I cannot repeat it here as it was then\r\nexpressed to me, I will try to reproduce so far as I understood it.\r\nEverything spoke to me of beauty, happiness, and virtue--as three things\r\nwhich were both easy and possible for me--and said that no one of them\r\ncould exist without the other two, since beauty, happiness, and virtue\r\nwere one. "How did I never come to understand that before?" I cried to\r\nmyself. "How did I ever manage to be so wicked? Oh, but how good, how\r\nhappy, I could be--nay, I WILL be--in the future! At once, at once--yes,\r\nthis very minute--I will become another being, and begin to live\r\ndifferently!" For all that, I continued sitting on the window-sill,\r\ncontinued merely dreaming, and doing nothing. Have you ever, on a\r\nsummer\'s day, gone to bed in dull, rainy weather, and, waking just\r\nat sunset, opened your eyes and seen through the square space of the\r\nwindow--the space where the linen blind is blowing up and down, and\r\nbeating its rod upon the window-sill--the rain-soaked, shadowy, purple\r\nvista of an avenue of lime-trees, with a damp garden path lit up by the\r\nclear, slanting beams of the sun, and then suddenly heard the joyous\r\nsounds of bird life in the garden, and seen insects flying to and fro at\r\nthe open window, and glittering in the sunlight, and smelt the fragrance\r\nof the rain-washed air, and thought to yourself, "Am I not ashamed to be\r\nlying in bed on such an evening as this?" and, leaping joyously to your\r\nfeet, gone out into the garden and revelled in all that welter of\r\nlife? If you have, then you can imagine for yourself the overpowering\r\nsensation which was then possessing me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. DREAMS\r\n\r\n"To-day I will make my confession and purge myself of every sin," I\r\nthought to myself. "Nor will I ever commit another one." At this point I\r\nrecalled all the peccadilloes which most troubled my conscience. "I will\r\ngo to church regularly every Sunday, as well as read the Gospel at the\r\nclose of every hour throughout the day. What is more, I will set aside,\r\nout of the cheque which I shall receive each month after I have gone\r\nto the University, two-and-a-half roubles" (a tenth of my monthly\r\nallowance) "for people who are poor but not exactly beggars, yet without\r\nletting any one know anything about it. Yes, I will begin to look out\r\nfor people like that--orphans or old women--at once, yet never tell a\r\nsoul what I am doing for them.\r\n\r\n"Also, I will have a room here of my very own (St. Jerome\'s, probably),\r\nand look after it myself, and keep it perfectly clean. I will never let\r\nany one do anything for me, for every one is just a human being like\r\nmyself. Likewise I will walk every day, not drive, to the University.\r\nEven if some one gives me a drozhki [Russian phaeton.] I will sell\r\nit, and devote the money to the poor. Everything I will do exactly and\r\nalways" (what that "always" meant I could not possibly have said, but at\r\nleast I had a vivid consciousness of its connoting some kind of\r\nprudent, moral, and irreproachable life). "I will get up all my lectures\r\nthoroughly, and go over all the subjects beforehand, so that at the\r\nend of my first course I may come out top and write a thesis. During my\r\nsecond course also I will get up everything beforehand, so that I may\r\nsoon be transferred to the third course, and at eighteen come out top in\r\nthe examinations, and receive two gold medals, and go on to be Master of\r\nArts, and Doctor, and the first scholar in Europe. Yes, in all Europe I\r\nmean to be the first scholar.--Well, what next?" I asked myself at this\r\npoint. Suddenly it struck me that dreams of this sort were a form of\r\npride--a sin which I should have to confess to the priest that very\r\nevening, so I returned to the original thread of my meditations.\r\n"When getting up my lectures I will go to the Vorobievi Gori, [Sparrow\r\nHills--a public park near Moscow.] and choose some spot under a tree,\r\nand read my lectures over there. Sometimes I will take with me something\r\nto eat--cheese or a pie from Pedotti\'s, or something of the kind. After\r\nthat I will sleep a little, and then read some good book or other, or\r\nelse draw pictures or play on some instrument (certainly I must learn to\r\nplay the flute). Perhaps SHE too will be walking on the Vorobievi Gori,\r\nand will approach me one day and say, \'Who are you?\' and I shall look at\r\nher, oh, so sadly, and say that I am the son of a priest, and that I am\r\nhappy only when I am there alone, quite alone. Then she will give me her\r\nhand, and say something to me, and sit down beside me. So every day we\r\nshall go to the same spot, and be friends together, and I shall kiss\r\nher. But no! That would not be right! On the contrary, from this day\r\nforward I never mean to look at a woman again. Never, never again do I\r\nmean to walk with a girl, nor even to go near one if I can help it. Yet,\r\nof course, in three years\' time, when I have come of age, I shall\r\nmarry. Also, I mean to take as much exercise as ever I can, and to do\r\ngymnastics every day, so that, when I have turned twenty-five, I shall\r\nbe stronger even than Rappo. On my first day\'s training I mean to hold\r\nout half a pood [The Pood = 40 Russian pounds.] at arm\'s length for\r\nfive minutes, and the next day twenty-one pounds, and the third day\r\ntwenty-two pounds, and so on, until at last I can hold out four poods\r\nin each hand, and be stronger even than a porter. Then, if ever any one\r\nshould try to insult me or should begin to speak disrespectfully of HER,\r\nI shall take him so, by the front of his coat, and lift him up an arshin\r\n[The arshin = 2 feet 3 inches.] or two with one hand, and just hold him\r\nthere, so that he may feel my strength and cease from his conduct. Yet\r\nthat too would not be right. No, no, it would not matter; I should not\r\nhurt him, merely show him that I--"\r\n\r\nLet no one blame me because the dreams of my youth were as foolish as\r\nthose of my childhood and boyhood. I am sure that, even if it be my fate\r\nto live to extreme old age and to continue my story with the years, I,\r\nan old man of seventy, shall be found dreaming dreams just as impossible\r\nand childish as those I am dreaming now. I shall be dreaming of some\r\nlovely Maria who loves me, the toothless old man, as she might love a\r\nMazeppa; of some imbecile son who, through some extraordinary chance,\r\nhas suddenly become a minister of state; of my suddenly receiving a\r\nwindfall of a million of roubles. I am sure that there exists no human\r\nbeing, no human age, to whom or to which that gracious, consolatory\r\npower of dreaming is totally a stranger. Yet, save for the one general\r\nfeature of magic and impossibility, the dreams of each human being, of\r\neach age of man, have their own distinguishing characteristics. At the\r\nperiod upon which I look as having marked the close of my boyhood and\r\nthe beginning of my youth, four leading sentiments formed the basis\r\nof my dreams. The first of those sentiments was love for HER--for an\r\nimaginary woman whom I always pictured the same in my dreams, and whom I\r\nsomehow expected to meet some day and somewhere. This she of mine had a\r\nlittle of Sonetchka in her, a little of Masha as Masha could look when\r\nshe stood washing linen over the clothes-tub, and a little of a certain\r\nwoman with pearls round her fair white neck whom I had once seen long,\r\nlong ago at a theatre, in a box below our own. My second sentiment was a\r\ncraving for love. I wanted every one to know me and to love me. I wanted\r\nto be able to utter my name--Nicola Irtenieff--and at once to see every\r\none thunderstruck at it, and come crowding round me and thanking me for\r\nsomething or another, I hardly knew what. My third sentiment was\r\nthe expectation of some extraordinary, glorious happiness that was\r\nimpending--some happiness so strong and assured as to verge upon\r\necstasy. Indeed, so firmly persuaded was I that very, very soon some\r\nunexpected chance would suddenly make me the richest and most famous\r\nman in the world that I lived in constant, tremulous expectation of this\r\nmagic good fortune befalling me. I was always thinking to myself\r\nthat "IT is beginning," and that I should go on thereafter to attain\r\neverything that a man could wish for. Consequently, I was for\r\never hurrying from place to place, in the belief that "IT" must be\r\n"beginning" just where I happened not to be. Lastly, my fourth and\r\nprincipal sentiment of all was abhorrence of myself, mingled with\r\nregret--yet a regret so blended with the certain expectation of\r\nhappiness to which I have referred that it had in it nothing of sorrow.\r\nIt seemed to me that it would be so easy and natural for me to tear\r\nmyself away from my past and to remake it--to forget all that had been,\r\nand to begin my life, with all its relations, anew--that the past never\r\ntroubled me, never clung to me at all. I even found a certain pleasure\r\nin detesting the past, and in seeing it in a darker light than the true\r\none. This note of regret and of a curious longing for perfection were\r\nthe chief mental impressions which I gathered from that new stage of my\r\ngrowth--impressions which imparted new principles to my view of myself,\r\nof men, and of God\'s world. O good and consoling voice, which in later\r\ndays, in sorrowful days when my soul yielded silently to the sway of\r\nlife\'s falseness and depravity, so often raised a sudden, bold\r\nprotest against all iniquity, as well as mercilessly exposed the\r\npast, commanded, nay, compelled, me to love only the pure vista of the\r\npresent, and promised me all that was fair and happy in the future! O\r\ngood and consoling voice! Surely the day will never come when you are\r\nsilent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. OUR FAMILY CIRCLE\r\n\r\nPAPA was seldom at home that spring. Yet, whenever he was so, he seemed\r\nextraordinarily cheerful as he either strummed his favourite pieces on\r\nthe piano or looked roguishly at us and made jokes about us all, not\r\nexcluding even Mimi. For instance, he would say that the Tsarevitch\r\nhimself had seen Mimi at the rink, and fallen so much in love with her\r\nthat he had presented a petition to the Synod for divorce; or else\r\nthat I had been granted an appointment as secretary to the Austrian\r\nambassador--a piece of news which he imparted to us with a perfectly\r\ngrave face. Next, he would frighten Katenka with some spiders (of which\r\nshe was very much afraid), engage in an animated conversation with our\r\nfriends Dubkoff and Nechludoff, and tell us and our guests, over and\r\nover again, his plans for the year. Although these plans changed almost\r\nfrom day to day, and were for ever contradicting one another, they\r\nseemed so attractive that we were always glad to listen to them, and\r\nLubotshka, in particular, would glue her eyes to his face, so as not to\r\nlose a single word. One day his plan would be that he should leave my\r\nbrother and myself at the University, and go and live with Lubotshka\r\nin Italy for two years. Next, the plan would be that he should buy an\r\nestate on the south coast of the Crimea, and take us for an annual visit\r\nthere; next, that we should migrate en masse to St. Petersburg; and so\r\nforth. Yet, in addition to this unusual cheerfulness of his, another\r\nchange had come over him of late--a change which greatly surprised\r\nme. This was that he had had some fashionable clothes made--an\r\nolive-coloured frockcoat, smart trousers with straps at the sides, and a\r\nlong wadded greatcoat which fitted him to perfection. Often, too, there\r\nwas a delightful smell of scent about him when he came home from a\r\nparty--more especially when he had been to see a lady of whom Mimi never\r\nspoke but with a sigh and a face that seemed to say: "Poor orphans! How\r\ndreadful! It is a good thing that SHE is gone now!" and so on, and\r\nso on. From Nicola (for Papa never spoke to us of his gambling) I had\r\nlearnt that he (Papa) had been very fortunate in play that winter, and\r\nso had won an extraordinary amount of money, all of which he had\r\nplaced in the bank after vowing that he would play no more that spring.\r\nEvidently, it was his fear of being unable to resist again doing so that\r\nwas rendering him anxious to leave for the country as soon as possible.\r\nIndeed, he ended by deciding not to wait until I had entered the\r\nUniversity, but to take the girls to Petrovskoe immediately after\r\nEaster, and to leave Woloda and myself to follow them at a later season.\r\n\r\nAll that winter, until the opening of spring, Woloda had been\r\ninseparable from Dubkoff, while at the same time the pair of them had\r\ncooled greatly towards Dimitri. Their chief amusements (so I gathered\r\nfrom conversations overheard) were continual drinking of champagne,\r\nsledge-driving past the windows of a lady with whom both of them\r\nappeared to be in love, and dancing with her--not at children\'s parties,\r\neither, but at real balls! It was this last fact which, despite our love\r\nfor one another, placed a vast gulf between Woloda and myself. We felt\r\nthat the distance between a boy still taking lessons under a tutor and\r\na man who danced at real, grown-up balls was too great to allow of their\r\nexchanging mutual ideas. Katenka, too, seemed grown-up now, and read\r\ninnumerable novels; so that the idea that she would some day be getting\r\nmarried no longer seemed to me a joke. Yet, though she and Woloda were\r\nthus grown-up, they never made friends with one another, but, on the\r\ncontrary, seemed to cherish a mutual contempt. In general, when Katenka\r\nwas at home alone, nothing but novels amused her, and they but slightly;\r\nbut as soon as ever a visitor of the opposite sex called, she at once\r\ngrew lively and amiable, and used her eyes for saying things which I\r\ncould not then understand. It was only later, when she one day informed\r\nme in conversation that the only thing a girl was allowed to indulge\r\nin was coquetry--coquetry of the eyes, I mean--that I understood those\r\nstrange contortions of her features which to every one else had seemed a\r\nmatter for no surprise at all. Lubotshka also had begun to wear what\r\nwas almost a long dress--a dress which almost concealed her goose-shaped\r\nfeet; yet she still remained as ready a weeper as ever. She dreamed\r\nnow of marrying, not a hussar, but a singer or an instrumentalist, and\r\naccordingly applied herself to her music with greater diligence than\r\never. St. Jerome, who knew that he was going to remain with us only\r\nuntil my examinations were over, and so had obtained for himself a new\r\npost in the family of some count or another, now looked with contempt\r\nupon the members of our household. He stayed indoors very little, took\r\nto smoking cigarettes (then all the rage), and was for ever whistling\r\nlively tunes on the edge of a card. Mimi daily grew more and more\r\ndespondent, as though, now that we were beginning to grow up, she looked\r\nfor nothing good from any one or anything.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the day of which I am speaking, I went in to luncheon I found\r\nonly Mimi, Katenka, Lubotshka, and St. Jerome in the dining-room. Papa\r\nwas away, and Woloda in his own room, doing some preparation work for\r\nhis examinations in company with a party of his comrades: wherefore he\r\nhad requested that lunch should be sent to him there. Of late, Mimi had\r\nusually taken the head of the table, and as none of us had any respect\r\nfor her, luncheon had lost most of its refinement and charm. That is\r\nto say, the meal was no longer what it had been in Mamma\'s or our\r\ngrandmother\'s time, namely, a kind of rite which brought all the family\r\ntogether at a given hour and divided the day into two halves. We allowed\r\nourselves to come in as late as the second course, to drink wine in\r\ntumblers (St. Jerome himself set us the example), to roll about on our\r\nchairs, to depart without saying grace, and so on. In fact, luncheon had\r\nceased to be a family ceremony. In the old days at Petrovskoe, every one\r\nhad been used to wash and dress for the meal, and then to repair to the\r\ndrawing-room as the appointed hour (two o\'clock) drew near, and pass\r\nthe time of waiting in lively conversation. Just as the clock in the\r\nservants\' hall was beginning to whirr before striking the hour, Foka\r\nwould enter with noiseless footsteps, and, throwing his napkin over his\r\narm and assuming a dignified, rather severe expression, would say in\r\nloud, measured tones: "Luncheon is ready!" Thereupon, with pleased,\r\ncheerful faces, we would form a procession--the elders going first and\r\nthe juniors following, and, with much rustling of starched petticoats\r\nand subdued creaking of boots and shoes--would proceed to the\r\ndining-room, where, still talking in undertones, the company would seat\r\nthemselves in their accustomed places. Or, again, at Moscow, we would\r\nall of us be standing before the table ready-laid in the hall, talking\r\nquietly among ourselves as we waited for our grandmother, whom the\r\nbutler, Gabriel, had gone to acquaint with the fact that luncheon was\r\nready. Suddenly the door would open, there would come the faint swish\r\nof a dress and the sound of footsteps, and our grandmother--dressed in a\r\nmob-cap trimmed with a quaint old lilac bow, and wearing either a smile\r\nor a severe expression on her face according as the state of her health\r\ninclined her--would issue from her room. Gabriel would hasten to precede\r\nher to her arm-chair, the other chairs would make a scraping sound, and,\r\nwith a feeling as though a cold shiver (the precursor of appetite)\r\nwere running down one\'s back, one would seize upon one\'s damp, starched\r\nnapkin, nibble a morsel or two of bread, and, rubbing one\'s hands softly\r\nunder the table, gaze with eager, radiant impatience at the steaming\r\nplates of soup which the butler was beginning to dispense in order of\r\nranks and ages or according to the favour of our grandmother.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, however, I was conscious of neither excitement\r\nnor pleasure when I went in to luncheon. Even the mingled chatter of\r\nMimi, the girls, and St. Jerome about the horrible boots of our Russian\r\ntutor, the pleated dresses worn by the young Princesses Kornakoff, and\r\nso forth (chatter which at any other time would have filled me with\r\na sincerity of contempt which I should have been at no pains to\r\nconceal--at all events so far as Lubotshka and Katenka were concerned),\r\nfailed to shake the benevolent frame of mind into which I had fallen. I\r\nwas unusually good-humoured that day, and listened to everything with\r\na smile and a studied air of kindness. Even when I asked for the kvas I\r\ndid so politely, while I lost not a moment in agreeing with St. Jerome\r\nwhen he told me that it was undoubtedly more correct to say "Je peux"\r\nthan "Je puis." Yet, I must confess to a certain disappointment at\r\nfinding that no one paid any particular attention to my politeness and\r\ngood-humour. After luncheon, Lubotshka showed me a paper on which\r\nshe had written down a list of her sins: upon which I observed that,\r\nalthough the idea was excellent so far as it went, it would be still\r\nbetter for her to write down her sins on her SOUL--"a very different\r\nmatter."\r\n\r\n"Why is it \'a very different matter\'?" asked Lubotshka.\r\n\r\n"Never mind: that is all right; you do not understand me," and I went\r\nupstairs to my room, telling St. Jerome that I was going to work, but in\r\nreality purposing to occupy the hour and a half before confession time\r\nin writing down a list of my daily tasks and duties which should last me\r\nall my life, together with a statement of my life\'s aim, and the rules\r\nby which I meant unswervingly to be guided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. MY RULES\r\n\r\nI TOOK some sheets of paper, and tried, first of all, to make a list of\r\nmy tasks and duties for the coming year. The paper needed ruling, but,\r\nas I could not find the ruler, I had to use a Latin dictionary instead.\r\nThe result was that, when I had drawn the pen along the edge of the\r\ndictionary and removed the latter, I found that, in place of a line, I\r\nhad only made an oblong smudge on the paper, since the dictionary was\r\nnot long enough to reach across it, and the pen had slipped round the\r\nsoft, yielding corner of the book. Thereupon I took another piece of\r\npaper, and, by carefully manipulating the dictionary, contrived to\r\nrule what at least RESEMBLED lines. Dividing my duties into three\r\nsections--my duties to myself, my duties to my neighbour, and my duties\r\nto God--I started to indite a list of the first of those sections, but\r\nthey seemed to me so numerous, and therefore requiring to be divided\r\ninto so many species and subdivisions, that I thought I had better first\r\nof all write down the heading of "Rules of My Life" before proceeding to\r\ntheir detailed inscription. Accordingly, I proceeded to write "Rules of\r\nMy Life" on the outside of the six sheets of paper which I had made into\r\na sort of folio, but the words came out in such a crooked and uneven\r\nscrawl that for long I sat debating the question, "Shall I write\r\nthem again?"--for long, sat in agonised contemplation of the ragged\r\nhandwriting and disfigured title-page. Why was it that all the beauty\r\nand clarity which my soul then contained came out so misshapenly\r\non paper (as in life itself) just when I was wishing to apply those\r\nqualities to what I was thinking at the moment?\r\n\r\n"The priest is here, so please come downstairs and hear his directions,"\r\nsaid Nicola as he entered.\r\n\r\nHurriedly concealing my folio under the table-cloth, I looked at myself\r\nin the mirror, combed my hair upwards (I imagined this to give me a\r\npensive air), and descended to the divannaia, [Room with divans, or\r\nante-room] where the table stood covered with a cloth and had an ikon\r\nand candles placed upon it. Papa entered just as I did, but by another\r\ndoor: whereupon the priest--a grey-headed old monk with a severe,\r\nelderly face--blessed him, and Papa kissed his small, squat, wizened\r\nhand. I did the same.\r\n\r\n"Go and call Woldemar," said Papa. "Where is he? Wait a minute, though.\r\nPerhaps he is preparing for the Communion at the University?"\r\n\r\n"No, he is with the Prince," said Katenka, and glanced at Lubotshka.\r\nSuddenly the latter blushed for some reason or another, and then\r\nfrowned. Finally, pretending that she was not well, she left the room,\r\nand I followed her. In the drawing-room she halted, and began to pencil\r\nsomething fresh on her paper of peccadilloes.\r\n\r\n"Well, what new sin have you gone and committed?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," she replied with another blush. All at once we heard\r\nDimitri\'s voice raised in the hall as he took his leave of Woloda.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me you are always experiencing some new temptation," said\r\nKatenka, who had entered the room behind us, and now stood looking at\r\nLubotshka.\r\n\r\nWhat was the matter with my sister I could not conceive, but she was\r\nnow so agitated that the tears were starting from her eyes. Finally her\r\nconfusion grew uncontrollable, and vented itself in rage against both\r\nherself and Katenka, who appeared to be teasing her.\r\n\r\n"Any one can see that you are a FOREIGNER!" she cried (nothing offended\r\nKatenka so much as to be called by that term, which is why Lubotshka\r\nused it). "Just because I have the secret of which you know," she went\r\non, with anger ringing through her tone, "you purposely go and upset me!\r\nPlease do understand that it is no joking matter."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what she has gone and written on her paper, Nicolinka?"\r\ncried Katenka, much infuriated by the term "foreigner." "She has written\r\ndown that--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I never could have believed that you could be so cruel!" exclaimed\r\nLubotshka, now bursting into open sobbing as she moved away from us.\r\n"You chose that moment on purpose! You spend your whole time in trying\r\nto make me sin! I\'ll never go to YOU again for sympathy and advice!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. CONFESSION\r\n\r\nWith these and other disjointed impressions in my mind, I returned to\r\nthe divannaia. As soon as every one had reassembled, the priest rose\r\nand prepared to read the prayer before confession. The instant that\r\nthe silence was broken by the stern, expressive voice of the monk as\r\nhe recited the prayer--and more especially when he addressed to us\r\nthe words: "Reveal thou all thy sins without shame, concealment, or\r\nextenuation, and let thy soul be cleansed before God: for if thou\r\nconcealest aught, then great will be thy sin"--the same sensation of\r\nreverent awe came over me as I had felt during the morning. I even took\r\na certain pleasure in recognising this condition of mine, and strove to\r\npreserve it, not only by restraining all other thoughts from entering\r\nmy brain, but also by consciously exerting myself to feel no other\r\nsensation than this same one of reverence.\r\n\r\nPapa was the first to go to confession. He remained a long, long time in\r\nthe room which had belonged to our grandmother, and during that time\r\nthe rest of us kept silence in the divannaia, or only whispered to one\r\nanother on the subject of who should precede whom. At length, the voice\r\nof the priest again reading the prayer sounded from the doorway, and\r\nthen Papa\'s footsteps. The door creaked as he came out, coughing and\r\nholding one shoulder higher than the other, in his usual way, and for\r\nthe moment he did not look at any of us.\r\n\r\n"YOU go now, Luba," he said presently, as he gave her cheek a\r\nmischievous pinch. "Mind you tell him everything. You are my greatest\r\nsinner, you know."\r\n\r\nLubotshka went red and pale by turns, took her memorandum paper out of\r\nher apron, replaced it, and finally moved away towards the doorway with\r\nher head sunk between her shoulders as though she expected to receive\r\na blow upon it from above. She was not long gone, and when she returned\r\nher shoulders were shaking with sobs.\r\n\r\nAt length--next after the excellent Katenka (who came out of the doorway\r\nwith a smile on her face)--my turn arrived. I entered the dimly-lighted\r\nroom with the same vague feeling of awe, the same conscious eagerness to\r\narouse that feeling more and more in my soul, that had possessed me up\r\nto the present moment. The priest, standing in front of a reading-desk,\r\nslowly turned his face to me.\r\n\r\nI was not more than five minutes in the room, but came out from it happy\r\nand (so I persuaded myself) entirely cleansed--a new, a morally reborn\r\nindividual. Despite the fact that the old surroundings of my life now\r\nstruck me as unfamiliar (even though the rooms, the furniture, and my\r\nown figure--would to heavens that I could have changed my outer man for\r\nthe better in the same way that I believed myself to have changed\r\nmy inner I--were the same as before), I remained in that comfortable\r\nattitude of mine until the very moment of bedtime.\r\n\r\nYet, no sooner had I begun to grow drowsy with the conning over of my\r\nsins than in a flash I recollected a particularly shameful sin which\r\nI had suppressed at confession time. Instantly the words of the prayer\r\nbefore confession came back to my memory and began sounding in my ears.\r\nMy peace was gone for ever. "For if thou concealest aught, then great\r\nwill be thy sin." Each time that the phrase recurred to me I saw myself\r\na sinner for whom no punishment was adequate. Long did I toss from side\r\nto side as I considered my position, while expecting every moment to\r\nbe visited with the divine wrath--to be struck with sudden death,\r\nperhaps!--an insupportable thought! Then suddenly the reassuring thought\r\noccurred to me: "Why should I not drive out to the monastery when the\r\nmorning comes, and see the priest again, and make a second confession?"\r\nThereafter I grew calmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE EXPEDITION TO THE MONASTERY\r\n\r\nSeveral times that night I woke in terror at the thought that I might\r\nbe oversleeping myself, and by six o\'clock was out of bed, although the\r\ndawn was hardly peeping in at the window. I put on my clothes and boots\r\n(all of which were lying tumbled and unbrushed beside the bed, since\r\nNicola, of course had not been in yet to tidy them up), and, without a\r\nprayer said or my face washed, emerged, for the first time in my life,\r\ninto the street ALONE.\r\n\r\nOver the way, behind the green roof of a large building, the dim, cold\r\ndawn was beginning to blush red. The keen frost of the spring morning\r\nwhich had stiffened the pools and mud and made them crackle under my\r\nfeet now nipped my face and hands also. Not a cab was to be seen, though\r\nI had counted upon one to make the journey out and home the quicker.\r\nOnly a file of waggons was rumbling along the Arbat Prospect, and a\r\ncouple of bricklayers talking noisily together as they strode along the\r\npavement. However, after walking a verst or so I began to meet men and\r\nwomen taking baskets to market or going with empty barrels to fetch the\r\nday\'s water supply; until at length, at the cross streets near the Arbat\r\nGate, where a pieman had set up his stall and a baker was just opening\r\nhis shop, I espied an old cabman shaking himself after indulging in a\r\nnap on the box of his be-scratched old blue-painted, hobble-de-hoy wreck\r\nof a drozhki. He seemed barely awake as he asked twenty copecks as the\r\nfare to the monastery and back, but came to himself a moment afterwards,\r\njust as I was about to get in, and, touching up his horse with the spare\r\nend of the reins, started to drive off and leave me. "My horse wants\r\nfeeding," he growled, "I can\'t take you, barin.[Sir]"\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty and a promise of FORTY copecks I persuaded him to\r\nstop. He eyed me narrowly as he pulled up, but nevertheless said: "Very\r\nwell. Get in, barin." I must confess that I had some qualms lest he\r\nshould drive me to a quiet corner somewhere, and then rob me, but I\r\ncaught hold of the collar of his ragged driving-coat, close to where his\r\nwrinkled neck showed sadly lean above his hunched-up back, and climbed\r\non to the blue-painted, curved, rickety scat. As we set off along\r\nVozdvizhenka Street, I noticed that the back of the drozhki was covered\r\nwith a strip of the same greenish material as that of which his coat was\r\nmade. For some reason or another this reassured me, and I no longer felt\r\nnervous of being taken to a quiet spot and robbed.\r\n\r\nThe sun had risen to a good height, and was gilding the cupolas of the\r\nchurches, when we arrived at the monastery. In the shade the frost had\r\nnot yet given, but in the open roadway muddy rivulets of water were\r\ncoursing along, and it was through fast-thawing mire that the horse went\r\nclip-clopping his way. Alighting, and entering the monastery grounds, I\r\ninquired of the first monk whom I met where I could find the priest whom\r\nI was seeking.\r\n\r\n"His cell is over there," replied the monk as he stopped a moment and\r\npointed towards a little building up to which a flight of steps led.\r\n\r\n"I respectfully thank you," I said, and then fell to wondering what all\r\nthe monks (who at that moment began to come filing out of the church)\r\nmust be thinking of me as they glanced in my direction. I was neither a\r\ngrown-up nor a child, while my face was unwashed, my hair unbrushed,\r\nmy clothes tumbled, and my boots unblacked and muddy. To what class\r\nof persons were the brethren assigning me--for they stared at me hard\r\nenough? Nevertheless I proceeded in the direction which the young priest\r\nhad pointed out to me.\r\n\r\nAn old man with bushy grey eyebrows and a black cassock met me on the\r\nnarrow path to the cells, and asked me what I wanted. For a brief moment\r\nI felt inclined to say "Nothing," and then run back to the drozhki and\r\ndrive away home; but, for all its beetling brows, the face of the old\r\nman inspired confidence, and I merely said that I wished to see the\r\npriest (whom I named).\r\n\r\n"Very well, young sir; I will take you to him," said the old man as he\r\nturned round. Clearly he had guessed my errand at a stroke. "The father\r\nis at matins at this moment, but he will soon be back," and, opening\r\na door, the old man led me through a neat hall and corridor, all lined\r\nwith clean matting, to a cell.\r\n\r\n"Please to wait here," he added, and then, with a kind, reassuring\r\nglance, departed.\r\n\r\nThe little room in which I found myself was of the smallest possible\r\ndimensions, but extremely neat and clean. Its furniture only consisted\r\nof a small table (covered with a cloth, and placed between two equally\r\nsmall casement-windows, in which stood two pots of geraniums), a stand\r\nof ikons, with a lamp suspended in front of them, a bench, and two\r\nchairs. In one corner hung a wall clock, with little flowers painted on\r\nits dial, and brass weights to its chains, while upon two nails driven\r\ninto a screen (which, fastened to the ceiling with whitewashed pegs,\r\nprobably concealed the bed) hung a couple of cassocks. The windows\r\nlooked out upon a whitewashed wall, about two arshins distant, and in\r\nthe space between them there grew a small lilac-bush.\r\n\r\nNot a sound penetrated from without, and in the stillness the measured,\r\nfriendly stroke of the clock\'s pendulum seemed to beat quite loudly.\r\nThe instant that I found myself alone in this calm retreat all other\r\nthoughts and recollections left my head as completely as though they had\r\nnever been there, and I subsided into an inexpressibly pleasing kind of\r\ntorpor. The rusty alpaca cassocks with their frayed linings, the\r\nworn black leather bindings of the books with their metal clasps, the\r\ndull-green plants with their carefully watered leaves and soil, and,\r\nabove all, the abrupt, regular beat of the pendulum, all spoke to me\r\nintimately of some new life hitherto unknown to me--a life of unity and\r\nprayer, of calm, restful happiness.\r\n\r\n"The months, the years, may pass," I thought to myself, "but he remains\r\nalone--always at peace, always knowing that his conscience is pure\r\nbefore God, that his prayer will be heard by Him." For fully half\r\nan hour I sat on that chair, trying not to move, not even to breathe\r\nloudly, for fear I should mar the harmony of the sounds which were\r\ntelling me so much, and ever the pendulum continued to beat the\r\nsame--now a little louder to the right, now a little softer to the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE SECOND CONFESSION\r\n\r\nSuddenly the sound of the priest\'s footsteps roused me from this\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n"Good morning to you," he said as he smoothed his grey hair with his\r\nhand. "What can I do for you?"\r\n\r\nI besought him to give me his blessing, and then kissed his small,\r\nwizened hand with great fervour. After I had explained to him my errand\r\nhe said nothing, but moved away towards the ikons, and began to read the\r\nexhortation: whereupon I overcame my shame, and told him all that was in\r\nmy heart. Finally he laid his hands upon my head, and pronounced in\r\nhis even, resonant voice the words: "My son, may the blessing of\r\nOur Heavenly Father be upon thee, and may He always preserve thee in\r\nfaithfulness, loving-kindness, and meekness. Amen."\r\n\r\nI was entirely happy. Tears of joy coursed down my face as I kissed the\r\nhem of his cassock and then raised my head again. The face of the\r\npriest expressed perfect tranquillity. So keenly did I feel the joy of\r\nreconciliation that, fearing in any way to dispel it, I took hasty leave\r\nof him, and, without looking to one side of me or the other (in order\r\nthat my attention might not be distracted), left the grounds and\r\nre-entered the rickety, battered drozhki. Yet the joltings of the\r\nvehicle and the variety of objects which flitted past my eyes soon\r\ndissipated that feeling, and I became filled with nothing but the idea\r\nthat the priest must have thought me the finest-spirited young man he\r\nhad ever met, or ever would meet, in the whole of his life. Indeed, I\r\nreflected, there could not be many such as myself--of that I felt sure,\r\nand the conviction produced in me the kind of complacency which craves\r\nfor self-communication to another. I had a great desire to unbosom\r\nmyself to some one, and as there was no one else to speak to, I\r\naddressed myself to the cabman.\r\n\r\n"Was I very long gone?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"No, not very long," he replied. He seemed to have grown more cheerful\r\nunder the influence of the sunshine. "Yet now it is a good while past my\r\nhorse\'s feeding-time. You see, I am a night cabman."\r\n\r\n"Well, I only seemed to myself to be about a minute," I went on. "Do you\r\nknow what I went there for?" I added, changing my seat to the well of\r\nthe drozhki, so as to be nearer the driver.\r\n\r\n"What business is it of mine? I drive a fare where he tells me to go,"\r\nhe replied.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but, all the same, what do you think I went there for?" I\r\npersisted.\r\n\r\n"I expect some one you know is going to be buried there, so you went to\r\nsee about a plot for the grave."\r\n\r\n"No, no, my friend. Still, DO you know what I went there for?"\r\n\r\n"No, of course I cannot tell, barin," he repeated.\r\n\r\nHis voice seemed to me so kind that I decided to edify him by relating\r\nthe cause of my expedition, and even telling him of the feeling which I\r\nhad experienced.\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell you?" I said. "Well, you see,"--and I told him all, as\r\nwell as inflicted upon him a description of my fine sentiments. To this\r\nday I blush at the recollection.\r\n\r\n"Well, well!" said the cabman non-committally, and for a long while\r\nafterwards he remained silent and motionless, except that at intervals\r\nhe adjusted the skirt of his coat each time that it was jerked from\r\nbeneath his leg by the joltings of his huge boot on the drozhki\'s step.\r\nI felt sure that he must be thinking of me even as the priest had done.\r\nThat is to say, that he must be thinking that no such fine-spirited\r\nyoung man existed in the world as I. Suddenly he shot at me:\r\n\r\n"I tell you what, barin. You ought to keep God\'s affairs to yourself."\r\n\r\n"What?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Those affairs of yours--they are God\'s business," he repeated, mumbling\r\nthe words with his toothless lips.\r\n\r\n"No, he has not understood me," I thought to myself, and said no more to\r\nhim till we reached home.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was not my original sense of reconciliation and reverence,\r\nbut only a sort of complacency at having experienced such a sense,\r\nthat lasted in me during the drive home (and that, too, despite the\r\ndistraction of the crowds of people who now thronged the sunlit streets\r\nin every direction), I had no sooner reached home than even my spurious\r\ncomplacency was shattered, for I found that I had not the forty copecks\r\nwherewith to pay the cabman! To the butler, Gabriel, I already owed\r\na small debt, and he refused to lend me any more. Seeing me twice run\r\nacross the courtyard in quest of the money, the cabman must have divined\r\nthe reason, for, leaping from his drozhki, he--notwithstanding that he\r\nhad seemed so kind--began to bawl aloud (with an evident desire to punch\r\nmy head) that people who do not pay for their cab-rides are swindlers.\r\n\r\nNone of my family were yet out of bed, so that, except for the servants,\r\nthere was no one from whom to borrow the forty copecks. At length, on my\r\nmost sacred, sacred word of honour to repay (a word to which, as I could\r\nsee from his face, he did not altogether trust), Basil so far yielded to\r\nhis fondness for me and his remembrance of the many services I had done\r\nhim as to pay the cabman. Thus all my beautiful feelings ended in smoke.\r\nWhen I went upstairs to dress for church and go to Communion with the\r\nrest I found that my new clothes had not yet come home, and so I could\r\nnot wear them. Then I sinned headlong. Donning my other suit, I went\r\nto Communion in a sad state of mental perturbation, and filled with\r\ncomplete distrust of all my finer impulses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. HOW I PREPARED MYSELF FOR THE EXAMINATIONS\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday in Easter week Papa, my sister, Katenka, and Mimi went\r\naway into the country, and no one remained in my grandmother\'s great\r\nhouse but Woloda, St. Jerome, and myself. The frame of mind which I\r\nhad experienced on the day of my confession and during my subsequent\r\nexpedition to the monastery had now completely passed away, and left\r\nbehind it only a dim, though pleasing, memory which daily became more\r\nand more submerged by the impressions of this emancipated existence.\r\n\r\nThe folio endorsed "Rules of My Life" lay concealed beneath a pile of\r\nschool-books. Although the idea of the possibility of framing rules, for\r\nevery occasion in my life and always letting myself be guided by\r\nthem still pleased me (since it appeared an idea at once simple and\r\nmagnificent, and I was determined to make practical application of it),\r\nI seemed somehow to have forgotten to put it into practice at once, and\r\nkept deferring doing so until such and such a moment. At the same time,\r\nI took pleasure in the thought that every idea which now entered my\r\nhead could be allotted precisely to one or other of my three sections of\r\ntasks and duties--those for or to God, those for or to my neighbour, and\r\nthose for or to myself. "I can always refer everything to them," I said\r\nto myself, "as well as the many, many other ideas which occur to me on\r\none subject or another." Yet at this period I often asked myself, "Was I\r\nbetter and more truthful when I only believed in the power of the\r\nhuman intellect, or am I more so now, when I am losing the faculty of\r\ndeveloping that power, and am in doubt both as to its potency and as to\r\nits importance?" To this I could return no positive answer.\r\n\r\nThe sense of freedom, combined with the spring-like feeling of vague\r\nexpectation to which I have referred already, so unsettled me that\r\nI could not keep myself in hand--could make none but the sorriest of\r\npreparations for my University ordeal. Thus I was busy in the schoolroom\r\none morning, and fully aware that I must work hard, seeing that\r\nto-morrow was the day of my examination in a subject of which I had\r\nthe two whole questions still to read up; yet no sooner had a breath of\r\nspring come wafted through the window than I felt as though there were\r\nsomething quite different that I wished to recall to my memory. My hands\r\nlaid down my book, my feet began to move of themselves, and to set me\r\nwalking up and down the room, and my head felt as though some one\r\nhad suddenly touched in it a little spring and set some machine in\r\nmotion--so easily and swiftly and naturally did all sorts of pleasing\r\nfancies of which I could catch no more than the radiancy begin coursing\r\nthrough it. Thus one hour, two hours, elapsed unperceived. Even if I\r\nsat down determinedly to my book, and managed to concentrate my whole\r\nattention upon what I was reading, suddenly there would sound in the\r\ncorridor the footsteps of a woman and the rustle of her dress. Instantly\r\neverything would escape my mind, and I would find it impossible to\r\nremain still any longer, however much I knew that the woman could only\r\nbe either Gasha or my grandmother\'s old sewing-maid moving about in the\r\ncorridor. "Yet suppose it should be SHE all at once?" I would say to\r\nmyself. "Suppose IT is beginning now, and I were to lose it?" and,\r\ndarting out into the corridor, I would find, each time, that it was only\r\nGasha. Yet for long enough afterwards I could not recall my attention to\r\nmy studies. A little spring had been touched in my head, and a strange\r\nmental ferment started afresh. Again, that evening I was sitting alone\r\nbeside a tallow candle in my room. Suddenly I looked up for a moment--to\r\nsnuff the candle, or to straighten myself in my chair--and at once\r\nbecame aware of nothing but the darkness in the corners and the blank of\r\nthe open doorway. Then, I also became conscious how still the house was,\r\nand felt as though I could do nothing else than go on listening to that\r\nstillness, and gazing into the black square of that open doorway, and\r\ngradually sinking into a brown study as I sat there without moving.\r\nAt intervals, however, I would get up, and go downstairs, and begin\r\nwandering through the empty rooms. Once I sat a long while in the small\r\ndrawing-room as I listened to Gasha playing "The Nightingale" (with two\r\nfingers) on the piano in the large drawing-room, where a solitary candle\r\nburned. Later, when the moon was bright, I felt obliged to get out of\r\nbed and to lean out of the window, so that I might gaze into the garden,\r\nand at the lighted roof of the Shaposnikoff mansion, the straight\r\ntower of our parish church, and the dark shadows of the fence and the\r\nlilac-bush where they lay black upon the path. So long did I remain\r\nthere that, when I at length returned to bed, it was ten o\'clock in the\r\nmorning before I could open my eyes again.\r\n\r\nIn short, had it not been for the tutors who came to give me lessons, as\r\nwell as for St. Jerome (who at intervals, and very grudgingly, applied\r\na spur to my self-conceit) and, most of all, for the desire to figure\r\nas "clever" in the eyes of my friend Nechludoff (who looked upon\r\ndistinctions in University examinations as a matter of first-rate\r\nimportance)--had it not been for all these things, I say, the spring and\r\nmy new freedom would have combined to make me forget everything I\r\nhad ever learnt, and so to go through the examinations to no purpose\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE EXAMINATION IN HISTORY\r\n\r\nON the 16th of April I entered, for the first time, and under the wing\r\nof St. Jerome, the great hall of the University. I had driven there with\r\nSt. Jerome in our smart phaeton and wearing the first frockcoat of my\r\nlife, while the whole of my other clothes--even down to my socks and\r\nlinen--were new and of a grander sort. When a Swiss waiter relieved me\r\nof my greatcoat, and I stood before him in all the beauty of my attire,\r\nI felt almost sorry to dazzle him so. Yet I had no sooner entered the\r\nbright, carpeted, crowded hall, and caught sight of hundreds of other\r\nyoung men in gymnasium [The Russian gymnasium = the English grammar or\r\nsecondary school.] uniforms or frockcoats (of whom but a few threw me an\r\nindifferent glance), as well as, at the far end, of some solemn-looking\r\nprofessors who were seated on chairs or walking carelessly about among\r\nsome tables, than I at once became disabused of the notion that I should\r\nattract the general attention, while the expression of my face, which at\r\nhome, and even in the vestibule of the University buildings, had denoted\r\nonly a kind of vague regret that I should have to present so important\r\nand distinguished an appearance, became exchanged for an expression\r\nof the most acute nervousness and dejection. However, I soon picked\r\nup again when I perceived sitting at one of the desks a very badly,\r\nuntidily dressed gentleman who, though not really old, was almost\r\nentirely grey. He was occupying a seat quite at the back of the hall and\r\na little apart from the rest, so I hastened to sit down beside him, and\r\nthen fell to looking at the candidates for examination, and to forming\r\nconclusions about them. Many different figures and faces were there to\r\nbe seen there; yet, in my opinion, they all seemed to divide themselves\r\ninto three classes. First of all, there were youths like myself,\r\nattending for examination in the company of their parents or tutors.\r\nAmong such I could see the youngest Iwin (accompanied by Frost) and\r\nIlinka Grap (accompanied by his old father). All youths of this class\r\nwore the early beginnings of beards, sported prominent linen, sat\r\nquietly in their places, and never opened the books and notebooks which\r\nthey had brought with them, but gazed at the professors and examination\r\ntables with ill-concealed nervousness. The second class of candidates\r\nwere young men in gymnasium uniforms. Several of them had attained to\r\nthe dignity of shaving, and most of them knew one another. They talked\r\nloudly, called the professors by their names and surnames, occupied\r\nthemselves in getting their subjects ready, exchanged notebooks, climbed\r\nover desks, fetched themselves pies and sandwiches from the vestibule,\r\nand ate them then and there merely lowering their heads to the level\r\nof a desk for propriety\'s sake. Lastly, the third class of candidates\r\n(which seemed a small one) consisted of oldish men--some of them in\r\nfrock coats, but the majority in jackets, and with no linen to be seen.\r\nThese preserved a serious demeanour, sat by themselves, and had a very\r\ndingy look. The man who had afforded me consolation by being worse\r\ndressed than myself belonged to this class. Leaning forward upon his\r\nelbows, and running his fingers through his grey, dishevelled hair as he\r\nread some book or another, he had thrown me only a momentary glance--and\r\nthat not a very friendly one--from a pair of glittering eyes. Then, as I\r\nsat down, he had frowned grimly, and stuck a shiny elbow out to prevent\r\nme from coming any nearer. On the other hand, the gymnasium men were\r\nover-sociable, and I felt rather afraid of their proximity. One of them\r\ndid not hesitate to thrust a book into my hands, saying, "Give that to\r\nthat fellow over there, will you?" while another of them exclaimed as he\r\npushed past me, "By your leave, young fellow!" and a third made use of\r\nmy shoulder as a prop when he wanted to scramble over a desk. All this\r\nseemed to me a little rough and unpleasant, for I looked upon myself as\r\nimmensely superior to such fellows, and considered that they ought not\r\nto treat me with such familiarity. At length, the names began to\r\nbe called out. The gymnasium men walked out boldly, answered their\r\nquestions (apparently) well, and came back looking cheerful. My own\r\nclass of candidates were much more diffident, as well as appeared to\r\nanswer worse. Of the oldish men, some answered well, and some very\r\npoorly. When the name "Semenoff" was called out my neighbour with the\r\ngrey hair and glittering eyes jostled me roughly, stepped over my legs,\r\nand went up to one of the examiners\' tables. It was plain from the\r\naspect of the professors that he answered well and with assurance, yet,\r\non returning to his place, he did not wait to see where he was placed\r\non the list, but quietly collected his notebooks and departed. Several\r\ntimes I shuddered at the sound of the voice calling out the names, but\r\nmy turn did not come in exact alphabetical order, though already names\r\nhad begun to be called beginning with "I."\r\n\r\n"Ikonin and Tenieff!" suddenly shouted some one from the professors\' end\r\nof the hall.\r\n\r\n"Go on, Ikonin! You are being called," said a tall, red-faced gymnasium\r\nstudent near me. "But who is this BARtenieff or MORtenieff or somebody?\r\nI don\'t know him."\r\n\r\n"It must be you," whispered St. Jerome loudly in my ear.\r\n\r\n"MY name is IRtenieff," I said to the red-faced student. "Do you think\r\nthat was the name they were calling out?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Why on earth don\'t you go up?" he replied. "Lord, what a dandy!"\r\nhe added under his breath, yet not so quietly but that I failed to hear\r\nthe words as they came wafted to me from below the desk. In front of\r\nme walked Ikonin--a tall young man of about twenty-five, who was one of\r\nthose whom I had classed as oldish men. He wore a tight brown frockcoat\r\nand a blue satin tie, and had wisps of flaxen hair carefully brushed\r\nover his collar in the peasant style. His appearance had already caught\r\nmy attention when we were sitting among the desks, and had given me an\r\nimpression that he was not bad-looking. Also I had noticed that he was\r\nvery talkative. Yet what struck me most about his physiognomy was a\r\ntuft, of queer red hairs which he had under his chin, as well as, still\r\nmore, a strange habit of continually unbuttoning his waistcoat and\r\nscratching his chest under his shirt.\r\n\r\nBehind the table to which we were summoned sat three Professors, none of\r\nwhom acknowledged our salutations. A youngish professor was shuffling a\r\nbundle of tickets like a pack of cards; another one, with a star on his\r\nfrockcoat, was gazing hard at a gymnasium student, who was repeating\r\nsomething at great speed about Charles the Great, and adding to each\r\nof his sentences the word nakonetz [= the English colloquialism "you\r\nknow."] while a third one--an old man in spectacles--proceeded to bend\r\nhis head down as we approached, and, peering at us through his glasses,\r\npointed silently to the tickets. I felt his glance go over both myself\r\nand Ikonin, and also felt sure that something about us had displeased\r\nhim (perhaps it was Ikonin\'s red hairs), for, after taking another look\r\nat the pair of us, he motioned impatiently to us to be quick in taking\r\nour tickets. I felt vexed and offended--firstly, because none of the\r\nprofessors had responded to our bows, and, secondly, because they\r\nevidently coupled me with Ikonin under the one denomination of\r\n"candidates," and so were condemning me in advance on account of\r\nIkonin\'s red hairs. I took my ticket boldly and made ready to answer,\r\nbut the professor\'s eye passed over my head and alighted upon Ikonin.\r\nAccordingly, I occupied myself in reading my ticket. The questions\r\nprinted on it were all familiar to me, so, as I silently awaited my\r\nturn, I gazed at what was passing near me, Ikonin seemed in no way\r\ndiffident--rather the reverse, for, in reaching for his ticket, he threw\r\nhis body half-way across the table. Then he gave his long hair a shake,\r\nand rapidly conned over what was written on his ticket. I think he\r\nhad just opened his mouth to answer when the professor with the star\r\ndismissed the gymnasium student with a word of commendation, and then\r\nturned and looked at Ikonin. At once the latter seemed taken back, and\r\nstopped short. For about two minutes there was a dead silence.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said the professor in the spectacles.\r\n\r\nOnce more Ikonin opened his mouth, and once more remained silent.\r\n\r\n"Come! You are not the only one to be examined. Do you mean to answer\r\nor do you not?" said the youngish professor, but Ikonin did not even\r\nlook at him. He was gazing fixedly at his ticket and uttered not a\r\nsingle word. The professor in the spectacles scanned him through his\r\nglasses, then over them, then without them (for, indeed, he had time\r\nto take them off, to wipe their lenses carefully, and to replace them).\r\nStill not a word from Ikonin. All at once, however, a smile spread\r\nitself over his face, and he gave his long hair another shake. Next he\r\nreached across the table, laid down his ticket, looked at each of the\r\nprofessors in turn and then at myself, and finally, wheeling round on\r\nhis heels, made a gesture with his hand and returned to the desks. The\r\nprofessors stared blankly at one another.\r\n\r\n"Bless the fellow!" said the youngish professor. "What an original!"\r\n\r\nIt was now my turn to move towards the table, but the professors went on\r\ntalking in undertones among themselves, as though they were unaware of\r\nmy presence. At the moment, I felt firmly persuaded that the three of\r\nthem were engrossed solely with the question of whether I should merely\r\nPASS the examination or whether I should pass it WELL, and that it was\r\nonly swagger which made them pretend that they did not care either way,\r\nand behave as though they had not seen me.\r\n\r\nWhen at length the professor in the spectacles turned to me with an air\r\nof indifference, and invited me to answer, I felt hurt, as I looked at\r\nhim, to think that he should have so undeceived me: wherefore I answered\r\nbrokenly at first. In time, however, things came easier to my tongue,\r\nand, inasmuch as all the questions bore upon Russian history (which I\r\nknew thoroughly), I ended with eclat, and even went so far, in my desire\r\nto convince the professors that I was not Ikonin and that they must not\r\nin anyway confound me with him, as to offer to draw a second ticket. The\r\nprofessor in the spectacles, however, merely nodded his head, said "That\r\nwill do," and marked something in his register. On returning to the\r\ndesks, I at once learnt from the gymnasium men (who somehow seemed to\r\nknow everything) that I had been placed fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. MY EXAMINATION IN MATHEMATICS\r\n\r\nAT the subsequent examinations, I made several new acquaintances in\r\naddition to the Graps (whom I considered unworthy of my notice) and\r\nIwin (who for some reason or other avoided me). With some of these new\r\nfriends I grew quite intimate, and even Ikonin plucked up sufficient\r\ncourage to inform me, when we next met, that he would have to undergo\r\nre-examination in history--the reason for his failure this time being\r\nthat the professor of that faculty had never forgiven him for last\r\nyear\'s examination, and had, indeed, "almost killed" him for it.\r\nSemenoff (who was destined for the same faculty as myself--the\r\nfaculty of mathematics) avoided every one up to the very close of the\r\nexaminations. Always leaning forward upon his elbows and running his\r\nfingers through his grey hair, he sat silent and alone. Nevertheless,\r\nwhen called up for examination in mathematics (he had no companion\r\nto accompany him), he came out second. The first place was taken by a\r\nstudent from the first gymnasium--a tall, dark, lanky, pale-faced fellow\r\nwho wore a black folded cravat and had his cheeks and forehead dotted\r\nall over with pimples. His hands were shapely and slender, but their\r\nnails were so bitten to the quick that the finger-ends looked as though\r\nthey had been tied round with strips of thread. All this seemed to me\r\nsplendid, and wholly becoming to a student of the first gymnasium.\r\nHe spoke to every one, and we all made friends with him. To me in\r\nparticular his walk, his every movement, his lips, his dark eyes, all\r\nseemed to have in them something extraordinary and magnetic.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the mathematical examination I arrived earlier than usual\r\nat the hall. I knew the syllabus well, yet there were two questions\r\nin the algebra which my tutor had managed to pass over, and which were\r\ntherefore quite unknown to me. If I remember rightly, they were the\r\nTheory of Combinations and Newton\'s Binomial. I seated myself on one of\r\nthe back benches and pored over the two questions, but, inasmuch as I\r\nwas not accustomed to working in a noisy room, and had even less time\r\nfor preparation than I had anticipated, I soon found it difficult to\r\ntake in all that I was reading.\r\n\r\n"Here he is. This way, Nechludoff," said Woloda\'s familiar voice behind\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI turned and saw my brother and Dimitri--their gowns unbuttoned, and\r\ntheir hands waving a greeting to me--threading their way through the\r\ndesks. A moment\'s glance would have sufficed to show any one that they\r\nwere second-course students--persons to whom the University was as a\r\nsecond home. The mere look of their open gowns expressed at once disdain\r\nfor the "mere candidate" and a knowledge that the "mere candidate\'s"\r\nsoul was filled with envy and admiration of them. I was charmed to think\r\nthat every one near me could now see that I knew two real second-course\r\nstudents: wherefore I hastened to meet them half-way.\r\n\r\nWoloda, of course, could not help vaunting his superiority a little.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, you smug!" he said. "Haven\'t you been examined yet?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Well, what are you reading? Aren\'t you sufficiently primed?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, except in two questions. I don\'t understand them at all."\r\n\r\n"Eh, what?"--and Woloda straightway began to expound to me Newton\'s\r\nBinomial, but so rapidly and unintelligibly that, suddenly reading in my\r\neyes certain misgivings as to the soundness of his knowledge, he glanced\r\nalso at Dimitri\'s face. Clearly, he saw the same misgivings there, for\r\nhe blushed hotly, though still continuing his involved explanations.\r\n\r\n"No; hold on, Woloda, and let me try and do it," put in Dimitri at\r\nlength, with a glance at the professors\' corner as he seated himself\r\nbeside me.\r\n\r\nI could see that my friend was in the best of humours. This was always\r\nthe case with him when he was satisfied with himself, and was one of the\r\nthings in him which I liked best. Inasmuch as he knew mathematics well\r\nand could speak clearly, he hammered the question so thoroughly into my\r\nhead that I can remember it to this day. Hardly had he finished when St.\r\nJerome said to me in a loud whisper, "A vous, Nicolas," and I followed\r\nIkonin out from among the desks without having had an opportunity of\r\ngoing through the OTHER question of which I was ignorant. At the table\r\nwhich we now approached were seated two professors, while before the\r\nblackboard stood a gymnasium student, who was working some formula\r\naloud, and knocking bits off the end of the chalk with his too vigorous\r\nstrokes. He even continued writing after one of the Professors had said\r\nto him "Enough!" and bidden us draw our tickets. "Suppose I get the\r\nTheory of Combinations?" I thought to myself as my tremulous fingers\r\ntook a ticket from among a bundle wrapped in torn paper. Ikonin, for\r\nhis part, reached across the table with the same assurance, and the\r\nsame sidelong movement of his whole body, as he had done at the previous\r\nexamination. Taking the topmost ticket without troubling to make further\r\nselection, he just glanced at it, and then frowned angrily.\r\n\r\n"I always draw this kind of thing," he muttered.\r\n\r\nI looked at mine. Horrors! It was the Theory of Combinations!\r\n\r\n"What have you got?" whispered Ikonin at this point.\r\n\r\nI showed him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know that," he said.\r\n\r\n"Will you make an exchange, then?"\r\n\r\n"No. Besides, it would be all the same for me if I did," he contrived to\r\nwhisper just as the professor called us up to the blackboard. "I don\'t\r\nfeel up to anything to-day."\r\n\r\n"Then everything is lost!" I thought to myself. Instead of the brilliant\r\nresult which I had anticipated I should be for ever covered with\r\nshame--more so even than Ikonin! Suddenly, under the very eyes of the\r\nprofessor, Ikonin turned to me, snatched my ticket out of my hands, and\r\nhanded me his own. I looked at his ticket. It was Newton\'s Binomial!\r\n\r\nThe professor was a youngish man, with a pleasant, clever expression of\r\nface--an effect chiefly due to the prominence of the lower part of his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n"What? Are you exchanging tickets, gentlemen?" he said.\r\n\r\n"No. He only gave me his to look at, professor," answered Ikonin--and,\r\nsure enough, the word "professor" was the last word that he uttered\r\nthere. Once again, he stepped backwards towards me from the table, once\r\nagain he looked at each of the professors in turn and then at myself,\r\nonce again he smiled faintly, and once again he shrugged his shoulders\r\nas much as to say, "It is no use, my good sirs." Then he returned to the\r\ndesks. Subsequently, I learnt that this was the third year he had vainly\r\nattempted to matriculate.\r\n\r\nI answered my question well, for I had just read it up; and the\r\nprofessor, kindly informing me that I had done even better than was\r\nrequired, placed me fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. MY EXAMINATION IN LATIN\r\n\r\nAll went well until my examination in Latin. So far, a gymnasium student\r\nstood first on the list, Semenoff second, and myself third. On the\r\nstrength of it I had begun to swagger a little, and to think that, for\r\nall my youth, I was not to be despised.\r\n\r\nFrom the first day of the examinations, I had heard every one speak with\r\nawe of the Professor of Latin, who appeared to be some sort of a wild\r\nbeast who battened on the financial ruin of young men (of those, that is\r\nto say, who paid their own fees) and spoke only in the Greek and\r\nLatin tongues. However, St. Jerome, who had coached me in Latin, spoke\r\nencouragingly, and I myself thought that, since I could translate Cicero\r\nand certain parts of Horace without the aid of a lexicon, I should do\r\nno worse than the rest. Yet things proved otherwise. All the morning the\r\nair had been full of rumours concerning the tribulations of candidates\r\nwho had gone up before me: rumours of how one young fellow had been\r\naccorded a nought, another one a single mark only, a third one greeted\r\nwith abuse and threatened with expulsion, and so forth. Only Semenoff\r\nand the first gymnasium student had, as usual, gone up quietly, and\r\nreturned to their seats with five marks credited to their names. Already\r\nI felt a prescience of disaster when Ikonin and myself found ourselves\r\nsummoned to the little table at which the terrible professor sat in\r\nsolitary grandeur.\r\n\r\nThe terrible professor turned out to be a little thin, bilious-looking\r\nman with hair long and greasy and a face expressive of extraordinary\r\nsullenness. Handing Ikonin a copy of Cicero\'s Orations, he bid him\r\ntranslate. To my great astonishment Ikonin not only read off some of\r\nthe Latin, but even managed to construe a few lines to the professor\'s\r\nprompting. At the same time, conscious of my superiority over such a\r\nfeeble companion, I could not help smiling a little, and even looking\r\nrather contemptuous, when it came to a question of analysis, and Ikonin,\r\nas on previous occasions, plunged into a silence which promised never\r\nto end. I had hoped to please the professor by that knowing, slightly\r\nsarcastic smile of mine, but, as a matter of fact, I contrived to do\r\nquite the contrary.\r\n\r\n"Evidently you know better than he, since you are laughing," he said to\r\nme in bad Russian. "Well, we shall see. Tell me the answer, then."\r\n\r\nLater I learnt that the professor was Ikonin\'s guardian, and that Ikonin\r\nactually lived with him. I lost no time in answering the question in\r\nsyntax which had been put to Ikonin, but the professor only pulled a\r\nlong face and turned away from me.\r\n\r\n"Well, your turn will come presently, and then we shall see how much you\r\nknow," he remarked, without looking at me, but proceeding to explain to\r\nIkonin the point on which he had questioned him.\r\n\r\n"That will do," he added, and I saw him put down four marks to Ikonin in\r\nhis register. "Come!" I thought to myself. "He cannot be so strict after\r\nall."\r\n\r\nWhen Ikonin had taken his departure the professor spent fully five\r\nminutes--five minutes which seemed to me five hours--in setting his\r\nbooks and tickets in order, in blowing his nose, in adjusting and\r\nsprawling about on his chair, in gazing down the hall, and in looking\r\nhere, there, and everywhere--in doing everything, in fact, except once\r\nletting his eye rest upon me. Yet even that amount of dissimulation did\r\nnot seem to satisfy him, for he next opened a book, and pretended to\r\nread it, for all the world as though I were not there at all. I moved a\r\nlittle nearer him, and gave a cough.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! You too, of course! Well, translate me something," he\r\nremarked, handing me a book of some kind. "But no; you had better take\r\nthis," and, turning over the leaves of a Horace, he indicated to me a\r\npassage which I should never have imagined possible of translation.\r\n\r\n"I have not prepared this," I said.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Then you only wish to answer things which you have got by heart, do\r\nyou? Indeed? No, no; translate me that."\r\n\r\nI started to grope for the meaning of the passage, but each questioning\r\nlook which I threw at the professor was met by a shake of the head, a\r\nprofound sigh, and an exclamation of "No, no!" Finally he banged the\r\nbook to with such a snap that he caught his finger between the covers.\r\nAngrily releasing it, he handed me a ticket containing questions in\r\ngrammar, and, flinging himself back in his chair, maintained a menacing\r\nsilence. I should have tried to answer the questions had not the\r\nexpression of his face so clogged my tongue that nothing seemed to come\r\nfrom it right.\r\n\r\n"No, no! That\'s not it at all!" he suddenly exclaimed in his horrible\r\naccent as he altered his posture to one of leaning forward upon the\r\ntable and playing with the gold signet-ring which was nearly slipping\r\nfrom the little finger of his left hand. "That is not the way to prepare\r\nfor serious study, my good sir. Fellows like yourself think that, once\r\nthey have a gown and a blue collar to their backs, they have reached the\r\nsummit of all things and become students. No, no, my dear sir. A subject\r\nneeds to be studied FUNDAMENTALLY," and so on, and so on.\r\n\r\nDuring this speech (which was uttered with a clipped sort of intonation)\r\nI went on staring dully at his lowered eyelids. Beginning with a fear\r\nlest I should lose my place as third on the list, I went on to fear lest\r\nI should pass at all. Next, these feelings became reinforced by a sense\r\nof injustice, injured self-respect, and unmerited humiliation, while the\r\ncontempt which I felt for the professor as some one not quite (according\r\nto my ideas) "comme il faut"--a fact which I deduced from the shortness,\r\nstrength, and roundness of his nails--flared up in me more and more and\r\nturned all my other feelings to sheer animosity. Happening, presently,\r\nto glance at me, and to note my quivering lips and tear-filled eyes, he\r\nseemed to interpret my agitation as a desire to be accorded my marks and\r\ndismissed: wherefore, with an air of relenting, he said (in the presence\r\nof another professor who had just approached):\r\n\r\n"Very well; I will accord you a \'pass\'" (which signified two marks),\r\n"although you do not deserve it. I do so simply out of consideration for\r\nyour youth, and in the hope that, when you begin your University career,\r\nyou will learn to be less light-minded."\r\n\r\nThe concluding phrase, uttered in the hearing of the other professor\r\n(who at once turned his eyes upon me, as though remarking, "There! You\r\nsee, young man!") completed my discomfiture. For a moment, a mist swam\r\nbefore my eyes--a mist in which the terrible professor seemed to be far\r\naway, as he sat at his table while for an instant a wild idea danced\r\nthrough my brain. "What if I DID do such a thing?" I thought to myself.\r\n"What would come of it?" However, I did not do the thing in question,\r\nbut, on the contrary, made a bow of peculiar reverence to each of the\r\nprofessors, and with a slight smile on my face--presumably the same\r\nsmile as that with which I had derided Ikonin--turned away from the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThis piece of unfairness affected me so powerfully at the time that, had\r\nI been a free agent, I should have attended for no more examinations.\r\nMy ambition was gone (since now I could not possibly be third), and I\r\ntherefore let the other examinations pass without any exertion, or even\r\nagitation, on my part. In the general list I still stood fourth, but\r\nthat failed to interest me, since I had reasoned things out to myself,\r\nand come to the conclusion that to try for first place was stupid--even\r\n"bad form:" that, in fact, it was better to pass neither very well nor\r\nvery badly, as Woloda had done. This attitude I decided to maintain\r\nthroughout the whole of my University career, notwithstanding that it\r\nwas the first point on which my opinion had differed from that of my\r\nfriend Dimitri.\r\n\r\nYet, to tell the truth, my thoughts were already turning towards a\r\nuniform, a "mortar-board," and the possession of a drozhki of my own,\r\na room of my own, and, above all, freedom of my own. And certainly the\r\nprospect had its charm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. I BECOME GROWN-UP\r\n\r\nWhen, on May 8th, I returned home from the final, the divinity,\r\nexamination, I found my acquaintance, the foreman from Rozonoff\'s,\r\nawaiting me. He had called once before to fit me for my gown, as well\r\nas for a tunic of glossy black cloth (the lapels of which were, on that\r\noccasion, only sketched in chalk), but to-day he had come to bring me\r\nthe clothes in their finished state, with their gilt buttons wrapped in\r\ntissue paper.\r\n\r\nDonning the garments, and finding them splendid (notwithstanding that\r\nSt. Jerome assured me that the back of the tunic wrinkled badly), I went\r\ndownstairs with a complacent smile which I was powerless to banish from\r\nmy face, and sought Woloda, trying the while to affect unconsciousness\r\nof the admiring looks of the servants, who came darting out of the hall\r\nand corridor to gaze upon me with ravished eyes. Gabriel, the butler,\r\novertook me in the salle, and, after congratulating me with much\r\nempressement, handed me, according to instructions from my father, four\r\nbank-notes, as well as informed me that Papa had also given orders that,\r\nfrom that day forth, the groom Kuzma, the phaeton, and the bay horse\r\nKrassavchik were to be entirely at my disposal. I was so overjoyed at\r\nthis not altogether expected good-fortune that I could no longer feign\r\nindifference in Gabriel\'s presence, but, flustered and panting, said\r\nthe first thing which came into my head ("Krassavchik is a splendid\r\ntrotter," I think it was). Then, catching sight of the various heads\r\nprotruding from the doors of the hall and corridor, I felt that I\r\ncould bear no more, and set off running at full speed across the salle,\r\ndressed as I was in the new tunic, with its shining gilt buttons. Just\r\nas I burst into Woloda\'s room, I heard behind me the voices of Dubkoff\r\nand Nechludoff, who had come to congratulate me, as well as to propose\r\na dinner somewhere and the drinking of much champagne in honour of my\r\nmatriculation. Dimitri informed me that, though he did not care for\r\nchampagne, he would nevertheless join us that evening and drink my\r\nhealth, while Dubkoff remarked that I looked almost like a colonel, and\r\nWoloda omitted to congratulate me at all, merely saying in an acid way\r\nthat he supposed we should now--i.e. in two days time--be off into the\r\ncountry. The truth was that Woloda, though pleased at my matriculation,\r\ndid not altogether like my becoming as grown-up as himself. St. Jerome,\r\nwho also joined us at this moment, said in a very pompous manner that\r\nhis duties were now ended, and that, although he did not know whether\r\nthey had been well done or ill, at least he had done his best, and must\r\ndepart to-morrow to his Count\'s. In replying to their various remarks\r\nI could feel, in spite of myself, a pleased, agreeable, faintly\r\nself-sufficient smile playing over my countenance, as well as could\r\nremark that that smile, communicated itself to those to whom I was\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nSo here was I without a tutor, yet with my own private drozhki, my\r\nname printed on the list of students, a sword and belt of my own, and a\r\nchance of an occasional salute from officials! In short, I was grownup\r\nand, I suppose, happy.\r\n\r\nFinally, we arranged to go out and dine at five o\'clock, but since\r\nWoloda presently went off to Dubkoff\'s, and Dimitri disappeared in\r\nhis usual fashion (saying that there was something he MUST do before\r\ndinner), I was left with two whole hours still at my disposal. For a\r\ntime I walked through the rooms of the house, and looked at myself\r\nin all the mirrors--firstly with the tunic buttoned, then with it\r\nunbuttoned, and lastly with only the top button fastened. Each time it\r\nlooked splendid. Eventually, though anxious not to show any excess of\r\ndelight, I found myself unable to refrain from crossing over to the\r\ncoach-house and stables to gaze at Krassovchik, Kuzma, and the drozhki.\r\nThen I returned and once more began my tour of the rooms, where I looked\r\nat myself in all the mirrors as before, and counted my money over in my\r\npocket--my face smiling happily the while. Yet not an hour had elapsed\r\nbefore I began to feel slightly ennuye--to feel a shade of regret that\r\nno one was present to see me in my splendid position. I began to long\r\nfor life and movement, and so sent out orders for the drozhki to be got\r\nready, since I had made up my mind to drive to the Kuznetski Bridge and\r\nmake some purchases.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I recalled how, after matriculating, Woloda had gone\r\nand bought himself a lithograph of horses by Victor Adam and some pipes\r\nand tobacco: wherefore I felt that I too must do the same. Amid glances\r\nshowered upon me from every side, and with the sunlight reflected from\r\nmy buttons, cap-badge, and sword, I drove to the Kuznetski Bridge,\r\nwhere, halting at a Picture shop, I entered it with my eyes looking to\r\nevery side. It was not precisely horses by Adam which I meant to buy,\r\nsince I did not wish to be accused of too closely imitating Woloda;\r\nwherefore, out of shame for causing the obsequious shopmen such\r\nagitation as I appeared to do, I made a hasty selection, and pitched\r\nupon a water-colour of a woman\'s head which I saw displayed in the\r\nwindow--price twenty roubles. Yet no sooner had I paid the twenty\r\nroubles over the counter than my heart smote me for having put two\r\nsuch beautifully dressed shop-assistants to so much trouble for such\r\na trifle. Moreover, I fancied that they were regarding me with some\r\ndisdain. Accordingly, in my desire to show them what manner of man I\r\nwas, I turned my attention to a silver trifle which I saw displayed in\r\na show-case, and, recognising that it was a porte-crayon (price eighteen\r\nroubles), requested that it should forthwith be wrapped in paper for me.\r\nNext, the money paid, and the information acquired that splendid pipes\r\nand tobacco were to be obtained in an adjacent emporium, I bowed to the\r\ntwo shopmen politely, and issued into the street with the picture under\r\nmy arm. At the shop next door (which had painted on its sign-board a\r\nnegro smoking a cigar) I bought (likewise out of a desire to imitate no\r\none) some Turkish tobacco, a Stamboul hookah, and two pipes. On coming\r\nout of the shop, I had just entered the drozhki when I caught sight of\r\nSemenoff, who was walking hurriedly along the pavement with his head\r\nbent down. Vexed that he should not have recognised me, I called out\r\nto him pretty loudly, "Hold on a minute!" and, whipping up the drozhki,\r\nsoon overtook him.\r\n\r\n"How do you do?" I said.\r\n\r\n"My respects to you," he replied, but without stopping.\r\n\r\n"Why are you not in your University uniform?" I next inquired.\r\n\r\nAt this he stopped short with a frown, and parted his white teeth as\r\nthough the sun were hurting his eyes. The next moment, however, he\r\nthrew a glance of studied indifference at my drozhki and uniform, and\r\ncontinued on his way.\r\n\r\nFrom the Kuznetski Bridge, I drove to a confectioner\'s in Tverskaia\r\nStreet, and, much as I should have liked it to be supposed that it was\r\nthe newspapers which most interested me, I had no choice but to begin\r\nfalling upon tartlet after tartlet. In fact, for all my bashfulness\r\nbefore a gentleman who kept regarding me with some curiosity from behind\r\na newspaper, I ate with great swiftness a tartlet of each of the eight\r\ndifferent sorts which the confectioner kept.\r\n\r\nOn reaching home, I experienced a slight touch of stomach-ache, but paid\r\nno attention to it, and set to work to inspect my purchases. Of these,\r\nthe picture so much displeased me that, instead of having it framed and\r\nhung in my room, as Woloda had done with his, I took pains to hide it\r\nbehind a chest of drawers, where no one could see it. Likewise, though I\r\nalso found the porte-crayon distasteful, I was able, as I laid it on my\r\ntable, to comfort myself with the thought that it was at least a SILVER\r\narticle--so much capital, as it were--and likely to be very useful to\r\na student. As for the smoking things, I decided to put them into use at\r\nonce, and try their capabilities.\r\n\r\nUnsealing the four packages, and carefully filling the Stamboul pipe\r\nwith some fine-cut, reddish-yellow Turkish tobacco, I applied a hot\r\ncinder to it, and, taking the mouthpiece between my first and second\r\nfingers (a position of the hand which greatly caught my fancy), started\r\nto inhale the smoke.\r\n\r\nThe smell of the tobacco seemed delightful, yet something burnt my mouth\r\nand caught me by the breath. Nevertheless, I hardened my heart, and\r\ncontinued to draw abundant fumes into my interior. Then I tried blowing\r\nrings and retaining the smoke. Soon the room became filled with blue\r\nvapours, while the pipe started to crackle and the tobacco to fly out\r\nin sparks. Presently, also, I began to feel a smarting in my mouth and\r\na giddiness in my head. Accordingly, I was on the point of stopping and\r\ngoing to look at myself and my pipe in the mirror, when, to my surprise,\r\nI found myself staggering about. The room was whirling round and\r\nround, and as I peered into the mirror (which I reached only with some\r\ndifficulty) I perceived that my face was as white as a sheet. Hardly had\r\nI thrown myself down upon a sofa when such nausea and faintness swept\r\nover me that, making up my mind that the pipe had proved my death, I\r\nexpected every moment to expire. Terribly frightened, I tried to call\r\nout for some one to come and help me, and to send for the doctor.\r\n\r\nHowever, this panic of mine did not last long, for I soon understood\r\nwhat the matter with me was, and remained lying on the sofa with a\r\nracking headache and my limbs relaxed as I stared dully at the stamp on\r\nthe package of tobacco, the Pipe-tube coiled on the floor, and the odds\r\nand ends of tobacco and confectioner\'s tartlets which were littered\r\nabout. "Truly," I thought to myself in my dejection and disillusionment,\r\n"I cannot be quite grown-up if I cannot smoke as other fellows do, and\r\nshould be fated never to hold a chibouk between my first and second\r\nfingers, or to inhale and puff smoke through a flaxen moustache!"\r\n\r\nWhen Dimitri called for me at five o\'clock, he found me in this\r\nunpleasant predicament. After drinking a glass of water, however, I felt\r\nnearly recovered, and ready to go with him.\r\n\r\n"So much for your trying to smoke!" said he as he gazed at the remnants\r\nof my debauch. "It is a silly thing to do, and waste of money as well. I\r\nlong ago promised myself never to smoke. But come along; we have to call\r\nfor Dubkoff."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. HOW WOLODA AND DUBKOFF AMUSED THEMSELVES\r\n\r\nTHE moment that Dimitri entered my room I perceived from his face,\r\nmanner of walking, and the signs which, in him, denoted ill-humour--a\r\nblinking of the eyes and a grim holding of his head to one side, as\r\nthough to straighten his collar--that he was in the coldly-correct frame\r\nof mind which was his when he felt dissatisfied with himself. It was\r\na frame of mind, too, which always produced a chilling effect upon my\r\nfeelings towards him. Of late I had begun to observe and appraise my\r\nfriend\'s character a little more, but our friendship had in no way\r\nsuffered from that, since it was still too young and strong for me to\r\nbe able to look upon Dimitri as anything but perfect, no matter in what\r\nlight I regarded him. In him there were two personalities, both of\r\nwhich I thought beautiful. One, which I loved devotedly, was kind, mild,\r\nforgiving, gay, and conscious of being those various things. When he was\r\nin this frame of mind his whole exterior, the very tone of his voice,\r\nhis every movement, appeared to say: "I am kind and good-natured, and\r\nrejoice in being so, and every one can see that I so rejoice." The other\r\nof his two personalities--one which I had only just begun to apprehend,\r\nand before the majesty of which I bowed in spirit--was that of a man who\r\nwas cold, stern to himself and to others, proud, religious to the point\r\nof fanaticism, and pedantically moral. At the present moment he was, as\r\nI say, this second personality.\r\n\r\nWith that frankness which constituted a necessary condition of our\r\nrelations I told him, as soon as we entered the drozhki, how much it\r\ndepressed and hurt me to see him, on this my fete-day in a frame of mind\r\nso irksome and disagreeable to me.\r\n\r\n"What has upset you so?" I asked him. "Will you not tell me?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Nicolas," was his slow reply as he gave his head a nervous\r\ntwitch to one side and blinked his eyes, "since I have given you my word\r\nnever to conceal anything from you, you have no reason to suspect me of\r\nsecretiveness. One cannot always be in exactly the same mood, and if I\r\nseem at all put out, that is all there is to say about it."\r\n\r\n"What a marvellously open, honourable character his is!" I thought to\r\nmyself, and dropped the subject.\r\n\r\nWe drove the rest of the way to Dubkoff\'s in silence. Dubkoff\'s flat was\r\nan unusually fine one--or, at all events, so it seemed to me. Everywhere\r\nwere rugs, pictures, gardenias, striped hangings, photographs, and\r\ncurved settees, while on the walls hung guns, pistols, pouches, and the\r\nmounted heads of wild beasts. It was the appearance of this apartment\r\nwhich made me aware whom, it was that Woloda had imitated in the scheme\r\nof his own sitting-room. We found Dubkoff and Woloda engaged in cards,\r\nwhile seated also at the table, and watching the game with close\r\nattention, was a gentleman whom I did not know, but who appeared to be\r\nof no great importance, judging by the modesty of his attitude.\r\nDubkoff himself was in a silk dressing-gown and soft slippers, while\r\nWoloda--seated opposite him on a divan--was in his shirtsleeves, as well\r\nas (to judge by his flushed face and the impatient, cursory glance which\r\nhe gave us for a second as he looked up from the cards) much taken up\r\nwith the game. On seeing me, he reddened still more.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is for you to deal," he remarked to Dubkoff. In an instant I\r\ndivined that he did not altogether relish my becoming acquainted with\r\nthe fact that he gambled. Yet his expression had nothing in it of\r\nconfusion--only a look which seemed to me to say: "Yes, I play cards,\r\nand if you are surprised at that, it is only because you are so young.\r\nThere is nothing wrong about it--it is a necessity at our age." Yes, I\r\nat once divined and understood that.\r\n\r\nInstead of dealing, however, Dubkoff rose and shook hands with us; after\r\nwhich he bade us both be seated, and then offered us pipes, which we\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\n"Here is our DIPLOMAT, then--the hero of the day!" he said to me, "Good\r\nLord! how you look like a colonel!"\r\n\r\n"H-m!" I muttered in reply, though once more feeling a complacent smile\r\noverspread my countenance.\r\n\r\nI stood in that awe of Dubkoff which a sixteen-year-old boy naturally\r\nfeels for a twenty-seven-year-old man of whom his elders say that he is\r\na very clever young man who can dance well and speak French, and who,\r\nthough secretly despising one\'s youth, endeavours to conceal the fact.\r\nYet, despite my respect for him, I somehow found it difficult and\r\nuncomfortable, throughout my acquaintanceship with him, to look him in\r\nthe eyes, I have since remarked that there are three kinds of men whom I\r\ncannot face easily, namely those who are much better than myself, those\r\nwho are much worse, and those between whom and myself there is a mutual\r\ndetermination not to mention some particular thing of which we are both\r\naware. Dubkoff may have been a much better fellow than myself, or he may\r\nhave been a much worse; but the point was that he lied very frequently\r\nwithout recognising the fact that I was aware of his doing so, yet had\r\ndetermined not to mention it.\r\n\r\n"Let us play another round," said Woloda, hunching one shoulder after\r\nthe manner of Papa, and reshuffling the cards.\r\n\r\n"How persistent you are!" said Dubkoff. "We can play all we want to\r\nafterwards. Well, one more round, then."\r\n\r\nDuring the play, I looked at their hands. Woloda\'s hands were large and\r\nred, whilst in the crook of the thumb and the way in which the other\r\nfingers curved themselves round the cards as he held them they so\r\nexactly resembled Papa\'s that now and then I could not help thinking\r\nthat Woloda purposely held the cards thus so as to look the more like a\r\ngrownup. Yet the next moment, looking at his face, I could see that he\r\nhad not a thought in his mind beyond the game. Dubkoff\'s hands, on the\r\ncontrary, were small, puffy, and inclined to clench themselves, as well\r\nas extremely neat and small-fingered. They were just the kind of hands\r\nwhich generally display rings, and which are most to be seen on persons\r\nwho are both inclined to use them and fond of objets de vertu.\r\n\r\nWoloda must have lost, for the gentleman who was watching the play\r\nremarked that Vladimir Petrovitch had terribly bad luck, while Dubkoff\r\nreached for a note book, wrote something in it, and then, showing Woloda\r\nwhat he had written, said:\r\n\r\n"Is that right?"\r\n\r\n"Yes." said Woloda, glancing with feigned carelessness at the note book.\r\n"Now let us go."\r\n\r\nWoloda took Dubkoff, and I gave Dimitri a lift in my drozhki.\r\n\r\n"What were they playing at?" I inquired of Dimitri.\r\n\r\n"At piquet. It is a stupid game. In fact, all such games are stupid."\r\n\r\n"And were they playing for much?"\r\n\r\n"No, not very much, but more than they ought to."\r\n\r\n"Do you ever play yourself?"\r\n\r\n"No; I swore never to do so; but Dubkoff will play with any one he can\r\nget hold of."\r\n\r\n"He ought not to do that," I remarked. "So Woloda does not play so well\r\nas he does?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Dubkoff ought not to, as you say, yet there is nothing\r\nespecially bad about it all. He likes playing, and plays well, but he is\r\na good fellow all the same."\r\n\r\n"I had no idea of this," I said.\r\n\r\n"We must not think ill of him," concluded Dimitri, "since he is a simply\r\nsplendid fellow. I like him very much, and always shall like him, in\r\nspite of his weakness."\r\n\r\nFor some reason or another the idea occurred to me that, just BECAUSE\r\nDimitri stuck up so stoutly for Dubkoff, he neither liked nor respected\r\nhim in reality, but was determined, out of stubbornness and a desire not\r\nto be accused of inconstancy, never to own to the fact. He was one of\r\nthose people who love their friends their life long, not so much\r\nbecause those friends remain always dear to them, as because, having\r\nonce--possibly mistakenly--liked a person, they look upon it as\r\ndishonourable to cease ever to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. I AM FETED AT DINNER\r\n\r\nDubkoff and Woloda knew every one at the restaurant by name, and every\r\none, from the waiters to the proprietor, paid them great respect. No\r\ntime was lost in allotting us a private room, where a bottle of iced\r\nchampagne-upon which I tried to look with as much indifference as I\r\ncould--stood ready waiting for us, and where we were served with a most\r\nwonderful repast selected by Dubkoff from the French menu. The meal went\r\noff most gaily and agreeably, notwithstanding that Dubkoff, as usual,\r\ntold us blood-curdling tales of doubtful veracity (among others, a tale\r\nof how his grandmother once shot dead three robbers who were attacking\r\nher--a recital at which I blushed, closed my eyes, and turned away from\r\nthe narrator), and that Woloda reddened visibly whenever I opened my\r\nmouth to speak--which was the more uncalled for on his part, seeing that\r\nnever once, so far as I can remember, did I say anything shameful. After\r\nwe had been given champagne, every one congratulated me, and I drank\r\n"hands across" with Dimitri and Dubkoff, and wished them joy. Since,\r\nhowever, I did not know to whom the bottle of champagne belonged (it was\r\nexplained to me later that it was common property), I considered that,\r\nin return, I ought to treat my friends out of the money which I had\r\nnever ceased to finger in my pocket. Accordingly, I stealthily extracted\r\na ten-rouble note, and, beckoning the waiter to my side, handed him the\r\nmoney, and told him in a whisper (yet not so softly but that every one\r\ncould hear me, seeing that every one was staring at me in dead silence)\r\nto "bring, if you please, a half-bottle of champagne." At this Woloda\r\nreddened again, and began to fidget so violently, and to gaze upon\r\nmyself and every one else with such a distracted air, that I felt sure\r\nI had somehow put my foot in it. However, the half-bottle came, and we\r\ndrank it with great gusto. After that, things went on merrily. Dubkoff\r\ncontinued his unending fairy tales, while Woloda also told funny\r\nstories--and told them well, too--in a way I should never have credited\r\nhim: so that our laughter rang long and loud. Their best efforts lay in\r\nimitation, and in variants of a certain well-known saw. "Have you ever\r\nbeen abroad?" one would say to the other, for instance. "No," the\r\none interrogated would reply, "but my brother plays the fiddle." Such\r\nperfection had the pair attained in this species of comic absurdity\r\nthat they could answer any question by its means, while they would also\r\nendeavour to unite two absolutely unconnected matters without a previous\r\nquestion having been asked at all, yet say everything with a perfectly\r\nserious face and produce a most comic effect. I too began to try to be\r\nfunny, but as soon as ever I spoke they either looked at me askance or\r\ndid not look at me until I had finished: so that my anecdotes fell flat.\r\nYet, though Dubkoff always remarked, "Our DIPLOMAT is lying, brother," I\r\nfelt so exhilarated with the champagne and the company of my elders that\r\nthe remark scarcely touched me. Only Dimitri, though he drank level with\r\nthe rest of us, continued in the same severe, serious frame of mind--a\r\nfact which put a certain check upon the general hilarity.\r\n\r\n"Now, look here, gentlemen," said Dubkoff at last. "After dinner we\r\nought to take the DIPLOMAT in hand. How would it be for him to go with\r\nus to see Auntie? There we could put him through his paces."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but Nechludoff will not go there," objected Woloda.\r\n\r\n"O unbearable, insupportable man of quiet habits that you are!" cried\r\nDubkoff, turning to Dimitri. "Yet come with us, and you shall see what\r\nan excellent lady my dear Auntie is."\r\n\r\n"I will neither go myself nor let him go," replied Dimitri.\r\n\r\n"Let whom go? The DIPLOMAT? Why, you yourself saw how he brightened up\r\nat the very mention of Auntie."\r\n\r\n"It is not so much that I WILL NOT LET HIM go," continued Dimitri,\r\nrising and beginning to pace the room without looking at me, "as that I\r\nneither wish him nor advise him to go. He is not a child now, and if he\r\nmust go he can go alone--without you. Surely you are ashamed of this,\r\nDubkoff?--ashamed of always wanting others to do all the wrong things\r\nthat you yourself do?"\r\n\r\n"But what is there so very wrong in my inviting you all to come and take\r\na cup of tea with my Aunt?" said Dubkoff, with a wink at Woloda. "If you\r\ndon\'t like us going, it is your affair; yet we are going all the same.\r\nAre you coming, Woloda?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," assented Woloda. "We can go there, and then return to my\r\nrooms and continue our piquet."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to go with them or not?" said Dimitri, approaching me.\r\n\r\n"No," I replied, at the same time making room for him to sit down beside\r\nme on the divan. "I did not wish to go in any case, and since you advise\r\nme not to, nothing on earth will make me go now. Yet," I added a moment\r\nlater, "I cannot honestly say that I have NO desire to go. All I say is\r\nthat I am glad I am not going."\r\n\r\n"That is right," he said. "Live your own life, and do not dance to any\r\none\'s piping. That is the better way."\r\n\r\nThis little tiff not only failed to mar our hilarity, but even increased\r\nit. Dimitri suddenly reverted to the kindly mood which I loved best--so\r\ngreat (as I afterwards remarked on more than one occasion) was the\r\ninfluence which the consciousness of having done a good deed exercised\r\nupon him. At the present moment the source of his satisfaction was\r\nthe fact that he had stopped my expedition to "Auntie\'s." He grew\r\nextraordinarily gay, called for another bottle of champagne (which was\r\nagainst his rules), invited some one who was a perfect stranger into our\r\nroom, plied him with wine, sang "Gaudeamus igitur," requested every one\r\nto join him in the chorus, and proposed that we should and rink at the\r\nSokolniki. [Mews.]\r\n\r\n"Let us enjoy ourselves to-night," he said with a laugh. "It is in\r\nhonour of his matriculation that you now see me getting drunk for the\r\nfirst time in my life."\r\n\r\nYet somehow this merriment sat ill upon him. He was like some\r\ngood-natured father or tutor who is pleased with his young charges, and\r\nlets himself go for their amusement, yet at the same time tries to show\r\nthem that one can enjoy oneself decently and in an honourable manner.\r\nHowever, his unexpected gaiety had an infectious influence upon myself\r\nand my companions, and the more so because each of us had now drunk\r\nabout half a bottle of champagne.\r\n\r\nIt was in this pleasing frame of mind that I went out into the main\r\nsalon to smoke a cigarette which Dubkoff had given me. In rising I\r\nnoticed that my head seemed to swim a little, and that my legs and\r\narms retained their natural positions only when I bent my thoughts\r\ndeterminedly upon them. At other moments my legs would deviate from the\r\nstraight line, and my arms describe strange gestures. I concentrated my\r\nwhole attention upon the members in question, forced my hands first to\r\nraise themselves and button my tunic, and then to smooth my hair (though\r\nthey ruffled my locks in doing so), and lastly commanded my legs to\r\nmarch me to the door--a function which they duly performed, though at\r\none time with too much reluctance, and at another with too much ABANDON\r\n(the left leg, in particular, coming to a halt every moment on tiptoe).\r\nSome one called out to me, "Where are you going to? They will bring you\r\na cigar-light directly," but I guessed the voice to be Woloda\'s, and,\r\nfeeling satisfied, somehow, that I had succeeded in divining the fact,\r\nmerely smiled airily in reply, and continued on my way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. THE QUARREL\r\n\r\nIn the main salon I perceived sitting at a small table a short, squat\r\ngentleman of the professional type. He had a red moustache, and was\r\nengaged in eating something or another, while by his side sat a tall,\r\nclean-shaven individual with whom he was carrying on a conversation in\r\nFrench. Somehow the aspect of these two persons displeased me; yet I\r\ndecided, for all that, to light my cigarette at the candelabrum which\r\nwas standing before them. Looking from side to side, to avoid meeting\r\ntheir gaze, I approached the table, and applied my cigarette to the\r\nflame. When it was fairly alight, I involuntarily threw a glance at the\r\ngentleman who was eating, and found his grey eyes fixed upon me with an\r\nexpression of intense displeasure. Just as I was turning away his red\r\nmoustache moved a little, and he said in French:\r\n\r\n"I do not like people to smoke when I am dining, my good sir."\r\n\r\nI murmured something inaudible.\r\n\r\n"No, I do not like it at all," he went on sternly, and with a glance at\r\nhis clean-shaven companion, as though inviting him to admire the way in\r\nwhich he was about to deal with me. "I do not like it, my good sir, nor\r\ndo I like people who have the impudence to puff their smoke up one\'s\r\nvery nose."\r\n\r\nBy this time I had gathered that it was myself he was scolding, and at\r\nfirst felt as though I had been altogether in the wrong.\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to inconvenience you," I said.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you did not suppose you were being impertinent, at least I\r\ndid! You are a cad, young sir!" he shouted in reply.\r\n\r\n"But what right have you to shout at me like that?" I exclaimed, feeling\r\nthat it was now HE that was insulting ME, and growing angry accordingly.\r\n\r\n"This much right," he replied, "that I never allow myself to be\r\noverlooked by any one, and that I always teach young fellows like\r\nyourself their manners. What is your name, young sir, and where do you\r\nlive?"\r\n\r\nAt this I felt so hurt that my teeth chattered, and I felt as though I\r\nwere choking. Yet all the while I was conscious of being in the wrong,\r\nand so, instead of offering any further rudeness to the offended one,\r\nhumbly told him my name and address.\r\n\r\n"And MY name, young sir," he returned, "is Kolpikoff, and I will trouble\r\nyou to be more polite to me in future.--However, You will hear from me\r\nagain" ("vous aurez de mes nouvelles"--the conversation had been carried\r\non wholly in French), was his concluding remark.\r\n\r\nTo this I replied, "I shall be delighted," with an infusion of as much\r\nhauteur as I could muster into my tone. Then, turning on my heel, I\r\nreturned with my cigarette--which had meanwhile gone out--to our own\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nI said nothing, either to my brother or my friends, about what had\r\nhappened (and the more so because they were at that moment engaged in\r\na dispute of their own), but sat down in a corner to think over the\r\nstrange affair. The words, "You are a cad, young sir," vexed me more and\r\nmore the longer that they sounded in my ears. My tipsiness was gone now,\r\nand, in considering my conduct during the dispute, the uncomfortable\r\nthought came over me that I had behaved like a coward.\r\n\r\n"Yet what right had he to attack me?" I reflected. "Why did he not\r\nsimply intimate to me that I was annoying him? After all, it may have\r\nbeen he that was in the wrong. Why, too, when he called me a young cad,\r\ndid I not say to him, \'A cad, my good sir, is one who takes offence\'? Or\r\nwhy did I not simply tell him to hold his tongue? That would have been\r\nthe better course. Or why did I not challenge him to a duel? No, I did\r\nnone of those things, but swallowed his insults like a wretched coward."\r\n\r\nStill the words, "You are a cad, young sir," kept sounding in my ears\r\nwith maddening iteration. "I cannot leave things as they are," I\r\nat length decided as I rose to my feet with the fixed intention\r\nof returning to the gentleman and saying something outrageous to\r\nhim--perhaps, also, of breaking the candelabrum over his head if\r\noccasion offered. Yet, though I considered the advisability of this\r\nlast measure with some pleasure, it was not without a good deal of\r\ntrepidation that I re-entered the main salon. As luck would have it, M.\r\nKolpikoff was no longer there, but only a waiter engaged in clearing the\r\ntable. For a moment I felt like telling the waiter the whole story, and\r\nexplaining to him my innocence in the matter, but for some reason or\r\nanother I thought better of it, and once more returned, in the same hazy\r\ncondition of mind, to our own room.\r\n\r\n"What has become of our DIPLOMAT?" Dubkoff was just saying. "Upon him\r\nnow hang the fortunes of Europe."\r\n\r\n"Oh, leave me alone," I said, turning moodily away. Then, as I paced the\r\nroom, something made me begin to think that Dubkoff was not altogether a\r\ngood fellow. "There is nothing very much to admire in his eternal jokes\r\nand his nickname of \'DIPLOMAT,\'" I reflected. "All he thinks about is to\r\nwin money from Woloda and to go and see his \'Auntie.\' There is nothing\r\nvery nice in all that. Besides, everything he says has a touch of\r\nblackguardism in it, and he is forever trying to make people laugh. In\r\nmy opinion he is simply stupid when he is not absolutely a brute."\r\nI spent about five minutes in these reflections, and felt my enmity\r\ntowards Dubkoff continually increasing. For his part, he took no notice\r\nof me, and that angered me the more. I actually felt vexed with Woloda\r\nand Dimitri because they went on talking to him.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what, gentlemen: the DIPLOMAT ought to be christened," said\r\nDubkoff suddenly, with a glance and a smile which seemed to me derisive,\r\nand even treacherous. "Yet, O Lord, what a poor specimen he is!"\r\n\r\n"You yourself ought to be christened, and you yourself are a sorry\r\nspecimen!" I retorted with an evil smile, and actually forgetting to\r\naddress him as "thou." [In Russian as in French, the second person\r\nsingular is the form of speech used between intimate friends.]\r\n\r\nThis reply evidently surprised Dubkoff, but he turned away\r\ngood-humouredly, and went on talking to Woloda and Dimitri. I tried to\r\nedge myself into the conversation, but, since I felt that I could not\r\nkeep it up, I soon returned to my corner, and remained there until we\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill had been paid and wraps were being put on, Dubkoff turned\r\nto Dimitri and said: "Whither are Orestes and Pedalion going now? Home,\r\nI suppose, to talk about love. Well, let US go and see my dear Auntie.\r\nThat will be far more entertaining than your sour company."\r\n\r\n"How dare you speak like that, and laugh at us?" I burst out as I\r\napproached him with clenched fists. "How dare you laugh at feelings\r\nwhich you do not understand? I will not have you do it! Hold your\r\ntongue!" At this point I had to hold my own, for I did not know what\r\nto say next, and was, moreover, out of breath with excitement. At first\r\nDubkoff was taken aback, but presently he tried to laugh it off, and to\r\ntake it as a joke. Finally I was surprised to see him look crestfallen,\r\nand lower his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I NEVER laugh at you or your feelings. It is merely my way of\r\nspeaking," he said evasively.\r\n\r\n"Indeed?" I cried; yet the next moment I felt ashamed of myself and\r\nsorry for him, since his flushed, downcast face had in it no other\r\nexpression than one of genuine pain.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with you?" said Woloda and Dimitri simultaneously.\r\n"No one was trying to insult you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he DID try to insult me!" I replied.\r\n\r\n"What an extraordinary fellow your brother is!" said Dubkoff to Woloda.\r\nAt that moment he was passing out of the door, and could not have heard\r\nwhat I said. Possibly I should have flung myself after him and offered\r\nhim further insult, had it not been that just at that moment the waiter\r\nwho had witnessed my encounter with Kolpikoff handed me my greatcoat,\r\nand I at once quietened down--merely making such a pretence of having\r\nhad a difference with Dimitri as was necessary to make my sudden\r\nappeasement appear nothing extraordinary. Next day, when I met Dubkoff\r\nat Woloda\'s, the quarrel was not raked up, yet he and I still addressed\r\neach other as "you," and found it harder than ever to look one another\r\nin the face.\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of my scene with Kolpikoff--who, by the way, never\r\nsent me "de ses nouvelles," either the following day or any day\r\nafterwards--remained for years a keen and unpleasant memory. Even so\r\nmuch as five years after it had happened I would begin fidgeting and\r\nmuttering to myself whenever I remembered the unavenged insult, and was\r\nfain to comfort myself with the satisfaction of recollecting the sort\r\nof young fellow I had shown myself to be in my subsequent affair with\r\nDubkoff. In fact, it was only later still that I began to regard the\r\nmatter in another light, and both to recall with comic appreciation my\r\npassage of arms with Kolpikoff, and to regret the undeserved affront\r\nwhich I had offered my good friend Dubkoff.\r\n\r\nWhen, at a later hour on the evening of the dinner, I told Dimitri of\r\nmy affair with Kolpikoff, whose exterior I described in detail, he was\r\nastounded.\r\n\r\n"That is the very man!" he cried. "Don\'t you know that this precious\r\nKolpikoff is a known scamp and sharper, as well as, above all things,\r\na coward, and that he was expelled from his regiment by his brother\r\nofficers because, having had his face slapped, he would not fight? But\r\nhow came you to let him get away?" he added, with a kindly smile and\r\nglance. "Surely he could not have said more to you than he did when he\r\ncalled you a cad?"\r\n\r\n"No," I admitted with a blush.\r\n\r\n"Well, it was not right, but there is no great harm done," said Dimitri\r\nconsolingly.\r\n\r\nLong afterwards, when thinking the matter over at leisure, I suddenly\r\ncame to the conclusion that it was quite possible that Kolpikoff took\r\nthe opportunity of vicariously wiping off upon me the slap in the face\r\nwhich he had once received, just as I myself took the opportunity of\r\nvicariously wiping off upon the innocent Dubkoff the epithet "cad" which\r\nKolpikoff had just applied to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. I GET READY TO PAY SOME CALLS\r\n\r\nOn awaking next morning my first thoughts were of the affair with\r\nKolpikoff. Once again I muttered to myself and stamped about the room,\r\nbut there was no help for it. To-day was the last day that I was to\r\nspend in Moscow, and it was to be spent, by Papa\'s orders, in my\r\npaying a round of calls which he had written out for me on a piece of\r\npaper--his first solicitude on our account being not so much for our\r\nmorals or our education as for our due observance of the convenances. On\r\nthe piece of paper was written in his swift, broken hand-writing: "(1)\r\nPrince Ivan Ivanovitch WITHOUT FAIL; (2) the Iwins WITHOUT FAIL; (3)\r\nPrince Michael; (4) the Princess Nechludoff and Madame Valakhina if you\r\nwish." Of course I was also to call upon my guardian, upon the rector,\r\nand upon the professors.\r\n\r\nThese last-mentioned calls, however, Dimitri advised me not to pay:\r\nsaying that it was not only unnecessary to do so, but not the thing.\r\nHowever, there were the other visits to be got through. It was the first\r\ntwo on the list--those marked as to be paid "WITHOUT FAIL"--that most\r\nalarmed me. Prince Ivan Ivanovitch was a commander-in-chief, as well\r\nas old, wealthy, and a bachelor. Consequently, I foresaw that vis-a-vis\r\nconversation between him and myself--myself a sixteen-year-old\r\nstudent!--was not likely to be interesting. As for the Iwins, they too\r\nwere rich--the father being a departmental official of high rank who had\r\nonly on one occasion called at our house during my grandmother\'s time.\r\nSince her death, I had remarked that the younger Iwin had fought shy of\r\nus, and seemed to give himself airs. The elder of the pair, I had heard,\r\nhad now finished his course in jurisprudence, and gone to hold a post\r\nin St. Petersburg, while his brother Sergius (the former object of my\r\nworship) was also in St. Petersburg, as a great fat cadet in the Corps\r\nof Pages.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a young man, not only did I dislike intercourse with people\r\nwho thought themselves above me, but such intercourse was, for me, an\r\nunbearable torture, owing partly to my constant dread of being snubbed,\r\nand partly to my straining every faculty of my intellect to prove to\r\nsuch people my independence. Yet, even if I failed to fulfil the latter\r\npart of my father\'s instructions, I felt that I must carry out\r\nthe former. I paced my room and eyed my clothes ready disposed on\r\nchairs--the tunic, the sword, and the cap. Just as I was about to set\r\nforth, old Grap called to congratulate me, bringing with him Ilinka.\r\nGrap pere was a Russianised German and an intolerably effusive,\r\nsycophantic old man who was more often than not tipsy. As a rule, he\r\nvisited us only when he wanted to ask for something, and although Papa\r\nsometimes entertained him in his study, old Grap never came to dinner\r\nwith us. With his subserviency and begging propensities went such a\r\nfaculty of good-humour and a power of making himself at home that every\r\none looked upon his attachment to us as a great honour. For my part,\r\nhowever, I never liked him, and felt ashamed when he was speaking.\r\n\r\nI was much put out by the arrival of these visitors, and made no effort\r\nto conceal the fact. Upon Ilinka I had been so used to look down, and he\r\nso used to recognise my right to do so, that it displeased me to think\r\nthat he was now as much a matriculated student as myself. In some way\r\nhe appeared to me to have made a POINT of attaining that equality. I\r\ngreeted the pair coldly, and, without offering them any refreshment\r\n(since it went against the grain to do so, and I thought they could ask\r\nfor anything, if they wanted it, without my first inviting them to state\r\ntheir requirements), gave orders for the drozhki to be got ready. Ilinka\r\nwas a good-natured, extremely moral, and far from stupid young fellow;\r\nyet, for all that, what people call a person of moods. That is to say,\r\nfor no apparent reason he was for ever in some PRONOUNCED frame of\r\nmind--now lachrymose, now frivolous, now touchy on the very smallest\r\npoint. At the present moment he appeared to be in the last-named mood.\r\nHe kept looking from his father to myself without speaking, except\r\nwhen directly addressed, at which times he smiled the self-deprecatory,\r\nforced smile under which he was accustomed to conceal his feelings, and\r\nmore especially that feeling of shame for his father which he must have\r\nexperienced in our house.\r\n\r\n"So, Nicolas Petrovitch," the old man said to me, following me\r\neverywhere about the room as I went through the operation of dressing,\r\nwhile all the while his fat fingers kept turning over and over a silver\r\nsnuff-box with which my grandmother had once presented me, "as soon as\r\never I heard from my son that you had passed your examinations so well\r\n(though of course your abilities are well-known to everyone), I at once\r\ncame to congratulate you, my dear boy. Why, I have carried you on my\r\nshoulders before now, and God knows that I love you as though you were\r\nmy own son. My Ilinka too has always been fond of you, and feels quite\r\nat home with you."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the said Ilinka remained sitting silently by the window,\r\napparently absorbed in contemplation of my three-cornered cap, and every\r\nnow and then angrily muttering something in an undertone.\r\n\r\n"Now, I also wanted to ask you, Nicolas Petrovitch." His father went\r\non, "whether my son did well in the examinations? He tells me that he is\r\ngoing to be in the same faculty as yourself, and that therefore you will\r\nbe able to keep an eye on him, and advise him, and so on."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I suppose he passed well," I replied, with a glance at Ilinka,\r\nwho, conscious of my gaze, reddened violently and ceased to move his\r\nlips about. "And might he spend the day with you?" was the father\'s next\r\nrequest, which he made with a deprecatory smile, as though he stood in\r\nactual awe of me, yet always keeping so close to me, wherever I moved,\r\nthat the fumes of the drink and tobacco in which he had been indulging\r\nwere constantly perceptible to my nostrils. I felt greatly vexed at his\r\nplacing me in such a false position towards his son, as well as at\r\nhis distracting my attention from what was, to me, a highly important\r\noperation--namely, the operation of dressing; while, over and above all,\r\nI was annoyed by the smell of liquor with which he followed me about.\r\nAccordingly, I said very coldly that I could not have the pleasure of\r\nIlinka\'s company that day, since I should be out.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I suppose you are going to see your sister?" put in Ilinka with a\r\nsmile, but without looking at me. "Well, I too have business to\r\nattend to." At this I felt even more put out, as well as pricked with\r\ncompunction; so, to soften my refusal a little, I hastened to say that\r\nthe reason why I should not be at home that day was that I had to\r\ncall upon the PRINCE Ivan Ivanovitch, the PRINCESS Kornakoff, and the\r\nMonsieur Iwin who held such an influential post, as well as, probably,\r\nto dine with the PRINCESS Nechludoff (for I thought that, on learning\r\nwhat important folk I was in the habit of mixing with, the Graps would\r\nno longer think it worth while to pretend to me). However, just as they\r\nwere leaving, I invited Ilinka to come and see me another day; but he\r\nonly murmured something unintelligible, and it was plain that he meant\r\nnever to set foot in the house again.\r\n\r\nWhen they had departed, I set off on my round of calls. Woloda, whom I\r\nhad asked that morning to come with me, in order that I might not feel\r\nquite so shy as when altogether alone, had declined on the ground that\r\nfor two brothers to be seen driving in one drozhki would appear so\r\nhorribly "proper."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. THE VALAKHIN FAMILY\r\n\r\nAccordingly I set off alone. My first call on the route lay at the\r\nValakhin mansion. It was now three years since I had seen Sonetchka,\r\nand my love for her had long become a thing of the past, yet there\r\nstill lingered in my heart a sort of clear, touching recollection of our\r\nbygone childish affection. At intervals, also, during those three years,\r\nI had found myself recalling her memory with such force and vividness\r\nthat I had actually shed tears, and imagined myself to be in love with\r\nher again, but those occasions had not lasted more than a few minutes at\r\na time, and had been long in recurring.\r\n\r\nI knew that Sonetchka and her mother had been abroad--that, in fact,\r\nthey had been so for the last two years. Also, I had heard that they had\r\nbeen in a carriage accident, and that Sonetchka\'s face had been so badly\r\ncut with the broken glass that her beauty was marred. As I drove\r\nto their house, I kept recalling the old Sonetchka to my mind, and\r\nwondering what she would look like when I met her. Somehow I imagined\r\nthat, after her two years\' sojourn abroad, she would look very tall,\r\nwith a beautiful waist, and, though sedate and imposing, extremely\r\nattractive. Somehow, also, my imagination refused to picture her with\r\nher face disfigured with scars, but, on the contrary, since I had read\r\nsomewhere of a lover who remained true to his adored one in spite of her\r\ndisfigurement with smallpox, strove to imagine that I was in love with\r\nSonetchka, for the purpose of priding myself on holding to my troth in\r\nspite of her scars--Yet, as a matter of fact, I was not really in love\r\nwith her during that drive, but having once stirred up in myself old\r\nMEMORIES of love, felt PREPARED to fall into that condition, and the\r\nmore so because, of late, my conscience had often been pricking me for\r\nhaving discarded so many of my old flames.\r\n\r\nThe Valakhins lived in a neat little wooden mansion approached by a\r\ncourtyard. I gained admittance by ringing a bell (then a rarity in\r\nMoscow), and was received by a mincing, smartly-attired page. He either\r\ncould not or made no attempt to inform me whether there was any one\r\nat home, but, leaving me alone in the dark hall, ran off down a still\r\ndarker corridor. For a long time I waited in solitude in this gloomy\r\nplace, out of which, in addition to the front door and the corridor,\r\nthere only opened a door which at the moment was closed. Rather\r\nsurprised at the dismal appearance of the house, I came to the\r\nconclusion that the reason was that its inmates were still abroad. After\r\nfive minutes, however, the door leading into the salon was opened by the\r\npage boy, who then conducted me into a neat, but not richly furnished,\r\ndrawing-room, where presently I was joined by Sonetchka.\r\n\r\nShe was now seventeen years old, and very small and thin, as well as of\r\nan unhealthy pallor of face. No scars at all were visible, however, and\r\nthe beautiful, prominent eyes and bright, cheerful smile were the same\r\nas I had known and loved in my childhood. I had not expected her to look\r\nat all like this, and therefore could not at once lavish upon her the\r\nsentiment which I had been preparing on the way. She gave me her hand in\r\nthe English fashion (which was then as much a novelty as a door-bell),\r\nand, bestowing upon mine a frank squeeze, sat down on the sofa by my\r\nside.\r\n\r\n"Ah! how glad I am to see you, my dear Nicolas!" she said as she looked\r\nme in the face with an expression of pleasure so sincere that in the\r\nwords "my dear Nicolas" I caught the purely friendly rather than the\r\npatronising note. To my surprise she seemed to me simpler, kinder, and\r\nmore sisterly after her foreign tour than she had been before it.\r\nTrue, I could now see that she had two small scars between her nose\r\nand temples, but her wonderful eyes and smile fitted in exactly with my\r\nrecollections, and shone as of old.\r\n\r\n"But how greatly you have changed!" she went on. "You are quite grown-up\r\nnow. And I-I-well, what do you think of me?"\r\n\r\n"I should never have known you," I replied, despite the fact that at the\r\nmoment I was thinking that I should have known her anywhere and always.\r\n\r\n"Why? Am I grown so ugly?" she inquired with a movement of her head.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, decidedly not!" I hastened to reply. "But you have grown taller\r\nand older. As for being uglier, why, you are even--\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; never mind. Do you remember our dances and games, and St.\r\nJerome, and Madame Dorat?" (As a matter of fact, I could not recollect\r\nany Madame Dorat, but saw that Sonetchka was being led away by the joy\r\nof her childish recollections, and mixing them up a little). "Ah! what\r\na lovely time it was!" she went on--and once more there shone before me\r\nthe same eyes and smile as I had always carried in my memory. While she\r\nhad been speaking, I had been thinking over my position at the present\r\nmoment, and had come to the conclusion that I was in love with her. The\r\ninstant, however, that I arrived at that result my careless, happy mood\r\nvanished, a mist seemed to arise before me which concealed even her eyes\r\nand smile, and, blushing hotly, I became tongue-tied and ill-at-ease.\r\n\r\n"But times are different now," she went on with a sigh and a little\r\nlifting of her eyebrows. "Everything seems worse than it used to be, and\r\nourselves too. Is it not so, Nicolas?"\r\n\r\nI could return her no answer, but sat silently looking at her.\r\n\r\n"Where are those Iwins and Kornakoffs now? Do you remember them?"\r\nshe continued, looking, I think, with some curiosity at my blushing,\r\ndowncast countenance. "What splendid times we used to have!"\r\n\r\nStill I could not answer her.\r\n\r\nThe next moment, I was relieved from this awkward position by the entry\r\nof old Madame Valakhin into the room. Rising, I bowed, and straightway\r\nrecovered my faculty of speech. On the other hand, an extraordinary\r\nchange now took place in Sonetchka. All her gaiety and bonhomie\r\ndisappeared, her smile became quite a different one, and, except for the\r\npoint of her shortness of stature, she became just the lady from abroad\r\nwhom I had expected to find in her. Yet for this change there was no\r\napparent reason, since her mother smiled every whit as pleasantly, and\r\nexpressed in her every movement just the same benignity, as of old.\r\nSeating herself in her arm-chair, the old lady signed to me to come\r\nand sit beside her; after which she said something to her daughter in\r\nEnglish, and Sonetchka left the room--a fact which still further helped\r\nto relieve me. Madame then inquired after my father and brother, and\r\npassed on to speak of her great bereavement--the loss of her husband.\r\nPresently, however, she seemed to become sensible of the fact that I was\r\nnot helping much in the conversation, for she gave me a look as much as\r\nto say: "If, now, my dear boy, you were to get up, to take your leave,\r\nand to depart, it would be well." But a curious circumstance had\r\novertaken me. While she had been speaking of her bereavement, I had\r\nrecalled to myself, not only the fact that I was in love, but the\r\nprobability that the mother knew of it: whereupon such a fit of\r\nbashfulness had come upon me that I felt powerless to put any member of\r\nmy body to its legitimate use. I knew that if I were to rise and walk I\r\nshould have to think where to plant each foot, what to do with my head,\r\nwhat with my hands, and so on. In a word, I foresaw that I should\r\nbe very much as I had been on the night when I partook too freely of\r\nchampagne, and therefore, since I felt uncertain of being able to manage\r\nmyself if I DID rise, I ended by feeling UNABLE to rise. Meanwhile, I\r\nshould say, Sonetchka had returned to the room with her work, and\r\nseated herself in a far corner--a corner whence, as I was nevertheless\r\nsensible, she could observe me. Madame must have felt some surprise as\r\nshe gazed at my crimson face and noted my complete immobility, but I\r\ndecided that it was better to continue sitting in that absurd position\r\nthan to risk something unpleasant by getting up and walking. Thus I sat\r\non and on, in the hope that some unforeseen chance would deliver me from\r\nmy predicament. That unforeseen chance at length presented itself in the\r\nperson of an unforeseen young man, who entered the room with an air\r\nof being one of the household, and bowed to me politely as he did so:\r\nwhereupon Madame rose, excused herself to me for having to speak with\r\nher "homme d\'affaires," and finally gave me a glance which said: "Well,\r\nif you DO mean to go on sitting there for ever, at least I can\'t drive\r\nyou away." Accordingly, with a great effort I also rose, but, finding it\r\nimpossible to do any leave-taking, moved away towards the door, followed\r\nby the pitying glances of mother and daughter. All at once I stumbled\r\nover a chair, although it was lying quite out of my route: the reason\r\nfor my stumbling being that my whole attention was centred upon not\r\ntripping over the carpet. Driving through the fresh air, however--where\r\nat first I muttered and fidgeted about so much that Kuzma, my coachman,\r\nasked me what was the matter--I soon found this feeling pass away,\r\nand began to meditate quietly concerning my love for Sonetchka and her\r\nrelations with her mother, which had appeared to me rather strange.\r\nWhen, afterwards, I told my father that mother and daughter had not\r\nseemed on the best of terms with one another, he said:\r\n\r\n"Yes, Madame leads the poor girl an awful life with her meanness. Yet,"\r\nadded my father with a greater display of feeling than a man might\r\nnaturally conceive for a mere relative, "she used to be such an\r\noriginal, dear, charming woman! I cannot think what has made her change\r\nso much. By the way, you didn\'t notice a secretary fellow about, did\r\nyou? Fancy a Russian lady having an affaire with a secretary!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I saw him," I replied.\r\n\r\n"And was he at least good-looking?"\r\n\r\n"No, not at all."\r\n\r\n"It is extraordinary!" concluded Papa, with a cough and an irritable\r\nhoist of his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Well, I am in love!" was my secret thought to myself as I drove along\r\nin my drozhki.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. THE KORNAKOFFS\r\n\r\nMY second call on the route lay at the Kornakoffs\', who lived on the\r\nfirst floor of a large mansion facing the Arbat. The staircase of\r\nthe building looked extremely neat and orderly, yet in no\r\nway luxurious--being lined only with drugget pinned down with\r\nhighly-polished brass rods. Nowhere were there any flowers or mirrors to\r\nbe seen. The salon, too, with its polished floor, which I traversed\r\non my way to the drawing-room, was decorated in the same cold, severe,\r\nunostentatious style. Everything in it looked bright and solid, but\r\nnot new, and pictures, flower-stands, and articles of bric-a-brac were\r\nwholly absent. In the drawing-room I found some of the young princesses\r\nseated, but seated with the sort of correct, "company" air about them\r\nwhich gave one the impression that they sat like that only when guests\r\nwere expected.\r\n\r\n"Mamma will be here presently," the eldest of them said to me as she\r\nseated herself by my side. For the next quarter of an hour, this young\r\nlady entertained me with such an easy flow of small-talk that the\r\nconversation never flagged a moment. Yet somehow she made so patent\r\nthe fact that she was just entertaining me that I felt not altogether\r\npleased. Amongst other things, she told me that their brother Stephen\r\n(whom they called Etienne, and who had been two years at the College of\r\nCadets) had now received his commission. Whenever she spoke of him,\r\nand more particularly when she told me that he had flouted his\r\nmother\'s wishes by entering the Hussars, she assumed a nervous air,\r\nand immediately her sisters, sitting there in silence, also assumed\r\na nervous air. When, again, she spoke of my grandmother\'s death, she\r\nassumed a MOURNFUL air, and immediately the others all did the same.\r\nFinally, when she recalled how I had once struck St. Jerome and been\r\nexpelled from the room, she laughed and showed her bad teeth, and\r\nimmediately all the other princesses laughed and showed their bad teeth\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nNext, the Princess-Mother herself entered--a little dried-up woman, with\r\na wandering glance and a habit of always looking at somebody else when\r\nshe was addressing one. Taking my hand, she raised her own to my lips\r\nfor me to kiss it--which otherwise, not supposing it to be necessary, I\r\nshould not have done.\r\n\r\n"How pleased I am to see you!" she said with her usual clearness of\r\narticulation as she gazed at her daughters. "And how like your mother\r\nyou look! Does he not, Lise?"\r\n\r\nLise assented, though I knew for a fact that I did not resemble my\r\nmother in the least.\r\n\r\n"And what a grown-up you have become! My Etienne, you will remember, is\r\nyour second cousin. No, not second cousin--what is it, Lise? My mother\r\nwas Barbara Dimitrievna, daughter of Dimitri Nicolaevitch, and your\r\ngrandmother was Natalia Nicolaevna."\r\n\r\n"Then he is our THIRD cousin, Mamma," said the eldest girl.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how you always confuse me!" was her mother\'s angry reply. "Not\r\nthird cousin, but COUSIN GERMAN--that is your relationship to Etienne.\r\nHe is an officer now. Did you know it? It is not well that he should\r\nhave his own way too much. You young men need keeping in hand, or--!\r\nWell, you are not vexed because your old aunt tells you the plain truth?\r\nI always kept Etienne strictly in hand, for I found it necessary to do\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is how our relationship stands," she went on. "Prince Ivan\r\nIvanovitch is my uncle, and your late mother\'s uncle also. Consequently\r\nI must have been your mother\'s first cousin--no, second cousin. Yes,\r\nthat is it. Tell me, have you been to call on Prince Ivan yet?"\r\n\r\nI said no, but that I was just going to.\r\n\r\n"Ah, is it possible?" she cried. "Why, you ought to have paid him the\r\nfirst call of all! Surely you know that he stands to you in the position\r\nof a father? He has no children of his own, and his only heirs are\r\nyourself and my children. You ought to pay him all possible deference,\r\nboth because of his age, and because of his position in the world, and\r\nbecause of everything else. I know that you young fellows of the present\r\nday think nothing of relationships and are not fond of old men, yet do\r\nyou listen to me, your old aunt, for I am fond of you, and was fond of\r\nyour mother, and had a great--a very great-liking and respect for your\r\ngrandmother. You must not fail to call upon him on any account."\r\n\r\nI said that I would certainly go, and since my present call seemed to\r\nme to have lasted long enough, I rose, and was about to depart, but she\r\nrestrained me.\r\n\r\n"No, wait a minute," she cried. "Where is your father, Lise? Go and tell\r\nhim to come here. He will be so glad to see you," she added, turning to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later Prince Michael entered. He was a short, thick-set\r\ngentleman, very slovenly dressed and ill-shaven, yet wearing such an air\r\nof indifference that he looked almost a fool. He was not in the least\r\nglad to see me--at all events he did not intimate that he was; but the\r\nPrincess (who appeared to stand in considerable awe of him) hastened to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n"Is not Woldemar here" (she seemed to have forgotten my name) "exactly\r\nlike his mother?" and she gave her husband a glance which forced him\r\nto guess what she wanted. Accordingly he approached me with his usual\r\npassionless, half-discontented expression, and held out to me an\r\nunshaven cheek to kiss.\r\n\r\n"Why, you are not dressed yet, though you have to go out soon!" was the\r\nPrincess\'s next remark to him in the angry tone which she habitually\r\nemployed in conversation with her domestics. "It will only mean your\r\noffending some one again, and trying to set people against you."\r\n\r\n"In a moment, in a moment, mother," said Prince Michael, and departed. I\r\nalso made my bows and departed.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time I had heard of our being related to Prince Ivan\r\nIvanovitch, and the news struck me unpleasantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. THE IWINS\r\n\r\nAs for the prospect of my call upon the Prince, it seemed even more\r\nunpleasant. However, the order of my route took me first to the Iwins,\r\nwho lived in a large and splendid mansion in Tverskaia Street. It was\r\nnot without some nervousness that I entered the great portico where a\r\nSwiss major-domo stood armed with his staff of office.\r\n\r\nTo my inquiry as to whether any one was at home he replied: "Whom do you\r\nwish to see, sir? The General\'s son is within."\r\n\r\n"And the General himself?" I asked with forced assurance.\r\n\r\n"I must report to him your business first. What may it be, sir?" said\r\nthe major-domo as he rang a bell. Immediately the gaitered legs of a\r\nfootman showed themselves on the staircase above; whereupon I was\r\nseized with such a fit of nervousness that I hastily bid the lacquey say\r\nnothing about my presence to the General, since I would first see his\r\nson. By the time I had reached the top of the long staircase, I seemed\r\nto have grown extremely small (metaphorically, I mean, not actually),\r\nand had very much the same feeling within me as had possessed my soul\r\nwhen my drozhki drew up to the great portico, namely, a feeling as\r\nthough drozhki, horse, and coachman had all of them grown extremely\r\nsmall too. I found the General\'s son lying asleep on a sofa, with an\r\nopen book before him. His tutor, Monsieur Frost, under whose care he\r\nstill pursued his studies at home, had entered behind me with a sort\r\nof boyish tread, and now awoke his pupil. Iwin evinced no particular\r\npleasure at seeing me, while I also seemed to notice that, while talking\r\nto me, he kept looking at my eyebrows. Although he was perfectly polite,\r\nI conceived that he was "entertaining" me much as the Princess Valakhin\r\nhad done, and that he not only felt no particular liking for me, but\r\neven that he considered my acquaintance in no way necessary to one who\r\npossessed his own circle of friends. All this arose out of the idea that\r\nhe was regarding my eyebrows. In short, his bearing towards me appeared\r\nto be (as I recognised with an awkward sensation) very much the same as\r\nmy own towards Ilinka Grap. I began to feel irritated, and to interpret\r\nevery fleeting glance which he cast at Monsieur Frost as a mute inquiry:\r\n"Why has this fellow come to see me?"\r\n\r\nAfter some conversation he remarked that his father and mother were at\r\nhome. Would I not like to visit them too?\r\n\r\n"First I will go and dress myself," he added as he departed to another\r\nroom, notwithstanding that he had seemed to be perfectly well dressed\r\n(in a new frockcoat and white waistcoat) in the present one. A few\r\nminutes later he reappeared in his University uniform, buttoned up to\r\nthe chin, and we went downstairs together. The reception rooms through\r\nwhich we passed were lofty and of great size, and seemed to be richly\r\nfurnished with marble and gilt ornaments, chintz-covered settees, and\r\na number of mirrors. Presently Madame Iwin met us, and we went into\r\na little room behind the drawing-room, where, welcoming me in very\r\nfriendly fashion, she seated herself by my side, and began to inquire\r\nafter my relations.\r\n\r\nCloser acquaintance with Madame (whom I had seen only twice before, and\r\nthat but for a moment on each occasion) impressed me favourably. She\r\nwas tall, thin, and very pale, and looked as though she suffered from\r\nchronic depression and fatigue. Yet, though her smile was a sad one, it\r\nwas very kind, and her large, mournful eyes, with a slight cast in their\r\nvision, added to the pathos and attractiveness of her expression. Her\r\nattitude, while not precisely that of a hunchback, made her whole form\r\ndroop, while her every movement expressed languor. Likewise, though her\r\nspeech was deliberate, the timbre of her voice, and the manner in which\r\nshe lisped her r\'s and l\'s, were very pleasing to the ear. Finally, she\r\ndid not "ENTERTAIN" me. Unfortunately, the answers which I returned to\r\nher questions concerning my relations seemed to afford her a painful\r\ninterest, and to remind her of happier days: with the result that when,\r\npresently, her son left the room, she gazed at me in silence for a\r\nmoment, and then burst into tears. As I sat there in mute bewilderment,\r\nI could not conceive what I had said to bring this about. At first I\r\nfelt sorry for her as she sat there weeping with downcast eyes. Next I\r\nbegan to think to myself: "Ought I not to try and comfort her, and how\r\nought that to be done?" Finally, I began to feel vexed with her for\r\nplacing me in such an awkward position. "Surely my appearance is not so\r\nmoving as all that?" I reflected. "Or is she merely acting like this to\r\nsee what I shall do under the circumstances?"\r\n\r\n"Yet it would not do for me to go," I continued to myself, "for that\r\nwould look too much as though I were fleeing to escape her tears."\r\nAccordingly I began fidgeting about on my seat, in order to remind her\r\nof my presence.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how foolish of me!" at length she said, as she gazed at me for a\r\nmoment and tried to smile. "There are days when one weeps for no reason\r\nwhatever." She felt about for her handkerchief, and then burst out\r\nweeping more violently than before.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear! How silly of me to be for ever crying like this! Yet I was so\r\nfond of your mother! We were such friends! We-we--"\r\n\r\nAt this point she found her handkerchief, and, burying her face in it,\r\nwent on crying. Once more I found myself in the same protracted dilemma.\r\nThough vexed, I felt sorry for her, since her tears appeared to be\r\ngenuine--even though I also had an idea that it was not so much for my\r\nmother that she was weeping as for the fact that she was unhappy, and\r\nhad known happier days. How it would all have ended I do not know, had\r\nnot her son reappeared and said that his father desired to see her.\r\nThereupon she rose, and was just about to leave the room, when the\r\nGeneral himself entered. He was a small, grizzled, thick-set man, with\r\nbushy black eyebrows, a grey, close-cropped head, and a very stern,\r\nhaughty expression of countenance.\r\n\r\nI rose and bowed to him, but the General (who was wearing three stars\r\non his green frockcoat) not only made no response to my salutation, but\r\nscarcely even looked at me; so that all at once I felt as though I were\r\nnot a human being at all, but only some negligible object such as a\r\nsettee or window; or, if I were a human being, as though I were quite\r\nindistinguishable from such a negligible object.\r\n\r\n"Then you have not yet written to the Countess, my dear?" he said to his\r\nwife in French, and with an imperturbable, yet determined, expression on\r\nhis countenance.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Monsieur Irtenieff," Madame said to me, in her turn, as she\r\nmade a proud gesture with her head and looked at my eyebrows just as her\r\nson had done. I bowed to her, and again to her husband, but my second\r\nsalutation made no more impression upon him than if a window had just\r\nbeen opened or closed. Nevertheless the younger Iwin accompanied me to\r\nthe door, and on the way told me that he was to go to St. Petersburg\r\nUniversity, since his father had been appointed to a post in that city\r\n(and young Iwin named a very high office in the service).\r\n\r\n"Well, his Papa may do whatsoever he likes," I muttered to myself as I\r\nclimbed into the drozhki, "but at all events I will never set foot in\r\nthat house again. His wife weeps and looks at me as though I were the\r\nembodiment of woe, while that old pig of a General does not even give\r\nme a bow. However, I will get even with him some day." How I meant to do\r\nthat I do not know, but my words nevertheless came true.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, I frequently found it necessary to remember the advice of\r\nmy father when he said that I must cultivate the acquaintanceship of the\r\nIwins, and not expect a man in the position of General Iwin to pay any\r\nattention to a boy like myself. But I had figured in that position long\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. PRINCE IVAN IVANOVITCH\r\n\r\n"Now for the last call--the visit to Nikitskaia Street," I said to\r\nKuzma, and we started for Prince Ivan Ivanovitch\'s mansion.\r\n\r\nTowards the end, a round of calls usually brings one a certain amount\r\nof self-assurance: consequently I was approaching the Prince\'s abode in\r\nquite a tranquil frame of mind, when suddenly I remembered the Princess\r\nKornakoff\'s words that I was his heir, and at the same moment caught\r\nsight of two carriages waiting at the portico. Instantly, my former\r\nnervousness returned.\r\n\r\nBoth the old major-domo who opened the door to me, and the footman who\r\ntook my coat, and the two male and three female visitors whom I found in\r\nthe drawing-room, and, most of all, Prince Ivan Ivanovitch himself (whom\r\nI found clad in a "company" frockcoat and seated on a sofa) seemed to\r\nlook at me as at an HEIR, and so to eye me with ill-will. Yet the Prince\r\nwas very gracious and, after kissing me (that is to say, after pressing\r\nhis cold, dry, flabby lips to my cheek for a second), asked me about\r\nmy plans and pursuits, jested with me, inquired whether I still wrote\r\nverses of the kind which I used to indite in honour of my grandmother\'s\r\nbirthdays, and invited me to dine with him that day. Nevertheless, in\r\nproportion as he grew the kinder, the more did I feel persuaded that his\r\ncivility was only intended to conceal from me the fact that he disliked\r\nthe idea of my being his heir. He had a custom (due to his false teeth,\r\nof which his mouth possessed a complete set) of raising his upper lip a\r\nlittle as he spoke, and producing a slight whistling sound from it; and\r\nwhenever, on the present occasion, he did so it seemed to me that he was\r\nsaying to himself: "A boy, a boy--I know it! And my heir, too--my heir!"\r\n\r\nWhen we were children, we had been used to calling the Prince "dear\r\nUncle;" but now, in my capacity of heir, I could not bring my tongue\r\nto the phrase, while to say "Your Highness," as did one of the other\r\nvisitors, seemed derogatory to my self-esteem. Consequently, never\r\nonce during that visit did I call him anything at all. The personage,\r\nhowever, who most disturbed me was the old Princess who shared with me\r\nthe position of prospective inheritor, and who lived in the Prince\'s\r\nhouse. While seated beside her at dinner, I felt firmly persuaded that\r\nthe reason why she would not speak to me was that she disliked me for\r\nbeing her co-heir, and that the Prince, for his part, paid no attention\r\nto our side of the table for the reason that the Princess and myself\r\nhoped to succeed him, and so were alike distasteful in his sight.\r\n\r\n"You cannot think how I hated it all!" I said to Dimitrieff the same\r\nevening, in a desire to make a parade of disliking the notion of being\r\nan heir (somehow I thought it the thing to do). "You cannot think how\r\nI loathed the whole two hours that I spent there!--Yet he is a\r\nfine-looking old fellow, and was very kind to me," I added--wishing,\r\namong other things, to disabuse my friend of any possible idea that my\r\nloathing had arisen out of the fact that I had felt so small. "It is\r\nonly the idea that people may be classing me with the Princess who lives\r\nwith him, and who licks the dust off his boots. He is a wonderful old\r\nman, and good and considerate to everybody, but it is awful to see how\r\nhe treats the Princess. Money is a detestable thing, and ruins all human\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n"Do you know, I think it would be far the best thing for me to have\r\nan open explanation with the Prince," I went on; "to tell him that I\r\nrespect him as a man, but think nothing of being his heir, and that\r\nI desire him to leave me nothing, since that is the only condition on\r\nwhich I can, in future, visit his house."\r\n\r\nInstead of bursting out laughing when I said this, Dimitri pondered\r\nawhile in silence, and then answered:\r\n\r\n"You are wrong. Either you ought to refrain from supposing that people\r\nmay be classing you with this Princess of whom you speak, or, if you\r\nDO suppose such a thing, you ought to suppose further that people are\r\nthinking what you yourself know quite well--namely, that such thoughts\r\nare so utterly foreign to your nature that you despise them and would\r\nnever make them a basis for action. Suppose, however, that people DO\r\nsuppose you to suppose such a thing--Well, to sum up," he added, feeling\r\nthat he was getting a little mixed in his pronouncements, "you had much\r\nbetter not suppose anything of the kind."\r\n\r\nMy friend was perfectly right, though it was not until long, long\r\nafterwards that experience of life taught me the evil that comes of\r\nthinking--still worse, of saying--much that seems very fine; taught me\r\nthat there are certain thoughts which should always be kept to oneself,\r\nsince brave words seldom go with brave deeds. I learnt then that\r\nthe mere fact of giving utterance to a good intention often makes it\r\ndifficult, nay, impossible, to carry that good intention into\r\neffect. Yet how is one to refrain from giving utterance to the brave,\r\nself-sufficient impulses of youth? Only long afterwards does one\r\nremember and regret them, even as one incontinently plucks a flower\r\nbefore its blooming, and subsequently finds it lying crushed and\r\nwithered on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe very next morning I, who had just been telling my friend Dimitri\r\nthat money corrupts all human relations, and had (as we have seen)\r\nsquandered the whole of my cash on pictures and Turkish pipes, accepted\r\na loan of twenty roubles which he suggested should pay for my travelling\r\nexpenses into the country, and remained a long while thereafter in his\r\ndebt!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. INTIMATE CONVERSATION WITH MY FRIEND\r\n\r\nTHIS conversation of ours took place in a phaeton on the way to\r\nKuntsevo. Dimitri had invited me in the morning to go with him to his\r\nmother\'s, and had called for me after luncheon; the idea being that\r\nI should spend the evening, and perhaps also pass the night, at the\r\ncountry-house where his family lived. Only when we had left the city and\r\nexchanged its grimy streets and the unbearably deafening clatter of\r\nits pavements for the open vista of fields and the subdued grinding of\r\ncarriage-wheels on a dusty high road (while the sweet spring air\r\nand prospect enveloped us on every side) did I awake from the new\r\nimpressions and sensations of freedom into which the past two days had\r\nplunged me. Dimitri was in his kind and sociable mood. That is to say,\r\nhe was neither frowning nor blinking nervously nor straightening his\r\nneck in his collar. For my own part, I was congratulating myself on\r\nthose noble sentiments which I have expressed above, in the belief that\r\nthey had led him to overlook my shameful encounter with Kolpikoff, and\r\nto refrain from despising me for it. Thus we talked together on many\r\nan intimate subject which even a friend seldom mentions to a friend. He\r\ntold me about his family whose acquaintance I had not yet made--about\r\nhis mother, his aunt, and his sister, as also about her whom Woloda and\r\nDubkoff believed to be his "flame," and always spoke of as "the lady\r\nwith the chestnut locks." Of his mother he spoke with a certain cold and\r\nformal commendation, as though to forestall any further mention of\r\nher; his aunt he extolled enthusiastically, though with a touch of\r\ncondescension in his tone; his sister he scarcely mentioned at all, as\r\nthough averse to doing so in my presence; but on the subject of "the\r\nlady with the chestnut locks" (whose real name was Lubov Sergievna,\r\nand who was a grown-up young lady living on a family footing with the\r\nNechludoffs) he discoursed with animation.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is a wonderful woman," he said with a conscious reddening of\r\nthe face, yet looking me in the eyes with dogged temerity. "True, she\r\nis no longer young, and even rather elderly, as well as by no means\r\ngood-looking; but as for loving a mere featherhead, a mere beauty--well,\r\nI never could understand that, for it is such a silly thing to do."\r\n(Dimitri said this as though he had just discovered a most novel and\r\nextraordinary truth.) "I am certain, too, that such a soul, such a heart\r\nand principles, as are hers are not to be found elsewhere in the world\r\nof the present day." (I do not know whence he had derived the habit\r\nof saying that few good things were discoverable in the world of the\r\npresent day, but at all events he loved to repeat the expression, and it\r\nsomehow suited him.)\r\n\r\n"Only, I am afraid," he went on quietly, after thus annihilating all\r\nsuch men as were foolish enough to admire mere beauty, "I am afraid\r\nthat you will not understand or realise her quickly. She is modest,\r\neven secretive, and by no means fond of exhibiting her beautiful and\r\nsurprising qualities. Now, my mother--who, as you will see, is a noble,\r\nsensible woman--has known Lubov Sergievna, for many years; yet even to\r\nthis day she does not properly understand her. Shall I tell you why I\r\nwas out of temper last evening when you were questioning me? Well, you\r\nmust know that the day before yesterday Lubov asked me to accompany her\r\nto Ivan Yakovlevitch\'s (you have heard of him, I suppose? the fellow who\r\nseems to be mad, but who, in reality, is a very remarkable man). Well,\r\nLubov is extremely religious, and understands Ivan Yakovlevitch to the\r\nfull. She often goes to see him, and converses with him, and gives\r\nhim money for the poor--money which she has earned herself. She is a\r\nmarvellous woman, as you will see. Well, I went with her to Ivan\'s,\r\nand felt very grateful to her for having afforded me the opportunity\r\nof exchanging a word with so remarkable a man; but my mother could not\r\nunderstand our action at all, and discerned in it only superstition.\r\nConsequently, last night she and I quarrelled for the first time in our\r\nlives. A very bitter one it was, too," he concluded, with a convulsive\r\nshrug of his shoulders, as though the mention of it recalled the\r\nfeelings which he had then experienced.\r\n\r\n"And what are your intentions about it all?" I inquired, to divert\r\nhim from such a disagreeable recollection. "That is to say, how do you\r\nimagine it is going to turn out? Do you ever speak to her about the\r\nfuture, or about how your love or friendship are going to end?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean, do I intend to marry her eventually?" he inquired, in his\r\nturn, with a renewed blush, but turning himself round and looking me\r\nboldly in the face.\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly," I replied as I settled myself down. "We are both of us\r\ngrown-up, as well as friends, so we may as well discuss our future life\r\nas we drive along. No one could very well overlook or overhear us now."\r\n\r\n"Why should I NOT marry her?" he went on in response to my reassuring\r\nreply. "It is my aim--as it should be the aim of every honourable\r\nman--to be as good and as happy as possible; and with her, if she\r\nshould still be willing when I have become more independent, I should be\r\nhappier and better than with the greatest beauty in the world."\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in such conversation, we hardly noticed that we were\r\napproaching Kuntsevo, or that the sky was becoming overcast and\r\nbeginning to threaten rain. On the right, the sun was slowly sinking\r\nbehind the ancient trees of the Kuntsevo park--one half of its brilliant\r\ndisc obscured with grey, subluminous cloud, and the other half sending\r\nforth spokes of flaming light which threw the old trees into striking\r\nrelief as they stood there with their dense crowns of green showing\r\nagainst a blue patch of sky. The light and shimmer of that patch\r\ncontrasted sharply with the heavy pink cloud which lay massed above\r\na young birch-tree visible on the horizon before us, while, a little\r\nfurther to the right, the parti-coloured roofs of the Kuntsevo mansion\r\ncould be seen projecting above a belt of trees and undergrowth--one side\r\nof them reflecting the glittering rays of the sun, and the other side\r\nharmonising with the more louring portion of the heavens. Below us, and\r\nto the left, showed the still blue of a pond where it lay surrounded\r\nwith pale-green laburnums--its dull, concave-looking depths repeating\r\nthe trees in more sombre shades of colour over the surface of a hillock.\r\nBeyond the water spread the black expanse of a ploughed field, with the\r\nstraight line of a dark-green ridge by which it was bisected running far\r\ninto the distance, and there joining the leaden, threatening horizon.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the soft road along which the phaeton was pursuing the\r\neven tenour of its way, bright-green, tangled, juicy belts of rye were\r\nsprouting here and there into stalk. Not a motion was perceptible in the\r\nair, only a sweet freshness, and everything looked extraordinarily clear\r\nand bright. Near the road I could see a little brown path winding its\r\nway among the dark-green, quarter-grown stems of rye, and somehow that\r\npath reminded me vividly of our village, and somehow (through some\r\nconnection of thought) the idea of that village reminded me vividly of\r\nSonetchka, and so of the fact that I was in love with her.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my fondness for Dimitri and the pleasure which his\r\nfrankness had afforded me, I now felt as though I desired to hear no\r\nmore about his feelings and intentions with regard to Lubov Sergievna,\r\nbut to talk unstintedly about my own love for Sonetchka, who seemed to\r\nme an object of affection of a far higher order. Yet for some reason\r\nor another I could not make up my mind to tell him straight out how\r\nsplendid it would seem when I had married Sonetchka and we were living\r\nin the country--of how we should have little children who would crawl\r\nabout the floor and call me Papa, and of how delighted I should be when\r\nhe, Dimitri, brought his wife, Lubov Sergievna, to see us, wearing an\r\nexpensive gown. Accordingly, instead of saying all that, I pointed to\r\nthe setting sun, and merely remarked: "Look, Dimitri! How splendid!"\r\n\r\nTo this, however, Dimitri made no reply, since he was evidently\r\ndissatisfied at my answering his confession (which it had cost him much\r\nto make) by directing his attention to natural objects (to which he\r\nwas, in general, indifferent). Upon him Nature had an effect altogether\r\ndifferent to what she had upon myself, for she affected him rather by\r\nher industry than by her beauty--he loved her rather with his intellect\r\nthan with his senses.\r\n\r\n"I am absolutely happy," I went on, without noticing that he was\r\naltogether taken up with his own thoughts and oblivious of anything that\r\nI might be saying. "You will remember how told you about a girl with\r\nwhom I used to be in love when was a little boy? Well, I saw her\r\nagain only this morning, and am now infatuated with her." Then I told\r\nhim--despite his continued expression of indifference--about my love,\r\nand about all my plans for my future connubial happiness. Strangely\r\nenough, no sooner had I related in detail the whole strength of my\r\nfeelings than I instantly became conscious of its diminution.\r\n\r\nThe rain overtook us just as we were turning into the avenue of\r\nbirch-trees which led to the house, but it did not really wet us. I only\r\nknew that it was raining by the fact that I felt a drop fall, first on\r\nmy nose, and then on my hand, and heard something begin to patter upon\r\nthe young, viscous leaves of the birch-trees as, drooping their curly\r\nbranches overhead, they seemed to imbibe the pure, shining drops with an\r\navidity which filled the whole avenue with scent. We descended from the\r\ncarriage, so as to reach the house the quicker through the garden, but\r\nfound ourselves confronted at the entrance-door by four ladies, two of\r\nwhom were knitting, one reading a book, and the fourth walking to and\r\nfro with a little dog. Thereupon, Dimitri began to present me to his\r\nmother, sister, and aunt, as well as to Lubov Sergievna. For a moment\r\nthey remained where they were, but almost instantly the rain became\r\nheavier.\r\n\r\n"Let us go into the verandah; you can present him to us there," said the\r\nlady whom I took to be Dimitri\'s mother, and we all of us ascended the\r\nentrance-steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. THE NECHLUDOFFS\r\n\r\nFrom the first, the member of this company who struck me the most was\r\nLubov Sergievna, who, holding a lapdog in her arms and wearing stout\r\nlaced boots, was the last of the four ladies to ascend the staircase,\r\nand twice stopped to gaze at me intently and then kiss her little dog.\r\nShe was anything but good-looking, since she was red-haired, thin,\r\nshort, and slightly crooked. What made her plain face all the plainer\r\nwas the queer way in which her hair was parted to one side (it looked\r\nlike the wigs which bald women contrive for themselves). However much I\r\nshould have liked to applaud my friend, I could not find a single comely\r\nfeature in her. Even her brown eyes, though expressive of good-humour,\r\nwere small and dull--were, in fact, anything but pretty; while her hands\r\n(those most characteristic of features), were though neither large nor\r\nill-shaped, coarse and red.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we reached the verandah, each of the ladies, except Dimitri\'s\r\nsister Varenika--who also had been regarding me attentively out of\r\nher large, dark-grey eyes--said a few words to me before resuming her\r\noccupation, while Varenika herself began to read aloud from a book which\r\nshe held on her lap and steadied with her finger.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Maria Ivanovna was a tall, well-built woman of forty. To\r\njudge by the curls of half-grey hair which descended below her cap one\r\nmight have taken her for more, but as soon as ever one observed the\r\nfresh, extraordinarily tender, and almost wrinkleless face, as well\r\nas, most of all, the lively, cheerful sparkle of the large eyes, one\r\ninvoluntarily took her for less. Her eyes were black and very frank, her\r\nlips thin and slightly severe, her nose regular and slightly inclined to\r\nthe left, and her hands ringless, large, and almost like those of a man,\r\nbut with finely tapering fingers. She wore a dark-blue dress fastened\r\nto the throat and sitting closely to her firm, still youthful waist--a\r\nwaist which she evidently pinched. Lastly, she held herself very\r\nupright, and was knitting a garment of some kind. As soon as I stepped\r\non to the verandah she took me by the hand, drew me to her as though\r\nwishing to scrutinise me more closely, and said, as she gazed at me with\r\nthe same cold, candid glance as her son\'s, that she had long known me\r\nby report from Dimitri, and that therefore, in order to make my\r\nacquaintance thoroughly, she had invited me to stay these twenty-four\r\nhours in her house.\r\n\r\n"Do just as you please here," she said, "and stand on no ceremony\r\nwhatever with us, even as we shall stand on none with you. Pray walk,\r\nread, listen, or sleep as the mood may take you."\r\n\r\nSophia Ivanovna was an old maid and the Princess\'s younger sister,\r\nthough she looked the elder of the two. She had that exceedingly\r\noverstuffed appearance which old maids always present who are short\r\nof stature but wear corsets. It seemed as though her healthiness had\r\nshifted upwards to the point of choking her, her short, fat hands\r\nwould not meet below her projecting bust, and the line of her waist was\r\nscarcely visible at all.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that the Princess Maria Ivanovna had black hair and\r\neyes, while Sophia Ivanovna had white hair and large, vivacious,\r\ntranquilly blue eyes (a rare combination), there was a great likeness\r\nbetween the two sisters, for they had the same expression, nose, and\r\nlips. The only difference was that Sophia\'s nose and lips were a trifle\r\ncoarser than Maria\'s, and that, when she smiled, those features inclined\r\ntowards the right, whereas Maria\'s inclined towards the left. Sophia, to\r\njudge by her dress and coiffure, was still youthful at heart, and would\r\nnever have displayed grey curls, even if she had possessed them. Yet at\r\nfirst her glance and bearing towards me seemed very proud, and made me\r\nnervous, whereas I at once felt at home with the Princess. Perhaps it\r\nwas only Sophia\'s stoutness and a certain resemblance to portraits of\r\nCatherine the Great that gave her, in my eyes, a haughty aspect, but at\r\nall events I felt quite intimidated when she looked at me intently and\r\nsaid, "Friends of our friends are our friends also." I became reassured\r\nand changed my opinion about her only when, after saying those words,\r\nshe opened her mouth and sighed deeply. It may be that she owed her\r\nhabit of sighing after every few words--with a great distention of the\r\nmouth and a slight drooping of her large blue eyes--to her stoutness,\r\nyet it was none the less one which expressed so much good-humour that\r\nI at once lost all fear of her, and found her actually attractive. Her\r\neyes were charming, her voice pleasant and musical, and even the flowing\r\nlines of her fullness seemed to my youthful vision not wholly lacking in\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nI had imagined that Lubov Sergievna, as my friend\'s friend, would at\r\nonce say something friendly and familiar to me; yet, after gazing at me\r\nfixedly for a while, as though in doubt whether the remark she was about\r\nto make to me would not be too friendly, she at length asked me what\r\nfaculty I was in. After that she stared at me as before, in evident\r\nhesitation as to whether or not to say something civil and familiar,\r\nuntil, remarking her perplexity, I besought her with a look to speak\r\nfreely. Yet all she then said was, "They tell me the Universities pay\r\nvery little attention to science now," and turned away to call her\r\nlittle dog.\r\n\r\nAll that evening she spoke only in disjointed fragments of this\r\nkind--fragments which had no connection either with the point or with\r\none another; yet I had such faith in Dimitri, and he so often kept\r\nlooking from her to me with an expression which mutely asked me, "Now,\r\nwhat do you think of that?" that, though I entirely failed to persuade\r\nmyself that in Lubov Sergievna there was anything to speak of, I could\r\nnot bear to express the thought, even to myself.\r\n\r\nAs for the last member of the family, Varenika, she was a well-developed\r\ngirl of sixteen. The only good features in her were a pair of dark-grey\r\neyes,--which, in their expression of gaiety mingled with quiet\r\nattention, greatly resembled those of her aunt--a long coil of flaxen\r\nhair, and extremely delicate, beautiful hands.\r\n\r\n"I expect, Monsieur Nicolas, you find it wearisome to hear a story begun\r\nfrom the middle?" said Sophia Ivanovna with her good-natured sigh as she\r\nturned over some pieces of clothing which she was sewing. The reading\r\naloud had ceased for the moment because Dimitri had left the room on\r\nsome errand or another.\r\n\r\n"Or perhaps you have read Rob Roy before?" she added.\r\n\r\nAt that period I thought it incumbent upon me, in virtue of my student\'s\r\nuniform, to reply in a very "clever and original" manner to every\r\nquestion put to me by people whom I did not know very well, and regarded\r\nsuch short, clear answers as "Yes," "No," "I like it," or "I do not care\r\nfor it," as things to be ashamed of. Accordingly, looking down at my new\r\nand fashionably-cut trousers and the glittering buttons of my tunic, I\r\nreplied that I had never read Rob Roy, but that it interested me greatly\r\nto hear it, since I preferred to read books from the middle rather than\r\nfrom the beginning.\r\n\r\n"It is twice as interesting," I added with a self-satisfied smirk;\r\n"for then one can guess what has gone before as well as what is to come\r\nafter."\r\n\r\nThe Princess smiled what I thought was a forced smile, but one which I\r\ndiscovered later to be her only one.\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps that is true," she said. "But tell me, Nicolas (you will\r\nnot be offended if I drop the Monsieur)--tell me, are you going to be in\r\ntown long? When do you go away?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know quite. Perhaps to-morrow, or perhaps not for some while\r\nyet," I replied for some reason or another, though I knew perfectly well\r\nthat in reality we were to go to-morrow.\r\n\r\n"I wish you could stop longer, both for your own sake and for\r\nDimitri\'s," she said in a meditative manner. "At your age friendship is\r\na weak thing."\r\n\r\nI felt that every one was looking at me, and waiting to see what I\r\nshould say--though certainly Varenika made a pretence of looking at\r\nher aunt\'s work. I felt, in fact, as though I were being put through an\r\nexamination, and that it behoved me to figure in it as well as possible.\r\n\r\n"Yes, to ME Dimitri\'s friendship is most useful," I replied, "but to HIM\r\nmine cannot be of any use at all, since he is a thousand times better\r\nthan I." (Dimitri could not hear what I said, or I should have feared\r\nhis detecting the insincerity of my words.)\r\n\r\nAgain the Princess smiled her unnatural, yet characteristically natural,\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Just listen to him!" she said. "But it is YOU who are the little\r\nmonster of perfection."\r\n\r\n"\'Monster of perfection,\'" I thought to myself. "That is splendid. I\r\nmust make a note of it."\r\n\r\n"Yet, to dismiss yourself, he has been extraordinarily clever in that\r\nquarter," she went on in a lower tone (which pleased me somehow) as she\r\nindicated Lubov Sergievna with her eyes, "since he has discovered in our\r\npoor little Auntie" (such was the pet name which they gave Lubov) "all\r\nsorts of perfections which I, who have known her and her little dog for\r\ntwenty years, had never yet suspected. Varenika, go and tell them to\r\nbring me a glass of water," she added, letting her eyes wander again.\r\nProbably she had bethought her that it was too soon, or not entirely\r\nnecessary, to let me into all the family secrets. "Yet no--let HIM go,\r\nfor he has nothing to do, while you are reading. Pray go to the door, my\r\nfriend," she said to me, "and walk about fifteen steps down the passage.\r\nThen halt and call out pretty loudly, \'Peter, bring Maria Ivanovna a\r\nglass of iced water\'"--and she smiled her curious smile once more.\r\n\r\n"I expect she wants to say something about me in my absence," I thought\r\nto myself as I left the room. "I expect she wants to remark that she can\r\nsee very clearly that I am a very, very clever young man."\r\n\r\nHardly had I taken a dozen steps when I was overtaken by Sophia\r\nIvanovna, who, though fat and short of breath, trod with surprising\r\nlightness and agility.\r\n\r\n"Merci, mon cher," she said. "I will go and tell them myself."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. LOVE\r\n\r\nSOPHIA IVANOVNA, as I afterwards came to know her, was one of those\r\nrare, young-old women who are born for family life, but to whom that\r\nhappiness has been denied by fate. Consequently all that store of their\r\nlove which should have been poured out upon a husband and children\r\nbecomes pent up in their hearts, until they suddenly decide to let it\r\noverflow upon a few chosen individuals. Yet so inexhaustible is that\r\nstore of old maids\' love that, despite the number of individuals so\r\nselected, there still remains an abundant surplus of affection which\r\nthey lavish upon all by whom they are surrounded--upon all, good or bad,\r\nwhom they may chance to meet in their daily life.\r\n\r\nOf love there are three kinds--love of beauty, the love which denies\r\nitself, and practical love.\r\n\r\nOf the desire of a young man for a young woman, as well as of the\r\nreverse instance, I am not now speaking, for of such tendresses I am\r\nwary, seeing that I have been too unhappy in my life to have been able\r\never to see in such affection a single spark of truth, but rather a\r\nlying pretence in which sensuality, connubial relations, money, and\r\nthe wish to bind hands or to unloose them have rendered feeling such a\r\ncomplex affair as to defy analysis. Rather am I speaking of that love\r\nfor a human being which, according to the spiritual strength of its\r\npossessor, concentrates itself either upon a single individual, upon\r\na few, or upon many--of love for a mother, a father, a brother,\r\nlittle children, a friend, a compatriot--of love, in short, for one\'s\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\nLove of beauty consists in a love of the sense of beauty and of its\r\nexpression. People who thus love conceive the object of their affection\r\nto be desirable only in so far as it arouses in them that pleasurable\r\nsensation of which the consciousness and the expression soothes the\r\nsenses. They change the object of their love frequently, since their\r\nprincipal aim consists in ensuring that the voluptuous feeling of their\r\nadoration shall be constantly titillated. To preserve in themselves\r\nthis sensuous condition, they talk unceasingly, and in the most elegant\r\nterms, on the subject of the love which they feel, not only for its\r\nimmediate object, but also for objects upon which it does not touch at\r\nall. This country of ours contains many such individuals--individuals\r\nof that well-known class who, cultivating "the beautiful," not only\r\ndiscourse of their cult to all and sundry, but speak of it pre-eminently\r\nin FRENCH. It may seem a strange and ridiculous thing to say, but I am\r\nconvinced that among us we have had in the past, and still have, a\r\nlarge section of society--notably women--whose love for their friends,\r\nhusbands, or children would expire to-morrow if they were debarred from\r\ndilating upon it in the tongue of France!\r\n\r\nLove of the second kind--renunciatory love--consists in a yearning\r\nto undergo self-sacrifice for the object beloved, regardless of any\r\nconsideration whether such self-sacrifice will benefit or injure the\r\nobject in question. "There is no evil which I would not endure to show\r\nboth the world and him or her whom I adore my devotion." There we have\r\nthe formula of this kind of love. People who thus love never look\r\nfor reciprocity of affection, since it is a finer thing to sacrifice\r\nyourself for one who does not comprehend you. Also, they are always\r\npainfully eager to exaggerate the merits of their sacrifice; usually\r\nconstant in their love, for the reason that they would find it hard to\r\nforego the kudos of the deprivations which they endure for the object\r\nbeloved; always ready to die, to prove to him or to her the entirety of\r\ntheir devotion; but sparing of such small daily proofs of their love\r\nas call for no special effort of self-immolation. They do not much care\r\nwhether you eat well, sleep well, keep your spirits up, or enjoy good\r\nhealth, nor do they ever do anything to obtain for you those blessings\r\nif they have it in their power; but, should you be confronting a bullet,\r\nor have fallen into the water, or stand in danger of being burnt, or\r\nhave had your heart broken in a love affair--well, for all these\r\nthings they are prepared if the occasion should arise. Moreover, people\r\naddicted to love of such a self-sacrificing order are invariably\r\nproud of their love, exacting, jealous, distrustful, and--strange to\r\ntell--anxious that the object of their adoration should incur perils (so\r\nthat they may save it from calamity, and console it thereafter) and even\r\nbe vicious (so that they may purge it of its vice).\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, that you are living in the country with a wife who loves\r\nyou in this self-sacrificing manner. You may be healthy and contented,\r\nand have occupations which interest you, while, on the other hand,\r\nyour wife may be too weak to superintend the household work (which,\r\nin consequence, will be left to the servants), or to look after the\r\nchildren (who, in consequence, will be left to the nurses), or to put\r\nher heart into any work whatsoever: and all because she loves nobody and\r\nnothing but yourself. She may be patently ill, yet she will say not a\r\nword to you about it, for fear of distressing you. She may be patently\r\nennuyee, yet for your sake she will be prepared to be so for the rest\r\nof her life. She may be patently depressed because you stick so\r\npersistently to your occupations (whether sport, books, farming, state\r\nservice, or anything else) and see clearly that they are doing you harm;\r\nyet, for all that, she will keep silence, and suffer it to be so. Yet,\r\nshould you but fall sick--and, despite her own ailments and your prayers\r\nthat she will not distress herself in vain, your loving wife will remain\r\nsitting inseparably by your bedside. Every moment you will feel her\r\nsympathetic gaze resting upon you and, as it were, saying: "There! I\r\ntold you so, but it is all one to me, and I shall not leave you." In the\r\nmorning you maybe a little better, and move into another room. The room,\r\nhowever, will be insufficiently warmed or set in order; the soup which\r\nalone you feel you could eat will not have been cooked; nor will any\r\nmedicine have been sent for. Yet, though worn out with night watching,\r\nyour loving wife will continue to regard you with an expression of\r\nsympathy, to walk about on tiptoe, and to whisper unaccustomed and\r\nobscure orders to the servants. You may wish to be read to--and your\r\nloving wife will tell you with a sigh that she feels sure you will be\r\nunable to hear her reading, and only grow angry at her awkwardness in\r\ndoing it; wherefore you had better not be read to at all. You may wish\r\nto walk about the room--and she will tell you that it would be far\r\nbetter for you not to do so. You may wish to talk with some friends who\r\nhave called--and she will tell you that talking is not good for you. At\r\nnightfall the fever may come upon you again, and you may wish to be\r\nleft alone whereupon your loving wife, though wasted, pale, and full of\r\nyawns, will go on sitting in a chair opposite you, as dusk falls, until\r\nher very slightest movement, her very slightest sound, rouses you to\r\nfeelings of anger and impatience. You may have a servant who has lived\r\nwith you for twenty years, and to whom you are attached, and who would\r\ntend you well and to your satisfaction during the night, for the reason\r\nthat he has been asleep all day and is, moreover, paid a salary for\r\nhis services; yet your wife will not suffer him to wait upon you. No;\r\neverything she must do herself with her weak, unaccustomed fingers (of\r\nwhich you follow the movements with suppressed irritation as those pale\r\nmembers do their best to uncork a medicine bottle, to snuff a candle, to\r\npour out physic, or to touch you in a squeamish sort of way). If you are\r\nan impatient, hasty sort of man, and beg of her to leave the room, you\r\nwill hear by the vexed, distressed sounds which come from her that\r\nshe is humbly sobbing and weeping behind the door, and whispering\r\nfoolishness of some kind to the servant. Finally if you do not die,\r\nyour loving wife--who has not slept during the whole three weeks of your\r\nillness (a fact of which she will constantly remind you)--will fall ill\r\nin her turn, waste away, suffer much, and become even more incapable of\r\nany useful pursuit than she was before; while by the time that you\r\nhave regained your normal state of health she will express to you\r\nher self-sacrificing affection only by shedding around you a kind of\r\nbenignant dullness which involuntarily communicates itself both to\r\nyourself and to every one else in your vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe third kind of love--practical love--consists of a yearning to\r\nsatisfy every need, every desire, every caprice, nay, every vice, of the\r\nbeing beloved. People who love thus always love their life long, since,\r\nthe more they love, the more they get to know the object beloved,\r\nand the easier they find the task of loving it--that is to say, of\r\nsatisfying its desires. Their love seldom finds expression in words, but\r\nif it does so, it expresses itself neither with assurance nor beauty,\r\nbut rather in a shamefaced, awkward manner, since people of this kind\r\ninvariably have misgivings that they are loving unworthily. People of\r\nthis kind love even the faults of their adored one, for the reason that\r\nthose faults afford them the power of constantly satisfying new\r\ndesires. They look for their affection to be returned, and even\r\ndeceive themselves into believing that it is returned, and are happy\r\naccordingly: yet in the reverse case they will still continue to\r\ndesire happiness for their beloved one, and try by every means in their\r\npower--whether moral or material, great or small--to provide it.\r\n\r\nSuch practical love it was--love for her nephew, for her niece, for\r\nher sister, for Lubov Sergievna, and even for myself, because I loved\r\nDimitri--that shone in the eyes, as well as in the every word and\r\nmovement, of Sophia Ivanovna.\r\n\r\nOnly long afterwards did I learn to value her at her true worth. Yet\r\neven now the question occurred to me: "What has made Dimitri--who\r\nthroughout has tried to understand love differently to other young\r\nfellows, and has always had before his eyes the gentle, loving Sophia\r\nIvanovna--suddenly fall so deeply in love with the incomprehensible\r\nLubov Sergievna, and declare that in his aunt he can only find good\r\nQUALITIES? Verily it is a true saying that \'a prophet hath no honour in\r\nhis own country.\' One of two things: either every man has in him more\r\nof bad than of good, or every man is more receptive to bad than to good.\r\nLubov Sergievna he has not known for long, whereas his aunt\'s love he\r\nhas known since the day of his birth."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV. I BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE NECHLUDOFFS\r\n\r\nWHEN I returned to the verandah, I found that they were not talking\r\nof me at all, as I had anticipated. On the contrary, Varenika had laid\r\naside the book, and was engaged in a heated dispute with Dimitri, who,\r\nfor his part, was walking up and down the verandah, and frowningly\r\nadjusting his neck in his collar as he did so. The subject of the\r\nquarrel seemed to be Ivan Yakovlevitch and superstition, but it was too\r\nanimated a difference for its underlying cause not to be something which\r\nconcerned the family much more nearly. Although the Princess and Lubov\r\nSergievna were sitting by in silence, they were following every word,\r\nand evidently tempted at times to take part in the dispute; yet always,\r\njust when they were about to speak, they checked themselves, and left\r\nthe field clear for the two principles, Dimitri and Varenika. On my\r\nentry, the latter glanced at me with such an indifferent air that\r\nI could see she was wholly absorbed in the quarrel and did not care\r\nwhether she spoke in my presence or not. The Princess too looked the\r\nsame, and was clearly on Varenika\'s side, while Dimitri began, if\r\nanything, to raise his voice still more when I appeared, and Lubov\r\nSergievna, for her part, observed to no one in particular: "Old people\r\nare quite right when they say, \'Si jeunesse savait, si vieillesse\r\npouvait.\'"\r\n\r\nNevertheless this quotation did not check the dispute, though it somehow\r\ngave me the impression that the side represented by the speaker and her\r\nfriend was in the wrong. Although it was a little awkward for me to be\r\npresent at a petty family difference, the fact that the true relations\r\nof the family revealed themselves during its progress, and that my\r\npresence did nothing to hinder that revelation, afforded me considerable\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\nHow often it happens that for years one sees a family cover themselves\r\nover with a conventional cloak of decorum, and preserve the real\r\nrelations of its members a secret from every eye! How often, too, have\r\nI remarked that, the more impenetrable (and therefore the more decorous)\r\nis the cloak, the harsher are the relations which it conceals! Yet, once\r\nlet some unexpected question--often a most trivial one (the colour of\r\na woman\'s hair, a visit, a man\'s horses, and so forth)--arise in that\r\nfamily circle, and without any visible cause there will also arise an\r\never-growing difference, until in time the cloak of decorum becomes\r\nunequal to confining the quarrel within due bounds, and, to the dismay\r\nof the disputants and the astonishment of the auditors, the real and\r\nill-adjusted relations of the family are laid bare, and the cloak,\r\nnow useless for concealment, is bandied from hand to hand among the\r\ncontending factions until it serves only to remind one of the years\r\nduring which it successfully deceived one\'s perceptions. Sometimes to\r\nstrike one\'s head violently against a ceiling hurts one less than just\r\nto graze some spot which has been hurt and bruised before: and in\r\nalmost every family there exists some such raw and tender spot. In the\r\nNechludoff family that spot was Dimitri\'s extraordinary affection\r\nfor Lubov Sergievna, which aroused in the mother and sister, if not a\r\njealous feeling, at all events a sense of hurt family pride. This\r\nwas the grave significance which underlay, for all those present, the\r\nseeming dispute about Ivan Yakovlevitch and superstition.\r\n\r\n"In anything that other people deride and despise you invariably profess\r\nto see something extraordinarily good!" Varenika was saying in her clear\r\nvoice, as she articulated each syllable with careful precision.\r\n\r\n"Indeed?" retorted Dimitri with an impatient toss of his head. "Now,\r\nin the first place, only a most unthinking person could ever speak of\r\nDESPISING such a remarkable man as Ivan Yakovlevitch, while, in the\r\nsecond place, it is YOU who invariably profess to see nothing good in\r\nwhat confronts you."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sophia Ivanovna kept looking anxiously at us as she turned\r\nfirst to her nephew, and then to her niece, and then to myself. Twice\r\nshe opened her mouth as though to say what was in her mind and drew a\r\ndeep sigh.\r\n\r\n"Varia, PLEASE go on reading," she said at length, at the same time\r\nhanding her niece the book, and patting her hand kindly. "I wish to\r\nknow whether he ever found HER again" (as a matter of fact, the novel in\r\nquestion contained not a word about any one finding any one else). "And,\r\nMitia dear," she added to her nephew, despite the glum looks which he\r\nwas throwing at her for having interrupted the logical thread of his\r\ndeductions, "you had better let me poultice your cheek, or your teeth\r\nwill begin to ache again."\r\n\r\nAfter that the reading was resumed. Yet the quarrel had in no way\r\ndispelled the calm atmosphere of family and intellectual harmony which\r\nenveloped this circle of ladies.\r\n\r\nClearly deriving its inspiration and character from the Princess\r\nMaria Ivanovna, it was a circle which, for me, had a wholly novel\r\nand attractive character of logicalness mingled with simplicity and\r\nrefinement. That character I could discern in the daintiness, good\r\ntaste, and solidity of everything about me, whether the handbell, the\r\nbinding of the book, the settee, or the table. Likewise, I divined it in\r\nthe upright, well-corseted pose of the Princess, in her pendant curls\r\nof grey hair, in the manner in which she had, at our first introduction,\r\ncalled me plain "Nicolas" and "he," in the occupations of the ladies\r\n(the reading and the sewing of garments), and in the unusual whiteness\r\nof their hands. Those hands, en passant, showed a family feature common\r\nto all--namely, the feature that the flesh of the palm on the outer side\r\nwas rosy in colour, and divided by a sharp, straight line from the pure\r\nwhiteness of the upper portion of the hand. Still more was the character\r\nof this feminine circle expressed in the manner in which the three\r\nladies spoke Russian and French--spoke them, that is to say, with\r\nperfect articulation of syllables and pedantic accuracy of substantives\r\nand prepositions. All this, and more especially the fact that the ladies\r\ntreated me as simply and as seriously as a real grown-up--telling me\r\ntheir opinions, and listening to my own (a thing to which I was so\r\nlittle accustomed that, for all my glittering buttons and blue facings,\r\nI was in constant fear of being told: "Surely you do not think that we\r\nare talking SERIOUSLY to you? Go away and learn something")--all this, I\r\nsay, caused me to feel an entire absence of restraint in this society. I\r\nventured at times to rise, to move about, and to talk boldly to each\r\nof the ladies except Varenika (whom I always felt it was unbecoming, or\r\neven forbidden, for me to address unless she first spoke to me).\r\n\r\nAs I listened to her clear, pleasant voice reading aloud, I kept\r\nglancing from her to the path of the flower-garden, where the\r\nrain-spots were making small dark circles in the sand, and thence to\r\nthe lime-trees, upon the leaves of which the rain was pattering down in\r\nlarge detached drops shed from the pale, shimmering edge of the livid\r\nblue cloud which hung suspended over us. Then I would glance at her\r\nagain, and then at the last purple rays of the setting sun where they\r\nwere throwing the dense clusters of old, rain-washed birches into\r\nbrilliant relief. Yet again my eyes would return to Varenika, and, each\r\ntime that they did so, it struck me afresh that she was not nearly so\r\nplain as at first I had thought her.\r\n\r\n"How I wish that I wasn\'t in love already!" I reflected, "or that\r\nSonetchka was Varenika! How nice it would be if suddenly I could become\r\na member of this family, and have the three ladies for my mother, aunt,\r\nand wife respectively!" All the time that these thoughts kept passing\r\nthrough my head I kept attentively regarding Varenika as she read, until\r\nsomehow I felt as though I were magnetising her, and that presently she\r\nmust look at me. Sure enough, at length she raised her head, threw me a\r\nglance, and, meeting my eyes, turned away.\r\n\r\n"The rain does not seem to stop," she remarked.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a new feeling came over me. I began to feel as though\r\neverything now happening to me was a repetition of some similar\r\noccurrence before--as though on some previous occasion a shower of rain\r\nhad begun to fall, and the sun had set behind birch-trees, and I\r\nhad been looking at her, and she had been reading aloud, and I had\r\nmagnetised her, and she had looked up at me. Yes, all this I seemed to\r\nrecall as though it had happened once before.\r\n\r\n"Surely she is not--SHE?" was my thought. "Surely IT is not beginning?"\r\nHowever, I soon decided that Varenika was not the "SHE" referred to, and\r\nthat "it" was not "beginning." "In the first place," I said to myself,\r\n"Varenika is not at all BEAUTIFUL. She is just an ordinary girl whose\r\nacquaintance I have made in the ordinary way, whereas the she whom I\r\nshall meet somewhere and some day and in some not ordinary way will\r\nbe anything but ordinary. This family pleases me so much only because\r\nhitherto I have never seen anybody. Such things will always be happening\r\nin the future, and I shall see many more such families during my life."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI. I SHOW OFF\r\n\r\nAT tea time the reading came to an end, and the ladies began to talk\r\namong themselves of persons and things unknown to me. This I conceived\r\nthem to be doing on purpose to make me conscious (for all their kind\r\ndemeanour) of the difference which years and position in the world had\r\nset between them and myself. In general discussions, however, in which I\r\ncould take part I sought to atone for my late silence by exhibiting that\r\nextraordinary cleverness and originality to which I felt compelled by\r\nmy University uniform. For instance, when the conversation turned upon\r\ncountry houses, I said that Prince Ivan Ivanovitch had a villa near\r\nMoscow which people came to see even from London and Paris, and that\r\nit contained balustrading which had cost 380,000 roubles. Likewise, I\r\nremarked that the Prince was a very near relation of mine, and that,\r\nwhen lunching with him the same day, he had invited me to go and spend\r\nthe entire summer with him at that villa, but that I had declined, since\r\nI knew the villa well, and had stayed in it more than once, and that all\r\nthose balustradings and bridges did not interest me, since I could\r\nnot bear ornamental work, especially in the country, where I liked\r\neverything to be wholly countrified. After delivering myself of this\r\nextraordinary and complicated romance, I grew confused, and blushed so\r\nmuch that every one must have seen that I was lying. Both Varenika, who\r\nwas handing me a cup of tea, and Sophia Ivanovna, who had been gazing at\r\nme throughout, turned their heads away, and began to talk of something\r\nelse with an expression which I afterwards learnt that good-natured\r\npeople assume when a very young man has told them a manifest string of\r\nlies--an expression which says, "Yes, we know he is lying, and why he is\r\ndoing it, the poor young fellow!"\r\n\r\nWhat I had said about Prince Ivan Ivanovitch having a country villa, I\r\nhad related simply because I could find no other pretext for mentioning\r\nboth my relationship to the Prince and the fact that I had been to\r\nluncheon with him that day; yet why I had said all I had about the\r\nbalustrading costing 380,000 roubles, and about my having several times\r\nvisited the Prince at that villa (I had never once been there--more\r\nespecially since the Prince possessed no residences save in Moscow and\r\nNaples, as the Nechludoffs very well knew), I could not possibly tell\r\nyou. Neither in childhood nor in adolescence nor in riper years did I\r\never remark in myself the vice of falsehood--on the contrary, I was, if\r\nanything, too outspoken and truthful. Yet, during this first stage of\r\nmy manhood, I often found myself seized with a strange and unreasonable\r\ntendency to lie in the most desperate fashion. I say advisedly "in the\r\nmost desperate fashion," for the reason that I lied in matters in which\r\nit was the easiest thing in the world to detect me. On the whole I\r\nthink that a vain-glorious desire to appear different from what I was,\r\ncombined with an impossible hope that the lie would never be found out,\r\nwas the chief cause of this extraordinary impulse.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, since the rain had stopped and the after-glow of sunset was\r\ncalm and clear, the Princess proposed that we should go and stroll in\r\nthe lower garden, and admire her favourite spots there. Following my\r\nrule to be always original, and conceiving that clever people like\r\nmyself and the Princess must surely be above the banalities of\r\npoliteness, I replied that I could not bear a walk with no object in\r\nview, and that, if I DID walk, I liked to walk alone. I had no idea that\r\nthis speech was simply rude; all I thought was that, even as nothing\r\ncould be more futile than empty compliments, so nothing could be more\r\npleasing and original than a little frank brusquerie. However, though\r\nmuch pleased with my answer, I set out with the rest of the company.\r\n\r\nThe Princess\'s favourite spot of all was at the very bottom of the lower\r\ngarden, where a little bridge spanned a narrow piece of swamp. The view\r\nthere was very restricted, yet very intimate and pleasing. We are so\r\naccustomed to confound art with nature that, often enough, phenomena of\r\nnature which are never to be met with in pictures seem to us unreal, and\r\ngive us the impression that nature is unnatural, or vice versa; whereas\r\nphenomena of nature which occur with too much frequency in pictures seem\r\nto us hackneyed, and views which are to be met with in real life,\r\nbut which appear to us too penetrated with a single idea or a single\r\nsentiment, seem to us arabesques. The view from the Princess\'s favourite\r\nspot was as follows. On the further side of a small lake, over-grown\r\nwith weeds round its edges, rose a steep ascent covered with bushes and\r\nwith huge old trees of many shades of green, while, overhanging the lake\r\nat the foot of the ascent, stood an ancient birch tree which, though\r\npartly supported by stout roots implanted in the marshy bank of the\r\nlake, rested its crown upon a tall, straight poplar, and dangled its\r\ncurved branches over the smooth surface of the pond--both branches and\r\nthe surrounding greenery being reflected therein as in a mirror.\r\n\r\n"How lovely!" said the Princess with a nod of her head, and addressing\r\nno one in particular.\r\n\r\n"Yes, marvellous!" I replied in my desire to show that had an opinion\r\nof my own on every subject. "Yet somehow it all looks to me so terribly\r\nlike a scheme of decoration."\r\n\r\nThe Princess went on gazing at the scene as though she had not heard me,\r\nand turning to her sister and Lubov Sergievna at intervals, in order to\r\npoint out to them its details--especially a curved, pendent bough, with\r\nits reflection in the water, which particularly pleased her. Sophia\r\nIvanovna observed to me that it was all very beautiful, and that she and\r\nher sister would sometimes spend hours together at this spot; yet it was\r\nclear that her remarks were meant merely to please the Princess. I have\r\nnoticed that people who are gifted with the faculty of loving are\r\nseldom receptive to the beauties of nature. Lubov Sergievna also seemed\r\nenraptured, and asked (among other things), "How does that birch tree\r\nmanage to support itself? Has it stood there long?" Yet the next moment\r\nshe became absorbed in contemplation of her little dog Susetka, which,\r\nwith its stumpy paws pattering to and fro upon the bridge in a mincing\r\nfashion, seemed to say by the expression of its face that this was the\r\nfirst time it had ever found itself out of doors. As for Dimitri, he\r\nfell to discoursing very logically to his mother on the subject of how\r\nno view can be beautiful of which the horizon is limited. Varenika\r\nalone said nothing. Glancing at her, I saw that she was leaning over\r\nthe parapet of the bridge, her profile turned towards me, and gazing\r\nstraight in front of her. Something seemed to be interesting her deeply,\r\nor even affecting her, since it was clear that she was oblivious to her\r\nsurroundings, and thinking neither of herself nor of the fact that any\r\none might be regarding her. In the expression of her large eyes there\r\nwas nothing but wrapt attention and quiet, concentrated thought, while\r\nher whole attitude seemed so unconstrained and, for all her shortness,\r\nso dignified that once more some recollection or another touched me and\r\nonce more I asked myself, "Is IT, then, beginning?" Yet again I assured\r\nmyself that I was already in love with Sonetchka, and that Varenika was\r\nonly an ordinary girl, the sister of my friend. Though she pleased me at\r\nthat moment, I somehow felt a vague desire to show her, by word or deed,\r\nsome small unfriendliness.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what, Dimitri," I said to my friend as I moved nearer to\r\nVarenika, so that she might overhear what I was going to say, "it seems\r\nto me that, even if there had been no mosquitos here, there would have\r\nbeen nothing to commend this spot; whereas "--and here I slapped my\r\ncheek, and in very truth annihilated one of those insects--"it is simply\r\nawful."\r\n\r\n"Then you do not care for nature?" said Varenika without turning her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"I think it a foolish, futile pursuit," I replied, well satisfied that I\r\nhad said something to annoy her, as well as something original. Varenika\r\nonly raised her eyebrows a little, with an expression of pity, and went\r\non gazing in front of her as calmly as before.\r\n\r\nI felt vexed with her. Yet, for all that, the rusty, paint-blistered\r\nparapet on which she was leaning, the way in which the dark waters of\r\nthe pond reflected the drooping branch of the overhanging birch tree (it\r\nalmost seemed to me as though branch and its reflection met), the rising\r\nodour of the swamp, the feeling of crushed mosquito on my cheek, and\r\nher absorbed look and statuesque pose--many times afterwards did these\r\nthings recur with unexpected vividness to my recollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII. DIMITRI\r\n\r\nWHEN we returned to the house from our stroll, Varenika declined to\r\nsing as she usually did in the evenings, and I was conceited enough to\r\nattribute this to my doing, in the belief that its reason lay in what\r\nI had said on the bridge. The Nechludoffs never had supper, and went to\r\nbed early, while to-night, since Dimitri had the toothache (as Sophia\r\nIvanovna had foretold), he departed with me to his room even earlier\r\nthan usual. Feeling that I had done all that was required of me by my\r\nblue collar and gilt buttons, and that every one was very pleased with\r\nme, I was in a gratified, complacent mood, while Dimitri, on the other\r\nhand, was rendered by his quarrel with his sister and the toothache\r\nboth taciturn and gloomy. He sat down at the table, got out a couple of\r\nnotebooks--a diary and the copy-book in which it was his custom every\r\nevening to inscribe the tasks performed by or awaiting him--and,\r\ncontinually frowning and touching his cheek with his hand, continued\r\nwriting for a while.\r\n\r\n"Oh, DO leave me alone!" he cried to the maid whom Sophia Ivanovna sent\r\nto ask him whether his teeth were still hurting him, and whether he\r\nwould not like to have a poultice made. Then, saying that my bed would\r\nsoon be ready for me and that he would be back presently, he departed to\r\nLubov Sergievna\'s room.\r\n\r\n"What a pity that Varenika is not good-looking and, in general,\r\nSonetchka!" I reflected when I found myself alone. "How nice it would be\r\nif, after I have left the University, I could go to her and offer her\r\nmy hand! I would say to her, \'Princess, though no longer young, and\r\ntherefore unable to love passionately, I will cherish you as a dear\r\nsister. And you,\' I would continue to her mother, \'I greatly respect;\r\nand you, Sophia Ivanovna, I value highly. Therefore say to me, Varenika\r\n(since I ask you to be my wife), just the simple and direct word YES.\'\r\nAnd she would give me her hand, and I should press it, and say, \'Mine is\r\na love which depends not upon words, but upon deeds.\' And suppose,"\r\nnext came into my head, "that Dimitri should suddenly fall in love with\r\nLubotshka (as Lubotshka has already done with him), and should desire to\r\nmarry her? Then either one or the other of us would have to resign all\r\nthought of marriage. Well, it would be splendid, for in that case I\r\nshould act thus. As soon as I had noticed how things were, I should make\r\nno remark, but go to Dimitri and say, \'It is no use, my friend, for you\r\nand I to conceal our feelings from one another. You know that my love\r\nfor your sister will terminate only with my life. Yet I know all; and\r\nthough you have deprived me of all hope, and have rendered me an unhappy\r\nman, so that Nicolas Irtenieff will have to bewail his misery for the\r\nrest of his existence, yet do you take my sister,\' and I should lay\r\nhis hand in Lubotshka\'s. Then he would say to me, \'No, not for all the\r\nworld!\' and I should reply, \'Prince Nechludoff, it is in vain for you to\r\nattempt to outdo me in nobility. Not in the whole world does there exist\r\na more magnanimous being than Nicolas Irtenieff.\' Then I should salute\r\nhim and depart. In tears Dimitri and Lubotshka would pursue me, and\r\nentreat me to accept their sacrifice, and I should consent to do so,\r\nand, perhaps, be happy ever afterwards--if only I were in love with\r\nVarenika." These fancies tickled my imagination so pleasantly that I\r\nfelt as though I should like to communicate them to my friend; yet,\r\ndespite our mutual vow of frankness, I also felt as though I had not the\r\nphysical energy to do so.\r\n\r\nDimitri returned from Lubov Sergievna\'s room with some toothache\r\ncapsules which she had given him, yet in even greater pain, and\r\ntherefore in even greater depression, than before. Evidently no bedroom\r\nhad yet been prepared for me, for presently the boy who acted as\r\nDimitri\'s valet arrived to ask him where I was to sleep.\r\n\r\n"Oh, go to the devil!" cried Dimitri, stamping his foot. "Vasika,\r\nVasika, Vasika!" he went on, the instant that the boy had left the room,\r\nwith a gradual raising of his voice at each repetition. "Vasika, lay me\r\nout a bed on the floor."\r\n\r\n"No, let ME sleep on the floor," I objected.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is all one. Lie anywhere you like," continued Dimitri in the\r\nsame angry tone. "Vasika, why don\'t you go and do what I tell you?"\r\n\r\nEvidently Vasika did not understand what was demanded of him, for he\r\nremained where he was.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with you? Go and lay the bed, Vasika, I tell you!"\r\nshouted Dimitri, suddenly bursting into a sort of frenzy; yet Vasika\r\nstill did not understand, but, blushing hotly, stood motionless.\r\n\r\n"So you are determined to drive me mad, are you?"--and leaping from his\r\nchair and rushing upon the boy, Dimitri struck him on the head with the\r\nwhole weight of his fist, until the boy rushed headlong from the room.\r\nHalting in the doorway, Dimitri glanced at me, and the expression of\r\nfury and pain which had sat for a moment on his countenance suddenly\r\ngave place to such a boyish, kindly, affectionate, yet ashamed,\r\nexpression that I felt sorry for him, and reconsidered my intention of\r\nleaving him to himself. He said nothing, but for a long time paced the\r\nroom in silence, occasionally glancing at me with the same deprecatory\r\nexpression as before. Then he took his notebook from the table, wrote\r\nsomething in it, took off his jacket and folded it carefully, and,\r\nstepping into the corner where the ikon hung, knelt down and began to\r\nsay his prayers, with his large white hands folded upon his breast. So\r\nlong did he pray that Vasika had time to bring a mattress and spread it,\r\nunder my whispered directions, on the floor. Indeed, I had undressed\r\nand laid myself down upon the mattress before Dimitri had finished. As I\r\ncontemplated his slightly rounded back and the soles of his feet (which\r\nsomehow seemed to stick out in my direction in a sort of repentant\r\nfashion whenever he made his obeisances), I felt that I liked him more\r\nthan ever, and debated within myself whether or not I should tell him\r\nall I had been fancying concerning our respective sisters. When he had\r\nfinished his prayers, he lay down upon the bed near me, and, propping\r\nhimself upon his elbow, looked at me in silence, with a kindly, yet\r\nabashed, expression. Evidently he found it difficult to do this, yet\r\nmeant thus to punish himself. Then I smiled and returned his gaze, and\r\nhe smiled back at me.\r\n\r\n"Why do you not tell me that my conduct has been abominable?" he said.\r\n"You have been thinking so, have you not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied; and although it was something quite different which\r\nhad been in my mind, it now seemed to me that that was what I had been\r\nthinking. "Yes, it was not right of you, nor should I have expected it\r\nof you." It pleased me particularly at that moment to call him by the\r\nfamiliar second person singular. "But how are your teeth now?" I added.\r\n\r\n"Oh, much better. Nicolinka, my friend," he went on, and so feelingly\r\nthat it sounded as though tears were standing in his eyes, "I know\r\nand feel that I am bad, but God sees how I try to be better, and how I\r\nentreat Him to make me so. Yet what am I to do with such an unfortunate,\r\nhorrible nature as mine? What am I to do with it? I try to keep myself\r\nin hand and to rule myself, but suddenly it becomes impossible for me\r\nto do so--at all events, impossible for me to do so unaided. I need\r\nthe help and support of some one. Now, there is Lubov Sergievna; SHE\r\nunderstands me, and could help me in this, and I know by my notebook\r\nthat I have greatly improved in this respect during the past year.\r\nAh, my dear Nicolinka"--he spoke with the most unusual and unwonted\r\ntenderness, and in a tone which had grown calmer now that he had made\r\nhis confession--"how much the influence of a woman like Lubov could do\r\nfor me! Think how good it would be for me if I could have a friend like\r\nher to live with when I have become independent! With her I should be\r\nanother man."\r\n\r\nAnd upon that Dimitri began to unfold to me his plans for marriage, for\r\na life in the country, and for continual self-discipline.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will live in the country," he said, "and you shall come to see\r\nme when you have married Sonetchka. Our children shall play together.\r\nAll this may seem to you stupid and ridiculous, yet it may very well\r\ncome to pass."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it very well may" I replied with a smile, yet thinking how much\r\nnicer it would be if I married his sister.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," he went on presently; "you only imagine yourself to\r\nbe in love with Sonetchka, whereas I can see that it is all rubbish, and\r\nthat you do not really know what love means."\r\n\r\nI did not protest, for, in truth, I almost agreed with him, and for a\r\nwhile we lay without speaking.\r\n\r\n"Probably you have noticed that I have been in my old bad humour today,\r\nand have had a nasty quarrel with Varia?" he resumed. "I felt bad about\r\nit afterwards--more particularly since it occurred in your presence.\r\nAlthough she thinks wrongly on some subjects, she is a splendid girl and\r\nvery good, as you will soon recognise."\r\n\r\nHis quick transition from mention of my love affairs to praise of his\r\nsister pleased me extremely, and made me blush, but I nevertheless said\r\nnothing more about his sister, and we went on talking of other things.\r\n\r\nThus we chattered until the cocks had crowed twice. In fact, the pale\r\ndawn was already looking in at the window when at last Dimitri lay down\r\nupon his bed and put out the candle.\r\n\r\n"Well, now for sleep," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied, "but--"\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\n"Now nice it is to be alive in the daylight!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it IS a splendid thing!" he replied in a voice which, even in the\r\ndarkness, enabled me to see the expression of his cheerful, kindly eyes\r\nand boyish smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII. IN THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\nNext day Woloda and myself departed in a post-chaise for the country.\r\nTurning over various Moscow recollections in my head as we drove along,\r\nI suddenly recalled Sonetchka Valakhin--though not until evening, and\r\nwhen we had already covered five stages of the road. "It is a strange\r\nthing," I thought, "that I should be in love, and yet have forgotten all\r\nabout it. I must start and think about her," and straightway I proceeded\r\nto do so, but only in the way that one thinks when travelling--that is\r\nto say, disconnectedly, though vividly. Thus I brought myself to such a\r\ncondition that, for the first two days after our arrival home, I somehow\r\nconsidered it incumbent upon me always to appear sad and moody in the\r\npresence of the household, and especially before Katenka, whom I looked\r\nupon as a great connoisseur in matters of this kind, and to whom I threw\r\nout a hint of the condition in which my heart was situated. Yet, for\r\nall my attempts at dissimulation and assiduous adoption of such signs\r\nof love sickness as I had occasionally observed in other people, I\r\nonly succeeded for two days (and that at intervals, and mostly towards\r\nevening) in reminding myself of the fact that I was in love, and\r\nfinally, when I had settled down into the new rut of country life and\r\npursuits, I forgot about my affection for Sonetchka altogether.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Petrovskoe in the night time, and I was then so soundly\r\nasleep that I saw nothing of the house as we approached it, nor yet of\r\nthe avenue of birch trees, nor yet of the household--all of whom had\r\nlong ago betaken themselves to bed and to slumber. Only old hunchbacked\r\nFoka--bare-footed, clad in some sort of a woman\'s wadded nightdress, and\r\ncarrying a candlestick--opened the door to us. As soon as he saw who\r\nwe were, he trembled all over with joy, kissed us on the shoulders,\r\nhurriedly put on his felt slippers, and started to dress himself\r\nproperly. I passed in a semi-waking condition through the porch and up\r\nthe steps, but in the hall the lock of the door, the bars and bolts,\r\nthe crooked boards of the flooring, the chest, the ancient candelabrum\r\n(splashed all over with grease as of old), the shadows thrown by the\r\ncrooked, chill, recently-lighted stump of candle, the perennially dusty,\r\nunopened window behind which I remembered sorrel to have grown--all was\r\nso familiar, so full of memories, so intimate of aspect, so, as it were,\r\nknit together by a single idea, that I suddenly became conscious of a\r\ntenderness for this quiet old house. Involuntarily I asked myself,\r\n"How have we, the house and I, managed to remain apart so long?" and,\r\nhurrying from spot to spot, ran to see if all the other rooms were still\r\nthe same. Yes, everything was unchanged, except that everything had\r\nbecome smaller and lower, and I myself taller, heavier, and more filled\r\nout. Yet, even as I was, the old house received me back into its arms,\r\nand aroused in me with every board, every window, every step of the\r\nstairs, and every sound the shadows of forms, feelings, and events of\r\nthe happy but irrevocable past. When we entered our old night nursery,\r\nall my childish fears lurked once more in the darkness of the corners\r\nand doorway. When we passed into the drawing-room, I could feel the old\r\ncalm motherly love diffusing itself from every object in the apartment.\r\nIn the breakfast-room, the noisy, careless merriment of childhood seemed\r\nmerely to be waiting to wake to life again. In the divannaia\r\n(whither Foka first conducted us, and where he had prepared our beds)\r\neverything--mirror, screen, old wooden ikon, the lumps on the walls\r\ncovered with white paper--seemed to speak of suffering and of death and\r\nof what would never come back to us again.\r\n\r\nWe got into bed, and Foka, bidding us good-night, retired.\r\n\r\n"It was in this room that Mamma died, was it not?" said Woloda.\r\n\r\nI made no reply, but pretended to be asleep. If I had said anything I\r\nshould have burst into tears. On awaking next morning, I beheld Papa\r\nsitting on Woloda\'s bed in his dressing gown and slippers and smoking a\r\ncigar. Leaping up with a merry hoist of the shoulders, he came over to\r\nme, slapped me on the back with his great hand, and presented me his\r\ncheek to press my lips to.\r\n\r\n"Well done, DIPLOMAT!" he said in his most kindly jesting tone as he\r\nlooked at me with his small bright eyes. "Woloda tells me you have\r\npassed the examinations well for a youngster, and that is a splendid\r\nthing. Unless you start and play the fool, I shall have another fine\r\nlittle fellow in you. Thanks, my dear boy. Well, we will have a grand\r\ntime of it here now, and in the winter, perhaps, we shall move to St.\r\nPetersburg. I only wish the hunting was not over yet, or I could have\r\ngiven you some amusement in THAT way. Can you shoot, Woldemar? However,\r\nwhether there is any game or not, I will take you out some day. Next\r\nwinter, if God pleases, we will move to St. Petersburg, and you shall\r\nmeet people, and make friends, for you are now my two young grown-ups.\r\nI have been telling Woldemar that you are just starting on your careers,\r\nwhereas my day is ended. You are old enough now to walk by yourselves,\r\nbut, whenever you wish to confide in me, pray do so, for I am no longer\r\nyour nurse, but your friend. At least, I will be your friend and comrade\r\nand adviser as much as I can and more than that I cannot do. How does\r\nthat fall in with your philosophy, eh, Koko? Well or ill, eh?"\r\n\r\nOf course I said that it fell in with it entirely, and, indeed, I really\r\nthought so. That morning Papa had a particularly winning, bright, and\r\nhappy expression on his face, and these new relations between us, as of\r\nequals and comrades, made me love him all the more.\r\n\r\n"Now, tell me," he went on, "did you call upon all our kinsfolk and the\r\nIwins? Did you see the old man, and what did he say to you? And did you\r\ngo to Prince Ivan\'s?"\r\n\r\nWe continued talking so long that, before we were fully dressed, the sun\r\nhad left the window of the divannaia, and Jakoff (the same old man who\r\nof yore had twirled his fingers behind his back and always repeated his\r\nwords) had entered the room and reported to Papa that the carriage was\r\nready.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going to?" I asked Papa.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I had forgotten all about it!" he replied, with a cough and\r\nthe usual hoisting of his shoulder. "I promised to go and call upon\r\nEpifanova to-day. You remember Epifanova--\'la belle Flamande\'--don\'t\r\nyou, who used to come and see your Mamma? They are nice people." And\r\nwith a self-conscious shrug of his shoulders (so it appeared to me) Papa\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nDuring our conversation, Lubotshka had more than once come to the door\r\nand asked "Can I come in?" but Papa had always shouted to her that she\r\ncould not do so, since we were not dressed yet.\r\n\r\n"What rubbish!" she replied. "Why, I have seen you in your\r\ndressing-gown."\r\n\r\n"Never mind; you cannot see your brothers without their inexpressibles,"\r\nrejoined Papa. "If they each of them just go to the door, let that be\r\nenough for you. Now go. Even for them to SPEAK to you in such a neglige\r\ncostume is unbecoming."\r\n\r\n"How unbearable you are!" was Lubotshka\'s parting retort. "Well, at\r\nleast hurry up and come down to the drawing-room, for Mimi wants to see\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nAs soon as Papa had left the room, I hastened to array myself in my\r\nstudent\'s uniform, and to repair to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nWoloda, on the other hand, was in no hurry, but remained sitting on\r\nhis bed and talking to Jakoff about the best places to find plover and\r\nsnipe. As I have said, there was nothing in the world he so much feared\r\nas to be suspected of any affection for his father, brother, and sister;\r\nso that, to escape any expression of that feeling, he often fell into\r\nthe other extreme, and affected a coldness which shocked people who did\r\nnot comprehend its cause. In the hall, I collided with Papa, who was\r\nhurrying towards the carriage with short, rapid steps. He had a new and\r\nfashionable Moscow greatcoat on, and smelt of scent. On seeing me, he\r\ngave a cheerful nod, as much as to say, "Do you remark my splendour?"\r\nand once again I was struck with the happy expression of face which I\r\nhad noted earlier in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room looked the same lofty, bright room as of Yore, with its\r\nbrown English piano, and its large open windows looking on to the green\r\ntrees and yellowish-red paths of the garden. After kissing Mimi and\r\nLubotshka, I was approaching Katenka for the same purpose when it\r\nsuddenly struck me that it might be improper for me to salute her in\r\nthat fashion. Accordingly I halted, silent and blushing. Katenka, for\r\nher part, was quite at her ease as she held out a white hand to me and\r\ncongratulated me on my passing into the University. The same thing took\r\nplace when Woloda entered the drawing-room and met Katenka. Indeed,\r\nit was something of a problem how, after being brought up together and\r\nseeing one another daily, we ought now, after this first separation, to\r\nmeet again. Katenka had grown better-looking than any of us, yet Woloda\r\nseemed not at all confused as, with a slight bow to her, he crossed over\r\nto Lubotshka, made a jesting remark to her, and then departed somewhere\r\non some solitary expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX. RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GIRLS AND OURSELVES\r\n\r\nOF the girls Woloda took the strange view that, although he wished that\r\nthey should have enough to eat, should sleep well, be well dressed,\r\nand avoid making such mistakes in French as would shame him before\r\nstrangers, he would never admit that they could think or feel like human\r\nbeings, still less that they could converse with him sensibly about\r\nanything. Whenever they addressed to him a serious question (a thing, by\r\nthe way, which he always tried to avoid), such as asking his opinion on\r\na novel or inquiring about his doings at the University, he invariably\r\npulled a grimace, and either turned away without speaking or answered\r\nwith some nonsensical French phrase--"Comme c\'est tres jolie!" or the\r\nlike. Or again, feigning to look serious and stolidly wise, he would say\r\nsomething absolutely meaningless and bearing no relation whatever to the\r\nquestion asked him, or else suddenly exclaim, with a look of\r\npretended unconsciousness, the word bulku or poyechali or kapustu,\r\n[Respectively, "roll of butter," "away," and "cabbage."] or something of\r\nthe kind; and when, afterwards, I happened to repeat these words to him\r\nas having been told me by Lubotshka or Katenka, he would always remark:\r\n\r\n"Hm! So you actually care about talking to them? I can see you are a\r\nduffer still"--and one needed to see and near him to appreciate the\r\nprofound, immutable contempt which echoed in this remark. He had been\r\ngrown-up now two years, and was in love with every good-looking woman\r\nthat he met; yet, despite the fact that he came in daily contact with\r\nKatenka (who during those two years had been wearing long dresses, and\r\nwas growing prettier every day), the possibility of his falling in love\r\nwith her never seemed to enter his head. Whether this proceeded from the\r\nfact that the prosaic recollections of childhood were still too fresh\r\nin his memory, or whether from the aversion which very young people\r\nfeel for everything domestic, or whether from the common human weakness\r\nwhich, at a first encounter with anything fair and pretty, leads a man\r\nto say to himself, "Ah! I shall meet much more of the same kind during\r\nmy life," but at all events Woloda had never yet looked upon Katenka\r\nwith a man\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nAll that summer Woloda appeared to find things very wearisome--a fact\r\nwhich arose out of that contempt for us all which, as I have said,\r\nhe made no effort to conceal. His expression of face seemed to be\r\nconstantly saying, "Phew! how it bores me to have no one to speak to!"\r\nThe first thing in the morning he would go out shooting, or sit reading\r\na book in his room, and not dress until luncheon time. Indeed, if\r\nPapa was not at home, he would take his book into that meal, and go on\r\nreading it without addressing so much as a single word to any one of us,\r\nwho felt, somehow, guilty in his presence. In the evening, too, he would\r\nstretch himself on a settee in the drawing-room, and either go to sleep,\r\npropped on his elbow, or tell us farcical stories--sometimes stories so\r\nimproper as to make Mimi grow angry and blush, and ourselves die with\r\nlaughter. At other times he would not condescend to address a single\r\nserious word to any member of the family except Papa or (occasionally)\r\nmyself. Involuntarily I offended against his view of girls, seeing that\r\nI was not so afraid of seeming affectionate as he, and, moreover, had\r\nnot such a profound and confirmed contempt for young women. Yet several\r\ntimes that summer, when driven by lack of amusement to try and engage\r\nLubotshka and Katenka in conversation, I always encountered in them such\r\nan absence of any capacity for logical thinking, and such an ignorance\r\nof the simplest, most ordinary matters (as, for instance, the nature of\r\nmoney, the subjects studied at universities, the effect of war, and so\r\nforth), as well as such indifference to my explanations of such matters,\r\nthat these attempts of mine only ended in confirming my unfavourable\r\nopinion of feminine ability.\r\n\r\nI remember one evening when Lubotshka kept repeating some unbearably\r\ntedious passage on the piano about a hundred times in succession, while\r\nWoloda, who was dozing on a settee in the drawing-room, kept addressing\r\nno one in particular as he muttered, "Lord! how she murders it! WHAT a\r\nmusician! WHAT a Beethoven!" (he always pronounced the composer\'s name\r\nwith especial irony). "Wrong again! Now--a second time! That\'s it!"\r\nand so on. Meanwhile Katenka and I were sitting by the tea-table, and\r\nsomehow she began to talk about her favourite subject--love. I was in\r\nthe right frame of mind to philosophise, and began by loftily defining\r\nlove as the wish to acquire in another what one does not possess in\r\noneself. To this Katenka retorted that, on the contrary, love is not\r\nlove at all if a girl desires to marry a man for his money alone, but\r\nthat, in her opinion, riches were a vain thing, and true love only the\r\naffection which can stand the test of separation (this I took to be a\r\nhint concerning her love for Dubkoff). At this point Woloda, who must\r\nhave been listening all the time, raised himself on his elbow, and cried\r\nout some rubbish or another; and I felt that he was right.\r\n\r\nApart from the general faculties (more or less developed in different\r\npersons) of intellect, sensibility, and artistic feeling, there also\r\nexists (more or less developed in different circles of society, and\r\nespecially in families) a private or individual faculty which I may\r\ncall APPREHENSION. The essence of this faculty lies in sympathetic\r\nappreciation of proportion, and in identical understanding of things.\r\nTwo individuals who possess this faculty and belong to the same social\r\ncircle or the same family apprehend an expression of feeling precisely\r\nto the same point, namely, the point beyond which such expression\r\nbecomes mere phrasing. Thus they apprehend precisely where commendation\r\nends and irony begins, where attraction ends and pretence begins, in a\r\nmanner which would be impossible for persons possessed of a different\r\norder of apprehension. Persons possessed of identical apprehension view\r\nobjects in an identically ludicrous, beautiful, or repellent light; and\r\nin order to facilitate such identical apprehension between members of\r\nthe same social circle or family, they usually establish a language,\r\nturns of speech, or terms to define such shades of apprehension as exist\r\nfor them alone. In our particular family such apprehension was common\r\nto Papa, Woloda, and myself, and was developed to the highest pitch,\r\nDubkoff also approximated to our coterie in apprehension, but Dimitri,\r\nthough infinitely more intellectual than Dubkoff, was grosser in this\r\nrespect. With no one, however, did I bring this faculty to such a point\r\nas with Woloda, who had grown up with me under identical conditions.\r\nPapa stood a long way from us, and much that was to us as clear as "two\r\nand two make four" was to him incomprehensible. For instance, I and\r\nWoloda managed to establish between ourselves the following terms, with\r\nmeanings to correspond. Izium [Raisins.] meant a desire to boast of\r\none\'s money; shishka [Bump or swelling.] (on pronouncing which one had\r\nto join one\'s fingers together, and to put a particular emphasis upon\r\nthe two sh\'s in the word) meant anything fresh, healthy, and comely, but\r\nnot elegant; a substantive used in the plural meant an undue partiality\r\nfor the object which it denoted; and so forth, and so forth. At the same\r\ntime, the meaning depended considerably upon the expression of the\r\nface and the context of the conversation; so that, no matter what new\r\nexpression one of us might invent to define a shade of feeling the other\r\ncould immediately understand it by a hint alone. The girls did not share\r\nthis faculty of apprehension, and herein lay the chief cause of our\r\nmoral estrangement, and of the contempt which we felt for them.\r\n\r\nIt may be that they too had their "apprehension," but it so little ran\r\nwith ours that, where we already perceived the "phrasing," they still\r\nsaw only the feeling--our irony was for them truth, and so on. At that\r\ntime I had not yet learnt to understand that they were in no way\r\nto blame for this, and that absence of such apprehension in no way\r\nprevented them from being good and clever girls. Accordingly I looked\r\ndown upon them. Moreover, having once lit upon my precious idea of\r\n"frankness," and being bent upon applying it to the full in myself, I\r\nthought the quiet, confiding nature of Lubotshka guilty of secretiveness\r\nand dissimulation simply because she saw no necessity for digging up and\r\nexamining all her thoughts and instincts. For instance, the fact that\r\nshe always signed the sign of the cross over Papa before going to bed,\r\nthat she and Katenka invariably wept in church when attending requiem\r\nmasses for Mamma, and that Katenka sighed and rolled her eyes about when\r\nplaying the piano--all these things seemed to me sheer make-believe, and\r\nI asked myself: "At what period did they learn to pretend like grown-up\r\npeople, and how can they bring themselves to do it?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX. HOW I EMPLOYED MY TIME\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the fact that that summer I developed a passion for music\r\ncaused me to become better friends with the ladies of our household\r\nthan I had been for years. In the spring, a young fellow came to see us,\r\narmed with a letter of introduction, who, as soon as ever he entered the\r\ndrawing-room, fixed his eyes upon the piano, and kept gradually\r\nedging his chair closer to it as he talked to Mimi and Katenka. After\r\ndiscoursing awhile of the weather and the amenities of country life, he\r\nskilfully directed the conversation to piano-tuners, music, and pianos\r\ngenerally, and ended by saying that he himself played--and in truth\r\nhe did sit down and perform three waltzes, with Mimi, Lubotshka, and\r\nKatenka grouped about the instrument, and watching him as he did so. He\r\nnever came to see us again, but his playing, and his attitude when at\r\nthe piano, and the way in which he kept shaking his long hair, and, most\r\nof all, the manner in which he was able to execute octaves with his left\r\nhand as he first of all played them rapidly with his thumb and little\r\nfinger, and then slowly closed those members, and then played the\r\noctaves afresh, made a great impression upon me. This graceful gesture\r\nof his, together with his easy pose and his shaking of hair and\r\nsuccessful winning of the ladies\' applause by his talent, ended by\r\nfiring me to take up the piano. Convinced that I possessed both talent\r\nand a passion for music, I set myself to learn, and, in doing so, acted\r\njust as millions of the male--still more, of the female--sex have done\r\nwho try to teach themselves without a skilled instructor, without any\r\nreal turn for the art, or without the smallest understanding either of\r\nwhat the art can give or of what ought to be done to obtain that gift.\r\nFor me music (or rather, piano-playing) was simply a means of winning\r\nthe ladies\' good graces through their sensibility. With the help of\r\nKatenka I first learnt the notes (incidentally breaking several of them\r\nwith my clumsy fingers), and then--that is to say, after two months of\r\nhard work, supplemented by ceaseless twiddling of my rebellious fingers\r\non my knees after luncheon, and on the pillow when in bed--went on to\r\n"pieces," which I played (so Katenka assured me) with "soul" ("avec\r\name"), but altogether regardless of time.\r\n\r\nMy range of pieces was the usual one--waltzes, galops, "romances,"\r\n"arrangements," etcetera; all of them of the class of delightful\r\ncompositions of which any one with a little healthy taste could point\r\nout a selection among the better class works contained in any volume\r\nof music and say, "These are what you ought NOT to play, seeing that\r\nanything worse, less tasteful, and more silly has never yet been\r\nincluded in any collection of music,"--but which (probably for that very\r\nreason) are to be found on the piano of every Russian lady. True, we\r\nalso possessed an unfortunate volume which contained Beethoven\'s "Sonate\r\nPathetique" and the C minor Sonata (a volume lamed for life by the\r\nladies--more especially by Lubotshka, who used to discourse music from\r\nit in memory of Mamma), as well as certain other good pieces which her\r\nteacher in Moscow had given her; but among that collection there were\r\nlikewise compositions of the teacher\'s own, in the shape of clumsy\r\nmarches and galops--and these too Lubotshka used to play! Katenka and\r\nI cared nothing for serious works, but preferred, above all things, "Le\r\nFou" and "The Nightingale"--the latter of which Katenka would play until\r\nher fingers almost became invisible, and which I too was beginning to\r\nexecute with much vigour and some continuity. I had adopted the gestures\r\nof the young man of whom I have spoken, and frequently regretted that\r\nthere were no strangers present to see me play. Soon, however, I began\r\nto realise that Liszt and Kalkbrenner were beyond me, and that I should\r\nnever overtake Katenka. Accordingly, imagining that classical music was\r\neasier (as well as, partly, for the sake of originality), I suddenly\r\ncame to the conclusion that I loved abstruse German music. I began to\r\ngo into raptures whenever Lubotshka played the "Sonate Pathetique," and\r\nalthough (if the truth be told) that work had for years driven me to the\r\nverge of distraction, I set myself to play Beethoven, and to talk of him\r\nas "Beethoven." Yet through all this chopping and changing and pretence\r\n(as I now conceive) there may have run in me a certain vein of talent,\r\nsince music sometimes affected me even to tears, and things which\r\nparticularly pleased me I could strum on the piano afterwards (in a\r\ncertain fashion) without the score; so that, had any one taught me at\r\nthat period to look upon music as an end, a grace, in itself, and\r\nnot merely as a means for pleasing womenfolk with the velocity and\r\npseudo-sentiment of one\'s playing, I might possibly have become a\r\npassable musician.\r\n\r\nThe reading of French novels (of which Woloda had brought a large store\r\nwith him from Moscow) was another of my amusements that summer. At that\r\nperiod Monte Cristo and Taine\'s works had just appeared, while I also\r\nrevelled in stories by Sue, Dumas, and Paul de Kock. Even their most\r\nunnatural personages and events were for me as real as actuality, and\r\nnot only was I incapable of suspecting an author of lying, but, in\r\nmy eyes, there existed no author at all. That is to say, the various\r\npersonages and events of a book paraded themselves before me on the\r\nprinted page as personages and events that were alive and real; and\r\nalthough I had never in my life met such characters as I there read\r\nabout, I never for a second doubted that I should one day do so. I\r\ndiscovered in myself all the passions described in every novel, as\r\nwell as a likeness to all the characters--heroes and villains\r\nimpartially--who figured therein, just as a suspicious man finds in\r\nhimself the signs of every possible disease when reading a book on\r\nmedicine. I took pleasure both in the cunning designs, the glowing\r\nsentiments, the tumultuous events, and the character-drawing of these\r\nworks. A good man was of the goodness, a bad man of the badness,\r\npossible only to the imagination of early youth. Likewise I found great\r\npleasure in the fact that it was all written in French, and that I could\r\nlay to heart the fine words which the fine heroes spoke, and recall them\r\nfor use some day when engaged in some noble deed. What quantities of\r\nFrench phrases I culled from those books for Kolpikoff\'s benefit if I\r\nshould ever meet him again, as well as for HERS, when at length I should\r\nfind her and reveal to her my love! For them both I prepared speeches\r\nwhich should overcome them as soon as spoken! Upon novels, too, I\r\nfounded new ideals of the moral qualities which I wished to attain.\r\nFirst of all, I wished to be NOBLE in all my deeds and conduct (I use\r\nthe French word noble instead of the Russian word blagorodni for the\r\nreason that the former has a different meaning to the latter--as\r\nthe Germans well understood when they adopted noble as nobel and\r\ndifferentiated it from ehrlich); next, to be strenuous; and lastly,\r\nto be what I was already inclined to be, namely, comme il faut. I even\r\ntried to approximate my appearance and bearing to that of the heroes who\r\npossessed these qualities. In particular I remember how in one of the\r\nhundred or so novels which I read that summer there was a very strenuous\r\nhero with heavy eyebrows, and that I so greatly wished to resemble him\r\n(I felt that I did so already from a moral point of view) that one\r\nday, when looking at my eyebrows in the glass, I conceived the idea of\r\nclipping them, in order to make them grow bushier. Unfortunately, after\r\nI had started to do so, I happened to clip one spot rather shorter than\r\nthe rest, and so had to level down the rest to it-with the result\r\nthat, to my horror, I beheld myself eyebrow-less, and anything but\r\npresentable. However, I comforted myself with the reflection that my\r\neyebrows would soon sprout again as bushy as my hero\'s, and was only\r\nperplexed to think how I could explain the circumstance to the household\r\nwhen they next perceived my eyebrow-less condition. Accordingly I\r\nborrowed some gunpowder from Woloda, rubbed it on my temples, and set\r\nit alight. The powder did not fire properly, but I succeeded in singeing\r\nmyself sufficiently to avert all suspicion of my pranks. And, indeed,\r\nafterwards, when I had forgotten all about my hero, my eyebrows grew\r\nagain, and much thicker than they had been before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI. "COMME IL FAUT"\r\n\r\nSEVERAL times in the course of this narrative I have hinted at an idea\r\ncorresponding to the above French heading, and now feel it incumbent\r\nupon me to devote a whole chapter to that idea, which was one of the\r\nmost ruinous, lying notions which ever became engrafted upon my life by\r\nmy upbringing and social milieu.\r\n\r\nThe human race may be divided into several categories--rich and poor,\r\ngood and bad, military and civilian, clever and stupid, and so forth,\r\nand so forth. Yet each man has his own favourite, fundamental system of\r\ndivision which he unconsciously uses to class each new person with\r\nwhom he meets. At the time of which I am speaking, my own favourite,\r\nfundamental system of division in this respect was into people "comme il\r\nfaut" and people "comme il ne faut pas"--the latter subdivided, again,\r\ninto people merely not "comme il faut" and the lower orders. People\r\n"comme il faut" I respected, and looked upon as worthy to consort with\r\nme as my equals; the second of the above categories I pretended merely\r\nto despise, but in reality hated, and nourished towards them a kind\r\nof feeling of offended personality; while the third category had no\r\nexistence at all, so far as I was concerned, since my contempt for\r\nthem was too complete. This "comme il faut"-ness of mine lay, first and\r\nforemost, in proficiency in French, especially conversational French. A\r\nperson who spoke that language badly at once aroused in me a feeling of\r\ndislike. "Why do you try to talk as we do when you haven\'t a notion how\r\nto do it?" I would seem to ask him with my most venomous and quizzing\r\nsmile. The second condition of "comme il faut"-ness was long nails\r\nthat were well kept and clean; the third, ability to bow, dance,\r\nand converse; the fourth--and a very important one--indifference to\r\neverything, and a constant air of refined, supercilious ennui. Moreover,\r\nthere were certain general signs which, I considered, enabled me\r\nto tell, without actually speaking to a man, the class to which he\r\nbelonged. Chief among these signs (the others being the fittings of his\r\nrooms, his gloves, his handwriting, his turn-out, and so forth) were his\r\nfeet. The relation of boots to trousers was sufficient to determine, in\r\nmy eyes, the social status of a man. Heelless boots with angular toes,\r\nwedded to narrow, unstrapped trouser-ends--these denoted the vulgarian.\r\nBoots with narrow, round toes and heels, accompanied either by tight\r\ntrousers strapped under the instep and fitting close to the leg or by\r\nwide trousers similarly strapped, but projecting in a peak over the\r\ntoe--these meant the man of mauvais genre; and so on, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious thing that I who lacked all ability to become "comme il\r\nfaut," should have assimilated the idea so completely as I did. Possibly\r\nit was the fact that it had cost me such enormous labour to acquire that\r\nbrought about its strenuous development in my mind. I hardly like to\r\nthink how much of the best and most valuable time of my first sixteen\r\nyears of existence I wasted upon its acquisition. Yet every one whom I\r\nimitated--Woloda, Dubkoff, and the majority of my acquaintances--seemed\r\nto acquire it easily. I watched them with envy, and silently toiled to\r\nbecome proficient in French, to bow gracefully and without looking at\r\nthe person whom I was saluting, to gain dexterity in small-talk and\r\ndancing, to cultivate indifference and ennui, and to keep my fingernails\r\nwell trimmed (though I frequently cut my finger-ends with the scissors\r\nin so doing). And all the time I felt that so much remained to be done\r\nif I was ever to attain my end! A room, a writing-table, an equipage\r\nI still found it impossible to arrange "comme il faut," however much\r\nI fought down my aversion to practical matters in my desire to become\r\nproficient. Yet everything seemed to arrange itself properly with other\r\npeople, just as though things could never have been otherwise! Once I\r\nremember asking Dubkoff, after much zealous and careful labouring at my\r\nfinger-nails (his own were extraordinarily good), whether his nails had\r\nalways been as now, or whether he had done anything to make them so: to\r\nwhich he replied that never within his recollection had he done anything\r\nto them, and that he could not imagine a gentleman\'s nails possibly\r\nbeing different. This answer incensed me greatly, for I had not yet\r\nlearnt that one of the chief conditions of "comme il faut"-ness was to\r\nhold one\'s tongue about the labour by which it had been acquired.\r\n"Comme il faut"-ness I looked upon as not only a great merit, a splendid\r\naccomplishment, an embodiment of all the perfection which must strive to\r\nattain, but as the one indispensable condition without which there could\r\nnever be happiness, nor glory, nor any good whatsoever in this world.\r\nEven the greatest artist or savant or benefactor of the human race would\r\nat that time have won from me no respect if he had not also been "comme\r\nil faut." A man possessed of "comme il faut"-ness stood higher than, and\r\nbeyond all possible equality with, such people, and might well leave it\r\nto them to paint pictures, to compose music, to write books, or to do\r\ngood. Possibly he might commend them for so doing (since why should not\r\nmerit be commended where-ever it be found?), but he could never stand\r\nON A LEVEL with them, seeing that he was "comme il faut" and they were\r\nnot--a quite final and sufficient reason. In fact, I actually believe\r\nthat, had we possessed a brother or a father or a mother who had not\r\nbeen "comme il faut," I should have declared it to be a great misfortune\r\nfor us, and announced that between myself and them there could never\r\nbe anything in common. Yet neither waste of the golden hours which\r\nI consumed in constantly endeavouring to observe the many arduous,\r\nunattainable conditions of "comme il faut"-ness (to the exclusion of any\r\nmore serious pursuit), nor dislike of and contempt for nine-tenths of\r\nthe human race, nor disregard of all the beauty that lay outside the\r\nnarrow circle of "comme il faut"-ness comprised the whole of the evil\r\nwhich the idea wrought in me. The chief evil of all lay in the notion\r\nacquired that a man need not strive to become a tchinovnik, [Official.]\r\na coachbuilder, a soldier, a savant, or anything useful, so long only\r\nas he was "comme il faut "--that by attaining the latter quality he had\r\ndone all that was demanded of him, and was even superior to most people.\r\n\r\nUsually, at a given period in youth, and after many errors and excesses,\r\nevery man recognises the necessity of his taking an active part in\r\nsocial life, and chooses some branch of labour to which to devote\r\nhimself. Only with the "comme il faut" man does this rarely happen.\r\nI have known, and know, very, very many people--old, proud,\r\nself-satisfied, and opinionated--who to the question (if it should ever\r\npresent itself to them in their world) "Who have you been, and what have\r\nyou ever done?" would be unable to reply otherwise than by saying,\r\n\r\n"Je fus un homme tres comme il faut,"\r\n\r\nSuch a fate was awaiting myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII. YOUTH\r\n\r\nDespite the confusion of ideas raging in my head, I was at least young,\r\ninnocent, and free that summer--consequently almost happy.\r\n\r\nSometimes I would rise quite early in the morning, for I slept on the\r\nopen verandah, and the bright, horizontal beams of the morning sun would\r\nwake me up. Dressing myself quickly, I would tuck a towel and a French\r\nnovel under my arm, and go off to bathe in the river in the shade of\r\na birch tree which stood half a verst from the house. Next, I would\r\nstretch myself on the grass and read--raising my eyes from time to time\r\nto look at the surface of the river where it showed blue in the shade\r\nof the trees, at the ripples caused by the first morning breeze, at the\r\nyellowing field of rye on the further bank, and at the bright-red sheen\r\nof the sunlight as it struck lower and lower down the white trunks of\r\nthe birch-trees which, ranged in ranks one behind the other, gradually\r\nreceded into the remote distance of the home park. At such moments I\r\nwould feel joyously conscious of having within me the same young, fresh\r\nforce of life as nature was everywhere exuding around me. When, however,\r\nthe sky was overcast with grey clouds of morning and I felt chilly after\r\nbathing, I would often start to walk at random through the fields and\r\nwoods, and joyously trail my wet boots in the fresh dew. All the while\r\nmy head would be filled with vivid dreams concerning the heroes of my\r\nlast-read novel, and I would keep picturing to myself some leader of an\r\narmy or some statesman or marvellously strong man or devoted lover or\r\nanother, and looking round me in, a nervous expectation that I should\r\nsuddenly descry HER somewhere near me, in a meadow or behind a tree.\r\nYet, whenever these rambles led me near peasants engaged at their work,\r\nall my ignoring of the existence of the "common people" did not\r\nprevent me from experiencing an involuntary, overpowering sensation of\r\nawkwardness; so that I always tried to avoid their seeing me. When the\r\nheat of the day had increased, it was not infrequently my habit--if the\r\nladies did not come out of doors for their morning tea--to go rambling\r\nthrough the orchard and kitchen-garden, and to pluck ripe fruit there.\r\nIndeed, this was an occupation which furnished me with one of my\r\ngreatest pleasures. Let any one go into an orchard, and dive into the\r\nmidst of a tall, thick, sprouting raspberry-bed. Above will be seen the\r\nclear, glowing sky, and, all around, the pale-green, prickly stems\r\nof raspberry-trees where they grow mingled together in a tangle of\r\nprofusion. At one\'s feet springs the dark-green nettle, with its slender\r\ncrown of flowers, while the broad-leaved burdock, with its bright-pink,\r\nprickly blossoms, overtops the raspberries (and even one\'s head) with\r\nits luxuriant masses, until, with the nettle, it almost meets the\r\npendent, pale-green branches of the old apple-trees where apples, round\r\nand lustrous as bone, but as yet unripe, are mellowing in the heat\r\nof the sun. Below, again, are seen young raspberry-shoots, twining\r\nthemselves around the partially withered, leafless parent plant,\r\nand stretching their tendrils towards the sunlight, with green,\r\nneedle-shaped blades of grass and young, dew-coated pods peering through\r\nlast year\'s leaves, and growing juicily green in the perennial shade, as\r\nthough they care nothing for the bright sunshine which is playing on the\r\nleaves of the apple-trees above them. In this density there is always\r\nmoisture--always a smell of confined, perpetual shade, of cobwebs,\r\nfallen apples (turning black where they roll on the mouldy sod),\r\nraspberries, and earwigs of the kind which impel one to reach hastily\r\nfor more fruit when one has inadvertently swallowed a member of that\r\ninsect tribe with the last berry. At every step one\'s movements keep\r\nflushing the sparrows which always make their home in these depths, and\r\none hears their fussy chirping and the beating of their tiny, fluttering\r\nwings against the stalks, and catches the low buzzing of a bumble bee\r\nsomewhere, and the sound of the gardener\'s footsteps (it is half-daft\r\nAkim) on the path as he hums his eternal sing-song to himself. Then one\r\nmutters under one\'s breath, "No! Neither he nor any one else shall\r\nfind me here!" yet still one goes on stripping juicy berries from their\r\nconical white pilasters, and cramming them into one\'s mouth. At length,\r\none\'s legs soaked to the knees as one repeats, over and over again, some\r\nrubbish which keeps running in one\'s head, and one\'s hands and nether\r\nlimbs (despite the protection of one\'s wet trousers) thoroughly stung\r\nwith the nettles, one comes to the conclusion that the sun\'s rays\r\nare beating too straight upon one\'s head for eating to be any longer\r\ndesirable, and, sinking down into the tangle of greenery, one remains\r\nthere--looking and listening, and continuing in mechanical fashion to\r\nstrip off one or two of the finer berries and swallow them.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\'clock--that is to say, when the ladies had taken their\r\nmorning tea and settled down to their occupations--I would repair to\r\nthe drawing-room. Near the first window, with its unbleached linen blind\r\nlowered to exclude the sunshine, but through the chink of which the sun\r\nkept throwing brilliant circles of light which hurt the eye to look at\r\nthem, there would be standing a screen, with flies quietly parading the\r\nwhiteness of its covering. Behind it would be seated Mimi, shaking her\r\nhead in an irritable manner, and constantly shifting from spot to spot\r\nto avoid the sunshine as at intervals it darted her from somewhere and\r\nlaid a streak of flame upon her hand or face. Through the other three\r\nwindows the sun would be throwing three squares of light, crossed with\r\nthe shadows of the window-frames, and where one of these patches marked\r\nthe unstained floor of the room there would be lying, in accordance with\r\ninvariable custom, Milka, with her ears pricked as she watched the flies\r\npromenading the lighted space. Seated on a settee, Katenka would be\r\nknitting or reading aloud as from time to time she gave her white\r\nsleeves (looking almost transparent in the sunshine) an impatient shake,\r\nor tossed her head with a frown to drive away some fly which had settled\r\nupon her thick auburn hair and was now buzzing in its tangles. Lubotshka\r\nwould either be walking up and down the room (her hands clasped behind\r\nher) until the moment should arrive when a movement would be made\r\ntowards the garden, or playing some piece of which every note had long\r\nbeen familiar to me. For my own part, I would sit down somewhere, and\r\nlisten to the music or the reading until such time as I myself should\r\nhave an opportunity of performing on the piano. After luncheon I would\r\ncondescend to take the girls out riding (since to go for a mere walk\r\nat that hour seemed to me unsuitable to my years and position in\r\nthe world), and these excursions of ours--in which I often took my\r\ncompanions through unaccustomed spots and dells--were very pleasant.\r\nIndeed, on some of these occasions I grew quite boyish, and the\r\ngirls would praise my riding and daring, and pretend that I was their\r\nprotector. In the evening, if we had no guests with us, tea (served in\r\nthe dim verandah), would be followed by a walk round the homestead with\r\nPapa, and then I would stretch myself on my usual settee, and read and\r\nponder as of old, as I listened to Katenka or Lubotshka playing. At\r\nother times, if I was alone in the drawing-room and Lubotshka was\r\nperforming some old-time air, I would find myself laying my book down,\r\nand gazing through the open doorway on to the balcony at the pendent,\r\nsinuous branches of the tall birch-trees where they stood overshadowed\r\nby the coming night, and at the clear sky where, if one looked at it\r\nintently enough, misty, yellowish spots would appear suddenly, and then\r\ndisappear again. Next, as I listened to the sounds of the music wafted\r\nfrom the salon, and to the creaking of gates and the voices of the\r\npeasant women when the cattle returned to the village, I would suddenly\r\nbethink me of Natalia Savishna and of Mamma and of Karl Ivanitch, and\r\nbecome momentarily sad. But in those days my spirit was so full of life\r\nand hope that such reminiscences only touched me in passing, and soon\r\nfled away again.\r\n\r\nAfter supper and (sometimes) a night stroll with some one in the garden\r\n(for I was afraid to walk down the dark avenues by myself), I would\r\nrepair to my solitary sleeping-place on the verandah--a proceeding\r\nwhich, despite the countless mosquitos which always devoured me,\r\nafforded me the greatest pleasure. If the moon was full, I frequently\r\nspent whole nights sitting up on my mattress, looking at the light and\r\nshade, listening to the sounds or stillness, dreaming of one matter\r\nand another (but more particularly of the poetic, voluptuous happiness\r\nwhich, in those days, I believed was to prove the acme of my felicity)\r\nand lamenting that until now it had only been given to me to IMAGINE\r\nthings. No sooner had every one dispersed, and I had seen lights pass\r\nfrom the drawing-room to the upper chambers (whence female voices would\r\npresently be heard, and the noise of windows opening and shutting), than\r\nI would depart to the verandah, and walk up and down there as I listened\r\nattentively to the sounds from the slumbering mansion. To this day,\r\nwhenever I feel any expectation (no matter how small and baseless) of\r\nrealising a fraction of some happiness of which I may be dreaming, I\r\nsomehow invariably fail to picture to myself what the imagined happiness\r\nis going to be like.\r\n\r\nAt the least sound of bare footsteps, or of a cough, or of a snore, or\r\nof the rattling of a window, or of the rustling of a dress, I would\r\nleap from my mattress, and stand furtively gazing and listening, thrown,\r\nwithout any visible cause, into extreme agitation. But the lights would\r\ndisappear from the upper rooms, the sounds of footsteps and talking give\r\nplace to snores, the watchman begin his nightly tapping with his stick,\r\nthe garden grow brighter and more mysterious as the streaks of light\r\nvanished from the windows, the last candle pass from the pantry to the\r\nhall (throwing a glimmer into the dewy garden as it did so), and the\r\nstooping figure of Foka (decked in a nightcap, and carrying the candle)\r\nbecome visible to my eyes as he went to his bed. Often I would find\r\na great and fearful pleasure in stealing over the grass, in the black\r\nshadow of the house, until I had reached the hall window, where I would\r\nstand listening with bated breath to the snoring of the boy, to Foka\'s\r\ngruntings (in the belief that no one heard him), and to the sound of his\r\nsenile voice as he drawled out the evening prayers. At length even his\r\ncandle would be extinguished, and the window slammed down, so that I\r\nwould find myself utterly alone; whereupon, glancing nervously from\r\nside to side, lest haply I should see the white woman standing near\r\na flower-bed or by my couch, I would run at full speed back to the\r\nverandah. Then, and only then, I would lie down with my face to\r\nthe garden, and, covering myself over, so far as possible, from the\r\nmosquitos and bats, fall to gazing in front of me as I listened to the\r\nsounds of the night and dreamed of love and happiness.\r\n\r\nAt such times everything would take on for me a different meaning. The\r\nlook of the old birch trees, with the one side of their curling branches\r\nshowing bright against the moonlit sky, and the other darkening the\r\nbushes and carriage-drive with their black shadows; the calm, rich\r\nglitter of the pond, ever swelling like a sound; the moonlit sparkle\r\nof the dewdrops on the flowers in front of the verandah; the graceful\r\nshadows of those flowers where they lay thrown upon the grey stonework;\r\nthe cry of a quail on the far side of the pond; the voice of some one\r\nwalking on the high road; the quiet, scarcely audible scrunching of two\r\nold birch trees against one another; the humming of a mosquito at my car\r\nunder the coverlet; the fall of an apple as it caught against a\r\nbranch and rustled among the dry leaves; the leapings of frogs as they\r\napproached almost to the verandah-steps and sat with the moon shining\r\nmysteriously on their green backs--all these things took on for me a\r\nstrange significance--a significance of exceeding beauty and of infinite\r\nlove. Before me would rise SHE, with long black tresses and a high bust,\r\nbut always mournful in her fairness, with bare hands and voluptuous\r\narms. She loved me, and for one moment of her love I would sacrifice\r\nmy whole life!--But the moon would go on rising higher and higher, and\r\nshining brighter and brighter, in the heavens; the rich sparkle of the\r\npond would swell like a sound, and become ever more and more brilliant,\r\nwhile the shadows would grow blacker and blacker, and the sheen of the\r\nmoon more and more transparent: until, as I looked at and listened to\r\nall this, something would say to me that SHE with the bare hands and\r\nvoluptuous arms did not represent ALL happiness, that love for her\r\ndid not represent ALL good; so that, the more I gazed at the full,\r\nhigh-riding moon, the higher would true beauty and goodness appear to me\r\nto lie, and the purer and purer they would seem--the nearer and nearer\r\nto Him who is the source of all beauty and all goodness. And tears of a\r\nsort of unsatisfied, yet tumultuous, joy would fill my eyes.\r\n\r\nAlways, too, I was alone; yet always, too, it seemed to me that,\r\nalthough great, mysterious Nature could draw the shining disc of the\r\nmoon to herself, and somehow hold in some high, indefinite place the\r\npale-blue sky, and be everywhere around me, and fill of herself the\r\ninfinity of space, while I was but a lowly worm, already defiled with\r\nthe poor, petty passions of humanity--always it seemed to me that,\r\nnevertheless, both Nature and the moon and I were one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII. OUR NEIGHBOURS\r\n\r\nON the first day after our arrival, I had been greatly astonished that\r\nPapa should speak of our neighbours, the Epifanovs, as "nice people,"\r\nand still more so that he should go to call upon them. The fact was that\r\nwe had long been at law over some land with this family. When a child,\r\nI had more than once heard Papa raging over the litigation, abusing\r\nthe Epifanovs, and warning people (so I understood him) against them.\r\nLikewise, I had heard Jakoff speak of them as "our enemies" and "black\r\npeople" and could remember Mamma requesting that their names should\r\nnever be mentioned in her presence, nor, indeed, in the house at all.\r\n\r\nFrom these data I, as a child, had arrived at the clear and assured\r\nconviction that the Epifanovs were foemen of ours who would at any time\r\nstab or strangle both Papa and his sons if they should ever come across\r\nthem, as well as that they were "black people", in the literal sense of\r\nthe term. Consequently, when, in the year that Mamma died, I chanced to\r\ncatch sight of Avdotia ("La Belle Flamande") on the occasion of a visit\r\nwhich she paid to my mother, I found it hard to believe that she did\r\nnot come of a family of negroes. All the same, I had the lowest possible\r\nopinion of the family, and, for all that we saw much of them that\r\nsummer, continued to be strongly prejudiced against them. As a matter\r\nof fact, their household only consisted of the mother (a widow of fifty,\r\nbut a very well-preserved, cheery old woman), a beautiful daughter named\r\nAvdotia, and a son, Peter, who was a stammerer, unmarried, and of very\r\nserious disposition.\r\n\r\nFor the last twenty years before her husband\'s death, Madame Epifanov\r\nhad lived apart from him--sometimes in St. Petersburg, where she had\r\nrelatives, but more frequently at her village of Mitishtchi, which\r\nstood some three versts from ours. Yet the neighbourhood had taken\r\nto circulating such horrible tales concerning her mode of life that\r\nMessalina was, by comparison, a blameless child: which was why my mother\r\nhad requested her name never to be mentioned. As a matter of fact,\r\nnot one-tenth part of the most cruel of all gossip--the gossip of\r\ncountry-houses--is worthy of credence; and although, when I first made\r\nMadame\'s acquaintance, she had living with her in the house a clerk\r\nnamed Mitusha, who had been promoted from a serf, and who, curled,\r\npomaded, and dressed in a frockcoat of Circassian pattern, always stood\r\nbehind his mistress\'s chair at luncheon, while from time to time she\r\ninvited her guests to admire his handsome eyes and mouth, there was\r\nnothing for gossip to take hold of. I believe, too, that since the\r\ntime--ten years earlier--when she had recalled her dutiful son Peter\r\nfrom the service, she had wholly changed her mode of living. It seems\r\nher property had never been a large one--merely a hundred souls or\r\nso--[This refers, of course, to the days of serfdom.]and that during her\r\nprevious life of gaiety she had spent a great deal. Consequently,\r\nwhen, some ten years ago, those portions of the property which had been\r\nmortgaged and re-mortgaged had been foreclosed upon and compulsorily\r\nsold by auction, she had come to the conclusion that all these\r\nunpleasant details of distress upon and valuation of her property had\r\nbeen due not so much to failure to pay the interest as to the fact that\r\nshe was a woman: wherefore she had written to her son (then serving with\r\nhis regiment) to come and save his mother from her embarrassments, and\r\nhe, like a dutiful son--conceiving that his first duty was to comfort\r\nhis mother in her old age--had straightway resigned his commission (for\r\nall that he had been doing well in his profession, and was hoping soon\r\nto become independent), and had come to join her in the country.\r\n\r\nDespite his plain face, uncouth demeanour, and fault of stuttering,\r\nPeter was a man of unswerving principles and of the most extraordinary\r\ngood sense. Somehow--by small borrowings, sundry strokes of business,\r\npetitions for grace, and promises to repay--he contrived to carry on the\r\nproperty, and, making himself overseer, donned his father\'s greatcoat\r\n(still preserved in a drawer), dispensed with horses and carriages,\r\ndiscouraged guests from calling at Mitishtchi, fashioned his own\r\nsleighs, increased his arable land and curtailed that of the serfs,\r\nfelled his own timber, sold his produce in person, and saw to matters\r\ngenerally. Indeed, he swore, and kept his oath, that, until all\r\noutstanding debts were paid, he would never wear any clothes than his\r\nfather\'s greatcoat and a corduroy jacket which he had made for himself,\r\nnor yet ride in aught but a country waggon, drawn by peasants\' horses.\r\nThis stoical mode of life he sought to apply also to his family, so far\r\nas the sympathetic respect which he conceived to be his mother\'s due\r\nwould allow of; so that, although, in the drawing-room, he would show\r\nher only stuttering servility, and fulfil all her wishes, and blame any\r\none who did not do precisely as she bid them, in his study or his\r\noffice he would overhaul the cook if she had served up so much as a\r\nduck without his orders, or any one responsible for sending a serf (even\r\nthough at Madame\'s own bidding) to inquire after a neighbour\'s health\r\nor for despatching the peasant girls into the wood to gather wild\r\nraspberries instead of setting them to weed the kitchen-garden.\r\n\r\nWithin four years every debt had been repaid, and Peter had gone to\r\nMoscow and returned thence in a new jacket and tarantass. [A two-wheeled\r\ncarriage.] Yet, despite this flourishing position of affairs, he still\r\npreserved the stoical tendencies in which, to tell the truth, he took\r\na certain vague pride before his family and strangers, since he would\r\nfrequently say with a stutter: "Any one who REALLY wishes to see me\r\nwill be glad to see me even in my dressing-gown, and to eat nothing but\r\nshtchi [Cabbage-soup.] and kasha [Buckwheat gruel.] at my table." "That\r\nis what I eat myself," he would add. In his every word and movement\r\nspoke pride based upon a consciousness of having sacrificed himself for\r\nhis mother and redeemed the property, as well as contempt for any one\r\nwho had not done something of the same kind.\r\n\r\nThe mother and daughter were altogether different characters from Peter,\r\nas well as altogether different from one another. The former was one of\r\nthe most agreeable, uniformly good-tempered, and cheerful women whom one\r\ncould possibly meet. Anything attractive and genuinely happy delighted\r\nher. Even the faculty of being pleased with the sight of young people\r\nenjoying themselves (it is only in the best-natured of elderly folk that\r\none meets with that TRAIT) she possessed to the full. On the other\r\nhand, her daughter was of a grave turn of mind. Rather, she was of that\r\npeculiarly careless, absent-minded, gratuitously distant bearing which\r\ncommonly distinguishes unmarried beauties. Whenever she tried to be gay,\r\nher gaiety somehow seemed to be unnatural to her, so that she always\r\nappeared to be laughing either at herself or at the persons to whom she\r\nwas speaking or at the world in general--a thing which, possibly, she\r\nhad no real intention of doing. Often I asked myself in astonishment\r\nwhat she could mean when she said something like, "Yes, I know how\r\nterribly good-looking I am," or, "Of course every one is in love with\r\nme," and so forth. Her mother was a person always busy, since she had\r\na passion for housekeeping, gardening, flowers, canaries, and pretty\r\ntrinkets. Her rooms and garden, it is true, were small and poorly\r\nfitted-up, yet everything in them was so neat and methodical, and bore\r\nsuch a general air of that gentle gaiety which one hears expressed in\r\na waltz or polka, that the word "toy" by which guests often expressed\r\ntheir praise of it all exactly suited her surroundings. She herself\r\nwas a "toy"--being petite, slender, fresh-coloured, small, and\r\npretty-handed, and invariably gay and well-dressed. The only fault in\r\nher was that a slight over-prominence of the dark-blue veins on her\r\nlittle hands rather marred the general effect of her appearance. On the\r\nother hand, her daughter scarcely ever did anything at all. Not only had\r\nshe no love for trifling with flowers and trinkets, but she neglected\r\nher personal exterior, and only troubled to dress herself well when\r\nguests happened to call. Yet, on returning to the room in society\r\ncostume, she always looked extremely handsome--save for that cold,\r\nuniform expression of eyes and smile which is common to all beauties. In\r\nfact, her strictly regular, beautiful face and symmetrical figure always\r\nseemed to be saying to you, "Yes, you may look at me."\r\n\r\nAt the same time, for all the mother\'s liveliness of disposition and the\r\ndaughter\'s air of indifference and abstraction, something told one that\r\nthe former was incapable of feeling affection for anything that was\r\nnot pretty and gay, but that Avdotia, on the contrary, was one of those\r\nnatures which, once they love, are willing to sacrifice their whole life\r\nfor the man they adore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV. MY FATHER\'S SECOND MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nMY father was forty-eight when he took as his second wife Avdotia\r\nVassilievna Epifanov.\r\n\r\nI suspect that when, that spring, he had departed for the country with\r\nthe girls, he had been in that communicatively happy, sociable mood in\r\nwhich gamblers usually find themselves who have retired from play after\r\nwinning large stakes. He had felt that he still had a fortune left to\r\nhim which, so long as he did not squander it on gaming, might be\r\nused for our advancement in life. Moreover, it was springtime, he was\r\nunexpectedly well supplied with ready money, he was alone, and he had\r\nnothing to do. As he conversed with Jakoff on various matters, and\r\nremembered both the interminable suit with the Epifanovs and Avdotia\'s\r\nbeauty (it was a long while since he had seen her), I can imagine him\r\nsaying: "How do you think we ought to act in this suit, Jakoff? My idea\r\nis simply to let the cursed land go. Eh? What do you think about it?"\r\nI can imagine, too, how, thus interrogated, Jakoff twirled his fingers\r\nbehind his back in a deprecatory sort of way, and proceeded to argue\r\nthat it all the same, "Peter Alexandritch, we are in the right."\r\nNevertheless, I further conjecture, Papa ordered the dogcart to be got\r\nready, put on his fashionable olive-coloured driving-coat, brushed up\r\nthe remnants of his hair, sprinkled his clothes with scent, and, greatly\r\npleased to think that he was acting a la seignior (as well as, even\r\nmore, revelling in the prospect of soon seeing a pretty woman), drove\r\noff to visit his neighbours.\r\n\r\nI can imagine, too, that when the flustered housemaid ran to inform\r\nPeter Vassilievitch that Monsieur Irtenieff himself had called, Peter\r\nanswered angrily, "Well, what has he come for?" and, stepping softly\r\nabout the house, first went into his study to put on his old soiled\r\njacket, and then sent down word to the cook that on no account\r\nwhatever--no, not even if she were ordered to do so by the mistress\r\nherself--was she to add anything to luncheon.\r\n\r\nSince, later, I often saw Papa with Peter, I can form a very good idea\r\nof this first interview between them. I can imagine that, despite Papa\'s\r\nproposal to end the suit in a peaceful manner, Peter was morose and\r\nresentful at the thought of having sacrificed his career to his mother,\r\nand at Papa having done nothing of the kind--a by no means surprising\r\ncircumstance, Peter probably said to himself. Next, I can see Papa\r\ntaking no notice of this ill-humour, but cracking quips and jests, while\r\nPeter gradually found himself forced to treat him as a humorist with\r\nwhom he felt offended one moment and inclined to be reconciled the next.\r\nIndeed, with his instinct for making fun of everything, Papa often used\r\nto address Peter as "Colonel;" and though I can remember Peter once\r\nreplying, with an unusually violent stutter and his face scarlet\r\nwith indignation, that he had never been a c-c-colonel, but only a\r\nl-l-lieutenant, Papa called him "Colonel" again before another five\r\nminutes were out.\r\n\r\nLubotshka told me that, up to the time of Woloda\'s and my arrival from\r\nMoscow, there had been daily meetings with the Epifanovs, and that\r\nthings had been very lively, since Papa, who had a genius for arranging,\r\neverything with a touch of originality and wit, as well as in a simple\r\nand refined manner, had devised shooting and fishing parties and\r\nfireworks for the Epifanovs\' benefit. All these festivities--so said\r\nLubotshka--would have gone off splendidly but for the intolerable Peter,\r\nwho had spoilt everything by his puffing and stuttering. After our\r\ncoming, however, the Epifanovs only visited us twice, and we went once\r\nto their house, while after St. Peter\'s Day (on which, it being Papa\'s\r\nnameday, the Epifanovs called upon us in common with a crowd of other\r\nguests) our relations with that family came entirely to an end, and, in\r\nfuture, only Papa went to see them.\r\n\r\nDuring the brief period when I had opportunities of seeing Papa and\r\nDunetchka (as her mother called Avdotia) together, this is what I\r\nremarked about them. Papa remained unceasingly in the same buoyant mood\r\nas had so greatly struck me on the day after our arrival. So gay and\r\nyouthful and full of life and happy did he seem that the beams of\r\nhis felicity extended themselves to all around him, and involuntarily\r\ncommunicated to them a similar frame of mind. He never stirred from\r\nAvdotia\'s side so long as she was in the room, but either kept on plying\r\nher with sugary-sweet compliments which made me feel ashamed for him\r\nor, with his gaze fixed upon her with an air at once passionate and\r\ncomplacent, sat hitching his shoulder and coughing as from time to time\r\nhe smiled and whispered something in her ear. Yet throughout he wore\r\nthe same expression of raillery as was peculiar to him even in the most\r\nserious matters.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, Avdotia herself seemed to catch the infection of the\r\nhappiness which sparkled at this period in Papa\'s large blue eyes; yet\r\nthere were moments also when she would be seized with such a fit of\r\nshyness that I, who knew the feeling well, was full of sympathy and\r\ncompassion as I regarded her embarrassment. At moments of this kind she\r\nseemed to be afraid of every glance and every movement--to be supposing\r\nthat every one was looking at her, every one thinking of no one but\r\nher, and that unfavourably. She would glance timidly from one person to\r\nanother, the colour coming and going in her cheeks, and then begin\r\nto talk loudly and defiantly, but, for the most part, nonsense; until\r\npresently, realising this, and supposing that Papa and every one else\r\nhad heard her, she would blush more painfully than ever. Yet Papa never\r\nnoticed her nonsense, for he was too much taken up with coughing and\r\nwith gazing at her with his look of happy, triumphant devotion. I\r\nnoticed, too, that, although these fits of shyness attacked Avdotia,\r\nwithout any visible cause, they not infrequently ensued upon Papa\'s\r\nmention of one or another young and beautiful woman. Frequent\r\ntransitions from depression to that strange, awkward gaiety of hers\r\nto which I have referred before the repetition of favourite words and\r\nturns of speech of Papa\'s; the continuation of discussions with others\r\nwhich Papa had already begun--all these things, if my father had not\r\nbeen the principal actor in the matter and I had been a little older,\r\nwould have explained to me the relations subsisting between him and\r\nAvdotia. At the time, however, I never surmised them--no, not even when\r\nPapa received from her brother Peter a letter which so upset him that\r\nnot again until the end of August did he go to call upon the Epifanovs\'.\r\nThen, however, he began his visits once more, and ended by informing\r\nus, on the day before Woloda and I were to return to Moscow, that he was\r\nabout to take Avdotia Vassilievna Epifanov to be his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV. HOW WE RECEIVED THE NEWS\r\n\r\nYet, even on the eve of the official announcement, every one had learnt\r\nof the matter, and was discussing it. Mimi never left her room that\r\nday, and wept copiously. Katenka kept her company, and only came out\r\nfor luncheon, with a grieved expression on her face which was manifestly\r\nborrowed from her mother. Lubotshka, on the contrary, was very cheerful,\r\nand told us after luncheon that she knew of a splendid secret which she\r\nwas going to tell no one.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing so splendid about your secret," said Woloda, who did\r\nnot in the least share her satisfaction. "If you were capable of any\r\nserious thought at all, you would understand that it is a very bad\r\nlookout for us."\r\n\r\nLubotshka stared at him in amazement, and said no more. After the meal\r\nwas over, Woloda made a feint of taking me by the arm, and then, fearing\r\nthat this would seem too much like "affection," nudged me gently by the\r\nelbow, and beckoned me towards the salon.\r\n\r\n"You know, I suppose, what the secret is of which Lubotshka was\r\nspeaking?" he said when he was sure that we were alone. It was seldom\r\nthat he and I spoke together in confidence: with the result that,\r\nwhenever it came about, we felt a kind of awkwardness in one another\'s\r\npresence, and "boys began to jump about" in our eyes, as Woloda\r\nexpressed it. On the present occasion, however, he answered the\r\nexcitement in my eyes with a grave, fixed look which said: "You need not\r\nbe surprised, for we are brothers, and we have to consider an important\r\nfamily matter." I understood him, and he went on:\r\n\r\n"You know, I suppose, that Papa is going to marry Avdotia Epifanov?"\r\n\r\nI nodded, for I had already heard so. "Well, it is not a good thing,"\r\ncontinued Woloda.\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"Why?" he repeated irritably. "Because it will be so pleasant, won\'t\r\nit, to have this stuttering \'colonel\' and all his family for relations!\r\nCertainly she seems nice enough, as yet; but who knows what she will\r\nturn out to be later? It won\'t matter much to you or myself, but\r\nLubotshka will soon be making her debut, and it will hardly be nice\r\nfor her to have such a \'belle mere\' as this--a woman who speaks French\r\nbadly, and has no manners to teach her."\r\n\r\nAlthough it seemed odd to hear Woloda criticising Papa\'s choice so\r\ncoolly, I felt that he was right.\r\n\r\n"Why is he marrying her?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is a hole-and-corner business, and God only knows why,"\r\nhe answered. "All I know is that her brother, Peter, tried to make\r\nconditions about the marriage, and that, although at first Papa would\r\nnot hear of them, he afterwards took some fancy or knight-errantry or\r\nanother into his head. But, as I say, it is a hole-and-corner business.\r\nI am only just beginning to understand my father "--the fact that Woloda\r\ncalled Papa "my father" instead of "Papa" somehow hurt me--"and though I\r\ncan see that he is kind and clever, he is irresponsible and frivolous to\r\na degree that--Well, the whole thing is astonishing. He cannot so much\r\nas look upon a woman calmly. You yourself know how he falls in love with\r\nevery one that he meets. You know it, and so does Mimi."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" I said.\r\n\r\n"What I say. Not long ago I learnt that he used to be in love with Mimi\r\nherself when he was a young man, and that he used to send her poetry,\r\nand that there really was something between them. Mimi is heart-sore\r\nabout it to this day"--and Woloda burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" I cried in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"But the principal thing at this moment," went on Woloda, becoming\r\nserious again, and relapsing into French, "is to think how delighted all\r\nour relations will be with this marriage! Why, she will probably have\r\nchildren!"\r\n\r\nWoloda\'s prudence and forethought struck me so forcibly that I had no\r\nanswer to make. Just at this moment Lubotshka approached us.\r\n\r\n"So you know?" she said with a joyful face.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Woloda. "Still, I am surprised at you, Lubotshka. You are no\r\nlonger a baby in long clothes. Why should you be so pleased because Papa\r\nis going to marry a piece of trash?"\r\n\r\nAt this Lubotshka\'s face fell, and she became serious.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Woloda!" she exclaimed. "Why \'a piece of trash\' indeed? How can you\r\ndare to speak of Avdotia like that? If Papa is going to marry her she\r\ncannot be \'trash.\'"\r\n\r\n"No, not trash, so to speak, but--"\r\n\r\n"No \'buts\' at all!" interrupted Lubotshka, flaring up. "You have never\r\nheard me call the girl whom you are in love with \'trash!\' How, then, can\r\nyou speak so of Papa and a respectable woman? Although you are my elder\r\nbrother, I won\'t allow you to speak like that! You ought not to!"\r\n\r\n"Mayn\'t I even express an opinion about--"\r\n\r\n"No, you mayn\'t!" repeated Lubotshka. "No one ought to criticise such a\r\nfather as ours. Mimi has the right to, but not you, however much you may\r\nbe the eldest brother."\r\n\r\n"Oh you don\'t understand anything," said Woloda contemptuously. "Try\r\nand do so. How can it be a good thing that a \'Dunetchka\' of an Epifanov\r\nshould take the place of our dead Mamma?"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Lubotshka was silent. Then the tears suddenly came into her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"I knew that you were conceited, but I never thought that you could be\r\ncruel," she said, and left us.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" said Woloda, pulling a serio-comic face and make-believe,\r\nstupid eyes. "That\'s what comes of arguing with them." Evidently he felt\r\nthat he was at fault in having so far forgot himself as to descend to\r\ndiscuss matters at all with Lubotshka.\r\n\r\nNext day the weather was bad, and neither Papa nor the ladies had come\r\ndown to morning tea when I entered the drawing-room. There had been\r\ncold rain in the night, and remnants of the clouds from which it had\r\ndescended were still scudding across the sky, with the sun\'s luminous\r\ndisc (not yet risen to any great height) showing faintly through\r\nthem. It was a windy, damp, grey morning. The door into the garden was\r\nstanding open, and pools left by the night\'s rain were drying on the\r\ndamp-blackened flags of the terrace. The open door was swinging on its\r\niron hinges in the wind, and all the paths looked wet and muddy. The old\r\nbirch trees with their naked white branches, the bushes, the turf,\r\nthe nettles, the currant-trees, the elders with the pale side of their\r\nleaves turned upwards--all were dashing themselves about, and looking as\r\nthough they were trying to wrench themselves free from their roots. From\r\nthe avenue of lime-trees showers of round, yellow leaves were flying\r\nthrough the air in tossing, eddying circles, and strewing the wet\r\nroad and soaked aftermath of the hayfield with a clammy carpet. At the\r\nmoment, my thoughts were wholly taken up with my father\'s approaching\r\nmarriage and with the point of view from which Woloda regarded it. The\r\nfuture seemed to me to bode no good for any of us. I felt distressed to\r\nthink that a woman who was not only a stranger but young should be going\r\nto associate with us in so many relations of life, without having any\r\nright to do so--nay, that this young woman was going to usurp the place\r\nof our dead mother. I felt depressed, and kept thinking more and more\r\nthat my father was to blame in the matter. Presently I heard his voice\r\nand Woloda\'s speaking together in the pantry, and, not wishing to meet\r\nPapa just then, had just left the room when I was pursued by Lubotshka,\r\nwho said that Papa wanted to see me.\r\n\r\nHe was standing in the drawing-room, with his hand resting on the piano,\r\nand was gazing in my direction with an air at once grave and impatient.\r\nHis face no longer wore the youthful, gay expression which had struck me\r\nfor so long, but, on the contrary, looked sad. Woloda was walking about\r\nthe room with a pipe in his hand. I approached my father, and bade him\r\ngood morning.\r\n\r\n"Well, my children," he said firmly, with a lift of his head and in\r\nthe peculiarly hurried manner of one who wishes to announce something\r\nobviously unwelcome, but no longer admitting of reconsideration, "you\r\nknow, I suppose, that I am going to marry Avdotia Epifanov." He paused\r\na moment. "Hitherto I had had no desire for any one to succeed your\r\nmother, but"--and again he paused--"it-it is evidently my fate.\r\nDunetchka is an excellent, kind girl, and no longer in her first youth.\r\nI hope, therefore, my children, that you will like her, and she, I know,\r\nwill be sincerely fond of you, for she is a good woman. And now," he\r\nwent on, addressing himself more particularly to Woloda and myself, and\r\nhaving the appearance of speaking hurriedly in order to prevent us from\r\ninterrupting him, "it is time for you to depart, while I myself am\r\ngoing to stay here until the New Year, and then to follow you to Moscow\r\nwith"--again he hesitated a moment--"my wife and Lubotshka." It hurt me\r\nto see my father standing as though abashed and at fault before us, so\r\nI moved a little nearer him, but Woloda only went on walking about the\r\nroom with his head down, and smoking.\r\n\r\n"So, my children, that is what your old father has planned to do,"\r\nconcluded Papa--reddening, coughing, and offering Woloda and myself his\r\nhands. Tears were in his eyes as he said this, and I noticed, too, that\r\nthe hand which he was holding out to Woloda (who at that moment chanced\r\nto be at the other end of the room) was shaking slightly. The sight of\r\nthat shaking hand gave me an unpleasant shock, for I remembered that\r\nPapa had served in 1812, and had been, as every one knew, a brave\r\nofficer. Seizing the great veiny hand, I covered it with kisses, and\r\nhe squeezed mine hard in return. Then, with a sob amid his tears, he\r\nsuddenly threw his arms around Lubotshka\'s dark head, and kissed her\r\nagain and again on the eyes. Woloda pretended that he had dropped his\r\npipe, and, bending down, wiped his eyes furtively with the back of his\r\nhand. Then, endeavouring to escape notice, he left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI. THE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nTHE wedding was to take place in two weeks\' time, but, as our lectures\r\nhad begun already, Woloda and myself were forced to return to Moscow at\r\nthe beginning of September. The Nechludoffs had also returned from the\r\ncountry, and Dimitri (with whom, on parting, I had made an agreement\r\nthat we should correspond frequently with the result, of course, that we\r\nhad never once written to one another) came to see us immediately\r\nafter our arrival, and arranged to escort me to my first lecture on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful sunny day. No sooner had I entered the auditorium\r\nthan I felt my personality entirely disappear amid the swarm of\r\nlight-hearted youths who were seething tumultuously through every\r\ndoorway and corridor under the influence of the sunlight pouring through\r\nthe great windows. I found the sense of being a member of this huge\r\ncommunity very pleasing, yet there were few among the throng whom I\r\nknew, and that only on terms of a nod and a "How do you do, Irtenieff?"\r\n\r\nAll around me men were shaking hands and chatting together--from every\r\nside came expressions of friendship, laughter, jests, and badinage.\r\nEverywhere I could feel the tie which bound this youthful society in\r\none, and everywhere, too, I could feel that it left me out. Yet this\r\nimpression lasted for a moment only, and was succeeded, together with\r\nthe vexation which it had caused, by the idea that it was best that\r\nI should not belong to that society, but keep to my own circle of\r\ngentlemen; wherefore I proceeded to seat myself upon the third bench,\r\nwith, as neighbours, Count B., Baron Z., the Prince R., Iwin, and\r\nsome other young men of the same class with none of whom, however, was\r\nacquainted save with Iwin and Count B. Yet the look which these young\r\ngentlemen threw at me at once made me feel that I was not of their set,\r\nand I turned to observe what was going on around me. Semenoff, with\r\ngrey, matted hair, white teeth, and tunic flying open, was seated a\r\nlittle distance off, and leaning forward on his elbows as he nibbled\r\na pen, while the gymnasium student who had come out first in the\r\nexaminations had established himself on the front bench, and, with a\r\nblack stock coming half-way up his cheek, was toying with the silver\r\nwatch-chain which adorned his satin waistcoat. On a bench in a raised\r\npart of the hall I could descry Ikonin (evidently he had contrived to\r\nenter the University somehow!), and hear him fussily proclaiming, in all\r\nthe glory of blue piped trousers which completely hid his boots, that he\r\nwas now seated on Parnassus. Ilinka--who had surprised me by giving me a\r\nbow not only cold, but supercilious, as though to remind me that here we\r\nwere all equals--was just in front of me, with his legs resting in free\r\nand easy style on another bench (a hit, somehow I thought, at myself),\r\nand conversing with a student as he threw occasional glances in my\r\ndirection. Iwin\'s set by my side were talking in French, yet every word\r\nwhich I overheard of their conversation seemed to me both stupid and\r\nincorrect ("Ce n\'est pas francais," I thought to myself), while all\r\nthe attitudes, utterances, and doings of Semenoff, Ilinka, and the rest\r\nstruck me as uniformly coarse, ungentlemanly, and "comme il ne faut\r\npas."\r\n\r\nThus, attached to no particular set, I felt isolated and unable to make\r\nfriends, and so grew resentful. One of the students on the bench in\r\nfront of me kept biting his nails, which were raw to the quick already,\r\nand this so disgusted me that I edged away from him. In short, I\r\nremember finding my first day a most depressing affair.\r\n\r\nWhen the professor entered, and there was a general stir and a cessation\r\nof chatter, I remember throwing a scornful glance at him, as also\r\nthat he began his discourse with a sentence which I thought devoid of\r\nmeaning. I had expected the lecture to be, from first to last, so clever\r\nthat not a word ought to be taken from or added to it. Disappointed in\r\nthis, I at once proceeded to draw beneath the heading "First Lecture"\r\nwith which I had adorned my beautifully-bound notebook no less than\r\neighteen faces in profile, joined together in a sort of chaplet, and\r\nonly occasionally moved my hand along the page in order to give the\r\nprofessor (who, I felt sure, must be greatly interested in me) the\r\nimpression that I was writing something. In fact, at this very first\r\nlecture I came to the decision which I maintained to the end of my\r\ncourse, namely, that it was unnecessary, and even stupid, to take down\r\nevery word said by every professor.\r\n\r\nAt subsequent lectures, however, I did not feel my isolation so\r\nstrongly, since I made several acquaintances and got into the way of\r\nshaking hands and entering into conversation. Yet for some reason or\r\nanother no real intimacy ever sprang up between us, and I often found\r\nmyself depressed and only feigning cheerfulness. With the set which\r\ncomprised Iwin and "the aristocrats," as they were generally known, I\r\ncould not make any headway at all, for, as I now remember, I was always\r\nshy and churlish to them, and nodded to them only when they nodded to\r\nme; so that they had little inducement to desire my acquaintance. With\r\nmost of the other students, however, this arose from quite a different\r\ncause. As soon as ever I discerned friendliness on the part of a\r\ncomrade, I at once gave him to understand that I went to luncheon with\r\nPrince Ivan Ivanovitch and kept my own drozhki. All this I said merely\r\nto show myself in the most favourable light in his eyes, and to induce\r\nhim to like me all the more; yet almost invariably the only result of\r\nmy communicating to him the intelligence concerning the drozhki and my\r\nrelationship to Prince Ivan Ivanovitch was that, to my astonishment, he\r\nat once adopted a cold and haughty bearing towards me.\r\n\r\nAmong us we had a Crown student named Operoff--a very modest,\r\nindustrious, and clever young fellow, who always offered one his hand\r\nlike a slab of wood (that is to say, without closing his fingers or\r\nmaking the slightest movement with them); with the result that his\r\ncomrades often did the same to him in jest, and called it the "deal\r\nboard" way of shaking hands. He and I nearly always sat next to one\r\nanother, and discussed matters generally. In particular he pleased me\r\nwith the freedom with which he would criticise the professors as he\r\npointed out to me with great clearness and acumen the merits or demerits\r\nof their respective ways of teaching and made occasional fun of them.\r\nSuch remarks I found exceedingly striking and diverting when uttered\r\nin his quiet, mincing voice. Nevertheless he never let a lecture\r\npass without taking careful notes of it in his fine handwriting,\r\nand eventually we decided to join forces, and to do our preparation\r\ntogether. Things had progressed to the point of his always looking\r\npleased when I took my usual seat beside him when, unfortunately, I one\r\nday found it necessary to inform him that, before her death, my mother\r\nhad besought my father never to allow us to enter for a government\r\nscholarship, as well as that I myself considered Crown students, no\r\nmatter how clever, to be-"well, they are not GENTLEMEN," I concluded,\r\nthough beginning to flounder a little and grow red. At the moment\r\nOperoff said nothing, but at subsequent lectures he ceased to greet me\r\nor to offer me his board-like hand, and never attempted to talk to me,\r\nbut, as soon as ever I sat down, he would lean his head upon his arm,\r\nand purport to be absorbed in his notebooks. I was surprised at this\r\nsudden coolness, but looked upon it as infra dig, "pour un jeune\r\nhomme de bonne maison" to curry favour with a mere Crown student of\r\nan Operoff, and so left him severely alone--though I confess that his\r\naloofness hurt my feelings. On one occasion I arrived before him,\r\nand, since the lecture was to be delivered by a popular professor whom\r\nstudents came to hear who did not usually attend such functions, I found\r\nalmost every seat occupied. Accordingly I secured Operoff\'s place for\r\nmyself by spreading my notebooks on the desk before it; after which I\r\nleft the room again for a moment. When I returned I perceived that my\r\nparaphernalia had been relegated to the bench behind, and the place\r\ntaken by Operoff himself. I remarked to him that I had already secured\r\nit by placing my notebooks there.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about that," he replied sharply, yet without looking up\r\nat me.\r\n\r\n"I tell you I placed my notebooks there," I repeated, purposely trying\r\nto bluster, in the hope of intimidating him. "Every one saw me do it,"\r\nI added, including the students near me in my glance. Several of them\r\nlooked at me with curiosity, yet none of them spoke.\r\n\r\n"Seats cannot be booked here," said Operoff. "Whoever first sits down\r\nin a place keeps it," and, settling himself angrily where he was, he\r\nflashed at me a glance of defiance.\r\n\r\n"Well, that only means that you are a cad," I said.\r\n\r\nI have an idea that he murmured something about my being "a stupid young\r\nidiot," but I decided not to hear it. What would be the use, I asked\r\nmyself, of my hearing it? That we should brawl like a couple of manants\r\nover less than nothing? (I was very fond of the word manants, and often\r\nused it for meeting awkward junctures.) Perhaps I should have said\r\nsomething more had not, at that moment, a door slammed and the professor\r\n(dressed in a blue frockcoat, and shuffling his feet as he walked)\r\nascended the rostrum.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the examination was about to come on, and I had need\r\nof some one\'s notebooks, Operoff remembered his promise to lend me his,\r\nand we did our preparation together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII. AFFAIRS OF THE HEART\r\n\r\nAffaires du coeur exercised me greatly that winter. In fact, I fell in\r\nlove three times. The first time, I became passionately enamoured of a\r\nbuxom lady whom I used to see riding at Freitag\'s riding-school; with\r\nthe result that every day when she was taking a lesson there (that is to\r\nsay, every Tuesday and Friday) I used to go to gaze at her, but always\r\nin such a state of trepidation lest I should be seen that I stood a long\r\nway off, and bolted directly I thought her likely to approach the spot\r\nwhere I was standing. Likewise, I used to turn round so precipitately\r\nwhenever she appeared to be glancing in my direction that I never\r\nsaw her face well, and to this day do not know whether she was really\r\nbeautiful or not.\r\n\r\nDubkoff, who was acquainted with her, surprised me one day in the\r\nriding-school, where I was lurking concealed behind the lady\'s grooms\r\nand the fur wraps which they were holding, and, having heard from\r\nDimitri of my infatuation, frightened me so terribly by proposing to\r\nintroduce me to the Amazon that I fled incontinently from the school,\r\nand was prevented by the mere thought that possibly he had told her\r\nabout me from ever entering the place again, or even from hiding behind\r\nher grooms, lest I should encounter her.\r\n\r\nWhenever I fell in love with ladies whom I did not know, and especially\r\nmarried women, I experienced a shyness a thousand times greater than I\r\nhad ever felt with Sonetchka. I dreaded beyond measure that my divinity\r\nshould learn of my passion, or even of my existence, since I felt sure\r\nthat, once she had done so, she would be so terribly offended that I\r\nshould never be forgiven for my presumption. And indeed, if the Amazon\r\nreferred to above had ever come to know how I used to stand behind the\r\ngrooms and dream of seizing her and carrying her off to some country\r\nspot--if she had ever come to know how I should have lived with her\r\nthere, and how I should have treated her, it is probable that she would\r\nhave had very good cause for indignation! But I always felt that, once\r\nI got to know her, she would straightway divine these thoughts, and\r\nconsider herself insulted by my acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAs my second affaire du coeur, I, (for the third time) fell in love with\r\nSonetchka when I saw her at her sister\'s. My second passion for her had\r\nlong since come to an end, but I became enamoured of her this third time\r\nthrough Lubotshka sending me a copy-book in which Sonetchka had copied\r\nsome extracts from Lermontoff\'s The Demon, with certain of the more\r\nsubtly amorous passages underlined in red ink and marked with pressed\r\nflowers. Remembering how Woloda had been wont to kiss his inamorata\'s\r\npurse last year, I essayed to do the same thing now; and really, when\r\nalone in my room in the evenings and engaged in dreaming as I looked at\r\na flower or occasionally pressed it to my lips, I would feel a certain\r\npleasantly lachrymose mood steal over me, and remain genuinely in love\r\n(or suppose myself to be so) for at least several days.\r\n\r\nFinally, my third affaire du coeur that winter was connected with the\r\nlady with whom Woloda was in love, and who used occasionally to visit\r\nat our house. Yet, in this damsel, as I now remember, there was not a\r\nsingle beautiful feature to be found--or, at all events, none of those\r\nwhich usually pleased me. She was the daughter of a well-known Moscow\r\nlady of light and leading, and, petite and slender, wore long flaxen\r\ncurls after the English fashion, and could boast of a transparent\r\nprofile. Every one said that she was even cleverer and more learned\r\nthan her mother, but I was never in a position to judge of that, since,\r\novercome with craven bashfulness at the mere thought of her intellect\r\nand accomplishments, I never spoke to her alone but once, and then\r\nwith unaccountable trepidation. Woloda\'s enthusiasm, however (for the\r\npresence of an audience never prevented him from giving vent to his\r\nrapture), communicated itself to me so strongly that I also became\r\nenamoured of the lady. Yet, conscious that he would not be pleased to\r\nknow that two brothers were in love with the same girl, I never told him\r\nof my condition. On the contrary, I took special delight in the thought\r\nthat our mutual love for her was so pure that, though its object was, in\r\nboth cases, the same charming being, we remained friends and ready, if\r\never the occasion should arise, to sacrifice ourselves for one another.\r\nYet I have an idea that, as regards self-sacrifice, he did not quite\r\nshare my views, for he was so passionately in love with the lady that\r\nonce he was for giving a member of the diplomatic corps, who was said\r\nto be going to marry her, a slap in the face and a challenge to a duel;\r\nbut, for my part, I would gladly have sacrificed my feelings for his\r\nsake, seeing that the fact that the only remark I had ever addressed to\r\nher had been on the subject of the dignity of classical music, and that\r\nmy passion, for all my efforts to keep it alive, expired the following\r\nweek, would have rendered it the more easy for me to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. THE WORLD\r\n\r\nAs regards those worldly delights to which I had intended, on entering\r\nthe University, to surrender myself in imitation of my brother, I\r\nunderwent a complete disillusionment that winter. Woloda danced a great\r\ndeal, and Papa also went to balls with his young wife, but I appeared\r\nto be thought either too young or unfitted for such delights, and no one\r\ninvited me to the houses where balls were being given. Yet, in spite of\r\nmy vow of frankness with Dimitri, I never told him (nor any one else)\r\nhow much I should have liked to go to those dances, and how I felt hurt\r\nat being forgotten and (apparently) taken for the philosopher that I\r\npretended to be.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a reception was to be given that winter at the Princess\r\nKornakoff\'s, and to it she sent us personal invitations--to myself among\r\nthe rest! Consequently, I was to attend my first ball. Before starting,\r\nWoloda came into my room to see how I was dressing myself--an act on\r\nhis part which greatly surprised me and took me aback. In my opinion (it\r\nmust be understood) solicitude about one\'s dress was a shameful thing,\r\nand should be kept under, but he seemed to think it a thing so natural\r\nand necessary that he said outright that he was afraid I should be put\r\nout of countenance on that score. Accordingly, he bid me don my patent\r\nleather boots, and was horrified to find that I wanted to put on gloves\r\nof peau de chamois. Next, he adjusted my watch-chain in a particular\r\nmanner, and carried me off to a hairdresser\'s near the Kuznetski Bridge\r\nto have my locks coiffured. That done, he withdrew to a little distance\r\nand surveyed me.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he looks right enough now" said he to the hairdresser.\r\n"Only--couldn\'t you smooth those tufts of his in front a little?" Yet,\r\nfor all that Monsieur Charles treated my forelocks with one essence and\r\nanother, they persisted in rising up again when ever I put on my hat. In\r\nfact, my curled and tonsured figure seemed to me to look far worse than\r\nit had done before. My only hope of salvation lay in an affectation of\r\nuntidiness. Only in that guise would my exterior resemble anything at\r\nall. Woloda, apparently, was of the same opinion, for he begged me to\r\nundo the curls, and when I had done so and still looked unpresentable,\r\nhe ceased to regard me at all, but throughout the drive to the\r\nKornakoffs remained silent and depressed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I entered the Kornakoffs\' mansion boldly enough, and it\r\nwas only when the Princess had invited me to dance, and I, for some\r\nreason or another (though I had driven there with no other thought in\r\nmy head than to dance well), had replied that I never indulged in that\r\npastime, that I began to blush, and, left solitary among a crowd of\r\nstrangers, became plunged in my usual insuperable and ever-growing\r\nshyness. In fact, I remained silent on that spot almost the whole\r\nevening!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, while a waltz was in progress, one of the young princesses\r\ncame to me and asked me, with the sort of official kindness common to\r\nall her family, why I was not dancing. I can remember blushing hotly\r\nat the question, but at the same time feeling--for all my efforts\r\nto prevent it--a self-satisfied smile steal over my face as I began\r\ntalking, in the most inflated and long-winded French, such rubbish as\r\neven now, after dozens of years, it shames me to recall. It must\r\nhave been the effect of the music, which, while exciting my nervous\r\nsensibility, drowned (as I supposed) the less intelligible portion of my\r\nutterances. Anyhow, I went on speaking of the exalted company present,\r\nand of the futility of men and women, until I had got myself into such\r\na tangle that I was forced to stop short in the middle of a word of a\r\nsentence which I found myself powerless to conclude.\r\n\r\nEven the worldly-minded young Princess was shocked by my conduct, and\r\ngazed at me in reproach; whereat I burst out laughing. At this critical\r\nmoment, Woloda, who had remarked that I was conversing with great\r\nanimation, and probably was curious to know what excuses I was making\r\nfor not dancing, approached us with Dubkoff. Seeing, however, my smiling\r\nface and the Princess\'s frightened mien, as well as overhearing the\r\nappalling rubbish with which I concluded my speech, he turned red in\r\nthe face, and wheeled round again. The Princess also rose and left me. I\r\ncontinued to smile, but in such a state of agony from the consciousness\r\nof my stupidity that I felt ready to sink into the floor. Likewise I\r\nfelt that, come what might, I must move about and say something, in\r\norder to effect a change in my position. Accordingly I approached\r\nDubkoff, and asked him if he had danced many waltzes with her that\r\nnight. This I feigned to say in a gay and jesting manner, yet in reality\r\nI was imploring help of the very Dubkoff to whom I had cried "Hold your\r\ntongue!" on the night of the matriculation dinner. By way of answer, he\r\nmade as though he had not heard me, and turned away. Next, I approached\r\nWoloda, and said with an effort and in a similar tone of assumed gaiety:\r\n"Hullo, Woloda! Are you played out yet?" He merely looked at me as much\r\nas to say, "You wouldn\'t speak to me like that if we were alone," and\r\nleft me without a word, in the evident fear that I might continue to\r\nattach myself to his person.\r\n\r\n"My God! Even my own brother deserts me!" I thought to myself.\r\n\r\nYet somehow I had not the courage to depart, but remained standing where\r\nI was until the very end of the evening. At length, when every one was\r\nleaving the room and crowding into the hall, and a footman slipped my\r\ngreatcoat on to my shoulders in such a way as to tilt up my cap, I gave\r\na dreary, half-lachrymose smile, and remarked to no one in particular:\r\n"Comme c\'est gracieux!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX. THE STUDENTS\' FEAST\r\n\r\nNOTWITHSTANDING that, as yet, Dimitri\'s influence had kept me from\r\nindulging in those customary students\' festivities known as kutezhi or\r\n"wines," that winter saw me participate in such a function, and carry\r\naway with me a not over-pleasant impression of it. This is how it came\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nAt a lecture soon after the New Year, Baron Z.--a tall, light-haired\r\nyoung fellow of very serious demeanour and regular features--invited us\r\nall to spend a sociable evening with him. By "us all", I mean all the\r\nmen more or less "comme il faut", of our course, and exclusive of\r\nGrap, Semenoff, Operoff, and commoners of that sort. Woloda smiled\r\ncontemptuously when he heard that I was going to a "wine" of first\r\ncourse men, but I looked to derive great and unusual pleasure from this,\r\nto me, novel method of passing the time. Accordingly, punctually at the\r\nappointed hour of eight I presented myself at the Baron\'s.\r\n\r\nOur host, in an open tunic and white waistcoat, received his guests\r\nin the brilliantly lighted salon and drawing-room of the small mansion\r\nwhere his parents lived--they having given up their reception rooms to\r\nhim for the evening for purposes of this party. In the corridor could\r\nbe seen the heads and skirts of inquisitive domestics, while in the\r\ndining-room I caught a glimpse of a dress which I imagined to belong to\r\nthe Baroness herself. The guests numbered a score, and were all of\r\nthem students except Herr Frost (in attendance upon Iwin) and a tall,\r\nred-faced gentleman who was superintending the feast and who was\r\nintroduced to every one as a relative of the Baron\'s and a former\r\nstudent of the University of Dorpat. At first, the excessive brilliancy\r\nand formal appointments of the reception-rooms had such a chilling\r\neffect upon this youthful company that every one involuntarily hugged\r\nthe walls, except a few bolder spirits and the ex-Dorpat student, who,\r\nwith his waistcoat already unbuttoned, seemed to be in every room, and\r\nin every corner of every room, at once, and filled the whole place with\r\nhis resonant, agreeable, never-ceasing tenor voice. The remainder of the\r\nguests preferred either to remain silent or to talk in discreet tones of\r\nprofessors, faculties, examinations, and other serious and interesting\r\nmatters. Yet every one, without exception, kept watching the door of\r\nthe dining-room, and, while trying to conceal the fact, wearing an\r\nexpression which said: "Come! It is time to begin." I too felt that\r\nit was time to begin, and awaited the beginning with pleasurable\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\nAfter footmen had handed round tea among the guests, the Dorpat student\r\nasked Frost in Russian:\r\n\r\n"Can you make punch, Frost?"\r\n\r\n"Oh ja!" replied Frost with a joyful flourish of his heels, and the\r\nother went on:\r\n\r\n"Then do you set about it" (they addressed each other in the second\r\nperson singular, as former comrades at Dorpat). Frost accordingly\r\ndeparted to the dining-room, with great strides of his bowed, muscular\r\nlegs, and, after some walking backwards and forwards, deposited upon the\r\ndrawing-room table a large punchbowl, accompanied by a ten-pound sugar\r\nloaf supported on three students\' swords placed crosswise. Meanwhile,\r\nthe Baron had been going round among his guests as they sat regarding\r\nthe punch-bowl, and addressing them, with a face of immutable gravity,\r\nin the formula: "I beg of you all to drink of this loving-cup in student\r\nfashion, that there may be good-fellowship among the members of our\r\ncourse. Unbutton your waistcoats, or take them off altogether, as you\r\nplease." Already the Dorpat student had divested himself of his tunic\r\nand rolled up his white shirt-sleeves above his elbows, and now,\r\nplanting his feet firmly apart, he proceeded to set fire to the rum in\r\nthe punch-bowl.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, put out the candles!" he cried with a sudden shout so loud\r\nand insistent that we seemed all of us to be shouting at once. However,\r\nwe still went on silently regarding the punch-bowl and the white shirt\r\nof the Dorpat student, with a feeling that a moment of great solemnity\r\nwas approaching.\r\n\r\n"Put out the lights, Frost, I tell you!" the Dorpat student shouted\r\nagain. Evidently the punch was now sufficiently burnt. Accordingly\r\nevery one helped to extinguish the candles, until the room was in total\r\ndarkness save for a spot where the white shirts and hands of the three\r\nstudents supporting the sugarloaf on their crossed swords were lit up by\r\nthe lurid flames from the bowl. Yet the Dorpat student\'s tenor voice\r\nwas not the only one to be heard, for in different quarters of the\r\nroom resounded chattering and laughter. Many had taken off their tunics\r\n(especially students whose garments were of fine cloth and perfectly\r\nnew), and I now did the same, with a consciousness that "IT" was\r\n"beginning." There had been no great festivity as yet, but I felt\r\nassured that things would go splendidly when once we had begun drinking\r\ntumblers of the potion that was now in course of preparation.\r\n\r\nAt length, the punch was ready, and the Dorpat student, with much\r\nbespattering of the table as he did so, ladled the liquor into tumblers,\r\nand cried: "Now, gentlemen, please!" When we had each of us taken a\r\nsticky tumbler of the stuff into our hands, the Dorpat student and Frost\r\nsang a German song in which the word "Hoch!" kept occurring again and\r\nagain, while we joined, in haphazard fashion, in the chorus. Next we\r\nclinked glasses together, shouted something in praise of punch, crossed\r\nhands, and took our first drink of the sweet, strong mixture. After that\r\nthere was no further waiting; the "wine" was in full swing. The first\r\nglassful consumed, a second was poured out. Yet, for all that I began to\r\nfeel a throbbing in my temples, and that the flames seemed to be turning\r\npurple, and that every one around me was laughing and shouting, things\r\nseemed lacking in real gaiety, and I somehow felt that, as a matter\r\nof fact, we were all of us finding the affair rather dull, and only\r\nPRETENDING to be enjoying it. The Dorpat student may have been an\r\nexception, for he continued to grow more and more red in the face and\r\nmore and more ubiquitous as he filled up empty glasses and stained the\r\ntable with fresh spots of the sweet, sticky stuff. The precise sequence\r\nof events I cannot remember, but I can recall feeling strongly attracted\r\ntowards Frost and the Dorpat student that evening, learning their German\r\nsong by heart, and kissing them each on their sticky-sweet lips; also\r\nthat that same evening I conceived a violent hatred against the Dorpat\r\nstudent, and was for pushing him from his chair, but thought better of\r\nit; also that, besides feeling the same spirit of independence towards\r\nthe rest of the company as I had felt on the night of the matriculation\r\ndinner, my head ached and swam so badly that I thought each moment would\r\nbe my last; also that, for some reason or another, we all of us sat down\r\non the floor and imitated the movements of rowers in a boat as we sang\r\nin chorus, "Down our mother stream the Volga;" also that I conceived\r\nthis procedure on our part to be uncalled for; also that, as I lay\r\nprone upon the floor, I crossed my legs and began wriggling about like a\r\ntsigane; [Gipsy dancer.] also that I ricked some one\'s neck, and came to\r\nthe conclusion that I should never have done such a thing if I had not\r\nbeen drunk; also that we had some supper and another kind of liquor, and\r\nthat I then went to the door to get some fresh air; also that my head\r\nseemed suddenly to grow chill, and that I noticed, as I drove away, that\r\nthe scat of the vehicle was so sharply aslant and slippery that for me\r\nto retain my position behind Kuzma was impossible; also that he seemed\r\nto have turned all flabby, and to be waving about like a dish clout.\r\nBut what I remember best is that throughout the whole of that evening\r\nI never ceased to feel that I was acting with excessive stupidity in\r\npretending to be enjoying myself, to like drinking a great deal, and to\r\nbe in no way drunk, as well as that every one else present was acting\r\nwith equal stupidity in pretending those same things. All the time I had\r\na feeling that each one of my companions was finding the festivities as\r\ndistasteful as I was myself; but, in the belief that he was the only one\r\ndoing so, felt himself bound to pretend that he was very merry, in order\r\nnot to mar the general hilarity. Also, strange to state, I felt that\r\nI ought to keep up this pretence for the sole reason that into a\r\npunch-bowl there had been poured three bottles of champagne at nine\r\nroubles the bottle and ten bottles of rum at four--making seventy\r\nroubles in all, exclusive of the supper. So convinced of my folly did\r\nI feel that, when, at next day\'s lecture, those of my comrades who had\r\nbeen at Baron Z.\'s party seemed not only in no way ashamed to remember\r\nwhat they had done, but even talked about it so that other students\r\nmight hear of their doings, I felt greatly astonished. They all declared\r\nthat it had been a splendid "wine," that Dorpat students were just the\r\nfellows for that kind of thing, and that there had been consumed at it\r\nno less than forty bottles of rum among twenty guests, some of whom had\r\ndropped senseless under the table! That they should care to talk about\r\nsuch things seemed strange enough, but that they should care to lie\r\nabout them seemed absolutely unintelligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL. MY FRIENDSHIP WITH THE NECHLUDOFFS\r\n\r\nThat winter, too, I saw a great deal both of Dimitri who often looked\r\nus up, and of his family, with whom I was beginning to stand on intimate\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nThe Nechludoffs (that is to say, mother, aunt, and daughter) always\r\nspent their evenings at home, at which time the Princess liked young men\r\nto visit her--at all events young men of the kind whom she described\r\nas able to spend an evening without playing cards or dancing. Yet such\r\nyoung fellows must have been few and far between, for, although I went\r\nto the Nechludoffs almost every evening, I seldom found other guests\r\npresent. Thus, I came to know the members of this family and their\r\nseveral dispositions well enough to be able to form clear ideas as\r\nto their mutual relations, and to be quite at home amid the rooms\r\nand furniture of their house. Indeed, so long as no other guests were\r\npresent, I felt entirely at my ease. True, at first I used to feel a\r\nlittle uncomfortable when left alone in the room with Varenika, for\r\nI could not rid myself of the idea that, though far from pretty, she\r\nwished me to fall in love with her; but in time this nervousness of mine\r\nbegan to lessen, since she always looked so natural, and talked to me\r\nso exactly as though she were conversing with her brother or Lubov\r\nSergievna, that I came to look upon her simply as a person to whom it\r\nwas in no way dangerous or wrong to show that I took pleasure in her\r\ncompany. Throughout the whole of our acquaintance she appeared to me\r\nmerely a plain, though not positively ugly, girl, concerning whom one\r\nwould never ask oneself the question,\r\n\r\n"Am I, or am I not, in love with her?" Sometimes I would talk to her\r\ndirect, but more often I did so through Dimitri or Lubov Sergievna; and\r\nit was the latter method which afforded me the most pleasure. I derived\r\nconsiderable gratification from discoursing when she was there, from\r\nhearing her sing, and, in general, from knowing that she was in the\r\nsame room as myself; but it was seldom now that any thoughts of what our\r\nfuture relations might ever be, or that any dreams of self-sacrifice for\r\nmy friend if he should ever fall in love with my sister, came into my\r\nhead. If any such ideas or fancies occurred to me, I felt satisfied with\r\nthe present, and drove away all thoughts about the future.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of this intimacy, I continued to look upon it as my\r\nbounden duty to keep the Nechludoffs in general, and Varenika in\r\nparticular, in ignorance of my true feelings and tastes, and strove\r\nalways to appear altogether another young man than what I really was--to\r\nappear, indeed, such a young man as could never possibly have existed. I\r\naffected to be "soulful" and would go off into raptures and exclamations\r\nand impassioned gestures whenever I wished it to be thought that\r\nanything pleased me, while, on the other hand, I tried always to seem\r\nindifferent towards any unusual circumstance which I myself perceived or\r\nwhich I had had pointed out to me. I aimed always at figuring both as a\r\nsarcastic cynic divorced from every sacred tie and as a shrewd observer,\r\nas well as at being accounted logical in all my conduct, precise and\r\nmethodical in all my ways of life, and at the same time contemptuous of\r\nall materiality. I may safely say that I was far better in reality than\r\nthe strange being into whom I attempted to convert myself; yet, whatever\r\nI was or was not, the Nechludoffs were unfailingly kind to me,\r\nand (happily for myself) took no notice (as it now appears) of my\r\nplay-acting. Only Lubov Sergievna, who, I believe, really believed me\r\nto be a great egoist, atheist, and cynic, had no love for me, but\r\nfrequently disputed what I said, flew into tempers, and left me\r\npetrified with her disjointed, irrelevant utterances. Yet Dimitri held\r\nalways to the same strange, something more than friendly, relations with\r\nher, and used to say not only that she was misunderstood by every one,\r\nbut that she did him a world of good. This, however, did not prevent the\r\nrest of his family from finding fault with his infatuation.\r\n\r\nOnce, when talking to me about this incomprehensible attachment,\r\nVarenika explained the matter thus: "You see, Dimitri is a selfish\r\nperson. He is very proud, and, for all his intellect, very fond of\r\npraise, and of surprising people, and of always being FIRST, while\r\nlittle Auntie" (the general nickname for Lubov Sergievna) "is innocent\r\nenough to admire him, and at the same time devoid of the tact to\r\nconceal her admiration. Consequently she flatters his vanity--not out of\r\npretence, but sincerely."\r\n\r\nThis dictum I laid to heart, and, when thinking it over afterwards,\r\ncould not but come to the conclusion that Varenika was very sensible;\r\nwherefore I was glad to award her promotion thenceforth in my regard.\r\nYet, though I was always glad enough to assign her any credit which\r\nmight arise from my discovering in her character any signs of good sense\r\nor other moral qualities, I did so with strict moderation, and never\r\nran to any extreme pitch of enthusiasm in the process. Thus, when Sophia\r\nIvanovna (who was never weary of discussing her niece) related to me\r\nhow, four years ago, Varenika had suddenly given away all her clothes to\r\nsome peasant children without first asking permission to do so, so that\r\nthe garments had subsequently to be recovered, I did not at once accept\r\nthe fact as entitling Varenika to elevation in my opinion, but went\r\non giving her good advice about the unpracticalness of such views on\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nWhen other guests were present at the Nechludoffs (among them,\r\nsometimes, Woloda and Dubkoff) I used to withdraw myself to a remote\r\nplane, and, with the complacency and quiet consciousness of strength\r\nof an habitue of the house, listen to what others were saying without\r\nputting in a remark myself. Yet everything that these others said seemed\r\nto me so immeasurably stupid that I used to feel inwardly amazed that\r\nsuch a clever, logical woman as the Princess, with her equally logical\r\nfamily, could listen to and answer such rubbish. Had it, however,\r\nentered into my head to compare what, others said with what I myself\r\nsaid when there alone, I should probably have ceased to feel surprise.\r\nStill less should I have continued to feel surprise had I not\r\nbelieved that the women of our own household--Avdotia, Lubotshka, and\r\nKatenka--were superior to the rest of their sex, for in that case I\r\nshould have remembered the kind of things over which Avdotia and Katenka\r\nwould laugh and jest with Dubkoff from one end of an evening to the\r\nother. I should have remembered that seldom did an evening pass but\r\nDubkoff would first have, an argument about something, and then read in\r\na sententious voice either some verses beginning "Au banquet de la vie,\r\ninfortune convive" or extracts from The Demon. In short, I should have\r\nremembered what nonsense they used to chatter for hours at a time.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that, when guests were present, Varenika paid\r\nless attention to me than when we were alone, as well as that I was\r\ndeprived of the reading and music which I so greatly loved to hear. When\r\ntalking to guests, she lost, in my eyes, her principal charm--that of\r\nquiet seriousness and simplicity. I remember how strange it used to seem\r\nto me to hear her discoursing on theatres and the weather to my brother\r\nWoloda! I knew that of all things in the world he most despised and\r\nshunned banality, and that Varenika herself used to make fun of forced\r\nconversations on the weather and similar matters. Why, then, when\r\nmeeting in society, did they both of them talk such intolerable\r\nnothings, and, as it were, shame one another? After talks of this kind\r\nI used to feel silently resentful against Woloda, as well as next day to\r\nrally Varenika on her overnight guests. Yet one result of it was that\r\nI derived all the greater pleasure from being one of the Nechludoffs\'\r\nfamily circle. Also, for some reason or another I began to prefer\r\nmeeting Dimitri in his mother\'s drawing-room to being with him alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI. MY FRIENDSHIP WITH THE NECHLUDOFFS\r\n\r\nAt this period, indeed, my friendship with Dimitri hung by a hair. I\r\nhad been criticising him too long not to have discovered faults in his\r\ncharacter, for it is only in first youth that we love passionately and\r\ntherefore love only perfect people. As soon as the mists engendered by\r\nlove of this kind begin to dissolve, and to be penetrated by the clear\r\nbeams of reason, we see the object of our adoration in his true shape,\r\nand with all his virtues and failings exposed. Some of those failings\r\nstrike us with the exaggerated force of the unexpected, and combine with\r\nthe instinct for novelty and the hope that perfection may yet be\r\nfound in a fellow-man to induce us not only to feel coldness, but\r\neven aversion, towards the late object of our adoration. Consequently,\r\ndesiring it no longer, we usually cast it from us, and pass onwards\r\nto seek fresh perfection. For the circumstance that that was not what\r\noccurred with respect to my own relation to Dimitri, I was indebted to\r\nhis stubborn, punctilious, and more critical than impulsive attachment\r\nto myself--a tie which I felt ashamed to break. Moreover, our strange\r\nvow of frankness bound us together. We were afraid that, if we parted,\r\nwe should leave in one another\'s power all the incriminatory moral\r\nsecrets of which we had made mutual confession. At the same time, our\r\nrule of frankness had long ceased to be faithfully observed, but, on\r\nthe contrary, proved a frequent cause of constraint, and brought about\r\nstrange relations between us.\r\n\r\nAlmost every time that winter that I went upstairs to Dimitri\'s room,\r\nI used to find there a University friend of his named Bezobiedoff, with\r\nwhom he appeared to be very much taken up. Bezobiedoff was a small,\r\nslight fellow, with a face pitted over with smallpox, freckled,\r\neffeminate hands, and a huge flaxen moustache much in need of the comb.\r\nHe was invariably dirty, shabby, uncouth, and uninteresting. To me,\r\nDimitri\'s relations with him were as unintelligible as his relations\r\nwith Lubov Sergievna, and the only reason he could have had for choosing\r\nsuch a man for his associate was that in the whole University there was\r\nno worse-looking student than Bezobiedoff. Yet that alone would have\r\nbeen sufficient to make Dimitri extend him his friendship, and, as a\r\nmatter of fact, in all his intercourse with this fellow he seemed to be\r\nsaying proudly: "I care nothing who a man may be. In my eyes every one\r\nis equal. I like him, and therefore he is a desirable acquaintance."\r\nNevertheless I could not imagine how he could bring himself to do it,\r\nnor how the wretched Bezobiedoff ever contrived to maintain his awkward\r\nposition. To me the friendship seemed a most distasteful one.\r\n\r\nOne night, I went up to Dimitri\'s room to try and get him to come down\r\nfor an evening\'s talk in his mother\'s drawing-room, where we could\r\nalso listen to Varenika\'s reading and singing, but Bezobiedoff had\r\nforestalled me there, and Dimitri answered me curtly that he could not\r\ncome down, since, as I could see for myself, he had a visitor with him.\r\n\r\n"Besides," he added, "what is the fun of sitting there? We had much\r\nbetter stay HERE and talk."\r\n\r\nI scarcely relished the prospect of spending a couple of hours in\r\nBezobiedoff\'s company, yet could not make up my mind to go down\r\nalone; wherefore, cursing my friend\'s vagaries, I seated myself in a\r\nrocking-chair, and began rocking myself silently to and fro. I\r\nfelt vexed with them both for depriving me of the pleasures of the\r\ndrawing-room, and my only hope as I listened irritably to their\r\nconversation was that Bezobiedoff would soon take his departure. "A nice\r\nguest indeed to be sitting with!" I thought to myself when a footman\r\nbrought in tea and Dimitri had five times to beg Bezobiedoff to have a\r\ncup, for the reason that the bashful guest thought it incumbent upon him\r\nalways to refuse it at first and to say, "No, help yourself." I could\r\nsee that Dimitri had to put some restraint upon himself as he resumed\r\nthe conversation. He tried to inveigle me also into it, but I remained\r\nglum and silent.\r\n\r\n"I do not mean to let my face give any one the suspicion that I am\r\nbored" was my mental remark to Dimitri as I sat quietly rocking myself\r\nto and fro with measured beat. Yet, as the moments passed, I found\r\nmyself--not without a certain satisfaction--growing more and more\r\ninwardly hostile to my friend. "What a fool he is!" I reflected. "He\r\nmight be spending the evening agreeably with his charming family, yet he\r\ngoes on sitting with this brute!--will go on doing so, too, until it is\r\ntoo late to go down to the drawing-room!" Here I glanced at him over\r\nthe back of my chair, and thought the general look of his attitude and\r\nappearance so offensive and repellant that at the moment I could gladly\r\nhave offered him some insult, even a most serious one.\r\n\r\nAt last Bezobiedoff rose, but Dimitri could not easily let such a\r\ndelightful friend depart, and asked him to stay the night. Fortunately,\r\nBezobiedoff declined the invitation, and departed. Having seen him off,\r\nDimitri returned, and, smiling a faintly complacent smile as he did so,\r\nand rubbing his hands together (in all probability partly because he had\r\nsustained his character for eccentricity, and partly because he had got\r\nrid of a bore), started to pace the room, with an occasional glance\r\nat myself. I felt more offended with him than ever. "How can he go\r\non walking about the room and grinning like that?" was my inward\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\n"What are you so angry about?" he asked me suddenly as he halted in\r\nfront of my chair.\r\n\r\n"I am not in the least angry," I replied (as people always do answer\r\nunder such circumstances). "I am merely vexed that you should play-act\r\nto me, and to Bezobiedoff, and to yourself."\r\n\r\n"What rubbish!" he retorted. "I never play-act to any one."\r\n\r\n"I have in mind our rule of frankness," I replied, "when I tell you that\r\nI am certain you cannot bear this Bezobiedoff any more than I can. He is\r\nan absolute cad, yet for some inexplicable reason or another it pleases\r\nyou to masquerade before him."\r\n\r\n"Not at all! To begin with, he is a splendid fellow, and--"\r\n\r\n"But I tell you it IS so. I also tell you that your friendship for Lubov\r\nSergievna is founded on the same basis, namely, that she thinks you a\r\ngod."\r\n\r\n"And I tell you once more that it is not so."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know it for myself," I retorted with the heat of suppressed\r\nanger, and designing to disarm him with my frankness. "I have told you\r\nbefore, and I repeat it now, that you always seem to like people who say\r\npleasant things to you, but that, as soon as ever I come to examine\r\nyour friendship, I invariably find that there exists no real attachment\r\nbetween you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you are wrong," said Dimitri with an angry straightening of the\r\nneck in his collar. "When I like people, neither their praise nor their\r\nblame can make any difference to my opinion of them."\r\n\r\n"Well, dreadful though it may seem to you, I confess that I myself often\r\nused to hate my father when he abused me, and to wish that he was dead.\r\nIn the same way, you--"\r\n\r\n"Speak for yourself. I am very sorry that you could ever have been so--"\r\n\r\n"No, no!" I cried as I leapt from my chair and faced him with the\r\ncourage of exasperation. "It is for YOURSELF that you ought to feel\r\nsorry--sorry because you never told me a word about this fellow. You\r\nknow that was not honourable of you. Nevertheless, I will tell YOU what\r\nI think of you," and, burning to wound him even more than he had wounded\r\nme, I set out to prove to him that he was incapable of feeling any real\r\naffection for anybody, and that I had the best of grounds (as in very\r\ntruth I believed I had) for reproaching him. I took great pleasure\r\nin telling him all this, but at the same time forgot that the only\r\nconceivable purpose of my doing so--to force him to confess to the\r\nfaults of which I had accused him--could not possibly be attained at the\r\npresent moment, when he was in a rage. Had he, on the other hand, been\r\nin a condition to argue calmly, I should probably never have said what I\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nThe dispute was verging upon an open quarrel when Dimitri suddenly\r\nbecame silent, and left the room. I pursued him, and continued what I\r\nwas saying, but he did not answer. I knew that his failings included a\r\nhasty temper, and that he was now fighting it down; wherefore I cursed\r\nhis good resolutions the more in my heart.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was what our rule of frankness had brought us to--the rule\r\nthat we should "tell one another everything in our minds, and never\r\ndiscuss one another with a third person!" Many a time we had exaggerated\r\nfrankness to the pitch of making mutual confession of the most shameless\r\nthoughts, and of shaming ourselves by voicing to one another proposals\r\nor schemes for attaining our desires; yet those confessions had not\r\nonly failed to draw closer the tie which united us, but had dissipated\r\nsympathy and thrust us further apart, until now pride would not allow\r\nhim to expose his feelings even in the smallest detail, and we employed\r\nin our quarrel the very weapons which we had formerly surrendered to one\r\nanother--the weapons which could strike the shrewdest blows!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII. OUR STEPMOTHER\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that Papa had not meant to return to Moscow before the\r\nNew Year, he arrived in October, when there was still good riding to\r\nhounds to be had in the country. He alleged as his reason for changing\r\nhis mind that his suit was shortly to come on before the Senate, but\r\nMimi averred that Avdotia had found herself so ennuyee in the country,\r\nand had so often talked about Moscow and pretended to be unwell, that\r\nPapa had decided to accede to her wishes. "You see, she never really\r\nloved him--she and her love only kept buzzing about his ears because she\r\nwanted to marry a rich man," added Mimi with a pensive sigh which said:\r\n"To think what a certain other person could have done for him if only he\r\nhad valued her!"\r\n\r\nYet that "certain other person" was unjust to Avdotia, seeing that\r\nthe latter\'s affection for Papa--the passionate, devoted love of\r\nself-abandonment--revealed itself in her every look and word and\r\nmovement. At the same time, that love in no way hindered her, not only\r\nfrom being averse to parting with her adored husband, but also from\r\ndesiring to visit Madame Annette\'s and order there a lovely cap, a hat\r\ntrimmed with a magnificent blue ostrich feather, and a blue Venetian\r\nvelvet bodice which was to expose to the public gaze the snowy, well\r\nshaped breast and arms which no one had yet gazed upon except her\r\nhusband and maids. Of course Katenka sided with her mother and, in\r\ngeneral, there became established between Avdotia and ourselves, from\r\nthe day of her arrival, the most extraordinary and burlesque order of\r\nrelations. As soon as she stepped from the carriage, Woloda assumed an\r\nair of great seriousness and ceremony, and, advancing towards her with\r\nmuch bowing and scraping, said in the tone of one who is presenting\r\nsomething for acceptance:\r\n\r\n"I have the honour to greet the arrival of our dear Mamma, and to kiss\r\nher hand."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear son!" she replied with her beautiful, unvarying smile.\r\n\r\n"And do not forget the younger son," I said as I also approached her\r\nhand, with an involuntary imitation of Woloda\'s voice and expression.\r\n\r\nHad our stepmother and ourselves been certain of any mutual affection,\r\nthat expression might have signified contempt for any outward\r\nmanifestation of our love. Had we been ill-disposed towards one another,\r\nit might have denoted irony, or contempt for pretence, or a desire to\r\nconceal from Papa (standing by the while) our real relations, as well\r\nas many other thoughts and sentiments. But, as a matter of fact, that\r\nexpression (which well consorted with Avdotia\'s own spirit) simply\r\nsignified nothing at all--simply concealed the absence of any definite\r\nrelations between us. In later life I often had occasion to remark, in\r\nthe case of other families whose members anticipated among themselves\r\nrelations not altogether harmonious, the sort of provisional, burlesque\r\nrelations which they formed for daily use; and it was just such\r\nrelations as those which now became established between ourselves and\r\nour stepmother. We scarcely ever strayed beyond them, but were polite\r\nto her, conversed with her in French, bowed and scraped before her, and\r\ncalled her "chere Maman"--a term to which she always responded in a tone\r\nof similar lightness and with her beautiful, unchanging smile. Only the\r\nlachrymose Lubotshka, with her goose feet and artless prattle, really\r\nliked our stepmother, or tried, in her naive and frequently awkward way,\r\nto bring her and ourselves together: wherefore the only person in the\r\nworld for whom, besides Papa, Avdotia had a spark of affection was\r\nLubotshka. Indeed, Avdotia always treated her with a kind of grave\r\nadmiration and timid deference which greatly surprised me.\r\n\r\nFrom the first Avdotia was very fond of calling herself our stepmother\r\nand hinting that, since children and servants usually adopt an unjust\r\nand hostile attitude towards a woman thus situated, her own position\r\nwas likely to prove a difficult one. Yet, though she foresaw all the\r\nunpleasantness of her predicament, she did nothing to escape from it by\r\n(for instance) conciliating this one, giving presents to that other one,\r\nand forbearing to grumble--the last a precaution which it would have\r\nbeen easy for her to take, seeing that by nature she was in no way\r\nexacting, as well as very good-tempered. Yet, not only did she do none\r\nof these things, but her expectation of difficulties led her to adopt\r\nthe defensive before she had been attacked. That is to say, supposing\r\nthat the entire household was designing to show her every kind of insult\r\nand annoyance, she would see plots where no plots were, and consider\r\nthat her most dignified course was to suffer in silence--an attitude\r\nof passivity as regards winning AFfection which of course led to\r\nDISaffection. Moreover, she was so totally lacking in that faculty\r\nof "apprehension" to which I have already referred as being highly\r\ndeveloped in our household, and all her customs were so utterly opposed\r\nto those which had long been rooted in our establishment, that those two\r\nfacts alone were bound to go against her. From the first, her mode of\r\nlife in our tidy, methodical household was that of a person only\r\njust arrived there. Sometimes she went to bed late, sometimes early;\r\nsometimes she appeared at luncheon, sometimes she did not; sometimes she\r\ntook supper, sometimes she dispensed with it. When we had no guests\r\nwith us she more often than not walked about the house in a semi-nude\r\ncondition, and was not ashamed to appear before us--even before the\r\nservants--in a white chemise, with only a shawl thrown over her bare\r\nshoulders. At first this Bohemianism pleased me, but before very long\r\nit led to my losing the last shred of respect which I felt for her. What\r\nstruck me as even more strange was the fact that, according as we had or\r\nhad not guests, she was two different women. The one (the woman figuring\r\nin society) was a young and healthy, but rather cold, beauty, a person\r\nrichly dressed, neither stupid nor clever, and unfailingly cheerful.\r\nThe other woman (the one in evidence when no guests were present) was\r\nconsiderably past her first youth, languid, depressed, slovenly, and\r\nennuyee, though affectionate. Frequently, as I looked at her when,\r\nsmiling, rosy with the winter air, and happy in the consciousness of her\r\nbeauty, she came in from a round of calls and, taking off her hat, went\r\nto look at herself in a mirror; or when, rustling in her rich, decollete\r\nball dress, and at once shy and proud before the servants, she was\r\npassing to her carriage; or when, at one of our small receptions at\r\nhome, she was sitting dressed in a high silken dress finished with some\r\nsort of fine lace about her soft neck, and flashing her unvarying, but\r\nlovely, smile around her--as I looked at her at such times I could\r\nnot help wondering what would have been said by persons who had been\r\nravished to behold her thus if they could have seen her as I often saw\r\nher, namely, when, waiting in the lonely midnight hours for her husband\r\nto return from his club, she would walk like a shadow from room to\r\nroom, with her hair dishevelled and her form clad in a sort of\r\ndressing-jacket. Presently, she would sit down to the piano and, her\r\nbrows all puckered with the effort, play over the only waltz that she\r\nknew; after which she would pick up a novel, read a few pages somewhere\r\nin the middle of it, and throw it aside. Next, repairing in person\r\nto the dining-room, so as not to disturb the servants, she would get\r\nherself a cucumber and some cold veal, and eat it standing by the\r\nwindow-sill--then once more resume her weary, aimless, gloomy wandering\r\nfrom room to room. But what, above all other things, caused estrangement\r\nbetween us was that lack of understanding which expressed itself chiefly\r\nin the peculiar air of indulgent attention with which she would listen\r\nwhen any one was speaking to her concerning matters of which she had no\r\nknowledge. It was not her fault that she acquired the unconscious habit\r\nof bending her head down and smiling slightly with her lips only when\r\nshe found it necessary to converse on topics which did not interest her\r\n(which meant any topic except herself and her husband); yet that smile\r\nand that inclination of the head, when incessantly repeated, could\r\nbecome unbearably wearisome. Also, her peculiar gaiety--which always\r\nsounded as though she were laughing at herself, at you, and at the world\r\nin general--was gauche and anything but infectious, while her sympathy\r\nwas too evidently forced. Lastly, she knew no reticence with regard\r\nto her ceaseless rapturising to all and sundry concerning her love for\r\nPapa. Although she only spoke the truth when she said that her whole\r\nlife was bound up with him, and although she proved it her life long,\r\nwe considered such unrestrained, continual insistence upon her affection\r\nfor him bad form, and felt more ashamed for her when she was descanting\r\nthus before strangers even than we did when she was perpetrating bad\r\nblunders in French. Yet, although, as I have said, she loved her husband\r\nmore than anything else in the world, and he too had a great affection\r\nfor her (or at all events he had at first, and when he saw that others\r\nbesides himself admired her beauty), it seemed almost as though she\r\npurposely did everything most likely to displease him--simply to prove\r\nto him the strength of her love, her readiness to sacrifice herself\r\nfor his sake, and the fact that her one aim in life was to win his\r\naffection! She was fond of display, and my father too liked to see her\r\nas a beauty who excited wonder and admiration; yet she sacrificed her\r\nweakness for fine clothes to her love for him, and grew more and\r\nmore accustomed to remain at home in a plain grey blouse. Again, Papa\r\nconsidered freedom and equality to be indispensable conditions of family\r\nlife, and hoped that his favourite Lubotshka and his kind-hearted young\r\nwife would become sincere friends; yet once again Avdotia sacrificed\r\nherself by considering it incumbent upon her to pay the "real mistress\r\nof the house," as she called Lubotshka, an amount of deference which\r\nonly shocked and annoyed my father. Likewise, he played cards a great\r\ndeal that winter, and lost considerable sums towards the end of it,\r\nwherefore, unwilling, as usual, to let his gambling affairs intrude upon\r\nhis family life, he began to preserve complete secrecy concerning his\r\nplay; yet Avdotia, though often ailing, as well as, towards the end of\r\nthe winter, enceinte, considered herself bound always to sit up (in a\r\ngrey blouse, and with her hair dishevelled) for my father when, at,\r\nsay, four or five o\'clock in the morning, he returned home from the\r\nclub ashamed, depleted in pocket, and weary. She would ask him\r\nabsent-mindedly whether he had been fortunate in play, and listen with\r\nindulgent attention, little nods of her head, and a faint smile upon her\r\nface as he told her of his doings at the club and begged her, for about\r\nthe hundredth time, never to sit up for him again. Yet, though Papa\'s\r\nwinnings or losings (upon which his substance practically depended)\r\nin no way interested her, she was always the first to meet him when he\r\nreturned home in the small hours of the morning. This she was incited\r\nto do, not only by the strength of her devotion, but by a certain secret\r\njealousy from which she suffered. No one in the world could persuade her\r\nthat it was REALLY from his club, and not from a mistress\'s, that Papa\r\ncame home so late. She would try to read love secrets in his face, and,\r\ndiscerning none there, would sigh with a sort of enjoyment of her grief,\r\nand give herself up once more to the contemplation of her unhappiness.\r\n\r\nAs the result of these and many other constant sacrifices which occurred\r\nin Papa\'s relations with his wife during the latter months of that\r\nwinter (a time when he lost much, and was therefore out of spirits),\r\nthere gradually grew up between the two an intermittent feeling of tacit\r\nhostility--of restrained aversion to the object of devotion of the kind\r\nwhich expresses itself in an unconscious eagerness to show the object in\r\nquestion every possible species of petty annoyance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII. NEW COMRADES\r\n\r\nThe winter had passed imperceptibly and the thaw begun when the list\r\nof examinations was posted at the University, and I suddenly remembered\r\nthat I had to return answers to questions in eighteen subjects on which\r\nI had heard lectures delivered, but with regard to some of which I had\r\ntaken no notes and made no preparation whatever. It seems strange that\r\nthe question "How am I going to pass?" should never have entered my\r\nhead, but the truth is that all that winter I had been in such a state\r\nof haze through the delights of being both grown-up and "comme il faut"\r\nthat, whenever the question of the examinations had occurred to me, I\r\nhad mentally compared myself with my comrades, and thought to myself,\r\n"They are certain to pass, and as most of them are not \'comme il faut,\'\r\nand I am therefore their personal superior, I too am bound to come out\r\nall right." In fact, the only reason why I attended lectures at all\r\nwas that I might become an habitue of the University, and obtain Papa\'s\r\nleave to go in and out of the house. Moreover, I had many acquaintances\r\nnow, and often enjoyed myself vastly at the University. I loved the\r\nracket, talking, and laughter in the auditorium, the opportunities for\r\nsitting on a back bench, and letting the measured voice of the professor\r\nlure one into dreams as one contemplated one\'s comrades, the occasional\r\nrunnings across the way for a snack and a glass of vodka (sweetened by\r\nthe fearful joy of knowing that one might be hauled before the professor\r\nfor so doing), the stealthy closing of the door as one returned to the\r\nauditorium, and the participation in "course versus course" scuffles in\r\nthe corridors. All this was very enjoyable.\r\n\r\nBy the time, however, that every one had begun to put in a better\r\nattendance at lectures, and the professor of physics had completed his\r\ncourse and taken his leave of us until the examinations came on, and the\r\nstudents were busy collecting their notebooks and arranging to do their\r\npreparation in parties, it struck me that I also had better prepare\r\nfor the ordeal. Operoff, with whom I still continued on bowing, but\r\notherwise most frigid, terms, suddenly offered not only to lend me his\r\nnotebooks, but to let me do my preparation with himself and some other\r\nstudents. I thanked him, and accepted the invitation--hoping by that\r\nconferment of honour completely to dissipate our old misunderstanding;\r\nbut at the same time I requested that the gatherings should always\r\nbe held at my home, since my quarters were so splendid! To this the\r\nstudents replied that they meant to take turn and turn about--sometimes\r\nto meet at one fellow\'s place, sometimes at another\'s, as might be most\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\nThe first of our reunions was held at Zuchin\'s, who had a small\r\npartition-room in a large building on the Trubni Boulevard. The opening\r\nnight I arrived late, and entered when the reading aloud had already\r\nbegun. The little apartment was thick with tobacco-smoke, while on the\r\ntable stood a bottle of vodka, a decanter, some bread, some salt, and a\r\nshin-bone of mutton. Without rising, Zuchin asked me to have some vodka\r\nand to doff my tunic.\r\n\r\n"I expect you are not accustomed to such entertainment," he added.\r\n\r\nEvery one was wearing a dirty cotton shirt and a dickey. Endeavouring\r\nnot to show my contempt for the company, I took off my tunic, and lay\r\ndown in a sociable manner on the sofa. Zuchin went on reading aloud\r\nand correcting himself with the help of notebooks, while the others\r\noccasionally stopped him to ask a question, which he always answered\r\nwith ability, correctness, and precision. I listened for a time with the\r\nrest, but, not understanding much of it, since I had not been present at\r\nwhat had been read before, soon interpolated a question.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, old fellow! It will be no good for you to listen if you do not\r\nknow the subject," said Zuchin. "I will lend you my notebooks, and then\r\nyou can read it up by to-morrow, and I will explain it to you."\r\n\r\nI felt rather ashamed of my ignorance. Also, I felt the truth of what\r\nhe said; so I gave up listening, and amused myself by observing my\r\nnew comrades. According to my classification of humanity, into persons\r\n"comme il faut" and persons not "comme il faut," they evidently belonged\r\nto the latter category, and so aroused in me not only a feeling of\r\ncontempt, but also a certain sensation of personal hostility, for the\r\nreason that, though not "comme il faut," they accounted me their equal,\r\nand actually patronised me in a sort of good-humoured fashion. What in\r\nparticular excited in me this feeling was their feet, their dirty nails\r\nand fingers, a particularly long talon on Operoff\'s obtrusive\r\nlittle finger, their red shirts, their dickeys, the chaff which they\r\ngood-naturedly threw at one another, the dirty room, a habit which\r\nZuchin had of continually snuffling and pressing a finger to his nose,\r\nand, above all, their manner of speaking--that is to say, their use and\r\nintonation of words. For instance, they said "flat" for fool, "just the\r\nticket" for exactly, "grandly" for splendidly, and so on--all of which\r\nseemed to me either bookish or disagreeably vulgar. Still more was my\r\n"comme il faut" refinement disturbed by the accents which they put upon\r\ncertain Russian--and, still more, upon foreign--words. Thus they said\r\ndieYATelnost for DIEyatelnost, NARochno for naROChno, v\'KAMinie for\r\nv\'kaMINie, SHAKespeare for ShakesPEARe, and so forth.\r\n\r\nYet, for all their insuperably repellent exterior, I could detect\r\nsomething good in these fellows, and envied them the cheerful\r\ngood-fellowship which united them in one. Consequently, I began to feel\r\nattracted towards them, and made up my mind that, come what might, I\r\nwould become of their number. The kind and honourable Operoff I knew\r\nalready, and now the brusque, but exceptionally clever, Zuchin (who\r\nevidently took the lead in this circle) began to please me greatly.\r\nHe was a dark, thick-set little fellow, with a perennially glistening,\r\npolished face, but one that was extremely lively, intellectual, and\r\nindependent in its expression. That expression it derived from a low,\r\nbut prominent, forehead, deep black eyes, short, bristly hair, and a\r\nthick, dark beard which looked as though it stood in constant need of\r\ntrimming. Although, too, he seemed to think nothing of himself (a trail\r\nwhich always pleased me in people), it was clear that he never let his\r\nbrain rest. He had one of those expressive faces which, a few hours\r\nafter you have seen them for the first time, change suddenly and\r\nentirely to your view. Such a change took place, in my eyes, with regard\r\nto Zuchin\'s face towards the end of that evening. Suddenly, I seemed\r\nto see new wrinkles appear upon its surface, its eyes grow deeper, its\r\nsmile become a different one, and the whole face assume such an altered\r\naspect that I scarcely recognised it.\r\n\r\nWhen the reading was ended, Zuchin, the other students, and myself\r\nmanifested our desire to be "comrades all" by drinking vodka until\r\nlittle remained in the bottle. Thereupon Zuchin asked if any one had a\r\nquarter-rouble to spare, so that he could send the old woman who looked\r\nafter him to buy some more; yet, on my offering to provide the money,\r\nhe made as though he had not heard me, and turned to Operoff, who pulled\r\nout a purse sewn with bugles, and handed him the sum required.\r\n\r\n"And mind you don\'t get drunk," added the giver, who himself had not\r\npartaken of the vodka.\r\n\r\n"By heavens!" answered Zuchin as he sucked the marrow out of a mutton\r\nbone (I remember thinking that it must be because he ate marrow that he\r\nwas so clever). "By heavens!" he went on with a slight smile (and his\r\nsmile was of the kind that one involuntarily noticed, and somehow felt\r\ngrateful for), "even if I did get drunk, there would be no great harm\r\ndone. I wonder which of us two could look after himself the better--you\r\nor I? Anyway I am willing to make the experiment," and he slapped his\r\nforehead with mock boastfulness. "But what a pity it is that Semenoff\r\nhas disappeared! He has gone and completely hidden himself somewhere."\r\n\r\nSure enough, the grey-haired Semenoff who had comforted me so much at\r\nmy first examination by being worse dressed than myself, and who, after\r\npassing the second examination, had attended his lectures regularly\r\nduring the first month, had disappeared thereafter from view, and never\r\nbeen seen at the University throughout the latter part of the course.\r\n\r\n"Where is he?" asked some one.\r\n\r\n"I do not know" replied Zuchin. "He has escaped my eye altogether. Yet\r\nwhat fun I used to have with him! What fire there was in the man! and\r\nwhat an intellect! I should be indeed sorry if he has come to grief--and\r\ncome to grief he probably has, for he was no mere boy to take his\r\nUniversity course in instalments."\r\n\r\nAfter a little further conversation, and agreeing to meet again the next\r\nnight at Zuchin\'s, since his abode was the most central point for\r\nus all, we began to disperse. As, one by one, we left the room, my\r\nconscience started pricking me because every one seemed to be going home\r\non foot, whereas I had my drozhki. Accordingly, with some hesitation\r\nI offered Operoff a lift. Zuchin came to the door with us, and, after\r\nborrowing a rouble of Operoff, went off to make a night of it with some\r\nfriends. As we drove along, Operoff told me a good deal about Zuchin\'s\r\ncharacter and mode of life, and on reaching home it was long before I\r\ncould get to sleep for thinking of the new acquaintances I had made. For\r\nmany an hour, as I lay awake, I kept wavering between the respect which\r\ntheir knowledge, simplicity, and sense of honour, as well as the poetry\r\nof their youth and courage, excited in my regard, and the distaste which\r\nI felt for their outward man. In spite of my desire to do so, it was at\r\nthat time literally impossible for me to associate with them, since\r\nour ideas were too wholly at variance. For me, life\'s meaning and charm\r\ncontained an infinitude of shades of which they had not an inkling,\r\nand vice versa. The greatest obstacles of all, however, to our better\r\nacquaintance I felt to be the twenty roubles\' worth of cloth in my\r\ntunic, my drozhki, and my white linen shirt; and they appeared to\r\nme most important obstacles, since they made me feel as though I had\r\nunwittingly insulted these comrades by displaying such tokens of my\r\nwealth. I felt guilty in their eyes, and as though, whether I accepted\r\nor rejected their acquittal and took a line of my own, I could never\r\nenter into equal and unaffected relations with them. Yet to such an\r\nextent did the stirring poetry of the courage which I could detect in\r\nZuchin (in particular) overshadow the coarse, vicious side of his nature\r\nthat the latter made no unpleasant impression upon me.\r\n\r\nFor a couple of weeks I visited Zuchin\'s almost every night for purposes\r\nof work. Yet I did very little there, since, as I have said, I had lost\r\nground at the start, and, not having sufficient grit in me to catch up\r\nmy companions by solitary study, was forced merely to PRETEND that I was\r\nlistening to and taking in all they were reading. I have an idea, too,\r\nthat they divined my pretence, since I often noticed that they passed\r\nover points which they themselves knew without first inquiring of me\r\nwhether I did the same. Yet, day by day, I was coming to regard the\r\nvulgarity of this circle with more indulgence, to feel increasingly\r\ndrawn towards its way of life, and to find in it much that was poetical.\r\nOnly my word of honour to Dimitri that I would never indulge in\r\ndissipation with these new comrades kept me from deciding also to share\r\ntheir diversions.\r\n\r\nOnce, I thought I would make a display of my knowledge of literature,\r\nparticularly French literature, and so led the conversation to that\r\ntheme. Judge, then, of my surprise when I discovered that not only had\r\nmy companions been reading the foreign passages in Russian, but that\r\nthey had studied far more foreign works than I had, and knew and could\r\nappraise English, and even Spanish, writers of whom I had never so\r\nmuch as heard! Likewise, Pushkin and Zhukovski represented to them\r\nLITERATURE, and not, as to myself, certain books in yellow covers which\r\nI had once read and studied when a child. For Dumas and Sue they had\r\nan almost equal contempt, and, in general, were competent to form much\r\nbetter and clearer judgments on literary matters than I was, for all\r\nthat I refused to recognise the fact. In knowledge of music, too, I\r\ncould not beat them, and was astonished to find that Operoff played the\r\nviolin, and another student the cello and piano, while both of them were\r\nmembers of the University orchestra, and possessed a wide knowledge\r\nof and appreciation of good music. In short, with the exception of the\r\nFrench and German languages, my companions were better posted at every\r\npoint than I was, yet not the least proud of the fact. True, I might\r\nhave plumed myself on my position as a man of the world, but Woloda\r\nexcelled me even in that. Wherein, then, lay the height from which I\r\npresumed to look down upon these comrades? In my acquaintanceship with\r\nPrince Ivan Ivanovitch? In my ability to speak French? In my drozhki?\r\nIn my linen shirt? In my finger-nails? "Surely these things are all\r\nrubbish," was the thought which would come flitting through my head\r\nunder the influence of the envy which the good-fellowship and kindly,\r\nyouthful gaiety displayed around me excited in my breast. Every one\r\naddressed his interlocutor in the second person singular. True, the\r\nfamiliarity of this address almost approximated to rudeness, yet\r\neven the boorish exterior of the speaker could not conceal a constant\r\nendeavour never to hurt another one\'s feelings. The terms "brute" or\r\n"swine," when used in this good-natured fashion, only convulsed me, and\r\ngave me cause for inward merriment. In no way did they offend the person\r\naddressed, or prevent the company at large from remaining on the most\r\nsincere and friendly footing. In all their intercourse these youths were\r\ndelicate and forbearing in a way that only very poor and very young men\r\ncan be. However much I might detect in Zuchin\'s character and amusements\r\nan element of coarseness and profligacy, I could also detect the fact\r\nthat his drinking-bouts were of a very different order to the puerility\r\nwith burnt rum and champagne in which I had participated at Baron Z.\'s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV. ZUCHIN AND SEMENOFF\r\n\r\nAlthough I do not know what class of society Zuchin belonged to, I\r\nknow that, without the help either of means or social position, he\r\nhad matriculated from the Seventh Gymnasium. At that time he was\r\neighteen--though he looked much older--and very clever, especially in\r\nhis powers of assimilation. To him it was easier to survey the whole of\r\nsome complicated subject, to foresee its various parts and deductions,\r\nthan to use that knowledge, when gained, for reasoning out the exact\r\nlaws to which those deductions were due. He knew that he was clever,\r\nand of the fact he was proud; yet from that very pride arose the\r\ncircumstance that he treated every one with unvarying simplicity\r\nand good-nature. Moreover, his experience of life must have been\r\nconsiderable, for already he had squandered much love, friendship,\r\nactivity, and money. Though poor and moving only in the lower ranks of\r\nsociety, there was nothing which he had ever attempted for which he\r\ndid not thenceforth feel the contempt, the indifference, or the utter\r\ndisregard which were bound to result from his attaining his goal too\r\neasily. In fact, the very ardour with which he applied himself to a\r\nnew pursuit seemed to be due to his contempt for what he had already\r\nattained, since his abilities always led him to success, and therefore\r\nto a certain right to despise it. With the sciences it was the\r\nsame. Though little interested in them, and taking no notes, he knew\r\nmathematics thoroughly, and was uttering no vain boast when he said\r\nthat he could beat the professor himself. Much of what he heard said\r\nin lectures he thought rubbish, yet with his peculiar habit of\r\nunconsciously practical roguishness he feigned to subscribe to all that\r\nthe professors thought important, and every professor adored him. True,\r\nhe was outspoken to the authorities, but they none the less respected\r\nhim. Besides disliking and despising the sciences, he despised all who\r\nlaboured to attain what he himself had mastered so easily, since the\r\nsciences, as he understood them, did not occupy one-tenth part of his\r\npowers. In fact, life, as he saw it from the student\'s standpoint,\r\ncontained nothing to which he could devote himself wholly, and his\r\nimpetuous, active nature (as he himself often said) demanded life\r\ncomplete: wherefore he frequented the drinking-bout in so far as he\r\ncould afford it, and surrendered himself to dissipation chiefly out of\r\na desire to get as far away from himself as possible. Consequently,\r\njust as the examinations were approaching, Operoff\'s prophecy to me came\r\ntrue, for Zuchin wasted two whole weeks in this fashion, and we had to\r\ndo the latter part of our preparation at another student\'s. Yet at the\r\nfirst examination he reappeared with pale, haggard face and tremulous\r\nhands, and passed brilliantly into the second course!\r\n\r\nThe company of roisterers of which Zuchin had been the leader since\r\nits formation at the beginning of the term consisted of eight students,\r\namong whom, at first, had been numbered Ikonin and Semenoff; but the\r\nformer had left under the strain of the continuous revelry in which the\r\nband had indulged in the early part of the term, and the latter seceded\r\nlater for reasons which were never wholly explained. In its early\r\ndays this band had been looked upon with awe by all the fellows of our\r\ncourse, and had had its exploits much discussed. Of these exploits\r\nthe leading heroes had been Zuchin and, towards the end of the term,\r\nSemenoff, but the latter had come to be generally shunned, and to cause\r\ndisturbances on the rare occasions when he attended a lecture. Just\r\nbefore the examinations began, he rounded off his drinking exploits in a\r\nmost energetic and original fashion, as I myself had occasion to witness\r\n(through my acquaintanceship with Zuchin). This is how it was. One\r\nevening we had just assembled at Zuchin\'s, and Operoff, reinforcing a\r\ncandlestick with a candle stuck in a bottle, had just plunged his nose\r\ninto his notebooks and begun to read aloud in his thin voice from his\r\nneatly-written notes on physics, when the landlady entered the room,\r\nand informed Zuchin that some one had brought a note for him... [The\r\nremainder of this chapter is omitted in the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV. I COME TO GRIEF\r\n\r\nAt length the first examination--on differentials and integrals--drew\r\nnear, but I continued in a vague state which precluded me from forming\r\nany clear idea of what was awaiting me. Every evening, after consorting\r\nwith Zuchin and the rest, the thought would occur to me that there was\r\nsomething in my convictions which I must change--something wrong and\r\nmistaken; yet every morning the daylight would find me again satisfied\r\nto be "comme il faut," and desirous of no change whatsoever.\r\n\r\nSuch was the frame of mind in which I attended for the first\r\nexamination. I seated myself on the bench where the princes, counts,\r\nand barons always sat, and began talking to them in French, with the not\r\nunnatural result that I never gave another thought to the answers\r\nwhich I was shortly to return to questions in a subject of which I\r\nknew nothing. I gazed supinely at other students as they went up to be\r\nexamined, and even allowed myself to chaff some of them.\r\n\r\n"Well, Grap," I said to Ilinka (who, from our first entry into the\r\nUniversity, had shaken off my influence, had ceased to smile when I\r\nspoke to him, and always remained ill-disposed towards me), "have you\r\nsurvived the ordeal?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," retorted Ilinka. "Let us see if YOU can do so."\r\n\r\nI smiled contemptuously at the answer, notwithstanding that the doubt\r\nwhich he had expressed had given me a momentary shock. Once again,\r\nhowever, indifference overlaid that feeling, and I remained so entirely\r\nabsent-minded and supine that, the very moment after I had been examined\r\n(a mere formality for me, as it turned out) I was making a dinner\r\nappointment with Baron Z. When called out with Ikonin, I smoothed\r\nthe creases in my uniform, and walked up to the examiner\'s table with\r\nperfect sang froid.\r\n\r\nTrue, a slight shiver of apprehension ran down my back when the young\r\nprofessor--the same one as had examined me for my matriculation--looked\r\nme straight in the face as I reached across to the envelope containing\r\nthe tickets. Ikonin, though taking a ticket with the same plunge of his\r\nwhole body as he had done at the previous examinations, did at least\r\nreturn some sort of an answer this time, though a poor one. I, on the\r\ncontrary, did just as he had done on the two previous occasions, or even\r\nworse, since I took a second ticket, yet for a second time returned no\r\nanswer. The professor looked me compassionately in the face, and said in\r\na quiet, but determined, voice:\r\n\r\n"You will not pass into the second course, Monsieur Irtenieff. You had\r\nbetter not complete the examinations. The faculty must be weeded out.\r\nThe same with you, Monsieur Ikonin."\r\n\r\nIkonin implored leave to finish the examinations, as a great favour, but\r\nthe professor replied that he (Ikonin) was not likely to do in two days\r\nwhat he had not succeeded in doing in a year, and that he had not the\r\nsmallest chance of passing. Ikonin renewed his humble, piteous appeals,\r\nbut the professor was inexorable.\r\n\r\n"You can go, gentlemen," he remarked in the same quiet, resolute voice.\r\n\r\nI was only too glad to do so, for I felt ashamed of seeming, by my\r\nsilent presence, to be joining in Ikonin\'s humiliating prayers for\r\ngrace. I have no recollection of how I threaded my way through the\r\nstudents in the hall, nor of what I replied to their questions, nor\r\nof how I passed into the vestibule and departed home. I was offended,\r\nhumiliated, and genuinely unhappy.\r\n\r\nFor three days I never left my room, and saw no one, but found relief\r\nin copious tears. I should have sought a pistol to shoot myself if I had\r\nhad the necessary determination for the deed. I thought that Ilinka Grap\r\nwould spit in my face when he next met me, and that he would have the\r\nright to do so; that Operoff would rejoice at my misfortune, and tell\r\nevery one of it; that Kolpikoff had justly shamed me that night at the\r\nrestaurant; that my stupid speeches to Princess Kornikoff had had their\r\nfitting result; and so on, and so on. All the moments in my life which\r\nhad been for me most difficult and painful recurred to my mind. I tried\r\nto blame some one for my calamity, and thought that some one must have\r\ndone it on purpose--must have conspired a whole intrigue against me.\r\nNext, I murmured against the professors, against my comrades, Woloda,\r\nDimitri, and Papa (the last for having sent me to the University at\r\nall). Finally, I railed at Providence for ever having let me see such\r\nignominy. Believing myself ruined for ever in the eyes of all who knew\r\nme, I besought Papa to let me go into the hussars or to the Caucasus.\r\nNaturally, Papa was anything but pleased at what had happened; yet, on\r\nseeing my passionate grief, he comforted me by saying that, though it\r\nwas a bad business, it might yet be mended by my transferring to another\r\nfaculty. Woloda, who also saw nothing very terrible in my misfortune,\r\nadded that at least I should not be put out of countenance in a new\r\nfaculty, since I should have new comrades there. As for the ladies of\r\nthe household, they neither knew nor cared what either an examination or\r\na plucking meant, and condoled with me only because they saw me in\r\nsuch distress. Dimitri came to see me every day, and was very kind and\r\nconsolatory throughout; but for that very reason he seemed to me to\r\nhave grown colder than before. It always hurt me and made me feel\r\nuncomfortable when he came up to my room and seated himself in silence\r\nbeside me, much as a doctor might scat himself by the bedside of an\r\nawkward patient. Sophia Ivanovna and Varenika sent me books for which I\r\nhad expressed a wish, as also an invitation to go and see them, but\r\nin that very thoughtfulness of theirs I saw only proud, humiliating\r\ncondescension to one who had fallen beyond forgiveness. Although, in\r\nthree days\' time, I grew calmer, it was not until we departed for the\r\ncountry that I left the house, but spent the time in nursing my grief\r\nand wandering, fearful of all the household, through the various rooms.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as I was sitting deep in thought and listening to Avdotia\r\nplaying her waltz, I suddenly leapt to my feet, ran upstairs, got out\r\nthe copy-book whereon I had once inscribed "Rules of My Life," opened\r\nit, and experienced my first moment of repentance and moral resolution.\r\nTrue, I burst into tears once more, but they were no longer tears of\r\ndespair. Pulling myself together, I set about writing out a fresh set\r\nof rules, in the assured conviction that never again would I do a wrong\r\naction, waste a single moment on frivolity, or alter the rules which I\r\nnow decided to frame.\r\n\r\nHow long that moral impulse lasted, what it consisted of, and what new\r\nprinciples I devised for my moral growth I will relate when speaking of\r\nthe ensuing and happier portion of my early manhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Youth, by Leo Tolstoy\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK YOUTH ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2637.txt or 2637.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/6/3/2637/\r\n\r\nProduced by Martin Adamson\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
