I have a profound affection for Tarleton, but\r\nsomehow whenever I write a story about it I receive letters from all\r\nover the South denouncing me in no uncertain terms. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jelly-Bean,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npublished in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Metropolitan,\xe2\x80\x9d drew its full share of these\r\nadmonitory notes._\r\n\r\n_It was written under strange circumstances shortly after my first\r\nnovel was published, and, moreover, it was the first story in which I\r\nhad a collaborator. For, finding that I was unable to manage the\r\ncrap-shooting episode, I turned it over to my wife, who, as a Southern\r\ngirl, was presumably an expert on the technique and terminology of\r\nthat great sectional pastime._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMEL\xe2\x80\x99S BACK\r\n\r\n_I suppose that of all the stories I have ever written this one cost me\r\nthe least travail and perhaps gave me the most amusement. As to the\r\nlabor involved, it was written during one day in the city of New\r\nOrleans, with the express purpose of buying a platinum and diamond\r\nwrist watch which cost six hundred dollars. I began it at seven in the\r\nmorning and finished it at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock the same night. It was\r\npublished in the \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Evening Post\xe2\x80\x9d in 1920, and later included\r\nin the O. Henry Memorial Collection for the same year. I like it least\r\nof all the stories in this volume._\r\n\r\n_My amusement was derived from the fact that the camel part of the\r\nstory is literally true; in fact, I have a standing engagement with\r\nthe gentleman involved to attend the next fancy-dress party to which\r\nwe are mutually invited, attired as the latter part of the camel--this\r\nas a sort of atonement for being his historian._\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY DAY\r\n\r\n_This somewhat unpleasant tale, published as a novelette in the \xe2\x80\x9cSmart\r\nSet\xe2\x80\x9d in July, 1920, relates a series of events which took place in the\r\nspring of the previous year. Each of the three events made a great\r\nimpression upon me. In life they were unrelated, except by the general\r\nhysteria of that spring which inaugurated the Age of Jazz, but in my\r\nstory I have tried, unsuccessfully I fear, to weave them into a\r\npattern--a pattern which would give the effect of those months in New\r\nYork as they appeared to at least one member of what was then the\r\nyounger generation._\r\n\r\n\r\nPORCELAIN AND PINK\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you write for any other magazines?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the young lady._\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d I assured her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had some stories and plays in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Smart Set,\xe2\x80\x99 for instance----\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n_The young lady shivered._\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Smart Set\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you? Why, they publish\r\nstuff about girls in blue bathtubs, and silly things like that.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n_And I had the magnificent joy of telling her that she was referring to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorcelain and Pink,\xe2\x80\x9d which had appeared there several months before._\r\n\r\n\r\nFANTASIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAMOND AS BIG AS THE RITZ\r\n\r\n_These next stories are written in what, were I of imposing stature, I\r\nshould call my \xe2\x80\x9csecond manner.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Diamond as Big as the Ritz,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich appeared last summer in the \xe2\x80\x9cSmart Set,\xe2\x80\x9d was designed utterly\r\nfor my own amusement. I was in that familiar mood characterized by a\r\nperfect craving for luxury, and the story began as an attempt to feed\r\nthat craving on imaginary foods._\r\n\r\n_One well-known critic has been pleased to like this extravaganza\r\nbetter than anything I have written. Personally I prefer \xe2\x80\x9cThe Offshore\r\nPirate.\xe2\x80\x9d But, to tamper slightly with Lincoln: If you like this sort\r\nof thing, this, possibly, is the sort of thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll like._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON\r\n\r\n_This story was inspired by a remark of Mark Twain\xe2\x80\x99s to the effect that\r\nit was a pity that the best part of life came at the beginning and the\r\nworst part at the end. By trying the experiment upon only one man in a\r\nperfectly normal world I have scarcely given his idea a fair trial.\r\nSeveral weeks after completing it, I discovered an almost identical\r\nplot in Samuel Butler\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNote-books.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n_The story was published in \xe2\x80\x9cCollier\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d last summer and provoked this\r\nstartling letter from an anonymous admirer in Cincinnati:_\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cSir--_\r\n\r\n_I have read the story Benjamin Button in Colliers and I wish to say\r\nthat as a short story writer you would make a good lunatic I have seen\r\nmany peices of cheese in my life but of all the peices of cheese I\r\nhave ever seen you are the biggest peice. I hate to waste a peice of\r\nstationary on you but I will.\xe2\x80\x9c_\r\n\r\n\r\nTARQUIN OF CHEAPSIDE\r\n\r\n_Written almost six years ago, this story is a product of undergraduate\r\ndays at Princeton. Considerably revised, it was published in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmart Set\xe2\x80\x9d in 1921. At the time of its conception I had but one\r\nidea--to be a poet--and the fact that I was interested in the ring of\r\nevery phrase, that I dreaded the obvious in prose if not in plot,\r\nshows throughout. Probably the peculiar affection I feel for it\r\ndepends more upon its age than upon any intrinsic merit._\r\n\r\n\r\nO RUSSET WITCH!\r\n\r\n_When this was written I had just completed the first draft of my\r\nsecond novel, and a natural reaction made me revel in a story wherein\r\nnone of the characters need be taken seriously. And I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that I\r\nwas somewhat carried away by the feeling that there was no ordered\r\nscheme to which I must conform. After due consideration, however, I\r\nhave decided to let it stand as it is, although the reader may find\r\nhimself somewhat puzzled at the time element. I had best say that\r\nhowever the years may have dealt with Merlin Grainger, I myself was\r\nthinking always in the present. It was published in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMetropolitan.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLASSIFIED MASTERPIECES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEES OF HAPPINESS\r\n\r\n_Of this story I can say that it came to me in an irresistible form,\r\ncrying to be written. It will be accused perhaps of being a mere piece\r\nof sentimentality, but, as I saw it, it was a great deal more. If,\r\ntherefore, it lacks the ring of sincerity, or even, of tragedy, the\r\nfault rests not with the theme but with my handling of it._\r\n\r\n_It appeared in the \xe2\x80\x9cChicago Tribune,\xe2\x80\x9d and later obtained, I believe,\r\nthe quadruple gold laurel leaf or some such encomium from one of the\r\nanthologists who at present swarm among us. The gentleman I refer to\r\nruns as a rule to stark melodramas with a volcano or the ghost of John\r\nPaul Jones in the role of Nemesis, melodramas carefully disguised by\r\nearly paragraphs in Jamesian manner which hint dark and subtle\r\ncomplexities to follow. On this order:_\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cThe case of Shaw McPhee, curiously enough, had no bearing on the\r\nalmost incredible attitude of Martin Sulo. This is parenthetical and,\r\nto at least three observers, whose names for the present I must\r\nconceal, it seems improbable, etc., etc., etc.,\xe2\x80\x9d until the poor rat of\r\nfiction is at last forced out into the open and the melodrama begins._\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ICKY\r\n\r\n_This has the distinction of being the only magazine piece ever written\r\nin a New York hotel. The business was done in a bedroom in the\r\nKnickerbocker, and shortly afterward that memorable hostelry closed\r\nits doors forever._\r\n\r\n_When a fitting period of mourning had elapsed it was published in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmart Set.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\nJEMINA\r\n\r\n_Written, like \xe2\x80\x9cTarquin of Cheapside,\xe2\x80\x9d while I was at Princeton, this\r\nsketch was published years later in \xe2\x80\x9cVanity Fair.\xe2\x80\x9d For its technique I\r\nmust apologize to Mr. Stephen Leacock._\r\n\r\n_I have laughed over it a great deal, especially when I first wrote it,\r\nbut I can laugh over it no longer. Still, as other people tell me it\r\nis amusing, I include it here. It seems to me worth preserving a few\r\nyears--at least until the ennui of changing fashions suppresses me, my\r\nbooks, and it together._\r\n\r\n_With due apologies for this impossible Table of Contents, I tender\r\nthese tales of the Jazz Age into the hands of those who read as they\r\nrun and run as they read._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MY LAST FLAPPERS_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JELLY-BEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nJim Powell was a Jelly-bean. Much as I desire to make him an appealing\r\ncharacter, I feel that it would be unscrupulous to deceive you on that\r\npoint. He was a bred-in-the-bone, dyed-in-the-wool, ninety-nine\r\nthree-quarters per cent Jelly-bean and he grew lazily all during\r\nJelly-bean season, which is every season, down in the land of the\r\nJelly-beans well below the Mason-Dixon line.\r\n\r\nNow if you call a Memphis man a Jelly-bean he will quite possibly pull\r\na long sinewy rope from his hip pocket and hang you to a convenient\r\ntelegraph-pole. If you call a New Orleans man a Jelly-bean he will\r\nprobably grin and ask you who is taking your girl to the Mardi Gras\r\nball. The particular Jelly-bean patch which produced the protagonist\r\nof this history lies somewhere between the two--a little city of forty\r\nthousand that has dozed sleepily for forty thousand years in southern\r\nGeorgia, occasionally stirring in its slumbers and muttering something\r\nabout a war that took place sometime, somewhere, and that everyone\r\nelse has forgotten long ago.\r\n\r\nJim was a Jelly-bean. I write that again because it has such a\r\npleasant sound--rather like the beginning of a fairy story--as if Jim\r\nwere nice. It somehow gives me a picture of him with a round,\r\nappetizing face and all sort of leaves and vegetables growing out of\r\nhis cap. But Jim was long and thin and bent at the waist from stooping\r\nover pool-tables, and he was what might have been known in the\r\nindiscriminating North as a corner loafer. \xe2\x80\x9cJelly-bean\xe2\x80\x9d is the name\r\nthroughout the undissolved Confederacy for one who spends his life\r\nconjugating the verb to idle in the first person singular--I am\r\nidling, I have idled, I will idle.\r\n\r\nJim was born in a white house on a green corner. It had four\r\nweather-beaten pillars in front and a great amount of lattice-work in\r\nthe rear that made a cheerful criss-cross background for a flowery\r\nsun-drenched lawn. Originally the dwellers in the white house had\r\nowned the ground next door and next door to that and next door to\r\nthat, but this had been so long ago that even Jim\xe2\x80\x99s father scarcely\r\nremembered it. He had, in fact, thought it a matter of so little\r\nmoment that when he was dying from a pistol wound got in a brawl he\r\nneglected even to tell little Jim, who was five years old and\r\nmiserably frightened. The white house became a boarding-house run by a\r\ntight-lipped lady from Macon, whom Jim called Aunt Mamie and detested\r\nwith all his soul.\r\n\r\nHe became fifteen, went to high school, wore his hair in black snarls,\r\nand was afraid of girls. He hated his home where four women and one\r\nold man prolonged an interminable chatter from summer to summer about\r\nwhat lots the Powell place had originally included and what sorts of\r\nflowers would be out next. Sometimes the parents of little girls in\r\ntown, remembering Jim\xe2\x80\x99s mother and fancying a resemblance in the dark\r\neyes and hair, invited him to parties, but parties made him shy and he\r\nmuch preferred sitting on a disconnected axle in Tilly\xe2\x80\x99s Garage,\r\nrolling the bones or exploring his mouth endlessly with a long straw.\r\nFor pocket money, he picked up odd jobs, and it was due to this that\r\nhe stopped going to parties. At his third party little Marjorie Haight\r\nhad whispered indiscreetly and within hearing distance that he was a\r\nboy who brought the groceries sometimes. So instead of the two-step\r\nand polka, Jim had learned to throw any number he desired on the dice\r\nand had listened to spicy tales of all the shootings that had occurred\r\nin the surrounding country during the past fifty years.\r\n\r\nHe became eighteen. The war broke out and he enlisted as a gob and\r\npolished brass in the Charleston Navy-yard for a year. Then, by way of\r\nvariety, he went North and polished brass in the Brooklyn Navy-yard\r\nfor a year.\r\n\r\nWhen the war was over he came home. He was twenty-one, his trousers\r\nwere too short and too tight. His buttoned shoes were long and narrow.\r\nHis tie was an alarming conspiracy of purple and pink marvellously\r\nscrolled, and over it were two blue eyes faded like a piece of very\r\ngood old cloth long exposed to the sun.\r\n\r\nIn the twilight of one April evening when a soft gray had drifted down\r\nalong the cottonfields and over the sultry town, he was a vague figure\r\nleaning against a board fence, whistling and gazing at the moon\xe2\x80\x99s rim\r\nabove the lights of Jackson Street. His mind was working persistently\r\non a problem that had held his attention for an hour. The Jelly-bean had\r\nbeen invited to a party.\r\n\r\nBack in the days when all the boys had detested all the girls, Clark\r\nDarrow and Jim had sat side by side in school. But, while Jim\xe2\x80\x99s social\r\naspirations had died in the oily air of the garage, Clark had\r\nalternately fallen in and out of love, gone to college, taken to\r\ndrink, given it up, and, in short, become one of the best beaux of the\r\ntown. Nevertheless Clark and Jim had retained a friendship that,\r\nthough casual, was perfectly definite. That afternoon Clark\xe2\x80\x99s ancient\r\nFord had slowed up beside Jim, who was on the sidewalk and, out of a\r\nclear sky, Clark invited him to a party at the country club. The\r\nimpulse that made him do this was no stranger than the impulse which\r\nmade Jim accept. The latter was probably an unconscious ennui, a\r\nhalf-frightened sense of adventure. And now Jim was soberly thinking\r\nit over.\r\n\r\nHe began to sing, drumming his long foot idly on a stone block in the\r\nsidewalk till it wobbled up and down in time to the low throaty tune:\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9c_One smile from Home in Jelly-bean town,\r\n   Lives Jeanne, the Jelly-bean Queen.\r\n   She loves her dice and treats \xe2\x80\x99em nice;\r\n   No dice would treat her mean._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off and agitated the sidewalk to a bumpy gallop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaggone!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, half aloud. They would all be there--the old\r\ncrowd, the crowd to which, by right of the white house, sold long\r\nsince, and the portrait of the officer in gray over the mantel, Jim\r\nshould have belonged. But that crowd had grown up together into a\r\ntight little set as gradually as the girls\xe2\x80\x99 dresses had lengthened\r\ninch by inch, as definitely as the boys\xe2\x80\x99 trousers had dropped suddenly\r\nto their ankles. And to that society of first names and dead puppy\r\nloves Jim was an outsider--a running mate of poor whites. Most of the\r\nmen knew him, condescendingly; he tipped his hat to three or four\r\ngirls. That was all.\r\n\r\nWhen the dusk had thickened into a blue setting for the moon, he\r\nwalked through the hot, pleasantly pungent town to Jackson Street. The\r\nstores were closing and the last shoppers were drifting homeward, as\r\nif borne on the dreamy revolution of a slow merry-go-round. A\r\nstreet-fair farther down made a brilliant alley of varicolored booths\r\nand contributed a blend of music to the night--an oriental dance on a\r\ncalliope, a melancholy bugle in front of a freak show, a cheerful\r\nrendition of \xe2\x80\x9cBack Home in Tennessee\xe2\x80\x9d on a hand-organ.\r\n\r\nThe Jelly-bean stopped in a store and bought a collar. Then he\r\nsauntered along toward Soda Sam\xe2\x80\x99s, where he found the usual three or\r\nfour cars of a summer evening parked in front and the little darkies\r\nrunning back and forth with sundaes and lemonades.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Jim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a voice at his elbow--Joe Ewing sitting in an automobile with\r\nMarylyn Wade. Nancy Lamar and a strange man were in the back seat.\r\n\r\nThe Jelly-bean tipped his hat quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi, Ben--\xe2\x80\x9d then, after an almost imperceptible pause--\xe2\x80\x9cHow y\xe2\x80\x99 all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPassing, he ambled on toward the garage where he had a room up-stairs.\r\nHis \xe2\x80\x9cHow y\xe2\x80\x99all\xe2\x80\x9d had been said to Nancy Lamar, to whom he had not\r\nspoken in fifteen years.\r\n\r\nNancy had a mouth like a remembered kiss and shadowy eyes and\r\nblue-black hair inherited from her mother who had been born in\r\nBudapest. Jim passed her often on the street, walking small-boy\r\nfashion with her hands in her pockets and he knew that with her\r\ninseparable Sally Carrol Hopper she had left a trail of broken hearts\r\nfrom Atlanta to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nFor a few fleeting moments Jim wished he could dance. Then he laughed\r\nand as he reached his door began to sing softly to himself:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c_Her Jelly Roll can twist your soul,\r\n  Her eyes are big and brown,\r\n  She\xe2\x80\x99s the Queen of the Queens of the Jelly-beans--\r\n  My Jeanne of Jelly-bean Town._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAt nine-thirty, Jim and Clark met in front of Soda Sam\xe2\x80\x99s and started\r\nfor the Country Club in Clark\xe2\x80\x99s Ford. \xe2\x80\x9cJim,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Clark casually, as\r\nthey rattled through the jasmine-scented night, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you keep\r\nalive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jelly-bean paused, considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally, \xe2\x80\x9cI got a room over Tilly\xe2\x80\x99s garage. I help him\r\nsome with the cars in the afternoon an\xe2\x80\x99 he gives it to me free.\r\nSometimes I drive one of his taxies and pick up a little thataway. I\r\nget fed up doin\xe2\x80\x99 that regular though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work I help him by the day--Saturdays\r\nusually--and then there\xe2\x80\x99s one main source of revenue I don\xe2\x80\x99t generally\r\nmention. Maybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t recollect I\xe2\x80\x99m about the champion crap-shooter\r\nof this town. They make me shoot from a cup now because once I get the\r\nfeel of a pair of dice they just roll for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClark grinned appreciatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never could learn to set \xe2\x80\x99em so\xe2\x80\x99s they\xe2\x80\x99d do what I wanted. Wish\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d shoot with Nancy Lamar some day and take all her money away from\r\nher. She will roll \xe2\x80\x99em with the boys and she loses more than her daddy\r\ncan afford to give her. I happen to know she sold a good ring last\r\nmonth to pay a debt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jelly-bean was noncommittal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe white house on Elm Street still belong to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSold. Got a pretty good price, seein\xe2\x80\x99 it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in a good part of\r\ntown no more. Lawyer told me to put it into Liberty bonds. But Aunt\r\nMamie got so she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have no sense, so it takes all the interest to\r\nkeep her up at Great Farms Sanitarium.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got an old uncle up-state an\xe2\x80\x99 I reckin I kin go up there if ever I\r\nget sure enough pore. Nice farm, but not enough niggers around to work\r\nit. He\xe2\x80\x99s asked me to come up and help him, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t guess I\xe2\x80\x99d take\r\nmuch to it. Too doggone lonesome--\xe2\x80\x9d He broke off suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cClark, I\r\nwant to tell you I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you for askin\xe2\x80\x99 me out, but I\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\na lot happier if you\xe2\x80\x99d just stop the car right here an\xe2\x80\x99 let me walk\r\nback into town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShucks!\xe2\x80\x9d Clark grunted. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you good to step out. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to\r\ndance--just get out there on the floor and shake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Jim uneasily, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you go leadin\xe2\x80\x99 me up to any\r\ngirls and leavin\xe2\x80\x99 me there so I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to dance with \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClark laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Cause,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Jim desperately, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout you swear you won\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99m agoin\xe2\x80\x99 to get out right here an\xe2\x80\x99 my good legs goin\xe2\x80\x99 carry me\r\nback to Jackson street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey agreed after some argument that Jim, unmolested by females, was\r\nto view the spectacle from a secluded settee in the corner where Clark\r\nwould join him whenever he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dancing.\r\n\r\nSo ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock found the Jelly-bean with his legs crossed and his arms\r\nconservatively folded, trying to look casually at home and politely\r\nuninterested in the dancers. At heart he was torn between overwhelming\r\nself-consciousness and an intense curiosity as to all that went on\r\naround him. He saw the girls emerge one by one from the dressing-room,\r\nstretching and pluming themselves like bright birds, smiling over\r\ntheir powdered shoulders at the chaperones, casting a quick glance\r\naround to take in the room and, simultaneously, the room\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to\r\ntheir entrance--and then, again like birds, alighting and nestling in\r\nthe sober arms of their waiting escorts. Sally Carrol Hopper, blonde\r\nand lazy-eyed, appeared clad in her favorite pink and blinking like an\r\nawakened rose. Marjorie Haight, Marylyn Wade, Harriet Cary, all the\r\ngirls he had seen loitering down Jackson Street by noon, now, curled\r\nand brilliantined and delicately tinted for the overhead lights, were\r\nmiraculously strange Dresden figures of pink and blue and red and\r\ngold, fresh from the shop and not yet fully dried.\r\n\r\nHe had been there half an hour, totally uncheered by Clark\xe2\x80\x99s jovial\r\nvisits which were each one accompanied by a \xe2\x80\x9cHello, old boy, how you\r\nmaking out?\xe2\x80\x9d and a slap at his knee. A dozen males had spoken to him\r\nor stopped for a moment beside him, but he knew that they were each\r\none surprised at finding him there and fancied that one or two were\r\neven slightly resentful. But at half past ten his embarrassment\r\nsuddenly left him and a pull of breathless interest took him\r\ncompletely out of himself--Nancy Lamar had come out of the\r\ndressing-room.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in yellow organdie, a costume of a hundred cool\r\ncorners, with three tiers of ruffles and a big bow in back until she\r\nshed black and yellow around her in a sort of phosphorescent lustre.\r\nThe Jelly-bean\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened wide and a lump arose in his throat. For\r\nshe stood beside the door until her partner hurried up. Jim recognized\r\nhim as the stranger who had been with her in Joe Ewing\xe2\x80\x99s car that\r\nafternoon. He saw her set her arms akimbo and say something in a low\r\nvoice, and laugh. The man laughed too and Jim experienced the quick\r\npang of a weird new kind of pain. Some ray had passed between the\r\npair, a shaft of beauty from that sun that had warmed him a moment\r\nsince. The Jelly-bean felt suddenly like a weed in a shadow.\r\n\r\nA minute later Clark approached him, bright-eyed and glowing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried with some lack of originality. \xe2\x80\x9cHow you making\r\nout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim replied that he was making out as well as could be expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come along with me,\xe2\x80\x9d commanded Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got something that\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nput an edge on the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim followed him awkwardly across the floor and up the stairs to the\r\nlocker-room where Clark produced a flask of nameless yellow liquid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood old corn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGinger ale arrived on a tray. Such potent nectar as \xe2\x80\x9cgood old corn\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nneeded some disguise beyond seltzer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Clark breathlessly, \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t Nancy Lamar look\r\nbeautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMighty beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s all dolled up to a fare-you-well to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Clark.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNotice that fellow she\xe2\x80\x99s with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBig fella? White pants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s Ogden Merritt from Savannah. Old man Merritt makes\r\nthe Merritt safety razors. This fella\xe2\x80\x99s crazy about her. Been chasing\r\nafter her all year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a wild baby,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Clark, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I like her. So does\r\neverybody. But she sure does do crazy stunts. She usually gets out\r\nalive, but she\xe2\x80\x99s got scars all over her reputation from one thing or\r\nanother she\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat so?\xe2\x80\x9d Jim passed over his glass. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s good corn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so bad. Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s a wild one. Shoot craps, say, boy! And she do\r\nlike her high-balls. Promised I\xe2\x80\x99d give her one later on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe in love with this--Merritt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamned if I know. Seems like all the best girls around here marry\r\nfellas and go off somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe poured himself one more drink and carefully corked the bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Jim, I got to go dance and I\xe2\x80\x99d be much obliged if you just\r\nstick this corn right on your hip as long as you\xe2\x80\x99re not dancing. If a\r\nman notices I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a drink he\xe2\x80\x99ll come up and ask me and before I\r\nknow it it\xe2\x80\x99s all gone and somebody else is having my good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Nancy Lamar was going to marry. This toast of a town was to become\r\nthe private property of an individual in white trousers--and all\r\nbecause white trousers\xe2\x80\x99 father had made a better razor than his\r\nneighbor. As they descended the stairs Jim found the idea inexplicably\r\ndepressing. For the first time in his life he felt a vague and\r\nromantic yearning. A picture of her began to form in his\r\nimagination--Nancy walking boylike and debonnaire along the street,\r\ntaking an orange as tithe from a worshipful fruit-dealer, charging a\r\ndope on a mythical account at Soda Sam\xe2\x80\x99s, assembling a convoy of\r\nbeaux and then driving off in triumphal state for an afternoon of\r\nsplashing and singing.\r\n\r\nThe Jelly-bean walked out on the porch to a deserted corner, dark\r\nbetween the moon on the lawn and the single lighted door of the\r\nballroom. There he found a chair and, lighting a cigarette, drifted\r\ninto the thoughtless reverie that was his usual mood. Yet now it was a\r\nreverie made sensuous by the night and by the hot smell of damp powder\r\npuffs, tucked in the fronts of low dresses and distilling a thousand\r\nrich scents, to float out through the open door. The music itself,\r\nblurred by a loud trombone, became hot and shadowy, a languorous\r\novertone to the scraping of many shoes and slippers.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the square of yellow light that fell through the door was\r\nobscured by a dark figure. A girl had come out of the dressing-room\r\nand was standing on the porch not more than ten feet away. Jim heard a\r\nlow-breathed \xe2\x80\x9cdoggone\xe2\x80\x9d and then she turned and saw him. It was Nancy\r\nLamar.\r\n\r\nJim rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowdy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello--\xe2\x80\x9d she paused, hesitated and then approached. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s--Jim\r\nPowell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed slightly, tried to think of a casual remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d she began quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean--do you know anything\r\nabout gum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got gum on my shoe. Some utter ass left his or her gum on the\r\nfloor and of course I stepped in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim blushed, inappropriately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how to get it off?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded petulantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve tried\r\na knife. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried every damn thing in the dressing-room. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried\r\nsoap and water--and even perfume and I\xe2\x80\x99ve ruined my powder-puff trying\r\nto make it stick to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim considered the question in some agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--I think maybe gasolene--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words had scarcely left his lips when she grasped his hand and\r\npulled him at a run off the low veranda, over a flower bed and at a\r\ngallop toward a group of cars parked in the moonlight by the first\r\nhole of the golf course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn on the gasolene,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the gum of course. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get it off. I can\xe2\x80\x99t dance with gum\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObediently Jim turned to the cars and began inspecting them with a\r\nview to obtaining the desired solvent. Had she demanded a cylinder he\r\nwould have done his best to wrench one out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s search. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s one that\xe2\x80\x99s easy. Got\r\na handkerchief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s up-stairs wet. I used it for the soap and water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim laboriously explored his pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t believe I got one either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoggone it! Well, we can turn it on and let it run on the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned the spout; a dripping began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned it on fuller. The dripping became a flow and formed an oily\r\npool that glistened brightly, reflecting a dozen tremulous moons on\r\nits quivering bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed contentedly, \xe2\x80\x9clet it all out. The only thing to do is\r\nto wade in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn desperation he turned on the tap full and the pool suddenly widened\r\nsending tiny rivers and trickles in all directions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s fine. That\xe2\x80\x99s something like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaising her skirts she stepped gracefully in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know this\xe2\x80\x99ll take it off,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nJim smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s lots more cars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stepped daintily out of the gasolene and began scraping her\r\nslippers, side and bottom, on the running-board of the automobile. The\r\njelly-bean contained himself no longer. He bent double with explosive\r\nlaughter and after a second she joined in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re here with Clark Darrow, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked as they walked\r\nback toward the veranda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know where he is now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut dancin\xe2\x80\x99, I reckin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce. He promised me a highball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess that\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right. I got his bottle right\r\nhere in my pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled at him radiantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll need ginger ale though,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot me. Just the bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry me. I can drink anything any man can. Let\xe2\x80\x99s sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe perched herself on the side of a table and he dropped into one of\r\nthe wicker chairs beside her. Taking out the cork she held the flask\r\nto her lips and took a long drink. He watched her fascinated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I like the way it makes me feel. I think most people are that\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim agreed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daddy liked it too well. It got him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t know how to drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d Jim was startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on carelessly, \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do anything\r\nvery well. The one thing I regret in my life is that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born in\r\nEngland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It\xe2\x80\x99s the one regret of my life that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like it over there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Immensely. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been there in person, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve met a lot\r\nof Englishmen who were over here in the army, Oxford and Cambridge\r\nmen--you know, that\xe2\x80\x99s like Sewanee and University of Georgia are\r\nhere--and of course I\xe2\x80\x99ve read a lot of English novels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim was interested, amazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99 you ever hear of Lady Diana Manner?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked earnestly.\r\n\r\nNo, Jim had not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be. Dark, you know, like me, and wild as\r\nsin. She\xe2\x80\x99s the girl who rode her horse up the steps of some cathedral\r\nor church or something and all the novelists made their heroines do it\r\nafterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim nodded politely. He was out of his depths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPass the bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Nancy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to take another little\r\none. A little drink wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt a baby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, again breathless after a draught. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\r\nover there have style. Nobody has style here. I mean the boys here\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t really worth dressing up for or doing sensational things for.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so--I mean I suppose not,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Jim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do \xe2\x80\x99em an\xe2\x80\x99 all. I\xe2\x80\x99m really the only girl in town that\r\nhas style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her arms and yawned pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure is,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Jim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike to have boat,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested dreamily. \xe2\x80\x9cLike to sail out on a\r\nsilver lake, say the Thames, for instance. Have champagne and caviare\r\nsandwiches along. Have about eight people. And one of the men would\r\njump overboard to amuse the party, and get drowned like a man did with\r\nLady Diana Manners once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he do it to please her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean drown himself to please\r\nher. He just meant to jump overboard and make everybody laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckin they just died laughin\xe2\x80\x99 when he drowned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I suppose they laughed a little,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cI imagine she\r\ndid, anyway. She\xe2\x80\x99s pretty hard, I guess--like I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike nails.\xe2\x80\x9d She yawned again and added, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a little more from\r\nthat bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim hesitated but she held out her hand defiantly, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t treat me\r\nlike a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d she warned him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not like any girl _you_ ever\r\nsaw.\xe2\x80\x9d She considered. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re right. You got--you got\r\nold head on young shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe jumped to her feet and moved toward the door. The Jelly-bean rose\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d she said politely, \xe2\x80\x9cgood-bye. Thanks, Jelly-bean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she stepped inside and left him wide-eyed upon the porch.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock a procession of cloaks issued single file from the\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room and, each one pairing with a coated beau like\r\ndancers meeting in a cotillion figure, drifted through the door with\r\nsleepy happy laughter--through the door into the dark where autos\r\nbacked and snorted and parties called to one another and gathered\r\naround the water-cooler.\r\n\r\nJim, sitting in his corner, rose to look for Clark. They had met at\r\neleven; then Clark had gone in to dance. So, seeking him, Jim wandered\r\ninto the soft-drink stand that had once been a bar. The room was\r\ndeserted except for a sleepy negro dozing behind the counter and two\r\nboys lazily fingering a pair of dice at one of the tables. Jim was\r\nabout to leave when he saw Clark coming in. At the same moment Clark\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi, Jim!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded. \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99mon over and help us with this bottle. I\r\nguess there\xe2\x80\x99s not much left, but there\xe2\x80\x99s one all around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy, the man from Savannah, Marylyn Wade, and Joe Ewing were lolling\r\nand laughing in the doorway. Nancy caught Jim\xe2\x80\x99s eye and winked at him\r\nhumorously.\r\n\r\nThey drifted over to a table and arranging themselves around it waited\r\nfor the waiter to bring ginger ale. Jim, faintly ill at ease, turned\r\nhis eyes on Nancy, who had drifted into a nickel crap game with the\r\ntwo boys at the next table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring them over here,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Clark.\r\n\r\nJoe looked around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to draw a crowd. It\xe2\x80\x99s against club rules.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s around,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Clark, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept Mr. Taylor. He\xe2\x80\x99s walking up\r\nand down like a wild-man trying find out who let all the gasolene out\r\nof his car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet a million Nancy got something on her shoe again. You can\xe2\x80\x99t park\r\nwhen she\xe2\x80\x99s around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Nancy, Mr. Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s looking for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks were glowing with excitement over the game. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen his silly little flivver in two weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim felt a sudden silence. He turned and saw an individual of\r\nuncertain age standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\nClark\xe2\x80\x99s voice punctuated the embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you join us, Mr. Taylor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor spread his unwelcome presence over a chair. \xe2\x80\x9cHave to, I\r\nguess. I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting till they dig me up some gasolene. Somebody got\r\nfunny with my car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes narrowed and he looked quickly from one to the other. Jim\r\nwondered what he had heard from the doorway--tried to remember what\r\nhad been said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m right to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d Nancy sang out, \xe2\x80\x9cand my four bits is in the\r\nring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaded!\xe2\x80\x9d snapped Taylor suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Taylor, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you shot craps!\xe2\x80\x9d Nancy was overjoyed\r\nto find that he had seated himself and instantly covered her bet. They\r\nhad openly disliked each other since the night she had definitely\r\ndiscouraged a series of rather pointed advances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, babies, do it for your mamma. Just one little seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nNancy was _cooing_ to the dice. She rattled them with a brave\r\nunderhand flourish, and rolled them out on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh-h! I suspected it. And now again with the dollar up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive passes to her credit found Taylor a bad loser. She was making it\r\npersonal, and after each success Jim watched triumph flutter across\r\nher face. She was doubling with each throw--such luck could scarcely\r\nlast. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter go easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he cautioned her timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but watch this one,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. It was eight on the dice and\r\nshe called her number.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Ada, this time we\xe2\x80\x99re going South.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAda from Decatur rolled over the table. Nancy was flushed and\r\nhalf-hysterical, but her luck was holding.\r\n\r\nShe drove the pot up and up, refusing to drag. Taylor was drumming\r\nwith his fingers on the table but he was in to stay.\r\n\r\nThen Nancy tried for a ten and lost the dice. Taylor seized them\r\navidly. He shot in silence, and in the hush of excitement the clatter\r\nof one pass after another on the table was the only sound.\r\n\r\nNow Nancy had the dice again, but her luck had broken. An hour passed.\r\nBack and forth it went. Taylor had been at it again--and again and\r\nagain. They were even at last--Nancy lost her ultimate five dollars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you take my check,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor fifty, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nshoot it all?\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice was a little unsteady and her hand shook as\r\nshe reached to the money.\r\n\r\nClark exchanged an uncertain but alarmed glance with Joe Ewing. Taylor\r\nshot again. He had Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s check.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow \xe2\x80\x99bout another?\xe2\x80\x9d she said wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cJes\xe2\x80\x99 any bank\xe2\x80\x99ll do--money\r\neverywhere as a matter of fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim understood--the \xe2\x80\x9cgood old corn\xe2\x80\x9d he had given her--the \xe2\x80\x9cgood old\r\ncorn\xe2\x80\x9d she had taken since. He wished he dared interfere--a girl of\r\nthat age and position would hardly have two bank accounts. When the\r\nclock struck two he contained himself no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I--can\xe2\x80\x99t you let me roll \xe2\x80\x99em for you?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested, his low,\r\nlazy voice a little strained.\r\n\r\nSuddenly sleepy and listless, Nancy flung the dice down before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right--old boy! As Lady Diana Manners says, \xe2\x80\x98Shoot \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\nJelly-bean\xe2\x80\x99--My luck\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Taylor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim, carelessly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot for one of those\r\nthere checks against the cash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Nancy swayed forward and clapped him on the back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStole my luck, you did.\xe2\x80\x9d She was nodding her head sagely.\r\n\r\nJim swept up the last check and putting it with the others tore them\r\ninto confetti and scattered them on the floor. Someone started singing\r\nand Nancy kicking her chair backward rose to her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced, \xe2\x80\x9cLadies--that\xe2\x80\x99s you Marylyn. I\r\nwant to tell the world that Mr. Jim Powell, who is a well-known\r\nJelly-bean of this city, is an exception to the great rule--\xe2\x80\x98lucky in\r\ndice--unlucky in love.\xe2\x80\x99 He\xe2\x80\x99s lucky in dice, and as matter of fact I--I\r\n_love_ him. Ladies and gentlemen, Nancy Lamar, famous dark-haired\r\nbeauty often featured in the _Herald_ as one th\xe2\x80\x99 most popular\r\nmembers of younger set as other girls are often featured in this\r\nparticular case. Wish to announce--wish to announce, anyway,\r\nGentlemen--\xe2\x80\x9d She tipped suddenly. Clark caught her and restored her\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy error,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cshe--stoops to--stoops to--anyways--We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndrink to Jelly-bean ... Mr. Jim Powell, King of the Jelly-beans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd a few minutes later as Jim waited hat in hand for Clark in the\r\ndarkness of that same corner of the porch where she had come searching\r\nfor gasolene, she appeared suddenly beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJelly-bean,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9care you here, Jelly-bean? I think--\xe2\x80\x9d and her\r\nslight unsteadiness seemed part of an enchanted dream--\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\r\ndeserve one of my sweetest kisses for that, Jelly-bean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor an instant her arms were around his neck--her lips were pressed to\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a wild part of the world, Jelly-bean, but you did me a good\r\nturn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she was gone, down the porch, over the cricket-loud lawn. Jim saw\r\nMerritt come out the front door and say something to her angrily--saw\r\nher laugh and, turning away, walk with averted eyes to his car.\r\nMarylyn and Joe followed, singing a drowsy song about a Jazz baby.\r\n\r\nClark came out and joined Jim on the steps. \xe2\x80\x9cAll pretty lit, I guess,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe yawned. \xe2\x80\x9cMerritt\xe2\x80\x99s in a mean mood. He\xe2\x80\x99s certainly off Nancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOver east along the golf course a faint rug of gray spread itself\r\nacross the feet of the night. The party in the car began to chant a\r\nchorus as the engine warmed up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night everybody,\xe2\x80\x9d called Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Clark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then a soft, happy voice added,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Jelly-bean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe car drove off to a burst of singing. A rooster on a farm across\r\nthe way took up a solitary mournful crow, and behind them, a last\r\nnegro waiter turned out the porch light. Jim and Clark strolled over\r\ntoward the Ford, their shoes crunching raucously on the gravel drive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh boy!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Clark softly, \xe2\x80\x9chow you can set those dice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was still too dark for him to see the flush on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s thin\r\ncheeks--or to know that it was a flush of unfamiliar shame.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOver Tilly\xe2\x80\x99s garage a bleak room echoed all day to the rumble and\r\nsnorting down-stairs and the singing of the negro washers as they\r\nturned the hose on the cars outside. It was a cheerless square of a\r\nroom, punctuated with a bed and a battered table on which lay half a\r\ndozen books--Joe Miller\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSlow Train thru Arkansas,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLucille,\xe2\x80\x9d in an\r\nold edition very much annotated in an old-fashioned hand; \xe2\x80\x9cThe Eyes of\r\nthe World,\xe2\x80\x9d by Harold Bell Wright, and an ancient prayer-book of the\r\nChurch of England with the name Alice Powell and the date 1831 written\r\non the fly-leaf.\r\n\r\nThe East, gray when Jelly-bean entered the garage, became a rich and\r\nvivid blue as he turned on his solitary electric light. He snapped it\r\nout again, and going to the window rested his elbows on the sill and\r\nstared into the deepening morning. With the awakening of his emotions,\r\nhis first perception was a sense of futility, a dull ache at the utter\r\ngrayness of his life. A wall had sprung up suddenly around him hedging\r\nhim in, a wall as definite and tangible as the white wall of his bare\r\nroom. And with his perception of this wall all that had been the\r\nromance of his existence, the casualness, the light-hearted\r\nimprovidence, the miraculous open-handedness of life faded out. The\r\nJelly-bean strolling up Jackson Street humming a lazy song, known at\r\nevery shop and street stand, cropful of easy greeting and local wit,\r\nsad sometimes for only the sake of sadness and the flight of\r\ntime--that Jelly-bean was suddenly vanished. The very name was a\r\nreproach, a triviality. With a flood of insight he knew that Merritt\r\nmust despise him, that even Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s kiss in the dawn would have\r\nawakened not jealousy but only a contempt for Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s so lowering\r\nherself. And on his part the Jelly-bean had used for her a dingy\r\nsubterfuge learned from the garage. He had been her moral laundry; the\r\nstains were his.\r\n\r\nAs the gray became blue, brightened and filled the room, he crossed to\r\nhis bed and threw himself down on it, gripping the edges fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love her,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cGod!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said this something gave way within him like a lump melting in\r\nhis throat. The air cleared and became radiant with dawn, and turning\r\nover on his face he began to sob dully into the pillow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the sunshine of three o\xe2\x80\x99clock Clark Darrow chugging painfully along\r\nJackson Street was hailed by the Jelly-bean, who stood on the curb\r\nwith his fingers in his vest pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi!\xe2\x80\x9d called Clark, bringing his Ford to an astonishing stop\r\nalongside. \xe2\x80\x9cJust get up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jelly-bean shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever did go to bed. Felt sorta restless, so I took a long walk this\r\nmorning out in the country. Just got into town this minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould think you _would_ feel restless. I been feeling thataway\r\nall day--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 of leavin\xe2\x80\x99 town,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Jelly-bean, absorbed by\r\nhis own thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cBeen thinkin\xe2\x80\x99 of goin\xe2\x80\x99 up on the farm, and takin\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nlittle that work off Uncle Dun. Reckin I been bummin\xe2\x80\x99 too long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClark was silent and the Jelly-bean continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckin maybe after Aunt Mamie dies I could sink that money of mine\r\nin the farm and make somethin\xe2\x80\x99 out of it. All my people originally\r\ncame from that part up there. Had a big place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClark looked at him curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s funny,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis--this sort of affected me the same\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jelly-bean hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he began slowly, \xe2\x80\x9csomethin\xe2\x80\x99 about--about that girl\r\nlast night talkin\xe2\x80\x99 about a lady named Diana Manners--an English lady,\r\nsorta got me thinkin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d He drew himself up and looked oddly at Clark,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a family once,\xe2\x80\x9d he said defiantly.\r\n\r\nClark nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m the last of \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Jelly-bean his voice rising\r\nslightly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I ain\xe2\x80\x99t worth shucks. Name they call me by means\r\njelly--weak and wobbly like. People who weren\xe2\x80\x99t nothin\xe2\x80\x99 when my folks\r\nwas a lot turn up their noses when they pass me on the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Clark was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99m through, I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to-day. And when I come back to this town\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s going to be like a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClark took out his handkerchief and wiped his damp brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReckon you\xe2\x80\x99re not the only one it shook up,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted gloomily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this thing of girls going round like they do is going to stop\r\nright quick. Too bad, too, but everybody\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see it thataway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Jim in surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cthat all that\xe2\x80\x99s leaked out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeaked out? How on earth could they keep it secret. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nannounced in the papers to-night. Doctor Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s got to save his name\r\nsomehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim put his hands on the sides of the car and tightened his long\r\nfingers on the metal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Taylor investigated those checks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Clark\xe2\x80\x99s turn to be surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard what happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim\xe2\x80\x99s startled eyes were answer enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Clark dramatically, \xe2\x80\x9cthose four got another bottle of\r\ncorn, got tight and decided to shock the town--so Nancy and that fella\r\nMerritt were married in Rockville at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tiny indentation appeared in the metal under the Jelly-bean\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure enough. Nancy sobered up and rushed back into town, crying and\r\nfrightened to death--claimed it\xe2\x80\x99d all been a mistake. First Doctor\r\nLamar went wild and was going to kill Merritt, but finally they got it\r\npatched up some way, and Nancy and Merritt went to Savannah on the\r\ntwo-thirty train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJim closed his eyes and with an effort overcame a sudden sickness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clark philosophically. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the\r\nwedding--reckon that\xe2\x80\x99s all right, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t guess Nancy cared a\r\ndarn about him. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a crime for a nice girl like that to hurt her\r\nfamily that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jelly-bean let go the car and turned away. Again something was\r\ngoing on inside him, some inexplicable but almost chemical change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Clark.\r\n\r\nThe Jelly-bean turned and looked dully back over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot to go,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cBeen up too long; feelin\xe2\x80\x99 right sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe street was hot at three and hotter still at four, the April dust\r\nseeming to enmesh the sun and give it forth again as a world-old joke\r\nforever played on an eternity of afternoons. But at half past four a\r\nfirst layer of quiet fell and the shades lengthened under the awnings\r\nand heavy foliaged trees. In this heat nothing mattered. All life was\r\nweather, a waiting through the hot where events had no significance\r\nfor the cool that was soft and caressing like a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand on a\r\ntired forehead. Down in Georgia there is a feeling--perhaps\r\ninarticulate--that this is the greatest wisdom of the South--so after\r\na while the Jelly-bean turned into a poolhall on Jackson Street where\r\nhe was sure to find a congenial crowd who would make all the old\r\njokes--the ones he knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMEL\xe2\x80\x99S BACK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe glazed eye of the tired reader resting for a second on the above\r\ntitle will presume it to be merely metaphorical. Stories about the cup\r\nand the lip and the bad penny and the new broom rarely have anything,\r\nto do with cups or lips or pennies or brooms. This story is the\r\nexception. It has to do with a material, visible and large-as-life\r\ncamel\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\nStarting from the neck we shall work toward the tail. I want you to\r\nmeet Mr. Perry Parkhurst, twenty-eight, lawyer, native of Toledo.\r\nPerry has nice teeth, a Harvard diploma, parts his hair in the middle.\r\nYou have met him before--in Cleveland, Portland, St. Paul,\r\nIndianapolis, Kansas City, and so forth. Baker Brothers, New York,\r\npause on their semi-annual trip through the West to clothe him;\r\nMontmorency & Co. dispatch a young man post-haste every three months\r\nto see that he has the correct number of little punctures on his\r\nshoes. He has a domestic roadster now, will have a French roadster if\r\nhe lives long enough, and doubtless a Chinese tank if it comes into\r\nfashion. He looks like the advertisement of the young man rubbing his\r\nsunset-colored chest with liniment and goes East every other year to\r\nhis class reunion.\r\n\r\nI want you to meet his Love. Her name is Betty Medill, and she would\r\ntake well in the movies. Her father gives her three hundred a month to\r\ndress on, and she has tawny eyes and hair and feather fans of five\r\ncolors. I shall also introduce her father, Cyrus Medill. Though he is\r\nto all appearances flesh and blood, he is, strange to say, commonly\r\nknown in Toledo as the Aluminum Man. But when he sits in his club\r\nwindow with two or three Iron Men, and the White Pine Man, and the\r\nBrass Man, they look very much as you and I do, only more so, if you\r\nknow what I mean.\r\n\r\nNow during the Christmas holidays of 1919 there took place in Toledo,\r\ncounting only the people with the italicized _the_, forty-one\r\ndinner parties, sixteen dances, six luncheons, male and female, twelve\r\nteas, four stag dinners, two weddings, and thirteen bridge parties. It\r\nwas the cumulative effect of all this that moved Perry Parkhurst on\r\nthe twenty-ninth day of December to a decision.\r\n\r\nThis Medill girl would marry him and she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry him. She was\r\nhaving such a good time that she hated to take such a definite step.\r\nMeanwhile, their secret engagement had got so long that it seemed as\r\nif any day it might break off of its own weight. A little man named\r\nWarburton, who knew it all, persuaded Perry to superman her, to get a\r\nmarriage license and go up to the Medill house and tell her she\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nto marry him at once or call it off forever. So he presented himself,\r\nhis heart, his license, and his ultimatum, and within five minutes\r\nthey were in the midst of a violent quarrel, a burst of sporadic open\r\nfighting such as occurs near the end of all long wars and engagements.\r\nIt brought about one of those ghastly lapses in which two people who\r\nare in love pull up sharp, look at each other coolly and think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall been a mistake. Afterward they usually kiss wholesomely and assure\r\nthe other person it was all their fault. Say it all was my fault! Say\r\nit was! I want to hear you say it!\r\n\r\nBut while reconciliation was trembling in the air, while each was, in\r\na measure, stalling it off, so that they might the more voluptuously\r\nand sentimentally enjoy it when it came, they were permanently\r\ninterrupted by a twenty-minute phone call for Betty from a garrulous\r\naunt. At the end of eighteen minutes Perry Parkhurst, urged on by\r\npride and suspicion and injured dignity, put on his long fur coat,\r\npicked up his light brown soft hat, and stalked out the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered brokenly as he tried to jam his car into\r\nfirst. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over--if I have to choke you for an hour, damn you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe last to the car, which had been standing some time and was quite\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nHe drove downtown--that is, he got into a snow rut that led him\r\ndowntown. He sat slouched down very low in his seat, much too\r\ndispirited to care where he went.\r\n\r\nIn front of the Clarendon Hotel he was hailed from the sidewalk by a\r\nbad man named Baily, who had big teeth and lived at the hotel and had\r\nnever been in love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bad man softly when the roadster drew up beside him\r\nat the curb, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got six quarts of the doggonedest still champagne\r\nyou ever tasted. A third of it\xe2\x80\x99s yours, Perry, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll come\r\nup-stairs and help Martin Macy and me drink it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaily,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry tensely, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll drink your champagne. I\xe2\x80\x99ll drink\r\nevery drop of it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if it kills me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up, you nut!\xe2\x80\x9d said the bad man gently. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t put wood\r\nalcohol in champagne. This is the stuff that proves the world is more\r\nthan six thousand years old. It\xe2\x80\x99s so ancient that the cork is\r\npetrified. You have to pull it with a stone drill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me up-stairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry moodily. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that cork sees my heart\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99ll fall out from pure mortification.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe room up-stairs was full of those innocent hotel pictures of little\r\ngirls eating apples and sitting in swings and talking to dogs. The\r\nother decorations were neckties and a pink man reading a pink paper\r\ndevoted to ladies in pink tights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have to go into the highways and byways----\xe2\x80\x9d said the pink\r\nman, looking reproachfully at Baily and Perry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Martin Macy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry shortly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s this stone-age\r\nchampagne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the rush? This isn\xe2\x80\x99t an operation, understand. This is a\r\nparty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry sat down dully and looked disapprovingly at all the neckties.\r\n\r\nBaily leisurely opened the door of a wardrobe and brought out six\r\nhandsome bottles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake off that darn fur coat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin Macy to Perry. \xe2\x80\x9cOr maybe\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d like to have us open all the windows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me champagne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to the Townsends\xe2\x80\x99 circus ball to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Vited?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUh-huh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of parties,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Perry. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sick of \xe2\x80\x99em. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen to so many that I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you\xe2\x80\x99re going to the Howard Tates\xe2\x80\x99 party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I tell you; I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macy consolingly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Tates\xe2\x80\x99 is just for college kids\r\nanyways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\xe2\x80\x99d be going to one of \xe2\x80\x99em anyways. I see by the papers\r\nyou haven\xe2\x80\x99t missed a one this Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm,\xe2\x80\x9d grunted Perry morosely.\r\n\r\nHe would never go to any more parties. Classical phrases played in his\r\nmind--that side of his life was closed, closed. Now when a man says\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cclosed, closed\xe2\x80\x9d like that, you can be pretty sure that some woman has\r\ndouble-closed him, so to speak. Perry was also thinking that other\r\nclassical thought, about how cowardly suicide is. A noble thought that\r\none--warm and inspiring. Think of all the fine men we should lose if\r\nsuicide were not so cowardly!\r\n\r\nAn hour later was six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and Perry had lost all resemblance to\r\nthe young man in the liniment advertisement. He looked like a rough\r\ndraft for a riotous cartoon. They were singing--an impromptu song of\r\nBaily\xe2\x80\x99s improvisation:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c_One Lump Perry, the parlor snake,\r\n       Famous through the city for the way he drinks his tea;\r\n     Plays with it, toys with it\r\n     Makes no noise with it,\r\n       Balanced on a napkin on his well-trained knee--_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry, who had just banged his hair with Baily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomb and was tying an orange tie round it to get the effect of Julius\r\nCaesar, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you fellas can\xe2\x80\x99t sing worth a damn. Soon\xe2\x80\x99s I leave the\r\nair and start singing tenor you start singin\xe2\x80\x99 tenor too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99M a natural tenor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Macy gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cVoice lacks cultivation,\r\ntha\xe2\x80\x99s all. Gotta natural voice, m\xe2\x80\x99aunt used say. Naturally good\r\nsinger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSingers, singers, all good singers,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Baily, who was at the\r\ntelephone. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not the cabaret; I want night egg. I mean some\r\ndog-gone clerk \xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s got food--food! I want----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJulius Caesar,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Perry, turning round from the mirror. \xe2\x80\x9cMan\r\nof iron will and stern \xe2\x80\x99termination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled Baily. \xe2\x80\x9cSay, iss Mr. Baily. Sen\xe2\x80\x99 up enormous supper.\r\nUse y\xe2\x80\x99own judgment. Right away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe connected the receiver and the hook with some difficulty, and then\r\nwith his lips closed and an expression of solemn intensity in his eyes\r\nwent to the lower drawer of his dresser and pulled it open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookit!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded. In his hands he held a truncated garment of\r\npink gingham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPants,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cLookit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a pink blouse, a red tie, and a Buster Brown collar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookit!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cCostume for the Townsends\xe2\x80\x99 circus ball. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nli\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99 boy carries water for the elephants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry was impressed in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to be Julius Caesar,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced after a moment of\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThought you weren\xe2\x80\x99t going!\xe2\x80\x9d said Macy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe? Sure I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99. Never miss a party. Good for the nerves--like\r\ncelery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaesar!\xe2\x80\x9d scoffed Baily. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t be Caesar! He is not about a circus.\r\nCaesar\xe2\x80\x99s Shakespeare. Go as a clown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNope; Caesar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaesar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. Chariot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLight dawned on Baily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right. Good idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry looked round the room searchingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lend me a bathrobe and this tie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally. Baily\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, tha\xe2\x80\x99s all I need. Caesar was a savage. They can\xe2\x80\x99t kick if I\r\ncome as Caesar, if he was a savage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baily, shaking his head slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cGet a costume over at a\r\ncostumer\xe2\x80\x99s. Over at Nolak\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClosed up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a puzzling five minutes at the phone a small, weary voice\r\nmanaged to convince Perry that it was Mr. Nolak speaking, and that\r\nthey would remain open until eight because of the Townsends\xe2\x80\x99 ball.\r\nThus assured, Perry ate a great amount of filet mignon and drank his\r\nthird of the last bottle of champagne. At eight-fifteen the man in the\r\ntall hat who stands in front of the Clarendon found him trying to\r\nstart his roadster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFroze up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry wisely. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cold froze it. The cold air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFroze, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Cold air froze it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t start it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNope. Let it stand here till summer. One those hot ole August days\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nthaw it out awright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoin\xe2\x80\x99 let it stand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. Let \xe2\x80\x99er stand. Take a hot thief to steal it. Gemme taxi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man in the tall hat summoned a taxi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to, mister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to Nolak\xe2\x80\x99s--costume fella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMrs. Nolak was short and ineffectual looking, and on the cessation of\r\nthe world war had belonged for a while to one of the new\r\nnationalities. Owing to unsettled European conditions she had never\r\nsince been quite sure what she was. The shop in which she and her\r\nhusband performed their daily stint was dim and ghostly, and peopled\r\nwith suits of armor and Chinese mandarins, and enormous papier-m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9\r\nbirds suspended from the ceiling. In a vague background many rows of\r\nmasks glared eyelessly at the visitor, and there were glass cases full\r\nof crowns and scepters, and jewels and enormous stomachers, and\r\npaints, and crape hair, and wigs of all colors.\r\n\r\nWhen Perry ambled into the shop Mrs. Nolak was folding up the last\r\ntroubles of a strenuous day, so she thought, in a drawer full of pink\r\nsilk stockings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething for you?\xe2\x80\x9d she queried pessimistically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant costume of Julius Hur, the charioteer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Nolak was sorry, but every stitch of charioteer had been rented\r\nlong ago. Was it for the Townsends\xe2\x80\x99 circus ball?\r\n\r\nIt was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything left that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreally circus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was an obstacle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry. An idea struck him suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a piece\r\nof canvas I could go\xe2\x80\x99s a tent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t anything like that. A hardware store is where\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d have to go to. We have some very nice Confederate soldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. No soldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have a very handsome king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral of the gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued hopefully, \xe2\x80\x9care wearing\r\nstovepipe hats and swallow-tail coats and going as ringmasters--but\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re all out of tall hats. I can let you have some crape hair for a\r\nmustache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant somep\xe2\x80\x99n \xe2\x80\x99stinctive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething--let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Well, we have a lion\xe2\x80\x99s head, and a goose, and a\r\ncamel--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCamel?\xe2\x80\x9d The idea seized Perry\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, gripped it fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it needs two people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCamel. That\xe2\x80\x99s the idea. Lemme see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel was produced from his resting place on a top shelf. At first\r\nglance he appeared to consist entirely of a very gaunt, cadaverous\r\nhead and a sizable hump, but on being spread out he was found to\r\npossess a dark brown, unwholesome-looking body made of thick, cottony\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see it takes two people,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Mrs. Nolak, holding the camel\r\nin frank admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a friend he could be part of it. You\r\nsee there\xe2\x80\x99s sorta pants for two people. One pair is for the fella in\r\nfront, and the other pair for the fella in back. The fella in front\r\ndoes the lookin\xe2\x80\x99 out through these here eyes, an\xe2\x80\x99 the fella in back\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s just gotta stoop over an\xe2\x80\x99 folla the front fella round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it on,\xe2\x80\x9d commanded Perry.\r\n\r\nObediently Mrs. Nolak put her tabby-cat face inside the camel\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nand turned it from side to side ferociously.\r\n\r\nPerry was fascinated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat noise does a camel make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Nolak as her face emerged, somewhat smudgy. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nwhat noise? Why, he sorta brays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLemme see it in a mirror.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore a wide mirror Perry tried on the head and turned from side to\r\nside appraisingly. In the dim light the effect was distinctly\r\npleasing. The camel\xe2\x80\x99s face was a study in pessimism, decorated with\r\nnumerous abrasions, and it must be admitted that his coat was in that\r\nstate of general negligence peculiar to camels--in fact, he needed to\r\nbe cleaned and pressed--but distinctive he certainly was. He was\r\nmajestic. He would have attracted attention in any gathering, if only\r\nby his melancholy cast of feature and the look of hunger lurking round\r\nhis shadowy eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see you have to have two people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Nolak again.\r\n\r\nPerry tentatively gathered up the body and legs and wrapped them about\r\nhim, tying the hind legs as a girdle round his waist. The effect on\r\nthe whole was bad. It was even irreverent--like one of those mediaeval\r\npictures of a monk changed into a beast by the ministrations of Satan.\r\nAt the very best the ensemble resembled a humpbacked cow sitting on\r\nher haunches among blankets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look like anything at all,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Perry gloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Nolak; \xe2\x80\x9cyou see you got to have two people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA solution flashed upon Perry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got a date to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry encouragingly. \xe2\x80\x9cSure you can! Here! Be good\r\nsport, and climb into these hind legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith difficulty he located them, and extended their yawning depths\r\ningratiatingly. But Mrs. Nolak seemed loath. She backed perversely\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99m on! You can be the front if you want to. Or we\xe2\x80\x99ll flip a coin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake it worth your while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Nolak set her lips firmly together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you just stop!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with no coyness implied. \xe2\x80\x9cNone of the\r\ngentlemen ever acted up this way before. My husband----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got a husband?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Perry. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWha\xe2\x80\x99s telephone number?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter considerable parley he obtained the telephone number pertaining\r\nto the Nolak penates and got into communication with that small, weary\r\nvoice he had heard once before that day. But Mr. Nolak, though taken\r\noff his guard and somewhat confused by Perry\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant flow of\r\nlogic, stuck staunchly to his point. He refused firmly, but with\r\ndignity, to help out Mr. Parkhurst in the capacity of back part of a\r\ncamel.\r\n\r\nHaving rung off, or rather having been rung off on, Perry sat down on\r\na three-legged stool to think it over. He named over to himself those\r\nfriends on whom he might call, and then his mind paused as Betty\r\nMedill\xe2\x80\x99s name hazily and sorrowfully occurred to him. He had a\r\nsentimental thought. He would ask her. Their love affair was over, but\r\nshe could not refuse this last request. Surely it was not much to\r\nask--to help him keep up his end of social obligation for one short\r\nnight. And if she insisted, she could be the front part of the camel\r\nand he would go as the back. His magnanimity pleased him. His mind\r\neven turned to rosy-colored dreams of a tender reconciliation inside\r\nthe camel--there hidden away from all the world....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99d better decide right off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bourgeois voice of Mrs. Nolak broke in upon his mellow fancies and\r\nroused him to action. He went to the phone and called up the Medill\r\nhouse. Miss Betty was out; had gone out to dinner.\r\n\r\nThen, when all seemed lost, the camel\xe2\x80\x99s back wandered curiously into\r\nthe store. He was a dilapidated individual with a cold in his head and\r\na general trend about him of downwardness. His cap was pulled down low\r\non his head, and his chin was pulled down low on his chest, his coat\r\nhung down to his shoes, he looked run-down, down at the heels,\r\nand--Salvation Army to the contrary--down and out. He said that he was\r\nthe taxicab-driver that the gentleman had hired at the Clarendon\r\nHotel. He had been instructed to wait outside, but he had waited some\r\ntime, and a suspicion had grown upon him that the gentleman had gone\r\nout the back way with purpose to defraud him--gentlemen sometimes\r\ndid--so he had come in. He sank down onto the three-legged stool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanta go to a party?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Perry sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gotta work,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the taxi-driver lugubriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI gotta keep\r\nmy job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very good party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99S a very good job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d urged Perry. \xe2\x80\x9cBe a good fella. See--it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d He held\r\nthe camel up and the taxi-driver looked at it cynically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry searched feverishly among the folds of the cloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried enthusiastically, holding up a selection of folds.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is your part. You don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to talk. All you have to do is\r\nto walk--and sit down occasionally. You do all the sitting down. Think\r\nof it. I\xe2\x80\x99m on my feet all the time and _you_ can sit down some of\r\nthe time. The only time _I_ can sit down is when we\xe2\x80\x99re lying\r\ndown, and you can sit down when--oh, any time. See?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99at thing?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the individual dubiously. \xe2\x80\x9cA shroud?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a camel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Perry mentioned a sum of money, and the conversation left the\r\nland of grunts and assumed a practical tinge. Perry and the\r\ntaxi-driver tried on the camel in front of the mirror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t see it,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Perry, peering anxiously out through the\r\neyeholes, \xe2\x80\x9cbut honestly, ole man, you look sim\xe2\x80\x99ly great! Honestly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA grunt from the hump acknowledged this somewhat dubious compliment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, you look great!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Perry enthusiastically. \xe2\x80\x9cMove\r\nround a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hind legs moved forward, giving the effect of a huge cat-camel\r\nhunching his back preparatory to a spring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; move sideways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel\xe2\x80\x99s hips went neatly out of joint; a hula dancer would have\r\nwrithed in envy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Perry, turning to Mrs. Nolak for approval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks lovely,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Mrs. Nolak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll take it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry.\r\n\r\nThe bundle was stowed under Perry\xe2\x80\x99s arm and they left the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the party!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded as he took his seat in the back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanzy-dress party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99bouts is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis presented a new problem. Perry tried to remember, but the names\r\nof all those who had given parties during the holidays danced\r\nconfusedly before his eyes. He could ask Mrs. Nolak, but on looking\r\nout the window he saw that the shop was dark. Mrs. Nolak had already\r\nfaded out, a little black smudge far down the snowy street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive uptown,\xe2\x80\x9d directed Perry with fine confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you see a\r\nparty, stop. Otherwise I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you when we get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fell into a hazy daydream and his thoughts wandered again to\r\nBetty--he imagined vaguely that they had had a disagreement because\r\nshe refused to go to the party as the back part of the camel. He was\r\njust slipping off into a chilly doze when he was wakened by the\r\ntaxi-driver opening the door and shaking him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are, maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry looked out sleepily. A striped awning led from the curb up to a\r\nspreading gray stone house, from which issued the low drummy whine of\r\nexpensive jazz. He recognized the Howard Tate house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said emphatically; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s it! Tate\xe2\x80\x99s party to-night. Sure,\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s goin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the individual anxiously after another look at the awning,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou sure these people ain\xe2\x80\x99t gonna romp on me for comin\xe2\x80\x99 here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry drew himself up with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99F anybody says anything to you, just tell \xe2\x80\x99em you\xe2\x80\x99re part of my\r\ncostume.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visualization of himself as a thing rather than a person seemed to\r\nreassure the individual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said reluctantly.\r\n\r\nPerry stepped out under the shelter of the awning and began unrolling\r\nthe camel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go,\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded.\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes later a melancholy, hungry-looking camel, emitting\r\nclouds of smoke from his mouth and from the tip of his noble hump,\r\nmight have been seen crossing the threshold of the Howard Tate\r\nresidence, passing a startled footman without so much as a snort, and\r\nheading directly for the main stairs that led up to the ballroom. The\r\nbeast walked with a peculiar gait which varied between an uncertain\r\nlockstep and a stampede--but can best be described by the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chalting.\xe2\x80\x9d The camel had a halting gait--and as he walked he\r\nalternately elongated and contracted like a gigantic concertina.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Howard Tates are, as every one who lives in Toledo knows, the most\r\nformidable people in town. Mrs. Howard Tate was a Chicago Todd before\r\nshe became a Toledo Tate, and the family generally affect that\r\nconscious simplicity which has begun to be the earmark of American\r\naristocracy. The Tates have reached the stage where they talk about\r\npigs and farms and look at you icy-eyed if you are not amused. They\r\nhave begun to prefer retainers rather than friends as dinner guests,\r\nspend a lot of money in a quiet way, and, having lost all sense of\r\ncompetition, are in process of growing quite dull.\r\n\r\nThe dance this evening was for little Millicent Tate, and though all\r\nages were represented, the dancers were mostly from school and\r\ncollege--the younger married crowd was at the Townsends\xe2\x80\x99 circus ball\r\nup at the Tallyho Club. Mrs. Tate was standing just inside the\r\nballroom, following Millicent round with her eyes, and beaming\r\nwhenever she caught her eye. Beside her were two middle-aged\r\nsycophants, who were saying what a perfectly exquisite child Millicent\r\nwas. It was at this moment that Mrs. Tate was grasped firmly by the\r\nskirt and her youngest daughter, Emily, aged eleven, hurled herself\r\nwith an \xe2\x80\x9cOof!\xe2\x80\x9d into her mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Emily, what\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emily, wild-eyed but voluble, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s something out on\r\nthe stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a thing out on the stairs, mamma. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a big dog,\r\nmamma, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Emily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sycophants waved their heads sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, it looks like a--like a camel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tate laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw a mean old shadow, dear, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. No, it was some kind of thing, mamma--big. I was going\r\ndown-stairs to see if there were any more people, and this dog or\r\nsomething, he was coming up-stairs. Kinda funny, mamma, like he was\r\nlame. And then he saw me and gave a sort of growl, and then he slipped\r\nat the top of the landing, and I ran.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Tate\xe2\x80\x99s laugh faded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child must have seen something,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe sycophants agreed that the child must have seen something--and\r\nsuddenly all three women took an instinctive step away from the door\r\nas the sounds of muffled steps were audible just outside.\r\n\r\nAnd then three startled gasps rang out as a dark brown form rounded\r\nthe corner, and they saw what was apparently a huge beast looking down\r\nat them hungrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOof!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Tate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO-o-oh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the ladies in a chorus.\r\n\r\nThe camel suddenly humped his back, and the gasps turned to shrieks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dancing stopped, but the dancers hurrying over got quite a\r\ndifferent impression of the invader; in fact, the young people\r\nimmediately suspected that it was a stunt, a hired entertainer come to\r\namuse the party. The boys in long trousers looked at it rather\r\ndisdainfully, and sauntered over with their hands in their pockets,\r\nfeeling that their intelligence was being insulted. But the girls\r\nuttered little shouts of glee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a camel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t the funniest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel stood there uncertainly, swaying slightly from side to side,\r\nand seeming to take in the room in a careful, appraising glance; then\r\nas if he had come to an abrupt decision, he turned and ambled swiftly\r\nout the door.\r\n\r\nMr. Howard Tate had just come out of the library on the lower floor,\r\nand was standing chatting with a young man in the hall. Suddenly they\r\nheard the noise of shouting up-stairs, and almost immediately a\r\nsuccession of bumping sounds, followed by the precipitous appearance\r\nat the foot of the stairway of a large brown beast that seemed to be\r\ngoing somewhere in a great hurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow what the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tate, starting.\r\n\r\nThe beast picked itself up not without dignity and, affecting an air\r\nof extreme nonchalance, as if he had just remembered an important\r\nengagement, started at a mixed gait toward the front door. In fact,\r\nhis front legs began casually to run.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tate sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cHere! Grab it, Butterfield!\r\nGrab it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man enveloped the rear of the camel in a pair of compelling\r\narms, and, realizing that further locomotion was impossible, the front\r\nend submitted to capture and stood resignedly in a state of some\r\nagitation. By this time a flood of young people was pouring\r\ndown-stairs, and Mr. Tate, suspecting everything from an ingenious\r\nburglar to an escaped lunatic, gave crisp directions to the young man:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold him! Lead him in here; we\xe2\x80\x99ll soon see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel consented to be led into the library, and Mr. Tate, after\r\nlocking the door, took a revolver from a table drawer and instructed\r\nthe young man to take the thing\xe2\x80\x99s head off. Then he gasped and\r\nreturned the revolver to its hiding-place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Perry Parkhurst!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot the wrong party, Mr. Tate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry sheepishly. \xe2\x80\x9cHope I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nscare you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--you gave us a thrill, Perry.\xe2\x80\x9d Realization dawned on him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re bound for the Townsends\xe2\x80\x99 circus ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the general idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me introduce Mr. Butterfield, Mr. Parkhurst.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to\r\nPerry; \xe2\x80\x9cButterfield is staying with us for a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got a little mixed up,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Perry. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly all right; most natural mistake in the world. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a\r\nclown rig and I\xe2\x80\x99m going down there myself after a while.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to\r\nButterfield. \xe2\x80\x9cBetter change your mind and come down with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man demurred. He was going to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a drink, Perry?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr. Tate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, say,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Tate quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten all about\r\nyour--friend here.\xe2\x80\x9d He indicated the rear part of the camel. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to seem discourteous. Is it any one I know? Bring him out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a friend,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Perry hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI just rented him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Perry, twisting himself tortuously round.\r\n\r\nThere was a faint sound of assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure he does!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tate heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cA really efficient camel\r\nought to be able to drink enough so it\xe2\x80\x99d last him three days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry anxiously, \xe2\x80\x9che isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly dressed up enough\r\nto come out. If you give me the bottle I can hand it back to him and\r\nhe can take his inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom under the cloth was audible the enthusiastic smacking sound\r\ninspired by this suggestion. When a butler had appeared with bottles,\r\nglasses, and siphon one of the bottles was handed back; thereafter the\r\nsilent partner could be heard imbibing long potations at frequent\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nThus passed a benign hour. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock Mr. Tate decided that they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter be starting. He donned his clown\xe2\x80\x99s costume; Perry replaced the\r\ncamel\xe2\x80\x99s head, and side by side they traversed on foot the single\r\nblock between the Tate house and the Tallyho Club.\r\n\r\nThe circus ball was in full swing. A great tent fly had been put up\r\ninside the ballroom and round the walls had been built rows of booths\r\nrepresenting the various attractions of a circus side show, but these\r\nwere now vacated and over the floor swarmed a shouting, laughing\r\nmedley of youth and color--clowns, bearded ladies, acrobats, bareback\r\nriders, ringmasters, tattooed men, and charioteers. The Townsends had\r\ndetermined to assure their party of success, so a great quantity of\r\nliquor had been surreptitiously brought over from their house and was\r\nnow flowing freely. A green ribbon ran along the wall completely round\r\nthe ballroom, with pointing arrows alongside and signs which\r\ninstructed the uninitiated to \xe2\x80\x9cFollow the green line!\xe2\x80\x9d The green line\r\nled down to the bar, where waited pure punch and wicked punch and\r\nplain dark-green bottles.\r\n\r\nOn the wall above the bar was another arrow, red and very wavy, and\r\nunder it the slogan: \xe2\x80\x9cNow follow this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut even amid the luxury of costume and high spirits represented,\r\nthere, the entrance of the camel created something of a stir, and\r\nPerry was immediately surrounded by a curious, laughing crowd\r\nattempting to penetrate the identity of this beast that stood by the\r\nwide doorway eying the dancers with his hungry, melancholy gaze.\r\n\r\nAnd then Perry saw Betty standing in front of a booth, talking to a\r\ncomic policeman. She was dressed in the costume of an Egyptian\r\nsnake-charmer: her tawny hair was braided and drawn through brass\r\nrings, the effect crowned with a glittering Oriental tiara. Her fair\r\nface was stained to a warm olive glow and on her arms and the half\r\nmoon of her back writhed painted serpents with single eyes of venomous\r\ngreen. Her feet were in sandals and her skirt was slit to the knees,\r\nso that when she walked one caught a glimpse of other slim serpents\r\npainted just above her bare ankles. Wound about her neck was a\r\nglittering cobra. Altogether a charming costume--one that caused the\r\nmore nervous among the older women to shrink away from her when she\r\npassed, and the more troublesome ones to make great talk about\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly disgraceful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Perry, peering through the uncertain eyes of the camel, saw only\r\nher face, radiant, animated, and glowing with excitement, and her arms\r\nand shoulders, whose mobile, expressive gestures made her always the\r\noutstanding figure in any group. He was fascinated and his fascination\r\nexercised a sobering effect on him. With a growing clarity the events\r\nof the day came back--rage rose within him, and with a half-formed\r\nintention of taking her away from the crowd he started toward her--or\r\nrather he elongated slightly, for he had neglected to issue the\r\npreparatory command necessary to locomotion.\r\n\r\nBut at this point fickle Kismet, who for a day had played with him\r\nbitterly and sardonically, decided to reward him in full for the\r\namusement he had afforded her. Kismet turned the tawny eyes of the\r\nsnake-charmer to the camel. Kismet led her to lean toward the man\r\nbeside her and say, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that? That camel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarned if I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut a little man named Warburton, who knew it all, found it necessary\r\nto hazard an opinion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came in with Mr. Tate. I think part of it\xe2\x80\x99s probably Warren\r\nButterfield, the architect from New York, who\xe2\x80\x99s visiting the Tates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething stirred in Betty Medill--that age-old interest of the\r\nprovincial girl in the visiting man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said casually after a slight pause.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the next dance Betty and her partner finished up within\r\na few feet of the camel. With the informal audacity that was the\r\nkey-note of the evening she reached out and gently rubbed the camel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, old camel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel stirred uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou \xe2\x80\x99fraid of me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Betty, lifting her eyebrows in reproof.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be. You see I\xe2\x80\x99m a snake-charmer, but I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty good at camels\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel bowed very low and some one made the obvious remark about\r\nbeauty and the beast.\r\n\r\nMrs. Townsend approached the group.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Butterfield,\xe2\x80\x9d she said helpfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nrecognised you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry bowed again and smiled gleefully behind his mask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is this with you?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry, his voice muffled by the thick cloth and quite\r\nunrecognizable, \xe2\x80\x9che isn\xe2\x80\x99t a fellow, Mrs. Townsend. He\xe2\x80\x99s just part of\r\nmy costume.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Townsend laughed and moved away. Perry turned again to Betty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is how much she cares! On the very day of our\r\nfinal rupture she starts a flirtation with another man--an absolute\r\nstranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn an impulse he gave her a soft nudge with his shoulder and waved his\r\nhead suggestively toward the hall, making it clear that he desired her\r\nto leave her partner and accompany him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy-by, Rus,\xe2\x80\x9d she called to her partner. \xe2\x80\x9cThis old camel\xe2\x80\x99s got me.\r\nWhere we going, Prince of Beasts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe noble animal made no rejoinder, but stalked gravely along in the\r\ndirection of a secluded nook on the side stairs.\r\n\r\nThere she seated herself, and the camel, after some seconds of\r\nconfusion which included gruff orders and sounds of a heated dispute\r\ngoing on in his interior, placed himself beside her--his hind legs\r\nstretching out uncomfortably across two steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old egg,\xe2\x80\x9d said Betty cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you like our happy\r\nparty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old egg indicated that he liked it by rolling his head\r\necstatically and executing a gleeful kick with his hoofs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first time that I ever had a t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate with a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvalet \xe2\x80\x99round\xe2\x80\x9d--she pointed to the hind legs--\xe2\x80\x9cor whatever that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d mumbled Perry, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s deaf and blind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think you\xe2\x80\x99d feel rather handicapped--you can\xe2\x80\x99t very well\r\ntoddle, even if you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel hang his head lugubriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d say something,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Betty sweetly. \xe2\x80\x9cSay you like\r\nme, camel. Say you think I\xe2\x80\x99m beautiful. Say you\xe2\x80\x99d like to belong to a\r\npretty snake-charmer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel would.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you dance with me, camel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel would try.\r\n\r\nBetty devoted half an hour to the camel. She devoted at least half an\r\nhour to all visiting men. It was usually sufficient. When she\r\napproached a new man the current d\xc3\xa9butantes were accustomed to scatter\r\nright and left like a close column deploying before a machine-gun. And\r\nso to Perry Parkhurst was awarded the unique privilege of seeing his\r\nlove as others saw her. He was flirted with violently!\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThis paradise of frail foundation was broken into by the sounds of a\r\ngeneral ingress to the ballroom; the cotillion was beginning. Betty\r\nand the camel joined the crowd, her brown hand resting lightly on his\r\nshoulder, defiantly symbolizing her complete adoption of him.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the couples were already seating themselves at\r\ntables round the walls, and Mrs. Townsend, resplendent as a super\r\nbareback rider with rather too rotund calves, was standing in the\r\ncentre with the ringmaster in charge of arrangements. At a signal to\r\nthe band every one rose and began to dance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it just slick!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Betty. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you can possibly\r\ndance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry nodded enthusiastically. He felt suddenly exuberant. After all,\r\nhe was here incognito talking to his love--he could wink\r\npatronizingly at the world.\r\n\r\nSo Perry danced the cotillion. I say danced, but that is stretching\r\nthe word far beyond the wildest dreams of the jazziest terpsichorean.\r\nHe suffered his partner to put her hands on his helpless shoulders and\r\npull him here and there over the floor while he hung his huge head\r\ndocilely over her shoulder and made futile dummy motions with his\r\nfeet. His hind legs danced in a manner all their own, chiefly by\r\nhopping first on one foot and then on the other. Never being sure\r\nwhether dancing was going on or not, the hind legs played safe by\r\ngoing through a series of steps whenever the music started playing. So\r\nthe spectacle was frequently presented of the front part of the camel\r\nstanding at ease and the rear keeping up a constant energetic motion\r\ncalculated to rouse a sympathetic perspiration in any soft-hearted\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nHe was frequently favored. He danced first with a tall lady covered\r\nwith straw who announced jovially that she was a bale of hay and coyly\r\nbegged him not to eat her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to; you\xe2\x80\x99re so sweet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the camel gallantly.\r\n\r\nEach time the ringmaster shouted his call of \xe2\x80\x9cMen up!\xe2\x80\x9d he lumbered\r\nferociously for Betty with the cardboard wienerwurst or the photograph\r\nof the bearded lady or whatever the favor chanced to be. Sometimes he\r\nreached her first, but usually his rushes were unsuccessful and\r\nresulted in intense interior arguments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d Perry would snarl, fiercely between his clenched\r\nteeth, \xe2\x80\x9cget a little pep! I could have gotten her that time if you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\npicked your feet up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gimme a little warnin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did, darn you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see a dog-gone thing in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll you have to do is follow me. It\xe2\x80\x99s just like dragging a load of\r\nsand round to walk with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you wanta try back here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shut up! If these people found you in this room they\xe2\x80\x99d give you\r\nthe worst beating you ever had. They\xe2\x80\x99d take your taxi license away\r\nfrom you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry surprised himself by the ease with which he made this monstrous\r\nthreat, but it seemed to have a soporific influence on his companion,\r\nfor he gave out an \xe2\x80\x9caw gwan\xe2\x80\x9d and subsided into abashed silence.\r\n\r\nThe ringmaster mounted to the top of the piano and waved his hand for\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrizes!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cGather round!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea! Prizes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelf-consciously the circle swayed forward. The rather pretty girl who\r\nhad mustered the nerve to come as a bearded lady trembled with\r\nexcitement, thinking to be rewarded for an evening\xe2\x80\x99s hideousness. The\r\nman who had spent the afternoon having tattoo marks painted on him\r\nskulked on the edge of the crowd, blushing furiously when any one told\r\nhim he was sure to get it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady and gent performers of this circus,\xe2\x80\x9d announced the ringmaster\r\njovially, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure we will all agree that a good time has been had\r\nby all. We will now bestow honor where honor is due by bestowing the\r\nprizes. Mrs. Townsend has asked me to bestow the prices. Now, fellow\r\nperformers, the first prize is for that lady who has displayed this\r\nevening the most striking, becoming\xe2\x80\x9d--at this point the bearded lady\r\nsighed resignedly--\xe2\x80\x9cand original costume.\xe2\x80\x9d Here the bale of hay\r\npricked up her ears. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I am sure that the decision which has been\r\nagreed upon will be unanimous with all here present. The first prize\r\ngoes to Miss Betty Medill, the charming Egyptian snake-charmer.\xe2\x80\x9d There\r\nwas a burst of applause, chiefly masculine, and Miss Betty Medill,\r\nblushing beautifully through her olive paint, was passed up to receive\r\nher award. With a tender glance the ringmaster handed down to her a\r\nhuge bouquet of orchids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, looking round him, \xe2\x80\x9cthe other prize is for\r\nthat man who has the most amusing and original costume. This prize\r\ngoes without dispute to a guest in our midst, a gentleman who is\r\nvisiting here but whose stay we all hope will be long and merry--in\r\nshort, to the noble camel who has entertained us all by his hungry\r\nlook and his brilliant dancing throughout the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ceased and there was a violent clapping, and yeaing, for it was a\r\npopular choice. The prize, a large box of cigars, was put aside for\r\nthe camel, as he was anatomically unable to accept it in person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the ringmaster, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will wind up the cotillion\r\nwith the marriage of Mirth to Folly!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForm for the grand wedding march, the beautiful snake-charmer and the\r\nnoble camel in front!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetty skipped forward cheerily and wound an olive arm round the\r\ncamel\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Behind them formed the procession of little boys, little\r\ngirls, country jakes, fat ladies, thin men, sword-swallowers, wild men\r\nof Borneo, and armless wonders, many of them well in their cups, all\r\nof them excited and happy and dazzled by the flow of light and color\r\nround them, and by the familiar faces, strangely unfamiliar under\r\nbizarre wigs and barbaric paint. The voluptuous chords of the wedding\r\nmarch done in blasphemous syncopation issued in a delirious blend from\r\nthe trombones and saxophones--and the march began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad, camel?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Betty sweetly as they stepped off.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you glad we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be married and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to belong\r\nto the nice snake-charmer ever afterward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel\xe2\x80\x99s front legs pranced, expressing excessive joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMinister! Minister! Where\xe2\x80\x99s the minister?\xe2\x80\x9d cried voices out of the\r\nrevel. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the clergyman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head of Jumbo, obese negro, waiter at the Tally-ho Club for many\r\nyears, appeared rashly through a half-opened pantry door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Jumbo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet old Jumbo. He\xe2\x80\x99s the fella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Jumbo. How \xe2\x80\x99bout marrying us a couple?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJumbo was seized by four comedians, stripped of his apron, and\r\nescorted to a raised da\xc3\xafs at the head of the ball. There his collar\r\nwas removed and replaced back side forward with ecclesiastical effect.\r\nThe parade separated into two lines, leaving an aisle for the bride\r\nand groom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLawdy, man,\xe2\x80\x9d roared Jumbo, \xe2\x80\x9cAh got ole Bible \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 ev\xe2\x80\x99ythin\xe2\x80\x99, sho\r\nnuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe produced a battered Bible from an interior pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea! Jumbo\xe2\x80\x99s got a Bible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRazor, too, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTogether the snake-charmer and the camel ascended the cheering aisle\r\nand stopped in front of Jumbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s yo license, camel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA man near by prodded Perry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him a piece of paper. Anything\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry fumbled confusedly in his pocket, found a folded paper, and\r\npushed it out through the camel\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. Holding it upside down Jumbo\r\npretended to scan it earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDis yeah\xe2\x80\x99s a special camel\xe2\x80\x99s license,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGet you ring ready,\r\ncamel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInside the camel Perry turned round and addressed his worse half.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGimme a ring, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t got none,\xe2\x80\x9d protested a weary voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have. I saw it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to take it offen my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a gasp and Perry felt a huge affair of rhinestone and brass\r\ninserted into his hand.\r\n\r\nAgain he was nudged from the outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Perry quickly.\r\n\r\nHe heard Betty\xe2\x80\x99s responses given in a debonair tone, and even in this\r\nburlesque the sound thrilled him.\r\n\r\nThen he had pushed the rhinestone through a tear in the camel\xe2\x80\x99s coat\r\nand was slipping it on her finger, muttering ancient and historic\r\nwords after Jumbo. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any one to know about this ever. His\r\none idea was to slip away without having to disclose his identity, for\r\nMr. Tate had so far kept his secret well. A dignified young man,\r\nPerry--and this might injure his infant law practice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmbrace the bride!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnmask, camel, and kiss her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstinctively his heart beat high as Betty turned to him laughingly\r\nand began to stroke the card-board muzzle. He felt his self-control\r\ngiving way, he longed to surround her with his arms and declare his\r\nidentity and kiss those lips that smiled only a foot away--when\r\nsuddenly the laughter and applause round them died off and a curious\r\nhush fell over the hall. Perry and Betty looked up in surprise. Jumbo\r\nhad given vent to a huge \xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d in such a startled voice that all\r\neyes were bent on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d he said again. He had turned round the camel\xe2\x80\x99s marriage\r\nlicense, which he had been holding upside down, produced spectacles,\r\nand was studying it agonizingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, and in the pervading silence his words were heard\r\nplainly by every one in the room, \xe2\x80\x9cthis yeah\xe2\x80\x99s a sho-nuff marriage\r\npermit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay it again, Jumbo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure you can read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJumbo waved them to silence and Perry\xe2\x80\x99s blood burned to fire in his\r\nveins as he realized the break he had made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYassuh!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Jumbo. \xe2\x80\x9cThis yeah\xe2\x80\x99s a sho-nuff license, and the\r\npa\xe2\x80\x99ties concerned one of \xe2\x80\x99em is dis yeah young lady, Miz Betty Medill,\r\nand th\xe2\x80\x99 other\xe2\x80\x99s Mistah Perry Pa\xe2\x80\x99khurst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a general gasp, and a low rumble broke out as all eyes fell\r\non the camel. Betty shrank away from him quickly, her tawny eyes\r\ngiving out sparks of fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs you Mistah Pa\xe2\x80\x99khurst, you camel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry made no answer. The crowd pressed up closer and stared at him.\r\nHe stood frozen rigid with embarrassment, his cardboard face still\r\nhungry and sardonic as he regarded the ominous Jumbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cY\xe2\x80\x99all bettah speak up!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jumbo slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cthis yeah\xe2\x80\x99s a mighty\r\nserious mattah. Outside mah duties at this club ah happens to be a\r\nsho-nuff minister in the Firs\xe2\x80\x99 Cullud Baptis\xe2\x80\x99 Church. It done look to\r\nme as though y\xe2\x80\x99all is gone an\xe2\x80\x99 got married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe scene that followed will go down forever in the annals of the\r\nTallyho Club. Stout matrons fainted, one hundred per cent Americans\r\nswore, wild-eyed d\xc3\xa9butantes babbled in lightning groups instantly\r\nformed and instantly dissolved, and a great buzz of chatter, virulent\r\nyet oddly subdued, hummed through the chaotic ballroom. Feverish\r\nyouths swore they would kill Perry or Jumbo or themselves or some one,\r\nand the Baptis\xe2\x80\x99 preacheh was besieged by a tempestuous covey of\r\nclamorous amateur lawyers, asking questions, making threats, demanding\r\nprecedents, ordering the bonds annulled, and especially trying to\r\nferret out any hint of prearrangement in what had occurred.\r\n\r\nIn the corner Mrs. Townsend was crying softly on the shoulder of Mr.\r\nHoward Tate, who was trying vainly to comfort her; they were\r\nexchanging \xe2\x80\x9call my fault\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d volubly and voluminously. Outside on a\r\nsnow-covered walk Mr. Cyrus Medill, the Aluminum Man, was being paced\r\nslowly up and down between two brawny charioteers, giving vent now to\r\na string of unrepeatables, now to wild pleadings that they\xe2\x80\x99d just let\r\nhim get at Jumbo. He was facetiously attired for the evening as a wild\r\nman of Borneo, and the most exacting stage-manager would have\r\nacknowledged any improvement in casting the part to be quite\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two principals held the real centre of the stage. Betty\r\nMedill--or was it Betty Parkhurst?--storming furiously, was surrounded\r\nby the plainer girls--the prettier ones were too busy talking about\r\nher to pay much attention to her--and over on the other side of the\r\nhall stood the camel, still intact except for his headpiece, which\r\ndangled pathetically on his chest. Perry was earnestly engaged in\r\nmaking protestations of his innocence to a ring of angry, puzzled men.\r\nEvery few minutes, just as he had apparently proved his case, some one\r\nwould mention the marriage certificate, and the inquisition would\r\nbegin again.\r\n\r\nA girl named Marion Cloud, considered the second best belle of Toledo,\r\nchanged the gist of the situation by a remark she made to Betty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said maliciously, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll all blow over, dear. The courts\r\nwill annul it without question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetty\xe2\x80\x99s angry tears dried miraculously in her eyes, her lips shut\r\ntight together, and she looked stonily at Marion. Then she rose and,\r\nscattering her sympathizers right and left, walked directly across the\r\nroom to Perry, who stared at her in terror. Again silence crept down\r\nupon the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have the decency to grant me five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 conversation--or\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t that included in your plans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded, his mouth unable to form words.\r\n\r\nIndicating coldly that he was to follow her she walked out into the\r\nhall with her chin uptilted and headed for the privacy of one of the\r\nlittle card-rooms.\r\n\r\nPerry started after her, but was brought to a jerky halt by the\r\nfailure of his hind legs to function.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stay here!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded savagely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d whined a voice from the hump, \xe2\x80\x9cunless you get out first and\r\nlet me get out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry hesitated, but unable any longer to tolerate the eyes of the\r\ncurious crowd he muttered a command and the camel moved carefully from\r\nthe room on its four legs.\r\n\r\nBetty was waiting for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she began furiously, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done! You and that\r\ncrazy license! I told you you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gotten it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear girl, I--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98dear girl\xe2\x80\x99 to me! Save that for your real wife if you ever\r\nget one after this disgraceful performance. And don\xe2\x80\x99t try to pretend\r\nit wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all arranged. You know you gave that colored waiter money!\r\nYou know you did! Do you mean to say you didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--of course--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99d better admit it! You tried it, and now what are you going\r\nto do? Do you know my father\xe2\x80\x99s nearly crazy? It\xe2\x80\x99ll serve you right if\r\nhe tries to kill you. He\xe2\x80\x99ll take his gun and put some cold steel in\r\nyou. Even if this wed--this _thing_ can be annulled it\xe2\x80\x99ll hang\r\nover me all the rest of my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry could not resist quoting softly: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, camel, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like\r\nto belong to the pretty snake-charmer for all your--\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut-up!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Betty.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry finally, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing to do that will\r\nreally get us out clear. That\xe2\x80\x99s for you to marry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Really it\xe2\x80\x99s the only--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shut up! I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry you if--if--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. If I were the last man on earth. But if you care anything\r\nabout your reputation--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReputation!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a nice one to think about my\r\nreputation _now_. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you think about my reputation before\r\nyou hired that horrible Jumbo to--to--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry tossed up his hands hopelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything you want. Lord knows I renounce all\r\nclaims!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said a new voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry and Betty started, and she put her hand to her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, what was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the camel\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\nIn a minute Perry had whipped off the camel\xe2\x80\x99s skin, and a lax, limp\r\nobject, his clothes hanging on him damply, his hand clenched tightly\r\non an almost empty bottle, stood defiantly before them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Betty, \xe2\x80\x9cyou brought that object in here to frighten me!\r\nYou told me he was deaf--that awful person!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camel\xe2\x80\x99s back sat down on a chair with a sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk \xe2\x80\x99at way about me, lady. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t no person. I\xe2\x80\x99m your\r\nhusband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHusband!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cry was wrung simultaneously from Betty and Perry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sure. I\xe2\x80\x99m as much your husband as that gink is. The smoke didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmarry you to the camel\xe2\x80\x99s front. He married you to the whole camel.\r\nWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s my ring you got on your finger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a little yelp she snatched the ring from her finger and flung it\r\npassionately at the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Perry dazedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJes\xe2\x80\x99 that you better fix me an\xe2\x80\x99 fix me right. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na-gonna have the same claim you got to bein\xe2\x80\x99 married to her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s bigamy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry, turning gravely to Betty.\r\n\r\nThen came the supreme moment of Perry\xe2\x80\x99s evening, the ultimate chance\r\non which he risked his fortunes. He rose and looked first at Betty,\r\nwhere she sat weakly, aghast at this new complication, and then at the\r\nindividual who swayed from side to side on his chair, uncertainly,\r\nmenacingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry slowly to the individual, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can have her.\r\nBetty, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to prove to you that as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned our\r\nmarriage was entirely accidental. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to renounce utterly my\r\nrights to have you as my wife, and give you to--to the man whose ring\r\nyou wear--your lawful husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause and four horror-stricken eyes were turned on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Betty,\xe2\x80\x9d he said brokenly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget me in your new-found\r\nhappiness. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave for the Far West on the morning train.\r\nThink of me kindly, Betty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a last glance at them he turned and his head rested on his chest\r\nas his hand touched the door-knob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. He turned the door-knob.\r\n\r\nBut at this sound the snakes and silk and tawny hair precipitated\r\nthemselves violently toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Perry, don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me! Perry, Perry, take me with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tears flowed damply on his neck. Calmly he folded his arms about\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you and if you can wake up a\r\nminister at this hour and have it done over again I\xe2\x80\x99ll go West with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOver her shoulder the front part of the camel looked at the back part\r\nof the camel--and they exchanged a particularly subtle, esoteric sort\r\nof wink that only true camels can understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been a war fought and won and the great city of the\r\nconquering people was crossed with triumphal arches and vivid with\r\nthrown flowers of white, red, and rose. All through the long spring\r\ndays the returning soldiers marched up the chief highway behind the\r\nstrump of drums and the joyous, resonant wind of the brasses, while\r\nmerchants and clerks left their bickerings and figurings and, crowding\r\nto the windows, turned their white-bunched faces gravely upon the\r\npassing battalions.\r\n\r\nNever had there been such splendor in the great city, for the\r\nvictorious war had brought plenty in its train, and the merchants had\r\nflocked thither from the South and West with their households to taste\r\nof all the luscious feasts and witness the lavish entertainments\r\nprepared--and to buy for their women furs against the next winter and\r\nbags of golden mesh and varicolored slippers of silk and silver and\r\nrose satin and cloth of gold.\r\n\r\nSo gaily and noisily were the peace and prosperity impending hymned by\r\nthe scribes and poets of the conquering people that more and more\r\nspenders had gathered from the provinces to drink the wine of\r\nexcitement, and faster and faster did the merchants dispose of their\r\ntrinkets and slippers until they sent up a mighty cry for more\r\ntrinkets and more slippers in order that they might give in barter\r\nwhat was demanded of them. Some even of them flung up their hands\r\nhelplessly, shouting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! I have no more slippers! and alas! I have no more trinkets! May\r\nheaven help me for I know not what I shall do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut no one listened to their great outcry, for the throngs were far\r\ntoo busy--day by day, the foot-soldiers trod jauntily the highway and\r\nall exulted because the young men returning were pure and brave, sound\r\nof tooth and pink of cheek, and the young women of the land were\r\nvirgins and comely both of face and of figure.\r\n\r\nSo during all this time there were many adventures that happened in\r\nthe great city, and, of these, several--or perhaps one--are here set\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the morning of the first of May, 1919, a young man\r\nspoke to the room clerk at the Biltmore Hotel, asking if Mr. Philip\r\nDean were registered there, and if so, could he be connected with Mr.\r\nDean\xe2\x80\x99s rooms. The inquirer was dressed in a well-cut, shabby suit. He\r\nwas small, slender, and darkly handsome; his eyes were framed above\r\nwith unusually long eyelashes and below with the blue semicircle of\r\nill health, this latter effect heightened by an unnatural glow which\r\ncolored his face like a low, incessant fever.\r\n\r\nMr. Dean was staying there. The young man was directed to a telephone\r\nat the side.\r\n\r\nAfter a second his connection was made; a sleepy voice hello\xe2\x80\x99d from\r\nsomewhere above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Dean?\xe2\x80\x9d--this very eagerly--\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s Gordon, Phil. It\xe2\x80\x99s Gordon\r\nSterrett. I\xe2\x80\x99m down-stairs. I heard you were in New York and I had a\r\nhunch you\xe2\x80\x99d be here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sleepy voice became gradually enthusiastic. Well, how was Gordy,\r\nold boy! Well, he certainly was surprised and tickled! Would Gordy\r\ncome right up, for Pete\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Philip Dean, dressed in blue silk pajamas, opened\r\nhis door and the two young men greeted each other with a\r\nhalf-embarrassed exuberance. They were both about twenty-four, Yale\r\ngraduates of the year before the war; but there the resemblance\r\nstopped abruptly. Dean was blond, ruddy, and rugged under his thin\r\npajamas. Everything about him radiated fitness and bodily comfort. He\r\nsmiled frequently, showing large and prominent teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to look you up,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried enthusiastically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m taking a\r\ncouple of weeks off. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down a sec I\xe2\x80\x99ll be right with you.\r\nGoing to take a shower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he vanished into the bathroom his visitor\xe2\x80\x99s dark eyes roved\r\nnervously around the room, resting for a moment on a great English\r\ntravelling bag in the corner and on a family of thick silk shirts\r\nlittered on the chairs amid impressive neckties and soft woollen\r\nsocks.\r\n\r\nGordon rose and, picking up one of the shirts, gave it a minute\r\nexamination. It was of very heavy silk, yellow, with a pale blue\r\nstripe--and there were nearly a dozen of them. He stared\r\ninvoluntarily at his own shirt-cuffs--they were ragged and linty at\r\nthe edges and soiled to a faint gray. Dropping the silk shirt, he held\r\nhis coat-sleeves down and worked the frayed shirt-cuffs up till they\r\nwere out of sight. Then he went to the mirror and looked at himself\r\nwith listless, unhappy interest. His tie, of former glory, was faded\r\nand thumb-creased--it served no longer to hide the jagged buttonholes\r\nof his collar. He thought, quite without amusement, that only three\r\nyears before he had received a scattering vote in the senior elections\r\nat college for being the best-dressed man in his class.\r\n\r\nDean emerged from the bathroom polishing his body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaw an old friend of yours last night,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPassed her in the lobby and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of her name to save my\r\nneck. That girl you brought up to New Haven senior year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGordon started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith Bradin? That whom you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99At\xe2\x80\x99s the one. Damn good looking. She\xe2\x80\x99s still sort of a pretty\r\ndoll--you know what I mean: as if you touched her she\xe2\x80\x99d smear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe surveyed his shining self complacently in the mirror, smiled\r\nfaintly, exposing a section of teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must be twenty-three anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-two last month,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gordon absently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Oh, last month. Well, I imagine she\xe2\x80\x99s down for the Gamma Psi\r\ndance. Did you know we\xe2\x80\x99re having a Yale Gamma Psi dance to-night at\r\nDelmonico\xe2\x80\x99s? You better come up, Gordy. Half of New Haven\xe2\x80\x99ll probably\r\nbe there. I can get you an invitation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDraping himself reluctantly in fresh underwear, Dean lit a cigarette\r\nand sat down by the open window, inspecting his calves and knees under\r\nthe morning sunshine which poured into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Gordy,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell me all about what you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen doing and what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing now and everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGordon collapsed unexpectedly upon the bed; lay there inert and\r\nspiritless. His mouth, which habitually dropped a little open when his\r\nface was in repose, became suddenly helpless and pathetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dean quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery God damn thing in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said miserably. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nabsolutely gone to pieces, Phil. I\xe2\x80\x99m all in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all in.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was shaking.\r\n\r\nDean scrutinized him more closely with appraising blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly look all shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a hell of a mess of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter start at the beginning--or will it bore you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all; go\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d There was, however, a hesitant note in Dean\xe2\x80\x99s voice. This trip\r\nEast had been planned for a holiday--to find Gordon Sterrett in\r\ntrouble exasperated him a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, and then added half under his breath, \xe2\x80\x9cGet it\r\nover with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d began Gordon unsteadily, \xe2\x80\x9cI got back from France in February,\r\nwent home to Harrisburg for a month, and then came down to New York to\r\nget a job. I got one--with an export company. They fired me\r\nyesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFired you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming to that, Phil. I want to tell you frankly. You\xe2\x80\x99re about\r\nthe only man I can turn to in a matter like this. You won\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I\r\njust tell you frankly, will you, Phil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDean stiffened a bit more. The pats he was bestowing on his knees grew\r\nperfunctory. He felt vaguely that he was being unfairly saddled with\r\nresponsibility; he was not even sure he wanted to be told. Though\r\nnever surprised at finding Gordon Sterrett in mild difficulty, there\r\nwas something in this present misery that repelled him and hardened\r\nhim, even though it excited his curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm.\xe2\x80\x9d Dean resolved that nothing was going to spoil his trip. If\r\nGordon was going to be depressing, then he\xe2\x80\x99d have to see less of\r\nGordon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer name is Jewel Hudson,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the distressed voice from the bed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe used to be \xe2\x80\x98pure,\xe2\x80\x99 I guess, up to about a year ago. Lived here\r\nin New York--poor family. Her people are dead now and she lives with\r\nan old aunt. You see it was just about the time I met her that\r\neverybody began to come back from France in droves--and all I did was\r\nto welcome the newly arrived and go on parties with \xe2\x80\x99em. That\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nway it started, Phil, just from being glad to see everybody and having\r\nthem glad to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to\xe2\x80\x99ve had more sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d Gordon paused, and then continued listlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m on my own\r\nnow, you know, and Phil, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand being poor. Then came this darn\r\ngirl. She sort of fell in love with me for a while and, though I never\r\nintended to get so involved, I\xe2\x80\x99d always seem to run into her\r\nsomewhere. You can imagine the sort of work I was doing for those\r\nexporting people--of course, I always intended to draw; do\r\nillustrating for magazines; there\xe2\x80\x99s a pile of money in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to buckle down if you want to make good,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsuggested Dean with cold formalism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried, a little, but my stuff\xe2\x80\x99s crude. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got talent, Phil; I can\r\ndraw--but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know how. I ought to go to art school and I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t afford it. Well, things came to a crisis about a week ago. Just\r\nas I was down to about my last dollar this girl began bothering me.\r\nShe wants some money; claims she can make trouble for me if she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid she can. That\xe2\x80\x99s one reason I lost my job--she kept calling\r\nup the office all the time, and that was sort of the last straw down\r\nthere. She\xe2\x80\x99s got a letter all written to send to my family. Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot me, all right. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have some money for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward pause. Gordon lay very still, his hands clenched\r\nby his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all in,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, his voice trembling. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m half crazy,\r\nPhil. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t known you were coming East, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d have killed\r\nmyself. I want you to lend me three hundred dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDean\xe2\x80\x99s hands, which had been patting his bare ankles, were suddenly\r\nquiet--and the curious uncertainty playing between the two became taut\r\nand strained.\r\n\r\nAfter a second Gordon continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve bled the family until I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed to ask for another nickel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill Dean made no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJewel says she\xe2\x80\x99s got to have two hundred dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her where she can go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that sounds easy, but she\xe2\x80\x99s got a couple of drunken letters I\r\nwrote her. Unfortunately she\xe2\x80\x99s not at all the flabby sort of person\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDean made an expression of distaste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stand that sort of woman. You ought to have kept away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Gordon wearily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look at things as they are. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got money\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to work and stay away from women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s easy for you to say,\xe2\x80\x9d began Gordon, his eyes narrowing.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got all the money in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI most certainly have not. My family keep darn close tab on what I\r\nspend. Just because I have a little leeway I have to be extra careful\r\nnot to abuse it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised the blind and let in a further flood of sunshine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no prig, Lord knows,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cI like\r\npleasure--and I like a lot of it on a vacation like this, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re--you\xe2\x80\x99re in awful shape. I never heard you talk just this way\r\nbefore. You seem to be sort of bankrupt--morally as well as\r\nfinancially.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t they usually go together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDean shook his head impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a regular aura about you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sort\r\nof evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an air of worry and poverty and sleepless nights,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gordon,\r\nrather defiantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I admit I\xe2\x80\x99m depressing. I depress myself. But, my God, Phil, a\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x99s rest and a new suit and some ready money and I\xe2\x80\x99d be like--like\r\nI was. Phil, I can draw like a streak, and you know it. But half the\r\ntime I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the money to buy decent drawing materials--and I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t draw when I\xe2\x80\x99m tired and discouraged and all in. With a little\r\nready money I can take a few weeks off and get started.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use it on some other woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy rub it in?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gordon, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not rubbing it in. I hate to see you this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you lend me the money, Phil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t decide right off. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be darn\r\ninconvenient for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be hell for me if you can\xe2\x80\x99t--I know I\xe2\x80\x99m whining, and it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nmy own fault but--that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen could you pay it back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was encouraging. Gordon considered. It was probably wisest to be\r\nfrank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I could promise to send it back next month, but--I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter say three months. Just as soon as I start to sell drawings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll sell any drawings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA new hardness in Dean\xe2\x80\x99s voice sent a faint chill of doubt over\r\nGordon. Was it possible that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the money?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI supposed you had a little confidence in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did have--but when I see you like this I begin to wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the end of my rope I\xe2\x80\x99d come to you like\r\nthis? Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m enjoying it?\xe2\x80\x9d He broke off and bit his lip,\r\nfeeling that he had better subdue the rising anger in his voice. After\r\nall, he was the suppliant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to manage it pretty easily,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dean angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou put me\r\nin the position where, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t lend it to you, I\xe2\x80\x99m a sucker--oh,\r\nyes, you do. And let me tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s no easy thing for me to get hold\r\nof three hundred dollars. My income isn\xe2\x80\x99t so big but that a slice like\r\nthat won\xe2\x80\x99t play the deuce with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left his chair and began to dress, choosing his clothes carefully.\r\nGordon stretched out his arms and clenched the edges of the bed,\r\nfighting back a desire to cry out. His head was splitting and\r\nwhirring, his mouth was dry and bitter and he could feel the fever in\r\nhis blood resolving itself into innumerable regular counts like a slow\r\ndripping from a roof.\r\n\r\nDean tied his tie precisely, brushed his eyebrows, and removed a piece\r\nof tobacco from his teeth with solemnity. Next he filled his cigarette\r\ncase, tossed the empty box thoughtfully into the waste basket, and\r\nsettled the case in his vest pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad breakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat it any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go out and have some. We\xe2\x80\x99ll decide about that money\r\nlater. I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of the subject. I came East to have a good time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go over to the Yale Club,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued moodily, and then added\r\nwith an implied reproof: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve given up your job. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing\r\nelse to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have a lot to do if I had a little money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gordon pointedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake drop the subject for a while! No point in\r\nglooming on my whole trip. Here, here\xe2\x80\x99s some money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took a five-dollar bill from his wallet and tossed it over to\r\nGordon, who folded it carefully and put it in his pocket. There was an\r\nadded spot of color in his cheeks, an added glow that was not fever.\r\nFor an instant before they turned to go out their eyes met and in that\r\ninstant each found something that made him lower his own glance\r\nquickly. For in that instant they quite suddenly and definitely hated\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nFifth Avenue and Forty-fourth Street swarmed with the noon crowd. The\r\nwealthy, happy sun glittered in transient gold through the thick\r\nwindows of the smart shops, lighting upon mesh bags and purses and\r\nstrings of pearls in gray velvet cases; upon gaudy feather fans of\r\nmany colors; upon the laces and silks of expensive dresses; upon the\r\nbad paintings and the fine period furniture in the elaborate show\r\nrooms of interior decorators.\r\n\r\nWorking-girls, in pairs and groups and swarms, loitered by these\r\nwindows, choosing their future boudoirs from some resplendent display\r\nwhich included even a man\xe2\x80\x99s silk pajamas laid domestically across the\r\nbed. They stood in front of the jewelry stores and picked out their\r\nengagement rings, and their wedding rings and their platinum wrist\r\nwatches, and then drifted on to inspect the feather fans and opera\r\ncloaks; meanwhile digesting the sandwiches and sundaes they had eaten\r\nfor lunch.\r\n\r\nAll through the crowd were men in uniform, sailors from the great\r\nfleet anchored in the Hudson, soldiers with divisional insignia from\r\nMassachusetts to California, wanting fearfully to be noticed, and\r\nfinding the great city thoroughly fed up with soldiers unless they\r\nwere nicely massed into pretty formations and uncomfortable under the\r\nweight of a pack and rifle. Through this medley Dean and Gordon\r\nwandered; the former interested, made alert by the display of humanity\r\nat its frothiest and gaudiest; the latter reminded of how often he had\r\nbeen one of the crowd, tired, casually fed, overworked, and\r\ndissipated. To Dean the struggle was significant, young, cheerful; to\r\nGordon it was dismal, meaningless, endless.\r\n\r\nIn the Yale Club they met a group of their former classmates who\r\ngreeted the visiting Dean vociferously. Sitting in a semicircle of\r\nlounges and great chairs, they had a highball all around.\r\n\r\nGordon found the conversation tiresome and interminable. They lunched\r\ntogether _en masse_, warmed with liquor as the afternoon began.\r\nThey were all going to the Gamma Psi dance that night--it promised to\r\nbe the best party since the war.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith Bradin\xe2\x80\x99s coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said some one to Gordon. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t she used to\r\nbe an old flame of yours? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you both from Harrisburg?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d He tried to change the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cI see her brother\r\noccasionally. He\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a socialistic nut. Runs a paper or\r\nsomething here in New York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot like his gay sister, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d continued his eager informant. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s coming to-night--with a junior named Peter Himmel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGordon was to meet Jewel Hudson at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock--he had promised to\r\nhave some money for her. Several times he glanced nervously at his\r\nwrist watch. At four, to his relief, Dean rose and announced that he\r\nwas going over to Rivers Brothers to buy some collars and ties. But as\r\nthey left the Club another of the party joined them, to Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s great\r\ndismay. Dean was in a jovial mood now, happy, expectant of the\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x99s party, faintly hilarious. Over in Rivers\xe2\x80\x99 he chose a dozen\r\nneckties, selecting each one after long consultations with the other\r\nman. Did he think narrow ties were coming back? And wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it a shame\r\nthat Rivers couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any more Welsh Margotson collars? There never\r\nwas a collar like the \xe2\x80\x9cCovington.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGordon was in something of a panic. He wanted the money immediately.\r\nAnd he was now inspired also with a vague idea of attending the Gamma\r\nPsi dance. He wanted to see Edith--Edith whom he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t met since one\r\nromantic night at the Harrisburg Country Club just before he went to\r\nFrance. The affair had died, drowned in the turmoil of the war and\r\nquite forgotten in the arabesque of these three months, but a picture\r\nof her, poignant, debonnaire, immersed in her own inconsequential\r\nchatter, recurred to him unexpectedly and brought a hundred memories\r\nwith it. It was Edith\xe2\x80\x99s face that he had cherished through college\r\nwith a sort of detached yet affectionate admiration. He had loved to\r\ndraw her--around his room had been a dozen sketches of her--playing\r\ngolf, swimming--he could draw her pert, arresting profile with his\r\neyes shut.\r\n\r\nThey left Rivers\xe2\x80\x99 at five-thirty and paused for a moment on the\r\nsidewalk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dean genially, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all set now. Think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to\r\nthe hotel and get a shave, haircut, and massage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other man, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll join you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGordon wondered if he was to be beaten after all. With difficulty he\r\nrestrained himself from turning to the man and snarling out, \xe2\x80\x9cGo on\r\naway, damn you!\xe2\x80\x9d In despair he suspected that perhaps Dean had spoken\r\nto him, was keeping him along in order to avoid a dispute about the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThey went into the Biltmore--a Biltmore alive with girls--mostly from\r\nthe West and South, the stellar d\xc3\xa9butantes of many cities gathered for\r\nthe dance of a famous fraternity of a famous university. But to Gordon\r\nthey were faces in a dream. He gathered together his forces for a last\r\nappeal, was about to come out with he knew not what, when Dean\r\nsuddenly excused himself to the other man and taking Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s arm led\r\nhim aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGordy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve thought the whole thing over carefully\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided that I can\xe2\x80\x99t lend you that money. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to oblige\r\nyou, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel I ought to--it\xe2\x80\x99d put a crimp in me for a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGordon, watching him dully, wondered why he had never before noticed\r\nhow much those upper teeth projected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m--mighty sorry, Gordon,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Dean, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s the way it\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took out his wallet and deliberately counted out seventy-five\r\ndollars in bills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding them out, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s seventy-five; that makes\r\neighty all together. That\xe2\x80\x99s all the actual cash I have with me,\r\nbesides what I\xe2\x80\x99ll actually spend on the trip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGordon raised his clenched hand automatically, opened it as though it\r\nwere a tongs he was holding, and clenched it again on the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see you at the dance,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Dean. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get along to\r\nthe barber shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo-long,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gordon in a strained and husky voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo-long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDean, began to smile, but seemed to change his mind. He nodded briskly\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\nBut Gordon stood there, his handsome face awry with distress, the roll\r\nof bills clenched tightly in his hand. Then, blinded by sudden tears,\r\nhe stumbled clumsily down the Biltmore steps.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAbout nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock of the same night two human beings came out of a\r\ncheap restaurant in Sixth Avenue. They were ugly, ill-nourished,\r\ndevoid of all except the very lowest form of intelligence, and without\r\neven that animal exuberance that in itself brings color into life;\r\nthey were lately vermin-ridden, cold, and hungry in a dirty town of a\r\nstrange land; they were poor, friendless; tossed as driftwood from\r\ntheir births, they would be tossed as driftwood to their deaths. They\r\nwere dressed in the uniform of the United States Army, and on the\r\nshoulder of each was the insignia of a drafted division from New\r\nJersey, landed three days before.\r\n\r\nThe taller of the two was named Carrol Key, a name hinting that in his\r\nveins, however thinly diluted by generations of degeneration, ran\r\nblood of some potentiality. But one could stare endlessly at the long,\r\nchinless face, the dull, watery eyes, and high cheek-bones, without\r\nfinding suggestion of either ancestral worth or native resourcefulness.\r\n\r\nHis companion was swart and bandy-legged, with rat-eyes and a\r\nmuch-broken hooked nose. His defiant air was obviously a pretense, a\r\nweapon of protection borrowed from that world of snarl and snap, of\r\nphysical bluff and physical menace, in which he had always lived. His\r\nname was Gus Rose.\r\n\r\nLeaving the caf\xc3\xa9 they sauntered down Sixth Avenue, wielding toothpicks\r\nwith great gusto and complete detachment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rose, in a tone which implied that he would not be\r\nsurprised if Key suggested the South Sea Islands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say we see if we can getta holda some liquor?\xe2\x80\x9d Prohibition\r\nwas not yet. The ginger in the suggestion was caused by the law\r\nforbidding the selling of liquor to soldiers.\r\n\r\nRose agreed enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got an idea,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Key, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI got a\r\nbrother somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn New York?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYeah. He\xe2\x80\x99s an old fella.\xe2\x80\x9d He meant that he was an elder brother.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a waiter in a hash joint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe he can get us some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say he can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x99lieve me, I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get this darn uniform off me to-morra. Never\r\nget me in it again, neither. I\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to get me some regular\r\nclothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs their combined finances were something less than five dollars, this\r\nintention can be taken largely as a pleasant game of words, harmless\r\nand consoling. It seemed to please both of them, however, for they\r\nreinforced it with chuckling and mention of personages high in\r\nbiblical circles, adding such further emphasis as \xe2\x80\x9cOh, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say so!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated many times over.\r\n\r\nThe entire mental pabulum of these two men consisted of an offended\r\nnasal comment extended through the years upon the institution--army,\r\nbusiness, or poorhouse--which kept them alive, and toward their\r\nimmediate superior in that institution. Until that very morning the\r\ninstitution had been the \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment\xe2\x80\x9d and the immediate superior had\r\nbeen the \xe2\x80\x9cCap\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x9d--from these two they had glided out and were now in\r\nthe vaguely uncomfortable state before they should adopt their next\r\nbondage. They were uncertain, resentful, and somewhat ill at ease.\r\nThis they hid by pretending an elaborate relief at being out of the\r\narmy, and by assuring each other that military discipline should never\r\nagain rule their stubborn, liberty-loving wills. Yet, as a matter of\r\nfact, they would have felt more at home in a prison than in this\r\nnew-found and unquestionable freedom.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Key increased his gait. Rose, looking up and following his\r\nglance, discovered a crowd that was collecting fifty yards down the\r\nstreet. Key chuckled and began to run in the direction of the crowd;\r\nRose thereupon also chuckled and his short bandy legs twinkled beside\r\nthe long, awkward strides of his companion.\r\n\r\nReaching the outskirts of the crowd they immediately became an\r\nindistinguishable part of it. It was composed of ragged civilians\r\nsomewhat the worse for liquor, and of soldiers representing many\r\ndivisions and many stages of sobriety, all clustered around a\r\ngesticulating little Jew with long black whiskers, who was waving his\r\narms and delivering an excited but succinct harangue. Key and Rose,\r\nhaving wedged themselves into the approximate parquet, scrutinized him\r\nwith acute suspicion, as his words penetrated their common\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--What have you got outa the war?\xe2\x80\x9d he was crying fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cLook\r\narounja, look arounja! Are you rich? Have you got a lot of money\r\noffered you?--no; you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky if you\xe2\x80\x99re alive and got both your legs;\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re lucky if you came back an\xe2\x80\x99 find your wife ain\xe2\x80\x99t gone off with\r\nsome other fella that had the money to buy himself out of the war!\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s when you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky! Who got anything out of it except J. P.\r\nMorgan an\xe2\x80\x99 John D. Rockerfeller?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point the little Jew\xe2\x80\x99s oration was interrupted by the hostile\r\nimpact of a fist upon the point of his bearded chin and he toppled\r\nbackward to a sprawl on the pavement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod damn Bolsheviki!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the big soldier-blacksmith who had\r\ndelivered the blow. There was a rumble of approval, the crowd closed\r\nin nearer.\r\n\r\nThe Jew staggered to his feet, and immediately went down again before\r\na half-dozen reaching-in fists. This time he stayed down, breathing\r\nheavily, blood oozing from his lip where it was cut within and\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nThere was a riot of voices, and in a minute Rose and Key found\r\nthemselves flowing with the jumbled crowd down Sixth Avenue under the\r\nleadership of a thin civilian in a slouch hat and the brawny soldier\r\nwho had summarily ended the oration. The crowd had marvellously\r\nswollen to formidable proportions and a stream of more non-committal\r\ncitizens followed it along the sidewalks lending their moral support\r\nby intermittent huzzas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere we goin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d yelled Key to the man nearest him.\r\n\r\nHis neighbor pointed up to the leader in the slouch hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat guy knows where there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of \xe2\x80\x99em! We\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to show \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to show \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Key delightedly to Rose, who\r\nrepeated the phrase rapturously to a man on the other side.\r\n\r\nDown Sixth Avenue swept the procession, joined here and there by\r\nsoldiers and marines, and now and then by civilians, who came up with\r\nthe inevitable cry that they were just out of the army themselves, as\r\nif presenting it as a card of admission to a newly formed Sporting and\r\nAmusement Club.\r\n\r\nThen the procession swerved down a cross street and headed for Fifth\r\nAvenue and the word filtered here and there that they were bound for a\r\nRed meeting at Tolliver Hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question went up the line and a moment later the answer floated\r\nhack. Tolliver Hall was down on Tenth Street. There was a bunch of\r\nother sojers who was goin\xe2\x80\x99 to break it up and was down there now!\r\n\r\nBut Tenth Street had a faraway sound and at the word a general groan\r\nwent up and a score of the procession dropped out. Among these were\r\nRose and Key, who slowed down to a saunter and let the more\r\nenthusiastic sweep on by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather get some liquor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Key as they halted and made their\r\nway to the sidewalk amid cries of \xe2\x80\x9cShell hole!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cQuitters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes your brother work around here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rose, assuming the air of\r\none passing from the superficial to the eternal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe oughta,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Key. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t seen him for a coupla years. I been\r\nout to Pennsylvania since. Maybe he don\xe2\x80\x99t work at night anyhow. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright along here. He can get us some o\xe2\x80\x99right if he ain\xe2\x80\x99t gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey found the place after a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 patrol of the street--a\r\nshoddy tablecloth restaurant between Fifth Avenue and Broadway. Here\r\nKey went inside to inquire for his brother George, while Rose waited\r\non the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ain\xe2\x80\x99t here no more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Key emerging. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a waiter up to\r\nDelmonico\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose nodded wisely, as if he\xe2\x80\x99d expected as much. One should not be\r\nsurprised at a capable man changing jobs occasionally. He knew a\r\nwaiter once--there ensued a long conversation as they waited as to\r\nwhether waiters made more in actual wages than in tips--it was decided\r\nthat it depended on the social tone of the joint wherein the waiter\r\nlabored. After having given each other vivid pictures of millionaires\r\ndining at Delmonico\xe2\x80\x99s and throwing away fifty-dollar bills after their\r\nfirst quart of champagne, both men thought privately of becoming\r\nwaiters. In fact, Key\xe2\x80\x99s narrow brow was secreting a resolution to ask\r\nhis brother to get him a job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA waiter can drink up all the champagne those fellas leave in\r\nbottles,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Rose with some relish, and then added as an\r\nafterthought, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached Delmonico\xe2\x80\x99s it was half past ten, and they\r\nwere surprised to see a stream of taxis driving up to the door one\r\nafter the other and emitting marvelous, hatless young ladies, each one\r\nattended by a stiff young gentleman in evening clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a party,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose with some awe. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we better not go in.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be busy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he won\xe2\x80\x99t. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be o\xe2\x80\x99right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter some hesitation they entered what appeared to them to be the\r\nleast elaborate door and, indecision falling upon them immediately,\r\nstationed themselves nervously in an inconspicuous corner of the small\r\ndining-room in which they found themselves. They took off their caps\r\nand held them in their hands. A cloud of gloom fell upon them and both\r\nstarted when a door at one end of the room crashed open, emitting a\r\ncomet-like waiter who streaked across the floor and vanished through\r\nanother door on the other side.\r\n\r\nThere had been three of these lightning passages before the seekers\r\nmustered the acumen to hail a waiter. He turned, looked at them\r\nsuspiciously, and then approached with soft, catlike steps, as if\r\nprepared at any moment to turn and flee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay,\xe2\x80\x9d began Key, \xe2\x80\x9csay, do you know my brother? He\xe2\x80\x99s a waiter here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name is Key,\xe2\x80\x9d annotated Rose.\r\n\r\nYes, the waiter knew Key. He was up-stairs, he thought. There was a\r\nbig dance going on in the main ballroom. He\xe2\x80\x99d tell him.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later George Key appeared and greeted his brother with the\r\nutmost suspicion; his first and most natural thought being that he was\r\ngoing to be asked for money.\r\n\r\nGeorge was tall and weak chinned, but there his resemblance to his\r\nbrother ceased. The waiter\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were not dull, they were alert and\r\ntwinkling, and his manner was suave, in-door, and faintly superior.\r\nThey exchanged formalities. George was married and had three children.\r\nHe seemed fairly interested, but not impressed by the news that Carrol\r\nhad been abroad in the army. This disappointed Carrol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger brother, these amenities having been\r\ndisposed of, \xe2\x80\x9cwe want to get some booze, and they won\xe2\x80\x99t sell us none.\r\nCan you get us some?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure. Maybe I can. It may be half an hour, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Carrol, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Rose started to sit down in a convenient chair, but was hailed\r\nto his feet by the indignant George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey! Watch out, you! Can\xe2\x80\x99t sit down here! This room\xe2\x80\x99s all set for a\r\ntwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock banquet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 to hurt it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose resentfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI been through the\r\ndelouser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said George sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cif the head waiter seen me here\r\ntalkin\xe2\x80\x99 he\xe2\x80\x99d romp all over me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mention of the head waiter was full explanation to the other two;\r\nthey fingered their overseas caps nervously and waited for a\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cI got a place you can wait;\r\nyou just come here with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey followed him out the far door, through a deserted pantry and up a\r\npair of dark winding stairs, emerging finally into a small room\r\nchiefly furnished by piles of pails and stacks of scrubbing brushes,\r\nand illuminated by a single dim electric light. There he left them,\r\nafter soliciting two dollars and agreeing to return in half an hour\r\nwith a quart of whiskey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge is makin\xe2\x80\x99 money, I bet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Key gloomily as he seated\r\nhimself on an inverted pail. \xe2\x80\x9cI bet he\xe2\x80\x99s making fifty dollars a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose nodded his head and spat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet he is, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99d he say the dance was of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of college fellas. Yale College.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both nodded solemnly at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonder where that crowda sojers is now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I know that\xe2\x80\x99s too damn long to walk for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe too. You don\xe2\x80\x99t catch me walkin\xe2\x80\x99 that far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTen minutes later restlessness seized them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m goin\xe2\x80\x99 to see what\xe2\x80\x99s out here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, stepping cautiously\r\ntoward the other door.\r\n\r\nIt was a swinging door of green baize and he pushed it open a cautious\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor answer Rose drew in his breath sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoggone! Here\xe2\x80\x99s some liquor I\xe2\x80\x99ll say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiquor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKey joined Rose at the door, and looked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the world that\xe2\x80\x99s liquor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a moment of\r\nconcentrated gazing.\r\n\r\nIt was a room about twice as large as the one they were in--and in it\r\nwas prepared a radiant feast of spirits. There were long walls of\r\nalternating bottles set along two white covered tables; whiskey, gin,\r\nbrandy, French and Italian vermouths, and orange juice, not to mention\r\nan array of syphons and two great empty punch bowls. The room was as\r\nyet uninhabited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for this dance they\xe2\x80\x99re just starting,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Key; \xe2\x80\x9chear the\r\nviolins playin\xe2\x80\x99? Say, boy, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind havin\xe2\x80\x99 a dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey closed the door softly and exchanged a glance of mutual\r\ncomprehension. There was no need of feeling each other out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to get my hands on a coupla those bottles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose\r\nemphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose we\xe2\x80\x99d get seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKey considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we better wait till they start drinkin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em. They got \xe2\x80\x99em all\r\nlaid out now, and they know how many of them there are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey debated this point for several minutes. Rose was all for getting\r\nhis hands on a bottle now and tucking it under his coat before anyone\r\ncame into the room. Key, however, advocated caution. He was afraid he\r\nmight get his brother in trouble. If they waited till some of the\r\nbottles were opened it\xe2\x80\x99d be all right to take one, and everybody\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nthink it was one of the college fellas.\r\n\r\nWhile they were still engaged in argument George Key hurried through\r\nthe room and, barely grunting at them, disappeared by way of the green\r\nbaize door. A minute later they heard several corks pop, and then the\r\nsound of cracking ice and splashing liquid. George was mixing the\r\npunch.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers exchanged delighted grins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Rose.\r\n\r\nGeorge reappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust keep low, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have your stuff for you\r\nin five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe disappeared through the door by which he had come.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his footsteps receded down the stairs, Rose, after a\r\ncautious look, darted into the room of delights and reappeared with a\r\nbottle in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s what I say,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as they sat radiantly digesting their\r\nfirst drink. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll wait till he comes up, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll ask him if we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t just stay here and drink what he brings us--see. We\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him\r\nwe haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any place to drink it--see. Then we can sneak in there\r\nwhenever there ain\xe2\x80\x99t nobody in that there room and tuck a bottle under\r\nour coats. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have enough to last us a coupla days--see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Rose enthusiastically. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, boy! And if we want to we\r\ncan sell it to sojers any time we want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a moment thinking rosily of this idea. Then Key\r\nreached up and unhooked the collar of his O. D. coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hot in here, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose agreed earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHot as hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nShe was still quite angry when she came out of the dressing-room and\r\ncrossed the intervening parlor of politeness that opened onto the\r\nhall--angry not so much at the actual happening which was, after all,\r\nthe merest commonplace of her social existence, but because it had\r\noccurred on this particular night. She had no quarrel with herself.\r\nShe had acted with that correct mixture of dignity and reticent pity\r\nwhich she always employed. She had succinctly and deftly snubbed him.\r\n\r\nIt had happened when their taxi was leaving the Biltmore--hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone\r\nhalf a block. He had lifted his right arm awkwardly--she was on his\r\nright side--and attempted to settle it snugly around the crimson\r\nfur-trimmed opera cloak she wore. This in itself had been a mistake.\r\nIt was inevitably more graceful for a young man attempting to embrace\r\na young lady of whose acquiescence he was not certain, to first put\r\nhis far arm around her. It avoided that awkward movement of raising\r\nthe near arm.\r\n\r\nHis second _faux pas_ was unconscious. She had spent the\r\nafternoon at the hairdresser\xe2\x80\x99s; the idea of any calamity overtaking\r\nher hair was extremely repugnant--yet as Peter made his unfortunate\r\nattempt the point of his elbow had just faintly brushed it. That was\r\nhis second _faux pas_. Two were quite enough.\r\n\r\nHe had begun to murmur. At the first murmur she had decided that he\r\nwas nothing but a college boy--Edith was twenty-two, and anyhow, this\r\ndance, first of its kind since the war, was reminding her, with the\r\naccelerating rhythm of its associations, of something else--of another\r\ndance and another man, a man for whom her feelings had been little\r\nmore than a sad-eyed, adolescent mooniness. Edith Bradin was falling\r\nin love with her recollection of Gordon Sterrett.\r\n\r\nSo she came out of the dressing-room at Delmonico\xe2\x80\x99s and stood for a\r\nsecond in the doorway looking over the shoulders of a black dress in\r\nfront of her at the groups of Yale men who flitted like dignified\r\nblack moths around the head of the stairs. From the room she had left\r\ndrifted out the heavy fragrance left by the passage to and fro of many\r\nscented young beauties--rich perfumes and the fragile memory-laden\r\ndust of fragrant powders. This odor drifting out acquired the tang of\r\ncigarette smoke in the hall, and then settled sensuously down the\r\nstairs and permeated the ballroom where the Gamma Psi dance was to be\r\nheld. It was an odor she knew well, exciting, stimulating, restlessly\r\nsweet--the odor of a fashionable dance.\r\n\r\nShe thought of her own appearance. Her bare arms and shoulders were\r\npowdered to a creamy white. She knew they looked very soft and would\r\ngleam like milk against the black backs that were to silhouette them\r\nto-night. The hairdressing had been a success; her reddish mass of\r\nhair was piled and crushed and creased to an arrogant marvel of mobile\r\ncurves. Her lips were finely made of deep carmine; the irises of her\r\neyes were delicate, breakable blue, like china eyes. She was a\r\ncomplete, infinitely delicate, quite perfect thing of beauty, flowing\r\nin an even line from a complex coiffure to two small slim feet.\r\n\r\nShe thought of what she would say to-night at this revel, faintly\r\nprestiged already by the sounds of high and low laughter and slippered\r\nfootsteps, and movements of couples up and down the stairs. She would\r\ntalk the language she had talked for many years--her line--made up of\r\nthe current expressions, bits of journalese and college slang strung\r\ntogether into an intrinsic whole, careless, faintly provocative,\r\ndelicately sentimental. She stalled faintly as she heard a girl\r\nsitting on the stairs near her say: \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know the half of it,\r\ndearie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as she smiled her anger melted for a moment, and closing her eyes\r\nshe drew in a deep breath of pleasure. She dropped her arms to her\r\nside until they were faintly touching the sleek sheath that covered\r\nand suggested her figure. She had never felt her own softness so much\r\nnor so enjoyed the whiteness of her own arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI smell sweet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself simply, and then came another\r\nthought \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m made for love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe liked the sound of this and thought it again; then in inevitable\r\nsuccession came her new-born riot of dreams about Gordon. The twist of\r\nher imagination which, two months before, had disclosed to her her\r\nunguessed desire to see him again, seemed now to have been leading up\r\nto this dance, this hour.\r\n\r\nFor all her sleek beauty, Edith was a grave, slow-thinking girl. There\r\nwas a streak in her of that same desire to ponder, of that adolescent\r\nidealism that had turned her brother socialist and pacifist. Henry\r\nBradin had left Cornell, where he had been an instructor in economies,\r\nand had come to New York to pour the latest cures for incurable evils\r\ninto the columns of a radical weekly newspaper.\r\n\r\nEdith, less fatuously, would have been content to cure Gordon\r\nSterrett. There was a quality of weakness in Gordon that she wanted to\r\ntake care of; there was a helplessness in him that she wanted to\r\nprotect. And she wanted someone she had known a long while, someone\r\nwho had loved her a long while. She was a little tired; she wanted to\r\nget married. Out of a pile of letters, half a dozen pictures and as\r\nmany memories, and this weariness, she had decided that next time she\r\nsaw Gordon their relations were going to be changed. She would say\r\nsomething that would change them. There was this evening. This was her\r\nevening. All evenings were her evenings.\r\n\r\nThen her thoughts were interrupted by a solemn undergraduate with a\r\nhurt look and an air of strained formality who presented himself\r\nbefore her and bowed unusually low. It was the man she had come with,\r\nPeter Himmel. He was tall and humorous, with horned-rimmed glasses and\r\nan air of attractive whimsicality. She suddenly rather disliked\r\nhim--probably because he had not succeeded in kissing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, \xe2\x80\x9care you still furious at me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stepped forward and took his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I snapped out that\r\nway. I\xe2\x80\x99m in a bum humor to-night for some strange reason. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt disagreeably embarrassed. Was she rubbing in the fact of his\r\nlate failure?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, on the same consciously gentle key.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll both forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d For this he hated her.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later they drifted out on the floor while the dozen\r\nswaying, sighing members of the specially hired jazz orchestra\r\ninformed the crowded ballroom that \xe2\x80\x9cif a saxophone and me are left\r\nalone why then two is com-pan-ee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA man with a mustache cut in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello,\xe2\x80\x9d he began reprovingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t remember me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t just think of your name,\xe2\x80\x9d she said lightly--\xe2\x80\x9cand I know you\r\nso well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met you up at--\xe2\x80\x9d His voice trailed disconsolately off as a man with\r\nvery fair hair cut in. Edith murmured a conventional \xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\r\nloads--cut in later,\xe2\x80\x9d to the _inconnu_.\r\n\r\nThe very fair man insisted on shaking hands enthusiastically. She\r\nplaced him as one of the numerous Jims of her acquaintance--last name\r\na mystery. She remembered even that he had a peculiar rhythm in\r\ndancing and found as they started that she was right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to be here long?\xe2\x80\x9d he breathed confidentially.\r\n\r\nShe leaned back and looked up at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouple of weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiltmore. Call me up some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean it,\xe2\x80\x9d he assured her. \xe2\x80\x9cI will. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go to tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I--Do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA dark man cut in with intense formality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t remember me, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say I do. Your name\xe2\x80\x99s Harlan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-ope. Barlow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I knew there were two syllables anyway. You\xe2\x80\x99re the boy that\r\nplayed the ukulele so well up at Howard Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s house party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI played--but not--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA man with prominent teeth cut in. Edith inhaled a slight cloud of\r\nwhiskey. She liked men to have had something to drink; they were so\r\nmuch more cheerful, and appreciative and complimentary--much easier to\r\ntalk to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Dean, Philip Dean,\xe2\x80\x9d he said cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t remember\r\nme, I know, but you used to come up to New Haven with a fellow I\r\nroomed with senior year, Gordon Sterrett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith looked up quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I went up with him twice--to the Pump and Slipper and the Junior\r\nprom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dean carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s here\r\nto-night. I saw him just a minute ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith started. Yet she had felt quite sure he would be here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fat man with red hair cut in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--hello there--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slipped, stumbled lightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured mechanically.\r\n\r\nShe had seen Gordon--Gordon very white and listless, leaning against\r\nthe side of a doorway, smoking, and looking into the ballroom. Edith\r\ncould see that his face was thin and wan--that the hand he raised to\r\nhis lips with a cigarette, was trembling. They were dancing quite\r\nclose to him now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--They invite so darn many extra fellas that you--\xe2\x80\x9d the short man was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Gordon,\xe2\x80\x9d called Edith over her partner\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. Her heart\r\nwas pounding wildly.\r\n\r\nHis large dark eyes were fixed on her. He took a step in her\r\ndirection. Her partner turned her away--she heard his voice\r\nbleating----\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--but half the stags get lit and leave before long, so--\xe2\x80\x9d Then a low\r\ntone at her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was dancing suddenly with Gordon; one of his arms was around her;\r\nshe felt it tighten spasmodically; felt his hand on her back with the\r\nfingers spread. Her hand holding the little lace handkerchief was\r\ncrushed in his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy Gordon,\xe2\x80\x9d she began breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Edith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slipped again--was tossed forward by her recovery until her face\r\ntouched the black cloth of his dinner coat. She loved him--she knew\r\nshe loved him--then for a minute there was silence while a strange\r\nfeeling of uneasiness crept over her. Something was wrong.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden her heart wrenched, and turned over as she realized what\r\nit was. He was pitiful and wretched, a little drunk, and miserably\r\ntired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--\xe2\x80\x9d she cried involuntarily.\r\n\r\nHis eyes looked down at her. She saw suddenly that they were\r\nblood-streaked and rolling uncontrollably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGordon,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down; I want to sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were nearly in mid-floor, but she had seen two men start toward\r\nher from opposite sides of the room, so she halted, seized Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlimp hand and led him bumping through the crowd, her mouth tight shut,\r\nher face a little pale under her rouge, her eyes trembling with tears.\r\n\r\nShe found a place high up on the soft-carpeted stairs, and he sat down\r\nheavily beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, staring at her unsteadily, \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly am glad to\r\nsee you, Edith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him without answering. The effect of this on her was\r\nimmeasurable. For years she had seen men in various stages of\r\nintoxication, from uncles all the way down to chauffeurs, and her\r\nfeelings had varied from amusement to disgust, but here for the first\r\ntime she was seized with a new feeling--an unutterable horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGordon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said accusingly and almost crying, \xe2\x80\x9cyou look like the\r\ndevil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had trouble, Edith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll sorts of trouble. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you say anything to the family, but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nall gone to pieces. I\xe2\x80\x99m a mess, Edith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis lower lip was sagging. He seemed scarcely to see her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you--can\xe2\x80\x99t you,\xe2\x80\x9d she hesitated, \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me about it,\r\nGordon? You know I\xe2\x80\x99m always interested in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bit her lip--she had intended to say something stronger, but found\r\nat the end that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring it out.\r\n\r\nGordon shook his head dully. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good woman. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t tell a good woman the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRot,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, defiantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect insult to call any\r\none a good woman in that way. It\xe2\x80\x99s a slam. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been drinking,\r\nGordon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks.\xe2\x80\x9d He inclined his head gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks for the information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99m so damn miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think drinking\xe2\x80\x99s going to make it any better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you doing--trying to reform me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to help you, Gordon. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in an awful mess. Best thing you can do is to pretend not to know\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Gordon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I cut in on you--its unfair to you. You\xe2\x80\x99re pure woman--and\r\nall that sort of thing. Here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get some one else to dance with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose clumsily to his feet, but she reached up and pulled him down\r\nbeside her on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Gordon. You\xe2\x80\x99re ridiculous. You\xe2\x80\x99re hurting me. You\xe2\x80\x99re acting\r\nlike a--like a crazy man--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admit it. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little crazy. Something\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with me, Edith.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s something left me. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does, tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust that. I was always queer--little bit different from other boys.\r\nAll right in college, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s all wrong. Things have been\r\nsnapping inside me for four months like little hooks on a dress, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s about to come off when a few more hooks go. I\xe2\x80\x99m very gradually\r\ngoing loony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned his eyes full on her and began to laugh, and she shrank away\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust me,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going loony. This whole place is like a\r\ndream to me--this Delmonico\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he talked she saw he had changed utterly. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all light\r\nand gay and careless--a great lethargy and discouragement had come\r\nover him. Revulsion seized her, followed by a faint, surprising\r\nboredom. His voice seemed to come out of a great void.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI used to think I was clever, talented, an artist.\r\nNow I know I\xe2\x80\x99m nothing. Can\xe2\x80\x99t draw, Edith. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I\xe2\x80\x99m telling\r\nyou this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded absently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t draw, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. I\xe2\x80\x99m poor as a church mouse.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlaughed, bitterly and rather too loud. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve become a damn beggar, a\r\nleech on my friends. I\xe2\x80\x99m a failure. I\xe2\x80\x99m poor as hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer distaste was growing. She barely nodded this time, waiting for her\r\nfirst possible cue to rise.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to her with what was evidently a strong\r\neffort at self-control, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what it means to me to know\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s one person left who\xe2\x80\x99s interested in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reached out and patted her hand, and involuntarily she drew it\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s mighty fine of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said slowly, looking him in the eye, \xe2\x80\x9cany one\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nglad to see an old friend--but I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to see you like this,\r\nGordon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause while they looked at each other, and the momentary\r\neagerness in his eyes wavered. She rose and stood looking at him, her\r\nface quite expressionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we dance?\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested, coolly.\r\n\r\n--Love is fragile--she was thinking--but perhaps the pieces are saved,\r\nthe things that hovered on lips, that might have been said. The new\r\nlove words, the tendernesses learned, are treasured up for the next\r\nlover.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nPeter Himmel, escort to the lovely Edith, was unaccustomed to being\r\nsnubbed; having been snubbed, he was hurt and embarrassed, and ashamed\r\nof himself. For a matter of two months he had been on special delivery\r\nterms with Edith Bradin, and knowing that the one excuse and\r\nexplanation of the special delivery letter is its value in sentimental\r\ncorrespondence, he had believed himself quite sure of his ground. He\r\nsearched in vain for any reason why she should have taken this\r\nattitude in the matter of a simple kiss.\r\n\r\nTherefore when he was cut in on by the man with the mustache he went\r\nout into the hall and, making up a sentence, said it over to himself\r\nseveral times. Considerably deleted, this was it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if any girl ever led a man on and then jolted him, she did--and\r\nshe has no kick coming if I go out and get beautifully boiled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he walked through the supper room into a small room adjoining it,\r\nwhich he had located earlier in the evening. It was a room in which\r\nthere were several large bowls of punch flanked by many bottles. He\r\ntook a seat beside the table which held the bottles.\r\n\r\nAt the second highball, boredom, disgust, the monotony of time, the\r\nturbidity of events, sank into a vague background before which\r\nglittering cobwebs formed. Things became reconciled to themselves,\r\nthings lay quietly on their shelves; the troubles of the day arranged\r\nthemselves in trim formation and at his curt wish of dismissal,\r\nmarched off and disappeared. And with the departure of worry came\r\nbrilliant, permeating symbolism. Edith became a flighty, negligible\r\ngirl, not to be worried over; rather to be laughed at. She fitted like\r\na figure of his own dream into the surface world forming about him. He\r\nhimself became in a measure symbolic, a type of the continent\r\nbacchanal, the brilliant dreamer at play.\r\n\r\nThen the symbolic mood faded and as he sipped his third highball his\r\nimagination yielded to the warm glow and he lapsed into a state\r\nsimilar to floating on his back in pleasant water. It was at this\r\npoint that he noticed that a green baize door near him was open about\r\ntwo inches, and that through the aperture a pair of eyes were watching\r\nhim intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Peter calmly.\r\n\r\nThe green door closed--and then opened again--a bare half inch this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeek-a-boo,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Peter.\r\n\r\nThe door remained stationary and then he became aware of a series of\r\ntense intermittent whispers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne guy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he doin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s sittin\xe2\x80\x99 lookin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe better beat it off. We gotta get another li\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99 bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter listened while the words filtered into his consciousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow this,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cis most remarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was excited. He was jubilant. He felt that he had stumbled upon a\r\nmystery. Affecting an elaborate carelessness he arose and waited\r\naround the table--then, turning quickly, pulled open the green door,\r\nprecipitating Private Rose into the room.\r\n\r\nPeter bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nPrivate Rose set one foot slightly in front of the other, poised for\r\nfight, flight, or compromise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Peter politely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m o\xe2\x80\x99right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I offer you a drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrivate Rose looked at him searchingly, suspecting possible sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally.\r\n\r\nPeter indicated a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got a friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, \xe2\x80\x9cI got a friend in there.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to\r\nthe green door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means let\xe2\x80\x99s have him in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter crossed over, opened the door and welcomed in Private Key, very\r\nsuspicious and uncertain and guilty. Chairs were found and the three\r\ntook their seats around the punch bowl. Peter gave them each a\r\nhighball and offered them a cigarette from his case. They accepted\r\nboth with some diffidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Peter easily, \xe2\x80\x9cmay I ask why you gentlemen prefer to\r\nlounge away your leisure hours in a room which is chiefly furnished,\r\nas far as I can see, with scrubbing brushes. And when the human race\r\nhas progressed to the stage where seventeen thousand chairs are\r\nmanufactured on every day except Sunday--\xe2\x80\x9d he paused. Rose and Key\r\nregarded him vacantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy you\r\nchoose to rest yourselves on articles, intended for the transportation\r\nof water from one place to another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point Rose contributed a grunt to the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd lastly,\xe2\x80\x9d finished Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you tell me why, when you are in a\r\nbuilding beautifully hung with enormous candelabra, you prefer to\r\nspend these evening hours under one anemic electric light?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose looked at Key; Key looked at Rose. They laughed; they laughed\r\nuproariously; they found it was impossible to look at each other\r\nwithout laughing. But they were not laughing with this man--they were\r\nlaughing at him. To them a man who talked after this fashion was\r\neither raving drunk or raving crazy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are Yale men, I presume,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, finishing his highball and\r\npreparing another.\r\n\r\nThey laughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa-ah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo? I thought perhaps you might be members of that lowly section of\r\nthe university known as the Sheffield Scientific School.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa-ah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. No doubt you are Harvard men, anxious to\r\npreserve your incognito in this--this paradise of violet blue, as the\r\nnewspapers say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNa-ah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Key scornfully, \xe2\x80\x9cwe was just waitin\xe2\x80\x99 for somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Peter, rising and filling their glasses, \xe2\x80\x9cvery\r\ninterestin\xe2\x80\x99. Had a date with a scrublady, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both denied this indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Peter reassured them, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t apologize. A\r\nscrublady\xe2\x80\x99s as good as any lady in the world. Kipling says\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any lady and Judy O\xe2\x80\x99Grady under the skin.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Key, winking broadly at Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy case, for instance,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Peter, finishing his glass. \xe2\x80\x9cI got\r\na girl up here that\xe2\x80\x99s spoiled. Spoildest darn girl I ever saw. Refused\r\nto kiss me; no reason whatsoever. Led me on deliberately to think sure\r\nI want to kiss you and then plunk! Threw me over! What\xe2\x80\x99s the younger\r\ngeneration comin\xe2\x80\x99 to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay tha\xe2\x80\x99s hard luck,\xe2\x80\x9d said Key--\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s awful hard luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave another?\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe got in a sort of fight for a while,\xe2\x80\x9d said Key after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nit was too far away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fight?--tha\xe2\x80\x99s stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, seating himself unsteadily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFight \xe2\x80\x99em all! I was in the army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was with a Bolshevik fella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha\xe2\x80\x99s stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Peter, enthusiastic. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I say!\r\nKill the Bolshevik! Exterminate \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re Americuns,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rose, implying a sturdy, defiant patriotism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter. \xe2\x80\x9cGreatest race in the world! We\xe2\x80\x99re all Americans!\r\nHave another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had another.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock a special orchestra, special even in a day of special\r\norchestras, arrived at Delmonico\xe2\x80\x99s, and its members, seating\r\nthemselves arrogantly around the piano, took up the burden of\r\nproviding music for the Gamma Psi Fraternity. They were headed by a\r\nfamous flute-player, distinguished throughout New York for his feat of\r\nstanding on his head and shimmying with his shoulders while he played\r\nthe latest jazz on his flute. During his performance the lights were\r\nextinguished except for the spotlight on the flute-player and another\r\nroving beam that threw flickering shadows and changing kaleidoscopic\r\ncolors over the massed dancers.\r\n\r\nEdith had danced herself into that tired, dreamy state habitual only\r\nwith d\xc3\xa9butantes, a state equivalent to the glow of a noble soul after\r\nseveral long highballs. Her mind floated vaguely on the bosom of her\r\nmusic; her partners changed with the unreality of phantoms under the\r\ncolorful shifting dusk, and to her present coma it seemed as if days\r\nhad passed since the dance began. She had talked on many fragmentary\r\nsubjects with many men. She had been kissed once and made love to six\r\ntimes. Earlier in the evening different under-graduates had danced\r\nwith her, but now, like all the more popular girls there, she had her\r\nown entourage--that is, half a dozen gallants had singled her out or\r\nwere alternating her charms with those of some other chosen beauty;\r\nthey cut in on her in regular, inevitable succession.\r\n\r\nSeveral times she had seen Gordon--he had been sitting a long time on\r\nthe stairway with his palm to his head, his dull eyes fixed at an\r\ninfinite spark on the floor before him, very depressed, he looked, and\r\nquite drunk--but Edith each time had averted her glance hurriedly. All\r\nthat seemed long ago; her mind was passive now, her senses were lulled\r\nto trance-like sleep; only her feet danced and her voice talked on in\r\nhazy sentimental banter.\r\n\r\nBut Edith was not nearly so tired as to be incapable of moral\r\nindignation when Peter Himmel cut in on her, sublimely and happily\r\ndrunk. She gasped and looked up at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, _Peter_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a li\xe2\x80\x99l\xe2\x80\x99 stewed, Edith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Peter, you\xe2\x80\x99re a _peach_, you are! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbum way of doing--when you\xe2\x80\x99re with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she smiled unwillingly, for he was looking at her with owlish\r\nsentimentality varied with a silly spasmodic smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarlin\xe2\x80\x99 Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d he began earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know I love you, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tell it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you--and I merely wanted you to kiss me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added sadly.\r\n\r\nHis embarrassment, his shame, were both gone. She was a mos\xe2\x80\x99 beautiful\r\ngirl in whole worl\xe2\x80\x99. Mos\xe2\x80\x99 beautiful eyes, like stars above. He wanted\r\nto \xe2\x80\x99pologize--firs\xe2\x80\x99, for presuming try to kiss her; second, for\r\ndrinking--but he\xe2\x80\x99d been so discouraged \xe2\x80\x99cause he had thought she was\r\nmad at him----\r\n\r\nThe red-fat man cut in, and looking up at Edith smiled radiantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you bring any one?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nNo. The red-fat man was a stag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, would you mind--would it be an awful bother for you to--to take\r\nme home to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d (this extreme diffidence was a charming affectation\r\non Edith\xe2\x80\x99s part--she knew that the red-fat man would immediately\r\ndissolve into a paroxysm of delight).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother? Why, good Lord, I\xe2\x80\x99d be darn glad to! You know I\xe2\x80\x99d be darn\r\nglad to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks _loads_! You\xe2\x80\x99re awfully sweet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glanced at her wrist-watch. It was half-past one. And, as she said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chalf-past one\xe2\x80\x9d to herself, it floated vaguely into her mind that her\r\nbrother had told her at luncheon that he worked in the office of his\r\nnewspaper until after one-thirty every evening.\r\n\r\nEdith turned suddenly to her current partner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat street is Delmonico\xe2\x80\x99s on, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStreet? Oh, why Fifth Avenue, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, what cross street?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--let\xe2\x80\x99s see--it\xe2\x80\x99s on Forty-fourth Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis verified what she had thought. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s office must be across the\r\nstreet and just around the corner, and it occurred to her immediately\r\nthat she might slip over for a moment and surprise him, float in on\r\nhim, a shimmering marvel in her new crimson opera cloak and \xe2\x80\x9ccheer him\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d It was exactly the sort of thing Edith revelled in doing--an\r\nunconventional, jaunty thing. The idea reached out and gripped at her\r\nimagination--after an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation she had decided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy hair is just about to tumble entirely down,\xe2\x80\x9d she said pleasantly\r\nto her partner; \xe2\x80\x9cwould you mind if I go and fix it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a peach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, wrapped in her crimson opera cloak, she flitted\r\ndown a side-stairs, her cheeks glowing with excitement at her little\r\nadventure. She ran by a couple who stood at the door--a weak-chinned\r\nwaiter and an over-rouged young lady, in hot dispute--and opening the\r\nouter door stepped into the warm May night.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe over-rouged young lady followed her with a brief, bitter\r\nglance--then turned again to the weak-chinned waiter and took up her\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou better go up and tell him I\xe2\x80\x99m here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said defiantly, \xe2\x80\x9cor I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo up myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said George sternly.\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled sardonically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t I? Well, let me tell you I know more college\r\nfellas and more of \xe2\x80\x99em know me, and are glad to take me out on a\r\nparty, than you ever saw in your whole life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe so--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe so,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right for any of \xe2\x80\x99em like\r\nthat one that just ran out--God knows where _she_ went--it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright for them that are asked here to come or go as they like--but\r\nwhen I want to see a friend they have some cheap, ham-slinging,\r\nbring-me-a-doughnut waiter to stand here and keep me out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder Key indignantly, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t lose my job.\r\nMaybe this fella you\xe2\x80\x99re talkin\xe2\x80\x99 about doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he wants to see me all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyways, how could I find him in all that crowd?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be there,\xe2\x80\x9d she asserted confidently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou just ask anybody\r\nfor Gordon Sterrett and they\xe2\x80\x99ll point him out to you. They all know\r\neach other, those fellas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe produced a mesh bag, and taking out a dollar bill handed it to\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a bribe. You find him and give him my\r\nmessage. You tell him if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t here in five minutes I\xe2\x80\x99m coming up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge shook his head pessimistically, considered the question for a\r\nmoment, wavered violently, and then withdrew.\r\n\r\nIn less than the allotted time Gordon came down-stairs. He was drunker\r\nthan he had been earlier in the evening and in a different way. The\r\nliquor seemed to have hardened on him like a crust. He was heavy and\r\nlurching--almost incoherent when he talked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Lo, Jewel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said thickly. \xe2\x80\x9cCame right away, Jewel, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nthat money. Tried my best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d she snapped. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t been near me for ten days.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeen very low, Jewel. Been sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me if you were sick. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the money\r\nthat bad. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t start bothering you about it at all until you began\r\nneglecting me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t been neglecting you. Not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t! You haven\xe2\x80\x99t been near me for three weeks, unless you been so\r\ndrunk you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what you were doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeen sick, Jewel,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, turning his eyes upon her wearily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re well enough to come and play with your society friends here\r\nall right. You told me you\xe2\x80\x99d meet me for dinner, and you said you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave some money for me. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t even bother to ring me up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I just been saying that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter? I wanted to see\r\n_you_, Gordon, but you seem to prefer your somebody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe denied this bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen get your hat and come along,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested. Gordon\r\nhesitated--and she came suddenly close to him and slipped her arms\r\naround his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on with me, Gordon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a half whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go over\r\nto Devineries\xe2\x80\x99 and have a drink, and then we can go up to my\r\napartment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t, Jewel,----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can,\xe2\x80\x9d she said intensely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sick as a dog!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to stay here and dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a glance around him in which relief and despair were mingled,\r\nGordon hesitated; then she suddenly pulled him to her and kissed him\r\nwith soft, pulpy lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get my hat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nWhen Edith came out into the clear blue of the May night she found the\r\nAvenue deserted. The windows of the big shops were dark; over their\r\ndoors were drawn great iron masks until they were only shadowy tombs\r\nof the late day\xe2\x80\x99s splendor. Glancing down toward Forty-second Street\r\nshe saw a commingled blur of lights from the all-night restaurants.\r\nOver on Sixth Avenue the elevated, a flare of fire, roared across the\r\nstreet between the glimmering parallels of light at the station and\r\nstreaked along into the crisp dark. But at Forty-fourth Street it was\r\nvery quiet.\r\n\r\nPulling her cloak close about her Edith darted across the Avenue. She\r\nstarted nervously as a solitary man passed her and said in a hoarse\r\nwhisper--\xe2\x80\x9cWhere bound, kiddo?\xe2\x80\x9d She was reminded of a night in her\r\nchildhood when she had walked around the block in her pajamas and a\r\ndog had howled at her from a mystery-big back yard.\r\n\r\nIn a minute she had reached her destination, a two-story,\r\ncomparatively old building on Forty-fourth, in the upper window of\r\nwhich she thankfully detected a wisp of light. It was bright enough\r\noutside for her to make out the sign beside the window--the _New\r\nYork Trumpet_. She stepped inside a dark hall and after a second\r\nsaw the stairs in the corner.\r\n\r\nThen she was in a long, low room furnished with many desks and hung on\r\nall sides with file copies of newspapers. There were only two\r\noccupants. They were sitting at different ends of the room, each\r\nwearing a green eye-shade and writing by a solitary desk light.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she stood uncertainly in the doorway, and then both men\r\nturned around simultaneously and she recognized her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Edith!\xe2\x80\x9d He rose quickly and approached her in surprise, removing\r\nhis eye-shade. He was tall, lean, and dark, with black, piercing eyes\r\nunder very thick glasses. They were far-away eyes that seemed always\r\nfixed just over the head of the person to whom he was talking.\r\n\r\nHe put his hands on her arms and kissed her cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated in some alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was at a dance across at Delmonico\xe2\x80\x99s, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said excitedly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist tearing over to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you did.\xe2\x80\x9d His alertness gave way quickly to a habitual\r\nvagueness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be out alone at night though, ought you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man at the other end of the room had been looking at them\r\ncuriously, but at Henry\xe2\x80\x99s beckoning gesture he approached. He was\r\nloosely fat with little twinkling eyes, and, having removed his collar\r\nand tie, he gave the impression of a Middle-Western farmer on a Sunday\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cShe dropped in to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d said the fat man, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Bartholomew,\r\nMiss Bradin. I know your brother has forgotten it long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith laughed politely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cnot exactly gorgeous quarters we have here, are\r\nthey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith looked around the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey seem very nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you keep the bombs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bombs?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Bartholomew, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good--the\r\nbombs. Did you hear her, Henry? She wants to know where we keep the\r\nbombs. Say, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith swung herself onto a vacant desk and sat dangling her feet over\r\nthe edge. Her brother took a seat beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, absent-mindedly, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you like New York this\r\ntrip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot bad. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be over at the Biltmore with the Hoyts until Sunday.\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t you come to luncheon to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m especially busy,\xe2\x80\x9d he objected, \xe2\x80\x9cand I hate women in groups.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d she agreed, unruffled. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s you and me have luncheon\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call for you at twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBartholomew was obviously anxious to return to his desk, but\r\napparently considered that it would be rude to leave without some\r\nparting pleasantry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x9d--he began awkwardly.\r\n\r\nThey both turned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we--we had an exciting time earlier in the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men exchanged glances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have come earlier,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Bartholomew, somewhat\r\nencouraged. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a regular vaudeville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you really?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA serenade,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of soldiers gathered down there in\r\nthe street and began to yell at the sign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a crowd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry, abstractedly. \xe2\x80\x9cAll crowds have to howl.\r\nThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anybody with much initiative in the lead, or they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nprobably have forced their way in here and smashed things up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartholomew, turning again to Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cyou should have been\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to consider this a sufficient cue for withdrawal, for he\r\nturned abruptly and went back to his desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the soldiers all set against the Socialists?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Edith of\r\nher brother. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean do they attack you violently and all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry replaced his eye-shade and yawned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe human race has come a long way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said casually, \xe2\x80\x9cbut most of\r\nus are throw-backs; the soldiers don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they want, or what\r\nthey hate, or what they like. They\xe2\x80\x99re used to acting in large bodies,\r\nand they seem to have to make demonstrations. So it happens to be\r\nagainst us. There\xe2\x80\x99ve been riots all over the city to-night. It\xe2\x80\x99s May\r\nDay, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the disturbance here pretty serious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout twenty-five of them stopped in\r\nthe street about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and began to bellow at the moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x9d-- She changed the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re glad to see me, Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you think I\xe2\x80\x99m a--a waster. Sort of the World\xe2\x80\x99s Worst\r\nButterfly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. Have a good time while you\xe2\x80\x99re young. Why? Do I seem like\r\nthe priggish and earnest youth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--\xe2\x80\x9d she paused,\xe2\x80\x9c--but somehow I began thinking how absolutely\r\ndifferent the party I\xe2\x80\x99m on is from--from all your purposes. It seems\r\nsort of--of incongruous, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?--me being at a party like that,\r\nand you over here working for a thing that\xe2\x80\x99ll make that sort of party\r\nimpossible ever any more, if your ideas work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it that way. You\xe2\x80\x99re young, and you\xe2\x80\x99re acting just as\r\nyou were brought up to act. Go ahead--have a good time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer feet, which had been idly swinging, stopped and her voice dropped\r\na note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d--you\xe2\x80\x99d come back to Harrisburg and have a good time. Do\r\nyou feel sure that you\xe2\x80\x99re on the right track----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wearing beautiful stockings,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth\r\nare they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re embroidered,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, glancing down; \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\ncunning?\xe2\x80\x9d She raised her skirts and uncovered slim, silk-sheathed\r\ncalves. \xe2\x80\x9cOr do you disapprove of silk stockings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed slightly exasperated, bent his dark eyes on her piercingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you trying to make me out as criticizing you in any way, Edith?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused. Bartholomew had uttered a grunt. She turned and saw that\r\nhe had left his desk and was standing at the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bartholomew, and then after an instant: \xe2\x80\x9cWhole jam of\r\nthem. They\xe2\x80\x99re coming from Sixth Avenue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fat man pressed his nose to the pane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoldiers, by God!\xe2\x80\x9d he said emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cI had an idea they\xe2\x80\x99d come\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdith jumped to her feet, and running over joined Bartholomew at the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of them!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Henry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry readjusted his shade, but kept his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t we better turn out the lights?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Bartholomew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. They\xe2\x80\x99ll go away in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, peering from the window. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not even\r\nthinking of going away. There\xe2\x80\x99s more of them coming. Look--there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwhole crowd turning the corner of Sixth Avenue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy the yellow glow and blue shadows of the street lamp she could see\r\nthat the sidewalk was crowded with men. They were mostly in uniform,\r\nsome sober, some enthusiastically drunk, and over the whole swept an\r\nincoherent clamor and shouting.\r\n\r\nHenry rose, and going to the window exposed himself as a long\r\nsilhouette against the office lights. Immediately the shouting became\r\na steady yell, and a rattling fusillade of small missiles, corners of\r\ntobacco plugs, cigarette-boxes, and even pennies beat against the\r\nwindow. The sounds of the racket now began floating up the stairs as\r\nthe folding doors revolved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re coming up!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bartholomew.\r\n\r\nEdith turned anxiously to Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re coming up, Henry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom down-stairs in the lower hall their cries were now quite audible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--God damn Socialists!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPro-Germans! Boche-lovers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond floor, front! Come on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll get the sons--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next five minutes passed in a dream. Edith was conscious that the\r\nclamor burst suddenly upon the three of them like a cloud of rain,\r\nthat there was a thunder of many feet on the stairs, that Henry had\r\nseized her arm and drawn her back toward the rear of the office. Then\r\nthe door opened and an overflow of men were forced into the room--not\r\nthe leaders, but simply those who happened to be in front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Bo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp late, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou an\xe2\x80\x99 your girl. Damn _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe noticed that two very drunken soldiers had been forced to the\r\nfront, where they wobbled fatuously--one of them was short and dark,\r\nthe other was tall and weak of chin.\r\n\r\nHenry stepped forward and raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriends!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe clamor faded into a momentary stillness, punctuated with\r\nmutterings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriends!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, his far-away eyes fixed over the heads of the\r\ncrowd, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re injuring no one but yourselves by breaking in here\r\nto-night. Do we look like rich men? Do we look like Germans? I ask you\r\nin all fairness--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPipe down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say you do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, who\xe2\x80\x99s your lady friend, buddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA man in civilian clothes, who had been pawing over a table, suddenly\r\nheld up a newspaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cThey wanted the Germans to win the war!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA new overflow from the stairs was shouldered in and of a sudden the\r\nroom was full of men all closing around the pale little group at the\r\nback. Edith saw that the tall soldier with the weak chin was still in\r\nfront. The short dark one had disappeared.\r\n\r\nShe edged slightly backward, stood close to the open window, through\r\nwhich came a clear breath of cool night air.\r\n\r\nThen the room was a riot. She realized that the soldiers were surging\r\nforward, glimpsed the fat man swinging a chair over his\r\nhead--instantly the lights went out and she felt the push of warm\r\nbodies under rough cloth, and her ears were full of shouting and\r\ntrampling and hard breathing.\r\n\r\nA figure flashed by her out of nowhere, tottered, was edged sideways,\r\nand of a sudden disappeared helplessly out through the open window\r\nwith a frightened, fragmentary cry that died staccato on the bosom of\r\nthe clamor. By the faint light streaming from the building backing on\r\nthe area Edith had a quick impression that it had been the tall\r\nsoldier with the weak chin.\r\n\r\nAnger rose astonishingly in her. She swung her arms wildly, edged\r\nblindly toward the thickest of the scuffling. She heard grunts,\r\ncurses, the muffled impact of fists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry!\xe2\x80\x9d she called frantically, \xe2\x80\x9cHenry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, it was minutes later, she felt suddenly that there were other\r\nfigures in the room. She heard a voice, deep, bullying, authoritative;\r\nshe saw yellow rays of light sweeping here and there in the fracas.\r\nThe cries became more scattered. The scuffling increased and then\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the lights were on and the room was full of policemen,\r\nclubbing left and right. The deep voice boomed out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere now! Here now! Here now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet down and get out! Here now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe room seemed to empty like a wash-bowl. A policeman fast-grappled\r\nin the corner released his hold on his soldier antagonist and started\r\nhim with a shove toward the door. The deep voice continued. Edith\r\nperceived now that it came from a bull-necked police captain standing\r\nnear the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere now! This is no way! One of your own sojers got shoved out of\r\nthe back window an\xe2\x80\x99 killed hisself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry!\xe2\x80\x9d called Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cHenry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe beat wildly with her fists on the back of the man in front of her;\r\nshe brushed between two others; fought, shrieked, and beat her way to\r\na very pale figure sitting on the floor close to a desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried passionately, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter? Did they hurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes were shut. He groaned and then looking up said disgustedly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey broke my leg. My God, the fools!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere now!\xe2\x80\x9d called the police captain. \xe2\x80\x9cHere now! Here now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChilds\xe2\x80\x99, Fifty-ninth Street,\xe2\x80\x9d at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock of any morning differs\r\nfrom its sisters by less than the width of their marble tables or the\r\ndegree of polish on the frying-pans. You will see there a crowd of\r\npoor people with sleep in the corners of their eyes, trying to look\r\nstraight before them at their food so as not to see the other poor\r\npeople. But Childs\xe2\x80\x99, Fifty-ninth, four hours earlier is quite unlike\r\nany Childs\xe2\x80\x99 restaurant from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine.\r\nWithin its pale but sanitary walls one finds a noisy medley of chorus\r\ngirls, college boys, d\xc3\xa9butantes, rakes, _filles de joie_--a not\r\nunrepresentative mixture of the gayest of Broadway, and even of Fifth\r\nAvenue.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning of May the second it was unusually full. Over the\r\nmarble-topped tables were bent the excited faces of flappers whose\r\nfathers owned individual villages. They were eating buckwheat cakes\r\nand scrambled eggs with relish and gusto, an accomplishment that it\r\nwould have been utterly impossible for them to repeat in the same\r\nplace four hours later.\r\n\r\nAlmost the entire crowd were from the Gamma Psi dance at Delmonico\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexcept for several chorus girls from a midnight revue who sat at a\r\nside table and wished they\xe2\x80\x99d taken off a little more make-up after the\r\nshow. Here and there a drab, mouse-like figure, desperately out of\r\nplace, watched the butterflies with a weary, puzzled curiosity. But\r\nthe drab figure was the exception. This was the morning after May Day,\r\nand celebration was still in the air.\r\n\r\nGus Rose, sober but a little dazed, must be classed as one of the drab\r\nfigures. How he had got himself from Forty-fourth Street to\r\nFifty-ninth Street after the riot was only a hazy half-memory. He had\r\nseen the body of Carrol Key put in an ambulance and driven off, and\r\nthen he had started up town with two or three soldiers. Somewhere\r\nbetween Forty-fourth Street and Fifty-ninth Street the other soldiers\r\nhad met some women and disappeared. Rose had wandered to Columbus\r\nCircle and chosen the gleaming lights of Childs\xe2\x80\x99 to minister to his\r\ncraving for coffee and doughnuts. He walked in and sat down.\r\n\r\nAll around him floated airy, inconsequential chatter and high-pitched\r\nlaughter. At first he failed to understand, but after a puzzled five\r\nminutes he realized that this was the aftermath of some gay party.\r\nHere and there a restless, hilarious young man wandered fraternally\r\nand familiarly between the tables, shaking hands indiscriminately and\r\npausing occasionally for a facetious chat, while excited waiters,\r\nbearing cakes and eggs aloft, swore at him silently, and bumped him\r\nout of the way. To Rose, seated at the most inconspicuous and least\r\ncrowded table, the whole scene was a colorful circus of beauty and\r\nriotous pleasure.\r\n\r\nHe became gradually aware, after a few moments, that the couple seated\r\ndiagonally across from him with their backs to the crowd, were not the\r\nleast interesting pair in the room. The man was drunk. He wore a\r\ndinner coat with a dishevelled tie and shirt swollen by spillings of\r\nwater and wine. His eyes, dim and blood-shot, roved unnaturally from\r\nside to side. His breath came short between his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been on a spree!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rose.\r\n\r\nThe woman was almost if not quite sober. She was pretty, with dark\r\neyes and feverish high color, and she kept her active eyes fixed on\r\nher companion with the alertness of a hawk. From time to time she\r\nwould lean and whisper intently to him, and he would answer by\r\ninclining his head heavily or by a particularly ghoulish and repellent\r\nwink.\r\n\r\nRose scrutinized them dumbly for some minutes until the woman gave him\r\na quick, resentful look; then he shifted his gaze to two of the most\r\nconspicuously hilarious of the promenaders who were on a protracted\r\ncircuit of the tables. To his surprise he recognized in one of them\r\nthe young man by whom he had been so ludicrously entertained at\r\nDelmonico\xe2\x80\x99s. This started him thinking of Key with a vague\r\nsentimentality, not unmixed with awe. Key was dead. He had fallen\r\nthirty-five feet and split his skull like a cracked cocoa-nut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a darn good guy,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rose mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a darn good\r\nguy, o\xe2\x80\x99right. That was awful hard luck about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two promenaders approached and started down between Rose\xe2\x80\x99s table\r\nand the next, addressing friends and strangers alike with jovial\r\nfamiliarity. Suddenly Rose saw the fair-haired one with the prominent\r\nteeth stop, look unsteadily at the man and girl opposite, and then\r\nbegin to move his head disapprovingly from side to side.\r\n\r\nThe man with the blood-shot eyes looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGordy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the promenader with the prominent teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cGordy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man with the stained shirt thickly.\r\n\r\nProminent teeth shook his finger pessimistically at the pair, giving\r\nthe woman a glance of aloof condemnation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99d I tell you Gordy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGordon stirred in his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to hell!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nDean continued to stand there shaking his finger. The woman began to\r\nget angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go way!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re drunk, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\x99s he,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Dean, staying the motion of his finger and\r\npointing it at Gordon.\r\n\r\nPeter Himmel ambled up, owlish now and oratorically inclined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere now,\xe2\x80\x9d he began as if called upon to deal with some petty dispute\r\nbetween children. \xe2\x80\x9cWha\xe2\x80\x99s all trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take your friend away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jewel tartly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s bothering us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heard me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said shrilly. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to take your drunken friend\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer rising voice rang out above the clatter of the restaurant and a\r\nwaiter came hurrying up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gotta be more quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat fella\xe2\x80\x99s drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s insulting us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh-ha, Gordy,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted the accused. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99d I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned\r\nto the waiter. \xe2\x80\x9cGordy an\xe2\x80\x99 I friends. Been tryin\xe2\x80\x99 help him, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I,\r\nGordy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGordy looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me? Hell, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJewel rose suddenly, and seizing Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s arm assisted him to his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Gordy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, leaning toward him and speaking in a half\r\nwhisper. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s us get out of here. This fella\xe2\x80\x99s got a mean drunk on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGordon allowed himself to be urged to his feet and started toward the\r\ndoor. Jewel turned for a second and addressed the provoker of their\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know all about _you_!\xe2\x80\x9d she said fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cNice friend, you\r\nare, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say. He told me about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she seized Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and together they made their way through\r\nthe curious crowd, paid their check, and went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said the waiter to Peter after they had\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99at? Sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--or get out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter turned to Dean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s beat up this waiter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey advanced toward him, their faces grown stern. The waiter\r\nretreated.\r\n\r\nPeter suddenly reached over to a plate on the table beside him and\r\npicking up a handful of hash tossed it into the air. It descended as a\r\nlanguid parabola in snowflake effect on the heads of those near by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey! Ease up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut him out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Peter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut out that stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter laughed and bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for your kind applause, ladies and gents. If some one will\r\nlend me some more hash and a tall hat we will go on with the act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bouncer bustled up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve gotta get out!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d put in Dean indignantly.\r\n\r\nA crowd of waiters were gathering. \xe2\x80\x9cPut him out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter go, Peter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a short struggle and the two were edged and pushed toward\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got a hat and a coat here!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go get \xe2\x80\x99em and be spry about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bouncer released his hold on Peter, who, adopting a ludicrous air\r\nof extreme cunning, rushed immediately around to the other table,\r\nwhere he burst into derisive laughter and thumbed his nose at the\r\nexasperated waiters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink I just better wait a l\xe2\x80\x99il longer,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced.\r\n\r\nThe chase began. Four waiters were sent around one way and four\r\nanother. Dean caught hold of two of them by the coat, and another\r\nstruggle took place before the pursuit of Peter could be resumed; he\r\nwas finally pinioned after overturning a sugar-bowl and several cups\r\nof coffee. A fresh argument ensued at the cashier\xe2\x80\x99s desk, where Peter\r\nattempted to buy another dish of hash to take with him and throw at\r\npolicemen.\r\n\r\nBut the commotion upon his exit proper was dwarfed by another\r\nphenomenon which drew admiring glances and a prolonged involuntary\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh-h-h!\xe2\x80\x9d from every person in the restaurant.\r\n\r\nThe great plate-glass front had turned to a deep blue, the color of a\r\nMaxfield Parrish moonlight--a blue that seemed to press close upon the\r\npane as if to crowd its way into the restaurant. Dawn had come up in\r\nColumbus Circle, magical, breathless dawn, silhouetting the great\r\nstatue of the immortal Christopher, and mingling in a curious and\r\nuncanny manner with the fading yellow electric light inside.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nMr. In and Mr. Out are not listed by the census-taker. You will search\r\nfor them in vain through the social register or the births, marriages,\r\nand deaths, or the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s credit list. Oblivion has swallowed them\r\nand the testimony that they ever existed at all is vague and shadowy,\r\nand inadmissible in a court of law. Yet I have it upon the best\r\nauthority that for a brief space Mr. In and Mr. Out lived, breathed,\r\nanswered to their names and radiated vivid personalities of their own.\r\n\r\nDuring the brief span of their lives they walked in their native\r\ngarments down the great highway of a great nation; were laughed at,\r\nsworn at, chased, and fled from. Then they passed and were heard of no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThey were already taking form dimly, when a taxi cab with the top open\r\nbreezed down Broadway in the faintest glimmer of May dawn. In this car\r\nsat the souls of Mr. In and Mr. Out discussing with amazement the blue\r\nlight that had so precipitately colored the sky behind the statue of\r\nChristopher Columbus, discussing with bewilderment the old, gray faces\r\nof the early risers which skimmed palely along the street like blown\r\nbits of paper on a gray lake. They were agreed on all things, from the\r\nabsurdity of the bouncer in Childs\xe2\x80\x99 to the absurdity of the business\r\nof life. They were dizzy with the extreme maudlin happiness that the\r\nmorning had awakened in their glowing souls. Indeed, so fresh and\r\nvigorous was their pleasure in living that they felt it should be\r\nexpressed by loud cries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe-ow-ow!\xe2\x80\x9d hooted Peter, making a megaphone with his hands--and Dean\r\njoined in with a call that, though equally significant and symbolic,\r\nderived its resonance from its very inarticulateness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYo-ho! Yea! Yoho! Yo-buba!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFifty-third Street was a bus with a dark, bobbed-hair beauty atop;\r\nFifty-second was a street cleaner who dodged, escaped, and sent up a\r\nyell of, \xe2\x80\x9cLook where you\xe2\x80\x99re aimin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d in a pained and grieved voice. At\r\nFiftieth Street a group of men on a very white sidewalk in front of a\r\nvery white building turned to stare after them, and shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome party, boys!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt Forty-ninth Street Peter turned to Dean. \xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid gravely, squinting up his owlish eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo get some breakfast, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDean agreed--with additions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast and liquor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast and liquor,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Peter, and they looked at each other,\r\nnodding. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s logical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they both burst into loud laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast and liquor! Oh, gosh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Peter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t serve it? Ne\xe2\x80\x99mind. We force \xe2\x80\x99em serve it. Bring pressure bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring logic bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe taxi cut suddenly off Broadway, sailed along a cross street, and\r\nstopped in front of a heavy tomb-like building in Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s idea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe taxi-driver informed them that this was Delmonico\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThis was somewhat puzzling. They were forced to devote several minutes\r\nto intense concentration, for if such an order had been given there\r\nmust have been a reason for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomep\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x99bouta coat,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the taxi-man.\r\n\r\nThat was it. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat and hat. He had left them at\r\nDelmonico\xe2\x80\x99s. Having decided this, they disembarked from the taxi and\r\nstrolled toward the entrance arm in arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey!\xe2\x80\x9d said the taxi-driver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou better pay me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey shook their heads in shocked negation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLater, not now--we give orders, you wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe taxi-driver objected; he wanted his money now. With the scornful\r\ncondescension of men exercising tremendous self-control they paid him.\r\n\r\nInside Peter groped in vain through a dim, deserted check-room in\r\nsearch of his coat and derby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone, I guess. Somebody stole it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome Sheff student.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll probability.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dean, nobly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave mine here too--then we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nboth be dressed the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe removed his overcoat and hat and was hanging them up when his\r\nroving glance was caught and held magnetically by two large squares of\r\ncardboard tacked to the two coat-room doors. The one on the left-hand\r\ndoor bore the word \xe2\x80\x9cIn\xe2\x80\x9d in big black letters, and the one on the\r\nright-hand door flaunted the equally emphatic word \xe2\x80\x9cOut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed happily--\r\n\r\nPeter\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed his pointing finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the signs. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably pair very rare an\xe2\x80\x99 valuable signs. Probably come in handy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter removed the left-hand sign from the door and endeavored to\r\nconceal it about his person. The sign being of considerable\r\nproportions, this was a matter of some difficulty. An idea flung\r\nitself at him, and with an air of dignified mystery he turned his\r\nback. After an instant he wheeled dramatically around, and stretching\r\nout his arms displayed himself to the admiring Dean. He had inserted\r\nthe sign in his vest, completely covering his shirt front. In effect,\r\nthe word \xe2\x80\x9cIn\xe2\x80\x9d had been painted upon his shirt in large black letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoho!\xe2\x80\x9d cheered Dean. \xe2\x80\x9cMister In.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe inserted his own sign in like manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMister Out!\xe2\x80\x9d he announced triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. In meet Mr. Out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey advanced and shook hands. Again laughter overcame them and they\r\nrocked in a shaken spasm of mirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe probably get a flock of breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go--go to the Commodore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArm in arm they sallied out the door, and turning east in Forty-fourth\r\nStreet set out for the Commodore.\r\n\r\nAs they came out a short dark soldier, very pale and tired, who had\r\nbeen wandering listlessly along the sidewalk, turned to look at them.\r\n\r\nHe started over as though to address them, but as they immediately\r\nbent on him glances of withering unrecognition, he waited until they\r\nhad started unsteadily down the street, and then followed at about\r\nforty paces, chuckling to himself and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d over and over\r\nunder his breath, in delighted, anticipatory tones.\r\n\r\nMr. In and Mr. Out were meanwhile exchanging pleasantries concerning\r\ntheir future plans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want liquor; we want breakfast. Neither without the other. One and\r\nindivisible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want both \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was quite light now, and passers-by began to bend curious eyes on\r\nthe pair. Obviously they were engaged in a discussion, which afforded\r\neach of them intense amusement, for occasionally a fit of laughter\r\nwould seize upon them so violently that, still with their arms\r\ninterlocked, they would bend nearly double.\r\n\r\nReaching the Commodore, they exchanged a few spicy epigrams with the\r\nsleepy-eyed doorman, navigated the revolving door with some\r\ndifficulty, and then made their way through a thinly populated but\r\nstartled lobby to the dining-room, where a puzzled waiter showed them\r\nan obscure table in a corner. They studied the bill of fare\r\nhelplessly, telling over the items to each other in puzzled mumbles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t see any liquor here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter reproachfully.\r\n\r\nThe waiter became audible but unintelligible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepeat,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Peter, with patient tolerance, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there seems\r\nto be unexplained and quite distasteful lack of liquor upon bill of\r\nfare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dean confidently, \xe2\x80\x9clet me handle him.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to the\r\nwaiter--\xe2\x80\x9cBring us--bring us--\xe2\x80\x9d he scanned the bill of fare anxiously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring us a quart of champagne and a--a--probably ham sandwich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter looked doubtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring it!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Mr. In and Mr. Out in chorus.\r\n\r\nThe waiter coughed and disappeared. There was a short wait during\r\nwhich they were subjected without their knowledge to a careful\r\nscrutiny by the head-waiter. Then the champagne arrived, and at the\r\nsight of it Mr. In and Mr. Out became jubilant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagine their objecting to us having, champagne for breakfast--jus\xe2\x80\x99\r\nimagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both concentrated upon the vision of such an awesome possibility,\r\nbut the feat was too much for them. It was impossible for their joint\r\nimaginations to conjure up a world where any one might object to any one\r\nelse having champagne for breakfast. The waiter drew the cork with an\r\nenormous _pop_ and their glasses immediately foamed with pale\r\nyellow froth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s health, Mr. In.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s same to you, Mr. Out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter withdrew; the minutes passed; the champagne became low in\r\nthe bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s--it\xe2\x80\x99s mortifying,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dean suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWha\xe2\x80\x99s mortifying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea their objecting us having champagne breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMortifying?\xe2\x80\x9d Peter considered. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, tha\xe2\x80\x99s word--mortifying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain they collapsed into laughter, howled, swayed, rocked back and\r\nforth in their chairs, repeating the word \xe2\x80\x9cmortifying\xe2\x80\x9d over and over\r\nto each other--each repetition seeming to make it only more\r\nbrilliantly absurd.\r\n\r\nAfter a few more gorgeous minutes they decided on another quart. Their\r\nanxious waiter consulted his immediate superior, and this discreet\r\nperson gave implicit instructions that no more champagne should be\r\nserved. Their check was brought.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, arm in arm, they left the Commodore and made their\r\nway through a curious, staring crowd along Forty-second Street, and up\r\nVanderbilt Avenue to the Biltmore. There, with sudden cunning, they\r\nrose to the occasion and traversed the lobby, walking fast and\r\nstanding unnaturally erect.\r\n\r\nOnce in the dining-room they repeated their performance. They were\r\ntorn between intermittent convulsive laughter and sudden spasmodic\r\ndiscussions of politics, college, and the sunny state of their\r\ndispositions. Their watches told them that it was now nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nand a dim idea was born in them that they were on a memorable party,\r\nsomething that they would remember always. They lingered over the\r\nsecond bottle. Either of them had only to mention the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmortifying\xe2\x80\x9d to send them both into riotous gasps. The dining-room was\r\nwhirring and shifting now; a curious lightness permeated and rarefied\r\nthe heavy air.\r\n\r\nThey paid their check and walked out into the lobby.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that the exterior doors revolved for the\r\nthousandth time that morning, and admitted into the lobby a very pale\r\nyoung beauty with dark circles under her eyes, attired in a\r\nmuch-rumpled evening dress. She was accompanied by a plain stout man,\r\nobviously not an appropriate escort.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the stairs this couple encountered Mr. In and Mr. Out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdith,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr. In, stepping toward her hilariously and making a\r\nsweeping bow, \xe2\x80\x9cdarling, good morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stout man glanced questioningly at Edith, as if merely asking her\r\npermission to throw this man summarily out of the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Scuse familiarity,\xe2\x80\x9d added Peter, as an afterthought. \xe2\x80\x9cEdith,\r\ngood-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized Dean\xe2\x80\x99s elbow and impelled him into the foreground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeet Mr. In, Edith, my bes\xe2\x80\x99 frien\xe2\x80\x99. Inseparable. Mr. In and Mr. Out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Out advanced and bowed; in fact, he advanced so far and bowed so\r\nlow that he tipped slightly forward and only kept his balance by\r\nplacing a hand lightly on Edith\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Mr. Out, Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled pleasantly. \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99misterin Misterout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Smisterinanout,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter proudly.\r\n\r\nBut Edith stared straight by them, her eyes fixed on some infinite\r\nspeck in the gallery above her. She nodded slightly to the stout man,\r\nwho advanced bull-like and with a sturdy brisk gesture pushed Mr. In\r\nand Mr. Out to either side. Through this alley he and Edith walked.\r\n\r\nBut ten paces farther on Edith stopped again--stopped and pointed to a\r\nshort, dark soldier who was eying the crowd in general, and the\r\ntableau of Mr. In and Mr. Out in particular, with a sort of puzzled,\r\nspell-bound awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Edith. \xe2\x80\x9cSee there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice rose, became somewhat shrill. Her pointing finger shook\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the soldier who broke my brother\xe2\x80\x99s leg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were a dozen exclamations; a man in a cutaway coat left his\r\nplace near the desk and advanced alertly; the stout person made a sort\r\nof lightning-like spring toward the short, dark soldier, and then the\r\nlobby closed around the little group and blotted them from the sight\r\nof Mr. In and Mr. Out.\r\n\r\nBut to Mr. In and Mr. Out this event was merely a particolored\r\niridescent segment of a whirring, spinning world.\r\n\r\nThey heard loud voices; they saw the stout man spring; the picture\r\nsuddenly blurred.\r\n\r\nThen they were in an elevator bound skyward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat floor, please?\xe2\x80\x9d said the elevator man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny floor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. In.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTop floor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the top floor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elevator man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave another floor put on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. In.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Out.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nIn a bedroom of a small hotel just off Sixth Avenue Gordon Sterrett\r\nawoke with a pain in the back of his head and a sick throbbing in all\r\nhis veins. He looked at the dusky gray shadows in the corners of the\r\nroom and at a raw place on a large leather chair in the corner where\r\nit had long been in use. He saw clothes, dishevelled, rumpled clothes\r\non the floor and he smelt stale cigarette smoke and stale liquor. The\r\nwindows were tight shut. Outside the bright sunlight had thrown a\r\ndust-filled beam across the sill--a beam broken by the head of the\r\nwide wooden bed in which he had slept. He lay very quiet--comatose,\r\ndrugged, his eyes wide, his mind clicking wildly like an unoiled\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nIt must have been thirty seconds after he perceived the sunbeam with\r\nthe dust on it and the rip on the large leather chair that he had the\r\nsense of life close beside him, and it was another thirty seconds\r\nafter that before that he realized that he was irrevocably married to\r\nJewel Hudson.\r\n\r\nHe went out half an hour later and bought a revolver at a sporting\r\ngoods store. Then he took a taxi to the room where he had been living\r\non East Twenty-seventh Street, and, leaning across the table that held\r\nhis drawing materials, fired a cartridge into his head just behind the\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORCELAIN AND PINK\r\n\r\n\r\n_A room in the down-stairs of a summer cottage. High around the wall\r\nruns an art frieze of a fisherman with a pile of nets at his feet and\r\na ship on a crimson ocean, a fisherman with a pile of nets at his feet\r\nand a ship on a crimson ocean, a fisherman with a pile of nets at his\r\nfeet and so on. In one place on the frieze there is an overlapping--here\r\nwe have half a fisherman with half a pile of nets at his foot,\r\ncrowded damply against half a ship on half a crimson ocean.\r\nThe frieze is not in the plot, but frankly it fascinates me. I could\r\ncontinue indefinitely, but I am distracted by one of the two objects\r\nin the room--a blue porcelain bath-tub. It has character, this\r\nbath-tub. It is not one of the new racing bodies, but is small with a\r\nhigh tonneau and looks as if it were going to jump; discouraged,\r\nhowever, by the shortness of its legs, it has submitted to its\r\nenvironment and to its coat of sky-blue paint. But it grumpily refuses\r\nto allow any patron completely to stretch his legs--which brings us\r\nneatly to the second object in the room:_\r\n\r\n_It is a girl--clearly an appendage to the bath-tub, only her head and\r\nthroat--beautiful girls have throats instead of necks--and a\r\nsuggestion of shoulder appearing above the side. For the first ten\r\nminutes of the play the audience is engrossed in wondering if she\r\nreally is playing the game fairly and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t any clothes on or whether\r\nit is being cheated and she is dressed._\r\n\r\n_The girl\xe2\x80\x99s name is_ JULIE MARVIS. _From the proud way she sits\r\nup in the bath-tub we deduce that she is not very tall and that she\r\ncarries herself well. When she smiles, her upper lip rolls a little\r\nand reminds you of an Easter Bunny. She is within whispering distance\r\nof twenty years old._\r\n\r\n_One thing more--above and to the right of the bath-tub is a window.\r\nIt is narrow and has a wide sill; it lets in much sunshine, but\r\neffectually prevents any one who looks in from seeing the bath-tub.\r\nYou begin to suspect the plot?_\r\n\r\n_We open, conventionally enough, with a song, but, as the startled\r\ngasp of the audience quite drowns out the first half, we will give\r\nonly the last of it:_\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_In an airy sophrano--enthusiastico_)\r\n\r\n   When Caesar did the Chicago\r\n     He was a graceful child,\r\n       Those sacred chickens\r\n       Just raised the dickens\r\n     The Vestal Virgins went wild.\r\n   Whenever the Nervii got nervy\r\n     He gave them an awful razz\r\n       They shook in their shoes\r\n       With the Consular blues\r\n     The Imperial Roman Jazz\r\n\r\n(_During the wild applause that follows_ JULIE _modestly moves\r\nher arms and makes waves on the surface of the water--at least we\r\nsuppose she does. Then the door on the left opens and_ LOIS MARVIS\r\n_enters, dressed but carrying garments and towels._ LOIS _is a\r\nyear older than_ JULIE _and is nearly her double in face and\r\nvoice, but in her clothes and expression are the marks of the\r\nconservative. Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99ve guessed it. Mistaken identity is the old\r\nrusty pivot upon which the plot turns._)\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Starting_) Oh, \xe2\x80\x99scuse me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were here.\r\n\r\nJULIE: Oh, hello. I\xe2\x80\x99m giving a little concert--\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Interrupting_) Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you lock the door?\r\n\r\nJULIE: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\r\n\r\nLOIS: Of course you didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Do you think I just walked through it?\r\n\r\nJULIE: I thought you picked the lock, dearest.\r\n\r\nLOIS: You\xe2\x80\x99re _so_ careless.\r\n\r\nJULIE: No. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy as a garbage-man\xe2\x80\x99s dog and I\xe2\x80\x99m giving a little\r\nconcert.\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Severely_) Grow up!\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Waving a pink arm around the room_) The walls reflect\r\nthe sound, you see. That\xe2\x80\x99s why there\xe2\x80\x99s something very beautiful about\r\nsinging in a bath-tub. It gives an effect of surpassing loveliness.\r\nCan I render you a selection?\r\n\r\nLOIS: I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d hurry out of the tub.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Shaking her head thoughtfully_) Can\xe2\x80\x99t be hurried. This\r\nis my kingdom at present, Godliness.\r\n\r\nLOIS: Why the mellow name?\r\n\r\nJULIE: Because you\xe2\x80\x99re next to Cleanliness. Don\xe2\x80\x99t throw anything\r\nplease!\r\n\r\nLOIS: How long will you be?\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_After some consideration_) Not less than fifteen nor\r\nmore than twenty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nLOIS: As a favor to me will you make it ten?\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Reminiscing_) Oh, Godliness, do you remember a day in\r\nthe chill of last January when one Julie, famous for her Easter-rabbit\r\nsmile, was going out and there was scarcely any hot water and young\r\nJulie had just filled the tub for her own little self when the wicked\r\nsister came and did bathe herself therein, forcing the young Julie to\r\nperform her ablutions with cold cream--which is expensive and a darn\r\nlot of troubles?\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Impatiently_) Then you won\xe2\x80\x99t hurry?\r\n\r\nJULIE: Why should I?\r\n\r\nLOIS: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a date.\r\n\r\nJULIE: Here at the house?\r\n\r\nLOIS: None of your business.\r\n\r\n(JULIE _shrugs the visible tips of her shoulders and stirs the water\r\ninto ripples._)\r\n\r\nJULIE: So be it.\r\n\r\nLOIS: Oh, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, yes! I have a date here, at the house--in\r\na way.\r\n\r\nJULIE: In a way?\r\n\r\nLOIS: He isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming in. He\xe2\x80\x99s calling for me and we\xe2\x80\x99re walking.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Raising her eyebrows_) Oh, the plot clears. It\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nliterary Mr. Calkins. I thought you promised mother you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ninvite him in.\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Desperately_) She\xe2\x80\x99s so idiotic. She detests him because\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s just got a divorce. Of course she\xe2\x80\x99s had more experience than I\r\nhave, but--\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Wisely_) Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her kid you! Experience is the\r\nbiggest gold brick in the world. All older people have it for sale.\r\n\r\nLOIS: I like him. We talk literature.\r\n\r\nJULIE: Oh, so that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed all these weighty books around\r\nthe house lately.\r\n\r\nLOIS: He lends them to me.\r\n\r\nJULIE: Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to play his game. When in Rome do as the\r\nRomans would like to do. But I\xe2\x80\x99m through with books. I\xe2\x80\x99m all educated.\r\n\r\nLOIS: You\xe2\x80\x99re very inconsistent--last summer you read every day.\r\n\r\nJULIE: If I were consistent I\xe2\x80\x99d still be living on warm milk out of a\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\nLOIS: Yes, and probably my bottle. But I like Mr. Calkins.\r\n\r\nJULIE: I never met him.\r\n\r\nLOIS: Well, will you hurry up?\r\n\r\nJULIE: Yes. (_After a pause_) I wait till the water gets tepid\r\nand then I let in more hot.\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Sarcastically_) How interesting!\r\n\r\nJULIE: \xe2\x80\x99Member when we used to play \xe2\x80\x9csoapo\xe2\x80\x9d?\r\n\r\nLOIS: Yes--and ten years old. I\xe2\x80\x99m really quite surprised that you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t play it still.\r\n\r\nJULIE: I do. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to in a minute.\r\n\r\nLOIS: Silly game.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Warmly_) No, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s good for the nerves. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbet you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten how to play it.\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Defiantly_) No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. You--you get the tub all full\r\nof soapsuds and then you get up on the edge and slide down.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Shaking her head scornfully_) Huh! That\xe2\x80\x99s only part of\r\nit. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to slide down without touching your hand or feet--\r\n\r\nLOIS:(_Impatiently_) Oh, Lord! What do I care? I wish we\xe2\x80\x99d either\r\nstop coming here in the summer or else get a house with two bath-tubs.\r\n\r\nJULIE: You can buy yourself a little tin one, or use the hose----\r\n\r\nLOIS: Oh, shut up!\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Irrelevantly_) Leave the towel.\r\n\r\nLOIS: What?\r\n\r\nJULIE: Leave the towel when you go.\r\n\r\nLOIS: This towel?\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Sweetly_) Yes, I forgot my towel.\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Looking around for the first time_) Why, you idiot! You\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t even a kimono.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Also looking around_) Why, so I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Suspicion growing on her_) How did you get here?\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Laughing_) I guess I--I guess I whisked here. You know--a\r\nwhite form whisking down the stairs and--\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Scandalized_) Why, you little wretch. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you any\r\npride or self-respect?\r\n\r\nJULIE: Lots of both. I think that proves it. I looked very well. I\r\nreally am rather cute in my natural state.\r\n\r\nLOIS: Well, you--\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Thinking aloud_) I wish people didn\xe2\x80\x99t wear any clothes.\r\nI guess I ought to have been a pagan or a native or something.\r\n\r\nLOIS: You\xe2\x80\x99re a--\r\n\r\nJULIE: I dreamt last night that one Sunday in church a small boy\r\nbrought in a magnet that attracted cloth. He attracted the clothes\r\nright off of everybody; put them in an awful state; people were crying\r\nand shrieking and carrying on as if they\xe2\x80\x99d just discovered their skins\r\nfor the first time. Only _I_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t care. So I just laughed. I\r\nhad to pass the collection plate because nobody else would.\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Who has turned a deaf ear to this speech_) Do you mean to\r\ntell me that if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come you\xe2\x80\x99d have run back to your\r\nroom--un--unclothed?\r\n\r\nJULIE: _Au naturel_ is so much nicer.\r\n\r\nLOIS: Suppose there had been some one in the living-room.\r\n\r\nJULIE: There never has been yet.\r\n\r\nLOIS: Yet! Good grief! How long--\r\n\r\nJULIE: Besides, I usually have a towel.\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Completely overcome_) Golly! You ought to be spanked. I\r\nhope you get caught. I hope there\xe2\x80\x99s a dozen ministers in the\r\nliving-room when you come out--and their wives, and their daughters.\r\n\r\nJULIE: There wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be room for them in the living-room, answered\r\nClean Kate of the Laundry District.\r\n\r\nLOIS: All right. You\xe2\x80\x99ve made your own--bath-tub; you can lie in it.\r\n\r\n(_LOIS starts determinedly for the door._)\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_In alarm_) Hey! Hey! I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the k\xe2\x80\x99mono, but\r\nI want the towel. I can\xe2\x80\x99t dry myself on a piece of soap and a wet\r\nwash-rag.\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Obstinately_) I won\xe2\x80\x99t humor such a creature. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nto dry yourself the best way you can. You can roll on the floor like\r\nthe animals do that don\xe2\x80\x99t wear any clothes.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Complacent again_) All right. Get out!\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_Haughtily_) Huh!\r\n\r\n(JULIE _turns on the cold water and with her finger directs a\r\nparabolic stream at_ LOIS. LOIS _retires quickly, slamming the door\r\nafter her._ JULIE _laughs and turns off the water_)\r\n\r\nJULIE: (Singing)\r\n\r\n  When the Arrow-collar man\r\n    Meets the D\xe2\x80\x99jer-kiss girl\r\n  On the smokeless Sante F\xc3\xa9\r\n    Her Pebeco smile\r\n    Her Lucile style\r\n  De dum da-de-dum one day--\r\n\r\n(_She changes to a whistle and leans forward to turn on the taps,\r\nbut is startled by three loud banging noises in the pipes. Silence for\r\na moment--then she puts her mouth down near the spigot as if it were a\r\ntelephone_)\r\n\r\nJULIE: Hello! (_No answer_) Are you a plumber? (_No answer_)\r\nAre you the water department? (_One loud, hollow bang_) What do\r\nyou want? (_No answer_) I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re a ghost. Are you? (_No\r\nanswer_) Well, then, stop banging. (_She reaches out and turns on\r\nthe warm tap. No water flows. Again she puts her mouth down close to\r\nthe spigot_) If you\xe2\x80\x99re the plumber that\xe2\x80\x99s a mean trick. Turn it on\r\nfor a fellow. (_Two loud, hollow bangs_) Don\xe2\x80\x99t argue! I want\r\nwater--water! _Water_!\r\n\r\n(_A young man\xe2\x80\x99s head appears in the window--a head decorated with a\r\nslim mustache and sympathetic eyes. These last stare, and though they\r\ncan see nothing but many fishermen with nets and much crimson ocean,\r\nthey decide him to speak_)\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Some one fainted?\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Starting up, all ears immediately_) Jumping cats!\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: (_Helpfully_) Water\xe2\x80\x99s no good for fits.\r\n\r\nJULIE: Fits! Who said anything about fits!\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: You said something about a cat jumping.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Decidedly_) I did not!\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Well, we can talk it over later, Are you ready to go\r\nout? Or do you still feel that if you go with me just now everybody\r\nwill gossip?\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Smiling_) Gossip! Would they? It\xe2\x80\x99d be more than\r\ngossip--it\xe2\x80\x99d be a regular scandal.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Here, you\xe2\x80\x99re going it a little strong. Your family\r\nmight be somewhat disgruntled--but to the pure all things are\r\nsuggestive. No one else would even give it a thought, except a few old\r\nwomen. Come on.\r\n\r\nJULIE: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you ask.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Do you imagine we\xe2\x80\x99d have a crowd following us?\r\n\r\nJULIE: A crowd? There\xe2\x80\x99d be a special, all-steel, buffet train leaving\r\nNew York hourly.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Say, are you house-cleaning?\r\n\r\nJULIE: Why?\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: I see all the pictures are off the walls.\r\n\r\nJULIE: Why, we never have pictures in this room.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Odd, I never heard of a room without pictures or\r\ntapestry or panelling or something.\r\n\r\nJULIE: There\xe2\x80\x99s not even any furniture in here.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: What a strange house!\r\n\r\nJULIE: It depend on the angle you see it from.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: (_Sentimentally_) It\xe2\x80\x99s so nice talking to you like\r\nthis--when you\xe2\x80\x99re merely a voice. I\xe2\x80\x99m rather glad I can\xe2\x80\x99t see you.\r\n\r\nJULIE; (_Gratefully_) So am I.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: What color are you wearing?\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_After a critical survey of her shoulders_) Why, I guess\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of pinkish white.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Is it becoming to you?\r\n\r\nJULIE: Very. It\xe2\x80\x99s--it\xe2\x80\x99s old. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it for a long while.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: I thought you hated old clothes.\r\n\r\nJULIE: I do but this was a birthday present and I sort of have to wear\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Pinkish-white. Well I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet it\xe2\x80\x99s divine. Is it in\r\nstyle?\r\n\r\nJULIE: Quite. It\xe2\x80\x99s very simple, standard model.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: What a voice you have! How it echoes! Sometimes I shut\r\nmy eyes and seem to see you in a far desert island calling for me. And\r\nI plunge toward you through the surf, hearing you call as you stand\r\nthere, water stretching on both sides of you--\r\n\r\n(_The soap slips from the side of the tub and splashes in. The young\r\nman blinks_)\r\n\r\nYOUNG MAN: What was that? Did I dream it?\r\n\r\nJULIE: Yes. You\xe2\x80\x99re--you\xe2\x80\x99re very poetic, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: (_Dreamily_) No. I do prose. I do verse only when\r\nI am stirred.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Murmuring_) Stirred by a spoon--\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: I have always loved poetry. I can remember to this day\r\nthe first poem I ever learned by heart. It was \xe2\x80\x9cEvangeline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJULIE: That\xe2\x80\x99s a fib.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Did I say \xe2\x80\x9cEvangeline\xe2\x80\x9d? I meant \xe2\x80\x9cThe Skeleton in\r\nArmor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJULIE: I\xe2\x80\x99m a low-brow. But I can remember my first poem. It had one\r\nverse:\r\n\r\n   Parker and Davis\r\n   Sittin\xe2\x80\x99 on a fence\r\n   Tryne to make a dollar\r\n   Outa fif-teen cents.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: (_Eagerly_) Are you growing fond of literature?\r\n\r\nJULIE: If it\xe2\x80\x99s not too ancient or complicated or depressing. Same way\r\nwith people. I usually like \xe2\x80\x99em not too ancient or complicated or\r\ndepressing.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Of course I\xe2\x80\x99ve read enormously. You told me last night\r\nthat you were very fond of Walter Scott.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Considering_) Scott? Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read \xe2\x80\x9cIvanhoe\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last of the Mohicans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: That\xe2\x80\x99s by Cooper.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Angrily_) \xe2\x80\x9cIvanhoe\xe2\x80\x9d is? You\xe2\x80\x99re crazy! I guess I know. I\r\nread it.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last of the Mohicans\xe2\x80\x9d is by Cooper.\r\n\r\nJULIE: What do I care! I like O. Henry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how he ever wrote\r\nthose stories. Most of them he wrote in prison. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ballad of Reading\r\nGaol\xe2\x80\x9d he made up in prison.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: (_Biting his lip_) Literature--literature! How\r\nmuch it has meant to me!\r\n\r\nJULIE: Well, as Gaby Deslys said to Mr. Bergson, with my looks and\r\nyour brains there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: (_Laughing_) You certainly are hard to keep up\r\nwith. One day you\xe2\x80\x99re awfully pleasant and the next you\xe2\x80\x99re in a mood.\r\nIf I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand your temperament so well--\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Impatiently_) Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re one of these amateur\r\ncharacter-readers, are you? Size people up in five minutes and then\r\nlook wise whenever they\xe2\x80\x99re mentioned. I hate that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: I don\xe2\x80\x99t boast of sizing you up. You\xe2\x80\x99re most mysterious,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll admit.\r\n\r\nJULIE: There\xe2\x80\x99s only two mysterious people in history.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Who are they?\r\n\r\nJULIE: The Man with the Iron Mask and the fella who says \xe2\x80\x9cug uh-glug\r\nuh-glug uh-glug\xe2\x80\x9d when the line is busy.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: You _are_ mysterious. I love you. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nbeautiful, intelligent, and virtuous, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the rarest known\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nJULIE: You\xe2\x80\x99re a historian. Tell me if there are any bath-tubs in\r\nhistory. I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve been frightfully neglected.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Bath-tubs! Let\xe2\x80\x99s see. Well, Agamemnon was stabbed in\r\nhis bath-tub. And Charlotte Corday stabbed Marat in his bath-tub.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Sighing_) Way back there! Nothing new besides the sun,\r\nis there? Why only yesterday I picked up a musical-comedy score that\r\nmust have been at least twenty years old; and there on the cover it\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shimmies of Normandy,\xe2\x80\x9d but shimmie was spelt the old way,\r\nwith a \xe2\x80\x9cC.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: I loathe these modern dances. Oh, Lois, I wish I could\r\nsee you. Come to the window.\r\n\r\n(_There is a loud bang in the water-pipe and suddenly the flow\r\nstarts from the open taps. Julie turns them off quickly_)\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: (_Puzzled_) What on earth was that?\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Ingeniously_) I heard something, too.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Sounded like running water.\r\n\r\nJULIE: Didn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Strange like it. As a matter of fact I was filling\r\nthe gold-fish bowl.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: (_Still puzzled_) What was that banging noise?\r\n\r\nJULIE: One of the fish snapping his golden jaws.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: (_With sudden resolution_) Lois, I love you. I am\r\nnot a mundane man but I am a forger--\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Interested at once_) Oh, how fascinating.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN:--a forger ahead. Lois, I want you.\r\n\r\nJULIE: (_Skeptically_) Huh! What you really want is for the world\r\nto come to attention and stand there till you give \xe2\x80\x9cRest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: Lois I--Lois I--\r\n\r\n(_He stops as_ LOIS _opens the door, comes in, and bangs it behind\r\nher. She looks peevishly at_ JULIE _and then suddenly catches\r\nsight of the young man in the window_)\r\n\r\nLOIS: (_In horror_) Mr. Calkins!\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: (_Surprised_) Why I thought you said you were\r\nwearing pinkish white!\r\n\r\n(_After one despairing stare_ LOIS _shrieks, throws up her\r\nhands in surrender, and sinks to the floor._)\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG MAN: (_In great alarm_) Good Lord!

Unger came from a family that had been well known in Hades--a\r\nsmall town on the Mississippi River--for several generations. John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather had held the amateur golf championship through many a heated\r\ncontest; Mrs. Unger was known \xe2\x80\x9cfrom hot-box to hot-bed,\xe2\x80\x9d as the local\r\nphrase went, for her political addresses; and young John T. Unger, who\r\nhad just turned sixteen, had danced all the latest dances from New\r\nYork before he put on long trousers. And now, for a certain time, he\r\nwas to be away from home. That respect for a New England education\r\nwhich is the bane of all provincial places, which drains them yearly\r\nof their most promising young men, had seized upon his parents.\r\nNothing would suit them but that he should go to St. Midas\xe2\x80\x99s School\r\nnear Boston--Hades was too small to hold their darling and gifted son.\r\n\r\nNow in Hades--as you know if you ever have been there--the names of\r\nthe more fashionable preparatory schools and colleges mean very\r\nlittle. The inhabitants have been so long out of the world that,\r\nthough they make a show of keeping up-to-date in dress and manners and\r\nliterature, they depend to a great extent on hearsay, and a function\r\nthat in Hades would be considered elaborate would doubtless be hailed\r\nby a Chicago beef-princess as \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps a little tacky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn T. Unger was on the eve of departure. Mrs. Unger, with maternal\r\nfatuity, packed his trunks full of linen suits and electric fans, and\r\nMr. Unger presented his son with an asbestos pocket-book stuffed with\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, you are always welcome here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can be sure,\r\nboy, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the home fires burning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d answered John huskily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget who you are and where you come from,\xe2\x80\x9d continued his\r\nfather proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cand you can do nothing to harm you. You are an\r\nUnger--from Hades.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the old man and the young shook hands, and John walked away with\r\ntears streaming from his eyes. Ten minutes later he had passed outside\r\nthe city limits and he stopped to glance back for the last time. Over\r\nthe gates the old-fashioned Victorian motto seemed strangely\r\nattractive to him. His father had tried time and time again to have it\r\nchanged to something with a little more push and verve about it, such\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cHades--Your Opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d or else a plain \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome\xe2\x80\x9d sign set over\r\na hearty handshake pricked out in electric lights. The old motto was a\r\nlittle depressing, Mr. Unger had thought--but now ....\r\n\r\nSo John took his look and then set his face resolutely toward his\r\ndestination. And, as he turned away, the lights of Hades against the\r\nsky seemed full of a warm and passionate beauty.\r\n\r\n       *       *        *       *        *\r\n\r\nSt. Midas\xe2\x80\x99s School is half an hour from Boston in a Rolls-Pierce\r\nmotor-car. The actual distance will never be known, for no one, except\r\nJohn T. Unger, had ever arrived there save in a Rolls-Pierce and\r\nprobably no one ever will again. St. Midas\xe2\x80\x99s is the most expensive and\r\nthe most exclusive boys\xe2\x80\x99 preparatory school in the world.\r\n\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s first two years there passed pleasantly. The fathers of all the\r\nboys were money-kings, and John spent his summer visiting at\r\nfashionable resorts. While he was very fond of all the boys he\r\nvisited, their fathers struck him as being much of a piece, and in his\r\nboyish way he often wondered at their exceeding sameness. When he told\r\nthem where his home was they would ask jovially, \xe2\x80\x9cPretty hot down\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d and John would muster a faint smile and answer, \xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d His response would have been heartier had they not all made this\r\njoke--at best varying it with, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it hot enough for you down there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich he hated just as much.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of his second year at school, a quiet, handsome boy\r\nnamed Percy Washington had been put in John\xe2\x80\x99s form. The new-comer was\r\npleasant in his manner and exceedingly well dressed even for St.\r\nMidas\xe2\x80\x99s, but for some reason he kept aloof from the other boys. The\r\nonly person with whom he was intimate was John T. Unger, but even to\r\nJohn he was entirely uncommunicative concerning his home or his\r\nfamily. That he was wealthy went without saying, but beyond a few such\r\ndeductions John knew little of his friend, so it promised rich\r\nconfectionery for his curiosity when Percy invited him to spend the\r\nsummer at his home \xe2\x80\x9cin the West.\xe2\x80\x9d He accepted, without hesitation.\r\n\r\nIt was only when they were in the train that Percy became, for the\r\nfirst time, rather communicative. One day while they were eating lunch\r\nin the dining-car and discussing the imperfect characters of several\r\nof the boys at school, Percy suddenly changed his tone and made an\r\nabrupt remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis by far the richest man in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said John politely. He could think of no answer to make to this\r\nconfidence. He considered \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very nice,\xe2\x80\x9d but it sounded hollow\r\nand was on the point of saying, \xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d but refrained since it would\r\nseem to question Percy\xe2\x80\x99s statement. And such an astounding statement\r\ncould scarcely be questioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy far the richest,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Percy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was reading in the _World Almanac_,\xe2\x80\x9d began John, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there\r\nwas one man in America with an income of over five million a year and\r\nfour men with incomes of over three million a year, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they\xe2\x80\x99re nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d Percy\xe2\x80\x99s mouth was a half-moon of scorn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch-penny capitalists, financial small-fry, petty merchants and\r\nmoney-lenders. My father could buy them out and not know he\xe2\x80\x99d done\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how does he--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy haven\xe2\x80\x99t they put down _his_ income-tax? Because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npay any. At least he pays a little one--but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay any on his\r\n_real_ income.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be very rich,\xe2\x80\x9d said John simply, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad. I like very rich\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe richer a fella is, the better I like him.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a look of\r\npassionate frankness upon his dark face. \xe2\x80\x9cI visited the\r\nSchnlitzer-Murphys last Easter. Vivian Schnlitzer-Murphy had rubies as\r\nbig as hen\xe2\x80\x99s eggs, and sapphires that were like globes with lights\r\ninside them--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love jewels,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed Percy enthusiastically. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant any one at school to know about it, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got quite a\r\ncollection myself. I used to collect them instead of stamps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd diamonds,\xe2\x80\x9d continued John eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Schnlitzer-Murphys had\r\ndiamonds as big as walnuts--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d Percy had leaned forward and dropped his voice to a\r\nlow whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing at all. My father has a diamond bigger\r\nthan the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Montana sunset lay between two mountains like a gigantic bruise\r\nfrom which dark arteries spread themselves over a poisoned sky. An\r\nimmense distance under the sky crouched the village of Fish, minute,\r\ndismal, and forgotten. There were twelve men, so it was said, in the\r\nvillage of Fish, twelve sombre and inexplicable souls who sucked a\r\nlean milk from the almost literally bare rock upon which a mysterious\r\npopulatory force had begotten them. They had become a race apart,\r\nthese twelve men of Fish, like some species developed by an early whim\r\nof nature, which on second thought had abandoned them to struggle and\r\nextermination.\r\n\r\nOut of the blue-black bruise in the distance crept a long line of\r\nmoving lights upon the desolation of the land, and the twelve men of\r\nFish gathered like ghosts at the shanty depot to watch the passing of\r\nthe seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock train, the Transcontinental Express from Chicago.\r\nSix times or so a year the Transcontinental Express, through some\r\ninconceivable jurisdiction, stopped at the village of Fish, and when\r\nthis occurred a figure or so would disembark, mount into a buggy that\r\nalways appeared from out of the dusk, and drive off toward the bruised\r\nsunset. The observation of this pointless and preposterous phenomenon\r\nhad become a sort of cult among the men of Fish. To observe, that was\r\nall; there remained in them none of the vital quality of illusion\r\nwhich would make them wonder or speculate, else a religion might have\r\ngrown up around these mysterious visitations. But the men of Fish were\r\nbeyond all religion--the barest and most savage tenets of even\r\nChristianity could gain no foothold on that barren rock--so there was\r\nno altar, no priest, no sacrifice; only each night at seven the silent\r\nconcourse by the shanty depot, a congregation who lifted up a prayer\r\nof dim, anaemic wonder.\r\n\r\nOn this June night, the Great Brakeman, whom, had they deified any\r\none, they might well have chosen as their celestial protagonist, had\r\nordained that the seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock train should leave its human (or\r\ninhuman) deposit at Fish. At two minutes after seven Percy Washington\r\nand John T. Unger disembarked, hurried past the spellbound, the agape,\r\nthe fearsome eyes of the twelve men of Fish, mounted into a buggy\r\nwhich had obviously appeared from nowhere, and drove away.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour, when the twilight had coagulated into dark, the\r\nsilent negro who was driving the buggy hailed an opaque body somewhere\r\nahead of them in the gloom. In response to his cry, it turned upon\r\nthem a luminous disc which regarded them like a malignant eye out of\r\nthe unfathomable night. As they came closer, John saw that it was the\r\ntail-light of an immense automobile, larger and more magnificent than\r\nany he had ever seen. Its body was of gleaming metal richer than\r\nnickel and lighter than silver, and the hubs of the wheels were\r\nstudded with iridescent geometric figures of green and yellow--John\r\ndid not dare to guess whether they were glass or jewel.\r\n\r\nTwo negroes, dressed in glittering livery such as one sees in pictures\r\nof royal processions in London, were standing at attention beside the\r\ncar and, as the two young men dismounted from the buggy, they were\r\ngreeted in some language which the guest could not understand, but\r\nwhich seemed to be an extreme form of the Southern negro\xe2\x80\x99s dialect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Percy to his friend, as their trunks were tossed to the\r\nebony roof of the limousine. \xe2\x80\x9cSorry we had to bring you this far in\r\nthat buggy, but of course it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for the people on the train\r\nor those God-forsaken fellas in Fish to see this automobile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGosh! What a car!\xe2\x80\x9d This ejaculation was provoked by its interior.\r\nJohn saw that the upholstery consisted of a thousand minute and\r\nexquisite tapestries of silk, woven with jewels and embroideries, and\r\nset upon a background of cloth of gold. The two armchair seats in\r\nwhich the boys luxuriated were covered with stuff that resembled\r\nduvetyn, but seemed woven in numberless colours of the ends of ostrich\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a car!\xe2\x80\x9d cried John again, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis thing?\xe2\x80\x9d Percy laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s just an old junk we use for a\r\nstation wagon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time they were gliding along through the darkness toward the\r\nbreak between the two mountains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be there in an hour and a half,\xe2\x80\x9d said Percy, looking at the\r\nclock. \xe2\x80\x9cI may as well tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be like anything you\r\never saw before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the car was any indication of what John would see, he was prepared\r\nto be astonished indeed. The simple piety prevalent in Hades has the\r\nearnest worship of and respect for riches as the first article of its\r\ncreed--had John felt otherwise than radiantly humble before them, his\r\nparents would have turned away in horror at the blasphemy.\r\n\r\nThey had now reached and were entering the break between the two\r\nmountains and almost immediately the way became much rougher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the moon shone down here, you\xe2\x80\x99d see that we\xe2\x80\x99re in a big gulch,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Percy, trying to peer out of the window. He spoke a few words\r\ninto the mouthpiece and immediately the footman turned on a\r\nsearchlight and swept the hillsides with an immense beam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRocky, you see. An ordinary car would be knocked to pieces in half an\r\nhour. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99d take a tank to navigate it unless you knew the\r\nway. You notice we\xe2\x80\x99re going uphill now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were obviously ascending, and within a few minutes the car was\r\ncrossing a high rise, where they caught a glimpse of a pale moon newly\r\nrisen in the distance. The car stopped suddenly and several figures\r\ntook shape out of the dark beside it--these were negroes also. Again\r\nthe two young men were saluted in the same dimly recognisable dialect;\r\nthen the negroes set to work and four immense cables dangling from\r\noverhead were attached with hooks to the hubs of the great jewelled\r\nwheels. At a resounding \xe2\x80\x9cHey-yah!\xe2\x80\x9d John felt the car being lifted\r\nslowly from the ground--up and up--clear of the tallest rocks on both\r\nsides--then higher, until he could see a wavy, moonlit valley\r\nstretched out before him in sharp contrast to the quagmire of rocks\r\nthat they had just left. Only on one side was there still rock--and\r\nthen suddenly there was no rock beside them or anywhere around.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent that they had surmounted some immense knife-blade of\r\nstone, projecting perpendicularly into the air. In a moment they were\r\ngoing down again, and finally with a soft bump they were landed upon\r\nthe smooth earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst is over,\xe2\x80\x9d said Percy, squinting out the window. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nfive miles from here, and our own road--tapestry brick--all the way.\r\nThis belongs to us. This is where the United States ends, father\r\nsays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we in Canada?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not. We\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of the Montana Rockies. But you are\r\nnow on the only five square miles of land in the country that\xe2\x80\x99s never\r\nbeen surveyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Did they forget it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Percy, grinning, \xe2\x80\x9cthey tried to do it three times. The\r\nfirst time my grandfather corrupted a whole department of the State\r\nsurvey; the second time he had the official maps of the United States\r\ntinkered with--that held them for fifteen years. The last time was\r\nharder. My father fixed it so that their compasses were in the\r\nstrongest magnetic field ever artificially set up. He had a whole set\r\nof surveying instruments made with a slight defection that would allow\r\nfor this territory not to appear, and he substituted them for the ones\r\nthat were to be used. Then he had a river deflected and he had what\r\nlooked like a village built up on its banks--so that they\xe2\x80\x99d see it, and\r\nthink it was a town ten miles farther up the valley. There\xe2\x80\x99s only one\r\nthing my father\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9conly one thing in the\r\nworld that could be used to find us out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPercy sank his voice to a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAeroplanes,\xe2\x80\x9d he breathed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got half a dozen anti-aircraft guns\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged it so far--but there\xe2\x80\x99ve been a few deaths and a\r\ngreat many prisoners. Not that we mind _that_, you know, father\r\nand I, but it upsets mother and the girls, and there\xe2\x80\x99s always the\r\nchance that some time we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to arrange it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShreds and tatters of chinchilla, courtesy clouds in the green moon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheaven, were passing the green moon like precious Eastern stuffs\r\nparaded for the inspection of some Tartar Khan. It seemed to John that\r\nit was day, and that he was looking at some lads sailing above him in\r\nthe air, showering down tracts and patent medicine circulars, with\r\ntheir messages of hope for despairing, rock-bound hamlets. It seemed\r\nto him that he could see them look down out of the clouds and\r\nstare--and stare at whatever there was to stare at in this place\r\nwhither he was bound-- What then? Were they induced to land by some\r\ninsidious device to be immured far from patent medicines and from\r\ntracts until the judgment day--or, should they fail to fall into the\r\ntrap, did a quick puff of smoke and the sharp round of a splitting\r\nshell bring them drooping to earth--and \xe2\x80\x9cupset\xe2\x80\x9d Percy\xe2\x80\x99s mother and\r\nsisters. John shook his head and the wraith of a hollow laugh issued\r\nsilently from his parted lips. What desperate transaction lay hidden\r\nhere? What a moral expedient of a bizarre Croesus? What terrible and\r\ngolden mystery?...\r\n\r\nThe chinchilla clouds had drifted past now and outside the Montana\r\nnight was bright as day. The tapestry brick of the road was smooth to\r\nthe tread of the great tyres as they rounded a still, moonlit lake;\r\nthey passed into darkness for a moment, a pine grove, pungent and\r\ncool, then they came out into a broad avenue of lawn, and John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexclamation of pleasure was simultaneous with Percy\xe2\x80\x99s taciturn \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFull in the light of the stars, an exquisite ch\xc3\xa2teau rose from the\r\nborders of the lake, climbed in marble radiance half the height of an\r\nadjoining mountain, then melted in grace, in perfect symmetry, in\r\ntranslucent feminine languor, into the massed darkness of a forest of\r\npine. The many towers, the slender tracery of the sloping parapets,\r\nthe chiselled wonder of a thousand yellow windows with their oblongs\r\nand hectagons and triangles of golden light, the shattered softness of\r\nthe intersecting planes of star-shine and blue shade, all trembled on\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s spirit like a chord of music. On one of the towers, the\r\ntallest, the blackest at its base, an arrangement of exterior lights\r\nat the top made a sort of floating fairyland--and as John gazed up in\r\nwarm enchantment the faint acciaccare sound of violins drifted down in\r\na rococo harmony that was like nothing he had ever heard before. Then\r\nin a moment the car stopped before wide, high marble steps around\r\nwhich the night air was fragrant with a host of flowers. At the top of\r\nthe steps two great doors swung silently open and amber light flooded\r\nout upon the darkness, silhouetting the figure of an exquisite lady\r\nwith black, high-piled hair, who held out her arms toward them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d Percy was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is my friend, John Unger, from\r\nHades.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfterward John remembered that first night as a daze of many colours,\r\nof quick sensory impressions, of music soft as a voice in love, and of\r\nthe beauty of things, lights and shadows, and motions and faces. There\r\nwas a white-haired man who stood drinking a many-hued cordial from a\r\ncrystal thimble set on a golden stem. There was a girl with a flowery\r\nface, dressed like Titania with braided sapphires in her hair. There\r\nwas a room where the solid, soft gold of the walls yielded to the\r\npressure of his hand, and a room that was like a platonic conception\r\nof the ultimate prison--ceiling, floor, and all, it was lined with an\r\nunbroken mass of diamonds, diamonds of every size and shape, until,\r\nlit with tall violet lamps in the corners, it dazzled the eyes with a\r\nwhiteness that could be compared only with itself, beyond human wish,\r\nor dream.\r\n\r\nThrough a maze of these rooms the two boys wandered. Sometimes the\r\nfloor under their feet would flame in brilliant patterns from lighting\r\nbelow, patterns of barbaric clashing colours, of pastel delicacy, of\r\nsheer whiteness, or of subtle and intricate mosaic, surely from some\r\nmosque on the Adriatic Sea. Sometimes beneath layers of thick crystal\r\nhe would see blue or green water swirling, inhabited by vivid fish and\r\ngrowths of rainbow foliage. Then they would be treading on furs of\r\nevery texture and colour or along corridors of palest ivory, unbroken\r\nas though carved complete from the gigantic tusks of dinosaurs extinct\r\nbefore the age of man ....\r\n\r\nThen a hazily remembered transition, and they were at dinner--where\r\neach plate was of two almost imperceptible layers of solid diamond\r\nbetween which was curiously worked a filigree of emerald design, a\r\nshaving sliced from green air. Music, plangent and unobtrusive,\r\ndrifted down through far corridors--his chair, feathered and curved\r\ninsidiously to his back, seemed to engulf and overpower him as he\r\ndrank his first glass of port. He tried drowsily to answer a question\r\nthat had been asked him, but the honeyed luxury that clasped his body\r\nadded to the illusion of sleep--jewels, fabrics, wines, and metals\r\nblurred before his eyes into a sweet mist ....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied with a polite effort, \xe2\x80\x9cit certainly is hot enough\r\nfor me down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe managed to add a ghostly laugh; then, without movement, without\r\nresistance, he seemed to float off and away, leaving an iced dessert\r\nthat was pink as a dream .... He fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke he knew that several hours had passed. He was in a great\r\nquiet room with ebony walls and a dull illumination that was too\r\nfaint, too subtle, to be called a light. His young host was standing\r\nover him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fell asleep at dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d Percy was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cI nearly did, too--it\r\nwas such a treat to be comfortable again after this year of school.\r\nServants undressed and bathed you while you were sleeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this a bed or a cloud?\xe2\x80\x9d sighed John. \xe2\x80\x9cPercy, Percy--before you go,\r\nI want to apologise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor doubting you when you said you had a diamond as big as the\r\nRitz-Carlton Hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPercy smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe me. It\xe2\x80\x99s that mountain, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mountain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mountain the ch\xc3\xa2teau rests on. It\xe2\x80\x99s not very big, for a mountain.\r\nBut except about fifty feet of sod and gravel on top it\xe2\x80\x99s solid\r\ndiamond. _One_ diamond, one cubic mile without a flaw. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nlistening? Say----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut John T. Unger had again fallen asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMorning. As he awoke he perceived drowsily that the room had at the\r\nsame moment become dense with sunlight. The ebony panels of one wall\r\nhad slid aside on a sort of track, leaving his chamber half open to\r\nthe day. A large negro in a white uniform stood beside his bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered John, summoning his brains from the wild\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, sir. Are you ready for your bath, sir? Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nup--I\xe2\x80\x99ll put you in, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll just unbutton your pyjamas--there.\r\nThank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn lay quietly as his pyjamas were removed--he was amused and\r\ndelighted; he expected to be lifted like a child by this black\r\nGargantua who was tending him, but nothing of the sort happened;\r\ninstead he felt the bed tilt up slowly on its side--he began to roll,\r\nstartled at first, in the direction of the wall, but when he reached\r\nthe wall its drapery gave way, and sliding two yards farther down a\r\nfleecy incline he plumped gently into water the same temperature as\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\nHe looked about him. The runway or rollway on which he had arrived had\r\nfolded gently back into place. He had been projected into another\r\nchamber and was sitting in a sunken bath with his head just above the\r\nlevel of the floor. All about him, lining the walls of the room and\r\nthe sides and bottom of the bath itself, was a blue aquarium, and\r\ngazing through the crystal surface on which he sat, he could see fish\r\nswimming among amber lights and even gliding without curiosity past\r\nhis outstretched toes, which were separated from them only by the\r\nthickness of the crystal. From overhead, sunlight came down through\r\nsea-green glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, sir, that you\xe2\x80\x99d like hot rosewater and soapsuds this\r\nmorning, sir--and perhaps cold salt water to finish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe negro was standing beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed John, smiling inanely, \xe2\x80\x9cas you please.\xe2\x80\x9d Any idea of\r\nordering this bath according to his own meagre standards of living\r\nwould have been priggish and not a little wicked.\r\n\r\nThe negro pressed a button and a warm rain began to fall, apparently\r\nfrom overhead, but really, so John discovered after a moment, from a\r\nfountain arrangement near by. The water turned to a pale rose colour\r\nand jets of liquid soap spurted into it from four miniature walrus\r\nheads at the corners of the bath. In a moment a dozen little\r\npaddle-wheels, fixed to the sides, had churned the mixture into a\r\nradiant rainbow of pink foam which enveloped him softly with its\r\ndelicious lightness, and burst in shining, rosy bubbles here and there\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I turn on the moving-picture machine, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the negro\r\ndeferentially. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a good one-reel comedy in this machine to-day,\r\nor I can put in a serious piece in a moment, if you prefer it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d answered John, politely but firmly. He was enjoying his\r\nbath too much to desire any distraction. But distraction came. In a\r\nmoment he was listening intently to the sound of flutes from just\r\noutside, flutes dripping a melody that was like a waterfall, cool and\r\ngreen as the room itself, accompanying a frothy piccolo, in play more\r\nfragile than the lace of suds that covered and charmed him.\r\n\r\nAfter a cold salt-water bracer and a cold fresh finish, he stepped out\r\nand into a fleecy robe, and upon a couch covered with the same\r\nmaterial he was rubbed with oil, alcohol, and spice. Later he sat in a\r\nvoluptuous chair while he was shaved and his hair was trimmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Percy is waiting in your sitting-room,\xe2\x80\x9d said the negro, when\r\nthese operations were finished. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Gygsum, Mr. Unger, sir. I\r\nam to see to Mr. Unger every morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn walked out into the brisk sunshine of his living-room, where he\r\nfound breakfast waiting for him and Percy, gorgeous in white kid\r\nknickerbockers, smoking in an easy chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThis is a story of the Washington family as Percy sketched it for John\r\nduring breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe father of the present Mr. Washington had been a Virginian, a\r\ndirect descendant of George Washington, and Lord Baltimore. At the\r\nclose of the Civil War he was a twenty-five-year-old Colonel with a\r\nplayed-out plantation and about a thousand dollars in gold.\r\n\r\nFitz-Norman Culpepper Washington, for that was the young Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, decided to present the Virginia estate to his younger brother\r\nand go West. He selected two dozen of the most faithful blacks, who,\r\nof course, worshipped him, and bought twenty-five tickets to the West,\r\nwhere he intended to take out land in their names and start a sheep\r\nand cattle ranch.\r\n\r\nWhen he had been in Montana for less than a month and things were\r\ngoing very poorly indeed, he stumbled on his great discovery. He had\r\nlost his way when riding in the hills, and after a day without food he\r\nbegan to grow hungry. As he was without his rifle, he was forced to\r\npursue a squirrel, and, in the course of the pursuit, he noticed that\r\nit was carrying something shiny in its mouth. Just before it vanished\r\ninto its hole--for Providence did not intend that this squirrel should\r\nalleviate his hunger--it dropped its burden. Sitting down to consider\r\nthe situation Fitz-Norman\xe2\x80\x99s eye was caught by a gleam in the grass\r\nbeside him. In ten seconds he had completely lost his appetite and\r\ngained one hundred thousand dollars. The squirrel, which had refused\r\nwith annoying persistence to become food, had made him a present of a\r\nlarge and perfect diamond.\r\n\r\nLate that night he found his way to camp and twelve hours later all\r\nthe males among his darkies were back by the squirrel hole digging\r\nfuriously at the side of the mountain. He told them he had discovered\r\na rhinestone mine, and, as only one or two of them had ever seen even\r\na small diamond before, they believed him, without question. When the\r\nmagnitude of his discovery became apparent to him, he found himself in\r\na quandary. The mountain was _a_ diamond--it was literally\r\nnothing else but solid diamond. He filled four saddle bags full of\r\nglittering samples and started on horseback for St. Paul. There he\r\nmanaged to dispose of half a dozen small stones--when he tried a\r\nlarger one a storekeeper fainted and Fitz-Norman was arrested as a\r\npublic disturber. He escaped from jail and caught the train for New\r\nYork, where he sold a few medium-sized diamonds and received in\r\nexchange about two hundred thousand dollars in gold. But he did not\r\ndare to produce any exceptional gems--in fact, he left New York just\r\nin time. Tremendous excitement had been created in jewellery circles,\r\nnot so much by the size of his diamonds as by their appearance in the\r\ncity from mysterious sources. Wild rumours became current that a\r\ndiamond mine had been discovered in the Catskills, on the Jersey\r\ncoast, on Long Island, beneath Washington Square. Excursion trains,\r\npacked with men carrying picks and shovels, began to leave New York\r\nhourly, bound for various neighbouring El Dorados. But by that time\r\nyoung Fitz-Norman was on his way back to Montana.\r\n\r\nBy the end of a fortnight he had estimated that the diamond in the\r\nmountain was approximately equal in quantity to all the rest of the\r\ndiamonds known to exist in the world. There was no valuing it by any\r\nregular computation, however, for it was _one solid diamond_--and\r\nif it were offered for sale not only would the bottom fall out of the\r\nmarket, but also, if the value should vary with its size in the usual\r\narithmetical progression, there would not be enough gold in the world\r\nto buy a tenth part of it. And what could any one do with a diamond\r\nthat size?\r\n\r\nIt was an amazing predicament. He was, in one sense, the richest man\r\nthat ever lived--and yet was he worth anything at all? If his secret\r\nshould transpire there was no telling to what measures the Government\r\nmight resort in order to prevent a panic, in gold as well as in\r\njewels. They might take over the claim immediately and institute a\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nThere was no alternative--he must market his mountain in secret. He\r\nsent South for his younger brother and put him in charge of his\r\ncoloured following, darkies who had never realised that slavery was\r\nabolished. To make sure of this, he read them a proclamation that he\r\nhad composed, which announced that General Forrest had reorganised the\r\nshattered Southern armies and defeated the North in one pitched\r\nbattle. The negroes believed him implicitly. They passed a vote\r\ndeclaring it a good thing and held revival services immediately.\r\n\r\nFitz-Norman himself set out for foreign parts with one hundred\r\nthousand dollars and two trunks filled with rough diamonds of all\r\nsizes. He sailed for Russia in a Chinese junk, and six months after\r\nhis departure from Montana he was in St. Petersburg. He took obscure\r\nlodgings and called immediately upon the court jeweller, announcing\r\nthat he had a diamond for the Czar. He remained in St. Petersburg for\r\ntwo weeks, in constant danger of being murdered, living from lodging\r\nto lodging, and afraid to visit his trunks more than three or four\r\ntimes during the whole fortnight.\r\n\r\nOn his promise to return in a year with larger and finer stones, he\r\nwas allowed to leave for India. Before he left, however, the Court\r\nTreasurers had deposited to his credit, in American banks, the sum of\r\nfifteen million dollars--under four different aliases.\r\n\r\nHe returned to America in 1868, having been gone a little over two\r\nyears. He had visited the capitals of twenty-two countries and talked\r\nwith five emperors, eleven kings, three princes, a shah, a khan, and a\r\nsultan. At that time Fitz-Norman estimated his own wealth at one\r\nbillion dollars. One fact worked consistently against the disclosure\r\nof his secret. No one of his larger diamonds remained in the public\r\neye for a week before being invested with a history of enough\r\nfatalities, amours, revolutions, and wars to have occupied it from the\r\ndays of the first Babylonian Empire.\r\n\r\nFrom 1870 until his death in 1900, the history of Fitz-Norman\r\nWashington was a long epic in gold. There were side issues, of\r\ncourse--he evaded the surveys, he married a Virginia lady, by whom he\r\nhad a single son, and he was compelled, due to a series of unfortunate\r\ncomplications, to murder his brother, whose unfortunate habit of\r\ndrinking himself into an indiscreet stupor had several times\r\nendangered their safety. But very few other murders stained these happy\r\nyears of progress and expansion.\r\n\r\nJust before he died he changed his policy, and with all but a few\r\nmillion dollars of his outside wealth bought up rare minerals in bulk,\r\nwhich he deposited in the safety vaults of banks all over the world,\r\nmarked as bric-\xc3\xa0-brac. His son, Braddock Tarleton Washington, followed\r\nthis policy on an even more tensive scale. The minerals were converted\r\ninto the rarest of all elements--radium--so that the equivalent of a\r\nbillion dollars in gold could be placed in a receptacle no bigger than\r\na cigar box.\r\n\r\nWhen Fitz-Norman had been dead three years his son, Braddock, decided\r\nthat the business had gone far enough. The amount of wealth that he\r\nand his father had taken out of the mountain was beyond all exact\r\ncomputation. He kept a note-book in cipher in which he set down the\r\napproximate quantity of radium in each of the thousand banks he\r\npatronised, and recorded the alias under which it was held. Then he\r\ndid a very simple thing--he sealed up the mine.\r\n\r\nHe sealed up the mine. What had been taken out of it would support all\r\nthe Washingtons yet to be born in unparalleled luxury for generations.\r\nHis one care must be the protection of his secret, lest in the\r\npossible panic attendant on its discovery he should be reduced with\r\nall the property-holders in the world to utter poverty.\r\n\r\nThis was the family among whom John T. Unger was staying. This was the\r\nstory he heard in his silver-walled living-room the morning after his\r\narrival.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, John found his way out the great marble entrance, and\r\nlooked curiously at the scene before him. The whole valley, from the\r\ndiamond mountain to the steep granite cliff five miles away, still\r\ngave off a breath of golden haze which hovered idly above the fine\r\nsweep of lawns and lakes and gardens. Here and there clusters of elms\r\nmade delicate groves of shade, contrasting strangely with the tough\r\nmasses of pine forest that held the hills in a grip of dark-blue\r\ngreen. Even as John looked he saw three fawns in single file patter\r\nout from one clump about a half-mile away and disappear with awkward\r\ngaiety into the black-ribbed half-light of another. John would not\r\nhave been surprised to see a goat-foot piping his way among the trees\r\nor to catch a glimpse of pink nymph-skin and flying yellow hair\r\nbetween the greenest of the green leaves.\r\n\r\nIn some such cool hope he descended the marble steps, disturbing\r\nfaintly the sleep of two silky Russian wolfhounds at the bottom, and\r\nset off along a walk of white and blue brick that seemed to lead in no\r\nparticular direction.\r\n\r\nHe was enjoying himself as much as he was able. It is youth\xe2\x80\x99s felicity\r\nas well as its insufficiency that it can never live in the present,\r\nbut must always be measuring up the day against its own radiantly\r\nimagined future--flowers and gold, girls and stars, they are only\r\nprefigurations and prophecies of that incomparable, unattainable young\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nJohn rounded a soft corner where the massed rosebushes filled the air\r\nwith heavy scent, and struck off across a park toward a patch of moss\r\nunder some trees. He had never lain upon moss, and he wanted to see\r\nwhether it was really soft enough to justify the use of its name as an\r\nadjective. Then he saw a girl coming toward him over the grass. She\r\nwas the most beautiful person he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in a white little gown that came just below her knees,\r\nand a wreath of mignonettes clasped with blue slices of sapphire bound\r\nup her hair. Her pink bare feet scattered the dew before them as she\r\ncame. She was younger than John--not more than sixteen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried softly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Kismine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was much more than that to John already. He advanced toward her,\r\nscarcely moving as he drew near lest he should tread on her bare toes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t met me,\xe2\x80\x9d said her soft voice. Her blue eyes added, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nbut you\xe2\x80\x99ve missed a great deal!\xe2\x80\x9d... \xe2\x80\x9cYou met my sister, Jasmine, last\r\nnight. I was sick with lettuce poisoning,\xe2\x80\x9d went on her soft voice, and\r\nher eye continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand when I\xe2\x80\x99m sick I\xe2\x80\x99m sweet--and when I\xe2\x80\x99m well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have made an enormous impression on me,\xe2\x80\x9d said John\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not so slow myself\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d said his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re better this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cYou darling,\xe2\x80\x9d added his eyes\r\ntremulously.\r\n\r\nJohn observed that they had been walking along the path. On her\r\nsuggestion they sat down together upon the moss, the softness of which\r\nhe failed to determine.\r\n\r\nHe was critical about women. A single defect--a thick ankle, a hoarse\r\nvoice, a glass eye--was enough to make him utterly indifferent. And\r\nhere for the first time in his life he was beside a girl who seemed to\r\nhim the incarnation of physical perfection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you from the East?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kismine with charming interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered John simply. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m from Hades.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEither she had never heard of Hades, or she could think of no pleasant\r\ncomment to make upon it, for she did not discuss it further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going East to school this fall,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99you think I\xe2\x80\x99ll like\r\nit? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to New York to Miss Bulge\xe2\x80\x99s. It\xe2\x80\x99s very strict, but you\r\nsee over the weekends I\xe2\x80\x99m going to live at home with the family in our\r\nNew York house, because father heard that the girls had to go walking\r\ntwo by two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father wants you to be proud,\xe2\x80\x9d observed John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, her eyes shining with dignity. \xe2\x80\x9cNone of us has\r\never been punished. Father said we never should be. Once when my\r\nsister Jasmine was a little girl she pushed him downstairs and he just\r\ngot up and limped away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother was--well, a little startled,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Kismine, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she\r\nheard that you were from--from where you _are_ from, you know.\r\nShe said that when she was a young girl--but then, you see, she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nSpaniard and old-fashioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you spend much time out here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked John, to conceal the fact\r\nthat he was somewhat hurt by this remark. It seemed an unkind allusion\r\nto his provincialism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPercy and Jasmine and I are here every summer, but next summer\r\nJasmine is going to Newport. She\xe2\x80\x99s coming out in London a year from\r\nthis fall. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be presented at court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d began John hesitantly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re much more sophisticated\r\nthan I thought you were when I first saw you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of\r\nbeing. I think that sophisticated young people are _terribly_\r\ncommon, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? I\xe2\x80\x99m not all, really. If you say I am, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\ncry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was so distressed that her lip was trembling. John was impelled to\r\nprotest:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that; I only said it to tease you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I _were_,\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot. I\xe2\x80\x99m very innocent and girlish. I never smoke, or drink, or read\r\nanything except poetry. I know scarcely any mathematics or chemistry.\r\nI dress _very_ simply--in fact, I scarcely dress at all. I think\r\nsophisticated is the last thing you can say about me. I believe that\r\ngirls ought to enjoy their youths in a wholesome way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, heartily.\r\n\r\nKismine was cheerful again. She smiled at him, and a still-born tear\r\ndripped from the corner of one blue eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like you,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered intimately. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to spend all\r\nyour time with Percy while you\xe2\x80\x99re here, or will you be nice to me?\r\nJust think--I\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely fresh ground. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a boy in love\r\nwith me in all my life. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been allowed even to _see_\r\nboys alone--except Percy. I came all the way out here into this grove\r\nhoping to run into you, where the family wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDeeply flattered, John bowed from the hips as he had been taught at\r\ndancing school in Hades.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d better go now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kismine sweetly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to be with mother\r\nat eleven. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked me to kiss you once. I thought boys\r\nalways did that nowadays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn drew himself up proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of them do,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not me. Girls don\xe2\x80\x99t do that sort\r\nof thing--in Hades.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSide by side they walked back toward the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nJohn stood facing Mr. Braddock Washington in the full sunlight. The\r\nelder man was about forty, with a proud, vacuous face, intelligent\r\neyes, and a robust figure. In the mornings he smelt of horses--the\r\nbest horses. He carried a plain walking-stick of gray birch with a\r\nsingle large opal for a grip. He and Percy were showing John around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe slaves\xe2\x80\x99 quarters are there.\xe2\x80\x9d His walking-stick indicated a\r\ncloister of marble on their left that ran in graceful Gothic along the\r\nside of the mountain. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my youth I was distracted for a while from\r\nthe business of life by a period of absurd idealism. During that time\r\nthey lived in luxury. For instance, I equipped every one of their\r\nrooms with a tile bath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d ventured John, with an ingratiating laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they\r\nused the bathtubs to keep coal in. Mr. Schnlitzer-Murphy told me that\r\nonce he--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe opinions of Mr. Schnlitzer-Murphy are of little importance, I\r\nshould imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Braddock Washington coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy slaves\r\ndid not keep coal in their bathtubs. They had orders to bathe every\r\nday, and they did. If they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I might have ordered a sulphuric\r\nacid shampoo. I discontinued the baths for quite another reason.\r\nSeveral of them caught cold and died. Water is not good for certain\r\nraces--except as a beverage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn laughed, and then decided to nod his head in sober agreement.\r\nBraddock Washington made him uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these negroes are descendants of the ones my father brought North\r\nwith him. There are about two hundred and fifty now. You notice that\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve lived so long apart from the world that their original dialect\r\nhas become an almost indistinguishable patois. We bring a few of them\r\nup to speak English--my secretary and two or three of the house\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the golf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, as they strolled along the\r\nvelvet winter grass. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all a green, you see--no fairway, no rough,\r\nno hazards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled pleasantly at John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany men in the cage, father?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Percy suddenly.\r\n\r\nBraddock Washington stumbled, and let forth an involuntary curse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne less than there should be,\xe2\x80\x9d he ejaculated darkly--and then added\r\nafter a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had difficulties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother was telling me,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Percy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Italian teacher--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ghastly error,\xe2\x80\x9d said Braddock Washington angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of course\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance that we may have got him. Perhaps he fell\r\nsomewhere in the woods or stumbled over a cliff. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways the probability that if he did get away his story wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nbelieved. Nevertheless, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had two dozen men looking for him in\r\ndifferent towns around here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no luck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome. Fourteen of them reported to my agent they\xe2\x80\x99d each killed a man\r\nanswering to that description, but of course it was probably only the\r\nreward they were after--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off. They had come to a large cavity in the earth about the\r\ncircumference of a merry-go-round, and covered by a strong iron\r\ngrating. Braddock Washington beckoned to John, and pointed his cane\r\ndown through the grating. John stepped to the edge and gazed.\r\nImmediately his ears were assailed by a wild clamor from below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on down to Hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, kiddo, how\xe2\x80\x99s the air up there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey! Throw us a rope!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot an old doughnut, Buddy, or a couple of second-hand sandwiches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, fella, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll push down that guy you\xe2\x80\x99re with, we\xe2\x80\x99ll show you\r\na quick disappearance scene.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaste him one for me, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was too dark to see clearly into the pit below, but John could tell\r\nfrom the coarse optimism and rugged vitality of the remarks and voices\r\nthat they proceeded from middle-class Americans of the more spirited\r\ntype. Then Mr. Washington put out his cane and touched a button in the\r\ngrass, and the scene below sprang into light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are some adventurous mariners who had the misfortune to\r\ndiscover El Dorado,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\r\nBelow them there had appeared a large hollow in the earth shaped like\r\nthe interior of a bowl. The sides were steep and apparently of\r\npolished glass, and on its slightly concave surface stood about two\r\ndozen men clad in the half costume, half uniform, of aviators. Their\r\nupturned faces, lit with wrath, with malice, with despair, with\r\ncynical humour, were covered by long growths of beard, but with the\r\nexception of a few who had pined perceptibly away, they seemed to be a\r\nwell-fed, healthy lot.\r\n\r\nBraddock Washington drew a garden chair to the edge of the pit and sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how are you, boys?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired genially.\r\n\r\nA chorus of execration, in which all joined except a few too\r\ndispirited to cry out, rose up into the sunny air, but Braddock\r\nWashington heard it with unruffled composure. When its last echo had\r\ndied away he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you thought up a way out of your difficulty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom here and there among them a remark floated up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe decided to stay here for love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring us up there and we\xe2\x80\x99ll find us a way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBraddock Washington waited until they were again quiet. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told you the situation. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you here, I wish to heaven\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d never seen you. Your own curiosity got you here, and any time that\r\nyou can think of a way out which protects me and my interests I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nglad to consider it. But so long as you confine your efforts to\r\ndigging tunnels--yes, I know about the new one you\xe2\x80\x99ve started--you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t get very far. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t as hard on you as you make it out, with\r\nall your howling for the loved ones at home. If you were the type who\r\nworried much about the loved ones at home, you\xe2\x80\x99d never have taken up\r\naviation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tall man moved apart from the others, and held up his hand to call\r\nhis captor\xe2\x80\x99s attention to what he was about to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me ask you a few questions!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou pretend to be a\r\nfair-minded man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow absurd. How could a man of _my_ position be fair-minded\r\ntoward you? You might as well speak of a Spaniard being fair-minded\r\ntoward a piece of steak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this harsh observation the faces of the two dozen fell, but the\r\ntall man continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve argued this out before. You\xe2\x80\x99re not a\r\nhumanitarian and you\xe2\x80\x99re not fair-minded, but you\xe2\x80\x99re human--at least\r\nyou say you are--and you ought to be able to put yourself in our place\r\nfor long enough to think how--how--how--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow what?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Washington, coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--how unnecessary--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--how cruel--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve covered that. Cruelty doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist where self-preservation is\r\ninvolved. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been soldiers; you know that. Try another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, how stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Washington, \xe2\x80\x9cI grant you that. But try to think of\r\nan alternative. I\xe2\x80\x99ve offered to have all or any of you painlessly\r\nexecuted if you wish. I\xe2\x80\x99ve offered to have your wives, sweethearts,\r\nchildren, and mothers kidnapped and brought out here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll enlarge\r\nyour place down there and feed and clothe you the rest of your lives.\r\nIf there was some method of producing permanent amnesia I\xe2\x80\x99d have all\r\nof you operated on and released immediately, somewhere outside of my\r\npreserves. But that\xe2\x80\x99s as far as my ideas go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about trusting us not to peach on you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried some one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t proffer that suggestion seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington, with\r\nan expression of scorn. \xe2\x80\x9cI did take out one man to teach my daughter\r\nItalian. Last week he got away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA wild yell of jubilation went up suddenly from two dozen throats and\r\na pandemonium of joy ensued. The prisoners clog-danced and cheered and\r\nyodled and wrestled with one another in a sudden uprush of animal\r\nspirits. They even ran up the glass sides of the bowl as far as they\r\ncould, and slid back to the bottom upon the natural cushions of their\r\nbodies. The tall man started a song in which they all joined--\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9c_Oh, we\xe2\x80\x99ll hang the kaiser\r\n    On a sour apple-tree_--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBraddock Washington sat in inscrutable silence until the song was\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, when he could gain a modicum of attention. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbear you no ill-will. I like to see you enjoying yourselves. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhy I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you the whole story at once. The man--what was his\r\nname? Critchtichiello?--was shot by some of my agents in fourteen\r\ndifferent places.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot guessing that the places referred to were cities, the tumult of\r\nrejoicing subsided immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Washington with a touch of anger, \xe2\x80\x9che tried to\r\nrun away. Do you expect me to take chances with any of you after an\r\nexperience like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain a series of ejaculations went up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould your daughter like to learn Chinese?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, I can speak Italian! My mother was a wop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe she\xe2\x80\x99d like t\xe2\x80\x99learna speak N\xe2\x80\x99Yawk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she\xe2\x80\x99s the little one with the big blue eyes I can teach her a lot\r\nof things better than Italian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know some Irish songs--and I could hammer brass once\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Washington reached forward suddenly with his cane and pushed the\r\nbutton in the grass so that the picture below went out instantly, and\r\nthere remained only that great dark mouth covered dismally with the\r\nblack teeth of the grating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey!\xe2\x80\x9d called a single voice from below, \xe2\x80\x9cyou ain\xe2\x80\x99t goin\xe2\x80\x99 away without\r\ngivin\xe2\x80\x99 us your blessing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Washington, followed by the two boys, was already strolling on\r\ntoward the ninth hole of the golf course, as though the pit and its\r\ncontents were no more than a hazard over which his facile iron had\r\ntriumphed with ease.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nJuly under the lee of the diamond mountain was a month of blanket\r\nnights and of warm, glowing days. John and Kismine were in love. He\r\ndid not know that the little gold football (inscribed with the legend\r\n_Pro deo et patria et St. Mida_) which he had given her rested on\r\na platinum chain next to her bosom. But it did. And she for her part\r\nwas not aware that a large sapphire which had dropped one day from her\r\nsimple coiffure was stowed away tenderly in John\xe2\x80\x99s jewel box.\r\n\r\nLate one afternoon when the ruby and ermine music room was quiet, they\r\nspent an hour there together. He held her hand and she gave him such a\r\nlook that he whispered her name aloud. She bent toward him--then\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you say \xe2\x80\x98Kismine\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked softly, \xe2\x80\x9cor--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had wanted to be sure. She thought she might have misunderstood.\r\n\r\nNeither of them had ever kissed before, but in the course of an hour\r\nit seemed to make little difference.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon drifted away. That night, when a last breath of music\r\ndrifted down from the highest tower, they each lay awake, happily\r\ndreaming over the separate minutes of the day. They had decided to be\r\nmarried as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nEvery day Mr. Washington and the two young men went hunting or fishing\r\nin the deep forests or played golf around the somnolent course--games\r\nwhich John diplomatically allowed his host to win--or swam in the\r\nmountain coolness of the lake. John found Mr. Washington a somewhat\r\nexacting personality--utterly uninterested in any ideas or opinions\r\nexcept his own. Mrs. Washington was aloof and reserved at all times.\r\nShe was apparently indifferent to her two daughters, and entirely\r\nabsorbed in her son Percy, with whom she held interminable\r\nconversations in rapid Spanish at dinner.\r\n\r\nJasmine, the elder daughter, resembled Kismine in appearance--except\r\nthat she was somewhat bow-legged, and terminated in large hands and\r\nfeet--but was utterly unlike her in temperament. Her favourite books\r\nhad to do with poor girls who kept house for widowed fathers. John\r\nlearned from Kismine that Jasmine had never recovered from the shock\r\nand disappointment caused her by the termination of the World War,\r\njust as she was about to start for Europe as a canteen expert. She had\r\neven pined away for a time, and Braddock Washington had taken steps to\r\npromote a new war in the Balkans--but she had seen a photograph of\r\nsome wounded Serbian soldiers and lost interest in the whole\r\nproceedings. But Percy and Kismine seemed to have inherited the\r\narrogant attitude in all its harsh magnificence from their father. A\r\nchaste and consistent selfishness ran like a pattern through their\r\nevery idea.\r\n\r\nJohn was enchanted by the wonders of the ch\xc3\xa2teau and the valley.\r\nBraddock Washington, so Percy told him, had caused to be kidnapped a\r\nlandscape gardener, an architect, a designer of state settings, and a\r\nFrench decadent poet left over from the last century. He had put his\r\nentire force of negroes at their disposal, guaranteed to supply them\r\nwith any materials that the world could offer, and left them to work\r\nout some ideas of their own. But one by one they had shown their\r\nuselessness. The decadent poet had at once begun bewailing his\r\nseparation from the boulevards in spring--he made some vague remarks\r\nabout spices, apes, and ivories, but said nothing that was of any\r\npractical value. The stage designer on his part wanted to make the\r\nwhole valley a series of tricks and sensational effects--a state of\r\nthings that the Washingtons would soon have grown tired of. And as for\r\nthe architect and the landscape gardener, they thought only in terms\r\nof convention. They must make this like this and that like that.\r\n\r\nBut they had, at least, solved the problem of what was to be done with\r\nthem--they all went mad early one morning after spending the night in\r\na single room trying to agree upon the location of a fountain, and\r\nwere now confined comfortably in an insane asylum at Westport,\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d inquired John curiously, \xe2\x80\x9cwho did plan all your wonderful\r\nreception rooms and halls, and approaches and bathrooms--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Percy, \xe2\x80\x9cI blush to tell you, but it was a\r\nmoving-picture fella. He was the only man we found who was used to\r\nplaying with an unlimited amount of money, though he did tuck his\r\nnapkin in his collar and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read or write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs August drew to a close John began to regret that he must soon go\r\nback to school. He and Kismine had decided to elope the following\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be nicer to be married here,\xe2\x80\x9d Kismine confessed, \xe2\x80\x9cbut of\r\ncourse I could never get father\xe2\x80\x99s permission to marry you at all. Next\r\nto that I\xe2\x80\x99d rather elope. It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible for wealthy people to be\r\nmarried in America at present--they always have to send out bulletins\r\nto the press saying that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be married in remnants, when\r\nwhat they mean is just a peck of old second-hand pearls and some used\r\nlace worn once by the Empress Eugenie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed John fervently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was visiting the\r\nSchnlitzer-Murphys, the eldest daughter, Gwendolyn, married a man\r\nwhose father owns half of West Virginia. She wrote home saying what a\r\ntough struggle she was carrying on on his salary as a bank clerk--and\r\nthen she ended up by saying that \xe2\x80\x98Thank God, I have four good maids\r\nanyhow, and that helps a little.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s absurd,\xe2\x80\x9d commented Kismine--\xe2\x80\x9cThink of the millions and millions\r\nof people in the world, labourers and all, who get along with only two\r\nmaids.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne afternoon late in August a chance remark of Kismine\xe2\x80\x99s changed the\r\nface of the entire situation, and threw John into a state of terror.\r\n\r\nThey were in their favourite grove, and between kisses John was\r\nindulging in some romantic forebodings which he fancied added\r\npoignancy to their relations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll never marry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too\r\nwealthy, too magnificent. No one as rich as you are can be like other\r\ngirls. I should marry the daughter of some well-to-do wholesale\r\nhardware man from Omaha or Sioux City, and be content with her\r\nhalf-million.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew the daughter of a wholesale hardware man once,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\r\nKismine. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d have been contented with her. She was a\r\nfriend of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s. She visited here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, then you\xe2\x80\x99ve had other guests?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed John in surprise.\r\n\r\nKismine seemed to regret her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve had a few.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut aren\xe2\x80\x99t you--wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your father afraid they\xe2\x80\x99d talk outside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, to some extent, to some extent,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s talk about\r\nsomething pleasanter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut John\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity was aroused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething pleasanter!\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s unpleasant about that?\r\nWeren\xe2\x80\x99t they nice girls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo his great surprise Kismine began to weep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--th--that\xe2\x80\x99s the--the whole t-trouble. I grew qu-quite attached to\r\nsome of them. So did Jasmine, but she kept inv-viting them anyway. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t under_stand_ it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA dark suspicion was born in John\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that they _told_, and your father had\r\nthem--removed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse than that,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered brokenly. \xe2\x80\x9cFather took no chances--and\r\nJasmine kept writing them to come, and they had _such_ a good\r\ntime!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was overcome by a paroxysm of grief.\r\n\r\nStunned with the horror of this revelation, John sat there\r\nopen-mouthed, feeling the nerves of his body twitter like so many\r\nsparrows perched upon his spinal column.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, calming suddenly\r\nand drying her dark blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that your father had them _murdered_ before\r\nthey left?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn August usually--or early in September. It\xe2\x80\x99s only natural for us to\r\nget all the pleasure out of them that we can first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow abominable! How--why, I must be going crazy! Did you really admit\r\nthat--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Kismine, shrugging her shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t very\r\nwell imprison them like those aviators, where they\xe2\x80\x99d be a continual\r\nreproach to us every day. And it\xe2\x80\x99s always been made easier for Jasmine\r\nand me, because father had it done sooner than we expected. In that\r\nway we avoided any farewell scene--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you murdered them! Uh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was done very nicely. They were drugged while they were\r\nasleep--and their families were always told that they died of scarlet\r\nfever in Butte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--I fail to understand why you kept on inviting them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Kismine. \xe2\x80\x9cI never invited one. Jasmine did. And\r\nthey always had a very good time. She\xe2\x80\x99d give them the nicest presents\r\ntoward the last. I shall probably have visitors too--I\xe2\x80\x99ll harden up to\r\nit. We can\xe2\x80\x99t let such an inevitable thing as death stand in the way of\r\nenjoying life while we have it. Think of how lonesome it\xe2\x80\x99d be out here\r\nif we never had _any_ one. Why, father and mother have sacrificed\r\nsome of their best friends just as we have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so,\xe2\x80\x9d cried John accusingly, \xe2\x80\x9cand so you were letting me make love\r\nto you and pretending to return it, and talking about marriage, all\r\nthe time knowing perfectly well that I\xe2\x80\x99d never get out of here\r\nalive--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cNot any more. I did at first. You\r\nwere here. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help that, and I thought your last days might as\r\nwell be pleasant for both of us. But then I fell in love with you,\r\nand--and I\xe2\x80\x99m honestly sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re going to--going to be put\r\naway--though I\xe2\x80\x99d rather you\xe2\x80\x99d be put away than ever kiss another\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you would, would you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried John ferociously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch rather. Besides, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always heard that a girl can have more fun\r\nwith a man whom she knows she can never marry. Oh, why did I tell you?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve probably spoiled your whole good time now, and we were really\r\nenjoying things when you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it. I knew it would make things\r\nsort of depressing for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you did, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d John\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled with anger. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\r\nabout enough of this. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t any more pride and decency than\r\nto have an affair with a fellow that you know isn\xe2\x80\x99t much better than a\r\ncorpse, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have any more to with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not a corpse!\xe2\x80\x9d she protested in horror. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not a corpse!\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t have you saying that I kissed a corpse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said nothing of the sort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did! You said I kissed a corpse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir voices had risen, but upon a sudden interruption they both\r\nsubsided into immediate silence. Footsteps were coming along the path\r\nin their direction, and a moment later the rose bushes were parted\r\ndisplaying Braddock Washington, whose intelligent eyes set in his\r\ngood-looking vacuous face were peering in at them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho kissed a corpse?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded in obvious disapproval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Kismine quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were just joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you two doing here, anyhow?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded gruffly. \xe2\x80\x9cKismine,\r\nyou ought to be--to be reading or playing golf with your sister. Go\r\nread! Go play golf! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me find you here when I come back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he bowed at John and went up the path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kismine crossly, when he was out of hearing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nspoiled it all. We can never meet any more. He won\xe2\x80\x99t let me meet you.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d have you poisoned if he thought we were in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not, any more!\xe2\x80\x9d cried John fiercely, \xe2\x80\x9cso he can set his mind at\r\nrest upon that. Moreover, don\xe2\x80\x99t fool yourself that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stay\r\naround here. Inside of six hours I\xe2\x80\x99ll be over those mountains, if I\r\nhave to gnaw a passage through them, and on my way East.\xe2\x80\x9d They had\r\nboth got to their feet, and at this remark Kismine came close and put\r\nher arm through his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be crazy--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\xe2\x80\x99m going,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou most certainly are not. You--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll catch up with father and talk it\r\nover with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDefeated, John mustered a sickly smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed, with pale and unconvincing affection,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll go together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis love for her returned and settled placidly on his heart. She was\r\nhis--she would go with him to share his dangers. He put his arms about\r\nher and kissed her fervently. After all she loved him; she had saved\r\nhim, in fact.\r\n\r\nDiscussing the matter, they walked slowly back toward the ch\xc3\xa2teau.\r\nThey decided that since Braddock Washington had seen them together\r\nthey had best depart the next night. Nevertheless, John\xe2\x80\x99s lips were\r\nunusually dry at dinner, and he nervously emptied a great spoonful of\r\npeacock soup into his left lung. He had to be carried into the\r\nturquoise and sable card-room and pounded on the back by one of the\r\nunder-butlers, which Percy considered a great joke.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nLong after midnight John\xe2\x80\x99s body gave a nervous jerk, and he sat suddenly\r\nupright, staring into the veils of somnolence that draped the room.\r\nThrough the squares of blue darkness that were his open windows, he\r\nhad heard a faint far-away sound that died upon a bed of wind before\r\nidentifying itself on his memory, clouded with uneasy dreams. But the\r\nsharp noise that had succeeded it was nearer, was just outside the\r\nroom--the click of a turned knob, a footstep, a whisper, he could not\r\ntell; a hard lump gathered in the pit of his stomach, and his whole\r\nbody ached in the moment that he strained agonisingly to hear. Then\r\none of the veils seemed to dissolve, and he saw a vague figure\r\nstanding by the door, a figure only faintly limned and blocked in upon\r\nthe darkness, mingled so with the folds of the drapery as to seem\r\ndistorted, like a reflection seen in a dirty pane of glass.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden movement of fright or resolution John pressed the button\r\nby his bedside, and the next moment he was sitting in the green sunken\r\nbath of the adjoining room, waked into alertness by the shock of the\r\ncold water which half filled it.\r\n\r\nHe sprang out, and, his wet pyjamas scattering a heavy trickle of\r\nwater behind him, ran for the aquamarine door which he knew led out on\r\nto the ivory landing of the second floor. The door opened noiselessly.\r\nA single crimson lamp burning in a great dome above lit the\r\nmagnificent sweep of the carved stairways with a poignant beauty. For\r\na moment John hesitated, appalled by the silent splendour massed about\r\nhim, seeming to envelop in its gigantic folds and contours the\r\nsolitary drenched little figure shivering upon the ivory landing. Then\r\nsimultaneously two things happened. The door of his own sitting-room\r\nswung open, precipitating three naked negroes into the hall--and, as\r\nJohn swayed in wild terror toward the stairway, another door slid back\r\nin the wall on the other side of the corridor, and John saw Braddock\r\nWashington standing in the lighted lift, wearing a fur coat and a pair\r\nof riding boots which reached to his knees and displayed, above, the\r\nglow of his rose-colored pyjamas.\r\n\r\nOn the instant the three negroes--John had never seen any of them\r\nbefore, and it flashed through his mind that they must be the\r\nprofessional executioners--paused in their movement toward John, and\r\nturned expectantly to the man in the lift, who burst out with an\r\nimperious command:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet in here! All three of you! Quick as hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, within the instant, the three negroes darted into the cage, the\r\noblong of light was blotted out as the lift door slid shut, and John\r\nwas again alone in the hall. He slumped weakly down against an ivory\r\nstair.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent that something portentous had occurred, something\r\nwhich, for the moment at least, had postponed his own petty disaster.\r\nWhat was it? Had the negroes risen in revolt? Had the aviators forced\r\naside the iron bars of the grating? Or had the men of Fish stumbled\r\nblindly through the hills and gazed with bleak, joyless eyes upon the\r\ngaudy valley? John did not know. He heard a faint whir of air as the\r\nlift whizzed up again, and then, a moment later, as it descended. It\r\nwas probable that Percy was hurrying to his father\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, and\r\nit occurred to John that this was his opportunity to join Kismine and\r\nplan an immediate escape. He waited until the lift had been silent for\r\nseveral minutes; shivering a little with the night cool that whipped\r\nin through his wet pyjamas, he returned to his room and dressed\r\nhimself quickly. Then he mounted a long flight of stairs and turned\r\ndown the corridor carpeted with Russian sable which led to Kismine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuite.\r\n\r\nThe door of her sitting-room was open and the lamps were lighted.\r\nKismine, in an angora kimono, stood near the window of the room in a\r\nlistening attitude, and as John entered noiselessly she turned toward\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, crossing the room to him. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard your father\xe2\x80\x99s slaves in my--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cAeroplanes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAeroplanes? Perhaps that was the sound that woke me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99re at least a dozen. I saw one a few moments ago dead against\r\nthe moon. The guard back by the cliff fired his rifle and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nroused father. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to open on them right away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they here on purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--it\xe2\x80\x99s that Italian who got away--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with her last word, a succession of sharp cracks\r\ntumbled in through the open window. Kismine uttered a little cry, took\r\na penny with fumbling fingers from a box on her dresser, and ran to\r\none of the electric lights. In an instant the entire ch\xc3\xa2teau was in\r\ndarkness--she had blown out the fuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go up to the roof garden, and\r\nwatch it from there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDrawing a cape about her, she took his hand, and they found their way\r\nout the door. It was only a step to the tower lift, and as she pressed\r\nthe button that shot them upward he put his arms around her in the\r\ndarkness and kissed her mouth. Romance had come to John Unger at last.\r\nA minute later they had stepped out upon the star-white platform.\r\nAbove, under the misty moon, sliding in and out of the patches of\r\ncloud that eddied below it, floated a dozen dark-winged bodies in a\r\nconstant circling course. From here and there in the valley flashes of\r\nfire leaped toward them, followed by sharp detonations. Kismine\r\nclapped her hands with pleasure, which, a moment later, turned to\r\ndismay as the aeroplanes, at some prearranged signal, began to release\r\ntheir bombs and the whole of the valley became a panorama of deep\r\nreverberate sound and lurid light.\r\n\r\nBefore long the aim of the attackers became concentrated upon the\r\npoints where the anti-aircraft guns were situated, and one of them was\r\nalmost immediately reduced to a giant cinder to lie smouldering in a\r\npark of rose bushes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKismine,\xe2\x80\x9d begged John, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad when I tell you that this\r\nattack came on the eve of my murder. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard that guard\r\nshoot off his gun back by the pass I should now be stone dead--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kismine, intent on the scene before her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to talk louder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI simply said,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted John, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we\xe2\x80\x99d better get out before they\r\nbegin to shell the ch\xc3\xa2teau!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly the whole portico of the negro quarters cracked asunder, a\r\ngeyser of flame shot up from under the colonnades, and great fragments\r\nof jagged marble were hurled as far as the borders of the lake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere go fifty thousand dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of slaves,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kismine, \xe2\x80\x9cat\r\npre-war prices. So few Americans have any respect for property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn renewed his efforts to compel her to leave. The aim of the\r\naeroplanes was becoming more precise minute by minute, and only two of\r\nthe anti-aircraft guns were still retaliating. It was obvious that the\r\ngarrison, encircled with fire, could not hold out much longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d cried John, pulling Kismine\xe2\x80\x99s arm, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go. Do you\r\nrealise that those aviators will kill you without question if they\r\nfind you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe consented reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wake Jasmine!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as they hurried toward the\r\nlift. Then she added in a sort of childish delight: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be poor,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t we? Like people in books. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll be an orphan and utterly\r\nfree. Free and poor! What fun!\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped and raised her lips to him\r\nin a delighted kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to be both together,\xe2\x80\x9d said John grimly. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople have\r\nfound that out. And I should choose to be free as preferable of the\r\ntwo. As an extra caution you\xe2\x80\x99d better dump the contents of your jewel\r\nbox into your pockets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the two girls met John in the dark corridor and they\r\ndescended to the main floor of the ch\xc3\xa2teau. Passing for the last time\r\nthrough the magnificence of the splendid halls, they stood for a\r\nmoment out on the terrace, watching the burning negro quarters and the\r\nflaming embers of two planes which had fallen on the other side of the\r\nlake. A solitary gun was still keeping up a sturdy popping, and the\r\nattackers seemed timorous about descending lower, but sent their\r\nthunderous fireworks in a circle around it, until any chance shot\r\nmight annihilate its Ethiopian crew.\r\n\r\nJohn and the two sisters passed down the marble steps, turned sharply\r\nto the left, and began to ascend a narrow path that wound like a\r\ngarter about the diamond mountain. Kismine knew a heavily wooded spot\r\nhalf-way up where they could lie concealed and yet be able to observe\r\nthe wild night in the valley--finally to make an escape, when it\r\nshould be necessary, along a secret path laid in a rocky gully.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nIt was three o\xe2\x80\x99clock when they attained their destination. The\r\nobliging and phlegmatic Jasmine fell off to sleep immediately, leaning\r\nagainst the trunk of a large tree, while John and Kismine sat, his arm\r\naround her, and watched the desperate ebb and flow of the dying battle\r\namong the ruins of a vista that had been a garden spot that morning.\r\nShortly after four o\xe2\x80\x99clock the last remaining gun gave out a clanging\r\nsound, and went out of action in a swift tongue of red smoke. Though\r\nthe moon was down, they saw that the flying bodies were circling\r\ncloser to the earth. When the planes had made certain that the\r\nbeleaguered possessed no further resources they would land and the\r\ndark and glittering reign of the Washingtons would be over.\r\n\r\nWith the cessation of the firing the valley grew quiet. The embers of\r\nthe two aeroplanes glowed like the eyes of some monster crouching in\r\nthe grass. The ch\xc3\xa2teau stood dark and silent, beautiful without light\r\nas it had been beautiful in the sun, while the woody rattles of\r\nNemesis filled the air above with a growing and receding complaint.\r\nThen John perceived that Kismine, like her sister, had fallen sound\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nIt was long after four when he became aware of footsteps along the\r\npath they had lately followed, and he waited in breathless silence\r\nuntil the persons to whom they belonged had passed the vantage-point\r\nhe occupied. There was a faint stir in the air now that was not of\r\nhuman origin, and the dew was cold; he knew that the dawn would break\r\nsoon. John waited until the steps had gone a safe distance up the\r\nmountain and were inaudible. Then he followed. About half-way to the\r\nsteep summit the trees fell away and a hard saddle of rock spread\r\nitself over the diamond beneath. Just before he reached this point he\r\nslowed down his pace, warned by an animal sense that there was life\r\njust ahead of him. Coming to a high boulder, he lifted his head\r\ngradually above its edge. His curiosity was rewarded; this is what he\r\nsaw:\r\n\r\nBraddock Washington was standing there motionless, silhouetted against\r\nthe gray sky without sound or sign of life. As the dawn came up out of\r\nthe east, lending a gold green colour to the earth, it brought the\r\nsolitary figure into insignificant contrast with the new day.\r\n\r\nWhile John watched, his host remained for a few moments absorbed in\r\nsome inscrutable contemplation; then he signalled to the two negroes\r\nwho crouched at his feet to lift the burden which lay between them. As\r\nthey struggled upright, the first yellow beam of the sun struck\r\nthrough the innumerable prisms of an immense and exquisitely chiselled\r\ndiamond--and a white radiance was kindled that glowed upon the air\r\nlike a fragment of the morning star. The bearers staggered beneath its\r\nweight for a moment--then their rippling muscles caught and hardened\r\nunder the wet shine of the skins and the three figures were again\r\nmotionless in their defiant impotency before the heavens.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the white man lifted his head and slowly raised his arms\r\nin a gesture of attention, as one who would call a great crowd to\r\nhear--but there was no crowd, only the vast silence of the mountain\r\nand the sky, broken by faint bird voices down among the trees. The\r\nfigure on the saddle of rock began to speak ponderously and with an\r\ninextinguishable pride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou--out there--!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou--there----!\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, his arms still uplifted, his head held\r\nattentively as though he were expecting an answer. John strained his\r\neyes to see whether there might be men coming down the mountain, but\r\nthe mountain was bare of human life. There was only sky and a mocking\r\nflute of wind along the treetops. Could Washington be praying? For a\r\nmoment John wondered. Then the illusion passed--there was something in\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s whole attitude antithetical to prayer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you above there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice was become strong and confident. This was no forlorn\r\nsupplication. If anything, there was in it a quality of monstrous\r\ncondescension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou there--\xe2\x80\x9d Words, too quickly uttered to be understood, flowing\r\none into the other .... John listened breathlessly, catching a phrase\r\nhere and there, while the voice broke off, resumed, broke off\r\nagain--now strong and argumentative, now coloured with a slow, puzzled\r\nimpatience. Then a conviction commenced to dawn on the single\r\nlistener, and as realisation crept over him a spray of quick blood\r\nrushed through his arteries. Braddock Washington was offering a bribe\r\nto God!\r\n\r\nThat was it--there was no doubt. The diamond in the arms of his slaves\r\nwas some advance sample, a promise of more to follow.\r\n\r\nThat, John perceived after a time, was the thread running through his\r\nsentences. Prometheus Enriched was calling to witness forgotten\r\nsacrifices, forgotten rituals, prayers obsolete before the birth of\r\nChrist. For a while his discourse took the form of reminding God of\r\nthis gift or that which Divinity had deigned to accept from men--great\r\nchurches if he would rescue cities from the plague, gifts of myrrh and\r\ngold, of human lives and beautiful women and captive armies, of\r\nchildren and queens, of beasts of the forest and field, sheep and\r\ngoats, harvests and cities, whole conquered lands that had been\r\noffered up in lust or blood for His appeasal, buying a meed\xe2\x80\x99s worth of\r\nalleviation from the Divine wrath--and now he, Braddock Washington,\r\nEmperor of Diamonds, king and priest of the age of gold, arbiter of\r\nsplendour and luxury, would offer up a treasure such as princes before\r\nhim had never dreamed of, offer it up not in suppliance, but in pride.\r\n\r\nHe would give to God, he continued, getting down to specifications,\r\nthe greatest diamond in the world. This diamond would be cut with many\r\nmore thousand facets than there were leaves on a tree, and yet the\r\nwhole diamond would be shaped with the perfection of a stone no bigger\r\nthan a fly. Many men would work upon it for many years. It would be\r\nset in a great dome of beaten gold, wonderfully carved and equipped\r\nwith gates of opal and crusted sapphire. In the middle would be\r\nhollowed out a chapel presided over by an altar of iridescent,\r\ndecomposing, ever-changing radium which would burn out the eyes of any\r\nworshipper who lifted up his head from prayer--and on this altar there\r\nwould be slain for the amusement of the Divine Benefactor any victim\r\nHe should choose, even though it should be the greatest and most\r\npowerful man alive.\r\n\r\nIn return he asked only a simple thing, a thing that for God would be\r\nabsurdly easy--only that matters should be as they were yesterday at\r\nthis hour and that they should so remain. So very simple! Let but the\r\nheavens open, swallowing these men and their aeroplanes--and then\r\nclose again. Let him have his slaves once more, restored to life and\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThere was no one else with whom he had ever needed to treat or\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nHe doubted only whether he had made his bribe big enough. God had His\r\nprice, of course. God was made in man\xe2\x80\x99s image, so it had been said: He\r\nmust have His price. And the price would be rare--no cathedral whose\r\nbuilding consumed many years, no pyramid constructed by ten thousand\r\nworkmen, would be like this cathedral, this pyramid.\r\n\r\nHe paused here. That was his proposition. Everything would be up to\r\nspecifications, and there was nothing vulgar in his assertion that it\r\nwould be cheap at the price. He implied that Providence could take it\r\nor leave it.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the end his sentences became broken, became short and\r\nuncertain, and his body seemed tense, seemed strained to catch the\r\nslightest pressure or whisper of life in the spaces around him. His\r\nhair had turned gradually white as he talked, and now he lifted his\r\nhead high to the heavens like a prophet of old--magnificently mad.\r\n\r\nThen, as John stared in giddy fascination, it seemed to him that a\r\ncurious phenomenon took place somewhere around him. It was as though\r\nthe sky had darkened for an instant, as though there had been a sudden\r\nmurmur in a gust of wind, a sound of far-away trumpets, a sighing like\r\nthe rustle of a great silken robe--for a time the whole of nature\r\nround about partook of this darkness; the birds\xe2\x80\x99 song ceased; the\r\ntrees were still, and far over the mountain there was a mutter of\r\ndull, menacing thunder.\r\n\r\nThat was all. The wind died along the tall grasses of the valley. The\r\ndawn and the day resumed their place in a time, and the risen sun sent\r\nhot waves of yellow mist that made its path bright before it. The\r\nleaves laughed in the sun, and their laughter shook until each bough\r\nwas like a girl\xe2\x80\x99s school in fairyland. God had refused to accept the\r\nbribe.\r\n\r\nFor another moment John watched the triumph of the day. Then,\r\nturning, he saw a flutter of brown down by the lake, then another\r\nflutter, then another, like the dance of golden angels alighting from\r\nthe clouds. The aeroplanes had come to earth.\r\n\r\nJohn slid off the boulder and ran down the side of the mountain to the\r\nclump of trees, where the two girls were awake and waiting for him.\r\nKismine sprang to her feet, the jewels in her pockets jingling, a\r\nquestion on her parted lips, but instinct told John that there was no\r\ntime for words. They must get off the mountain without losing a\r\nmoment. He seized a hand of each, and in silence they threaded the\r\ntree-trunks, washed with light now and with the rising mist. Behind\r\nthem from the valley came no sound at all, except the complaint of the\r\npeacocks far away and the pleasant undertone of morning.\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone about half a mile, they avoided the park land and\r\nentered a narrow path that led over the next rise of ground. At the\r\nhighest point of this they paused and turned around. Their eyes rested\r\nupon the mountainside they had just left--oppressed by some dark sense\r\nof tragic impendency.\r\n\r\nClear against the sky a broken, white-haired man was slowly descending\r\nthe steep slope, followed by two gigantic and emotionless negroes, who\r\ncarried a burden between them which still flashed and glittered in the\r\nsun. Half-way down two other figures joined them--John could see that\r\nthey were Mrs. Washington and her son, upon whose arm she leaned. The\r\naviators had clambered from their machines to the sweeping lawn in\r\nfront of the ch\xc3\xa2teau, and with rifles in hand were starting up the\r\ndiamond mountain in skirmishing formation.\r\n\r\nBut the little group of five which had formed farther up and was\r\nengrossing all the watchers\xe2\x80\x99 attention had stopped upon a ledge of\r\nrock. The negroes stooped and pulled up what appeared to be a\r\ntrap-door in the side of the mountain. Into this they all disappeared,\r\nthe white-haired man first, then his wife and son, finally the two\r\nnegroes, the glittering tips of whose jewelled head-dresses caught the\r\nsun for a moment before the trap-door descended and engulfed them all.\r\n\r\nKismine clutched John\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried wildly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are they going? What are they going to\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be some underground way of escape--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little scream from the two girls interrupted his sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Kismine hysterically. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mountain is wired!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven as she spoke John put up his hands to shield his sight. Before\r\ntheir eyes the whole surface of the mountain had changed suddenly to a\r\ndazzling burning yellow, which showed up through the jacket of turf as\r\nlight shows through a human hand. For a moment the intolerable glow\r\ncontinued, and then like an extinguished filament it disappeared,\r\nrevealing a black waste from which blue smoke arose slowly, carrying\r\noff with it what remained of vegetation and of human flesh. Of the\r\naviators there was left neither blood nor bone--they were consumed as\r\ncompletely as the five souls who had gone inside.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, and with an immense concussion, the ch\xc3\xa2teau literally\r\nthrew itself into the air, bursting into flaming fragments as it rose,\r\nand then tumbling back upon itself in a smoking pile that lay\r\nprojecting half into the water of the lake. There was no fire--what\r\nsmoke there was drifted off mingling with the sunshine, and for a few\r\nminutes longer a powdery dust of marble drifted from the great\r\nfeatureless pile that had once been the house of jewels. There was no\r\nmore sound and the three people were alone in the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nAt sunset John and his two companions reached the huge cliff which had\r\nmarked the boundaries of the Washingtons\xe2\x80\x99 dominion, and looking back\r\nfound the valley tranquil and lovely in the dusk. They sat down to\r\nfinish the food which Jasmine had brought with her in a basket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she spread the table-cloth and put the\r\nsandwiches in a neat pile upon it. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t they look tempting? I always\r\nthink that food tastes better outdoors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith that remark,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Kismine, \xe2\x80\x9cJasmine enters the middle\r\nclass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said John eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cturn out your pocket and let\xe2\x80\x99s see what\r\njewels you brought along. If you made a good selection we three ought\r\nto live comfortably all the rest of our lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObediently Kismine put her hand in her pocket and tossed two handfuls\r\nof glittering stones before him. \xe2\x80\x9cNot so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d cried John\r\nenthusiastically. \xe2\x80\x9cThey aren\xe2\x80\x99t very big, but--Hello!\xe2\x80\x9d His expression\r\nchanged as he held one of them up to the declining sun. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, these\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t diamonds! There\xe2\x80\x99s something the matter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy golly!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Kismine, with a startled look. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an idiot I\r\nam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, these are rhinestones!\xe2\x80\x9d cried John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know.\xe2\x80\x9d She broke into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI opened the wrong drawer. They\r\nbelonged on the dress of a girl who visited Jasmine. I got her to give\r\nthem to me in exchange for diamonds. I\xe2\x80\x99d never seen anything but\r\nprecious stones before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is what you brought?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid so.\xe2\x80\x9d She fingered the brilliants wistfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\r\nlike these better. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little tired of diamonds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said John gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to live in Hades. And you\r\nwill grow old telling incredulous women that you got the wrong drawer.\r\nUnfortunately, your father\xe2\x80\x99s bank-books were consumed with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with Hades?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I come home with a wife at my age my father is just as liable as\r\nnot to cut me off with a hot coal, as they say down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJasmine spoke up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love washing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have always washed my own\r\nhandkerchiefs. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take in laundry and support you both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo they have washwomen in Hades?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kismine innocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d answered John. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just like anywhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought--perhaps it was too hot to wear any clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust try it!\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll run you out before you\xe2\x80\x99re half\r\nstarted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill father be there?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nJohn turned to her in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied sombrely. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should he go to\r\nHades? You have it confused with another place that was abolished long\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter supper they folded up the table-cloth and spread their blankets\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a dream it was,\xe2\x80\x9d Kismine sighed, gazing up at the stars. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nstrange it seems to be here with one dress and a penniless fianc\xc3\xa9e!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the stars,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI never noticed the stars before. I\r\nalways thought of them as great big diamonds that belonged to some\r\none. Now they frighten me. They make me feel that it was all a dream,\r\nall my youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _was_ a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d said John quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody\xe2\x80\x99s youth is a\r\ndream, a form of chemical madness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow pleasant then to be insane!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99m told,\xe2\x80\x9d said John gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know any longer. At any\r\nrate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nform of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only\r\ndiamonds in the whole world, diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of\r\ndisillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d He shivered. \xe2\x80\x9cTurn up your coat collar, little girl, the\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s full of chill and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get pneumonia. His was a great sin\r\nwho first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo wrapping himself in his blanket he fell off to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1860 it was the proper thing to be born at home. At\r\npresent, so I am told, the high gods of medicine have decreed that the\r\nfirst cries of the young shall be uttered upon the anaesthetic air of\r\na hospital, preferably a fashionable one. So young Mr. and Mrs. Roger\r\nButton were fifty years ahead of style when they decided, one day in\r\nthe summer of 1860, that their first baby should be born in a\r\nhospital. Whether this anachronism had any bearing upon the\r\nastonishing history I am about to set down will never be known.\r\n\r\nI shall tell you what occurred, and let you judge for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Roger Buttons held an enviable position, both social and\r\nfinancial, in ante-bellum Baltimore. They were related to the This\r\nFamily and the That Family, which, as every Southerner knew, entitled\r\nthem to membership in that enormous peerage which largely populated\r\nthe Confederacy. This was their first experience with the charming old\r\ncustom of having babies--Mr. Button was naturally nervous. He hoped it\r\nwould be a boy so that he could be sent to Yale College in\r\nConnecticut, at which institution Mr. Button himself had been known\r\nfor four years by the somewhat obvious nickname of \xe2\x80\x9cCuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the September morning consecrated to the enormous event he arose\r\nnervously at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, dressed himself, adjusted an impeccable\r\nstock, and hurried forth through the streets of Baltimore to the\r\nhospital, to determine whether the darkness of the night had borne in\r\nnew life upon its bosom.\r\n\r\nWhen he was approximately a hundred yards from the Maryland Private\r\nHospital for Ladies and Gentlemen he saw Doctor Keene, the family\r\nphysician, descending the front steps, rubbing his hands together with\r\na washing movement--as all doctors are required to do by the unwritten\r\nethics of their profession.\r\n\r\nMr. Roger Button, the president of Roger Button & Co., Wholesale\r\nHardware, began to run toward Doctor Keene with much less dignity than\r\nwas expected from a Southern gentleman of that picturesque period.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Keene!\xe2\x80\x9d he called. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Doctor Keene!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor heard him, faced around, and stood waiting, a curious\r\nexpression settling on his harsh, medicinal face as Mr. Button drew\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr. Button, as he came up in a gasping rush.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it? How is she? A boy? Who is it? What--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk sense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor Keene sharply. He appeared somewhat\r\nirritated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the child born?\xe2\x80\x9d begged Mr. Button.\r\n\r\nDoctor Keene frowned. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, I suppose so--after a fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d Again\r\nhe threw a curious glance at Mr. Button.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my wife all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a boy or a girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere now!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Doctor Keene in a perfect passion of irritation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you to go and see for yourself. Outrageous!\xe2\x80\x9d He snapped the\r\nlast word out in almost one syllable, then he turned away muttering:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you imagine a case like this will help my professional reputation?\r\nOne more would ruin me--ruin anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr. Button appalled. \xe2\x80\x9cTriplets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not triplets!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the doctor cuttingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s more, you\r\ncan go and see for yourself. And get another doctor. I brought you\r\ninto the world, young man, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been physician to your family for\r\nforty years, but I\xe2\x80\x99m through with you! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you or any\r\nof your relatives ever again! Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he turned sharply, and without another word climbed into his\r\nphaeton, which was waiting at the curbstone, and drove severely away.\r\n\r\nMr. Button stood there upon the sidewalk, stupefied and trembling from\r\nhead to foot. What horrible mishap had occurred? He had suddenly lost\r\nall desire to go into the Maryland Private Hospital for Ladies and\r\nGentlemen--it was with the greatest difficulty that, a moment later,\r\nhe forced himself to mount the steps and enter the front door.\r\n\r\nA nurse was sitting behind a desk in the opaque gloom of the hall.\r\nSwallowing his shame, Mr. Button approached her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, looking up at him pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning. I--I am Mr. Button.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this a look of utter terror spread itself over the girl\xe2\x80\x99s face. She\r\nrose to her feet and seemed about to fly from the hall, restraining\r\nherself only with the most apparent difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to see my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Button.\r\n\r\nThe nurse gave a little scream. \xe2\x80\x9cOh--of course!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried\r\nhysterically. \xe2\x80\x9cUpstairs. Right upstairs. Go--_up!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pointed the direction, and Mr. Button, bathed in cool\r\nperspiration, turned falteringly, and began to mount to the second\r\nfloor. In the upper hall he addressed another nurse who approached\r\nhim, basin in hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Mr. Button,\xe2\x80\x9d he managed to articulate. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant to see my----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClank! The basin clattered to the floor and rolled in the direction of\r\nthe stairs. Clank! Clank! It began a methodical descent as if sharing\r\nin the general terror which this gentleman provoked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to see my child!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Button almost shrieked. He was on the\r\nverge of collapse.\r\n\r\nClank! The basin reached the first floor. The nurse regained control\r\nof herself, and threw Mr. Button a look of hearty contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll _right_, Mr. Button,\xe2\x80\x9d she agreed in a hushed voice. \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\n_well!_ But if you _knew_ what a state it\xe2\x80\x99s put us all in this\r\nmorning! It\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly outrageous! The hospital will never have\r\na ghost of a reputation after----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried hoarsely. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stand this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome this way, then, Mr. Button.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dragged himself after her. At the end of a long hall they reached a\r\nroom from which proceeded a variety of howls--indeed, a room which, in\r\nlater parlance, would have been known as the \xe2\x80\x9ccrying-room.\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Mr. Button, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse.\r\n\r\nMr. Button\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed her pointing finger, and this is what he\r\nsaw. Wrapped in a voluminous white blanket, and partly crammed into\r\none of the cribs, there sat an old man apparently about seventy years\r\nof age. His sparse hair was almost white, and from his chin dripped a\r\nlong smoke-coloured beard, which waved absurdly back and forth, fanned\r\nby the breeze coming in at the window. He looked up at Mr. Button with\r\ndim, faded eyes in which lurked a puzzled question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I mad?\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Mr. Button, his terror resolving into rage. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthis some ghastly hospital joke?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a joke to us,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the nurse severely. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you\xe2\x80\x99re mad or not--but that is most certainly\r\nyour child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cool perspiration redoubled on Mr. Button\xe2\x80\x99s forehead. He closed\r\nhis eyes, and then, opening them, looked again. There was no\r\nmistake--he was gazing at a man of threescore and ten--a _baby_\r\nof threescore and ten, a baby whose feet hung over the sides of the\r\ncrib in which it was reposing.\r\n\r\nThe old man looked placidly from one to the other for a moment, and\r\nthen suddenly spoke in a cracked and ancient voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you my\r\nfather?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\nMr. Button and the nurse started violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause if you are,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the old man querulously, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nget me out of this place--or, at least, get them to put a comfortable\r\nrocker in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere in God\xe2\x80\x99s name did you come from? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Mr.\r\nButton frantically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you _exactly_ who I am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the querulous\r\nwhine, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve only been born a few hours--but my last name is\r\ncertainly Button.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lie! You\xe2\x80\x99re an impostor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man turned wearily to the nurse. \xe2\x80\x9cNice way to welcome a\r\nnew-born child,\xe2\x80\x9d he complained in a weak voice. \xe2\x80\x9cTell him he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong,\r\nwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wrong, Mr. Button,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse severely. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is your\r\nchild, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make the best of it. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask you\r\nto take him home with you as soon as possible--some time to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Button incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we can\xe2\x80\x99t have him here. We really can\xe2\x80\x99t, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m right glad of it,\xe2\x80\x9d whined the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a fine place to\r\nkeep a youngster of quiet tastes. With all this yelling and howling, I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to get a wink of sleep. I asked for something to\r\neat\xe2\x80\x9d--here his voice rose to a shrill note of protest--\xe2\x80\x9cand they\r\nbrought me a bottle of milk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Button, sank down upon a chair near his son and concealed his face\r\nin his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cMy heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, in an ecstasy of horror.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will people say? What must I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take him home,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted the nurse--\xe2\x80\x9cimmediately!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA grotesque picture formed itself with dreadful clarity before the\r\neyes of the tortured man--a picture of himself walking through the\r\ncrowded streets of the city with this appalling apparition stalking by\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t. I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he moaned.\r\n\r\nPeople would stop to speak to him, and what was he going to say? He\r\nwould have to introduce this--this septuagenarian: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my son,\r\nborn early this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d And then the old man would gather his\r\nblanket around him and they would plod on, past the bustling stores,\r\nthe slave market--for a dark instant Mr. Button wished passionately\r\nthat his son was black--past the luxurious houses of the residential\r\ndistrict, past the home for the aged....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! Pull yourself together,\xe2\x80\x9d commanded the nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man announced suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cif you think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\nwalk home in this blanket, you\xe2\x80\x99re entirely mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBabies always have blankets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a malicious crackle the old man held up a small white swaddling\r\ngarment. \xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d he quavered. \xe2\x80\x9c_This_ is what they had ready for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBabies always wear those,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse primly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cthis baby\xe2\x80\x99s not going to wear anything in\r\nabout two minutes. This blanket itches. They might at least have given\r\nme a sheet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep it on! Keep it on!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Button hurriedly. He turned to the\r\nnurse. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo down town and buy your son some clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Button\xe2\x80\x99s son\xe2\x80\x99s voice followed him down into the hall: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd a\r\ncane, father. I want to have a cane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Button banged the outer door savagely....\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Button said nervously, to the clerk in the\r\nChesapeake Dry Goods Company. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to buy some clothes for my\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old is your child, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout six hours,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Button, without due consideration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBabies\xe2\x80\x99 supply department in the rear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think--I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s what I want. It\xe2\x80\x99s--he\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nunusually large-size child. Exceptionally--ah large.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have the largest child\xe2\x80\x99s sizes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the boys\xe2\x80\x99 department?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Button, shifting his\r\nground desperately. He felt that the clerk must surely scent his\r\nshameful secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell----\xe2\x80\x9d He hesitated. The notion of dressing his son in men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothes was repugnant to him. If, say, he could only find a very large\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s suit, he might cut off that long and awful beard, dye the white\r\nhair brown, and thus manage to conceal the worst, and to retain\r\nsomething of his own self-respect--not to mention his position in\r\nBaltimore society.\r\n\r\nBut a frantic inspection of the boys\xe2\x80\x99 department revealed no suits to\r\nfit the new-born Button. He blamed the store, of course--in such\r\ncases it is the thing to blame the store.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old did you say that boy of yours was?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the clerk\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s--sixteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I beg your pardon. I thought you said six _hours_. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind the youths\xe2\x80\x99 department in the next aisle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Button turned miserably away. Then he stopped, brightened, and\r\npointed his finger toward a dressed dummy in the window display.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take that suit, out there on the dummy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clerk stared. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s not a child\xe2\x80\x99s suit. At\r\nleast it _is_, but it\xe2\x80\x99s for fancy dress. You could wear it\r\nyourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrap it up,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted his customer nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe astonished clerk obeyed.\r\n\r\nBack at the hospital Mr. Button entered the nursery and almost threw\r\nthe package at his son. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s your clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d he snapped out.\r\n\r\nThe old man untied the package and viewed the contents with a\r\nquizzical eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey look sort of funny to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he complained, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be\r\nmade a monkey of--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve made a monkey of me!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Button fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cNever you\r\nmind how funny you look. Put them on--or I\xe2\x80\x99ll--or I\xe2\x80\x99ll _spank_\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d He swallowed uneasily at the penultimate word, feeling\r\nnevertheless that it was the proper thing to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, father\xe2\x80\x9d--this with a grotesque simulation of filial\r\nrespect--\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve lived longer; you know best. Just as you say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs before, the sound of the word \xe2\x80\x9cfather\xe2\x80\x9d caused Mr. Button to start\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hurrying, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen his son was dressed Mr. Button regarded him with depression. The\r\ncostume consisted of dotted socks, pink pants, and a belted blouse\r\nwith a wide white collar. Over the latter waved the long whitish\r\nbeard, drooping almost to the waist. The effect was not good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Button seized a hospital shears and with three quick snaps\r\namputated a large section of the beard. But even with this improvement\r\nthe ensemble fell far short of perfection. The remaining brush of\r\nscraggly hair, the watery eyes, the ancient teeth, seemed oddly out of\r\ntone with the gaiety of the costume. Mr. Button, however, was\r\nobdurate--he held out his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along!\xe2\x80\x9d he said sternly.\r\n\r\nHis son took the hand trustingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to call me,\r\ndad?\xe2\x80\x9d he quavered as they walked from the nursery--\xe2\x80\x9cjust \xe2\x80\x98baby\xe2\x80\x99 for a\r\nwhile? till you think of a better name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Button grunted. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered harshly. \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll call you Methuselah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEven after the new addition to the Button family had had his hair cut\r\nshort and then dyed to a sparse unnatural black, had had his face\r\nshaved so close that it glistened, and had been attired in small-boy\r\nclothes made to order by a flabbergasted tailor, it was impossible for\r\nButton to ignore the fact that his son was a poor excuse for a first\r\nfamily baby. Despite his aged stoop, Benjamin Button--for it was by\r\nthis name they called him instead of by the appropriate but invidious\r\nMethuselah--was five feet eight inches tall. His clothes did not\r\nconceal this, nor did the clipping and dyeing of his eyebrows disguise\r\nthe fact that the eyes underneath were faded and watery and tired. In\r\nfact, the baby-nurse who had been engaged in advance left the house\r\nafter one look, in a state of considerable indignation.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Button persisted in his unwavering purpose. Benjamin was a\r\nbaby, and a baby he should remain. At first he declared that if\r\nBenjamin didn\xe2\x80\x99t like warm milk he could go without food altogether,\r\nbut he was finally prevailed upon to allow his son bread and butter,\r\nand even oatmeal by way of a compromise. One day he brought home a\r\nrattle and, giving it to Benjamin, insisted in no uncertain terms that\r\nhe should \xe2\x80\x9cplay with it,\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon the old man took it with a weary\r\nexpression and could be heard jingling it obediently at intervals\r\nthroughout the day.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, though, that the rattle bored him, and that he\r\nfound other and more soothing amusements when he was left alone. For\r\ninstance, Mr. Button discovered one day that during the preceding week\r\nhe had smoked more cigars than ever before--a phenomenon, which was\r\nexplained a few days later when, entering the nursery unexpectedly, he\r\nfound the room full of faint blue haze and Benjamin, with a guilty\r\nexpression on his face, trying to conceal the butt of a dark Havana.\r\nThis, of course, called for a severe spanking, but Mr. Button found\r\nthat he could not bring himself to administer it. He merely warned his\r\nson that he would \xe2\x80\x9cstunt his growth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless he persisted in his attitude. He brought home lead\r\nsoldiers, he brought toy trains, he brought large pleasant animals\r\nmade of cotton, and, to perfect the illusion which he was\r\ncreating--for himself at least--he passionately demanded of the clerk\r\nin the toy-store whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe paint would come oft the pink duck if\r\nthe baby put it in his mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d But, despite all his father\xe2\x80\x99s efforts,\r\nBenjamin refused to be interested. He would steal down the back stairs\r\nand return to the nursery with a volume of the Encyclopedia\r\nBritannica, over which he would pore through an afternoon, while his\r\ncotton cows and his Noah\xe2\x80\x99s ark were left neglected on the floor.\r\nAgainst such a stubbornness Mr. Button\xe2\x80\x99s efforts were of little avail.\r\n\r\nThe sensation created in Baltimore was, at first, prodigious. What the\r\nmishap would have cost the Buttons and their kinsfolk socially cannot\r\nbe determined, for the outbreak of the Civil War drew the city\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention to other things. A few people who were unfailingly polite\r\nracked their brains for compliments to give to the parents--and\r\nfinally hit upon the ingenious device of declaring that the baby\r\nresembled his grandfather, a fact which, due to the standard state of\r\ndecay common to all men of seventy, could not be denied. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nRoger Button were not pleased, and Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather was\r\nfuriously insulted.\r\n\r\nBenjamin, once he left the hospital, took life as he found it. Several\r\nsmall boys were brought to see him, and he spent a stiff-jointed\r\nafternoon trying to work up an interest in tops and marbles--he even\r\nmanaged, quite accidentally, to break a kitchen window with a stone\r\nfrom a sling shot, a feat which secretly delighted his father.\r\n\r\nThereafter Benjamin contrived to break something every day, but he did\r\nthese things only because they were expected of him, and because he\r\nwas by nature obliging.\r\n\r\nWhen his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s initial antagonism wore off, Benjamin and that\r\ngentleman took enormous pleasure in one another\xe2\x80\x99s company. They would\r\nsit for hours, these two, so far apart in age and experience, and,\r\nlike old cronies, discuss with tireless monotony the slow events of\r\nthe day. Benjamin felt more at ease in his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s presence than\r\nin his parents\xe2\x80\x99--they seemed always somewhat in awe of him and,\r\ndespite the dictatorial authority they exercised over him, frequently\r\naddressed him as \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was as puzzled as any one else at the apparently advanced age of\r\nhis mind and body at birth. He read up on it in the medical journal,\r\nbut found that no such case had been previously recorded. At his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s urging he made an honest attempt to play with other boys, and\r\nfrequently he joined in the milder games--football shook him up too\r\nmuch, and he feared that in case of a fracture his ancient bones would\r\nrefuse to knit.\r\n\r\nWhen he was five he was sent to kindergarten, where he was initiated into\r\nthe art of pasting green paper on orange paper, of weaving coloured\r\nmaps and manufacturing eternal cardboard necklaces. He was inclined to\r\ndrowse off to sleep in the middle of these tasks, a habit which both\r\nirritated and frightened his young teacher. To his relief she\r\ncomplained to his parents, and he was removed from the school. The\r\nRoger Buttons told their friends that they felt he was too young.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was twelve years old his parents had grown used to him.\r\nIndeed, so strong is the force of custom that they no longer felt that\r\nhe was different from any other child--except when some curious\r\nanomaly reminded them of the fact. But one day a few weeks after his\r\ntwelfth birthday, while looking in the mirror, Benjamin made, or\r\nthought he made, an astonishing discovery. Did his eyes deceive him,\r\nor had his hair turned in the dozen years of his life from white to\r\niron-gray under its concealing dye? Was the network of wrinkles on his\r\nface becoming less pronounced? Was his skin healthier and firmer, with\r\neven a touch of ruddy winter colour? He could not tell. He knew that\r\nhe no longer stooped, and that his physical condition had improved\r\nsince the early days of his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be----?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, or, rather, scarcely dared to\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nHe went to his father. \xe2\x80\x9cI am grown,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced determinedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant to put on long trousers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Fourteen\r\nis the age for putting on long trousers--and you are only twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to admit,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Benjamin, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99m big for my\r\nage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father looked at him with illusory speculation. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not so\r\nsure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was as big as you when I was twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was not true--it was all part of Roger Button\xe2\x80\x99s silent agreement\r\nwith himself to believe in his son\xe2\x80\x99s normality.\r\n\r\nFinally a compromise was reached. Benjamin was to continue to dye his\r\nhair. He was to make a better attempt to play with boys of his own\r\nage. He was not to wear his spectacles or carry a cane in the street.\r\nIn return for these concessions he was allowed his first suit of long\r\ntrousers....\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOf the life of Benjamin Button between his twelfth and twenty-first\r\nyear I intend to say little. Suffice to record that they were years of\r\nnormal ungrowth. When Benjamin was eighteen he was erect as a man of\r\nfifty; he had more hair and it was of a dark gray; his step was firm,\r\nhis voice had lost its cracked quaver and descended to a healthy\r\nbaritone. So his father sent him up to Connecticut to take\r\nexaminations for entrance to Yale College. Benjamin passed his\r\nexamination and became a member of the freshman class.\r\n\r\nOn the third day following his matriculation he received a\r\nnotification from Mr. Hart, the college registrar, to call at his\r\noffice and arrange his schedule. Benjamin, glancing in the mirror,\r\ndecided that his hair needed a new application of its brown dye, but\r\nan anxious inspection of his bureau drawer disclosed that the dye\r\nbottle was not there. Then he remembered--he had emptied it the day\r\nbefore and thrown it away.\r\n\r\nHe was in a dilemma. He was due at the registrar\xe2\x80\x99s in five minutes.\r\nThere seemed to be no help for it--he must go as he was. He did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the registrar politely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve come to inquire\r\nabout your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, as a matter of fact, my name\xe2\x80\x99s Button----\xe2\x80\x9d began Benjamin, but\r\nMr. Hart cut him off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very glad to meet you, Mr. Button. I\xe2\x80\x99m expecting your son here\r\nany minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s me!\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Benjamin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a freshman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a freshman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you\xe2\x80\x99re joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe registrar frowned and glanced at a card before him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I have\r\nMr. Benjamin Button\xe2\x80\x99s age down here as eighteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my age,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Benjamin, flushing slightly.\r\n\r\nThe registrar eyed him wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cNow surely, Mr. Button, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect me to believe that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBenjamin smiled wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cI am eighteen,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\nThe registrar pointed sternly to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cGet out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGet\r\nout of college and get out of town. You are a dangerous lunatic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am eighteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Hart opened the door. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cA man of your age\r\ntrying to enter here as a freshman. Eighteen years old, are you? Well,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you eighteen minutes to get out of town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBenjamin Button walked with dignity from the room, and half a dozen\r\nundergraduates, who were waiting in the hall, followed him curiously\r\nwith their eyes. When he had gone a little way he turned around, faced\r\nthe infuriated registrar, who was still standing in the door-way, and\r\nrepeated in a firm voice: \xe2\x80\x9cI am eighteen years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo a chorus of titters which went up from the group of undergraduates,\r\nBenjamin walked away.\r\n\r\nBut he was not fated to escape so easily. On his melancholy walk to\r\nthe railroad station he found that he was being followed by a group,\r\nthen by a swarm, and finally by a dense mass of undergraduates. The\r\nword had gone around that a lunatic had passed the entrance\r\nexaminations for Yale and attempted to palm himself off as a youth of\r\neighteen. A fever of excitement permeated the college. Men ran hatless\r\nout of classes, the football team abandoned its practice and joined\r\nthe mob, professors\xe2\x80\x99 wives with bonnets awry and bustles out of\r\nposition, ran shouting after the procession, from which proceeded a\r\ncontinual succession of remarks aimed at the tender sensibilities of\r\nBenjamin Button.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be the wandering Jew!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to go to prep school at his age!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the infant prodigy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thought this was the old men\xe2\x80\x99s home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo up to Harvard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBenjamin increased his gait, and soon he was running. He would show\r\nthem! He _would_ go to Harvard, and then they would regret these\r\nill-considered taunts!\r\n\r\nSafely on board the train for Baltimore, he put his head from the\r\nwindow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll regret this!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa-ha!\xe2\x80\x9d the undergraduates laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHa-ha-ha!\xe2\x80\x9d It was the biggest\r\nmistake that Yale College had ever made....\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIn 1880 Benjamin Button was twenty years old, and he signalised his\r\nbirthday by going to work for his father in Roger Button & Co.,\r\nWholesale Hardware. It was in that same year that he began \xe2\x80\x9cgoing out\r\nsocially\xe2\x80\x9d--that is, his father insisted on taking him to several\r\nfashionable dances. Roger Button was now fifty, and he and his son\r\nwere more and more companionable--in fact, since Benjamin had ceased\r\nto dye his hair (which was still grayish) they appeared about the same\r\nage, and could have passed for brothers.\r\n\r\nOne night in August they got into the phaeton attired in their\r\nfull-dress suits and drove out to a dance at the Shevlins\xe2\x80\x99 country\r\nhouse, situated just outside of Baltimore. It was a gorgeous evening.\r\nA full moon drenched the road to the lustreless colour of platinum,\r\nand late-blooming harvest flowers breathed into the motionless air\r\naromas that were like low, half-heard laughter. The open country,\r\ncarpeted for rods around with bright wheat, was translucent as in the\r\nday. It was almost impossible not to be affected by the sheer beauty\r\nof the sky--almost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a great future in the dry-goods business,\xe2\x80\x9d Roger Button was\r\nsaying. He was not a spiritual man--his aesthetic sense was\r\nrudimentary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld fellows like me can\xe2\x80\x99t learn new tricks,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed profoundly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s you youngsters with energy and vitality that have the great\r\nfuture before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFar up the road the lights of the Shevlins\xe2\x80\x99 country house drifted into\r\nview, and presently there was a sighing sound that crept persistently\r\ntoward them--it might have been the fine plaint of violins or the\r\nrustle of the silver wheat under the moon.\r\n\r\nThey pulled up behind a handsome brougham whose passengers were\r\ndisembarking at the door. A lady got out, then an elderly gentleman,\r\nthen another young lady, beautiful as sin. Benjamin started; an almost\r\nchemical change seemed to dissolve and recompose the very elements of\r\nhis body. A rigour passed over him, blood rose into his cheeks, his\r\nforehead, and there was a steady thumping in his ears. It was first\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nThe girl was slender and frail, with hair that was ashen under the\r\nmoon and honey-coloured under the sputtering gas-lamps of the porch.\r\nOver her shoulders was thrown a Spanish mantilla of softest yellow,\r\nbutterflied in black; her feet were glittering buttons at the hem of\r\nher bustled dress.\r\n\r\nRoger Button leaned over to his son. \xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis young\r\nHildegarde Moncrief, the daughter of General Moncrief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBenjamin nodded coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty little thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said indifferently.\r\nBut when the negro boy had led the buggy away, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cDad, you\r\nmight introduce me to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey approached a group, of which Miss Moncrief was the centre. Reared\r\nin the old tradition, she curtsied low before Benjamin. Yes, he might\r\nhave a dance. He thanked her and walked away--staggered away.\r\n\r\nThe interval until the time for his turn should arrive dragged itself\r\nout interminably. He stood close to the wall, silent, inscrutable,\r\nwatching with murderous eyes the young bloods of Baltimore as they\r\neddied around Hildegarde Moncrief, passionate admiration in their\r\nfaces. How obnoxious they seemed to Benjamin; how intolerably rosy!\r\nTheir curling brown whiskers aroused in him a feeling equivalent to\r\nindigestion.\r\n\r\nBut when his own time came, and he drifted with her out upon the\r\nchanging floor to the music of the latest waltz from Paris, his\r\njealousies and anxieties melted from him like a mantle of snow. Blind\r\nwith enchantment, he felt that life was just beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and your brother got here just as we did, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nHildegarde, looking up at him with eyes that were like bright blue\r\nenamel.\r\n\r\nBenjamin hesitated. If she took him for his father\xe2\x80\x99s brother, would it\r\nbe best to enlighten her? He remembered his experience at Yale, so he\r\ndecided against it. It would be rude to contradict a lady; it would be\r\ncriminal to mar this exquisite occasion with the grotesque story of\r\nhis origin. Later, perhaps. So he nodded, smiled, listened, was happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like men of your age,\xe2\x80\x9d Hildegarde told him. \xe2\x80\x9cYoung boys are so\r\nidiotic. They tell me how much champagne they drink at college, and\r\nhow much money they lose playing cards. Men of your age know how to\r\nappreciate women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBenjamin felt himself on the verge of a proposal--with an effort he\r\nchoked back the impulse. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re just the romantic age,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued--\xe2\x80\x9cfifty. Twenty-five is too worldly-wise; thirty is apt to be\r\npale from overwork; forty is the age of long stories that take a whole\r\ncigar to tell; sixty is--oh, sixty is too near seventy; but fifty is\r\nthe mellow age. I love fifty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFifty seemed to Benjamin a glorious age. He longed passionately to be\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always said,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Hildegarde, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99d rather marry a man\r\nof fifty and be taken care of than marry a man of thirty and take care\r\nof _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Benjamin the rest of the evening was bathed in a honey-coloured\r\nmist. Hildegarde gave him two more dances, and they discovered that\r\nthey were marvellously in accord on all the questions of the day. She\r\nwas to go driving with him on the following Sunday, and then they\r\nwould discuss all these questions further.\r\n\r\nGoing home in the phaeton just before the crack of dawn, when the\r\nfirst bees were humming and the fading moon glimmered in the cool dew,\r\nBenjamin knew vaguely that his father was discussing wholesale\r\nhardware.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c.... And what do you think should merit our biggest attention after\r\nhammers and nails?\xe2\x80\x9d the elder Button was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Benjamin absent-mindedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLugs?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Roger Button, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just covered the question\r\nof lugs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBenjamin regarded him with dazed eyes just as the eastern sky was\r\nsuddenly cracked with light, and an oriole yawned piercingly in the\r\nquickening trees...\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nWhen, six months later, the engagement of Miss Hildegarde Moncrief to\r\nMr. Benjamin Button was made known (I say \xe2\x80\x9cmade known,\xe2\x80\x9d for General\r\nMoncrief declared he would rather fall upon his sword than announce\r\nit), the excitement in Baltimore society reached a feverish pitch. The\r\nalmost forgotten story of Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s birth was remembered and sent out\r\nupon the winds of scandal in picaresque and incredible forms. It was\r\nsaid that Benjamin was really the father of Roger Button, that he was\r\nhis brother who had been in prison for forty years, that he was John\r\nWilkes Booth in disguise--and, finally, that he had two small conical\r\nhorns sprouting from his head.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday supplements of the New York papers played up the case with\r\nfascinating sketches which showed the head of Benjamin Button attached\r\nto a fish, to a snake, and, finally, to a body of solid brass. He\r\nbecame known, journalistically, as the Mystery Man of Maryland. But\r\nthe true story, as is usually the case, had a very small circulation.\r\n\r\nHowever, every one agreed with General Moncrief that it was \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor a lovely girl who could have married any beau in Baltimore to\r\nthrow herself into the arms of a man who was assuredly fifty. In vain\r\nMr. Roger Button published his son\xe2\x80\x99s birth certificate in large type in\r\nthe Baltimore _Blaze_. No one believed it. You had only to look\r\nat Benjamin and see.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the two people most concerned there was no wavering. So\r\nmany of the stories about her fianc\xc3\xa9 were false that Hildegarde\r\nrefused stubbornly to believe even the true one. In vain General\r\nMoncrief pointed out to her the high mortality among men of fifty--or,\r\nat least, among men who looked fifty; in vain he told her of the\r\ninstability of the wholesale hardware business. Hildegarde had chosen\r\nto marry for mellowness, and marry she did....\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIn one particular, at least, the friends of Hildegarde Moncrief were\r\nmistaken. The wholesale hardware business prospered amazingly. In the\r\nfifteen years between Benjamin Button\xe2\x80\x99s marriage in 1880 and his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s retirement in 1895, the family fortune was doubled--and this\r\nwas due largely to the younger member of the firm.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Baltimore eventually received the couple to its\r\nbosom. Even old General Moncrief became reconciled to his son-in-law\r\nwhen Benjamin gave him the money to bring out his _History of the\r\nCivil War_ in twenty volumes, which had been refused by nine\r\nprominent publishers.\r\n\r\nIn Benjamin himself fifteen years had wrought many changes. It seemed\r\nto him that the blood flowed with new vigour through his veins. It\r\nbegan to be a pleasure to rise in the morning, to walk with an active\r\nstep along the busy, sunny street, to work untiringly with his\r\nshipments of hammers and his cargoes of nails. It was in 1890 that he\r\nexecuted his famous business coup: he brought up the suggestion that\r\n_all nails used in nailing up the boxes in which nails are shipped\r\nare the property of the shippee_, a proposal which became a\r\nstatute, was approved by Chief Justice Fossile, and saved Roger Button\r\nand Company, Wholesale Hardware, more than _six hundred nails every\r\nyear_.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Benjamin discovered that he was becoming more and more\r\nattracted by the gay side of life. It was typical of his growing\r\nenthusiasm for pleasure that he was the first man in the city of\r\nBaltimore to own and run an automobile. Meeting him on the street, his\r\ncontemporaries would stare enviously at the picture he made of health\r\nand vitality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to grow younger every year,\xe2\x80\x9d they would remark. And if old\r\nRoger Button, now sixty-five years old, had failed at first to give a\r\nproper welcome to his son he atoned at last by bestowing on him what\r\namounted to adulation.\r\n\r\nAnd here we come to an unpleasant subject which it will be well to\r\npass over as quickly as possible. There was only one thing that\r\nworried Benjamin Button; his wife had ceased to attract him.\r\n\r\nAt that time Hildegarde was a woman of thirty-five, with a son,\r\nRoscoe, fourteen years old. In the early days of their marriage\r\nBenjamin had worshipped her. But, as the years passed, her\r\nhoney-coloured hair became an unexciting brown, the blue enamel of her\r\neyes assumed the aspect of cheap crockery--moreover, and, most of all,\r\nshe had become too settled in her ways, too placid, too content, too\r\nanaemic in her excitements, and too sober in her taste. As a bride it\r\nhad been she who had \xe2\x80\x9cdragged\xe2\x80\x9d Benjamin to dances and dinners--now\r\nconditions were reversed. She went out socially with him, but without\r\nenthusiasm, devoured already by that eternal inertia which comes to\r\nlive with each of us one day and stays with us to the end.\r\n\r\nBenjamin\xe2\x80\x99s discontent waxed stronger. At the outbreak of the\r\nSpanish-American War in 1898 his home had for him so little charm that\r\nhe decided to join the army. With his business influence he obtained a\r\ncommission as captain, and proved so adaptable to the work that he was\r\nmade a major, and finally a lieutenant-colonel just in time to\r\nparticipate in the celebrated charge up San Juan Hill. He was slightly\r\nwounded, and received a medal.\r\n\r\nBenjamin had become so attached to the activity and excitement of\r\narray life that he regretted to give it up, but his business required\r\nattention, so he resigned his commission and came home. He was met at\r\nthe station by a brass band and escorted to his house.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nHildegarde, waving a large silk flag, greeted him on the porch, and\r\neven as he kissed her he felt with a sinking of the heart that these\r\nthree years had taken their toll. She was a woman of forty now, with a\r\nfaint skirmish line of gray hairs in her head. The sight depressed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nUp in his room he saw his reflection in the familiar mirror--he went\r\ncloser and examined his own face with anxiety, comparing it after a\r\nmoment with a photograph of himself in uniform taken just before the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud. The process was continuing. There was no\r\ndoubt of it--he looked now like a man of thirty. Instead of being\r\ndelighted, he was uneasy--he was growing younger. He had hitherto\r\nhoped that once he reached a bodily age equivalent to his age in\r\nyears, the grotesque phenomenon which had marked his birth would cease\r\nto function. He shuddered. His destiny seemed to him awful,\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\nWhen he came downstairs Hildegarde was waiting for him. She appeared\r\nannoyed, and he wondered if she had at last discovered that there was\r\nsomething amiss. It was with an effort to relieve the tension between\r\nthem that he broached the matter at dinner in what he considered a\r\ndelicate way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked lightly, \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody says I look younger than\r\never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHildegarde regarded him with scorn. She sniffed. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanything to boast about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not boasting,\xe2\x80\x9d he asserted uncomfortably. She sniffed again. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nidea,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and after a moment: \xe2\x80\x9cI should think you\xe2\x80\x99d have enough\r\npride to stop it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to argue with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s a right\r\nway of doing things and a wrong way. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve made up your mind to be\r\ndifferent from everybody else, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I can stop you, but I\r\nreally don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s very considerate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Hildegarde, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can too. You\xe2\x80\x99re simply stubborn. You think you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be\r\nlike any one else. You always have been that way, and you always will\r\nbe. But just think how it would be if every one else looked at things\r\nas you do--what would the world be like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs this was an inane and unanswerable argument Benjamin made no reply,\r\nand from that time on a chasm began to widen between them. He wondered\r\nwhat possible fascination she had ever exercised over him.\r\n\r\nTo add to the breach, he found, as the new century gathered headway,\r\nthat his thirst for gaiety grew stronger. Never a party of any kind in\r\nthe city of Baltimore but he was there, dancing with the prettiest of\r\nthe young married women, chatting with the most popular of the\r\nd\xc3\xa9butantes, and finding their company charming, while his wife, a\r\ndowager of evil omen, sat among the chaperons, now in haughty\r\ndisapproval, and now following him with solemn, puzzled, and\r\nreproachful eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d people would remark. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity! A young fellow that age\r\ntied to a woman of forty-five. He must be twenty years younger than\r\nhis wife.\xe2\x80\x9d They had forgotten--as people inevitably forget--that back\r\nin 1880 their mammas and papas had also remarked about this same\r\nill-matched pair.\r\n\r\nBenjamin\xe2\x80\x99s growing unhappiness at home was compensated for by his many\r\nnew interests. He took up golf and made a great success of it. He went\r\nin for dancing: in 1906 he was an expert at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Boston,\xe2\x80\x9d and in 1908\r\nhe was considered proficient at the \xe2\x80\x9cMaxine,\xe2\x80\x9d while in 1909 his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCastle Walk\xe2\x80\x9d was the envy of every young man in town.\r\n\r\nHis social activities, of course, interfered to some extent with his\r\nbusiness, but then he had worked hard at wholesale hardware for\r\ntwenty-five years and felt that he could soon hand it on to his son,\r\nRoscoe, who had recently graduated from Harvard.\r\n\r\nHe and his son were, in fact, often mistaken for each other. This\r\npleased Benjamin--he soon forgot the insidious fear which had come\r\nover him on his return from the Spanish-American War, and grew to take\r\na na\xc3\xafve pleasure in his appearance. There was only one fly in the\r\ndelicious ointment--he hated to appear in public with his wife.\r\nHildegarde was almost fifty, and the sight of her made him feel\r\nabsurd....\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nOne September day in 1910--a few years after Roger Button & Co.,\r\nWholesale Hardware, had been handed over to young Roscoe Button--a\r\nman, apparently about twenty years old, entered himself as a freshman\r\nat Harvard University in Cambridge. He did not make the mistake of\r\nannouncing that he would never see fifty again, nor did he mention the\r\nfact that his son had been graduated from the same institution ten\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted, and almost immediately attained a prominent position\r\nin the class, partly because he seemed a little older than the other\r\nfreshmen, whose average age was about eighteen.\r\n\r\nBut his success was largely due to the fact that in the football game\r\nwith Yale he played so brilliantly, with so much dash and with such a\r\ncold, remorseless anger that he scored seven touchdowns and fourteen\r\nfield goals for Harvard, and caused one entire eleven of Yale men to\r\nbe carried singly from the field, unconscious. He was the most\r\ncelebrated man in college.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, in his third or junior year he was scarcely able to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmake\xe2\x80\x9d the team. The coaches said that he had lost weight, and it\r\nseemed to the more observant among them that he was not quite as tall\r\nas before. He made no touchdowns--indeed, he was retained on the team\r\nchiefly in hope that his enormous reputation would bring terror and\r\ndisorganisation to the Yale team.\r\n\r\nIn his senior year he did not make the team at all. He had grown so\r\nslight and frail that one day he was taken by some sophomores for a\r\nfreshman, an incident which humiliated him terribly. He became known\r\nas something of a prodigy--a senior who was surely no more than\r\nsixteen--and he was often shocked at the worldliness of some of his\r\nclassmates. His studies seemed harder to him--he felt that they were\r\ntoo advanced. He had heard his classmates speak of St. Midas\xe2\x80\x99s, the\r\nfamous preparatory school, at which so many of them had prepared for\r\ncollege, and he determined after his graduation to enter himself at\r\nSt. Midas\xe2\x80\x99s, where the sheltered life among boys his own size would be\r\nmore congenial to him.\r\n\r\nUpon his graduation in 1914 he went home to Baltimore with his Harvard\r\ndiploma in his pocket. Hildegarde was now residing in Italy, so\r\nBenjamin went to live with his son, Roscoe. But though he was welcomed\r\nin a general way there was obviously no heartiness in Roscoe\xe2\x80\x99s feeling\r\ntoward him--there was even perceptible a tendency on his son\xe2\x80\x99s part to\r\nthink that Benjamin, as he moped about the house in adolescent\r\nmooniness, was somewhat in the way. Roscoe was married now and\r\nprominent in Baltimore life, and he wanted no scandal to creep out in\r\nconnection with his family.\r\n\r\nBenjamin, no longer _persona grata_ with the d\xc3\xa9butantes and\r\nyounger college set, found himself left much alone, except for the\r\ncompanionship of three or four fifteen-year-old boys in the\r\nneighbourhood. His idea of going to St. Midas\xe2\x80\x99s school recurred to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Roscoe one day, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told you over and over that I\r\nwant to go to prep school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go, then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Roscoe shortly. The matter was distasteful\r\nto him, and he wished to avoid a discussion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Benjamin helplessly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to enter me\r\nand take me up there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t got time,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Roscoe abruptly. His eyes narrowed and\r\nhe looked uneasily at his father. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a matter of fact,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d better not go on with this business much longer. You better\r\npull up short. You better--you better\xe2\x80\x9d--he paused and his face\r\ncrimsoned as he sought for words--\xe2\x80\x9cyou better turn right around and\r\nstart back the other way. This has gone too far to be a joke. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfunny any longer. You--you behave yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBenjamin looked at him, on the verge of tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd another thing,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Roscoe, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen visitors are in the house\r\nI want you to call me \xe2\x80\x98Uncle\xe2\x80\x99--not \xe2\x80\x98Roscoe,\xe2\x80\x99 but \xe2\x80\x98Uncle,\xe2\x80\x99 do you\r\nunderstand? It looks absurd for a boy of fifteen to call me by my\r\nfirst name. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d better call me \xe2\x80\x98Uncle\xe2\x80\x99 _all_ the time,\r\nso you\xe2\x80\x99ll get used to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a harsh look at his father, Roscoe turned away....\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nAt the termination of this interview, Benjamin wandered dismally\r\nupstairs and stared at himself in the mirror. He had not shaved for\r\nthree months, but he could find nothing on his face but a faint white\r\ndown with which it seemed unnecessary to meddle. When he had first\r\ncome home from Harvard, Roscoe had approached him with the proposition\r\nthat he should wear eye-glasses and imitation whiskers glued to his\r\ncheeks, and it had seemed for a moment that the farce of his early\r\nyears was to be repeated. But whiskers had itched and made him\r\nashamed. He wept and Roscoe had reluctantly relented.\r\n\r\nBenjamin opened a book of boys\xe2\x80\x99 stories, _The Boy Scouts in Bimini\r\nBay_, and began to read. But he found himself thinking persistently\r\nabout the war. America had joined the Allied cause during the\r\npreceding month, and Benjamin wanted to enlist, but, alas, sixteen was\r\nthe minimum age, and he did not look that old. His true age, which was\r\nfifty-seven, would have disqualified him, anyway.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at his door, and the butler appeared with a letter\r\nbearing a large official legend in the corner and addressed to Mr.\r\nBenjamin Button. Benjamin tore it open eagerly, and read the enclosure\r\nwith delight. It informed him that many reserve officers who had\r\nserved in the Spanish-American War were being called back into service\r\nwith a higher rank, and it enclosed his commission as brigadier-general\r\nin the United States army with orders to report immediately.\r\n\r\nBenjamin jumped to his feet fairly quivering with enthusiasm. This was\r\nwhat he had wanted. He seized his cap, and ten minutes later he had\r\nentered a large tailoring establishment on Charles Street, and asked\r\nin his uncertain treble to be measured for a uniform.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant to play soldier, sonny?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded a clerk casually.\r\n\r\nBenjamin flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cSay! Never mind what I want!\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted angrily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Button and I live on Mt. Vernon Place, so you know I\xe2\x80\x99m good\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted the clerk hesitantly, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99re not, I guess your\r\ndaddy is, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBenjamin was measured, and a week later his uniform was completed. He\r\nhad difficulty in obtaining the proper general\xe2\x80\x99s insignia because the\r\ndealer kept insisting to Benjamin that a nice V.W.C.A. badge would\r\nlook just as well and be much more fun to play with.\r\n\r\nSaying nothing to Roscoe, he left the house one night and proceeded by\r\ntrain to Camp Mosby, in South Carolina, where he was to command an\r\ninfantry brigade. On a sultry April day he approached the entrance to\r\nthe camp, paid off the taxicab which had brought him from the station,\r\nand turned to the sentry on guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet some one to handle my luggage!\xe2\x80\x9d he said briskly.\r\n\r\nThe sentry eyed him reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cSay,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere you\r\ngoin\xe2\x80\x99 with the general\xe2\x80\x99s duds, sonny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBenjamin, veteran of the Spanish-American War, whirled upon him with\r\nfire in his eye, but with, alas, a changing treble voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to attention!\xe2\x80\x9d he tried to thunder; he paused for breath--then\r\nsuddenly he saw the sentry snap his heels together and bring his rifle\r\nto the present. Benjamin concealed a smile of gratification, but when\r\nhe glanced around his smile faded. It was not he who had inspired\r\nobedience, but an imposing artillery colonel who was approaching on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel!\xe2\x80\x9d called Benjamin shrilly.\r\n\r\nThe colonel came up, drew rein, and looked coolly down at him with a\r\ntwinkle in his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhose little boy are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll soon darn well show you whose little boy I am!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted\r\nBenjamin in a ferocious voice. \xe2\x80\x9cGet down off that horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colonel roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want him, eh, general?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Benjamin desperately. \xe2\x80\x9cRead this.\xe2\x80\x9d And he thrust his\r\ncommission toward the colonel.\r\n\r\nThe colonel read it, his eyes popping from their sockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99d you get this?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded, slipping the\r\ndocument into his own pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got it from the Government, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsoon find out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come along with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the colonel with a\r\npeculiar look. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go up to headquarters and talk this over. Come\r\nalong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colonel turned and began walking his horse in the\r\ndirection of headquarters. There was nothing for Benjamin to do but\r\nfollow with as much dignity as possible--meanwhile promising himself a\r\nstern revenge.\r\n\r\nBut this revenge did not materialise. Two days later,\r\nhowever, his son Roscoe materialised from Baltimore, hot and cross\r\nfrom a hasty trip, and escorted the weeping general, _sans_\r\nuniform, back to his home.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nIn 1920 Roscoe Button\xe2\x80\x99s first child was born. During the attendant\r\nfestivities, however, no one thought it \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing\xe2\x80\x9d to mention, that\r\nthe little grubby boy, apparently about ten years of age who played\r\naround the house with lead soldiers and a miniature circus, was the\r\nnew baby\xe2\x80\x99s own grandfather.\r\n\r\nNo one disliked the little boy whose fresh, cheerful face was crossed\r\nwith just a hint of sadness, but to Roscoe Button his presence was a\r\nsource of torment. In the idiom of his generation Roscoe did not\r\nconsider the matter \xe2\x80\x9cefficient.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed to him that his father, in\r\nrefusing to look sixty, had not behaved like a \xe2\x80\x9cred-blooded\r\nhe-man\xe2\x80\x9d--this was Roscoe\xe2\x80\x99s favourite expression--but in a curious and\r\nperverse manner. Indeed, to think about the matter for as much as a\r\nhalf an hour drove him to the edge of insanity. Roscoe believed that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clive wires\xe2\x80\x9d should keep young, but carrying it out on such a scale\r\nwas--was--was inefficient. And there Roscoe rested.\r\n\r\nFive years later Roscoe\xe2\x80\x99s little boy had grown old enough to play\r\nchildish games with little Benjamin under the supervision of the same\r\nnurse. Roscoe took them both to kindergarten on the same day, and\r\nBenjamin found that playing with little strips of coloured paper,\r\nmaking mats and chains and curious and beautiful designs, was the most\r\nfascinating game in the world. Once he was bad and had to stand in the\r\ncorner--then he cried--but for the most part there were gay hours in\r\nthe cheerful room, with the sunlight coming in the windows and Miss\r\nBailey\xe2\x80\x99s kind hand resting for a moment now and then in his tousled\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nRoscoe\xe2\x80\x99s son moved up into the first grade after a year, but Benjamin\r\nstayed on in the kindergarten. He was very happy. Sometimes when other\r\ntots talked about what they would do when they grew up a shadow would\r\ncross his little face as if in a dim, childish way he realised that\r\nthose were things in which he was never to share.\r\n\r\nThe days flowed on in monotonous content. He went back a third year to\r\nthe kindergarten, but he was too little now to understand what the\r\nbright shining strips of paper were for. He cried because the other\r\nboys were bigger than he, and he was afraid of them. The teacher\r\ntalked to him, but though he tried to understand he could not\r\nunderstand at all.\r\n\r\nHe was taken from the kindergarten. His nurse, Nana, in her starched\r\ngingham dress, became the centre of his tiny world. On bright days\r\nthey walked in the park; Nana would point at a great gray monster and\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9celephant,\xe2\x80\x9d and Benjamin would say it after her, and when he was\r\nbeing undressed for bed that night he would say it over and over aloud\r\nto her: \xe2\x80\x9cElyphant, elyphant, elyphant.\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes Nana let him jump on\r\nthe bed, which was fun, because if you sat down exactly right it would\r\nbounce you up on your feet again, and if you said \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x9d for a long time\r\nwhile you jumped you got a very pleasing broken vocal effect.\r\n\r\nHe loved to take a big cane from the hat-rack and go around hitting\r\nchairs and tables with it and saying: \xe2\x80\x9cFight, fight, fight.\xe2\x80\x9d When\r\nthere were people there the old ladies would cluck at him, which\r\ninterested him, and the young ladies would try to kiss him, which he\r\nsubmitted to with mild boredom. And when the long day was done at five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock he would go upstairs with Nana and be fed on oatmeal and nice\r\nsoft mushy foods with a spoon.\r\n\r\nThere were no troublesome memories in his childish sleep; no token\r\ncame to him of his brave days at college, of the glittering years when\r\nhe flustered the hearts of many girls. There were only the white, safe\r\nwalls of his crib and Nana and a man who came to see him sometimes,\r\nand a great big orange ball that Nana pointed at just before his\r\ntwilight bed hour and called \xe2\x80\x9csun.\xe2\x80\x9d When the sun went his eyes were\r\nsleepy--there were no dreams, no dreams to haunt him.\r\n\r\nThe past--the wild charge at the head of his men up San Juan Hill; the\r\nfirst years of his marriage when he worked late into the summer dusk\r\ndown in the busy city for young Hildegarde whom he loved; the days\r\nbefore that when he sat smoking far into the night in the gloomy old\r\nButton house on Monroe Street with his grandfather-all these had faded\r\nlike unsubstantial dreams from his mind as though they had never been.\r\nHe did not remember.\r\n\r\nHe did not remember clearly whether the milk was warm or cool at his\r\nlast feeding or how the days passed--there was only his crib and\r\nNana\xe2\x80\x99s familiar presence. And then he remembered nothing. When he was\r\nhungry he cried--that was all. Through the noons and nights he\r\nbreathed and over him there were soft mumblings and murmurings that he\r\nscarcely heard, and faintly differentiated smells, and light and\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThen it was all dark, and his white crib and the dim faces that moved\r\nabove him, and the warm sweet aroma of the milk, faded out altogether\r\nfrom his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTARQUIN OF CHEAPSIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning footsteps--light, soft-soled shoes made of curious leathery\r\ncloth brought from Ceylon setting the pace; thick flowing boots, two\r\npairs, dark blue and gilt, reflecting the moonlight in blunt gleams\r\nand splotches, following a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw behind.\r\n\r\nSoft Shoes flashes through a patch of moonlight, then darts into a\r\nblind labyrinth of alleys and becomes only an intermittent scuffle\r\nahead somewhere in the enfolding darkness. In go Flowing Boots, with\r\nshort swords lurching and long plumes awry, finding a breath to curse\r\nGod and the black lanes of London.\r\n\r\nSoft Shoes leaps a shadowy gate and crackles through a hedgerow.\r\nFlowing Boots leap the gate and crackles through the hedgerow--and\r\nthere, startlingly, is the watch ahead--two murderous pikemen of\r\nferocious cast of mouth acquired in Holland and the Spanish marches.\r\n\r\nBut there is no cry for help. The pursued does not fall panting at the\r\nfeet of the watch, clutching a purse; neither do the pursuers raise a\r\nhue and cry. Soft Shoes goes by in a rush of swift air. The watch\r\ncurse and hesitate, glance after the fugitive, and then spread their\r\npikes grimly across the road and wait for Flowing Boots. Darkness,\r\nlike a great hand, cuts off the even flow the moon.\r\n\r\nThe hand moves off the moon whose pale caress finds again the eaves\r\nand lintels, and the watch, wounded and tumbled in the dust. Up the\r\nstreet one of Flowing Boots leaves a black trail of spots until he\r\nbinds himself, clumsily as he runs, with fine lace caught from his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nIt was no affair for the watch: Satan was at large tonight and Satan\r\nseemed to be he who appeared dimly in front, heel over gate, knee over\r\nfence. Moreover, the adversary was obviously travelling near home or\r\nat least in that section of London consecrated to his coarser whims,\r\nfor the street narrowed like a road in a picture and the houses bent\r\nover further and further, cooping in natural ambushes suitable for\r\nmurder and its histrionic sister, sudden death.\r\n\r\nDown long and sinuous lanes twisted the hunted and the harriers,\r\nalways in and out of the moon in a perpetual queen\xe2\x80\x99s move over a\r\nchecker-board of glints and patches. Ahead, the quarry, minus his\r\nleather jerkin now and half blinded by drips of sweat, had taken to\r\nscanning his ground desperately on both sides. As a result he suddenly\r\nslowed short, and retracing his steps a bit scooted up an alley so\r\ndark that it seemed that here sun and moon had been in eclipse since\r\nthe last glacier slipped roaring over the earth. Two hundred yards\r\ndown he stopped and crammed himself into a niche in the wall where he\r\nhuddled and panted silently, a grotesque god without bulk or outline\r\nin the gloom.\r\n\r\nFlowing Boots, two pairs, drew near, came up, went by, halted twenty\r\nyards beyond him, and spoke in deep-lunged, scanty whispers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was attune to that scuffle; it stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithin twenty paces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s hid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay together now and we\xe2\x80\x99ll cut him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice faded into a low crunch of a boot, nor did Soft Shoes wait\r\nto hear more--he sprang in three leaps across the alley, where he\r\nbounded up, flapped for a moment on the top of the wall like a huge\r\nbird, and disappeared, gulped down by the hungry night at a mouthful.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9c_He read at wine, he read in bed,\r\n     He read aloud, had he the breath,\r\n   His every thought was with the dead,\r\n     And so he read himself to death._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAny visitor to the old James the First graveyard near Peat\xe2\x80\x99s Hill may\r\nspell out this bit of doggerel, undoubtedly one of the worst recorded\r\nof an Elizabethan, on the tomb of Wessel Caster.\r\n\r\nThis death of his, says the antiquary, occurred when he was\r\nthirty-seven, but as this story is concerned with the night of a\r\ncertain chase through darkness, we find him still alive, still\r\nreading. His eyes were somewhat dim, his stomach somewhat obvious--he\r\nwas a mis-built man and indolent--oh, Heavens! But an era is an era,\r\nand in the reign of Elizabeth, by the grace of Luther, Queen of\r\nEngland, no man could help but catch the spirit of enthusiasm. Every\r\nloft in Cheapside published its _Magnum Folium_ (or magazine)--of\r\nits new blank verse; the Cheapside Players would produce anything on\r\nsight as long as it \xe2\x80\x9cgot away from those reactionary miracle plays,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand the English Bible had run through seven \xe2\x80\x9cvery large\xe2\x80\x9d printings in\r\nas many months.\r\n\r\nSo Wessel Caxter (who in his youth had gone to sea) was now a reader\r\nof all on which he could lay his hands--he read manuscripts in holy\r\nfriendship; he dined rotten poets; he loitered about the shops where\r\nthe _Magna Folia_ were printed, and he listened tolerantly while\r\nthe young playwrights wrangled and bickered among them-selves, and\r\nbehind each other\xe2\x80\x99s backs made bitter and malicious charges of\r\nplagiarism or anything else they could think of.\r\n\r\nTo-night he had a book, a piece of work which, though inordinately\r\nversed, contained, he thought, some rather excellent political satire.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Faerie Queene\xe2\x80\x9d by Edmund Spenser lay before him under the\r\ntremulous candle-light. He had ploughed through a canto; he was\r\nbeginning another:\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF BRITOMARTIS OR OF CHASTITY\r\n\r\n   _It falls me here to write of Chastity.\r\n   The fayrest vertue, far above the rest_....\r\n\r\nA sudden rush of feet on the stairs, a rusty swing-open of the thin\r\ndoor, and a man thrust himself into the room, a man without a jerkin,\r\npanting, sobbing, on the verge of collapse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWessel,\xe2\x80\x9d words choked him, \xe2\x80\x9cstick me away somewhere, love of Our\r\nLady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaxter rose, carefully closing his book, and bolted the door in some\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pursued,\xe2\x80\x9d cried out Soft Shoes. \xe2\x80\x9cI vow there\xe2\x80\x99s two short-witted\r\nblades trying to make me into mincemeat and near succeeding. They saw\r\nme hop the back wall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would need,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wessel, looking at him curiously, \xe2\x80\x9cseveral\r\nbattalions armed with blunderbusses, and two or three Armadas, to keep\r\nyou reasonably secure from the revenges of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoft Shoes smiled with satisfaction. His sobbing gasps were giving way\r\nto quick, precise breathing; his hunted air had faded to a faintly\r\nperturbed irony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel little surprise,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Wessel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were two such dreary apes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaking a total of three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly two unless you stick me away. Man, man, come alive, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\non the stairs in a spark\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWessel took a dismantled pike-staff from the corner, and raising it to\r\nthe high ceiling, dislodged a rough trap-door opening into a garret\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved a bench under the trap, upon which Soft Shoes mounted,\r\ncrouched, hesitated, crouched again, and then leaped amazingly upward.\r\nHe caught at the edge of the aperture and swung back and forth, for a\r\nmoment, shifting his hold; finally doubled up and disappeared into the\r\ndarkness above. There was a scurry, a migration of rats, as the\r\ntrap-door was replaced;... silence.\r\n\r\nWessel returned to his reading-table, opened to the Legend of\r\nBritomartis or of Chastity--and waited. Almost a minute later there\r\nwas a scramble on the stairs and an intolerable hammering at the door.\r\nWessel sighed and, picking up his candle, rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn aching blow frightened the frail wood, splintered it around the\r\nedge. Wessel opened it a scarce three inches, and held the candle\r\nhigh. His was to play the timorous, the super-respectable citizen,\r\ndisgracefully disturbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne small hour of the night for rest. Is that too much to ask from\r\nevery brawler and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet, gossip! Have you seen a perspiring fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shadows of two gallants fell in immense wavering outlines over the\r\nnarrow stairs; by the light Wessel scrutinized them closely.\r\nGentlemen, they were, hastily but richly dressed--one of them wounded\r\nseverely in the hand, both radiating a sort of furious horror. Waving\r\naside Wessel\xe2\x80\x99s ready miscomprehension, they pushed by him into the\r\nroom and with their swords went through the business of poking\r\ncarefully into all suspected dark spots in the room, further extending\r\ntheir search to Wessel\xe2\x80\x99s bedchamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he hid here?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the wounded man fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs who here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny man but you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly two others that I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a second Wessel feared that he had been too damned funny, for the\r\ngallants made as though to prick him through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard a man on the stairs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cfull five minutes\r\nago, it was. He most certainly failed to come up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went on to explain his absorption in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Faerie Queene\xe2\x80\x9d but, for\r\nthe moment at least, his visitors, like the great saints, were\r\nanaesthetic to culture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s been done?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Wessel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cViolence!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man with the wounded hand. Wessel noticed that\r\nhis eyes were quite wild. \xe2\x80\x9cMy own sister. Oh, Christ in heaven, give\r\nus this man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWessel winced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s word! We know not even that. What\xe2\x80\x99s that trap up there?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nailed down. It\xe2\x80\x99s not been used for years.\xe2\x80\x9d He thought of the\r\npole in the corner and quailed in his belly, but the utter despair of\r\nthe two men dulled their astuteness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would take a ladder for any one not a tumbler,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wounded\r\nman listlessly.\r\n\r\nHis companion broke into hysterical laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tumbler. Oh, a tumbler. Oh--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWessel stared at them in wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat appeals to my most tragic humor,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the man, \xe2\x80\x9cthat no\r\none--oh, no one--could get up there but a tumbler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gallant with the wounded hand snapped his good fingers\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must go next door--and then on--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelplessly they went as two walking under a dark and storm-swept sky.\r\n\r\nWessel closed and bolted the door and stood a moment by it, frowning\r\nin pity.\r\n\r\nA low-breathed \xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d made him look up. Soft Shoes had already raised\r\nthe trap and was looking down into the room, his rather elfish face\r\nsqueezed into a grimace, half of distaste, half of sardonic amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey take off their heads with their helmets,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked in a\r\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x9cbut as for you and me, Wessel, we are two cunning men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you be cursed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wessel vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you for a dog,\r\nbut when I hear even the half of a tale like this, I know you for such\r\na dirty cur that I am minded to club your skull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoft Shoes stared at him, blinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied finally, \xe2\x80\x9cI find dignity impossible in\r\nthis position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this he let his body through the trap, hung for an instant, and\r\ndropped the seven feet to the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a rat considered my ear with the air of a gourmet,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, dusting his hands on his breeches. \xe2\x80\x9cI told him in the rat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npeculiar idiom that I was deadly poison, so he took himself off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hear of this night\xe2\x80\x99s lechery!\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Wessel angrily.\r\n\r\nSoft Shoes touched his thumb to his nose and wiggled the fingers\r\nderisively at Wessel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStreet gamin!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Wessel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any paper?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Soft Shoes irrelevantly, and then\r\nrudely added, \xe2\x80\x9cor can you write?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I give you paper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted to hear of the night\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment. So you shall, an you\r\ngive me pen, ink, a sheaf of paper, and a room to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWessel hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out!\xe2\x80\x9d he said finally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you will. Yet you have missed a most intriguing story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWessel wavered--he was soft as taffy, that man--gave in. Soft Shoes\r\nwent into the adjoining room with the begrudged writing materials and\r\nprecisely closed the door. Wessel grunted and returned to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Faerie\r\nQueene\xe2\x80\x9d; so silence came once more upon the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThree o\xe2\x80\x99clock went into four. The room paled, the dark outside was\r\nshot through with damp and chill, and Wessel, cupping his brain in his\r\nhands, bent low over his table, tracing through the pattern of knights\r\nand fairies and the harrowing distresses of many girls. There were\r\ndragons chortling along the narrow street outside; when the sleepy\r\narmorer\xe2\x80\x99s boy began his work at half-past five the heavy clink and\r\nclank of plate and linked mail swelled to the echo of a marching\r\ncavalcade.\r\n\r\nA fog shut down at the first flare of dawn, and the room was grayish\r\nyellow at six when Wessel tiptoed to his cupboard bedchamber and\r\npulled open the door. His guest turned on him a face pale as parchment\r\nin which two distraught eyes burned like great red letters. He had\r\ndrawn a chair close to Wessel\xe2\x80\x99s _prie-dieu_ which he was using as\r\na desk; and on it was an amazing stack of closely written pages. With\r\na long sigh Wessel withdrew and returned to his siren, calling himself\r\nfool for not claiming his bed here at dawn.\r\n\r\nThe clump of boots outside, the croaking of old beldames from attic to\r\nattic, the dull murmur of morning, unnerved him, and, dozing, he\r\nslumped in his chair, his brain, overladen with sound and color,\r\nworking intolerably over the imagery that stacked it. In this restless\r\ndream of his he was one of a thousand groaning bodies crushed near the\r\nsun, a helpless bridge for the strong-eyed Apollo. The dream tore at\r\nhim, scraped along his mind like a ragged knife. When a hot hand\r\ntouched his shoulder, he awoke with what was nearly a scream to find\r\nthe fog thick in the room and his guest, a gray ghost of misty stuff,\r\nbeside him with a pile of paper in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt should be a most intriguing tale, I believe, though it requires\r\nsome going over. May I ask you to lock it away, and in God\xe2\x80\x99s name let\r\nme sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited for no answer, but thrust the pile at Wessel, and literally\r\npoured himself like stuff from a suddenly inverted bottle upon a couch\r\nin the corner; slept, with his breathing regular, but his brow\r\nwrinkled in a curious and somewhat uncanny manner.\r\n\r\nWessel yawned sleepily and, glancing at the scrawled, uncertain first\r\npage, he began reading aloud very softly:\r\n\r\n   _The Rape of Lucrece_\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x9c_From the besieged Ardea all in post,\r\n   Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,\r\n   Lust-breathing Tarquin leaves the Roman host--_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO RUSSET WITCH!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMerlin Grainger was employed by the Moonlight Quill Bookshop, which\r\nyou may have visited, just around the corner from the Ritz-Carlton on\r\nForty-seventh Street. The Moonlight Quill is, or rather was, a very\r\nromantic little store, considered radical and admitted dark. It was\r\nspotted interiorly with red and orange posters of breathless exotic\r\nintent, and lit no less by the shiny reflecting bindings of special\r\neditions than by the great squat lamp of crimson satin that, lighted\r\nthrough all the day, swung overhead. It was truly a mellow bookshop.\r\nThe words \xe2\x80\x9cMoonlight Quill\xe2\x80\x9d were worked over the door in a sort of\r\nserpentine embroidery. The windows seemed always full of something\r\nthat had passed the literary censors with little to spare; volumes\r\nwith covers of deep orange which offer their titles on little white\r\npaper squares. And over all there was the smell of the musk, which the\r\nclever, inscrutable Mr. Moonlight Quill ordered to be sprinkled\r\nabout--the smell half of a curiosity shop in Dickens\xe2\x80\x99 London and half\r\nof a coffee-house on the warm shores of the Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nFrom nine until five-thirty Merlin Grainger asked bored old ladies in\r\nblack and young men with dark circles under their eyes if they \xe2\x80\x9ccared\r\nfor this fellow\xe2\x80\x9d or were interested in first editions. Did they buy\r\nnovels with Arabs on the cover, or books which gave Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnewest sonnets as dictated psychically to Miss Sutton of South Dakota?\r\nhe sniffed. As a matter of fact, his own taste ran to these latter,\r\nbut as an employee at the Moonlight Quill he assumed for the working\r\nday the attitude of a disillusioned connoisseur.\r\n\r\nAfter he had crawled over the window display to pull down the front\r\nshade at five-thirty every afternoon, and said good-bye to the\r\nmysterious Mr. Moonlight Quill and the lady clerk, Miss McCracken, and\r\nthe lady stenographer, Miss Masters, he went home to the girl,\r\nCaroline. He did not eat supper with Caroline. It is unbelievable that\r\nCaroline would have considered eating off his bureau with the collar\r\nbuttons dangerously near the cottage cheese, and the ends of Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnecktie just missing his glass of milk--he had never asked her to eat\r\nwith him. He ate alone. He went into Braegdort\xe2\x80\x99s delicatessen on Sixth\r\nAvenue and bought a box of crackers, a tube of anchovy paste, and some\r\noranges, or else a little jar of sausages and some potato salad and a\r\nbottled soft drink, and with these in a brown package he went to his\r\nroom at Fifty-something West Fifty-eighth Street and ate his supper\r\nand saw Caroline.\r\n\r\nCaroline was a very young and gay person who lived with some older\r\nlady and was possibly nineteen. She was like a ghost in that she never\r\nexisted until evening. She sprang into life when the lights went on in\r\nher apartment at about six, and she disappeared, at the latest, about\r\nmidnight. Her apartment was a nice one, in a nice building with a\r\nwhite stone front, opposite the south side of Central Park. The back\r\nof her apartment faced the single window of the single room occupied\r\nby the single Mr. Grainger.\r\n\r\nHe called her Caroline because there was a picture that looked like\r\nher on the jacket of a book of that name down at the Moonlight Quill.\r\n\r\nNow, Merlin Grainger was a thin young man of twenty-five, with dark\r\nhair and no mustache or beard or anything like that, but Caroline was\r\ndazzling and light, with a shimmering morass of russet waves to take\r\nthe place of hair, and the sort of features that remind you of\r\nkisses--the sort of features you thought belonged to your first love,\r\nbut know, when you come across an old picture, didn\xe2\x80\x99t. She dressed in\r\npink or blue usually, but of late she had sometimes put on a slender\r\nblack gown that was evidently her especial pride, for whenever she\r\nwore it she would stand regarding a certain place on the wall, which\r\nMerlin thought must be a mirror. She sat usually in the profile chair\r\nnear the window, but sometimes honored the _chaise longue_ by the\r\nlamp, and often she leaned \xe2\x80\x99way back and smoked a cigarette with\r\nposturings of her arms and hands that Merlin considered very graceful.\r\n\r\nAt another time she had come to the window and stood in it\r\nmagnificently, and looked out because the moon had lost its way and\r\nwas dripping the strangest and most transforming brilliance into the\r\nareaway between, turning the motif of ash-cans and clothes-lines into\r\na vivid impressionism of silver casks and gigantic gossamer cobwebs.\r\nMerlin was sitting in plain sight, eating cottage cheese with sugar\r\nand milk on it; and so quickly did he reach out for the window cord\r\nthat he tipped the cottage cheese into his lap with his free hand--and\r\nthe milk was cold and the sugar made spots on his trousers, and he was\r\nsure that she had seen him after all.\r\n\r\nSometimes there were callers--men in dinner coats, who stood and\r\nbowed, hat in hand and coat on arm, as they talked to Caroline; then\r\nbowed some more and followed her out of the light, obviously bound for\r\na play or for a dance. Other young men came and sat and smoked\r\ncigarettes, and seemed trying to tell Caroline something--she sitting\r\neither in the profile chair and watching them with eager intentness or\r\nelse in the _chaise longue_ by the lamp, looking very lovely and\r\nyouthfully inscrutable indeed.\r\n\r\nMerlin enjoyed these calls. Of some of the men he approved. Others won\r\nonly his grudging toleration, one or two he loathed--especially the\r\nmost frequent caller, a man with black hair and a black goatee and a\r\npitch-dark soul, who seemed to Merlin vaguely familiar, but whom he\r\nwas never quite able to recognize.\r\n\r\nNow, Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s whole life was not \xe2\x80\x9cbound up with this romance he had\r\nconstructed\xe2\x80\x9d; it was not \xe2\x80\x9cthe happiest hour of his day.\xe2\x80\x9d He never\r\narrived in time to rescue Caroline from \xe2\x80\x9cclutches\xe2\x80\x9d; nor did he even\r\nmarry her. A much stranger thing happened than any of these, and it is\r\nthis strange thing that will presently be set down here. It began one\r\nOctober afternoon when she walked briskly into the mellow interior of\r\nthe Moonlight Quill.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark afternoon, threatening rain and the end of the world,\r\nand done in that particularly gloomy gray in which only New York\r\nafternoons indulge. A breeze was crying down the streets, whisking\r\nalong battered newspapers and pieces of things, and little lights were\r\npricking out all the windows--it was so desolate that one was sorry\r\nfor the tops of sky-scrapers lost up there in the dark green and gray\r\nheaven, and felt that now surely the farce was to close, and presently\r\nall the buildings would collapse like card houses, and pile up in a\r\ndusty, sardonic heap upon all the millions who presumed to wind in and\r\nout of them.\r\n\r\nAt least these were the sort of musings that lay heavily upon the soul\r\nof Merlin Grainger, as he stood by the window putting a dozen books\r\nback in a row after a cyclonic visit by a lady with ermine trimmings.\r\nHe looked out of the window full of the most distressing thoughts--of\r\nthe early novels of H. G. Wells, of the book of Genesis, of how Thomas\r\nEdison had said that in thirty years there would be no dwelling-houses\r\nupon the island, but only a vast and turbulent bazaar; and then he set\r\nthe last book right side up, turned--and Caroline walked coolly into\r\nthe shop.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in a jaunty but conventional walking costume--he\r\nremembered this when he thought about it later. Her skirt was plaid,\r\npleated like a concertina; her jacket was a soft but brisk tan; her\r\nshoes and spats were brown and her hat, small and trim, completed her\r\nlike the top of a very expensive and beautifully filled candy box.\r\n\r\nMerlin, breathless and startled, advanced nervously toward her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-afternoon--\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and then stopped--why, he did not know,\r\nexcept that it came to him that something very portentous in his life\r\nwas about to occur, and that it would need no furbishing but silence,\r\nand the proper amount of expectant attention. And in that minute\r\nbefore the thing began to happen he had the sense of a breathless\r\nsecond hanging suspended in time: he saw through the glass partition\r\nthat bounded off the little office the malevolent conical head of his\r\nemployer, Mr. Moonlight Quill, bent over his correspondence. He saw\r\nMiss McCracken and Miss Masters as two patches of hair drooping over\r\npiles of paper; he saw the crimson lamp overhead, and noticed with a\r\ntouch of pleasure how really pleasant and romantic it made the\r\nbook-store seem.\r\n\r\nThen the thing happened, or rather it began to happen. Caroline picked\r\nup a volume of poems lying loose upon a pile, fingered it absently\r\nwith her slender white hand, and suddenly, with an easy gesture,\r\ntossed it upward toward the ceiling where it disappeared in the\r\ncrimson lamp and lodged there, seen through the illuminated silk as a\r\ndark, bulging rectangle. This pleased her--she broke into young,\r\ncontagious laughter, in which Merlin found himself presently joining.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt stayed up!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried merrily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt stayed up, didn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d To both\r\nof them this seemed the height of brilliant absurdity. Their laughter\r\nmingled, filled the bookshop, and Merlin was glad to find that her\r\nvoice was rich and full of sorcery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry another,\xe2\x80\x9d he found himself suggesting--\xe2\x80\x9ctry a red one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this her laughter increased, and she had to rest her hands upon the\r\nstack to steady herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry another,\xe2\x80\x9d she managed to articulate between spasms of mirth. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\ngolly, try another!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, try two. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll choke if I don\xe2\x80\x99t stop laughing. Here it goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuiting her action to the word, she picked up a red book and sent it\r\nin a gentle hyperbola toward the ceiling, where it sank into the lamp\r\nbeside the first. It was a few minutes before either of them could do\r\nmore than rock back and forth in helpless glee; but then by mutual\r\nagreement they took up the sport anew, this time in unison. Merlin\r\nseized a large, specially bound French classic and whirled it upward.\r\nApplauding his own accuracy, he took a best-seller in one hand and a\r\nbook on barnacles in the other, and waited breathlessly while she made\r\nher shot. Then the business waxed fast and furious--sometimes they\r\nalternated, and, watching, he found how supple she was in every\r\nmovement; sometimes one of them made shot after shot, picking up the\r\nnearest book, sending it off, merely taking time to follow it with a\r\nglance before reaching for another. Within three minutes they had\r\ncleared a little place on the table, and the lamp of crimson satin was\r\nso bulging with books that it was near breaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilly game, basket-ball,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried scornfully as a book left her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cHigh-school girls play it in hideous bloomers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIdiotic,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed.\r\n\r\nShe paused in the act of tossing a book, and replaced it suddenly in\r\nits position on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got room to sit down now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gravely.\r\n\r\nThey had; they had cleared an ample space for two. With a faint touch\r\nof nervousness Merlin glanced toward Mr. Moonlight Quill\xe2\x80\x99s glass\r\npartition, but the three heads were still bent earnestly over their\r\nwork, and it was evident that they had not seen what had gone on in\r\nthe shop. So when Caroline put her hands on the table and hoisted\r\nherself up Merlin calmly imitated her, and they sat side by side\r\nlooking very earnestly at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, with a rather pathetic expression in\r\nher brown eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was that last time,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, her voice trembling a little,\r\nthough she tried to keep it steady. \xe2\x80\x9cI was frightened. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nyou to eat off the dresser. I\xe2\x80\x99m so afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll--you\xe2\x80\x99ll swallow a\r\ncollar button.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did once--almost,\xe2\x80\x9d he confessed reluctantly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s not so easy,\r\nyou know. I mean you can swallow the flat part easy enough or else the\r\nother part--that is, separately--but for a whole collar button you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave to have a specially made throat.\xe2\x80\x9d He was astonishing himself by\r\nthe debonnaire appropriateness of his remarks. Words seemed for the\r\nfirst time in his life to run at him shrieking to be used, gathering\r\nthemselves into carefully arranged squads and platoons, and being\r\npresented to him by punctilious adjutants of paragraphs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what scared me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you had to have a specially\r\nmade throat--and I knew, at least I felt sure, that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded frankly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t. It costs money to have one--more money unfortunately than\r\nI possess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe felt no shame in saying this--rather a delight in making the\r\nadmission--he knew that nothing he could say or do would be beyond her\r\ncomprehension; least of all his poverty, and the practical\r\nimpossibility of ever extricating himself from it.\r\n\r\nCaroline looked down at her wrist watch, and with a little cry slid\r\nfrom the table to her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s after five,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize. I have to be at the\r\nRitz at five-thirty. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hurry and get this done. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bet on\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith one accord they set to work. Caroline began the matter by seizing\r\na book on insects and sending it whizzing, and finally crashing\r\nthrough the glass partition that housed Mr. Moonlight Quill. The\r\nproprietor glanced up with a wild look, brushed a few pieces of glass\r\nfrom his desk, and went on with his letters. Miss McCracken gave no\r\nsign of having heard--only Miss Masters started and gave a little\r\nfrightened scream before she bent to her task again.\r\n\r\nBut to Merlin and Caroline it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. In a perfect orgy of\r\nenergy they were hurling book after book in all directions until\r\nsometimes three or four were in the air at once, smashing against\r\nshelves, cracking the glass of pictures on the walls, falling in\r\nbruised and torn heaps upon the floor. It was fortunate that no\r\ncustomers happened to come in, for it is certain they would never have\r\ncome in again--the noise was too tremendous, a noise of smashing and\r\nripping and tearing, mixed now and then with the tinkling of glass,\r\nthe quick breathing of the two throwers, and the intermittent\r\noutbursts of laughter to which both of them periodically surrendered.\r\n\r\nAt five-thirty Caroline tossed a last book at the lamp, and gave the\r\nfinal impetus to the load it carried. The weakened silk tore and\r\ndropped its cargo in one vast splattering of white and color to the\r\nalready littered floor. Then with a sigh of relief she turned to\r\nMerlin and held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by,\xe2\x80\x9d she said simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going?\xe2\x80\x9d He knew she was. His question was simply a lingering\r\nwile to detain her and extract for another moment that dazzling\r\nessence of light he drew from her presence, to continue his enormous\r\nsatisfaction in her features, which were like kisses and, he thought,\r\nlike the features of a girl he had known back in 1910. For a minute he\r\npressed the softness of her hand--then she smiled and withdrew it and,\r\nbefore he could spring to open the door, she had done it herself and\r\nwas gone out into the turbid and ominous twilight that brooded\r\nnarrowly over Forty-seventh Street.\r\n\r\nI would like to tell you how Merlin, having seen how beauty regards\r\nthe wisdom of the years, walked into the little partition of Mr.\r\nMoonlight Quill and gave up his job then and there; thence issuing out\r\ninto the street a much finer and nobler and increasingly ironic man.\r\nBut the truth is much more commonplace. Merlin Grainger stood up and\r\nsurveyed the wreck of the bookshop, the ruined volumes, the torn silk\r\nremnants of the once beautiful crimson lamp, the crystalline\r\nsprinkling of broken glass which lay in iridescent dust over the whole\r\ninterior--and then he went to a corner where a broom was kept and\r\nbegan cleaning up and rearranging and, as far as he was able,\r\nrestoring the shop to its former condition. He found that, though some\r\nfew of the books were uninjured, most of them had suffered in varying\r\nextents. The backs were off some, the pages were torn from others,\r\nstill others were just slightly cracked in the front, which, as all\r\ncareless book returners know, makes a book unsalable, and therefore\r\nsecond-hand.\r\n\r\nNevertheless by six o\xe2\x80\x99clock he had done much to repair the damage. He\r\nhad returned the books to their original places, swept the floor, and\r\nput new lights in the sockets overhead. The red shade itself was\r\nruined beyond redemption, and Merlin thought in some trepidation that\r\nthe money to replace it might have to come out of his salary. At six,\r\ntherefore, having done the best he could, he crawled over the front\r\nwindow display to pull down the blind. As he was treading delicately\r\nback, he saw Mr. Moonlight Quill rise from his desk, put on his\r\novercoat and hat, and emerge into the shop. He nodded mysteriously at\r\nMerlin and went toward the door. With his hand on the knob he paused,\r\nturned around, and in a voice curiously compounded of ferocity and\r\nuncertainty, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that girl comes in here again, you tell her to behave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he opened the door, drowning Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s meek \xe2\x80\x9cYessir\xe2\x80\x9d in its\r\ncreak, and went out.\r\n\r\nMerlin stood there for a moment, deciding wisely not to worry about\r\nwhat was for the present only a possible futurity, and then he went\r\ninto the back of the shop and invited Miss Masters to have supper with\r\nhim at Pulpat\xe2\x80\x99s French Restaurant, where one could still obtain red\r\nwine at dinner, despite the Great Federal Government. Miss Masters\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWine makes me feel all tingly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nMerlin laughed inwardly as he compared her to Caroline, or rather as\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t compare her. There was no comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMr. Moonlight Quill, mysterious, exotic, and oriental in temperament\r\nwas, nevertheless, a man of decision. And it was with decision that he\r\napproached the problem of his wrecked shop. Unless he should make an\r\noutlay equal to the original cost of his entire stock--a step which\r\nfor certain private reasons he did not wish to take--it would be\r\nimpossible for him to continue in business with the Moonlight Quill as\r\nbefore. There was but one thing to do. He promptly turned his\r\nestablishment from an up-to-the-minute book-store into a second-hand\r\nbookshop. The damaged books were marked down from twenty-five to fifty\r\nper cent, the name over the door whose serpentine embroidery had once\r\nshone so insolently bright, was allowed to grow dim and take on the\r\nindescribably vague color of old paint, and, having a strong penchant\r\nfor ceremonial, the proprietor even went so far as to buy two\r\nskull-caps of shoddy red felt, one for himself and one for his clerk,\r\nMerlin Grainger. Moreover, he let his goatee grow until it resembled\r\nthe tail-feathers of an ancient sparrow and substituted for a once\r\ndapper business suit a reverence-inspiring affair of shiny alpaca.\r\n\r\nIn fact, within a year after Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s catastrophic visit to the\r\nbookshop the only thing in it that preserved any semblance of being up\r\nto date was Miss Masters. Miss McCracken had followed in the footsteps\r\nof Mr. Moonlight Quill and become an intolerable dowd.\r\n\r\nFor Merlin too, from a feeling compounded of loyalty and listlessness,\r\nhad let his exterior take on the semblance of a deserted garden. He\r\naccepted the red felt skull-cap as a symbol of his decay. Always a\r\nyoung man known as a \xe2\x80\x9cpusher,\xe2\x80\x9d he had been, since the day of his\r\ngraduation from the manual training department of a New York High\r\nSchool, an inveterate brusher of clothes, hair, teeth, and even\r\neyebrows, and had learned the value of laying all his clean socks toe\r\nupon toe and heel upon heel in a certain drawer of his bureau, which\r\nwould be known as the sock drawer.\r\n\r\nThese things, he felt, had won him his place in the greatest splendor\r\nof the Moonlight Quill. It was due to them that he was not still\r\nmaking \xe2\x80\x9cchests useful for keeping things,\xe2\x80\x9d as he was taught with\r\nbreathless practicality in High School, and selling them to whoever\r\nhad use of such chests--possibly undertakers. Nevertheless when the\r\nprogressive Moonlight Quill became the retrogressive Moonlight Quill\r\nhe preferred to sink with it, and so took to letting his suits gather\r\nundisturbed the wispy burdens of the air and to throwing his socks\r\nindiscriminately into the shirt drawer, the underwear drawer, and even\r\ninto no drawer at all. It was not uncommon in his new carelessness to\r\nlet many of his clean clothes go directly back to the laundry without\r\nhaving ever been worn, a common eccentricity of impoverished\r\nbachelors. And this in the face of his favorite magazines, which at\r\nthat time were fairly staggering with articles by successful authors\r\nagainst the frightful impudence of the condemned poor, such as the\r\nbuying of wearable shirts and nice cuts of meat, and the fact that\r\nthey preferred good investments in personal jewelry to respectable\r\nones in four per cent saving-banks.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a strange state of affairs and a sorry one for many\r\nworthy and God-fearing men. For the first time in the history of the\r\nRepublic almost any negro north of Georgia could change a one-dollar\r\nbill. But as at that time the cent was rapidly approaching the\r\npurchasing power of the Chinese ubu and was only a thing you got back\r\noccasionally after paying for a soft drink, and could use merely in\r\ngetting your correct weight, this was perhaps not so strange a\r\nphenomenon as it at first seems. It was too curious a state of things,\r\nhowever, for Merlin Grainger to take the step that he did take--the\r\nhazardous, almost involuntary step of proposing to Miss Masters.\r\nStranger still that she accepted him.\r\n\r\nIt was at Pulpat\xe2\x80\x99s on Saturday night and over a $1.75 bottle of water\r\ndiluted with _vin ordinaire_ that the proposal occurred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWine makes me feel all tingly, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it you?\xe2\x80\x9d chattered Miss\r\nMasters gaily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Merlin absently; and then, after a long and pregnant\r\npause: \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Masters--Olive--I want to say something to you if you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlisten to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tingliness of Miss Masters (who knew what was coming) increased\r\nuntil it seemed that she would shortly be electrocuted by her own\r\nnervous reactions. But her \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Merlin,\xe2\x80\x9d came without a sign or\r\nflicker of interior disturbance. Merlin swallowed a stray bit of air\r\nthat he found in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with the manner of making an\r\nannouncement. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no fortune at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, locked, became wistful, and dreamy and beautiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOlive,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her, \xe2\x80\x9cI love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you too, Merlin,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered simply. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we have another\r\nbottle of wine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, his heart beating at a great rate. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo drink to our engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted bravely. \xe2\x80\x9cMay it be a\r\nshort one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he almost shouted, bringing his fist fiercely down upon the\r\ntable. \xe2\x80\x9cMay it last forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean--oh, I see what you mean. You\xe2\x80\x99re right. May it be a short\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed and added, \xe2\x80\x9cMy error.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter the wine arrived they discussed the matter thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take a small apartment at first,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nbelieve, yes, by golly, I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a small one in the house where\r\nI live, a big room and a sort of a dressing-room-kitchenette and the\r\nuse of a bath on the same floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clapped her hands happily, and he thought how pretty she was\r\nreally, that is, the upper part of her face--from the bridge of the\r\nnose down she was somewhat out of true. She continued enthusiastically:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as soon as we can afford it we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a real swell apartment,\r\nwith an elevator and a telephone girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after that a place in the country--and a car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine nothing more fun. Can you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin fell silent a moment. He was thinking that he would have to\r\ngive up his room, the fourth floor rear. Yet it mattered very little\r\nnow. During the past year and a half--in fact, from the very date of\r\nCaroline\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the Moonlight Quill--he had never seen her. For a\r\nweek after that visit her lights had failed to go on--darkness brooded\r\nout into the areaway, seemed to grope blindly in at his expectant,\r\nuncurtained window. Then the lights had appeared at last, and instead\r\nof Caroline and her callers they showed a stodgy family--a little man\r\nwith a bristly mustache and a full-bosomed woman who spent her\r\nevenings patting her hips and rearranging bric-\xc3\xa0-brac. After two days\r\nof them Merlin had callously pulled down his shade.\r\n\r\nNo, Merlin could think of nothing more fun than rising in the world\r\nwith Olive. There would be a cottage in a suburb, a cottage painted\r\nblue, just one class below the sort of cottages that are of white\r\nstucco with a green roof. In the grass around the cottage would be\r\nrusty trowels and a broken green bench and a baby-carriage with a\r\nwicker body that sagged to the left. And around the grass and the\r\nbaby-carriage and the cottage itself, around his whole world there\r\nwould be the arms of Olive, a little stouter, the arms of her\r\nneo-Olivian period, when, as she walked, her cheeks would tremble up\r\nand down ever so slightly from too much face-massaging. He could hear\r\nher voice now, two spoons\xe2\x80\x99 length away:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you were going to say this to-night, Merlin. I could see--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could see. Ah--suddenly he wondered how much she could see. Could\r\nshe see that the girl who had come in with a party of three men and\r\nsat down at the next table was Caroline? Ah, could she see that? Could\r\nshe see that the men brought with them liquor far more potent than\r\nPulpat\xe2\x80\x99s red ink condensed threefold?...\r\n\r\nMerlin stared breathlessly, half-hearing through an auditory ether\r\nOlive\xe2\x80\x99s low, soft monologue, as like a persistent honey-bee she sucked\r\nsweetness from her memorable hour. Merlin was listening to the\r\nclinking of ice and the fine laughter of all four at some\r\npleasantry--and that laughter of Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s that he knew so well\r\nstirred him, lifted him, called his heart imperiously over to her\r\ntable, whither it obediently went. He could see her quite plainly, and\r\nhe fancied that in the last year and a half she had changed, if ever\r\nso slightly. Was it the light or were her cheeks a little thinner and\r\nher eyes less fresh, if more liquid, than of old? Yet the shadows were\r\nstill purple in her russet hair; her mouth hinted yet of kisses, as\r\ndid the profile that came sometimes between his eyes and a row of\r\nbooks, when it was twilight in the bookshop where the crimson lamp\r\npresided no more.\r\n\r\nAnd she had been drinking. The threefold flush in her cheeks was\r\ncompounded of youth and wine and fine cosmetic--that he could tell.\r\nShe was making great amusement for the young man on her left and the\r\nportly person on her right, and even for the old fellow opposite her,\r\nfor the latter from time to time uttered the shocked and mildly\r\nreproachful cackles of another generation. Merlin caught the words of\r\na song she was intermittently singing--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c_Just snap your fingers at care,\r\n     Don\xe2\x80\x99t cross the bridge \xe2\x80\x99til you\xe2\x80\x99re there--_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe portly person filled her glass with chill amber. A waiter after\r\nseveral trips about the table, and many helpless glances at Caroline,\r\nwho was maintaining a cheerful, futile questionnaire as to the\r\nsucculence of this dish or that, managed to obtain the semblance of an\r\norder and hurried away....\r\n\r\nOlive was speaking to Merlin--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen, then?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, her voice faintly shaded with disappointment.\r\nHe realized that he had just answered no to some question she had\r\nasked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sometime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you--care?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA rather pathetic poignancy in her question brought his eyes back to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as possible, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied with surprising tenderness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn two months--in June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo soon?\xe2\x80\x9d Her delightful excitement quite took her breath away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I think we\xe2\x80\x99d better say June. No use waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOlive began to pretend that two months was really too short a time for\r\nher to make preparations. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he a bad boy! Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he impatient,\r\nthough! Well, she\xe2\x80\x99d show him he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be too quick with _her_.\r\nIndeed he was so sudden she didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know whether she ought to\r\nmarry him at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJune,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated sternly.\r\n\r\nOlive sighed and smiled and drank her coffee, her little finger lifted\r\nhigh above the others in true refined fashion. A stray thought came to\r\nMerlin that he would like to buy five rings and throw at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy gosh!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed aloud. Soon he _would_ be putting rings\r\non one of her fingers.\r\n\r\nHis eyes swung sharply to the right. The party of four had become so\r\nriotous that the head-waiter had approached and spoken to them.\r\nCaroline was arguing with this head-waiter in a raised voice, a voice\r\nso clear and young that it seemed as though the whole restaurant would\r\nlisten--the whole restaurant except Olive Masters, self-absorbed in\r\nher new secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d Caroline was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cProbably the handsomest\r\nhead-waiter in captivity. Too much noise? Very unfortunate.\r\nSomething\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be done about it. Gerald\xe2\x80\x9d--she addressed the man\r\non her right--\xe2\x80\x9cthe head-waiter says there\xe2\x80\x99s too much noise. Appeals to\r\nus to have it stopped. What\xe2\x80\x99ll I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSh!\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Gerald, with laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cSh!\xe2\x80\x9d and Merlin heard him\r\nadd in an undertone: \xe2\x80\x9cAll the bourgeoisie will be aroused. This is\r\nwhere the floorwalkers learn French.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaroline sat up straight in sudden alertness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s a floorwalker?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cShow me a floorwalker.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nseemed to amuse the party, for they all, including Caroline, burst\r\ninto renewed laughter. The head-waiter, after a last conscientious but\r\ndespairing admonition, became Gallic with his shoulders and retired\r\ninto the background.\r\n\r\nPulpat\xe2\x80\x99s, as every one knows, has the unvarying respectability of the\r\ntable d\xe2\x80\x99h\xc3\xb4te. It is not a gay place in the conventional sense. One\r\ncomes, drinks the red wine, talks perhaps a little more and a little\r\nlouder than usual under the low, smoky ceilings, and then goes home.\r\nIt closes up at nine-thirty, tight as a drum; the policeman is paid\r\noff and given an extra bottle of wine for the missis, the coat-room\r\ngirl hands her tips to the collector, and then darkness crushes the\r\nlittle round tables out of sight and life. But excitement was prepared\r\nfor Pulpat\xe2\x80\x99s this evening--excitement of no mean variety. A girl with\r\nrusset, purple-shadowed hair mounted to her table-top and began to\r\ndance thereon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Sacr\xc3\xa9 nom de Dieu!_ Come down off there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nhead-waiter. \xe2\x80\x9cStop that music!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the musicians were already playing so loud that they could pretend\r\nnot to hear his order; having once been young, they played louder and\r\ngayer than ever, and Caroline danced with grace and vivacity, her\r\npink, filmy dress swirling about her, her agile arms playing in\r\nsupple, tenuous gestures along the smoky air.\r\n\r\nA group of Frenchmen at a table near by broke into cries of applause,\r\nin which other parties joined--in a moment the room was full of\r\nclapping and shouting; half the diners were on their feet, crowding\r\nup, and on the outskirts the hastily summoned proprietor was giving\r\nindistinct vocal evidences of his desire to put an end to this thing\r\nas quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... Merlin!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Olive, awake, aroused at last; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s such a\r\nwicked girl! Let\xe2\x80\x99s get out--now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fascinated Merlin protested feebly that the check was not paid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Lay five dollars on the table. I despise that girl. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t _bear_ to look at her.\xe2\x80\x9d She was on her feet now, tagging at\r\nMerlin\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\nHelplessly, listlessly, and then with what amounted to downright\r\nunwillingness, Merlin rose, followed Olive dumbly as she picked her\r\nway through the delirious clamor, now approaching its height and\r\nthreatening to become a wild and memorable riot. Submissively he took\r\nhis coat and stumbled up half a dozen steps into the moist April air\r\noutside, his ears still ringing with the sound of light feet on the\r\ntable and of laughter all about and over the little world of the caf\xc3\xa9.\r\nIn silence they walked along toward Fifth Avenue and a bus.\r\n\r\nIt was not until next day that she told him about the wedding--how she\r\nhad moved the date forward: it was much better that they should be\r\nmarried on the first of May.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAnd married they were, in a somewhat stuffy manner, under the\r\nchandelier of the flat where Olive lived with her mother. After\r\nmarriage came elation, and then, gradually, the growth of weariness.\r\nResponsibility descended upon Merlin, the responsibility of making his\r\nthirty dollars a week and her twenty suffice to keep them respectably\r\nfat and to hide with decent garments the evidence that they were.\r\n\r\nIt was decided after several weeks of disastrous and well-nigh\r\nhumiliating experiments with restaurants that they would join the\r\ngreat army of the delicatessen-fed, so he took up his old way of life\r\nagain, in that he stopped every evening at Braegdort\xe2\x80\x99s delicatessen\r\nand bought potatoes in salad, ham in slices, and sometimes even\r\nstuffed tomatoes in bursts of extravagance.\r\n\r\nThen he would trudge homeward, enter the dark hallway, and climb three\r\nrickety flights of stairs covered by an ancient carpet of long\r\nobliterated design. The hall had an ancient smell--of the vegetables\r\nof 1880, of the furniture polish in vogue when \xe2\x80\x9cAdam-and Eve\xe2\x80\x9d Bryan\r\nran against William McKinley, of portieres an ounce heavier with dust,\r\nfrom worn-out shoes, and lint from dresses turned long since into\r\npatch-work quilts. This smell would pursue him up the stairs,\r\nrevivified and made poignant at each landing by the aura of\r\ncontemporary cooking, then, as he began the next flight, diminishing\r\ninto the odor of the dead routine of dead generations.\r\n\r\nEventually would occur the door of his room, which slipped open with\r\nindecent willingness and closed with almost a sniff upon his \xe2\x80\x9cHello,\r\ndear! Got a treat for you to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOlive, who always rode home on the bus to \xe2\x80\x9cget a morsel of air,\xe2\x80\x9d would\r\nbe making the bed and hanging up things. At his call she would come up\r\nto him and give him a quick kiss with wide-open eyes, while he held\r\nher upright like a ladder, his hands on her two arms, as though she\r\nwere a thing without equilibrium, and would, once he relinquished\r\nhold, fall stiffly backward to the floor. This is the kiss that comes\r\nin with the second year of marriage, succeeding the bridegroom kiss\r\n(which is rather stagey at best, say those who know about such things,\r\nand apt to be copied from passionate movies).\r\n\r\nThen came supper, and after that they went out for a walk, up two\r\nblocks and through Central Park, or sometimes to a moving picture,\r\nwhich taught them patiently that they were the sort of people for whom\r\nlife was ordered, and that something very grand and brave and\r\nbeautiful would soon happen to them if they were docile and obedient\r\nto their rightful superiors and kept away from pleasure.\r\n\r\nSuch was their day for three years. Then change came into their lives:\r\nOlive had a baby, and as a result Merlin had a new influx of material\r\nresources. In the third week of Olive\xe2\x80\x99s confinement, after an hour of\r\nnervous rehearsing, he went into the office of Mr. Moonlight Quill and\r\ndemanded an enormous increase in salary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been here ten years,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9csince I was nineteen. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nalways tried to do my best in the interests of the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moonlight Quill said that he would think it over. Next morning he\r\nannounced, to Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s great delight, that he was going to put into\r\neffect a project long premeditated--he was going to retire from active\r\nwork in the bookshop, confining himself to periodic visits and leaving\r\nMerlin as manager with a salary of fifty dollars a week and a\r\none-tenth interest in the business. When the old man finished,\r\nMerlin\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks were glowing and his eyes full of tears. He seized his\r\nemployer\xe2\x80\x99s hand and shook it violently, saying over and over again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very nice of you, sir. It\xe2\x80\x99s very white of you. It\xe2\x80\x99s very, very\r\nnice of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo after ten years of faithful work in the store he had won out at\r\nlast. Looking back, he saw his own progress toward this hill of\r\nelation no longer as a sometimes sordid and always gray decade of\r\nworry and failing enthusiasm and failing dreams, years when the\r\nmoonlight had grown duller in the areaway and the youth had faded out\r\nof Olive\xe2\x80\x99s face, but as a glorious and triumphant climb over obstacles\r\nwhich he had determinedly surmounted by unconquerable will-power. The\r\noptimistic self-delusion that had kept him from misery was seen now in\r\nthe golden garments of stern resolution. Half a dozen times he had\r\ntaken steps to leave the Moonlight Quill and soar upward, but through\r\nsheer faintheartedness he had stayed on. Strangely enough he now\r\nthought that those were times when he had exerted tremendous\r\npersistence and had \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined\xe2\x80\x9d to fight it out where he was.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, let us not for this moment begrudge Merlin his new and\r\nmagnificent view of himself. He had arrived. At thirty he had reached\r\na post of importance. He left the shop that evening fairly radiant,\r\ninvested every penny in his pocket in the most tremendous feast that\r\nBraegdort\xe2\x80\x99s delicatessen offered, and staggered homeward with the\r\ngreat news and four gigantic paper bags. The fact that Olive was too\r\nsick to eat, that he made himself faintly but unmistakably ill by a\r\nstruggle with four stuffed tomatoes, and that most of the food\r\ndeteriorated rapidly in an iceless ice-box: all next day did not mar\r\nthe occasion. For the first time since the week of his marriage Merlin\r\nGrainger lived under a sky of unclouded tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThe baby boy was christened Arthur, and life became dignified,\r\nsignificant, and, at length, centered. Merlin and Olive resigned\r\nthemselves to a somewhat secondary place in their own cosmos; but what\r\nthey lost in personality they regained in a sort of primordial pride.\r\nThe country house did not come, but a month in an Asbury Park\r\nboarding-house each summer filled the gap; and during Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s two\r\nweeks\xe2\x80\x99 holiday this excursion assumed the air of a really merry\r\njaunt--especially when, with the baby asleep in a wide room opening\r\ntechnically on the sea, Merlin strolled with Olive along the thronged\r\nboard-walk puffing at his cigar and trying to look like twenty\r\nthousand a year.\r\n\r\nWith some alarm at the slowing up of the days and the accelerating of\r\nthe years, Merlin became thirty-one, thirty-two--then almost with a\r\nrush arrived at that age which, with all its washing and panning, can\r\nonly muster a bare handful of the precious stuff of youth: he became\r\nthirty-five. And one day on Fifth Avenue he saw Caroline.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday, a radiant, flowerful Easter morning and the avenue was\r\na pageant of lilies and cutaways and happy April-colored bonnets.\r\nTwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock: the great churches were letting out their people--St.\r\nSimon\xe2\x80\x99s, St. Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s, the Church of the Epistles, opened their doors\r\nlike wide mouths until the people pouring forth surely resembled happy\r\nlaughter as they met and strolled and chattered, or else waved white\r\nbouquets at waiting chauffeurs.\r\n\r\nIn front of the Church of the Epistles stood its twelve vestrymen,\r\ncarrying out the time-honored custom of giving away Easter eggs full\r\nof face-powder to the church-going d\xc3\xa9butantes of the year. Around them\r\ndelightedly danced the two thousand miraculously groomed children of\r\nthe very rich, correctly cute and curled, shining like sparkling\r\nlittle jewels upon their mothers\xe2\x80\x99 fingers. Speaks the sentimentalist\r\nfor the children of the poor? Ah, but the children of the rich,\r\nlaundered, sweet-smelling, complexioned of the country, and, above\r\nall, with soft, in-door voices.\r\n\r\nLittle Arthur was five, child of the middle class. Undistinguished,\r\nunnoticed, with a nose that forever marred what Grecian yearnings his\r\nfeatures might have had, he held tightly to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s warm, sticky\r\nhand, and, with Merlin on his other side, moved upon the home-coming\r\nthrong. At Fifty-third Street, where there were two churches, the\r\ncongestion was at its thickest, its richest. Their progress was of\r\nnecessity retarded to such an extent that even little Arthur had not\r\nthe slightest difficulty in keeping up. Then it was that Merlin\r\nperceived an open landaulet of deepest crimson, with handsome nickel\r\ntrimmings, glide slowly up to the curb and come to a stop. In it sat\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in black, a tight-fitting gown trimmed with lavender,\r\nflowered at the waist with a corsage of orchids. Merlin started and\r\nthen gazed at her fearfully. For the first time in the eight years\r\nsince his marriage he was encountering the girl again. But a girl no\r\nlonger. Her figure was slim as ever--or perhaps not quite, for a\r\ncertain boyish swagger, a sort of insolent adolescence, had gone the\r\nway of the first blooming of her cheeks. But she was beautiful;\r\ndignity was there now, and the charming lines of a fortuitous\r\nnine-and-twenty; and she sat in the car with such perfect\r\nappropriateness and self-possession that it made him breathless to\r\nwatch her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she smiled--the smile of old, bright as that very Easter and\r\nits flowers, mellower than ever--yet somehow with not quite the\r\nradiance and infinite promise of that first smile back there in the\r\nbookshop nine years before. It was a steelier smile, disillusioned and\r\nsad.\r\n\r\nBut it was soft enough and smile enough to make a pair of young men in\r\ncutaway coats hurry over, to pull their high hats off their wetted,\r\niridescent hair; to bring them, flustered and bowing, to the edge of\r\nher landaulet, where her lavender gloves gently touched their gray\r\nones. And these two were presently joined by another, and then two\r\nmore, until there was a rapidly swelling crowd around the landaulet.\r\nMerlin would hear a young man beside him say to his perhaps\r\nwell-favored companion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll just pardon me a moment, there\xe2\x80\x99s some one I _have_ to\r\nspeak to. Walk right ahead. I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithin three minutes every inch of the landaulet, front, back, and\r\nside, was occupied by a man--a man trying to construct a sentence\r\nclever enough to find its way to Caroline through the stream of\r\nconversation. Luckily for Merlin a portion of little Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s clothing\r\nhad chosen the opportunity to threaten a collapse, and Olive had\r\nhurriedly rushed him over against a building for some extemporaneous\r\nrepair work, so Merlin was able to watch, unhindered, the salon in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nThe crowd swelled. A row formed in back of the first,\r\ntwo more behind that. In the midst, an orchid rising from a black\r\nbouquet, sat Caroline enthroned in her obliterated car, nodding and\r\ncrying salutations and smiling with such true happiness that, of a\r\nsudden, a new relay of gentlemen had left their wives and consorts and\r\nwere striding toward her.\r\n\r\nThe crowd, now phalanx deep, began to be augmented by the merely\r\ncurious; men of all ages who could not possibly have known Caroline\r\njostled over and melted into the circle of ever-increasing diameter,\r\nuntil the lady in lavender was the centre of a vast impromptu\r\nauditorium.\r\n\r\nAll about her were faces--clean-shaven, bewhiskered, old, young,\r\nageless, and now, here and there, a woman. The mass was rapidly\r\nspreading to the opposite curb, and, as St. Anthony\xe2\x80\x99s around the\r\ncorner let out its box-holders, it overflowed to the sidewalk and\r\ncrushed up against the iron picket-fence of a millionaire across the\r\nstreet. The motors speeding along the avenue were compelled to stop,\r\nand in a jiffy were piled three, five, and six deep at the edge of the\r\ncrowd; auto-busses, top-heavy turtles of traffic, plunged into the\r\njam, their passengers crowding to the edges of the roofs in wild\r\nexcitement and peering down into the centre of the mass, which\r\npresently could hardly be seen from the mass\xe2\x80\x99s edge.\r\n\r\nThe crush had become terrific. No fashionable audience at a\r\nYale-Princeton football game, no damp mob at a world\xe2\x80\x99s series, could\r\nbe compared with the panoply that talked, stared, laughed, and honked\r\nabout the lady in black and lavender. It was stupendous; it was\r\nterrible. A quarter mile down the block a half-frantic policeman\r\ncalled his precinct; on the same corner a frightened civilian crashed\r\nin the glass of a fire-alarm and sent in a wild paean for all the\r\nfire-engines of the city; up in an apartment high in one of the tall\r\nbuildings a hysterical old maid telephoned in turn for the prohibition\r\nenforcement agent; the special deputies on Bolshevism, and the\r\nmaternity ward of Bellevue Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe noise increased. The first fire-engine arrived, filling the Sunday\r\nair with smoke, clanging and crying a brazen, metallic message down\r\nthe high, resounding walls. In the notion that some terrible calamity\r\nhad overtaken the city, two excited deacons ordered special services\r\nimmediately and set tolling the great bells of St. Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s and St.\r\nAnthony\xe2\x80\x99s, presently joined by the jealous gongs of St. Simon\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nthe Church of the Epistles. Even far off in the Hudson and the East\r\nRiver the sounds of the commotion were heard, and the ferry-boats and\r\ntugs and ocean liners set up sirens and whistles that sailed in\r\nmelancholy cadence, now varied, now reiterated, across the whole\r\ndiagonal width of the city from Riverside Drive to the gray\r\nwater-fronts of the lower East Side....\r\n\r\nIn the centre of her landaulet sat the lady in black and lavender,\r\nchatting pleasantly first with one, then with another of that\r\nfortunate few in cutaways who had found their way to speaking distance\r\nin the first rush. After a while she glanced around her and beside her\r\nwith a look of growing annoyance.\r\n\r\nShe yawned and asked the man nearest her if he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t run in\r\nsomewhere and get her a glass of water. The man apologized in some\r\nembarrassment. He could not have moved hand or foot. He could not have\r\nscratched his own ear....\r\n\r\nAs the first blast of the river sirens keened along the air, Olive\r\nfastened the last safety-pin in little Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s rompers and looked up.\r\nMerlin saw her start, stiffen slowly like hardening stucco, and then\r\ngive a little gasp of surprise and disapproval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flashed a glance at Merlin that mingled reproach and pain, and\r\nwithout another word gathered up little Arthur with one hand, grasped\r\nher husband by the other, and darted amazingly in a winding, bumping\r\ncanter through the crowd. Somehow people gave way before her; somehow\r\nshe managed to retain her grasp on her son and husband; somehow she\r\nmanaged to emerge two blocks up, battered and dishevelled, into an\r\nopen space, and, without slowing up her pace, darted down a\r\nside-street. Then at last, when uproar had died away into a dim and\r\ndistant clamor, did she come to a walk and set little Arthur upon his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on Sunday, too! Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she disgraced herself enough?\xe2\x80\x9d This was\r\nher only comment. She said it to Arthur, as she seemed to address her\r\nremarks to Arthur throughout the remainder of the day. For some\r\ncurious and esoteric reason she had never once looked at her husband\r\nduring the entire retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe years between thirty-five and sixty-five revolve before the\r\npassive mind as one unexplained, confusing merry-go-round. True, they\r\nare a merry-go-round of ill-gaited and wind-broken horses, painted\r\nfirst in pastel colors, then in dull grays and browns, but perplexing\r\nand intolerably dizzy the thing is, as never were the merry-go-rounds\r\nof childhood or adolescence; as never, surely, were the\r\ncertain-coursed, dynamic roller-coasters of youth. For most men and\r\nwomen these thirty years are taken up with a gradual withdrawal from\r\nlife, a retreat first from a front with many shelters, those myriad\r\namusements and curiosities of youth, to a line with less, when we peel\r\ndown our ambitions to one ambition, our recreations to one recreation,\r\nour friends to a few to whom we are anaesthetic; ending up at last in\r\na solitary, desolate strong point that is not strong, where the shells\r\nnow whistle abominably, now are but half-heard as, by turns frightened\r\nand tired, we sit waiting for death.\r\n\r\nAt forty, then, Merlin was no different from himself at thirty-five; a\r\nlarger paunch, a gray twinkling near his ears, a more certain lack of\r\nvivacity in his walk. His forty-five differed from his forty by a like\r\nmargin, unless one mention a slight deafness in his left ear. But at\r\nfifty-five the process had become a chemical change of immense\r\nrapidity. Yearly he was more and more an \xe2\x80\x9cold man\xe2\x80\x9d to his\r\nfamily--senile almost, so far as his wife was concerned. He was by\r\nthis time complete owner of the bookshop. The mysterious Mr. Moonlight\r\nQuill, dead some five years and not survived by his wife, had deeded\r\nthe whole stock and store to him, and there he still spent his days,\r\nconversant now by name with almost all that man has recorded for three\r\nthousand years, a human catalogue, an authority upon tooling and\r\nbinding, upon folios and first editions, an accurate inventory of a\r\nthousand authors whom he could never have understood and had certainly\r\nnever read.\r\n\r\nAt sixty-five he distinctly doddered. He had assumed the melancholy\r\nhabits of the aged so often portrayed by the second old man in\r\nstandard Victorian comedies. He consumed vast warehouses of time\r\nsearching for mislaid spectacles. He \xe2\x80\x9cnagged\xe2\x80\x9d his wife and was nagged\r\nin turn. He told the same jokes three or four times a year at the\r\nfamily table, and gave his son weird, impossible directions as to his\r\nconduct in life. Mentally and materially he was so entirely different\r\nfrom the Merlin Grainger of twenty-five that it seemed incongruous\r\nthat he should bear the same name.\r\n\r\nHe worked still in the bookshop with the assistance of a youth, whom,\r\nof course, he considered very idle, indeed, and a new young woman,\r\nMiss Gaffney. Miss McCracken, ancient and unvenerable as himself,\r\nstill kept the accounts. Young Arthur was gone into Wall Street to\r\nsell bonds, as all the young men seemed to be doing in that day. This,\r\nof course, was as it should be. Let old Merlin get what magic he could\r\nfrom his books--the place of young King Arthur was in the\r\ncounting-house.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon at four when he had slipped noiselessly up to the front\r\nof the store on his soft-soled slippers, led by a newly formed habit,\r\nof which, to be fair, he was rather ashamed, of spying upon the young\r\nman clerk, he looked casually out of the front window, straining his\r\nfaded eyesight to reach the street. A limousine, large, portentous,\r\nimpressive, had drawn to the curb, and the chauffeur, after\r\ndismounting and holding some sort of conversation with persons in the\r\ninterior of the car, turned about and advanced in a bewildered fashion\r\ntoward the entrance of the Moonlight Quill. He opened the door,\r\nshuffled in, and, glancing uncertainly at the old man in the\r\nskull-cap, addressed him in a thick, murky voice, as though his words\r\ncame through a fog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you--do you sell additions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe arithmetic books are in the back of the store.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur took off his cap and scratched a close-cropped, fuzzy\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, naw. This I want\xe2\x80\x99s a detecatif story.\xe2\x80\x9d He jerked a thumb back\r\ntoward the limousine. \xe2\x80\x9cShe seen it in the paper. Firs\xe2\x80\x99 addition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin\xe2\x80\x99s interest quickened. Here was possibly a big sale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, editions. Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve advertised some firsts, but--detective\r\nstories, I--don\xe2\x80\x99t--believe--What was the title?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forget. About a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a crime. I have--well, I have \xe2\x80\x98The Crimes of the Borgias\xe2\x80\x99--full\r\nmorocco, London 1769, beautifully--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaw,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the chauffeur, \xe2\x80\x9cthis was one fella did this crime.\r\nShe seen you had it for sale in the paper.\xe2\x80\x9d He rejected several\r\npossible titles with the air of connoisseur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Silver Bones,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he announced suddenly out of a slight pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Merlin, suspecting that the stiffness of his sinews\r\nwere being commented on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilver Bones. That was the guy that done the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilver Bones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilver Bones. Indian, maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin, stroked his grizzly cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cGees, Mister,\xe2\x80\x9d went on the\r\nprospective purchaser, \xe2\x80\x9cif you wanna save me an awful bawln\xe2\x80\x99 out jes\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntry an\xe2\x80\x99 think. The old lady goes wile if everything don\xe2\x80\x99t run smooth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Merlin\xe2\x80\x99s musings on the subject of Silver Bones were as futile as\r\nhis obliging search through the shelves, and five minutes later a very\r\ndejected charioteer wound his way back to his mistress. Through the\r\nglass Merlin could see the visible symbols of a tremendous uproar\r\ngoing on in the interior of the limousine. The chauffeur made wild,\r\nappealing gestures of his innocence, evidently to no avail, for when\r\nhe turned around and climbed back into the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat his\r\nexpression was not a little dejected.\r\n\r\nThen the door of the limousine opened and gave forth a pale and\r\nslender young man of about twenty, dressed in the attenuation of\r\nfashion and carrying a wisp of a cane. He entered the shop, walked\r\npast Merlin, and proceeded to take out a cigarette and light it.\r\nMerlin approached him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything I can do for you, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are seveereal things. You can\r\nfirst let me smoke my ciggy in here out of sight of that old lady in\r\nthe limousine, who happens to be my grandmother. Her knowledge as to\r\nwhether I smoke it or not before my majority happens to be a matter of\r\nfive thousand dollars to me. The second thing is that you should look\r\nup your first edition of the \xe2\x80\x98Crime of Sylvester Bonnard\xe2\x80\x99 that you\r\nadvertised in last Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s _Times_. My grandmother there happens\r\nto want to take it off your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDetecatif story! Crime of somebody! Silver Bones! All was explained.\r\nWith a faint deprecatory chuckle, as if to say that he would have\r\nenjoyed this had life put him in the habit of enjoying anything,\r\nMerlin doddered away to the back of his shop where his treasures were\r\nkept, to get this latest investment which he had picked up rather\r\ncheaply at the sale of a big collection.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned with it the young man was drawing on his cigarette\r\nand blowing out quantities of smoke with immense satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe keeps me so close to her the entire day\r\nrunning idiotic errands that this happens to be my first puff in six\r\nhours. What\xe2\x80\x99s the world coming to, I ask you, when a feeble old lady\r\nin the milk-toast era can dictate to a man as to his personal vices. I\r\nhappen to be unwilling to be so dictated to. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see the book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin passed it to him tenderly and the young man, after opening it\r\nwith a carelessness that gave a momentary jump to the book-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart, ran through the pages with his thumb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo illustrations, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he commented. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, old boy, what\xe2\x80\x99s it worth?\r\nSpeak up! We\xe2\x80\x99re willing to give you a fair price, though why I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d said Merlin with a frown.\r\n\r\nThe young man gave a startled whistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew! Come on. You\xe2\x80\x99re not dealing with somebody from the cornbelt. I\r\nhappen to be a city-bred man and my grandmother happens to be a\r\ncity-bred woman, though I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit it\xe2\x80\x99d take a special tax\r\nappropriation to keep her in repair. We\xe2\x80\x99ll give you twenty-five\r\ndollars, and let me tell you that\xe2\x80\x99s liberal. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got books in our\r\nattic, up in our attic with my old play-things, that were written\r\nbefore the old boy that wrote this was born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin stiffened, expressing a rigid and meticulous horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your grandmother give you twenty-five dollars to buy this with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not. She gave me fifty, but she expects change. I know that\r\nold lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tell her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Merlin with dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she has missed a very\r\ngreat bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive you forty,\xe2\x80\x9d urged the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on now--be reasonable and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t try to hold us up----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin had wheeled around with the precious volume under his arm and\r\nwas about to return it to its special drawer in his office when there\r\nwas a sudden interruption. With unheard-of magnificence the front door\r\nburst rather than swung open, and admitted in the dark interior a\r\nregal apparition in black silk and fur which bore rapidly down upon\r\nhim. The cigarette leaped from the fingers of the urban young man and\r\nhe gave breath to an inadvertent \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d--but it was upon Merlin that\r\nthe entrance seemed to have the most remarkable and incongruous\r\neffect--so strong an effect that the greatest treasure of his shop\r\nslipped from his hand and joined the cigarette on the floor. Before\r\nhim stood Caroline.\r\n\r\nShe was an old woman, an old woman remarkably preserved, unusually\r\nhandsome, unusually erect, but still an old woman. Her hair was a\r\nsoft, beautiful white, elaborately dressed and jewelled; her face,\r\nfaintly rouged \xc3\xa0 la grande dame, showed webs of wrinkles at the edges\r\nof her eyes and two deeper lines in the form of stanchions connected\r\nher nose with the corners of her mouth. Her eyes were dim, ill\r\nnatured, and querulous.\r\n\r\nBut it was Caroline without a doubt: Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s features though in\r\ndecay; Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s figure, if brittle and stiff in movement; Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner, unmistakably compounded of a delightful insolence and an\r\nenviable self assurance; and, most of all, Caroline\xe2\x80\x99s voice, broken\r\nand shaky, yet with a ring in it that still could and did make\r\nchauffeurs want to drive laundry wagons and cause cigarettes to fall\r\nfrom the fingers of urban grandsons.\r\n\r\nShe stood and sniffed. Her eyes found the cigarette upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. The words were not a question--they were an\r\nentire litany of suspicion, accusation, confirmation, and decision.\r\nShe tarried over them scarcely an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cStand up!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her\r\ngrandson, \xe2\x80\x9cstand up and blow that nicotine out of your lungs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man looked at her in trepidation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlow!\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded.\r\n\r\nHe pursed his lips feebly and blew into the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlow!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, more peremptorily than before.\r\n\r\nHe blew again, helplessly, ridiculously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you realize,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on briskly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\xe2\x80\x99ve forfeited five\r\nthousand dollars in five minutes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin momentarily expected the young man to fall pleading upon his\r\nknees, but such is the nobility of human nature that he remained\r\nstanding--even blew again into the air, partly from nervousness,\r\npartly, no doubt, with some vague hope of reingratiating himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung ass!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Caroline. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce more, just once more and you leave\r\ncollege and go to work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis threat had such an overwhelming effect upon the young man that he\r\ntook on an even paler pallor than was natural to him. But Caroline was\r\nnot through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you and your brothers, yes, and your\r\nasinine father too, think of me? Well, I do. You think I\xe2\x80\x99m senile. You\r\nthink I\xe2\x80\x99m soft. I\xe2\x80\x99m not!\xe2\x80\x9d She struck herself with her fist as though\r\nto prove that she was a mass of muscle and sinew. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll have more\r\nbrains left when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got me laid out in the drawing-room some sunny\r\nday than you and the rest of them were born with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Grandmother----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet. You, a thin little stick of a boy, who if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for my\r\nmoney might have risen to be a journeyman barber out in the Bronx--Let\r\nme see your hands. Ugh! The hands of a barber--_you_ presume to\r\nbe smart with _me_, who once had three counts and a bona-fide\r\nduke, not to mention half a dozen papal titles pursue me from the city\r\nof Rome to the city of New York.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, took breath. \xe2\x80\x9cStand up!\r\nBlow\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man obediently blew. Simultaneously the door opened and an\r\nexcited gentleman of middle age who wore a coat and hat trimmed with\r\nfur, and seemed, moreover, to be trimmed with the same sort of fur\r\nhimself on upper lip and chin, rushed into the store and up to\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFound you at last,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cBeen looking for you all over town.\r\nTried your house on the \xe2\x80\x99phone and your secretary told me he thought\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d gone to a bookshop called the Moonlight--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaroline turned to him irritably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I employ you for your reminiscences?\xe2\x80\x9d she snapped. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you my\r\ntutor or my broker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour broker,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed the fur-trimmed man, taken somewhat aback. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbeg your pardon. I came about that phonograph stock. I can sell for a\r\nhundred and five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d better--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo sell it. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to my grandson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Madame.\xe2\x80\x9d The fur-trimmed man made a slight bow and hurried\r\nin some confusion from the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Caroline, turning to her grandson, \xe2\x80\x9cyou stay just\r\nwhere you are and be quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned to Merlin and included his entire length in a not\r\nunfriendly survey. Then she smiled and he found himself smiling too.\r\nIn an instant they had both broken into a cracked but none the less\r\nspontaneous chuckle. She seized his arm and hurried him to the other\r\nside of the store. There they stopped, faced each other, and gave vent\r\nto another long fit of senile glee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the only way,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped in a sort of triumphant malignity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing that keeps old folks like me happy is the sense that\r\nthey can make other people step around. To be old and rich and have\r\npoor descendants is almost as much fun as to be young and beautiful\r\nand have ugly sisters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Merlin. \xe2\x80\x9cI know. I envy you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded, blinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last time I was in here, forty years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were a\r\nyoung man very anxious to kick up your heels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was,\xe2\x80\x9d he confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy visit must have meant a good deal to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have all along,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought--I used to think at\r\nfirst that you were a real person--human, I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany men have thought me inhuman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Merlin excitedly, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand. Understanding is\r\nallowed to us old people--after nothing much matters. I see now that\r\non a certain night when you danced upon a table-top you were nothing\r\nbut my romantic yearning for a beautiful and perverse woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer old eyes were far away, her voice no more than the echo of a\r\nforgotten dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I danced that night! I remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were making an attempt at me. Olive\xe2\x80\x99s arms were closing about me\r\nand you warned me to be free and keep my measure of youth and\r\nirresponsibility. But it seemed like an effect gotten up at the last\r\nmoment. It came too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very old,\xe2\x80\x9d she said inscrutably. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not realize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso I have not forgotten what you did to me when I was thirty-five.\r\nYou shook me with that traffic tie-up. It was a magnificent effort.\r\nThe beauty and power you radiated! You became personified even to my\r\nwife, and she feared you. For weeks I wanted to slip out of the house\r\nat dark and forget the stuffiness of life with music and cocktails and\r\na girl to make me young. But then--I no longer knew how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you are so very old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a sort of awe she moved back and away from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are old also; the spirit withers with\r\nthe skin. Have you come here only to tell me something I had best\r\nforget: that to be old and poor is perhaps more wretched than to be\r\nold and rich; to remind me that _my_ son hurls my gray failure in\r\nmy face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me my book,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded harshly. \xe2\x80\x9cBe quick, old man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin looked at her once more and then patiently obeyed. He picked up\r\nthe book and handed it to her, shaking his head when she offered him a\r\nbill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy go through the farce of paying me? Once you made me wreck these\r\nvery premises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in anger, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m glad. Perhaps there had been\r\nenough done to ruin _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him a glance, half disdain, half ill-concealed uneasiness,\r\nand with a brisk word to her urban grandson moved toward the door.\r\n\r\nThen she was gone--out of his shop--out of his life. The door clicked.\r\nWith a sigh he turned and walked brokenly back toward the glass\r\npartition that enclosed the yellowed accounts of many years as well as\r\nthe mellowed, wrinkled Miss McCracken.\r\n\r\nMerlin regarded her parched, cobwebbed face with an odd sort of pity.\r\nShe, at any rate, had had less from life than he. No rebellious,\r\nromantic spirit popping out unbidden had, in its memorable moments,\r\ngiven her life a zest and a glory.\r\n\r\nThen Miss McCracken looked up and spoke to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill a spunky old piece, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Alicia Dare. Mrs. Thomas Allerdyce she is now, of course; has\r\nbeen, these thirty years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d Merlin sat down suddenly in his swivel\r\nchair; his eyes were wide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, surely, Mr. Grainger, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten\r\nher, when for ten years she was the most notorious character in New\r\nYork. Why, one time when she was the correspondent in the Throckmorton\r\ndivorce case she attracted so much attention on Fifth Avenue that\r\nthere was a traffic tie-up. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you read about it in the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never used to read the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d His ancient brain was whirring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can\xe2\x80\x99t have forgotten the time she came in here and ruined\r\nthe business. Let me tell you I came near asking Mr. Moonlight Quill\r\nfor my salary, and clearing out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean, that--that you _saw_ her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaw her! How could I help it with the racket that went on. Heaven\r\nknows Mr. Moonlight Quill didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it either but of course _he_\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. He was daffy about her and she could twist him\r\naround her little finger. The second he opposed one of her whims she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nthreaten to tell his wife on him. Served him right. The idea of that\r\nman falling for a pretty adventuress! Of course he was never rich\r\nenough for _her_ even though the shop paid well in those days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when I saw her,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Merlin, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is, when I\r\n_thought_ saw her, she lived with her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, trash!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss McCracken indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had a woman\r\nthere she called \xe2\x80\x98Aunty\xe2\x80\x99, who was no more related to her than I am.\r\nOh, she was a bad one--but clever. Right after the Throckmorton\r\ndivorce case she married Thomas Allerdyce, and made herself secure for\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was she?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Merlin. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake what was she--a witch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she was Alicia Dare, the dancer, of course. In those days you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up a paper without finding her picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin sat very quiet, his brain suddenly fatigued and stilled. He was\r\nan old man now indeed, so old that it was impossible for him to dream\r\nof ever having been young, so old that the glamour was gone out of the\r\nworld, passing not into the faces of children and into the persistent\r\ncomforts of warmth and life, but passing out of the range of sight and\r\nfeeling. He was never to smile again or to sit in a long reverie when\r\nspring evenings wafted the cries of children in at his window until\r\ngradually they became the friends of his boyhood out there, urging him\r\nto come and play before the last dark came down. He was too old now\r\neven for memories.\r\n\r\nThat night he sat at supper with his wife and son, who had used him\r\nfor their blind purposes. Olive said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t sit there like a death\xe2\x80\x99s-head. Say something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him sit quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you encourage him he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nus a story we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a hundred times before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMerlin went up-stairs very quietly at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. When he was in his\r\nroom and had closed the door tight he stood by it for a moment, his\r\nthin limbs trembling. He knew now that he had always been a fool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Russet Witch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was too late. He had angered Providence by resisting too many\r\ntemptations. There was nothing left but heaven, where he would meet\r\nonly those who, like him, had wasted earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_UNCLASSIFIED MASTERPIECES_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEES OF HAPPINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you should look through the files of old magazines for the first\r\nyears of the present century you would find, sandwiched in between the\r\nstories of Richard Harding Davis and Frank Norris and others long\r\nsince dead, the work of one Jeffrey Curtain: a novel or two, and\r\nperhaps three or four dozen short stories. You could, if you were\r\ninterested, follow them along until, say, 1908, when they suddenly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen you had read them all you would have been quite sure that here\r\nwere no masterpieces--here were passably amusing stories, a bit out of\r\ndate now, but doubtless the sort that would then have whiled away a\r\ndreary half hour in a dental office. The man who did them was of good\r\nintelligence, talented, glib, probably young. In the samples of his\r\nwork you found there would have been nothing to stir you to more than\r\na faint interest in the whims of life--no deep interior laughs, no\r\nsense of futility or hint of tragedy.\r\n\r\nAfter reading them you would yawn and put the number back in the\r\nfiles, and perhaps, if you were in some library reading-room, you\r\nwould decide that by way of variety you would look at a newspaper of\r\nthe period and see whether the Japs had taken Port Arthur. But if by\r\nany chance the newspaper you had chosen was the right one and had\r\ncrackled open at the theatrical page, your eyes would have been\r\narrested and held, and for at least a minute you would have forgotten\r\nPort Arthur as quickly as you forgot Ch\xc3\xa2teau Thierry. For you would,\r\nby this fortunate chance, be looking at the portrait of an exquisite\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThose were the days of \xe2\x80\x9cFlorodora\xe2\x80\x9d and of sextets, of pinched-in\r\nwaists and blown-out sleeves, of almost bustles and absolute ballet\r\nskirts, but here, without doubt, disguised as she might be by the\r\nunaccustomed stiffness and old fashion of her costume, was a butterfly\r\nof butterflies. Here was the gayety of the period--the soft wine of\r\neyes, the songs that flurried hearts, the toasts and the bouquets, the\r\ndances and the dinners. Here was a Venus of the hansom cab, the\r\nGibson girl in her glorious prime. Here was...\r\n\r\n...here was, you find by looking at the name beneath, one Roxanne\r\nMilbank, who had been chorus girl and understudy in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Daisy Chain,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbut who, by reason of an excellent performance when the star was\r\nindisposed, had gained a leading part.\r\n\r\nYou would look again--and wonder. Why you had never heard of her. Why\r\ndid her name not linger in popular songs and vaudeville jokes and\r\ncigar bands, and the memory of that gay old uncle of yours along with\r\nLillian Russell and Stella Mayhew and Anna Held? Roxanne\r\nMilbank--whither had she gone? What dark trap-door had opened suddenly\r\nand swallowed her up? Her name was certainly not in last Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupplement on the list of actresses married to English noblemen. No\r\ndoubt she was dead--poor beautiful young lady--and quite forgotten.\r\n\r\nI am hoping too much. I am having you stumble on Jeffrey Curtains\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstories and Roxanne Milbank\xe2\x80\x99s picture. It would be incredible that you\r\nshould find a newspaper item six months later, a single item two\r\ninches by four, which informed the public of the marriage, very\r\nquietly, of Miss Roxanne Milbank, who had been on tour with \xe2\x80\x9cThe Daisy\r\nChain,\xe2\x80\x9d to Mr. Jeffrey Curtain, the popular author. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Curtain,\xe2\x80\x9d it\r\nadded dispassionately, \xe2\x80\x9cwill retire from the stage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a marriage of love. He was sufficiently spoiled to be charming;\r\nshe was ingenuous enough to be irresistible. Like two floating logs\r\nthey met in a head-on rush, caught, and sped along together. Yet had\r\nJeffrey Curtain kept at scrivening for twoscore years he could not\r\nhave put a quirk into one of his stories weirder than the quirk that\r\ncame into his own life. Had Roxanne Milbank played three dozen parts\r\nand filled five thousand houses she could never have had a role with\r\nmore happiness and more despair than were in the fate prepared for\r\nRoxanne Curtain.\r\n\r\nFor a year they lived in hotels, travelled to California, to Alaska,\r\nto Florida, to Mexico, loved and quarrelled gently, and gloried in the\r\ngolden triflings of his wit with her beauty--they were young and\r\ngravely passionate; they demanded everything and then yielded\r\neverything again in ecstasies of unselfishness and pride. She loved\r\nthe swift tones of his voice and his frantic, if unfounded jealousy.\r\nHe loved her dark radiance, the white irises of her eyes, the warm,\r\nlustrous enthusiasm of her smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you like her?\xe2\x80\x9d he would demand rather excitedly and shyly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she wonderful? Did you ever see--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d they would answer, grinning. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder. You\xe2\x80\x99re lucky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe year passed. They tired of hotels. They bought an old house and\r\ntwenty acres near the town of Marlowe, half an hour from Chicago;\r\nbought a little car, and moved out riotously with a pioneering\r\nhallucination that would have confounded Balboa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour room will be here!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried in turn.\r\n\r\n--And then:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my room here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the nursery here when we have children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ll build a sleeping porch--oh, next year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey moved out in April. In July Jeffrey\xe2\x80\x99s closest friend, Harry\r\nCromwell came to spend a week--they met him at the end of the long\r\nlawn and hurried him proudly to the house.\r\n\r\nHarry was married also. His wife had had a baby some six months before\r\nand was still recuperating at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s in New York. Roxanne had\r\ngathered from Jeffrey that Harry\xe2\x80\x99s wife was not as attractive as\r\nHarry--Jeffrey had met her once and considered her--\xe2\x80\x9cshallow.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nHarry had been married nearly two years and was apparently happy, so\r\nJeffrey guessed that she was probably all right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m making biscuits,\xe2\x80\x9d chattered Roxanne gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cCan your wife make\r\nbiscuits? The cook is showing me how. I think every woman should know\r\nhow to make biscuits. It sounds so utterly disarming. A woman who can\r\nmake biscuits can surely do no----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to come out here and live,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cGet a place\r\nout in the country like us, for you and Kitty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know Kitty. She hates the country. She\xe2\x80\x99s got to have her\r\ntheatres and vaudevilles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring her out,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Jeffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a colony. There\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nawfully nice crowd here already. Bring her out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were at the porch steps now and Roxanne made a brisk gesture\r\ntoward a dilapidated structure on the right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe garage,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will also be Jeffrey\xe2\x80\x99s writing-room\r\nwithin the month. Meanwhile dinner is at seven. Meanwhile to that I\r\nwill mix a cocktail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men ascended to the second floor--that is, they ascended\r\nhalf-way, for at the first landing Jeffrey dropped his guest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuitcase and in a cross between a query and a cry exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Harry, how do you like her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will go up-stairs,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his guest, \xe2\x80\x9cand we will shut the\r\ndoor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later as they were sitting together in the library\r\nRoxanne reissued from the kitchen, bearing before her a pan of\r\nbiscuits. Jeffrey and Harry rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the husband, intensely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExquisite,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Harry.\r\n\r\nRoxanne beamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaste one. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to touch them before you\xe2\x80\x99d seen them all\r\nand I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to take them back until I find what they taste like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike manna, darling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimultaneously the two men raised the biscuits to their lips, nibbled\r\ntentatively. Simultaneously they tried to change the subject. But\r\nRoxanne undeceived, set down the pan and seized a biscuit. After a\r\nsecond her comment rang out with lugubrious finality:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely bum!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoxanne roared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m useless,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cTurn me out, Jeffrey--I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nparasite; I\xe2\x80\x99m no good----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeffrey put his arm around her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling, I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat your biscuits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re beautiful, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Roxanne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re--they\xe2\x80\x99re decorative,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Harry.\r\n\r\nJeffrey took him up wildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the word. They\xe2\x80\x99re decorative; they\xe2\x80\x99re masterpieces. We\xe2\x80\x99ll use\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the kitchen and returned with a hammer and a handful of\r\nnails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll use them, by golly, Roxanne! We\xe2\x80\x99ll make a frieze out of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d wailed Roxanne. \xe2\x80\x9cOur beautiful house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have the library repapered in October.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBang! The first biscuit was impaled to the wall, where it quivered for\r\na moment like a live thing.\r\n\r\nBang!...\r\n\r\nWhen Roxanne returned, with a second round of cocktails the biscuits\r\nwere in a perpendicular row, twelve of them, like a collection of\r\nprimitive spear-heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoxanne,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Jeffrey, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re an artist! Cook?--nonsense! You\r\nshall illustrate my books!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring dinner the twilight faltered into dusk, and later it was a\r\nstarry dark outside, filled and permeated with the frail gorgeousness\r\nof Roxanne\xe2\x80\x99s white dress and her tremulous, low laugh.\r\n\r\n--Such a little girl she is, thought Harry. Not as old as Kitty.\r\n\r\nHe compared the two. Kitty--nervous without being sensitive,\r\ntemperamental without temperament, a woman who seemed to flit and\r\nnever light--and Roxanne, who was as young as spring night, and summed\r\nup in her own adolescent laughter.\r\n\r\n--A good match for Jeffrey, he thought again. Two very young people,\r\nthe sort who\xe2\x80\x99ll stay very young until they suddenly find themselves\r\nold.\r\n\r\nHarry thought these things between his constant thoughts about Kitty.\r\nHe was depressed about Kitty. It seemed to him that she was well\r\nenough to come back to Chicago and bring his little son. He was\r\nthinking vaguely of Kitty when he said good-night to his friend\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nand his friend at the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re our first real house guest,\xe2\x80\x9d called Roxanne after him. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou thrilled and proud?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was out of sight around the stair corner she turned to\r\nJeffrey, who was standing beside her resting his hand on the end of\r\nthe banister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you tired, my dearest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJeffrey rubbed the centre of his forehead with his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little. How did you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how could I help knowing about you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a headache,\xe2\x80\x9d he said moodily. \xe2\x80\x9cSplitting. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take some\r\naspirin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reached over and snapped out the light, and with his arm tight\r\nabout her waist they walked up the stairs together.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHarry\xe2\x80\x99s week passed. They drove about the dreaming lanes or idled in\r\ncheerful inanity upon lake or lawn. In the evening Roxanne, sitting\r\ninside, played to them while the ashes whitened on the glowing ends of\r\ntheir cigars. Then came a telegram from Kitty saying that she wanted\r\nHarry to come East and get her, so Roxanne and Jeffrey were left alone\r\nin that privacy of which they never seemed to tire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone\xe2\x80\x9d thrilled them again. They wandered about the house, each\r\nfeeling intimately the presence of the other; they sat on the same\r\nside of the table like honeymooners; they were intensely absorbed,\r\nintensely happy.\r\n\r\nThe town of Marlowe, though a comparatively old settlement, had only\r\nrecently acquired a \xe2\x80\x9csociety.\xe2\x80\x9d Five or six years before, alarmed at\r\nthe smoky swelling of Chicago, two or three young married couples,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbungalow people,\xe2\x80\x9d had moved out; their friends had followed. The\r\nJeffrey Curtains found an already formed \xe2\x80\x9cset\xe2\x80\x9d prepared to welcome\r\nthem; a country club, ballroom, and golf links yawned for them, and\r\nthere were bridge parties, and poker parties, and parties where they\r\ndrank beer, and parties where they drank nothing at all.\r\n\r\nIt was at a poker party that they found themselves a week after\r\nHarry\xe2\x80\x99s departure. There were two tables, and a good proportion of the\r\nyoung wives were smoking and shouting their bets, and being very\r\ndaringly mannish for those days.\r\n\r\nRoxanne had left the game early and taken to perambulation; she\r\nwandered into the pantry and found herself some grape juice--beer gave\r\nher a headache--and then passed from table to table, looking over\r\nshoulders at the hands, keeping an eye on Jeffrey and being pleasantly\r\nunexcited and content. Jeffrey, with intense concentration, was\r\nraising a pile of chips of all colors, and Roxanne knew by the\r\ndeepened wrinkle between his eyes that he was interested. She liked to\r\nsee him interested in small things.\r\n\r\nShe crossed over quietly and sat down on the arm of his chair.\r\n\r\nShe sat there five minutes, listening to the sharp intermittent\r\ncomments of the men and the chatter of the women, which rose from the\r\ntable like soft smoke--and yet scarcely hearing either. Then quite\r\ninnocently she reached out her hand, intending to place it on\r\nJeffrey\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder--as it touched him he started of a sudden, gave a\r\nshort grunt, and, sweeping back his arm furiously, caught her a\r\nglancing blow on her elbow.\r\n\r\nThere was a general gasp. Roxanne regained her balance, gave a little\r\ncry, and rose quickly to her feet. It had been the greatest shock of\r\nher life. This, from Jeffrey, the heart of kindness, of\r\nconsideration--this instinctively brutal gesture.\r\n\r\nThe gasp became a silence. A dozen eyes were turned on Jeffrey, who\r\nlooked up as though seeing Roxanne for the first time. An expression\r\nof bewilderment settled on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--Roxanne----\xe2\x80\x9d he said haltingly.\r\n\r\nInto a dozen minds entered a quick suspicion, a rumor of scandal.\r\nCould it be that behind the scenes with this couple, apparently so in\r\nlove, lurked some curious antipathy? Why else this streak of fire,\r\nacross such a cloudless heaven?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeffrey!\xe2\x80\x9d--Roxanne\xe2\x80\x99s voice was pleading--startled and horrified, she\r\nyet knew that it was a mistake. Not once did it occur to her to blame\r\nhim or to resent it. Her word was a trembling supplication--\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\r\nJeffrey,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, \xe2\x80\x9ctell Roxanne, your own Roxanne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Roxanne--\xe2\x80\x9d began Jeffrey again. The bewildered look changed to\r\npain. He was clearly as startled as she. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend that,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on; \xe2\x80\x9cyou startled me. You--I felt as if some one were attacking\r\nme. I--how--why, how idiotic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJeffrey!\xe2\x80\x9d Again the word was a prayer, incense offered up to a high\r\nGod through this new and unfathomable darkness.\r\n\r\nThey were both on their feet, they were saying good-by, faltering,\r\napologizing, explaining. There was no attempt to pass it off easily.\r\nThat way lay sacrilege. Jeffrey had not been feeling well, they said.\r\nHe had become nervous. Back of both their minds was the unexplained\r\nhorror of that blow--the marvel that there had been for an instant\r\nsomething between them--his anger and her fear--and now to both a\r\nsorrow, momentary, no doubt, but to be bridged at once, at once, while\r\nthere was yet time. Was that swift water lashing under their feet--the\r\nfierce glint of some uncharted chasm?\r\n\r\nOut in their car under the harvest moon he talked brokenly. It was\r\njust--incomprehensible to him, he said. He had been thinking of the\r\npoker game--absorbed--and the touch on his shoulder had seemed like an\r\nattack. An attack! He clung to that word, flung it up as a shield. He\r\nhad hated what touched him. With the impact of his hand it had gone,\r\nthat--nervousness. That was all he knew.\r\n\r\nBoth their eyes filled with tears and they whispered love there under\r\nthe broad night as the serene streets of Marlowe sped by. Later, when\r\nthey went to bed, they were quite calm. Jeffrey was to take a week off\r\nall work--was simply to loll, and sleep, and go on long walks until\r\nthis nervousness left him. When they had decided this safety settled\r\ndown upon Roxanne. The pillows underhead became soft and friendly; the\r\nbed on which they lay seemed wide, and white, and sturdy beneath the\r\nradiance that streamed in at the window.\r\n\r\nFive days later, in the first cool of late afternoon, Jeffrey picked\r\nup an oak chair and sent it crashing through his own front window.\r\nThen he lay down on the couch like a child, weeping piteously and\r\nbegging to die. A blood clot the size of a marble had broken his\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere is a sort of waking nightmare that sets in sometimes when one\r\nhas missed a sleep or two, a feeling that comes with extreme fatigue\r\nand a new sun, that the quality of the life around has changed. It is\r\na fully articulate conviction that somehow the existence one is then\r\nleading is a branch shoot of life and is related to life only as a\r\nmoving picture or a mirror--that the people, and streets, and houses\r\nare only projections from a very dim and chaotic past. It was in such\r\na state that Roxanne found herself during the first months of\r\nJeffrey\xe2\x80\x99s illness. She slept only when she was utterly exhausted; she\r\nawoke under a cloud. The long, sober-voiced consultations, the faint\r\naura of medicine in the halls, the sudden tiptoeing in a house that\r\nhad echoed to many cheerful footsteps, and, most of all, Jeffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhite face amid the pillows of the bed they had shared--these things\r\nsubdued her and made her indelibly older. The doctors held out hope,\r\nbut that was all. A long rest, they said, and quiet. So responsibility\r\ncame to Roxanne. It was she who paid the bills, pored over his\r\nbank-book, corresponded with his publishers. She was in the kitchen\r\nconstantly. She learned from the nurse how to prepare his meals and\r\nafter the first month took complete charge of the sick-room. She had\r\nhad to let the nurse go for reasons of economy. One of the two colored\r\ngirls left at the same time. Roxanne was realizing that they had been\r\nliving from short story to short story.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent visitor was Harry Cromwell. He had been shocked and\r\ndepressed by the news, and though his wife was now living with him in\r\nChicago he found time to come out several times a month. Roxanne found\r\nhis sympathy welcome--there was some quality of suffering in the man,\r\nsome inherent pitifulness that made her comfortable when he was near.\r\nRoxanne\xe2\x80\x99s nature had suddenly deepened. She felt sometimes that with\r\nJeffrey she was losing her children also, those children that now most\r\nof all she needed and should have had.\r\n\r\nIt was six months after Jeffrey\xe2\x80\x99s collapse and when the nightmare had\r\nfaded, leaving not the old world but a new one, grayer and colder,\r\nthat she went to see Harry\xe2\x80\x99s wife. Finding herself in Chicago with an\r\nextra hour before train time, she decided out of courtesy to call.\r\n\r\nAs she stepped inside the door she had an immediate impression that\r\nthe apartment was very like some place she had seen before--and almost\r\ninstantly she remembered a round-the-corner bakery of her childhood, a\r\nbakery full of rows and rows of pink frosted cakes--a stuffy pink,\r\npink as a food, pink triumphant, vulgar, and odious.\r\n\r\nAnd this apartment was like that. It was pink. It smelled pink!\r\n\r\nMrs. Cromwell, attired in a wrapper of pink and black, opened the\r\ndoor. Her hair was yellow, heightened, Roxanne imagined, by a dash of\r\nperoxide in the rinsing water every week. Her eyes were a thin waxen\r\nblue--she was pretty and too consciously graceful. Her cordiality was\r\nstrident and intimate, hostility melted so quickly to hospitality that\r\nit seemed they were both merely in the face and voice--never touching\r\nnor touched by the deep core of egotism beneath.\r\n\r\nBut to Roxanne these things were secondary; her eyes were caught and\r\nheld in uncanny fascination by the wrapper. It was vilely unclean.\r\nFrom its lowest hem up four inches it was sheerly dirty with the blue\r\ndust of the floor; for the next three inches it was gray--then it\r\nshaded off into its natural color, which was--pink. It was dirty at\r\nthe sleeves, too, and at the collar--and when the woman turned to lead\r\nthe way into the parlor, Roxanne was sure that her neck was dirty.\r\n\r\nA one-sided rattle of conversation began. Mrs. Cromwell became\r\nexplicit about her likes and dislikes, her head, her stomach, her\r\nteeth, her apartment--avoiding with a sort of insolent meticulousness\r\nany inclusion of Roxanne with life, as if presuming that Roxanne,\r\nhaving been dealt a blow, wished life to be carefully skirted.\r\n\r\nRoxanne smiled. That kimono! That neck!\r\n\r\nAfter five minutes a little boy toddled into the parlor--a dirty\r\nlittle boy clad in dirty pink rompers. His face was smudgy--Roxanne\r\nwanted to take him into her lap and wipe his nose; other parts in the\r\nvicinity of his head needed attention, his tiny shoes were kicked out\r\nat the toes. Unspeakable!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a darling little boy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Roxanne, smiling radiantly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Cromwell looked coldly at her son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe _will_ get dirty. Look at that face!\xe2\x80\x9d She held her head on one side\r\nand regarded it critically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he a _darling?_\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Roxanne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at his rompers,\xe2\x80\x9d frowned Mrs. Cromwell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe needs a change, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge stared at her curiously. To his mind the word rompers\r\nconnotated a garment extraneously smeared, as this one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to make him look respectable this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d complained Mrs.\r\nCromwell as one whose patience had been sorely tried, \xe2\x80\x9cand I found he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t have any more rompers--so rather than have him go round without\r\nany I put him back in those--and his face--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many pairs has he?\xe2\x80\x9d Roxanne\xe2\x80\x99s voice was pleasantly curious. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nmany feather fans have you?\xe2\x80\x9d she might have asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,--\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Cromwell considered, wrinkling her pretty brow. \xe2\x80\x9cFive, I\r\nthink. Plenty, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can get them for fifty cents a pair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Cromwell\xe2\x80\x99s eyes showed surprise--and the faintest superiority.\r\nThe price of rompers!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you really? I had no idea. He ought to have plenty, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhad a minute all week to send the laundry out.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, dismissing the\r\nsubject as irrelevant--\xe2\x80\x9cI must show you some things--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey rose and Roxanne followed her past an open bathroom door whose\r\ngarment-littered floor showed indeed that the laundry hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been sent\r\nout for some time, into another room that was, so to speak, the\r\nquintessence of pinkness. This was Mrs. Cromwell\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nHere the hostess opened a closet door and displayed before Roxanne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes an amazing collection of lingerie.\r\n\r\nThere were dozens of filmy marvels of lace and silk, all clean,\r\nunruffled, seemingly not yet touched. On hangers beside them were\r\nthree new evening dresses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have some beautiful things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cromwell, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not much of a\r\nchance to wear them. Harry doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about going out.\xe2\x80\x9d Spite crept\r\ninto her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly content to let me play nursemaid and\r\nhousekeeper all day and loving wife in the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoxanne smiled again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got some beautiful clothes here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have. Let me show you----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Roxanne, interrupting, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to run if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to catch my train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt that her hands were trembling. She wanted to put them on this\r\nwoman and shake her--shake her. She wanted her locked up somewhere and\r\nset to scrubbing floors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cand I just came in for a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Harry isn\xe2\x80\x99t here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey moved toward the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--and, oh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roxanne with an effort--yet her voice was still\r\ngentle and her lips were smiling--\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s Argile\xe2\x80\x99s where you can\r\nget those rompers. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not until she had reached the station and bought her ticket to\r\nMarlowe that Roxanne realized it was the first five minutes in six\r\nmonths that her mind had been off Jeffrey.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nA week later Harry appeared at Marlowe, arrived unexpectedly at five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and coming up the walk sank into a porch chair in a state of\r\nexhaustion. Roxanne herself had had a busy day and was worn out. The\r\ndoctors were coming at five-thirty, bringing a celebrated nerve\r\nspecialist from New York. She was excited and thoroughly depressed,\r\nbut Harry\xe2\x80\x99s eyes made her sit down beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, Roxanne,\xe2\x80\x9d he denied. \xe2\x80\x9cI came to see how Jeff was doing.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you bother about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Roxanne, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s something the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s Jeff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnxiety darkened her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a little worse, Harry. Doctor Jewett has come on from New York.\r\nThey thought he could tell me something definite. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to try\r\nand find whether this paralysis has anything to do with the original\r\nblood clot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said jerkily. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you expected a\r\nconsultation. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come. I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d just rock on your\r\nporch for an hour--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded.\r\n\r\nHarry hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Harry, dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d Her kindness flooded out now--enveloped\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cI know there\xe2\x80\x99s something the matter. You\xe2\x80\x99re white as a sheet.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to get you a cool bottle of beer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll at once he collapsed into his chair and covered his face with his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make her happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve tried and I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried.\r\nThis morning we had some words about breakfast--I\xe2\x80\x99d been getting my\r\nbreakfast down town--and--well, just after I went to the office she\r\nleft the house, went East to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s with George and a suitcase\r\nfull of lace underwear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a crunch on the gravel, a car turning into the drive.\r\nRoxanne uttered a little cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Doctor Jewett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll wait, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted abstractedly. He saw that\r\nhis problem had already died on the troubled surface of her mind.\r\n\r\nThere was an embarrassing minute of vague, elided introductions and\r\nthen Harry followed the party inside and watched them disappear up the\r\nstairs. He went into the library and sat down on the big sofa.\r\n\r\nFor an hour he watched the sun creep up the patterned folds of the\r\nchintz curtains. In the deep quiet a trapped wasp buzzing on the\r\ninside of the window pane assumed the proportions of a clamor. From\r\ntime to time another buzzing drifted down from up-stairs, resembling\r\nseveral more larger wasps caught on larger window-panes. He heard low\r\nfootfalls, the clink of bottles, the clamor of pouring water.\r\n\r\nWhat had he and Roxanne done that life should deal these crashing\r\nblows to them? Up-stairs there was taking place a living inquest on\r\nthe soul of his friend; he was sitting here in a quiet room listening\r\nto the plaint of a wasp, just as when he was a boy he had been\r\ncompelled by a strict aunt to sit hour-long on a chair and atone for\r\nsome misbehavior. But who had put him here? What ferocious aunt had\r\nleaned out of the sky to make him atone for--what?\r\n\r\nAbout Kitty he felt a great hopelessness. She was too expensive--that\r\nwas the irremediable difficulty. Suddenly he hated her. He wanted to\r\nthrow her down and kick at her--to tell her she was a cheat and a\r\nleech--that she was dirty. Moreover, she must give him his boy.\r\n\r\nHe rose and began pacing up and down the room. Simultaneously he heard\r\nsome one begin walking along the hallway up-stairs in exact time with\r\nhim. He found himself wondering if they would walk in time until the\r\nperson reached the end of the hall.\r\n\r\nKitty had gone to her mother. God help her, what a mother to go to! He\r\ntried to imagine the meeting: the abused wife collapsing upon the\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s breast. He could not. That Kitty was capable of any deep\r\ngrief was unbelievable. He had gradually grown to think of her as\r\nsomething unapproachable and callous. She would get a divorce, of\r\ncourse, and eventually she would marry again. He began to consider\r\nthis. Whom would she marry? He laughed bitterly, stopped; a picture\r\nflashed before him--of Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s arms around some man whose face he\r\ncould not see, of Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s lips pressed close to other lips in what was\r\nsurely passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cGod! God! God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the pictures came thick and fast. The Kitty of this morning\r\nfaded; the soiled kimono rolled up and disappeared; the pouts, and\r\nrages, and tears all were washed away. Again she was Kitty Carr--Kitty\r\nCarr with yellow hair and great baby eyes. Ah, she had loved him, she\r\nhad loved him.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he perceived that something was amiss with him,\r\nsomething that had nothing to do with Kitty or Jeff, something of a\r\ndifferent genre. Amazingly it burst on him at last; he was hungry.\r\nSimple enough! He would go into the kitchen in a moment and ask the\r\ncolored cook for a sandwich. After that he must go back to the city.\r\n\r\nHe paused at the wall, jerked at something round, and, fingering it\r\nabsently, put it to his mouth and tasted it as a baby tastes a bright\r\ntoy. His teeth closed on it--Ah!\r\n\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99d left that damn kimono, that dirty pink kimono. She might have\r\nhad the decency to take it with her, he thought. It would hang in the\r\nhouse like the corpse of their sick alliance. He would try to throw it\r\naway, but he would never be able to bring himself to move it. It would\r\nbe like Kitty, soft and pliable, withal impervious. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t move\r\nKitty; you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach Kitty. There was nothing there to reach. He\r\nunderstood that perfectly--he had understood it all along.\r\n\r\nHe reached to the wall for another biscuit and with an effort pulled\r\nit out, nail and all. He carefully removed the nail from the centre,\r\nwondering idly if he had eaten the nail with the first biscuit.\r\nPreposterous! He would have remembered--it was a huge nail. He felt\r\nhis stomach. He must be very hungry. He considered--remembered--yesterday\r\nhe had had no dinner. It was the girl\xe2\x80\x99s day out and Kitty had\r\nlain in her room eating chocolate drops. She had said she felt\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csmothery\xe2\x80\x9d and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear having him near her. He had given\r\nGeorge a bath and put him to bed, and then lain down on the couch\r\nintending to rest a minute before getting his own dinner. There\r\nhe had fallen asleep and awakened about eleven, to find that\r\nthere was nothing in the ice-box except a spoonful of potato salad.\r\nThis he had eaten, together with some chocolate drops that he found on\r\nKitty\xe2\x80\x99s bureau. This morning he had breakfasted hurriedly down town\r\nbefore going to the office. But at noon, beginning to worry about\r\nKitty, he had decided to go home and take her out to lunch. After that\r\nthere had been the note on his pillow. The pile of lingerie in the\r\ncloset was gone--and she had left instructions for sending her trunk.\r\n\r\nHe had never been so hungry, he thought.\r\n\r\nAt five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when the visiting nurse tiptoed down-stairs, he was\r\nsitting on the sofa staring at the carpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Cromwell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mrs. Curtain won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to see you at dinner. She\xe2\x80\x99s not well.\r\nShe told me to tell you that the cook will fix you something and that\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a spare bedroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s sick, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s lying down in her room. The consultation is just over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they--did they decide anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse softly. \xe2\x80\x9cDoctor Jewett says there\xe2\x80\x99s no hope. Mr.\r\nCurtain may live indefinitely, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll never see again or move again\r\nor think. He\xe2\x80\x99ll just breathe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust breathe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the first time the nurse noted that beside the writing-desk where\r\nshe remembered that she had seen a line of a dozen curious round\r\nobjects she had vaguely imagined to be some exotic form of decoration,\r\nthere was now only one. Where the others had been, there was now a\r\nseries of little nail-holes.\r\n\r\nHarry followed her glance dazedly and then rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay. I believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded. Harry picked up his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by,\xe2\x80\x9d she said pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, as though talking to himself and, evidently\r\nmoved by some involuntary necessity, he paused on his way to the door\r\nand she saw him pluck the last object from the wall and drop it into\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\nThen he opened the screen door and, descending the porch steps, passed\r\nout of her sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAfter a while the coat of clean white paint on the Jeffrey Curtain\r\nhouse made a definite compromise with the suns of many Julys and\r\nshowed its good faith by turning gray. It scaled--huge peelings of\r\nvery brittle old paint leaned over backward like aged men practising\r\ngrotesque gymnastics and finally dropped to a moldy death in the\r\novergrown grass beneath. The paint on the front pillars became\r\nstreaky; the white ball was knocked off the left-hand door-post; the\r\ngreen blinds darkened, then lost all pretense of color.\r\n\r\nIt began to be a house that was avoided by the tender-minded--some\r\nchurch bought a lot diagonally opposite for a graveyard, and this,\r\ncombined with \xe2\x80\x9cthe place where Mrs. Curtain stays with that living\r\ncorpse,\xe2\x80\x9d was enough to throw a ghostly aura over that quarter of the\r\nroad. Not that she was left alone. Men and women came to see her, met\r\nher down town, where she went to do her marketing, brought her home in\r\ntheir cars--and came in for a moment to talk and to rest, in the\r\nglamour that still played in her smile. But men who did not know her\r\nno longer followed her with admiring glances in the street; a\r\ndiaphanous veil had come down over her beauty, destroying its\r\nvividness, yet bringing neither wrinkles nor fat.\r\n\r\nShe acquired a character in the village--a group of little stories\r\nwere told of her: how when the country was frozen over one winter so\r\nthat no wagons nor automobiles could travel, she taught herself to\r\nskate so that she could make quick time to the grocer and druggist,\r\nand not leave Jeffrey alone for long. It was said that every night\r\nsince his paralysis she slept in a small bed beside his bed, holding\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nJeffrey Curtain was spoken of as though he were already dead. As the\r\nyears dropped by those who had known him died or moved away--there\r\nwere but half a dozen of the old crowd who had drunk cocktails\r\ntogether, called each other\xe2\x80\x99s wives by their first names, and thought\r\nthat Jeff was about the wittiest and most talented fellow that Marlowe\r\nhad ever known. Now, to the casual visitor, he was merely the reason\r\nthat Mrs. Curtain excused herself sometimes and hurried upstairs; he\r\nwas a groan or a sharp cry borne to the silent parlor on the heavy air\r\nof a Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\nHe could not move; he was stone blind, dumb and totally unconscious.\r\nAll day he lay in his bed, except for a shift to his wheel-chair every\r\nmorning while she straightened the room. His paralysis was creeping\r\nslowly toward his heart. At first--for the first year--Roxanne had\r\nreceived the faintest answering pressure sometimes when she held his\r\nhand--then it had gone, ceased one evening and never come back, and\r\nthrough two nights Roxanne lay wide-eyed, staring into the dark and\r\nwondering what had gone, what fraction of his soul had taken flight,\r\nwhat last grain of comprehension those shattered broken nerves still\r\ncarried to the brain.\r\n\r\nAfter that hope died. Had it not been for her unceasing care the last\r\nspark would have gone long before. Every morning she shaved and bathed\r\nhim, shifted him with her own hands from bed to chair and back to bed.\r\nShe was in his room constantly, bearing medicine, straightening a\r\npillow, talking to him almost as one talks to a nearly human dog,\r\nwithout hope of response or appreciation, but with the dim persuasion\r\nof habit, a prayer when faith has gone.\r\n\r\nNot a few people, one celebrated nerve specialist among them, gave her\r\na plain impression that it was futile to exercise so much care, that\r\nif Jeffrey had been conscious he would have wished to die, that if his\r\nspirit were hovering in some wider air it would agree to no such\r\nsacrifice from her, it would fret only for the prison of its body to\r\ngive it full release.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, shaking her head gently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I married\r\nJeffrey it was--until I ceased to love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d was protested, in effect, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t love that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can love what it once was. What else is there for me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe specialist shrugged his shoulders and went away to say that Mrs.\r\nCurtain was a remarkable woman and just about as sweet as an\r\nangel--but, he added, it was a terrible pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be some man, or a dozen, just crazy to take care of\r\nher....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCasually--there were. Here and there some one began in hope--and ended\r\nin reverence. There was no love in the woman except, strangely enough,\r\nfor life, for the people in the world, from the tramp to whom she gave\r\nfood she could ill afford to the butcher who sold her a cheap cut of\r\nsteak across the meaty board. The other phase was sealed up somewhere\r\nin that expressionless mummy who lay with his face turned ever toward\r\nthe light as mechanically as a compass needle and waited dumbly for\r\nthe last wave to wash over his heart.\r\n\r\nAfter eleven years he died in the middle of a May night, when the\r\nscent of the syringa hung upon the window-sill and a breeze wafted in\r\nthe shrillings of the frogs and cicadas outside. Roxanne awoke at two,\r\nand realized with a start she was alone in the house at last.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAfter that she sat on her weather-beaten porch through many\r\nafternoons, gazing down across the fields that undulated in a slow\r\ndescent to the white and green town. She was wondering what she would\r\ndo with her life. She was thirty-six--handsome, strong, and free. The\r\nyears had eaten up Jeffrey\xe2\x80\x99s insurance; she had reluctantly parted\r\nwith the acres to right and left of her, and had even placed a small\r\nmortgage on the house.\r\n\r\nWith her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death had come a great physical restlessness. She\r\nmissed having to care for him in the morning, she missed her rush to\r\ntown, and the brief and therefore accentuated neighborly meetings in\r\nthe butcher\xe2\x80\x99s and grocer\xe2\x80\x99s; she missed the cooking for two, the\r\npreparation of delicate liquid food for him. One day, consumed with\r\nenergy, she went out and spaded up the whole garden, a thing that had\r\nnot been done for years.\r\n\r\nAnd she was alone at night in the room that had seen the glory of her\r\nmarriage and then the pain. To meet Jeff again she went back in spirit\r\nto that wonderful year, that intense, passionate absorption and\r\ncompanionship, rather than looked forward to a problematical meeting\r\nhereafter; she awoke often to lie and wish for that presence beside\r\nher--inanimate yet breathing--still Jeff.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon six months after his death she was sitting on the porch,\r\nin a black dress which took away the faintest suggestion of plumpness\r\nfrom her figure. It was Indian summer--golden brown all about her; a\r\nhush broken by the sighing of leaves; westward a four o\xe2\x80\x99clock sun\r\ndripping streaks of red and yellow over a flaming sky. Most of the\r\nbirds had gone--only a sparrow that had built itself a nest on the\r\ncornice of a pillar kept up an intermittent cheeping varied by\r\noccasional fluttering sallies overhead. Roxanne moved her chair to\r\nwhere she could watch him and her mind idled drowsily on the bosom of\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nHarry Cromwell was coming out from Chicago to dinner. Since his\r\ndivorce over eight years before he had been a frequent visitor. They\r\nhad kept up what amounted to a tradition between them: when he arrived\r\nthey would go to look at Jeff; Harry would sit down on the edge of the\r\nbed and in a hearty voice ask:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Jeff, old man, how do you feel to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoxanne, standing beside, would look intently at Jeff, dreaming that\r\nsome shadowy recognition of this former friend had passed across that\r\nbroken mind--but the head, pale, carven, would only move slowly in its\r\nsole gesture toward the light as if something behind the blind eyes\r\nwere groping for another light long since gone out.\r\n\r\nThese visits stretched over eight years--at Easter, Christmas,\r\nThanksgiving, and on many a Sunday Harry had arrived, paid his call on\r\nJeff, and then talked for a long while with Roxanne on the porch. He\r\nwas devoted to her. He made no pretense of hiding, no attempt to\r\ndeepen, this relation. She was his best friend as the mass of flesh on\r\nthe bed there had been his best friend. She was peace, she was rest;\r\nshe was the past. Of his own tragedy she alone knew.\r\n\r\nHe had been at the funeral, but since then the company for which he\r\nworked had shifted him to the East and only a business trip had\r\nbrought him to the vicinity of Chicago. Roxanne had written him to\r\ncome when he could--after a night in the city he had caught a train\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThey shook hands and he helped her move two rockers together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s fine, Roxanne. Seems to like school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it was the only thing to do, to send him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou miss him horribly, Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--I do miss him. He\xe2\x80\x99s a funny boy--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe talked a lot about George. Roxanne was interested. Harry must bring\r\nhim out on his next vacation. She had only seen him once in her\r\nlife--a child in dirty rompers.\r\n\r\nShe left him with the newspaper while she prepared dinner--she had\r\nfour chops to-night and some late vegetables from her own garden. She\r\nput it all on and then called him, and sitting down together they\r\ncontinued their talk about George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had a child--\xe2\x80\x9d she would say.\r\n\r\nAfterward, Harry having given her what slender advice he could about\r\ninvestments, they walked through the garden, pausing here and there to\r\nrecognize what had once been a cement bench or where the tennis court\r\nhad lain....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they were off on a flood of reminiscences: the day they had taken\r\nall the snap-shots and Jeff had been photographed astride the calf;\r\nand the sketch Harry had made of Jeff and Roxanne, lying sprawled in\r\nthe grass, their heads almost touching. There was to have been a\r\ncovered lattice connecting the barn-studio with the house, so that\r\nJeff could get there on wet days--the lattice had been started, but\r\nnothing remained except a broken triangular piece that still adhered\r\nto the house and resembled a battered chicken coop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd those mint juleps!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s note-book! Do you remember how we\xe2\x80\x99d laugh, Harry, when\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d get it out of his pocket and read aloud a page of material. And\r\nhow frantic he used to get?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWild! He was such a kid about his writing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were both silent a moment, and then Harry said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were to have a place out here, too. Do you remember? We were to\r\nbuy the adjoining twenty acres. And the parties we were going to\r\nhave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain there was a pause, broken this time by a low question from\r\nRoxanne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you ever hear of her, Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted placidly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s in Seattle. She\xe2\x80\x99s married\r\nagain to a man named Horton, a sort of lumber king. He\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal\r\nolder than she is, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s behaving?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--that is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard so. She has everything, you see. Nothing\r\nmuch to do except dress up for this fellow at dinner-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout effort he changed the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to keep the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, nodding. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lived here so long, Harry, it\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nseem terrible to move. I thought of trained nursing, but of course\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99d mean leaving. I\xe2\x80\x99ve about decided to be a boarding-house lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLive in one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Keep one. Is there such an anomaly as a boarding-house lady?\r\nAnyway I\xe2\x80\x99d have a negress and keep about eight people in the summer\r\nand two or three, if I can get them, in the winter. Of course I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to have the house repainted and gone over inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoxanne, why--naturally you know best what you can do, but it does\r\nseem a shock, Roxanne. You came here as a bride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s why I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind remaining here as a\r\nboarding-house lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember a certain batch of biscuits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, those biscuits,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, from all I heard about the\r\nway you devoured them, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been so bad. I was _so_\r\nlow that day, yet somehow I laughed when the nurse told me about those\r\nbiscuits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI noticed that the twelve nail-holes are still in the library wall\r\nwhere Jeff drove them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was getting very dark now, a crispness settled in the air; a little\r\ngust of wind sent down a last spray of leaves. Roxanne shivered\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d better go in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s late. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be leaving. I go East tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey lingered for a moment just below the stoop, watching a moon that\r\nseemed full of snow float out of the distance where the lake lay.\r\nSummer was gone and now Indian summer. The grass was cold and there\r\nwas no mist and no dew. After he left she would go in and light the\r\ngas and close the shutters, and he would go down the path and on to\r\nthe village. To these two life had come quickly and gone, leaving not\r\nbitterness, but pity; not disillusion, but only pain. There was\r\nalready enough moonlight when they shook hands for each to see the\r\ngathered kindness in the other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ICKY\r\n\r\nTHE QUINTESSENCE OF QUAINTNESS IN ONE ACT\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Scene is the Exterior of a Cottage in West Issacshire on a\r\ndesperately Arcadian afternoon in August._ MR. ICKY, _quaintly\r\ndressed in the costume of an Elizabethan peasant, is pottering and\r\ndoddering among the pots and dods. He is an old man, well past the\r\nprime of life, no longer young. From the fact that there is a burr in\r\nhis speech and that he has absent-mindedly put on his coat wrongside\r\nout, we surmise that he is either above or below the ordinary\r\nsuperficialities of life._\r\n\r\n_Near him on the grass lies_ PETER, _a little boy._\r\nPETER, _of course, has his chin on his palm like the pictures\r\nof the young Sir Walter Raleigh.

(_Gravely_) I think I\r\nshall be a star some day....\r\n\r\nMR. ICKY: (_Whimsically_) Yes, yes ... yes....\r\n\r\nPETER: I know them all: Venus, Mars, Neptune, Gloria Swanson.\r\n\r\nMR. ICKY: I don\xe2\x80\x99t take no stock in astronomy.... I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nLunnon, laddie. And calling to mind my daughter, who has gone for to\r\nbe a typewriter.... (_He sighs._)\r\n\r\nPETER: I liked Ulsa, Mr. Icky; she was so plump, so round, so buxom.\r\n\r\nMR. ICKY: Not worth the paper she was padded with, laddie. (_He\r\nstumbles over a pile of pots and dods._)\r\n\r\nPETER: How is your asthma, Mr. Icky?\r\n\r\nMR. ICKY: Worse, thank God!...(_Gloomily.)_ I\xe2\x80\x99m a hundred years\r\nold... I\xe2\x80\x99m getting brittle.\r\n\r\nPETER: I suppose life has been pretty tame since you gave up petty\r\narson.\r\n\r\nMR. ICKY: Yes... yes.... You see, Peter, laddie, when I was fifty I\r\nreformed once--in prison.\r\n\r\nPETER: You went wrong again?\r\n\r\nMR. ICKY: Worse than that. The week before my term expired they\r\ninsisted on transferring to me the glands of a healthy young prisoner\r\nthey were executing.\r\n\r\nPETER: And it renovated you?\r\n\r\nMR. ICKY: Renovated me! It put the Old Nick back into me! This young\r\ncriminal was evidently a suburban burglar and a kleptomaniac. What was\r\na little playful arson in comparison!\r\n\r\nPETER: (_Awed_) How ghastly! Science is the bunk.\r\n\r\nMR. ICKY: (_Sighing_) I got him pretty well subdued now. \xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nevery one who has to tire out two sets o\xe2\x80\x99 glands in his lifetime.

I have the best constitution in the world--\r\n\r\nULSA: And the worst by-laws.\r\n\r\nDIVINE: At Eton I was a member at Pop; at Rugby I belonged to\r\nNear-beer. As a younger son I was destined for the police force--\r\n\r\nMR. ICKY: Skip that.... Have you money?...\r\n\r\nDIVINE: Wads of it. I should expect Ulsa to go down town in sections\r\nevery morning--in two Rolls Royces. I have also a kiddy-car and a\r\nconverted tank. I have seats at the opera--\r\n\r\nULSA: (_Sullenly_) I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep except in a box. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\r\nthat you were cashiered from your club.\r\n\r\nMR.

ICKY: Be careful. ... I will not marry my daughter to an epigram....\r\n\r\nDIVINE: (_More gloomily_) I assure you I\xe2\x80\x99m a mere platitude.

Read it\r\nhere, see it in the movies, play it on the phonograph, run it through\r\nthe sewing-machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WILD THING\r\n\r\nIt was night in the mountains of Kentucky. Wild hills rose on all\r\nsides. Swift mountain streams flowed rapidly up and down the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nJemina Tantrum was down at the stream, brewing whiskey at the family\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nShe was a typical mountain girl.\r\n\r\nHer feet were bare. Her hands, large and powerful, hung down below her\r\nknees. Her face showed the ravages of work. Although but sixteen, she\r\nhad for over a dozen years been supporting her aged pappy and mappy by\r\nbrewing mountain whiskey. From time to time she would pause in her\r\ntask, and, filling a dipper full of the pure, invigorating liquid,\r\nwould drain it off--then pursue her work with renewed vigor.\r\n\r\nShe would place the rye in the vat, thresh it out with her feet and,\r\nin twenty minutes, the completed product would be turned out.\r\n\r\nA sudden cry made her pause in the act of draining a dipper and look\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice. It came from a man clad in hunting boots\r\nreaching to his neck, who had emerged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me the way to the Tantrums\xe2\x80\x99 cabin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you uns from the settlements down thar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pointed her hand down to the bottom of the hill, where Louisville\r\nlay. She had never been there; but once, before she was born, her\r\ngreat-grandfather, old Gore Tantrum, had gone into the settlements in\r\nthe company of two marshals, and had never come back. So the Tantrums,\r\nfrom generation to generation, had learned to dread civilization.\r\n\r\nThe man was amused. He laughed a light tinkling laugh, the laugh of a\r\nPhiladelphian. Something in the ring of it thrilled her. She drank off\r\nanother dipper of whiskey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mr. Tantrum, little girl?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, not without kindness.\r\n\r\nShe raised her foot and pointed her big toe toward the woods. \xe2\x80\x9cThar in\r\nthe cabing behind those thar pines. Old Tantrum air my old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man from the settlements thanked her and strode off. He was fairly\r\nvibrant with youth and personality. As he walked along he whistled and\r\nsang and turned handsprings and flapjacks, breathing in the fresh,\r\ncool air of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe air around the still was like wine.\r\n\r\nJemina Tantrum watched him entranced. No one like him had ever come\r\ninto her life before.\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the grass and counted her toes. She counted eleven.\r\nShe had learned arithmetic in the mountain school.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MOUNTAIN FEUD\r\n\r\nTen years before a lady from the settlements had opened a school on\r\nthe mountain. Jemina had no money, but she had paid her way in\r\nwhiskey, bringing a pailful to school every morning and leaving it on\r\nMiss Lafarge\xe2\x80\x99s desk. Miss Lafarge had died of delirium tremens after a\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s teaching, and so Jemina\xe2\x80\x99s education had stopped.\r\n\r\nAcross the still stream, still another still was standing. It was that\r\nof the Doldrums. The Doldrums and the Tantrums never exchanged calls.\r\n\r\nThey hated each other.\r\n\r\nFifty years before old Jem Doldrum and old Jem Tantrum had quarrelled\r\nin the Tantrum cabin over a game of slapjack. Jem Doldrum had thrown\r\nthe king of hearts in Jem Tantrum\xe2\x80\x99s face, and old Tantrum, enraged,\r\nhad felled the old Doldrum with the nine of diamonds. Other Doldrums\r\nand Tantrums had joined in and the little cabin was soon filled with\r\nflying cards. Harstrum Doldrum, one of the younger Doldrums, lay\r\nstretched on the floor writhing in agony, the ace of hearts crammed\r\ndown his throat. Jem Tantrum, standing in the doorway, ran through\r\nsuit after suit, his face alight with fiendish hatred. Old Mappy\r\nTantrum stood on the table wetting down the Doldrums with hot whiskey.\r\nOld Heck Doldrum, having finally run out of trumps, was backed out of\r\nthe cabin, striking left and right with his tobacco pouch, and\r\ngathering around him the rest of his clan. Then they mounted their\r\nsteers and galloped furiously home.\r\n\r\nThat night old man Doldrum and his sons, vowing vengeance, had\r\nreturned, put a ticktock on the Tantrum window, stuck a pin in the\r\ndoorbell, and beaten a retreat.\r\n\r\nA week later the Tantrums had put Cod Liver Oil in the Doldrums\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstill, and so, from year to year, the feud had continued, first one\r\nfamily being entirely wiped out, then the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIRTH OF LOVE\r\n\r\nEvery day little Jemina worked the still on her side of the stream,\r\nand Boscoe Doldrum worked the still on his side.\r\n\r\nSometimes, with automatic inherited hatred, the feudists would throw\r\nwhiskey at each other, and Jemina would come home smelling like a\r\nFrench table d\xe2\x80\x99h\xc3\xb4te.\r\n\r\nBut now Jemina was too thoughtful to look across the stream.\r\n\r\nHow wonderful the stranger had been and how oddly he was dressed! In\r\nher innocent way she had never believed that there were any civilized\r\nsettlements at all, and she had put the belief in them down to the\r\ncredulity of the mountain people.\r\n\r\nShe turned to go up to the cabin, and, as she turned something struck\r\nher in the neck. It was a sponge, thrown by Boscoe Doldrum--a sponge\r\nsoaked in whiskey from his still on the other side of the stream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi, thar, Boscoe Doldrum,\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted in her deep bass voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYo! Jemina Tantrum. Gosh ding yo\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d he returned.\r\n\r\nShe continued her way to the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was talking to her father. Gold had been discovered on\r\nthe Tantrum land, and the stranger, Edgar Edison, was trying to buy\r\nthe land for a song. He was considering what song to offer.\r\n\r\nShe sat upon her hands and watched him.\r\n\r\nHe was wonderful. When he talked his lips moved.\r\n\r\nShe sat upon the stove and watched him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came a blood-curdling scream. The Tantrums rushed to\r\nthe windows.\r\n\r\nIt was the Doldrums.\r\n\r\nThey had hitched their steers to trees and concealed themselves behind\r\nthe bushes and flowers, and soon a perfect rattle of stones and bricks\r\nbeat against the windows, bending them inward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather! father!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked Jemina.\r\n\r\nHer father took down his slingshot from his slingshot rack on the wall\r\nand ran his hand lovingly over the elastic band. He stepped to a\r\nloophole. Old Mappy Tantrum stepped to the coalhole.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MOUNTAIN BATTLE\r\n\r\nThe stranger was aroused at last. Furious to get at the Doldrums, he\r\ntried to escape from the house by crawling up the chimney. Then he\r\nthought there might be a door under the bed, but Jemina told him\r\nthere was not. He hunted for doors under the beds and sofas, but each\r\ntime Jemina pulled him out and told him there were no doors there.\r\nFurious with anger, he beat upon the door and hollered at the\r\nDoldrums. They did not answer him, but kept up their fusillade of\r\nbricks and stones against the window. Old Pappy Tantrum knew that just\r\nas soon as they were able to effect an aperture they would pour in and\r\nthe fight would be over.\r\n\r\nThen old Heck Doldrum, foaming at the mouth and expectorating on the\r\nground, left and right, led the attack.\r\n\r\nThe terrific slingshots of Pappy Tantrum had not been without their\r\neffect. A master shot had disabled one Doldrum, and another Doldrum,\r\nshot almost incessantly through the abdomen, fought feebly on.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer they approached the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must fly,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the stranger to Jemina. \xe2\x80\x9cI will sacrifice\r\nmyself and bear you away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Pappy Tantrum, his face begrimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou stay here and fit\r\non. I will bar Jemina away. I will bar Mappy away. I will bar myself\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man from the settlements, pale and trembling with anger, turned to\r\nHam Tantrum, who stood at the door throwing loophole after loophole at\r\nthe advancing Doldrums.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you cover the retreat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Ham said that he too had Tantrums to bear away, but that he would\r\nleave himself here to help the stranger cover the retreat, if he could\r\nthink of a way of doing it.\r\n\r\nSoon smoke began to filter through the floor and ceiling. Shem Doldrum\r\nhad come up and touched a match to old Japhet Tantrum\xe2\x80\x99s breath as he\r\nleaned from a loophole, and the alcoholic flames shot up on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe whiskey in the bathtub caught fire. The walls began to fall in.\r\n\r\nJemina and the man from the settlements looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJemina,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStranger,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will die together,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we had lived I would have taken\r\nyou to the city and married you. With your ability to hold liquor,\r\nyour social success would have been assured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe caressed him idly for a moment, counting her toes softly to\r\nherself. The smoke grew thicker. Her left leg was on fire.\r\n\r\nShe was a human alcohol lamp.\r\n\r\nTheir lips met in one long kiss and then a wall fell on them and\r\nblotted them out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAS ONE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the Doldrums burst through the ring of flame, they found them\r\ndead where they had fallen, their arms about each other.\r\n\r\nOld Jem Doldrum was moved.\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat.\r\n\r\nHe filled it with whiskey and drank it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey air dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cthey hankered after each other. The\r\nfit is over now. We must not part them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they threw them together into the stream and the two splashes they\r\nmade were as one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TALES OF THE JAZZ AGE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 6695-0.txt or 6695-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/6/6/9/6695/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
