"He isn\'t wanted here. He\'s\r\ntoo fresh."\r\n\r\nA white-haired German reached for a sandwich, and grunted between\r\nbites: "I know der breed. Ameriga is full of dot kind. I dell you you\r\nshould imbort ropes\' ends free under your dariff."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! There isn\'t any real harm to him. He\'s more to be pitied than\r\nanything," a man from New York drawled, as he lay at full length along\r\nthe cushions under the wet skylight. "They\'ve dragged him around from\r\nhotel to hotel ever since he was a kid. I was talking to his mother\r\nthis morning. She\'s a lovely lady, but she don\'t pretend to manage him.\r\nHe\'s going to Europe to finish his education."\r\n\r\n"Education isn\'t begun yet." This was a Philadelphian, curled up in a\r\ncorner. "That boy gets two hundred a month pocket-money, he told me. He\r\nisn\'t sixteen either."\r\n\r\n"Railroads, his father, aind\'t it?" said the German.\r\n\r\n"Yep. That and mines and lumber and shipping. Built one place at San\r\nDiego, the old man has; another at Los Angeles; owns half a dozen\r\nrailroads, half the lumber on the Pacific slope, and lets his wife\r\nspend the money," the Philadelphian went on lazily. "The West don\'t\r\nsuit her, she says. She just tracks around with the boy and her nerves,\r\ntrying to find out what\'ll amuse him, I guess. Florida, Adirondacks,\r\nLakewood, Hot Springs, New York, and round again. He isn\'t much more\r\nthan a second-hand hotel clerk now. When he\'s finished in Europe he\'ll\r\nbe a holy terror."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with the old man attending to him personally?" said\r\na voice from the frieze ulster.\r\n\r\n"Old man\'s piling up the rocks. \'Don\'t want to be disturbed, I guess.\r\nHe\'ll find out his error a few years from now. \'Pity, because there\'s a\r\nheap of good in the boy if you could get at it."\r\n\r\n"Mit a rope\'s end; mit a rope\'s end!" growled the German.\r\n\r\nOnce more the door banged, and a slight, slim-built boy perhaps fifteen\r\nyears old, a half-smoked cigarette hanging from one corner of his\r\nmouth, leaned in over the high footway. His pasty yellow complexion did\r\nnot show well on a person of his years, and his look was a mixture of\r\nirresolution, bravado, and very cheap smartness. He was dressed in a\r\ncherry-coloured blazer, knickerbockers, red stockings, and bicycle\r\nshoes, with a red flannel cap at the back of the head. After whistling\r\nbetween his teeth, as he eyed the company, he said in a loud, high\r\nvoice: "Say, it\'s thick outside. You can hear the fish-boats squawking\r\nall around us. Say, wouldn\'t it be great if we ran down one?"\r\n\r\n"Shut the door, Harvey," said the New Yorker. "Shut the door and stay\r\noutside. You\'re not wanted here."\r\n\r\n"Who\'ll stop me?" he answered, deliberately. "Did you pay for my\r\npassage, Mister Martin? \'Guess I\'ve as good right here as the next man."\r\n\r\nHe picked up some dice from a checkerboard and began throwing, right\r\nhand against left.\r\n\r\n"Say, gen\'elmen, this is deader\'n mud. Can\'t we make a game of poker\r\nbetween us?"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, and he puffed his cigarette, swung his legs, and\r\ndrummed on the table with rather dirty fingers. Then he pulled out a\r\nroll of bills as if to count them.\r\n\r\n"How\'s your mamma this afternoon?" a man said. "I didn\'t see her at\r\nlunch."\r\n\r\n"In her state-room, I guess. She\'s \'most always sick on the ocean. I\'m\r\ngoing to give the stewardess fifteen dollars for looking after her. I\r\ndon\'t go down more \'n I can avoid. It makes me feel mysterious to pass\r\nthat butler\'s-pantry place. Say, this is the first time I\'ve been on\r\nthe ocean."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t apologize, Harvey."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s apologizing? This is the first time I\'ve crossed the ocean,\r\ngen\'elmen, and, except the first day, I haven\'t been sick one little\r\nbit. No, sir!" He brought down his fist with a triumphant bang, wetted\r\nhis finger, and went on counting the bills.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re a high-grade machine, with the writing in plain sight," the\r\nPhiladelphian yawned. "You\'ll blossom into a credit to your country if\r\nyou don\'t take care."\r\n\r\n"I know it. I\'m an American--first, last, and all the time. I\'ll show\r\n\'em that when I strike Europe. Piff! My cig\'s out. I can\'t smoke the\r\ntruck the steward sells. Any gen\'elman got a real Turkish cig on him?"\r\n\r\nThe chief engineer entered for a moment, red, smiling, and wet. "Say,\r\nMac," cried Harvey cheerfully, "how are we hitting it?"\r\n\r\n"Vara much in the ordinary way," was the grave reply. "The young are as\r\npolite as ever to their elders, an\' their elders are e\'en tryin\' to\r\nappreciate it."\r\n\r\nA low chuckle came from a corner. The German opened his cigar-case and\r\nhanded a skinny black cigar to Harvey.\r\n\r\n"Dot is der broper apparatus to smoke, my young friendt," he said. "You\r\nvill dry it? Yes? Den you vill be efer so happy."\r\n\r\nHarvey lit the unlovely thing with a flourish: he felt that he was\r\ngetting on in grownup society.\r\n\r\n"It would take more \'n this to keel me over," he said, ignorant that he\r\nwas lighting that terrible article, a Wheeling "stogie".\r\n\r\n"Dot we shall bresently see," said the German. "Where are we now, Mr.\r\nMactonal\'?"\r\n\r\n"Just there or thereabouts, Mr. Schaefer," said the engineer. "We\'ll be\r\non the Grand Bank to-night; but in a general way o\' speakin\', we\'re all\r\namong the fishing-fleet now. We\'ve shaved three dories an\' near scalped\r\nthe boom off a Frenchman since noon, an\' that\'s close sailing\', ye may\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"You like my cigar, eh?" the German asked, for Harvey\'s eyes were full\r\nof tears.\r\n\r\n"Fine, full flavor," he answered through shut teeth. "Guess we\'ve\r\nslowed down a little, haven\'t we? I\'ll skip out and see what the log\r\nsays."\r\n\r\n"I might if I vhas you," said the German.\r\n\r\nHarvey staggered over the wet decks to the nearest rail. He was very\r\nunhappy; but he saw the deck-steward lashing chairs together, and,\r\nsince he had boasted before the man that he was never seasick, his\r\npride made him go aft to the second-saloon deck at the stern, which was\r\nfinished in a turtle-back. The deck was deserted, and he crawled to the\r\nextreme end of it, near the flag-pole. There he doubled up in limp\r\nagony, for the Wheeling "stogie" joined with the surge and jar of the\r\nscrew to sieve out his soul. His head swelled; sparks of fire danced\r\nbefore his eyes; his body seemed to lose weight, while his heels\r\nwavered in the breeze. He was fainting from seasickness, and a roll of\r\nthe ship tilted him over the rail on to the smooth lip of the\r\nturtle-back. Then a low, gray mother-wave swung out of the fog, tucked\r\nHarvey under one arm, so to speak, and pulled him off and away to\r\nleeward; the great green closed over him, and he went quietly to sleep.\r\n\r\nHe was roused by the sound of a dinner-horn such as they used to blow\r\nat a summer-school he had once attended in the Adirondacks. Slowly he\r\nremembered that he was Harvey Cheyne, drowned and dead in mid-ocean,\r\nbut was too weak to fit things together. A new smell filled his\r\nnostrils; wet and clammy chills ran down his back, and he was\r\nhelplessly full of salt water. When he opened his eyes, he perceived\r\nthat he was still on the top of the sea, for it was running round him\r\nin silver-coloured hills, and he was lying on a pile of half-dead fish,\r\nlooking at a broad human back clothed in a blue jersey.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no good," thought the boy. "I\'m dead, sure enough, and this thing\r\nis in charge."\r\n\r\nHe groaned, and the figure turned its head, showing a pair of little\r\ngold rings half hidden in curly black hair.\r\n\r\n"Aha! You feel some pretty well now?" it said. "Lie still so: we trim\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\nWith a swift jerk he sculled the flickering boat-head on to a foamless\r\nsea that lifted her twenty full feet, only to slide her into a glassy\r\npit beyond. But this mountain-climbing did not interrupt blue-jersey\'s\r\ntalk. "Fine good job, I say, that I catch you. Eh, wha-at? Better good\r\njob, I say, your boat not catch me. How you come to fall out?"\r\n\r\n"I was sick," said Harvey; "sick, and couldn\'t help it."\r\n\r\n"Just in time I blow my horn, and your boat she yaw a little. Then I\r\nsee you come all down. Eh, wha-at? I think you are cut into baits by\r\nthe screw, but you dreeft--dreeft to me, and I make a big fish of you.\r\nSo you shall not die this time."\r\n\r\n"Where am I?" said Harvey, who could not see that life was particularly\r\nsafe where he lay.\r\n\r\n"You are with me in the dory--Manuel my name, and I come from schooner\r\n_We\'re Here_ of Gloucester. I live to Gloucester. By-and-by we get\r\nsupper. Eh, wha-at?"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have two pairs of hands and a head of cast-iron, for, not\r\ncontent with blowing through a big conch-shell, he must needs stand up\r\nto it, swaying with the sway of the flat-bottomed dory, and send a\r\ngrinding, thuttering shriek through the fog. How long this\r\nentertainment lasted, Harvey could not remember, for he lay back\r\nterrified at the sight of the smoking swells. He fancied he heard a gun\r\nand a horn and shouting. Something bigger than the dory, but quite as\r\nlively, loomed alongside. Several voices talked at once; he was dropped\r\ninto a dark, heaving hole, where men in oilskins gave him a hot drink\r\nand took off his clothes, and he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he waked he listened for the first breakfast-bell on the steamer,\r\nwondering why his state-room had grown so small. Turning, he looked\r\ninto a narrow, triangular cave, lit by a lamp hung against a huge\r\nsquare beam. A three-cornered table within arm\'s reach ran from the\r\nangle of the bows to the foremast. At the after end, behind a well-used\r\nPlymouth stove, sat a boy about his own age, with a flat red face and a\r\npair of twinkling gray eyes. He was dressed in a blue jersey and high\r\nrubber boots. Several pairs of the same sort of foot-wear, an old cap,\r\nand some worn-out woollen socks lay on the floor, and black and yellow\r\noilskins swayed to and fro beside the bunks. The place was packed as\r\nfull of smells as a bale is of cotton. The oilskins had a peculiarly\r\nthick flavor of their own which made a sort of background to the smells\r\nof fried fish, burnt grease, paint, pepper, and stale tobacco; but\r\nthese, again, were all hooped together by one encircling smell of ship\r\nand salt water. Harvey saw with disgust that there were no sheets on\r\nhis bed-place. He was lying on a piece of dingy ticking full of lumps\r\nand nubbles. Then, too, the boat\'s motion was not that of a steamer.\r\nShe was neither sliding nor rolling, but rather wriggling herself about\r\nin a silly, aimless way, like a colt at the end of a halter.\r\nWater-noises ran by close to his ear, and beams creaked and whined\r\nabout him. All these things made him grunt despairingly and think of\r\nhis mother.\r\n\r\n"Feelin\' better?" said the boy, with a grin. "Hev some coffee?" He\r\nbrought a tin cup full and sweetened it with molasses.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t there milk?" said Harvey, looking round the dark double tier of\r\nbunks as if he expected to find a cow there.\r\n\r\n"Well, no," said the boy. "Ner there ain\'t likely to be till \'baout\r\nmid-September. \'Tain\'t bad coffee. I made it."\r\n\r\nHarvey drank in silence, and the boy handed him a plate full of pieces\r\nof crisp fried pork, which he ate ravenously.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve dried your clothes. Guess they\'ve shrunk some," said the boy.\r\n"They ain\'t our style much--none of \'em. Twist round an\' see if you\'re\r\nhurt any."\r\n\r\nHarvey stretched himself in every direction, but could not report any\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\n"That\'s good," the boy said heartily. "Fix yerself an\' go on deck. Dad\r\nwants to see you. I\'m his son,--Dan, they call me,--an\' I\'m cook\'s\r\nhelper an\' everything else aboard that\'s too dirty for the men. There\r\nain\'t no boy here \'cep\' me sence Otto went overboard--an\' he was only a\r\nDutchy, an\' twenty year old at that. How\'d you come to fall off in a\r\ndead flat ca\'am?"\r\n\r\n"\'Twasn\'t a calm," said Harvey, sulkily. "It was a gale, and I was\r\nseasick. Guess I must have rolled over the rail."\r\n\r\n"There was a little common swell yes\'day an\' last night," said the boy.\r\n"But ef thet\'s your notion of a gale----" He whistled. "You\'ll know\r\nmore \'fore you\'re through. Hurry! Dad\'s waitin\'."\r\n\r\nLike many other unfortunate young people, Harvey had never in all his\r\nlife received a direct order--never, at least, without long, and\r\nsometimes tearful, explanations of the advantages of obedience and the\r\nreasons for the request. Mrs. Cheyne lived in fear of breaking his\r\nspirit, which, perhaps, was the reason that she herself walked on the\r\nedge of nervous prostration. He could not see why he should be expected\r\nto hurry for any man\'s pleasure, and said so. "Your dad can come down\r\nhere if he\'s so anxious to talk to me. I want him to take me to New\r\nYork right away. It\'ll pay him."\r\n\r\nDan opened his eyes as the size and beauty of this joke dawned on him.\r\n"Say, Dad!" he shouted up the foc\'sle hatch, "he says you kin slip down\r\nan\' see him ef you\'re anxious that way. \'Hear, Dad?"\r\n\r\nThe answer came back in the deepest voice Harvey had ever heard from a\r\nhuman chest: "Quit foolin\', Dan, and send him to me."\r\n\r\nDan sniggered, and threw Harvey his warped bicycle shoes. There was\r\nsomething in the tones on the deck that made the boy dissemble his\r\nextreme rage and console himself with the thought of gradually\r\nunfolding the tale of his own and his father\'s wealth on the voyage\r\nhome. This rescue would certainly make him a hero among his friends for\r\nlife. He hoisted himself on deck up a perpendicular ladder, and\r\nstumbled aft, over a score of obstructions, to where a small,\r\nthick-set, clean-shaven man with gray eyebrows sat on a step that led\r\nup to the quarter-deck. The swell had passed in the night, leaving a\r\nlong, oily sea, dotted round the horizon with the sails of a dozen\r\nfishing-boats. Between them lay little black specks, showing where the\r\ndories were out fishing. The schooner, with a triangular riding-sail on\r\nthe mainmast, played easily at anchor, and except for the man by the\r\ncabin-roof--"house" they call it--she was deserted.\r\n\r\n"Mornin\'--Good afternoon, I should say. You\'ve nigh slep\' the clock\r\nround, young feller," was the greeting.\r\n\r\n"Mornin\'," said Harvey. He did not like being called "young feller";\r\nand, as one rescued from drowning, expected sympathy. His mother\r\nsuffered agonies whenever he got his feet wet; but this mariner did not\r\nseem excited.\r\n\r\n"Naow let\'s hear all abaout it. It\'s quite providential, first an\'\r\nlast, fer all concerned. What might be your name? Where from (we\r\nmistrust it\'s Noo York), an\' where baound (we mistrust it\'s Europe)?"\r\n\r\nHarvey gave his name, the name of the steamer, and a short history of\r\nthe accident, winding up with a demand to be taken back immediately to\r\nNew York, where his father would pay anything any one chose to name.\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said the shaven man, quite unmoved by the end of Harvey\'s\r\nspeech. "I can\'t say we think special of any man, or boy even, that\r\nfalls overboard from that kind o\' packet in a flat ca\'am. Least of all\r\nwhen his excuse is that he\'s seasick."\r\n\r\n"Excuse!" cried Harvey. "D\'you suppose I\'d fall overboard into your\r\ndirty little boat for fun?"\r\n\r\n"Not knowin\' what your notions o\' fun may be, I can\'t rightly say,\r\nyoung feller. But if I was you, I wouldn\'t call the boat which, under\r\nProvidence, was the means o\' savin\' ye, names. In the first place, it\'s\r\nblame irreligious. In the second, it\'s annoyin\' to my feelin\'s--an\' I\'m\r\nDisko Troop o\' the _We\'re Here_ o\' Gloucester, which you don\'t seem\r\nrightly to know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know and I don\'t care," said Harvey. "I\'m grateful enough for\r\nbeing saved and all that, of course! but I want you to understand that\r\nthe sooner you take me back to New York the better it\'ll pay you."\r\n\r\n"Meanin\'--haow?" Troop raised one shaggy eyebrow over a suspiciously\r\nmild blue eye.\r\n\r\n"Dollars and cents," said Harvey, delighted to think that he was making\r\nan impression. "Cold dollars and cents." He thrust a hand into a\r\npocket, and threw out his stomach a little, which was his way of being\r\ngrand. "You\'ve done the best day\'s work you ever did in your life when\r\nyou pulled me in. I\'m all the son Harvey Cheyne has."\r\n\r\n"He\'s bin favoured," said Disko, dryly.\r\n\r\n"And if you don\'t know who Harvey Cheyne is, you don\'t know\r\nmuch--that\'s all. Now turn her around and let\'s hurry."\r\n\r\nHarvey had a notion that the greater part of America was filled with\r\npeople discussing and envying his father\'s dollars.\r\n\r\n"Mebbe I do, an\' mebbe I don\'t. Take a reef in your stummick, young\r\nfeller. It\'s full o\' my vittles."\r\n\r\nHarvey heard a chuckle from Dan, who was pretending to be busy by the\r\nstump-foremast, and blood rushed to his face. "We\'ll pay for that too,"\r\nhe said. "When do you suppose we shall get to New York?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t use Noo York any. Ner Boston. We may see Eastern Point about\r\nSeptember; an\' your pa--I\'m real sorry I hain\'t heerd tell of him--may\r\ngive me ten dollars efter all your talk. Then o\' course he mayn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Ten dollars! Why, see here, I--" Harvey dived into his pocket for the\r\nwad of bills. All he brought up was a soggy packet of cigarettes.\r\n\r\n"Not lawful currency; an\' bad for the lungs. Heave \'em overboard, young\r\nfeller, and try agin."\r\n\r\n"It\'s been stolen!" cried Harvey, hotly.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me, then?"\r\n\r\n"A hundred and thirty-four dollars--all stolen," said Harvey, hunting\r\nwildly through his pockets. "Give them back."\r\n\r\nA curious change flitted across old Troop\'s hard face. "What might you\r\nhave been doin\' at your time o\' life with one hundred an\' thirty-four\r\ndollars, young feller?"\r\n\r\n"It was part of my pocket-money--for a month." This Harvey thought\r\nwould be a knock-down blow, and it was--indirectly.\r\n\r\n"Oh! One hundred and thirty-four dollars is only part of his\r\npocket-money--for one month only! You don\'t remember hittin\' anything\r\nwhen you fell over, do you? Crack agin a stanchion, le\'s say. Old man\r\nHasken o\' the East Wind"--Troop seemed to be talking to himself--"he\r\ntripped on a hatch an\' butted the mainmast with his head--hardish.\r\n\'Baout three weeks afterwards, old man Hasken he would hev it that the\r\n"East Wind" was a commerce-destroyin\' man-o\'-war,   an\' so he declared\r\nwar on Sable Island because it was Bridish, an\' the shoals run aout too\r\nfar. They sewed him up in a bed-bag, his head an\' feet appearin\', fer\r\nthe rest o\' the trip, an\' now he\'s to home in Essex playin\' with little\r\nrag dolls."\r\n\r\nHarvey choked with rage, but Troop went on consolingly: "We\'re sorry\r\nfer you. We\'re very sorry fer you--an\' so young. We won\'t say no more\r\nabaout the money, I guess."\r\n\r\n"\'Course you won\'t. You stole it."\r\n\r\n"Suit yourself. We stole it ef it\'s any comfort to you. Naow, abaout\r\ngoin\' back. Allowin\' we could do it, which we can\'t, you ain\'t in no\r\nfit state to go back to your home, an\' we\'ve jest come on to the Banks,\r\nworkin\' fer our bread. We don\'t see the ha\'af of a hundred dollars a\r\nmonth, let alone pocket-money; an\' with good luck we\'ll be ashore again\r\nsomewheres abaout the first weeks o\' September."\r\n\r\n"But--but it\'s May now, and I can\'t stay here doin\' nothing just\r\nbecause you want to fish. I can\'t, I tell you!"\r\n\r\n"Right an\' jest; jest an\' right. No one asks you to do nothin\'. There\'s\r\na heap as you can do, for Otto he went overboard on Le Have. I mistrust\r\nhe lost his grip in a gale we f\'und there. Anyways, he never come back\r\nto deny it. You\'ve turned up, plain, plumb providential for all\r\nconcerned. I mistrust, though, there\'s ruther few things you kin do.\r\nAin\'t thet so?"\r\n\r\n"I can make it lively for you and your crowd when we get ashore," said\r\nHarvey, with a vicious nod, murmuring vague threats about "piracy," at\r\nwhich Troop almost--not quite--smiled.\r\n\r\n"Excep\' talk. I\'d forgot that. You ain\'t asked to talk more\'n you\'ve a\r\nmind to aboard the _We\'re Here_. Keep your eyes open, an\' help Dan to\r\ndo ez he\'s bid, an\' sechlike, an\' I\'ll give you--you ain\'t wuth it, but\r\nI\'ll give--ten an\' a ha\'af a month; say thirty-five at the end o\' the\r\ntrip. A little work will ease up your head, and you kin tell us all\r\nabaout your dad an\' your ma an\' your money afterwards."\r\n\r\n"She\'s on the steamer," said Harvey, his eyes filling with tears. "Take\r\nme to New York at once."\r\n\r\n"Poor woman--poor woman! When she has you back she\'ll forgit it all,\r\nthough. There\'s eight of us on the _We\'re Here_, an\' ef we went back\r\nnaow--it\'s more\'n a thousand mile--we\'d lose the season. The men they\r\nwouldn\'t hev it, allowin\' I was agreeable."\r\n\r\n"But my father would make it all right."\r\n\r\n"He\'d try. I don\'t doubt he\'d try," said Troop; "but a whole season\'s\r\ncatch is eight men\'s bread; an\' you\'ll be better in your health when\r\nyou see him in the fall. Go forward an\' help Dan. It\'s ten an\' a ha\'af\r\na month, e I said, an\' o\' course, all f\'und, same e the rest o\' us."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean I\'m to clean pots and pans and things?" said Harvey.\r\n\r\n"An\' other things. You\'ve no call to shout, young feller."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t! My father will give you enough to buy this dirty little\r\nfish-kettle"--Harvey stamped on the deck--"ten times over, if you take\r\nme to New York safe; and--and--you\'re in a hundred and thirty by me,\r\nanyhow."\r\n\r\n"Haow?" said Troop, the iron face darkening.\r\n\r\n"How? You know how, well enough. On top of all that, you want me to do\r\nmenial work"--Harvey was very proud of that adjective--"till the Fall.\r\nI tell you I will not. You hear?"\r\n\r\nTroop regarded the top of the mainmast with deep interest for a while,\r\nas Harvey harangued fiercely all around him.\r\n\r\n"Hsh!" he said at last. "I\'m figurin\' out my responsibilities in my own\r\nmind. It\'s a matter o\' jedgment."\r\n\r\nDan stole up and plucked Harvey by the elbow. "Don\'t go to tamperin\'\r\nwith Dad any more," he pleaded. "You\'ve called him a thief two or three\r\ntimes over, an\' he don\'t take that from any livin\' bein\'."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t!" Harvey almost shrieked, disregarding the advice, and still\r\nTroop meditated.\r\n\r\n"Seems kinder unneighbourly," he said at last, his eye travelling down\r\nto Harvey. "I--don\'t blame you, not a mite, young feeler, nor you won\'t\r\nblame me when the bile\'s out o\' your systim. Be sure you sense what I\r\nsay? Ten an\' a ha\'af fer second boy on the schooner--an\' all found--fer\r\nto teach you an\' fer the sake o\' your health. Yes or no?"\r\n\r\n"No!" said Harvey. "Take me back to New York or I\'ll see you--"\r\n\r\nHe did not exactly remember what followed. He was lying in the\r\nscuppers, holding on to a nose that bled while Troop looked down on him\r\nserenely.\r\n\r\n"Dan," he said to his son, "I was sot agin this young feeler when I\r\nfirst saw him on account o\' hasty jedgments. Never you be led astray by\r\nhasty jedgments, Dan. Naow I\'m sorry for him, because he\'s clear\r\ndistracted in his upper works. He ain\'t responsible fer the names he\'s\r\ngive me, nor fer his other statements--nor fer jumpin\' overboard, which\r\nI\'m abaout ha\'af convinced he did. You be gentle with him, Dan, \'r I\'ll\r\ngive you twice what I\'ve give him. Them hemmeridges clears the head.\r\nLet him sluice it off!"\r\n\r\nTroop went down solemnly into the cabin, where he and the older men\r\nbunked, leaving Dan to comfort the luckless heir to thirty millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n"I warned ye," said Dan, as the drops fell thick and fast on the dark,\r\noiled planking. "Dad ain\'t noways hasty, but you fair earned it. Pshaw!\r\nthere\'s no sense takin\' on so." Harvey\'s shoulders were rising and\r\nfalling in spasms of dry sobbing. "I know the feelin\'. First time Dad\r\nlaid me out was the last--and that was my first trip. Makes ye feel\r\nsickish an\' lonesome. I know."\r\n\r\n"It does," moaned Harvey. "That man\'s either crazy or drunk, and--and I\r\ncan\'t do anything."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that to Dad," whispered Dan. "He\'s set agin all liquor,\r\nan\'--well, he told me you was the madman. What in creation made you\r\ncall him a thief? He\'s my dad."\r\n\r\nHarvey sat up, mopped his nose, and told the story of the missing wad\r\nof bills. "I\'m not crazy," he wound up. "Only--your father has never\r\nseen more than a five-dollar bill at a time, and my father could buy up\r\nthis boat once a week and never miss it."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know what the _We\'re Here\'s_ worth. Your dad must hev a pile\r\no\' money. How did he git it? Dad sez loonies can\'t shake out a straight\r\nyarn. Go ahead."\r\n\r\n"In gold mines and things, West."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve read o\' that kind o\' business. Out West, too? Does he go around\r\nwith a pistol on a trick-pony, same ez the circus? They call that the\r\nWild West, and I\'ve heard that their spurs an\' bridles was solid\r\nsilver."\r\n\r\n"You are a chump!" said Harvey, amused in spite of himself. "My father\r\nhasn\'t any use for ponies. When he wants to ride he takes his car."\r\n\r\n"Haow? Lobster-car?"\r\n\r\n"No. His own private car, of course. You\'ve seen a private car some\r\ntime in your life?"\r\n\r\n"Slatin Beeman he hez one," said Dan, cautiously. "I saw her at the\r\nUnion Depot in Boston, with three niggers hoggin\' her run." (Dan meant\r\ncleaning the windows.) "But Slatin Beeman he owns \'baout every railroad\r\non Long Island, they say, an\' they say he\'s bought \'baout ha\'af Noo\r\nHampshire an\' run a line fence around her, an\' filled her up with lions\r\nan\' tigers an\' bears an\' buffalo an\' crocodiles an\' such all. Slatin\r\nBeeman he\'s a millionaire. I\'ve seen his car. Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Well, my father\'s what they call a multi-millionaire, and he has two\r\nprivate cars. One\'s named for me, the \'Harvey\', and one for my mother,\r\nthe \'Constance\'."\r\n\r\n"Hold on," said Dan. "Dad don\'t ever let me swear, but I guess you can.\r\n\'Fore we go ahead, I want you to say hope you may die if you\'re lyin\'."\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Harvey.\r\n\r\n"The ain\'t \'niff. Say, \'Hope I may die if I ain\'t speaking\' truth.\'"\r\n\r\n"Hope I may die right here," said Harvey, "if every word I\'ve spoken\r\nisn\'t the cold truth."\r\n\r\n"Hundred an\' thirty-four dollars an\' all?" said Dan. "I heard ye\r\ntalkin\' to Dad, an\' I ha\'af looked you\'d be swallered up, same\'s Jonah."\r\n\r\nHarvey protested himself red in the face. Dan was a shrewd young person\r\nalong his own lines, and ten minutes\' questioning convinced him that\r\nHarvey was not lying--much. Besides, he had bound himself by the most\r\nterrible oath known to boyhood, and yet he sat, alive, with a red-ended\r\nnose, in the scuppers, recounting marvels upon marvels.\r\n\r\n"Gosh!" said Dan at last from the very bottom of his soul when Harvey\r\nhad completed an inventory of the car named in his honour. Then a grin\r\nof mischievous delight overspread his broad face. "I believe you,\r\nHarvey. Dad\'s made a mistake fer once in his life."\r\n\r\n"He has, sure," said Harvey, who was meditating an early revenge.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be mad clear through. Dad jest hates to be mistook in his\r\njedgments." Dan lay back and slapped his thigh. "Oh, Harvey, don\'t you\r\nspile the catch by lettin\' on."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to be knocked down again. I\'ll get even with him, though."\r\n\r\n"Never heard any man ever got even with dad. But he\'d knock ye down\r\nagain sure. The more he was mistook the more he\'d do it. But gold-mines\r\nand pistols--"\r\n\r\n"I never said a word about pistols," Harvey cut in, for he was on his\r\noath.\r\n\r\n"Thet\'s so; no more you did. Two private cars, then, one named fer you\r\nan\' one fer her; an\' two hundred dollars a month pocket-money, all\r\nknocked into the scuppers fer not workin\' fer ten an\' a ha\'af a month!\r\nIt\'s the top haul o\' the season." He exploded with noiseless chuckles.\r\n\r\n"Then I was right?" said Harvey, who thought he had found a sympathiser.\r\n\r\n"You was wrong; the wrongest kind o\' wrong! You take right hold an\'\r\npitch in \'longside o\' me, or you\'ll catch it, an\' I\'ll catch it fer\r\nbackin\' you up. Dad always gives me double helps \'cause I\'m his son,\r\nan\' he hates favourin\' folk. \'Guess you\'re kinder mad at dad. I\'ve been\r\nthat way time an\' again. But dad\'s a mighty jest man; all the fleet\r\nsays so."\r\n\r\n"Looks like justice, this, don\'t it?" Harvey pointed to his outraged\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n"Thet\'s nothin\'. Lets the shore blood outer you. Dad did it for yer\r\nhealth. Say, though, I can\'t have dealin\'s with a man that thinks me or\r\ndad or any one on the _We\'re Here\'s_ a thief.  We ain\'t any common\r\nwharf-end crowd by any manner o\' means. We\'re fishermen, an\' we\'ve\r\nshipped together for six years an\' more. Don\'t you make any mistake on\r\nthat! I told ye dad don\'t let me swear. He calls \'em vain oaths, and\r\npounds me; but ef I could say what you said \'baout your pap an\' his\r\nfixin\'s, I\'d say that \'baout your dollars. I dunno what was in your\r\npockets when I dried your kit, fer I didn\'t look to see; but I\'d say,\r\nusing the very same words ez you used jest now, neither me nor dad--an\'\r\nwe was the only two that teched you after you was brought aboard--knows\r\nanythin\' \'baout the money. Thet\'s my say. Naow?"\r\n\r\nThe bloodletting had certainly cleared Harvey\'s brain, and maybe the\r\nloneliness of the sea had something to do with it. "That\'s all right,"\r\nhe said. Then he looked down confusedly. "\'Seems to me that for a\r\nfellow just saved from drowning I haven\'t been over and above grateful,\r\nDan."\r\n\r\n"Well, you was shook up and silly," said Dan. "Anyway, there was only\r\ndad an\' me aboard to see it. The cook he don\'t count."\r\n\r\n"I might have thought about losing the bills that way," Harvey said,\r\nhalf to himself, "instead of calling everybody in sight a thief.\r\nWhere\'s your father?"\r\n\r\n"In the cabin. What d\' you want o\' him again?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see," said Harvey, and he stepped, rather groggily, for his\r\nhead was still singing, to the cabin steps where the little ship\'s\r\nclock hung in plain sight of the wheel. Troop, in the\r\nchocolate-and-yellow painted cabin, was busy with a note-book and an\r\nenormous black pencil which he sucked hard from time to time.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t acted quite right," said Harvey, surprised at his own\r\nmeekness.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong naow?" said the skipper. "Walked into Dan, hev ye?"\r\n\r\n"No; it\'s about you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m here to listen."\r\n\r\n"Well, I--I\'m here to take things back," said Harvey very quickly.\r\n"When a man\'s saved from drowning--" he gulped.\r\n\r\n"Ey? You\'ll make a man yet ef you go on this way."\r\n\r\n"He oughtn\'t begin by calling people names."\r\n\r\n"Jest an\' right--right an\' jest," said Troop, with the ghost of a dry\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"So I\'m here to say I\'m sorry." Another big gulp.\r\n\r\nTroop heaved himself slowly off the locker he was sitting on and held\r\nout an eleven-inch hand. "I mistrusted \'twould do you sights o\' good;\r\nan\' this shows I weren\'t mistook in my jedgments." A smothered chuckle\r\non deck caught his ear. "I am very seldom mistook in my jedgments." The\r\neleven-inch hand closed on Harvey\'s, numbing it to the elbow. "We\'ll\r\nput a little more gristle to that \'fore we\'ve done with you, young\r\nfeller; an\' I don\'t think any worse of ye fer anythin\' the\'s gone by.\r\nYou wasn\'t fairly responsible. Go right abaout your business an\' you\r\nwon\'t take no hurt."\r\n\r\n"You\'re white," said Dan, as Harvey regained the deck, flushed to the\r\ntips of his ears.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t feel it," said he.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean that way. I heard what Dad said. When Dad allows he\r\ndon\'t think the worse of any man, Dad\'s give himself away. He hates to\r\nbe mistook in his jedgments too. Ho! ho! Onct Dad has a jedgment, he\'d\r\nsooner dip his colours to the British than change it. I\'m glad it\'s\r\nsettled right eend up. Dad\'s right when he says he can\'t take you back.\r\nIt\'s all the livin\' we make here--fishin\'. The men\'ll be back like\r\nsharks after a dead whale in ha\'af an hour."\r\n\r\n"What for?" said Harvey.\r\n\r\n"Supper, o\' course. Don\'t your stummick tell you? You\'ve a heap to\r\nlearn."\r\n\r\n"Guess I have," said Harvey, dolefully, looking at the tangle of ropes\r\nand blocks overhead.\r\n\r\n"She\'s a daisy," said Dan, enthusiastically, misunderstanding the look.\r\n"Wait till our mainsail\'s bent, an\' she walks home with all her salt\r\nwet. There\'s some work first, though." He pointed down into the\r\ndarkness of the open main-hatch between the two masts.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that for? It\'s all empty," said Harvey.\r\n\r\n"You an\' me an\' a few more hev got to fill it," said Dan. "That\'s where\r\nthe fish goes."\r\n\r\n"Alive?" said Harvey.\r\n\r\n"Well, no. They\'re so\'s to be ruther dead--an\' flat--an\' salt. There\'s\r\na hundred hogshead o\' salt in the bins, an\' we hain\'t more\'n covered\r\nour dunnage to now."\r\n\r\n"Where are the fish, though?"\r\n\r\n"\'In the sea they say, in the boats we pray,\'" said Dan, quoting a\r\nfisherman\'s proverb. "You come in last night with \'baout forty of \'em."\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a sort of wooden pen just in front of the quarter-deck.\r\n\r\n"You an\' me we\'ll sluice that out when they\'re through. \'Send we\'ll hev\r\nfull pens to-night! I\'ve seen her down ha\'af a foot with fish waitin\'\r\nto clean, an\' we stood to the tables till we was splittin\' ourselves\r\ninstid o\' them, we was so sleepy. Yes, they\'re comm\' in naow." Dan\r\nlooked over the low bulwarks at half a dozen dories rowing towards them\r\nover the shining, silky sea.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never seen the sea from so low down," said Harvey. "It\'s fine."\r\n\r\nThe low sun made the water all purple and pinkish, with golden lights\r\non the barrels of the long swells, and blue and green mackerel shades\r\nin the hollows. Each schooner in sight seemed to be pulling her dories\r\ntowards her by invisible strings, and the little black figures in the\r\ntiny boats pulled like clockwork toys.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve struck on good," said Dan, between his half-shut eyes. "Manuel\r\nhain\'t room fer another fish. Low ez a lily-pad in still water, Aeneid\r\nhe?"\r\n\r\n"Which is Manuel? I don\'t see how you can tell \'em \'way off, as you do."\r\n\r\n"Last boat to the south\'ard. He fund you last night," said Dan,\r\npointing. "Manuel rows Portugoosey; ye can\'t mistake him. East o\'\r\nhim--he\'s a heap better\'n he rows--is Pennsylvania. Loaded with\r\nsaleratus, by the looks of him. East o\' him--see how pretty they string\r\nout all along--with the humpy shoulders, is Long Jack. He\'s a Galway\r\nman inhabitin\' South Boston, where they all live mostly, an\' mostly\r\nthem Galway men are good in a boat. North, away yonder--you\'ll hear him\r\ntune up in a minute is Tom Platt. Man-o\'-war\'s man he was on the old\r\nOhio first of our navy, he says, to go araound the Horn. He never talks\r\nof much else, \'cept when he sings, but he has fair fishin\' luck. There!\r\nWhat did I tell you?"\r\n\r\nA melodious bellow stole across the water from the northern dory.\r\nHarvey heard something about somebody\'s hands and feet being cold, and\r\nthen:\r\n\r\n  "Bring forth the chart, the doleful chart,\r\n  See where them mountings meet!\r\n  The clouds are thick around their heads,\r\n  The mists around their feet."\r\n\r\n"Full boat," said Dan, with a chuckle. "If he give us \'O Captain\' it\'s\r\ntopping\' too!"\r\n\r\nThe bellow continued:\r\n\r\n  "And naow to thee, O Capting,\r\n  Most earnestly I pray,\r\n  That they shall never bury me\r\n  In church or cloister gray."\r\n\r\n"Double game for Tom Platt. He\'ll tell you all about the old Ohio\r\ntomorrow. \'See that blue dory behind him? He\'s my uncle,--Dad\'s own\r\nbrother,--an\' ef there\'s any bad luck loose on the Banks she\'ll fetch\r\nup agin Uncle Salters, sure. Look how tender he\'s rowin\'. I\'ll lay my\r\nwage and share he\'s the only man stung up to-day--an\' he\'s stung up\r\ngood."\r\n\r\n"What\'ll sting him?" said Harvey, getting interested.\r\n\r\n"Strawberries, mostly. Pumpkins, sometimes, an\' sometimes lemons an\'\r\ncucumbers. Yes, he\'s stung up from his elbows down. That man\'s luck\'s\r\nperfectly paralyzin\'. Naow we\'ll take a-holt o\' the tackles an\' hist\r\n\'em in. Is it true what you told me jest now, that you never done a\r\nhand\'s turn o\' work in all your born life? Must feel kinder awful,\r\ndon\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to try to work, anyway," Harvey replied stoutly. "Only it\'s\r\nall dead new."\r\n\r\n"Lay a-holt o\' that tackle, then. Behind ye!"\r\n\r\nHarvey grabbed at a rope and long iron hook dangling from one of the\r\nstays of the mainmast, while Dan pulled down another that ran from\r\nsomething he called a "topping-lift," as Manuel drew alongside in his\r\nloaded dory. The Portuguese smiled a brilliant smile that Harvey\r\nlearned to know well later, and with a short-handled fork began to\r\nthrow fish into the pen on deck. "Two hundred and thirty-one," he\r\nshouted.\r\n\r\n"Give him the hook," said Dan, and Harvey ran it into Manuel\'s hands.\r\nHe slipped it through a loop of rope at the dory\'s bow, caught Dan\'s\r\ntackle, hooked it to the stern-becket, and clambered into the schooner.\r\n\r\n"Pull!" shouted Dan, and Harvey pulled, astonished to find how easily\r\nthe dory rose.\r\n\r\n"Hold on, she don\'t nest in the crosstrees!" Dan laughed; and Harvey\r\nheld on, for the boat lay in the air above his head.\r\n\r\n"Lower away," Dan shouted, and as Harvey lowered, Dan swayed the light\r\nboat with one hand till it landed softly just behind the mainmast.\r\n"They don\'t weigh nothin\' empty. Thet was right smart fer a passenger.\r\nThere\'s more trick to it in a sea-way."\r\n\r\n"Ah ha!" said Manuel, holding out a brown hand. "You are some pretty\r\nwell now? This time last night the fish they fish for you. Now you fish\r\nfor fish. Eh, wha-at?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m--I\'m ever so grateful," Harvey stammered, and his unfortunate hand\r\nstole to his pocket once more, but he remembered that he had no money\r\nto offer. When he knew Manuel better the mere thought of the mistake he\r\nmight have made would cover him with hot, uneasy blushes in his bunk.\r\n\r\n"There is no to be thankful for to me!" said Manuel. "How shall I leave\r\nyou dreeft, dreeft all around the Banks? Now you are a fisherman eh,\r\nwha-at? Ouh! Auh!" He bent backward and forward stiffly from the hips\r\nto get the kinks out of himself.\r\n\r\n"I have not cleaned boat to-day. Too busy. They struck on queek. Danny,\r\nmy son, clean for me."\r\n\r\nHarvey moved forward at once. Here was something he could do for the\r\nman who had saved his life.\r\n\r\nDan threw him a swab, and he leaned over the dory, mopping up the slime\r\nclumsily, but with great good-will. "Hike out the foot-boards; they\r\nslide in them grooves," said Dan. "Swab \'em an\' lay \'em down. Never let\r\na foot-board jam. Ye may want her bad some day. Here\'s Long Jack."\r\n\r\nA stream of glittering fish flew into the pen from a dory alongside.\r\n\r\n"Manuel, you take the tackle. I\'ll fix the tables. Harvey, clear\r\nManuel\'s boat. Long Jack\'s nestin\' on the top of her."\r\n\r\nHarvey looked up from his swabbing at the bottom of another dory just\r\nabove his head.\r\n\r\n"Jest like the Injian puzzle-boxes, ain\'t they?" said Dan, as the one\r\nboat dropped into the other.\r\n\r\n"Takes to ut like a duck to water," said Long Jack, a grizzly-chinned,\r\nlong-lipped Galway man, bending to and fro exactly as Manuel had done.\r\nDisko in the cabin growled up the hatchway, and they could hear him\r\nsuck his pencil.\r\n\r\n"Wan hunder an\' forty-nine an\' a half-bad luck to ye, Discobolus!" said\r\nLong Jack. "I\'m murderin\' meself to fill your pockuts. Slate ut for a\r\nbad catch. The Portugee has bate me."\r\n\r\nWhack came another dory alongside, and more fish shot into the pen.\r\n\r\n"Two hundred and three. Let\'s look at the passenger!" The speaker was\r\neven larger than the Galway man, and his face was made curious by a\r\npurple cut running slant-ways from his left eye to the right corner of\r\nhis mouth.\r\n\r\nNot knowing what else to do, Harvey swabbed each dory as it came down,\r\npulled out the foot-boards, and laid them in the bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\n"He\'s caught on good," said the scarred man, who was Tom Platt,\r\nwatching him critically. "There are two ways o\' doin\' everything. One\'s\r\nfisher-fashion--any end first an\' a slippery hitch over all--an\' the\r\nother\'s--"\r\n\r\n"What we did on the old Ohio!" Dan interrupted, brushing into the knot\r\nof men with a long board on legs. "Get out o\' here, Tom Platt, an\'\r\nleave me fix the tables."\r\n\r\nHe jammed one end of the board into two nicks in the bulwarks, kicked\r\nout the leg, and ducked just in time to avoid a swinging blow from the\r\nman-o\'-war\'s man.\r\n\r\n"An\' they did that on the Ohio, too, Danny. See?" said Tom Platt,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n"Guess they was swivel-eyed, then, fer it didn\'t git home, and I know\r\nwho\'ll find his boots on the main-truck ef he don\'t leave us alone.\r\nHaul ahead! I\'m busy, can\'t ye see?"\r\n\r\n"Danny, ye lie on the cable an\' sleep all day," said Long Jack. "You\'re\r\nthe hoight av impidence, an\' I\'m persuaded ye\'ll corrupt our supercargo\r\nin a week."\r\n\r\n"His name\'s Harvey," said Dan, waving two strangely shaped knives, "an\'\r\nhe\'ll be worth five of any Sou\' Boston clam-digger \'fore long." He laid\r\nthe knives tastefully on the table, cocked his head on one side, and\r\nadmired the effect.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s forty-two," said a small voice overside, and there was a\r\nroar of laughter as another voice answered, "Then my luck\'s turned fer\r\nonct, \'caze I\'m forty-five, though I be stung outer all shape."\r\n\r\n"Forty-two or forty-five. I\'ve lost count," the small voice said.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Penn an\' Uncle Salters caountin\' catch. This beats the circus any\r\nday," said Dan. "Jest look at \'em!"\r\n\r\n"Come in--come in!" roared Long Jack. "It\'s wet out yondher, children."\r\n\r\n"Forty-two, ye said." This was Uncle Salters.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll count again, then," the voice replied meekly. The two dories\r\nswung together and bunted into the schooner\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Patience o\' Jerusalem!" snapped Uncle Salters, backing water with a\r\nsplash. "What possest a farmer like you to set foot in a boat beats me.\r\nYou\'ve nigh stove me all up."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry, Mr. Salters. I came to sea on account of nervous\r\ndyspepsia. You advised me, I think."\r\n\r\n"You an\' your nervis dyspepsy be drowned in the Whale-hole," roared\r\nUncle Salters, a fat and tubby little man. "You\'re comin\' down on me\r\nagin. Did ye say forty-two or forty-five?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve forgotten, Mr. Salters. Let\'s count."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t see as it could be forty-five. I\'m forty-five," said Uncle\r\nSalters. "You count keerful, Penn."\r\n\r\nDisko Troop came out of the cabin. "Salters, you pitch your fish in\r\nnaow at once," he said in the tone of authority.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t spile the catch, Dad," Dan murmured. "Them two are on\'y jest\r\nbeginnin\'."\r\n\r\n"Mother av delight! He\'s forkin\' them wan by wan," howled Long Jack, as\r\nUncle Salters got to work laboriously; the little man in the other dory\r\ncounting a line of notches on the gunwale.\r\n\r\n"That was last week\'s catch," he said, looking up plaintively, his\r\nforefinger where he had left off.\r\n\r\nManuel nudged Dan, who darted to the after-tackle, and, leaning far\r\noverside, slipped the hook into the stern-rope as Manuel made her fast\r\nforward. The others pulled gallantly and swung the boat in--man, fish,\r\nand all.\r\n\r\n"One, two, four-nine," said Tom Platt, counting with a practised eye.\r\n"Forty-seven. Penn, you\'re it!" Dan let the after-tackle run, and slid\r\nhim out of the stern on to the deck amid a torrent of his own fish.\r\n\r\n"Hold on!" roared Uncle Salters, bobbing by the waist. "Hold on, I\'m a\r\nbit mixed in my caount."\r\n\r\nHe had no time to protest, but was hove inboard and treated like\r\n"Pennsylvania."\r\n\r\n"Forty-one," said Tom Platt. "Beat by a farmer, Salters. An\' you sech a\r\nsailor, too!"\r\n\r\n"\'Tweren\'t fair caount," said he, stumbling out of the pen; "an\' I\'m\r\nstung up all to pieces."\r\n\r\nHis thick hands were puffy and mottled purply white.\r\n\r\n"Some folks will find strawberry-bottom," said Dan, addressing the\r\nnewly risen moon, "ef they hev to dive fer it, seems to me."\r\n\r\n"An\' others," said Uncle Salters, "eats the fat o\' the land in sloth,\r\nan\' mocks their own blood-kin."\r\n\r\n"Seat ye! Seat ye!" a voice Harvey had not heard called from the\r\nfoc\'sle. Disko Troop, Tom Platt, Long Jack, and Salters went forward on\r\nthe word. Little Penn bent above his square deep-sea reel and the\r\ntangled cod-lines; Manuel lay down full length on the deck, and Dan\r\ndropped into the hold, where Harvey heard him banging casks with a\r\nhammer.\r\n\r\n"Salt," he said, returning. "Soon as we\'re through supper we git to\r\ndressing-down. You\'ll pitch to Dad. Tom Platt an\' Dad they stow\r\ntogether, an\' you\'ll hear \'em arguin\'. We\'re second ha\'af, you an\' me\r\nan\' Manuel an\' Penn--the youth an\' beauty o\' the boat."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the good of that?" said Harvey. "I\'m hungry."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be through in a minute. Suff! She smells good to-night. Dad\r\nships a good cook ef he do suffer with his brother. It\'s a full catch\r\ntoday, Aeneid it?" He pointed at the pens piled high with cod. "What\r\nwater did ye hev, Manuel?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty-fife father," said the Portuguese, sleepily. "They strike on\r\ngood an\' queek. Some day I show you, Harvey."\r\n\r\nThe moon was beginning to walk on the still sea before the elder men\r\ncame aft. The cook had no need to cry "second half." Dan and Manuel\r\nwere down the hatch and at table ere Tom Platt, last and most\r\ndeliberate of the elders, had finished wiping his mouth with the back\r\nof his hand. Harvey followed Penn, and sat down before a tin pan of\r\ncod\'s tongues and sounds, mixed with scraps of pork and fried potato, a\r\nloaf of hot bread, and some black and powerful coffee. Hungry as they\r\nwere, they waited while "Pennsylvania" solemnly asked a blessing. Then\r\nthey stoked in silence till Dan drew a breath over his tin cup and\r\ndemanded of Harvey how  he felt.\r\n\r\n"\'Most full, but there\'s just room for another piece."\r\n\r\nThe cook was a huge, jet-black negro, and, unlike all the negroes\r\nHarvey had met, did not talk, contenting himself with smiles and\r\ndumb-show invitations to eat more.\r\n\r\n"See, Harvey," said Dan, rapping with his fork on the table, "it\'s jest\r\nas I said. The young an\' handsome men--like me an\' Pennsy an\' you an\'\r\nManuel--we\'re second ha\'af, an\' we eats when the first ha\'af are\r\nthrough. They\'re the old fish; an\' they\'re mean an\' humpy, an\' their\r\nstummicks has to be humoured; so they come first, which they don\'t\r\ndeserve. Aeneid that so, doctor?"\r\n\r\nThe cook nodded.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t he talk?" said Harvey in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"\'Nough to get along. Not much o\' anything we know. His natural\r\ntongue\'s kinder curious. Comes from the innards of Cape Breton, he\r\ndoes, where the farmers speak homemade Scotch. Cape Breton\'s full o\'\r\nniggers whose folk run in there durin\' aour war, an\' they talk like\r\nfarmers--all huffy-chuffy."\r\n\r\n"That is not Scotch," said "Pennsylvania." "That is Gaelic. So I read\r\nin a book."\r\n\r\n"Penn reads a heap. Most of what he says is so--\'cep\' when it comes to\r\na caount o\' fish--eh?"\r\n\r\n"Does your father just let them say how many they\'ve caught without\r\nchecking them?" said Harvey.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes. Where\'s the sense of a man lyin\' fer a few old cod?"\r\n\r\n"Was a man once lied for his catch," Manuel put in. "Lied every day.\r\nFife, ten, twenty-fife more fish than come he say there was."\r\n\r\n"Where was that?" said Dan. "None o\' aour folk."\r\n\r\n"Frenchman of Anguille."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Them West Shore Frenchmen don\'t caount anyway. Stands to reason\r\nthey can\'t caount. Ef you run acrost any of their soft hooks, Harvey,\r\nyou\'ll know why," said Dan, with an awful contempt.\r\n\r\n    "Always more and never less,\r\n     Every time we come to dress,"\r\n\r\nLong Jack roared down the hatch, and the "second ha\'af" scrambled up at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nThe shadow of the masts and rigging, with the never-furled riding-sail,\r\nrolled to and fro on the heaving deck in the moonlight; and the pile of\r\nfish by the stern shone like a dump of fluid silver. In the hold there\r\nwere tramplings and rumblings where Disko Troop and Tom Platt moved\r\namong the salt-bins. Dan passed Harvey a pitchfork, and led him to the\r\ninboard end of the rough table, where Uncle Salters was drumming\r\nimpatiently with a knife-haft. A tub of salt water lay at his feet.\r\n\r\n"You pitch to dad an\' Tom Platt down the hatch, an\' take keer Uncle\r\nSalters don\'t cut yer eye out," said Dan, swinging himself into the\r\nhold. "I\'ll pass salt below."\r\n\r\nPenn and Manuel stood knee deep among cod in the pen, flourishing drawn\r\nknives. Long Jack, a basket at his feet and mittens on his hands, faced\r\nUncle Salters at the table, and Harvey stared at the pitchfork and the\r\ntub.\r\n\r\n"Hi!" shouted Manuel, stooping to the fish, and bringing one up with a\r\nfinger under its gill and a finger in its eyes. He laid it on the edge\r\nof the pen; the knife-blade glimmered with a sound of tearing, and the\r\nfish, slit from throat to vent, with a nick on either side of the neck,\r\ndropped at Long Jack\'s feet.\r\n\r\n"Hi!" said Long Jack, with a scoop of his mittened hand. The cod\'s\r\nliver dropped in the basket. Another wrench and scoop sent the head and\r\noffal flying, and the empty fish slid across to Uncle Salters, who\r\nsnorted fiercely. There was another sound of tearing, the backbone flew\r\nover the bulwarks, and the fish, headless, gutted, and open, splashed\r\nin the tub, sending the salt water into Harvey\'s astonished mouth.\r\nAfter the first yell, the men were silent. The cod moved along as\r\nthough they were alive, and long ere Harvey had ceased wondering at the\r\nmiraculous dexterity of it all, his tub was full.\r\n\r\n"Pitch!" grunted Uncle Salters, without turning his head, and Harvey\r\npitched the fish by twos and threes down the hatch.\r\n\r\n"Hi! Pitch \'em bunchy," shouted Dan. "Don\'t scatter! Uncle Salters is\r\nthe best splitter in the fleet. Watch him mind his book!"\r\n\r\nIndeed, it looked a little as though the round uncle were cutting\r\nmagazine pages against time. Manuel\'s body, cramped over from the hips,\r\nstayed like a statue; but his long arms grabbed the fish without\r\nceasing. Little Penn toiled valiantly, but it was easy to see he was\r\nweak. Once or twice Manuel found time to help him without breaking the\r\nchain of supplies, and once Manuel howled because he had caught his\r\nfinger in a Frenchman\'s hook. These hooks are made of soft metal, to be\r\nrebent after use; but the cod very often get away with them and are\r\nhooked again elsewhere; and that is one of the many reasons why the\r\nGloucester boats despise the Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nDown below, the rasping sound of rough salt rubbed on rough flesh\r\nsounded like the whirring of a grindstone--steady undertune to the\r\n"click-nick" of knives in the pen; the wrench and shloop of torn heads,\r\ndropped liver, and flying offal; the "caraaah" of Uncle Salters\'s knife\r\nscooping away backbones; and the flap of wet, open bodies falling into\r\nthe tub.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour Harvey would have given the world to rest; for\r\nfresh, wet cod weigh more than you would think, and his back ached with\r\nthe steady pitching. But he felt for the first time in his life that he\r\nwas one of the working gang of men, took pride in the thought, and held\r\non sullenly.\r\n\r\n"Knife oh!" shouted Uncle Salters at last. Penn doubled up, gasping\r\namong the fish, Manuel bowed back and forth to supple himself, and Long\r\nJack leaned over the bulwarks. The cook appeared, noiseless as a black\r\nshadow, collected a mass of backbones and heads, and retreated.\r\n\r\n"Blood-ends for breakfast an\' head-chowder," said Long Jack, smacking\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n"Knife oh!" repeated Uncle Salters, waving the flat, curved splitter\'s\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\n"Look by your foot, Harve," cried Dan below.\r\n\r\nHarvey saw half a dozen knives stuck in a cleat in the hatch combing.\r\nHe dealt these around, taking over the dulled ones.\r\n\r\n"Water!" said Disko Troop.\r\n\r\n"Scuttle-butt\'s for\'ard an\' the dipper\'s alongside. Hurry, Harve," said\r\nDan.\r\n\r\nHe was back in a minute with a big dipperful of stale brown water which\r\ntasted like nectar, and loosed the jaws of Disko and Tom Platt.\r\n\r\n"These are cod," said Disko. "They ain\'t Damarskus figs, Tom Platt, nor\r\nyet silver bars. I\'ve told you that ever single time since we\'ve sailed\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"A matter o\' seven seasons," returned Tom Platt coolly. "Good stowin\'s\r\ngood stowin\' all the same, an\' there\'s a right an\' a wrong way o\'\r\nstowin\' ballast even. If you\'d ever seen four hundred ton o\' iron set\r\ninto the--"\r\n\r\n"Hi!" With a yell from Manuel the work began again, and never stopped\r\ntill the pen was empty. The instant the last fish was down, Disko Troop\r\nrolled aft to the cabin with his brother; Manuel and Long Jack went\r\nforward; Tom Platt only waited long enough to slide home the hatch ere\r\nhe too disappeared. In half a minute Harvey heard deep snores in the\r\ncabin, and he was staring blankly at Dan and Penn.\r\n\r\n"I did a little better that time, Danny," said Penn, whose eyelids were\r\nheavy with sleep. "But I think it is my duty to help clean."\r\n\r\n"\'Wouldn\'t hev your conscience fer a thousand quintal," said Dan. "Turn\r\nin, Penn. You\'ve no call to do boy\'s work. Draw a bucket, Harvey. Oh,\r\nPenn, dump these in the gurry-butt \'fore you sleep. Kin you keep awake\r\nthat long?"\r\n\r\nPenn took up the heavy basket of fish-livers, emptied them into a cask\r\nwith a hinged top lashed by the foc\'sle; then he too dropped out of\r\nsight in the cabin.\r\n\r\n"Boys clean up after dressin\' down an\' first watch in ca\'am weather is\r\nboy\'s watch on the _We\'re Here_." Dan sluiced the pen energetically,\r\nunshipped the table, set it up to dry in the moonlight, ran the red\r\nknife-blades through a wad of oakum, and began to sharpen them on a\r\ntiny grindstone, as Harvey threw offal and backbones overboard under\r\nhis direction.\r\n\r\nAt the first splash a silvery-white ghost rose bolt upright from the\r\noily water and sighed a weird whistling sigh. Harvey started back with\r\na shout, but Dan only laughed.\r\n\r\n"Grampus," said he. "Beggin\' fer fish-heads. They up-eend the way when\r\nthey\'re hungry. Breath on him like the doleful tombs, hain\'t he?" A\r\nhorrible stench of decayed fish filled the air as the pillar of white\r\nsank, and the water bubbled oilily. "Hain\'t ye never seen a grampus\r\nup-eend before? You\'ll see \'em by hundreds \'fore ye\'re through. Say,\r\nit\'s good to hev a boy aboard again. Otto was too old, an\' a Dutchy at\r\nthat. Him an\' me we fought consid\'ble. \'Wouldn\'t ha\' keered fer that ef\r\nhe\'d hed a Christian tongue in his head. Sleepy?"\r\n\r\n"Dead sleepy," said Harvey, nodding forward.\r\n\r\n"Mustn\'t sleep on watch. Rouse up an\' see ef our anchor-light\'s bright\r\nan\' shinin\'. You\'re on watch now, Harve."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! What\'s to hurt us? Bright\'s day. Sn-orrr!"\r\n\r\n"Jest when things happen, Dad says. Fine weather\'s good sleepin\', an\'\r\n\'fore you know, mebbe, you\'re cut in two by a liner, an\' seventeen\r\nbrass-bound officers, all gen\'elmen, lift their hand to it that your\r\nlights was aout an\' there was a thick fog. Harve, I\'ve kinder took to\r\nyou, but ef you nod onct more I\'ll lay into you with a rope\'s end."\r\n\r\nThe moon, who sees many strange things on the Banks, looked down on a\r\nslim youth in knickerbockers and a red jersey, staggering around the\r\ncluttered decks of a seventy-ton schooner, while behind him, waving a\r\nknotted rope, walked, after the manner of an executioner, a boy who\r\nyawned and nodded between the blows he dealt.\r\n\r\nThe lashed wheel groaned and kicked softly, the riding-sail slatted a\r\nlittle in the shifts of the light wind, the windlass creaked, and the\r\nmiserable procession continued. Harvey expostulated, threatened,\r\nwhimpered, and at last wept outright, while Dan, the words clotting on\r\nhis tongue, spoke of the beauty of watchfulness and slashed away with\r\nthe rope\'s end, punishing the dories as often as he hit Harvey. At last\r\nthe clock in the cabin struck ten, and upon the tenth stroke little\r\nPenn crept on deck. He found two boys in two tumbled heaps side by side\r\non the main hatch, so deeply asleep that he actually rolled them to\r\ntheir berths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER  III\r\n\r\nIt was the forty-fathom slumber that clears the soul and eye and heart,\r\nand sends you to breakfast ravening. They emptied a big tin dish of\r\njuicy fragments of fish--the blood-ends the cook had collected\r\novernight. They cleaned up the plates and pans of the elder mess, who\r\nwere out fishing, sliced pork for the midday meal, swabbed down the\r\nfoc\'sle, filled the lamps, drew coal and water for the cook, and\r\ninvestigated the fore-hold, where the boat\'s stores were stacked. It\r\nwas another perfect day--soft, mild, and clear; and Harvey breathed to\r\nthe very bottom of his lungs.\r\n\r\nMore schooners had crept up in the night, and the long blue seas were\r\nfull of sails and dories. Far away on the horizon, the smoke of some\r\nliner, her hull invisible, smudged the blue, and to eastward a big\r\nship\'s top-gallant sails, just lifting, made a square nick in it. Disko\r\nTroop was smoking by the roof of the cabin--one eye on the craft\r\naround, and the other on the little fly at the main-mast-head.\r\n\r\n"When Dad kerflummoxes that way," said Dan in a whisper, "he\'s doin\'\r\nsome high-line thinkin\' fer all hands. I\'ll lay my wage an\' share we\'ll\r\nmake berth soon. Dad he knows the cod, an\' the Fleet they know Dad\r\nknows. \'See \'em comm\' up one by one, lookin\' fer nothin\' in particular,\r\no\' course, but scrowgin\' on us all the time? There\'s the _Prince Leboo_;\r\nshe\'s a Chat-ham boat. She\'s crep\' up sence last night. An\' see that\r\nbig one with a patch in her foresail an\' a new jib? She\'s the _Carrie\r\nPitman_ from West Chat-ham. She won\'t keep her canvas long onless her\r\nluck\'s changed since last season. She don\'t do much \'cep\' drift. There\r\nain\'t an anchor made \'ll hold her. . . . When the smoke puffs up in\r\nlittle rings like that, Dad\'s studyin\' the fish. Ef we speak to him\r\nnow, he\'ll git mad. Las\' time I did, he jest took an\' hove a boot at\r\nme."\r\n\r\nDisko Troop stared forward, the pipe between his teeth, with eyes that\r\nsaw nothing. As his son said, he was studying the fish--pitting his\r\nknowledge and experience on the Banks against the roving cod in his own\r\nsea. He accepted the presence of the inquisitive schooners on the\r\nhorizon as a compliment to his powers. But now that it was paid, he\r\nwished to draw away and make his berth alone, till it was time to go up\r\nto the Virgin and fish in the streets of that roaring town upon the\r\nwaters. So Disko Troop thought of recent weather, and gales, currents,\r\nfood-supplies, and other domestic arrangements, from the point of view\r\nof a twenty-pound cod; was, in fact, for an hour a cod himself, and\r\nlooked remarkably like one. Then he removed the pipe from his teeth.\r\n\r\n"Dad," said Dan, "we\'ve done our chores. Can\'t we go overside a piece?\r\nIt\'s good catchin\' weather."\r\n\r\n"Not in that cherry-coloured rig ner them ha\'af baked brown shoes. Give\r\nhim suthin\' fit to wear."\r\n\r\n"Dad\'s pleased--that settles it," said Dan, delightedly, dragging\r\nHarvey into the cabin, while Troop pitched a key down the steps. "Dad\r\nkeeps my spare rig where he kin overhaul it, \'cause Ma sez I\'m\r\nkeerless." He rummaged through a locker, and in less than three minutes\r\nHarvey was adorned with fisherman\'s rubber boots that came half up his\r\nthigh, a heavy blue jersey well darned at the elbows, a pair of\r\nnippers, and a sou\'wester.\r\n\r\n"Naow ye look somethin\' like," said Dan. "Hurry!"\r\n\r\n"Keep nigh an\' handy," said Troop "an\' don\'t go visitin\' raound the\r\nFleet. If any one asks you what I\'m cal\'latin\' to do, speak the\r\ntruth--fer ye don\'t know."\r\n\r\nA little red dory, labelled Hattie S., lay astern of the schooner. Dan\r\nhauled in the painter, and dropped lightly on to the bottom boards,\r\nwhile Harvey tumbled clumsily after.\r\n\r\n"That\'s no way o\' gettin\' into a boat," said Dan. "Ef there was any sea\r\nyou\'d go to the bottom, sure. You got to learn to meet her."\r\n\r\nDan fitted the thole-pins, took the forward thwart and watched Harvey\'s\r\nwork. The boy had rowed, in a lady-like fashion, on the Adirondack\r\nponds; but there is a difference between squeaking pins and\r\nwell-balanced ruflocks--light sculls and stubby, eight-foot sea-oars.\r\nThey stuck in the gentle swell, and Harvey grunted.\r\n\r\n"Short! Row short!" said Dan. "Ef you cramp your oar in any kind o\' sea\r\nyou\'re liable to turn her over. Ain\'t she a daisy? Mine, too."\r\n\r\nThe little dory was specklessly clean. In her bows lay a tiny anchor,\r\ntwo jugs of water, and some seventy fathoms of thin, brown dory-roding.\r\nA tin dinner-horn rested in cleats just under Harvey\'s right hand,\r\nbeside an ugly-looking maul, a short gaff, and a shorter wooden stick.\r\nA couple of lines, with very heavy leads and double cod-hooks, all\r\nneatly coiled on square reels, were stuck in their place by the gunwale.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the sail and mast?" said Harvey, for his hands were beginning\r\nto blister.\r\n\r\nDan chuckled. "Ye don\'t sail fishin\'-dories much. Ye pull; but ye\r\nneedn\'t pull so hard. Don\'t you wish you owned her?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess my father might give me one or two if I asked \'em,"\r\nHarvey replied. He had been too busy to think much of his family till\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n"That\'s so. I forgot your dad\'s a millionaire. You don\'t act millionary\r\nany, naow. But a dory an\' craft an\' gear"--Dan spoke as though she were\r\na whaleboat--"costs a heap. Think your dad \'u\'d give you one fer--fer a\r\npet like?"\r\n\r\n"Shouldn\'t wonder. It would be \'most the only thing I haven\'t stuck him\r\nfor yet."\r\n\r\n"Must be an expensive kinder kid to home. Don\'t slitheroo thet way,\r\nHarve. Short\'s the trick, because no sea\'s ever dead still, an\' the\r\nswells \'ll--"\r\n\r\nCrack! The loom of the oar kicked Harvey under the chin and knocked him\r\nbackwards.\r\n\r\n"That was what I was goin\' to say. I hed to learn too, but I wasn\'t\r\nmore than eight years old when I got my schoolin\'."\r\n\r\nHarvey regained his seat with aching jaws and a frown.\r\n\r\n"No good gettin\' mad at things, Dad says. It\'s our own fault ef we\r\ncan\'t handle \'em, he says. Le\'s try here. Manuel \'ll give us the water."\r\n\r\nThe "Portugee" was rocking fully a mile away, but when Dan up-ended an\r\noar he waved his left arm three times.\r\n\r\n"Thirty fathom," said Dan, stringing a salt clam on to the hook. "Over\r\nwith the doughboys. Bait same\'s I do, Harvey, an\' don\'t snarl your\r\nreel."\r\n\r\nDan\'s line was out long before Harvey had mastered the mystery of\r\nbaiting and heaving out the leads. The dory drifted along easily. It\r\nwas not worth while to anchor till they were sure of good ground.\r\n\r\n"Here we come!" Dan shouted, and a shower of spray rattled on Harvey\'s\r\nshoulders as a big cod flapped and kicked alongside. "Muckle, Harvey,\r\nmuckle! Under your hand! Quick!"\r\n\r\nEvidently "muckle" could not be the dinner-horn, so Harvey passed over\r\nthe maul, and Dan scientifically stunned the fish before he pulled it\r\ninboard, and wrenched out the hook with the short wooden stick he\r\ncalled a "gob-stick." Then Harvey felt a tug, and pulled up zealously.\r\n\r\n"Why, these are strawberries!" he shouted. "Look!"\r\n\r\nThe hook had fouled among a bunch of strawberries, red on one side and\r\nwhite on the other--perfect reproductions of the land fruit, except\r\nthat there were no leaves, and the stem was all pipy and slimy.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tech \'em. Slat \'em off. Don\'t--"\r\n\r\nThe warning came too late. Harvey had picked them from the hook, and\r\nwas admiring them.\r\n\r\n"Ouch!" he cried, for his fingers throbbed as though he had grasped\r\nmany nettles.\r\n\r\n"Now ye know what strawberry-bottom means. Nothin\' \'cep\' fish should be\r\nteched with the naked fingers, Dad says. Slat \'em off agin the gunnel,\r\nan\' bait up, Harve. Lookin\' won\'t help any. It\'s all in the wages."\r\n\r\nHarvey smiled at the thought of his ten and a half dollars a month, and\r\nwondered what his mother would say if she could see him hanging over\r\nthe edge of a fishing-dory in mid-ocean. She suffered agonies whenever\r\nhe went out on Saranac Lake; and, by the way, Harvey remembered\r\ndistinctly that he used to laugh at her anxieties. Suddenly the line\r\nflashed through his hand, stinging even through the "nippers," the\r\nwoolen circlets supposed to protect it.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a logy. Give him room accordin\' to his strength," cried Dan.\r\n"I\'ll help ye."\r\n\r\n"No, you won\'t," Harvey snapped, as he hung on to the line. "It\'s my\r\nfirst fish. Is--is it a whale?"\r\n\r\n"Halibut, mebbe." Dan peered down into the water alongside, and\r\nflourished the big "muckle," ready for all chances. Something white and\r\noval flickered and fluttered through the green. "I\'ll lay my wage an\'\r\nshare he\'s over a hundred. Are you so everlastin\' anxious to land him\r\nalone?"\r\n\r\nHarvey\'s knuckles were raw and bleeding where they had been banged\r\nagainst the gunwale; his face was purple-blue between excitement and\r\nexertion; he dripped with sweat, and was half-blinded from staring at\r\nthe circling sunlit ripples about the swiftly moving line. The boys\r\nwere tired long ere the halibut, who took charge of them and the dory\r\nfor the next twenty minutes. But the big flat fish was gaffed and\r\nhauled in at last.\r\n\r\n"Beginner\'s luck," said Dan, wiping his forehead. "He\'s all of a\r\nhundred."\r\n\r\nHarvey looked at the huge gray-and-mottled creature with unspeakable\r\npride. He had seen halibut many times on marble slabs ashore, but it\r\nhad never occurred to him to ask how they came inland. Now he knew; and\r\nevery inch of his body ached with fatigue.\r\n\r\n"Ef Dad was along," said Dan, hauling up, "he\'d read the signs plain\'s\r\nprint. The fish are runnin\' smaller an\' smaller, an\' you\'ve took \'baout\r\nas logy a halibut\'s we\'re apt to find this trip. Yesterday\'s catch--did\r\nye notice it?--was all big fish an\' no halibut. Dad he\'d read them\r\nsigns right off. Dad says everythin\' on the Banks is signs, an\' can be\r\nread wrong er right. Dad\'s deeper\'n the Whale-hole."\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke some one fired a pistol on the _We\'re Here_, and a\r\npotato-basket was run up in the fore-rigging.\r\n\r\n"What did I say, naow? That\'s the call fer the whole crowd. Dad\'s onter\r\nsomething, er he\'d never break fishin\' this time o\' day. Reel up,\r\nHarve, an\' we\'ll pull back."\r\n\r\nThey were to windward of the schooner, just ready to flirt the dory\r\nover the still sea, when sounds of woe half a mile off led them to\r\nPenn, who was careering around a fixed point for all the world like a\r\ngigantic water-bug. The little man backed away and came down again with\r\nenormous energy, but at the end of each maneuver his dory swung round\r\nand snubbed herself on her rope.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll hev to help him, else he\'ll root an\' seed here," said Dan.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" said Harvey. This was a new world, where he could\r\nnot lay down the law to his elders, but had to ask questions humbly.\r\nAnd the sea was horribly big and unexcited.\r\n\r\n"Anchor\'s fouled. Penn\'s always losing \'em. Lost two this trip\r\na\'ready--on sandy bottom too--an\' Dad says next one he loses, sure\'s\r\nfishin\', he\'ll give him the kelleg. That \'u\'d break Penn\'s heart."\r\n\r\n"What\'s a \'kelleg\'?" said Harvey, who had a vague idea it might be some\r\nkind of marine torture, like keel-hauling in the storybooks.\r\n\r\n"Big stone instid of an anchor. You kin see a kelleg ridin\' in the bows\r\nfur\'s you can see a dory, an\' all the fleet knows what it means. They\'d\r\nguy him dreadful. Penn couldn\'t stand that no more\'n a dog with a\r\ndipper to his tail. He\'s so everlastin\' sensitive. Hello, Penn! Stuck\r\nagain? Don\'t try any more o\' your patents. Come up on her, and keep\r\nyour rodin\' straight up an\' down."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t move," said the little man, panting. "It doesn\'t move at\r\nall, and instead I tried everything."\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this hurrah\'s-nest for\'ard?" said Dan, pointing to a wild\r\ntangle of spare oars and dory-roding, all matted together by the hand\r\nof inexperience.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that," said Penn proudly, "is a Spanish windlass. Mr. Salters\r\nshowed me how to make it; but even that doesn\'t move her."\r\n\r\nDan bent low over the gunwale to hide a smile, twitched once or twice\r\non the roding, and, behold, the anchor drew at once.\r\n\r\n"Haul up, Penn," he said laughing, "er she\'ll git stuck again."\r\n\r\nThey left him regarding the weed-hung flukes of the little anchor with\r\nbig, pathetic blue eyes, and thanking them profusely.\r\n\r\n"Oh, say, while I think of it, Harve," said Dan when they were out of\r\near-shot, "Penn ain\'t quite all caulked. He ain\'t nowise dangerous, but\r\nhis mind\'s give out. See?"\r\n\r\n"Is that so, or is it one of your father\'s judgments?"\r\n\r\nHarvey asked as he bent to his oars. He felt he was learning to handle\r\nthem more easily.\r\n\r\n"Dad ain\'t mistook this time. Penn\'s a sure \'nuff loony."\r\n\r\n"No, he ain\'t thet exactly, so much ez a harmless ijut. It was this way\r\n(you\'re rowin\' quite so, Harve), an\' I  tell you \'cause it\'s right you\r\norter know. He was a Moravian preacher once. Jacob Boiler wuz his name,\r\nDad told me, an\' he lived with his wife an\' four children somewheres\r\nout Pennsylvania way. Well, Penn he took his folks along to a Moravian\r\nmeetin\'--camp-meetin\' most like--an\' they stayed over jest one night in\r\nJohns-town. You\'ve heered talk o\' Johnstown?"\r\n\r\nHarvey considered. "Yes, I have. But I don\'t know why. It sticks in my\r\nhead same as Ashtabula."\r\n\r\n"Both was big accidents--thet\'s why, Harve. Well, that one single night\r\nPenn and his folks was to the hotel Johnstown was wiped out. \'Dam bust\r\nan\' flooded her, an\' the houses struck adrift an\' bumped into each\r\nother an\' sunk. I\'ve seen the pictures, an\' they\'re dretful. Penn he\r\nsaw his folk drowned all\'n a heap \'fore he rightly knew what was\r\ncomin\'. His mind give out from that on. He mistrusted somethin\' hed\r\nhappened up to Johnstown, but for the poor life of him he couldn\'t\r\nremember what, an\' he jest drifted araound smilin\' an\' wonderin\'. He\r\ndidn\'t know what he was, nor yit what he hed bin, an\' thet way he run\r\nagin Uncle Salters, who was visitin\' \'n Allegheny City. Ha\'af my\r\nmother\'s folks they live scattered inside o\' Pennsylvania, an\' Uncle\r\nSalters he visits araound winters. Uncle Salters he kinder adopted\r\nPenn, well knowin\' what his trouble wuz; an\' he brought him East, an\'\r\nhe give him work on his farm."\r\n\r\n"Why, I heard him calling Penn a farmer last night when the boats\r\nbumped. Is your Uncle Salters a farmer?"\r\n\r\n"Farmer!" shouted Dan. "There ain\'t water enough \'tween here an\'\r\nHatt\'rus to wash the furrer-mold off\'n his boots. He\'s jest everlastin\'\r\nfarmer. Why, Harve, I\'ve seen thet man hitch up a bucket, long towards\r\nsundown, an\' set twiddlin\' the spigot to the scuttle-butt same\'s ef\r\n\'twas a cow\'s bag. He\'s thet much farmer. Well, Penn an\' he they ran\r\nthe farm--up Exeter way \'twur. Uncle Salters he sold it this spring to\r\na jay from Boston as wanted to build a summer-haouse, an\' he got a heap\r\nfor it. Well, them two loonies scratched along till, one day, Penn\'s\r\nchurch--he\'d belonged to the Moravians--found out where he wuz drifted\r\nan\' layin\', an\' wrote to Uncle Salters. \'Never heerd what they said\r\nexactly; but Uncle Salters was mad. He\'s a \'piscopolian mostly--but he\r\njest let \'em hev it both sides o\' the bow, \'s if he was a Baptist; an\'\r\nsez he warn\'t goin\' to give up Penn to any blame Moravian connection in\r\nPennsylvania or anywheres else. Then he come to Dad, towin\' Penn,--thet\r\nwas two trips back,--an\' sez he an\' Penn must fish a trip fer their\r\nhealth. \'Guess he thought the Moravians wouldn\'t hunt the Banks fer\r\nJacob Boiler. Dad was agreeable, fer Uncle Salters he\'d been fishin\'\r\noff an\' on fer thirty years, when he warn\'t inventin\' patent manures,\r\nan\' he took quarter-share in the _We\'re Here_; an\' the trip done Penn\r\nso much good, Dad made a habit o\' takin\' him. Some day, Dad sez, he\'ll\r\nremember his wife an\' kids an\' Johnstown, an\' then, like as not, he\'ll\r\ndie, Dad sez. Don\'t ye talk abaout Johnstown ner such things to Penn,\r\n\'r Uncle Salters he\'ll heave ye overboard."\r\n\r\n"Poor Penn!" murmured Harvey. "I shouldn\'t ever have thought Uncle\r\nSalters cared for him by the look of \'em together."\r\n\r\n"I like Penn, though; we all do," said Dan. "We ought to ha\' give him a\r\ntow, but I wanted to tell ye first."\r\n\r\nThey were close to the schooner now, the other boats a little behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t heave in the dories till after dinner," said Troop from\r\nthe deck. "We\'ll dress daown right off. Fix table, boys!"\r\n\r\n"Deeper\'n the Whale-deep," said Dan, with a wink, as he set the gear\r\nfor dressing down. "Look at them boats that hev edged up sence mornin\'.\r\nThey\'re all waitin\' on Dad. See \'em, Harve?"\r\n\r\n"They are all alike to me." And indeed to a landsman, the nodding\r\nschooners around seemed run from the same mold.\r\n\r\n"They ain\'t, though. That yaller, dirty packet with her bowsprit\r\nsteeved that way, she\'s the Hope of Prague. Nick Brady\'s her skipper,\r\nthe meanest man on the Banks. We\'ll tell him so when we strike the Main\r\nLedge. \'Way off yonder\'s the Day\'s Eye. The two Jeraulds own her. She\'s\r\nfrom Harwich; fastish, too, an\' hez good luck; but Dad he\'d find fish\r\nin a graveyard. Them other three, side along, they\'re the Margie Smith,\r\nRose, and Edith S. Walen, all from home. \'Guess we\'ll see the Abbie M.\r\nDeering to-morrer, Dad, won\'t we? They\'re all slippin\' over from the\r\nshaol o\' \'Oueereau."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t see many boats to-morrow, Danny." When Troop called his son\r\nDanny, it was a sign that the old man was pleased. "Boys, we\'re too\r\ncrowded," he went on, addressing the crew as they clambered inboard.\r\n"We\'ll leave \'em to bait big an\' catch small." He looked at the catch\r\nin the pen, and it was curious to see how little and level the fish\r\nran. Save for Harvey\'s halibut, there was nothing over fifteen pounds\r\non deck.\r\n\r\n"I\'m waitin\' on the weather," he added.\r\n\r\n"Ye\'ll have to make it yourself, Disko, for there\'s no sign I can see,"\r\nsaid Long Jack, sweeping the clear horizon.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, half an hour later, as they were dressing down, the Bank fog\r\ndropped on them, "between fish and fish," as they say. It drove\r\nsteadily and in wreaths, curling and smoking along the colourless\r\nwater. The men stopped dressing-down without a word. Long Jack and\r\nUncle Salters slipped the windlass brakes into their sockets, and began\r\nto heave up the anchor; the windlass jarring as the wet hempen cable\r\nstrained on the barrel. Manuel and Tom Platt gave a hand at the last.\r\nThe anchor came up with a sob, and the riding-sail bellied as Troop\r\nsteadied her at the wheel. "Up jib and foresail," said he.\r\n\r\n"Slip \'em in the smother," shouted Long Jack, making fast the\r\njib-sheet, while the others raised the clacking, rattling rings of the\r\nforesail; and the foreboom creaked as the _We\'re Here_ looked up into\r\nthe wind and dived off into blank, whirling white.\r\n\r\n"There\'s wind behind this fog," said Troop.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful beyond words to Harvey; and the most wonderful part\r\nwas that he heard no orders except an occasional grunt from Troop,\r\nending with, "That\'s good, my son!"\r\n\r\n"Never seen anchor weighed before?" said Tom Platt, to Harvey gaping at\r\nthe damp canvas of the foresail.\r\n\r\n"No. Where are we going?"\r\n\r\n"Fish and make berth, as you\'ll find out \'fore you\'ve been a week\r\naboard. It\'s all new to you, but we never know what may come to us.\r\nNow, take me--Tom Platt--I\'d never ha\' thought--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s better than fourteen dollars a month an\' a bullet in your belly,"\r\nsaid Troop, from the wheel. "Ease your jumbo a grind."\r\n\r\n"Dollars an\' cents better," returned the man-o\'-war\'s man, doing\r\nsomething to a big jib with a wooden spar tied to it. "But we didn\'t\r\nthink o\' that when we manned the windlass-brakes on the Miss Jim Buck,\r\nI outside Beau-fort Harbor, with Fort Macon heavin\' hot shot at our\r\nstern, an\' a livin\' gale atop of all. Where was you then, Disko?"\r\n\r\n"Jest here, or hereabouts," Disko replied, "earnin\' my bread on the\r\ndeep waters, an\' dodgin\' Reb privateers. Sorry I can\'t accommodate you\r\nwith red-hot shot, Tom Platt; but I guess we\'ll come aout all right on\r\nwind \'fore we see Eastern Point."\r\n\r\nThere was an incessant slapping and chatter at the bows now, varied by\r\na solid thud and a little spout of spray that clattered down on the\r\nfoc\'sle. The rigging dripped clammy drops, and the men lounged along\r\nthe lee of the house--all save Uncle Salters, who sat stiffly on the\r\nmain-hatch nursing his stung hands.\r\n\r\n"Guess she\'d carry stays\'l," said Disko, rolling one eye at his brother.\r\n\r\n"Guess she wouldn\'t to any sorter profit. What\'s the sense o\' wastin\'\r\ncanvas?" the farmer-sailor replied.\r\n\r\nThe wheel twitched almost imperceptibly in Disko\'s hands. A few seconds\r\nlater a hissing wave-top slashed diagonally across the boat, smote\r\nUncle Salters between the shoulders, and drenched him from head to\r\nfoot. He rose sputtering, and went forward only to catch another.\r\n\r\n"See Dad chase him all around the deck," said Dan. "Uncle Salters he\r\nthinks his quarter share\'s our canvas. Dad\'s put this duckin\' act up on\r\nhim two trips runnin\'. Hi! That found him where he feeds." Uncle\r\nSalters had taken refuge by the foremast, but a wave slapped him over\r\nthe knees. Disko\'s face was as blank as the circle of the wheel.\r\n\r\n"Guess she\'d lie easier under stays\'l, Salters," said Disko, as though\r\nhe had seen nothing.\r\n\r\n"Set your old kite, then," roared the victim through a cloud of spray;\r\n"only don\'t lay it to me if anything happens. Penn, you go below right\r\noff an\' git your coffee. You ought to hev more sense than to bum\r\naraound on deck this weather."\r\n\r\n"Now they\'ll swill coffee an\' play checkers till the cows come home,"\r\nsaid Dan, as Uncle Salters hustled Penn into the fore-cabin. "\'Looks to\r\nme like\'s if we\'d all be doin\' so fer a spell. There\'s nothin\' in\r\ncreation deader-limpsey-idler\'n a Banker when she ain\'t on fish."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad ye spoke, Danny," cried Long Jack, who had been casting round\r\nin search of amusement. "I\'d clean forgot we\'d a passenger under that\r\nT-wharf hat. There\'s no idleness for thim that don\'t know their ropes.\r\nPass him along, Tom Platt, an\' we\'ll larn him."\r\n\r\n"\'Tain\'t my trick this time," grinned Dan. "You\'ve got to go it alone.\r\nDad learned me with a rope\'s end."\r\n\r\nFor an hour Long Jack walked his prey up and down, teaching, as he\r\nsaid, "things at the sea that ivry man must know, blind, dhrunk, or\r\nasleep." There is not much gear to a seventy-ton schooner with a\r\nstump-foremast, but Long Jack had a gift of expression. When he wished\r\nto draw Harvey\'s attention to the peak-halyards, he dug his knuckles\r\ninto the back of the boy\'s neck and kept him at gaze for half a minute.\r\nHe emphasized the difference between fore and aft generally by rubbing\r\nHarvey\'s nose along a few feet of the boom, and the lead of each rope\r\nwas fixed in Harvey\'s mind by the end of the rope itself.\r\n\r\nThe lesson would have been easier had the deck been at all free; but\r\nthere appeared to be a place on it for everything and anything except a\r\nman. Forward lay the windlass and its tackle, with the chain and hemp\r\ncables, all very unpleasant to trip over; the foc\'sle stovepipe, and\r\nthe gurry-butts by the foc\'sle hatch to hold the fish-livers. Aft of\r\nthese the foreboom and booby of the main-hatch took all the space that\r\nwas not needed for the pumps and dressing-pens. Then came the nests of\r\ndories lashed to ring-bolts by the quarter-deck; the house, with tubs\r\nand oddments lashed all around it; and, last, the sixty-foot main-boom\r\nin its crutch, splitting things length-wise, to duck and dodge under\r\nevery time.\r\n\r\nTom Platt, of course, could not keep his oar out of the business, but\r\nranged alongside with enormous and unnecessary descriptions of sails\r\nand spars on the old Ohio.\r\n\r\n"Niver mind fwhat he says; attind to me, Innocince. Tom Platt, this\r\nbally-hoo\'s not the Ohio, an\' you\'re mixing the bhoy bad."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be ruined for life, beginnin\' on a fore-an\'-after this way," Tom\r\nPlatt pleaded. "Give him a chance to know a few leadin\' principles.\r\nSailin\'s an art, Harvey, as I\'d show you if I had ye in the fore-top o\'\r\nthe--"\r\n\r\n"I know ut. Ye\'d talk him dead an\' cowld. Silince, Tom Platt! Now,\r\nafter all I\'ve said, how\'d you reef the foresail, Harve? Take your time\r\nanswerin\'."\r\n\r\n"Haul that in," said Harvey, pointing to leeward.\r\n\r\n"Fwhat? The North Atlantuc?"\r\n\r\n"No, the boom. Then run that rope you showed me back there--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s no way," Tom Platt burst in.\r\n\r\n"Quiet! He\'s larnin\', an\' has not the names good yet. Go on, Harve."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s the reef-pennant. I\'d hook the tackle on to the reef-pennant,\r\nand then let down--"\r\n\r\n"Lower the sail, child! Lower!" said Tom Platt, in a professional agony.\r\n\r\n"Lower the throat and peak halyards," Harvey went on. Those names stuck\r\nin his head.\r\n\r\n"Lay your hand on thim," said Long Jack.\r\n\r\nHarvey obeyed. "Lower till that rope-loop--on the after-leach-kris--no,\r\nit\'s cringle--till the cringle was down on the boom. Then I\'d tie her\r\nup the way you said, and then I\'d hoist up the peak and throat halyards\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve forgot to pass the tack-earing, but wid time and help ye\'ll\r\nlarn. There\'s good and just reason for ivry rope aboard, or else\r\n\'twould be overboard. D\'ye follow me? \'Tis dollars an\' cents I\'m\r\nputtin\' into your pocket, ye skinny little supercargo, so that fwhin\r\nye\'ve filled out ye can ship from Boston to Cuba an\' tell thim Long\r\nJack larned you. Now I\'ll chase ye around a piece, callin\' the ropes,\r\nan\' you\'ll lay your hand on thim as I call."\r\n\r\nHe began, and Harvey, who was feeling rather tired, walked slowly to\r\nthe rope named. A rope\'s end licked round his ribs, and nearly knocked\r\nthe breath out of him.\r\n\r\n"When you own a boat," said Tom Platt, with severe eyes, "you can walk.\r\nTill then, take all orders at the run. Once more--to make sure!"\r\n\r\nHarvey was in a glow with the exercise, and this last cut warmed him\r\nthoroughly. Now he was a singularly smart boy, the son of a very clever\r\nman and a very sensitive woman, with a fine resolute temper that\r\nsystematic spoiling had nearly turned to mulish obstinacy. He looked at\r\nthe other men, and saw that even Dan did not smile. It was evidently\r\nall in the day\'s work, though it hurt abominably; so he swallowed the\r\nhint with a gulp and a gasp and a grin. The same smartness that led him\r\nto take such advantage of his mother made him very sure that no one on\r\nthe boat, except, maybe, Penn, would stand the least nonsense. One\r\nlearns a great deal from a mere tone. Long Jack called over half a\r\ndozen ropes, and Harvey danced over the deck like an eel at ebb-tide,\r\none eye on Tom Platt.\r\n\r\n"Ver\' good. Ver\' good don," said Manuel. "After supper I show you a\r\nlittle schooner I make, with all her ropes. So we shall learn."\r\n\r\n"Fust-class fer--a passenger," said Dan. "Dad he\'s jest allowed you\'ll\r\nbe wuth your salt maybe \'fore you\'re draownded. Thet\'s a heap fer Dad.\r\nI\'ll learn you more our next watch together."\r\n\r\n"Taller!" grunted Disko, peering through the fog as it smoked over the\r\nbows. There was nothing to be seen ten feet beyond the surging\r\njib-boom, while alongside rolled the endless procession of solemn, pale\r\nwaves whispering and lipping one to the other.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'ll learn you something Long Jack can\'t," shouted Tom Platt, as\r\nfrom a locker by the stern he produced a battered deep-sea lead\r\nhollowed at one end, smeared the hollow from a saucer full of mutton\r\ntallow, and went forward. "I\'ll learn you how to fly the Blue Pigeon.\r\nShooo!"\r\n\r\nDisko did something to the wheel that checked the schooner\'s way, while\r\nManuel, with Harvey to help (and a proud boy was Harvey), let down the\r\njib in a lump on the boom. The lead sung a deep droning song as Tom\r\nPlatt whirled it round and round.\r\n\r\n"Go ahead, man," said Long Jack, impatiently. "We\'re not drawin\'\r\ntwenty-five fut off Fire Island in a fog. There\'s no trick to ut."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be jealous, Galway." The released lead plopped into the sea far\r\nahead as the schooner surged slowly forward.\r\n\r\n"Soundin\' is a trick, though," said Dan, "when your dipsey lead\'s all\r\nthe eye you\'re like to hev for a week. What d\'you make it, Dad?"\r\n\r\nDisko\'s face relaxed. His skill and honour were involved in the march\r\nhe had stolen on the rest of the Fleet, and he had his reputation as a\r\nmaster artist who knew the Banks blindfold. "Sixty, mebbe--ef I\'m any\r\njudge," he replied, with a glance at the tiny compass in the window of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n"Sixty," sung out Tom Platt, hauling in great wet coils.\r\n\r\nThe schooner gathered way once more. "Heave!" said Disko, after a\r\nquarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n"What d\'you make it?" Dan whispered, and he looked at Harvey proudly.\r\nBut Harvey was too proud of his own performances to be impressed just\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n"Fifty," said the father. "I mistrust we\'re right over the nick o\'\r\nGreen Bank on old Sixty-Fifty."\r\n\r\n"Fifty!" roared Tom Platt. They could scarcely see him through the fog.\r\n"She\'s bust within a yard--like the shells at Fort Macon."\r\n\r\n"Bait up, Harve," said Dan, diving for a line on the reel.\r\n\r\nThe schooner seemed to be straying promiscuously through the smother,\r\nher headsail banging wildly. The men waited and looked at the boys who\r\nbegan fishing.\r\n\r\n"Heugh!" Dan\'s lines twitched on the scored and scarred rail. "Now haow\r\nin thunder did Dad know? Help us here, Harve. It\'s a big un.\r\nPoke-hooked, too." They hauled together, and landed a goggle-eyed\r\ntwenty-pound cod. He had taken the bait right into his stomach.\r\n\r\n"Why, he\'s all covered with little crabs," cried Harvey, turning him\r\nover.\r\n\r\n"By the great hook-block, they\'re lousy already," said Long Jack.\r\n"Disko, ye kape your spare eyes under the keel."\r\n\r\nSplash went the anchor, and they all heaved over the lines, each man\r\ntaking his own place at the bulwarks.\r\n\r\n"Are they good to eat?" Harvey panted, as he lugged in another\r\ncrab-covered cod.\r\n\r\n"Sure. When they\'re lousy it\'s a sign they\'ve all been herdin\' together\r\nby the thousand, and when they take the bait that way they\'re hungry.\r\nNever mind how the bait sets. They\'ll bite on the bare hook."\r\n\r\n"Say, this is great!" Harvey cried, as the fish came in gasping and\r\nsplashing--nearly all poke-hooked, as Dan had said. "Why can\'t we\r\nalways fish from the boat instead of from the dories?"\r\n\r\n"Allus can, till we begin to dress daown. Efter thet, the heads and\r\noffals \'u\'d scare the fish to Fundy. Boatfishin\' ain\'t reckoned\r\nprogressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows. Guess we\'ll\r\nrun aout aour trawl to-night. Harder on the back, this, than frum the\r\ndory, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\nIt was rather back-breaking work, for in a dory the weight of a cod is\r\nwater-borne till the last minute, and you are, so to speak, abreast of\r\nhim; but the few feet of a schooner\'s freeboard make so much extra\r\ndead-hauling, and stooping over the bulwarks cramps the stomach. But it\r\nwas wild and furious sport so long as it lasted; and a big pile lay\r\naboard when the fish ceased biting.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Penn and Uncle Salters?" Harvey asked, slapping the slime off\r\nhis oilskins, and reeling up the line in careful imitation of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n"Git \'s coffee and see."\r\n\r\nUnder the yellow glare of the lamp on the pawl-post, the foc\'sle table\r\ndown and opened, utterly unconscious of fish or weather, sat the two\r\nmen, a checker-board between them, Uncle Salters snarling at Penn\'s\r\nevery move.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter naow?" said the former, as Harvey, one hand in the\r\nleather loop at the head of the ladder, hung shouting to the cook.\r\n\r\n"Big fish and lousy--heaps and heaps," Harvey replied, quoting Long\r\nJack. "How\'s the game?"\r\n\r\nLittle Penn\'s jaw dropped. "\'Tweren\'t none o\' his fault," snapped Uncle\r\nSalters. "Penn\'s deef."\r\n\r\n"Checkers, weren\'t it?" said Dan, as Harvey staggered aft with the\r\nsteaming coffee in a tin pail. "That lets us out o\' cleanin\' up\r\nto-night. Dad\'s a jest man. They\'ll have to do it."\r\n\r\n"An\' two young fellers I know\'ll bait up a tub or so o\' trawl, while\r\nthey\'re cleanin\'," said Disko, lashing the wheel to his taste.\r\n\r\n"Um! Guess I\'d ruther clean up, Dad."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t doubt it. Ye wun\'t, though. Dress daown! Dress daown! Penn\'ll\r\npitch while you two bait up."\r\n\r\n"Why in thunder didn\'t them blame boys tell us you\'d struck on?" said\r\nUncle Salters, shuffling to his place at the table. "This knife\'s\r\ngum-blunt, Dan."\r\n\r\n"Ef stickin\' out cable don\'t wake ye, guess you\'d better hire a boy o\'\r\nyour own," said Dan, muddling about in the dusk over the tubs full of\r\ntrawl-line lashed to windward of the house. "Oh, Harve, don\'t ye want\r\nto slip down an\' git \'s bait?"\r\n\r\n"Bait ez we are," said Disko. "I mistrust shag-fishin\' will pay better,\r\nez things go."\r\n\r\nThat meant the boys would bait with selected offal of the cod as the\r\nfish were cleaned--an improvement on paddling bare-handed in the little\r\nbait-barrels below. The tubs were full of neatly coiled line carrying a\r\nbig hook each few feet; and the testing and baiting of every single\r\nhook, with the stowage of the baited line so that it should run clear\r\nwhen shot from the dory, was a scientific business. Dan managed it in\r\nthe dark, without looking, while Harvey caught his fingers on the barbs\r\nand bewailed his fate. But the hooks flew through Dan\'s fingers like\r\ntatting on an old maid\'s lap. "I helped bait up trawl ashore \'fore I\r\ncould well walk," he said. "But it\'s a putterin\' job all the same. Oh,\r\nDad!" This shouted towards the hatch, where Disko and Tom Platt were\r\nsalting. "How many skates you reckon we\'ll need?"\r\n\r\n"\'Baout three. Hurry!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s three hundred fathom to each tub," Dan explained; "more\'n\r\nenough to lay out to-night. Ouch! \'Slipped up there, I did." He stuck\r\nhis finger in his mouth. "I tell you, Harve, there ain\'t money in\r\nGloucester \'u\'d hire me to ship on a reg\'lar trawler. It may be\r\nprogressive, but, barrin\' that, it\'s the putterin\'est, slimjammest\r\nbusiness top of earth."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what this is, if \'tisn\'t regular trawling," said Harvey\r\nsulkily. "My fingers are all cut to frazzles."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! This is just one o\' Dad\'s blame experiments. He don\'t trawl\r\n\'less there\'s mighty good reason fer it. Dad knows. Thet\'s why he\'s\r\nbaitin\' ez he is. We\'ll hev her saggin\' full when we take her up er we\r\nwon\'t see a fin."\r\n\r\nPenn and Uncle Salters cleaned up as Disko had ordained, but the boys\r\nprofited little. No sooner were the tubs furnished than Tom Platt and\r\nLong Jack, who had been exploring the inside of a dory with a lantern,\r\nsnatched them away, loaded up the tubs and some small, painted\r\ntrawl-buoys, and hove the boat overboard into what Harvey regarded as\r\nan exceedingly rough sea. "They\'ll be drowned. Why, the dory\'s loaded\r\nlike a freight-car," he cried.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be back," said Long Jack, "an\' in case you\'ll not be lookin\' for\r\nus, we\'ll lay into you both if the trawl\'s snarled."\r\n\r\nThe dory surged up on the crest of a wave, and just when it seemed\r\nimpossible that she could avoid smashing against the schooner\'s side,\r\nslid over the ridge, and was swallowed up in the damp dusk.\r\n\r\n"Take ahold here, an\' keep ringin\' steady," said Dan, passing Harvey\r\nthe lanyard of a bell that hung just behind the windlass.\r\n\r\nHarvey rang lustily, for he felt two lives depended on him. But Disko\r\nin the cabin, scrawling in the log-book, did not look like a murderer,\r\nand when he went to supper he even smiled dryly at the anxious Harvey.\r\n\r\n"This ain\'t no weather," said Dan. "Why, you an\' me could set thet\r\ntrawl! They\'ve only gone out jest far \'nough so\'s not to foul our\r\ncable. They don\'t need no bell reelly."\r\n\r\n"Clang! clang! clang!" Harvey kept it up, varied with occasional\r\nrub-a-dubs, for another half-hour. There was a bellow and a bump\r\nalongside. Manuel and Dan raced to the hooks of the dory-tackle; Long\r\nJack and Tom Platt arrived on deck together, it seemed, one half the\r\nNorth Atlantic at their backs, and the dory followed them in the air,\r\nlanding with a clatter.\r\n\r\n"Nary snarl," said Tom Platt as he dripped. "Danny, you\'ll do yet."\r\n\r\n"The pleasure av your comp\'ny to the banquit," said Long Jack,\r\nsquelching the water from his boots as he capered like an elephant and\r\nstuck an oil-skinned arm into Harvey\'s face. "We do be condescending to\r\nhonour the second half wid our presence." And off they all four rolled\r\nto supper, where Harvey stuffed himself to the brim on fish-chowder and\r\nfried pies, and fell fast asleep just as Manuel produced from a locker\r\na lovely two-foot model of the Lucy Holmes, his first boat, and was\r\ngoing to show Harvey the ropes. Harvey never even twiddled his fingers\r\nas Penn pushed him into his bunk.\r\n\r\n"It must be a sad thing--a very sad thing," said Penn, watching the\r\nboy\'s face, "for his mother and his father, who think he is dead. To\r\nlose a child--to lose a man-child!"\r\n\r\n"Git out o\' this, Penn," said Dan. "Go aft and finish your game with\r\nUncle Salters. Tell Dad I\'ll stand Harve\'s watch ef he don\'t keer. He\'s\r\nplayed aout."\r\n\r\n"Ver\' good boy," said Manuel, slipping out of his boots and\r\ndisappearing into the black shadows of the lower bunk. "Expec\' he make\r\ngood man, Danny. I no see he is any so mad as your parpa he says. Eh,\r\nwha-at?"\r\n\r\nDan chuckled, but the chuckle ended in a snore.\r\n\r\nIt was thick weather outside, with a rising wind, and the elder men\r\nstretched their watches. The hour struck clear in the cabin; the nosing\r\nbows slapped and scuffed with the seas; the foc\'sle stove-pipe hissed\r\nand sputtered as the spray caught it; and the boys slept on, while\r\nDisko, Long Jack, Tom Platt, and Uncle Salters, each in turn, stumped\r\naft to look at the wheel, forward to see that the anchor held, or to\r\nveer out a little more cable against chafing, with a glance at the dim\r\nanchor-light between each round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHarvey waked to find the "first half" at breakfast, the foc\'sle door\r\ndrawn to a crack, and every square inch of the schooner singing its own\r\ntune. The black bulk of the cook balanced behind the tiny galley over\r\nthe glare of the stove, and the pots and pans in the pierced wooden\r\nboard before it jarred and racketed to each plunge. Up and up the\r\nfoc\'sle climbed, yearning and surging and quivering, and then, with a\r\nclear, sickle-like swoop, came down into the seas. He could hear the\r\nflaring bows cut and squelch, and there was a pause ere the divided\r\nwaters came down on the deck above, like a volley of buckshot. Followed\r\nthe woolly sound of the cable in the hawse-hole; and a grunt and squeal\r\nof the windlass; a yaw, a punt, and a kick, and the _We\'re Here_\r\ngathered herself together to repeat the motions.\r\n\r\n"Now, ashore," he heard Long Jack saying, "ye\'ve chores, an\' ye must do\r\nthim in any weather. Here we\'re well clear of the fleet, an\' we\'ve no\r\nchores--an\' that\'s a blessin\'. Good night, all." He passed like a big\r\nsnake from the table to his bunk, and began to smoke. Tom Platt\r\nfollowed his example; Uncle Salters, with Penn, fought his way up the\r\nladder to stand his watch, and the cook set for the "second half."\r\n\r\nIt came out of its bunks as the others had entered theirs, with a shake\r\nand a yawn. It ate till it could eat no more; and then Manuel filled\r\nhis pipe with some terrible tobacco, crotched himself between the\r\npawl-post and a forward bunk, cocked his feet up on the table, and\r\nsmiled tender and indolent smiles at the smoke. Dan lay at length in\r\nhis bunk, wrestling with a gaudy, gilt-stopped accordion, whose tunes\r\nwent up and down with the pitching of the _We\'re Here_. The cook, his\r\nshoulders against the locker where he kept the fried pies (Dan was fond\r\nof fried pies), peeled potatoes, with one eye on the stove in event of\r\ntoo much water finding its way down the pipe; and the general smell and\r\nsmother were past all description.\r\n\r\nHarvey considered affairs, wondered that he was not deathly sick, and\r\ncrawled into his bunk again, as the softest and safest place, while Dan\r\nstruck up, "I don\'t want to play in your yard," as accurately as the\r\nwild jerks allowed.\r\n\r\n"How long is this for?" Harvey asked of Manuel.\r\n\r\n"Till she get a little quiet, and we can row to trawl. Perhaps\r\nto-night. Perhaps two days more. You do not like? Eh, wha-at?"\r\n\r\n"I should have been crazy sick a week ago, but it doesn\'t seem to upset\r\nme now--much."\r\n\r\n"That is because we make you fisherman, these days. If I was you, when\r\nI come to Gloucester I would give two, three big candles for my good\r\nluck."\r\n\r\n"Give who?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure--the Virgin of our Church on the Hill. She is very good to\r\nfishermen all the time. That is why so few of us Portugee men ever are\r\ndrowned."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a Roman Catholic, then?"\r\n\r\n"I am a Madeira man. I am not a Porto Pico boy. Shall I be Baptist,\r\nthen? Eh, wha-at? I always give candles--two, three more when I come to\r\nGloucester. The good Virgin she never forgets me, Manuel."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t sense it that way," Tom Platt put in from his bunk, his\r\nscarred face lit up by the glare of a match as he sucked at his pipe.\r\n"It stands to reason the sea\'s the sea; and you\'ll get jest about\r\nwhat\'s goin\', candles or kerosene, fer that matter."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a mighty good thing," said Long Jack, "to have a frind at coort,\r\nthough. I\'m o\' Manuel\'s way o\' thinkin\'. About tin years back I was crew\r\nto a Sou\' Boston market-boat. We was off Minot\'s Ledge wid a\r\nnortheaster, butt first, atop of us, thicker\'n burgoo. The ould man was\r\ndhrunk, his chin waggin\' on the tiller, an\' I sez to myself, \'If iver I\r\nstick my boat-huk into T-wharf again, I\'ll show the saints fwhat manner\r\no\' craft they saved me out av.\' Now, I\'m here, as ye can well see, an\'\r\nthe model of the dhirty ould Kathleen, that took me a month to make, I\r\ngave ut to the priest, an\' he hung ut up forninst the altar. There\'s\r\nmore sense in givin\' a model that\'s by way o\' bein\' a work av art than\r\nany candle. Ye can buy candles at store, but a model shows the good\r\nsaints ye\'ve tuk trouble an\' are grateful."\r\n\r\n"D\'you believe that, Irish?" said Tom Platt, turning on his elbow.\r\n\r\n"Would I do ut if I did not, Ohio?"\r\n\r\n"Wa-al, Enoch Fuller he made a model o\' the old Ohio, and she\'s to\r\nCalem museum now. Mighty pretty model, too, but I guess Enoch he never\r\ndone it fer no sacrifice; an\' the way I take it is--"\r\n\r\nThere were the makings of an hour-long discussion of the kind that\r\nfishermen love, where the talk runs in shouting circles and no one\r\nproves anything at the end, had not Dan struck up this cheerful rhyme:\r\n\r\n  "Up jumped the mackerel with his stripe\'d back.\r\n  Reef in the mainsail, and haul on the tack;\r\n  _For_ it\'s windy weather--"\r\n\r\nHere Long Jack joined in:\r\n\r\n    "_And_ it\'s blowy weather;\r\n    _When_ the winds begin to blow, pipe all hands together!"\r\n\r\nDan went on, with a cautious look at Tom Platt, holding the accordion\r\nlow in the bunk:\r\n\r\n    "Up jumped the cod with his chuckle-head,\r\n    Went to the main-chains to heave at the lead;\r\n    _For_ it\'s windy weather," etc.\r\n\r\nTom Platt seemed to be hunting for something. Dan crouched lower, but\r\nsang louder:\r\n\r\n    "Up jumped the flounder that swims to the ground.\r\n    Chuckle-head! Chuckle-head! Mind where ye sound!"\r\n\r\nTom Platt\'s huge rubber boot whirled across the foc\'sle and caught\r\nDan\'s uplifted arm. There was war between the man and the boy ever\r\nsince Dan had discovered that the mere whistling of that tune would\r\nmake him angry as he heaved the lead.\r\n\r\n"Thought I\'d fetch yer," said Dan, returning the gift with precision.\r\n"Ef you don\'t like my music, git out your fiddle. I ain\'t goin\' to lie\r\nhere all day an\' listen to you an\' Long Jack arguin\' \'baout candles.\r\nFiddle, Tom Platt; or I\'ll learn Harve here the tune!"\r\n\r\nTom Platt leaned down to a locker and brought up an old white fiddle.\r\nManuel\'s eye glistened, and from somewhere behind the pawl-post he drew\r\nout a tiny, guitar-like thing with wire strings, which he called a\r\nmachette.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a concert," said Long Jack, beaming through the smoke. "A reg\'lar\r\nBoston concert."\r\n\r\nThere was a burst of spray as the hatch opened, and Disko, in yellow\r\noilskins, descended.\r\n\r\n"Ye\'re just in time, Disko. Fwhat\'s she doin\' outside?"\r\n\r\n"Jest this!" He dropped on to the lockers with the push and heave of\r\nthe _We\'re Here_.\r\n\r\n"We\'re singin\' to kape our breakfasts down. Ye\'ll lead, av course,\r\nDisko," said Long Jack.\r\n\r\n"Guess there ain\'t more\'n \'baout two old songs I know, an\' ye\'ve heerd\r\nthem both."\r\n\r\nHis excuses were cut short by Tom Platt launching into a most dolorous\r\ntune, like unto the moaning of winds and the creaking of masts. With\r\nhis eyes fixed on the beams above, Disko began this ancient, ancient\r\nditty, Tom Platt flourishing all round him to make the tune and words\r\nfit a little:\r\n\r\n    "There is a crack packet--crack packet o\' fame,\r\n    She hails from Noo York, an\' the _Dreadnought\'s_ her name.\r\n    You may talk o\' your fliers--Swallowtail and Black Ball--\r\n    But the _Dreadnought\'s_ the packet that can beat them all.\r\n    "Now the _Dreadnought_ she lies in the River Mersey,\r\n    Because of the tug-boat to take her to sea;\r\n    But when she\'s off soundings you shortly will know\r\n\r\n(Chorus.)\r\n\r\n    She\'s the Liverpool packet--O Lord, let her go!\r\n\r\n    "Now the _Dreadnought_ she\'s howlin\' crost the Banks o\' Newfoundland,\r\n    Where the water\'s all shallow and the bottom\'s all sand.\r\n    Sez all the little fishes that swim to and fro:\r\n\r\n(Chorus.)\r\n\r\n    \'She\'s the Liverpool packet--O Lord, let her go!\'",\r\n\r\nThere were scores of verses, for he worked the _Dreadnought_ every mile\r\nof the way between Liverpool and New York as conscientiously as though\r\nhe were on her deck, and the accordion pumped and the fiddle squeaked\r\nbeside him. Tom Platt followed with something about "the rough and\r\ntough McGinn, who would pilot the vessel in." Then they called on\r\nHarvey, who felt very flattered, to contribute to the entertainment;\r\nbut all that he could remember were some pieces of "Skipper Ireson\'s\r\nRide" that he had been taught at the camp-school in the Adirondacks. It\r\nseemed that they might be appropriate to the time and place, but he had\r\nno more than mentioned the title when Disko brought down one foot with\r\na bang, and cried, "Don\'t go on, young feller. That\'s a mistaken\r\njedgment--one o\' the worst kind, too, becaze it\'s catchin\' to the ear."\r\n\r\n"I orter ha\' warned you," said Dan. "Thet allus fetches Dad."\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong?" said Harvey, surprised and a little angry.\r\n\r\n"All you\'re goin\' to say," said Disko. "All dead wrong from start to\r\nfinish, an\' Whittier he\'s to blame. I have no special call to right any\r\nMarblehead man, but \'tweren\'t no fault o\' Ireson\'s. My father he told\r\nme the tale time an\' again, an\' this is the way \'twuz."\r\n\r\n"For the wan hundredth time," put in Long Jack under his breath\r\n\r\n"Ben Ireson he was skipper o\' the Betty, young feller, comin\' home frum\r\nthe Banks--that was before the war of 1812, but jestice is jestice at\r\nall times. They fund the Active o\' Portland, an\' Gibbons o\' that town\r\nhe was her skipper; they fund her leakin\' off Cape Cod Light. There was\r\na terr\'ble gale on, an\' they was gettin\' the Betty home \'s fast as they\r\ncould craowd her. Well, Ireson he said there warn\'t any sense to\r\nreskin\' a boat in that sea; the men they wouldn\'t hev it; and he laid\r\nit before them to stay by the Active till the sea run daown a piece.\r\nThey wouldn\'t hev that either, hangin\' araound the Cape in any sech\r\nweather, leak or no leak. They jest up stays\'l an\' quit, nat\'rally\r\ntakin\' Ireson with \'em. Folks to Marblehead was mad at him not runnin\'\r\nthe risk, and becaze nex\' day, when the sea was ca\'am (they never\r\nstopped to think o\' that), some of the Active\'s folks was took off by a\r\nTruro man. They come into Marblehead with their own tale to tell,\r\nsayin\' how Ireson had shamed his town, an\' so forth an\' so on, an\'\r\nIreson\'s men they was scared, seein\' public feelin\' agin\' \'em, an\' they\r\nwent back on Ireson, an\' swore he was respons\'ble for the hull act.\r\n\'Tweren\'t the women neither that tarred and feathered him--Marblehead\r\nwomen don\'t act that way--\'twas a passel o\' men an\' boys, an\' they\r\ncarted him araound town in an old dory till the bottom fell aout, and\r\nIreson he told \'em they\'d be sorry for it some day. Well, the facts\r\ncome aout later, same\'s they usually do, too late to be any ways useful\r\nto an honest man; an\' Whittier he come along an\' picked up the slack\r\neend of a lyin\' tale, an\' tarred and feathered Ben Ireson all over onct\r\nmore after he was dead. \'Twas the only tune Whittier ever slipped up,\r\nan\' \'tweren\'t fair. I whaled Dan good when he brought that piece back\r\nfrom school. You don\'t know no better, o\' course; but I\'ve give you the\r\nfacts, hereafter an\' evermore to be remembered. Ben Ireson weren\'t no\r\nsech kind o\' man as Whittier makes aout; my father he knew him well,\r\nbefore an\' after that business, an\' you beware o\' hasty jedgments,\r\nyoung feller. Next!"\r\n\r\nHarvey had never heard Disko talk so long, and collapsed with burning\r\ncheeks; but, as Dan said promptly, a boy could only learn what he was\r\ntaught at school, and life was too short to keep track of every lie\r\nalong the coast.\r\n\r\nThen Manuel touched the jangling, jarring little machette to a queer\r\ntune, and sang something in Portuguese about "Nina, innocente!" ending\r\nwith a full-handed sweep that brought the song up with a jerk. Then\r\nDisko obliged with his second song, to an old-fashioned creaky tune,\r\nand all joined in the chorus. This is one stanza:\r\n\r\n    "Now Aprile is over and melted the snow,\r\n    And outer Noo Bedford we shortly must tow;\r\n    Yes, out o\' Noo Bedford we shortly must clear,\r\n    We\'re the whalers that never see wheat in the ear."\r\n\r\nHere the fiddle went very softly for a while by itself, and then:\r\n\r\n    "Wheat-in-the-ear, my true-love\'s posy blowin,\r\n    Wheat-in-the-ear, we\'re goin\' off to sea;\r\n    Wheat-in-the-ear, I left you fit for sowin,\r\n    When I come back a loaf o\' bread you\'ll be!"\r\n\r\nThat made Harvey almost weep, though he could not tell why. But it was\r\nmuch worse when the cook dropped the potatoes and held out his hands\r\nfor the fiddle. Still leaning against the locker door, he struck into a\r\ntune that was like something very bad but sure to happen whatever you\r\ndid. After a little he sang, in an unknown tongue, his big chin down on\r\nthe fiddle-tail, his white eyeballs glaring in the lamplight. Harvey\r\nswung out of his bunk to hear better; and amid the straining of the\r\ntimbers and the wash of the waters the tune crooned and moaned on, like\r\nlee surf in a blind fog, till it ended with a wail.\r\n\r\n"Jimmy Christmas! Thet gives me the blue creevles," said Dan. "What in\r\nthunder is it?"\r\n\r\n"The song of Fin McCoul," said the cook, "when he wass going to\r\nNorway." His English was not thick, but all clear-cut, as though it\r\ncame from a phonograph.\r\n\r\n"Faith, I\'ve been to Norway, but I didn\'t make that unwholesim noise.\r\n\'Tis like some of the old songs, though," said Long Jack, sighing.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let\'s hev another \'thout somethin\' between," said Dan; and the\r\naccordion struck up a rattling, catchy tune that ended:\r\n\r\n    "It\'s six an\' twenty Sundays sence las\' we saw the land,\r\n    With fifteen hunder quintal,\r\n    An\' fifteen hunder quintal,\r\n    \'Teen hunder toppin\' quintal,\r\n    \'Twix\' old \'Queereau an\' Grand!"\r\n\r\n"Hold on!" roared Tom Platt. "D\'ye want to nail the trip, Dan? That\'s\r\nJonah sure, \'less you sing it after all our salt\'s wet."\r\n\r\n"No, \'tain\'t, is it, Dad? Not unless you sing the very las\' verse. You\r\ncan\'t learn me anything on Jonahs!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" said Harvey. "What\'s a Jonah?"\r\n\r\n"A Jonah\'s anything that spoils the luck. Sometimes it\'s a\r\nman--sometimes it\'s a boy--or a bucket. I\'ve known a splittin\'-knife\r\nJonah two trips till we was on to her," said Tom Platt. "There\'s all\r\nsorts o\' Jonahs. Jim Bourke was one till he was drowned on Georges. I\'d\r\nnever ship with Jim Bourke, not if I was starvin\'. There wuz a green\r\ndory on the Ezra Flood. Thet was a Jonah, too, the worst sort o\' Jonah.\r\nDrowned four men, she did, an\' used to shine fiery O, nights in the\r\nnest."\r\n\r\n"And you believe that?" said Harvey, remembering what Tom Platt had\r\nsaid about candles and models. "Haven\'t we all got to take what\'s\r\nserved?"\r\n\r\nA mutter of dissent ran round the bunks. "Outboard, yes; inboard,\r\nthings can happen," said Disko. "Don\'t you go makin\' a mock of Jonahs,\r\nyoung feller."\r\n\r\n"Well, Harve ain\'t no Jonah. Day after we catched him," Dan cut in, "we\r\nhad a toppin\' good catch."\r\n\r\nThe cook threw up his head and laughed suddenly--a queer, thin laugh.\r\nHe was a most disconcerting nigger.\r\n\r\n"Murder!" said Long Jack. "Don\'t do that again, doctor. We ain\'t used\r\nto ut."\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong?" said Dan. "Ain\'t he our mascot, and didn\'t they strike\r\non good after we\'d struck him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! yess," said the cook. "I know that, but the catch iss not finish\r\nyet."\r\n\r\n"He ain\'t goin\' to do us any harm," said Dan, hotly. "Where are ye\r\nhintin\' an\' edgin\' to? He\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"No harm. No. But one day he will be your master, Danny."\r\n\r\n"That all?" said Dan, placidly. "He wun\'t--not by a jugful."\r\n\r\n"Master!" said the cook, pointing to Harvey. "Man!" and he pointed to\r\nDan.\r\n\r\n"That\'s news. Haow soon?" said Dan, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"In some years, and I shall see it. Master and man--man and master."\r\n\r\n"How in thunder d\'ye work that out?" said Tom Platt.\r\n\r\n"In my head, where I can see."\r\n\r\n"Haow?" This from all the others at once.\r\n\r\n"I do not know, but so it will be." He dropped his head, and went on\r\npeeling the potatoes, and not another word could they get out of him.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Dan, "a heap o\' things\'ll hev to come abaout \'fore Harve\'s\r\nany master o\' mine; but I\'m glad the doctor ain\'t choosen to mark him\r\nfor a Jonah. Now, I mistrust Uncle Salters fer the Jonerest Jonah in\r\nthe Fleet regardin\' his own special luck. Dunno ef it\'s spreadin\'\r\nsame\'s smallpox. He ought to be on the _Carrie Pitman_. That boat\'s her\r\nown Jonah, sure--crews an\' gear made no differ to her driftin\'. Jiminy\r\nChristmas! She\'ll etch loose in a flat ca\'am."\r\n\r\n"We\'re well clear o\' the Fleet, anyway," said Disko. "_Carrie Pitman_ an\'\r\nall." There was a rapping on the deck.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Salters has catched his luck," said Dan as his father departed.\r\n\r\n"It\'s blown clear," Disko cried, and all the foc\'sle tumbled up for a\r\nbit of fresh air. The fog had gone, but a sullen sea ran in great\r\nrollers behind it. The _We\'re Here_ slid, as it were, into long, sunk\r\navenues and ditches which felt quite sheltered and homelike if they\r\nwould only stay still; but they changed without rest or mercy, and\r\nflung up the schooner to crown one peak of a thousand gray hills, while\r\nthe wind hooted through her rigging as she zigzagged down the slopes.\r\nFar away a sea would burst into a sheet of foam, and the others would\r\nfollow suit as at a signal, till Harvey\'s eyes swam with the vision of\r\ninterlacing whites and grays. Four or five Mother Carey\'s chickens\r\nstormed round in circles, shrieking as they swept past the bows. A\r\nrain-squall or two strayed aimlessly over the hopeless waste, ran down\r\n\'wind and back again, and melted away.\r\n\r\n"Seems to me I saw somethin\' flicker jest naow over yonder," said Uncle\r\nSalters, pointing to the northeast.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t be any of the fleet," said Disko, peering under his eyebrows, a\r\nhand on the foc\'sle gangway as the solid bows hatcheted into the\r\ntroughs. "Sea\'s oilin\' over dretful fast. Danny, don\'t you want to skip\r\nup a piece an\' see how aour trawl-buoy lays?"\r\n\r\nDanny, in his big boots, trotted rather than climbed up the main\r\nrigging (this consumed Harvey with envy), hitched himself around the\r\nreeling cross-trees, and let his eye rove till it caught the tiny black\r\nbuoy-flag on the shoulder of a mile-away swell.\r\n\r\n"She\'s all right," he hailed. "Sail O! Dead to the no\'th\'ard, comin\'\r\ndown like smoke! Schooner she be, too."\r\n\r\nThey waited yet another half-hour, the sky clearing in patches, with a\r\nflicker of sickly sun from time to time that made patches of\r\nolive-green water. Then a stump-foremast lifted, ducked, and\r\ndisappeared, to be followed on the next wave by a high stern with\r\nold-fashioned wooden snail\'s-horn davits. The snails were red-tanned.\r\n\r\n"Frenchmen!" shouted Dan. "No, \'tain\'t, neither. Da-ad!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s no French," said Disko. "Salters, your blame luck holds\r\ntighter\'n a screw in a keg-head."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve eyes. It\'s Uncle Abishai."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t nowise tell fer sure."\r\n\r\n"The head-king of all Jonahs," groaned Tom Platt. "Oh, Salters,\r\nSalters, why wasn\'t you abed an\' asleep?"\r\n\r\n"How could I tell?" said poor Salters, as the schooner swung up.\r\n\r\nShe might have been the very Flying Dutchman, so foul, draggled, and\r\nunkempt was every rope and stick aboard. Her old-style quarterdeck was\r\nsome or five feet high, and her rigging flew knotted and tangled like\r\nweed at a wharf-end. She was running before the wind--yawing\r\nfrightfully--her staysail let down to act as a sort of extra\r\nforesail,--"scandalized," they call it,--and her foreboom guyed out\r\nover the side. Her bowsprit cocked up like an old-fashioned frigate\'s;\r\nher jib-boom had been fished and spliced and nailed and clamped beyond\r\nfurther repair; and as she hove herself forward, and sat down on her\r\nbroad tail, she looked for all the world like a blouzy, frouzy, bad old\r\nwoman sneering at a decent girl.\r\n\r\n"That\'s Abishai," said Salters. "Full o\' gin an\' Judique men, an\' the\r\njudgments o\' Providence layin\' fer him an\' never takin\' good holt He\'s\r\nrun in to bait, Miquelon way."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll run her under," said Long Jack. "That\'s no rig fer this weather."\r\n\r\n"Not he, \'r he\'d\'a done it long ago," Disko replied. "Looks \'s if he\r\ncal\'lated to run us under. Ain\'t she daown by the head more \'n natural,\r\nTom Platt?"\r\n\r\n"Ef it\'s his style o\' loadin\' her she ain\'t safe," said the sailor\r\nslowly. "Ef she\'s spewed her oakum he\'d better git to his pumps mighty\r\nquick."\r\n\r\nThe creature threshed up, wore round with a clatter and raffle, and lay\r\nhead to wind within ear-shot.\r\n\r\nA gray-beard wagged over the bulwark, and a thick voice yelled\r\nsomething Harvey could not understand. But Disko\'s face darkened. "He\'d\r\nresk every stick he hez to carry bad news. Says we\'re in fer a shift o\'\r\nwind. He\'s in fer worse. Abishai! Abi-shai!" He waved his arm up and\r\ndown with the gesture of a man at the pumps, and pointed forward. The\r\ncrew mocked him and laughed.\r\n\r\n"Jounce ye, an\' strip ye an\' trip ye!" yelled Uncle Abishai. "A livin\'\r\ngale--a livin\' gale. Yab! Cast up fer your last trip, all you\r\nGloucester haddocks. You won\'t see Gloucester no more, no more!"\r\n\r\n"Crazy full--as usual," said Tom Platt. "Wish he hadn\'t spied us,\r\nthough."\r\n\r\nShe drifted out of hearing while the gray-head yelled something about a\r\ndance at the Bay of Bulls and a dead man in the foc\'sle. Harvey\r\nshuddered. He had seen the sloven tilled decks and the savage-eyed crew.\r\n\r\n"An\' that\'s a fine little floatin\' hell fer her draught," said Long\r\nJack. "I wondher what mischief he\'s been at ashore."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a trawler," Dan explained to Harvey, "an\' he runs in fer bait all\r\nalong the coast. Oh, no, not home, he don\'t go. He deals along the\r\nsouth an\' east shore up yonder." He nodded in the direction of the\r\npitiless Newfoundland beaches. "Dad won\'t never take me ashore there.\r\nThey\'re a mighty tough crowd--an\' Abishai\'s the toughest. You saw his\r\nboat? Well, she\'s nigh seventy year old, they say; the last o\' the old\r\nMarblehead heel-tappers. They don\'t make them quarterdecks any more.\r\nAbishai don\'t use Marblehead, though. He ain\'t wanted there. He jes\'\r\ndrif\'s araound, in debt, trawlin\' an\' cussin\' like you\'ve heard. Bin a\r\nJonah fer years an\' years, he hez. \'Gits liquor frum the Feecamp boats\r\nfer makin\' spells an\' selling winds an\' such truck. Crazy, I guess."\r\n\r\n"\'Twon\'t be any use underrunnin\' the trawl to-night," said Tom Platt,\r\nwith quiet despair. "He come alongside special to cuss us. I\'d give my\r\nwage an\' share to see him at the gangway o\' the old Ohio \'fore we quit\r\nfloggin\'. Jest abaout six dozen, an\' Sam Mocatta layin\' \'em on\r\ncriss-cross!"\r\n\r\nThe disheveled "heel-tapper" danced drunkenly down wind, and all eyes\r\nfollowed her. Suddenly the cook cried in his phonograph voice: "It wass\r\nhis own death made him speak so! He iss fey--fey, I tell you! Look!"\r\nShe sailed into a patch of watery sunshine three or four miles distant.\r\nThe patch dulled and faded out, and even as the light passed so did the\r\nschooner. She dropped into a hollow and--was not.\r\n\r\n"Run under, by the Great Hook-Block!" shouted Disko, jumping aft.\r\n"Drunk or sober, we\'ve got to help \'em. Heave short and break her out!\r\nSmart!"\r\n\r\nHarvey was thrown on the deck by the shock that followed the setting of\r\nthe jib and foresail, for they hove short on the cable, and to save\r\ntime, jerked the anchor bodily from the bottom, heaving in as they\r\nmoved away. This is a bit of brute force seldom resorted to except in\r\nmatters of life and death, and the little _We\'re Here_ complained like\r\na human. They ran down to where Abishai\'s craft had vanished; found two\r\nor three trawl-tubs, a gin-bottle, and a stove-in dory, but nothing\r\nmore. "Let \'em go," said Disko, though no one had hinted at picking\r\nthem up. "I wouldn\'t hev a match that belonged to Abishai aboard. Guess\r\nshe run clear under. Must ha\' been spewin\' her oakum fer a week, an\'\r\nthey never thought to pump her. That\'s one more boat gone along o\'\r\nleavin\' port all hands drunk."\r\n\r\n"Glory be!" said Long Jack. "We\'d ha\' been obliged to help \'em if they\r\nwas top o\' water."\r\n\r\n"\'Thinkin\' o\' that myself," said Tom Platt.\r\n\r\n"Fey! Fey!" said the cook, rolling his eyes. "He haas taken his own\r\nluck with him."\r\n\r\n"Ver\' good thing, I think, to tell the Fleet when we see. Eh, wha-at?"\r\nsaid Manuel. "If you runna that way before the \'wind, and she work open\r\nher seams--" He threw out his hands with an indescribable gesture,\r\nwhile Penn sat down on the house and sobbed at the sheer horror and\r\npity of it all. Harvey could not realize that he had seen death on the\r\nopen waters, but he felt very sick. Then Dan went up the cross-trees,\r\nand Disko steered them back to within sight of their own trawl-buoys\r\njust before the fog blanketed the sea once again.\r\n\r\n"We go mighty quick hereabouts when we do go," was all he said to\r\nHarvey. "You think on that fer a spell, young feller. That was liquor."\r\n\r\n"After dinner it was calm enough to fish from the decks,--Penn and\r\nUncle Salters were very zealous this time,--and the catch was large and\r\nlarge fish.\r\n\r\n"Abishai has shorely took his luck with him," said Salters. "The wind\r\nhain\'t backed ner riz ner nothin\'. How abaout the trawl? I despise\r\nsuperstition, anyway."\r\n\r\nTom Platt insisted that they had much better haul the thing and make a\r\nnew berth. But the cook said: "The luck iss in two pieces. You will\r\nfind it so when you look. I know." This so tickled Long Jack that he\r\noverbore Tom Platt and the two went out together.\r\n\r\nUnderrunning a trawl means pulling it in on one side of the dory,\r\npicking off the fish, rebaiting the hooks, and passing them back to the\r\nsea again--something like pinning and unpinning linen on a wash-line.\r\nIt is a lengthy business and rather dangerous, for the long, sagging\r\nline may twitch a boat under in a flash. But when they heard, "And naow\r\nto thee, O Capting," booming out of the fog, the crew of the _We\'re\r\nHere_ took heart. The dory swirled alongside well loaded, Tom Platt\r\nyelling for Manuel to act as relief-boat.\r\n\r\n"The luck\'s cut square in two pieces," said Long Jack, forking in the\r\nfish, while Harvey stood open-mouthed at the skill with which the\r\nplunging dory was saved from destruction. "One half was jest punkins.\r\nTom Platt wanted to haul her an\' ha\' done wid ut; but I said, "I\'ll\r\nback the doctor that has the second sight, an\' the other half come up\r\nsagging full o\' big uns. Hurry, Man\'nle, an\' bring\'s a tub o\' bait.\r\nThere\'s luck afloat to-night."\r\n\r\nThe fish bit at the newly baited hooks from which their brethren had\r\njust been taken, and Tom Platt and Long Jack moved methodically up and\r\ndown the length of the trawl, the boat\'s nose surging under the wet\r\nline of hooks, stripping the sea-cucumbers that they called pumpkins,\r\nslatting off the fresh-caught cod against the gunwale, rebaiting, and\r\nloading Manuel\'s dory till dusk.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take no risks," said Disko then--"not with him floatin\' around so\r\nnear. Abishai won\'t sink fer a week. Heave in the dories an\' we\'ll\r\ndress daown after supper."\r\n\r\nThat was a mighty dressing-down, attended by three or four blowing\r\ngrampuses. It lasted till nine o\'clock, and Disko was thrice heard to\r\nchuckle as Harvey pitched the split fish into the hold.\r\n\r\n"Say, you\'re haulin\' ahead dretful fast," said Dan, when they ground\r\nthe knives after the men had turned in. "There\'s somethin\' of a sea\r\nto-night, an\' I hain\'t heard you make no remarks on it."\r\n\r\n"Too busy," Harvey replied, testing a blade\'s edge. "Come to think of\r\nit, she is a high-kicker."\r\n\r\nThe little schooner was gambolling all around her anchor among the\r\nsilver-tipped waves. Backing with a start of affected surprise at the\r\nsight of the strained cable, she pounced on it like a kitten, while the\r\nspray of her descent burst through the hawse-holes with the report of a\r\ngun. Shaking her head, she would say: "Well, I\'m sorry I can\'t stay any\r\nlonger with you. I\'m going North," and would sidle off, halting\r\nsuddenly with a dramatic rattle of her rigging. "As I was just going to\r\nobserve," she would begin, as gravely as a drunken man addressing a\r\nlamp-post. The rest of the sentence (she acted her words in dumb-show,\r\nof course) was lost in a fit of the fidgets, when she behaved like a\r\npuppy chewing a string, a clumsy woman in a side-saddle, a hen with her\r\nhead cut off, or a cow stung by a hornet, exactly as the whims of the\r\nsea took her.\r\n\r\n"See her sayin\' her piece. She\'s Patrick Henry naow," said Dan.\r\n\r\nShe swung sideways on a roller, and gesticulated with her jib-boom from\r\nport to starboard.\r\n\r\n"But-ez-fer me, give me liberty-er give me-death!"\r\n\r\nWop! She sat down in the moon-path on the water, courtesying with a\r\nflourish of pride impressive enough had not the wheel-gear sniggered\r\nmockingly in its box.\r\n\r\nHarvey laughed aloud. "Why, it\'s just as if she was alive," he said.\r\n\r\n"She\'s as stiddy as a haouse an\' as dry as a herrin\'," said Dan\r\nenthusiastically, as he was slung across the deck in a batter of spray.\r\n"Fends \'em off an\' fends \'em off, an\' \'Don\'t ye come anigh me,\' she\r\nsez. Look at her--jest look at her! Sakes! You should see one o\' them\r\ntoothpicks histin\' up her anchor on her spike outer fifteen-fathom\r\nwater."\r\n\r\n"What\'s a toothpick, Dan?"\r\n\r\n"Them new haddockers an\' herrin\'-boats. Fine\'s a yacht forward, with\r\nyacht sterns to \'em, an\' spike bowsprits, an\' a haouse that \'u\'d take\r\nour hold. I\'ve heard that Burgess himself he made the models fer three\r\nor four of \'em. Dad\'s sot agin \'em on account o\' their pitchin\' an\'\r\njoltin\', but there\'s heaps o\' money in \'em. Dad can find fish, but he\r\nain\'t no ways progressive--he don\'t go with the march o\' the times.\r\nThey\'re chock-full o\' labour-savin\' jigs an\' sech all. \'Ever seed the\r\nElector o\' Gloucester? She\'s a daisy, ef she is a toothpick."\r\n\r\n"What do they cost, Dan?"\r\n\r\n"Hills o\' dollars. Fifteen thousand, p\'haps; more, mebbe. There\'s\r\ngold-leaf an\' everything you kin think of." Then to himself, half under\r\nhis breath, "Guess I\'d call her Hattie S., too."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThat was the first of many talks with Dan, who told Harvey why he would\r\ntransfer his dory\'s name to the imaginary Burgess-modelled haddocker.\r\nHarvey heard a good deal about the real Hattie at Gloucester; saw a\r\nlock of her hair--which Dan, finding fair words of no avail, had\r\n"hooked" as she sat in front of him at school that winter--and a\r\nphotograph. Hattie was about fourteen years old, with an awful contempt\r\nfor boys, and had been trampling on Dan\'s heart through the winter. All\r\nthis was revealed under oath of solemn secrecy on moonlit decks, in the\r\ndead dark, or in choking fog; the whining wheel behind them, the\r\nclimbing deck before, and without, the unresting, clamorous sea. Once,\r\nof course, as the boys came to know each other, there was a fight,\r\nwhich raged from bow to stern till Penn came up and separated them, but\r\npromised not to tell Disko, who thought fighting on watch rather worse\r\nthan sleeping. Harvey was no match for Dan physically, but it says a\r\ngreat deal for his new training that he took his defeat and did not try\r\nto get even with his conqueror by underhand methods.\r\n\r\nThat was after he had been cured of a string of boils between his\r\nelbows and wrists, where the wet jersey and oilskins cut into the\r\nflesh. The salt water stung them unpleasantly, but when they were ripe\r\nDan treated them with Disko\'s razor, and assured Harvey that now he was\r\na "blooded Banker"; the affliction of gurry-sores being the mark of the\r\ncaste that claimed him.\r\n\r\nSince he was a boy and very busy, he did not bother his head with too\r\nmuch thinking. He was exceedingly sorry for his mother, and often\r\nlonged to see her and above all to tell her of this wonderful new life,\r\nand how brilliantly he was acquitting himself in it. Otherwise he\r\npreferred not to wonder too much how she was bearing the shock of his\r\nsupposed death. But one day, as he stood on the foc\'sle ladder, guying\r\nthe cook, who had accused him and Dan of hooking fried pies, it\r\noccurred to him that this was a vast improvement on being snubbed by\r\nstrangers in the smoking-room of a hired liner.\r\n\r\nHe was a recognized part of the scheme of things on the We\'re Here; had\r\nhis place at the table and among the bunks; and could hold his own in\r\nthe long talks on stormy days, when the others were always ready to\r\nlisten to what they called his "fairy-tales" of his life ashore. It did\r\nnot take him more than two days and a quarter to feel that if he spoke\r\nof his own life--it seemed very far away--no one except Dan (and even\r\nDan\'s belief was sorely tried) credited him. So he invented a friend, a\r\nboy he had heard of, who drove a miniature four-pony drag in Toledo,\r\nOhio, and ordered five suits of clothes at a time and led things called\r\n"germans" at parties where the oldest girl was not quite fifteen, but\r\nall the presents were solid silver. Salters protested that this kind of\r\nyarn was desperately wicked, if not indeed positively blasphemous, but\r\nhe listened as greedily as the others; and their criticisms at the end\r\ngave Harvey entirely new notions on "germans," clothes, cigarettes with\r\ngold-leaf tips, rings, watches, scent, small dinner-parties, champagne,\r\ncard-playing, and hotel accommodation. Little by little he changed his\r\ntone when speaking of his "friend," whom Long Jack had christened "the\r\nCrazy Kid," "the Gilt-edged Baby," "the Suckin\' Vanderpoop," and other\r\npet names; and with his sea-booted feet cocked up on the table would\r\neven invent histories about silk pajamas and specially imported\r\nneckwear, to the "friend\'s" discredit. Harvey was a very adaptable\r\nperson, with a keen eye and ear for every face and tone about him.\r\n\r\nBefore long he knew where Disko kept the old greencrusted quadrant that\r\nthey called the "hog-yoke"--under the bed-bag in his bunk. When he took\r\nthe sun, and with the help of "The Old Farmer\'s" almanac found the\r\nlatitude, Harvey would jump down into the cabin and scratch the\r\nreckoning and date with a nail on the rust of the stove-pipe. Now, the\r\nchief engineer of the liner could have done no more, and no engineer of\r\nthirty years\' service could have assumed one half of the\r\nancient-mariner air with which Harvey, first careful to spit over the\r\nside, made public the schooner\'s position for that day, and then and\r\nnot till then relieved Disko of the quadrant. There is an etiquette in\r\nall these things.\r\n\r\nThe said "hog-yoke," an Eldridge chart, the farming almanac, Blunt\'s\r\n"Coast Pilot," and Bowditch\'s "Navigator" were all the weapons Disko\r\nneeded to guide him, except the deep-sea lead that was his spare eye.\r\nHarvey nearly slew Penn with it when Tom Platt taught him first how to\r\n"fly the blue pigeon"; and, though his strength was not equal to\r\ncontinuous sounding in any sort of a sea, for calm weather with a\r\nseven-pound lead on shoal water Disko used him freely. As Dan said:\r\n\r\n"\'Tain\'t soundin\'s dad wants. It\'s samples. Grease her up good, Harve."\r\nHarvey would tallow the cup at the end, and carefully bring the sand,\r\nshell, sludge, or whatever it might be, to Disko, who fingered and\r\nsmelt it and gave judgment As has been said, when Disko thought of cod\r\nhe thought as a cod; and by some long-tested mixture of instinct and\r\nexperience, moved the We\'re Here from berth to berth, always with the\r\nfish, as a blindfolded chess-player moves on the unseen board.\r\n\r\nBut Disko\'s board was the Grand Bank--a triangle two hundred and fifty\r\nmiles on each side--a waste of wallowing sea, cloaked with dank fog,\r\nvexed with gales, harried with drifting ice, scored by the tracks of\r\nthe reckless liners, and dotted with the sails of the fishing-fleet.\r\n\r\nFor days they worked in fog--Harvey at the bell--till, grown familiar\r\nwith the thick airs, he went out with Tom Platt, his heart rather in\r\nhis mouth. But the fog would not lift, and the fish were biting, and no\r\none can stay helplessly afraid for six hours at a time. Harvey devoted\r\nhimself to his lines and the gaff or gob-stick as Tom Platt called for\r\nthem; and they rowed back to the schooner guided by the bell and Tom\'s\r\ninstinct; Manuel\'s conch sounding thin and faint beside them. But it\r\nwas an unearthly experience, and, for the first time in a month, Harvey\r\ndreamed of the shifting, smoking floors of water round the dory, the\r\nlines that strayed away into nothing, and the air above that melted on\r\nthe sea below ten feet from his straining eyes. A few days later he was\r\nout with Manuel on what should have been forty-fathom bottom, but the\r\nwhole length of the roding ran out, and still the anchor found nothing,\r\nand Harvey grew mortally afraid, for that his last touch with earth was\r\nlost. "Whale-hole," said Manuel, hauling in. "That is good joke on\r\nDisko. Come!" and he rowed to the schooner to find Tom Platt and the\r\nothers jeering at the skipper because, for once, he had led them to the\r\nedge of the barren Whale-deep, the blank hole of the Grand Bank. They\r\nmade another berth through the fog, and that time the hair of Harvey\'s\r\nhead stood up when he went out in Manuel\'s dory. A whiteness moved in\r\nthe whiteness of the fog with a breath like the breath of the grave,\r\nand there was a roaring, a plunging, and spouting. It was his first\r\nintroduction to the dread summer berg of the Banks, and he cowered in\r\nthe bottom of the boat while Manuel laughed. There were days, though,\r\nclear and soft and warm, when it seemed a sin to do anything but loaf\r\nover the hand-lines and spank the drifting "sun-scalds" with an oar;\r\nand there were days of light airs, when Harvey was taught how to steer\r\nthe schooner from one berth to another.\r\n\r\nIt thrilled through him when he first felt the keel answer to his band\r\non the spokes and slide over the long hollows as the foresail scythed\r\nback and forth against the blue sky. That was magnificent, in spite of\r\nDisko saying that it would break a snake\'s back to follow his wake.\r\nBut, as usual, pride ran before a fall. They were sailing on the wind\r\nwith the staysail--an old one, luckily--set, and Harvey jammed her\r\nright into it to show Dan how completely he had mastered the art. The\r\nforesail went over with a bang, and the foregaff stabbed and ripped\r\nthrough the staysail, which was, of course, prevented from going over\r\nby the mainstay. They lowered the wreck in awful silence, and Harvey\r\nspent his leisure hours for the next few days under Tom Platt\'s lee,\r\nlearning to use a needle and palm. Dan hooted with joy, for, as he\r\nsaid, he had made the very same blunder himself in his early days.\r\n\r\nBoylike, Harvey imitated all the men by turns, till he had combined\r\nDisko\'s peculiar stoop at the wheel, Long Jack\'s swinging overhand when\r\nthe lines were hauled, Manuel\'s round-shouldered but effective stroke\r\nin a dory, and Tom Platt\'s generous Ohio stride along the deck.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis beautiful to see how he takes to ut," said Long Jack, when Harvey\r\nwas looking out by the windlass one thick noon. "I\'ll lay my wage an\'\r\nshare \'tis more\'n half play-actin\' to him, an\' he consates himself he\'s\r\na bowld mariner. Watch his little bit av a back now!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way we all begin," said Tom Platt. "The boys they make\r\nbelieve all the time till they\'ve cheated \'emselves into bein\' men, an\'\r\nso till they die--pretendin\' an\' pretendin\'. I done it on the old Ohio,\r\nI know. Stood my first watch--harbor-watch--feelin\' finer\'n Farragut.\r\nDan\'s full o\' the same kind o\' notions. See \'em now, actin\' to be\r\ngenewine moss-backs--very hair a rope-yarn an\' blood Stockholm tar." He\r\nspoke down the cabin stairs. "Guess you\'re mistook in your judgments\r\nfer once, Disko. What in Rome made ye tell us all here the kid was\r\ncrazy?"\r\n\r\n"He wuz," Disko replied. "Crazy ez a loon when he come aboard; but I\'ll\r\nsay he\'s sobered up consid\'ble sence. I cured him."\r\n\r\n"He yarns good," said Tom Platt. "T\'other night he told us abaout a kid\r\nof his own size steerin\' a cunnin\' little rig an\' four ponies up an\'\r\ndown Toledo, Ohio, I think \'twas, an\' givin\' suppers to a crowd o\'\r\nsim\'lar kids. Cur\'us kind o\' fairy-tale, but blame interestin\'. He\r\nknows scores of \'em."\r\n\r\n"Guess he strikes \'em outen his own head," Disko called from the cabin,\r\nwhere he was busy with the logbook. "Stands to reason that sort is all\r\nmade up. It don\'t take in no one but Dan, an\' he laughs at it. I\'ve\r\nheard him, behind my back."\r\n\r\n"Yever hear what Sim\'on Peter Ca\'houn said when they whacked up a match\r\n\'twix\' his sister Hitty an\' Lorin\' Jerauld, an\' the boys put up that\r\njoke on him daown to Georges?" drawled Uncle Salters, who was dripping\r\npeaceably under the lee of the starboard dory-nest.\r\n\r\nTom Platt puffed at his pipe in scornful silence: he was a Cape Cod\r\nman, and had not known that tale more than twenty years. Uncle Salters\r\nwent on with a rasping chuckie:\r\n\r\n"Sim\'on Peter Ca\'houn he said, an\' he was jest right, abaout Lorin\',\r\n\'Ha\'af on the taown,\' he said, \'an\' t\'other ha\'af blame fool; an\' they\r\ntold me she\'s married a \'ich man.\' Sim\'on Peter Ca\'houn he hedn\'t no\r\nroof to his mouth, an\' talked that way."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t talk any Pennsylvania Dutch," Tom Platt replied. "You\'d\r\nbetter leave a Cape man to tell that tale. The Ca\'houns was gypsies\r\nfrum \'way back."\r\n\r\n"Wal, I don\'t profess to be any elocutionist," Salters said. "I\'m\r\ncomin\' to the moral o\' things. That\'s jest abaout what aour Harve be!\r\nHa\'af on the taown, an\' t\'other ha\'af blame fool; an\' there\'s some\'ll\r\nbelieve he\'s a rich man. Yah!"\r\n\r\n"Did ye ever think how sweet \'twould be to sail wid a full crew o\'\r\nSalterses?" said Long Jack. "Ha\'af in the furrer an\' other ha\'af in the\r\nmuck-heap, as Ca\'houn did not say, an\' makes out he\'s a fisherman!"\r\n\r\nA little laugh went round at Salters\'s expense.\r\n\r\nDisko held his tongue, and wrought over the log-book that he kept in a\r\nhatchet-faced, square hand; this was the kind of thing that ran on,\r\npage after soiled page:\r\n\r\n"July 17. This day thick fog and few fish. Made berth to northward. So\r\nends this day.\r\n\r\n"July 18. This day comes in with thick fog. Caught a few fish.\r\n\r\n"July 19. This day comes in with light breeze from N.E. and fine\r\nweather. Made a berth to eastward. Caught plenty fish.\r\n\r\n"July 20. This, the Sabbath, comes in with fog and light winds. So ends\r\nthis day. Total fish caught this week, 3,478."\r\n\r\nThey never worked on Sundays, but shaved, and washed themselves if it\r\nwere fine, and Pennsylvania sang hymns. Once or twice he suggested\r\nthat, if it was not an impertinence, he thought he could preach a\r\nlittle. Uncle Salters nearly jumped down his throat at the mere notion,\r\nreminding him that he was not a preacher and mustn\'t think of such\r\nthings. "We\'d hev him rememberin\' Johns-town next," Salters explained,\r\n"an\' what would happen then?" so they compromised on his reading aloud\r\nfrom a book called "Josephus." It was an old leather-bound volume,\r\nsmelling of a hundred voyages, very solid and very like the Bible, but\r\nenlivened with accounts of battles and sieges; and they read it nearly\r\nfrom cover to cover. Otherwise Penn was a silent little body. He would\r\nnot utter a word for three days on end sometimes, though he played\r\ncheckers, listened to the songs, and laughed at the stories. When they\r\ntried to stir him up, he would answer: "I don\'t wish to seem\r\nunneighbourly, but it is because I have nothing to say. My head feels\r\nquite empty. I\'ve almost forgotten my name." He would turn to Uncle\r\nSalters with an expectant smile.\r\n\r\n"Why, Pennsylvania Pratt," Salters would shout "You\'ll fergit me next!"\r\n\r\n"No--never," Penn would say, shutting his lips firmly. "Pennsylvania\r\nPratt, of course," he would repeat over and over. Sometimes it was\r\nUncle Salters who forgot, and told him he was Haskins or Rich or\r\nMcVitty; but Penn was equally content--till next time.\r\n\r\nHe was always very tender with Harvey, whom he pitied both as a lost\r\nchild and as a lunatic; and when Salters saw that Penn liked the boy,\r\nhe relaxed, too. Salters was not an amiable person (He esteemed it his\r\nbusiness to keep the boys in order); and the first time Harvey, in fear\r\nand trembling, on a still day, managed to shin up to the main-truck\r\n(Dan was behind him ready to help), he esteemed it his duty to hang\r\nSalters\'s big sea-boots up there--a sight of shame and derision to the\r\nnearest schooner. With Disko, Harvey took no liberties; not even when\r\nthe old man dropped direct orders, and treated him, like the rest of\r\nthe crew, to "Don\'t you want to do so and so?" and "Guess you\'d\r\nbetter," and so forth. There was something about the clean-shaven lips\r\nand the puckered corners of the eyes that was mightily sobering to\r\nyoung blood.\r\n\r\nDisko showed him the meaning of the thumbed and pricked chart, which,\r\nhe said, laid over any government publication whatsoever; led him,\r\npencil in hand, from berth to berth over the whole string of banks--Le\r\nHave, Western, Banquereau, St. Pierre, Green, and Grand--talking "cod"\r\nmeantime. Taught him, too, the principle on which the "hog-yoke" was\r\nworked.\r\n\r\nIn this Harvey excelled Dan, for he had inherited a head for figures,\r\nand the notion of stealing information from one glimpse of the sullen\r\nBank sun appealed to all his keen wits. For other sea-matters his age\r\nhandicapped him. As Disko said, he should have begun when he was ten.\r\nDan could bait up trawl or lay his hand on any rope in the dark; and at\r\na pinch, when Uncle Salters had a gurry-score on his palm, could dress\r\ndown by sense of touch. He could steer in anything short of half a gale\r\nfrom the feel of the wind on his face, humouring the _We\'re Here_ just\r\nwhen she needed it. These things he did as automatically as he skipped\r\nabout the rigging, or made his dory a part of his own will and body.\r\nBut he could not communicate his knowledge to Harvey.\r\n\r\nStill there was a good deal of general information flying about the\r\nschooner on stormy days, when they lay up in the foc\'sle or sat on the\r\ncabin lockers, while spare eye-bolts, leads, and rings rolled and\r\nrattled in the pauses of the talk. Disko spoke of whaling voyages in\r\nthe Fifties; of great she-whales slain beside their young; of death\r\nagonies on the black tossing seas, and blood that spurted forty feet in\r\nthe air; of boats smashed to splinters; of patent rockets that went off\r\nwrong-end-first and bombarded the trembling crews; of cutting-in and\r\nboiling-down, and that terrible "nip" of \'71, when twelve hundred men\r\nwere made homeless on the ice in three days--wonderful tales, all true.\r\nBut more wonderful still were his stories of the cod, and how they\r\nargued and reasoned on their private businesses deep down below the\r\nkeel.\r\n\r\nLong Jack\'s tastes ran more to the supernatural. He held them silent\r\nwith ghastly stories of the "Yo-hoes" on Monomoy Beach, that mock and\r\nterrify lonely clam-diggers; of sand-walkers and dune-haunters who were\r\nnever properly buried; of hidden treasure on Fire Island guarded by the\r\nspirits of Kidd\'s men; of ships that sailed in the fog straight over\r\nTruro township; of that harbor in Maine where no one but a stranger\r\nwill lie at anchor twice in a certain place because of a dead crew who\r\nrow alongside at midnight with the anchor in the bow of their\r\nold-fashioned boat, whistling--not calling, but whistling--for the soul\r\nof the man who broke their rest.\r\n\r\nHarvey had a notion that the east coast of his native land, from Mount\r\nDesert south, was populated chiefly by people who took their horses\r\nthere in the summer and entertained in country-houses with hardwood\r\nfloors and Vantine portires. He laughed at the ghost-tales,--not as\r\nmuch as he would have done a month before,--but ended by sitting still\r\nand shuddering.\r\n\r\nTom Platt dealt with his interminable trip round the Horn on the old\r\nOhio in flogging days, with a navy more extinct than the dodo--the navy\r\nthat passed away in the great war. He told them how red-hot shot are\r\ndropped into a cannon, a wad of wet clay between them and the\r\ncartridge; how they sizzle and reek when they strike wood, and how the\r\nlittle ship-boys of the Miss Jim Buck hove water over them and shouted\r\nto the fort to try again. And he told tales of blockade--long weeks of\r\nswaying at anchor, varied only by the departure and return of steamers\r\nthat had used up their coal (there was no chance for the\r\nsailing-ships); of gales and cold that kept two hundred men, night and\r\nday, pounding and chopping at the ice on cable, blocks, and rigging,\r\nwhen the galley was as red-hot as the fort\'s shot, and men drank cocoa\r\nby the bucket. Tom Platt had no use for steam. His service closed when\r\nthat thing was comparatively new. He admitted that it was a specious\r\ninvention in time of peace, but looked hopefully for the day when sails\r\nshould come back again on ten-thousand-ton frigates with\r\nhundred-and-ninety-foot booms.\r\n\r\nManuel\'s talk was slow and gentle--all about pretty girls in Madeira\r\nwashing clothes in the dry beds of streams, by moonlight, under waving\r\nbananas; legends of saints, and tales of queer dances or fights away in\r\nthe cold Newfoundland baiting-ports. Salters was mainly agricultural;\r\nfor, though he read "Josephus" and expounded it, his mission in life\r\nwas to prove the value of green manures, and specially of clover,\r\nagainst every form of phosphate whatsoever. He grew libellous about\r\nphosphates; he dragged greasy "Orange Judd" books from his bunk and\r\nintoned them, wagging his finger at Harvey, to whom it was all Greek.\r\nLittle Penn was so genuinely pained when Harvey made fun of Salters\'s\r\nlectures that the boy gave it up, and suffered in polite silence. That\r\nwas very good for Harvey.\r\n\r\nThe cook naturally did not join in these conversations. As a rule, he\r\nspoke only when it was absolutely necessary; but at times a queer gift\r\nof speech descended on him, and he held forth, half in Gaelic, half in\r\nbroken English, an hour at a time. He was especially communicative with\r\nthe boys, and he never withdrew his prophecy that one day Harvey would\r\nbe Dan\'s master, and that he would see it. He told them of\r\nmail-carrying in the winter up Cape Breton way, of the dog-train that\r\ngoes to Coudray, and of the ram-steamer _Arctic_, that breaks the ice\r\nbetween the mainland and Prince Edward Island. Then he told them\r\nstories that his mother had told him, of life far to the southward,\r\nwhere water never froze; and he said that when he died his soul would\r\ngo to lie down on a warm white beach of sand with palm-trees waving\r\nabove. That seemed to the boys a very odd idea for a man who had never\r\nseen a palm in his life. Then, too, regularly at each meal, he would\r\nask Harvey, and Harvey alone, whether the cooking was to his taste; and\r\nthis always made the "second half" laugh. Yet they had a great respect\r\nfor the cook\'s judgment, and in their hearts considered Harvey\r\nsomething of a mascot by consequence.\r\n\r\nAnd while Harvey was taking in knowledge of new things at each pore and\r\nhard health with every gulp of the good air, the We\'re Here went her\r\nways and did her business on the Bank, and the silvery-gray kenches of\r\nwell-pressed fish mounted higher and higher in the hold. No one day\'s\r\nwork was out of common, but the average days were many and close\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nNaturally, a man of Disko\'s reputation was closely watched--"scrowged\r\nupon," Dan called it--by his neighbours, but he had a very pretty knack\r\nof giving them the slip through the curdling, glidy fog-banks. Disko\r\navoided company for two reasons. He wished to make his own\r\nexperiments, in the first place; and in the second, he objected to the\r\nmixed gatherings of a fleet of all nations. The bulk of them were\r\nmainly Gloucester boats, with a scattering from Provincetown, Harwich,\r\nChatham, and some of the Maine ports, but the crews drew from goodness\r\nknows where. Risk breeds recklessness, and when greed is added there\r\nare fine chances for every kind of accident in the crowded fleet,\r\nwhich, like a mob of sheep, is huddled round some unrecognized leader.\r\n"Let the two Jeraulds lead \'em," said Disko. "We\'re baound to lay among\r\n\'em for a spell on the Eastern Shoals; though ef luck holds, we won\'t\r\nhev to lay long. Where we are naow, Harve, ain\'t considered noways good\r\ngraound."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t it?" said Harvey, who was drawing water (he had learned just how\r\nto wiggle the bucket), after an unusually long dressing-down.\r\n"Shouldn\'t mind striking some poor ground for a change, then."\r\n\r\n"All the graound I want to see--don\'t want to strike her--is Eastern\r\nPoint," said Dan. "Say, Dad, it looks\'s if we wouldn\'t hev to lay\r\nmore\'n two weeks on the Shoals. You\'ll meet all the comp\'ny you want\r\nthen, Harve. That\'s the time we begin to work. No reg\'lar meals fer no\r\none then. \'Mug-up when ye\'re hungry, an\' sleep when ye can\'t keep\r\nawake. Good job you wasn\'t picked up a month later than you was, or\r\nwe\'d never ha\' had you dressed in shape fer the Old Virgin."\r\n\r\nHarvey understood from the Eldridge chart that the Old Virgin and a\r\nnest of curiously named shoals were the turning-point of the cruise,\r\nand that with good luck they would wet the balance of their salt there.\r\nBut seeing the size of the Virgin (it was one tiny dot), he wondered\r\nhow even Disko with the hog-yoke and the lead could find her. He\r\nlearned later that Disko was entirely equal to that and any other\r\nbusiness and could even help others. A big four-by-five blackboard hung\r\nin the cabin, and Harvey never understood the need of it till, after\r\nsome blinding thick days, they heard the unmelodious tooting of a\r\nfoot-power fog-horn--a machine whose note is as that of a consumptive\r\nelephant.\r\n\r\nThey were making a short berth, towing the anchor under their foot to\r\nsave trouble. "Square-rigger bellowin\' fer his latitude," said Long\r\nJack. The dripping red head-sails of a bark glided out of the fog, and\r\nthe _We\'re Here_ rang her bell thrice, using sea shorthand.\r\n\r\nThe larger boat backed her topsail with shrieks and shoutings.\r\n\r\n"Frenchman," said Uncle Salters, scornfully. "Miquelon boat from St.\r\nMalo." The farmer had a weatherly sea-eye. "I\'m \'most outer \'baccy,\r\ntoo, Disko."\r\n\r\n"Same here," said Tom Platt. "Hi! Backez vous--backez vous! Standez\r\nawayez, you butt-ended mucho-bono! Where you from--St. Malo, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, ha! Mucho bono! Oui! oui! Clos Poulet--St. Malo! St. Pierre et\r\nMiquelon," cried the other crowd, waving woollen caps and laughing.\r\nThen all together, "Bord! Bord!"\r\n\r\n"Bring up the board, Danny. Beats me how them Frenchmen fetch\r\nanywheres, exceptin\' America\'s fairish broadly. Forty-six forty-nine\'s\r\ngood enough fer them; an\' I guess it\'s abaout right, too."\r\n\r\nDan chalked the figures on the board, and they hung it in the\r\nmain-rigging to a chorus of mercis from the bark.\r\n\r\n"Seems kinder uneighbourly to let \'em swedge off like this," Salters\r\nsuggested, feeling in his pockets.\r\n\r\n"Hev ye learned French then sence last trip?" said Disko. "I don\'t want\r\nno more stone-ballast hove at us \'long o\' your callin\' Miquelon boats\r\n\'footy cochins,\' same\'s you did off Le Have."\r\n\r\n"Harmon Rush he said that was the way to rise \'em. Plain United States\r\nis good enough fer me. We\'re all dretful short on terbakker. Young\r\nfeller, don\'t you speak French?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Harvey valiantly; and he bawled: "Hi! Say! Arretez\r\nvous! Attendez! Nous sommes venant pour tabac."\r\n\r\n"Ah, tabac, tabac!" they cried, and laughed again.\r\n\r\n"That hit \'em. Let\'s heave a dory over, anyway," said Tom Platt. "I\r\ndon\'t exactly hold no certificates on French, but I know another lingo\r\nthat goes, I guess. Come on, Harve, an\' interpret."\r\n\r\nThe raffle and confusion when he and Harvey were hauled up the bark\'s\r\nblack side was indescribable. Her cabin was all stuck round with\r\nglaring coloured prints of the Virgin--the Virgin of Newfoundland, they\r\ncalled her. Harvey found his French of no recognized Bank brand, and\r\nhis conversation was limited to nods and grins. But Tom Platt waved his\r\narms and got along swimmingly. The captain gave him a drink of\r\nunspeakable gin, and the opera-comique crew, with their hairy throats,\r\nred caps, and long knives, greeted him as a brother. Then the trade\r\nbegan. They had tobacco, plenty of it--American, that had never paid\r\nduty to France. They wanted chocolate and crackers. Harvey rowed back\r\nto arrange with the cook and Disko, who owned the stores, and on his\r\nreturn the cocoa-tins and cracker-bags were counted out by the\r\nFrenchman\'s wheel. It looked like a piratical division of loot; but Tom\r\nPlatt came out of it roped with black pigtail and stuffed with cakes of\r\nchewing and smoking tobacco. Then those jovial mariners swung off into\r\nthe mist, and the last Harvey heard was a gay chorus:\r\n\r\n    "Par derriere chez ma tante,\r\n    Il\'y a un bois joli,\r\n    Et le rossignol y chante\r\n    Et le jour et la nuit....\r\n\r\n    Que donneriez vous, belle,\r\n    Qui l\'amenerait ici?\r\n    Je donnerai Quebec,\r\n    Sorel et Saint Denis."\r\n\r\n"How was it my French didn\'t go, and your sign-talk did?" Harvey\r\ndemanded when the barter had been distributed among the We\'re Heres.\r\n\r\n"Sign-talk!" Platt guffawed. "Well, yes, \'twas sign-talk, but a heap\r\nolder\'n your French, Harve. Them French boats are chockfull o\'\r\nFreemasons, an\' that\'s why."\r\n\r\n"Are you a Freemason, then?"\r\n\r\n"Looks that way, don\'t it?" said the man-o\'-war\'s man, stuffing his\r\npipe; and Harvey had another mystery of the deep sea to brood upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThe thing that struck him most was the exceedingly casual way in which\r\nsome craft loafed about the broad Atlantic. Fishing-boats, as Dan said,\r\nwere naturally dependent on the courtesy and wisdom of their\r\nneighbours; but one expected better things of steamers. That was after\r\nanother interesting interview, when they had been chased for three\r\nmiles by a big lumbering old cattle-boat, all boarded over on the upper\r\ndeck, that smelt like a thousand cattle-pens. A very excited officer\r\nyelled at them through a speaking-trumpet, and she lay and lollopped\r\nhelplessly on the water while Disko ran the _We\'re Here_ under her lee\r\nand gave the skipper a piece of his mind. "Where might ye be--eh? Ye\r\ndon\'t deserve to be anywheres. You barn-yard tramps go hoggin\' the road\r\non the high seas with no blame consideration fer your neighbours, an\'\r\nyour eyes in your coffee-cups instid o\' in your silly heads."\r\n\r\nAt this the skipper danced on the bridge and said something about\r\nDisko\'s own eyes. "We haven\'t had an observation for three days. D\'you\r\nsuppose we can run her blind?" he shouted.\r\n\r\n"Wa-al, I can," Disko retorted. "What\'s come to your lead? Et it? Can\'t\r\nye smell bottom, or are them cattle too rank?"\r\n\r\n"What d\' ye feed \'em?" said Uncle Salters with intense seriousness, for\r\nthe smell of the pens woke all the farmer in him. "They say they fall\r\noff dretful on a v\'yage. Dunno as it\'s any o\' my business, but I\'ve a\r\nkind o\' notion that oil-cake broke small an\' sprinkled--"\r\n\r\n"Thunder!" said a cattle-man in a red jersey as he looked over the\r\nside. "What asylum did they let His Whiskers out of?"\r\n\r\n"Young feller," Salters began, standing up in the fore-rigging, "let me\r\ntell yeou \'fore we go any further that I\'ve--"\r\n\r\nThe officer on the bridge took off his cap with immense politeness.\r\n"Excuse me," he said, "but I\'ve asked for my reckoning. If the\r\nagricultural person with the hair will kindly shut his head, the\r\nsea-green barnacle with the wall-eye may per-haps condescend to\r\nenlighten us."\r\n\r\n"Naow you\'ve made a show o\' me, Salters," said Disko, angrily. He could\r\nnot stand up to that particular sort of talk, and snapped out the\r\nlatitude and longitude without more lectures.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s a boat-load of lunatics, sure," said the skipper, as he\r\nrang up the engine-room and tossed a bundle of newspapers into the\r\nschooner.\r\n\r\n"Of all the blamed fools, next to you, Salters, him an\' his crowd are\r\nabaout the likeliest I\'ve ever seen," said Disko as the _We\'re Here_\r\nslid away. "I was jest givin\' him my jedgment on lullsikin\' round these\r\nwaters like a lost child, an\' you must cut in with your fool farmin\'.\r\nCan\'t ye never keep things sep\'rate?"\r\n\r\nHarvey, Dan, and the others stood back, winking one to the other and\r\nfull of joy; but Disko and Salters wrangled seriously till evening,\r\nSalters arguing that a cattle-boat was practically a barn on blue\r\nwater, and Disko insisting that, even if this were the case, decency\r\nand fisher-pride demanded that he should have kept "things sep\'rate."\r\nLong Jack stood it in silence for a time,--an angry skipper makes an\r\nunhappy crew,--and then he spoke across the table after supper:\r\n\r\n"Fwhat\'s the good o\' bodderin\' fwhat they\'ll say?" said he.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll tell that tale agin us fer years--that\'s all," said Disko.\r\n"Oil-cake sprinkled!"\r\n\r\n"With salt, o\' course," said Salters, impenitent, reading the farming\r\nreports from a week-old New York paper.\r\n\r\n"It\'s plumb mortifyin\' to all my feelin\'s," the skipper went on.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t see ut that way," said Long Jack, the peacemaker "Look at here,\r\nDisko! Is there another packet afloat this day in this weather cud ha\'\r\nmet a tramp an\' over an\' above givin\' her her reckonin\',--over an\'\r\nabove that, I say,--cud ha\' discoorsed wid her quite intelligent on the\r\nmanagement av steers an\' such at sea? Forgit ut! Av coorse they will\r\nnot. \'Twas the most compenjus conversation that iver accrued. Double\r\ngame an\' twice runnin\'--all to us." Dan kicked Harvey under the table,\r\nand Harvey choked in his cup.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Salters, who felt that his honour had been somewhat\r\nplastered, "I said I didn\'t know as \'twuz any business o\' mine, \'fore I\r\nspoke."\r\n\r\n"An\' right there," said Tom Platt, experienced in discipline and\r\netiquette--"right there, I take it, Disko, you should ha\' asked him to\r\nstop ef the conversation wuz likely, in your jedgment, to be\r\nanyways--what it shouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Dunno but that\'s so," said Disko, who saw his way to an honourable\r\nretreat from a fit of the dignities.\r\n\r\n"Why, o\' course it was so," said Salters, "you bein\' skipper here; an\'\r\nI\'d cheerful hev stopped on a hint--not from any leadin\' or conviction,\r\nbut fer the sake o\' bearin\' an example to these two blame boys of\r\naours."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you, Harve, \'twould come araound to us \'fore we\'d done?\r\nAlways those blame boys. But I wouldn\'t have missed the show fer a\r\nhalf-share in a halibutter," Dan whispered.\r\n\r\n"Still, things should ha\' been kep\' sep\'rate," said Disko, and the\r\nlight of new argument lit in Salters\'s eye as he crumbled cut plug into\r\nhis pipe.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a power av vartue in keepin\' things sep\'rate," said Long Jack,\r\nintent on stilling the storm. "That\'s fwhat Steyning of Steyning and\r\nHare\'s f\'und when he sent Counahan fer skipper on the _Marilla D. Kuhn_,\r\ninstid o\' Cap. Newton that was took with inflam\'try rheumatism an\'\r\ncouldn\'t go. Counahan the Navigator we called him."\r\n\r\n"Nick Counahan he never went aboard fer a night \'thout a pond o\' rum\r\nsomewheres in the manifest," said Tom Platt, playing up to the lead.\r\n"He used to bum araound the c\'mission houses to Boston lookin\' fer the\r\nLord to make him captain of a tow-boat on his merits. Sam Coy, up to\r\nAtlantic Avenoo, give him his board free fer a year or more on account\r\nof his stories.\r\n\r\n"Counahan the Navigator! Tck! Tck! Dead these fifteen year, ain\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Seventeen, I guess. He died the year the _Caspar McVeagh_ was built; but\r\nhe could niver keep things sep\'rate. Steyning tuk him fer the reason\r\nthe thief tuk the hot stove--bekaze there was nothin\' else that season.\r\nThe men was all to the Banks, and Counahan he whacked up an iverlastin\'\r\nhard crowd fer crew. Rum! Ye cud ha\' floated the _Marilla_, insurance an\'\r\nall, in fwhat they stowed aboard her. They lef\' Boston Harbour for the\r\ngreat Grand Bank wid a roarin\' nor\'wester behind \'em an\' all hands full\r\nto the bung. An\' the hivens looked after thim, for divil a watch did\r\nthey set, an\' divil a rope did they lay hand to, till they\'d seen the\r\nbottom av a fifteen-gallon cask o\' bug-juice. That was about wan week,\r\nso far as Counahan remembered. (If I cud only tell the tale as he told\r\nut!) All that whoile the wind blew like ould glory, an\' the\r\n_Marilla_--\'twas summer, and they\'d give her a foretopmast--struck her\r\ngait and kept ut. Then Counahan tuk the hog-yoke an\' thrembled over it\r\nfor a whoile, an\' made out, betwix\' that an\' the chart an\' the singin\'\r\nin his head, that they was to the south\'ard o\' Sable Island, gettin\'\r\nalong glorious, but speakin\' nothin\'. Then they broached another keg,\r\nan\' quit speculatin\' about anythin\' fer another spell. The _Marilla_ she\r\nlay down whin she dropped Boston Light, and she never lufted her\r\nlee-rail up to that time--hustlin\' on one an\' the same slant. But they\r\nsaw no weed, nor gulls, nor schooners; an\' prisintly they obsarved\r\nthey\'d bin out a matter o\' fourteen days and they mis-trusted the Bank\r\nhas suspinded payment. So they sounded, an\' got sixty fathom. \'That\'s\r\nme,\' sez Counahan. \'That\'s me iv\'ry time! I\'ve run her slat on the Bank\r\nfer you, an\' when we get thirty fathom we\'ll turn in like little men.\r\nCounahan is the b\'y,\' sez he. \'Counahan the Navigator!\'\r\n\r\n"Nex\' cast they got ninety. Sez Counahan: \'Either the lead-line\'s tuk\r\nto stretchin\' or else the Bank\'s sunk.\'\r\n\r\n"They hauled ut up, bein\' just about in that state when ut seemed right\r\nan\' reasonable, and sat down on the deck countin\' the knots, an\'\r\ngettin\' her snarled up hijjus. The _Marilla_ she\'d struck her gait, an\'\r\nshe hild ut, an\' prisintly along came a tramp, an\' Counahan spoke her.\r\n\r\n"\'Hev ye seen any fishin\'-boats now?\' sez he, quite casual.\r\n\r\n"\'There\'s lashin\'s av them off the Irish coast,\' sez the tramp.\r\n\r\n"\'Aah! go shake yerself,\' sez Counahan. \'Fwhat have I to do wid the\r\nIrish coast?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Then fwhat are ye doin\' here?\' sez the tramp.\r\n\r\n"\'Sufferin\' Christianity!\' sez Counahan (he always said that whin his\r\npumps sucked an\' he was not feelin\' good)--\'Sufferin\' Christianity!\' he\r\nsez, \'where am I at?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Thirty-five mile west-sou\'west o\' Cape Clear,\' sez the tramp, \'if\r\nthat\'s any consolation to you.\'\r\n\r\n"Counahan fetched wan jump, four feet sivin inches, measured by the\r\ncook.\r\n\r\n"\'Consolation!\' sez he, bould as brass. \'D\'ye take me fer a dialect?\r\nThirty-five mile from Cape Clear, an\' fourteen days from Boston Light.\r\nSufferin\' Christianity, \'tis a record, an\' by the same token I\'ve a\r\nmother to Skibbereen!\' Think av ut! The gall av um! But ye see he could\r\nniver keep things sep\'rate.\r\n\r\n"The crew was mostly Cork an\' Kerry men, barrin\' one Marylander that\r\nwanted to go back, but they called him a mutineer, an\' they ran the\r\nould _Marilla_ into Skibbereen, an\' they had an illigant time visitin\'\r\naround with frinds on the ould sod fer a week. Thin they wint back, an\'\r\nit cost \'em two an\' thirty days to beat to the Banks again. \'Twas\r\ngettin\' on towards fall, and grub was low, so Counahan ran her back to\r\nBoston, wid no more bones to ut."\r\n\r\n"And what did the firm say?" Harvey demanded.\r\n\r\n"Fwhat could they? The fish was on the Banks, an\' Counahan was at\r\nT-wharf talkin\' av his record trip east! They tuk their satisfaction\r\nout av that, an\' ut all came av not keepin\' the crew and the rum\r\nsep\'rate in the first place; an\' confusin\' Skibbereen wid \'Queereau, in\r\nthe second. Counahan the Navigator, rest his sowl! He was an imprompju\r\ncitizen!"\r\n\r\n"Once I was in the Lucy Holmes," said Manuel, in his gentle voice.\r\n"They not want any of her feesh in Gloucester. Eh, wha-at? Give us no\r\nprice. So we go across the water, and think to sell to some Fayal man.\r\nThen it blow fresh, and we cannot see well. Eh, wha-at? Then it blow\r\nsome more fresh, and we go down below and drive very fast--no one know\r\nwhere. By and by we see a land, and it get some hot. Then come two,\r\nthree nigger in a brick. Eh, wha-at? We ask where we are, and they\r\nsay--now, what you all think?"\r\n\r\n"Grand Canary," said Disko, after a moment. Manuel shook his head,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n"Blanco," said Tom Platt.\r\n\r\n"No. Worse than that. We was below Bezagos, and the brick she was from\r\nLiberia! So we sell our feesh there! Not bad, so? Eh, wha-at?"\r\n\r\n"Can a schooner like this go right across to Africa?" said Harvey.\r\n\r\n"Go araound the Horn ef there\'s anythin\' worth goin\' fer, and the grub\r\nholds aout," said Disko. "My father he run his packet, an\' she was a\r\nkind o\' pinkey, abaout fifty ton, I guess,--the Rupert,--he run her\r\nover to Greenland\'s icy mountains the year ha\'af our fleet was tryin\'\r\nafter cod there. An\' what\'s more, he took my mother along with him,--to\r\nshow her haow the money was earned, I presoom,--an\' they was all iced\r\nup, an\' I was born at Disko. Don\'t remember nothin\' abaout it, o\'\r\ncourse. We come back when the ice eased in the spring, but they named\r\nme fer the place. Kinder mean trick to put up on a baby, but we\'re all\r\nbaound to make mistakes in aour lives."\r\n\r\n"Sure! Sure!" said Salters, wagging his head. "All baound to make\r\nmistakes, an\' I tell you two boys here thet after you\'ve made a\r\nmistake--ye don\'t make fewer\'n a hundred a day--the next best thing\'s\r\nto own up to it like men."\r\n\r\nLong Jack winked one tremendous wink that embraced all hands except\r\nDisko and Salters, and the incident was closed.\r\n\r\nThen they made berth after berth to the northward, the dories out\r\nalmost every day, running along the east edge of the Grand Bank in\r\nthirty- to forty-fathom water, and fishing steadily.\r\n\r\nIt was here Harvey first met the squid, who is one of the best\r\ncod-baits, but uncertain in his moods. They were waked out of their\r\nbunks one black night by yells of "Squid O!" from Salters, and for an\r\nhour and a half every soul aboard hung over his squid-jig--a piece of\r\nlead painted red and armed at the lower end with a circle of pins bent\r\nbackward like half-opened umbrella ribs. The squid--for some unknown\r\nreason--likes, and wraps himself round, this thing, and is hauled up\r\nere he can escape from the pins. But as he leaves his home he squirts\r\nfirst water and next ink into his captor\'s face; and it was curious to\r\nsee the men weaving their heads from side to side to dodge the shot.\r\nThey were as black as sweeps when the flurry ended; but a pile of fresh\r\nsquid lay on the deck, and the large cod thinks very well of a little\r\nshiny piece of squid tentacle at the tip of a clam-baited hook. Next\r\nday they caught many fish, and met the _Carrie Pitman_, to whom they\r\nshouted their luck, and she wanted to trade--seven cod for one\r\nfair-sized squid; but Disko would not agree at the price, and the\r\n_Carrie_ dropped sullenly to leeward and anchored half a mile away, in\r\nthe hope of striking on to some for herself.\r\n\r\nDisco said nothing till after supper, when he sent Dan and Manuel out\r\nto buoy the _We\'re Here\'s_ cable and announced his intention of turning\r\nin with the broad-axe. Dan naturally repeated these remarks to the dory\r\nfrom the _Carrie_, who wanted to know why they were buoying their cable,\r\nsince they were not on rocky bottom.\r\n\r\n"Dad sez he wouldn\'t trust a ferryboat within five mile o\' you," Dan\r\nhowled cheerfully.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t he git out, then? Who\'s hinderin\'?" said the other.\r\n\r\n"\'Cause you\'ve jest the same ez lee-bowed him, an\' he don\'t take that\r\nfrom any boat, not to speak o\' sech a driftin\' gurry-butt as you be."\r\n\r\n"She ain\'t driftin\' any this trip," said the man angrily, for the\r\n_Carrie Pitman_ had an unsavory reputation for breaking her ground-tackle.\r\n\r\n"Then haow d\'you make berths?" said Dan. "It\'s her best p\'int o\'\r\nsailin\'. An\' ef she\'s quit driftin\', what in thunder are you doin\' with\r\na new jib-boom?" That shot went home.\r\n\r\n"Hey, you Portugoosy organ-grinder, take your monkey back to\r\nGloucester. Go back to school, Dan Troop," was the answer.\r\n\r\n"O-ver-alls! O-ver-alls!" yelled Dan, who knew that one of the _Carrie\'s_\r\ncrew had worked in an overall factory the winter before.\r\n\r\n"Shrimp! Gloucester shrimp! Git aout, you Novy!"\r\n\r\nTo call a Gloucester man a Nova Scotian is not well received. Dan\r\nanswered in kind.\r\n\r\n"Novy yourself, ye Scrabble-towners! ye Chatham wreckers! Git aout with\r\nyour brick in your stockin\'!" And the forces separated, but Chatham\r\nhad the worst of it.\r\n\r\n"I knew haow \'twould be," said Disko. "She\'s drawed the wind raound\r\nalready. Some one oughter put a deesist on thet packet. She\'ll snore\r\ntill midnight, an\' jest when we\'re gettin\' our sleep she\'ll strike\r\nadrift. Good job we ain\'t crowded with craft hereaways. But I ain\'t\r\ngoin\' to up anchor fer Chatham. She may hold."\r\n\r\nThe wind, which had hauled round, rose at sundown and blew steadily.\r\nThere was not enough sea, though, to disturb even a dory\'s tackle, but\r\nthe _Carrie Pitman_ was a law unto herself. At the end of the boys\' watch\r\nthey heard the crack-crack-crack of a huge muzzle-loading revolver\r\naboard her.\r\n\r\n"Glory, glory, hallelujah!" sung Dan. "Here she comes, Dad; butt-end\r\nfirst, walkin\' in her sleep same\'s she done on \'Queereau."\r\n\r\nHad she been any other boat Disko would have taken his chances, but now\r\nhe cut the cable as the _Carrie Pitman_, with all the North Atlantic to\r\nplay in, lurched down directly upon them. The _We\'re Here_, under jib\r\nand riding-sail, gave her no more room than was absolutely\r\nnecessary,--Disko did not wish to spend a week hunting for his\r\ncable,--but scuttled up into the wind as the _Carrie_ passed within easy\r\nhail, a silent and angry boat, at the mercy of a raking broadside of\r\nBank chaff.\r\n\r\n"Good evenin\'," said Disko, raising his head-gear, "an\' haow does your\r\ngarden grow?"\r\n\r\n"Go to Ohio an\' hire a mule," said Uncle Salters. "We don\'t want no\r\nfarmers here."\r\n\r\n"Will I lend YOU my dory-anchor?" cried Long Jack.\r\n\r\n"Unship your rudder an\' stick it in the mud," bawled Tom Platt.\r\n\r\n"Say!" Dan\'s voice rose shrill and high, as he stood on the wheel-box.\r\n"Sa-ay! Is there a strike in the o-ver-all factory; or hev they hired\r\ngirls, ye Shackamaxons?"\r\n\r\n"Veer out the tiller-lines," cried Harvey, "and nail \'em to the\r\nbottom!" That was a salt-flavoured jest he had been put up to by Tom\r\nPlatt. Manuel leaned over the stern and yelled: "Johanna Morgan play\r\nthe organ! Ahaaaa!" He flourished his broad thumb with a gesture of\r\nunspeakable contempt and derision, while little Penn covered himself\r\nwith glory by piping up: "Gee a little! Hssh! Come here. Haw!"\r\n\r\nThey rode on their chain for the rest of the night, a short, snappy,\r\nuneasy motion, as Harvey found, and wasted half the forenoon recovering\r\nthe cable. But the boys agreed the trouble was cheap at the price of\r\ntriumph and glory, and they thought with grief over all the beautiful\r\nthings that they might have said to the discomfited _Carrie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nNext day they fell in with more sails, all circling slowly from the\r\neast northerly towards the west. But just when they expected to make\r\nthe shoals by the Virgin the fog shut down, and they anchored,\r\nsurrounded by the tinklings of invisible bells. There was not much\r\nfishing, but occasionally dory met dory in the fog and exchanged news.\r\n\r\nThat night, a little before dawn, Dan and Harvey, who had been sleeping\r\nmost of the day, tumbled out to "hook" fried pies. There was no reason\r\nwhy they should not have taken them openly; but they tasted better so,\r\nand it made the cook angry. The heat and smell below drove them on deck\r\nwith their plunder, and they found Disko at the bell, which he handed\r\nover to Harvey.\r\n\r\n"Keep her goin\'," said he. "I mistrust I hear somethin\'. Ef it\'s\r\nanything, I\'m best where I am so\'s to get at things."\r\n\r\nIt was a forlorn little jingle; the thick air seemed to pinch it off,\r\nand in the pauses Harvey heard the muffled shriek of a liner\'s siren,\r\nand he knew enough of the Banks to know what that meant. It came to\r\nhim, with horrible distinctness, how a boy in a cherry-coloured\r\njersey--he despised fancy blazers now with all a fisher-man\'s\r\ncontempt--how an ignorant, rowdy boy had once said it would be "great"\r\nif a steamer ran down a fishing-boat. That boy had a stateroom with a\r\nhot and cold bath, and spent ten minutes each morning picking over a\r\ngilt-edged bill of fare. And that same boy--no, his very much older\r\nbrother--was up at four of the dim dawn in streaming, crackling\r\noilskins, hammering, literally for the dear life, on a bell smaller\r\nthan the steward\'s breakfast-bell, while somewhere close at hand a\r\nthirty-foot steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour! The\r\nbitterest thought of all was that there were folks asleep in dry,\r\nupholstered cabins who would never learn that they had massacred a boat\r\nbefore breakfast. So Harvey rang the bell.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they slow daown one turn o\' their blame propeller," said Dan,\r\napplying himself to Manuel\'s conch, "fer to keep inside the law, an\'\r\nthat\'s consolin\' when we\'re all at the bottom. Hark to her! She\'s a\r\nhumper!"\r\n\r\n"Aooo-whoo-whupp!" went the siren. "Wingle-tingle-tink," went the bell.\r\n"Graaa-ouch!" went the conch, while sea and sky were all mired up in\r\nmilky fog. Then Harvey felt that he was near a moving body, and found\r\nhimself looking up and up at the wet edge of a cliff-like bow, leaping,\r\nit seemed, directly over the schooner. A jaunty little feather of water\r\ncurled in front of it, and as it lifted it showed a long ladder of\r\nRoman numerals-XV., XVI., XVII., XVIII., and so forth--on a\r\nsalmon-coloured gleaming side. It tilted forward and downward with a\r\nheart-stilling "Ssssooo"; the ladder disappeared; a line of\r\nbrass-rimmed port-holes flashed past; a jet of steam puffed in Harvey\'s\r\nhelplessly uplifted hands; a spout of hot water roared along the rail\r\nof the _We\'re Here_, and the little schooner staggered and shook in a\r\nrush of screw-torn water, as a liner\'s stern vanished in the fog.\r\nHarvey got ready to faint or be sick, or both, when he heard a crack\r\nlike a trunk thrown on a sidewalk, and, all small in his ear, a\r\nfar-away telephone voice drawling: "Heave to! You\'ve sunk us!"\r\n\r\n"Is it us?" he gasped.\r\n\r\n"No! Boat out yonder. Ring! We\'re goin\' to look," said Dan, running out\r\na dory.\r\n\r\nIn half a minute all except Harvey, Penn, and the cook were overside\r\nand away. Presently a schooner\'s stump-foremast, snapped clean across,\r\ndrifted past the bows. Then an empty green dory came by, knocking on\r\nthe _We\'re Here\'s_ side, as though she wished to be taken in. Then\r\nfollowed something, face down, in a blue jersey, but--it was not the\r\nwhole of a man. Penn changed colour and caught his breath with a click.\r\nHarvey pounded despairingly at the bell, for he feared they might be\r\nsunk at any minute, and he jumped at Dan\'s hail as the crew came back.\r\n\r\n"The Jennie Cushman," said Dan, hysterically, "cut clean in\r\nhalf--graound up an\' trompled on at that! Not a quarter of a mile away.\r\nDad\'s got the old man. There ain\'t any one else, and--there was his\r\nson, too. Oh, Harve, Harve, I can\'t stand it! I\'ve seen--" He dropped\r\nhis head on his arms and sobbed while the others dragged a gray-headed\r\nman aboard.\r\n\r\n"What did you pick me up for?" the stranger groaned. "Disko, what did\r\nyou pick me up for?"\r\n\r\nDisko dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder, for the man\'s eyes were\r\nwild and his lips trembled as he stared at the silent crew. Then up and\r\nspoke Pennsylvania Pratt, who was also Haskins or Rich or McVitty when\r\nUncle Salters forgot; and his face was changed on him from the face of\r\na fool to the countenance of an old, wise man, and he said in a strong\r\nvoice: "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the\r\nname of the Lord! I was--I am a minister of the Gospel. Leave him to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you be, be you?" said the man. "Then pray my son back to me! Pray\r\nback a nine-thousand-dollar boat an\' a thousand quintal of fish. If\r\nyou\'d left me alone my widow could ha\' gone on to the Provident an\'\r\nworked fer her board, an\' never known--an\' never known. Now I\'ll hev to\r\ntell her."\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t nothin\' to say," said Disko. "Better lie down a piece,\r\nJason Olley."\r\n\r\nWhen a man has lost his only son, his summer\'s work, and his means of\r\nlivelihood, in thirty counted seconds, it is hard to give consolation.\r\n\r\n"All Gloucester men, wasn\'t they?" said Tom Platt, fiddling helplessly\r\nwith a dory-becket.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that don\'t make no odds," said Jason, wringing the wet from his\r\nbeard. "I\'ll be rowin\' summer boarders araound East Gloucester this\r\nfall." He rolled heavily to the rail, singing:\r\n\r\n  "Happy birds that sing and fly\r\n  Round thine altars, O Most High!"\r\n\r\n"Come with me. Come below!" said Penn, as though he had a right to give\r\norders. Their eyes met and fought for a quarter of a minute.\r\n\r\n"I dunno who you be, but I\'ll come," said Jason submissively. "Mebbe\r\nI\'ll get back some o\' the--some o\' the-nine thousand dollars." Penn led\r\nhim into the cabin and slid the door behind.\r\n\r\n"That ain\'t Penn," cried Uncle Salters. "It\'s Jacob Boiler, an\'--he\'s\r\nremembered Johnstown! I never seed such eyes in any livin\' man\'s head.\r\nWhat\'s to do naow? What\'ll I do naow?"\r\n\r\nThey could hear Penn\'s voice and Jason\'s together. Then Penn\'s went on\r\nalone, and Salters slipped off his hat, for Penn was praying. Presently\r\nthe little man came up the steps, huge drops of sweat on his face, and\r\nlooked at the crew. Dan was still sobbing by the wheel.\r\n\r\n"He don\'t know us," Salters groaned. "It\'s all to do over again,\r\ncheckers and everything--an\' what\'ll he say to me?"\r\n\r\nPenn spoke; they could hear that it was to strangers. "I have prayed,"\r\nsaid he. "Our people believe in prayer. I have prayed for the life of\r\nthis man\'s son. Mine were drowned before my eyes--she and my eldest\r\nand--the others. Shall a man be more wise than his Maker? I prayed\r\nnever for their lives, but I have prayed for this man\'s son, and he\r\nwill surely be sent him."\r\n\r\nSalters looked pleadingly at Penn to see if he remembered.\r\n\r\n"How long have I been mad?" Penn asked suddenly. His mouth was\r\ntwitching.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw, Penn! You weren\'t never mad," Salters began "Only a little\r\ndistracted like."\r\n\r\n"I saw the houses strike the bridge before the fires broke out. I do\r\nnot remember any more. How long ago is that?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t stand it! I can\'t stand it!" cried Dan, and Harvey whimpered\r\nin sympathy.\r\n\r\n"Abaout five year," said Disko, in a shaking voice.\r\n\r\n"Then I have been a charge on some one for every day of that time. Who\r\nwas the man?"\r\n\r\nDisko pointed to Salters.\r\n\r\n"Ye hain\'t--ye hain\'t!" cried the sea-farmer, twisting his hands\r\ntogether. "Ye\'ve more\'n earned your keep twice-told; an\' there\'s money\r\nowin\' you, Penn, besides ha\'af o\' my quarter-share in the boat, which\r\nis yours fer value received."\r\n\r\n"You are good men. I can see that in your faces. But--"\r\n\r\n"Mother av Mercy," whispered Long Jack, "an\' he\'s been wid us all these\r\ntrips! He\'s clean bewitched."\r\n\r\nA schooner\'s bell struck up alongside, and a voice hailed through the\r\nfog: "O Disko! \'Heard abaout the Jennie Cushman?"\r\n\r\n"They have found his son," cried Penn. "Stand you still and see the\r\nsalvation of the Lord!"\r\n\r\n"Got Jason aboard here," Disko answered, but his voice quavered.\r\n"There--warn\'t any one else?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve fund one, though. \'Run acrost him snarled up in a mess o\' lumber\r\nthet might ha\' bin a foc\'sle. His head\'s cut some."\r\n\r\n"Who is he?"\r\n\r\nThe _We\'re Here\'s_ heart-beats answered one another.\r\n\r\n"Guess it\'s young Olley," the voice drawled.\r\n\r\nPenn raised his hands and said something in German. Harvey could have\r\nsworn that a bright sun was shining upon his lifted face; but the drawl\r\nwent on: "Sa-ay! You fellers guyed us consid\'rable t\'other night."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t feel like guyin\' any now," said Disko.\r\n\r\n"I know it; but to tell the honest truth we was kinder--kinder driftin\'\r\nwhen we run agin young Olley."\r\n\r\nIt was the irrepressible _Carrie Pitman_, and a roar of unsteady laughter\r\nwent up from the deck of the _We\'re Here_.\r\n\r\n"Hedn\'t you \'baout\'s well send the old man aboard? We\'re runnin\' in fer\r\nmore bait an\' graound-tackle. Guess you won\'t want him, anyway, an\'\r\nthis blame windlass work makes us short-handed. We\'ll take care of him.\r\nHe married my woman\'s aunt."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give you anything in the boat," said Troop.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t want nothin\', \'less, mebbe, an anchor that\'ll hold. Say! Young\r\nOlley\'s gittin\' kinder baulky an\' excited. Send the old man along."\r\n\r\nPenn waked him from his stupor of despair, and Tom Platt rowed him\r\nover. He went away without a word of thanks, not knowing what was to\r\ncome; and the fog closed over all.\r\n\r\n"And now," said Penn, drawing a deep breath as though about to preach.\r\n"And now"--the erect body sank like a sword driven home into the\r\nscabbard; the light faded from the overbright eyes; the voice returned\r\nto its usual pitiful little titter--"and now," said Pennsylvania Pratt,\r\n"do you think it\'s too early for a little game of checkers, Mr.\r\nSalters?"\r\n\r\n"The very thing--the very thing I was goin\' to say myself," cried\r\nSalters promptly. "It beats all, Penn, how ye git on to what\'s in a\r\nman\'s mind."\r\n\r\nThe little fellow blushed and meekly followed Salters forward.\r\n\r\n"Up anchor! Hurry! Let\'s quit these crazy waters," shouted Disko, and\r\nnever was he more swiftly obeyed.\r\n\r\n"Now what in creation d\'ye suppose is the meanin\' o\' that all?" said\r\nLong Jack, when they were working through the fog once more, damp,\r\ndripping, and bewildered.\r\n\r\n"The way I sense it," said Disko, at the wheel, "is this: The Jennie\r\nCushman business comin\' on an empty stummick--"\r\n\r\n"H-he saw one of them go by," sobbed Harvey.\r\n\r\n"An\' that, o\' course, kinder hove him outer water, julluk runnin\' a\r\ncraft ashore; hove him right aout, I take it, to rememberin\' Johnstown\r\nan\' Jacob Boiler an\' such-like reminiscences. Well, consolin\' Jason\r\nthere held him up a piece, same\'s shorin\' up a boat. Then, bein\' weak,\r\nthem props slipped an\' slipped, an\' he slided down the ways, an\' naow\r\nhe\'s water-borne agin. That\'s haow I sense it."\r\n\r\nThey decided that Disko was entirely correct.\r\n\r\n"\'Twould ha\' bruk Salters all up," said Long Jack, "if Penn had stayed\r\nJacob Boilerin\'. Did ye see his face when Penn asked who he\'d been\r\ncharged on all these years? How is ut, Salters?"\r\n\r\n"Asleep--dead asleep. Turned in like a child," Salters replied,\r\ntiptoeing aft. "There won\'t be no grub till he wakes, natural. Did ye\r\never see sech a gift in prayer? He everlastin\'ly hiked young Olley\r\nouter the ocean. Thet\'s my belief. Jason was tur\'ble praoud of his boy,\r\nan\' I mistrusted all along \'twas a jedgment on worshippin\' vain idols."\r\n\r\n"There\'s others jes as sot," said Disko.\r\n\r\n"That\'s difrunt," Salters retorted quickly. "Penn\'s not all caulked,\r\nan\' I ain\'t only but doin\' my duty by him."\r\n\r\nThey waited, those hungry men, three hours, till Penn reappeared with a\r\nsmooth face and a blank mind. He said he believed that he had been\r\ndreaming. Then he wanted to know why they were so silent, and they\r\ncould not tell him.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisko worked all hands mercilessly for the next three or four days; and\r\nwhen they could not go out, turned them into the hold to stack the\r\nship\'s stores into smaller compass, to make more room for the fish. The\r\npacked mass ran from the cabin partition to the sliding door behind the\r\nfoc\'sle stove; and Disko showed how there is great art in stowing cargo\r\nso as to bring a schooner to her best draft. The crew were thus kept\r\nlively till they recovered their spirits; and Harvey was tickled with a\r\nrope\'s end by Long Jack for being, as the Galway man said, "sorrowful\r\nas a sick cat over fwhat couldn\'t be helped." He did a great deal of\r\nthinking in those weary days, and told Dan what he thought, and Dan\r\nagreed with him--even to the extent of asking for fried pies instead of\r\nhooking them.\r\n\r\nBut a week later the two nearly upset the Hattie S. in a wild attempt\r\nto stab a shark with an old bayonet tied to a stick. The grim brute\r\nrubbed alongside the dory begging for small fish, and between the three\r\nof them it was a mercy they all got off alive.\r\n\r\nAt last, after playing blindman\'s-buff in the fog, there came a morning\r\nwhen Disko shouted down the foc\'sle: "Hurry, boys! We\'re in taown!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTo the end of his days, Harvey will never forget that sight. The sun\r\nwas just clear of the horizon they had not seen for nearly a week, and\r\nhis low red light struck into the riding-sails of three fleets of\r\nanchored schooners--one to the north, one to the westward, and one to\r\nthe south. There must have been nearly a hundred of them, of every\r\npossible make and build, with, far away, a square-rigged Frenchman, all\r\nbowing and courtesying one to the other. From every boat dories were\r\ndropping away like bees from a crowded hive, and the clamour of voices,\r\nthe rattling of ropes and blocks, and the splash of the oars carried\r\nfor miles across the heaving water. The sails turned all colours,\r\nblack, pearly-gray, and white, as the sun mounted; and more boats swung\r\nup through the mists to the southward.\r\n\r\nThe dories gathered in clusters, separated, reformed, and broke again,\r\nall heading one way; while men hailed and whistled and cat-called and\r\nsang, and the water was speckled with rubbish thrown overboard.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a town," said Harvey. "Disko was right. It IS a town!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen smaller," said Disko. "There\'s about a thousand men here;\r\nan\' yonder\'s the Virgin." He pointed to a vacant space of greenish sea,\r\nwhere there were no dories.\r\n\r\nThe _We\'re Here_ skirted round the northern squadron, Disko waving his\r\nhand to friend after friend, and anchored as nearly as a racing yacht\r\nat the end of the season. The Bank fleet pass good seamanship in\r\nsilence; but a bungler is jeered all along the line.\r\n\r\n"Jest in time fer the caplin," cried the Mary Chilton.\r\n\r\n"\'Salt \'most wet?" asked the King Philip.\r\n\r\n"Hey, Tom Platt! Come t\' supper to-night?" said the Henry Clay; and so\r\nquestions and answers flew back and forth. Men had met one another\r\nbefore, dory-fishing in the fog, and there is no place for gossip like\r\nthe Bank fleet. They all seemed to know about Harvey\'s rescue, and\r\nasked if he were worth his salt yet. The young bloods jested with Dan,\r\nwho had a lively tongue of his own, and inquired after their health by\r\nthe town-nicknames they least liked. Manuel\'s countrymen jabbered at\r\nhim in their own language; and even the silent cook was seen riding the\r\njib-boom and shouting Gaelic to a friend as black as himself. After\r\nthey had buoyed the cable--all around the Virgin is rocky bottom, and\r\ncarelessness means chafed ground-tackle and danger from drifting--after\r\nthey had buoyed the cable, their dories went forth to join the mob of\r\nboats anchored about a mile away. The schooners rocked and dipped at a\r\nsafe distance, like mother ducks watching their brood, while the dories\r\nbehaved like mannerless ducklings.\r\n\r\nAs they drove into the confusion, boat banging boat, Harvey\'s ears\r\ntingled at the comments on his rowing. Every dialect from Labrador to\r\nLong Island, with Portuguese, Neapolitan, Lingua Franca, French, and\r\nGaelic, with songs and shoutings and new oaths, rattled round him, and\r\nhe seemed to be the butt of it all. For the first time in his life he\r\nfelt shy--perhaps that came from living so long with only the _We\'re\r\nHeres_--among the scores of wild faces that rose and fell with the\r\nreeling small craft. A gentle, breathing swell, three furlongs from\r\ntrough to barrel, would quietly shoulder up a string of variously\r\npainted dories. They hung for an instant, a wonderful frieze against\r\nthe sky-line, and their men pointed and hailed. Next moment the open\r\nmouths, waving arms, and bare chests disappeared, while on another\r\nswell came up an entirely new line of characters like paper figures in\r\na toy theatre. So Harvey stared. "Watch out!" said Dan, flourishing a\r\ndip-net "When I tell you dip, you dip. The caplin\'ll school any time\r\nfrom naow on. Where\'ll we lay, Tom Platt?"\r\n\r\nPushing, shoving, and hauling, greeting old friends here and warning\r\nold enemies there, Commodore Tom Platt led his little fleet well to\r\nleeward of the general crowd, and immediately three or four men began\r\nto haul on their anchors with intent to lee-bow the _We\'re Heres_. But\r\na yell of laughter went up as a dory shot from her station with\r\nexceeding speed, its occupant pulling madly on the roding.\r\n\r\n"Give her slack!" roared twenty voices. "Let him shake it out."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" said Harvey, as the boat flashed away to the\r\nsouthward. "He\'s anchored, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Anchored, sure enough, but his graound-tackle\'s kinder shifty," said\r\nDan, laughing. "Whale\'s fouled it. . . . Dip Harve! Here they come!"\r\n\r\nThe sea round them clouded and darkened, and then frizzed up in showers\r\nof tiny silver fish, and over a space of five or six acres the cod\r\nbegan to leap like trout in May; while behind the cod three or four\r\nbroad gray-backs broke the water into boils.\r\n\r\nThen everybody shouted and tried to haul up his anchor to get among the\r\nschool, and fouled his neighbour\'s line and said what was in his heart,\r\nand dipped furiously with his dip-net, and shrieked cautions and advice\r\nto his companions, while the deep fizzed like freshly opened\r\nsoda-water, and cod, men, and whales together flung in upon the\r\nluckless bait. Harvey was nearly knocked overboard by the handle of\r\nDan\'s net. But in all the wild tumult he noticed, and never forgot, the\r\nwicked, set little eye--something like a circus elephant\'s eye--of a\r\nwhale that drove along almost level with the water, and, so he said,\r\nwinked at him. Three boats found their rodings fouled by these reckless\r\nmid-sea hunters, and were towed half a mile ere their horses shook the\r\nline free.\r\n\r\nThen the caplin moved off, and five minutes later there was no sound\r\nexcept the splash of the sinkers overside, the flapping of the cod, and\r\nthe whack of the muckles as the men stunned them. It was wonderful\r\nfishing. Harvey could see the glimmering cod below, swimming slowly in\r\ndroves, biting as steadily as they swam. Bank law strictly forbids more\r\nthan one hook on one line when the dories are on the Virgin or the\r\nEastern Shoals; but so close lay the boats that even single hooks\r\nsnarled, and Harvey found himself in hot argument with a gentle, hairy\r\nNewfoundlander on one side and a howling Portuguese on the other.\r\n\r\nWorse than any tangle of fishing-lines was the confusion of the\r\ndory-rodings below water. Each man had anchored where it seemed good to\r\nhim, drifting and rowing round his fixed point. As the fish struck on\r\nless quickly, each man wanted to haul up and get to better ground; but\r\nevery third man found himself intimately connected with some four or\r\nfive neighbours. To cut another\'s roding is crime unspeakable on the\r\nBanks; yet it was done, and done without detection, three or four times\r\nthat day. Tom Platt caught a Maine man in the black act and knocked him\r\nover the gunwale with an oar, and Manuel served a fellow-countryman in\r\nthe same way. But Harvey\'s anchor-line was cut, and so was Penn\'s, and\r\nthey were turned into relief-boats to carry fish to the _We\'re Here_ as\r\nthe dories filled. The caplin schooled once more at twilight, when the\r\nmad clamour was repeated; and at dusk they rowed back to dress down by\r\nthe light of kerosene-lamps on the edge of the pen.\r\n\r\nIt was a huge pile, and they went to sleep while they were dressing.\r\nNext day several boats fished right above the cap of the Virgin; and\r\nHarvey, with them, looked down on the very weed of that lonely rock,\r\nwhich rises to within twenty feet of the surface. The cod were there in\r\nlegions, marching solemnly over the leathery kelp. When they bit, they\r\nbit all together; and so when they stopped. There was a slack time at\r\nnoon, and the dories began to search for amusement. It was Dan who\r\nsighted the Hope Of Prague just coming up, and as her boats joined the\r\ncompany they were greeted with the question: "Who\'s the meanest man in\r\nthe Fleet?"\r\n\r\nThree hundred voices answered cheerily: "Nick Bra-ady." It sounded like\r\nan organ chant.\r\n\r\n"Who stole the lampwicks?" That was Dan\'s contribution.\r\n\r\n"Nick Bra-ady," sang the boats.\r\n\r\n"Who biled the salt bait fer soup?" This was an unknown backbiter a\r\nquarter of a mile away.\r\n\r\nAgain the joyful chorus. Now, Brady was not especially mean, but he had\r\nthat reputation, and the Fleet made the most of it. Then they\r\ndiscovered a man from a Truro boat who, six years before, had been\r\nconvicted of using a tackle with five or six hooks--a "scrowger," they\r\ncall it--in the Shoals. Naturally, he had been christened "Scrowger\r\nJim"; and though he had hidden himself on the Georges ever since, he\r\nfound his honours waiting for him full blown. They took it up in a sort\r\nof firecracker chorus: "Jim! O Jim! Jim! O Jim! Sssscrowger Jim!" That\r\npleased everybody. And when a poetical Beverly man--he had been making\r\nit up all day, and talked about it for weeks--sang, "The _Carrie\r\nPitman\'s_ anchor doesn\'t hold her for a cent" the dories felt that they\r\nwere indeed fortunate. Then they had to ask that Beverly man how he was\r\noff for beans, because even poets must not have things all their own\r\nway. Every schooner and nearly every man got it in turn. Was there a\r\ncareless or dirty cook anywhere? The dories sang about him and his\r\nfood. Was a schooner badly found? The Fleet was told at full length.\r\nHad a man hooked tobacco from a mess-mate? He was named in meeting; the\r\nname tossed from roller to roller. Disko\'s infallible judgments, Long\r\nJack\'s market-boat that he had sold years ago, Dan\'s sweetheart (oh,\r\nbut Dan was an angry boy!), Penn\'s bad luck with dory-anchors, Salter\'s\r\nviews on manure, Manuel\'s little slips from virtue ashore, and Harvey\'s\r\nladylike handling of the oar--all were laid before the public; and as\r\nthe fog fell around them in silvery sheets beneath the sun, the voices\r\nsounded like a bench of invisible judges pronouncing sentence.\r\n\r\nThe dories roved and fished and squabbled till a swell underran the\r\nsea. Then they drew more apart to save their sides, and some one called\r\nthat if the swell continued the Virgin would break. A reckless Galway\r\nman with his nephew denied this, hauled up anchor, and rowed over the\r\nvery rock itself. Many voices called them to come away, while others\r\ndared them to hold on. As the smooth-backed rollers passed to the\r\nsouthward, they hove the dory high and high into the mist, and dropped\r\nher in ugly, sucking, dimpled water, where she spun round her anchor,\r\nwithin a foot or two of the hidden rock. It was playing with death for\r\nmere bravado; and the boats looked on in uneasy silence till Long Jack\r\nrowed up behind his countrymen and quietly cut their roding.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t ye hear ut knockin\'?" he cried. "Pull for you miserable lives!\r\nPull!"\r\n\r\nThe men swore and tried to argue as the boat drifted; but the next\r\nswell checked a little, like a man tripping on a carpet. There was a\r\ndeep sob and a gathering roar, and the Virgin flung up a couple of\r\nacres of foaming water, white, furious, and ghastly over the shoal sea.\r\nThen all the boats greatly applauded Long Jack, and the Galway men held\r\ntheir tongue.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t it elegant?" said Dan, bobbing like a young seal at home.\r\n"She\'ll break about once every ha\'af hour now, \'les the swell piles up\r\ngood. What\'s her reg\'lar time when she\'s at work, Tom Platt?"\r\n\r\n"Once ivry fifteen minutes, to the tick. Harve, you\'ve seen the\r\ngreatest thing on the Banks; an\' but for Long Jack you\'d seen some dead\r\nmen too."\r\n\r\nThere came a sound of merriment where the fog lay thicker and the\r\nschooners were ringing their bells. A big bark nosed cautiously out of\r\nthe mist, and was received with shouts and cries of, "Come along,\r\ndarlin\'," from the Irishry.\r\n\r\n"Another Frenchman?" said Harvey.\r\n\r\n"Hain\'t you eyes? She\'s a Baltimore boat; goin\' in fear an\' tremblin\',"\r\nsaid Dan. "We\'ll guy the very sticks out of her. Guess it\'s the fust\r\ntime her skipper ever met up with the Fleet this way."\r\n\r\nShe was a black, buxom, eight-hundred-ton craft. Her mainsail was\r\nlooped up, and her topsail flapped undecidedly in what little wind was\r\nmoving. Now a bark is feminine beyond all other daughters of the sea,\r\nand this tall, hesitating creature, with her white and gilt figurehead,\r\nlooked just like a bewildered woman half lifting her skirts to cross a\r\nmuddy street under the jeers of bad little boys. That was very much her\r\nsituation. She knew she was somewhere in the neighbourhood of the\r\nVirgin, had caught the roar of it, and was, therefore, asking her way.\r\nThis is a small part of what she heard from the dancing dories:\r\n\r\n"The Virgin? Fwhat are you talkin\' of? \'This is Le Have on a Sunday\r\nmornin\'. Go home an\' sober up."\r\n\r\n"Go home, ye tarrapin! Go home an\' tell \'em we\'re comin\'."\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen voices together, in a most tuneful chorus, as her stern\r\nwent down with a roll and a bubble into the troughs:\r\n"Thay-aah-she-strikes!"\r\n\r\n"Hard up! Hard up fer your life! You\'re on top of her now."\r\n\r\n"Daown! Hard daown! Let go everything!"\r\n\r\n"All hands to the pumps!"\r\n\r\n"Daown jib an\' pole her!"\r\n\r\nHere the skipper lost his temper and said things. Instantly fishing was\r\nsuspended to answer him, and he heard many curious facts about his boat\r\nand her next port of call. They asked him if he were insured; and\r\nwhence he had stolen his anchor, because, they said, it belonged to the\r\n_Carrie Pitman_; they called his boat a mud-scow, and accused him of\r\ndumping garbage to frighten the fish; they offered to tow him and\r\ncharge it to his wife; and one audacious youth slipped up almost under\r\nthe counter, smacked it with his open palm, and yelled: "Gid up, Buck!"\r\n\r\nThe cook emptied a pan of ashes on him, and he replied with cod-heads.\r\nThe bark\'s crew fired small coal from the galley, and the dories\r\nthreatened to come aboard and "razee" her. They would have warned her\r\nat once had she been in real peril; but, seeing her well clear of the\r\nVirgin, they made the most of their chances. The fun was spoilt when\r\nthe rock spoke again, a half-mile to windward, and the tormented bark\r\nset everything that would draw and went her ways; but the dories felt\r\nthat the honours lay with them.\r\n\r\nAll that night the Virgin roared hoarsely; and next morning, over an\r\nangry, white-headed sea, Harvey saw the Fleet with flickering masts\r\nwaiting for a lead. Not a dory was hove out till ten o\'clock, when the\r\ntwo Jeraulds of the Day\'s Eye, imagining a lull which did not exist,\r\nset the example. In a minute half the boats were out and bobbing in the\r\ncockly swells, but Troop kept the _We\'re Heres_ at work dressing down.\r\nHe saw no sense in "dares"; and as the storm grew that evening they had\r\nthe pleasure of receiving wet strangers only too glad to make any\r\nrefuge in the gale. The boys stood by the dory-tackles with lanterns,\r\nthe men ready to haul, one eye cocked for the sweeping wave that would\r\nmake them drop everything and hold on for dear life. Out of the dark\r\nwould come a yell of "Dory, dory!" They would hook up and haul in a\r\ndrenched man and a half-sunk boat, till their decks were littered down\r\nwith nests of dories and the bunks were full. Five times in their watch\r\ndid Harvey, with Dan, jump at the foregaff where it lay lashed on the\r\nboom, and cling with arms, legs, and teeth to rope and spar and sodden\r\ncanvas as a big wave filled the decks. One dory was smashed to pieces,\r\nand the sea pitched the man head first on to the decks, cutting his\r\nforehead open; and about dawn, when the racing seas glimmered white all\r\nalong their cold edges, another man, blue and ghastly, crawled in with\r\na broken hand, asking news of his brother. Seven extra mouths sat down\r\nto breakfast: A Swede; a Chatham skipper; a boy from Hancock, Maine;\r\none Duxbury, and three Provincetown men.\r\n\r\nThere was a general sorting out among the Fleet next day; and though no\r\none said anything, all ate with better appetites when boat after boat\r\nreported full crews aboard. Only a couple of Portuguese and an old man\r\nfrom Gloucester were drowned, but many were cut or bruised; and two\r\nschooners had parted their tackle and been blown to the southward,\r\nthree days\' sail. A man died on a Frenchman--it was the same bark that\r\nhad traded tobacco with the _We\'re Heres_. She slipped away quite\r\nquietly one wet, white morning, moved to a patch of deep water, her\r\nsails all hanging anyhow, and Harvey saw the funeral through Disko\'s\r\nspy-glass. It was only an oblong bundle slid overside. They did not\r\nseem to have any form of service, but in the night, at anchor, Harvey\r\nheard them across the star-powdered black water, singing something that\r\nsounded like a hymn. It went to a very slow tune.\r\n\r\n    "La brigantine\r\n    Qui va tourner,\r\n    Roule et s\'incline\r\n    Pour m\'entrainer.\r\n    Oh, Vierge Marie,\r\n    Pour moi priez Dieu!\r\n    Adieu, patrie;\r\n    Quebec, adieu!"\r\n\r\nTom Platt visited her, because, he said, the dead man was his brother\r\nas a Freemason. It came out that a wave had doubled the poor fellow\r\nover the heel of the bowsprit and broken his back. The news spread like\r\na flash, for, contrary to general custom, the Frenchman held an auction\r\nof the dead man\'s kit,--he had no friends at St Malo or Miquelon,--and\r\neverything was spread out on the top of the house, from his red knitted\r\ncap to the leather belt with the sheath-knife at the back. Dan and\r\nHarvey were out on twenty-fathom water in the Hattie S., and naturally\r\nrowed over to join the crowd. It was a long pull, and they stayed some\r\nlittle time while Dan bought the knife, which had a curious brass\r\nhandle. When they dropped overside and pushed off into a drizzle of\r\nrain and a lop of sea, it occurred to them that they might get into\r\ntrouble for neglecting the lines.\r\n\r\n"Guess \'twon\'t hurt us any to be warmed up," said Dan, shivering under\r\nhis oilskins, and they rowed on into the heart of a white fog, which,\r\nas usual, dropped on them without warning.\r\n\r\n"There\'s too much blame tide hereabouts to trust to your instinks," he\r\nsaid. "Heave over the anchor, Harve, and we\'ll fish a piece till the\r\nthing lifts. Bend on your biggest lead. Three pound ain\'t any too much\r\nin this water. See how she\'s tightened on her rodin\' already."\r\n\r\nThere was quite a little bubble at the bows, where some irresponsible\r\nBank current held the dory full stretch on her rope; but they could not\r\nsee a boat\'s length in any direction. Harvey turned up his collar and\r\nbunched himself over his reel with the air of a wearied navigator. Fog\r\nhad no special terrors for him now. They fished a while in silence, and\r\nfound the cod struck on well. Then Dan drew the sheath-knife and tested\r\nthe edge of it on the gunwale.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a daisy," said Harvey. "How did you get it so cheap?"\r\n\r\n"On account o\' their blame Cath\'lic superstitions," said Dan, jabbing\r\nwith the bright blade. "They don\'t fancy takin\' iron from off a dead\r\nman, so to speak. \'See them Arichat Frenchmen step back when I bid?"\r\n\r\n"But an auction ain\'t taking anythink off a dead man. It\'s business."\r\n\r\n"We know it ain\'t, but there\'s no goin\' in the teeth o\' superstition.\r\nThat\'s one o\' the advantages o\' livin\' in a progressive country." And\r\nDan began whistling:\r\n\r\n    "Oh, Double Thatcher, how are you?\r\n    Now Eastern Point comes inter view.\r\n    The girls an\' boys we soon shall see,\r\n    At anchor off Cape Ann!"\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t that Eastport man bid, then? He bought his boots. Ain\'t\r\nMaine progressive?"\r\n\r\n"Maine? Pshaw! They don\'t know enough, or they hain\'t got money enough,\r\nto paint their haouses in Maine. I\'ve seen \'em. The Eastport man he\r\ntold me that the knife had been used--so the French captain told\r\nhim--used up on the French coast last year."\r\n\r\n"Cut a man? Heave \'s the muckle." Harvey hauled in his fish, rebaited,\r\nand threw over.\r\n\r\n"Killed him! Course, when I heard that I was keener\'n ever to get it."\r\n\r\n"Christmas! I didn\'t know it," said Harvey, turning round. "I\'ll give\r\nyou a dollar for it when I--get my wages. Say, I\'ll give you two\r\ndollars."\r\n\r\n"Honest? D\'you like it as much as all that?" said Dan, flushing. "Well,\r\nto tell the truth, I kinder got it for you--to give; but I didn\'t let\r\non till I saw how you\'d take it. It\'s yours and welcome, Harve, because\r\nwe\'re dory-mates, and so on and so forth, an\' so followin\'. Catch\r\na-holt!"\r\n\r\nHe held it out, belt and all.\r\n\r\n"But look at here. Dan, I don\'t see--"\r\n\r\n"Take it. \'Tain\'t no use to me. I wish you to hev it." The temptation\r\nwas irresistible. "Dan, you\'re a white man," said Harvey. "I\'ll keep it\r\nas long as I live."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good hearin\'," said Dan, with a pleasant laugh; and then,\r\nanxious to change the subject: "\'Look\'s if your line was fast to\r\nsomethin\'."\r\n\r\n"Fouled, I guess," said Harve, tugging. Before he pulled up he fastened\r\nthe belt round him, and with deep delight heard the tip of the sheath\r\nclick on the thwart. "Concern the thing!" he cried. "She acts as though\r\nshe were on strawberry-bottom. It\'s all sand here, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\nDan reached over and gave a judgmatic tweak. "Hollbut\'ll act that way\r\n\'f he\'s sulky. Thet\'s no strawberry-bottom. Yank her once or twice. She\r\ngives, sure. Guess we\'d better haul up an\' make certain."\r\n\r\nThey pulled together, making fast at each turn on the cleats, and the\r\nhidden weight rose sluggishly.\r\n\r\n"Prize, oh! Haul!" shouted Dan, but the shout ended in a shrill, double\r\nshriek of horror, for out of the sea came the body of the dead\r\nFrenchman buried two days before! The hook had caught him under the\r\nright armpit, and he swayed, erect and horrible, head and shoulders\r\nabove water. His arms were tied to his side, and--he had no face. The\r\nboys fell over each other in a heap at the bottom of the dory, and\r\nthere they lay while the thing bobbed alongside, held on the shortened\r\nline.\r\n\r\n"The tide--the tide brought him!" said Harvey with quivering lips, as\r\nhe fumbled at the clasp of the belt.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lord! Oh, Harve!" groaned Dan, "be quick. He\'s come for it. Let\r\nhim have it. Take it off."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want it! I don\'t want it!" cried Harvey. "I can\'t find the\r\nbu-buckle."\r\n\r\n"Quick, Harve! He\'s on your line!"\r\n\r\nHarvey sat up to unfasten the belt, facing the head that had no face\r\nunder its streaming hair. "He\'s fast still," he whispered to Dan, who\r\nslipped out his knife and cut the line, as Harvey flung the belt far\r\noverside. The body shot down with a plop, and Dan cautiously rose to\r\nhis knees, whiter than the fog.\r\n\r\n"He come for it. He come for it. I\'ve seen a stale one hauled up on a\r\ntrawl and I didn\'t much care, but he come to us special."\r\n\r\n"I wish--I wish I hadn\'t taken the knife. Then he\'d have come on your\r\nline."\r\n\r\n"Dunno as thet would ha\' made any differ. We\'re both scared out o\' ten\r\nyears\' growth. Oh, Harve, did ye see his head?"\r\n\r\n"Did I? I\'ll never forget it. But look at here, Dan; it couldn\'t have\r\nbeen meant. It was only the tide."\r\n\r\n"Tide! He come for it, Harve. Why, they sunk him six miles to south\'ard\r\no\' the Fleet, an\' we\'re two miles from where she\'s lyin\' now. They told\r\nme he was weighted with a fathom an\' a half o\' chain-cable."\r\n\r\n"Wonder what he did with the knife--up on the French coast?"\r\n\r\n"Something bad. \'Guess he\'s bound to take it with him to the Judgment,\r\nan\' so-- What are you doin\' with the fish?"\r\n\r\n"Heaving \'em overboard," said Harvey.\r\n\r\n"What for? We sha\'n\'t eat \'em."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care. I had to look at his face while I was takin\' the belt\r\noff. You can keep your catch if you like. I\'ve no use for mine."\r\n\r\nDan said nothing, but threw his fish over again.\r\n\r\n"Guess it\'s best to be on the safe side," he murmured at last. "I\'d\r\ngive a month\'s pay if this fog \'u\'d lift. Things go abaout in a fog\r\nthat ye don\'t see in clear weather--yo-hoes an\' hollerers and such\r\nlike. I\'m sorter relieved he come the way he did instid o\' walkin\'. He\r\nmight ha\' walked."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Dan! We\'re right on top of him now. \'Wish I was safe aboard,\r\nhem\' pounded by Uncle Salters."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be lookin\' fer us in a little. Gimme the tooter." Dan took the\r\ntin dinner-horn, but paused before he blew.\r\n\r\n"Go on," said Harvey. "I don\'t want to stay here all night"\r\n\r\n"Question is, haow he\'d take it. There was a man frum down the coast\r\ntold me once he was in a schooner where they darsen\'t ever blow a horn\r\nto the dories, becaze the skipper--not the man he was with, but a\r\ncaptain that had run her five years before--he\'d drowned a boy\r\nalongside in a drunk fit; an\' ever after, that boy he\'d row along-side\r\ntoo and shout, \'Dory! dory!\' with the rest."\r\n\r\n"Dory! dory!" a muffled voice cried through the fog. They cowered\r\nagain, and the horn dropped from Dan\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Hold on!" cried Harvey; "it\'s the cook."\r\n\r\n"Dunno what made me think o\' thet fool tale, either," said Dan. "It\'s\r\nthe doctor, sure enough."\r\n\r\n"Dan! Danny! Oooh, Dan! Harve! Harvey! Oooh, Haarveee!"\r\n\r\n"We\'re here," sung both boys together. They heard oars, but could see\r\nnothing till the cook, shining and dripping, rowed into them.\r\n\r\n"What iss happened?" said he. "You will be beaten at home."\r\n\r\n"Thet\'s what we want. Thet\'s what we\'re sufferin\' for" said Dan.\r\n"Anything homey\'s good enough fer us. We\'ve had kinder depressin\'\r\ncompany." As the cook passed them a line, Dan told him the tale.\r\n\r\n"Yess! He come for hiss knife," was all he said at the end.\r\n\r\nNever had the little rocking _We\'re Here_ looked so deliciously\r\nhome-like as when the cook, born and bred in fogs, rowed them back to\r\nher. There was a warm glow of light from the cabin and a satisfying\r\nsmell of food forward, and it was heavenly to hear Disko and the\r\nothers, all quite alive and solid, leaning over the rail and promising\r\nthem a first-class pounding. But the cook was a black; master of\r\nstrategy. He did not get the dories aboard till he had given the more\r\nstriking points of the tale, explaining as he backed and bumped round\r\nthe counter how Harvey was the mascot to destroy any possible bad luck.\r\nSo the boys came override as rather uncanny heroes, and every one asked\r\nthem questions instead of pounding them for making trouble. Little Penn\r\ndelivered quite a speech on the folly of superstitions; but public\r\nopinion was against him and in favour of Long Jack, who told the most\r\nexcruciating ghost-stories, till nearly midnight. Under that influence\r\nno one except Salters and Penn said anything about "idolatry," when the\r\ncook put a lighted candle, a cake of flour and water, and a pinch of\r\nsalt on a shingle, and floated them out astern to keep the Frenchman\r\nquiet in case he was still restless. Dan lit the candle because he had\r\nbought the belt, and the cook grunted and muttered charms as long as he\r\ncould see the ducking point of flame.\r\n\r\nSaid Harvey to Dan, as they turned in after watch:\r\n\r\n"How about progress and Catholic superstitions?"\r\n\r\n"Huh! I guess I\'m as enlightened and progressive as the next man, but\r\nwhen it comes to a dead St. Malo deck-hand scarin\' a couple o\' pore\r\nboys stiff fer the sake of a thirty-cent knife, why, then, the cook can\r\ntake hold fer all o\' me. I mistrust furriners, livin\' or dead."\r\n\r\nNext morning all, except the cook, were rather ashamed of the\r\nceremonies, and went to work double tides, speaking gruffly to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe _We\'re Here_ was racing neck and neck for her last few loads\r\nagainst the Parry Norman; and so close was the struggle that the Fleet\r\ntook side and betted tobacco. All hands worked at the lines or\r\ndressing-down till they fell asleep where they stood--beginning before\r\ndawn and ending when it was too dark to see. They even used the cook as\r\npitcher, and turned Harvey into the hold to pass salt, while Dan helped\r\nto dress down.  Luckily a Parry Norman man sprained his ankle falling\r\ndown the foc\'sle, and the _We\'re Heres_ gained. Harvey could not see\r\nhow one more fish could be crammed into her, but Disko and Tom Platt\r\nstowed and stowed, and planked the mass down with big stones from the\r\nballast, and there was always "jest another day\'s work." Disko did not\r\ntell them when all the salt was wetted. He rolled to the lazarette aft\r\nthe cabin and began hauling out the big mainsail. This was at ten in\r\nthe morning. The riding-sail was down and the main- and topsail were up\r\nby noon, and dories came alongside with letters for home, envying their\r\ngood fortune. At last she cleared decks, hoisted her flag,--as is the\r\nright of the first boat off the Banks,--up-anchored, and began to move.\r\nDisko pretended that he wished to accomodate folk who had not sent in\r\ntheir mail, and so worked her gracefully in and out among the\r\nschooners. In reality, that was his little triumphant procession, and\r\nfor the fifth year running it showed what kind of mariner he was. Dan\'s\r\naccordion and Tom Platt\'s fiddle supplied the music of the magic verse\r\nyou must not sing till all the salt is wet:\r\n\r\n    "Hih! Yih! Yoho! Send your letters raound!\r\n    All our salt is wetted, an\' the anchor\'s off the graound!\r\n    Bend, oh, bend your mains\'l, we\'re back to Yankeeland--\r\n        With fifteen hunder\' quintal,\r\n        An\' fifteen hunder\' quintal,\r\n        \'Teen hunder\' toppin\' quintal,\r\n    \'Twix\' old \'Queereau an\' Grand."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last letters pitched on deck wrapped round pieces of coal, and the\r\nGloucester men shouted messages to their wives and womenfolks and\r\nowners, while the _We\'re Here_ finished the musical ride through the\r\nFleet, her headsails quivering like a man\'s hand when he raises it to\r\nsay good-by.\r\n\r\nHarvey very soon discovered that the _We\'re Here_, with her\r\nriding-sail, strolling from berth to berth, and the _We\'re Here_ headed\r\nwest by south under home canvas, were two very different boats. There\r\nwas a bite and kick to the wheel even in "boy\'s" weather; he could feel\r\nthe dead weight in the hold flung forward mightily across the surges,\r\nand the streaming line of bubbles overside made his eyes dizzy.\r\n\r\nDisko kept them busy fiddling with the sails; and when those were\r\nflattened like a racing yacht\'s, Dan had to wait on the big topsail,\r\nwhich was put over by hand every time she went about. In spare moments\r\nthey pumped, for the packed fish dripped brine, which does not improve\r\na cargo. But since there was no fishing, Harvey had time to look at the\r\nsea from another point of view. The low-sided schooner was naturally on\r\nmost intimate terms with her surroundings. They saw little of the\r\nhorizon save when she topped a swell; and usually she was elbowing,\r\nfidgeting, and coasting her steadfast way through gray, gray-blue, or\r\nblack hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering foam;\r\nor rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger\r\nwater-hill. It was as if she said: "You wouldn\'t hurt me, surely? I\'m\r\nonly the little _We\'re Here_." Then she would slide away chuckling\r\nsoftly to herself till she was brought up by some fresh obstacle. The\r\ndullest of folk cannot see this kind of thing hour after hour through\r\nlong days without noticing it; and Harvey, being anything but dull,\r\nbegan to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wave-tops turning over\r\nwith a sound of incessant tearing; the hurry of the winds working\r\nacross open spaces and herding the purple-blue cloud-shadows; the\r\nsplendid upheaval of the red sunrise; the folding and packing away of\r\nthe morning mists, wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors;\r\nthe salty glare and blaze of noon; the kiss of rain falling over\r\nthousands of dead, flat square miles; the chilly blackening of\r\neverything at the day\'s end; and the million wrinkles of the sea under\r\nthe moonlight, when the jib-boom solemnly poked at the low stars, and\r\nHarvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook.\r\n\r\nBut the best fun was when the boys were put on the wheel together, Tom\r\nPlatt within hail, and she cuddled her lee-rail down to the crashing\r\nblue, and kept a little home-made rainbow arching unbroken over her\r\nwindlass. Then the jaws of the booms whined against the masts, and the\r\nsheets creaked, and the sails filled with roaring; and when she slid\r\ninto a hollow she trampled like a woman tripped in her own silk dress,\r\nand came out, her jib wet half-way up, yearning and peering for the\r\ntall twin-lights of Thatcher\'s Island.\r\n\r\nThey left the cold gray of the Bank sea, saw the lumber-ships making\r\nfor Quebec by the Straits of St. Lawrence, with the Jersey salt-brigs\r\nfrom Spain and Sicily; found a friendly northeaster off Artimon Bank\r\nthat drove them within view of the East light of Sable Island,--a sight\r\nDisko did not linger over,--and stayed with them past Western and Le\r\nHave, to the northern fringe of George\'s. From there they picked up the\r\ndeeper water, and let her go merrily.\r\n\r\n"Hattie\'s pulling on the string," Dan confided to Harvey. "Hattie an\'\r\nMa. Next Sunday you\'ll be hirin\' a boy to throw water on the windows to\r\nmake ye go to sleep. \'Guess you\'ll keep with us till your folks come.\r\nDo you know the best of gettin\' ashore again?"\r\n\r\n"Hot bath?" said Harvey. His eyebrows were all white with dried spray.\r\n\r\n"That\'s good, but a night-shirt\'s better. I\'ve been dreamin\' o\'\r\nnight-shirts ever since we bent our mainsail. Ye can wiggle your toes\r\nthen. Ma\'ll hev a new one fer me, all washed soft. It\'s home, Harve.\r\nIt\'s home! Ye can sense it in the air. We\'re runnin\' into the aidge of\r\na hot wave naow, an\' I can smell the bayberries. Wonder if we\'ll get in\r\nfer supper. Port a trifle."\r\n\r\nThe hesitating sails flapped and lurched in the close air as the deep\r\nsmoothed out, blue and oily, round them. When they whistled for a wind\r\nonly the rain came in spiky rods, bubbling and drumming, and behind the\r\nrain the thunder and the lightning of mid-August. They lay on the deck\r\nwith bare feet and arms, telling one another what they would order at\r\ntheir first meal ashore; for now the land was in plain sight. A\r\nGloucester swordfish-boat drifted alongside, a man in the little pulpit\r\non the bowsprit flourished his harpoon, his bare head plastered down\r\nwith the wet. "And all\'s well!" he sang cheerily, as though he were\r\nwatch on a big liner. "Wouverman\'s waiting fer you, Disko. What\'s the\r\nnews o\' the Fleet?"\r\n\r\nDisko shouted it and passed on, while the wild summer storm pounded\r\noverhead and the lightning flickered along the capes from four\r\ndifferent quarters at once. It gave the low circle of hills round\r\nGloucester Harbor, Ten Pound Island, the fish-sheds, with the broken\r\nline of house-roofs, and each spar and buoy on the water, in blinding\r\nphotographs that came and went a dozen times to the minute as the\r\n_We\'re Here_ crawled in on half-flood, and the whistling-buoy moaned\r\nand mourned behind her. Then the storm died out in long, separated,\r\nvicious dags of blue-white flame, followed by a single roar like the\r\nroar of a mortar-battery, and the shaken air tingled under the stars as\r\nit got back to silence.\r\n\r\n"The flag, the flag!" said Disko, suddenly, pointing upward.\r\n\r\n"What is ut?" said Long Jack.\r\n\r\n"Otto! Ha\'af mast. They can see us frum shore now."\r\n\r\n"I\'d clean forgot. He\'s no folk to Gloucester, has he?"\r\n\r\n"Girl he was goin\' to be married to this fall."\r\n\r\n"Mary pity her!" said Long Jack, and lowered the little flag half-mast\r\nfor the sake of Otto, swept overboard in a gale off Le Have three\r\nmonths before.\r\n\r\nDisko wiped the wet from his eyes and led the _We\'re Here_ to\r\nWouverman\'s wharf, giving his orders in whispers, while she swung round\r\nmoored tugs and night-watchmen hailed her from the ends of inky-black\r\npiers. Over and above the darkness and the mystery of the procession,\r\nHarvey could feel the land close round him once more, with all its\r\nthousands of people asleep, and the smell of earth after rain, and the\r\nfamiliar noise of a switching-engine coughing to herself in a\r\nfreight-yard; and all those things made his heart beat and his throat\r\ndry up as he stood by the foresheet. They heard the anchor-watch\r\nsnoring on a lighthouse-tug, nosed into a pocket of darkness where a\r\nlantern glimmered on either side; somebody waked with a grunt, threw\r\nthem a rope, and they made fast to a silent wharf flanked with great\r\niron-roofed sheds fall of warm emptiness, and lay there without a sound.\r\n\r\nThen Harvey sat down by the wheel, and sobbed and sobbed as though his\r\nheart would break, and a tall woman who had been sitting on a\r\nweigh-scale dropped down into the schooner and kissed Dan once on the\r\ncheek; for she was his mother, and she had seen the _We\'re Here_ by the\r\nlightning flashes. She took no notice of Harvey till he had recovered\r\nhimself a little and Disko had told her his story. Then they went to\r\nDisko\'s house together as the dawn was breaking; and until the\r\ntelegraph office was open and he could wire his folk, Harvey Cheyne was\r\nperhaps the loneliest boy in all America. But the curious thing was\r\nthat Disko and Dan seemed to think none the worse of him for crying.\r\n\r\nWouverman was not ready for Disko\'s prices till Disko, sure that the\r\n_We\'re Here_ was at least a week ahead of any other Gloucester boat,\r\nhad given him a few days to swallow them; so all hands played about the\r\nstreets, and Long Jack stopped the Rocky Neck trolley, on principle, as\r\nhe said, till the conductor let him ride free. But Dan went about with\r\nhis freckled nose in the air, bung-full of mystery and most haughty to\r\nhis family.\r\n\r\n"Dan, I\'ll hev to lay inter you ef you act this way," said Troop,\r\npensively. "Sence we\'ve come ashore this time you\'ve bin a heap too\r\nfresh."\r\n\r\n"I\'d lay into him naow ef he was mine," said Uncle Salters, sourly. He\r\nand Penn boarded with the Troops.\r\n\r\n"Oho!" said Dan, shuffling with the accordion round the backyard, ready\r\nto leap the fence if the enemy advanced. "Dad, you\'re welcome to your\r\nown judgment, but remember I\'ve warned ye. Your own flesh an\' blood ha\'\r\nwarned ye! \'Tain\'t any o\' my fault ef you\'re mistook, but I\'ll be on\r\ndeck to watch ye. An\' ez fer yeou, Uncle Salters, Pharaoh\'s chief\r\nbutler ain\'t in it \'longside o\' you! You watch aout an\' wait. You\'ll be\r\nplowed under like your own blamed clover; but me--Dan Troop--I\'ll\r\nflourish like a green bay-tree because I warn\'t stuck on my own\r\nopinion."\r\n\r\nDisko was smoking in all his shore dignity and a pair of beautiful\r\ncarpet-slippers. "You\'re gettin\' ez crazy as poor Harve. You two go\r\naraound gigglin\' an\' squinchin\' an\' kickin\' each other under the table\r\ntill there\'s no peace in the haouse," said he.\r\n\r\n"There\'s goin\' to be a heap less--fer some folks," Dan replied. "You\r\nwait an\' see."\r\n\r\nHe and Harvey went out on the trolley to East Gloucester, where they\r\ntramped through the bayberry bushes to the lighthouse, and lay down on\r\nthe big red boulders and laughed themselves hungry. Harvey had shown\r\nDan a telegram, and the two swore to keep silence till the shell burst.\r\n\r\n"Harve\'s folk?" said Dan, with an unruffled face after supper. "Well, I\r\nguess they don\'t amount to much of anything, or we\'d ha\' heard from \'em\r\nby naow. His pop keeps a kind o\' store out West. Maybe he\'ll give you\r\n\'s much as five dollars, Dad."\r\n\r\n"What did I tell ye?" said Salters. "Don\'t sputter over your vittles,\r\nDan."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWhatever his private sorrows may be, a multimillionaire, like any other\r\nworkingman, should keep abreast of his business. Harvey Cheyne, senior,\r\nhad gone East late in June to meet a woman broken down, half mad, who\r\ndreamed day and night of her son drowning in the gray seas. He had\r\nsurrounded her with doctors, trained nurses, massage-women, and even\r\nfaith-cure companions, but they were useless. Mrs. Cheyne lay still and\r\nmoaned, or talked of her boy by the hour together to any one who would\r\nlisten. Hope she had none, and who could offer it? All she needed was\r\nassurance that drowning did not hurt; and her husband watched to guard\r\nlest she should make the experiment. Of his own sorrow he spoke\r\nlittle--hardly realized the depth of it till he caught himself asking\r\nthe calendar on his writing-desk, "What\'s the use of going on?"\r\n\r\nThere had always lain a pleasant notion at the back of his head that,\r\nsome day, when he had rounded off everything and the boy had left\r\ncollege, he would take his son to his heart and lead him into his\r\npossessions. Then that boy, he argued, as busy fathers do, would\r\ninstantly become his companion, partner, and ally, and there would\r\nfollow splendid years of great works carried out together--the old head\r\nbacking the young fire. Now his boy was dead--lost at sea, as it might\r\nhave been a Swede sailor from one of Cheyne\'s big teaships; the wife\r\ndying, or worse; he himself was trodden down by platoons of women and\r\ndoctors and maids and attendants; worried almost beyond endurance by\r\nthe shift and change of her poor restless whims; hopeless, with no\r\nheart to meet his many enemies.\r\n\r\nHe had taken the wife to his raw new palace in San Diego, where she and\r\nher people occupied a wing of great price, and Cheyne, in a\r\nveranda-room, between a secretary and a typewriter, who was also a\r\ntelegraphist, toiled along wearily from day to day. There was a war of\r\nrates among four Western railroads in which he was supposed to be\r\ninterested; a devastating strike had developed in his lumber camps in\r\nOregon, and the legislature of the State of California, which has no\r\nlove for its makers, was preparing open war against him.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily he would have accepted battle ere it was offered, and have\r\nwaged a pleasant and unscrupulous campaign. But now he sat limply, his\r\nsoft black hat pushed forward on to his nose, his big body shrunk\r\ninside his loose clothes, staring at his boots or the Chinese junks in\r\nthe bay, and assenting absently to the secretary\'s questions as he\r\nopened the Saturday mail.\r\n\r\nCheyne was wondering how much it would cost to drop everything and pull\r\nout. He carried huge insurances, could buy himself royal annuities, and\r\nbetween one of his places in Colorado and a little society (that would\r\ndo the wife good), say in Washington and the South Carolina islands, a\r\nman might forget plans that had come to nothing. On the other hand--\r\n\r\nThe click of the typewriter stopped; the girl was looking at the\r\nsecretary, who had turned white.\r\n\r\nHe passed Cheyne a telegram repeated from San Francisco:\r\n\r\nPicked up by fishing schooner _We\'re Here_ having fallen off boat great\r\ntimes on Banks fishing all well waiting Gloucester Mass care Disko\r\nTroop for money or orders wire what shall do and how is Mama Harvey N.\r\nCheyne.\r\n\r\nThe father let it fall, laid his head down on the roller-top of the\r\nshut desk, and breathed heavily. The secretary ran for Mrs. Cheyne\'s\r\ndoctor who found Cheyne pacing to and fro.\r\n\r\n"What--what d\' you think of it? Is it possible? Is there any meaning to\r\nit? I can\'t quite make it out," he cried.\r\n\r\n"I can," said the doctor. "I lose seven thousand a year--that\'s all."\r\nHe thought of the struggling New York practice he had dropped at\r\nCheyne\'s imperious bidding, and returned the telegram with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"You mean you\'d tell her? \'May be a fraud?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the motive?" said the doctor, coolly. "Detection\'s too certain.\r\nIt\'s the boy sure enough."\r\n\r\nEnter a French maid, impudently, as an indispensable one who is kept on\r\nonly by large wages.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Cheyne she say you must come at once. She think you are seek."\r\n\r\nThe master of thirty millions bowed his head meekly and followed\r\nSuzanne; and a thin, high voice on the upper landing of the great\r\nwhite-wood square staircase cried: "What is it? What has happened?"\r\n\r\nNo doors could keep out the shriek that rang through the echoing house\r\na moment later, when her husband blurted out the news.\r\n\r\n"And that\'s all right," said the doctor, serenely, to the typewriter.\r\n"About the only medical statement in novels with any truth to it is\r\nthat joy don\'t kill, Miss Kinzey."\r\n\r\n"I know it; but we\'ve a heap to do first." Miss Kinzey was from\r\nMilwaukee, somewhat direct of speech; and as her fancy leaned towards\r\nthe secretary, she divined there was work in hand. He was looking\r\nearnestly at the vast roller-map of America on the wall.\r\n\r\n"Milsom, we\'re going right across. Private car--straight\r\nthrough--Boston. Fix the connections," shouted Cheyne down the\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\n"I thought so."\r\n\r\nThe secretary turned to the typewriter, and their eyes met (out of that\r\nwas born a story--nothing to do with this story). She looked\r\ninquiringly, doubtful of his resources. He signed to her to move to the\r\nMorse as a general brings brigades into action. Then he swept his hand\r\nmusician-wise through his hair, regarded the ceiling, and set to work,\r\nwhile Miss Kinzey\'s white fingers called up the Continent of America.\r\n\r\n"_K. H. Wade, Los Angeles--_ The \'Constance\' is at Los Angeles, isn\'t she,\r\nMiss Kinzey?"\r\n\r\n"Yep." Miss Kinzey nodded between clicks as the secretary looked at his\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n"Ready? _Send \'Constance,\' private car, here, and arrange for special to\r\nleave here Sunday in time to connect with New York Limited at Sixteenth\r\nStreet, Chicago, Tuesday next_."\r\n\r\nClick-click-click! "Couldn\'t you better that?"\r\n\r\n"Not on those grades. That gives \'em sixty hours from here to Chicago.\r\nThey won\'t gain anything by taking a special east of that. Ready? _Also\r\narrange with Lake Shore and Michigan Southern to take \'Constance\' on\r\nNew York Central and Hudson River Buffalo to Albany, and B. and A. the\r\nsame Albany to Boston. Indispensable I should reach Boston Wednesday\r\nevening. Be sure nothing prevents. Have also wired Canniff, Toucey, and\r\nBarnes._--Sign, Cheyne."\r\n\r\nMiss Kinzey nodded, and the secretary went on.\r\n\r\n"Now then. Canniff, Toucey, and Barnes, of course. Ready? _Canniff,\r\nChicago. Please take my private car \'Constance\' from Santa Fe at\r\nSixteenth Street next Tuesday p. m. on N. Y. Limited through to Buffalo\r\nand deliver N. Y. C. for Albany._--Ever bin to N\' York, Miss Kinzey?\r\nWe\'ll go some day.--Ready? _Take car Buffalo to Albany on Limited\r\nTuesday p. m._ That\'s for Toucey."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t bin to Noo York, but I know that!" with a toss of the head.\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon. Now, Boston and Albany, Barnes, same instructions from\r\nAlbany through to Boston. Leave three-five P. M. (you needn\'t wire\r\nthat); arrive nine-five P. M. Wednesday. That covers everything Wade\r\nwill do, but it pays to shake up the managers."\r\n\r\n"It\'s great," said Miss Kinzey, with a look of admiration. This was the\r\nkind of man she understood and appreciated.\r\n\r\n"\'Tisn\'t bad," said Milsom, modestly. "Now, any one but me would have\r\nlost thirty hours and spent a week working out the run, instead of\r\nhanding him over to the Santa Fe straight through to Chicago."\r\n\r\n"But see here, about that Noo York Limited. Chauncey Depew himself\r\ncouldn\'t hitch his car to her," Miss Kinzey suggested, recovering\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but this isn\'t Chauncey. It\'s Cheyne--lightning. It goes."\r\n\r\n"Even so. Guess we\'d better wire the boy. You\'ve forgotten that,\r\nanyhow."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll ask."\r\n\r\nWhen he returned with the father\'s message bidding Harvey meet them in\r\nBoston at an appointed hour, he found Miss Kinzey laughing over the\r\nkeys. Then Milsom laughed too, for the frantic clicks from Los Angeles\r\nran: "We want to know why-why-why? General uneasiness developed and\r\nspreading."\r\n\r\nTen minutes later Chicago appealed to Miss Kinzey in these words: "If\r\ncrime of century is maturing please warn friends in time. We are all\r\ngetting to cover here."\r\n\r\nThis was capped by a message from Topeka (and wherein Topeka was\r\nconcerned even Milsom could not guess): "Don\'t shoot, Colonel. We\'ll\r\ncome down."\r\n\r\nCheyne smiled grimly at the consternation of his enemies when the\r\ntelegrams were laid before him. "They think we\'re on the warpath. Tell\r\n\'em we don\'t feel like fighting just now, Milsom. Tell \'em what we\'re\r\ngoing for. I guess you and Miss Kinsey had better come along, though it\r\nisn\'t likely I shall do any business on the road. Tell \'em the\r\ntruth--for once."\r\n\r\nSo the truth was told. Miss Kinzey clicked in the sentiment while the\r\nsecretary added the memorable quotation, "Let us have peace," and in\r\nboard rooms two thousand miles away the representatives of sixty-three\r\nmillion dollars\' worth of variously manipulated railroad interests\r\nbreathed more freely. Cheyne was flying to meet the only son, so\r\nmiraculously restored to him. The bear was seeking his cub, not the\r\nbulls. Hard men who had their knives drawn to fight for their financial\r\nlives put away the weapons and wished him God-speed, while half a dozen\r\npanic-smitten tin-pot toads perked up their heads and spoke of the\r\nwonderful things they would have done had not Cheyne buried the hatchet.\r\n\r\nIt was a busy week-end among the wires; for now that their anxiety was\r\nremoved, men and cities hastened to accommodate. Los Angeles called to\r\nSan Diego and Barstow that the Southern California engineers might know\r\nand be ready in their lonely roundhouses; Barstow passed the word to\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific; and Albuquerque flung it the whole length of\r\nthe Atchinson, Topeka, and Santa Fe management, even into Chicago. An\r\nengine, combination-car with crew, and the great and gilded "Constance"\r\nprivate car were to be "expedited" over those two thousand three\r\nhundred and fifty miles. The train would take precedence of one hundred\r\nand seventy-seven others meeting and passing; despatchers and crews of\r\nevery one of those said trains must be notified. Sixteen locomotives,\r\nsixteen engineers, and sixteen firemen would be needed--each and every\r\none the best available. Two and one half minutes would be allowed for\r\nchanging engines, three for watering, and two for coaling. "Warn the\r\nmen, and arrange tanks and chutes accordingly; for Harvey Cheyne is in\r\na hurry, a hurry, a hurry," sang the wires. "Forty miles an hour will\r\nbe expected, and division superintendents will accompany this special\r\nover their respective divisions. From San Diego to Sixteenth Street,\r\nChicago, let the magic carpet be laid down. Hurry! Oh, hurry!"\r\n\r\n"It will be hot," said Cheyne, as they rolled out of San Diego in the\r\ndawn of Sunday. "We\'re going to hurry, Mama, just as fast as ever we\r\ncan; but I really don\'t think there\'s any good of your putting on your\r\nbonnet and gloves yet. You\'d much better lie down and take your\r\nmedicine. I\'d play you a game of dominoes, but it\'s Sunday."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be good. Oh, I will be good. Only--taking off my bonnet makes me\r\nfeel as if we\'d never get there."\r\n\r\n"Try to sleep a little, Mama, and we\'ll be in Chicago before you know."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s Boston, Father. Tell them to hurry."\r\n\r\nThe six-foot drivers were hammering their way to San Bernardino and the\r\nMohave wastes, but this was no grade for speed. That would come later.\r\nThe heat of the desert followed the heat of the hills as they turned\r\neast to the Needles and the Colorado River. The car cracked in the\r\nutter drouth and glare, and they put crushed ice to Mrs. Cheyne\'s neck,\r\nand toiled up the long, long grades, past Ash Fork, towards Flagstaff,\r\nwhere the forests and quarries are, under the dry, remote skies. The\r\nneedle of the speed-indicator flicked and wagged to and fro; the\r\ncinders rattled on the roof, and a whirl of dust sucked after the\r\nwhirling wheels. The crew of the combination sat on their bunks,\r\npanting in their shirtsleeves, and Cheyne found himself among them\r\nshouting old, old stories of the railroad that every trainman knows,\r\nabove the roar of the car. He told them about his son, and how the sea\r\nhad given up its dead, and they nodded and spat and rejoiced with him;\r\nasked after "her, back there," and whether she could stand it if the\r\nengineer "let her out a piece," and Cheyne thought she could.\r\nAccordingly, the great fire-horse was "let \'ut" from Flagstaff to\r\nWinslow, till a division superintendent protested.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Cheyne, in the boudoir stateroom, where the French maid,\r\nsallow-white with fear, clung to the silver door-handle, only moaned a\r\nlittle and begged her husband to bid them "hurry." And so they dropped\r\nthe dry sands and moon-struck rocks of Arizona behind them, and grilled\r\non till the crash of the couplings and the wheeze of the brake-hose\r\ntold them they were at Coolidge by the Continental Divide.\r\n\r\nThree bold and experienced men--cool, confident, and dry when they\r\nbegan; white, quivering, and wet when they finished their trick at\r\nthose terrible wheels--swung her over the great lift from Albuquerque\r\nto Glorietta and beyond Springer, up and up to the Raton Tunnel on the\r\nState line, whence they dropped rocking into La Junta, had sight of the\r\nArkansaw, and tore down the long slope to Dodge City, where Cheyne took\r\ncomfort once again from setting his watch an hour ahead.\r\n\r\nThere was very little talk in the car. The secretary and typewriter sat\r\ntogether on the stamped Spanish-leather cushions by the plate-glass\r\nobservation-window at the rear end, watching the surge and ripple of\r\nthe ties crowded back behind them, and, it is believed, making notes of\r\nthe scenery. Cheyne moved nervously between his own extravagant\r\ngorgeousness and the naked necessity of the combination, an unlit cigar\r\nin his teeth, till the pitying crews forgot that he was their tribal\r\nenemy, and did their best to entertain him.\r\n\r\nAt night the bunched electrics lit up that distressful palace of all\r\nthe luxuries, and they fared sumptuously, swinging on through the\r\nemptiness of abject desolation.\r\n\r\nNow they heard the swish of a water-tank, and the guttural voice of a\r\nChinaman, the click-clink of hammers that tested the Krupp steel\r\nwheels, and the oath of a tramp chased off the rear-platform; now the\r\nsolid crash of coal shot into the tender; and now a beating back of\r\nnoises as they flew past a waiting train. Now they looked out into\r\ngreat abysses, a trestle purring beneath their tread, or up to rocks\r\nthat barred out half the stars. Now scour and ravine changed and rolled\r\nback to jagged mountains on the horizon\'s edge, and now broke into\r\nhills lower and lower, till at last came the true plains.\r\n\r\nAt Dodge City an unknown hand threw in a copy of a Kansas paper\r\ncontaining some sort of an interview with Harvey, who had evidently\r\nfallen in with an enterprising reporter, telegraphed on from Boston.\r\nThe joyful journalese revealed that it was beyond question their boy,\r\nand it soothed Mrs. Cheyne for a while. Her one word "hurry" was\r\nconveyed by the crews to the engineers at Nickerson, Topeka, and\r\nMarceline, where the grades are easy, and they brushed the Continent\r\nbehind them. Towns and villages were close together now, and a man\r\ncould feel here that he moved among people.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see the dial, and my eyes ache so. What are we doing?"\r\n\r\n"The very best we can, Mama. There\'s no sense in getting in before the\r\nLimited. We\'d only have to wait."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care. I want to feel we\'re moving. Sit down and tell me the\r\nmiles."\r\n\r\nCheyne sat down and read the dial for her (there were some miles which\r\nstand for records to this day), but the seventy-foot car never changed\r\nits long steamer-like roll, moving through the heat with the hum of a\r\ngiant bee. Yet the speed was not enough for Mrs. Cheyne; and the heat,\r\nthe remorseless August heat, was making her giddy; the clock-hands\r\nwould not move, and when, oh, when would they be in Chicago?\r\n\r\nIt is not true that, as they changed engines at Fort Madison, Cheyne\r\npassed over to the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers an\r\nendowment sufficient to enable them to fight him and his fellows on\r\nequal terms for evermore. He paid his obligations to engineers and\r\nfiremen as he believed they deserved, and only his bank knows what he\r\ngave the crews who had sympathized with him. It is on record that the\r\nlast crew took entire charge of switching operations at Sixteenth\r\nStreet, because "she" was in a doze at last, and Heaven was to help any\r\none who bumped her.\r\n\r\nNow the highly paid specialist who conveys the Lake Shore and Michigan\r\nSouthern Limited from Chicago to Elkhart is something of an autocrat,\r\nand he does not approve of being told how to back up to a car. None the\r\nless he handled the "Constance" as if she might have been a load of\r\ndynamite, and when the crew rebuked him, they did it in whispers and\r\ndumb show.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" said the Atchinson, Topeka, and Santa Fe men, discussing life\r\nlater, "we weren\'t runnin\' for a record. Harvey Cheyne\'s wife, she were\r\nsick back, an\' we didn\'t want to jounce her. \'Come to think of it, our\r\nrunnin\' time from San Diego to Chicago was 57.54. You can tell that to\r\nthem Eastern way-trains. When we\'re tryin\' for a record, we\'ll let you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nTo the Western man (though this would not please either city) Chicago\r\nand Boston are cheek by jowl, and some railroads encourage the\r\ndelusion. The Limited whirled the "Constance" into Buffalo and the arms\r\nof the New York Central and Hudson River (illustrious magnates with\r\nwhite whiskers and gold charms on their watch-chains boarded her here\r\nto talk a little business to Cheyne), who slid her gracefully into\r\nAlbany, where the Boston and Albany completed the run from tide-water\r\nto tide-water--total time, eighty-seven hours and thirty-five minutes,\r\nor three days, fifteen hours and one half. Harvey was waiting for them.\r\n\r\nAfter violent emotion most people and all boys demand food. They\r\nfeasted the returned prodigal behind drawn curtains, cut off in their\r\ngreat happiness, while the trains roared in and out around them. Harvey\r\nate, drank, and enlarged on his adventures all in one breath, and when\r\nhe had a hand free his mother fondled it. His voice was thickened with\r\nliving in the open, salt air; his palms were rough and hard, his wrists\r\ndotted with marks of gurrysores; and a fine full flavour of codfish\r\nhung round rubber boots and blue jersey.\r\n\r\nThe father, well used to judging men, looked at him keenly. He did not\r\nknow what enduring harm the boy might have taken. Indeed, he caught\r\nhimself thinking that he knew very little whatever of his son; but he\r\ndistinctly remembered an unsatisfied, dough-faced youth who took\r\ndelight in "calling down the old man," and reducing his mother to\r\ntears--such a person as adds to the gaiety of public rooms and hotel\r\npiazzas, where the ingenuous young of the wealthy play with or revile\r\nthe bell-boys. But this well set-up fisher-youth did not wriggle,\r\nlooked at him with eyes steady, clear, and unflinching, and spoke in a\r\ntone distinctly, even startlingly, respectful. There was that in his\r\nvoice, too, which seemed to promise that the change might be permanent,\r\nand that the new Harvey had come to stay.\r\n\r\n"Some one\'s been coercing him," thought Cheyne. "Now Constance would\r\nnever have allowed that. Don\'t see as Europe could have done it any\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"But why didn\'t you tell this man, Troop, who you were?" the mother\r\nrepeated, when Harvey had expanded his story at least twice.\r\n\r\n"Disko Troop, dear. The best man that ever walked a deck. I don\'t care\r\nwho the next is."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tell him to put you ashore? You know Papa would have\r\nmade it up to him ten times over."\r\n\r\n"I know it; but he thought I was crazy. I\'m afraid I called him a thief\r\nbecause I couldn\'t find the bills in my pocket."\r\n\r\n"A sailor found them by the flagstaff that--that night," sobbed Mrs.\r\nCheyne.\r\n\r\n"That explains it, then. I don\'t blame Troop any. I just said I\r\nwouldn\'t work--on a Banker, too--and of course he hit me on the nose,\r\nand oh! I bled like a stuck hog."\r\n\r\n"My poor darling! They must have abused you horribly."\r\n\r\n"Dunno quite. Well, after that, I saw a light."\r\n\r\nCheyne slapped his leg and chuckled. This was going to be a boy after\r\nhis own hungry heart. He had never seen precisely that twinkle in\r\nHarvey\'s eye before.\r\n\r\n"And the old man gave me ten and a half a month; he\'s paid me half now;\r\nand I took hold with Dan and pitched right in. I can\'t do a man\'s work\r\nyet. But I can handle a dory \'most as well as Dan, and I don\'t get\r\nrattled in a fog--much; and I can take my trick in light winds--that\'s\r\nsteering, dear--and I can \'most bait up a trawl, and I know my ropes,\r\nof course; and I can pitch fish till the cows come home, and I\'m great\r\non old Josephus, and I\'ll show you how I can clear coffee with a piece\r\nof fish-skin, and--I think I\'ll have another cup, please. Say, you\'ve\r\nno notion what a heap of work there is in ten and a half a month!"\r\n\r\n"I began with eight and a half, my son," said Cheyne.\r\n\r\n"That so? You never told me, sir."\r\n\r\n"You never asked, Harve. I\'ll tell you about it some day, if you care\r\nto listen. Try a stuffed olive."\r\n\r\n"Troop says the most interesting thing in the world is to find out how\r\nthe next man gets his vittles. It\'s great to have a trimmed-up meal\r\nagain. We were well fed, though. But mug on the Banks. Disko fed us\r\nfirst-class. He\'s a great man. And Dan--that\'s his son--Dan\'s my\r\npartner. And there\'s Uncle Salters and his manures, an\' he reads\r\nJosephus. He\'s sure I\'m crazy yet. And there\'s poor little Penn, and he\r\nis crazy. You mustn\'t talk to him about Johnstown, because--\r\n\r\n"And, oh, you must know Tom Platt and Long Jack and Manuel. Manuel\r\nsaved my life. I\'m sorry he\'s a Portuguee. He can\'t talk much, but he\'s\r\nan everlasting musician. He found me struck adrift and drifting, and\r\nhauled me in."\r\n\r\n"I wonder your nervous system isn\'t completely wrecked," said Mrs.\r\nCheyne.\r\n\r\n"What for, Mama? I worked like a horse and I ate like a hog and I slept\r\nlike a dead man."\r\n\r\nThat was too much for Mrs. Cheyne, who began to think of her visions of\r\na corpse rocking on the salty seas. She went to her stateroom, and\r\nHarvey curled up beside his father, explaining his indebtedness.\r\n\r\n"You can depend upon me to do everything I can for the crowd, Harve.\r\nThey seem to be good men on your showing."\r\n\r\n"Best in the Fleet, sir. Ask at Gloucester," said Harvey. "But Disko\r\nbelieves still he\'s cured me of being crazy. Dan\'s the only one I\'ve\r\nlet on to about you, and our private cars and all the rest of it, and\r\nI\'m not quite sure Dan believes. I want to paralyze \'em to-morrow. Say,\r\ncan\'t they run the \'Constance\' over to Gloucester? Mama don\'t look fit\r\nto be moved, anyway, and we\'re bound to finish cleaning out by\r\ntomorrow. Wouverman takes our fish. You see, we\'re the first off the\r\nBanks this season, and it\'s four twenty-five a quintal. We held out\r\ntill he paid it. They want it quick."\r\n\r\n"You mean you\'ll have to work to-morrow, then?"\r\n\r\n"I told Troop I would. I\'m on the scales. I\'ve brought the tallies with\r\nme." He looked at the greasy notebook with an air of importance that\r\nmade his father choke. "There isn\'t but three--no--two ninety-four or\r\nfive quintal more by my reckoning."\r\n\r\n"Hire a substitute," suggested Cheyne, to see what Harvey would say.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t, sir. I\'m tally-man for the schooner. Troop says I\'ve a better\r\nhead for figures than Dan. Troop\'s a mighty just man."\r\n\r\n"Well, suppose I don\'t move the \'Constance\' to-night, how\'ll you fix\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nHarvey looked at the clock, which marked twenty past eleven.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll sleep here till three and catch the four o\'clock freight.\r\nThey let us men from the Fleet ride free as a rule."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a notion. But I think we can get the \'Constance\' around about\r\nas soon as your men\'s freight. Better go to bed now."\r\n\r\nHarvey spread himself on the sofa, kicked off his boots, and was asleep\r\nbefore his father could shade the electrics. Cheyne sat watching the\r\nyoung face under the shadow of the arm thrown over the forehead, and\r\namong many things that occurred to him was the notion that he might\r\nperhaps have been neglectful as a father.\r\n\r\n"One never knows when one\'s taking one\'s biggest risks," he said. "It\r\nmight have been worse than drowning; but I don\'t think it has--I don\'t\r\nthink it has. If it hasn\'t, I haven\'t enough to pay Troop, that\'s all;\r\nand I don\'t think it has."\r\n\r\nMorning brought a fresh sea breeze through the windows, the "Constance"\r\nwas side-tracked among freight-cars at Gloucester, and Harvey had gone\r\nto his business.\r\n\r\n"Then he\'ll fall overboard again and be drowned," the mother said\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go and look, ready to throw him a rope in case. You\'ve never\r\nseen him working for his bread," said the father.\r\n\r\n"What nonsense! As if any one expected--"\r\n\r\n"Well, the man that hired him did. He\'s about right, too."\r\n\r\nThey went down between the stores full of fishermen\'s oilskins to\r\nWouverman\'s wharf where the _We\'re Here_ rode high, her Bank flag still\r\nflying, all hands busy as beavers in the glorious morning light. Disko\r\nstood by the main hatch superintending Manuel, Penn, and Uncle Salters\r\nat the tackle. Dan was swinging the loaded baskets inboard as Long Jack\r\nand Tom Platt filled them, and Harvey, with a notebook, represented the\r\nskipper\'s interests before the clerk of the scales on the\r\nsalt-sprinkled wharf-edge.\r\n\r\n"Ready!" cried the voices below. "Haul!" cried Disko. "Hi!" said\r\nManuel. "Here!" said Dan, swinging the basket. Then they heard Harvey\'s\r\nvoice, clear and fresh, checking the weights.\r\n\r\nThe last of the fish had been whipped out, and Harvey leaped from the\r\nstring-piece six feet to a ratline, as the shortest way to hand Disko\r\nthe tally, shouting, "Two ninety-seven, and an empty hold!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the total, Harve?" said Disko.\r\n\r\n"Eight sixty-five. Three thousand six hundred and seventy-six dollars\r\nand a quarter. \'Wish I\'d share as well as wage."\r\n\r\n"Well, I won\'t go so far as to say you hevn\'t deserved it, Harve. Don\'t\r\nyou want to slip up to Wouverman\'s office and take him our tallies?"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that boy?" said Cheyne to Dan, well used to all manner of\r\nquestions from those idle imbeciles called summer boarders.\r\n\r\n"Well, he\'s kind o\' supercargo," was the answer. "We picked him up\r\nstruck adrift on the Banks. Fell overboard from a liner, he sez. He was\r\na passenger. He\'s by way o\' hem\' a fisherman now."\r\n\r\n"Is he worth his keep?"\r\n\r\n"Ye-ep. Dad, this man wants to know ef Harve\'s worth his keep. Say,\r\nwould you like to go aboard? We\'ll fix up a ladder for her."\r\n\r\n"I should very much, indeed. \'Twon\'t hurt you, Mama, and you\'ll be able\r\nto see for yourself."\r\n\r\nThe woman who could not lift her head a week ago scrambled down the\r\nladder, and stood aghast amid the mess and tangle aft.\r\n\r\n"Be you anyways interested in Harve?" said Disko.\r\n\r\n"Well, ye-es."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a good boy, an\' ketches right hold jest as he\'s bid. You\'ve heard\r\nhaow we found him? He was sufferin\' from nervous prostration, I guess,\r\n\'r else his head had hit somethin\', when we hauled him aboard. He\'s all\r\nover that naow. Yes, this is the cabin. \'Tain\'t in order, but you\'re\r\nquite welcome to look araound. Those are his figures on the stove-pipe,\r\nwhere we keep the reckonin\' mostly."\r\n\r\n"Did he sleep here?" said Mrs. Cheyne, sitting on a yellow locker and\r\nsurveying the disorderly bunks.\r\n\r\n"No. He berthed forward, madam, an\' only fer him an\' my boy hookin\'\r\nfried pies an muggin\' up when they ought to ha\' been asleep, I dunno as\r\nI\'ve any special fault to find with him."\r\n\r\n"There weren\'t nothin\' wrong with Harve," said Uncle Salters,\r\ndescending the steps. "He hung my boots on the main-truck, and he ain\'t\r\nover an\' above respectful to such as knows more\'n he do, specially\r\nabout farmin\'; but he were mostly misled by Dan."\r\n\r\nDan in the meantime, profiting by dark hints from Harvey early that\r\nmorning, was executing a war-dance on deck. "Tom, Tom!" he whispered\r\ndown the hatch. "His folks has come, an\' Dad hain\'t caught on yet, an\'\r\nthey\'re pow-wowin\' in the cabin. She\'s a daisy, an\' he\'s all Harve\r\nclaimed he was, by the looks of him."\r\n\r\n"Howly Smoke!" said Long Jack, climbing out covered with salt and\r\nfish-skin. "D\'ye belave his tale av the kid an\' the little four-horse\r\nrig was thrue?"\r\n\r\n"I knew it all along," said Dan. "Come an\' see Dad mistook in his\r\njudgments."\r\n\r\nThey came delightedly, just in time to hear Cheyne say: "I\'m glad he\r\nhas a good character, because--he\'s my son."\r\n\r\nDisko\'s jaw fell,--Long Jack always vowed that he heard the click of\r\nit,--and he stared alternately at the man and the woman.\r\n\r\n"I got his telegram in San Diego four days ago, and we came over."\r\n\r\n"In a private car?" said Dan. "He said ye might."\r\n\r\n"In a private car, of course."\r\n\r\nDan looked at his father with a hurricane of irreverent winks.\r\n\r\n"There was a tale he told us av drivin\' four little ponies in a rig av\r\nhis own," said Long Jack. "Was that thrue now?"\r\n\r\n"Very likely," said Cheyne. "Was it, Mama?"\r\n\r\n"He had a little drag when we were in Toledo, I think," said the mother.\r\n\r\nLong Jack whistled. "Oh, Disko!" said he, and that was all.\r\n\r\n"I wuz--I am mistook in my jedgments--worse\'n the men o\' Marblehead,"\r\nsaid Disko, as though the words were being windlassed out of him. "I\r\ndon\'t mind ownin\' to you, Mr. Cheyne, as I mistrusted the boy to be\r\ncrazy. He talked kinder odd about money."\r\n\r\n"So he told me."\r\n\r\n"Did he tell ye anything else? \'Cause I pounded him once." This with a\r\nsomewhat anxious glance at Mrs. Cheyne.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," Cheyne replied. "I should say it probably did him more good\r\nthan anything else in the world."\r\n\r\n"I jedged \'twuz necessary, er I wouldn\'t ha\' done it. I don\'t want you\r\nto think we abuse our boys any on this packet."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you do, Mr. Troop."\r\n\r\nMrs. Cheyne had been looking at the faces--Disko\'s ivory-yellow,\r\nhairless, iron countenance; Uncle Salters\'s, with its rim of\r\nagricultural hair; Penn\'s bewildered simplicity; Manuel\'s quiet smile;\r\nLong Jack\'s grin of delight, and Tom Platt\'s scar. Rough, by her\r\nstandards, they certainly were; but she had a mother\'s wits in her\r\neyes, and she rose with out-stretched hands.\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell me, which is who?" said she, half sobbing. "I want to thank\r\nyou and bless you--all of you."\r\n\r\n"Faith, that pays me a hunder time," said Long Jack.\r\n\r\nDisko introduced them all in due form. The captain of an old-time\r\nChinaman could have done no better, and Mrs. Cheyne babbled\r\nincoherently. She nearly threw herself into Manuel\'s arms when she\r\nunderstood that he had first found Harvey.\r\n\r\n"But how shall I leave him dreeft?" said poor Manuel. "What do you\r\nyourself if you find him so? Eh, wha-at? We are in one good boy, and I\r\nam ever so pleased he come to be your son."\r\n\r\n"And he told me Dan was his partner!" she cried. Dan was already\r\nsufficiently pink, but he turned a rich crimson when Mrs. Cheyne kissed\r\nhim on both cheeks before the assembly. Then they led her forward to\r\nshow her the foc\'sle, at which she wept again, and must needs go down\r\nto see Harvey\'s identical bunk, and there she found the nigger cook\r\ncleaning up the stove, and he nodded as though she were some one he had\r\nexpected to meet for years. They tried, two at a time, to explain the\r\nboat\'s daily life to her, and she sat by the pawl-post, her gloved\r\nhands on the greasy table, laughing with trembling lips and crying with\r\ndancing eyes.\r\n\r\n"And who\'s ever to use the _We\'re Here_ after this?" said Long Jack to\r\nTom Platt. "I feel as if she\'d made a cathedral av ut all."\r\n\r\n"Cathedral!" sneered Tom Platt. "Oh, if it had bin even the Fish\r\nC\'mmission boat instid of this bally-hoo o\' blazes. If we only hed some\r\ndecency an\' order an\' side-boys when she goes over! She\'ll have to\r\nclimb that ladder like a hen, an\' we--we ought to be mannin\' the yards!"\r\n\r\n"Then Harvey was not mad," said Penn, slowly, to Cheyne.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed--thank God," the big millionaire replied, stooping down\r\ntenderly.\r\n\r\n"It must be terrible to be mad. Except to lose your child, I do not\r\nknow anything more terrible. But your child has come back? Let us thank\r\nGod for that."\r\n\r\n"Hello!" cried Harvey, looking down upon them benignly from the wharf.\r\n\r\n"I wuz mistook, Harve. I wuz mistook," said Disko, swiftly, holding up\r\na hand. "I wuz mistook in my jedgments. Ye needn\'t rub in any more."\r\n\r\n"Guess I\'ll take care o\' that," said Dan, under his breath.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be goin\' off naow, won\'t ye?"\r\n\r\n"Well, not without the balance of my wages, \'less you want to have the\r\n_We\'re Here_ attached."\r\n\r\n"Thet\'s so; I\'d clean forgot"; and he counted out the remaining\r\ndollars. "You done all you contracted to do, Harve; and you done it\r\n\'baout\'s well as if you\'d been brought up--" Here Disko brought himself\r\nup. He did not quite see where the sentence was going to end.\r\n\r\n"Outside of a private car?" suggested Dan, wickedly.\r\n\r\n"Come on, and I\'ll show her to you," said Harvey.\r\n\r\nCheyne stayed to talk with Disko, but the others made a procession to\r\nthe depot, with Mrs. Cheyne at the head. The French maid shrieked at\r\nthe invasion; and Harvey laid the glories of the "Constance" before\r\nthem without a word. They took them in in equal silence--stamped\r\nleather, silver door-handles and rails, cut velvet, plate-glass,\r\nnickel, bronze, hammered iron, and the rare woods of the continent\r\ninlaid.\r\n\r\n"I told you," said Harvey; "I told you." This was his crowning revenge,\r\nand a most ample one.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cheyne decreed a meal, and that nothing might be lacking to the\r\ntale Long Jack told afterwards in his boarding-house, she waited on\r\nthem herself. Men who are accustomed to eat at tiny tables in howling\r\ngales have curiously neat and finished manners; but Mrs. Cheyne, who\r\ndid not know this, was surprised. She longed to have Manuel for a\r\nbutler; so silently and easily did he comport himself among the frail\r\nglassware and dainty silver. Tom Platt remembered the great days on the\r\nOhio and the manners of foreign potentates who dined with the officers;\r\nand Long Jack, being Irish, supplied the small talk till all were at\r\ntheir ease.\r\n\r\nIn the _We\'re Here\'s_ cabin the fathers took stock of each other behind\r\ntheir cigars. Cheyne knew well enough when he dealt with a man to whom\r\nhe could not offer money; equally well he knew that no money could pay\r\nfor what Disko had done. He kept his own counsel and waited for an\r\nopening.\r\n\r\n"I hevn\'t done anything to your boy or fer your boy excep\' make him\r\nwork a piece an\' learn him how to handle the hog-yoke," said Disko. "He\r\nhas twice my boy\'s head for figgers."\r\n\r\n"By the way," Cheyne answered casually, "what d\'you calculate to make\r\nof your boy?"\r\n\r\nDisko removed his cigar and waved it comprehensively round the cabin.\r\n"Dan\'s jest plain boy, an\' he don\'t allow me to do any of his thinkin\'.\r\nHe\'ll hev this able little packet when I\'m laid by. He ain\'t noways\r\nanxious to quit the business. I know that."\r\n\r\n"Mmm! \'Ever been West, Mr. Troop?"\r\n\r\n"\'Bin\'s fer ez Noo York once in a boat. I\'ve no use for railroads. No\r\nmore hez Dan. Salt water\'s good enough fer the Troops. I\'ve been \'most\r\neverywhere--in the nat\'ral way, o\' course."\r\n\r\n"I can give him all the salt water he\'s likely to need--till he\'s a\r\nskipper."\r\n\r\n"Haow\'s that? I thought you wuz a kinder railroad king. Harve told me\r\nso when--I was mistook in my jedgments."\r\n\r\n"We\'re all apt to be mistaken. I fancied perhaps you might know I own a\r\nline of tea-clippers--San Francisco to Yokohama--six of\r\n\'em--iron-built, about seventeen hundred and eighty tons apiece.\r\n\r\n"Blame that boy! He never told. I\'d ha\' listened to that, instid o\' his\r\ntruck abaout railroads an\' pony-carriages."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t know."\r\n\r\n"\'Little thing like that slipped his mind, I guess."\r\n\r\n"No, I only capt--took hold of the \'Blue M.\' freighters--Morgan and\r\nMcQuade\'s old line--this summer." Disko collapsed where he sat, beside\r\nthe stove.\r\n\r\n"Great Caesar Almighty! I mistrust I\'ve been fooled from one end to the\r\nother. Why, Phil Airheart he went from this very town six year\r\nback--no, seven--an\' he\'s mate on the San Jose--now--twenty-six days\r\nwas her time out. His sister she\'s livin\' here yet, an\' she reads his\r\nletters to my woman. An\' you own the \'Blue M.\' freighters?"\r\n\r\nCheyne nodded.\r\n\r\n"If I\'d known that I\'d ha\' jerked the _We\'re Here_ back to port all\r\nstandin\', on the word."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps that wouldn\'t have been so good for Harvey."\r\n\r\n"If I\'d only known! If he\'d only said about the cussed Line, I\'d ha\'\r\nunderstood! I\'ll never stand on my own jedgments again--never. They\'re\r\nwell-found packets. Phil Airheart he says so."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to have a recommend from that quarter. Airheart\'s skipper of\r\nthe San Jose now. What I was getting at is to know whether you\'d lend\r\nme Dan for a year or two, and we\'ll see if we can\'t make a mate of him.\r\nWould you trust him to Airheart?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a resk taking a raw boy--"\r\n\r\n"I know a man who did more for me."\r\n\r\n"That\'s diff\'runt. Look at here naow, I ain\'t recommendin\' Dan special\r\nbecause he\'s my own flesh an\' blood. I know Bank ways ain\'t clipper\r\nways, but he hain\'t much to learn. Steer he can--no boy better, if I\r\nsay it--an\' the rest\'s in our blood an\' get; but I could wish he warn\'t\r\nso cussed weak on navigation."\r\n\r\n"Airheart will attend to that. He\'ll ship as boy for a voyage or two,\r\nand then we can put him in the way of doing better. Suppose you take\r\nhim in hand this winter, and I\'ll send for him early in the spring. I\r\nknow the Pacific\'s a long ways off--"\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! We Troops, livin\' an\' dead, are all around the earth an\' the\r\nseas thereof."\r\n\r\n"But I want you to understand--and I mean this--any time you think\r\nyou\'d like to see him, tell me, and I\'ll attend to the transportation.\r\n\'Twon\'t cost you a cent."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll walk a piece with me, we\'ll go to my house an\' talk this to\r\nmy woman. I\'ve bin so crazy mistook in all my jedgments, it don\'t seem\r\nto me this was like to be real."\r\n\r\nThey went blue-trimmed of nasturtiums over to Troop\'s\r\neighteen-hundred-dollar, white house, with a retired dory full in the\r\nfront yard and a shuttered parlour which was a museum of oversea\r\nplunder. There sat a large woman, silent and grave, with the dim eyes\r\nof those who look long to sea for the return of their beloved. Cheyne\r\naddressed himself to her, and she gave consent wearily.\r\n\r\n"We lose one hundred a year from Gloucester only, Mr. Cheyne," she\r\nsaid--"one hundred boys an\' men; and I\'ve come so\'s to hate the sea as\r\nif \'twuz alive an\' listenin\'. God never made it fer humans to anchor\r\non. These packets o\' yours they go straight out, I take it\' and\r\nstraight home again?"\r\n\r\n"As straight as the winds let \'em, and I give a bonus for record\r\npassages. Tea don\'t improve by being at sea."\r\n\r\n"When he wuz little he used to play at keeping store, an\' I had hopes\r\nhe might follow that up. But soon\'s he could paddle a dory I knew that\r\nwere goin\' to be denied me."\r\n\r\n"They\'re square-riggers, Mother; iron-built an\' well found. Remember\r\nwhat Phil\'s sister reads you when she gits his letters."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never known as Phil told lies, but he\'s too venturesome (like\r\nmost of \'em that use the sea). If Dan sees fit, Mr. Cheyne, he can\r\ngo--fer all o\' me."\r\n\r\n"She jest despises the ocean," Disko explained, "an\' I--I dunno haow to\r\nact polite, I guess, er I\'d thank you better."\r\n\r\n"My father--my own eldest brother--two nephews--an\' my second sister\'s\r\nman," she said, dropping her head on her hand. "Would you care fer any\r\none that took all those?"\r\n\r\nCheyne was relieved when Dan turned up and accepted with more delight\r\nthan he was able to put into words. Indeed, the offer meant a plain and\r\nsure road to all desirable things; but Dan thought most of commanding\r\nwatch on broad decks, and looking into far-away harbours.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cheyne had spoken privately to the unaccountable Manuel in the\r\nmatter of Harvey\'s rescue. He seemed to have no desire for money.\r\nPressed hard, he said that he would take five dollars, because he\r\nwanted to buy something for a girl. Otherwise--"How shall I take money\r\nwhen I make so easy my eats and smokes? You will giva some if I like or\r\nno? Eh, wha-at? Then you shall giva me money, but not that way. You\r\nshall giva all you can think." He introduced her to a snuffy Portuguese\r\npriest with a list of semi-destitute widows as long as his cassock. As\r\na strict Unitarian, Mrs. Cheyne could not sympathize with the creed,\r\nbut she ended by respecting the brown, voluble little man.\r\n\r\nManuel, faithful son of the Church, appropriated all the blessings\r\nshowered on her for her charity. "That letta me out," said he. "I have\r\nnow ver\' good absolutions for six months"; and he strolled forth to get\r\na handkerchief for the girl of the hour and to break the hearts of all\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nSalters went West for a season with Penn, and left no address behind.\r\nHe had a dread that these millionary people, with wasteful private\r\ncars, might take undue interest in his companion. It was better to\r\nvisit inland relatives till the coast was clear. "Never you be adopted\r\nby rich folk, Penn," he said in the cars, "or I\'ll take \'n\' break this\r\nchecker-board over your head. Ef you forgit your name agin--which is\r\nPratt--you remember you belong with Salters Troop, an\' set down right\r\nwhere you are till I come fer you. Don\'t go taggin\' araound after them\r\nwhose eyes bung out with fatness, accordin\' to Scripcher."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBut it was otherwise with the _We\'re Here\'s_ silent cook, for he came\r\nup, his kit in a handkerchief, and boarded the "Constance." Pay was no\r\nparticular object, and he did not in the least care where he slept. His\r\nbusiness, as revealed to him in dreams, was to follow Harvey for the\r\nrest of his days. They tried argument and, at last, persuasion; but\r\nthere is a difference between one Cape Breton and two Alabama negroes,\r\nand the matter was referred to Cheyne by the cook and porter. The\r\nmillionaire only laughed. He presumed Harvey might need a body-servant\r\nsome day or other, and was sure that one volunteer was worth five\r\nhirelings. Let the man stay, therefore; even though he called himself\r\nMacDonald and swore in Gaelic. The car could go back to Boston, where,\r\nif he were still of the same mind, they would take him West.\r\n\r\nWith the "Constance," which in his heart of hearts he loathed, departed\r\nthe last remnant of Cheyne\'s millionairedom, and he gave himself up to\r\nan energetic idleness. This Gloucester was a new town in a new land,\r\nand he purposed to "take it in," as of old he had taken in all the\r\ncities from Snohomish to San Diego of that world whence he hailed. They\r\nmade money along the crooked street which was half wharf and half\r\nship\'s store: as a leading professional he wished to learn how the\r\nnoble game was played. Men said that four out of every five fish-balls\r\nserved at New England\'s Sunday breakfast came from Gloucester, and\r\noverwhelmed him with figures in proof--statistics of boats, gear,\r\nwharf-frontage, capital invested, salting, packing, factories,\r\ninsurance, wages, repairs, and profits. He talked with the owners of\r\nthe large fleets whose skippers were little more than hired men, and\r\nwhose crews were almost all Swedes or Portuguese. Then he conferred\r\nwith Disko, one of the few who owned their craft, and compared notes in\r\nhis vast head. He coiled himself away on chain-cables in marine\r\njunk-shops, asking questions with cheerful, unslaked Western curiosity,\r\ntill all the water-front wanted to know "what in thunder that man was\r\nafter, anyhow." He prowled into the Mutual Insurance rooms, and\r\ndemanded explanations of the mysterious remarks chalked up on the\r\nblackboard day by day; and that brought down upon him secretaries of\r\nevery Fisherman\'s Widow and Orphan Aid Society within the city limits.\r\nThey begged shamelessly, each man anxious to beat the other\r\ninstitution\'s record, and Cheyne tugged at his beard and handed them\r\nall over to Mrs. Cheyne.\r\n\r\nShe was resting in a boarding-house near Eastern Point--a strange\r\nestablishment, managed, apparently, by the boarders, where the\r\ntable-cloths were red-and-white-checkered and the population, who\r\nseemed to have known one another intimately for years, rose up at\r\nmidnight to make Welsh rarebits if it felt hungry. On the second\r\nmorning of her stay Mrs. Cheyne put away her diamond solitaires before\r\nshe came down to breakfast.\r\n\r\n"They\'re most delightful people," she confided to her husband; "so\r\nfriendly and simple, too, though they are all Boston, nearly."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t simpleness, Mama," he said, looking across the boulders\r\nbehind the apple-trees where the hammocks were slung. "It\'s the other\r\nthing, that what I haven\'t got."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be," said Mrs. Cheyne quietly. "There isn\'t a woman here owns\r\na dress that cost a hundred dollars. Why, we--"\r\n\r\n"I know it, dear. We have--of course we have. I guess it\'s only the\r\nstyle they wear East. Are you having a good time?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see very much of Harvey; he\'s always with you; but I ain\'t\r\nnear as nervous as I was."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t had such a good time since Willie died. I never rightly\r\nunderstood that I had a son before this. Harve\'s got to be a great boy.\r\n\'Anything I can fetch you, dear? \'Cushion under your head? Well, we\'ll\r\ngo down to the wharf again and look around."\r\n\r\nHarvey was his father\'s shadow in those days, and the two strolled\r\nalong side by side, Cheyne using the grades as an excuse for laying his\r\nhand on the boy\'s square shoulder. It was then that Harvey noticed and\r\nadmired what had never struck him before--his father\'s curious power of\r\ngetting at the heart of new matters as learned from men in the street.\r\n\r\n"How d\'you make \'em tell you everything without opening your head?"\r\ndemanded the son, as they came out of a rigger\'s loft.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve dealt with quite a few men in my time, Harve, and one sizes \'em\r\nup somehow, I guess. I know something about myself, too." Then, after a\r\npause, as they sat down on a wharf-edge: "Men can \'most always tell\r\nwhen a man has handled things for himself, and then they treat him as\r\none of themselves."\r\n\r\n"Same as they treat me down at Wouverman\'s wharf. I\'m one of the crowd\r\nnow. Disko has told every one I\'ve earned my pay." Harvey spread out\r\nhis hands and rubbed the palms together. "They\'re all soft again," he\r\nsaid dolefully.\r\n\r\n"Keep \'em that way for the next few years, while you\'re getting your\r\neducation. You can harden \'em up after."\r\n\r\n"Ye-es, I suppose so," was the reply, in no delighted voice.\r\n\r\n"It rests with you, Harve. You can take cover behind your mama, of\r\ncourse, and put her on to fussing about your nerves and your\r\nhigh-strungness and all that kind of poppycock."\r\n\r\n"Have I ever done that?" said Harvey, uneasily.\r\n\r\nHis father turned where he sat and thrust out a long hand. "You know as\r\nwell as I do that I can\'t make anything of you if you don\'t act\r\nstraight by me. I can handle you alone if you\'ll stay alone, but I\r\ndon\'t pretend to manage both you and Mama. Life\'s too short, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t make me out much of a fellow, does it?"\r\n\r\n"I guess it was my fault a good deal; but if you want the truth, you\r\nhaven\'t been much of anything up to date. Now, have you?"\r\n\r\n"Umm! Disko thinks . . . Say, what d\'you reckon it\'s cost you to raise\r\nme from the start--first, last and all over?"\r\n\r\nCheyne smiled. "I\'ve never kept track, but I should estimate, in\r\ndollars and cents, nearer fifty than forty thousand; maybe sixty. The\r\nyoung generation comes high. It has to have things, and it tires of\r\n\'em, and--the old man foots the bill."\r\n\r\nHarvey whistled, but at heart he was rather pleased to think that his\r\nupbringing had cost so much. "And all that\'s sunk capital, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Invested, Harve. Invested, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Making it only thirty thousand, the thirty I\'ve earned is about ten\r\ncents on the hundred. That\'s a mighty poor catch." Harvey wagged his\r\nhead solemnly.\r\n\r\nCheyne laughed till he nearly fell off the pile into the water.\r\n\r\n"Disko has got a heap more than that out of Dan since he was ten; and\r\nDan\'s at school half the year, too."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s what you\'re after, is it?"\r\n\r\n"No. I\'m not after anything. I\'m not stuck on myself any just\r\nnow--that\'s all. . . . I ought to be kicked."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do it, old man; or I would, I presume, if I\'d been made that\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'d have remembered it to the last day I lived--and never\r\nforgiven you," said Harvey, his chin on his doubled fists.\r\n\r\n"Exactly. That\'s about what I\'d do. You see?"\r\n\r\n"I see. The fault\'s with me and no one else. All the same, something\'s\r\ngot to be done about it."\r\n\r\nCheyne drew a cigar from his vest-pocket, bit off the end, and fell to\r\nsmoking. Father and son were very much alike; for the beard hid\r\nCheyne\'s mouth, and Harvey had his father\'s slightly aquiline nose,\r\nclose-set black eyes, and narrow, high cheek-bones. With a touch of\r\nbrown paint he would have made up very picturesquely as a Red Indian of\r\nthe story-books.\r\n\r\n"Now you can go on from here," said Cheyne, slowly, "costing me between\r\nsix or eight thousand a year till you\'re a voter. Well, we\'ll call you\r\na man then. You can go right on from that, living on me to the tune of\r\nforty or fifty thousand, besides what your mother will give you, with a\r\nvalet and a yacht or a fancy-ranch where you can pretend to raise\r\ntrotting-stock and play cards with your own crowd."\r\n\r\n"Like Lorry Tuck?" Harvey put in.\r\n\r\n"Yep; or the two De Vitre boys or old man McQuade\'s son. California\'s\r\nfull of \'em, and here\'s an Eastern sample while we\'re talking."\r\n\r\nA shiny black steam-yacht, with mahogany deck-house, nickel-plated\r\nbinnacles, and pink-and-white-striped awnings puffed up the harbour,\r\nflying the burgee of some New York club. Two young men in what they\r\nconceived to be sea costumes were playing cards by the saloon skylight;\r\nand a couple of women with red and blue parasols looked on and laughed\r\nnoisily.\r\n\r\n"Shouldn\'t care to be caught out in her in any sort of a breeze. No\r\nbeam," said Harvey, critically, as the yacht slowed to pick up her\r\nmooring-buoy.\r\n\r\n"They\'re having what stands them for a good time. I can give you that,\r\nand twice as much as that, Harve. How\'d you like it?"\r\n\r\n"Caesar! That\'s no way to get a dinghy overside," said Harvey, still\r\nintent on the yacht. "If I couldn\'t slip a tackle better than that I\'d\r\nstay ashore. . . . What if I don\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Stay ashore--or what?"\r\n\r\n"Yacht and ranch and live on \'the old man,\' and--get behind Mama where\r\nthere\'s trouble," said Harvey, with a twinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\n"Why, in that case, you come right in with me, my son."\r\n\r\n"Ten dollars a month?" Another twinkle.\r\n\r\n"Not a cent more until you\'re worth it, and you won\'t begin to touch\r\nthat for a few years."\r\n\r\n"I\'d sooner begin sweeping out the office--isn\'t that how the big bugs\r\nstart?--and touch something now than--"\r\n\r\n"I know it; we all feel that way. But I guess we can hire any sweeping\r\nwe need. I made the same mistake myself of starting in too soon."\r\n\r\n"Thirty million dollars\' worth o\' mistake, wasn\'t it? I\'d risk it for\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"I lost some; and I gained some. I\'ll tell you."\r\n\r\nCheyne pulled his beard and smiled as he looked over the still water,\r\nand spoke away from Harvey, who presently began to be aware that his\r\nfather was telling the story of his life. He talked in a low, even\r\nvoice, without gesture and without expression; and it was a history for\r\nwhich a dozen leading journals would cheerfully have paid many\r\ndollars--the story of forty years that was at the same time the story\r\nof the New West, whose story is yet to be written.\r\n\r\nIt began with a kinless boy turned loose in Texas, and went on\r\nfantastically through a hundred changes and chops of life, the scenes\r\nshifting from State after Western State, from cities that sprang up in\r\na month and--in a season utterly withered away, to wild ventures in\r\nwilder camps that are now laborious, paved municipalities. It covered\r\nthe building of three railroads and the deliberate wreck of a fourth.\r\nIt told of steamers, townships, forests, and mines, and the men of\r\nevery nation under heaven, manning, creating, hewing, and digging\r\nthese. It touched on chances of gigantic wealth flung before eyes that\r\ncould not see, or missed by the merest accident of time and travel; and\r\nthrough the mad shift of things, sometimes on horseback, more often\r\nafoot, now rich, now poor, in and out, and back and forth, deck-hand,\r\ntrain-hand, contractor, boarding-house keeper, journalist, engineer,\r\ndrummer, real-estate agent, politician, dead-beat, rum-seller,\r\nmine-owner, speculator, cattle-man, or tramp, moved Harvey Cheyne,\r\nalert and quiet, seeking his own ends, and, so he said, the glory and\r\nadvancement of his country.\r\n\r\nHe told of the faith that never deserted him even when he hung on the\r\nragged edge of despair--the faith that comes of knowing men and things.\r\nHe enlarged, as though he were talking to himself, on his very great\r\ncourage and resource at all times. The thing was so evident in the\r\nman\'s mind that he never even changed his tone. He described how he had\r\nbested his enemies, or forgiven them, exactly as they had bested or\r\nforgiven him in those careless days; how he had entreated, cajoled, and\r\nbullied towns, companies, and syndicates, all for their enduring good;\r\ncrawled round, through, or under mountains and ravines, dragging a\r\nstring and hoop-iron railroad after him, and in the end, how he had sat\r\nstill while promiscuous communities tore the last fragments of his\r\ncharacter to shreds.\r\n\r\nThe tale held Harvey almost breathless, his head a little cocked to one\r\nside, his eyes fixed on his father\'s face, as the twilight deepened and\r\nthe red cigar-end lit up the furrowed cheeks and heavy eyebrows. It\r\nseemed to him like watching a locomotive storming across country in the\r\ndark--a mile between each glare of the open fire-door: but this\r\nlocomotive could talk, and the words shook and stirred the boy to the\r\ncore of his soul. At last Cheyne pitched away the cigar-butt, and the\r\ntwo sat in the dark over the lapping water.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never told that to any one before," said the father.\r\n\r\nHarvey gasped. "It\'s just the greatest thing that ever was!" said he.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I got. Now I\'m coming to what I didn\'t get. It won\'t sound\r\nmuch of anything to you, but I don\'t wish you to be as old as I am\r\nbefore you find out. I can handle men, of course, and I\'m no fool along\r\nmy own lines, but--but--I can\'t compete with the man who has been\r\ntaught! I\'ve picked up as I went along, and I guess it sticks out all\r\nover me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never seen it," said the son, indignantly.\r\n\r\n"You will, though, Harve. You will--just as soon as you\'re through\r\ncollege. Don\'t I know it? Don\'t I know the look on men\'s faces when\r\nthey think me a--a \'mucker,\' as they call it out here? I can break them\r\nto little pieces--yes--but I can\'t get back at \'em to hurt \'em where\r\nthey live. I don\'t say they\'re \'way \'way up, but I feel I\'m \'way, \'way,\r\n\'way off, somehow. Now you\'ve got your chance. You\'ve got to soak up\r\nall the learning that\'s around, and you\'ll live with a crowd that are\r\ndoing the same thing. They\'ll be doing it for a few thousand dollars a\r\nyear at most; but remember you\'ll be doing it for millions. You\'ll\r\nlearn law enough to look after your own property when I\'m out o\' the\r\nlight, and you\'ll have to be solid with the best men in the market\r\n(they are useful later); and above all, you\'ll have to stow away the\r\nplain, common, sit-down-with-your chin-on your-elbows book-learning.\r\nNothing pays like that, Harve, and it\'s bound to pay more and more each\r\nyear in our country--in business and in politics. You\'ll see."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no sugar in my end of the deal," said Harvey. "Four years at\r\ncollege! \'Wish I\'d chosen the valet and the yacht!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind, my son," Cheyne insisted. "You\'re investing your capital\r\nwhere it\'ll bring in the best returns; and I guess you won\'t find our\r\nproperty shrunk any when you\'re ready to take hold. Think it over, and\r\nlet me know in the morning. Hurry! We\'ll be late for supper!"\r\n\r\nAs this was a business talk, there was no need for Harvey to tell his\r\nmother about it; and Cheyne naturally took the same point of view. But\r\nMrs. Cheyne saw and feared, and was a little jealous. Her boy, who rode\r\nrough-shod over her, was gone, and in his stead reigned a keen-faced\r\nyouth, abnormally silent, who addressed most of his conversation to his\r\nfather. She understood it was business, and therefore a matter beyond\r\nher premises. If she had any doubts, they were resolved when Cheyne\r\nwent to Boston and brought back a new diamond marquise ring.\r\n\r\n"What have you two been doing now?" she said, with a weak little smile,\r\nas she turned it in the light.\r\n\r\n"Talking--just talking, Mama; there\'s nothing mean about Harvey."\r\n\r\nThere was not. The boy had made a treaty on his own account. Railroads,\r\nhe explained gravely, interested him as little as lumber, real estate,\r\nor mining. What his soul yearned after was control of his father\'s\r\nnewly purchased sailing-ship. If that could be promised him within what\r\nhe conceived to be a reasonable time, he, for his part, guaranteed\r\ndiligence and sobriety at college for four or five years. In vacation\r\nhe was to be allowed full access to all details connected with the\r\nline--he had not asked more than two thousand questions about it,--from\r\nhis father\'s most private papers in the safe to the tug in San\r\nFrancisco harbour.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a deal," said Cheyne at the last. "You\'ll alter your mind twenty\r\ntimes before you leave college, o\' course; but if you take hold of it\r\nin proper shape, and if you don\'t tie it up before you\'re twenty-three,\r\nI\'ll make the thing over to you. How\'s that, Harve?"\r\n\r\n"Nope; never pays to split up a going concern. There\'s too much\r\ncompetition in the world anyway, and Disko says \'blood-kin hev to stick\r\ntogether.\' His crowd never go back on him. That\'s one reason, he says,\r\nwhy they make such big fares. Say, the _We\'re Here_ goes off to the\r\nGeorges on Monday. They don\'t stay long ashore, do they?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we ought to be going, too, I guess. I\'ve left my business hung\r\nup at loose ends between two oceans, and it\'s time to connect again. I\r\njust hate to do it, though; haven\'t had a holiday like this for twenty\r\nyears."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t go without seeing Disko off," said Harvey; "and Monday\'s\r\nMemorial Day. Let\'s stay over that, anyway."\r\n\r\n"What is this memorial business? They were talking about it at the\r\nboarding-house," said Cheyne weakly. He, too, was not anxious to spoil\r\nthe golden days.\r\n\r\n"Well, as far as I can make out, this business is a sort of\r\nsong-and-dance act, whacked up for the summer boarders. Disko don\'t\r\nthink much of it, he says, because they take up a collection for the\r\nwidows and orphans. Disko\'s independent. Haven\'t you noticed that?"\r\n\r\n"Well--yes. A little. In spots. Is it a town show, then?"\r\n\r\n"The summer convention is. They read out the names of the fellows\r\ndrowned or gone astray since last time, and they make speeches, and\r\nrecite, and all. Then, Disko says, the secretaries of the Aid Societies\r\ngo into the back yard and fight over the catch. The real show, he says,\r\nis in the spring. The ministers all take a hand then, and there aren\'t\r\nany summer boarders around."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Cheyne, with the brilliant and perfect comprehension of\r\none born into and bred up to city pride. "We\'ll stay over for Memorial\r\nDay, and get off in the afternoon."\r\n\r\n"Guess I\'ll go down to Disko\'s and make him bring his crowd up before\r\nthey sail. I\'ll have to stand with them, of course."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s it, is it," said Cheyne. "I\'m only a poor summer boarder,\r\nand you\'re--"\r\n\r\n"A Banker--full-blooded Banker," Harvey called back as he boarded a\r\ntrolley, and Cheyne went on with his blissful dreams for the future.\r\n\r\nDisko had no use for public functions where appeals were made for\r\ncharity, but Harvey pleaded that the glory of the day would be lost, so\r\nfar as he was concerned, if the _We\'re Heres_ absented themselves. Then\r\nDisko made conditions. He had heard--it was astonishing how all the\r\nworld knew all the world\'s business along the water-front--he had heard\r\nthat a "Philadelphia actress-woman" was going to take part in the\r\nexercises; and he mistrusted that she would deliver "Skipper Ireson\'s\r\nRide." Personally, he had as little use for actresses as for summer\r\nboarders; but justice was justice, and though he himself (here Dan\r\ngiggled) had once slipped up on a matter of judgment, this thing must\r\nnot be. So Harvey came back to East Gloucester, and spent half a day\r\nexplaining to an amused actress with a royal reputation on two\r\nseaboards the inwardness of the mistake she contemplated; and she\r\nadmitted that it was justice, even as Disko had said.\r\n\r\nCheyne knew by old experience what would happen; but anything of the\r\nnature of a public palaver was meat and drink to the man\'s soul. He saw\r\nthe trolleys hurrying west, in the hot, hazy morning, full of women in\r\nlight summer dresses, and white-faced straw-hatted men fresh from\r\nBoston desks; the stack of bicycles outside the post office; the\r\ncome-and-go of busy officials, greeting one another; the slow flick and\r\nswash of bunting in the heavy air; and the important man with a hose\r\nsluicing the brick sidewalk.\r\n\r\n"Mother," he said suddenly, "don\'t you remember--after Seattle was\r\nburned out--and they got her going again?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cheyne nodded, and looked critically down the crooked street. Like\r\nher husband, she understood these gatherings, all the West over, and\r\ncompared them one against another. The fishermen began to mingle with\r\nthe crowd about the town-hall doors--blue-jowled Portuguese, their\r\nwomen bare-headed or shawled for the most part; clear-eyed Nova\r\nScotians, and men of the Maritime Provinces; French, Italians, Swedes,\r\nand Danes, with outside crews of coasting schooners; and everywhere\r\nwomen in black, who saluted one another with gloomy pride, for this was\r\ntheir day of great days. And there were ministers of many\r\ncreeds,--pastors of great, gilt-edged congregations, at the seaside for\r\na rest, with shepherds of the regular work,--from the priests of the\r\nChurch on the Hill to bush-bearded ex-sailor Lutherans, hail-fellow\r\nwith the men of a score of boats. There were owners of lines of\r\nschooners, large contributors to the societies, and small men, their\r\nfew craft pawned to the mastheads, with bankers and marine-insurance\r\nagents, captains of tugs and water-boats, riggers, fitters, lumpers,\r\nsalters, boat-builders, and coopers, and all the mixed population of\r\nthe water-front.\r\n\r\nThey drifted along the line of seats made gay with the dresses of the\r\nsummer boarders, and one of the town officials patrolled and perspired\r\ntill he shone all over with pure civic pride. Cheyne had met him for\r\nfive minutes a few days before, and between the two there was entire\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Cheyne, and what d\'you think of our city?--Yes, madam, you\r\ncan sit anywhere you please.--You have this kind of thing out West, I\r\npresume?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but we aren\'t as old as you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s so, of course. You ought to have been at the exercises when we\r\ncelebrated our two hundred and fiftieth birthday. I tell you, Mr.\r\nCheyne, the old city did herself credit."\r\n\r\n"So I heard. It pays, too. What\'s the matter with the town that it\r\ndon\'t have a first-class hotel, though?"\r\n\r\n"--Right over there to the left, Pedro. Heaps o\' room for you and your\r\ncrowd.--Why, that\'s what I tell \'em all the time, Mr. Cheyne. There\'s\r\nbig money in it, but I presume that don\'t affect you any. What we want\r\nis--"\r\n\r\nA heavy hand fell on his broadcloth shoulder, and the flushed skipper\r\nof a Portland coal-and-ice coaster spun him half round. "What in\r\nthunder do you fellows mean by clappin\' the law on the town when all\r\ndecent men are at sea this way? Heh? Town\'s dry as a bone, an\' smells a\r\nsight worse sence I quit. \'Might ha\' left us one saloon for soft\r\ndrinks, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t seem to have hindered your nourishment this morning, Carsen.\r\nI\'ll go into the politics of it later. Sit down by the door and think\r\nover your arguments till I come back."\r\n\r\n"What good is arguments to me? In Miquelon champagne\'s eighteen dollars\r\na case and--" The skipper lurched into his seat as an organ-prelude\r\nsilenced him.\r\n\r\n"Our new organ," said the official proudly to Cheyne. "Cost us four\r\nthousand dollars, too. We\'ll have to get back to high-license next year\r\nto pay for it. I wasn\'t going to let the ministers have all the\r\nreligion at their convention. Those are some of our orphans standing up\r\nto sing. My wife taught \'em. See you again later, Mr. Cheyne. I\'m\r\nwanted on the platform."\r\n\r\nHigh, clear, and true, children\'s voices bore down the last noise of\r\nthose settling into their places.\r\n\r\n"O all ye Works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise him and magnify\r\nhim for ever!"\r\n\r\nThe women throughout the hall leaned forward to look as the reiterated\r\ncadences filled the air. Mrs. Cheyne, with some others, began to\r\nbreathe short; she had hardly imagined there were so many widows in the\r\nworld; and instinctively searched for Harvey. He had found the _We\'re\r\nHeres_ at the back of the audience, and was standing, as by right,\r\nbetween Dan and Disko. Uncle Salters, returned the night before with\r\nPenn, from Pamlico Sound, received him suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"Hain\'t your folk gone yet?" he grunted. "What are you doin\' here,\r\nyoung feller?"\r\n\r\n"O ye Seas and Floods, bless ye the Lord: praise him, and magnify him\r\nfor ever!"\r\n\r\n"Hain\'t he good right?" said Dan. "He\'s bin there, same as the rest of\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"Not in them clothes," Salters snarled.\r\n\r\n"Shut your head, Salters," said Disko. "Your bile\'s gone back on you.\r\nStay right where ye are, Harve."\r\n\r\nThen up and spoke the orator of the occasion, another pillar of the\r\nmunicipality, bidding the world welcome to Gloucester, and incidentally\r\npointing out wherein Gloucester excelled the rest of the world. Then he\r\nturned to the sea-wealth of the city, and spoke of the price that must\r\nbe paid for the yearly harvest. They would hear later the names of\r\ntheir lost dead one hundred and seventeen of them. (The widows stared a\r\nlittle, and looked at one another here.) Gloucester could not boast any\r\noverwhelming mills or factories. Her sons worked for such wage as the\r\nsea gave; and they all knew that neither Georges nor the Banks were\r\ncow-pastures. The utmost that folk ashore could accomplish was to help\r\nthe widows and the orphans, and after a few general remarks he took\r\nthis opportunity of thanking, in the name of the city, those who had so\r\npublic-spiritedly consented to participate in the exercises of the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n"I jest despise the beggin\' pieces in it," growled Disko. "It don\'t\r\ngive folk a fair notion of us."\r\n\r\n"Ef folk won\'t be fore-handed an\' put by when they\'ve the chance,"\r\nreturned Salters, "it stands in the nature o\' things they hev to be\r\n\'shamed. You take warnin\' by that, young feller. Riches endureth but\r\nfor a season, ef you scatter them araound on lugsuries--"\r\n\r\n"But to lose everything, everything," said Penn. "What can you do then?\r\nOnce I"--the watery blue eyes stared up and down as if looking for\r\nsomething to steady them--"once I read--in a book, I think--of a boat\r\nwhere every one was run down--except some one--and he said to me--"\r\n\r\n"Shucks!" said Salters, cutting in. "You read a little less an\' take\r\nmore int\'rust in your vittles, and you\'ll come nearer earnin\' your\r\nkeep, Penn."\r\n\r\nHarvey, jammed among the fishermen, felt a creepy, crawly, tingling\r\nthrill that began in the back of his neck and ended at his boots. He\r\nwas cold, too, though it was a stifling day.\r\n\r\n"That the actress from Philadelphia?" said Disko Troop, scowling at the\r\nplatform. "You\'ve fixed it about old man Ireson, hain\'t ye, Harve? Ye\r\nknow why naow."\r\n\r\nIt was not "Ireson\'s Ride" that the woman delivered, but some sort of\r\npoem about a fishing-port called Brixham and a fleet of trawlers\r\nbeating in against storm by night, while the women made a guiding fire\r\nat the head of the quay with everything they could lay hands on.\r\n\r\n    "They took the grandma\'s blanket,\r\n    Who shivered and bade them go;\r\n    They took the baby\'s cradle,\r\n    Who could not say them no."\r\n\r\n"Whew!" said Dan, peering over Long Jack\'s shoulder. "That\'s great!\r\nMust ha\' bin expensive, though."\r\n\r\n"Ground-hog case," said the Galway man. "Badly lighted port, Danny."\r\n\r\n    *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n    "And knew not all the while\r\n    If they were lighting a bonfire\r\n    Or only a funeral pile."\r\n\r\nThe wonderful voice took hold of people by their heartstrings; and when\r\nshe told how the drenched crews were flung ashore, living and dead, and\r\nthey carried the bodies to the glare of the fires, asking: "Child, is\r\nthis your father?" or "Wife, is this your man?" you could hear hard\r\nbreathing all over the benches.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "And when the boats of Brixham\r\n    Go out to face the gales,\r\n    Think of the love that travels\r\n    Like light upon their sails!"\r\n\r\nThere was very little applause when she finished. The women were\r\nlooking for their handkerchiefs, and many of the men stared at the\r\nceiling with shiny eyes.\r\n\r\n"H\'m," said Salters; "that \'u\'d cost ye a dollar to hear at any\r\ntheatre--maybe two. Some folk, I presoom, can afford it. \'Seems\r\ndownright waste to me. . . . Naow, how in Jerusalem did Cap. Bart\r\nEdwardes strike adrift here?"\r\n\r\n"No keepin\' him under," said an Eastport man behind. "He\'s a poet, an\'\r\nhe\'s baound to say his piece. \'Comes from daown aour way, too."\r\n\r\nHe did not say that Captain B. Edwardes had striven for five\r\nconsecutive years to be allowed to recite a piece of his own\r\ncomposition on Gloucester Memorial Day. An amused and exhausted\r\ncommittee had at last given him his desire. The simplicity and utter\r\nhappiness of the old man, as he stood up in his very best Sunday\r\nclothes, won the audience ere he opened his mouth. They sat unmurmuring\r\nthrough seven-and-thirty hatchet-made verses describing at fullest\r\nlength the loss of the schooner _Joan Hasken_ off the Georges in the gale\r\nof 1867, and when he came to an end they shouted with one kindly throat.\r\n\r\nA far-sighted Boston reporter slid away for a full copy of the epic and\r\nan interview with the author; so that earth had nothing more to offer\r\nCaptain Bart Edwardes, ex-whaler, shipwright, master-fisherman, and\r\npoet, in the seventy-third year of his age.\r\n\r\n"Naow, I call that sensible," said the Eastport man. "I\'ve bin over\r\nthat graound with his writin\', jest as he read it, in my two hands, and\r\nI can testify that he\'s got it all in."\r\n\r\n"If Dan here couldn\'t do better\'n that with one hand before breakfast,\r\nhe ought to be switched," said Salters, upholding the honor of\r\nMassachusetts on general principles. "Not but what I\'m free to own he\'s\r\nconsiderable litt\'ery--fer Maine. Still--"\r\n\r\n"Guess Uncle Salters\'s goin\' to die this trip. Fust compliment he\'s\r\never paid me," Dan sniggered. "What\'s wrong with you, Harve? You act\r\nall quiet and you look greenish. Feelin\' sick?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know what\'s the matter with me," Harvey implied. "Seems if my\r\ninsides were too big for my outsides. I\'m all crowded up and shivery."\r\n\r\n"Dispepsy? Pshaw--too bad. We\'ll wait for the readin\', an\' then we\'ll\r\nquit, an\' catch the tide."\r\n\r\nThe widows--they were nearly all of that season\'s making--braced\r\nthemselves rigidly like people going to be shot in cold blood, for they\r\nknew what was coming. The summer-boarder girls in pink and blue\r\nshirt-waists stopped tittering over Captain Edwardes\'s wonderful poem,\r\nand looked back to see why all was silent. The fishermen pressed\r\nforward as that town official who had talked to Cheyne bobbed up on the\r\nplatform and began to read the year\'s list of losses, dividing them\r\ninto months. Last September\'s casualties were mostly single men and\r\nstrangers, but his voice rang very loud in the stillness of the hall.\r\n\r\n"September 9th. Schooner _Florrie Anderson_ lost, with all aboard, off\r\nthe Georges.\r\n\r\n"Reuben Pitman, master, 50, single, Main Street, City.\r\n\r\n"Emil Olsen, 19, single, 329 Hammond Street, City. Denmark.\r\n\r\n"Oscar Standberg, single, 25. Sweden.\r\n\r\n"Carl Stanberg, single, 28, Main Street. City.\r\n\r\n"Pedro, supposed Madeira, single, Keene\'s boardinghouse. City.\r\n\r\n"Joseph Welsh, alias Joseph Wright, 30, St. John\'s, Newfoundland."\r\n\r\n"No--Augusty, Maine," a voice cried from the body of the hall.\r\n\r\n"He shipped from St. John\'s," said the reader, looking to see.\r\n\r\n"I know it. He belongs in Augusty. My nevvy."\r\n\r\nThe reader made a pencilled correction on the margin of the list, and\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n"Same schooner, Charlie Ritchie, Liverpool, Nova Scotia, 33, single.\r\n\r\n"Albert May, 267 Rogers Street, City, 27, single.\r\n\r\n"September 27th.--Orvin Dollard, 30, married, drowned in dory off\r\nEastern Point."\r\n\r\nThat shot went home, for one of the widows flinched where she sat,\r\nclasping and unclasping her hands. Mrs. Cheyne, who had been listening\r\nwith wide-opened eyes, threw up her head and choked. Dan\'s mother, a\r\nfew seats to the right, saw and heard and quickly moved to her side.\r\nThe reading went on. By the time they reached the January and February\r\nwrecks the shots were falling thick and fast, and the widows drew\r\nbreath between their teeth.\r\n\r\n"February 14th.--Schooner _Harry Randolph_ dismasted on the way home from\r\nNewfoundland; Asa Musie, married, 32, Main Street, City, lost overboard.\r\n\r\n"February 23d.--Schooner _Gilbert Hope_; went astray in dory, Robert\r\nBeavon, 29, married, native of Pubnico, Nova Scotia."\r\n\r\nBut his wife was in the hall. They heard a low cry, as though a little\r\nanimal had been hit. It was stifled at once, and a girl staggered out\r\nof the hall. She had been hoping against hope for months, because some\r\nwho have gone adrift in dories have been miraculously picked up by\r\ndeep-sea sailing-ships. Now she had her certainty, and Harvey could see\r\nthe policeman on the sidewalk hailing a hack for her. "It\'s fifty cents\r\nto the depot"--the driver began, but the policeman held up his\r\nhand--"but I\'m goin\' there anyway. Jump right in. Look at here, Al; you\r\ndon\'t pull me next time my lamps ain\'t lit. See?"\r\n\r\nThe side-door closed on the patch of bright sunshine, and Harvey\'s eyes\r\nturned again to the reader and his endless list.\r\n\r\n"April 19th.--Schooner _Mamie Douglas_ lost on the Banks with all hands.\r\n\r\n"Edward Canton, 43, master, married, City.\r\n\r\n"D. Hawkins, alias Williams, 34, married, Shelbourne, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n"G. W. Clay, coloured, 28, married, City."\r\n\r\nAnd so on, and so on. Great lumps were rising in Harvey\'s throat, and\r\nhis stomach reminded him of the day when he fell from the liner.\r\n\r\n"May 10th.--Schooner _We\'re Here_ [the blood tingled all over him] Otto\r\nSvendson, 20, single, City, lost overboard."\r\n\r\nOnce more a low, tearing cry from somewhere at the back of the hall.\r\n\r\n"She shouldn\'t ha\' come. She shouldn\'t ha\' come," said Long Jack, with\r\na cluck of pity.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t scrowge, Harve," grunted Dan. Harvey heard that much, but the\r\nrest was all darkness spotted with fiery wheels. Disko leaned forward\r\nand spoke to his wife, where she sat with one arm round Mrs. Cheyne,\r\nand the other holding down the snatching, catching, ringed hands.\r\n\r\n"Lean your head daown--right daown!" he whispered. "It\'ll go off in a\r\nminute."\r\n\r\n"I ca-an\'t! I do-don\'t! Oh, let me--" Mrs. Cheyne did not at all know\r\nwhat she said.\r\n\r\n"You must," Mrs. Troop repeated. "Your boy\'s jest fainted dead away.\r\nThey do that some when they\'re gettin\' their growth. \'Wish to tend to\r\nhim? We can git aout this side. Quite quiet. You come right along with\r\nme. Psha\', my dear, we\'re both women, I guess. We must tend to aour\r\nmen-folk. Come!"\r\n\r\nThe _We\'re Heres_ promptly went through the crowd as a body-guard, and\r\nit was a very white and shaken Harvey that they propped up on a bench\r\nin an anteroom.\r\n\r\n"Favours his ma," was Mrs. Troop\'s only comment, as the mother bent\r\nover her boy.\r\n\r\n"How d\'you suppose he could ever stand it?" she cried indignantly to\r\nCheyne, who had said nothing at all. "It was horrible--horrible! We\r\nshouldn\'t have come. It\'s wrong and wicked! It--it isn\'t right!\r\nWhy--why couldn\'t they put these things in the papers, where they\r\nbelong? Are you better, darling?"\r\n\r\nThat made Harvey very properly ashamed. "Oh, I\'m all right, I guess,"\r\nhe said, struggling to his feet, with a broken giggle. "Must ha\' been\r\nsomething I ate for breakfast."\r\n\r\n"Coffee, perhaps," said Cheyne, whose face was all in hard lines, as\r\nthough it had been cut out of bronze. "We won\'t go back again."\r\n\r\n"Guess \'twould be \'baout\'s well to git daown to the wharf," said Disko.\r\n"It\'s close in along with them Dagoes, an\' the fresh air will fresh\r\nMrs. Cheyne up."\r\n\r\nHarvey announced that he never felt better in his life; but it was not\r\ntill he saw the _We\'re Here_, fresh from the lumper\'s hands, at\r\nWouverman\'s wharf, that he lost his all-overish feelings in a queer\r\nmixture of pride and sorrowfulness. Other people--summer boarders and\r\nsuch-like--played about in cat-boats or looked at the sea from\r\npier-heads; but he understood things from the inside--more things than\r\nhe could begin to think about. None the less, he could have sat down\r\nand howled because the little schooner was going off. Mrs. Cheyne\r\nsimply cried and cried every step of the way and said most\r\nextraordinary things to Mrs. Troop, who "babied" her till Dan, who had\r\nnot been "babied" since he was six, whistled aloud.\r\n\r\nAnd so the old crowd--Harvey felt like the most ancient of mariners\r\ndropped into the old schooner among the battered dories, while Harvey\r\nslipped the stern-fast from the pier-head, and they slid her along the\r\nwharf-side with their hands. Every one wanted to say so much that no\r\none said anything in particular. Harvey bade Dan take care of Uncle\r\nSalters\'s sea-boots and Penn\'s dory-anchor, and Long Jack entreated\r\nHarvey to remember his lessons in seamanship; but the jokes fell flat\r\nin the presence of the two women, and it is hard to be funny with green\r\nharbour-water widening between good friends.\r\n\r\n"Up jib and fores\'l!" shouted Disko, getting to the wheel, as the wind\r\ntook her. "See you later, Harve. Dunno but I come near thinkin\' a heap\r\no\' you an\' your folks."\r\n\r\nThen she glided beyond ear-shot, and they sat down to watch her up the\r\nharbour, And still Mrs. Cheyne wept.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw, my dear," said Mrs. Troop: "we\'re both women, I guess. Like\'s\r\nnot it\'ll ease your heart to hev your cry aout. God He knows it never\r\ndone me a mite o\' good, but then He knows I\'ve had something to cry\r\nfer!"\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it was a few years later, and upon the other edge of America, that\r\na young man came through the clammy sea fog up a windy street which is\r\nflanked with most expensive houses built of wood to imitate stone. To\r\nhim, as he was standing by a hammered iron gate, entered on\r\nhorseback--and the horse would have been cheap at a thousand\r\ndollars--another young man. And this is what they said:\r\n\r\n"Hello, Dan!"\r\n\r\n"Hello, Harve!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the best with you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m so\'s to be that kind o\' animal called second mate this trip.\r\nAin\'t you most through with that triple invoiced college of yours?"\r\n\r\n"Getting that way. I tell you, the Leland Stanford Junior, isn\'t a\r\ncircumstance to the old _We\'re Here_; but I\'m coming into the business\r\nfor keeps next fall."\r\n\r\n"Meanin\' aour packets?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing else. You just wait till I get my knife into you, Dan. I\'m\r\ngoing to make the old line lie down and cry when I take hold."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll resk it," said Dan, with a brotherly grin, as Harvey dismounted\r\nand asked whether he were coming in.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I took the cable fer; but, say, is the doctor anywheres\r\naraound? I\'ll draown that crazy nigger some day, his one cussed joke\r\nan\' all."\r\n\r\nThere was a low, triumphant chuckle, as the ex-cook of the _We\'re Here_\r\ncame out of the fog to take the horse\'s bridle. He allowed no one but\r\nhimself to attend to any of Harvey\'s wants.\r\n\r\n"Thick as the Banks, ain\'t it, doctor?" said Dan, propitiatingly.\r\n\r\nBut the coal-black Celt with the second-sight did not see fit to reply\r\ntill he had tapped Dan on the shoulder, and for the twentieth time\r\ncroaked the old, old prophecy in his ear.\r\n\r\n"Master--man. Man--master," said he. "You remember, Dan Troop, what I\r\nsaid? On the _We\'re Here_?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I won\'t go so far as to deny that it do look like it as things\r\nstand at present," said Dan. "She was a noble packet, and one way an\'\r\nanother I owe her a heap--her and Dad."\r\n\r\n"Me too," quoth Harvey Cheyne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s "Captains Courageous", by Rudyard Kipling\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK "CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS" ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2186.txt or 2186.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/8/2186/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Reed and Bill Stoddard.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
