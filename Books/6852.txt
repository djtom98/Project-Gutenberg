He studied jurisprudence at Prague and Graz, and in\r\n1857 became a teacher at the latter university. He published several\r\nhistorical works, but soon gave up his academic career to devote\r\nhimself wholly to literature. For a number of years he edited the\r\ninternational review, _Auf der H\xc3\xb6he_, at Leipzig, but later removed to\r\nParis, for he was always strongly Francophile. His last years he spent\r\nat Lindheim in Hesse, Germany, where he died on March 9, 1895. In 1873\r\nhe married Aurora von Rumelin, who wrote a number of novels under the\r\npseudonym of Wanda von Dunajew, which it is interesting to note is the\r\nname of the heroine of _Venus in Furs_. Her sensational memoirs which\r\nhave been the cause of considerable controversy were published in 1906.\r\n\r\nDuring his career as writer an endless number of works poured from\r\nSacher-Masoch\xe2\x80\x99s pen. Many of these were works of ephemeral journalism,\r\nand some of them unfortunately pure sensationalism, for economic\r\nnecessity forced him to turn his pen to unworthy ends.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a residue among his works which has a distinct\r\nliterary and even greater psychological value. His principal literary\r\nambition was never completely fulfilled. It was a somewhat programmatic\r\nplan to give a picture of contemporary life in all its various aspects\r\nand interrelations under the general title of the _Heritage of Cain_.\r\nThis idea was probably derived from Balzac\xe2\x80\x99s _Comedie Humaine_. The\r\nwhole was to be divided into six subdivisions with the general titles\r\n_Love, Property, Money, The State, War,_ and _Death_. Each of these\r\ndivisions in its turn consisted of six novels, of which the last was\r\nintended to summarize the author\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions and to present his\r\nsolution for the problems set in the others.\r\n\r\nThis extensive plan remained unachieved, and only the first two parts,\r\n_Love_ and _Property_, were completed. Of the other sections only\r\nfragments remain. The present novel, _Venus in Furs_, forms the fifth\r\nin the series, _Love_.\r\n\r\nThe best of Sacher-Masoch\xe2\x80\x99s work is characterized by a swift narration\r\nand a graphic representation of character and scene and a rich humor.\r\nThe latter has made many of his shorter stories dealing with his native\r\nGalicia little masterpieces of local color.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another element in his work which has caused his\r\nname to become as eponym for an entire series of phenomena at one end\r\nof the psycho-sexual scale. This gives his productions a peculiar\r\npsychological value, though it cannot be denied also a morbid tinge\r\nthat makes them often repellent. However, it is well to remember that\r\nnature is neither good nor bad, neither altruistic nor egoistic, and\r\nthat it operates through the human psyche as well as through crystals\r\nand plants and animals with the same inexorable laws.\r\n\r\nSacher-Masoch was the poet of the anomaly now generally known as\r\n_masochism_. By this is meant the desire on the part of the individual\r\naffected of desiring himself completely and unconditionally subject to\r\nthe will of a person of the opposite sex, and being treated by this\r\nperson as by a master, to be humiliated, abused, and tormented, even to\r\nthe verge of death. This motive is treated in all its innumerable\r\nvariations. As a creative artist Sacher-Masoch was, of course, on the\r\nquest for the absolute, and sometimes, when impulses in the human being\r\nassume an abnormal or exaggerated form, there is just for a moment a\r\nflash that gives a glimpse of the thing in itself.\r\n\r\nIf any defense were needed for the publication of work like\r\nSacher-Masoch\xe2\x80\x99s it is well to remember that artists are the historians\r\nof the human soul and one might recall the wise and tolerant\r\nMontaigne\xe2\x80\x99s essay _On the Duty of Historians_ where he says, \xe2\x80\x9cOne may\r\ncover over secret actions, but to be silent on what all the world\r\nknows, and things which have had effects which are public and of so\r\nmuch consequence is an inexcusable defect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the curious interrelation between cruelty and sex, again and again,\r\ncreeps into literature. Sacher-Masoch has not created anything new in\r\nthis. He has simply taken an ancient motive and developed it frankly\r\nand consciously, until, it seems, there is nothing further to say on\r\nthe subject. To the violent attacks which his books met he replied in a\r\npolemical work, _\xc3\x9cber den Wert der Kritik_.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to trace the masochistic tendency as it occurs\r\nthroughout literature, but no more can be done than just to allude to a\r\nfew instances. The theme recurs continually in the _Confessions_ of\r\nJean Jacques Rousseau; it explains the character of the chevalier in\r\nPr\xc3\xa9vost\xe2\x80\x99s _Manon l\xe2\x80\x99Escault_. Scenes of this nature are found in Zola\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Nana_, in Thomas Otway\xe2\x80\x99s _Venice Preserved_, in Albert Juhelle\xe2\x80\x99s _Les\r\nPecheurs d\xe2\x80\x99Hommes_, in Dostojevski. In disguised and unrecognized form\r\nit constitutes the undercurrent of much of the sentimental literature\r\nof the present day, though in most cases the authors as well as the\r\nreaders are unaware of the pathological elements out of which their\r\ncharacters are built.\r\n\r\nIn all these strange and troubled waters of the human spirit one might\r\nwish for something of the serene and simple attitude of the ancient\r\nworld. Laurent Tailhade has an admirable passage in his _Platres et\r\nMarbres_, which is well worth reproducing in this connection:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToutefois, les Hell\xc3\xa8nes, dans, leurs cit\xc3\xa9s de lumi\xc3\xa8re, de douceur et\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99harmonie, avaient une indulgence qu\xe2\x80\x99on peut nommer scientifique pour\r\nles troubles amoureux de l\xe2\x80\x99esprit. S\xe2\x80\x99ils ne regardaient pas l\xe2\x80\x99ali\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9\r\ncomme en proie a la visitation d\xe2\x80\x99un dieu (id\xc3\xa9e orientale et fataliste),\r\ndu moins ils savaient que l\xe2\x80\x99amour est une sorte d\xe2\x80\x99envo\xc3\xbbtement, une\r\nfolie o\xc3\xb9 se manifeste l\xe2\x80\x99animosit\xc3\xa9 des puissances cosmiques. Plus tard,\r\nle christianisme enveloppa les \xc3\xa2mes de t\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa8bres. Ce fut la grande nuit.\r\nL\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\x89glise condamna tout ce qui lui par\xc3\xbbt neuf ou mena\xc3\xa7ant pour les\r\ndogmes impla\xc3\xa7able qui reduisaient le monde en esclavage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmong Sacher-Masoch\xe2\x80\x99s works, _Venus in Furs_ is one of the most typical\r\nand outstanding. In spite of melodramatic elements and other literary\r\nfaults, it is unquestionably a sincere work, written without any idea\r\nof titillating morbid fancies. One feels that in the hero many\r\nsubjective elements have been incorporated, which are a disadvantage to\r\nthe work from the point of view of literature, but on the other hand\r\nraise the book beyond the sphere of art, pure and simple, and make it\r\none of those appalling human documents which belong, part to science\r\nand part to psychology. It is the confession of a deeply unhappy man\r\nwho could not master his personal tragedy of existence, and so sought\r\nto unburden his soul in writing down the things he felt and\r\nexperienced. The reader who will approach the book from this angle and\r\nwho will honestly put aside moral prejudices and prepossessions will\r\ncome away from the perusal of this book with a deeper understanding of\r\nthis poor miserable soul of ours and a light will be cast into dark\r\nplaces that lie latent in all of us.\r\n\r\nSacher-Masoch\xe2\x80\x99s works have held an established position in European\r\nletters for something like half a century, and the author himself was\r\nmade a chevalier of the Legion of Honor by the French Government in\r\n1883, on the occasion of his literary jubilee. When several years ago\r\ncheap reprints were brought out on the Continent and attempts were made\r\nby various guardians of morality\xe2\x80\x94they exist in all countries \xe2\x80\x94to have\r\nthem suppressed, the judicial decisions were invariably against the\r\nplaintiff and in favor of the publisher. Are Americans children that\r\nthey must be protected from books which any European school-boy can\r\npurchase whenever he wishes? However, such seems to be the case, and\r\nthis translation, which has long been in preparation, consequently\r\nappears in a limited edition printed for subscribers only. In another\r\nconnection Herbert Spencer once used these words: \xe2\x80\x9cThe ultimate result\r\nof shielding men from the effects of folly, is to fill the world with\r\nfools.\xe2\x80\x9d They have a very pointed application in the case of a work like\r\n_Venus in Furs_.\r\n\r\nF. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtlantic City\r\nApril, 1921\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUS IN FURS\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cBut the Almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into\r\nthe hands of a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The Vulgate, Judith, xvi. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy company was charming.\r\n\r\nOpposite me by the massive Renaissance fireplace sat Venus; she was not\r\na casual woman of the half-world, who under this pseudonym wages war\r\nagainst the enemy sex, like Mademoiselle Cleopatra, but the real, true\r\ngoddess of love.\r\n\r\nShe sat in an armchair and had kindled a crackling fire, whose\r\nreflection ran in red flames over her pale face with its white eyes,\r\nand from time to time over her feet when she sought to warm them.\r\n\r\nHer head was wonderful in spite of the dead stony eyes; it was all I\r\ncould see of her. She had wrapped her marble-like body in a huge fur,\r\nand rolled herself up trembling like a cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t really cold any longer.\r\nFor two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather. You must be\r\nnervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch obliged for your spring,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with a low stony voice, and\r\nimmediately afterwards sneezed divinely, twice in succession. \xe2\x80\x9cI really\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stand it here much longer, and I am beginning to understand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, dear lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the\r\nun-understandable. All of a sudden I understand the Germanic virtue of\r\nwoman, and German philosophy, and I am no longer surprised that you of\r\nthe North do not know how to love, haven\xe2\x80\x99t even an idea of what love\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied flaring up, \xe2\x80\x9cI surely haven\xe2\x80\x99t given you any\r\nreason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The divinity sneezed for the third time, and shrugged her\r\nshoulders with inimitable grace. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I have always been nice to\r\nyou, and even come to see you now and then, although I catch a cold\r\nevery time, in spite of all my furs. Do you remember the first time we\r\nmet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I forget it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wore your abundant hair in brown\r\ncurls, and you had brown eyes and a red mouth, but I recognized you\r\nimmediately by the outline of your face and its marble-like pallor\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nalways wore a violet-blue velvet jacket edged with squirrel-skin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were really in love with the costume, and awfully docile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have taught me what love is. Your serene form of worship let me\r\nforget two thousand years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my faithfulness to you was without equal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as far as faithfulness goes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUngrateful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not reproach you with anything. You are a divine woman, but\r\nnevertheless a woman, and like every woman cruel in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you call cruel,\xe2\x80\x9d the goddess of love replied eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cis simply\r\nthe element of passion and of natural love, which is woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature and\r\nmakes her give herself where she loves, and makes her love everything,\r\nthat pleases her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan there be any greater cruelty for a lover than the unfaithfulness\r\nof the woman he loves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are faithful as long as we love, but you\r\ndemand faithfulness of a woman without love, and the giving of herself\r\nwithout enjoyment. Who is cruel there\xe2\x80\x94woman or man? You of the North in\r\ngeneral take love too soberly and seriously. You talk of duties where\r\nthere should be only a question of pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous, and our relations\r\npermanent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet a restless, always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of\r\npaganism,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that love, which is the highest joy,\r\nwhich is divine simplicity itself, is not for you moderns, you children\r\nof reflection. It works only evil in you. _As soon as you wish to be\r\nnatural, you become common._ To you nature seems something hostile; you\r\nhave made devils out of the smiling gods of Greece, and out of me a\r\ndemon. You can only exorcise and curse me, or slay yourselves in\r\nbacchantic madness before my altar. And if ever one of you has had the\r\ncourage to kiss my red mouth, he makes a barefoot pilgrimage to Rome in\r\npenitential robes and expects flowers to grow from his withered staff,\r\nwhile under my feet roses, violets, and myrtles spring up every hour,\r\nbut their fragrance does not agree with you. Stay among your northern\r\nfogs and Christian incense; let us pagans remain under the debris,\r\nbeneath the lava; do not disinter us. Pompeii was not built for you,\r\nnor our villas, our baths, our temples. You do not require gods. We are\r\nchilled in your world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe beautiful marble woman coughed, and drew the dark sables still\r\ncloser about her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch obliged for the classical lesson,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you cannot\r\ndeny, that man and woman are mortal enemies, in your serene sunlit\r\nworld as well as in our foggy one. In love there is union into a single\r\nbeing for a short time only, capable of only one thought, one\r\nsensation, one will, in order to be then further disunited. And you\r\nknow this better than I; whichever of the two fails to subjugate will\r\nsoon feel the feet of the other on his neck\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as a rule the man that of the woman,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Venus with\r\nproud mockery, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich you know better than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, and that is why I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any illusions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you are now my slave without illusions, and for that reason\r\nyou shall feel the weight of my foot without mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know me yet? Yes, I am _cruel_\xe2\x80\x94since you take so much\r\ndelight in that word-and am I not entitled to be so? Man is the one who\r\ndesires, woman the one who is desired. This is woman\xe2\x80\x99s entire but\r\ndecisive advantage. Through his passion nature has given man into\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and the woman who does not know how to make him her\r\nsubject, her slave, her toy, and how to betray him with a smile in the\r\nend is not wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly your principles,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are based on the experience of thousands of years,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied\r\nironically, while her white fingers played over the dark fur. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more\r\ndevoted a woman shows herself, the sooner the man sobers down and\r\nbecomes domineering. The more cruelly she treats him and the more\r\nfaithless she is, the worse she uses him, the more wantonly she plays\r\nwith him, the less pity she shows him, by so much the more will she\r\nincrease his desire, be loved, worshipped by him. So it has always\r\nbeen, since the time of Helen and Delilah, down to Catherine the Second\r\nand Lola Montez.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot deny,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat nothing will attract a man more than the\r\npicture of a beautiful, passionate, cruel, and despotic woman who\r\nwantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with her\r\nwhim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in addition wears furs,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the divinity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know your predilection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, since we last saw each other, you\r\nhave grown very coquettish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greater\r\nadvantage than by these dark furs, and that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe divinity laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are dreaming,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwake up!\xe2\x80\x9d and she clasped my arm with\r\nher marble-white hand. \xe2\x80\x9cDo wake up,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated raucously with the\r\nlow register of her voice. I opened my eyes with difficulty.\r\n\r\nI saw the hand which shook me, and suddenly it was brown as bronze; the\r\nvoice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant who stood\r\nbefore me at his full height of nearly six feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo get up,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the good fellow, \xe2\x80\x9cit is really disgraceful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is disgraceful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides.\xe2\x80\x9d He snuffed\r\nthe candles which had burned down, and picked up the volume which had\r\nfallen from my hand, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a book by\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he looked at the title page\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cby\r\nHegel. Besides it is high time you were starting for Mr. Severin\xe2\x80\x99s who\r\nis expecting us for tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA curious dream,\xe2\x80\x9d said Severin when I had finished. He supported his\r\narms on his knees, resting his face in his delicate, finely veined\r\nhands, and fell to pondering.\r\n\r\nI knew that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t move for a long time, hardly even breathe. This\r\nactually happened, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t consider his behavior as in any way\r\nremarkable. I had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearly\r\nthree years, and gotten used to his peculiarities. For it cannot be\r\ndenied that he was peculiar, although he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite the dangerous\r\nmadman that the neighborhood, or indeed the entire district of Kolomea,\r\nconsidered him to be. I found his personality not only interesting\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthat is why many also regarded me a bit mad\xe2\x80\x94but to a degree\r\nsympathetic. For a Galician nobleman and land-owner, and considering\r\nhis age\xe2\x80\x94he was hardly over thirty\xe2\x80\x94he displayed surprising sobriety, a\r\ncertain seriousness, even pedantry. He lived according to a minutely\r\nelaborated, half-philosophical, half-practical system, like clock-work;\r\nnot this alone, but also by the thermometer, barometer, aerometer,\r\nhydrometer, Hippocrates, Hufeland, Plato, Kant, Knigge, and Lord\r\nChesterfield. But at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion,\r\nand gave the impression of being about to run with his head right\r\nthrough a wall. At such times every one preferred to get out of his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWhile he remained silent, the fire sang in the chimney and the large\r\nvenerable samovar sang; and the ancient chair in which I sat rocking to\r\nand fro smoking my cigar, and the cricket in the old walls sang too. I\r\nlet my eyes glide over the curious apparatus, skeletons of animals,\r\nstuffed birds, globes, plaster-casts, with which his room was heaped\r\nfull, until by chance my glance remained fixed on a picture which I had\r\nseen often enough before. But to-day, under the reflected red glow of\r\nthe fire, it made an indescribable impression on me.\r\n\r\nIt was a large oil painting, done in the robust full-bodied manner of\r\nthe Belgian school. Its subject was strange enough.\r\n\r\nA beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face, with abundant\r\nhair tied into a classical knot, on which white powder lay like a soft\r\nhoarfrost, was resting on an ottoman, supported on her left arm. She\r\nwas nude in her dark furs. Her right hand played with a lash, while her\r\nbare foot rested carelessly on a man, lying before her like a slave,\r\nlike a dog. In the sharply outlined, but well-formed linaments of this\r\nman lay brooding melancholy and passionate devotion; he looked up to\r\nher with the ecstatic burning eye of a martyr. This man, the footstool\r\nfor her feet, was Severin, but beardless, and, it seemed, some ten\r\nyears younger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Venus in Furs_,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, pointing to the picture. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the way I\r\nsaw her in my dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Severin, \xe2\x80\x9conly I dreamed my dream with open eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a tiresome story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour picture apparently suggested my dream,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued. \xe2\x80\x9cBut do tell\r\nme what it means. I can imagine that it played a role in your life, and\r\nperhaps a very decisive one. But the details I can only get from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at its counterpart,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my strange friend, without heeding\r\nmy question.\r\n\r\nThe counterpart was an excellent copy of Titian\xe2\x80\x99s well-known \xe2\x80\x9cVenus\r\nwith the Mirror\xe2\x80\x9d in the Dresden Gallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the significance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeverin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with which Titian\r\ngarbed his goddess of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt, too, is a \xe2\x80\x98Venus in Furs,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a slight smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve that the old Venetian had any secondary intention. He simply\r\npainted the portrait of some aristocratic Mesalina, and was tactful\r\nenough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her majestic\r\nallure with cold satisfaction. He looks as though his task were\r\nbecoming burdensome enough. The picture is painted flattery. Later an\r\n\xe2\x80\x98expert\xe2\x80\x99 in the Rococo period baptized the lady with the name of Venus.\r\nThe furs of the despot in which Titian\xe2\x80\x99s fair model wrapped herself,\r\nprobably more for fear of a cold than out of modesty, have become a\r\nsymbol of the tyranny and cruelty that constitute woman\xe2\x80\x99s essence and\r\nher beauty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut enough of that. The picture, as it now exists, is a bitter satire\r\non our love. Venus in this abstract North, in this icy Christian world,\r\nhas to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch cold\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeverin laughed, and lighted a fresh cigarette.\r\n\r\nJust then the door opened and an attractive, stoutish, blonde girl\r\nentered. She had wise, kindly eyes, was dressed in black silk, and\r\nbrought us cold meat and eggs with our tea. Severin took one of the\r\nlatter, and decapitated it with his knife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you that I want them soft-boiled?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried with a\r\nviolence that made the young woman tremble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my dear Sevtchu\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she said timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSevtchu, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he yelled, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are to obey, obey, do you\r\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x9d and he tore the _kantchuk_1 which was hanging beside the\r\nweapons from its hook.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A long whip with a short handle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust wait, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he called after her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Severin,\xe2\x80\x9d I said placing my hand on his arm, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you treat a\r\npretty young woman thus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, blinking humorously with his eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad I flattered her, she would have cast the noose around my neck, but\r\nnow, when I bring her up with the _kantchuk_, she adores me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, nothing, that is the way you have to break in women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you like it, live like a pasha in your harem, but don\xe2\x80\x99t lay\r\ndown theories for me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said animatedly. \xe2\x80\x9cGoethe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98you must be hammer or anvil\xe2\x80\x99\r\nis absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nLady Venus in your dream prove that to you? Woman\xe2\x80\x99s power lies in man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npassion, and she knows how to use it, if man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nhimself. He has only one choice: to be the _tyrant_ over or the _slave_\r\nof woman. As soon as he gives in, his neck is under the yoke, and the\r\nlash will soon fall upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange maxims!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot maxims, but experiences,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, nodding his head, \xe2\x80\x9c_I have\r\nactually felt the lash_. I am cured. Do you care to know how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose, and got a small manuscript from his massive desk, and put it\r\nin front of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have already asked about the picture. I have long owed you an\r\nexplanation. Here\xe2\x80\x94read!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeverin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me, and seemed to\r\ndream with open eyes. Silence had fallen again, and again the fire sang\r\nin the chimney, and the samovar and the cricket in the old walls. I\r\nopened the manuscript and read:\r\n\r\nCONFESSIONS OF A SUPERSENSUAL MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the\r\nwell-known lines from _Faust_:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou supersensual sensual wooer\r\nA woman leads you by the nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x94MEPHISTOPHELES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI turned the title-page and read: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat follows has been compiled from\r\nmy diary of that period, because it is impossible ever frankly to write\r\nof one\xe2\x80\x99s past, but in this way everything retains its fresh colors, the\r\ncolors of the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGogol, the Russian Moli\xc3\xa8re, says\xe2\x80\x94where? well, somewhere\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe real comic\r\nmuse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA wonderful saying.\r\n\r\nSo I have a very curious feeling as I am writing all this down. The\r\natmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers, which\r\novercomes me and gives me a headache. The smoke of the fireplace curls\r\nand condenses into figures, small gray-bearded kokolds that mockingly\r\npoint their finger at me. Chubby-cheeked cupids ride on the arms of my\r\nchair and on my knees. I have to smile involuntarily, even laugh aloud,\r\nas I am writing down my adventures. Yet I am not writing with ordinary\r\nink, but with red blood that drips from my heart. All its wounds long\r\nscarred over have opened and it throbs and hurts, and now and then a\r\ntear falls on the paper.\r\n\r\nThe days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort.\r\nYou see no one, and no one sees you. It is boring enough to write\r\nidyls. I would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of\r\npaintings, furnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season, a\r\ndozen virtuosos with concertos, trios, and duos, but\xe2\x80\x94what am I\r\nsaying\xe2\x80\x94the upshot of it all is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t do much more than to\r\nstretch the canvas, smooth the bow, line the scores. For I am\xe2\x80\x94no false\r\nmodesty, Friend Severin; you can lie to others, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t quite\r\nsucceed any longer in lying to yourself\xe2\x80\x94I am nothing but a dilettante,\r\na dilettante in painting, in poetry, in music, and several other of the\r\nso-called unprofitable arts, which, however, at present secure for\r\ntheir masters the income of a cabinet minister, or even that of a minor\r\npotentate. Above all else I am a dilettante in life.\r\n\r\nUp to the present I have lived as I have painted and written poetry. I\r\nnever got far beyond the preparation, the plan, the first act, the\r\nfirst stanza. There are people like that who begin everything, and\r\nnever finish anything. I am such a one.\r\n\r\nBut what am I saying?\r\n\r\nTo the business in hand.\r\n\r\nI lie in my window, and the miserable little town, which fills me with\r\ndespondency, really seems infinitely full of poetry. How wonderful the\r\noutlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven with golden\r\nsunlight; mountain-torrents weave through them like ribbons of silver!\r\nHow clear and blue the heavens into which snowcapped crags project; how\r\ngreen and fresh the forested slopes; the meadows on which small herds\r\ngraze, down to the yellow billows of grain where reapers stand and bend\r\nover and rise up again.\r\n\r\nThe house in which I live stands in a sort of park, or forest, or\r\nwilderness, whatever one wants to call it, and is very solitary.\r\n\r\nIts sole inhabitants are myself, a widow from Lemberg, and Madame\r\nTartakovska, who runs the house, a little old woman, who grows older\r\nand smaller each day. There are also an old dog that limps on one leg,\r\nand a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn. This ball\r\nof yarn, I believe, belongs to the widow.\r\n\r\nShe is said to be really beautiful, this widow, still very young,\r\ntwenty-four at the most, and very rich. She dwells in the first story,\r\nand I on the ground floor. She always keeps the green blinds drawn, and\r\nhas a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbing-plants. I for my\r\npart down below have a comfortable, intimate arbor of honeysuckle, in\r\nwhich I read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs.\r\nI can look up on the balcony. Sometimes I actually do so, and then from\r\ntime to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network.\r\n\r\nReally the beautiful woman up there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interest me very much, for\r\nI am in love with someone else, and terribly unhappy at that; far more\r\nunhappy than the Knight of Toggenburg or the Chevalier in Manon\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99Escault, because the object of my adoration is of stone.\r\n\r\nIn the garden, in the tiny wilderness, there is a graceful little\r\nmeadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully. On this meadow is a\r\nstone statue of Venus, the original of which, I believe, is in\r\nFlorence. This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in\r\nall my life.\r\n\r\nThat, however, does not signify much, for I have seen few beautiful\r\nwomen, or rather few women at all. In love too, I am a dilettante who\r\nnever got beyond the preparation, the first act.\r\n\r\nBut why talk in superlatives, as if something that is beautiful could\r\nbe surpassed?\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to say that this Venus is beautiful. I love her\r\npassionately with a morbid intensity; madly as one can only love a\r\nwoman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally\r\nuniform, eternally calm, stony smile. I literally adore her.\r\n\r\nI often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when the\r\nsun broods over the forest. Often I visit that cold, cruel mistress of\r\nmine by night and lie on my knees before her, with the face pressed\r\nagainst the cold pedestal on which her feet rest, and my prayers go up\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nThe rising moon, which just now is waning, produces an indescribable\r\neffect. It seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow in\r\nits gleam of silver. The goddess stands as if transfigured, and seems\r\nto bathe in the soft moonlight.\r\n\r\nOnce when I was returning from my devotions by one of the walks leading\r\nto the house, I suddenly saw a woman\xe2\x80\x99s figure, white as stone, under\r\nthe illumination of the moon and separated from me merely by a screen\r\nof trees. It seemed as if the beautiful woman of marble had taken pity\r\non me, become alive, and followed me. I was seized by a nameless fear,\r\nmy heart threatened to burst, and instead\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nWell, I am a dilettante. As always, I broke down at the second stanza;\r\nrather, on the contrary, I did not break down, but ran away as fast as\r\nmy legs would carry me.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat an accident! Through a Jew, dealing in photographs I secured a\r\npicture of my ideal. It is a small reproduction of Titian\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cVenus with\r\nthe Mirror.\xe2\x80\x9d What a woman! I want to write a poem, but instead, I take\r\nthe reproduction, and write on it: _Venus in Furs_.\r\n\r\nYou are cold, while you yourself fan flames. By all means wrap yourself\r\nin your despotic furs, there is no one to whom they are more\r\nappropriate, cruel goddess of love and of beauty!\xe2\x80\x94After a while I add a\r\nfew verses from Goethe, which I recently found in his paralipomena to\r\n_Faust_.\r\n\r\nTO AMOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pair of wings a fiction are,\r\nThe arrows, they are naught but claws,\r\nThe wreath conceals the little horns,\r\nFor without any doubt he is\r\nLike all the gods of ancient Greece\r\nOnly a devil in disguise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I put the picture before me on my table, supporting it with a\r\nbook, and looked at it.\r\n\r\nI was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by the\r\ncold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms in\r\nher furs of dark sable; by the severity and hardness which lay in this\r\ncold marble-like face. Again I took my pen in hand, and wrote the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo love, to be loved, what happiness! And yet how the glamour of this\r\npales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping a woman\r\nwho makes a plaything out of us, of being the slave of a beautiful\r\ntyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot. Even Samson, the hero, the\r\ngiant, again put himself into the hands of Delilah, even after she had\r\nbetrayed him, and again she betrayed him, and the Philistines bound him\r\nand put out his eyes which until the very end he kept fixed, drunken\r\nwith rage and love, upon the beautiful betrayer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was breakfasting in my honey-suckle arbor, and reading in the Book of\r\nJudith. I envied the hero Holofernes because of the regal woman who cut\r\noff his head with a sword, and because of his beautiful sanguinary end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\r\nhands of a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis sentence strangely impressed me.\r\n\r\nHow ungallant these Jews are, I thought. And their God might choose\r\nmore becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sex.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\r\nhands of a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated to myself. What shall I do, so that He\r\nmay punish me?\r\n\r\nHeaven preserve us! Here comes the housekeeper, who has again\r\ndiminished somewhat in size overnight. And up there among the green\r\ntwinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again. Is it Venus, or\r\nthe widow?\r\n\r\nThis time it happens to be the widow, for Madame Tartakovska makes a\r\ncourtesy, and asks me in her name for something to read. I run to my\r\nroom, and gather together a couple of volumes.\r\n\r\nLater I remember that my picture of Venus is in one of them, and now it\r\nand my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up there together.\r\nWhat will she say?\r\n\r\nI hear her laugh.\r\n\r\nIs she laughing at me?\r\n\r\nIt is full moon. It is already peering over the tops of the low\r\nhemlocks that fringe the park. A silvery exhalation fills the terrace,\r\nthe groups of trees, all the landscape, as far as the eye can reach; in\r\nthe distance it gradually fades away, like trembling waters.\r\n\r\nI cannot resist. I feel a strange urge and call within me. I put on my\r\nclothes again and go out into the garden.\r\n\r\nSome power draws me toward the meadow, toward her, who is my divinity\r\nand my beloved.\r\n\r\nThe night is cool. I feel a slight chill. The atmosphere is heavy with\r\nthe odor of flowers and of the forest. It intoxicates.\r\n\r\nWhat solemnity! What music round about! A nightingale sobs. The stars\r\nquiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour. The meadow seems smooth,\r\nlike a mirror, like a covering of ice on a pond.\r\n\r\nThe statue of Venus stands out august and luminous.\r\n\r\nBut\xe2\x80\x94what has happened? From the marble shoulders of the goddess a large\r\ndark fur flows down to her heels. I stand dumbfounded and stare at her\r\nin amazement; again an indescribable fear seizes hold of me and I take\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nI hasten my steps, and notice that I have missed the main path. As I am\r\nabout to turn aside into one of the green walks I see Venus sitting\r\nbefore me on a stone bench, not the beautiful woman of marble, but the\r\ngoddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbing pulses. She has\r\nactually come to life for me, like the statue that began to breathe for\r\nher creator. Indeed, the miracle is only half completed. Her white hair\r\nseems still to be of stone, and her white gown shimmers like moonlight,\r\nor is it satin? From her shoulders the dark fur flows. But her lips are\r\nalready reddening and her cheeks begin to take color. Two diabolical\r\ngreen rays out of her eyes fall upon me, and now she laughs.\r\n\r\nHer laughter is very mysterious, very\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It cannot be\r\ndescribed, it takes my breath away. I flee further, and after every few\r\nsteps I have to pause to take breath. The mocking laughter pursues me\r\nthrough the dark leafy paths, across light open spaces, through the\r\nthicket where only single moonbeams can pierce. I can no longer find my\r\nway, I wander about utterly confused, with cold drops of perspiration\r\non the forehead.\r\n\r\nFinally I stand still, and engage in a short monologue.\r\n\r\nIt runs\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94one is either very polite to one\xe2\x80\x99s self or very rude.\r\n\r\nI say to myself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonkey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis word exercises a remarkable effect, like a magic formula, which\r\nsets me free and makes me master of myself.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly quiet in a moment.\r\n\r\nWith considerable pleasure I repeat: \xe2\x80\x9cDonkey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes again.\r\nThere is the fountain, there the alley of box-wood, there the house\r\nwhich I am slowly approaching.\r\n\r\nYet\xe2\x80\x94suddenly the appearance is here again. Behind the green screen\r\nthrough which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered with\r\nsilver, I again see the white figure, the woman of stone whom I adore,\r\nwhom I fear and flee.\r\n\r\nWith a couple of leaps I am within the house and catch my breath and\r\nreflect.\r\n\r\nWhat am I really, a little dilettante or a great big donkey?\r\n\r\nA sultry morning, the atmosphere is dead, heavily laden with odors, yet\r\nstimulating. Again I am sitting in my honey-suckle arbor, reading in\r\nthe Odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers into\r\nbeasts. A wonderful picture of antique love.\r\n\r\nThere is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my\r\nbook rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling.\r\n\r\nA woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nShe is there\xe2\x80\x94Venus\xe2\x80\x94but without furs\xe2\x80\x94No, this time it is merely the\r\nwidow\xe2\x80\x94and yet\xe2\x80\x94Venus-oh, what a woman!\r\n\r\nAs she stands there in her light white morning gown, looking at me, her\r\nslight figure seems full of poetry and grace. She is neither large, nor\r\nsmall; her head is alluring, piquant\xe2\x80\x94in the sense of the period of the\r\nFrench marquises\xe2\x80\x94rather than formally beautiful. What enchantment and\r\nsoftness, what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth! Her\r\nskin is so infinitely delicate, that the blue veins show through\r\neverywhere; even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom. How\r\nabundant her red hair-it is red, not blonde or golden-yellow\xe2\x80\x94how\r\ndiabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck! Now her eyes\r\nmeet mine like green lightnings\xe2\x80\x94they are green, these eyes of hers,\r\nwhose power is so indescribable\xe2\x80\x94green, but as are precious stones, or\r\ndeep unfathomable mountain lakes.\r\n\r\nShe observes my confusion, which has even made me discourteous, for I\r\nhave remained seated and still have my cap on my head.\r\n\r\nShe smiles roguishly.\r\n\r\nFinally I rise and bow to her. She comes closer, and bursts out into a\r\nloud, almost childlike laughter. I stammer, as only a little dilettante\r\nor great big donkey can do on such an occasion.\r\n\r\nThus our acquaintance began.\r\n\r\nThe divinity asks for my name, and mentions her own.\r\n\r\nHer name is Wanda von Dunajew.\r\n\r\nAnd she is actually my Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut madame, what put the idea into your head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little picture in one of your books\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe curious notes on its back\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy curious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always wanted to know a real dreamer some time\xe2\x80\x94for the sake of\r\nthe change\xe2\x80\x94and you seem one of the maddest of the tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear lady\xe2\x80\x94in fact\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Again I fell victim to an odious, asinine\r\nstammering, and in addition blushed in a way that might have been\r\nappropriate for a youngster of sixteen, but not for me, who was almost\r\na full ten years older\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were afraid of me last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally\xe2\x80\x94of course\xe2\x80\x94but won\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat down, and enjoyed my embarrassment\xe2\x80\x94for actually I was even more\r\nafraid of her now in the full light of day. A delightful expression of\r\ncontempt hovered about her upper lip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look at love, and especially woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, \xe2\x80\x9cas something\r\nhostile, something against which you put up a defense, even if\r\nunsuccessfully. You feel that their power over you gives you a\r\nsensation of pleasurable torture, of pungent cruelty. This is a\r\ngenuinely modern point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t share it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not share it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly and decisively, shaking her head,\r\nso that her curls flew up like red flames.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ideal which I strive to realize in my life is the serene\r\nsensuousness of the Greeks\xe2\x80\x94pleasure without pain. I do not believe in\r\nthe kind of love which is preached by Christianity, by the moderns, by\r\nthe knights of the spirit. Yes, look at me, I am worse than a heretic,\r\nI am a pagan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counsel\r\nWhen in Ida\xe2\x80\x99s grove she was pleased with the hero Anchises?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese lines from Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s _Roman Elegy_ have always delighted me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn nature there is only the love of the heroic age, \xe2\x80\x98when gods and\r\ngoddesses loved.\xe2\x80\x99 At that time \xe2\x80\x98desire followed the glance, enjoyment\r\ndesire.\xe2\x80\x99 All else is factitious, affected, a lie. Christianity, whose\r\ncruel emblem, the cross, has always had for me an element of the\r\nmonstrous, brought something alien and hostile into nature and its\r\ninnocent instincts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modern man.\r\nI do not care to have a share in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mount Olympus would be the place for you, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity, least of\r\nall in love. The idea of sharing a woman, even if it were an Aspasia,\r\nwith another revolts us. We are jealous as is our God. For example, we\r\nhave made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious Phryne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe prefer one of Holbein\xe2\x80\x99s meagre, pallid virgins, which is wholly\r\nours to an antique Venus, no matter how divinely beautiful she is, but\r\nwho loves Anchises to-day, Paris to-morrow, Adonis the day after. And\r\nif nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowing, passionate\r\ndevotion to such a woman, her serene joy of life appears to us as\r\nsomething demonic and cruel, and we read into our happiness a sin which\r\nwe must expiate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you too are one of those who rave about modern women, those\r\nmiserable hysterical feminine creatures who don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate a real man\r\nin their somnambulistic search for some dream-man and masculine ideal.\r\nAmid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their Christian duties;\r\nthey cheat and are cheated; they always seek again and choose and\r\nreject; they are never happy, and never give happiness. They accuse\r\nfate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love and live as\r\nHelen and Aspasia lived. Nature admits of no permanence in the relation\r\nbetween man and woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear lady\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me finish. It is only man\xe2\x80\x99s egoism which wants to keep woman like\r\nsome buried treasure. All endeavors to introduce permanence in love,\r\nthe most changeable thing in this changeable human existence, have gone\r\nshipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies, vows, and legalities. Can\r\nyou deny that our Christian world has given itself over to corruption?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are about to say, the individual who rebels against the\r\narrangements of society is ostracized, branded, stoned. So be it. I am\r\nwilling to take the risk; my principles are very pagan. I will live my\r\nown life as it pleases me. I am willing to do without your hypocritical\r\nrespect; I prefer to be happy. The inventors of the Christian marriage\r\nhave done well, simultaneously to invent immortality. I, however, have\r\nno wish to live eternally. When with my last breath everything as far\r\nas Wanda von Dunajew is concerned comes to an end here below, what does\r\nit profit me whether my pure spirit joins the choirs of angels, or\r\nwhether my dust goes into the formation of new beings? Shall I belong\r\nto one man whom I don\xe2\x80\x99t love, merely because I have once loved him? No,\r\nI do not renounce; I love everyone who pleases me, and give happiness\r\nto everyone who loves me. Is that ugly? No, it is more beautiful by\r\nfar, than if cruelly I enjoy the tortures, which my beauty excites, and\r\nvirtuously reject the poor fellow who is pining away for me. I am\r\nyoung, rich, and beautiful, and I live serenely for the sake of\r\npleasure and enjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly, and I had taken\r\nhold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them, but\r\nbeing a genuine dilettante I hastily let go of them again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour frankness,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cdelights me, and not it alone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there were a\r\nrope around my neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were about to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was about to say\xe2\x80\x94I was\xe2\x80\x94I am sorry\xe2\x80\x94I interrupted you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA long pause. She is doubtless engaging in a monologue, which\r\ntranslated into my language would be comprised in the single word,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdonkey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I may ask,\xe2\x80\x9d I finally began, \xe2\x80\x9chow did you arrive at these\xe2\x80\x94these\r\nconclusions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite simply, my father was an intelligent man. From my cradle onward\r\nI was surrounded by replicas of ancient art; at ten years of age I read\r\n_Gil Blas_, at twelve _La Pucelle_. Where others had Hop-o\xe2\x80\x99-my-thumb,\r\nBluebeard, Cinderella, as childhood friends, mine were Venus and\r\nApollo, Hercules and Lackoon. My husband\xe2\x80\x99s personality was filled with\r\nserenity and sunlight. Not even the incurable illness which fell upon\r\nhim soon after our marriage could long cloud his brow. On the very\r\nnight of his death he took me in his arms, and during the many months\r\nwhen he lay dying in his wheel chair, he often said jokingly to me:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, have you already picked out a lover?\xe2\x80\x99 I blushed with shame.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t deceive me,\xe2\x80\x99 he added on one occasion, \xe2\x80\x98that would seem ugly to\r\nme, but pick out an attractive lover, or preferably several. You are a\r\nsplendid woman, but still half a child, and you need toys.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, I hardly need tell you that during his life time I had no\r\nlover; but it was through him that I have become what I am, a woman of\r\nGreece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA goddess,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich one,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVenus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, even\r\na \xe2\x80\x98Venus in Furs.\xe2\x80\x99 Watch out, I have a large, very large fur, with\r\nwhich I could cover you up entirely, and I have a mind to catch you in\r\nit as in a net.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe,\xe2\x80\x9d I said quickly, for an idea which seemed good, in\r\nspite of its conventionality and triteness, flashed into my head, \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nyou believe that your theories could be carried into execution at the\r\npresent time, that Venus would be permitted to stray with impunity\r\namong our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty and\r\nserenity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Undraped_, of course not, but in furs,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cwould\r\nyou care to see mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful, free, serene, and happy human beings, such as the Greeks\r\nwere, are only possible when it is permitted to have _slaves_ who will\r\nperform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all else\r\nlabor for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied playfully, \xe2\x80\x9can Olympian divinity, such as I\r\nam, requires a whole army of slaves. Beware of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI myself was frightened at the hardiness with which I uttered this\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhy\xe2\x80\x9d; it did not startle her in the least.\r\n\r\nShe drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth became\r\nvisible, and then said lightly, as if she were discussing some trifling\r\nmatter, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to be my slave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no equality in love,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever it is a\r\nmatter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled, it seems much more\r\nsatisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman. But where\r\nshall I find the woman who knows how to rule, calmly, full of\r\nself-confidence, even harshly, and not seek to gain her power by means\r\nof petty nagging?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that might not be so difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94for instance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed and leaned far back\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have a real talent\r\nfor despotism\xe2\x80\x94I also have the necessary furs\xe2\x80\x94but last night you were\r\nreally seriously afraid of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I am more afraid of you than ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe are together every day, I and\xe2\x80\x94Venus; we are together a great deal.\r\nWe breakfast in my honey-suckle arbor, and have tea in her little\r\nsitting-room. I have an opportunity to unfold all my small, very small\r\ntalents. Of what use would have been my study of all the various\r\nsciences, my playing at all the arts, if I were unable in the case of a\r\npretty, little woman\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nBut this woman is by no means little; in fact she impresses me\r\ntremendously. I made a drawing of her to-day, and felt particularly\r\nclearly, how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for a\r\ncameo-head like hers. The configuration of her face has little of the\r\nRoman, but much of the Greek.\r\n\r\nSometimes I should like to paint her as Psyche, and then again as\r\nAstarte. It depends upon the expression in her eyes, whether it is\r\nvaguely dreamy, or half-consuming, filled with tired desire. She,\r\nhowever, insists that it be a portrait-likeness.\r\n\r\nI shall make her a present of furs.\r\n\r\nHow could I have any doubts? If not for her, for whom would princely\r\nfurs be suitable?\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was with her yesterday evening, reading the _Roman Elegies_ to her.\r\nThen I laid the book aside, and improvised something for her. She\r\nseemed pleased; rather more than that, she actually hung upon my words,\r\nand her bosom heaved.\r\n\r\nOr was I mistaken?\r\n\r\nThe rain beat in melancholy fashion on the window-panes, the fire\r\ncrackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort. I felt quite at home with\r\nher, and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful woman; I\r\nkissed her hand, and she permitted it.\r\n\r\nThen I sat down at her feet and read a short poem I had written for\r\nher.\r\n\r\n  VENUS IN FURS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlace thy foot upon thy slave,\r\n    Oh thou, half of hell, half of dreams;\r\nAmong the shadows, dark and grave,\r\n    Thy extended body softly gleams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd\xe2\x80\x94so on. This time I really got beyond the first stanza. At her\r\nrequest I gave her the poem in the evening, keeping no copy. And now as\r\nI am writing this down in my diary I can only remember the first\r\nstanza.\r\n\r\nI am filled with a very curious sensation. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that I am in\r\nlove with Wanda; I am sure that at our first meeting, I felt nothing of\r\nthe lightning-like flashes of passion. But I feel how her\r\nextraordinary, really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares\r\nabout me. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me; it is\r\na physical subjection, coming on slowly, but for that reason more\r\nabsolutely.\r\n\r\nI suffer under it more and more each day, and she\xe2\x80\x94she merely smiles.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithout any provocation she suddenly said to me to-day: \xe2\x80\x9cYou interest\r\nme. Most men are very commonplace, without verve or poetry. In you\r\nthere is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and a deep\r\nseriousness, which delight me. I might learn to love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadow and\r\nthe statue of Venus. All about us the earth steamed; mists rose up\r\ntoward heaven like clouds of incense; a shattered rainbow still hovered\r\nin the air. The trees were still shedding drops, but sparrows and\r\nfinches were already hopping from twig to twig. They are twittering\r\ngaily, as if very much pleased at something. Everything is filled with\r\na fresh fragrance. We cannot cross the meadow for it is still wet. In\r\nthe sunlight it looks like a small pool, and the goddess of love seems\r\nto rise from the undulations of its mirror-like surface. About her head\r\na swarm of gnats is dancing, which, illuminated by the sun, seem to\r\nhover above her like an aureole.\r\n\r\nWanda is enjoying the lovely scene. As all the benches along the walk\r\nare still wet, she supports herself on my arm to rest a while. A soft\r\nweariness permeates her whole being, her eyes are half closed; I feel\r\nthe touch of her breath on my cheek.\r\n\r\nHow I managed to get up courage enough I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I took\r\nhold of her hand, asking,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, letting her calm, clear look rest upon me, but\r\nnot for long.\r\n\r\nA moment later I am kneeling before her, pressing my burning face\r\nagainst the fragrant muslin of her gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Severin\xe2\x80\x94this isn\xe2\x80\x99t right,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nBut I take hold of her little foot, and press my lips upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are getting worse and worse!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. She tore herself free,\r\nand fled rapidly toward the house, the while her adorable slipper\r\nremained in my hand.\r\n\r\nIs it an omen?\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll day long I didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to go near her. Toward evening as I was\r\nsitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through the\r\ngreenery of her balcony. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you come up?\xe2\x80\x9d he called down\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\nI ran upstairs, and at the top lost courage again. I knocked very\r\nlightly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t say come-in, but opened the door herself, and stood\r\non the threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my slipper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is\xe2\x80\x94I have\xe2\x80\x94I want,\xe2\x80\x9d I stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet it, and then we will have tea together, and chat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, she was engaged in making tea. I ceremoniously placed\r\nthe slipper on the table, and stood in the corner like a child awaiting\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nI noticed that her brows were slightly contracted, and there was an\r\nexpression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delighted me.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden she broke out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\x94you are really in love\xe2\x80\x94with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I suffer more from it than you can imagine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou suffer?\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed again.\r\n\r\nI was revolted, mortified, annihilated, but all this was quite useless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI like you, with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave me her hand, and looked at me in the friendliest fashion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you be my wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda looked at me\xe2\x80\x94how did she look at me? I think first of all with\r\nsurprise, and then with a tinge of irony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has given you so much courage, all at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes courage, to ask anyone to be your wife, and me in particular?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlifted up the slipper. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it through a sudden friendship with this?\r\nBut joking aside. Do you really wish to marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Severin, that is a serious matter. I believe, you love me, and I\r\ncare for you too, and what is more important each of us finds the other\r\ninteresting. There is no danger that we would soon get bored, but, you\r\nknow, I am a fickle person, and just for that reason I take marriage\r\nseriously. If I assume obligations, I want to be able to meet them. But\r\nI am afraid\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94it would hurt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease be perfectly frank with me,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I could love a man longer than\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe inclined her head gracefully to one side and mused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you imagine\xe2\x80\x94a month perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you\xe2\x80\x94perhaps two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo months!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo months is very long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go beyond antiquity, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, you cannot stand the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplace,\r\nwatching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do with you?\xe2\x80\x9d she began anew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you wish,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied with resignation, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever will give\r\nyou pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow illogical!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cfirst you want to make me your wife, and\r\nthen you offer yourself to me as something to toy with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda\xe2\x80\x94I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we are back to the place where we started. You love me, and want\r\nto make me your wife, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to enter into a new marriage,\r\nbecause I doubt the permanence of both my and your feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I am willing to take the risk with you?\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it also depends on whether I am willing to risk it with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can easily imagine belonging to one man for my entire\r\nlife, but he would have to be a whole man, a man who would dominate me,\r\nwho would subjugate me by his inate strength, do you understand? And\r\nevery man\xe2\x80\x94I know this very well\xe2\x80\x94as soon as he falls in love becomes\r\nweak, pliable, ridiculous. He puts himself into the woman\xe2\x80\x99s hands,\r\nkneels down before her. The only man whom I could love permanently\r\nwould be he before whom I should have to kneel. I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to like you\r\nso much, however, that I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI fell down at her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, here you are kneeling already,\xe2\x80\x9d she said mockingly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are making a good beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d When I had risen again she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cI will give you a year\xe2\x80\x99s time to win me, to convince me\r\nthat we are suited to each other, that we might live together. If you\r\nsucceed, I will become your wife, and a wife, Severin, who will\r\nconscientiously and strictly perform all her duties. During this year\r\nwe will live as though we were married\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy blood rose to my head.\r\n\r\nIn her eyes too there was a sudden flame\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will live together,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cshare our daily life, so that\r\nwe may find out whether we are really fitted for each other. _I grant\r\nyou all the rights of a husband, of a lover, of a friend._ Are you\r\nsatisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, I want to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid. That is how a man speaks. Here is my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor ten days I have been with her every hour, except at night. All the\r\ntime I was allowed to look into her eyes, hold her hands, listen to\r\nwhat she said, accompany her wherever she went.\r\n\r\nMy love seems to me like a deep, bottomless abyss, into which I subside\r\ndeeper and deeper. There is nothing now which could save me from it.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the\r\nVenus-statue. I plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap; she wound\r\nthem into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became confused\r\nand passion swept over my head like a conflagration. Losing command\r\nover myself, I threw my arms about her and clung to her lips, and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x94she drew me close to her heaving breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you angry?\xe2\x80\x9d I then asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am never angry at anything that is natural\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut _I_\r\nam afraid you suffer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am suffering frightfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor friend!\xe2\x80\x9d she brushed my disordered hair back from my fore-head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it isn\xe2\x80\x99t through any fault of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I replied,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand yet my love for you has become a sort of madness.\r\nThe thought that I might lose you, perhaps actually lose you, torments\r\nme day and night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t yet possess me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, and again she looked at me\r\nwith that vibrant, consuming expression, which had already once before\r\ncarried me away. Then she rose, and with her small transparent hands\r\nplaced a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white head of\r\nVenus. Half against my will I threw my arm around her body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can no longer live without you, oh wonderful woman,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, believe only this once, that this time it is not a phrase,\r\nnot a thing of dreams. I feel deep down in my innermost soul, that my\r\nlife belongs inseparably with yours. If you leave me, I shall perish,\r\ngo to pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will hardly be necessary, for I love you,\xe2\x80\x9d she took hold of my\r\nchin, \xe2\x80\x9cyou foolish man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will be mine only under conditions, while I belong to you\r\nunconditionally\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t wise, Severin,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied almost with a start. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow me yet, do you absolutely refuse to know me? I am good when I am\r\ntreated seriously and reasonably, but when you abandon yourself too\r\nabsolutely to me, I grow arrogant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it, be arrogant, be despotic,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried in the fulness of\r\nexaltation, \xe2\x80\x9conly be mine, mine forever.\xe2\x80\x9d I lay at her feet, embracing\r\nher knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings will end badly, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she said soberly, without moving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall never end,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried excitedly, almost violently. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly death\r\nshall part us. If you cannot be mine, all mine and for always, then _I\r\nwant to be your slave_, serve you, suffer everything from you, if only\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t drive me away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalm yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, bending down and kissing my forehead, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nreally very fond of you, but your way is not the way to win and hold\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to do everything, absolutely everything, that you want, only\r\nnot to lose you,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9conly not that, I cannot bear the thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo get up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a strange person,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Wanda. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wish to possess me at\r\nany price?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, at any price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of what value, for instance, would that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94She pondered; a\r\nlurking uncanny expression entered her eyes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIf I no longer loved you,\r\nif I belonged to another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shudder ran through me. I looked at her She stood firmly and\r\nconfident before me, and her eyes disclosed a cold gleam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthe very thought frightens you.\xe2\x80\x9d A beautiful\r\nsmile suddenly illuminated her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel a perfect horror, when I imagine, that the woman I love and who\r\nhas responded to my love could give herself to another regardless of\r\nme. But have I still a choice? If I love such a woman, even unto\r\nmadness, shall I turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake\r\nof a bit of boastful strength; shall I send a bullet through my brains?\r\nI have two ideals of woman. If I cannot obtain the one that is noble\r\nand simple, the woman who will faithfully and truly share my life, well\r\nthen I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything half-way or lukewarm. Then I would rather be\r\nsubject to a woman without virtue, fidelity, or pity. Such a woman in\r\nher magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal. If I am not permitted\r\nto enjoy the happiness of love, fully and wholly, I want to taste its\r\npains and torments to the very dregs; I want to be maltreated and\r\nbetrayed by the woman I love, and the more cruelly the better. This too\r\nis a luxury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you lost your senses,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wanda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you with all my soul,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwith all my senses, and\r\nyour presence and personality are absolutely essential to me, if I am\r\nto go on living. Choose between my ideals. Do with me what you will,\r\nmake of me your husband or your slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, contracting her small but strongly arched\r\nbrows, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a man,\r\nwho interests me and loves me, completely in my power; at least I shall\r\nnot lack pastime. You were imprudent enough to leave the choice to me.\r\nTherefore I choose; I want you to be my slave, I shall make a plaything\r\nfor myself out of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please do,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried half-shuddering, half-enraptured. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the\r\nfoundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement, it is\r\nlikewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites. We are\r\nsuch opposites, almost enemies. That is why my love is part hate, part\r\nfear. In such a relation only one can be hammer and the other anvil. I\r\nwish to be the anvil. I cannot be happy when I look down upon the woman\r\nI love. I want to adore a woman, and this I can only do when she is\r\ncruel towards me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Severin,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wanda, almost angrily, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you believe me\r\ncapable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do, and whom I love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, if I adore you the more on this account? _It is possible to\r\nlove really only that which stands above us,_ a woman, who through her\r\nbeauty, temperament, intelligence, and strength of will subjugates us\r\nand becomes a despot over us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen that which repels others, attracts you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. That is the strange part of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, after all, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything so very unique or strange in\r\nall your passions, for who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love beautiful furs? And everyone\r\nknows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty are related.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in my case all these elements are raised to their highest degree,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words, reason has little power over you, and you are by\r\nnature, soft, sensual, yielding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere the martyrs also soft and sensual by nature?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe martyrs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, they were _supersensual men,_ who found enjoyment in\r\nsuffering. They sought out the most frightful tortures, even death\r\nitself, as others seek joy, and as they were, so am I\xe2\x80\x94_supersensual.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a care that in being such, you do not become a martyr to love,\r\nthe _martyr of a woman_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe are sitting on Wanda\xe2\x80\x99s little balcony in the mellow fragrant summer\r\nnight. A twofold roof is above us, first the green ceiling of\r\nclimbing-plants, and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable\r\nstars. The low wailing love-call of a cat rises from the park. I am\r\nsitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity, and am telling her of\r\nmy childhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked in\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wanda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember a time when I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have them. Even in my\r\ncradle, so mother has told me, I was _supersensual._ I scorned the\r\nhealthy breast of my nurse, and had to be brought up on goats\xe2\x80\x99 milk. As\r\na little boy I was mysteriously shy before women, which really was only\r\nan expression of an inordinate interest in them. I was oppressed by the\r\ngray arches and half-darknesses of the church, and actually afraid of\r\nthe glittering altars and images of the saints. Secretly, however, I\r\nsneaked as to a secret joy to a plaster-Venus which stood in my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s little library. I kneeled down before her, and to her I said\r\nthe prayers I had been taught\xe2\x80\x94the Paternoster, the Ave Maria, and the\r\nCredo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce at night I left my bed to visit her. The sickle of the moon was\r\nmy light and showed me the goddess in a pale-blue cold light. I\r\nprostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet, as I had seen\r\nour peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead Savior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn irresistible yearning seized me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the cold\r\nlips. A deep shudder fell upon me and I fled, and later in a dream, it\r\nseemed to me, as if the goddess stood beside my bed, threatening me\r\nwith up-raised arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium. I\r\npassionately grasped at everything which promised to make the world of\r\nantiquity accessible to me. Soon I was more familiar with the gods of\r\nGreece than with the religion of Jesus. I was with Paris when he gave\r\nthe fateful apple to Venus, I saw Troy burn, and followed Ulysses on\r\nhis wanderings. The prototypes of all that is beautiful sank deep into\r\nmy soul, and consequently at the time when other boys are coarse and\r\nobscene, I displayed an insurmountable aversion to everything base,\r\nvulgar, unbeautiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me, the maturing youth, love for women seemed something especially\r\nbase and unbeautiful, for it showed itself to me first in all its\r\ncommonness. I avoided all contact with the fair sex; in short, I was\r\nsupersensual to madness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was about fourteen my mother had a charming chamber-maid,\r\nyoung, attractive, with a figure just budding into womanhood. I was\r\nsitting one day studying my Tacitus and growing enthusiastic over the\r\nvirtues of the ancient Teutons, while she was sweeping my room.\r\nSuddenly she stopped, bent down over me, in the meantime holding fast\r\nto the broom, and a pair of fresh, full, adorable lips touched mine.\r\nThe kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudder, but\r\nI raised up my _Germania_, like a shield against the temptress, and\r\nindignantly left the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda broke out in loud laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would, indeed, be hard to find\r\nanother man like you, but continue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is another unforgetable incident belonging to that period,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ncontinued my story. \xe2\x80\x9cCountess Sobol, a distant aunt of mine, was\r\nvisiting my parents. She was a beautiful majestic woman with an\r\nattractive smile. I, however, hated her, for she was regarded by the\r\nfamily as a sort of Messalina. My behavior toward her was as rude,\r\nmalicious, and awkward as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day my parents drove to the capital of the district. My aunt\r\ndetermined to take advantage of their absence, and to exercise judgment\r\nover me. She entered unexpectedly in her fur-lined _kazabaika,_2\r\nfollowed by the cook, kitchen-maid, and the cat of a chamber-maid whom\r\nI had scorned. Without asking any questions, they seized me and bound\r\nme hand and foot, in spite of my violent resistance. Then my aunt, with\r\nan evil smile, rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout\r\nswitch. She whipped so hard that the blood flowed, and that, at last,\r\nnotwithstanding my heroic spirit, I cried and wept and begged for\r\nmercy. She then had me untied, but I had to get down on my knees and\r\nthank her for the punishment and kiss her hand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A woman\xe2\x80\x99s jacket.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you understand the supersensual fool! Under the lash of a\r\nbeautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman. In her\r\nfur-jacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen, and from then on my\r\naunt became the most desirable woman on God\xe2\x80\x99s earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Cato-like austerity, my shyness before woman, was nothing but an\r\nexcessive feeling for beauty. In my imagination sensuality became a\r\nsort of cult. I took an oath to myself that I would not squander its\r\nholy wealth upon any ordinary person, but I would reserve it for an\r\nideal woman, if possible for the goddess of love herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to the university at a very early age. It was in the capital\r\nwhere my aunt lived. My room looked at that time like Doctor Faustus\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nEverything in it was in a wild confusion. There were huge closets\r\nstuffed full of books, which I bought for a song from a Jewish dealer\r\non the Servanica;3 there were globes, atlases, flasks, charts of the\r\nheavens, skeletons of animals, skulls, the busts of eminent men. It\r\nlooked as though Mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the\r\nhuge green store as a wandering scholiast at any moment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The street of the Jews in Lemberg.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI studied everything in a jumble without system, without selection:\r\nchemistry, alchemy, history, astronomy, philosophy, law, anatomy, and\r\nliterature; I read Homer, Virgil, Ossian, Schiller, Goethe,\r\nShakespeare, Cervantes, Voltaire, Moli\xc3\xa8re, the Koran, the Kosmos,\r\nCasanova\xe2\x80\x99s Memoirs. I grew more confused each day, more fantastical,\r\nmore supersensual. All the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in my\r\nimagination. Every so and so often she appeared before me like a vision\r\namong my leather-bound books and dead bones, lying on a bed of roses,\r\nsurrounded by cupids. Sometimes she appeared gowned like the Olympians\r\nwith the stern white face of the plaster Venus; sometimes in braids of\r\na rich brown, blue-eyes, in my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s red velvet _kazabaika,_ trimmed\r\nwith ermine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of my\r\nimagination in all her smiling beauty, I went to see Countess Sobol,\r\nwho received me in a friendly, even cordial manner. She gave me a kiss\r\nof welcome, which put all my senses in a turmoil. She was probably\r\nabout forty years old, but like most well-preserved women of the world,\r\nstill very attractive. She wore as always her fur-edged jacket. This\r\ntime it was one of green velvet with brown marten. But nothing of the\r\nsternness which had so delighted me the other time was now discernable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, there was so little of cruelty in her that without\r\nany more ado she let me adore her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly too soon did she discover my supersensual folly and innocence,\r\nand it pleased her to make me happy. As for myself\xe2\x80\x94I was as happy as a\r\nyoung god. What rapture for me to be allowed to lie before her on my\r\nknees, and to kiss her hands, those with which she had scourged me!\r\nWhat marvellous hands they were, of beautiful form, delicate, rounded,\r\nand white, with adorable dimples! I really was in love with her hands\r\nonly. I played with them, let them submerge and emerge in the dark fur,\r\nheld them against the light, and was unable to satiate my eyes with\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda involuntarily looked at her hand; I noticed it, and had to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in those\r\ndays you can see that I was in love only with the cruel lashes I\r\nreceived from my aunt; and about two years later when I paid court to a\r\nyoung actress only in the roles she played. Still later I became the\r\nadmirer of a respectable woman. She acted the part of irreproachable\r\nvirtue, only in the end to betray me with a rich Jew. You see, it is\r\nbecause I was betrayed, sold, by a woman who feigned the strictest\r\nprinciples and the highest ideals, that I hate that sort of poetical,\r\nsentimental virtue so intensely. Give me rather a woman who is honest\r\nenough to say to me: I am a Pompadour, a Lucretia Borgia, and I am\r\nready to adore her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda rose and opened the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a curious way of arousing one\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, stimulating all\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s nerves, and making one\xe2\x80\x99s pulses beat faster. You put an aureole\r\non vice, provided only if it is honest. Your ideal is a daring\r\ncourtesan of genius. Oh, you are the kind of man who will corrupt a\r\nwoman to her very last fiber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night there was a knock at my window; I got up,\r\nopened it, and was startled. Without stood \xe2\x80\x9cVenus in Furs,\xe2\x80\x9d just as she\r\nhad appeared to me the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have disturbed me with your stories; I have been tossing about in\r\nbed, and can\xe2\x80\x99t go to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow come and stay with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I entered Wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she had kindled\r\na small fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAutumn is coming,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, \xe2\x80\x9cthe nights are really quite cold\r\nalready. I am afraid you may not like it, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t put off my furs\r\nuntil the room is sufficiently warm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot like it\xe2\x80\x94you are joking\xe2\x80\x94you know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I threw my arm around her, and\r\nkissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I know, but why this great fondness for furs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was born with it,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI already had it as a child.\r\nFurthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organized\r\nnatures. This is due both to general and natural laws. It is a physical\r\nstimulus which sets you tingling, and no one can wholly escape it.\r\nScience has recently shown a certain relationship between electricity\r\nand warmth; at any rate, their effects upon the human organism are\r\nrelated. The torrid zone produces more passionate characters, a heated\r\natmosphere stimulation. Likewise with electricity. This is the reason\r\nwhy the presence of cats exercises such a magic influence upon\r\nhighly-organized men of intellect. This is why these long-tailed Graces\r\nof the animal kingdom, these adorable, scintillating electric batteries\r\nhave been the favorite animal of a Mahommed, Cardinal Richelieu,\r\nCrebillon, Rousseau, Wieland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman wearing furs, then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wanda, \xe2\x80\x9cis nothing else than a\r\nlarge cat, an augmented electric battery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is my explanation of the symbolic meaning\r\nwhich fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beauty. Monarchs\r\nand the dominant higher nobility in former times used it in this sense\r\nfor their costume, exclusively; great painters used it only for queenly\r\nbeauty. The most beautiful frame, which Raphael could find for the\r\ndivine forms of Fornarina and Titian for the roseate body of his\r\nbeloved, was dark furs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks for the learned discourse on love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t told me everything. You associate something entirely individual\r\nwith furs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI have repeatedly told you that suffering has a\r\npeculiar attraction for me. Nothing can intensify my passion more than\r\ntyranny, cruelty, and especially the faithlessness of a beautiful\r\nwoman. And I cannot imagine this woman, this strange ideal derived from\r\nan aesthetics of ugliness, this soul of Nero in the body of a Phryne,\r\nexcept in furs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt gives a dominant and imposing\r\nquality to a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot only that,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I am _supersensual._ With me\r\neverything has its roots in the imagination, and thence it receives its\r\nnourishment. I was already pre-maturely developed and highly sensitive,\r\nwhen at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrs fell into my\r\nhands. I remember reading with a kind of horror, which really was\r\nrapture, of how they pined in prisons, were laid on the gridiron,\r\npierced with arrows, boiled in pitch, thrown to wild animals, nailed to\r\nthe cross, and suffered the most horrible torment with a kind of joy.\r\nTo suffer and endure cruel torture from then on seemed to me exquisite\r\ndelight, especially when it was inflicted by a beautiful woman, for\r\never since I can remember all poetry and everything demonic was for me\r\nconcentrated in woman. I literally carried the idea into a sort of\r\ncult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt there was something sacred in sex; in fact, it was the only\r\nsacred thing. In woman and her beauty I saw something divine, because\r\nthe most important function of existence\xe2\x80\x94the continuation of the\r\nspecies\xe2\x80\x94is her vocation. To me woman represented a personification of\r\nnature, _Isis_, and man was her priest, her slave. In contrast to him\r\nshe was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has served\r\nher purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it. To him her\r\ncruelties, even death itself, still were sensual raptures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI envied King Gunther whom the mighty Brunhilde fettered on the bridal\r\nnight, and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistress had sewed\r\nin the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game. I envied the\r\nKnight Ctirad whom the daring Amazon Scharka craftily ensnared in a\r\nforest near Prague, and carried to her castle Divin, where, after\r\nhaving amused herself a while with him, she had him broken on the\r\nwheel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDisgusting,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wanda. \xe2\x80\x9cI almost wish you might fall into the hands\r\nof a woman of their savage race. In the wolf\xe2\x80\x99s skin, under the teeth of\r\nthe dogs, or upon the wheel, you would lose the taste for your kind of\r\npoetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so? I hardly do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you actually lost your senses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly. But let me go on. I developed a perfect passion for reading\r\nstories in which the extremest cruelties were described. I loved\r\nespecially to look at pictures and prints which represented them. All\r\nthe sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne; the inquisitors who\r\nhad the heretics tortured, roasted, and butchered; all the woman whom\r\nthe pages of history have recorded as lustful, beautiful, and violent\r\nwomen like Libussa, Lucretia Borgia, Agnes of Hungary, Queen Margot,\r\nIsabeau, the Sultana Roxolane, the Russian Czarinas of last century\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthese I saw in furs or in robes bordered with ermine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, and\r\nsimultaneously she began to drape her magnificent fur-cloak\r\ncoquettishly about her, so that the dark shining sable played\r\nbeautifully around her bust and arms. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how do you feel now, half\r\nbroken on the wheel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mocking\r\nsatisfaction. Overcome by desire, I flung myself down before her, and\r\nthrew my arms about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94you have awakened my dearest dream,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has slept long\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is?\xe2\x80\x9d She put her hand on my neck.\r\n\r\nI was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of this warm\r\nlittle hand and of her regard, which, tenderly searching, fell upon me\r\nthrough her half-closed lids.\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cTo be the slave of a woman, a beautiful woman, whom I love, whom I\r\nworship.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who on that account maltreats you,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Wanda, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, who fetters me and whips me, treads me underfoot, the while she\r\ngives herself to another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present of you\r\nto your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you must meet\r\nhim face to face, who will turn you over to his absolute mercy. Why\r\nnot? This final tableau doesn\xe2\x80\x99t please you so well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at Wanda frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surpass my dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we women are inventive,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9ctake heed, when you find your\r\nideal, it might easily happen, that she will treat you more cruelly\r\nthan you anticipate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid that I have already found my ideal!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, burying\r\nmy burning face in her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wanda, throwing off her furs and moving about the\r\nroom laughing. She was still laughing as I went downstairs, and when I\r\nstood musing in the yard, I still heard her peals of laughter above.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really then expect me to embody your ideal?\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda asked\r\narchly, when we met in the park to-day.\r\n\r\nAt first I could find no answer. The most antagonistic emotions were\r\nbattling within me. In the meantime she sat down on one of the\r\nstone-benches, and played with a flower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI kneeled down and seized her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more I beg you to become my wife, my true and loyal wife; if you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t do that then become the embodiment of my ideal, absolutely,\r\nwithout reservation, without softness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand, if you\r\nprove to be the man I am seeking,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda replied very seriously, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nthink you would be more grateful to me if through me you realized your\r\nimaginings. Well, which do you prefer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent in\r\nyour personality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you enjoy having a man wholly in your\r\npower, torturing him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cor perhaps\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d She pondered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand myself any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have a\r\nconfession to make to you. You have corrupted my imagination and\r\ninflamed my blood. I am beginning to like the things you speak of. The\r\nenthusiasm with which you speak of a Pompadour, a Catherine the Second,\r\nand all the other selfish, frivolous, cruel women, carries me away and\r\ntakes hold of my soul. It urges me on to become like those women, who\r\nin spite of their vileness were slavishly adored during their lifetime\r\nand still exert a miraculous power from their graves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will end by making of me a despot in miniature, a domestic\r\nPompadour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d I said in agitation, \xe2\x80\x9cif all this is inherent in you, give\r\nway to this trend of your nature. Nothing half-way. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t be a\r\ntrue and loyal wife to me, be a demon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was nervous from loss of sleep, and the proximity of the beautiful\r\nwoman affected me like a fever. I no longer recall what I said, but I\r\nremember that I kissed her feet, and finally raised her foot and put my\r\nneck under it. She withdrew it quickly, and rose almost angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you love me, Severin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly, and her voice sounded\r\nsharp and commanding, \xe2\x80\x9cnever speak to me of those things again.\r\nUnderstand, never! Otherwise I might really\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She smiled and sat down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am entirely serious,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, half-raving. \xe2\x80\x9cI adore you so\r\ninfinitely that I am willing to suffer anything from you, for the sake\r\nof spending my whole life near you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeverin, once more I warn you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour warning is vain. Do with me what you will, as long as you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndrive me away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeverin,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wanda, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a frivolous young woman; it is\r\ndangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power. You will\r\nend by actually becoming a plaything to me. Who will give warrant that\r\nI shall not abuse your insane desire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour own nobility of character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPower makes people over-bearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9ctread me underfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda threw her arms around my neck, looked into my eyes, and shook her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t, but I will try, for your sake, for I love you\r\nSeverin, as I have loved no other man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo-day she suddenly took her hat and shawl, and I had to go shopping\r\nwith her. She looked at whips, long whips with a short handle, the kind\r\nthat are used on dogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre these satisfactory?\xe2\x80\x9d said the shopkeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they are much too small,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wanda, with a side-glance at me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need a large\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a bull-dog, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d opined the merchant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cof the kind that are used in Russia for\r\nintractable slaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked further and finally selected a whip, at whose sight I felt a\r\nstrange creeping sensation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow good-by, Severin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have some other purchases to make,\r\nbut you can\xe2\x80\x99t go along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI left her and took a walk. On the way back I saw Wanda coming out at a\r\nfurrier\xe2\x80\x99s. She beckoned me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider it well,\xe2\x80\x9d she began in good spirits, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never made a\r\nsecret of how deeply your serious, dreamy character has fascinated me.\r\nThe idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power, actually lying\r\nenraptured at my feet, of course, stimulates me\xe2\x80\x94but will this\r\nattraction last? Woman loves a man; she maltreats a slave, and ends by\r\nkicking him aside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well then, kick me aside,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you are tired of me.\r\nI want to be your slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDangerous forces lie within me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, after we had gone a few\r\nsteps further. \xe2\x80\x9cYou awaken them, and not to your advantage. You know\r\nhow to paint pleasure, cruelty, arrogance in glowing colors. What would\r\nyou say should I try my hand at them, and make you the first object of\r\nmy experiments. I would be like Dionysius who had the inventor of the\r\niron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his wails and groans\r\nreally resembled the bellowing of an ox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I am a female Dionysius?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cand my dreams will be fulfilled. I am yours for\r\ngood or evil, choose. The destiny that lies concealed within my breast\r\ndrives me on\xe2\x80\x94demoniacally\xe2\x80\x94relentlessly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Beloved,\r\n\r\nI do not care to see you to-day or to-morrow, and not until evening the\r\nday after tomorrow, and then _as my slave_.\r\n\r\nYour mistress\r\n\r\nWanda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs my slave\xe2\x80\x9d was underlined. I read the note which I received early in\r\nthe morning a second time. Then I had a donkey saddled, an animal\r\nsymbolic of learned professors, and rode into the mountains. I wanted\r\nto numb my desire, my yearning, with the magnificent scenery of the\r\nCarpathians. I am back, tired, hungry, thirsty, and more in love than\r\never. I quickly change my clothes, and a few moments later knock at her\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI enter. She is standing in the center of the room, dressed in a gown\r\nof white satin which floods down her body like light. Over it she wears\r\na scarlet _kazabaika_, richly edged with ermine. Upon her powdered,\r\nsnowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds. She stands with her arms\r\nfolded across her breast, and with her brows contracted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d I run toward her, and am about to throw my arm about her to\r\nkiss her. She retreats a step, measuring me from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMistress!\xe2\x80\x9d I kneel down, and kiss the hem of her garment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is as it should be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how beautiful you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I please you?\xe2\x80\x9d She stepped before the mirror, and looked at herself\r\nwith proud satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall become mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer lower lip twitched derisively, and she looked at me mockingly from\r\nbehind half-closed lids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the whip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked about the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cstay as you are, kneeling.\xe2\x80\x9d She went over to the\r\nfire-place, took the whip from the mantle-piece, and, watching me with\r\na smile, let it hiss through the air; then she slowly rolled up the\r\nsleeve of her fur-jacket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarvellous woman!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, slave!\xe2\x80\x9d She suddenly scowled, looked savage, and struck me\r\nwith the whip. A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me, and\r\npityingly bent down to me. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I hurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, half-shyly,\r\nhalf-timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand even if you had, pains that come through you are\r\na joy. Strike again, if it gives you pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give me pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain I was seized with that strange intoxication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhip me,\xe2\x80\x9d I begged, \xe2\x80\x9cwhip me without mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda swung the whip, and hit me twice. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you satisfied now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeriously, no?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhip me, I beg you, it is a joy to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, because you know very well that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t serious,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the heart to hurt you. This brutal game goes against\r\nmy grain. Were I really the woman who beats her slaves you would be\r\nhorrified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Wanda,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI love you more than myself; I am devoted to\r\nyou for death and life. In all seriousness, you can do with me whatever\r\nyou will, whatever your caprice suggests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeverin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTread me underfoot!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, and flung myself face to the floor\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate all this play-acting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then maltreat me seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn uncanny pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeverin, I warn you for the last time,\xe2\x80\x9d began Wanda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you love me, be cruel towards me,\xe2\x80\x9d I pleaded with upraised eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I love you,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Wanda. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well!\xe2\x80\x9d She stepped back and\r\nlooked at me with a sombre smile. _\xe2\x80\x9cBe then my slave, and know what it\r\nmeans to be delivered into the hands of a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d_ And at the same\r\nmoment she gave me a kick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you like that, slave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she flourished the whip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was about to rise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that way,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded, \xe2\x80\x9con your knees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obeyed, and she began to apply the lash.\r\n\r\nThe blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms. Each one cut\r\ninto my flesh and burned there, but the pains enraptured me. They came\r\nfrom her whom I adored, and for whom I was ready at any hour to lay\r\ndown my life.\r\n\r\nShe stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cI am beginning to enjoy it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut enough for\r\nto-day. I am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far your\r\nstrength goes. I take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and writhe\r\nbeneath my whip, and in hearing your groans and wails; I want to go on\r\nwhipping without pity until you beg for mercy, until you lose your\r\nsenses. You have awakened dangerous elements in my being. But now get\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI seized her hand to press it to my lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat impudence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shoved me away with her foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of my sight, slave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams, I\r\nawoke. Dawn was just beginning to break.\r\n\r\nHow much of what was hovering in my memory was true; what had I\r\nactually experienced and what had I dreamed? That I had been whipped\r\nwas certain. I can still feel each blow, and count the burning red\r\nstripes on my body. And _she_ whipped me. Now I know everything.\r\n\r\nMy dream has become truth. How does it make me feel? Am I disappointed\r\nin the realization of my dream?\r\n\r\nNo, I am merely somewhat tired, but her cruelty has enraptured me. Oh,\r\nhow I love her, adore her! All this cannot express in the remotest way\r\nmy feeling for her, my complete devotion to her. What happiness to be\r\nher slave!\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe calls to me from her balcony. I hurry upstairs. She is standing on\r\nthe threshold, holding out her hand in friendly fashion. \xe2\x80\x9cI am ashamed\r\nof myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, while I embrace her, and she hides her head\r\nagainst my breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with\r\nquivering voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI have fulfilled your mad wish, now let us be\r\nreasonable and happy and love each other, and in a year I will be your\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cand I your slave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot another word of slavery, cruelty, or the whip,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Wanda.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not grant you any of those favors, none except wearing my\r\nfur-jacket; come and help me into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot his\r\nbolt struck midnight.\r\n\r\nI rose, and wanted to leave.\r\n\r\nWanda said nothing, but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman.\r\nShe began to kiss me anew, and this silent language was so\r\ncomprehensible, so convincing\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAnd it told me more than I dared to understand.\r\n\r\nA languid abandonment pervaded Wanda\xe2\x80\x99s entire being. What a voluptuous\r\nsoftness there was in the gloaming of her half-closed eyes, in the red\r\nflood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the white powder, in\r\nthe red and white satin which crackled about her with every movement,\r\nin the swelling ermine of the _kazabaika_ in which she carelessly\r\nnestled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease,\xe2\x80\x9d I stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you will be angry with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo with me what you will,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then whip me, or I shall go mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I forbidden you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are\r\nincorrigible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am so terribly in love.\xe2\x80\x9d I had sunken on my knees, and was\r\nburying my glowing face in her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your madness is\r\nnothing but a demonic, unsatisfied sensuality. _Our unnatural way of\r\nlife must generate such illnesses._ Were you less virtuous, you would\r\nbe completely sane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, make me sane,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured. My hands were running through\r\nher hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur, which rose and\r\nfell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom, and drove all my\r\nsenses into confusion.\r\n\r\nAnd I kissed her. No, she kissed me savagely, pitilessly, as if she\r\nwanted to slay me with her kisses. I was as in a delirium, and had long\r\nsince lost my reason, but now I, too, was breathless. I sought to free\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wanda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am suffering agonies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are suffering\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out into a loud amused laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou laugh!\xe2\x80\x9d I moaned, \xe2\x80\x9chave you no idea\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was serious all of a sudden. She raised my head in her hands, and\r\nwith a violent gesture drew me to her breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda,\xe2\x80\x9d I stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you enjoy suffering,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and laughed again, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwait, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you to your senses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will no longer ask,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether you want to belong to\r\nme for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication. I want to\r\ndrain my happiness to the full. You are mine now, and I would rather\r\nlose you than never to have had you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you are sensible,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She kissed me again with her\r\nmurderous lips. I tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace and\r\nher naked breast surged against mine.\r\n\r\nThen my senses left me\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe first thing I remember is the moment when I saw blood dripping from\r\nmy hand, and she asked apathetically: \xe2\x80\x9cDid you scratch me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I believe, I have bitten you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face as\r\nsoon as a new person enters.\r\n\r\nWe spent marvellous days together; we visited the mountains and lakes,\r\nwe read together, and I completed Wanda\xe2\x80\x99s portrait. And how we loved\r\none another, how beautiful her smiling face was!\r\n\r\nThen a friend of hers arrived, a divorced woman somewhat older, more\r\nexperienced, and less scrupulous than Wanda. Her influence is already\r\nmaking itself felt in every direction.\r\n\r\nWanda wrinkles her brows, and displays a certain impatience with me.\r\n\r\nHas she ceased loving me?\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon us. Her\r\nfriend lives with her, and we are never alone. A circle of men\r\nsurrounds the young women. With my seriousness and melancholy I am\r\nplaying an absurd role as lover. Wanda treats me like a stranger.\r\n\r\nTo-day, while out walking, she staid behind with me. I saw that this\r\nwas done intentionally, and I rejoiced. But what did she tell me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand how I can love you. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\r\neither handsome or particularly attractive otherwise. She is telling me\r\nfrom morning till night about the glamour of the frivolous life in the\r\ncapital, hinting at the advantages to which I could lay claim, the\r\nlarge parties which I would find there, and the distinguished and\r\nhandsome admirers which I would attract. But of what use is all this,\r\nsince it happens that I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment I lost my breath, then I said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish to stand in\r\nthe way of your happiness, Wanda. Do not consider me.\xe2\x80\x9d Then I raised my\r\nhat, and let her go ahead. She looked at me surprised, but did not\r\nanswer a syllable.\r\n\r\nWhen by chance I happened to be close to her on the way back, she\r\nsecretly pressed my hand. Her glance was so radiant, so full of\r\npromised happiness, that in a moment all the torments of these days\r\nwere forgotten and all their wounds healed.\r\n\r\nI now am aware again of how much I love her.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend has complained about you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda to-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she feels that I despise her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why do you despise her, you foolish young man?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wanda,\r\npulling my ears with both hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she is a hypocrite,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI respect only a woman who is\r\nactually virtuous, or who openly lives for pleasure\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike me, for instance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wanda jestingly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you see, child,\r\na woman can only do that in the rarest cases. She can neither be as\r\ngaily sensual, nor as spiritually free as man; her state is always a\r\nmixture of the sensual and spiritual. Her heart desires to enchain man\r\npermanently, while she herself is ever subject to the desire for\r\nchange. The result is a conflict, and thus usually against her wishes\r\nlies and deception enter into her actions and personality and corrupt\r\nher character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly that is true,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe transcendental character with\r\nwhich woman wants to stamp love leads her to deception.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the world likewise demands it,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at this\r\nwoman. She has a husband and a lover in Lemberg and has found a new\r\nadmirer here. She deceives all three and yet is honored by all and\r\nrespected by the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cbut she is to leave you alone; she treats\r\nyou like an article of commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery woman\r\nhas the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractions,\r\nand much is to be said for giving one\xe2\x80\x99s self without love or pleasure\r\nbecause if you do it in cold blood, you can reap profit to best\r\nadvantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda, what are you saying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand take note of what I am about to say to you.\r\n_Never feel secure with the woman you love,_ for there are more dangers\r\nin woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature than you imagine. Women are neither as _good_ as\r\ntheir admirers and defenders maintain, nor as _bad_ as their enemies\r\nmake them out to be. _Woman\xe2\x80\x99s character is characterlessness._ The best\r\nwoman will momentarily go down into the mire, and the worst\r\nunexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to shame\r\nthose that despise her. No woman is so good or so bad, but that at any\r\nmoment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of the most\r\ndivine, of the filthiest as well as of the purest, thoughts, emotions,\r\nand actions. In spite of all the advances of civilization, woman has\r\nremained as she came out of the hand of nature. She has the nature of a\r\nsavage, who is faithful or faithless, magnanimous or cruel, according\r\nto the impulse that dominates at the moment. Throughout history it has\r\nalways been a serious deep culture which has produced moral character.\r\nMan even when he is selfish or evil always follows _principles,_ woman\r\nnever follows anything but _impulses._ Don\xe2\x80\x99t ever forget that, and\r\nnever feel secure with the woman you love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHer friend has left. At last an evening alone with her again. It seems\r\nas if Wanda had saved up all the love, which had been kept from her,\r\nfor this superlative evening; never had she been so kind, so near, so\r\nfull of tenderness.\r\n\r\nWhat happiness to cling to her lips, and to die away in her arms! In a\r\nstate of relaxation and wholly mine, her head rests against my breast,\r\nand with drunken rapture our eyes seek each other.\r\n\r\nI cannot yet believe, comprehend, that this woman is mine, wholly mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is right on one point,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda began, without moving, without\r\nopening her eyes, as if she were asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is right, you are not a man, you are a dreamer, a\r\ncharming cavalier, and you certainly would be a priceless slave, but I\r\ncannot imagine you as husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? You are trembling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tremble at the thought of how easily I might lose you,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you made less happy now, because of this?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes it\r\nrob you of any of your joys, that I have belonged to another before I\r\ndid to you, that others after you will possess me, and would you enjoy\r\nless if another were made happy simultaneously with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat would be a way out. You won\xe2\x80\x99t ever lose\r\nme then. I care deeply for you and intellectually we are harmonious,\r\nand I should like to live with you always, if in addition to you I\r\nmight have\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an idea,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou fill me with a sort of horror.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love me any the less?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda had raised herself on her left arm. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nto hold a man permanently, it is vitally important not to be faithful\r\nto him. What honest woman has ever been as devotedly loved as a\r\nhetaira?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a beloved woman.\r\nIt is the highest kind of ecstacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you, too?\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I should give you that pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda exclaimed mockingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall suffer terrible agonies, but I shall adore you the more,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you would never deceive me, you would have the daemonic\r\ngreatness of saying to me: I shall love no one but you, but I shall\r\nmake happy whoever pleases me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like deception, I am honest, but what\r\nman exists who can support the burden of truth. Were I say to you: this\r\nserene, sensual life, this paganism is my ideal, would you be strong\r\nenough to bear it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. I could endure anything so as not to lose you. I feel how\r\nlittle I really mean to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Severin\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is so,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand just for that reason\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor that reason you would\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled roguishly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chave I guessed it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe your slave!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cBe your unrestricted property, without a\r\nwill of my own, of which you could dispose as you wished, and which\r\nwould therefore never be a burden to you. While you drink life at its\r\nfullness, while surrounded by luxury, you enjoy the serene happiness\r\nand Olympian love, I want to be your servant, put on and take off your\r\nshoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really aren\xe2\x80\x99t so far from wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wanda, \xe2\x80\x9cfor only as my\r\nslave could you endure my loving others. Furthermore the freedom of\r\nenjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery. It must\r\ngive one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel before one and\r\ntremble. I want a slave, do you hear, Severin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I not your slave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen listen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda excitedly, seizing my hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to\r\nbe yours, as long as I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA month?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, even two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you become my slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Why do you ask? I am a goddess and sometimes I descend from my\r\nOlympian heights to you, softly, very softly, and secretly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what does all this mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, resting her head in both\r\nhands with her gaze lost in the distance, \xe2\x80\x9ca golden fancy which never\r\ncan become true.\xe2\x80\x9d An uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over her\r\nentire being; I have never seen her like that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy unachievable?\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause slavery doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we will go to a country where it still exists, to the Orient, to\r\nTurkey,\xe2\x80\x9d I said eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would\xe2\x80\x94Severin\xe2\x80\x94in all seriousness,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda replied. Her eyes burned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in all seriousness, I want to be your slave,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant your power over me to be sanctified by law; I want my life to be\r\nin your hands, I want nothing that could protect or save me from you.\r\nOh, what a voluptuous joy when once I feel myself entirely dependent\r\nupon your absolute will, your whim, at your beck and call. And then\r\nwhat happiness, when at some time you deign to be gracious, and the\r\nslave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him.\xe2\x80\x9d I knelt\r\ndown, and leaned my burning forehead against her knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are talking as in a fever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda agitatedly, \xe2\x80\x9cand you really\r\nlove me so endlessly.\xe2\x80\x9d She held me to her breast, and covered me with\r\nkisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really want it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear to you now by God and my honor, that I shall be your slave,\r\nwherever and whenever you wish it, as soon as you command,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nexclaimed, hardly master of myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I take you at your word?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this appeals to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said then. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is different from anything\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x94to know that a man who worships me, and whom I love with all my\r\nheart, is so wholly mine, dependent on my will and caprice, my\r\npossession and slave, while I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked strangely at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt almost seems as if you were afraid of me already, but\r\nyou have sworn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall keep my oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall see to that,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI am beginning to enjoy it, and,\r\nheaven help me, we won\xe2\x80\x99t stick to fancies now. You shall become my\r\nslave, and I\xe2\x80\x94I shall try to be _Venus in Furs_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI thought that at last I knew this woman, understood her, and now I see\r\nI have to begin at the very beginning again. Only a little while ago\r\nher reaction to my dreams was violently hostile, and now she tries to\r\ncarry them into execution with the soberest seriousness.\r\n\r\nShe has drawn up a contract according to which I give my word of honor\r\nand agree under oath to be her slave, as long as she wishes.\r\n\r\nWith her arm around my neck she reads this, unprecedented, incredible\r\ndocument to me. The end of each sentence she punctuates with a kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut all the obligations in the contract are on my side,\xe2\x80\x9d I said,\r\nteasing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with great seriousness, \xe2\x80\x9cyou cease to be my\r\nlover, and consequently I am released from all duties and obligations\r\ntowards you. You will have to look upon my favors as pure benevolence.\r\nYou no longer have any rights, and no longer can lay claim to any.\r\nThere can be no limit to my power over you. Remember, that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nmuch better than a dog, or some inanimate object. You will be mine, my\r\nplaything, which I can break to pieces, whenever I want an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\namusement. You are nothing, I am everything. Do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlaughed and kissed me again, and yet a sort of cold shiver ran through\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you allow me a few conditions\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConditions?\xe2\x80\x9d She contracted her forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! You are afraid already,\r\nor perhaps you regret, but it is too late now. You have sworn, I have\r\nyour word of honor. But let me hear them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all I should like to have it included in our contract, that\r\nyou will never completely leave me, and then that you will never give\r\nme over to the mercies of any of your admirers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Severin,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wanda with her voice full of emotion and with\r\ntears in her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you imagine that I\xe2\x80\x94and you, a man who loves\r\nme so absolutely, who puts himself so entirely in my power\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nhalted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, covering her hands with kisses. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t fear\r\nanything from you that might dishonor me. Forgive me the ugly thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda smiled happily, leaned her cheek against mine, and seemed to\r\nreflect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have forgotten something,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered coquettishly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most\r\nimportant thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that I must always wear my furs,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wanda. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I promise\r\nyou I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that anyhow because they give me a despotic feeling. And I\r\nshall be very cruel to you, do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I sign the contract?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall first add your conditions, and the\r\nactual signing won\xe2\x80\x99t occur until the proper time and place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Constantinople?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I have thought things over. What special value would there be in\r\nowning a slave where everyone owns slaves. What I want is to _have a\r\nslave, I alone,_ here in our civilized sober, Philistine world, and a\r\nslave who submits helplessly to my power solely on account of my beauty\r\nand personality, not because of law, of property rights, or\r\ncompulsions. This attracts me. But at any rate we will go to a country\r\nwhere we are not known and where you can appear before the world as my\r\nservant without embarrassment. Perhaps to Italy, to Rome or Naples.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were sitting on Wanda\xe2\x80\x99s ottoman. She wore her ermine jacket, her\r\nhair was loose and fell like a lion\xe2\x80\x99s mane down her back. She clung to\r\nmy lips, drawing my soul from my body. My head whirled, my blood began\r\nto seethe, my heart beat violently against hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be absolutely in your power, Wanda,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed suddenly,\r\nseized by that frenzy of passion when I can scarcely think clearly or\r\ndecide freely. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to put myself absolutely at your mercy for good\r\nor evil without any condition, without any limit to your power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile saying this I had slipped from the ottoman, and lay at her feet\r\nlooking up at her with drunken eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful you now are,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cyour eyes half-broken in\r\necstacy fill me with joy, carry me away. How wonderful your look would\r\nbe if you were being beaten to death, in the extreme agony. You have\r\nthe eye of a martyr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSometimes, nevertheless, I have an uneasy feeling about placing myself\r\nso absolutely, so unconditionally into a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Suppose she did\r\nabuse my passion, her power?\r\n\r\nWell, then I would experience what has occupied my imagination since my\r\nchildhood, what has always given me the feeling of seductive terror. A\r\nfoolish apprehension! It will be a wanton game she will play with me,\r\nnothing more. She loves me, and she is good, a noble personality,\r\nincapable of a breach of faith. But it lies in her hands \xe2\x80\x94_if she wants\r\nto she can._ What a temptation in this doubt, this fear!\r\n\r\nNow I understand Manon l\xe2\x80\x99Escault and the poor chevalier, who, even in\r\nthe pillory, while she was another man\xe2\x80\x99s mistress, still adored her.\r\n\r\nLove knows no virtue, no profit; it loves and forgives and suffers\r\neverything, because it must. It is not our judgment that leads us; it\r\nis neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover, that make\r\nus abandon ourselves, or that repel us.\r\n\r\nIt is a sweet, soft, enigmatic power that drives us on. We cease to\r\nthink, to feel, to will; we let ourselves be carried away by it, and\r\nask not whither?\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade. He\r\naroused general interest on account of his athletic figure, magnificent\r\nface, and splendid bearing. The women particularly gaped at him as\r\nthough he were a wild animal, but he went his way gloomily without\r\npaying attention to any one. He was accompanied by two servants, one a\r\nnegro, completely dressed in red satin, and the other a Circassian in\r\nhis full gleaming uniform. Suddenly he saw Wanda, and fixed his cold\r\npiercing look upon her; he even turned his head after her, and when she\r\nhad passed, he stood still and followed her with his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd she\xe2\x80\x94she veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyes\xe2\x80\x94and did\r\neverything possible to meet him again.\r\n\r\nThe cunning coquetry with which she walked, moved, and looked at him,\r\nalmost stifled me. On the way home I remarked about it. She knit her\r\nbrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe prince is a man whom I might like,\r\nwho even dazzles me, and I am free. I can do what I please\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you love me any longer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I stammered, frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love only you,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shall have the prince pay court\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you my slave?\xe2\x80\x9d she said calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I not Venus, the cruel\r\nnorthern Venus in Furs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was silent. I felt literally crushed by her words; her cold look\r\nentered my heart like a dagger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find out immediately the prince\xe2\x80\x99s name, residence, and\r\ncircumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo argument, obey!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wanda, more sternly than I would have\r\nthought possible for her, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t dare to enter my sight until you\r\ncan answer my questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not till afternoon that I could obtain the desired information\r\nfor Wanda. She let me stand before her like a servant, while she leaned\r\nback in her arm-chair and listened to me, smiling. Then she nodded; she\r\nseemed to be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me my footstool,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded shortly.\r\n\r\nI obeyed, and after having put it before her and having put her feet on\r\nit, I remained kneeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will this end?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked sadly after a short pause.\r\n\r\nShe broke into playful laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy things haven\xe2\x80\x99t even begun yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are more heartless than I imagined,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, hurt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeverin,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda began earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t done anything yet, not the\r\nslightest thing, and you are already calling me heartless. What will\r\nhappen when I begin to carry your dreams to their realization, when I\r\nshall lead a gay, free life and have a circle of admirers about me,\r\nwhen I shall actually fulfil your ideal, tread you underfoot and apply\r\nthe lash?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take my dreams too seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo seriously? I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop at make-believe, when once I begin,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I hate all play-acting and comedy. You have wished\r\nit. Was it my idea or yours? Did I persuade you or did you inflame my\r\nimagination? I am taking things seriously now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, caressingly, \xe2\x80\x9clisten quietly to me. We love each\r\nother infinitely, we are very happy, will you sacrifice our entire\r\nfuture to a whim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no longer a whim,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething that was probably latent in me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly and\r\nthoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it would never have come to light, if you had\r\nnot called it to life, and made it grow. Now that it has become a\r\npowerful impulse, fills my whole being, now that I enjoy it, now that I\r\ncannot and do not want to do otherwise, now you want to back out\xe2\x80\x94\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94are you a man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, sweet Wanda!\xe2\x80\x9d I began to caress her, kiss her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94you are not a man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you,\xe2\x80\x9d I flared up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am stubborn,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know that. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a strong\r\nimagination, and like you I am weak in execution. But when I make up my\r\nmind to do something, I carry it through, and the more certainly, the\r\nmore opposition I meet. Leave me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pushed me away, and got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d I likewise rose, and stood facing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you know what I am,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce more I warn you. You\r\nstill have the choice. I am not compelling you to be my slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied with emotion and tears filling my eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow how I love you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer lips quivered contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken, you make yourself out worse than you are; you are\r\ngood and noble by nature\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about my nature,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted vehemently, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nwill get to know me as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecide, will you submit, unconditionally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I say no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stepped close up to me, cold and contemptuous. As she stood before\r\nme now, the arms folded across her breast, with an evil smile about her\r\nlips, she was in fact the despotic woman of my dreams. Her expression\r\nseemed hard, and nothing lay in her eyes that promised kindness or\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are angry,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will punish me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall let you go. You are free. I am not\r\nholding you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda\xe2\x80\x94I, who love you so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you, my dear sir, you who adore me,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed\r\ncontemptuously, \xe2\x80\x9cbut who are a coward, a liar, and a breaker of\r\npromises. Leave me instantly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy blood rose in my heart. I threw myself down at her feet and began to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTears, too!\xe2\x80\x9d She began to laugh. Oh, this laughter was frightful.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh my God!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, beside myself. \xe2\x80\x9cI will do whatever you command,\r\nbe your slave, a mere object with which you can do what you will\xe2\x80\x94only\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t send me away\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it\xe2\x80\x94I cannot live without you.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nembraced her knees, and covered her hand with kisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you must be a slave, and feel the lash, for you are not a man,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said calmly. She said this to me with perfect composure, not\r\nangrily, not even excitedly, and it was what hurt most. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I know\r\nyou, your dog-like nature, that adores where it is kicked, and the\r\nmore, the more it is maltreated. Now I know you, and now you shall come\r\nto know me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked up and down with long strides, while I remained crushed on\r\nmy knees; my head was hanging supine, tears flowed from my eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda commanded harshly, sitting down on the ottoman. I\r\nobeyed her command, and sat down beside her. She looked at me sombrely,\r\nand then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interior of her eye.\r\nSmiling, she drew me toward her breast, and began to kiss the tears out\r\nof my eyes.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe odd part of my situation is that I am like the bear in Lily\xe2\x80\x99s park.\r\nI can escape and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to; I am ready to endure everything as soon\r\nas she threatens to set me free.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf only she would use the whip again. There is something uncanny in the\r\nkindness with which she treats me. I seem like a little captive mouse\r\nwith which a beautiful cat prettily plays. She is ready at any moment\r\nto tear it to pieces, and my heart of a mouse threatens to burst.\r\n\r\nWhat are her intentions? What does she purpose to do with me?\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seems she has completely forgotten the contract, my slavehood. Or\r\nwas it actually only stubbornness? And she gave up her whole plan as\r\nsoon as I no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whim?\r\n\r\nHow kind she is to me, how tender, how loving! We are spending\r\nmarvellously happy days.\r\n\r\nTo-day she had me read to her the scene between Faust and\r\nMephistopheles, in which the latter appears as a wandering scholar. Her\r\nglance hung on me with strange pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said when I had finished, \xe2\x80\x9chow a man who can\r\nread such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression, and\r\ninterpret them so clearly, concisely, and intelligently, can at the\r\nsame time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you pleased,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, and kissed her forehead.\r\n\r\nShe gently stroked my brow. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you, Severin,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe I could ever love any one more than you. Let us be\r\nsensible, what do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of replying I folded her in my arms; a deep inward, yet vaguely\r\nsad happiness filled my breast, my eyes grew moist, and a tear fell\r\nupon her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you cry!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn a pleasure drive we met the Russian prince in his carriage. He\r\nseemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by Wanda\xe2\x80\x99s side, and\r\nlooked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with his\r\nelectric gray eyes. She, however, did not seem to notice him. I felt at\r\nthat moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feet. She let\r\nher glance glide over him indifferently as though he were an inanimate\r\nobject, a tree, for instance, and turned to me with her gracious smile.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I said good-night to her to-day she seemed suddenly unaccountably\r\ndistracted and moody. What was occupying her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you are going,\xe2\x80\x9d she said when I was already standing on the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of my trial,\r\nto cease tormenting me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you imagine that this compulsion isn\xe2\x80\x99t a torment for me, too,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWanda interjected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen end it,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, embracing her, \xe2\x80\x9cbe my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Never, Severin_,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gently, but with great firmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was frightened in my innermost soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You are not the man for me._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at her, and slowly withdrew my arm which was still about her\r\nwaist; then I left the room, and she\xe2\x80\x94she did not call me back.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA sleepless night; I made countless decisions, only to toss them aside\r\nagain. In the morning I wrote her a letter in which I declared our\r\nrelationship dissolved. My hand trembled when I put on the seal, and I\r\nburned my fingers.\r\n\r\nAs I went upstairs to hand it to the maid, my knees threatened to give\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Wanda thrust forth her head full of\r\ncurling-papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t had my hair dressed yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you want to break with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, mockingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me yesterday that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the man for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat it now!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then.\xe2\x80\x9d My whole body was trembling, my voice failed me, and\r\nI handed her the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, measuring me coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou forget that is no longer\r\na question as to whether you satisfy me as a man; as a _slave_ you will\r\ndoubtless do well enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, aghast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what you will call me in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wanda, throwing\r\nback her head with a movement of unutterable contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cPut your\r\naffairs in order within the next twenty-four hours. The day after\r\nto-morrow I shall start for Italy, and you will accompany me as my\r\nservant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forbid any sort of familiarity,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, cutting my words short,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clikewise you are not to come in unless I call or ring for you, and you\r\nare not to speak to me until you are spoken to. From now on your name\r\nis no longer Severin, but _Gregor_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI trembled with rage, and yet, unfortunately, I cannot deny it, I also\r\nfelt a strange pleasure and stimulation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, madame, you know my circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d I began in my confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam dependent on my father, and I doubt whether he will give me the\r\nlarge sum of money needed for this journey\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means you have no money, Gregor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, delightedly, \xe2\x80\x9cso\r\nmuch the better, you are then entirely dependent on me, and in fact my\r\nslave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t consider,\xe2\x80\x9d I tried to object, \xe2\x80\x9cthat as man of honor it is\r\nimpossible for me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have indeed considered it,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied almost with a tone of\r\ncommand. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a man of honor you must keep your oath and redeem your\r\npromise to follow me as slave whithersoever I demand and to obey\r\nwhatever I command. Now leave me, Gregor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned toward the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet\xe2\x80\x94you may first kiss my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d She held it out to me with a\r\ncertain proud indifference, and I the dilettante, the donkey, the\r\nmiserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips\r\nwhich were dry and hot with excitement.\r\n\r\nThere was another gracious nod of the head.\r\n\r\nThen I was dismissed.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough it was late in the evening my light was still lit, and a fire\r\nwas burning in the large green stove. There were still many things\r\namong my letters and documents to be put in order. Autumn, as is\r\nusually the case with us, had fallen with all its power.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she knocked at my window with the handle of her whip.\r\n\r\nI opened and saw her standing outside in her ermine-lined jacket and in\r\na high round Cossack cap of ermine of the kind which the great\r\nCatherine favored.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready, Gregor?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked darkly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet, mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that word,\xe2\x80\x9d she said then, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are always to call me mistress,\r\ndo you understand? We leave here to-morrow morning at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. As\r\nfar as the district capital you will be my companion and friend, but\r\nfrom the moment that we enter the railway-coach you are my slave, my\r\nservant. Now close the window, and open the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter I had done as she had demanded, and after she had entered, she\r\nasked, contracting her brows ironically, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, how do you like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda, you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave you permission?\xe2\x80\x9d She gave me a blow with the whip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very beautiful, mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda smiled and sat down in the arm-chair. \xe2\x80\x9cKneel down\xe2\x80\x94here beside my\r\nchair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI seized her small cold hand and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the mouth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a surge of passion I threw my arms around the beautiful cruel woman,\r\nand covered her face, arms, and breast with glowing kisses. She\r\nreturned them with equal fervor\xe2\x80\x94the eyelids closed as in a dream. It\r\nwas after midnight when she left.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock sharp in the morning everything was ready for\r\ndeparture, as she had ordered. We left the little Carpathian\r\nhealth-resort in a comfortable light carriage. The most interesting\r\ndrama of my life had reached a point of development whose denouement it\r\nwas then impossible to foretell.\r\n\r\nSo far everything went well. I sat beside Wanda, and she chatted very\r\ngraciously and intelligently with me, as with a good friend, concerning\r\nItaly, Pisemski\xe2\x80\x99s new novel, and Wagner\xe2\x80\x99s music. She wore a sort of\r\nAmazonesque travelling-dress of black cloth with a short jacket of the\r\nsame material, set with dark fur. It fitted closely and showed her\r\nfigure to best advantage. Over it she wore dark furs. Her hair wound\r\ninto an antique knot, lay beneath a small dark fur-hat from which a\r\nblack veil hung. Wanda was in very good humor; she fed me candies,\r\nplayed with my hair, loosened my neck cloth and made a pretty cockade\r\nof it; she covered my knees with her furs and stealthily pressed the\r\nfingers of my hand. When our Jewish driver persistently went on nodding\r\nto himself, she even gave me a kiss, and her cold lips had the fresh\r\nfrosty fragrance of a young autumnal rose, which blossoms alone amid\r\nbare stalks and yellow leaves and upon whose calyx the first frost has\r\nhung tiny diamonds of ice.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are at the district capital. We get out at the railway station.\r\nWanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm, and goes to\r\nsecure the tickets.\r\n\r\nWhen she returns she has completely changed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is your ticket, Gregor,\xe2\x80\x9d she says in a tone which supercilious\r\nladies use to their servants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA third-class ticket,\xe2\x80\x9d I reply with comic horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d she continues, \xe2\x80\x9cbut now be careful. You won\xe2\x80\x99t get on until\r\nI am settled in my compartment and don\xe2\x80\x99t need you any longer. At each\r\nstation you will hurry to my car and ask for my orders. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget.\r\nAnd now give me my furs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter I had helped her into them, humbly like a slave, she went to find\r\nan empty first-class coupe. I followed. Supporting herself on my\r\nshoulder, she got on and I wrapped her feet in bear-skins and placed\r\nthem on the warming bottle.\r\n\r\nThen she nodded to me, and dismissed me. I slowly ascended a\r\nthird-class carriage, which was filled with abominable tobacco-smoke\r\nthat seemed like the fogs of Acheron at the entrance to Hades. I now\r\nhad the leisure to muse about the riddle of human existence, and about\r\nits greatest riddle of all\xe2\x80\x94_woman_.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhenever the train stops, I jump off, run to her carriage, and with\r\ndrawn cap await her orders. She wants coffee and then a glass of water,\r\nat another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands, and thus it\r\ngoes on. She lets several men who have entered her compartment pay\r\ncourt to her. I am dying of jealousy and have to leap about like an\r\nantelope so as to secure what she wants quickly and not miss the train.\r\n\r\nIn this way the night passes. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had time to eat a mouthful and\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, I have to breathe the same oniony air with Polish\r\npeasants, Jewish peddlers, and common soldiers.\r\n\r\nWhen I mount the steps of her coupe, she is lying stretched out on\r\ncushions in her comfortable furs, covered up with the skins of animals.\r\nShe is like an oriental despot, and the men sit like Indian deities,\r\nstraight upright against the walls and scarcely dare to breathe.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe stops over in Vienna for a day to go shopping, and particularly to\r\nbuy series of luxurious gowns. She continues to treat me as her\r\nservant. I follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces. She\r\nhands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind look, and\r\nladen down like a donkey I pant along behind.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotel\r\nwaiters. I am ordered to put on her livery. It is a Cracovian costume\r\nin her colors, light-blue with red facings, and red quadrangular cap,\r\nornamented with peacock-feathers. The costume is rather becoming to me.\r\n\r\nThe silver buttons bear her coat of arms. I have the feeling of having\r\nbeen sold or of having bonded myself to the devil. My fair demon leads\r\nme from Vienna to Florence. Instead of linen-garbed Mazovians and\r\ngreasy-haired Jews, my companions now are curly-haired Contadini, a\r\nmagnificent sergeant of the first Italian Grenadiers, and a poor German\r\npainter. The tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions, but of salami\r\nand cheese.\r\n\r\nNight has fallen again. I lie on my wooden bed as on a rack; my arms\r\nand legs seem broken. But there nevertheless is an element of poetry in\r\nthe affair. The stars sparkle round about, the Italian sergeant has a\r\nface like Apollo Belvedere, and the German painter sings a lovely\r\nGerman song.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that all the shadows gather\r\nAnd endless stars grow light,\r\nDeep yearning on me falls\r\nAnd softly fills the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough the sea of dreams\r\nSailing without cease,\r\nSailing goes my soul\r\nIn thine to find release.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal\r\ncomfort among her soft furs.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlorence! Crowds, cries, importunate porters and cab-drivers. Wanda\r\nchooses a carriage, and dismisses the porters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I a servant for,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cGregor\xe2\x80\x94here is the ticket\xe2\x80\x94get\r\nthe luggage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while I\r\ndrag the heavy trunks hither, one after another. I break down for a\r\nmoment under the last one; a good-natured _carabiniere_ with an\r\nintelligent face comes to my assistance. She laughs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be heavy,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9call my furs are in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI get up on the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, wiping drops of perspiration from my\r\nbrow. She gives the name of the hotel, and the driver urges on his\r\nhorse. In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks the portier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo for me, one for my servant, all with stoves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo first-class rooms for you, madame, both with stoves,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nwaiter who had hastily come up, \xe2\x80\x9cand one without heat for your\r\nservant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at them, and then abruptly said: \xe2\x80\x9cthey are satisfactory,\r\nhave fires built at once; my servant can sleep in the unheated room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI merely looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring up the trunks, Gregor,\xe2\x80\x9d she commands, paying no attention to my\r\nlooks. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime I\xe2\x80\x99ll be dressing, and then will go down to the\r\ndining-room, and you can eat something for supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she goes into the adjoining room, I drag the trunks upstairs and\r\nhelp the waiter build a fire in her bed-room. He tries to question me\r\nin bad French about my employer. With a brief glance I see the blazing\r\nfire, the fragrant white poster-bed, and the rugs which cover the\r\nfloor. Tired and hungry I then descend the stairs, and ask for\r\nsomething to eat. A good-natured waiter, who used to be in the Austrian\r\narmy and takes all sorts of pains to entertain me in German, shows me\r\nthe dining-room and waits on me. I have just had the first fresh drink\r\nin thirty-six hours and the first bite of warm food on my fork, when\r\nshe enters.\r\n\r\nI rise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by taking me into a dining-room in which my servant\r\nis eating,\xe2\x80\x9d she snaps at the waiter, flaring with anger. She turns\r\naround and leaves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I thank heaven that I am permitted to go on eating. Later I\r\nclimb the four flights upstairs to my room. My small trunk is already\r\nthere, and a miserable little oil-lamp is burning. It is a narrow room\r\nwithout fire-place, without a window, but with a small air-hole. If it\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t so beastly cold, it would remind me of one of the Venetian\r\n_piombi_.4 Involuntarily I have to laugh out aloud, so that it\r\nre-echoes, and I am startled by my own laughter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: These were notorious prisons under the leaden roof of the\r\nPalace of the Doges.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door is pulled open and the waiter with a theatrical\r\nItalian gesture calls \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to come down to madame, at once.\xe2\x80\x9d I pick\r\nup my cap, stumble down the first few steps, but finally arrive in\r\nfront of her door on the first floor and knock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI enter, shut the door, and stand attention.\r\n\r\nWanda has made herself comfortable. She is sitting in a neglige of\r\nwhite muslin and laces on a small red divan with her feet on a\r\nfootstool that matches. She has thrown her fur-cloak about her. It is\r\nthe identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time, as\r\ngoddess of love.\r\n\r\nThe yellow lights of the candelabra which stand on projections, their\r\nreflections in the large mirrors, and the red flames from the open\r\nfireplace play beautifully on the green velvet, the dark-brown sable of\r\nthe cloak, the smooth white skin, and the red, flaming hair of the\r\nbeautiful woman. Her clear, but cold face is turned toward me, and her\r\ncold green eyes rest upon me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am satisfied with you, Gregor,\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\nI bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome closer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill closer,\xe2\x80\x9d she looked down, and stroked the sable with her hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVenus in Furs receives her slave. I can see that you are more than an\r\nordinary dreamer, you don\xe2\x80\x99t remain far in arrears of your dreams; you\r\nare the sort of man who is ready to carry his dreams into effect, no\r\nmatter how mad they are. I confess, I like this; it impresses me. There\r\nis strength in this, and strength is the only thing one respects. I\r\nactually believe that under unusual circumstances, in a period of great\r\ndeeds, what seems to be your weakness would reveal itself as\r\nextraordinary power. Under the early emperors you would have been a\r\nmartyr, at the time of the Reformation an anabaptist, during the French\r\nRevolution one of those inspired Girondists who mounted the guillotine\r\nwith the marseillaise on their lips. But you are my slave, my\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe suddenly leaped up; the furs slipped down, and she threw her arms\r\nwith soft pressure about my neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy beloved slave, Severin, oh, how I love you, how I adore you, how\r\nhandsome you are in your Cracovian costume! You will be cold to-night\r\nup in your wretched room without a fire. Shall I give you one of my\r\nfurs, dear heart, the large one there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe quickly picked it up, throwing it over my shoulders, and before I\r\nknew what had happened I was completely wrapped up in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow wonderfully becoming furs are to your face, they bring out your\r\nnoble lines. As soon as you cease being my slave, you must wear a\r\nvelvet coat with sable, do you understand? Otherwise I shall never put\r\non my fur-jacket again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd again she began to caress me and kiss me; finally she drew me down\r\non the little divan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be pleased with yourself in furs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick,\r\nquick, give them to me, or I will lose all sense of dignity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI placed the furs about her, and Wanda slipped her right arm into the\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the pose in Titian\xe2\x80\x99s picture. But now enough of joking. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nalways look so solemn, it makes me feel sad. As far as the world is\r\nconcerned you are still merely my servant; you are not yet my slave,\r\nfor you have not yet signed the contract. You are still free, and can\r\nleave me any moment. You have played your part magnificently. I have\r\nbeen delighted, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t you tired of it already, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nI am abominable? Well, say something\xe2\x80\x94I command it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I confess to you, Wanda?\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if you take advantage of it,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall love you the\r\nmore deeply, adore you the more fanatically, the worse you treat me.\r\nWhat you have just done inflames my blood and intoxicates all my\r\nsenses.\xe2\x80\x9d I held her close to me and clung for several moments to her\r\nmoist lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you beautiful woman,\xe2\x80\x9d I then exclaimed, looking at her. In my\r\nenthusiasm I tore the sable from her shoulders and pressed my mouth\r\nagainst her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love me even when I am cruel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, \xe2\x80\x9cnow go!\xe2\x80\x94you bore\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe boxed my ears so that I saw stars and bells rang in my ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me into my furs, slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI helped her, as well as I could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow awkward,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, and was scarcely in it before she struck\r\nme in the face again. I felt myself growing pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I hurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, softly touching me with her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate you have no reason to complain, you want it thus; now kiss\r\nme again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI threw my arms about her, and her lips clung closely to mine. As she\r\nlay against my breast in her large heavy furs, I had a curiously\r\noppressive sensation. It was as if a wild beast, a she-bear, were\r\nembracing me. It seemed as if I were about to feel her claws in my\r\nflesh. But this time the she-bear let me off easily.\r\n\r\nWith my heart filled with smiling hopes, I went up to my miserable\r\nservant\xe2\x80\x99s room, and threw myself down on my hard couch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife is really amazingly droll,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought. \xe2\x80\x9cA short time ago the most\r\nbeautiful woman, Venus herself, rested against your breast, and now you\r\nhave an opportunity for studying the Chinese hell. Unlike us, they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t hurl the damned into flames, but they have devils chasing them\r\nout into fields of ice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely the founders of their religion also slept in unheated\r\nrooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the night I startled out of my sleep with a scream. I had been\r\ndreaming of an icefield in which I had lost my way; I had been looking\r\nin vain for a way out. Suddenly an eskimo drove up in a sleigh\r\nharnessed with reindeer; he had the face of the waiter who had shown me\r\nto the unheated room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you looking for here, my dear sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nthe North Pole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment later he had disappeared, and Wanda flew over the smooth ice\r\non tiny skates. Her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled; the\r\nermine of her jacket and cap, but especially her face, gleamed whiter\r\nthan the snow. She shot toward me, inclosed me in her arms, and began\r\nto kiss me. Suddenly I felt my blood running warm down my side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked horror-stricken.\r\n\r\nShe laughed, and as I looked at her now, it was no longer Wanda, but a\r\nhuge, white she-bear, who was digging her paws into my body.\r\n\r\nI cried out in despair, and still heard her diabolical laughter when I\r\nawoke, and looked about the room in surprise.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning I stood at Wanda\xe2\x80\x99s door, and the waiter brought\r\nthe coffee. I took it from him, and served it to my beautiful mistress.\r\nShe had already dressed, and looked magnificent, all fresh and roseate.\r\nShe smiled graciously at me and called me back, when I was about to\r\nwithdraw respectfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Gregor, have your breakfast quickly too,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthen we\r\nwill go house-hunting. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stay in the hotel any longer\r\nthan I have to. It is very embarassing here. If I chat with you for\r\nmore than a minute, people will immediately say: \xe2\x80\x98The fair Russian is\r\nhaving an affair with her servant, you see, the race of Catherines\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t extinct yet.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later we went out; Wanda was in her cloth-gown with the\r\nRussian cap, and I in my Cracovian costume. We created quite a stir. I\r\nwalked about ten paces behind, looking very solemn, but expected\r\nmomentarily to have to break out into loud laughter. There was scarcely\r\na street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not\r\nbear the sign _camere ammobiliate_. Wanda always sent me upstairs, and\r\nonly when the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she\r\nherself ascend. By noon I was as tired as a stag-hound after the hunt.\r\n\r\nWe entered a new house and left it again without having found a\r\nsuitable habitation. Wanda was already somewhat out of humor. Suddenly\r\nshe said to me: \xe2\x80\x9cSeverin, the seriousness with which you play your part\r\nis charming, and the restrictions, which we have placed upon each other\r\nare really annoying me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it any longer, I do love you, I\r\nmust kiss you. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go into one of the houses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my lady\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGregor?\xe2\x80\x9d She entered the next open corridor and ascended a few steps\r\nof the dark stair-way; then she threw her arms about me with passionate\r\ntenderness and kissed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Severin, you were very wise. You are much more dangerous as slave\r\nthan I would have imagined; you are positively irrestible, and I am\r\nafraid I shall have to fall in love with you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you love me any longer then,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked seized by a sudden fright.\r\n\r\nShe solemnly shook her head, but kissed me again with her swelling,\r\nadorable lips.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the hotel. Wanda had luncheon, and ordered me also\r\nquickly to get something to eat.\r\n\r\nOf course, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t served as quickly as she, and so it happened that\r\njust as I was carrying the second bite of my steak to my mouth, the\r\nwaiter entered and called out with his theatrical gesture: \xe2\x80\x9cMadame\r\nwants you, at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took a rapid and painful leave of my food, and, tired and hungry,\r\nhurried toward Wanda, who was already on the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have imagined you could be so cruel,\xe2\x80\x9d I said reproachfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all these, fatiguing duties you don\xe2\x80\x99t even leave me time to eat\r\nin peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda laughed gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had finished,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut never\r\nmind. Man was born to suffer, and you in particular. The martyrs didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave any beefsteaks either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed her resentfully, gnawing at my hunger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given up the idea of finding a place in the city,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be difficult to find an entire floor which is shut\r\noff and where you can do as you please. In such a strange, mad\r\nrelationship as ours there must be no jarring note. I shall rent an\r\nentire villa\xe2\x80\x94and you will be surprised. You have my permission now to\r\nsatisfy your hunger, and look about a bit in Florence. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be home\r\ntill evening. If I need you then, I will have you called.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at the Duomo, the Palazzo Vecchio, the Logia di Lanzi, and\r\nthen I stood for a long time on the banks of the Arno. Again and again\r\nI let my eyes rest on the magnificent ancient Florence, whose round\r\ncupolas and towers were drawn in soft lines against the blue, cloudless\r\nsky. I watched its splendid bridges beneath whose wide arches the\r\nlively waves of the beautiful, yellow river ran, and the green hills\r\nwhich surrounded the city, bearing slender cypresses and extensive\r\nbuildings, palaces and monasteries.\r\n\r\nIt is a different world, this one in which we are\xe2\x80\x94a gay, sensuous,\r\nsmiling world. The landscape too has nothing of the seriousness and\r\nsomberness of ours. It is a long ways off to the last white villas\r\nscattered among the pale green of the mountains, and yet there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nspot that isn\xe2\x80\x99t bright with sunlight. The people are less serious than\r\nwe; perhaps, they think less, but they all look as though they were\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nIt is also maintained that death is easier in the South.\r\n\r\nI have a vague feeling now that such a thing as beauty without thorn\r\nand love of the senses without torment does exist.\r\n\r\nWanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the\r\nwinter. It is situated on a charming hill on the left bank of the Arno,\r\nopposite the Cascine. It is surrounded by an attractive garden with\r\nlovely paths, grass plots, and magnificent meadow of camelias. It is\r\nonly two stories high, quadrangular in the Italian fashion. An open\r\ngallery runs along one side, a sort of loggia with plaster-casts of\r\nantique statues; stone steps lead from it down into the garden. From\r\nthe gallery you enter a bath with a magnificent marble basin, from\r\nwhich winding stairs lead to my mistress\xe2\x80\x99 bed-chamber.\r\n\r\nWanda occupies the second story by herself.\r\n\r\nA room on the ground floor has been assigned to me; it is very\r\nattractive, and even has a fireplace.\r\n\r\nI have roamed through the garden. On a round hillock I discovered a\r\nlittle temple, but I found its door locked. However, there is a chink\r\nin the door and when I glue my eye to it, I see the goddess of love on\r\na white pedestal.\r\n\r\nA slight shudder passes over me. It seems to me as if she were smiling\r\nat me saying: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you there? I have been expecting you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is evening. An attractive maid brings me orders to appear before my\r\nmistress. I ascend the wide marble stairs, pass through the anteroom, a\r\nlarge salon furnished with extravagant magnificence, and knock at the\r\ndoor of the bedroom. I knock very softly for the luxury displayed\r\neverywhere intimidates me. Consequently no one hears me, and I stand\r\nfor some time in front of the door. I have a feeling as if I were\r\nstanding before the bed-room of the great Catherine, and it seems as if\r\nat any moment she might come out in her green sleeping furs, with the\r\nred ribbon and decoration on her bare breast, and with her little white\r\npowdered curls.\r\n\r\nI knocked again. Wanda impatiently pulls the door open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so late?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was standing in front of the door, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear me knock,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nreply timidly. She closes the door, and clinging to me, she leads me to\r\nthe red damask ottoman on which she had been resting. The entire\r\narrangement of the room is in red damask\xe2\x80\x94wall-paper, curtains,\r\nportieres, hangings of the bed. A magnificent painting of Samson and\r\nDelilah forms the ceiling.\r\n\r\nWanda receives me in an intoxicating dishabille. Her white satin dress\r\nflows gracefully and picturesquely down her slender body, leaving her\r\narms and breast bare, and carelessly they nestle amid the dark hair of\r\nthe great fur of sable, lined with green velvet. Her red hair falls\r\ndown her back as far as the hips, only half held by strings of black\r\npearls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVenus in Furs,\xe2\x80\x9d I whisper, while she draws me to her breast and\r\nthreatens to stifle me with her kisses. Then I no longer speak and\r\nneither do I think; everything is drowned out in an ocean of unimagined\r\nbliss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you still love me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks, her eye softening in passionate\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou still remember your oath,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued with an alluring smile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnow that everything is prepared, everything in readiness, I ask you\r\nonce more, is it still your serious wish to become my slave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I not ready?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not yet signed the papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapers\xe2\x80\x94what papers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see, you want to give it up,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwell then, we will let\r\nit go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Wanda,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know that nothing gives me greater happiness\r\nthan to serve you, to be your slave. I would give everything for the\r\nsake of feeling myself wholly in your power, even unto death\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful you are,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you speak so\r\nenthusiastically, so passionately. I am more in love with you than ever\r\nand you want me to be dominant, stern, and cruel. I am afraid, it will\r\nbe impossible for me to be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are the papers?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that you may know what it means to be absolutely in my power, I\r\nhave drafted a second agreement in which you declare that you have\r\ndecided to kill yourself. In that way I can even kill you, if I so\r\ndesire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive them to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile I was unfolding the documents and reading them, Wanda got pen and\r\nink. She then sat down beside me with her arm about my neck, and looked\r\nover my shoulder at the paper.\r\n\r\nThe first one read:\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT BETWEEN MME. VON DUNAJEW AND SEVERIN VON KUSIEMSKI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeverin von Kusiemski ceases with the present day being the affianced\r\nof Mme. Wanda von Dunajew, and renounces all the rights appertaining\r\nthereunto; he on the contrary binds himself on his word of honor as a\r\nman and nobleman, that hereafter he will be her _slave_ until such time\r\nthat she herself sets him at liberty again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the slave of Mme. von Dunajew he is to bear the name Gregor, and he\r\nis unconditionally to comply with every one of her wishes, and to obey\r\nevery one of her commands; he is always to be submissive to his\r\nmistress, and is to consider her every sign of favor as an\r\nextraordinary mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMme. von Dunajew is entitled not only to punish her slave as she deems\r\nbest, even for the slightest inadvertence or fault, but also is\r\nherewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her or\r\nmerely for the sake of whiling away the time. Should she so desire, she\r\nmay kill him whenever she wishes; in short, he is her unrestricted\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould Mme. von Dunajew ever set her slave at liberty, Severin von\r\nKusiemski agrees to forget everything that he has experienced or\r\nsuffered as her slave, and promises _never under any circumstances and\r\nin no wise to think of vengeance or retaliation_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMme. von Dunajew on her behalf agrees as his mistress to appear as\r\noften as possible in her furs, especially when she purposes some\r\ncruelty toward her slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAppended at the bottom of the agreement was the date of the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe second document contained only a few words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving since many years become weary of existence and its illusions, I\r\nhave of my own free will put an end to my worthless life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was seized with a deep horror when I had finished. There was still\r\ntime, I could still withdraw, but the madness of passion and the sight\r\nof the beautiful woman that lay all relaxed against my shoulder carried\r\nme away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis one you will have to copy, Severin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, indicating the\r\nsecond document. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has to be entirely in your own handwriting; this,\r\nof course, isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary in the case of the agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI quickly copied the few lines in which I designated myself a suicide,\r\nand handed them to Wanda. She read them, and put them on the table with\r\na smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow have you the courage to sign it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked with a crafty smile,\r\ninclining her head.\r\n\r\nI took the pen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me sign first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, \xe2\x80\x9cyour hand is trembling, are you\r\nafraid of the happiness that is to be yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took the agreement and pen. While engaging in my internal struggle,\r\nI looked upward for a moment. It occurred to me that the painting on\r\nthe ceiling, like many of those of the Italian and Dutch schools, was\r\nutterly unhistorical, but this very fact gave it a strange mood which\r\nhad an almost uncanny effect on me. Delilah, an opulent woman with\r\nflaming red hair, lay extended, half-disrobed, in a dark fur-cloak,\r\nupon a red ottoman, and bent smiling over Samson who had been\r\noverthrown and bound by the Philistines. Her smile in its mocking\r\ncoquetry was full of a diabolical cruelty; her eyes, half-closed, met\r\nSamson\xe2\x80\x99s, and his with a last look of insane passion cling to hers, for\r\nalready one of his enemies is kneeling on his breast with the red-hot\r\niron to blind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy you are all lost in thought. What is the matter\r\nwith you, everything will remain just as it was, even after you have\r\nsigned, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me yet, dear heart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at the agreement. Her name was written there in bold letters.\r\nI peered once more into her eyes with their potent magic, then I took\r\nthe pen and quickly signed the agreement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are trembling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cshall I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gently took hold of my hand, and my name appeared at the bottom of\r\nthe second paper. Wanda looked once more at the two documents, and then\r\nlocked them in the desk which stood at the head of the ottoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, give me your passport and money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took out my wallet and handed it to her. She inspected it, nodded,\r\nand put it with other things while in a sweet drunkenness I kneeled\r\nbefore her leaning my head against her breast.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she thrusts me away with her foot, leaps up, and pulls the\r\nbell-rope. In answer to its sound three young, slender negresses enter;\r\nthey are as if carved of ebony, and are dressed from head to foot in\r\nred satin; each one has a rope in her hand.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I realize my position, and am about to rise. Wanda stands\r\nproudly erect, her cold beautiful face with its sombre brows and\r\ncontemptous eyes is turned toward me. She stands before me as mistress,\r\ncommanding, gives a sign with her hand, and before I really know what\r\nhas happened to me the negresses have dragged me to the ground, and\r\nhave tied me hand and foot. As in the case of one about to be executed\r\nmy arms are bound behind my back, so that I can scarcely move.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the whip, Hayd\xc3\xa9e,\xe2\x80\x9d commands Wanda, with unearthly calm.\r\n\r\nThe negress hands it to her mistress, kneeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now take off my heavy furs,\xe2\x80\x9d she continues, \xe2\x80\x9cthey impede me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe negress obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe jacket there!\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda commanded.\r\n\r\nHayd\xc3\xa9e quickly brought her the _kazabaika_, set with ermine, which lay\r\non the bed, and Wanda slipped into it with two inimitably graceful\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow tie him to the pillar here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe negresses lifted me up, and twisting a heavy rope around my body,\r\ntied me standing against one of the massive pillars which supported the\r\ntop of the wide Italian bed.\r\n\r\nThen they suddenly disappeared, as if the earth had swallowed them.\r\n\r\nWanda swiftly approached me. Her white satin dress flowed behind her in\r\na long train, like silver, like moonlight; her hair flared like flames\r\nagainst the white fur of her jacket. Now she stood in front of me with\r\nher left hand firmly planted on her hips, in her right hand she held\r\nthe whip. She uttered an abrupt laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow play has come to an end between us,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with heartless\r\ncoldness. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we will begin in dead earnest. You fool, I laugh at you\r\nand despise you; you who in your insane infatuation have given yourself\r\nas a plaything to _me_, the frivolous and capricious woman. You are no\r\nlonger the man I love, but _my slave_, at my mercy even unto life and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all you shall have a taste of the whip in all seriousness,\r\nwithout having done anything to deserve it, so that you may understand\r\nwhat to expect, if you are awkward, disobedient, or refractory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a wild grace she rolled back her fur-lined sleeve, and struck me\r\nacross the back.\r\n\r\nI winced, for the whip cut like a knife into my flesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how do you like that?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust wait, you will yet whine like a dog beneath my whip,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthreatened, and simultaneously began to strike me again.\r\n\r\nThe blows fell quickly, in rapid succession, with terrific force upon\r\nmy back, arms, and neck; I had to grit my teeth not to scream aloud.\r\nNow she struck me in the face, warm blood ran down, but she laughed,\r\nand continued her blows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only now I understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really is a joy\r\nto have some one so completely in one\xe2\x80\x99s power, and a man at that, who\r\nloves you\xe2\x80\x94you do love me?\xe2\x80\x94No\xe2\x80\x94Oh! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tear you to shreds yet, and with\r\neach blow my pleasure will grow. Now, twist like a worm, scream, whine!\r\nYou will find no mercy in me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinally she seemed tired.\r\n\r\nShe tossed the whip aside, stretched out on the ottoman, and rang.\r\n\r\nThe negresses entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntie him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they loosened the rope, I fell to the floor like a lump of wood. The\r\nblack women grinned, showing their white teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntie the rope around his feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did it, but I was unable to rise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome over here, Gregor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI approached the beautiful woman. Never did she seem more seductive to\r\nme than to-day in spite of all her cruelty and contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne step further,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda commanded. \xe2\x80\x9cNow kneel down, and kiss my\r\nfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe extended her foot beyond the hem of white satin, and I, the\r\nsupersensual fool, pressed my lips upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you won\xe2\x80\x99t lay eyes on me for an entire month, Gregor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nseriously. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to become a stranger to you, so you will more easily\r\nadjust yourself to our new relationship. In the meantime you will work\r\nin the garden, and await my orders. Now, off with you, slave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA month has passed with monotonous regularity, heavy work, and a\r\nmelancholy hunger, hunger for her, who is inflicting all these torments\r\non me.\r\n\r\nI am under the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s orders; I help him lop the trees and prune\r\nthe hedges, transplant flowers, turn over the flower beds, sweep the\r\ngravel paths; I share his coarse food and his hard cot; I rise and go\r\nto bed with the chickens. Now and then I hear that our mistress is\r\namusing herself, surrounded by admirers. Once I heard her gay laughter\r\neven down here in the garden.\r\n\r\nI seem awfully stupid to myself. Was it the result of my present life,\r\nor was I so before? The month is drawing to a close\xe2\x80\x94the day after\r\nto-morrow. What will she do with me now, or has she forgotten me, and\r\nleft me to trim hedges and bind bouquets till my dying day?\r\n\r\nA written order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe slave Gregor is herewith ordered to my personal service.\r\n\r\nWanda Dunajew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a beating heart I draw aside the damask curtain on the following\r\nmorning, and enter the bed-room of my divinity. It is still filled with\r\na pleasant half darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, Gregor?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks, while I kneel before the fire-place,\r\nbuilding a fire. I tremble at the sound of the beloved voice. I cannot\r\nsee her herself; she is invisible behind the curtains of the\r\nfour-poster bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d I reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow late is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPast nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hasten to get it, and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is breakfast, my mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda draws back the curtains, and curiously enough at the first glance\r\nwhen I see her among the pillows with loosened flowing hair, she seems\r\nan absolute stranger, a beautiful woman, but the beloved soft lines are\r\ngone. This face is hard and has an expression of weariness and satiety.\r\n\r\nOr is it simply that formerly my eye did not see this?\r\n\r\nShe fixes her green eyes upon me, more with curiosity than with menace,\r\nperhaps even somewhat pityingly, and lazily pulls the dark sleeping fur\r\non which she lies over the bared shoulder.\r\n\r\nAt this moment she is very charming, very maddening, and I feel my\r\nblood rising to my head and heart. The tray in my hands begins to sway.\r\nShe notices it and reached out for the whip which is lying on the\r\ntoilet-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are awkward, slave,\xe2\x80\x9d she says furrowing her brow.\r\n\r\nI lower my looks to the ground, and hold the tray as steadily as\r\npossible. She eats her breakfast, yawns, and stretches her opulent\r\nlimbs in the magnificent furs.\r\n\r\nShe has rung. I enter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this letter to Prince Corsini.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hurry into the city, and hand the letter to the Prince. He is a\r\nhandsome young man with glowing black eyes. Consumed with jealousy, I\r\ntake his answer to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks with lurking spitefulness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare very pale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, mistress, I merely walked rather fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt luncheon the prince is at her side, and I am condemned to serve both\r\nher and him. They joke, and I am, as if non-existent, for both. For a\r\nbrief moment I see black; I was just pouring some Bordeaux into his\r\nglass, and spilled it over the table-cloth and her gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow awkward,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda exclaimed and slapped my face. The prince laughed,\r\nand she also, but I felt the blood rising to my face.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon she drove in the Cascine. She has a little carriage with\r\na handsome, brown English horse, and holds the reins herself. I sit\r\nbehind and notice how coquettishly she acts, and nods with a smile when\r\none of the distinguished gentlemen bows to her.\r\n\r\nAs I help her out of the carriage, she leans lightly on my arm; the\r\ncontact runs through me like an electric shock. She _is_ a wonderful\r\nwoman, and I love her more than ever.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor dinner at six she has invited a small group of men and women. I\r\nserve, but this time I do not spill any wine over the table-cloth.\r\n\r\nA slap in the face is more effective than ten lectures. It makes you\r\nunderstand very quickly, especially when the instruction is by the way\r\nof a small woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter dinner she drives to the Pergola Theater. As she descends the\r\nstairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and\r\nwith a diadem of white roses on her hair, she is literally stunning. I\r\nopen the carriage-door, and help her in. In front of the theater I leap\r\nfrom the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, and in alighting she leaned on my arm, which\r\ntrembled under the sweet burden. I open the door of her box, and then\r\nwait in the vestibule. The performance lasts four hours; she receives\r\nvisits from her cavaliers, the while I grit my teeth with rage.\r\n\r\nIt is way beyond midnight when my mistress\xe2\x80\x99s bell sounds for the last\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire!\xe2\x80\x9d she orders abruptly, and when the fire-place crackles, \xe2\x80\x9cTea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I return with the samovar, she has already undressed, and with the\r\naid of the negress slipped into a white negligee.\r\n\r\nHayd\xc3\xa9e thereupon leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHand me the sleeping-furs,\xe2\x80\x9d says Wanda, sleepily stretching her lovely\r\nlimbs. I take them from the arm-chair, and hold them while she slowly\r\nand lazily slides into the sleeves. She then throws herself down on the\r\ncushions of the ottoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake off my shoes, and put on my velvet slippers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry, hurry!\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda exclaims, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are hurting me! just you wait\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwill teach you.\xe2\x80\x9d She strikes me with the whip, but now the shoe is off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow get out!\xe2\x80\x9d Still a kick\xe2\x80\x94and then I can go to bed.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo-night I accompanied her to a soiree. In the entrance-hall she\r\nordered me to help her out of her furs; then with a proud smile,\r\nconfident of victory, she entered the brilliantly illuminated room. I\r\nagain waited with gloomy and monotonous thoughts, watching hour after\r\nhour run by. From time to time the sounds of music reached me, when the\r\ndoor remained open for a moment. Several servants tried to start a\r\nconversation with me, but soon desisted, since I knew only a few words\r\nof Italian.\r\n\r\nFinally I fell asleep, and dreamed that I murdered Wanda in a violent\r\nattack of jealousy. I was condemned to death, and saw myself strapped\r\non the board; the knife fell, I felt it on my neck, but I was still\r\nalive\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThen the executioner slapped my face.\r\n\r\nNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the executioner; it was Wanda who stood wrathfully before\r\nme demanding her furs. I am at her side in a moment, and help her on\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThere is a deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs, and in\r\nseeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle in the\r\nprecious soft furs, and to lift the flowing hair over the collar. When\r\nshe throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of her body still\r\nclings to the ends of the hairs of sable. It is enough to drive one\r\nmad.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally a day came when there were neither guests, nor theater, nor\r\nother company. I breathed a sigh of relief. Wanda sat in the gallery,\r\nreading, and apparently had no orders for me. At dusk when the silvery\r\nevening mists fell she withdrew. I served her at dinner, she ate by\r\nherself, but had not a look, not a syllable for me, not even a slap in\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\nI actually desire a slap from her hand. Tears fill my eyes, and I feel\r\nthat she has humiliated me so deeply, that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even find it\r\nworth while to torture or maltreat me any further.\r\n\r\nBefore she goes to bed, her bell calls me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will sleep here to-night, I had horrible dreams last night, and am\r\nafraid of being alone. Take one of the cushions from the ottoman, and\r\nlie down on the bearskin at my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Wanda put out the lights. The only illumination in the room was\r\nfrom a small lamp suspended from the ceiling. She herself got into bed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stir, so as not to wake me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as she had commanded, but could not fall asleep for a long time.\r\nI saw the beautiful woman, beautiful as a goddess, lying on her back on\r\nthe dark sleeping-furs; her arms beneath her neck, with a flood of red\r\nhair over them. I heard her magnificent breast rise in deep regular\r\nbreathing, and whenever she moved ever so slightly. I woke up and\r\nlistened to see whether she needed me.\r\n\r\nBut she did not require me.\r\n\r\nNo task was required of me; I meant no more to her than a night-lamp,\r\nor a revolver which one places under one\xe2\x80\x99s pillow.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAm I mad or is she? Does all this arise out of an inventive, wanton\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensual\r\nfantasies, or is this woman really one of those Neronian characters who\r\ntake a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot, like a worm, human\r\nbeings, who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirs?\r\n\r\nWhat have I experienced?\r\n\r\nWhen I knelt with the coffee-tray beside her bed, Wanda suddenly placed\r\nher hand on my shoulder and her eyes plunged deep into mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat beautiful eyes you have,\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly, \xe2\x80\x9cand especially now\r\nsince you suffer. Are you very unhappy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bowed my head, and kept silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeverin, do you still love me,\xe2\x80\x9d she suddenly exclaimed passionately,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccan you still love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew me close with such vehemence that the coffee-tray upset, the\r\ncan and cups fell to the floor, and the coffee ran over the carpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda\xe2\x80\x94my Wanda,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried out and held her passionately against me; I\r\ncovered her mouth, face, and breast with kisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my unhappiness that I love you more and more madly the worse you\r\ntreat me, the more frequently you betray me. Oh, I shall die of pain\r\nand love and jealousy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t betrayed you, as yet, Severin,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wanda smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot? Wanda! Don\xe2\x80\x99t jest so mercilessly with me,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nmyself taken the letter to the Prince\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, it was an invitation for luncheon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have, since we have been in Florence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been absolutely faithful to you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wanda, \xe2\x80\x9cI swear it by\r\nall that is holy to me. All that I have done was merely to fulfill your\r\ndream and it was done for your sake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I shall take a lover, otherwise things will be only half\r\naccomplished, and in the end you will yet reproach me with not having\r\ntreated you cruelly enough, my dear beautiful slave! But to-day you\r\nshall be Severin again, the only one I love. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t given away your\r\nclothes. They are here in the chest. Go and dress as you used to in the\r\nlittle Carpathian health-resort when our love was so intimate. Forget\r\neverything that has happened since; oh, you will forget it easily in my\r\narms; I shall kiss away all your sorrows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to treat me tenderly like a child, to kiss me and caress me.\r\nFinally she said with a gracious smile, \xe2\x80\x9cGo now and dress, I too will\r\ndress. Shall I put on my fur-jacket? Oh yes, I know, now run along!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I returned she was standing in the center of the room in her white\r\nsatin dress, and the red _kazabaika_ edged with ermine; her hair was\r\nwhite with powder and over her forehead she wore a small diamond\r\ndiadem. For a moment she reminded me in an uncanny way of Catherine the\r\nSecond, but she did not give me much time for reminiscences. She drew\r\nme down on the ottoman beside her and we enjoyed two blissful hours.\r\nShe was no longer the stern capricious mistress, she was entirely a\r\nfine lady, a tender sweetheart. She showed me photographs and books\r\nwhich had just appeared, and talked about them with so much\r\nintelligence, clarity, and good taste, that I more than once carried\r\nher hand to my lips, enraptured. She then had me recite several of\r\nLermontov\xe2\x80\x99s poems, and when I was all afire with enthusiasm, she placed\r\nher small hand gently on mine. Her expression was soft, and her eyes\r\nwere filled with tender pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then leaned back on the cushions, and slowly opened her\r\n_kazabaika_.\r\n\r\nBut I quickly covered the half-bared breast again with the ermine. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare driving me mad.\xe2\x80\x9d I stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was already lying in her arms, and like a serpent she was kissing me\r\nwith her tongue, when again she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInfinitely!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe laughed aloud. It was an evil, shrill laugh which made cold shivers\r\nrun down by back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou used to dream of being the slave, the plaything of a beautiful\r\nwoman, and now you imagine you are a free human being, a man, my\r\nlover-you fool! A sign from me, and you are a slave again. Down on your\r\nknees!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sank down from the ottoman to her feet, but my eye still clung\r\ndoubtingly on hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at me with her arms folded\r\nacross her breast. \xe2\x80\x9cI am bored, and you will just do to while away a\r\ncouple of hours of time. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me that way\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kicked me with her foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are just what I want, a human being, a thing, an animal\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rang. The three negresses entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTie his hands behind his back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI remained kneeling and unresistingly let them do this. They led me\r\ninto the garden, down to the little vineyard, which forms the southern\r\nboundary. Corn had been planted between the espaliers, and here and\r\nthere a few dead stalks still stood. To one side was a plough.\r\n\r\nThe negresses tied me to a post, and amused themselves sticking me with\r\ntheir golden hair-needles. But this did not last long, before Wanda\r\nappeared with her ermine cap on her head, and with her hands in the\r\npockets of her jacket. She had me untied, and then my hands were\r\nfastened together on my back. She finally had a yoke put around my\r\nneck, and harnessed me to the plough.\r\n\r\nThen her black demons drove me out into the field. One of them held the\r\nplough, the other one led me by a line, the third applied the whip, and\r\nVenus in Furs stood to one side and looked on.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I was serving dinner on the following day Wanda said: \xe2\x80\x9cBring\r\nanother cover, I want you to dine with me to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d and when I was about\r\nto sit down opposite her, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, over here, close by my side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe is in the best of humors, gives me soup with her spoon, feeds me\r\nwith her fork, and places her head on the table like a playful kitten\r\nand flirts with me. I have the misfortune of looking at Hayd\xc3\xa9e, who\r\nserves in my place, perhaps a little longer than is necessary. It is\r\nonly now that I noticed her noble, almost European cast of countenance\r\nand her magnificent statuesque bust, which is as if hewn out of black\r\nmarble. The black devil observes that she pleases me, and, grinning,\r\nshows her teeth. She has hardly left the room, before Wanda leaps up in\r\na rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you dare to look at another woman besides me! Perhaps you like\r\nher even better than you do me, she is even more demonic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI am frightened; I have never seen her like this before; she is\r\nsuddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles. Venus in\r\nFurs is jealous of her slave. She snatches the whip from its hook and\r\nstrikes me in the face; then she calls her black servants, who bind me,\r\nand carry me down into the cellar, where they throw me into a dark,\r\ndank, subterranean compartment, a veritable prison-cell.\r\n\r\nThen the lock of the door clicks, the bolts are drawn, a key sings in\r\nthe lock. I am a prisoner, buried.\r\n\r\nI have been lying here for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long, bound like a calf\r\nabout to be hauled to the slaughter, on a bundle of damp straw, without\r\nany light, without food, without drink, without sleep. It would be like\r\nher to let me starve to death, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t freeze to death before then.\r\nI am shaking with cold. Or is it fever? I believe I am beginning to\r\nhate this woman.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA red streak, like blood, floods across the floor; it is a light\r\nfalling through the door which is now thrust open.\r\n\r\nWanda appears on the threshold, wrapped in her sables, holding a\r\nlighted torch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you still alive?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you coming to kill me?\xe2\x80\x9d I reply with a low, hoarse voice.\r\n\r\nWith two rapid strides Wanda reaches my side, she kneels down beside\r\nme, and places my head in her lap. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill? Your eyes glow so, do\r\nyou love me? I want you to love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe draws forth a short dagger. I start with fright when its blade\r\ngleams in front of my eyes. I actually believe that she is about to\r\nkill me. She laughs, and cuts the ropes that bind me.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery evening after dinner she now has me called. I have to read to\r\nher, and she discusses with me all sorts of interesting problems and\r\nsubjects. She seems entirely transformed; it is as if she were ashamed\r\nof the savagery which she betrayed to me and of the cruelty with which\r\nshe treated me. A touching gentleness transfigures her entire being,\r\nand when at the good-night she gives me her hand, a superhuman power of\r\ngoodness and love lies in her eyes, of the kind which calls forth tears\r\nin us and causes us to forget all the miseries of existence and all the\r\nterrors of death.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am reading _Manon l\xe2\x80\x99Escault_ to her. She feels the association, she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word, but she smiles from time to time, and finally she\r\nshuts up the little book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to go on reading?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to-day. We will ourselves act _Manon l\xe2\x80\x99Escault_ to-day. I have a\r\nrendezvous in the Cascine, and you, my dear Chevalier, will accompany\r\nme; I know, you will do it, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou command it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not command it, I beg it of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she says with irresistible\r\ncharm. She then rises, puts her hands on my shoulders, and looks at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaims. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you, Severin, you have no idea how I\r\nlove you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cso much so that you have arranged\r\nfor a rendezvous with some one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do this only to allure you the more,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied vivaciously. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust have admirers, so as not to lose you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ever want to lose\r\nyou, never, do you hear, for I love only you, you alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clung passionately to my lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if I only could, as I would, give you all of my soul in a\r\nkiss\xe2\x80\x94thus\xe2\x80\x94but now come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slipped into a simple black velvet coat, and put a dark _bashlyk_5\r\non her head. Then she rapidly went through the gallery, and entered the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: A kind of Russian cap.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGregor will drive,\xe2\x80\x9d she called out to the coachman who withdrew in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nI ascended the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, and angrily whipped up the horses.\r\n\r\nIn the Cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path, Wanda\r\ngot out. It was night, only occasional stars shone through the gray\r\nclouds that fled across the sky. By the bank of the Arno stood a man in\r\na dark cloak, with a brigand\xe2\x80\x99s hat, and looked at the yellow waves.\r\nWanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery, and tapped him on the\r\nshoulder. I saw him turn and seize her hand, and then they disappeared\r\nbehind the green wall.\r\n\r\nAn hour full of torments. Finally there was a rustling in the bushes to\r\none side, and they returned.\r\n\r\nThe man accompanied her to the carriage. The light of the lamp fell\r\nfull and glaringly upon an infinitely young, soft and dreamy face which\r\nI had never before seen, and played in his long, blond curls.\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand which he kissed with deep respect, then she\r\nsignaled to me, and immediately the carriage flew along the leafy wall\r\nwhich follows the river like a long green screen.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bell at the garden-gate rings. It is a familiar face. The man from\r\nthe Cascine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom shall I announce?\xe2\x80\x9d I ask him in French. He timidly shakes his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, perhaps, understand some German?\xe2\x80\x9d he asks shyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Your name, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he replies, embarrassed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTell your mistress\r\nthe German painter from the Cascine is here and would like\xe2\x80\x94but there\r\nshe is herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda had stepped out on the balcony, and nodded toward the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGregor, show the gentleman in!\xe2\x80\x9d she called to me.\r\n\r\nI showed the painter the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, I\xe2\x80\x99ll find her now, thanks, thanks very much.\xe2\x80\x9d He ran up the\r\nsteps. I remained standing below, and looked with deep pity on the poor\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\nVenus in Furs has caught his soul in the red snares of hair. He will\r\npaint her, and go mad.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a sunny winter\xe2\x80\x99s day. Something that looks like gold trembles on\r\nthe leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green level of\r\nthe meadow. The camelias at the foot of the gallery are glorious in\r\ntheir abundant buds. Wanda is sitting in the loggia; she is drawing.\r\nThe German painter stands opposite her with his hands folded as in\r\nadoration, and looks at her. No, he rather looks at her face, and is\r\nentirely absorbed in it, enraptured.\r\n\r\nBut she does not see him, neither does she see me, who with the spade\r\nin my hand am turning over the flower-bed, solely that I may see her\r\nand feel her nearness, which produces an effect on me like poetry, like\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe painter has gone. It is a hazardous thing to do, but I risk it. I\r\ngo up to the gallery, quite close, and ask Wanda \xe2\x80\x9cDo you love the\r\npainter, mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looks at me without getting angry, shakes her head, and finally\r\neven smiles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel sorry for him,\xe2\x80\x9d she replies, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not love him. I love no\r\none. _I used to love you, as ardently, as passionately, as deeply as it\r\nwas possible for me to love,_ but now I don\xe2\x80\x99t love even you any more;\r\nmy heart is a void, dead, and this makes me sad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon, you too will no longer love me,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me when\r\nyou have reached that point, and I will give back to you your freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall remain your slave, all my life long, for I adore you and\r\nshall always adore you,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, seized by that fanaticism of love\r\nwhich has repeatedly been so fatal to me.\r\n\r\nWanda looked at me with a curious pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cConsider well what you\r\ndo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have loved you infinitely and have been despotic\r\ntowards you so that I might fulfil your dream. Something of my old\r\nfeeling, a sort of real sympathy for you, still trembles in my breast.\r\nWhen that too has gone who knows whether then I shall give you your\r\nliberty; whether I shall not then become really cruel, merciless, even\r\nbrutal toward; whether I shall not take a diabolical pleasure in\r\ntormenting and putting on the rack the man who worships me\r\nidolatrously, the while I remain indifferent or love someone else;\r\nperhaps, I shall enjoy seeing him die of his love for me. Consider this\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have long since considered all that,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied as in a glow of\r\nfever. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot exist, cannot live without you; I shall die if you set\r\nme at liberty; let me remain your slave, kill me, but do not drive me\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well then, be my slave,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that I no\r\nlonger love you, and your love doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean any more to me than a\r\ndog\xe2\x80\x99s, and dogs are kicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo-day I visited the Venus of Medici.\r\n\r\nIt was still early, and the little octagonal room in the Tribuna was\r\nfilled with half-lights like a sanctuary; I stood with folded hands in\r\ndeep adoration before the silent image of the divinity.\r\n\r\nBut I did not stand for long.\r\n\r\nNot a human soul was in the gallery, not even an Englishman, and I fell\r\ndown on my knees. I looked up at the lovely slender body, the budding\r\nbreasts, the virginal and yet voluptuous face, the fragrant curls which\r\nseemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy mistress\xe2\x80\x99s bell.\r\n\r\nIt is noonday. She, however, is still abed with her arms intertwined\r\nbehind her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to bathe,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will attend me. Lock the door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI obey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow go downstairs and make sure the door below is also locked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to the bath;\r\nmy feet gave way beneath me, and I had to support myself against the\r\niron banister. After having ascertained that the door leading to the\r\nLoggia and the garden was locked, I returned. Wanda was now sitting on\r\nthe bed with loosened hair, wrapped in her green velvet furs. When she\r\nmade a rapid movement, I noticed that the furs were her only covering.\r\nIt made me start terribly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why? I was like one condemned\r\nto death, who knows he is on the way to the scaffold, and yet begins to\r\ntremble when he sees it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Gregor, take me on your arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to carry me, don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI lifted her up, so that she rested in my arms, while she twined hers\r\naround my neck. Slowly, step by step, I went down the stairs with her\r\nand her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and her foot\r\nsought support against my knee. I trembled under the beautiful burden I\r\nwas carrying, and every moment it seemed as if I had to break down\r\nbeneath it.\r\n\r\nThe bath consisted of a wide, high rotunda, which received a soft quiet\r\nlight from a red glass cupola above. Two palms extended their broad\r\nleaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions. From here steps\r\ncovered with Turkish rugs led to the white marble basin which occupied\r\nthe center.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a green ribbon on my toilet-table upstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, as I\r\nlet her down on the couch, \xe2\x80\x9cgo get it, and also bring the whip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI flew upstairs and back again, and kneeling put both in my mistress\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. She then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knot\r\nwhich I fastened with the green ribbon. Then I prepared the bath. I did\r\nthis very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me. Again\r\nand again I had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvet\r\ncushions, and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here and\r\nthere beneath the furs. Some magnetic power stronger than my will\r\ncompelled me to look. I felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies\r\nin that which is half-concealed or intentionally disclosed; and the\r\ntruth of this I recognized even more acutely, when the basin at last\r\nwas full, and Wanda threw off the fur-cloak with a single gesture, and\r\nstood before me like the goddess in the Tribuna.\r\n\r\nAt that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiled\r\nbeauty, as did the divinity of long ago. I sank down on my knees before\r\nher, and devoutly pressed my lips on her foot.\r\n\r\nMy soul which had been storm-tossed only a little while earlier,\r\nsuddenly was perfectly calm, and I now felt no element of cruelty in\r\nWanda.\r\n\r\nShe slowly descended the stairs, and I could watch her with a calmness\r\nin which not a single atom of torment or desire was intermingled. I\r\ncould see her plunge into and rise out of the crystalline water, and\r\nthe wavelets which she herself raised played about her like tender\r\nlovers.\r\n\r\nOur nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says: a real apple is more\r\nbeautiful than a painted one, and a living woman is more beautiful than\r\na Venus of stone.\r\n\r\nAnd when she left the bath, and the silvery drops and the roseate light\r\nrippled down her body, I was seized with silent rapture. I wrapped the\r\nlinen sheets about her, drying her glorious body. The calm bliss\r\nremained with me, even now when one foot upon me as upon a footstool,\r\nshe rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloak. The lithe sables\r\nnestled desirously against her cold marble-like body. Her left arm on\r\nwhich she supported herself lay like a sleeping swan in the dark fur of\r\nthe sleeve, while her left hand played carelessly with the whip.\r\n\r\nBy chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall opposite, and\r\nI cried out, for I saw the two of us in its golden frame as in a\r\npicture. The picture was so marvellously beautiful, so strange, so\r\nimaginative, that I was filled with deep sorrow at the thought that its\r\nlines and colors would have to dissolve like mist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Wanda.\r\n\r\nI pointed to the mirror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is really beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9ctoo bad one can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncapture the moment and make it permanent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWould not any artist, even the most famous, be\r\nproud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal by means\r\nof his brush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thought that this extra-ordinary beauty is to be lost to the\r\nworld,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued still watching her enthusiastically, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nhorrible\xe2\x80\x94all this glorious facial expression, this mysterious eye with\r\nits green fires, this demonic hair, this magnificence of body. The idea\r\nfills me with a horror of death, of annihilation. But the hand of an\r\nartist shall snatch you from this. You shall not like the rest of us\r\ndisappear absolutely and forever, without leaving a trace of your\r\nhaving been. Your picture must live, even when you yourself have long\r\nfallen to dust; your beauty must triumph beyond death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo bad, that present-day Italy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a Titian or Raphael,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut, perhaps, love will make amends for genius, who knows; our little\r\nGerman might do?\xe2\x80\x9d She pondered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he shall paint you, and I will see to it that the god of love\r\nmixes his colors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe young painter has established his studio in her villa; he is\r\ncompletely in her net. He has just begun a Madonna, a Madonna with red\r\nhair and green eyes! Only the idealism of a German would attempt to use\r\nthis thorough-bred woman as a model for a picture of virginity. The\r\npoor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than I am. Our misfortune\r\nis that our Titania has discovered our ass\xe2\x80\x99s ears too soon.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow she laughs derisively at us, and how she laughs! I hear her\r\ninsolent melodious laughter in his studio, under the open window of\r\nwhich I stand, jealously listening.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you mad, me\xe2\x80\x94ah, it is unbelievable, me as the Mother of God!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed and laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment, I will show you another\r\npicture of myself, one that I myself have painted, and you shall copy\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer head appeared in the window, luminous like a flame under the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGregor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hurried up the stairs, through the gallery, into the studio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLead him to the bath,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda commanded, while she herself hurried\r\naway.\r\n\r\nA few moments passed and Wanda arrived; dressed in nothing but the\r\nsable fur, with the whip in her hand; she descended the stairs and\r\nstretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion. I lay\r\nat her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me; her right hand\r\nplayed with the whip. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith your deep,\r\nfanatical look, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe painter had turned terribly pale. He devoured the scene with his\r\nbeautiful dreamy blue eyes; his lips opened, but he remained dumb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how do you like the picture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is how I want to paint you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the German, but it was\r\nreally not a spoken language; it was the eloquent moaning, the weeping\r\nof a sick soul, a soul sick unto death.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe charcoal outline of the painting is done; the heads and flesh parts\r\nare painted in. Her diabolical face is already becoming visible under a\r\nfew bold strokes, life flashes in her green eyes.\r\n\r\nWanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over her\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis picture, like many of those of the Venetian school, is\r\nsimultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a story,\xe2\x80\x9d explained\r\nthe painter, who again had become pale as death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will you call it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what is the matter with\r\nyou, are you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he answered with a consuming look fixed on the beautiful\r\nwoman in furs, \xe2\x80\x9cbut let us talk of the picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, let us talk about the picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI imagine the goddess of love as having descended from Mount Olympus\r\nfor the sake of some mortal man. And always cold in this modern world\r\nof ours, she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy fur\r\nand her feet in the lap of her lover. I imagine the favorite of a\r\nbeautiful despot, who whips her slave, when she is tired of kissing\r\nhim, and the more she treads him underfoot, the more insanely he loves\r\nher. And so I shall call the picture: _Venus in Furs_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe painter paints slowly, but his passion grows more and more rapidly.\r\nI am afraid he will end up by committing suicide. She plays with him\r\nand propounds riddles to him which he cannot solve, and he feels his\r\nblood congealing in the process, but it amuses her.\r\n\r\nDuring the sitting she nibbles at candies, and rolls the paper-wrappers\r\ninto little pellets with which she bombards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you are in such good humor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the painter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut your\r\nface has lost the expression which I need for my picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe expression which you need for your picture,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, smiling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, and dealt me a blow with the whip. The painter looked at her\r\nwith stupefaction, and a child-like surprise showed on his face,\r\nmingled with disgust and admiration.\r\n\r\nWhile whipping me, Wanda\xe2\x80\x99s face acquired more and more of the cruel,\r\ncontemptuous character, which so haunts and intoxicates me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the expression you need for your picture?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. The\r\npainter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of her eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the expression\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t paint now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, scornfully, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps I can help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d cried the German, as if taken with madness, \xe2\x80\x9cwhip me too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! With pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, shrugging her shoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if I am\r\nto whip you I want to do it in sober earnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhip me to death,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the painter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me tie you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he moaned\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nWanda left the room for a moment, and returned with ropes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94are you still brave enough to put yourself into the power of\r\nVenus in Furs, the beautiful despot, for better or worse?\xe2\x80\x9d she began\r\nironically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, tie me,\xe2\x80\x9d the painter replied dully. Wanda tied his hands on his\r\nback and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around his body,\r\nand fettered him to the cross-bars of the window. Then she rolled back\r\nthe fur, seized the whip, and stepped in front of him.\r\n\r\nThe scene had a grim attraction for me, which I cannot describe. I felt\r\nmy heart beat, when, with a smile, she drew back her arm for the first\r\nblow, and the whip hissed through the air. He winced slightly under the\r\nblow. Then she let blow after blow rain upon him, with her mouth\r\nhalf-opened and her teeth flashing between her red lips, until he\r\nfinally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous, blue eyes. It was\r\nindescribable.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe is sitting for him now, alone. He is working on her head.\r\n\r\nShe has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtain, where I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be seen, but can see everything.\r\n\r\nWhat does she intend now?\r\n\r\nIs she afraid of him? She has driven him insane enough to be sure, or\r\nis she hatching a new torment for me? My knees tremble.\r\n\r\nThey are talking. He has lowered his voice so that I cannot understand\r\na word, and she replies in the same way. What is the meaning of this?\r\nIs there an understanding between them?\r\n\r\nI suffer frightful torments; my heart seems about to burst.\r\n\r\nHe kneels down before her, embraces her, and presses his head against\r\nher breast, and she\xe2\x80\x94in her heartlessness\xe2\x80\x94laughs\xe2\x80\x94and now I hear her\r\nsaying aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You need another application of the whip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman! Goddess! Are you without a heart\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t you love,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nGerman, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you even know, what it means to love, to be consumed\r\nwith desire and passion, can\xe2\x80\x99t you even imagine what I suffer? Have you\r\nno pity for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied proudly and mockingly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have the whip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew it quickly from the pocket of her fur-coat, and struck him in\r\nthe face with the handle. He rose, and drew back a couple of paces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, are you ready to paint again?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked indifferently. He did\r\nnot reply, but again went to the easel and took up his brush and\r\npalette.\r\n\r\nThe painting is marvellously successful. It is a portrait which as far\r\nas the likeness goes couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be better, and at the same time it seems\r\nto have an ideal quality. The colors glow, are supernatural; almost\r\ndiabolical, I would call them.\r\n\r\nThe painter has put all his sufferings, his adoration, and all his\r\nexecration into the picture.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow he is painting me; we are alone together for several hours every\r\nday. To-day he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love this woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also love her.\xe2\x80\x9d His eyes were bathed in tears. He remained silent\r\nfor a while, and continued painting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a mountain at home in Germany within which she dwells,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmurmured to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is a demon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe picture is finished. She insisted on paying him for it,\r\nmunificently, in the manner of queens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you have already paid me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a tormented smile,\r\nrefusing her offer.\r\n\r\nBefore he left, he secretly opened his portfolio, and let me look\r\ninside. I was startled. Her head looked at me as if out of a mirror and\r\nseemed actually to be alive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take it along,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is mine; she can\xe2\x80\x99t take it away\r\nfrom me. I have earned it with my heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am really rather sorry for the poor painter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to me to-day,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit is absurd to be as virtuous as I am. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not dare to reply to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I forgot that I am talking with a slave; I need some fresh air, I\r\nwant to be diverted, I want to forget.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe carriage, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer new dress is extravagant: Russian half-boots of violet-blue velvet\r\ntrimmed with ermine, and a skirt of the same material, decorated with\r\nnarrow stripes and rosettes of furs. Above it is an appropriate,\r\nclose-fitting jacket, also richly trimmed and lined with ermine. The\r\nheaddress is a tall cap of ermine of the style of Catherine the Second,\r\nwith a small aigrette, held in place by a diamond-agraffe; her red hair\r\nfalls loose down her back. She ascends on the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, and holds\r\nthe reins herself; I take my seat behind. How she lashes on the horses!\r\nThe carriage flies along like mad.\r\n\r\nApparently it is her intention to attract attention to-day, to make\r\nconquests, and she succeeds completely. She is the lioness of the\r\nCascine. People nod to her from carriages; on the footpath people\r\ngather in groups to discuss her. She pays no attention to anyone,\r\nexcept now and then acknowledging the greetings of elderly gentlemen\r\nwith a slight nod.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a young man on a lithe black horse dashes up at full speed. As\r\nsoon as he sees Wanda, he stops his horse and makes it walk. When he is\r\nquite close, he stops entirely and lets her pass. And she too sees\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94the lioness, the lion. Their eyes meet. She madly drives past him,\r\nbut she cannot tear herself free from the magic power of his look, and\r\nshe turns her head after him.\r\n\r\nMy heart stops when I see the half-surprised, half-enraptured look with\r\nwhich she devours him, but he is worthy of it.\r\n\r\nFor he is, indeed, a magnificent specimen of man, No, rather, he is a\r\nman whose like I have never yet seen among the living. He is in the\r\nBelvedere, graven in marble, with the same slender, yet steely\r\nmusculature, with the same face and the same waving curls. What makes\r\nhim particularly beautiful is that he is beardless. If his hips were\r\nless narrow, one might take him for a woman in disguise. The curious\r\nexpression about the mouth, the lion\xe2\x80\x99s lip which slightly discloses the\r\nteeth beneath, lends a flashing tinge of cruelty to the beautiful face\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nApollo flaying Marsyas.\r\n\r\nHe wears high black boots, closely fitting breeches of white leather,\r\nshort fur coat of black cloth, of the kind worn by Italian cavalry\r\nofficers, trimmed with astrakhan and many rich loops; on his black\r\nlocks is a red fez.\r\n\r\nI now understand the masculine Eros, and I marvel at Socrates for\r\nhaving remained virtuous in view of an Alcibiades like this.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have never seen my lioness so excited. Her cheeks flamed when she\r\nleft from the carriage at her villa. She hurried upstairs, and with an\r\nimperious gesture ordered me to follow.\r\n\r\nWalking up and down her room with long strides, she began to talk so\r\nrapidly, that I was frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to find out who the man in the Cascine was, immediately\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a man! Did you see him? What do you think of him? Tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man is beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied dully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is so beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d she paused, supporting herself on the arm of a\r\nchair, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he has taken my breath away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can understand the impression he has made on you,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, my\r\nimagination carrying me away in a mad whirl. \xe2\x80\x9cI am quite lost in\r\nadmiration myself, and I can imagine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d she laughed aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this man is my lover, and\r\nthat he will apply the lash to you, and that you will enjoy being\r\npunished by him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now go, go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore evening fell, I had the desired information.\r\n\r\nWanda was still fully dressed when I returned. She reclined on the\r\nottoman, her face buried in her hands, her hair in a wild tangle, like\r\nthe red mane of a lioness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is his name?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, uncanny calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlexis Papadopolis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Greek, then,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very young?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScarcely older than you. They say he was educated in Paris, and that\r\nhe is an atheist. He fought against the Turks in Candia, and is said to\r\nhave distinguished himself there no less by his race-hatred and\r\ncruelty, than by his bravery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll in all, then, a man,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried with sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt present he is living in Florence,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9che is said to be\r\ntremendously rich\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you about that,\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted quickly and sharply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man is dangerous. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you afraid of him? I am afraid of him.\r\nHas he a wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat theaters does he attend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night he will be at the Nicolini Theater, where Virginia Marini and\r\nSalvini are acting; they are the greatest living artists in Italy,\r\nperhaps in Europe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee that you get a box\xe2\x80\x94and be quick about it!\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, mistress\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want a taste of the whip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can wait down in the lobby,\xe2\x80\x9d she said when I had placed the\r\nopera-glasses and the programme on the edge of her box and adjusted the\r\nfootstool.\r\n\r\nI am standing there and had to lean against the wall for support so as\r\nnot to fall down with envy and rage\xe2\x80\x94no, rage isn\xe2\x80\x99t the right word; it\r\nwas a mortal fear.\r\n\r\nI saw her in her box dressed in blue moire, with a huge ermine cloak\r\nabout her bare shoulders; he sat opposite. I saw them devour each other\r\nwith their eyes. For both of them the stage, Goldoni\xe2\x80\x99s _Pamela,_\r\nSalvini, Marini, the public, even the entire world, were non-existant\r\nto-night. And I\xe2\x80\x94what was I at that moment?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo-day she is attending the ball at the Greek ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s. Does she\r\nknow, that she will meet him there?\r\n\r\nAt any rate she dressed, as if she did. A heavy sea-green silk dress\r\nplastically encloses her divine form, leaving the bust and arms bare.\r\nIn her hair, which is done into a single flaming knot, a white\r\nwater-lily blossoms; from it the leaves of reeds interwoven with a few\r\nloose strands fall down toward her neck. There no longer is any trace\r\nof agitation or trembling feverishness in her being. She is calm, so\r\ncalm, that I feel my blood congealing and my heart growing cold under\r\nher glance. Slowly, with a weary, indolent majesty, she ascends the\r\nmarble staircase, lets her precious wrap slide off, and listlessly\r\nenters the hall, where the smoke of a hundred candles has formed a\r\nsilvery mist.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments my eyes follow her in a daze, then I pick up her\r\nfurs, which without my being aware, had slipped from my hands. They are\r\nstill warm from her shoulders.\r\n\r\nI kiss the spot, and my eyes fill with tears.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe has arrived.\r\n\r\nIn his black velvet coat extravagantly trimmed with sable, he is a\r\nbeautiful, haughty despot who plays with the lives and souls of men. He\r\nstands in the ante-room, looking around proudly, and his eyes rest on\r\nme for an uncomfortably long time.\r\n\r\nUnder his icy glance I am again seized by a mortal fear. I have a\r\npresentiment that this man can enchain her, captivate her, subjugate\r\nher, and I feel inferior in contrast with his savage masculinity; I am\r\nfilled with envy, with jealousy.\r\n\r\nI feel that I am a queer weakly creature of brains, merely! And what is\r\nmost humiliating, I want to hate him, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Why is that among\r\nall the host of servants he has chosen me.\r\n\r\nWith an inimitably aristocratic nod of the head he calls me over to\r\nhim, and I\xe2\x80\x94I obey his call\xe2\x80\x94against my own will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my furs,\xe2\x80\x9d he quickly commands.\r\n\r\nMy entire body trembles with resentment, but I obey, abjectly like a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll night long I waited in the ante-room, raving as in a fever. Strange\r\nimages hovered past my inner eye. I saw their meeting\xe2\x80\x94their long\r\nexchange of looks. I saw her float through the hall in his arms,\r\ndrunken, lying with half-closed lids against his breast. I saw him in\r\nthe holy of holies of love, lying on the ottoman, not as slave, but as\r\nmaster, and she at his feet. On my knees I served them, the tea-tray\r\nfaltering in my hands, and I saw him reach for the whip. But now the\r\nservants are talking about him.\r\n\r\nHe is a man who is like a woman; he knows that he is beautiful, and he\r\nacts accordingly. He changes his clothes four or five times a day, like\r\na vain courtesan.\r\n\r\nIn Paris he appeared first in woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress, and the men assailed him\r\nwith love-letters. An Italian singer, famous equally for his art and\r\nhis passionate intensity, even invaded his home, and lying on his knees\r\nbefore him threatened to commit suicide if he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to do you the favor,\r\nbut you will have to carry out your threat, for I am a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room has already thinned out to a marked degree, but she\r\napparently has no thought of leaving.\r\n\r\nMorning is already peering through the blinds.\r\n\r\nAt last I hear the rustling of her heavy gown which flows along behind\r\nher like green waves. She advances step by step, engaged in\r\nconversation with him.\r\n\r\nI hardly exist for her any longer; she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even trouble to give me\r\nan order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cloak for madame,\xe2\x80\x9d he commands. He, of course, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think of\r\nlooking after her himself.\r\n\r\nWhile I put her furs about her, he stands to one side with his arms\r\ncrossed. While I am on my knees putting on her fur over-shoes, she\r\nlightly supports herself with her hand on his shoulder. She asks:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about the lioness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the lion whom she has chosen and with whom she lives is attacked\r\nby another,\xe2\x80\x9d the Greek went on with his narrative, \xe2\x80\x9cthe lioness quietly\r\nlies down and watches the battle. Even if her mate is worsted she does\r\nnot go to his aid. She looks on indifferently as he bleeds to death\r\nunder his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s claws, and follows the victor, the stronger\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis the female\xe2\x80\x99s nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment my lioness looked quickly and curiously at me.\r\n\r\nIt made me shudder, though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know why\xe2\x80\x94and the red dawn immerses\r\nme and her and him in blood.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe did not go to bed, but merely threw off her ball-dress and undid\r\nher hair; then she ordered me to build a fire, and she sat by the\r\nfire-place, and stared into the flames.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you need me any longer, mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, my voice failed me at\r\nthe last word.\r\n\r\nWanda shook her head.\r\n\r\nI left the room, passed through the gallery, and sat down on one of the\r\nsteps, leading from there down into the garden. A gentle north wind\r\nbrought a fresh, damp coolness from the Arno, the green hills extended\r\ninto the distance in a rosy mist, a golden haze hovered over the city,\r\nover the round cupola of the Duomo.\r\n\r\nA few stars still tremble in the pale-blue sky.\r\n\r\nI tore open my coat, and pressed my burning forehead against the\r\nmarble. Everything that had happened so far seemed to me a mere child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplay; but now things were beginning to be serious, terribly serious.\r\n\r\nI anticipated a catastrophe, I visualized it, I could lay hold of it\r\nwith my hands, but I lacked the courage to meet it. My strength was\r\nbroken. And if I am honest with myself, neither the pains and\r\nsufferings that threatened me, not the humiliations that impended, were\r\nthe thing that frightened me.\r\n\r\nI merely felt a fear, the fear of losing her whom I loved with a sort\r\nof fanatical devotion; but it was so overwhelming, so crushing that I\r\nsuddenly began to sob like a child.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the day she remained locked in her room, and had the negress\r\nattend her. When the evening star rose glowing in the blue sky, I saw\r\nher pass through the garden, and, carefully following her at a\r\ndistance, watched her enter the shrine of Venus. I stealthily followed\r\nand peered through the chink in the door.\r\n\r\nShe stood before the divine image of the goddess, her hands folded as\r\nin prayer, and the sacred light of the star of love casts its blue rays\r\nover her.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn my couch at night the fear of losing her and despair took such\r\npowerful hold of me that they made a hero and a libertine of me. I\r\nlighted the little red oil-lamp which hung in the corridor beneath a\r\nsaint\xe2\x80\x99s image, and entered her bedroom, covering the light with one\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe lioness had been hunted and driven until she was exhausted. She had\r\nfallen asleep among her pillows, lying on her back, her hands clenched,\r\nbreathing heavily. A dream seemed to oppress her. I slowly withdrew my\r\nhand, and let the red light fall full on her wonderful face.\r\n\r\nBut she did not awaken.\r\n\r\nI gently set the lamp on the floor, sank down beside Wanda\xe2\x80\x99s bed, and\r\nrested my head on her soft, glowing arm.\r\n\r\nShe moved slightly, but even now did not awaken. I do not know how long\r\nI lay thus in the middle of the night, turned as into a stone by\r\nhorrible torments.\r\n\r\nFinally a severe trembling seized me, and I was able to cry. My tears\r\nflowed over her arm. She quivered several times and finally sat up; she\r\nbrushed her hand across her eyes, and looked at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeverin,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, more frightened than angry.\r\n\r\nI was unable to reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeverin,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued softly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the matter? Are you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice sounded so sympathetic, so kind, so full of love, that it\r\nclutched my breast like red-hot tongs and I began to sob aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeverin,\xe2\x80\x9d she began anew. \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor unhappy friend.\xe2\x80\x9d Her hand gently\r\nstroked my hair. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, very sorry for you; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help you;\r\nwith the best intention in the world I know of nothing that would cure\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Wanda, must it be?\xe2\x80\x9d I moaned in my agony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Severin? What are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you love me any more?\xe2\x80\x9d I continued. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you even a little\r\nbit of pity for me? Has the beautiful stranger taken complete\r\npossession of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot lie,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied softly after a short pause. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has made an\r\nimpression on me which I haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet been able to analyse, further than\r\nthat I suffer and tremble beneath it. It is an impression of the sort I\r\nhave met with in the works of poets or on the stage, but I always\r\nthought it was a figment of the imagination. Oh, he is a man like a\r\nlion, strong and beautiful and yet gentle, not brutal like the men of\r\nour northern world. I am sorry for you, Severin, I am; but I must\r\npossess him. What am I saying? I must give myself to him, if he will\r\nhave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider your reputation, Wanda, which so far has remained spotless,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if I no longer mean anything to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am considering it,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI intend to be strong, as long as\r\nit is possible, I want\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she buried her head shyly in the pillows\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant to become his wife\xe2\x80\x94if he will have me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, seized again by that mortal fear, which always robs\r\nme of my breath, makes me lose possession of myself, \xe2\x80\x9cyou want to be\r\nhis wife, belong to him for always. Oh! Do not drive me away! He does\r\nnot love you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho says that?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, flaring up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does not love you,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on passionately, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I love you, I\r\nadore you, I am your slave, I let you tread me underfoot, I want to\r\ncarry you on my arms through life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho says that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love me?\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted vehemently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! be mine,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbe mine! I cannot exist, cannot live without\r\nyou. Have mercy on me, Wanda, have mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me again, and her face had her cold heartless expression,\r\nher evil smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well then,\r\nget what consolation you can out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this she turned over on the other side, and contemptuously showed\r\nme her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, are you a woman without flesh or blood, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you a heart\r\nas well as I!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, while my breast heaved convulsively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I am,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a woman of stone,\r\n_Venus in Furs_, your ideal, kneel down, and pray to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d I implored, \xe2\x80\x9cmercy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to laugh. I buried my face in her pillows. Pain had loosened\r\nthe floodgates of my tears and I let them flow.\r\n\r\nFor a long time silence reigned, then Wanda slowly raised herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bore me,\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am tired, let me go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy,\xe2\x80\x9d I implored. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not drive me away. No man, no one, will love\r\nyou as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she turned her back to me again.\r\n\r\nI leaped up, and snatched the poinard, which hung beside her bed, from\r\nits sheath, and placed its point against my breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall kill myself here before your eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured dully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what you please,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda replied with complete indifference. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nlet me go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d She yawned aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sleepy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment I stood as if petrified. Then I began to laugh and cry at\r\nthe same time. Finally I placed the poinard in my belt, and again fell\r\non my knees before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda, listen to me, only for a few moments,\xe2\x80\x9d I begged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to go to sleep! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, leaping angrily out\r\nof bed and pushing me away with her foot. \xe2\x80\x9cYou forget that I am your\r\nmistress?\xe2\x80\x9d When I didn\xe2\x80\x99t budge, she seized the whip and struck me. I\r\nrose; she struck me again\xe2\x80\x94this time right in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretch, slave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith clenched fist held heavenward, I left her bedroom with a sudden\r\nresolve. She tossed the whip aside, and broke out into clear laughter.\r\nI can imagine that my theatrical attitude must have been very droll.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have determined to set myself free from this heartless woman, who has\r\ntreated me so cruelly, and is now about to break faith and betray me,\r\nas a reward for all my slavish devotion, for everything I have suffered\r\nfrom her. I packed my few belongings into a bundle, and then wrote her\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Madam,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI have loved you even to madness, I have given myself to you as no man\r\never has given himself to a woman. You have abused my most sacred\r\nemotions, and played an impudent, frivolous game with me. However, as\r\nlong as you were merely cruel and merciless, it was still possible for\r\nme to love you. Now you are about to become _cheap_. I am no longer the\r\nslave whom you can kick about and whip. You yourself have set me free,\r\nand I am leaving a woman I can only hate and despise.\r\n\r\nSeverin Kusiemski.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI handed these lines to the negress, and hastened away as fast as I\r\ncould go. I arrived at the railway-station all out of breath. Suddenly\r\nI felt a sharp pain in my heart and stopped. I began to weep. It is\r\nhumiliating that I want to flee and I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I turn back\xe2\x80\x94whither?\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nher, whom I abhor, and yet, at the same time, adore.\r\n\r\nAgain I pause. I cannot go back. I dare not.\r\n\r\nBut how am I to leave Florence. I remember that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any money,\r\nnot a penny. Very well then, on foot; it is better to be an honest\r\nbeggar than to eat the bread of a courtesan.\r\n\r\nBut still I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave.\r\n\r\nShe has my pledge, my word of honor. I have to return. Perhaps she will\r\nrelease me.\r\n\r\nAfter a few rapid strides, I stop again.\r\n\r\nShe has my word of honor and my bond, that I shall remain her slave as\r\nlong as she desires, until she herself gives me my freedom. But I might\r\nkill myself.\r\n\r\nI go through the Cascine down to the Arno, where its yellow waters\r\nplash monotonously about a couple of stray willows. There I sit, and\r\ncast up my final accounts with existence. I let my entire life pass\r\nbefore me in review. On the whole, it is rather a wretched affair\xe2\x80\x94a few\r\njoys, an endless number of indifferent and worthless things, and\r\nbetween these an abundant harvest of pains, miseries, fears,\r\ndisappointments, shipwrecked hopes, afflictions, sorrow and grief.\r\n\r\nI thought of my mother, whom I loved so deeply and whom I had to watch\r\nwaste away beneath a horrible disease; of my brother, who full of the\r\npromise of joy and happiness died in the flower of youth, without even\r\nhaving put his lips to the cup of life. I thought of my dead nurse, my\r\nchildhood playmates, the friends that had striven and studied with me;\r\nof all those, covered by the cold, dead, indifferent earth. I thought\r\nof my turtle-dove, who not infrequently made his cooing bows to me,\r\ninstead of to his mate.\xe2\x80\x94All have returned, dust unto dust.\r\n\r\nI laughed aloud, and slid down into the water, but at the same moment I\r\ncaught hold of one of the willow-branches, hanging above the yellow\r\nwaves. As in a vision, I see the woman who has caused all my misery.\r\nShe hovers above the level of the water, luminous in the sunlight as\r\nthough she were transparent, with red flames about her head and neck.\r\nShe turns her face toward me and smiles.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am back again, dripping, wet through, glowing with shame and fever.\r\nThe negress has delivered my letter; I am judged, lost, in the power of\r\na heartless, affronted woman.\r\n\r\nWell, let her kill me. I am unable to do it myself, and yet I have no\r\nwish to go on living.\r\n\r\nAs I walk around the house, she is standing in the gallery, leaning\r\nover the railing. Her face is full in the light of the sun, and her\r\ngreen eyes sparkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill alive?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, without moving. I stood silent, with bowed\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me back my poinard,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is of no use to you. You\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t even the courage to take your own life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lost it,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, trembling, shaken by chills.\r\n\r\nShe looked me over with a proud, scornful glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you lost it in the Arno?\xe2\x80\x9d She shrugged her shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nmatter. Well, and why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you leave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI mumbled something which neither she nor I myself could understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you haven\xe2\x80\x99t any money,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d With an indescribably\r\ndisdainful gesture she tossed me her purse.\r\n\r\nI did not pick it up.\r\n\r\nBoth of us were silent for some time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWanda drives in the Cascine without me, and goes to the theater without\r\nme; she receives company, and the negress serves her. No one asks after\r\nme. I stray about the garden, irresolutely, like an animal that has\r\nlost its master.\r\n\r\nLying among the bushes, I watch a couple of sparrows, fighting over a\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I hear the swish of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\r\n\r\nWanda approaches in a gown of dark silk, modestly closed up to the\r\nneck; the Greek is with her. They are in an eager discussion, but I\r\ncannot as yet understand a word of what they are saying. He stamps his\r\nfoot so that the gravel scatters about in all directions, and he lashes\r\nthe air with his riding whip. Wanda startles.\r\n\r\nIs she afraid that he will strike her?\r\n\r\nHave they gone that far?\r\n\r\nHe has left her, she calls him; he does not hear her, does not want to\r\nhear her.\r\n\r\nWanda sadly lowers her head, and then sits down on the nearest\r\nstone-bench. She sits for a long time, lost in thought. I watch her\r\nwith a sort of malevolent pleasure, finally I pull myself together by\r\nsheer force of will, and ironically step before her. She startles, and\r\ntrembles all over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come to wish you happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, bowing, \xe2\x80\x9cI see, my dear lady,\r\ntoo, has found a master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cnot a new slave, I have had enough of\r\nthem. A master! Woman needs a master, and she adores him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou adore him, Wanda?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthis brutal person\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I love him, as I have never loved any one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d I clenched my fists, but tears already filled my eyes, and I\r\nwas seized by the delirium of passion, as by a sweet madness. \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\nwell, take him as your husband, let him be your master, but I want to\r\nremain your slave, as long as I live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to remain my slave, even then?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat would be\r\ninteresting, but I am afraid he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t permit it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is already jealous of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9che, of you! He\r\ndemanded that I dismiss you immediately, and when I told him who you\r\nwere\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, thunderstruck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told him everything,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cour whole story, all your\r\nqueerness, everything\xe2\x80\x94and he, instead of being amused, grew angry, and\r\nstamped his foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd threatened to strike you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWanda looked to the ground, and remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d I said with mocking bitterness, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are afraid of him,\r\nWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d I threw myself down at her feet, and in my agitation embraced\r\nher knees. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything of you, except to be your slave, to\r\nbe always near you! I will be your dog-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, you bore me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wanda, indifferently.\r\n\r\nI leaped up. Everything within me was seething.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are now no longer cruel, but cheap,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, clearly and\r\ndistinctly, accentuating every word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have already written that in your letter,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanda replied, with a\r\nproud shrug of the shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cA man of brains should never repeat\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way you are treating me,\xe2\x80\x9d I broke out, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would you call it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might punish you,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied ironically, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I prefer this time\r\nto reply with reasons instead of lashes. You have no right to accuse\r\nme. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I always been honest with you? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I warned you more\r\nthan once? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I love you with all my heart, even passionately, and\r\ndid I conceal the fact from you, that it was dangerous to give yourself\r\ninto my power, to abase yourself before me, and that I want to be\r\ndominated? But you wished to be my plaything, my slave! You found the\r\nhighest pleasure in feeling the foot, the whip of an arrogant, cruel\r\nwoman. What do you want now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDangerous potentialities were slumbering in me, but you were the first\r\nto awaken them. If I now take pleasure in torturing you, abusing you,\r\nit is your fault; you have made of me what I now am, and now you are\r\neven unmanly, weak, and miserable enough to accuse me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut haven\xe2\x80\x99t I suffered because of it? Let\r\nus put an end now to the cruel game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my wish, too,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with a curious deceitful look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed violently, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t drive me to extremes; you see\r\nthat I am a man again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fire of straw,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich makes a lot of stir for a\r\nmoment, and goes out as quickly as it flared up. You imagine you can\r\nintimidate me, and you only make yourself ridiculous. Had you been the\r\nman I first thought you were, serious, reserved, stern, I would have\r\nloved you faithfully, and become your wife. Woman demands that she can\r\nlook up to a man, but one like you who voluntarily places his neck\r\nunder her foot, she uses as a welcome plaything, only to toss it aside\r\nwhen she is tired of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to toss me aside,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, jeeringly. \xe2\x80\x9cSome toys are dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t challenge me,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wanda. Her eyes began to flash, and a\r\nflush entered her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t be mine now,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, with a voice stifled with\r\nrage, \xe2\x80\x9cno one else shall possess you either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat play is this from?\xe2\x80\x9d she mocked, seizing me by the breast. She was\r\npale with anger at this moment. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t challenge me,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam not cruel, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I may not become so and whether\r\nthen there will be any bounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat worse can you do, than to make your lover, your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nexclaimed, more and more enraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might make you _his_ slave,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied quickly, \xe2\x80\x9care you not in my\r\npower? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I the agreement? But, of course, you will merely take\r\npleasure in it, if I have you bound, and say to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo with him what you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman, are you mad!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am entirely rational,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI warn you for the last\r\ntime. Don\xe2\x80\x99t offer any resistance, one who has gone as far as I have\r\ngone might easily go still further. I feel a sort of hatred for you,\r\nand would find a real joy in seeing him beat you to death; I am still\r\nrestraining myself, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScarcely master of myself any longer, I seized her by the wrist and\r\nforced her to the ground, so that she lay on her knees before me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeverin!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. Rage and terror were painted on her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall kill you if you marry him,\xe2\x80\x9d I threatened; the words came\r\nhoarsely and dully from my breast. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are mine, I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you go, I\r\nlove you too much.\xe2\x80\x9d Then I clutched her and pressed her close to me; my\r\nright hand involuntarily seized the dagger which I still had in my\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\nWanda fixed a large, calm, incomprehensible look on me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like you that way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you are a man, and at\r\nthis moment I know I still love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda,\xe2\x80\x9d I wept with rapture, and bent down over her, covering her dear\r\nface with kisses, and she, suddenly breaking into a loud gay laugh,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you finished with your ideal now, are you satisfied with\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean?\xe2\x80\x9d I stammered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you weren\xe2\x80\x99t serious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very serious,\xe2\x80\x9d she gaily continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you, only you, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94you foolish, little man, didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that everything was only\r\nmake-believe and play-acting. How hard it often was for me to strike\r\nyou with the whip, when I would have rather taken your head and covered\r\nit with kisses. But now we are through with that, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we? I have\r\nplayed my cruel role better than you expected, and now you will be\r\nsatisfied with my being a good, little wife who isn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether\r\nunattractive. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so? We will live like rational people\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will marry me!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, overflowing with happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94marry you\xe2\x80\x94you dear, darling man,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Wanda, kissing my\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nI drew her up to my breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you are no longer Gregor, my slave,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cbut Severin, the\r\ndear man I love\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t love him?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked in agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you imagine my loving a man of his brutal type? You were\r\nblind to everything, I was really afraid for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI almost killed myself for your sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cah, I still tremble at the thought, that you were\r\nalready in the Arno.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you saved me,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou hovered over the waters\r\nand smiled, and your smile called me back to life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have a curious feeling when I now hold her in my arms and she lies\r\nsilently against my breast and lets me kiss her and smiles. I feel like\r\none who has suddenly awakened out of a feverish delirium, or like a\r\nshipwrecked man who has for many days battled with waves that\r\nmomentarily threatened to devour him and finally has found a safe\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate this Florence, where you have been so unhappy,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared,\r\nas I was saying good-night to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to leave immediately,\r\ntomorrow, you will be good enough to write a couple of letters for me,\r\nand, while you are doing that, I will drive to the city to pay my\r\nfarewell visits. Is that satisfactory to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you dear, sweet, beautiful woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning she knocked at my door to ask how I had slept. Her\r\ntenderness is positively wonderful. I should never have believed that\r\nshe could be so tender.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe has now been gone for over four hours. I have long since finished\r\nthe letters, and am now sitting in the gallery, looking down the street\r\nto see whether I cannot discover her carriage in the distance. I am a\r\nlittle worried about her, and yet I know there is no reason under\r\nheaven why I should doubt or fear. However, a feeling of oppression\r\nweighs me down, and I cannot rid myself of it. It is probably the\r\nsufferings of the past days, which still cast their shadows into my\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe is back, radiant with happiness and contentment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, has everything gone as you wished?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked tenderly, kissing\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear heart,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand we shall leave to-night. Help me\r\npack my trunks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nToward evening she asked me to go to the post-office and mail her\r\nletters myself. I took her carriage, and was back within an hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMistress has asked for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the negress, with a grin, as I\r\nascended the wide marble stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anyone been here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, crouching down on the steps like a black cat.\r\n\r\nI slowly passed through the drawing-room, and then stood before her\r\nbedroom door.\r\n\r\nWhy does my heart beat so? Am I not perfectly happy?\r\n\r\nOpening the door softly, I draw back the portiere. Wanda is lying on\r\nthe ottoman, and does not seem to notice me. How beautiful she looks,\r\nin her silver-gray dress, which fits closely, and while displaying in\r\ntell-tale fashion her splendid figure, leaves her wonderful bust and\r\narms bare.\r\n\r\nHer hair is interwoven with, and held up by a black velvet ribbon. A\r\nmighty fire is burning in the fire-place, the hanging lamp casts a\r\nreddish glow, and the whole room is as if drowned in blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda,\xe2\x80\x9d I said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Severin,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been impatiently waiting\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x9d She leaped up, and folded me in her arms. She sat down again\r\non the rich cushions and tried to draw me down to her side, but I\r\nsoftly slid down to her feet and placed my head in her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know I am very much in love with you to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered,\r\nbrushing a few stray hairs from my forehead and kissing my eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful your eyes are, I have always loved them as the best of\r\nyou, but to-day they fairly intoxicate me. I am all\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She extended her\r\nmagnificent limbs and tenderly looked at me from beneath her red\r\nlashes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x94you are cold\xe2\x80\x94you hold me like a block of wood; wait, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stir\r\nyou with the fire of love,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and again clung fawningly and\r\ncaressingly to my lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI no longer please you; I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be cruel to you again,\r\nevidently I have been too kind to you to-day. Do you know, you little\r\nfool, what I shall do, I shall whip you for a while\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut child\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanda!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, let me bind you,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, and ran gaily through the room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to see you very much in love, do you understand? Here are the\r\nropes. I wonder if I can still do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began with fettering my feet and then she tied my hands behind my\r\nback, pinioning my arms like those of a prisoner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with gay eagerness. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you still move?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then tied a noose in a stout rope, threw it over my head, and let\r\nit slip down as far as the hips. She drew it tight, and bound me to a\r\npillar.\r\n\r\nA curious tremor seized me at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a feeling as if I were about to be executed,\xe2\x80\x9d I said with a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you shall have a thorough punishment to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wanda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut put on your fur-jacket, please,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall gladly give you that pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. She got her\r\n_kazabaika_, and put it on. Then she stood in front of me with her arms\r\nfolded across her chest, and looked at me out of half-closed eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember the story of the ox of Dionysius?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember it only vaguely, what about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA courtier invented a new implement of torture for the Tyrant of\r\nSyracuse. It was an iron ox in which those condemned to death were to\r\nbe shut, and then pushed into a mighty furnace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as the iron ox began to get hot, and the condemned person\r\nbegan to cry out in his torment, his wails sounded like the bellowing\r\nof an ox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDionysius nodded graciously to the inventor, and to put his invention\r\nto an immediate test had him shut up in the iron ox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very instructive story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was you who innoculated me with selfishness, pride, and cruelty,\r\nand _you shall be their first victim._ I now literally enjoy having a\r\nhuman being that thinks and feels and desires like myself in my power;\r\nI love to abuse a man who is stronger in intelligence and body than I,\r\nespecially a man who loves me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you still love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven to madness,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand so much the more will you enjoy\r\nwhat I am about to do with you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, there\r\nis a gleam of real cruelty in your eyes to-day, and you are strangely\r\nbeautiful\xe2\x80\x94completely _Venus in Furs.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nWithout replying Wanda placed her arms around my neck and kissed me. I\r\nwas again seized by my fanatical passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the whip?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nWanda laughed, and withdrew a couple of steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou really insist upon being punished?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, proudly tossing\r\nback her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly Wanda\xe2\x80\x99s face was completely transformed. It was as if\r\ndisfigured by rage; for a moment she seemed even ugly to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then _you_ whip him!\xe2\x80\x9d she called loudly.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant the beautiful Greek stuck his head of black curls\r\nthrough the curtains of her four-poster bed. At first I was speechless,\r\npetrified. There was a horribly comic element in the situation. I would\r\nhave laughed aloud, had not my position been at the same time so\r\nterribly cruel and humiliating.\r\n\r\nIt went beyond anything I had imagined. A cold shudder ran down my\r\nback, when my rival stepped from the bed in his riding boots, his\r\ntight-fitting white breeches, and his short velvet jacket, and I saw\r\nhis athletic limbs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are indeed cruel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to Wanda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly inordinately fond of pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with a wild sort of\r\nhumor. \xe2\x80\x9cPleasure alone lends value to existence; whoever enjoys does\r\nnot easily part from life, whoever suffers or is needy meets death like\r\na friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut whoever wants to enjoy must take life gaily in the sense of the\r\nancient world; he dare not hesitate to enjoy at the expense of others;\r\nhe must never feel pity; he must be ready to harness others to his\r\ncarriage or his plough as though they were animals. He must know how to\r\nmake slaves of men who feel and would enjoy as he does, and use them\r\nfor his service and pleasure without remorse. It is not his affair\r\nwhether they like it, or whether they go to rack and ruin. He must\r\nalways remember this, that if they had him in their power, as he has\r\nthem they would act in exactly the same way, and he would have to pay\r\nfor their pleasure with his sweat and blood and soul. That was the\r\nworld of the ancients: pleasure and cruelty, liberty and slavery went\r\nhand in hand. People who want to live like the gods of Olympus must of\r\nnecessity have slaves whom they can toss into their fish-ponds, and\r\ngladiators who will do battle, the while they banquet, and they must\r\nnot mind if by chance a bit of blood bespatters them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer words brought back my complete self-possession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnloosen me!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you my slave, my property?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wanda. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me to\r\nshow you the agreement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntie me!\xe2\x80\x9d I threatened, \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I tugged at the ropes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan he tear himself free?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has threatened to kill me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe entirely at ease,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Greek, testing my fetters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall call for help,\xe2\x80\x9d I began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one will hear you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wanda, \xe2\x80\x9cand no one will hinder me from\r\nabusing your most sacred emotions or playing a frivolous game with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, repeating with satanic mockery phrases from my\r\nletter to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I am at this moment merely cruel and merciless, or am I\r\nalso about to become cheap? What? Do you still love me, or do you\r\nalready hate and despise me? Here is the whip\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She handed it to the\r\nGreek who quickly stepped closer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you dare!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, trembling with indignation, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npermit it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear furs,\xe2\x80\x9d the Greek replied with an ironical\r\nsmile, and he took his short sable from the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are adorable,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wanda, kissing him, and helping him into\r\nhis furs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I really whip him?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo with him what you please,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wanda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeast!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, utterly revolted.\r\n\r\nThe Greek fixed his cold tigerish look upon me and tried out the whip.\r\nHis muscles swelled when he drew back his arms, and made the whip hiss\r\nthrough the air. I was bound like Marsyas while Apollo was getting\r\nready to flay me.\r\n\r\nMy look wandered about the room and remained fixed on the ceiling,\r\nwhere Samson, lying at Delilah\xe2\x80\x99s feet, was about to have his eyes put\r\nout by the Philistines. The picture at that moment seemed to me like a\r\nsymbol, an eternal parable of passion and lust, of the love of man for\r\nwoman. \xe2\x80\x9cEach one of us in the end is a Samson,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nultimately for better or worse is betrayed by the woman he loves,\r\nwhether he wears an ordinary coat or sables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow watch me break him in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Greek. He showed his teeth, and\r\nhis face acquired the blood-thirsty expression, which startled me the\r\nfirst time I saw him.\r\n\r\nAnd he began to apply the lash\xe2\x80\x94so mercilessly, with such frightful\r\nforce that I quivered under each blow, and began to tremble all over\r\nwith pain. Tears rolled down over my cheeks. In the meantime Wanda lay\r\non the ottoman in her fur-jacket, supporting herself on her arm; she\r\nlooked on with cruel curiosity, and was convulsed with laughter.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of being whipped by a successful rival before the eyes of\r\nan adored woman cannot be described. I almost went mad with shame and\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nWhat was most humiliating was that at first I felt a certain wild,\r\nsupersensual stimulation under Apollo\xe2\x80\x99s whip and the cruel laughter of\r\nmy Venus, no matter how horrible my position was. But Apollo whipped on\r\nand on, blow after blow, until I forgot all about poetry, and finally\r\ngritted my teeth in impotent rage, and cursed my wild dreams, woman,\r\nand love.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden I saw with horrible clarity whither blind passion and\r\nlust have led man, ever since Holofernes and Agamemnon\xe2\x80\x94into a blind\r\nalley, into the net of woman\xe2\x80\x99s treachery, into misery, slavery, and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIt was as though I were awakening from a dream.\r\n\r\nBlood was already flowing under the whip. I wound like a worm that is\r\ntrodden on, but he whipped on without mercy, and she continued to laugh\r\nwithout mercy. In the meantime she locked her packed trunk and slipped\r\ninto her travelling furs, and was still laughing, when she went\r\ndownstairs on his arm and entered the carriage.\r\n\r\nThen everything was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\nI listened breathlessly.\r\n\r\nThe carriage door slammed, the horse began to pull\xe2\x80\x94the rolling of the\r\ncarriage for a short time\xe2\x80\x94then all was over.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a moment I thought of taking vengeance, of killing him, but I was\r\nbound by the abominable agreement. So nothing was left for me to do\r\nexcept to keep my pledged word and grit my teeth.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy first impulse after this, the most cruel catastrophe of my life, was\r\nto seek laborious tasks, dangers, and privations. I wanted to become a\r\nsoldier and go to Asia or Algiers, but my father was old and ill and\r\nwanted me.\r\n\r\nSo I quietly returned home and for two years helped him bear his\r\nburdens, and learned how to look after the estate which I had never\r\ndone before. To _labor_ and to _do my duty_ was comforting like a drink\r\nof fresh water. Then my father died, and I inherited the estate, but it\r\nmeant no change.\r\n\r\nI had put on my own Spanish boots and went on living just as rationally\r\nas if the old man were standing behind me, looking over my shoulder\r\nwith his large wise eyes.\r\n\r\nOne day a box arrived, accompanied by a letter. I recognized Wanda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nCuriously moved, I opened it, and read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir.\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNow that over three years have passed since that night in Florence, I\r\nsuppose, I may confess to you that I loved you deeply. You yourself,\r\nhowever, stifled my love by your fantastic devotion and your insane\r\npassion. From the moment that you became my slave, I knew it would be\r\nimpossible for you ever to become my husband. However, I found it\r\ninteresting to have you realize your ideal in my own person, and, while\r\nI gloriously amused myself, perhaps, to cure you.\r\n\r\nI found the strong man for whom I felt a need, and I was as happy with\r\nhim as, I suppose, it is possible for any one to be on this funny ball\r\nof clay.\r\n\r\nBut my happiness, like all things mortal, was of short duration. About\r\na year ago he fell in a duel, and since then I have been living in\r\nParis, like an Aspasia\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAnd you?\xe2\x80\x94Your life surely is not without its sunshine, if you have\r\ngained control of your imagination, and those qualities in you have\r\nmaterialized, which at first so attracted me to you\xe2\x80\x94your clarity of\r\nintellect, kindness of heart, and, above all else, your\xe2\x80\x94_moral\r\nseriousness_.\r\n\r\nI hope you have been cured under my whip; the cure was cruel, but\r\nradical. In memory of that time and of a woman who loved you\r\npassionately, I am sending you the portrait by the poor German.\r\n\r\n_Venus in Furs_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had to smile, and as I fell to musing the beautiful woman suddenly\r\nstood before me in her velvet jacket trimmed with ermine, with the whip\r\nin her hand. And I continued to smile at the woman I had once loved so\r\ninsanely, at the fur-jacket that had once so entranced me, at the whip,\r\nand ended by smiling at myself and saying: The cure was cruel, but\r\nradical; but the main point is, I have been cured.\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the moral of the story?\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Severin when I put the\r\nmanuscript down on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I was a donkey,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed without turning around, for he\r\nseemed to be embarrassed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only I had beaten her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA curious remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich might answer with your\r\npeasant-women\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they are used to it,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut imagine the effect\r\nupon one of our delicate, nervous, hysterical ladies\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the moral?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat woman, as nature has created her and as man is at present\r\neducating her, is his enemy. She can only be his slave or his despot,\r\nbut _never his companion._ This she can become only when she has the\r\nsame rights as he, and is his equal in education and work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt present we have only the choice of being hammer or anvil, and I was\r\nthe kind of donkey who let a woman make a slave of him, do you\r\nunderstand?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moral of the tale is this: whoever allows himself to be whipped,\r\ndeserves to be whipped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blows, as you see, have agreed with me; the roseate supersensual\r\nmist has dissolved, and no one can ever make me believe again that\r\nthese \xe2\x80\x98sacred apes of Benares\xe2\x80\x996 or Plato\xe2\x80\x99s rooster7  are the image of\r\nGod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: One of Schopenhauer\xe2\x80\x99s designations for women.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Diogenes threw a plucked rooster into Plato\xe2\x80\x99s school and\r\nexclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cHere you have Plato\xe2\x80\x99s human being.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VENUS IN FURS ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
