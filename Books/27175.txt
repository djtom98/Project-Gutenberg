He has a coat of hair.\r\n            I wish I had one too!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lion\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Lion, the Lion, he dwells in the waste,\r\n          He has a big head and a very small waist;\r\n          But his shoulders are stark, and his jaws they are grim,\r\n          And a good little child will not play with him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tiger\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Tiger on the other hand, is kittenish and mild,\r\n          He makes a pretty playfellow for any little child;\r\n          And mothers of large families (who claim to common sense)\r\n          Will find a Tiger well repay the trouble and expense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dromedary\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Dromedary is a cheerful bird:\r\n          I cannot say the same about the Kurd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Whale\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          The Whale that wanders round the Pole\r\n            Is not a table fish.\r\n          You cannot bake or boil him whole\r\n            Nor serve him in a dish;\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          But you may cut his blubber up\r\n              And melt it down for oil.\r\n          And so replace the colza bean\r\n            (A product of the soil).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          These facts should all be noted down\r\n              And ruminated on,\r\n          By every boy in Oxford town\r\n              Who wants to be a Don.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe

Dodo\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          The Dodo used to walk around,\r\n            And take the sun and air.\r\n          The sun yet warms his native ground--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          The Dodo is not there!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          The voice which used to squawk and squeak\r\n            Is now for ever dumb--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          Yet may you see his bones and beak\r\n            All in the Mu-se-um.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marmozet\r\n\r\n\r\n          The species Man and Marmozet\r\n            Are intimately linked;\r\n          The Marmozet survives as yet,\r\n            But Men are all extinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Camelopard\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          The Camelopard, it is said\r\n            By travellers (who never lie),\r\n          He cannot stretch out straight in bed\r\n            Because he is so high.\r\n          The clouds surround his lofty head,\r\n            His hornlets touch the sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          How shall\r\n            I hunt this quadruped?\r\n              I cannot tell!\r\n                            Not I!\r\n\r\n          (A picture of how people try\r\n          And fail to hit that head so high.)\r\n          I\'ll buy a little parachute\r\n          (A common parachute with wings),\r\n          I\'ll fill it full of arrowroot\r\n          And other necessary things,\r\n          And I will slay this fearful brute\r\n          With stones and sticks and guns and slings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          (A picture of how people shoot\r\n          With comfort from a parachute.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Learned Fish\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          This learned Fish has not sufficient brains\r\n          To go into the water when it rains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Elephant\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          When people call this beast to mind,\r\n              They marvel more and more\r\n          At such a +_LITTLE_+ tail behind,\r\n          So _LARGE_ a trunk before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Big Baboon\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          The Big Baboon is found upon\r\n              The plains of Cariboo:\r\n          He goes about\r\n                        with nothing on\r\n          (A shocking thing to do).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          But if he\r\n              dressed respectably\r\n          And let his whiskers grow,\r\n          How like this Big Baboon would be\r\n                 To Mister So-and-so!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rhinoceros\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          Rhinoceros, your hide looks all undone,\r\n          You do not take my fancy in the least:\r\n          You have a horn where other brutes have none:\r\n              Rhinoceros, you are an ugly beast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frog\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          Be kind and tender to the Frog,\r\n              And do not call him names,\r\n          As \'Slimy skin,\' or \'Polly-wog,\'\r\n              Or likewise \'Ugly James,\'\r\n          Or \'Gap-a-grin,\' or \'Toad-gone-wrong,\'\r\n              Or \'Bill Bandy-knees\':\r\n          The Frog is justly sensitive\r\n              To epithets like these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          No animal will more repay\r\n              A treatment kind and fair;\r\n          At least\r\n                    so lonely people say\r\n          Who keep a frog (and, by the way,\r\n          They are extremely rare).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n          Oh!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
