All Huntingdon exclaimed on the\r\ngreatness of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her\r\nto be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to\r\nit. She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of\r\ntheir acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as\r\nhandsome as Miss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with\r\nalmost equal advantage. But there certainly are not so many men of\r\nlarge fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them.\r\nMiss Ward, at the end of half a dozen years, found herself obliged to\r\nbe attached to the Rev. Mr. Norris, a friend of her brother-in-law,\r\nwith scarcely any private fortune, and Miss Frances fared yet worse.\r\nMiss Ward\xe2\x80\x99s match, indeed, when it came to the point, was not\r\ncontemptible: Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend an\r\nincome in the living of Mansfield; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their\r\ncareer of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand a\r\nyear. But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase, to disoblige her\r\nfamily, and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines, without education,\r\nfortune, or connexions, did it very thoroughly. She could hardly have\r\nmade a more untoward choice. Sir Thomas Bertram had interest, which,\r\nfrom principle as well as pride\xe2\x80\x94from a general wish of doing right, and\r\na desire of seeing all that were connected with him in situations of\r\nrespectability, he would have been glad to exert for the advantage of\r\nLady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s sister; but her husband\xe2\x80\x99s profession was such as no\r\ninterest could reach; and before he had time to devise any other method\r\nof assisting them, an absolute breach between the sisters had taken\r\nplace. It was the natural result of the conduct of each party, and such\r\nas a very imprudent marriage almost always produces. To save herself\r\nfrom useless remonstrance, Mrs. Price never wrote to her family on the\r\nsubject till actually married. Lady Bertram, who was a woman of very\r\ntranquil feelings, and a temper remarkably easy and indolent, would\r\nhave contented herself with merely giving up her sister, and thinking\r\nno more of the matter; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity, which\r\ncould not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to\r\nFanny, to point out the folly of her conduct, and threaten her with all\r\nits possible ill consequences. Mrs. Price, in her turn, was injured and\r\nangry; and an answer, which comprehended each sister in its bitterness,\r\nand bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir\r\nThomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself, put an end to\r\nall intercourse between them for a considerable period.\r\n\r\nTheir homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved so\r\ndistinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, to\r\nmake it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have\r\nit in her power to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angry\r\nvoice, that Fanny had got another child. By the end of eleven years,\r\nhowever, Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or\r\nresentment, or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her. A\r\nlarge and still increasing family, an husband disabled for active\r\nservice, but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a very\r\nsmall income to supply their wants, made her eager to regain the\r\nfriends she had so carelessly sacrificed; and she addressed Lady\r\nBertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence,\r\nsuch a superfluity of children, and such a want of almost everything\r\nelse, as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation. She was\r\npreparing for her ninth lying-in; and after bewailing the circumstance,\r\nand imploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child, she\r\ncould not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future\r\nmaintenance of the eight already in being. Her eldest was a boy of ten\r\nyears old, a fine spirited fellow, who longed to be out in the world;\r\nbut what could she do? Was there any chance of his being hereafter\r\nuseful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property? No\r\nsituation would be beneath him; or what did Sir Thomas think of\r\nWoolwich? or how could a boy be sent out to the East?\r\n\r\nThe letter was not unproductive. It re-established peace and kindness.\r\nSir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions, Lady Bertram\r\ndispatched money and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.\r\n\r\nSuch were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth a more\r\nimportant advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it. Mrs. Norris was\r\noften observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister\r\nand her family out of her head, and that, much as they had all done for\r\nher, she seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she could not\r\nbut own it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from\r\nthe charge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest\r\ndaughter, a girl now nine years old, of an age to require more\r\nattention than her poor mother could possibly give? The trouble and\r\nexpense of it to them would be nothing, compared with the benevolence\r\nof the action.\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Bertram agreed with her instantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\r\ncannot do better,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9clet us send for the child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent.\r\nHe debated and hesitated;\xe2\x80\x94it was a serious charge;\xe2\x80\x94a girl so brought up\r\nmust be adequately provided for, or there would be cruelty instead of\r\nkindness in taking her from her family. He thought of his own four\r\nchildren, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;\xe2\x80\x94but no sooner had\r\nhe deliberately begun to state his objections, than Mrs. Norris\r\ninterrupted him with a reply to them all, whether stated or not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the\r\ngenerosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a\r\npiece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the\r\nmain as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of\r\nproviding for a child one had in a manner taken into one\xe2\x80\x99s own hands;\r\nand I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my\r\nmite upon such an occasion. Having no children of my own, who should I\r\nlook to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the\r\nchildren of my sisters?\xe2\x80\x94and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just\xe2\x80\x94but you\r\nknow I am a woman of few words and professions. Do not let us be\r\nfrightened from a good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education, and\r\nintroduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the\r\nmeans of settling well, without farther expense to anybody. A niece of\r\nours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow up\r\nin this neighbourhood without many advantages. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say she would be\r\nso handsome as her cousins. I dare say she would not; but she would be\r\nintroduced into the society of this country under such very favourable\r\ncircumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditable\r\nestablishment. You are thinking of your sons\xe2\x80\x94but do not you know that,\r\nof all things upon earth, _that_ is the least likely to happen, brought\r\nup as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It is\r\nmorally impossible. I never knew an instance of it. It is, in fact, the\r\nonly sure way of providing against the connexion. Suppose her a pretty\r\ngirl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence,\r\nand I dare say there would be mischief. The very idea of her having\r\nbeen suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and\r\nneglect, would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered\r\nboys in love with her. But breed her up with them from this time, and\r\nsuppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be\r\nmore to either than a sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a great deal of truth in what you say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Thomas,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a\r\nplan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each.\r\nI only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in, and\r\nthat to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price, and creditable to\r\nourselves, we must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engaged\r\nto secure to her hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision\r\nof a gentlewoman, if no such establishment should offer as you are so\r\nsanguine in expecting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thoroughly understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are everything\r\nthat is generous and considerate, and I am sure we shall never disagree\r\non this point. Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready\r\nenough to do for the good of those I love; and, though I could never\r\nfeel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your\r\nown dear children, nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own, I\r\nshould hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her. Is not she a\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s child? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of\r\nbread to give her? My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm\r\nheart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of\r\nlife than do an ungenerous thing. So, if you are not against it, I will\r\nwrite to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon\r\nas matters are settled, _I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield;\r\n_you_ shall have no trouble about it. My own trouble, you know, I never\r\nregard. I will send Nanny to London on purpose, and she may have a bed\r\nat her cousin the saddler\xe2\x80\x99s, and the child be appointed to meet her\r\nthere. They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach,\r\nunder the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going. I\r\ndare say there is always some reputable tradesman\xe2\x80\x99s wife or other going\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExcept to the attack on Nanny\xe2\x80\x99s cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made any\r\nobjection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvous\r\nbeing accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled,\r\nand the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed. The\r\ndivision of gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to have\r\nbeen equal; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and\r\nconsistent patron of the selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the\r\nleast intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance. As\r\nfar as walking, talking, and contriving reached, she was thoroughly\r\nbenevolent, and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others;\r\nbut her love of money was equal to her love of directing, and she knew\r\nquite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.\r\nHaving married on a narrower income than she had been used to look\r\nforward to, she had, from the first, fancied a very strict line of\r\neconomy necessary; and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soon\r\ngrew into a matter of choice, as an object of that needful solicitude\r\nwhich there were no children to supply. Had there been a family to\r\nprovide for, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her money; but having\r\nno care of that kind, there was nothing to impede her frugality, or\r\nlessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they\r\nhad never lived up to. Under this infatuating principle, counteracted\r\nby no real affection for her sister, it was impossible for her to aim\r\nat more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a\r\ncharity; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk\r\nhome to the Parsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief of\r\nbeing the most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fully\r\nexplained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s calm inquiry of \xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall\r\nthe child come to first, sister, to you or to us?\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Thomas heard\r\nwith some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s power\r\nto take any share in the personal charge of her. He had been\r\nconsidering her as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage, as\r\na desirable companion to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he\r\nfound himself wholly mistaken. Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the\r\nlittle girl\xe2\x80\x99s staying with them, at least as things then were, was\r\nquite out of the question. Poor Mr. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s indifferent state of\r\nhealth made it an impossibility: he could no more bear the noise of a\r\nchild than he could fly; if, indeed, he should ever get well of his\r\ngouty complaints, it would be a different matter: she should then be\r\nglad to take her turn, and think nothing of the inconvenience; but just\r\nnow, poor Mr. Norris took up every moment of her time, and the very\r\nmention of such a thing she was sure would distract him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she had better come to us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram, with the utmost\r\ncomposure. After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, let\r\nher home be in this house. We will endeavour to do our duty by her, and\r\nshe will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age,\r\nand of a regular instructress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich are both very important\r\nconsiderations; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she\r\nhas three girls to teach, or only two\xe2\x80\x94there can be no difference. I\r\nonly wish I could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power. I\r\nam not one of those that spare their own trouble; and Nanny shall fetch\r\nher, however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor\r\naway for three days. I suppose, sister, you will put the child in the\r\nlittle white attic, near the old nurseries. It will be much the best\r\nplace for her, so near Miss Lee, and not far from the girls, and close\r\nby the housemaids, who could either of them help to dress her, you\r\nknow, and take care of her clothes, for I suppose you would not think\r\nit fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others. Indeed, I\r\ndo not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Bertram made no opposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Norris,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould her disposition be really bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Thomas, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must not,\r\nfor our own children\xe2\x80\x99s sake, continue her in the family; but there is\r\nno reason to expect so great an evil. We shall probably see much to\r\nwish altered in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance,\r\nsome meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner;\r\nbut these are not incurable faults; nor, I trust, can they be dangerous\r\nfor her associates. Had my daughters been _younger_ than herself, I\r\nshould have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter\r\nof very serious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing to\r\nfear for _them_, and everything to hope for _her_, from the\r\nassociation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is exactly what I think,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, \xe2\x80\x9cand what I was\r\nsaying to my husband this morning. It will be an education for the\r\nchild, said I, only being with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught her\r\nnothing, she would learn to be good and clever from _them_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she will not tease my poor pug,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram; \xe2\x80\x9cI have but\r\njust got Julia to leave it alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Sir\r\nThomas, \xe2\x80\x9cas to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as\r\nthey grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my _daughters_ the\r\nconsciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of\r\ntheir cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to make\r\nher remember that she is not a _Miss Bertram_. I should wish to see\r\nthem very good friends, and would, on no account, authorise in my girls\r\nthe smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation; but still they\r\ncannot be equals. Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations will\r\nalways be different. It is a point of great delicacy, and you must\r\nassist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of\r\nconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was quite at his service; and though she perfectly agreed\r\nwith him as to its being a most difficult thing, encouraged him to hope\r\nthat between them it would be easily managed.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write to her\r\nsister in vain. Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should\r\nbe fixed on, when she had so many fine boys, but accepted the offer\r\nmost thankfully, assuring them of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s being a very\r\nwell-disposed, good-humoured girl, and trusting they would never have\r\ncause to throw her off. She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate\r\nand puny, but was sanguine in the hope of her being materially better\r\nfor change of air. Poor woman! she probably thought change of air might\r\nagree with many of her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little girl performed her long journey in safety; and at\r\nNorthampton was met by Mrs. Norris, who thus regaled in the credit of\r\nbeing foremost to welcome her, and in the importance of leading her in\r\nto the others, and recommending her to their kindness.\r\n\r\nFanny Price was at this time just ten years old, and though there might\r\nnot be much in her first appearance to captivate, there was, at least,\r\nnothing to disgust her relations. She was small of her age, with no\r\nglow of complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timid\r\nand shy, and shrinking from notice; but her air, though awkward, was\r\nnot vulgar, her voice was sweet, and when she spoke her countenance was\r\npretty. Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly; and Sir\r\nThomas, seeing how much she needed encouragement, tried to be all that\r\nwas conciliating: but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of\r\ndeportment; and Lady Bertram, without taking half so much trouble, or\r\nspeaking one word where he spoke ten, by the mere aid of a\r\ngood-humoured smile, became immediately the less awful character of the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThe young people were all at home, and sustained their share in the\r\nintroduction very well, with much good humour, and no embarrassment, at\r\nleast on the part of the sons, who, at seventeen and sixteen, and tall\r\nof their age, had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little\r\ncousin. The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in\r\ngreater awe of their father, who addressed them on the occasion with\r\nrather an injudicious particularity. But they were too much used to\r\ncompany and praise to have anything like natural shyness; and their\r\nconfidence increasing from their cousin\xe2\x80\x99s total want of it, they were\r\nsoon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nThey were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking, the\r\ndaughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown and forward of\r\ntheir age, which produced as striking a difference between the cousins\r\nin person, as education had given to their address; and no one would\r\nhave supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were. There\r\nwere in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny. Julia\r\nBertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older. The little visitor\r\nmeanwhile was as unhappy as possible. Afraid of everybody, ashamed of\r\nherself, and longing for the home she had left, she knew not how to\r\nlook up, and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying. Mrs.\r\nNorris had been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of her\r\nwonderful good fortune, and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and\r\ngood behaviour which it ought to produce, and her consciousness of\r\nmisery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing\r\nfor her not to be happy. The fatigue, too, of so long a journey, became\r\nsoon no trifling evil. In vain were the well-meant condescensions of\r\nSir Thomas, and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that\r\nshe would be a good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her\r\nsit on the sofa with herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of a\r\ngooseberry tart towards giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallow\r\ntwo mouthfuls before tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be her\r\nlikeliest friend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a very promising beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Norris, when Fanny\r\nhad left the room. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all that I said to her as we came along, I\r\nthought she would have behaved better; I told her how much might depend\r\nupon her acquitting herself well at first. I wish there may not be a\r\nlittle sulkiness of temper\xe2\x80\x94her poor mother had a good deal; but we must\r\nmake allowances for such a child\xe2\x80\x94and I do not know that her being sorry\r\nto leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults, it\r\n_was_ her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she has\r\nchanged for the better; but then there is moderation in all things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt required a longer time, however, than Mrs. Norris was inclined to\r\nallow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park, and the\r\nseparation from everybody she had been used to. Her feelings were very\r\nacute, and too little understood to be properly attended to. Nobody\r\nmeant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way to\r\nsecure her comfort.\r\n\r\nThe holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day, on purpose to\r\nafford leisure for getting acquainted with, and entertaining their\r\nyoung cousin, produced little union. They could not but hold her cheap\r\non finding that she had but two sashes, and had never learned French;\r\nand when they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they were\r\nso good as to play, they could do no more than make her a generous\r\npresent of some of their least valued toys, and leave her to herself,\r\nwhile they adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sport\r\nof the moment, making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper.\r\n\r\nFanny, whether near or from her cousins, whether in the schoolroom, the\r\ndrawing-room, or the shrubbery, was equally forlorn, finding something\r\nto fear in every person and place. She was disheartened by Lady\r\nBertram\xe2\x80\x99s silence, awed by Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s grave looks, and quite overcome\r\nby Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s admonitions. Her elder cousins mortified her by\r\nreflections on her size, and abashed her by noticing her shyness: Miss\r\nLee wondered at her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at her\r\nclothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers\r\nand sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow,\r\ninstructress, and nurse, the despondence that sunk her little heart was\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\nThe grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her. The\r\nrooms were too large for her to move in with ease: whatever she touched\r\nshe expected to injure, and she crept about in constant terror of\r\nsomething or other; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry;\r\nand the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she left\r\nit at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good\r\nfortune, ended every day\xe2\x80\x99s sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep. A week\r\nhad passed in this way, and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet\r\npassive manner, when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund,\r\nthe youngest of the sons, sitting crying on the attic stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear little cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with all the gentleness of an\r\nexcellent nature, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat can be the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d And sitting down by her, he\r\nwas at great pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised, and\r\npersuade her to speak openly. Was she ill? or was anybody angry with\r\nher? or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or was she puzzled\r\nabout anything in her lesson that he could explain? Did she, in short,\r\nwant anything he could possibly get her, or do for her? For a long\r\nwhile no answer could be obtained beyond a \xe2\x80\x9cno, no\xe2\x80\x94not at all\xe2\x80\x94no, thank\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x9d; but he still persevered; and no sooner had he begun to revert to\r\nher own home, than her increased sobs explained to him where the\r\ngrievance lay. He tried to console her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich\r\nshows you to be a very good girl; but you must remember that you are\r\nwith relations and friends, who all love you, and wish to make you\r\nhappy. Let us walk out in the park, and you shall tell me all about\r\nyour brothers and sisters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn pursuing the subject, he found that, dear as all these brothers and\r\nsisters generally were, there was one among them who ran more in her\r\nthoughts than the rest. It was William whom she talked of most, and\r\nwanted most to see. William, the eldest, a year older than herself, her\r\nconstant companion and friend; her advocate with her mother (of whom he\r\nwas the darling) in every distress. \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam did not like she should\r\ncome away; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nWilliam will write to you, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he had promised he would,\r\nbut he had told _her_ to write first.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when shall you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nhung her head and answered hesitatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cshe did not know; she had not\r\nany paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you with paper and\r\nevery other material, and you may write your letter whenever you\r\nchoose. Would it make you happy to write to William?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let it be done now. Come with me into the breakfast-room, we\r\nshall find everything there, and be sure of having the room to\r\nourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, cousin, will it go to the post?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and,\r\nas your uncle will frank it, it will cost William nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when you have written the letter, I will take it to my father to\r\nfrank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny thought it a bold measure, but offered no further resistance; and\r\nthey went together into the breakfast-room, where Edmund prepared her\r\npaper, and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother could\r\nhimself have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness. He\r\ncontinued with her the whole time of her writing, to assist her with\r\nhis penknife or his orthography, as either were wanted; and added to\r\nthese attentions, which she felt very much, a kindness to her brother\r\nwhich delighted her beyond all the rest. He wrote with his own hand his\r\nlove to his cousin William, and sent him half a guinea under the seal.\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herself\r\nincapable of expressing; but her countenance and a few artless words\r\nfully conveyed all their gratitude and delight, and her cousin began to\r\nfind her an interesting object. He talked to her more, and, from all\r\nthat she said, was convinced of her having an affectionate heart, and a\r\nstrong desire of doing right; and he could perceive her to be farther\r\nentitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation, and great\r\ntimidity. He had never knowingly given her pain, but he now felt that\r\nshe required more positive kindness; and with that view endeavoured, in\r\nthe first place, to lessen her fears of them all, and gave her\r\nespecially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria and\r\nJulia, and being as merry as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom this day Fanny grew more comfortable. She felt that she had a\r\nfriend, and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spirits\r\nwith everybody else. The place became less strange, and the people less\r\nformidable; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not\r\ncease to fear, she began at least to know their ways, and to catch the\r\nbest manner of conforming to them. The little rusticities and\r\nawkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on the\r\ntranquillity of all, and not least of herself, necessarily wore away,\r\nand she was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle, nor\r\ndid her aunt Norris\xe2\x80\x99s voice make her start very much. To her cousins\r\nshe became occasionally an acceptable companion. Though unworthy, from\r\ninferiority of age and strength, to be their constant associate, their\r\npleasures and schemes were sometimes of a nature to make a third very\r\nuseful, especially when that third was of an obliging, yielding temper;\r\nand they could not but own, when their aunt inquired into her faults,\r\nor their brother Edmund urged her claims to their kindness, that \xe2\x80\x9cFanny\r\nwas good-natured enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund was uniformly kind himself; and she had nothing worse to endure\r\non the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of\r\nseventeen will always think fair with a child of ten. He was just\r\nentering into life, full of spirits, and with all the liberal\r\ndispositions of an eldest son, who feels born only for expense and\r\nenjoyment. His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his\r\nsituation and rights: he made her some very pretty presents, and\r\nlaughed at her.\r\n\r\nAs her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris\r\nthought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it was\r\npretty soon decided between them that, though far from clever, she\r\nshowed a tractable disposition, and seemed likely to give them little\r\ntrouble. A mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to _them_.\r\nFanny could read, work, and write, but she had been taught nothing\r\nmore; and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which\r\nthey had been long familiar, they thought her prodigiously stupid, and\r\nfor the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh\r\nreport of it into the drawing-room. \xe2\x80\x9cDear mama, only think, my cousin\r\ncannot put the map of Europe together\xe2\x80\x94or my cousin cannot tell the\r\nprincipal rivers in Russia\xe2\x80\x94or, she never heard of Asia Minor\xe2\x80\x94or she\r\ndoes not know the difference between water-colours and crayons!\xe2\x80\x94How\r\nstrange!\xe2\x80\x94Did you ever hear anything so stupid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d their considerate aunt would reply, \xe2\x80\x9cit is very bad, but you\r\nmust not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, aunt, she is really so very ignorant!\xe2\x80\x94Do you know, we asked her\r\nlast night which way she would go to get to Ireland; and she said, she\r\nshould cross to the Isle of Wight. She thinks of nothing but the Isle\r\nof Wight, and she calls it _the_ _Island_, as if there were no other\r\nisland in the world. I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself, if\r\nI had not known better long before I was so old as she is. I cannot\r\nremember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the\r\nleast notion of yet. How long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeat\r\nthe chronological order of the kings of England, with the dates of\r\ntheir accession, and most of the principal events of their reigns!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d added the other; \xe2\x80\x9cand of the Roman emperors as low as Severus;\r\nbesides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the metals,\r\nsemi-metals, planets, and distinguished philosophers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderful\r\nmemories, and your poor cousin has probably none at all. There is a\r\nvast deal of difference in memories, as well as in everything else, and\r\ntherefore you must make allowance for your cousin, and pity her\r\ndeficiency. And remember that, if you are ever so forward and clever\r\nyourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as you know already,\r\nthere is a great deal more for you to learn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know there is, till I am seventeen. But I must tell you another\r\nthing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid. Do you know, she says she does\r\nnot want to learn either music or drawing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a great\r\nwant of genius and emulation. But, all things considered, I do not know\r\nwhether it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know\r\n(owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with\r\nyou, it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as\r\nyou are;\xe2\x80\x94on the contrary, it is much more desirable that there should\r\nbe a difference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her\r\nnieces\xe2\x80\x99 minds; and it is not very wonderful that, with all their\r\npromising talents and early information, they should be entirely\r\ndeficient in the less common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity\r\nand humility. In everything but disposition they were admirably taught.\r\nSir Thomas did not know what was wanting, because, though a truly\r\nanxious father, he was not outwardly affectionate, and the reserve of\r\nhis manner repressed all the flow of their spirits before him.\r\n\r\nTo the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallest\r\nattention. She had not time for such cares. She was a woman who spent\r\nher days in sitting, nicely dressed, on a sofa, doing some long piece\r\nof needlework, of little use and no beauty, thinking more of her pug\r\nthan her children, but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put\r\nherself to inconvenience, guided in everything important by Sir Thomas,\r\nand in smaller concerns by her sister. Had she possessed greater\r\nleisure for the service of her girls, she would probably have supposed\r\nit unnecessary, for they were under the care of a governess, with\r\nproper masters, and could want nothing more. As for Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\nstupid at learning, \xe2\x80\x9cshe could only say it was very unlucky, but some\r\npeople _were_ stupid, and Fanny must take more pains: she did not know\r\nwhat else was to be done; and, except her being so dull, she must add\r\nshe saw no harm in the poor little thing, and always found her very\r\nhandy and quick in carrying messages, and fetching what she wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed at\r\nMansfield Park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of her\r\nattachment to her former home, grew up there not unhappily among her\r\ncousins. There was no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia; and though\r\nFanny was often mortified by their treatment of her, she thought too\r\nlowly of her own claims to feel injured by it.\r\n\r\nFrom about the time of her entering the family, Lady Bertram, in\r\nconsequence of a little ill-health, and a great deal of indolence, gave\r\nup the house in town, which she had been used to occupy every spring,\r\nand remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas to attend his\r\nduty in Parliament, with whatever increase or diminution of comfort\r\nmight arise from her absence. In the country, therefore, the Miss\r\nBertrams continued to exercise their memories, practise their duets,\r\nand grow tall and womanly: and their father saw them becoming in\r\nperson, manner, and accomplishments, everything that could satisfy his\r\nanxiety. His eldest son was careless and extravagant, and had already\r\ngiven him much uneasiness; but his other children promised him nothing\r\nbut good. His daughters, he felt, while they retained the name of\r\nBertram, must be giving it new grace, and in quitting it, he trusted,\r\nwould extend its respectable alliances; and the character of Edmund,\r\nhis strong good sense and uprightness of mind, bid most fairly for\r\nutility, honour, and happiness to himself and all his connexions. He\r\nwas to be a clergyman.\r\n\r\nAmid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested,\r\nSir Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs.\r\nPrice: he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her\r\nsons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit; and Fanny,\r\nthough almost totally separated from her family, was sensible of the\r\ntruest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them, or of\r\nanything at all promising in their situation or conduct. Once, and once\r\nonly, in the course of many years, had she the happiness of being with\r\nWilliam. Of the rest she saw nothing: nobody seemed to think of her\r\never going amongst them again, even for a visit, nobody at home seemed\r\nto want her; but William determining, soon after her removal, to be a\r\nsailor, was invited to spend a week with his sister in Northamptonshire\r\nbefore he went to sea. Their eager affection in meeting, their\r\nexquisite delight in being together, their hours of happy mirth, and\r\nmoments of serious conference, may be imagined; as well as the sanguine\r\nviews and spirits of the boy even to the last, and the misery of the\r\ngirl when he left her. Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas\r\nholidays, when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin\r\nEdmund; and he told her such charming things of what William was to do,\r\nand be hereafter, in consequence of his profession, as made her\r\ngradually admit that the separation might have some use. Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriendship never failed her: his leaving Eton for Oxford made no change\r\nin his kind dispositions, and only afforded more frequent opportunities\r\nof proving them. Without any display of doing more than the rest, or\r\nany fear of doing too much, he was always true to her interests, and\r\nconsiderate of her feelings, trying to make her good qualities\r\nunderstood, and to conquer the diffidence which prevented their being\r\nmore apparent; giving her advice, consolation, and encouragement.\r\n\r\nKept back as she was by everybody else, his single support could not\r\nbring her forward; but his attentions were otherwise of the highest\r\nimportance in assisting the improvement of her mind, and extending its\r\npleasures. He knew her to be clever, to have a quick apprehension as\r\nwell as good sense, and a fondness for reading, which, properly\r\ndirected, must be an education in itself. Miss Lee taught her French,\r\nand heard her read the daily portion of history; but he recommended the\r\nbooks which charmed her leisure hours, he encouraged her taste, and\r\ncorrected her judgment: he made reading useful by talking to her of\r\nwhat she read, and heightened its attraction by judicious praise. In\r\nreturn for such services she loved him better than anybody in the world\r\nexcept William: her heart was divided between the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr.\r\nNorris, which happened when Fanny was about fifteen, and necessarily\r\nintroduced alterations and novelties. Mrs. Norris, on quitting the\r\nParsonage, removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small house\r\nof Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s in the village, and consoled herself for the loss of\r\nher husband by considering that she could do very well without him; and\r\nfor her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe living was hereafter for Edmund; and, had his uncle died a few\r\nyears sooner, it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till\r\nhe were old enough for orders. But Tom\xe2\x80\x99s extravagance had, previous to\r\nthat event, been so great as to render a different disposal of the next\r\npresentation necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for\r\nthe pleasures of the elder. There was another family living actually\r\nheld for Edmund; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement\r\nsomewhat easier to Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s conscience, he could not but feel it to\r\nbe an act of injustice, and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest\r\nson with the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better\r\neffect than anything he had yet been able to say or do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI blush for you, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in his most dignified manner; \xe2\x80\x9cI blush\r\nfor the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust I may pity your\r\nfeelings as a brother on the occasion. You have robbed Edmund for ten,\r\ntwenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income\r\nwhich ought to be his. It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours (I\r\nhope it will), to procure him better preferment; but it must not be\r\nforgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his\r\nnatural claims on us, and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent\r\nfor the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the\r\nurgency of your debts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom listened with some shame and some sorrow; but escaping as quickly\r\nas possible, could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect, firstly,\r\nthat he had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends;\r\nsecondly, that his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it;\r\nand, thirdly, that the future incumbent, whoever he might be, would, in\r\nall probability, die very soon.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant,\r\nwho came consequently to reside at Mansfield; and on proving to be a\r\nhearty man of forty-five, seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncalculations. But \xe2\x80\x9cno, he was a short-necked, apoplectic sort of\r\nfellow, and, plied well with good things, would soon pop off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had a wife about fifteen years his junior, but no children; and they\r\nentered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very\r\nrespectable, agreeable people.\r\n\r\nThe time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister-in-law to\r\nclaim her share in their niece, the change in Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s situation,\r\nand the improvement in Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s age, seeming not merely to do away any\r\nformer objection to their living together, but even to give it the most\r\ndecided eligibility; and as his own circumstances were rendered less\r\nfair than heretofore, by some recent losses on his West India estate,\r\nin addition to his eldest son\xe2\x80\x99s extravagance, it became not undesirable\r\nto himself to be relieved from the expense of her support, and the\r\nobligation of her future provision. In the fullness of his belief that\r\nsuch a thing must be, he mentioned its probability to his wife; and the\r\nfirst time of the subject\xe2\x80\x99s occurring to her again happening to be when\r\nFanny was present, she calmly observed to her, \xe2\x80\x9cSo, Fanny, you are\r\ngoing to leave us, and live with my sister. How shall you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to leave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear; why should you be astonished? You have been five years\r\nwith us, and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died.\r\nBut you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected. She\r\nhad never received kindness from her aunt Norris, and could not love\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very sorry to go away,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a faltering voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I dare say you will; _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ natural enough. I suppose you have\r\nhad as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature\r\nin the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I am not ungrateful, aunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny modestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear; I hope not. I have always found you a very good girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd am I never to live here again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home. It can make\r\nvery little difference to you, whether you are in one house or the\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could not feel the\r\ndifference to be so small, she could not think of living with her aunt\r\nwith anything like satisfaction. As soon as she met with Edmund she\r\ntold him her distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9csomething is going to happen which I do not like\r\nat all; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to\r\nthings that I disliked at first, you will not be able to do it now. I\r\nam going to live entirely with my aunt Norris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so. It is quite settled. I am to\r\nleave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House, I suppose, as soon as\r\nshe is removed there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, I should call\r\nit an excellent one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, cousin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has everything else in its favour. My aunt is acting like a\r\nsensible woman in wishing for you. She is choosing a friend and\r\ncompanion exactly where she ought, and I am glad her love of money does\r\nnot interfere. You will be what you ought to be to her. I hope it does\r\nnot distress you very much, Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed it does: I cannot like it. I love this house and everything in\r\nit: I shall love nothing there. You know how uncomfortable I feel with\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can say nothing for her manner to you as a child; but it was the\r\nsame with us all, or nearly so. She never knew how to be pleasant to\r\nchildren. But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she\r\nis behaving better already; and when you are her only companion, you\r\n_must_ be important to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can never be important to any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to prevent you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything. My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, you\r\nnever have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly.\r\nThere is no reason in the world why you should not be important where\r\nyou are known. You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure\r\nyou have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness without\r\nwishing to return it. I do not know any better qualifications for a\r\nfriend and companion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, colouring at such praise; \xe2\x80\x9chow shall I\r\never thank you as I ought, for thinking so well of me. Oh! cousin, if I\r\nam to go away, I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at such a distance\r\nas the White House. You speak as if you were going two hundred miles\r\noff instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almost\r\nas much as ever. The two families will be meeting every day in the\r\nyear. The only difference will be that, living with your aunt, you will\r\nnecessarily be brought forward as you ought to be. _Here_ there are too\r\nmany whom you can hide behind; but with _her_ you will be forced to\r\nspeak for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! do not say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say it, and say it with pleasure. Mrs. Norris is much better\r\nfitted than my mother for having the charge of you now. She is of a\r\ntemper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself\r\nabout, and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny sighed, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot see things as you do; but I ought to\r\nbelieve you to be right rather than myself, and I am very much obliged\r\nto you for trying to reconcile me to what must be. If I could suppose\r\nmy aunt really to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself of\r\nconsequence to anybody. _Here_, I know, I am of none, and yet I love\r\nthe place so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the\r\nhouse. You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever.\r\nEven _your_ constant little heart need not take fright at such a\r\nnominal change. You will have the same walks to frequent, the same\r\nlibrary to choose from, the same people to look at, the same horse to\r\nride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true. Yes, dear old grey pony! Ah! cousin, when I remember how\r\nmuch I used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to hear it talked\r\nof as likely to do me good (oh! how I have trembled at my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopening his lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind\r\npains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convince\r\nme that I should like it after a little while, and feel how right you\r\nproved to be, I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as\r\ngood for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for\r\nyour ultimate happiness too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service it\r\ncould render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for Mrs. Norris had\r\nnot the smallest intention of taking her. It had never occurred to her,\r\non the present occasion, but as a thing to be carefully avoided. To\r\nprevent its being expected, she had fixed on the smallest habitation\r\nwhich could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish,\r\nthe White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her\r\nservants, and allow a spare room for a friend, of which she made a very\r\nparticular point. The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been\r\nwanted, but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now\r\nnever forgotten. Not all her precautions, however, could save her from\r\nbeing suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her very display of\r\nthe importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose\r\nit really intended for Fanny. Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a\r\ncertainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer, when Fanny goes\r\nto live with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris almost started. \xe2\x80\x9cLive with me, dear Lady Bertram! what do\r\nyou mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she not to live with you? I thought you had settled it with Sir\r\nThomas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe! never. I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas, nor he to\r\nme. Fanny live with me! the last thing in the world for me to think of,\r\nor for anybody to wish that really knows us both. Good heaven! what\r\ncould I do with Fanny? Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for\r\nanything, my spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl at\r\nher time of life? A girl of fifteen! the very age of all others to need\r\nmost attention and care, and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test!\r\nSure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing! Sir Thomas is\r\ntoo much my friend. Nobody that wishes me well, I am sure, would\r\npropose it. How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I do not know. I suppose he thought it best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did he say? He could not say he _wished_ me to take Fanny. I\r\nam sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he only said he thought it very likely; and I thought so too. We\r\nboth thought it would be a comfort to you. But if you do not like it,\r\nthere is no more to be said. She is no encumbrance here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she be any\r\ncomfort to me? Here am I, a poor desolate widow, deprived of the best\r\nof husbands, my health gone in attending and nursing him, my spirits\r\nstill worse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough\r\nto support me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as\r\nnot to disgrace the memory of the dear departed\xe2\x80\x94what possible comfort\r\ncould I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny? If I could wish\r\nit for my own sake, I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl.\r\nShe is in good hands, and sure of doing well. I must struggle through\r\nmy sorrows and difficulties as I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Bertram, I do not complain. I know I cannot live as I have done,\r\nbut I must retrench where I can, and learn to be a better manager. I\r\n_have_ _been_ a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamed\r\nto practise economy now. My situation is as much altered as my income.\r\nA great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of the\r\nparish, that cannot be expected from me. It is unknown how much was\r\nconsumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers. At the White House,\r\nmatters must be better looked after. I _must_ live within my income, or\r\nI shall be miserable; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to\r\nbe able to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of the year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you will. You always do, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that come after me.\r\nIt is for your children\xe2\x80\x99s good that I wish to be richer. I have nobody\r\nelse to care for, but I should be very glad to think I could leave a\r\nlittle trifle among them worth their having.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them. They are\r\nsure of being well provided for. Sir Thomas will take care of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you know, Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s means will be rather straitened if the\r\nAntigua estate is to make such poor returns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! _that_ will soon be settled. Sir Thomas has been writing about it,\r\nI know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lady Bertram,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Norris, moving to go, \xe2\x80\x9cI can only say\r\nthat my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir\r\nThomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be able\r\nto say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;\r\nbesides that, I really should not have a bed to give her, for I must\r\nkeep a spare room for a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to\r\nconvince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s views; and\r\nshe was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or the\r\nslightest allusion to it from him. He could not but wonder at her\r\nrefusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to\r\nadopt; but, as she took early care to make him, as well as Lady\r\nBertram, understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their\r\nfamily, he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which, at the same\r\ntime that it was advantageous and complimentary to them, would enable\r\nhim better to provide for Fanny himself.\r\n\r\nFanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal; and\r\nher spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed some\r\nconsolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to\r\nbe so essentially serviceable to her. Mrs. Norris took possession of\r\nthe White House, the Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these events\r\nover, everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.\r\n\r\nThe Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable, gave\r\ngreat satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance. They had\r\ntheir faults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out. The Doctor was very\r\nfond of eating, and would have a good dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant,\r\ninstead of contriving to gratify him at little expense, gave her cook\r\nas high wages as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever seen\r\nin her offices. Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such\r\ngrievances, nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly\r\nconsumed in the house. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody loved plenty and hospitality more than\r\nherself; nobody more hated pitiful doings; the Parsonage, she believed,\r\nhad never been wanting in comforts of any sort, had never borne a bad\r\ncharacter in _her_ _time_, but this was a way of going on that she\r\ncould not understand. A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out\r\nof place. _Her_ store-room, she thought, might have been good enough\r\nfor Mrs. Grant to go into. Inquire where she would, she could not find\r\nout that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective.\r\nShe could not enter into the wrongs of an economist, but she felt all\r\nthe injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s being so well settled in life\r\nwithout being handsome, and expressed her astonishment on that point\r\nalmost as often, though not so diffusely, as Mrs. Norris discussed the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThese opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event\r\narose of such importance in the family, as might fairly claim some\r\nplace in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies. Sir Thomas found\r\nit expedient to go to Antigua himself, for the better arrangement of\r\nhis affairs, and he took his eldest son with him, in the hope of\r\ndetaching him from some bad connexions at home. They left England with\r\nthe probability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light, and the hope of its\r\nutility to his son, reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the\r\nrest of his family, and of leaving his daughters to the direction of\r\nothers at their present most interesting time of life. He could not\r\nthink Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them, or\r\nrather, to perform what should have been her own; but, in Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwatchful attention, and in Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, he had sufficient\r\nconfidence to make him go without fears for their conduct.\r\n\r\nLady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her; but she\r\nwas not disturbed by any alarm for his safety, or solicitude for his\r\ncomfort, being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous,\r\nor difficult, or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion: not for their\r\nsorrow, but for their want of it. Their father was no object of love to\r\nthem; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his\r\nabsence was unhappily most welcome. They were relieved by it from all\r\nrestraint; and without aiming at one gratification that would probably\r\nhave been forbidden by Sir Thomas, they felt themselves immediately at\r\ntheir own disposal, and to have every indulgence within their reach.\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s relief, and her consciousness of it, were quite equal to her\r\ncousins\xe2\x80\x99; but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were\r\nungrateful, and she really grieved because she could not grieve. \xe2\x80\x9cSir\r\nThomas, who had done so much for her and her brothers, and who was gone\r\nperhaps never to return! that she should see him go without a tear! it\r\nwas a shameful insensibility.\xe2\x80\x9d He had said to her, moreover, on the\r\nvery last morning, that he hoped she might see William again in the\r\ncourse of the ensuing winter, and had charged her to write and invite\r\nhim to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be\r\nknown to be in England. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was so thoughtful and kind!\xe2\x80\x9d and would he\r\nonly have smiled upon her, and called her \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d while he\r\nsaid it, every former frown or cold address might have been forgotten.\r\nBut he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification,\r\nby adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIf William does come to Mansfield, I hope you may be able\r\nto convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted\r\nhave not been spent on your side entirely without improvement; though,\r\nI fear, he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much\r\nlike his sister at ten.\xe2\x80\x9d She cried bitterly over this reflection when\r\nher uncle was gone; and her cousins, on seeing her with red eyes, set\r\nher down as a hypocrite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that he\r\ncould be only nominally missed; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished to\r\nfind how very well they did even without his father, how well Edmund\r\ncould supply his place in carving, talking to the steward, writing to\r\nthe attorney, settling with the servants, and equally saving her from\r\nall possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of\r\ndirecting her letters.\r\n\r\nThe earliest intelligence of the travellers\xe2\x80\x99 safe arrival at Antigua,\r\nafter a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norris\r\nhad been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund\r\nparticipate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended\r\non being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe,\r\nshe had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others,\r\nwhen Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s assurances of their both being alive and well made it\r\nnecessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches\r\nfor a while.\r\n\r\nThe winter came and passed without their being called for; the accounts\r\ncontinued perfectly good; and Mrs. Norris, in promoting gaieties for\r\nher nieces, assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments,\r\nand looking about for their future husbands, had so much to do as, in\r\naddition to all her own household cares, some interference in those of\r\nher sister, and Mrs. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s wasteful doings to overlook, left her very\r\nlittle occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the belles of the\r\nneighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirements\r\na manner naturally easy, and carefully formed to general civility and\r\nobligingness, they possessed its favour as well as its admiration.\r\nTheir vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free\r\nfrom it, and gave themselves no airs; while the praises attending such\r\nbehaviour, secured and brought round by their aunt, served to\r\nstrengthen them in believing they had no faults.\r\n\r\nLady Bertram did not go into public with her daughters. She was too\r\nindolent even to accept a mother\xe2\x80\x99s gratification in witnessing their\r\nsuccess and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble, and the\r\ncharge was made over to her sister, who desired nothing better than a\r\npost of such honourable representation, and very thoroughly relished\r\nthe means it afforded her of mixing in society without having horses to\r\nhire.\r\n\r\nFanny had no share in the festivities of the season; but she enjoyed\r\nbeing avowedly useful as her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s companion when they called away the\r\nrest of the family; and, as Miss Lee had left Mansfield, she naturally\r\nbecame everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a\r\nparty. She talked to her, listened to her, read to her; and the\r\ntranquillity of such evenings, her perfect security in such a\r\n_t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ from any sound of unkindness, was unspeakably welcome to\r\na mind which had seldom known a pause in its alarms or embarrassments.\r\nAs to her cousins\xe2\x80\x99 gaieties, she loved to hear an account of them,\r\nespecially of the balls, and whom Edmund had danced with; but thought\r\ntoo lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted\r\nto the same, and listened, therefore, without an idea of any nearer\r\nconcern in them. Upon the whole, it was a comfortable winter to her;\r\nfor though it brought no William to England, the never-failing hope of\r\nhis arrival was worth much.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend, the old grey\r\npony; and for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in her\r\nhealth as well as in her affections; for in spite of the acknowledged\r\nimportance of her riding on horse-back, no measures were taken for\r\nmounting her again, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause,\xe2\x80\x9d as it was observed by her aunts, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\r\nmight ride one of her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s horses at any time when they did not\r\nwant them,\xe2\x80\x9d and as the Miss Bertrams regularly wanted their horses\r\nevery fine day, and had no idea of carrying their obliging manners to\r\nthe sacrifice of any real pleasure, that time, of course, never came.\r\nThey took their cheerful rides in the fine mornings of April and May;\r\nand Fanny either sat at home the whole day with one aunt, or walked\r\nbeyond her strength at the instigation of the other: Lady Bertram\r\nholding exercise to be as unnecessary for everybody as it was\r\nunpleasant to herself; and Mrs. Norris, who was walking all day,\r\nthinking everybody ought to walk as much. Edmund was absent at this\r\ntime, or the evil would have been earlier remedied. When he returned,\r\nto understand how Fanny was situated, and perceived its ill effects,\r\nthere seemed with him but one thing to be done; and that \xe2\x80\x9cFanny must\r\nhave a horse\xe2\x80\x9d was the resolute declaration with which he opposed\r\nwhatever could be urged by the supineness of his mother, or the economy\r\nof his aunt, to make it appear unimportant. Mrs. Norris could not help\r\nthinking that some steady old thing might be found among the numbers\r\nbelonging to the Park that would do vastly well; or that one might be\r\nborrowed of the steward; or that perhaps Dr. Grant might now and then\r\nlend them the pony he sent to the post. She could not but consider it\r\nas absolutely unnecessary, and even improper, that Fanny should have a\r\nregular lady\xe2\x80\x99s horse of her own, in the style of her cousins. She was\r\nsure Sir Thomas had never intended it: and she must say that, to be\r\nmaking such a purchase in his absence, and adding to the great expenses\r\nof his stable, at a time when a large part of his income was unsettled,\r\nseemed to her very unjustifiable. \xe2\x80\x9cFanny must have a horse,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nEdmund\xe2\x80\x99s only reply. Mrs. Norris could not see it in the same light.\r\nLady Bertram did: she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessity\r\nof it, and as to its being considered necessary by his father; she only\r\npleaded against there being any hurry; she only wanted him to wait till\r\nSir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s return, and then Sir Thomas might settle it all himself.\r\nHe would be at home in September, and where would be the harm of only\r\nwaiting till September?\r\n\r\nThough Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with his\r\nmother, as evincing least regard for her niece, he could not help\r\npaying more attention to what she said; and at length determined on a\r\nmethod of proceeding which would obviate the risk of his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthinking he had done too much, and at the same time procure for Fanny\r\nthe immediate means of exercise, which he could not bear she should be\r\nwithout. He had three horses of his own, but not one that would carry a\r\nwoman. Two of them were hunters; the third, a useful road-horse: this\r\nthird he resolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride; he\r\nknew where such a one was to be met with; and having once made up his\r\nmind, the whole business was soon completed. The new mare proved a\r\ntreasure; with a very little trouble she became exactly calculated for\r\nthe purpose, and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her.\r\nShe had not supposed before that anything could ever suit her like the\r\nold grey pony; but her delight in Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s mare was far beyond any\r\nformer pleasure of the sort; and the addition it was ever receiving in\r\nthe consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung, was\r\nbeyond all her words to express. She regarded her cousin as an example\r\nof everything good and great, as possessing worth which no one but\r\nherself could ever appreciate, and as entitled to such gratitude from\r\nher as no feelings could be strong enough to pay. Her sentiments\r\ntowards him were compounded of all that was respectful, grateful,\r\nconfiding, and tender.\r\n\r\nAs the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of\r\nEdmund, Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s use; and had\r\nLady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again, he might have\r\nbeen excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s return in\r\nSeptember, for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, and\r\nwithout any near prospect of finishing his business. Unfavourable\r\ncircumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning to\r\nturn all his thoughts towards England; and the very great uncertainty\r\nin which everything was then involved determined him on sending home\r\nhis son, and waiting the final arrangement by himself. Tom arrived\r\nsafely, bringing an excellent account of his father\xe2\x80\x99s health; but to\r\nvery little purpose, as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned. Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsending away his son seemed to her so like a parent\xe2\x80\x99s care, under the\r\ninfluence of a foreboding of evil to himself, that she could not help\r\nfeeling dreadful presentiments; and as the long evenings of autumn came\r\non, was so terribly haunted by these ideas, in the sad solitariness of\r\nher cottage, as to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining-room\r\nof the Park. The return of winter engagements, however, was not without\r\nits effect; and in the course of their progress, her mind became so\r\npleasantly occupied in superintending the fortunes of her eldest niece,\r\nas tolerably to quiet her nerves. \xe2\x80\x9cIf poor Sir Thomas were fated never\r\nto return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria\r\nwell married,\xe2\x80\x9d she very often thought; always when they were in the\r\ncompany of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a\r\nyoung man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and\r\nfinest places in the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of Miss\r\nBertram, and, being inclined to marry, soon fancied himself in love. He\r\nwas a heavy young man, with not more than common sense; but as there\r\nwas nothing disagreeable in his figure or address, the young lady was\r\nwell pleased with her conquest. Being now in her twenty-first year,\r\nMaria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as a\r\nmarriage with Mr. Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger\r\nincome than her father\xe2\x80\x99s, as well as ensure her the house in town,\r\nwhich was now a prime object, it became, by the same rule of moral\r\nobligation, her evident duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could. Mrs.\r\nNorris was most zealous in promoting the match, by every suggestion and\r\ncontrivance likely to enhance its desirableness to either party; and,\r\namong other means, by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s mother,\r\nwho at present lived with him, and to whom she even forced Lady Bertram\r\nto go through ten miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit. It\r\nwas not long before a good understanding took place between this lady\r\nand herself. Mrs. Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her\r\nson should marry, and declared that of all the young ladies she had\r\never seen, Miss Bertram seemed, by her amiable qualities and\r\naccomplishments, the best adapted to make him happy. Mrs. Norris\r\naccepted the compliment, and admired the nice discernment of character\r\nwhich could so well distinguish merit. Maria was indeed the pride and\r\ndelight of them all\xe2\x80\x94perfectly faultless\xe2\x80\x94an angel; and, of course, so\r\nsurrounded by admirers, must be difficult in her choice: but yet, as\r\nfar as Mrs. Norris could allow herself to decide on so short an\r\nacquaintance, Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve\r\nand attach her.\r\n\r\nAfter dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young\r\npeople justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due\r\nreference to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the\r\nsatisfaction of their respective families, and of the general\r\nlookers-on of the neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the\r\nexpediency of Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s marrying Miss Bertram.\r\n\r\nIt was some months before Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s consent could be received; but,\r\nin the meanwhile, as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure\r\nin the connexion, the intercourse of the two families was carried on\r\nwithout restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs.\r\nNorris\xe2\x80\x99s talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nEdmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the\r\nbusiness; but no representation of his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s could induce him to find\r\nMr. Rushworth a desirable companion. He could allow his sister to be\r\nthe best judge of her own happiness, but he was not pleased that her\r\nhappiness should centre in a large income; nor could he refrain from\r\noften saying to himself, in Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s company\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIf this man had\r\nnot twelve thousand a year, he would be a very stupid fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance so\r\nunquestionably advantageous, and of which he heard nothing but the\r\nperfectly good and agreeable. It was a connexion exactly of the right\r\nsort\xe2\x80\x94in the same county, and the same interest\xe2\x80\x94and his most hearty\r\nconcurrence was conveyed as soon as possible. He only conditioned that\r\nthe marriage should not take place before his return, which he was\r\nagain looking eagerly forward to. He wrote in April, and had strong\r\nhopes of settling everything to his entire satisfaction, and leaving\r\nAntigua before the end of the summer.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had just\r\nreached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village received\r\nan addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss\r\nCrawford, the children of her mother by a second marriage. They were\r\nyoung people of fortune. The son had a good estate in Norfolk, the\r\ndaughter twenty thousand pounds. As children, their sister had been\r\nalways very fond of them; but, as her own marriage had been soon\r\nfollowed by the death of their common parent, which left them to the\r\ncare of a brother of their father, of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she\r\nhad scarcely seen them since. In their uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house they had found a\r\nkind home. Admiral and Mrs. Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else,\r\nwere united in affection for these children, or, at least, were no\r\nfarther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite,\r\nto whom they showed the greatest fondness of the two. The Admiral\r\ndelighted in the boy, Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl; and it was the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s death which now obliged her _protegee_, after some months\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfurther trial at her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house, to find another home. Admiral\r\nCrawford was a man of vicious conduct, who chose, instead of retaining\r\nhis niece, to bring his mistress under his own roof; and to this Mrs.\r\nGrant was indebted for her sister\xe2\x80\x99s proposal of coming to her, a\r\nmeasure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the\r\nother; for Mrs. Grant, having by this time run through the usual\r\nresources of ladies residing in the country without a family of\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94having more than filled her favourite sitting-room with pretty\r\nfurniture, and made a choice collection of plants and poultry\xe2\x80\x94was very\r\nmuch in want of some variety at home. The arrival, therefore, of a\r\nsister whom she had always loved, and now hoped to retain with her as\r\nlong as she remained single, was highly agreeable; and her chief\r\nanxiety was lest Mansfield should not satisfy the habits of a young\r\nwoman who had been mostly used to London.\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions, though\r\nthey arose principally from doubts of her sister\xe2\x80\x99s style of living and\r\ntone of society; and it was not till after she had tried in vain to\r\npersuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house, that\r\nshe could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations. To\r\nanything like a permanence of abode, or limitation of society, Henry\r\nCrawford had, unluckily, a great dislike: he could not accommodate his\r\nsister in an article of such importance; but he escorted her, with the\r\nutmost kindness, into Northamptonshire, and as readily engaged to fetch\r\nher away again, at half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice, whenever she were weary of\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was very satisfactory on each side. Miss Crawford found a\r\nsister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister\xe2\x80\x99s husband who looked\r\nthe gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs.\r\nGrant received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young\r\nman and woman of very prepossessing appearance. Mary Crawford was\r\nremarkably pretty; Henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance;\r\nthe manners of both were lively and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant\r\nimmediately gave them credit for everything else. She was delighted\r\nwith each, but Mary was her dearest object; and having never been able\r\nto glory in beauty of her own, she thoroughly enjoyed the power of\r\nbeing proud of her sister\xe2\x80\x99s. She had not waited her arrival to look out\r\nfor a suitable match for her: she had fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldest\r\nson of a baronet was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds,\r\nwith all the elegance and accomplishments which Mrs. Grant foresaw in\r\nher; and being a warm-hearted, unreserved woman, Mary had not been\r\nthree hours in the house before she told her what she had planned.\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very\r\nnear them, and not at all displeased either at her sister\xe2\x80\x99s early care,\r\nor the choice it had fallen on. Matrimony was her object, provided she\r\ncould marry well: and having seen Mr. Bertram in town, she knew that\r\nobjection could no more be made to his person than to his situation in\r\nlife. While she treated it as a joke, therefore, she did not forget to\r\nthink of it seriously. The scheme was soon repeated to Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs. Grant, \xe2\x80\x9cI have thought of something to make it\r\ncomplete. I should dearly love to settle you both in this country; and\r\ntherefore, Henry, you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice,\r\nhandsome, good-humoured, accomplished girl, who will make you very\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry bowed and thanked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cif you can persuade him into anything of\r\nthe sort, it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself\r\nallied to anybody so clever, and I shall only regret that you have not\r\nhalf a dozen daughters to dispose of. If you can persuade Henry to\r\nmarry, you must have the address of a Frenchwoman. All that English\r\nabilities can do has been tried already. I have three very particular\r\nfriends who have been all dying for him in their turn; and the pains\r\nwhich they, their mothers (very clever women), as well as my dear aunt\r\nand myself, have taken to reason, coax, or trick him into marrying, is\r\ninconceivable! He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined. If\r\nyour Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke, let them\r\navoid Henry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear brother, I will not believe this of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am sure you are too good. You will be kinder than Mary. You will\r\nallow for the doubts of youth and inexperience. I am of a cautious\r\ntemper, and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry. Nobody can think\r\nmore highly of the matrimonial state than myself. I consider the\r\nblessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of\r\nthe poet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s _last_ best gift.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, Mrs. Grant, you see how he dwells on one word, and only look at\r\nhis smile. I assure you he is very detestable; the Admiral\xe2\x80\x99s lessons\r\nhave quite spoiled him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pay very little regard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Grant, \xe2\x80\x9cto what any young person\r\nsays on the subject of marriage. If they profess a disinclination for\r\nit, I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no\r\ndisinclination to the state herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! I am not at all ashamed of it. I would have everybody marry if\r\nthey can do it properly: I do not like to have people throw themselves\r\naway; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to\r\nadvantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young people were pleased with each other from the first. On each\r\nside there was much to attract, and their acquaintance soon promised as\r\nearly an intimacy as good manners would warrant. Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s beauty\r\ndid her no disservice with the Miss Bertrams. They were too handsome\r\nthemselves to dislike any woman for being so too, and were almost as\r\nmuch charmed as their brothers with her lively dark eye, clear brown\r\ncomplexion, and general prettiness. Had she been tall, full formed, and\r\nfair, it might have been more of a trial: but as it was, there could be\r\nno comparison; and she was most allowably a sweet, pretty girl, while\r\nthey were the finest young women in the country.\r\n\r\nHer brother was not handsome: no, when they first saw him he was\r\nabsolutely plain, black and plain; but still he was the gentleman, with\r\na pleasing address. The second meeting proved him not so very plain: he\r\nwas plain, to be sure, but then he had so much countenance, and his\r\nteeth were so good, and he was so well made, that one soon forgot he\r\nwas plain; and after a third interview, after dining in company with\r\nhim at the Parsonage, he was no longer allowed to be called so by\r\nanybody. He was, in fact, the most agreeable young man the sisters had\r\never known, and they were equally delighted with him. Miss Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nengagement made him in equity the property of Julia, of which Julia was\r\nfully aware; and before he had been at Mansfield a week, she was quite\r\nready to be fallen in love with.\r\n\r\nMaria\xe2\x80\x99s notions on the subject were more confused and indistinct. She\r\ndid not want to see or understand. \xe2\x80\x9cThere could be no harm in her\r\nliking an agreeable man\xe2\x80\x94everybody knew her situation\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Crawford must\r\ntake care of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger!\r\nthe Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing, and were ready to be pleased;\r\nand he began with no object but of making them like him. He did not\r\nwant them to die of love; but with sense and temper which ought to have\r\nmade him judge and feel better, he allowed himself great latitude on\r\nsuch points.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he\r\nreturned from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner\r\nvisit; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are very elegant, agreeable girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they are indeed, and I am delighted to hear you say it. But you\r\nlike Julia best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! I like Julia best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you really? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the\r\nhandsomest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I should suppose. She has the advantage in every feature, and I\r\nprefer her countenance; but I like Julia best; Miss Bertram is\r\ncertainly the handsomest, and I have found her the most agreeable, but\r\nI shall always like Julia best, because you order me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not talk to you, Henry, but I know you _will_ like her best at\r\nlast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not I tell you that I like her best _at_ _first_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides, Miss Bertram is engaged. Remember that, my dear brother.\r\nHer choice is made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I like her the better for it. An engaged woman is always more\r\nagreeable than a disengaged. She is satisfied with herself. Her cares\r\nare over, and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing\r\nwithout suspicion. All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and\r\nit is a great match for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him; _that_ is your\r\nopinion of your intimate friend. _I_ do not subscribe to it. I am sure\r\nMiss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth. I could see it in\r\nher eyes, when he was mentioned. I think too well of Miss Bertram to\r\nsuppose she would ever give her hand without her heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary, how shall we manage him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must leave him to himself, I believe. Talking does no good. He will\r\nbe taken in at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I would not have him _taken_ _in_; I would not have him duped; I\r\nwould have it all fair and honourable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear! let him stand his chance and be taken in. It will do just as\r\nwell. Everybody is taken in at some period or other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot always in marriage, dear Mary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn marriage especially. With all due respect to such of the present\r\ncompany as chance to be married, my dear Mrs. Grant, there is not one\r\nin a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry. Look\r\nwhere I will, I see that it _is_ so; and I feel that it _must_ be so,\r\nwhen I consider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which\r\npeople expect most from others, and are least honest themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You have been in a bad school for matrimony, in Hill Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state; but,\r\nhowever, speaking from my own observation, it is a manoeuvring\r\nbusiness. I know so many who have married in the full expectation and\r\nconfidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion, or\r\naccomplishment, or good quality in the person, who have found\r\nthemselves entirely deceived, and been obliged to put up with exactly\r\nthe reverse. What is this but a take in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, there must be a little imagination here. I beg your\r\npardon, but I cannot quite believe you. Depend upon it, you see but\r\nhalf. You see the evil, but you do not see the consolation. There will\r\nbe little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to\r\nexpect too much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human\r\nnature turns to another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make a\r\nsecond better: we find comfort somewhere\xe2\x80\x94and those evil-minded\r\nobservers, dearest Mary, who make much of a little, are more taken in\r\nand deceived than the parties themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, sister! I honour your _esprit_ _du_ _corps_. When I am a\r\nwife, I mean to be just as staunch myself; and I wish my friends in\r\ngeneral would be so too. It would save me many a heartache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are as bad as your brother, Mary; but we will cure you both.\r\nMansfield shall cure you both, and without any taking in. Stay with us,\r\nand we will cure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Crawfords, without wanting to be cured, were very willing to stay.\r\nMary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home, and Henry\r\nequally ready to lengthen his visit. He had come, intending to spend\r\nonly a few days with them; but Mansfield promised well, and there was\r\nnothing to call him elsewhere. It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them\r\nboth with her, and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it\r\nso: a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant\r\nsociety to an indolent, stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s being his\r\nguest was an excuse for drinking claret every day.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Bertrams\xe2\x80\x99 admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than\r\nanything which Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s habits made her likely to feel. She\r\nacknowledged, however, that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men,\r\nthat two such young men were not often seen together even in London,\r\nand that their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very\r\ngood. _He_ had been much in London, and had more liveliness and\r\ngallantry than Edmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed,\r\nhis being the eldest was another strong claim. She had felt an early\r\npresentiment that she _should_ like the eldest best. She knew it was\r\nher way.\r\n\r\nTom Bertram must have been thought pleasant, indeed, at any rate; he\r\nwas the sort of young man to be generally liked, his agreeableness was\r\nof the kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a\r\nhigher stamp, for he had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large\r\nacquaintance, and a great deal to say; and the reversion of Mansfield\r\nPark, and a baronetcy, did no harm to all this. Miss Crawford soon felt\r\nthat he and his situation might do. She looked about her with due\r\nconsideration, and found almost everything in his favour: a park, a\r\nreal park, five miles round, a spacious modern-built house, so well\r\nplaced and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of\r\nengravings of gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s seats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be\r\ncompletely new furnished\xe2\x80\x94pleasant sisters, a quiet mother, and an\r\nagreeable man himself\xe2\x80\x94with the advantage of being tied up from much\r\ngaming at present by a promise to his father, and of being Sir Thomas\r\nhereafter. It might do very well; she believed she should accept him;\r\nand she began accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse\r\nwhich he had to run at the B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 races.\r\n\r\nThese races were to call him away not long after their acquaintance\r\nbegan; and as it appeared that the family did not, from his usual\r\ngoings on, expect him back again for many weeks, it would bring his\r\npassion to an early proof. Much was said on his side to induce her to\r\nattend the races, and schemes were made for a large party to them, with\r\nall the eagerness of inclination, but it would only do to be talked of.\r\n\r\nAnd Fanny, what was _she_ doing and thinking all this while? and what\r\nwas _her_ opinion of the newcomers? Few young ladies of eighteen could\r\nbe less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny. In a quiet way,\r\nvery little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss\r\nCrawford\xe2\x80\x99s beauty; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford\r\nvery plain, in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the\r\ncontrary, she never mentioned _him_. The notice, which she excited\r\nherself, was to this effect. \xe2\x80\x9cI begin now to understand you all, except\r\nMiss Price,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, as she was walking with the Mr.\r\nBertrams. \xe2\x80\x9cPray, is she out, or is she not? I am puzzled. She dined at\r\nthe Parsonage, with the rest of you, which seemed like being _out_; and\r\nyet she says so little, that I can hardly suppose she _is_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund, to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I know\r\nwhat you mean, but I will not undertake to answer the question. My\r\ncousin is grown up. She has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs\r\nand not outs are beyond me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained. The\r\ndistinction is so broad. Manners as well as appearance are, generally\r\nspeaking, so totally different. Till now, I could not have supposed it\r\npossible to be mistaken as to a girl\xe2\x80\x99s being out or not. A girl not out\r\nhas always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks\r\nvery demure, and never says a word. You may smile, but it is so, I\r\nassure you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far,\r\nit is all very proper. Girls should be quiet and modest. The most\r\nobjectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on being\r\nintroduced into company is frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass\r\nin such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nconfidence! _That_ is the faulty part of the present system. One does\r\nnot like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to\r\nevery thing\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the\r\nyear before. Mr. Bertram, I dare say _you_ have sometimes met with such\r\nchanges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I have, but this is hardly fair; I see what you are at. You\r\nare quizzing me and Miss Anderson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed. Miss Anderson! I do not know who or what you mean. I am\r\nquite in the dark. But I _will_ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure,\r\nif you will tell me what about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you carry it off very well, but I cannot be quite so far imposed\r\non. You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye, in describing an\r\naltered young lady. You paint too accurately for mistake. It was\r\nexactly so. The Andersons of Baker Street. We were speaking of them the\r\nother day, you know. Edmund, you have heard me mention Charles\r\nAnderson. The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented\r\nit. When Anderson first introduced me to his family, about two years\r\nago, his sister was not _out_, and I could not get her to speak to me.\r\nI sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson, with only her and\r\na little girl or two in the room, the governess being sick or run away,\r\nand the mother in and out every moment with letters of business, and I\r\ncould hardly get a word or a look from the young lady\xe2\x80\x94nothing like a\r\ncivil answer\xe2\x80\x94she screwed up her mouth, and turned from me with such an\r\nair! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth. She was then _out_. I\r\nmet her at Mrs. Holford\xe2\x80\x99s, and did not recollect her. She came up to\r\nme, claimed me as an acquaintance, stared me out of countenance; and\r\ntalked and laughed till I did not know which way to look. I felt that I\r\nmust be the jest of the room at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is\r\nplain, has heard the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a very pretty story it is, and with more truth in it, I dare say,\r\nthan does credit to Miss Anderson. It is too common a fault. Mothers\r\ncertainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their\r\ndaughters. I do not know where the error lies. I do not pretend to set\r\npeople right, but I do see that they are often wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who are showing the world what female manners _should_ be,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Bertram gallantly, \xe2\x80\x9care doing a great deal to set them right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe error is plain enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said the less courteous Edmund; \xe2\x80\x9csuch\r\ngirls are ill brought up. They are given wrong notions from the\r\nbeginning. They are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is\r\nno more real modesty in their behaviour _before_ they appear in public\r\nthan afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I cannot\r\nagree with you there. It is certainly the modestest part of the\r\nbusiness. It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the\r\nsame airs and take the same liberties as if they were, which I have\r\nseen done. That is worse than anything\xe2\x80\x94quite disgusting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, _that_ is very inconvenient indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bertram. \xe2\x80\x9cIt leads\r\none astray; one does not know what to do. The close bonnet and demure\r\nair you describe so well (and nothing was ever juster), tell one what\r\nis expected; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want\r\nof them. I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last\r\nSeptember, just after my return from the West Indies. My friend\r\nSneyd\xe2\x80\x94you have heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund\xe2\x80\x94his father, and mother,\r\nand sisters, were there, all new to me. When we reached Albion Place\r\nthey were out; we went after them, and found them on the pier: Mrs. and\r\nthe two Miss Sneyds, with others of their acquaintance. I made my bow\r\nin form; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men, attached myself to\r\none of her daughters, walked by her side all the way home, and made\r\nmyself as agreeable as I could; the young lady perfectly easy in her\r\nmanners, and as ready to talk as to listen. I had not a suspicion that\r\nI could be doing anything wrong. They looked just the same: both\r\nwell-dressed, with veils and parasols like other girls; but I\r\nafterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the\r\nyoungest, who was not _out_, and had most excessively offended the\r\neldest. Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six\r\nmonths; and Miss Sneyd, I believe, has never forgiven me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was bad indeed. Poor Miss Sneyd. Though I have no younger sister,\r\nI feel for her. To be neglected before one\xe2\x80\x99s time must be very\r\nvexatious; but it was entirely the mother\xe2\x80\x99s fault. Miss Augusta should\r\nhave been with her governess. Such half-and-half doings never prosper.\r\nBut now I must be satisfied about Miss Price. Does she go to balls?\r\nDoes she dine out every where, as well as at my sister\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Edmund; \xe2\x80\x9cI do not think she has ever been to a ball. My\r\nmother seldom goes into company herself, and dines nowhere but with\r\nMrs. Grant, and Fanny stays at home with _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! then the point is clear. Miss Price is not out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bertram set off for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, and Miss Crawford was prepared to find a\r\ngreat chasm in their society, and to miss him decidedly in the meetings\r\nwhich were now becoming almost daily between the families; and on their\r\nall dining together at the Park soon after his going, she retook her\r\nchosen place near the bottom of the table, fully expecting to feel a\r\nmost melancholy difference in the change of masters. It would be a very\r\nflat business, she was sure. In comparison with his brother, Edmund\r\nwould have nothing to say. The soup would be sent round in a most\r\nspiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling,\r\nand the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any\r\nformer haunch, or a single entertaining story, about \xe2\x80\x9cmy friend such a\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper\r\nend of the table, and in observing Mr. Rushworth, who was now making\r\nhis appearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords\xe2\x80\x99\r\narrival. He had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county, and\r\nthat friend having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver,\r\nMr. Rushworth was returned with his head full of the subject, and very\r\neager to be improving his own place in the same way; and though not\r\nsaying much to the purpose, could talk of nothing else. The subject had\r\nbeen already handled in the drawing-room; it was revived in the\r\ndining-parlour. Miss Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s attention and opinion was evidently his\r\nchief aim; and though her deportment showed rather conscious\r\nsuperiority than any solicitude to oblige him, the mention of Sotherton\r\nCourt, and the ideas attached to it, gave her a feeling of complacency,\r\nwhich prevented her from being very ungracious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you could see Compton,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cit is the most complete\r\nthing! I never saw a place so altered in my life. I told Smith I did\r\nnot know where I was. The approach _now_, is one of the finest things\r\nin the country: you see the house in the most surprising manner. I\r\ndeclare, when I got back to Sotherton yesterday, it looked like a\r\nprison\xe2\x80\x94quite a dismal old prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for shame!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Norris. \xe2\x80\x9cA prison indeed? Sotherton Court\r\nis the noblest old place in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wants improvement, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, beyond anything. I never saw a place that\r\nwanted so much improvement in my life; and it is so forlorn that I do\r\nnot know what can be done with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nGrant to Mrs. Norris, with a smile; \xe2\x80\x9cbut depend upon it, Sotherton will\r\nhave _every_ improvement in time which his heart can desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must try to do something with it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Rushworth, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not\r\nknow what. I hope I shall have some good friend to help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour best friend upon such an occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Bertram calmly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwould be Mr. Repton, I imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I was thinking of. As he has done so well by Smith, I\r\nthink I had better have him at once. His terms are five guineas a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and if they were _ten_,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure _you_\r\nneed not regard it. The expense need not be any impediment. If I were\r\nyou, I should not think of the expense. I would have everything done in\r\nthe best style, and made as nice as possible. Such a place as Sotherton\r\nCourt deserves everything that taste and money can do. You have space\r\nto work upon there, and grounds that will well reward you. For my own\r\npart, if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of\r\nSotherton, I should be always planting and improving, for naturally I\r\nam excessively fond of it. It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt\r\nanything where I am now, with my little half acre. It would be quite a\r\nburlesque. But if I had more room, I should take a prodigious delight\r\nin improving and planting. We did a vast deal in that way at the\r\nParsonage: we made it quite a different place from what it was when we\r\nfirst had it. You young ones do not remember much about it, perhaps;\r\nbut if dear Sir Thomas were here, he could tell you what improvements\r\nwe made: and a great deal more would have been done, but for poor Mr.\r\nNorris\xe2\x80\x99s sad state of health. He could hardly ever get out, poor man,\r\nto enjoy anything, and _that_ disheartened me from doing several things\r\nthat Sir Thomas and I used to talk of. If it had not been for _that_,\r\nwe should have carried on the garden wall, and made the plantation to\r\nshut out the churchyard, just as Dr. Grant has done. We were always\r\ndoing something as it was. It was only the spring twelvemonth before\r\nMr. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall,\r\nwhich is now grown such a noble tree, and getting to such perfection,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x9d addressing herself then to Dr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tree thrives well, beyond a doubt, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dr. Grant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nsoil is good; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit\r\nshould be so little worth the trouble of gathering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, it is a Moor Park, we bought it as a Moor Park, and it cost\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94that is, it was a present from Sir Thomas, but I saw the bill\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nknow it cost seven shillings, and was charged as a Moor Park.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were imposed on, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dr. Grant: \xe2\x80\x9cthese potatoes have\r\nas much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree.\r\nIt is an insipid fruit at the best; but a good apricot is eatable,\r\nwhich none from my garden are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Grant, pretending to whisper across\r\nthe table to Mrs. Norris, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural\r\ntaste of our apricot is: he is scarcely ever indulged with one, for it\r\nis so valuable a fruit; with a little assistance, and ours is such a\r\nremarkably large, fair sort, that what with early tarts and preserves,\r\nmy cook contrives to get them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris, who had begun to redden, was appeased; and, for a little\r\nwhile, other subjects took place of the improvements of Sotherton. Dr.\r\nGrant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends; their acquaintance had\r\nbegun in dilapidations, and their habits were totally dissimilar.\r\n\r\nAfter a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again. \xe2\x80\x9cSmith\xe2\x80\x99s place is\r\nthe admiration of all the country; and it was a mere nothing before\r\nRepton took it in hand. I think I shall have Repton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Rushworth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram, \xe2\x80\x9cif I were you, I would have a very\r\npretty shrubbery. One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine\r\nweather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence, and\r\ntried to make out something complimentary; but, between his submission\r\nto _her_ taste, and his having always intended the same himself, with\r\nthe superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies\r\nin general, and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was\r\nanxious to please, he grew puzzled, and Edmund was glad to put an end\r\nto his speech by a proposal of wine. Mr. Rushworth, however, though not\r\nusually a great talker, had still more to say on the subject next his\r\nheart. \xe2\x80\x9cSmith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his\r\ngrounds, which is little enough, and makes it more surprising that the\r\nplace can have been so improved. Now, at Sotherton we have a good seven\r\nhundred, without reckoning the water meadows; so that I think, if so\r\nmuch could be done at Compton, we need not despair. There have been two\r\nor three fine old trees cut down, that grew too near the house, and it\r\nopens the prospect amazingly, which makes me think that Repton, or\r\nanybody of that sort, would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton\r\ndown: the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill,\r\nyou know,\xe2\x80\x9d turning to Miss Bertram particularly as he spoke. But Miss\r\nBertram thought it most becoming to reply\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe avenue! Oh! I do not recollect it. I really know very little of\r\nSotherton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny, who was sitting on the other side of Edmund, exactly opposite\r\nMiss Crawford, and who had been attentively listening, now looked at\r\nhim, and said in a low voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut down an avenue! What a pity! Does it not make you think of Cowper?\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ye fallen avenues, once more I mourn your fate unmerited.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled as he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance,\r\nFanny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down, to see the place\r\nas it is now, in its old state; but I do not suppose I shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never been there? No, you never can; and, unluckily, it is\r\nout of distance for a ride. I wish we could contrive it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it does not signify. Whenever I do see it, you will tell me how it\r\nhas been altered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI collect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Sotherton is an old place, and a\r\nplace of some grandeur. In any particular style of building?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house was built in Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s time, and is a large, regular,\r\nbrick building; heavy, but respectable looking, and has many good\r\nrooms. It is ill placed. It stands in one of the lowest spots of the\r\npark; in that respect, unfavourable for improvement. But the woods are\r\nfine, and there is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made a good\r\ndeal of. Mr. Rushworth is quite right, I think, in meaning to give it a\r\nmodern dress, and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford listened with submission, and said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a\r\nwell-bred man; he makes the best of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, had I a\r\nplace to new fashion, I should not put myself into the hands of an\r\nimprover. I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty, of my own\r\nchoice, and acquired progressively. I would rather abide by my own\r\nblunders than by his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ would know what you were about, of course; but that would not\r\nsuit _me_. I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters, but as they are\r\nbefore me; and had I a place of my own in the country, I should be most\r\nthankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it, and give me as much\r\nbeauty as he could for my money; and I should never look at it till it\r\nwas complete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be delightful to _me_ to see the progress of it all,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFanny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, you have been brought up to it. It was no part of my education;\r\nand the only dose I ever had, being administered by not the first\r\nfavourite in the world, has made me consider improvements _in_ _hand_\r\nas the greatest of nuisances. Three years ago the Admiral, my honoured\r\nuncle, bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers\r\nin; and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures; but it being\r\nexcessively pretty, it was soon found necessary to be improved, and for\r\nthree months we were all dirt and confusion, without a gravel walk to\r\nstep on, or a bench fit for use. I would have everything as complete as\r\npossible in the country, shrubberies and flower-gardens, and rustic\r\nseats innumerable: but it must all be done without my care. Henry is\r\ndifferent; he loves to be doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford, whom he was much disposed to\r\nadmire, speak so freely of her uncle. It did not suit his sense of\r\npropriety, and he was silenced, till induced by further smiles and\r\nliveliness to put the matter by for the present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bertram,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI have tidings of my harp at last. I am\r\nassured that it is safe at Northampton; and there it has probably been\r\nthese ten days, in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often\r\nreceived to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d Edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, that our inquiries were too direct; we sent a servant,\r\nwe went ourselves: this will not do seventy miles from London; but this\r\nmorning we heard of it in the right way. It was seen by some farmer,\r\nand he told the miller, and the miller told the butcher, and the\r\nbutcher\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law left word at the shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever means, and hope\r\nthere will be no further delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to have it to-morrow; but how do you think it is to be conveyed?\r\nNot by a wagon or cart: oh no! nothing of that kind could be hired in\r\nthe village. I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would find it difficult, I dare say, just now, in the middle of a\r\nvery late hay harvest, to hire a horse and cart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it! To want\r\na horse and cart in the country seemed impossible, so I told my maid to\r\nspeak for one directly; and as I cannot look out of my dressing-closet\r\nwithout seeing one farmyard, nor walk in the shrubbery without passing\r\nanother, I thought it would be only ask and have, and was rather\r\ngrieved that I could not give the advantage to all. Guess my surprise,\r\nwhen I found that I had been asking the most unreasonable, most\r\nimpossible thing in the world; had offended all the farmers, all the\r\nlabourers, all the hay in the parish! As for Dr. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s bailiff, I\r\nbelieve I had better keep out of _his_ way; and my brother-in-law\r\nhimself, who is all kindness in general, looked rather black upon me\r\nwhen he found what I had been at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could not be expected to have thought on the subject before; but\r\nwhen you _do_ think of it, you must see the importance of getting in\r\nthe grass. The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you\r\nsuppose: our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out; but, in\r\nharvest, it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall understand all your ways in time; but, coming down with the\r\ntrue London maxim, that everything is to be got with money, I was a\r\nlittle embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country\r\ncustoms. However, I am to have my harp fetched to-morrow. Henry, who is\r\ngood-nature itself, has offered to fetch it in his barouche. Will it\r\nnot be honourably conveyed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument, and hoped to be\r\nsoon allowed to hear her. Fanny had never heard the harp at all, and\r\nwished for it very much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be most happy to play to you both,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford; \xe2\x80\x9cat\r\nleast as long as you can like to listen: probably much longer, for I\r\ndearly love music myself, and where the natural taste is equal the\r\nplayer must always be best off, for she is gratified in more ways than\r\none. Now, Mr. Bertram, if you write to your brother, I entreat you to\r\ntell him that my harp is come: he heard so much of my misery about it.\r\nAnd you may say, if you please, that I shall prepare my most plaintive\r\nairs against his return, in compassion to his feelings, as I know his\r\nhorse will lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do not, at present,\r\nforesee any occasion for writing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth, would you\r\never write to him, nor he to you, if it could be helped. The occasion\r\nwould never be foreseen. What strange creatures brothers are! You would\r\nnot write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the\r\nworld; and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is\r\nill, or such a relation dead, it is done in the fewest possible words.\r\nYou have but one style among you. I know it perfectly. Henry, who is in\r\nevery other respect exactly what a brother should be, who loves me,\r\nconsults me, confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together,\r\nhas never yet turned the page in a letter; and very often it is nothing\r\nmore than\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Dear Mary, I am just arrived. Bath seems full, and\r\neverything as usual. Yours sincerely.\xe2\x80\x99 That is the true manly style;\r\nthat is a complete brother\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they are at a distance from all their family,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny,\r\ncolouring for William\xe2\x80\x99s sake, \xe2\x80\x9cthey can write long letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Price has a brother at sea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cwhose excellence as a\r\ncorrespondent makes her think you too severe upon us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt sea, has she? In the king\xe2\x80\x99s service, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story, but his determined\r\nsilence obliged her to relate her brother\xe2\x80\x99s situation: her voice was\r\nanimated in speaking of his profession, and the foreign stations he had\r\nbeen on; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been\r\nabsent without tears in her eyes. Miss Crawford civilly wished him an\r\nearly promotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know anything of my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s captain?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund; \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain\r\nMarshall? You have a large acquaintance in the navy, I conclude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmong admirals, large enough; but,\xe2\x80\x9d with an air of grandeur, \xe2\x80\x9cwe know\r\nvery little of the inferior ranks. Post-captains may be very good sort\r\nof men, but they do not belong to _us_. Of various admirals I could\r\ntell you a great deal: of them and their flags, and the gradation of\r\ntheir pay, and their bickerings and jealousies. But, in general, I can\r\nassure you that they are all passed over, and all very ill used.\r\nCertainly, my home at my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s brought me acquainted with a circle of\r\nadmirals. Of _Rears_ and _Vices_ I saw enough. Now do not be suspecting\r\nme of a pun, I entreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund again felt grave, and only replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a noble profession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the profession is well enough under two circumstances: if it make\r\nthe fortune, and there be discretion in spending it; but, in short, it\r\nis not a favourite profession of mine. It has never worn an amiable\r\nform to _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund reverted to the harp, and was again very happy in the prospect\r\nof hearing her play.\r\n\r\nThe subject of improving grounds, meanwhile, was still under\r\nconsideration among the others; and Mrs. Grant could not help\r\naddressing her brother, though it was calling his attention from Miss\r\nJulia Bertram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Henry, have _you_ nothing to say? You have been an improver\r\nyourself, and from what I hear of Everingham, it may vie with any place\r\nin England. Its natural beauties, I am sure, are great. Everingham, as\r\nit _used_ to be, was perfect in my estimation: such a happy fall of\r\nground, and such timber! What would I not give to see it again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas his answer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I fear there would be some disappointment: you\r\nwould not find it equal to your present ideas. In extent, it is a mere\r\nnothing; you would be surprised at its insignificance; and, as for\r\nimprovement, there was very little for me to do\xe2\x80\x94too little: I should\r\nlike to have been busy much longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are fond of the sort of thing?\xe2\x80\x9d said Julia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcessively; but what with the natural advantages of the ground, which\r\npointed out, even to a very young eye, what little remained to be done,\r\nand my own consequent resolutions, I had not been of age three months\r\nbefore Everingham was all that it is now. My plan was laid at\r\nWestminster, a little altered, perhaps, at Cambridge, and at\r\none-and-twenty executed. I am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for having\r\nso much happiness yet before him. I have been a devourer of my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who see quickly, will resolve quickly, and act quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJulia. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ can never want employment. Instead of envying Mr.\r\nRushworth, you should assist him with your opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Grant, hearing the latter part of this speech, enforced it warmly,\r\npersuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother\xe2\x80\x99s; and as Miss\r\nBertram caught at the idea likewise, and gave it her full support,\r\ndeclaring that, in her opinion, it was infinitely better to consult\r\nwith friends and disinterested advisers, than immediately to throw the\r\nbusiness into the hands of a professional man, Mr. Rushworth was very\r\nready to request the favour of Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s assistance; and Mr.\r\nCrawford, after properly depreciating his own abilities, was quite at\r\nhis service in any way that could be useful. Mr. Rushworth then began\r\nto propose Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s doing him the honour of coming over to\r\nSotherton, and taking a bed there; when Mrs. Norris, as if reading in\r\nher two nieces\xe2\x80\x99 minds their little approbation of a plan which was to\r\ntake Mr. Crawford away, interposed with an amendment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s willingness; but why should\r\nnot more of us go? Why should not we make a little party? Here are many\r\nthat would be interested in your improvements, my dear Mr. Rushworth,\r\nand that would like to hear Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on the spot, and\r\nthat might be of some small use to you with _their_ opinions; and, for\r\nmy own part, I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother\r\nagain; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so\r\nremiss; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth,\r\nwhile the rest of you walked about and settled things, and then we\r\ncould all return to a late dinner here, or dine at Sotherton, just as\r\nmight be most agreeable to your mother, and have a pleasant drive home\r\nby moonlight. I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me\r\nin his barouche, and Edmund can go on horseback, you know, sister, and\r\nFanny will stay at home with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Bertram made no objection; and every one concerned in the going\r\nwas forward in expressing their ready concurrence, excepting Edmund,\r\nwho heard it all and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford _now_?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund the\r\nnext day, after thinking some time on the subject himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you\r\nlike her yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94very much. I like to hear her talk. She entertains me; and\r\nshe is so extremely pretty, that I have great pleasure in looking at\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is her countenance that is so attractive. She has a wonderful play\r\nof feature! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you,\r\nFanny, as not quite right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did. I was\r\nquite astonished. An uncle with whom she has been living so many years,\r\nand who, whatever his faults may be, is so very fond of her brother,\r\ntreating him, they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you would be struck. It was very wrong; very indecorous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd very ungrateful, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUngrateful is a strong word. I do not know that her uncle has any\r\nclaim to her _gratitude_; his wife certainly had; and it is the warmth\r\nof her respect for her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s memory which misleads her here. She is\r\nawkwardly circumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively spirits it\r\nmust be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford,\r\nwithout throwing a shade on the Admiral. I do not pretend to know which\r\nwas most to blame in their disagreements, though the Admiral\xe2\x80\x99s present\r\nconduct might incline one to the side of his wife; but it is natural\r\nand amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely. I do\r\nnot censure her _opinions_; but there certainly _is_ impropriety in\r\nmaking them public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not you think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, after a little consideration, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthis impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her\r\nniece has been entirely brought up by her? She cannot have given her\r\nright notions of what was due to the Admiral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a fair remark. Yes, we must suppose the faults of the niece to\r\nhave been those of the aunt; and it makes one more sensible of the\r\ndisadvantages she has been under. But I think her present home must do\r\nher good. Mrs. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s manners are just what they ought to be. She\r\nspeaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, except as to his writing her such short letters. She made me\r\nalmost laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly the love or good-nature\r\nof a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything\r\nworth reading to his sisters, when they are separated. I am sure\r\nWilliam would never have used _me_ so, under any circumstances. And\r\nwhat right had she to suppose that _you_ would not write long letters\r\nwhen you were absent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever may contribute to\r\nits own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, when\r\nuntinctured by ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of\r\neither in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, or\r\nloud, or coarse. She is perfectly feminine, except in the instances we\r\nhave been speaking of. There she cannot be justified. I am glad you saw\r\nit all as I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a good chance\r\nof her thinking like him; though at this period, and on this subject,\r\nthere began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he was in a\r\nline of admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fanny\r\ncould not follow. Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s attractions did not lessen. The harp\r\narrived, and rather added to her beauty, wit, and good-humour; for she\r\nplayed with the greatest obligingness, with an expression and taste\r\nwhich were peculiarly becoming, and there was something clever to be\r\nsaid at the close of every air. Edmund was at the Parsonage every day,\r\nto be indulged with his favourite instrument: one morning secured an\r\ninvitation for the next; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a\r\nlistener, and every thing was soon in a fair train.\r\n\r\nA young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, and\r\nboth placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and opening on a\r\nlittle lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was\r\nenough to catch any man\xe2\x80\x99s heart. The season, the scene, the air, were\r\nall favourable to tenderness and sentiment. Mrs. Grant and her tambour\r\nframe were not without their use: it was all in harmony; and as\r\neverything will turn to account when love is once set going, even the\r\nsandwich tray, and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth\r\nlooking at. Without studying the business, however, or knowing what he\r\nwas about, Edmund was beginning, at the end of a week of such\r\nintercourse, to be a good deal in love; and to the credit of the lady\r\nit may be added that, without his being a man of the world or an elder\r\nbrother, without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small\r\ntalk, he began to be agreeable to her. She felt it to be so, though she\r\nhad not foreseen, and could hardly understand it; for he was not\r\npleasant by any common rule: he talked no nonsense; he paid no\r\ncompliments; his opinions were unbending, his attentions tranquil and\r\nsimple. There was a charm, perhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness,\r\nhis integrity, which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel, though not\r\nequal to discuss with herself. She did not think very much about it,\r\nhowever: he pleased her for the present; she liked to have him near\r\nher; it was enough.\r\n\r\nFanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning;\r\nshe would gladly have been there too, might she have gone in uninvited\r\nand unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she wonder that, when\r\nthe evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he\r\nshould think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their\r\nhome, while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park; but she\r\nthought it a very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the\r\nwine and water for her, would rather go without it than not. She was a\r\nlittle surprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford,\r\nand not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed,\r\nand of which _she_ was almost always reminded by a something of the\r\nsame nature whenever she was in her company; but so it was. Edmund was\r\nfond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford, but he seemed to think it\r\nenough that the Admiral had since been spared; and she scrupled to\r\npoint out her own remarks to him, lest it should appear like\r\nill-nature. The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her\r\nwas the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride, which the\r\nformer caught, soon after her being settled at Mansfield, from the\r\nexample of the young ladies at the Park, and which, when Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacquaintance with her increased, led to his encouraging the wish, and\r\nthe offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts,\r\nas the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish. No\r\npain, no injury, however, was designed by him to his cousin in this\r\noffer: _she_ was not to lose a day\xe2\x80\x99s exercise by it. The mare was only\r\nto be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to\r\nbegin; and Fanny, on its being first proposed, so far from feeling\r\nslighted, was almost over-powered with gratitude that he should be\r\nasking her leave for it.\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself, and no\r\ninconvenience to Fanny. Edmund, who had taken down the mare and\r\npresided at the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before\r\neither Fanny or the steady old coachman, who always attended her when\r\nshe rode without her cousins, were ready to set forward. The second\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s trial was not so guiltless. Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment of riding\r\nwas such that she did not know how to leave off. Active and fearless,\r\nand though rather small, strongly made, she seemed formed for a\r\nhorsewoman; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise, something\r\nwas probably added in Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s attendance and instructions, and\r\nsomething more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in\r\ngeneral by her early progress, to make her unwilling to dismount. Fanny\r\nwas ready and waiting, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for\r\nnot being gone, and still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared.\r\nTo avoid her aunt, and look for him, she went out.\r\n\r\nThe houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight of\r\neach other; but, by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she could\r\nlook down the park, and command a view of the Parsonage and all its\r\ndemesnes, gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmeadow she immediately saw the group\xe2\x80\x94Edmund and Miss Crawford both on\r\nhorse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford,\r\nwith two or three grooms, standing about and looking on. A happy party\r\nit appeared to her, all interested in one object: cheerful beyond a\r\ndoubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her. It was a sound\r\nwhich did not make _her_ cheerful; she wondered that Edmund should\r\nforget her, and felt a pang. She could not turn her eyes from the\r\nmeadow; she could not help watching all that passed. At first Miss\r\nCrawford and her companion made the circuit of the field, which was not\r\nsmall, at a foot\xe2\x80\x99s pace; then, at _her_ apparent suggestion, they rose\r\ninto a canter; and to Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s timid nature it was most astonishing to\r\nsee how well she sat. After a few minutes they stopped entirely. Edmund\r\nwas close to her; he was speaking to her; he was evidently directing\r\nher management of the bridle; he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or\r\nthe imagination supplied what the eye could not reach. She must not\r\nwonder at all this; what could be more natural than that Edmund should\r\nbe making himself useful, and proving his good-nature by any one? She\r\ncould not but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved\r\nhim the trouble; that it would have been particularly proper and\r\nbecoming in a brother to have done it himself; but Mr. Crawford, with\r\nall his boasted good-nature, and all his coachmanship, probably knew\r\nnothing of the matter, and had no active kindness in comparison of\r\nEdmund. She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such\r\ndouble duty; if she were forgotten, the poor mare should be remembered.\r\n\r\nHer feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by\r\nseeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss Crawford still on\r\nhorseback, but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into the\r\nlane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she stood.\r\nShe began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient; and walked\r\nto meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Price,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, as soon as she was at all\r\nwithin hearing, \xe2\x80\x9cI am come to make my own apologies for keeping you\r\nwaiting; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself\xe2\x80\x94I knew it\r\nwas very late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, if\r\nyou please, you must forgive me. Selfishness must always be forgiven,\r\nyou know, because there is no hope of a cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added his conviction\r\nthat she could be in no hurry. \xe2\x80\x9cFor there is more than time enough for\r\nmy cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nhave been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half\r\nan hour sooner: clouds are now coming up, and she will not suffer from\r\nthe heat as she would have done then. I wish _you_ may not be fatigued\r\nby so much exercise. I wish you had saved yourself this walk home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she, as she sprang down with his help; \xe2\x80\x9cI am very strong. Nothing\r\never fatigues me but doing what I do not like. Miss Price, I give way\r\nto you with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have a\r\npleasant ride, and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this\r\ndear, delightful, beautiful animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old coachman, who had been waiting about with his own horse, now\r\njoining them, Fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across another\r\npart of the park; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing,\r\nas she looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together\r\nto the village; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments\r\non Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s great cleverness as a horse-woman, which he had been\r\nwatching with an interest almost equal to her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he. \xe2\x80\x9cI never see one sit a horse better. She did not seem to have\r\na thought of fear. Very different from you, miss, when you first began,\r\nsix years ago come next Easter. Lord bless you! how you did tremble\r\nwhen Sir Thomas first had you put on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated. Her merit in\r\nbeing gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated\r\nby the Miss Bertrams; her delight in riding was like their own; her\r\nearly excellence in it was like their own, and they had great pleasure\r\nin praising it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sure she would ride well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julia; \xe2\x80\x9cshe has the make for it.\r\nHer figure is as neat as her brother\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d added Maria, \xe2\x80\x9cand her spirits are as good, and she has the same\r\nenergy of character. I cannot but think that good horsemanship has a\r\ngreat deal to do with the mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not know\xe2\x80\x94not if you want the mare,\xe2\x80\x9d was her answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not want her at all for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut whenever you are\r\nnext inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad to\r\nhave her a longer time\xe2\x80\x94for a whole morning, in short. She has a great\r\ndesire to get as far as Mansfield Common: Mrs. Grant has been telling\r\nher of its fine views, and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal\r\nto it. But any morning will do for this. She would be extremely sorry\r\nto interfere with you. It would be very wrong if she did. _She_ rides\r\nonly for pleasure; _you_ for health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not ride to-morrow, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been out\r\nvery often lately, and would rather stay at home. You know I am strong\r\nenough now to walk very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s comfort, and the ride to\r\nMansfield Common took place the next morning: the party included all\r\nthe young people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and\r\ndoubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion. A successful scheme of\r\nthis sort generally brings on another; and the having been to Mansfield\r\nCommon disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after. There\r\nwere many other views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot,\r\nthere were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go. A young party is\r\nalways provided with a shady lane. Four fine mornings successively were\r\nspent in this manner, in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing\r\nthe honours of its finest spots. Everything answered; it was all gaiety\r\nand good-humour, the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be\r\ntalked of with pleasure\xe2\x80\x94till the fourth day, when the happiness of one\r\nof the party was exceedingly clouded. Miss Bertram was the one. Edmund\r\nand Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage, and _she_ was\r\nexcluded. It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant, with perfect\r\ngood-humour, on Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s account, who was partly expected at the\r\nPark that day; but it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her good\r\nmanners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she\r\nreached home. As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was\r\nincreased, and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over\r\nhim; she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and\r\nthrow as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert.\r\n\r\nBetween ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,\r\nfresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of\r\nwhat they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would\r\nscarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was\r\nhalf-asleep; and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nill-humour, and having asked one or two questions about the dinner,\r\nwhich were not immediately attended to, seemed almost determined to say\r\nno more. For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in\r\ntheir praise of the night and their remarks on the stars, to think\r\nbeyond themselves; but when the first pause came, Edmund, looking\r\naround, said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut where is Fanny? Is she gone to bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not that I know of,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Norris; \xe2\x80\x9cshe was here a moment\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room, which was\r\na very long one, told them that she was on the sofa. Mrs. Norris began\r\nscolding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all the evening\r\nupon a sofa. Why cannot you come and sit here, and employ yourself as\r\n_we_ do? If you have no work of your own, I can supply you from the\r\npoor basket. There is all the new calico, that was bought last week,\r\nnot touched yet. I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out.\r\nYou should learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it\r\nis a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a\r\nsofa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore half this was said, Fanny was returned to her seat at the table,\r\nand had taken up her work again; and Julia, who was in high\r\ngood-humour, from the pleasures of the day, did her the justice of\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cI must say, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa\r\nas anybody in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, after looking at her attentively, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you\r\nhave the headache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can hardly believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI know your looks too well.\r\nHow long have you had it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince a little before dinner. It is nothing but the heat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you go out in the heat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo out! to be sure she did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Norris: \xe2\x80\x9cwould you have her\r\nstay within such a fine day as this? Were not we _all_ out? Even your\r\nmother was out to-day for above an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, Edmund,\xe2\x80\x9d added her ladyship, who had been thoroughly\r\nawakened by Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s sharp reprimand to Fanny; \xe2\x80\x9cI was out above an\r\nhour. I sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden, while Fanny\r\ncut the roses; and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot. It\r\nwas shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite dreaded the\r\ncoming home again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny has been cutting roses, has she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year. Poor thing!\r\n_She_ found it hot enough; but they were so full-blown that one could\r\nnot wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no help for it, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs. Norris, in a\r\nrather softened voice; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I question whether her headache might not\r\nbe caught _then_, sister. There is nothing so likely to give it as\r\nstanding and stooping in a hot sun; but I dare say it will be well\r\nto-morrow. Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar; I always\r\nforget to have mine filled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has got it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram; \xe2\x80\x9cshe has had it ever since she\r\ncame back from your house the second time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Edmund; \xe2\x80\x9chas she been walking as well as cutting roses;\r\nwalking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\r\nNo wonder her head aches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was talking to Julia, and did not hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid it would be too much for her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwhen the roses were gathered, your aunt wished to have them, and then\r\nyou know they must be taken home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and,\r\nunluckily, Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the\r\nkey, so she was obliged to go again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund got up and walked about the room, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd could nobody be\r\nemployed on such an errand but Fanny? Upon my word, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, it has been\r\na very ill-managed business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nMrs. Norris, unable to be longer deaf; \xe2\x80\x9cunless I had gone myself,\r\nindeed; but I cannot be in two places at once; and I was talking to Mr.\r\nGreen at that very time about your mother\xe2\x80\x99s dairymaid, by _her_ desire,\r\nand had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son,\r\nand the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour. I think nobody can\r\njustly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really I\r\ncannot do everything at once. And as for Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s just stepping down to\r\nmy house for me\xe2\x80\x94it is not much above a quarter of a mile\xe2\x80\x94I cannot think\r\nI was unreasonable to ask it. How often do I pace it three times a day,\r\nearly and late, ay, and in all weathers too, and say nothing about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish Fanny had half your strength, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Fanny would be more regular in her exercise, she would not be\r\nknocked up so soon. She has not been out on horseback now this long\r\nwhile, and I am persuaded that, when she does not ride, she ought to\r\nwalk. If she had been riding before, I should not have asked it of her.\r\nBut I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among\r\nthe roses; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue\r\nof that kind; and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot.\r\nBetween ourselves, Edmund,\xe2\x80\x9d nodding significantly at his mother, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwas cutting the roses, and dawdling about in the flower-garden, that\r\ndid the mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid it was, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the more candid Lady Bertram, who\r\nhad overheard her; \xe2\x80\x9cI am very much afraid she caught the headache\r\nthere, for the heat was enough to kill anybody. It was as much as I\r\ncould bear myself. Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep him\r\nfrom the flower-beds, was almost too much for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly to another table,\r\non which the supper-tray yet remained, brought a glass of Madeira to\r\nFanny, and obliged her to drink the greater part. She wished to be able\r\nto decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, made\r\nit easier to swallow than to speak.\r\n\r\nVexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt, he was still more angry\r\nwith himself. His own forgetfulness of her was worse than anything\r\nwhich they had done. Nothing of this would have happened had she been\r\nproperly considered; but she had been left four days together without\r\nany choice of companions or exercise, and without any excuse for\r\navoiding whatever her unreasonable aunts might require. He was ashamed\r\nto think that for four days together she had not had the power of\r\nriding, and very seriously resolved, however unwilling he must be to\r\ncheck a pleasure of Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s, that it should never happen again.\r\n\r\nFanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her\r\narrival at the Park. The state of her spirits had probably had its\r\nshare in her indisposition; for she had been feeling neglected, and\r\nbeen struggling against discontent and envy for some days past. As she\r\nleant on the sofa, to which she had retreated that she might not be\r\nseen, the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head; and\r\nthe sudden change which Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s kindness had then occasioned, made her\r\nhardly know how to support herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s rides recommenced the very next day; and as it was a pleasant\r\nfresh-feeling morning, less hot than the weather had lately been,\r\nEdmund trusted that her losses, both of health and pleasure, would be\r\nsoon made good. While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his\r\nmother, who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially, in\r\nurging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton, which had been\r\nstarted a fortnight before, and which, in consequence of her subsequent\r\nabsence from home, had since lain dormant. Mrs. Norris and her nieces\r\nwere all well pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and\r\nagreed to, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies\r\ndid not forget that stipulation, and though Mrs. Norris would willingly\r\nhave answered for his being so, they would neither authorise the\r\nliberty nor run the risk; and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr.\r\nRushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to\r\nwalk down to the Parsonage directly, and call on Mr. Crawford, and\r\ninquire whether Wednesday would suit him or not.\r\n\r\nBefore his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in. Having been out\r\nsome time, and taken a different route to the house, they had not met\r\nhim. Comfortable hopes, however, were given that he would find Mr.\r\nCrawford at home. The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course. It was\r\nhardly possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked of, for\r\nMrs. Norris was in high spirits about it; and Mrs. Rushworth, a\r\nwell-meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of\r\nconsequence, but as it related to her own and her son\xe2\x80\x99s concerns, had\r\nnot yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party. Lady\r\nBertram constantly declined it; but her placid manner of refusal made\r\nMrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come, till Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\nnumerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great deal too much, I\r\nassure you, my dear Mrs. Rushworth. Ten miles there, and ten back, you\r\nknow. You must excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our two\r\ndear girls and myself without her. Sotherton is the only place that\r\ncould give her a _wish_ to go so far, but it cannot be, indeed. She\r\nwill have a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very\r\nwell; and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, I will\r\nanswer for his being most happy to join the party. He can go on\r\nhorseback, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s staying at\r\nhome, could only be sorry. \xe2\x80\x9cThe loss of her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s company would be\r\na great drawback, and she should have been extremely happy to have seen\r\nthe young lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet,\r\nand it was a pity she should not see the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs.\r\nNorris; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as to Fanny, she will have opportunities in plenty of\r\nseeing Sotherton. She has time enough before her; and her going now is\r\nquite out of the question. Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! I cannot do without Fanny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody must\r\nbe wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford in the\r\ninvitation; and though Mrs. Grant, who had not been at the trouble of\r\nvisiting Mrs. Rushworth, on her coming into the neighbourhood, civilly\r\ndeclined it on her own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure for\r\nher sister; and Mary, properly pressed and persuaded, was not long in\r\naccepting her share of the civility. Mr. Rushworth came back from the\r\nParsonage successful; and Edmund made his appearance just in time to\r\nlearn what had been settled for Wednesday, to attend Mrs. Rushworth to\r\nher carriage, and walk half-way down the park with the two other\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nOn his return to the breakfast-room, he found Mrs. Norris trying to\r\nmake up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s being of the party were\r\ndesirable or not, or whether her brother\xe2\x80\x99s barouche would not be full\r\nwithout her. The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea, assuring her that\r\nthe barouche would hold four perfectly well, independent of the box, on\r\nwhich _one_ might go with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why is it necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s carriage, or\r\nhis _only_, should be employed? Why is no use to be made of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchaise? I could not, when the scheme was first mentioned the other day,\r\nunderstand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the\r\ncarriage of the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Julia: \xe2\x80\x9cgo boxed up three in a postchaise in this\r\nweather, when we may have seats in a barouche! No, my dear Edmund, that\r\nwill not quite do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria, \xe2\x80\x9cI know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking\r\nus. After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, my dear Edmund,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs. Norris, \xe2\x80\x9ctaking out _two_ carriages\r\nwhen _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between\r\nourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and\r\nSotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching\r\nhis carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,\r\nwhen he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Maria; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and\r\ndoes not know how to drive. I will answer for it that we shall find no\r\ninconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\ngoing on the barouche box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnpleasant!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Maria: \xe2\x80\x9coh dear! I believe it would be generally\r\nthought the favourite seat. There can be no comparison as to one\xe2\x80\x99s view\r\nof the country. Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no objection, then, to Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s going with you; there can\r\nbe no doubt of your having room for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Norris; \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear Edmund, there is no idea of her\r\ngoing with us. She stays with her aunt. I told Mrs. Rushworth so. She\r\nis not expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can have no reason, I imagine, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, addressing his\r\nmother, \xe2\x80\x9cfor wishing Fanny _not_ to be of the party, but as it relates\r\nto yourself, to your own comfort. If you could do without her, you\r\nwould not wish to keep her at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure not, but I _cannot_ do without her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can, if I stay at home with you, as I mean to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a general cry out at this. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no\r\nnecessity for my going, and I mean to stay at home. Fanny has a great\r\ndesire to see Sotherton. I know she wishes it very much. She has not\r\noften a gratification of the kind, and I am sure, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you would be\r\nglad to give her the pleasure now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could\r\nremain\xe2\x80\x94their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could\r\nnot go, and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in\r\ntaking her, which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got\r\nover. It must have the strangest appearance! It would be something so\r\nvery unceremonious, so bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth,\r\nwhose own manners were such a pattern of good-breeding and attention,\r\nthat she really did not feel equal to it. Mrs. Norris had no affection\r\nfor Fanny, and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time; but her\r\nopposition to Edmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her own\r\nscheme, because it _was_ her own, than from anything else. She felt\r\nthat she had arranged everything extremely well, and that any\r\nalteration must be for the worse. When Edmund, therefore, told her in\r\nreply, as he did when she would give him the hearing, that she need not\r\ndistress herself on Mrs. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s account, because he had taken the\r\nopportunity, as he walked with her through the hall, of mentioning Miss\r\nPrice as one who would probably be of the party, and had directly\r\nreceived a very sufficient invitation for his cousin, Mrs. Norris was\r\ntoo much vexed to submit with a very good grace, and would only say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am\r\nsure I do not care about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems very odd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should be staying at home\r\ninstead of Fanny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d added Julia,\r\nhastily leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she\r\nought to offer to stay at home herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nEdmund\xe2\x80\x99s only reply, and the subject dropt.\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude, when she heard the plan, was, in fact, much greater\r\nthan her pleasure. She felt Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s kindness with all, and more than\r\nall, the sensibility which he, unsuspicious of her fond attachment,\r\ncould be aware of; but that he should forego any enjoyment on her\r\naccount gave her pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton\r\nwould be nothing without him.\r\n\r\nThe next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced another\r\nalteration in the plan, and one that was admitted with general\r\napprobation. Mrs. Grant offered herself as companion for the day to\r\nLady Bertram in lieu of her son, and Dr. Grant was to join them at\r\ndinner. Lady Bertram was very well pleased to have it so, and the young\r\nladies were in spirits again. Even Edmund was very thankful for an\r\narrangement which restored him to his share of the party; and Mrs.\r\nNorris thought it an excellent plan, and had it at her tongue\xe2\x80\x99s end,\r\nand was on the point of proposing it, when Mrs. Grant spoke.\r\n\r\nWednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived, Mr.\r\nCrawford driving his sisters; and as everybody was ready, there was\r\nnothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take\r\ntheir places. The place of all places, the envied seat, the post of\r\nhonour, was unappropriated. To whose happy lot was it to fall? While\r\neach of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best, and with the most\r\nappearance of obliging the others, to secure it, the matter was settled\r\nby Mrs. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s saying, as she stepped from the carriage, \xe2\x80\x9cAs there are\r\nfive of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry; and as\r\nyou were saying lately that you wished you could drive, Julia, I think\r\nthis will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHappy Julia! Unhappy Maria! The former was on the barouche-box in a\r\nmoment, the latter took her seat within, in gloom and mortification;\r\nand the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining\r\nladies, and the barking of Pug in his mistress\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\nTheir road was through a pleasant country; and Fanny, whose rides had\r\nnever been extensive, was soon beyond her knowledge, and was very happy\r\nin observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty. She\r\nwas not often invited to join in the conversation of the others, nor\r\ndid she desire it. Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her\r\nbest companions; and, in observing the appearance of the country, the\r\nbearings of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the\r\nharvest, the cottages, the cattle, the children, she found\r\nentertainment that could only have been heightened by having Edmund to\r\nspeak to of what she felt. That was the only point of resemblance\r\nbetween her and the lady who sat by her: in everything but a value for\r\nEdmund, Miss Crawford was very unlike her. She had none of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelicacy of taste, of mind, of feeling; she saw Nature, inanimate\r\nNature, with little observation; her attention was all for men and\r\nwomen, her talents for the light and lively. In looking back after\r\nEdmund, however, when there was any stretch of road behind them, or\r\nwhen he gained on them in ascending a considerable hill, they were\r\nunited, and a \xe2\x80\x9cthere he is\xe2\x80\x9d broke at the same moment from them both,\r\nmore than once.\r\n\r\nFor the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort:\r\nher prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side\r\nby side, full of conversation and merriment; and to see only his\r\nexpressive profile as he turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the\r\nlaugh of the other, was a perpetual source of irritation, which her own\r\nsense of propriety could but just smooth over. When Julia looked back,\r\nit was with a countenance of delight, and whenever she spoke to them,\r\nit was in the highest spirits: \xe2\x80\x9cher view of the country was charming,\r\nshe wished they could all see it,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.; but her only offer of exchange\r\nwas addressed to Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit of a long\r\nhill, and was not more inviting than this: \xe2\x80\x9cHere is a fine burst of\r\ncountry. I wish you had my seat, but I dare say you will not take it,\r\nlet me press you ever so much;\xe2\x80\x9d and Miss Crawford could hardly answer\r\nbefore they were moving again at a good pace.\r\n\r\nWhen they came within the influence of Sotherton associations, it was\r\nbetter for Miss Bertram, who might be said to have two strings to her\r\nbow. She had Rushworth feelings, and Crawford feelings, and in the\r\nvicinity of Sotherton the former had considerable effect. Mr.\r\nRushworth\xe2\x80\x99s consequence was hers. She could not tell Miss Crawford that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthose woods belonged to Sotherton,\xe2\x80\x9d she could not carelessly observe\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cshe believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s property on each\r\nside of the road,\xe2\x80\x9d without elation of heart; and it was a pleasure to\r\nincrease with their approach to the capital freehold mansion, and\r\nancient manorial residence of the family, with all its rights of\r\ncourt-leet and court-baron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford; our difficulties\r\nare over. The rest of the way is such as it ought to be. Mr. Rushworth\r\nhas made it since he succeeded to the estate. Here begins the village.\r\nThose cottages are really a disgrace. The church spire is reckoned\r\nremarkably handsome. I am glad the church is not so close to the great\r\nhouse as often happens in old places. The annoyance of the bells must\r\nbe terrible. There is the parsonage: a tidy-looking house, and I\r\nunderstand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people. Those are\r\nalmshouses, built by some of the family. To the right is the steward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse; he is a very respectable man. Now we are coming to the\r\nlodge-gates; but we have nearly a mile through the park still. It is\r\nnot ugly, you see, at this end; there is some fine timber, but the\r\nsituation of the house is dreadful. We go down hill to it for half a\r\nmile, and it is a pity, for it would not be an ill-looking place if it\r\nhad a better approach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford was not slow to admire; she pretty well guessed Miss\r\nBertram\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, and made it a point of honour to promote her\r\nenjoyment to the utmost. Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility;\r\nand even Fanny had something to say in admiration, and might be heard\r\nwith complacency. Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her\r\nreach; and after being at some pains to get a view of the house, and\r\nobserving that \xe2\x80\x9cit was a sort of building which she could not look at\r\nbut with respect,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, where is the avenue? The house\r\nfronts the east, I perceive. The avenue, therefore, must be at the back\r\nof it. Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little distance, and\r\nascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds. You may see\r\nsomething of it here\xe2\x80\x94something of the more distant trees. It is oak\r\nentirely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she had\r\nknown nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her opinion; and her\r\nspirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish,\r\nwhen they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady; and the whole\r\nparty were welcomed by him with due attention. In the drawing-room they\r\nwere met with equal cordiality by the mother, and Miss Bertram had all\r\nthe distinction with each that she could wish. After the business of\r\narriving was over, it was first necessary to eat, and the doors were\r\nthrown open to admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into\r\nthe appointed dining-parlour, where a collation was prepared with\r\nabundance and elegance. Much was said, and much was ate, and all went\r\nwell. The particular object of the day was then considered. How would\r\nMr. Crawford like, in what manner would he chuse, to take a survey of\r\nthe grounds? Mr. Rushworth mentioned his curricle. Mr. Crawford\r\nsuggested the greater desirableness of some carriage which might convey\r\nmore than two. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be depriving themselves of the advantage of other\r\neyes and other judgments, might be an evil even beyond the loss of\r\npresent pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also; but this\r\nwas scarcely received as an amendment: the young ladies neither smiled\r\nnor spoke. Her next proposition, of shewing the house to such of them\r\nas had not been there before, was more acceptable, for Miss Bertram was\r\npleased to have its size displayed, and all were glad to be doing\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nThe whole party rose accordingly, and under Mrs. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s guidance\r\nwere shewn through a number of rooms, all lofty, and many large, and\r\namply furnished in the taste of fifty years back, with shining floors,\r\nsolid mahogany, rich damask, marble, gilding, and carving, each\r\nhandsome in its way. Of pictures there were abundance, and some few\r\ngood, but the larger part were family portraits, no longer anything to\r\nanybody but Mrs. Rushworth, who had been at great pains to learn all\r\nthat the housekeeper could teach, and was now almost equally well\r\nqualified to shew the house. On the present occasion she addressed\r\nherself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny, but there was no comparison\r\nin the willingness of their attention; for Miss Crawford, who had seen\r\nscores of great houses, and cared for none of them, had only the\r\nappearance of civilly listening, while Fanny, to whom everything was\r\nalmost as interesting as it was new, attended with unaffected\r\nearnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in\r\nformer times, its rise and grandeur, regal visits and loyal efforts,\r\ndelighted to connect anything with history already known, or warm her\r\nimagination with scenes of the past.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect\r\nfrom any of the rooms; and while Fanny and some of the others were\r\nattending Mrs. Rushworth, Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking\r\nhis head at the windows. Every room on the west front looked across a\r\nlawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall iron\r\npalisades and gates.\r\n\r\nHaving visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any\r\nother use than to contribute to the window-tax, and find employment for\r\nhousemaids, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Rushworth, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are coming to the chapel,\r\nwhich properly we ought to enter from above, and look down upon; but as\r\nwe are quite among friends, I will take you in this way, if you will\r\nexcuse me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey entered. Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s imagination had prepared her for something\r\ngrander than a mere spacious, oblong room, fitted up for the purpose of\r\ndevotion: with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion\r\nof mahogany, and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge\r\nof the family gallery above. \xe2\x80\x9cI am disappointed,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in a low\r\nvoice, to Edmund. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not my idea of a chapel. There is nothing\r\nawful here, nothing melancholy, nothing grand. Here are no aisles, no\r\narches, no inscriptions, no banners. No banners, cousin, to be \xe2\x80\x98blown\r\nby the night wind of heaven.\xe2\x80\x99 No signs that a \xe2\x80\x98Scottish monarch sleeps\r\nbelow.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built, and for how\r\nconfined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles and\r\nmonasteries. It was only for the private use of the family. They have\r\nbeen buried, I suppose, in the parish church. _There_ you must look for\r\nthe banners and the achievements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I am disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth began her relation. \xe2\x80\x9cThis chapel was fitted up as you\r\nsee it, in James the Second\xe2\x80\x99s time. Before that period, as I\r\nunderstand, the pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to\r\nthink that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were\r\nonly purple cloth; but this is not quite certain. It is a handsome\r\nchapel, and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening.\r\nPrayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain, within the\r\nmemory of many; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery generation has its improvements,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, with a\r\nsmile, to Edmund.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford; and\r\nEdmund, Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fanny, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the custom should have been\r\ndiscontinued. It was a valuable part of former times. There is\r\nsomething in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great\r\nhouse, with one\xe2\x80\x99s ideas of what such a household should be! A whole\r\nfamily assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery fine indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must do the heads\r\nof the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and\r\nfootmen to leave business and pleasure, and say their prayers here\r\ntwice a day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That_ is hardly Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s idea of a family assembling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the master and mistress do _not_ attend themselves, there must be\r\nmore harm than good in the custom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such\r\nsubjects. Everybody likes to go their own way\xe2\x80\x94to chuse their own time\r\nand manner of devotion. The obligation of attendance, the formality,\r\nthe restraint, the length of time\xe2\x80\x94altogether it is a formidable thing,\r\nand what nobody likes; and if the good people who used to kneel and\r\ngape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come\r\nwhen men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed, when they woke\r\nwith a headache, without danger of reprobation, because chapel was\r\nmissed, they would have jumped with joy and envy. Cannot you imagine\r\nwith what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of\r\nRushworth did many a time repair to this chapel? The young Mrs.\r\nEleanors and Mrs. Bridgets\xe2\x80\x94starched up into seeming piety, but with\r\nheads full of something very different\xe2\x80\x94especially if the poor chaplain\r\nwere not worth looking at\xe2\x80\x94and, in those days, I fancy parsons were very\r\ninferior even to what they are now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a few moments she was unanswered. Fanny coloured and looked at\r\nEdmund, but felt too angry for speech; and he needed a little\r\nrecollection before he could say, \xe2\x80\x9cYour lively mind can hardly be\r\nserious even on serious subjects. You have given us an amusing sketch,\r\nand human nature cannot say it was not so. We must all feel _at_\r\n_times_ the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish; but if\r\nyou are supposing it a frequent thing, that is to say, a weakness grown\r\ninto a habit from neglect, what could be expected from the _private_\r\ndevotions of such persons? Do you think the minds which are suffered,\r\nwhich are indulged in wanderings in a chapel, would be more collected\r\nin a closet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very likely. They would have two chances at least in their\r\nfavour. There would be less to distract the attention from without, and\r\nit would not be tried so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mind which does not struggle against itself under _one_\r\ncircumstance, would find objects to distract it in the _other_, I\r\nbelieve; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse\r\nbetter feelings than are begun with. The greater length of the service,\r\nhowever, I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind. One\r\nwishes it were not so; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to\r\nforget what chapel prayers are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about the\r\nchapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s attention to her sister, by saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria, standing side by side, exactly as\r\nif the ceremony were going to be performed. Have not they completely\r\nthe air of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence, and stepping forward to Maria,\r\nsaid, in a voice which she only could hear, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not like to see Miss\r\nBertram so near the altar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStarting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two, but recovering\r\nherself in a moment, affected to laugh, and asked him, in a tone not\r\nmuch louder, \xe2\x80\x9cIf he would give her away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I should do it very awkwardly,\xe2\x80\x9d was his reply, with a look\r\nof meaning.\r\n\r\nJulia, joining them at the moment, carried on the joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take place\r\ndirectly, if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether,\r\nand nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d And she\r\ntalked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the\r\ncomprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother, and expose her sister to\r\nthe whispered gallantries of her lover, while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with\r\nproper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her\r\nwhenever it took place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Edmund were but in orders!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Julia, and running to where he\r\nstood with Miss Crawford and Fanny: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Edmund, if you were but in\r\norders now, you might perform the ceremony directly. How unlucky that\r\nyou are not ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, as Julia spoke, might have amused a\r\ndisinterested observer. She looked almost aghast under the new idea she\r\nwas receiving. Fanny pitied her. \xe2\x80\x9cHow distressed she will be at what\r\nshe said just now,\xe2\x80\x9d passed across her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrdained!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat, are you to be a clergyman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I shall take orders soon after my father\xe2\x80\x99s return\xe2\x80\x94probably at\r\nChristmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford, rallying her spirits, and recovering her complexion,\r\nreplied only, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had known this before, I would have spoken of the\r\ncloth with more respect,\xe2\x80\x9d and turned the subject.\r\n\r\nThe chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness which\r\nreigned in it, with few interruptions, throughout the year. Miss\r\nBertram, displeased with her sister, led the way, and all seemed to\r\nfeel that they had been there long enough.\r\n\r\nThe lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn, and Mrs.\r\nRushworth, never weary in the cause, would have proceeded towards the\r\nprincipal staircase, and taken them through all the rooms above, if her\r\nson had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nif,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with the sort of self-evident proposition which many a\r\nclearer head does not always avoid, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are _too_ long going over the\r\nhouse, we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors. It\r\nis past two, and we are to dine at five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth submitted; and the question of surveying the grounds,\r\nwith the who and the how, was likely to be more fully agitated, and\r\nMrs. Norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and\r\nhorses most could be done, when the young people, meeting with an\r\noutward door, temptingly open on a flight of steps which led\r\nimmediately to turf and shrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure-grounds,\r\nas by one impulse, one wish for air and liberty, all walked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we turn down here for the present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Rushworth,\r\ncivilly taking the hint and following them. \xe2\x80\x9cHere are the greatest\r\nnumber of our plants, and here are the curious pheasants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuery,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Crawford, looking round him, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether we may not find\r\nsomething to employ us here before we go farther? I see walls of great\r\npromise. Mr. Rushworth, shall we summon a council on this lawn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJames,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Rushworth to her son, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the wilderness will\r\nbe new to all the party. The Miss Bertrams have never seen the\r\nwilderness yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo objection was made, but for some time there seemed no inclination to\r\nmove in any plan, or to any distance. All were attracted at first by\r\nthe plants or the pheasants, and all dispersed about in happy\r\nindependence. Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the\r\ncapabilities of that end of the house. The lawn, bounded on each side\r\nby a high wall, contained beyond the first planted area a\r\nbowling-green, and beyond the bowling-green a long terrace walk, backed\r\nby iron palisades, and commanding a view over them into the tops of the\r\ntrees of the wilderness immediately adjoining. It was a good spot for\r\nfault-finding. Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr.\r\nRushworth; and when, after a little time, the others began to form into\r\nparties, these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by\r\nEdmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and\r\nwho, after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties,\r\nleft them and walked on. The remaining three, Mrs. Rushworth, Mrs.\r\nNorris, and Julia, were still far behind; for Julia, whose happy star\r\nno longer prevailed, was obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth,\r\nand restrain her impatient feet to that lady\xe2\x80\x99s slow pace, while her\r\naunt, having fallen in with the housekeeper, who was come out to feed\r\nthe pheasants, was lingering behind in gossip with her. Poor Julia, the\r\nonly one out of the nine not tolerably satisfied with their lot, was\r\nnow in a state of complete penance, and as different from the Julia of\r\nthe barouche-box as could well be imagined. The politeness which she\r\nhad been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible for her to\r\nescape; while the want of that higher species of self-command, that\r\njust consideration of others, that knowledge of her own heart, that\r\nprinciple of right, which had not formed any essential part of her\r\neducation, made her miserable under it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is insufferably hot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, when they had taken one\r\nturn on the terrace, and were drawing a second time to the door in the\r\nmiddle which opened to the wilderness. \xe2\x80\x9cShall any of us object to being\r\ncomfortable? Here is a nice little wood, if one can but get into it.\r\nWhat happiness if the door should not be locked! but of course it is;\r\nfor in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go\r\nwhere they like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door, however, proved not to be locked, and they were all agreed in\r\nturning joyfully through it, and leaving the unmitigated glare of day\r\nbehind. A considerable flight of steps landed them in the wilderness,\r\nwhich was a planted wood of about two acres, and though chiefly of\r\nlarch and laurel, and beech cut down, and though laid out with too much\r\nregularity, was darkness and shade, and natural beauty, compared with\r\nthe bowling-green and the terrace. They all felt the refreshment of it,\r\nand for some time could only walk and admire. At length, after a short\r\npause, Miss Crawford began with, \xe2\x80\x9cSo you are to be a clergyman, Mr.\r\nBertram. This is rather a surprise to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it surprise you? You must suppose me designed for some\r\nprofession, and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer, nor a\r\nsoldier, nor a sailor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me. And you know\r\nthere is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the\r\nsecond son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very praiseworthy practice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not quite universal.\r\nI am one of the exceptions, and _being_ one, must do something for\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why are you to be a clergyman? I thought _that_ was always the lot\r\nof the youngest, where there were many to chuse before him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the church itself never chosen, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Never_ is a black word. But yes, in the _never_ of conversation,\r\nwhich means _not_ _very_ _often_, I do think it. For what is to be done\r\nin the church? Men love to distinguish themselves, and in either of the\r\nother lines distinction may be gained, but not in the church. A\r\nclergyman is nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _nothing_ of conversation has its gradations, I hope, as well as\r\nthe _never_. A clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion. He must\r\nnot head mobs, or set the ton in dress. But I cannot call that\r\nsituation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first\r\nimportance to mankind, individually or collectively considered,\r\ntemporally and eternally, which has the guardianship of religion and\r\nmorals, and consequently of the manners which result from their\r\ninfluence. No one here can call the _office_ nothing. If the man who\r\nholds it is so, it is by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its just\r\nimportance, and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not\r\nto appear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been\r\nused to hear given, or than I can quite comprehend. One does not see\r\nmuch of this influence and importance in society, and how can it be\r\nacquired where they are so seldom seen themselves? How can two sermons\r\na week, even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to\r\nhave the sense to prefer Blair\xe2\x80\x99s to his own, do all that you speak of?\r\ngovern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for\r\nthe rest of the week? One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ are speaking of London, _I_ am speaking of the nation at large.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample of the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the\r\nkingdom. We do not look in great cities for our best morality. It is\r\nnot there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good;\r\nand it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be\r\nmost felt. A fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in\r\nfine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish\r\nand his neighbourhood, where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size\r\ncapable of knowing his private character, and observing his general\r\nconduct, which in London can rarely be the case. The clergy are lost\r\nthere in the crowds of their parishioners. They are known to the\r\nlargest part only as preachers. And with regard to their influencing\r\npublic manners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I\r\nmean to call them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators of\r\nrefinement and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life. The\r\n_manners_ I speak of might rather be called _conduct_, perhaps, the\r\nresult of good principles; the effect, in short, of those doctrines\r\nwhich it is their duty to teach and recommend; and it will, I believe,\r\nbe everywhere found, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought\r\nto be, so are the rest of the nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, with gentle earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Crawford, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have quite convinced Miss Price\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could convince Miss Crawford too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think you ever will,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with an arch smile; \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\njust as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to\r\ntake orders. You really are fit for something better. Come, do change\r\nyour mind. It is not too late. Go into the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo into the law! With as much ease as I was told to go into this\r\nwilderness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you are going to say something about law being the worst\r\nwilderness of the two, but I forestall you; remember, I have\r\nforestalled you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a\r\n_bon_ _mot_, for there is not the least wit in my nature. I am a very\r\nmatter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a\r\nrepartee for half an hour together without striking it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA general silence succeeded. Each was thoughtful. Fanny made the first\r\ninterruption by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder that I should be tired with only\r\nwalking in this sweet wood; but the next time we come to a seat, if it\r\nis not disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Edmund, immediately drawing her arm within his,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow thoughtless I have been! I hope you are not very tired. Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nturning to Miss Crawford, \xe2\x80\x9cmy other companion may do me the honour of\r\ntaking an arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, but I am not at all tired.\xe2\x80\x9d She took it, however, as she\r\nspoke, and the gratification of having her do so, of feeling such a\r\nconnexion for the first time, made him a little forgetful of Fanny.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou scarcely touch me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not make me of any use. What\r\na difference in the weight of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s arm from that of a man! At\r\nOxford I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the\r\nlength of a street, and you are only a fly in the comparison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am really not tired, which I almost wonder at; for we must have\r\nwalked at least a mile in this wood. Do not you think we have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot half a mile,\xe2\x80\x9d was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet so much in\r\nlove as to measure distance, or reckon time, with feminine lawlessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you do not consider how much we have wound about. We have taken\r\nsuch a very serpentine course, and the wood itself must be half a mile\r\nlong in a straight line, for we have never seen the end of it yet since\r\nwe left the first great path.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you remember, before we left that first great path, we saw\r\ndirectly to the end of it. We looked down the whole vista, and saw it\r\nclosed by iron gates, and it could not have been more than a furlong in\r\nlength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure it is a very long\r\nwood, and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into\r\nit; and therefore, when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I must\r\nspeak within compass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been exactly a quarter of an hour here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, taking\r\nout his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think we are walking four miles an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! do not attack me with your watch. A watch is always too fast or\r\ntoo slow. I cannot be dictated to by a watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the very walk\r\nthey had been talking of; and standing back, well shaded and sheltered,\r\nand looking over a ha-ha into the park, was a comfortable-sized bench,\r\non which they all sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you are very tired, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, observing her;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhy would not you speak sooner? This will be a bad day\xe2\x80\x99s amusement for\r\nyou if you are to be knocked up. Every sort of exercise fatigues her so\r\nsoon, Miss Crawford, except riding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as I did all\r\nlast week! I am ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happen\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Your_ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my\r\nown neglect. Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s interest seems in safer hands with you than with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise; for there\r\nis nothing in the course of one\xe2\x80\x99s duties so fatiguing as what we have\r\nbeen doing this morning: seeing a great house, dawdling from one room\r\nto another, straining one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and one\xe2\x80\x99s attention, hearing what one\r\ndoes not understand, admiring what one does not care for. It is\r\ngenerally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price\r\nhas found it so, though she did not know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon be rested,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny; \xe2\x80\x9cto sit in the shade on a fine\r\nday, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again. \xe2\x80\x9cI must move,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she; \xe2\x80\x9cresting fatigues me. I have looked across the ha-ha till I\r\nam weary. I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view,\r\nwithout being able to see it so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund left the seat likewise. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Miss Crawford, if you will look up\r\nthe walk, you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile\r\nlong, or half half a mile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an immense distance,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cI see _that_ with a glance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe still reasoned with her, but in vain. She would not calculate, she\r\nwould not compare. She would only smile and assert. The greatest degree\r\nof rational consistency could not have been more engaging, and they\r\ntalked with mutual satisfaction. At last it was agreed that they should\r\nendeavour to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a little\r\nmore about it. They would go to one end of it, in the line they were\r\nthen in\xe2\x80\x94for there was a straight green walk along the bottom by the\r\nside of the ha-ha\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps turn a little way in some other\r\ndirection, if it seemed likely to assist them, and be back in a few\r\nminutes. Fanny said she was rested, and would have moved too, but this\r\nwas not suffered. Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an\r\nearnestness which she could not resist, and she was left on the bench\r\nto think with pleasure of her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s care, but with great regret that\r\nshe was not stronger. She watched them till they had turned the corner,\r\nand listened till all sound of them had ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and Fanny was still\r\nthinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without interruption\r\nfrom any one. She began to be surprised at being left so long, and to\r\nlisten with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices\r\nagain. She listened, and at length she heard; she heard voices and feet\r\napproaching; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those\r\nshe wanted, when Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issued\r\nfrom the same path which she had trod herself, and were before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Price all alone\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Fanny, how comes this?\xe2\x80\x9d were the\r\nfirst salutations. She told her story. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d cried her\r\ncousin, \xe2\x80\x9chow ill you have been used by them! You had better have staid\r\nwith us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen seating herself with a gentleman on each side, she resumed the\r\nconversation which had engaged them before, and discussed the\r\npossibility of improvements with much animation. Nothing was fixed on;\r\nbut Henry Crawford was full of ideas and projects, and, generally\r\nspeaking, whatever he proposed was immediately approved, first by her,\r\nand then by Mr. Rushworth, whose principal business seemed to be to\r\nhear the others, and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own\r\nbeyond a wish that they had seen his friend Smith\xe2\x80\x99s place.\r\n\r\nAfter some minutes spent in this way, Miss Bertram, observing the iron\r\ngate, expressed a wish of passing through it into the park, that their\r\nviews and their plans might be more comprehensive. It was the very\r\nthing of all others to be wished, it was the best, it was the only way\r\nof proceeding with any advantage, in Henry Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s opinion; and he\r\ndirectly saw a knoll not half a mile off, which would give them exactly\r\nthe requisite command of the house. Go therefore they must to that\r\nknoll, and through that gate; but the gate was locked. Mr. Rushworth\r\nwished he had brought the key; he had been very near thinking whether\r\nhe should not bring the key; he was determined he would never come\r\nwithout the key again; but still this did not remove the present evil.\r\nThey could not get through; and as Miss Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s inclination for so\r\ndoing did by no means lessen, it ended in Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s declaring\r\noutright that he would go and fetch the key. He set off accordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we are so far from\r\nthe house already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Crawford, when he was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is nothing else to be done. But now, sincerely, do not you\r\nfind the place altogether worse than you expected?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, far otherwise. I find it better, grander, more complete in\r\nits style, though that style may not be the best. And to tell you the\r\ntruth,\xe2\x80\x9d speaking rather lower, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not think that _I_ shall ever see\r\nSotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now. Another summer will\r\nhardly improve it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassment the lady replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are too much a\r\nman of the world not to see with the eyes of the world. If other people\r\nthink Sotherton improved, I have no doubt that you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be\r\ngood for me in some points. My feelings are not quite so evanescent,\r\nnor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be\r\nthe case with men of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a short silence. Miss Bertram began again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nseemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning. I was glad to\r\nsee you so well entertained. You and Julia were laughing the whole\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere we? Yes, I believe we were; but I have not the least recollection\r\nat what. Oh! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of\r\nan old Irish groom of my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s. Your sister loves to laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think her more light-hearted than I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore easily amused,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cconsequently, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d smiling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbetter company. I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish\r\nanecdotes during a ten miles\xe2\x80\x99 drive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally, I believe, I am as lively as Julia, but I have more to\r\nthink of now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in which very high\r\nspirits would denote insensibility. Your prospects, however, are too\r\nfair to justify want of spirits. You have a very smiling scene before\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean literally or figuratively? Literally, I conclude. Yes,\r\ncertainly, the sun shines, and the park looks very cheerful. But\r\nunluckily that iron gate, that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint\r\nand hardship. \xe2\x80\x98I cannot get out,\xe2\x80\x99 as the starling said.\xe2\x80\x9d As she spoke,\r\nand it was with expression, she walked to the gate: he followed her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Rushworth is so long fetching this key!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for the world you would not get out without the key and without\r\nMr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s authority and protection, or I think you might with\r\nlittle difficulty pass round the edge of the gate, here, with my\r\nassistance; I think it might be done, if you really wished to be more\r\nat large, and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProhibited! nonsense! I certainly can get out that way, and I will.\r\nMr. Rushworth will be here in a moment, you know; we shall not be out\r\nof sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will\r\nfind us near that knoll: the grove of oak on the knoll.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny, feeling all this to be wrong, could not help making an effort to\r\nprevent it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will hurt yourself, Miss Bertram,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nwill certainly hurt yourself against those spikes; you will tear your\r\ngown; you will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had better\r\nnot go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken,\r\nand, smiling with all the good-humour of success, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\r\nmy dear Fanny, but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was again left to her solitude, and with no increase of pleasant\r\nfeelings, for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard,\r\nastonished at Miss Bertram, and angry with Mr. Crawford. By taking a\r\ncircuitous, and, as it appeared to her, very unreasonable direction to\r\nthe knoll, they were soon beyond her eye; and for some minutes longer\r\nshe remained without sight or sound of any companion. She seemed to\r\nhave the little wood all to herself. She could almost have thought that\r\nEdmund and Miss Crawford had left it, but that it was impossible for\r\nEdmund to forget her so entirely.\r\n\r\nShe was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps:\r\nsomebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk. She\r\nexpected Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who, hot and out of breath,\r\nand with a look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her, \xe2\x80\x9cHeyday!\r\nWhere are the others? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty trick, upon my word! I cannot see them anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d looking\r\neagerly into the park. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they cannot be very far off, and I think I\r\nam equal to as much as Maria, even without help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key. Do\r\nwait for Mr. Rushworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, indeed. I have had enough of the family for one morning. Why,\r\nchild, I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother. Such a\r\npenance as I have been enduring, while you were sitting here so\r\ncomposed and so happy! It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had\r\nbeen in my place, but you always contrive to keep out of these\r\nscrapes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow for it, and\r\nlet it pass: Julia was vexed, and her temper was hasty; but she felt\r\nthat it would not last, and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her\r\nif she had not seen Mr. Rushworth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, we saw him. He was posting away as if upon life and death,\r\nand could but just spare time to tell us his errand, and where you all\r\nwere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That_ is Miss Maria\xe2\x80\x99s concern. I am not obliged to punish myself for\r\n_her_ sins. The mother I could not avoid, as long as my tiresome aunt\r\nwas dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son I _can_ get away\r\nfrom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, not\r\nattending to Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s last question of whether she had seen anything of\r\nMiss Crawford and Edmund. The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of\r\nseeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continued\r\nabsence, however, as she might have done. She felt that he had been\r\nvery ill-used, and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had\r\npassed. He joined her within five minutes after Julia\xe2\x80\x99s exit; and\r\nthough she made the best of the story, he was evidently mortified and\r\ndispleased in no common degree. At first he scarcely said anything; his\r\nlooks only expressed his extreme surprise and vexation, and he walked\r\nto the gate and stood there, without seeming to know what to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey desired me to stay\xe2\x80\x94my cousin Maria charged me to say that you\r\nwould find them at that knoll, or thereabouts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe I shall go any farther,\xe2\x80\x9d said he sullenly; \xe2\x80\x9cI see\r\nnothing of them. By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone\r\nsomewhere else. I have had walking enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cit is very unlucky.\xe2\x80\x9d And she longed to be\r\nable to say something more to the purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of silence, \xe2\x80\x9cI think they might as well have staid\r\nfor me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bertram thought you would follow her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not have had to follow her if she had staid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis could not be denied, and Fanny was silenced. After another pause,\r\nhe went on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPray, Miss Price, are you such a great admirer of this Mr.\r\nCrawford as some people are? For my part, I can see nothing in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think him at all handsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandsome! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome. He is not\r\nfive foot nine. I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot\r\neight. I think he is an ill-looking fellow. In my opinion, these\r\nCrawfords are no addition at all. We did very well without them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA small sigh escaped Fanny here, and she did not know how to contradict\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had made any difficulty about fetching the key, there might have\r\nbeen some excuse, but I went the very moment she said she wanted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure, and I dare\r\nsay you walked as fast as you could; but still it is some distance, you\r\nknow, from this spot to the house, quite into the house; and when\r\npeople are waiting, they are bad judges of time, and every half minute\r\nseems like five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe got up and walked to the gate again, and \xe2\x80\x9cwished he had had the key\r\nabout him at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d Fanny thought she discerned in his standing\r\nthere an indication of relenting, which encouraged her to another\r\nattempt, and she said, therefore, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity you should not join\r\nthem. They expected to have a better view of the house from that part\r\nof the park, and will be thinking how it may be improved; and nothing\r\nof that sort, you know, can be settled without you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining a\r\ncompanion. Mr. Rushworth was worked on. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif you really\r\nthink I had better go: it would be foolish to bring the key for\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d And letting himself out, he walked off without farther\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so\r\nlong ago, and getting quite impatient, she resolved to go in search of\r\nthem. She followed their steps along the bottom walk, and had just\r\nturned up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford\r\nonce more caught her ear; the sound approached, and a few more windings\r\nbrought them before her. They were just returned into the wilderness\r\nfrom the park, to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very\r\nsoon after their leaving her, and they had been across a portion of the\r\npark into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning\r\nto reach at last, and had been sitting down under one of the trees.\r\nThis was their history. It was evident that they had been spending\r\ntheir time pleasantly, and were not aware of the length of their\r\nabsence. Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s best consolation was in being assured that Edmund had\r\nwished for her very much, and that he should certainly have come back\r\nfor her, had she not been tired already; but this was not quite\r\nsufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a whole hour,\r\nwhen he had talked of only a few minutes, nor to banish the sort of\r\ncuriosity she felt to know what they had been conversing about all that\r\ntime; and the result of the whole was to her disappointment and\r\ndepression, as they prepared by general agreement to return to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace, Mrs. Rushworth and\r\nMrs. Norris presented themselves at the top, just ready for the\r\nwilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the\r\nhouse. Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster. Whatever\r\ncross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces,\r\nshe had found a morning of complete enjoyment; for the housekeeper,\r\nafter a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken\r\nher to the dairy, told her all about their cows, and given her the\r\nreceipt for a famous cream cheese; and since Julia\xe2\x80\x99s leaving them they\r\nhad been met by the gardener, with whom she had made a most\r\nsatisfactory acquaintance, for she had set him right as to his\r\ngrandson\xe2\x80\x99s illness, convinced him that it was an ague, and promised him\r\na charm for it; and he, in return, had shewn her all his choicest\r\nnursery of plants, and actually presented her with a very curious\r\nspecimen of heath.\r\n\r\nOn this _rencontre_ they all returned to the house together, there to\r\nlounge away the time as they could with sofas, and chit-chat, and\r\nQuarterly Reviews, till the return of the others, and the arrival of\r\ndinner. It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came\r\nin, and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially\r\nagreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the\r\nobject of the day. By their own accounts they had been all walking\r\nafter each other, and the junction which had taken place at last\r\nseemed, to Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s observation, to have been as much too late for\r\nre-establishing harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on\r\nany alteration. She felt, as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth,\r\nthat hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them: there was\r\ngloom on the face of each. Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more\r\ngay, and she thought that he was taking particular pains, during\r\ndinner, to do away any little resentment of the other two, and restore\r\ngeneral good-humour.\r\n\r\nDinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles\xe2\x80\x99 drive home\r\nallowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their sitting down to\r\ntable, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage\r\ncame to the door, and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained\r\na few pheasants\xe2\x80\x99 eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and made\r\nabundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth, was ready to lead the\r\nway. At the same moment Mr. Crawford, approaching Julia, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope\r\nI am not to lose my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air\r\nin so exposed a seat.\xe2\x80\x9d The request had not been foreseen, but was very\r\ngraciously received, and Julia\xe2\x80\x99s day was likely to end almost as well\r\nas it began. Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different,\r\nand was a little disappointed; but her conviction of being really the\r\none preferred comforted her under it, and enabled her to receive Mr.\r\nRushworth\xe2\x80\x99s parting attentions as she ought. He was certainly better\r\npleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending\r\nthe box, and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Norris, as they drove through the park. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing but pleasure from\r\nbeginning to end! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your\r\naunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go. A pretty good day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\namusement you have had!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria was just discontented enough to say directly, \xe2\x80\x9cI think _you_ have\r\ndone pretty well yourself, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Your lap seems full of good things,\r\nand here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my\r\nelbow unmercifully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice old\r\ngardener would make me take; but if it is in your way, I will have it\r\nin my lap directly. There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me;\r\ntake great care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just\r\nlike the excellent one we had at dinner. Nothing would satisfy that\r\ngood old Mrs. Whitaker, but my taking one of the cheeses. I stood out\r\nas long as I could, till the tears almost came into her eyes, and I\r\nknew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with. That\r\nMrs. Whitaker is a treasure! She was quite shocked when I asked her\r\nwhether wine was allowed at the second table, and she has turned away\r\ntwo housemaids for wearing white gowns. Take care of the cheese, Fanny.\r\nNow I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else have you been spunging?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria, half-pleased that\r\nSotherton should be so complimented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpunging, my dear! It is nothing but four of those beautiful\r\npheasants\xe2\x80\x99 eggs, which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me: she\r\nwould not take a denial. She said it must be such an amusement to me,\r\nas she understood I lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures\r\nof that sort; and so to be sure it will. I shall get the dairymaid to\r\nset them under the first spare hen, and if they come to good I can have\r\nthem moved to my own house and borrow a coop; and it will be a great\r\ndelight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them. And if I have good\r\nluck, your mother shall have some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful evening, mild and still, and the drive was as\r\npleasant as the serenity of Nature could make it; but when Mrs. Norris\r\nceased speaking, it was altogether a silent drive to those within.\r\nTheir spirits were in general exhausted; and to determine whether the\r\nday had afforded most pleasure or pain, might occupy the meditations of\r\nalmost all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day at Sotherton, with all its imperfections, afforded the Miss\r\nBertrams much more agreeable feelings than were derived from the\r\nletters from Antigua, which soon afterwards reached Mansfield. It was\r\nmuch pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father; and to\r\nthink of their father in England again within a certain period, which\r\nthese letters obliged them to do, was a most unwelcome exercise.\r\n\r\nNovember was the black month fixed for his return. Sir Thomas wrote of\r\nit with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise. His\r\nbusiness was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take\r\nhis passage in the September packet, and he consequently looked forward\r\nwith the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November.\r\n\r\nMaria was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her the father brought a\r\nhusband, and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness\r\nwould unite her to the lover, on whom she had chosen that happiness\r\nshould depend. It was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was to\r\nthrow a mist over it, and hope when the mist cleared away she should\r\nsee something else. It would hardly be _early_ in November, there were\r\ngenerally delays, a bad passage or _something_; that favouring\r\n_something_ which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look, or\r\ntheir understandings while they reason, feels the comfort of. It would\r\nprobably be the middle of November at least; the middle of November was\r\nthree months off. Three months comprised thirteen weeks. Much might\r\nhappen in thirteen weeks.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that\r\nhis daughters felt on the subject of his return, and would hardly have\r\nfound consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the\r\nbreast of another young lady. Miss Crawford, on walking up with her\r\nbrother to spend the evening at Mansfield Park, heard the good news;\r\nand though seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness,\r\nand to have vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation, heard it\r\nwith an attention not so easily satisfied. Mrs. Norris gave the\r\nparticulars of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea,\r\nas Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny\r\nlooking out on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr.\r\nRushworth, and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the\r\npianoforte, she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group,\r\nand saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHow happy Mr. Rushworth looks! He is thinking of\r\nNovember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father\xe2\x80\x99s return will be a very interesting event.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but\r\nincluding so many dangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, and your taking orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be affronted,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it does put me in mind\r\nof some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits\r\nin a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe\r\nreturn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no sacrifice in the case,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Edmund, with a serious\r\nsmile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; \xe2\x80\x9cit is entirely her own\r\ndoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes I know it is. I was merely joking. She has done no more than\r\nwhat every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her being\r\nextremely happy. My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarrying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is fortunate that your inclination and your father\xe2\x80\x99s convenience\r\nshould accord so well. There is a very good living kept for you, I\r\nunderstand, hereabouts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you suppose has biassed me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _that_ I am sure it has not,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fanny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would\r\naffirm myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a\r\nprovision for me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it\r\nshould. There was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see\r\nno reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he\r\nwill have a competence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I\r\nshould not have been influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my\r\nfather was too conscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt that I\r\nwas biased, but I think it was blamelessly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the same sort of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, after a short pause, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nfor the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general\r\nto be in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. Nobody\r\nwonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve\r\nthem best, or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they\r\nappear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, either\r\nnavy or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its\r\nfavour: heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are\r\nalways acceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers\r\nand sailors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of\r\npreferment may be fairly suspected, you think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be\r\njustified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertainty\r\nof any provision.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! take orders without a living! No; that is madness indeed;\r\nabsolute madness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither to\r\ntake orders with a living nor without? No; for you certainly would not\r\nknow what to say. But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from\r\nyour own argument. As he cannot be influenced by those feelings which\r\nyou rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in\r\ntheir choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are\r\nall against him, he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting\r\nsincerity or good intentions in the choice of his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made, to\r\nthe trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of doing\r\nnothing all the rest of his days but eat, drink, and grow fat. It is\r\nindolence, Mr. Bertram, indeed. Indolence and love of ease; a want of\r\nall laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination to\r\ntake the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen. A\r\nclergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish\xe2\x80\x94read the\r\nnewspaper, watch the weather, and quarrel with his wife. His curate\r\ndoes all the work, and the business of his own life is to dine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so common\r\nas to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character. I\r\nsuspect that in this comprehensive and (may I say) commonplace censure,\r\nyou are not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons, whose\r\nopinions you have been in the habit of hearing. It is impossible that\r\nyour own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy.\r\nYou can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men\r\nyou condemn so conclusively. You are speaking what you have been told\r\nat your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion\r\nis general, it is usually correct. Though _I_ have not seen much of the\r\ndomestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any\r\ndeficiency of information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are\r\ncondemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information,\r\nor (smiling) of something else. Your uncle, and his brother admirals,\r\nperhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or\r\nbad, they were always wishing away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor William! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the\r\nAntwerp,\xe2\x80\x9d was a tender apostrophe of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s, very much to the purpose\r\nof her own feelings if not of the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Crawford, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I can hardly suppose\xe2\x80\x94and since you push me so\r\nhard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of\r\nseeing what clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my\r\nown brother, Dr. Grant. And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging\r\nto me, and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good\r\nscholar and clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very\r\nrespectable, _I_ see him to be an indolent, selfish _bon_ _vivant_, who\r\nmust have his palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a\r\nfinger for the convenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook\r\nmakes a blunder, is out of humour with his excellent wife. To own the\r\ntruth, Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a\r\ndisappointment about a green goose, which he could not get the better\r\nof. My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a great\r\ndefect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence;\r\nand to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to\r\nsuch feelings as yours. Fanny, it goes against us. We cannot attempt to\r\ndefend Dr. Grant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fanny, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we need not give up his profession for all\r\nthat; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he would have\r\ntaken a\xe2\x80\x94not a good temper into it; and as he must, either in the navy\r\nor army, have had a great many more people under his command than he\r\nhas now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor\r\nor soldier than as a clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that\r\nwhatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in\r\na greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly\r\nprofession, where he would have had less time and obligation\xe2\x80\x94where he\r\nmight have escaped that knowledge of himself, the _frequency_, at\r\nleast, of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he\r\nis now. A man\xe2\x80\x94a sensible man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of\r\nteaching others their duty every week, cannot go to church twice every\r\nSunday, and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he\r\ndoes, without being the better for it himself. It must make him think;\r\nand I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than\r\nhe would if he had been anything but a clergyman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better\r\nfate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness\r\ndepends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a\r\ngood-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling\r\nabout green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund\r\naffectionately, \xe2\x80\x9cmust be beyond the reach of any sermons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time\r\nto say, in a pleasant manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI fancy Miss Price has been more used to\r\ndeserve praise than to hear it\xe2\x80\x9d; when, being earnestly invited by the\r\nMiss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument,\r\nleaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her\r\nmany virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful\r\ntread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere goes good-humour, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said he presently. \xe2\x80\x9cThere goes a\r\ntemper which would never give pain! How well she walks! and how readily\r\nshe falls in with the inclination of others! joining them the moment\r\nshe is asked. What a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, after an instant\xe2\x80\x99s reflection,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat she should have been in such hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny agreed to it, and had the pleasure of seeing him continue at the\r\nwindow with her, in spite of the expected glee; and of having his eyes\r\nsoon turned, like hers, towards the scene without, where all that was\r\nsolemn, and soothing, and lovely, appeared in the brilliancy of an\r\nunclouded night, and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods. Fanny\r\nspoke her feelings. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s harmony!\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s repose! Here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry only\r\ncan attempt to describe! Here\xe2\x80\x99s what may tranquillise every care, and\r\nlift the heart to rapture! When I look out on such a night as this, I\r\nfeel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world;\r\nand there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature\r\nwere more attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves\r\nby contemplating such a scene.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny. It is a lovely night, and they\r\nare much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree,\r\nas you do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature in\r\nearly life. They lose a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a very apt scholar. There\xe2\x80\x99s Arcturus looking very bright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the Bear. I wish I could see Cassiopeia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must go out on the lawn for that. Should you be afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least. It is a great while since we have had any\r\nstar-gazing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I do not know how it has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d The glee began. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will stay\r\ntill this is finished, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning his back on the window;\r\nand as it advanced, she had the mortification of seeing him advance\r\ntoo, moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument, and when\r\nit ceased, he was close by the singers, among the most urgent in\r\nrequesting to hear the glee again.\r\n\r\nFanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthreats of catching cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Thomas was to return in November, and his eldest son had duties to\r\ncall him earlier home. The approach of September brought tidings of Mr.\r\nBertram, first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter to\r\nEdmund; and by the end of August he arrived himself, to be gay,\r\nagreeable, and gallant again as occasion served, or Miss Crawford\r\ndemanded; to tell of races and Weymouth, and parties and friends, to\r\nwhich she might have listened six weeks before with some interest, and\r\naltogether to give her the fullest conviction, by the power of actual\r\ncomparison, of her preferring his younger brother.\r\n\r\nIt was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it; but so it\r\nwas; and so far from now meaning to marry the elder, she did not even\r\nwant to attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty\r\nrequired: his lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything but\r\npleasure in view, and his own will to consult, made it perfectly clear\r\nthat he did not care about her; and his indifference was so much more\r\nthan equalled by her own, that were he now to step forth the owner of\r\nMansfield Park, the Sir Thomas complete, which he was to be in time,\r\nshe did not believe she could accept him.\r\n\r\nThe season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to Mansfield took\r\nMr. Crawford into Norfolk. Everingham could not do without him in the\r\nbeginning of September. He went for a fortnight\xe2\x80\x94a fortnight of such\r\ndullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their\r\nguard, and made even Julia admit, in her jealousy of her sister, the\r\nabsolute necessity of distrusting his attentions, and wishing him not\r\nto return; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure, in the intervals of\r\nshooting and sleeping, to have convinced the gentleman that he ought to\r\nkeep longer away, had he been more in the habit of examining his own\r\nmotives, and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity\r\nwas tending; but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad\r\nexample, he would not look beyond the present moment. The sisters,\r\nhandsome, clever, and encouraging, were an amusement to his sated mind;\r\nand finding nothing in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of\r\nMansfield, he gladly returned to it at the time appointed, and was\r\nwelcomed thither quite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nMaria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her, and doomed to the\r\nrepeated details of his day\xe2\x80\x99s sport, good or bad, his boast of his\r\ndogs, his jealousy of his neighbours, his doubts of their\r\nqualifications, and his zeal after poachers, subjects which will not\r\nfind their way to female feelings without some talent on one side or\r\nsome attachment on the other, had missed Mr. Crawford grievously; and\r\nJulia, unengaged and unemployed, felt all the right of missing him much\r\nmore. Each sister believed herself the favourite. Julia might be\r\njustified in so doing by the hints of Mrs. Grant, inclined to credit\r\nwhat she wished, and Maria by the hints of Mr. Crawford himself.\r\nEverything returned into the same channel as before his absence; his\r\nmanners being to each so animated and agreeable as to lose no ground\r\nwith either, and just stopping short of the consistence, the\r\nsteadiness, the solicitude, and the warmth which might excite general\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nFanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike; but\r\nsince the day at Sotherton, she could never see Mr. Crawford with\r\neither sister without observation, and seldom without wonder or\r\ncensure; and had her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her\r\nexercise of it in every other respect, had she been sure that she was\r\nseeing clearly, and judging candidly, she would probably have made some\r\nimportant communications to her usual confidant. As it was, however,\r\nshe only hazarded a hint, and the hint was lost. \xe2\x80\x9cI am rather\r\nsurprised,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Crawford should come back again so\r\nsoon, after being here so long before, full seven weeks; for I had\r\nunderstood he was so very fond of change and moving about, that I\r\nthought something would certainly occur, when he was once gone, to take\r\nhim elsewhere. He is used to much gayer places than Mansfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is to his credit,\xe2\x80\x9d was Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s answer; \xe2\x80\x9cand I dare say it gives\r\nhis sister pleasure. She does not like his unsettled habits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a favourite he is with my cousins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, his manners to women are such as must please. Mrs. Grant, I\r\nbelieve, suspects him of a preference for Julia; I have never seen much\r\nsymptom of it, but I wish it may be so. He has no faults but what a\r\nserious attachment would remove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Miss Bertram were not engaged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny cautiously, \xe2\x80\x9cI could\r\nsometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia best, than you,\r\nFanny, may be aware; for I believe it often happens that a man, before\r\nhe has quite made up his own mind, will distinguish the sister or\r\nintimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the\r\nwoman herself. Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found\r\nhimself in any danger from Maria; and I am not at all afraid for her,\r\nafter such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think\r\ndifferently in future; but with all that submission to Edmund could do,\r\nand all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she\r\noccasionally noticed in some of the others, and which seemed to say\r\nthat Julia was Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s choice, she knew not always what to\r\nthink. She was privy, one evening, to the hopes of her aunt Norris on\r\nthe subject, as well as to her feelings, and the feelings of Mrs.\r\nRushworth, on a point of some similarity, and could not help wondering\r\nas she listened; and glad would she have been not to be obliged to\r\nlisten, for it was while all the other young people were dancing, and\r\nshe sitting, most unwillingly, among the chaperons at the fire, longing\r\nfor the re-entrance of her elder cousin, on whom all her own hopes of a\r\npartner then depended. It was Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s first ball, though without the\r\npreparation or splendour of many a young lady\xe2\x80\x99s first ball, being the\r\nthought only of the afternoon, built on the late acquisition of a\r\nviolin player in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall, and the possibility of raising\r\nfive couple with the help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of\r\nMr. Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s just arrived on a visit. It had, however, been a very\r\nhappy one to Fanny through four dances, and she was quite grieved to be\r\nlosing even a quarter of an hour. While waiting and wishing, looking\r\nnow at the dancers and now at the door, this dialogue between the two\r\nabove-mentioned ladies was forced on her\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Norris, her eyes directed towards Mr.\r\nRushworth and Maria, who were partners for the second time, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall\r\nsee some happy faces again now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, with a stately simper, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nwill be some satisfaction in looking on _now_, and I think it was\r\nrather a pity they should have been obliged to part. Young folks in\r\ntheir situation should be excused complying with the common forms. I\r\nwonder my son did not propose it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say he did, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Mr. Rushworth is never remiss. But dear\r\nMaria has such a strict sense of propriety, so much of that true\r\ndelicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays, Mrs. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x94that wish\r\nof avoiding particularity! Dear ma\xe2\x80\x99am, only look at her face at this\r\nmoment; how different from what it was the two last dances!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bertram did indeed look happy, her eyes were sparkling with\r\npleasure, and she was speaking with great animation, for Julia and her\r\npartner, Mr. Crawford, were close to her; they were all in a cluster\r\ntogether. How she had looked before, Fanny could not recollect, for she\r\nhad been dancing with Edmund herself, and had not thought about her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris continued, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite delightful, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, to see young\r\npeople so properly happy, so well suited, and so much the thing! I\r\ncannot but think of dear Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s delight. And what do you say,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, to the chance of another match? Mr. Rushworth has set a good\r\nexample, and such things are very catching.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth, who saw nothing but her son, was quite at a loss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe couple above, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Do you see no symptoms there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford. Yes, indeed, a very pretty\r\nmatch. What is his property?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour thousand a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they\r\nhave. Four thousand a year is a pretty estate, and he seems a very\r\ngenteel, steady young man, so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a settled thing, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, yet. We only speak of it among\r\nfriends. But I have very little doubt it _will_ be. He is growing\r\nextremely particular in his attentions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny could listen no farther. Listening and wondering were all\r\nsuspended for a time, for Mr. Bertram was in the room again; and though\r\nfeeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him, she thought it\r\nmust happen. He came towards their little circle; but instead of asking\r\nher to dance, drew a chair near her, and gave her an account of the\r\npresent state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom, from whom\r\nhe had just parted. Fanny found that it was not to be, and in the\r\nmodesty of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonable\r\nin expecting it. When he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper\r\nfrom the table, and looking over it, said in a languid way, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nwant to dance, Fanny, I will stand up with you.\xe2\x80\x9d With more than equal\r\ncivility the offer was declined; she did not wish to dance. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad\r\nof it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a much brisker tone, and throwing down the\r\nnewspaper again, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am tired to death. I only wonder how the good\r\npeople can keep it up so long. They had need be _all_ in love, to find\r\nany amusement in such folly; and so they are, I fancy. If you look at\r\nthem you may see they are so many couple of lovers\xe2\x80\x94all but Yates and\r\nMrs. Grant\xe2\x80\x94and, between ourselves, she, poor woman, must want a lover\r\nas much as any one of them. A desperate dull life hers must be with the\r\ndoctor,\xe2\x80\x9d making a sly face as he spoke towards the chair of the latter,\r\nwho proving, however, to be close at his elbow, made so instantaneous a\r\nchange of expression and subject necessary, as Fanny, in spite of\r\neverything, could hardly help laughing at. \xe2\x80\x9cA strange business this in\r\nAmerica, Dr. Grant! What is your opinion? I always come to you to know\r\nwhat I am to think of public matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d cried his aunt soon afterwards, \xe2\x80\x9cas you are not dancing,\r\nI dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber; shall\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d Then leaving her seat, and coming to him to enforce the proposal,\r\nadded in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth, you\r\nknow. Your mother is quite anxious about it, but cannot very well spare\r\ntime to sit down herself, because of her fringe. Now, you and I and Dr.\r\nGrant will just do; and though _we_ play but half-crowns, you know, you\r\nmay bet half-guineas with _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be most happy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he aloud, and jumping up with\r\nalacrity, \xe2\x80\x9cit would give me the greatest pleasure; but that I am this\r\nmoment going to dance. Come, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d taking her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not be\r\ndawdling any longer, or the dance will be over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was led off very willingly, though it was impossible for her to\r\nfeel much gratitude towards her cousin, or distinguish, as he certainly\r\ndid, between the selfishness of another person and his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty modest request upon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d he indignantly exclaimed as\r\nthey walked away. \xe2\x80\x9cTo want to nail me to a card-table for the next two\r\nhours with herself and Dr. Grant, who are always quarrelling, and that\r\npoking old woman, who knows no more of whist than of algebra. I wish my\r\ngood aunt would be a little less busy! And to ask me in such a way too!\r\nwithout ceremony, before them all, so as to leave me no possibility of\r\nrefusing. _That_ is what I dislike most particularly. It raises my\r\nspleen more than anything, to have the pretence of being asked, of\r\nbeing given a choice, and at the same time addressed in such a way as\r\nto oblige one to do the very thing, whatever it be! If I had not\r\nluckily thought of standing up with you I could not have got out of it.\r\nIt is a great deal too bad. But when my aunt has got a fancy in her\r\nhead, nothing can stop her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Honourable John Yates, this new friend, had not much to recommend\r\nhim beyond habits of fashion and expense, and being the younger son of\r\na lord with a tolerable independence; and Sir Thomas would probably\r\nhave thought his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable. Mr.\r\nBertram\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth, where they had\r\nspent ten days together in the same society, and the friendship, if\r\nfriendship it might be called, had been proved and perfected by Mr.\r\nYates\xe2\x80\x99s being invited to take Mansfield in his way, whenever he could,\r\nand by his promising to come; and he did come rather earlier than had\r\nbeen expected, in consequence of the sudden breaking-up of a large\r\nparty assembled for gaiety at the house of another friend, which he had\r\nleft Weymouth to join. He came on the wings of disappointment, and with\r\nhis head full of acting, for it had been a theatrical party; and the\r\nplay in which he had borne a part was within two days of\r\nrepresentation, when the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions\r\nof the family had destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers. To\r\nbe so near happiness, so near fame, so near the long paragraph in\r\npraise of the private theatricals at Ecclesford, the seat of the Right\r\nHon. Lord Ravenshaw, in Cornwall, which would of course have\r\nimmortalised the whole party for at least a twelvemonth! and being so\r\nnear, to lose it all, was an injury to be keenly felt, and Mr. Yates\r\ncould talk of nothing else. Ecclesford and its theatre, with its\r\narrangements and dresses, rehearsals and jokes, was his never-failing\r\nsubject, and to boast of the past his only consolation.\r\n\r\nHappily for him, a love of the theatre is so general, an itch for\r\nacting so strong among young people, that he could hardly out-talk the\r\ninterest of his hearers. From the first casting of the parts to the\r\nepilogue it was all bewitching, and there were few who did not wish to\r\nhave been a party concerned, or would have hesitated to try their\r\nskill. The play had been Lovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows, and Mr. Yates was to have been\r\nCount Cassel. \xe2\x80\x9cA trifling part,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand not at all to my taste,\r\nand such a one as I certainly would not accept again; but I was\r\ndetermined to make no difficulties. Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had\r\nappropriated the only two characters worth playing before I reached\r\nEcclesford; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me, it\r\nwas impossible to take it, you know. I was sorry for _him_ that he\r\nshould have so mistaken his powers, for he was no more equal to the\r\nBaron\xe2\x80\x94a little man with a weak voice, always hoarse after the first ten\r\nminutes. It must have injured the piece materially; but _I_ was\r\nresolved to make no difficulties. Sir Henry thought the duke not equal\r\nto Frederick, but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself;\r\nwhereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two. I was surprised\r\nto see Sir Henry such a stick. Luckily the strength of the piece did\r\nnot depend upon him. Our Agatha was inimitable, and the duke was\r\nthought very great by many. And upon the whole, it would certainly have\r\ngone off wonderfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a hard case, upon my word\xe2\x80\x9d; and, \xe2\x80\x9cI do think you were very much\r\nto be pitied,\xe2\x80\x9d were the kind responses of listening sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the poor old dowager\r\ncould not have died at a worse time; and it is impossible to help\r\nwishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three\r\ndays we wanted. It was but three days; and being only a grandmother,\r\nand all happening two hundred miles off, I think there would have been\r\nno great harm, and it was suggested, I know; but Lord Ravenshaw, who I\r\nsuppose is one of the most correct men in England, would not hear of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn afterpiece instead of a comedy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bertram. \xe2\x80\x9cLovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows\r\nwere at an end, and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother\r\nby themselves. Well, the jointure may comfort _him_; and perhaps,\r\nbetween friends, he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in\r\nthe Baron, and was not sorry to withdraw; and to make _you_ amends,\r\nYates, I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield, and ask you\r\nto be our manager.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis, though the thought of the moment, did not end with the moment;\r\nfor the inclination to act was awakened, and in no one more strongly\r\nthan in him who was now master of the house; and who, having so much\r\nleisure as to make almost any novelty a certain good, had likewise such\r\na degree of lively talents and comic taste, as were exactly adapted to\r\nthe novelty of acting. The thought returned again and again. \xe2\x80\x9cOh for\r\nthe Ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with.\xe2\x80\x9d Each sister\r\ncould echo the wish; and Henry Crawford, to whom, in all the riot of\r\nhis gratifications it was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at\r\nthe idea. \xe2\x80\x9cI really believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI could be fool enough at this\r\nmoment to undertake any character that ever was written, from Shylock\r\nor Richard III down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat\r\nand cocked hat. I feel as if I could be anything or everything; as if I\r\ncould rant and storm, or sigh or cut capers, in any tragedy or comedy\r\nin the English language. Let us be doing something. Be it only half a\r\nplay, an act, a scene; what should prevent us? Not these countenances,\r\nI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d looking towards the Miss Bertrams; \xe2\x80\x9cand for a theatre, what\r\nsignifies a theatre? We shall be only amusing ourselves. Any room in\r\nthis house might suffice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have a curtain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Bertram; \xe2\x80\x9ca few yards of green baize\r\nfor a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quite enough,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Yates, \xe2\x80\x9cwith only just a side wing or two\r\nrun up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be let down; nothing\r\nmore would be necessary on such a plan as this. For mere amusement\r\namong ourselves we should want nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe we must be satisfied with _less_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria. \xe2\x80\x9cThere would\r\nnot be time, and other difficulties would arise. We must rather adopt\r\nMr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s views, and make the _performance_, not the _theatre_,\r\nour object. Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, who began to listen with alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us do nothing\r\nby halves. If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted\r\nup with pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire from\r\nbeginning to end; so as it be a German play, no matter what, with a\r\ngood tricking, shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe,\r\nand a song between the acts. If we do not outdo Ecclesford, we do\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Edmund, do not be disagreeable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julia. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody loves a play\r\nbetter than you do, or can have gone much farther to see one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, to see real acting, good hardened real acting; but I would\r\nhardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of\r\nthose who have not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and\r\nladies, who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to\r\nstruggle through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause, however, the subject still continued, and was\r\ndiscussed with unabated eagerness, every one\xe2\x80\x99s inclination increasing\r\nby the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest; and\r\nthough nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy,\r\nand his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the\r\nworld could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all,\r\nthe resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to make\r\nEdmund quite uncomfortable. He was determined to prevent it, if\r\npossible, though his mother, who equally heard the conversation which\r\npassed at table, did not evince the least disapprobation.\r\n\r\nThe same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying his strength.\r\nMaria, Julia, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates were in the billiard-room.\r\nTom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where Edmund was\r\nstanding thoughtfully by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa\r\nat a little distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging her work,\r\nthus began as he entered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a horribly vile billiard-table as ours\r\nis not to be met with, I believe, above ground. I can stand it no\r\nlonger, and I think, I may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it\r\nagain; but one good thing I have just ascertained: it is the very room\r\nfor a theatre, precisely the shape and length for it; and the doors at\r\nthe farther end, communicating with each other, as they may be made to\r\ndo in five minutes, by merely moving the bookcase in my father\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nis the very thing we could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for\r\nit; and my father\xe2\x80\x99s room will be an excellent greenroom. It seems to\r\njoin the billiard-room on purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, in a low\r\nvoice, as his brother approached the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot serious! never more so, I assure you. What is there to surprise\r\nyou in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be very wrong. In a _general_ light, private\r\ntheatricals are open to some objections, but as _we_ are circumstanced,\r\nI must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than injudicious\r\nto attempt anything of the kind. It would shew great want of feeling on\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s account, absent as he is, and in some degree of constant\r\ndanger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria, whose\r\nsituation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely\r\ndelicate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take up a thing so seriously! as if we were going to act three\r\ntimes a week till my father\xe2\x80\x99s return, and invite all the country. But\r\nit is not to be a display of that sort. We mean nothing but a little\r\namusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our\r\npowers in something new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be\r\ntrusted, I think, in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable;\r\nand I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing\r\nin the elegant written language of some respectable author than in\r\nchattering in words of our own. I have no fears and no scruples. And as\r\nto my father\xe2\x80\x99s being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I\r\nconsider it rather as a motive; for the expectation of his return must\r\nbe a very anxious period to my mother; and if we can be the means of\r\namusing that anxiety, and keeping up her spirits for the next few\r\nweeks, I shall think our time very well spent, and so, I am sure, will\r\nhe. It is a _very_ anxious period for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said this, each looked towards their mother. Lady Bertram, sunk\r\nback in one corner of the sofa, the picture of health, wealth, ease,\r\nand tranquillity, was just falling into a gentle doze, while Fanny was\r\ngetting through the few difficulties of her work for her.\r\n\r\nEdmund smiled and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! this won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom, throwing himself into a chair with\r\na hearty laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, my dear mother, your anxiety\xe2\x80\x94I was unlucky\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her ladyship, in the heavy tone of one\r\nhalf-roused; \xe2\x80\x9cI was not asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, no, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, nobody suspected you! Well, Edmund,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\nreturning to the former subject, posture, and voice, as soon as Lady\r\nBertram began to nod again, \xe2\x80\x9cbut _this_ I _will_ maintain, that we\r\nshall be doing no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot agree with you; I am convinced that my father would totally\r\ndisapprove it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am convinced to the contrary. Nobody is fonder of the exercise\r\nof talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my father, and for\r\nanything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he has always\r\na decided taste. I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys. How many a\r\ntime have we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar, and to _be\xe2\x80\x99d_\r\nand not _to_ _be\xe2\x80\x99d_, in this very room, for his amusement? And I am\r\nsure, _my_ _name_ _was_ _Norval_, every evening of my life through one\r\nChristmas holidays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very different thing. You must see the difference yourself.\r\nMy father wished us, as schoolboys, to speak well, but he would never\r\nwish his grown-up daughters to be acting plays. His sense of decorum is\r\nstrict.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, displeased. \xe2\x80\x9cI know my father as well as\r\nyou do; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress\r\nhim. Manage your own concerns, Edmund, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of the rest\r\nof the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are resolved on acting,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the persevering Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust hope it will be in a very small and quiet way; and I think a\r\ntheatre ought not to be attempted. It would be taking liberties with my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house in his absence which could not be justified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor everything of that nature I will be answerable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, in a\r\ndecided tone. \xe2\x80\x9cHis house shall not be hurt. I have quite as great an\r\ninterest in being careful of his house as you can have; and as to such\r\nalterations as I was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase, or\r\nunlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room for the space of a\r\nweek without playing at billiards in it, you might just as well suppose\r\nhe would object to our sitting more in this room, and less in the\r\nbreakfast-room, than we did before he went away, or to my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other. Absolute\r\nnonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be wrong as an\r\nexpense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious! Perhaps\r\nit might cost a whole twenty pounds. Something of a theatre we must\r\nhave undoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain\r\nand a little carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s work, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all; and as the carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be\r\ntoo absurd to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson is employed,\r\neverything will be right with Sir Thomas. Don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that nobody in\r\nthis house can see or judge but yourself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t act yourself, if you do\r\nnot like it, but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to govern everybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, as to acting myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9c_that_ I absolutely protest\r\nagainst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom walked out of the room as he said it, and Edmund was left to sit\r\ndown and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation.\r\n\r\nFanny, who had heard it all, and borne Edmund company in every feeling\r\nthroughout the whole, now ventured to say, in her anxiety to suggest\r\nsome comfort, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit\r\nthem. Your brother\xe2\x80\x99s taste and your sisters\xe2\x80\x99 seem very different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no hope there, Fanny. If they persist in the scheme, they will\r\nfind something. I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _them_,\r\nand that is all I can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think my aunt Norris would be on your side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say she would, but she has no influence with either Tom or my\r\nsisters that could be of any use; and if I cannot convince them myself,\r\nI shall let things take their course, without attempting it through\r\nher. Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better\r\ndo anything than be altogether by the ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next\r\nmorning, were quite as impatient of his advice, quite as unyielding to\r\nhis representation, quite as determined in the cause of pleasure, as\r\nTom. Their mother had no objection to the plan, and they were not in\r\nthe least afraid of their father\xe2\x80\x99s disapprobation. There could be no\r\nharm in what had been done in so many respectable families, and by so\r\nmany women of the first consideration; and it must be scrupulousness\r\nrun mad that could see anything to censure in a plan like theirs,\r\ncomprehending only brothers and sisters and intimate friends, and which\r\nwould never be heard of beyond themselves. Julia _did_ seem inclined to\r\nadmit that Maria\xe2\x80\x99s situation might require particular caution and\r\ndelicacy\xe2\x80\x94but that could not extend to _her_\xe2\x80\x94she was at liberty; and\r\nMaria evidently considered her engagement as only raising her so much\r\nmore above restraint, and leaving her less occasion than Julia to\r\nconsult either father or mother. Edmund had little to hope, but he was\r\nstill urging the subject when Henry Crawford entered the room, fresh\r\nfrom the Parsonage, calling out, \xe2\x80\x9cNo want of hands in our theatre, Miss\r\nBertram. No want of understrappers: my sister desires her love, and\r\nhopes to be admitted into the company, and will be happy to take the\r\npart of any old duenna or tame confidante, that you may not like to do\r\nyourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaria gave Edmund a glance, which meant, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat say you now? Can we be\r\nwrong if Mary Crawford feels the same?\xe2\x80\x9d And Edmund, silenced, was\r\nobliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry\r\nfascination to the mind of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to\r\ndwell more on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message than\r\non anything else.\r\n\r\nThe scheme advanced. Opposition was vain; and as to Mrs. Norris, he was\r\nmistaken in supposing she would wish to make any. She started no\r\ndifficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her eldest\r\nnephew and niece, who were all-powerful with her; and as the whole\r\narrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody, and none at\r\nall to herself, as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry, bustle,\r\nand importance, and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself\r\nobliged to leave her own house, where she had been living a month at\r\nher own cost, and take up her abode in theirs, that every hour might be\r\nspent in their service, she was, in fact, exceedingly delighted with\r\nthe project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nFanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed. The business\r\nof finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle; and\r\nthe carpenter had received his orders and taken his measurements, had\r\nsuggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties, and having\r\nmade the necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident,\r\nwas already at work, while a play was still to seek. Other preparations\r\nwere also in hand. An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from\r\nNorthampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her good\r\nmanagement of full three-quarters of a yard), and was actually forming\r\ninto a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; and\r\nas two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to\r\nhope that none might ever be found.\r\n\r\nThere were, in fact, so many things to be attended to, so many people\r\nto be pleased, so many best characters required, and, above all, such a\r\nneed that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that\r\nthere did seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by\r\nyouth and zeal could hold out.\r\n\r\nOn the tragic side were the Miss Bertrams, Henry Crawford, and Mr.\r\nYates; on the comic, Tom Bertram, not _quite_ alone, because it was\r\nevident that Mary Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s wishes, though politely kept back,\r\ninclined the same way: but his determinateness and his power seemed to\r\nmake allies unnecessary; and, independent of this great irreconcilable\r\ndifference, they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the\r\nwhole, but every character first-rate, and three principal women. All\r\nthe best plays were run over in vain. Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor\r\nOthello, nor Douglas, nor The Gamester, presented anything that could\r\nsatisfy even the tragedians; and The Rivals, The School for Scandal,\r\nWheel of Fortune, Heir at Law, and a long et cetera, were successively\r\ndismissed with yet warmer objections. No piece could be proposed that\r\ndid not supply somebody with a difficulty, and on one side or the other\r\nit was a continual repetition of, \xe2\x80\x9cOh no, _that_ will never do! Let us\r\nhave no ranting tragedies. Too many characters. Not a tolerable woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart in the play. Anything but _that_, my dear Tom. It would be\r\nimpossible to fill it up. One could not expect anybody to take such a\r\npart. Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end. _That_ might do,\r\nperhaps, but for the low parts. If I _must_ give my opinion, I have\r\nalways thought it the most insipid play in the English language. _I_ do\r\nnot wish to make objections; I shall be happy to be of any use, but I\r\nthink we could not chuse worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the selfishness\r\nwhich, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them all, and wondering\r\nhow it would end. For her own gratification she could have wished that\r\nsomething might be acted, for she had never seen even half a play, but\r\neverything of higher consequence was against it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will never do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Bertram at last. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are wasting time\r\nmost abominably. Something must be fixed on. No matter what, so that\r\nsomething is chosen. We must not be so nice. A few characters too many\r\nmust not frighten us. We must _double_ them. We must descend a little.\r\nIf a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything\r\nof it. From this moment I make no difficulties. I take any part you\r\nchuse to give me, so as it be comic. Let it but be comic, I condition\r\nfor nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor about the fifth time he then proposed the Heir at Law, doubting\r\nonly whether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss for himself; and\r\nvery earnestly, but very unsuccessfully, trying to persuade the others\r\nthat there were some fine tragic parts in the rest of the Dramatis\r\nPerson\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nThe pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same\r\nspeaker, who, taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on\r\nthe table, and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows! And\r\nwhy should not Lovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows do for _us_ as well as for the Ravenshaws?\r\nHow came it never to be thought of before? It strikes me as if it would\r\ndo exactly. What say you all? Here are two capital tragic parts for\r\nYates and Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me, if nobody\r\nelse wants it; a trifling part, but the sort of thing I should not\r\ndislike, and, as I said before, I am determined to take anything and do\r\nmy best. And as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody. It is\r\nonly Count Cassel and Anhalt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was generally welcome. Everybody was growing weary of\r\nindecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had\r\nbeen proposed before so likely to suit them all. Mr. Yates was\r\nparticularly pleased: he had been sighing and longing to do the Baron\r\nat Ecclesford, had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw\xe2\x80\x99s, and been\r\nforced to re-rant it all in his own room. The storm through Baron\r\nWildenheim was the height of his theatrical ambition; and with the\r\nadvantage of knowing half the scenes by heart already, he did now, with\r\nthe greatest alacrity, offer his services for the part. To do him\r\njustice, however, he did not resolve to appropriate it; for remembering\r\nthat there was some very good ranting-ground in Frederick, he professed\r\nan equal willingness for that. Henry Crawford was ready to take either.\r\nWhichever Mr. Yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him, and a\r\nshort parley of compliment ensued. Miss Bertram, feeling all the\r\ninterest of an Agatha in the question, took on her to decide it, by\r\nobserving to Mr. Yates that this was a point in which height and figure\r\nought to be considered, and that _his_ being the tallest, seemed to fit\r\nhim peculiarly for the Baron. She was acknowledged to be quite right,\r\nand the two parts being accepted accordingly, she was certain of the\r\nproper Frederick. Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr.\r\nRushworth, who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do\r\nanything; when Julia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to\r\nbe scrupulous on Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s account.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not behaving well by the absent,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cHere are not\r\nwomen enough. Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is\r\nnothing for your sister, Mr. Crawford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of: he was very sure\r\nhis sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful, and that\r\nshe would not allow herself to be considered in the present case. But\r\nthis was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of\r\nAmelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if she\r\nwould accept it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt falls as naturally, as necessarily to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cas Agatha does to one or other of my sisters. It can be no\r\nsacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA short silence followed. Each sister looked anxious; for each felt the\r\nbest claim to Agatha, and was hoping to have it pressed on her by the\r\nrest. Henry Crawford, who meanwhile had taken up the play, and with\r\nseeming carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must entreat Miss _Julia_ Bertram,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to engage in the\r\npart of Agatha, or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity. You must\r\nnot, indeed you must not\xe2\x80\x9d (turning to her). \xe2\x80\x9cI could not stand your\r\ncountenance dressed up in woe and paleness. The many laughs we have had\r\ntogether would infallibly come across me, and Frederick and his\r\nknapsack would be obliged to run away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the manner was lost in the\r\nmatter to Julia\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed\r\nthe injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted,\r\nMaria was preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to\r\nsuppress shewed how well it was understood; and before Julia could\r\ncommand herself enough to speak, her brother gave his weight against\r\nher too, by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! Maria must be Agatha. Maria will be the\r\nbest Agatha. Though Julia fancies she prefers tragedy, I would not\r\ntrust her in it. There is nothing of tragedy about her. She has not the\r\nlook of it. Her features are not tragic features, and she walks too\r\nquick, and speaks too quick, and would not keep her countenance. She\r\nhad better do the old countrywoman: the Cottager\xe2\x80\x99s wife; you had,\r\nindeed, Julia. Cottager\xe2\x80\x99s wife is a very pretty part, I assure you. The\r\nold lady relieves the high-flown benevolence of her husband with a good\r\ndeal of spirit. You shall be Cottager\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCottager\xe2\x80\x99s wife!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Yates. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking of? The most\r\ntrivial, paltry, insignificant part; the merest commonplace; not a\r\ntolerable speech in the whole. Your sister do that! It is an insult to\r\npropose it. At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it. We all\r\nagreed that it could not be offered to anybody else. A little more\r\njustice, Mr. Manager, if you please. You do not deserve the office, if\r\nyou cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, as to _that_, my good friend, till I and my company have really\r\nacted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement to\r\nJulia. We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife; and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being\r\nsatisfied with the old Butler. If the part is trifling she will have\r\nmore credit in making something of it; and if she is so desperately\r\nbent against everything humorous, let her take Cottager\xe2\x80\x99s speeches\r\ninstead of Cottager\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x99s, and so change the parts all through; _he_\r\nis solemn and pathetic enough, I am sure. It could make no difference\r\nin the play, and as for Cottager himself, when he has got his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspeeches, _I_ would undertake him with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all your partiality for Cottager\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Crawford,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister, and\r\nwe must not suffer her good-nature to be imposed on. We must not\r\n_allow_ her to accept the part. She must not be left to her own\r\ncomplaisance. Her talents will be wanted in Amelia. Amelia is a\r\ncharacter more difficult to be well represented than even Agatha. I\r\nconsider Amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece. It\r\nrequires great powers, great nicety, to give her playfulness and\r\nsimplicity without extravagance. I have seen good actresses fail in the\r\npart. Simplicity, indeed, is beyond the reach of almost every actress\r\nby profession. It requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not.\r\nIt requires a gentlewoman\xe2\x80\x94a Julia Bertram. You _will_ undertake it, I\r\nhope?\xe2\x80\x9d turning to her with a look of anxious entreaty, which softened\r\nher a little; but while she hesitated what to say, her brother again\r\ninterposed with Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s better claim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Julia must not be Amelia. It is not at all the part for her.\r\nShe would not like it. She would not do well. She is too tall and\r\nrobust. Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure. It\r\nis fit for Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only. She looks the part,\r\nand I am persuaded will do it admirably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout attending to this, Henry Crawford continued his supplication.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must oblige us,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cindeed you must. When you have studied\r\nthe character, I am sure you will feel it suit you. Tragedy may be your\r\nchoice, but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _you_. You will\r\nbe to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions; you will not\r\nrefuse to visit me in prison? I think I see you coming in with your\r\nbasket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe influence of his voice was felt. Julia wavered; but was he only\r\ntrying to soothe and pacify her, and make her overlook the previous\r\naffront? She distrusted him. The slight had been most determined. He\r\nwas, perhaps, but at treacherous play with her. She looked suspiciously\r\nat her sister; Maria\xe2\x80\x99s countenance was to decide it: if she were vexed\r\nand alarmed\xe2\x80\x94but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction, and Julia\r\nwell knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her\r\nexpense. With hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she\r\nsaid to him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance\r\nwhen I come in with a basket of provisions\xe2\x80\x94though one might have\r\nsupposed\xe2\x80\x94but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe stopped\xe2\x80\x94Henry Crawford looked rather foolish, and as if he did not\r\nknow what to say. Tom Bertram began again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Crawford must be Amelia. She will be an excellent Amelia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be afraid of _my_ wanting the character,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Julia, with\r\nangry quickness: \xe2\x80\x9cI am _not_ to be Agatha, and I am sure I will do\r\nnothing else; and as to Amelia, it is of all parts in the world the\r\nmost disgusting to me. I quite detest her. An odious, little, pert,\r\nunnatural, impudent girl. I have always protested against comedy, and\r\nthis is comedy in its worst form.\xe2\x80\x9d And so saying, she walked hastily\r\nout of the room, leaving awkward feelings to more than one, but\r\nexciting small compassion in any except Fanny, who had been a quiet\r\nauditor of the whole, and who could not think of her as under the\r\nagitations of _jealousy_ without great pity.\r\n\r\nA short silence succeeded her leaving them; but her brother soon\r\nreturned to business and Lovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows, and was eagerly looking over the\r\nplay, with Mr. Yates\xe2\x80\x99s help, to ascertain what scenery would be\r\nnecessary\xe2\x80\x94while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an\r\nunder-voice, and the declaration with which she began of, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I\r\nwould give up the part to Julia most willingly, but that though I shall\r\nprobably do it very ill, I feel persuaded _she_ would do it worse,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\ndoubtless receiving all the compliments it called for.\r\n\r\nWhen this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completed\r\nby Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in\r\nthe room now beginning to be called _the_ _Theatre_, and Miss Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of Amelia\r\nto Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.\r\n\r\nThe first use she made of her solitude was to take up the volume which\r\nhad been left on the table, and begin to acquaint herself with the play\r\nof which she had heard so much. Her curiosity was all awake, and she\r\nran through it with an eagerness which was suspended only by intervals\r\nof astonishment, that it could be chosen in the present instance, that\r\nit could be proposed and accepted in a private theatre! Agatha and\r\nAmelia appeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for\r\nhome representation\xe2\x80\x94the situation of one, and the language of the\r\nother, so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty, that she could\r\nhardly suppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging\r\nin; and longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the\r\nremonstrance which Edmund would certainly make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford accepted the part very readily; and soon after Miss\r\nBertram\xe2\x80\x99s return from the Parsonage, Mr. Rushworth arrived, and another\r\ncharacter was consequently cast. He had the offer of Count Cassel and\r\nAnhalt, and at first did not know which to chuse, and wanted Miss\r\nBertram to direct him; but upon being made to understand the different\r\nstyle of the characters, and which was which, and recollecting that he\r\nhad once seen the play in London, and had thought Anhalt a very stupid\r\nfellow, he soon decided for the Count. Miss Bertram approved the\r\ndecision, for the less he had to learn the better; and though she could\r\nnot sympathise in his wish that the Count and Agatha might be to act\r\ntogether, nor wait very patiently while he was slowly turning over the\r\nleaves with the hope of still discovering such a scene, she very kindly\r\ntook his part in hand, and curtailed every speech that admitted being\r\nshortened; besides pointing out the necessity of his being very much\r\ndressed, and chusing his colours. Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his\r\nfinery very well, though affecting to despise it; and was too much\r\nengaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others,\r\nor draw any of those conclusions, or feel any of that displeasure which\r\nMaria had been half prepared for.\r\n\r\nThus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all the morning,\r\nknew anything of the matter; but when he entered the drawing-room\r\nbefore dinner, the buzz of discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and\r\nMr. Yates; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to\r\ntell him the agreeable news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have got a play,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is to be Lovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows; and I am to\r\nbe Count Cassel, and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink\r\nsatin cloak, and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit, by way\r\nof a shooting-dress. I do not know how I shall like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed Edmund, and her heart beat for him as she heard\r\nthis speech, and saw his look, and felt what his sensations must be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows!\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone of the greatest amazement, was his only reply\r\nto Mr. Rushworth, and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if\r\nhardly doubting a contradiction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Yates. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all our debatings and difficulties, we\r\nfind there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well, nothing so\r\nunexceptionable, as Lovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows. The wonder is that it should not have\r\nbeen thought of before. My stupidity was abominable, for here we have\r\nall the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford; and it is so useful to\r\nhave anything of a model! We have cast almost every part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you do for women?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund gravely, and looking at\r\nMaria.\r\n\r\nMaria blushed in spite of herself as she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI take the part\r\nwhich Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and\xe2\x80\x9d (with a bolder eye) \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nCrawford is to be Amelia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled\r\nup, with _us_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Edmund, turning away to the fire, where sat his\r\nmother, aunt, and Fanny, and seating himself with a look of great\r\nvexation.\r\n\r\nMr. Rushworth followed him to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI come in three times, and have\r\ntwo-and-forty speeches. That\xe2\x80\x99s something, is not it? But I do not much\r\nlike the idea of being so fine. I shall hardly know myself in a blue\r\ndress and a pink satin cloak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund could not answer him. In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called\r\nout of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter; and being\r\naccompanied by Mr. Yates, and followed soon afterwards by Mr.\r\nRushworth, Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncannot, before Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play, without\r\nreflecting on his friends at Ecclesford; but I must now, my dear Maria,\r\ntell _you_, that I think it exceedingly unfit for private\r\nrepresentation, and that I hope you will give it up. I cannot but\r\nsuppose you _will_ when you have read it carefully over. Read only the\r\nfirst act aloud to either your mother or aunt, and see how you can\r\napprove it. It will not be necessary to send you to your _father\xe2\x80\x99s_\r\njudgment, I am convinced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe see things very differently,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Maria. \xe2\x80\x9cI am perfectly\r\nacquainted with the play, I assure you; and with a very few omissions,\r\nand so forth, which will be made, of course, I can see nothing\r\nobjectionable in it; and _I_ am not the _only_ young woman you find who\r\nthinks it very fit for private representation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for it,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut in this matter it is _you_\r\nwho are to lead. _You_ must set the example. If others have blundered,\r\nit is your place to put them right, and shew them what true delicacy\r\nis. In all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law to the rest of\r\nthe party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis picture of her consequence had some effect, for no one loved\r\nbetter to lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour she answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: but I\r\nstill think you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake\r\nto harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind. _There_ would be\r\nthe greatest indecorum, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head? No; let your\r\nconduct be the only harangue. Say that, on examining the part, you feel\r\nyourself unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion and\r\nconfidence than you can be supposed to have. Say this with firmness,\r\nand it will be quite enough. All who can distinguish will understand\r\nyour motive. The play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as\r\nit ought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not act anything improper, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Thomas\r\nwould not like it.\xe2\x80\x94Fanny, ring the bell; I must have my dinner.\xe2\x80\x94To be\r\nsure, Julia is dressed by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am convinced, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, preventing Fanny, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Sir\r\nThomas would not like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to decline the part,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria, with renewed zeal, \xe2\x80\x9cJulia\r\nwould certainly take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cif she knew your reasons!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! she might think the difference between us\xe2\x80\x94the difference in our\r\nsituations\xe2\x80\x94that _she_ need not be so scrupulous as _I_ might feel\r\nnecessary. I am sure she would argue so. No; you must excuse me; I\r\ncannot retract my consent; it is too far settled, everybody would be so\r\ndisappointed, Tom would be quite angry; and if we are so very nice, we\r\nshall never act anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to say the very same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Norris. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nevery play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and the\r\npreparations will be all so much money thrown away, and I am sure\r\n_that_ would be a discredit to us all. I do not know the play; but, as\r\nMaria says, if there is anything a little too warm (and it is so with\r\nmost of them) it can be easily left out. We must not be over-precise,\r\nEdmund. As Mr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm. I only\r\nwish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began, for there\r\nwas the loss of half a day\xe2\x80\x99s work about those side-doors. The curtain\r\nwill be a good job, however. The maids do their work very well, and I\r\nthink we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings. There is\r\nno occasion to put them so very close together. I _am_ of some use, I\r\nhope, in preventing waste and making the most of things. There should\r\nalways be one steady head to superintend so many young ones. I forgot\r\nto tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day. I had been\r\nlooking about me in the poultry-yard, and was just coming out, when who\r\nshould I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall-door with\r\ntwo bits of deal board in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be\r\nsure; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father, and then\r\nfather had bid him bring up them two bits of board, for he could not no\r\nhow do without them. I knew what all this meant, for the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndinner-bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads; and as I\r\nhate such encroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching, I have\r\nalways said so: just the sort of people to get all they can), I said to\r\nthe boy directly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know,\r\nwho ought to be ashamed of himself), \xe2\x80\x98_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ take the boards to your\r\nfather, Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can.\xe2\x80\x99 The boy looked\r\nvery silly, and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I\r\nmight speak pretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him of coming\r\nmarauding about the house for one while. I hate such greediness\xe2\x80\x94so good\r\nas your father is to the family, employing the man all the year round!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others soon returned; and\r\nEdmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his\r\nonly satisfaction.\r\n\r\nDinner passed heavily. Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick\r\nJackson, but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked\r\nof, for Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s disapprobation was felt even by his brother, though he\r\nwould not have owned it. Maria, wanting Henry Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s animating\r\nsupport, thought the subject better avoided. Mr. Yates, who was trying\r\nto make himself agreeable to Julia, found her gloom less impenetrable\r\non any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their\r\ncompany; and Mr. Rushworth, having only his own part and his own dress\r\nin his head, had soon talked away all that could be said of either.\r\n\r\nBut the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two:\r\nthere was still a great deal to be settled; and the spirits of evening\r\ngiving fresh courage, Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their being\r\nreassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at a\r\nseparate table, with the play open before them, and were just getting\r\ndeep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the\r\nentrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it\r\nwas, could not help coming, and were received with the most grateful\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how do you go on?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you settled?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOh! we can\r\ndo nothing without you,\xe2\x80\x9d followed the first salutations; and Henry\r\nCrawford was soon seated with the other three at the table, while his\r\nsister made her way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention was\r\ncomplimenting _her_. \xe2\x80\x9cI must really congratulate your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x9con the play being chosen; for though you have borne it with\r\nexemplary patience, I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and\r\ndifficulties. The actors may be glad, but the bystanders must be\r\ninfinitely more thankful for a decision; and I do sincerely give you\r\njoy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and everybody else who is in the\r\nsame predicament,\xe2\x80\x9d glancing half fearfully, half slyly, beyond Fanny to\r\nEdmund.\r\n\r\nShe was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram, but Edmund said nothing.\r\nHis being only a bystander was not disclaimed. After continuing in chat\r\nwith the party round the fire a few minutes, Miss Crawford returned to\r\nthe party round the table; and standing by them, seemed to interest\r\nherself in their arrangements till, as if struck by a sudden\r\nrecollection, she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cMy good friends, you are most composedly\r\nat work upon these cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let\r\nme know my fate in the meanwhile. Who is to be Anhalt? What gentleman\r\namong you am I to have the pleasure of making love to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together to tell the\r\nsame melancholy truth, that they had not yet got any Anhalt. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nRushworth was to be Count Cassel, but no one had yet undertaken\r\nAnhalt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had my choice of the parts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Rushworth; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I thought I\r\nshould like the Count best, though I do not much relish the finery I am\r\nto have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou chose very wisely, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Crawford, with a\r\nbrightened look; \xe2\x80\x9cAnhalt is a heavy part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The_ _Count_ has two-and-forty speeches,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Rushworth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhich is no trifle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, after a short pause,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cat this want of an Anhalt. Amelia deserves no better. Such a forward\r\nyoung lady may well frighten the men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be but too happy in taking the part, if it were possible,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncried Tom; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, unluckily, the Butler and Anhalt are in together. I\r\nwill not entirely give it up, however; I will try what can be done\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwill look it over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour _brother_ should take the part,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Yates, in a low voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not you think he would?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ shall not ask him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tom, in a cold, determined manner.\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford talked of something else, and soon afterwards rejoined\r\nthe party at the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do not want me at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, seating herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI only puzzle\r\nthem, and oblige them to make civil speeches. Mr. Edmund Bertram, as\r\nyou do not act yourself, you will be a disinterested adviser; and,\r\ntherefore, I apply to _you_. What shall we do for an Anhalt? Is it\r\npracticable for any of the others to double it? What is your advice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy advice,\xe2\x80\x9d said he calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cis that you change the play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ should have no objection,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cfor though I should not\r\nparticularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported, that is, if\r\neverything went well, I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience; but as\r\nthey do not chuse to hear your advice at _that_ _table_\xe2\x80\x9d (looking\r\nround), \xe2\x80\x9cit certainly will not be taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund said no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf _any_ part could tempt _you_ to act, I suppose it would be Anhalt,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved the lady archly, after a short pause; \xe2\x80\x9cfor he is a clergyman,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That_ circumstance would by no means tempt me,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\r\nshould be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting. It must\r\nbe very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal, solemn\r\nlecturer; and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps, one\r\nof the last who would wish to represent it on the stage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford was silenced, and with some feelings of resentment and\r\nmortification, moved her chair considerably nearer the tea-table, and\r\ngave all her attention to Mrs. Norris, who was presiding there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom Bertram, from the other table, where the conference\r\nwas eagerly carrying on, and the conversation incessant, \xe2\x80\x9cwe want your\r\nservices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was up in a moment, expecting some errand; for the habit of\r\nemploying her in that way was not yet overcome, in spite of all that\r\nEdmund could do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! we do not want to disturb you from your seat. We do not want your\r\n_present_ services. We shall only want you in our play. You must be\r\nCottager\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fanny, sitting down again with a most frightened look.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed you must excuse me. I could not act anything if you were to\r\ngive me the world. No, indeed, I cannot act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, but you must, for we cannot excuse you. It need not frighten\r\nyou: it is a nothing of a part, a mere nothing, not above half a dozen\r\nspeeches altogether, and it will not much signify if nobody hears a\r\nword you say; so you may be as creep-mouse as you like, but we must\r\nhave you to look at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are afraid of half a dozen speeches,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Rushworth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat would you do with such a part as mine? I have forty-two to\r\nlearn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not that I am afraid of learning by heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, shocked\r\nto find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room, and to\r\nfeel that almost every eye was upon her; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I really cannot act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, you can act well enough for _us_. Learn your part, and we\r\nwill teach you all the rest. You have only two scenes, and as I shall\r\nbe Cottager, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put you in and push you about, and you will do it\r\nvery well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, Mr. Bertram, you must excuse me. You cannot have an idea.\r\nIt would be absolutely impossible for me. If I were to undertake it, I\r\nshould only disappoint you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhoo! Phoo! Do not be so shamefaced. You\xe2\x80\x99ll do it very well. Every\r\nallowance will be made for you. We do not expect perfection. You must\r\nget a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make\r\nyou a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your\r\neyes, and you will be a very proper, little old woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fanny, growing\r\nmore and more red from excessive agitation, and looking distressfully\r\nat Edmund, who was kindly observing her; but unwilling to exasperate\r\nhis brother by interference, gave her only an encouraging smile. Her\r\nentreaty had no effect on Tom: he only said again what he had said\r\nbefore; and it was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed\r\nby Maria, and Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which\r\ndiffered from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious, and\r\nwhich altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny; and before she could\r\nbreathe after it, Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing\r\nher in a whisper at once angry and audible\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a piece of work here\r\nis about nothing: I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a\r\ndifficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort\xe2\x80\x94so kind as\r\nthey are to you! Take the part with a good grace, and let us hear no\r\nmore of the matter, I entreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not urge her, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not fair to urge her in\r\nthis manner. You see she does not like to act. Let her chuse for\r\nherself, as well as the rest of us. Her judgment may be quite as safely\r\ntrusted. Do not urge her any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to urge her,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Norris sharply; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shall\r\nthink her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she does not do what\r\nher aunt and cousins wish her\xe2\x80\x94very ungrateful, indeed, considering who\r\nand what she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a moment\r\nwith astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny, whose tears\r\nwere beginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some\r\nkeenness, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not like my situation: this _place_ is too hot for me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to\r\nFanny, saying to her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, my dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening: everybody is\r\ncross and teasing, but do not let us mind them\xe2\x80\x9d; and with pointed\r\nattention continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits,\r\nin spite of being out of spirits herself. By a look at her brother she\r\nprevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board, and the\r\nreally good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were\r\nrapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nFanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she felt very much obliged to her\r\nfor her present kindness; and when, from taking notice of her work, and\r\nwishing _she_ could work as well, and begging for the pattern, and\r\nsupposing Fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_, as of course\r\nshe would come out when her cousin was married, Miss Crawford proceeded\r\nto inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea, and said\r\nthat she had quite a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine\r\nyoung man, and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to\r\nsea again\xe2\x80\x94she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable\r\nflattery, or help listening, and answering with more animation than she\r\nhad intended.\r\n\r\nThe consultation upon the play still went on, and Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s telling her,\r\nwith infinite regret, that he found it absolutely impossible for him to\r\nundertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler: he had been\r\nmost anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible, but it would not\r\ndo; he must give it up. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there will not be the smallest difficulty\r\nin filling it,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have but to speak the word; we may pick\r\nand chuse. I could name, at this moment, at least six young men within\r\nsix miles of us, who are wild to be admitted into our company, and\r\nthere are one or two that would not disgrace us: I should not be afraid\r\nto trust either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox. Tom Oliver is a very\r\nclever fellow, and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will\r\nsee anywhere, so I will take my horse early to-morrow morning and ride\r\nover to Stoke, and settle with one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in\r\nfull expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as\r\nthis: so contrary to all their first protestations; but Edmund said\r\nnothing. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought, Miss Crawford calmly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\nfar as I am concerned, I can have no objection to anything that you all\r\nthink eligible. Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen? Yes, Mr.\r\nCharles Maddox dined at my sister\xe2\x80\x99s one day, did not he, Henry? A\r\nquiet-looking young man. I remember him. Let _him_ be applied to, if\r\nyou please, for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect\r\nstranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharles Maddox was to be the man. Tom repeated his resolution of going\r\nto him early on the morrow; and though Julia, who had scarcely opened\r\nher lips before, observed, in a sarcastic manner, and with a glance\r\nfirst at Maria and then at Edmund, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Mansfield theatricals\r\nwould enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly,\xe2\x80\x9d Edmund still held\r\nhis peace, and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not very sanguine as to our play,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, in an\r\nundervoice to Fanny, after some consideration; \xe2\x80\x9cand I can tell Mr.\r\nMaddox that I shall shorten some of _his_ speeches, and a great many of\r\n_my_ _own_, before we rehearse together. It will be very disagreeable,\r\nand by no means what I expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not in Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s power to talk Fanny into any real\r\nforgetfulness of what had passed. When the evening was over, she went\r\nto bed full of it, her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an\r\nattack from her cousin Tom, so public and so persevered in, and her\r\nspirits sinking under her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s unkind reflection and reproach. To be\r\ncalled into notice in such a manner, to hear that it was but the\r\nprelude to something so infinitely worse, to be told that she must do\r\nwhat was so impossible as to act; and then to have the charge of\r\nobstinacy and ingratitude follow it, enforced with such a hint at the\r\ndependence of her situation, had been too distressing at the time to\r\nmake the remembrance when she was alone much less so, especially with\r\nthe superadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation\r\nof the subject. Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time; and\r\nif she were applied to again among themselves with all the\r\nauthoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and Edmund\r\nperhaps away, what should she do? She fell asleep before she could\r\nanswer the question, and found it quite as puzzling when she awoke the\r\nnext morning. The little white attic, which had continued her\r\nsleeping-room ever since her first entering the family, proving\r\nincompetent to suggest any reply, she had recourse, as soon as she was\r\ndressed, to another apartment more spacious and more meet for walking\r\nabout in and thinking, and of which she had now for some time been\r\nalmost equally mistress. It had been their school-room; so called till\r\nthe Miss Bertrams would not allow it to be called so any longer, and\r\ninhabited as such to a later period. There Miss Lee had lived, and\r\nthere they had read and written, and talked and laughed, till within\r\nthe last three years, when she had quitted them. The room had then\r\nbecome useless, and for some time was quite deserted, except by Fanny,\r\nwhen she visited her plants, or wanted one of the books, which she was\r\nstill glad to keep there, from the deficiency of space and\r\naccommodation in her little chamber above: but gradually, as her value\r\nfor the comforts of it increased, she had added to her possessions, and\r\nspent more of her time there; and having nothing to oppose her, had so\r\nnaturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that it was now\r\ngenerally admitted to be hers. The East room, as it had been called\r\never since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nalmost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the one making\r\nthe use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams,\r\nwith every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of\r\nsuperiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs. Norris,\r\nhaving stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount, was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody\r\nelse wanted, though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the\r\nindulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house.\r\n\r\nThe aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable\r\nin many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind\r\nas Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be\r\ndriven from it entirely, even when winter came. The comfort of it in\r\nher hours of leisure was extreme. She could go there after anything\r\nunpleasant below, and find immediate consolation in some pursuit, or\r\nsome train of thought at hand. Her plants, her books\xe2\x80\x94of which she had\r\nbeen a collector from the first hour of her commanding a shilling\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nwriting-desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity, were all within\r\nher reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would\r\ndo, she could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an\r\ninteresting remembrance connected with it. Everything was a friend, or\r\nbore her thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much\r\nof suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood,\r\nher feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though she\r\nhad known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost\r\nevery recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt\r\nBertram had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what\r\nwas yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and\r\nher friend: he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had\r\ntold her not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which\r\nmade her tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together,\r\nso harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.\r\nThe room was most dear to her, and she would not have changed its\r\nfurniture for the handsomest in the house, though what had been\r\noriginally plain had suffered all the ill-usage of children; and its\r\ngreatest elegancies and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, too ill done for the drawing-room, three transparencies, made in\r\na rage for transparencies, for the three lower panes of one window,\r\nwhere Tintern Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a\r\nmoonlight lake in Cumberland, a collection of family profiles, thought\r\nunworthy of being anywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their\r\nside, and pinned against the wall, a small sketch of a ship sent four\r\nyears ago from the Mediterranean by William, with H.M.S. Antwerp at the\r\nbottom, in letters as tall as the mainmast.\r\n\r\nTo this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence on\r\nan agitated, doubting spirit, to see if by looking at Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s profile\r\nshe could catch any of his counsel, or by giving air to her geraniums\r\nshe might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself. But she had more\r\nthan fears of her own perseverance to remove: she had begun to feel\r\nundecided as to what she _ought_ _to_ _do_; and as she walked round the\r\nroom her doubts were increasing. Was she _right_ in refusing what was\r\nso warmly asked, so strongly wished for\xe2\x80\x94what might be so essential to a\r\nscheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest\r\ncomplaisance had set their hearts? Was it not ill-nature, selfishness,\r\nand a fear of exposing herself? And would Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, would his\r\npersuasion of Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s disapprobation of the whole, be enough to\r\njustify her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest? It would\r\nbe so horrible to her to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth\r\nand purity of her own scruples; and as she looked around her, the\r\nclaims of her cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the sight\r\nof present upon present that she had received from them. The table\r\nbetween the windows was covered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which\r\nhad been given her at different times, principally by Tom; and she grew\r\nbewildered as to the amount of the debt which all these kind\r\nremembrances produced. A tap at the door roused her in the midst of\r\nthis attempt to find her way to her duty, and her gentle \xe2\x80\x9cCome in\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nanswered by the appearance of one, before whom all her doubts were wont\r\nto be laid. Her eyes brightened at the sight of Edmund.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I speak with you, Fanny, for a few minutes?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to consult. I want your opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, shrinking from such a compliment, highly as it\r\ngratified her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your advice and opinion. I do not know what to do. This acting\r\nscheme gets worse and worse, you see. They have chosen almost as bad a\r\nplay as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to ask\r\nthe help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. This is the\r\nend of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first. I\r\nknow no harm of Charles Maddox; but the excessive intimacy which must\r\nspring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly\r\nobjectionable, the _more_ than intimacy\xe2\x80\x94the familiarity. I cannot think\r\nof it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of such\r\nmagnitude as must, _if_ _possible_, be prevented. Do not you see it in\r\nthe same light?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but what can be done? Your brother is so determined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is but _one_ thing to be done, Fanny. I must take Anhalt myself.\r\nI am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny could not answer him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not at all what I like,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cNo man can like being\r\ndriven into the _appearance_ of such inconsistency. After being known\r\nto oppose the scheme from the beginning, there is absurdity in the face\r\nof my joining them _now_, when they are exceeding their first plan in\r\nevery respect; but I can think of no other alternative. Can you,\r\nFanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cnot immediately, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what? I see your judgment is not with me. Think it a little over.\r\nPerhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that _may_,\r\nof the unpleasantness that _must_ arise from a young man\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\nreceived in this manner: domesticated among us; authorised to come at\r\nall hours, and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all\r\nrestraints. To think only of the licence which every rehearsal must\r\ntend to create. It is all very bad! Put yourself in Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace, Fanny. Consider what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger.\r\nShe has a right to be felt for, because she evidently feels for\r\nherself. I heard enough of what she said to you last night to\r\nunderstand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger; and as she\r\nprobably engaged in the part with different expectations\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\r\nwithout considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwould be ungenerous, it would be really wrong to expose her to it. Her\r\nfeelings ought to be respected. Does it not strike you so, Fanny? You\r\nhesitate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in\r\nto do what you had resolved against, and what you are known to think\r\nwill be disagreeable to my uncle. It will be such a triumph to the\r\nothers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously\r\nI act. But, however, triumph there certainly will be, and I must brave\r\nit. But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the\r\nbusiness, of limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I\r\nshall be well repaid. As I am now, I have no influence, I can do\r\nnothing: I have offended them, and they will not hear me; but when I\r\nhave put them in good-humour by this concession, I am not without hopes\r\nof persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller\r\ncircle than they are now in the high road for. This will be a material\r\ngain. My object is to confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants. Will\r\nnot this be worth gaining?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it will be a great point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still it has not your approbation. Can you mention any other\r\nmeasure by which I have a chance of doing equal good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I cannot think of anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your approbation, then, Fanny. I am not comfortable without\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, cousin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are against me, I ought to distrust myself, and yet\xe2\x80\x94But it is\r\nabsolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way, riding about the\r\ncountry in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act\xe2\x80\x94no matter whom:\r\nthe look of a gentleman is to be enough. I thought _you_ would have\r\nentered more into Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt she will be very glad. It must be a great relief to her,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Fanny, trying for greater warmth of manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last\r\nnight. It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe _was_ very kind, indeed, and I am glad to have her spared\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nShe could not finish the generous effusion. Her conscience stopt her in\r\nthe middle, but Edmund was satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall walk down immediately after breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand am sure\r\nof giving pleasure there. And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt you\r\nany longer. You want to be reading. But I could not be easy till I had\r\nspoken to you, and come to a decision. Sleeping or waking, my head has\r\nbeen full of this matter all night. It is an evil, but I am certainly\r\nmaking it less than it might be. If Tom is up, I shall go to him\r\ndirectly and get it over, and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all\r\nin high good-humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with\r\nsuch unanimity. _You_, in the meanwhile, will be taking a trip into\r\nChina, I suppose. How does Lord Macartney go on?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94opening a volume on\r\nthe table and then taking up some others. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here are Crabbe\xe2\x80\x99s Tales,\r\nand the Idler, at hand to relieve you, if you tire of your great book.\r\nI admire your little establishment exceedingly; and as soon as I am\r\ngone, you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting, and sit\r\ncomfortably down to your table. But do not stay here to be cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went; but there was no reading, no China, no composure for Fanny. He\r\nhad told her the most extraordinary, the most inconceivable, the most\r\nunwelcome news; and she could think of nothing else. To be acting!\r\nAfter all his objections\xe2\x80\x94objections so just and so public! After all\r\nthat she had heard him say, and seen him look, and known him to be\r\nfeeling. Could it be possible? Edmund so inconsistent! Was he not\r\ndeceiving himself? Was he not wrong? Alas! it was all Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoing. She had seen her influence in every speech, and was miserable.\r\nThe doubts and alarms as to her own conduct, which had previously\r\ndistressed her, and which had all slept while she listened to him, were\r\nbecome of little consequence now. This deeper anxiety swallowed them\r\nup. Things should take their course; she cared not how it ended. Her\r\ncousins might attack, but could hardly tease her. She was beyond their\r\nreach; and if at last obliged to yield\xe2\x80\x94no matter\xe2\x80\x94it was all misery now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria. Such a\r\nvictory over Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was\r\nmost delightful. There was no longer anything to disturb them in their\r\ndarling project, and they congratulated each other in private on the\r\njealous weakness to which they attributed the change, with all the glee\r\nof feelings gratified in every way. Edmund might still look grave, and\r\nsay he did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play\r\nin particular; their point was gained: he was to act, and he was driven\r\nto it by the force of selfish inclinations only. Edmund had descended\r\nfrom that moral elevation which he had maintained before, and they were\r\nboth as much the better as the happier for the descent.\r\n\r\nThey behaved very well, however, to _him_ on the occasion, betraying no\r\nexultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth, and seemed\r\nto think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles\r\nMaddox, as if they had been forced into admitting him against their\r\ninclination. \xe2\x80\x9cTo have it quite in their own family circle was what they\r\nhad particularly wished. A stranger among them would have been the\r\ndestruction of all their comfort\xe2\x80\x9d; and when Edmund, pursuing that idea,\r\ngave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were\r\nready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything. It was\r\nall good-humour and encouragement. Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his\r\ndress, Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt\xe2\x80\x99s last scene with the Baron\r\nadmitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth\r\nundertook to count his speeches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, \xe2\x80\x9cFanny may be more disposed to oblige us now.\r\nPerhaps you may persuade _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she is quite determined. She certainly will not act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! very well.\xe2\x80\x9d And not another word was said; but Fanny felt herself\r\nagain in danger, and her indifference to the danger was beginning to\r\nfail her already.\r\n\r\nThere were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this\r\nchange in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers, and entered\r\nwith such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole\r\naffair as could have but one effect on him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was certainly right in\r\nrespecting such feelings; he was glad he had determined on it.\xe2\x80\x9d And the\r\nmorning wore away in satisfactions very sweet, if not very sound. One\r\nadvantage resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss\r\nCrawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed to\r\nundertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all\r\nthat occurred to gladden _her_ heart during the day; and even this,\r\nwhen imparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss\r\nCrawford to whom she was obliged\xe2\x80\x94it was Miss Crawford whose kind\r\nexertions were to excite her gratitude, and whose merit in making them\r\nwas spoken of with a glow of admiration. She was safe; but peace and\r\nsafety were unconnected here. Her mind had been never farther from\r\npeace. She could not feel that she had done wrong herself, but she was\r\ndisquieted in every other way. Her heart and her judgment were equally\r\nagainst Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s decision: she could not acquit his unsteadiness, and\r\nhis happiness under it made her wretched. She was full of jealousy and\r\nagitation. Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed an\r\ninsult, with friendly expressions towards herself which she could\r\nhardly answer calmly. Everybody around her was gay and busy, prosperous\r\nand important; each had their object of interest, their part, their\r\ndress, their favourite scene, their friends and confederates: all were\r\nfinding employment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in\r\nthe playful conceits they suggested. She alone was sad and\r\ninsignificant: she had no share in anything; she might go or stay; she\r\nmight be in the midst of their noise, or retreat from it to the\r\nsolitude of the East room, without being seen or missed. She could\r\nalmost think anything would have been preferable to this. Mrs. Grant\r\nwas of consequence: _her_ good-nature had honourable mention; her taste\r\nand her time were considered; her presence was wanted; she was sought\r\nfor, and attended, and praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger\r\nof envying her the character she had accepted. But reflection brought\r\nbetter feelings, and shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to\r\nrespect, which could never have belonged to _her_; and that, had she\r\nreceived even the greatest, she could never have been easy in joining a\r\nscheme which, considering only her uncle, she must condemn altogether.\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them, as\r\nshe soon began to acknowledge to herself. Julia was a sufferer too,\r\nthough not quite so blamelessly.\r\n\r\nHenry Crawford had trifled with her feelings; but she had very long\r\nallowed and even sought his attentions, with a jealousy of her sister\r\nso reasonable as ought to have been their cure; and now that the\r\nconviction of his preference for Maria had been forced on her, she\r\nsubmitted to it without any alarm for Maria\xe2\x80\x99s situation, or any\r\nendeavour at rational tranquillity for herself. She either sat in\r\ngloomy silence, wrapt in such gravity as nothing could subdue, no\r\ncuriosity touch, no wit amuse; or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates,\r\nwas talking with forced gaiety to him alone, and ridiculing the acting\r\nof the others.\r\n\r\nFor a day or two after the affront was given, Henry Crawford had\r\nendeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and\r\ncompliment, but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a\r\nfew repulses; and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for\r\nmore than one flirtation, he grew indifferent to the quarrel, or rather\r\nthought it a lucky occurrence, as quietly putting an end to what might\r\nere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant. She was not\r\npleased to see Julia excluded from the play, and sitting by\r\ndisregarded; but as it was not a matter which really involved her\r\nhappiness, as Henry must be the best judge of his own, and as he did\r\nassure her, with a most persuasive smile, that neither he nor Julia had\r\never had a serious thought of each other, she could only renew her\r\nformer caution as to the elder sister, entreat him not to risk his\r\ntranquillity by too much admiration there, and then gladly take her\r\nshare in anything that brought cheerfulness to the young people in\r\ngeneral, and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two\r\nso dear to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d was her observation\r\nto Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say she is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mary coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cI imagine both sisters are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth! no, no, that must not be. Do not give him a hint of it. Think of\r\nMr. Rushworth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth. It may do\r\n_her_ some good. I often think of Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s property and\r\nindependence, and wish them in other hands; but I never think of him. A\r\nman might represent the county with such an estate; a man might escape\r\na profession and represent the county.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say he _will_ be in parliament soon. When Sir Thomas comes, I\r\ndare say he will be in for some borough, but there has been nobody to\r\nput him in the way of doing anything yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMary, after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember Hawkins Browne\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Address to\r\nTobacco,\xe2\x80\x99 in imitation of Pope?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nBlest leaf! whose aromatic gales dispense\r\nTo Templars modesty, to Parsons sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will parody them\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nBlest Knight! whose dictatorial looks dispense\r\nTo Children affluence, to Rushworth sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill not that do, Mrs. Grant? Everything seems to depend upon Sir\r\nThomas\xe2\x80\x99s return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see\r\nhim in his family, I assure you. I do not think we do so well without\r\nhim. He has a fine dignified manner, which suits the head of such a\r\nhouse, and keeps everybody in their place. Lady Bertram seems more of a\r\ncipher now than when he is at home; and nobody else can keep Mrs.\r\nNorris in order. But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for\r\nHenry. I am sure _Julia_ does not, or she would not have flirted as she\r\ndid last night with Mr. Yates; and though he and Maria are very good\r\nfriends, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not give much for Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s chance if Henry stept in\r\nbefore the articles were signed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have such a suspicion, something must be done; and as soon as\r\nthe play is all over, we will talk to him seriously and make him know\r\nhis own mind; and if he means nothing, we will send him off, though he\r\nis Henry, for a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulia _did_ suffer, however, though Mrs. Grant discerned it not, and\r\nthough it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise. She\r\nhad loved, she did love still, and she had all the suffering which a\r\nwarm temper and a high spirit were likely to endure under the\r\ndisappointment of a dear, though irrational hope, with a strong sense\r\nof ill-usage. Her heart was sore and angry, and she was capable only of\r\nangry consolations. The sister with whom she was used to be on easy\r\nterms was now become her greatest enemy: they were alienated from each\r\nother; and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end\r\nto the attentions which were still carrying on there, some punishment\r\nto Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr.\r\nRushworth. With no material fault of temper, or difference of opinion,\r\nto prevent their being very good friends while their interests were the\r\nsame, the sisters, under such a trial as this, had not affection or\r\nprinciple enough to make them merciful or just, to give them honour or\r\ncompassion. Maria felt her triumph, and pursued her purpose, careless\r\nof Julia; and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry\r\nCrawford without trusting that it would create jealousy, and bring a\r\npublic disturbance at last.\r\n\r\nFanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia; but there was no outward\r\nfellowship between them. Julia made no communication, and Fanny took no\r\nliberties. They were two solitary sufferers, or connected only by\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to Julia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscomposure, and their blindness to its true cause, must be imputed to\r\nthe fullness of their own minds. They were totally preoccupied. Tom was\r\nengrossed by the concerns of his theatre, and saw nothing that did not\r\nimmediately relate to it. Edmund, between his theatrical and his real\r\npart, between Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s claims and his own conduct, between love\r\nand consistency, was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy\r\nin contriving and directing the general little matters of the company,\r\nsuperintending their various dresses with economical expedient, for\r\nwhich nobody thanked her, and saving, with delighted integrity, half a\r\ncrown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for\r\nwatching the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything was now in a regular train: theatre, actors, actresses, and\r\ndresses, were all getting forward; but though no other great\r\nimpediments arose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was\r\nnot all uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she\r\nhad not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had\r\nbeen almost too much for her at first. Everybody began to have their\r\nvexation. Edmund had many. Entirely against _his_ judgment, a\r\nscene-painter arrived from town, and was at work, much to the increase\r\nof the expenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of their\r\nproceedings; and his brother, instead of being really guided by him as\r\nto the privacy of the representation, was giving an invitation to every\r\nfamily who came in his way. Tom himself began to fret over the\r\nscene-painter\xe2\x80\x99s slow progress, and to feel the miseries of waiting. He\r\nhad learned his part\xe2\x80\x94all his parts, for he took every trifling one that\r\ncould be united with the Butler, and began to be impatient to be\r\nacting; and every day thus unemployed was tending to increase his sense\r\nof the insignificance of all his parts together, and make him more\r\nready to regret that some other play had not been chosen.\r\n\r\nFanny, being always a very courteous listener, and often the only\r\nlistener at hand, came in for the complaints and the distresses of most\r\nof them. _She_ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant\r\ndreadfully; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford; that Tom\r\nBertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible; that Mrs. Grant\r\nspoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with his\r\npart, and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth,\r\nwho was wanting a prompter through every speech. She knew, also, that\r\npoor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him: _his_\r\ncomplaint came before her as well as the rest; and so decided to her\r\neye was her cousin Maria\xe2\x80\x99s avoidance of him, and so needlessly often\r\nthe rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she\r\nhad soon all the terror of other complaints from _him_. So far from\r\nbeing all satisfied and all enjoying, she found everybody requiring\r\nsomething they had not, and giving occasion of discontent to the\r\nothers. Everybody had a part either too long or too short; nobody would\r\nattend as they ought; nobody would remember on which side they were to\r\ncome in; nobody but the complainer would observe any directions.\r\n\r\nFanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the\r\nplay as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well, and it was a pleasure\r\nto _her_ to creep into the theatre, and attend the rehearsal of the\r\nfirst act, in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for\r\nMaria. Maria, she also thought, acted well, too well; and after the\r\nfirst rehearsal or two, Fanny began to be their only audience; and\r\nsometimes as prompter, sometimes as spectator, was often very useful.\r\nAs far as she could judge, Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor\r\nof all: he had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom,\r\nmore talent and taste than Mr. Yates. She did not like him as a man,\r\nbut she must admit him to be the best actor, and on this point there\r\nwere not many who differed from her. Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed\r\nagainst his tameness and insipidity; and the day came at last, when Mr.\r\nRushworth turned to her with a black look, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think\r\nthere is anything so very fine in all this? For the life and soul of\r\nme, I cannot admire him; and, between ourselves, to see such an\r\nundersized, little, mean-looking man, set up for a fine actor, is very\r\nridiculous in my opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom this moment there was a return of his former jealousy, which\r\nMaria, from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains to\r\nremove; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s ever attaining to the\r\nknowledge of his two-and-forty speeches became much less. As to his\r\never making anything _tolerable_ of them, nobody had the smallest idea\r\nof that except his mother; _she_, indeed, regretted that his part was\r\nnot more considerable, and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they\r\nwere forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes;\r\nbut the others aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword,\r\nand the first line of his speech, and being able to follow the prompter\r\nthrough the rest. Fanny, in her pity and kindheartedness, was at great\r\npains to teach him how to learn, giving him all the helps and\r\ndirections in her power, trying to make an artificial memory for him,\r\nand learning every word of his part herself, but without his being much\r\nthe forwarder.\r\n\r\nMany uncomfortable, anxious, apprehensive feelings she certainly had;\r\nbut with all these, and other claims on her time and attention, she was\r\nas far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them,\r\nas without a companion in uneasiness; quite as far from having no\r\ndemand on her leisure as on her compassion. The gloom of her first\r\nanticipations was proved to have been unfounded. She was occasionally\r\nuseful to all; she was perhaps as much at peace as any.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of needlework to be done, moreover, in which her\r\nhelp was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris thought her quite as well off as\r\nthe rest, was evident by the manner in which she claimed it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nFanny,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are fine times for you, but you must not be\r\nalways walking from one room to the other, and doing the lookings-on at\r\nyour ease, in this way; I want you here. I have been slaving myself\r\ntill I can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s cloak without\r\nsending for any more satin; and now I think you may give me your help\r\nin putting it together. There are but three seams; you may do them in a\r\ntrice. It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part\r\nto do. _You_ are best off, I can tell you: but if nobody did more than\r\n_you_, we should not get on very fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny took the work very quietly, without attempting any defence; but\r\nher kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny _should_ be delighted: it is all\r\nnew to her, you know; you and I used to be very fond of a play\r\nourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a little more at\r\nleisure, _I_ mean to look in at their rehearsals too. What is the play\r\nabout, Fanny? you have never told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not one of those who\r\ncan talk and work at the same time. It is about Lovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be three acts\r\nrehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of\r\nseeing all the actors at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better stay till the curtain is hung,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mrs. Norris;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe curtain will be hung in a day or two\xe2\x80\x94there is very little sense in\r\na play without a curtain\xe2\x80\x94and I am much mistaken if you do not find it\r\ndraw up into very handsome festoons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting. Fanny did not share her\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s composure: she thought of the morrow a great deal, for if the\r\nthree acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be\r\nacting together for the first time; the third act would bring a scene\r\nbetween them which interested her most particularly, and which she was\r\nlonging and dreading to see how they would perform. The whole subject\r\nof it was love\xe2\x80\x94a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman,\r\nand very little short of a declaration of love be made by the lady.\r\n\r\nShe had read and read the scene again with many painful, many wondering\r\nemotions, and looked forward to their representation of it as a\r\ncircumstance almost too interesting. She did not _believe_ they had yet\r\nrehearsed it, even in private.\r\n\r\nThe morrow came, the plan for the evening continued, and Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsideration of it did not become less agitated. She worked very\r\ndiligently under her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s directions, but her diligence and her\r\nsilence concealed a very absent, anxious mind; and about noon she made\r\nher escape with her work to the East room, that she might have no\r\nconcern in another, and, as she deemed it, most unnecessary rehearsal\r\nof the first act, which Henry Crawford was just proposing, desirous at\r\nonce of having her time to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr.\r\nRushworth. A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two ladies\r\nwalking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat,\r\nand she worked and meditated in the East room, undisturbed, for a\r\nquarter of an hour, when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the\r\nentrance of Miss Crawford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I right? Yes; this is the East room. My dear Miss Price, I beg your\r\npardon, but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny, quite surprised, endeavoured to shew herself mistress of the\r\nroom by her civilities, and looked at the bright bars of her empty\r\ngrate with concern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you; I am quite warm, very warm. Allow me to stay here a little\r\nwhile, and do have the goodness to hear me my third act. I have brought\r\nmy book, and if you would but rehearse it with me, I should be _so_\r\nobliged! I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund\xe2\x80\x94by\r\nourselves\xe2\x80\x94against the evening, but he is not in the way; and if he\r\n_were_, I do not think I could go through it with _him_, till I have\r\nhardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two. You will\r\nbe so good, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was most civil in her assurances, though she could not give them\r\nin a very steady voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever happened to look at the part I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Miss\r\nCrawford, opening her book. \xe2\x80\x9cHere it is. I did not think much of it at\r\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94but, upon my word. There, look at _that_ speech, and _that_, and\r\n_that_. How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things?\r\nCould you do it? But then he is your cousin, which makes all the\r\ndifference. You must rehearse it with me, that I may fancy _you_ him,\r\nand get on by degrees. You _have_ a look of _his_ sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I? I will do my best with the greatest readiness; but I must\r\n_read_ the part, for I can say very little of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_None_ of it, I suppose. You are to have the book, of course. Now for\r\nit. We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the\r\nfront of the stage. There\xe2\x80\x94very good school-room chairs, not made for a\r\ntheatre, I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick\r\ntheir feet against when they are learning a lesson. What would your\r\ngoverness and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose? Could\r\nSir Thomas look in upon us just now, he would bless himself, for we are\r\nrehearsing all over the house. Yates is storming away in the\r\ndining-room. I heard him as I came upstairs, and the theatre is engaged\r\nof course by those indefatigable rehearsers, Agatha and Frederick. If\r\n_they_ are not perfect, I _shall_ be surprised. By the bye, I looked in\r\nupon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the\r\ntimes when they were trying _not_ to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was\r\nwith me. I thought he began to look a little queer, so I turned it off\r\nas well as I could, by whispering to him, \xe2\x80\x98We shall have an excellent\r\nAgatha; there is something so _maternal_ in her manner, so completely\r\n_maternal_ in her voice and countenance.\xe2\x80\x99 Was not that well done of me?\r\nHe brightened up directly. Now for my soliloquy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the\r\nidea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire; but\r\nwith looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of\r\na man. With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough;\r\nand they had got through half the scene, when a tap at the door brought\r\na pause, and the entrance of Edmund, the next moment, suspended it all.\r\n\r\nSurprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each of the three on\r\nthis unexpected meeting; and as Edmund was come on the very same\r\nbusiness that had brought Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure\r\nwere likely to be more than momentary in _them_. He too had his book,\r\nand was seeking Fanny, to ask her to rehearse with him, and help him to\r\nprepare for the evening, without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the\r\nhouse; and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown\r\ntogether, of comparing schemes, and sympathising in praise of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkind offices.\r\n\r\n_She_ could not equal them in their warmth. _Her_ spirits sank under\r\nthe glow of theirs, and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to\r\nboth to have any comfort in having been sought by either. They must now\r\nrehearse together. Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady,\r\nnot very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and Fanny was\r\nwanted only to prompt and observe them. She was invested, indeed, with\r\nthe office of judge and critic, and earnestly desired to exercise it\r\nand tell them all their faults; but from doing so every feeling within\r\nher shrank\xe2\x80\x94she could not, would not, dared not attempt it: had she been\r\notherwise qualified for criticism, her conscience must have restrained\r\nher from venturing at disapprobation. She believed herself to feel too\r\nmuch of it in the aggregate for honesty or safety in particulars. To\r\nprompt them must be enough for her; and it was sometimes _more_ than\r\nenough; for she could not always pay attention to the book. In watching\r\nthem she forgot herself; and, agitated by the increasing spirit of\r\nEdmund\xe2\x80\x99s manner, had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he\r\nwanted help. It was imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she was\r\nthanked and pitied; but she deserved their pity more than she hoped\r\nthey would ever surmise. At last the scene was over, and Fanny forced\r\nherself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other;\r\nand when again alone and able to recall the whole, she was inclined to\r\nbelieve their performance would, indeed, have such nature and feeling\r\nin it as must ensure their credit, and make it a very suffering\r\nexhibition to herself. Whatever might be its effect, however, she must\r\nstand the brunt of it again that very day.\r\n\r\nThe first regular rehearsal of the three first acts was certainly to\r\ntake place in the evening: Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords were engaged to\r\nreturn for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner; and every\r\none concerned was looking forward with eagerness. There seemed a\r\ngeneral diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion. Tom was enjoying\r\nsuch an advance towards the end; Edmund was in spirits from the\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x99s rehearsal, and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed\r\naway. All were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the\r\ngentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram,\r\nMrs. Norris, and Julia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour;\r\nand having lighted it up as well as its unfinished state admitted, were\r\nwaiting only the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.\r\n\r\nThey did not wait long for the Crawfords, but there was no Mrs. Grant.\r\nShe could not come. Dr. Grant, professing an indisposition, for which\r\nhe had little credit with his fair sister-in-law, could not spare his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Grant is ill,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with mock solemnity. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been ill\r\never since he did not eat any of the pheasant today. He fancied it\r\ntough, sent away his plate, and has been suffering ever since\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nHere was disappointment! Mrs. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s non-attendance was sad indeed.\r\nHer pleasant manners and cheerful conformity made her always valuable\r\namongst them; but _now_ she was absolutely necessary. They could not\r\nact, they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her. The\r\ncomfort of the whole evening was destroyed. What was to be done? Tom,\r\nas Cottager, was in despair. After a pause of perplexity, some eyes\r\nbegan to be turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIf Miss\r\nPrice would be so good as to _read_ the part.\xe2\x80\x9d She was immediately\r\nsurrounded by supplications; everybody asked it; even Edmund said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo,\r\nFanny, if it is not _very_ disagreeable to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Fanny still hung back. She could not endure the idea of it. Why was\r\nnot Miss Crawford to be applied to as well? Or why had not she rather\r\ngone to her own room, as she had felt to be safest, instead of\r\nattending the rehearsal at all? She had known it would irritate and\r\ndistress her; she had known it her duty to keep away. She was properly\r\npunished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have only to _read_ the part,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Crawford, with renewed\r\nentreaty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I do believe she can say every word of it,\xe2\x80\x9d added Maria, \xe2\x80\x9cfor she\r\ncould put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places. Fanny, I am\r\nsure you know the part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny could not say she did _not_; and as they all persevered, as\r\nEdmund repeated his wish, and with a look of even fond dependence on\r\nher good-nature, she must yield. She would do her best. Everybody was\r\nsatisfied; and she was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart,\r\nwhile the others prepared to begin.\r\n\r\nThey _did_ begin; and being too much engaged in their own noise to be\r\nstruck by an unusual noise in the other part of the house, had\r\nproceeded some way when the door of the room was thrown open, and\r\nJulia, appearing at it, with a face all aghast, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cMy father\r\nis come! He is in the hall at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the consternation of the party to be described? To the greater\r\nnumber it was a moment of absolute horror. Sir Thomas in the house! All\r\nfelt the instantaneous conviction. Not a hope of imposition or mistake\r\nwas harboured anywhere. Julia\xe2\x80\x99s looks were an evidence of the fact that\r\nmade it indisputable; and after the first starts and exclamations, not\r\na word was spoken for half a minute: each with an altered countenance\r\nwas looking at some other, and almost each was feeling it a stroke the\r\nmost unwelcome, most ill-timed, most appalling! Mr. Yates might\r\nconsider it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening, and Mr.\r\nRushworth might imagine it a blessing; but every other heart was\r\nsinking under some degree of self-condemnation or undefined alarm,\r\nevery other heart was suggesting, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will become of us? what is to\r\nbe done now?\xe2\x80\x9d It was a terrible pause; and terrible to every ear were\r\nthe corroborating sounds of opening doors and passing footsteps.\r\n\r\nJulia was the first to move and speak again. Jealousy and bitterness\r\nhad been suspended: selfishness was lost in the common cause; but at\r\nthe moment of her appearance, Frederick was listening with looks of\r\ndevotion to Agatha\xe2\x80\x99s narrative, and pressing her hand to his heart; and\r\nas soon as she could notice this, and see that, in spite of the shock\r\nof her words, he still kept his station and retained her sister\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nher wounded heart swelled again with injury, and looking as red as she\r\nhad been white before, she turned out of the room, saying, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ need\r\nnot be afraid of appearing before him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer going roused the rest; and at the same moment the two brothers\r\nstepped forward, feeling the necessity of doing something. A very few\r\nwords between them were sufficient. The case admitted no difference of\r\nopinion: they must go to the drawing-room directly. Maria joined them\r\nwith the same intent, just then the stoutest of the three; for the very\r\ncircumstance which had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest\r\nsupport. Henry Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s retaining her hand at such a moment, a moment\r\nof such peculiar proof and importance, was worth ages of doubt and\r\nanxiety. She hailed it as an earnest of the most serious determination,\r\nand was equal even to encounter her father. They walked off, utterly\r\nheedless of Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s repeated question of, \xe2\x80\x9cShall I go too? Had\r\nnot I better go too? Will not it be right for me to go too?\xe2\x80\x9d but they\r\nwere no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer\r\nthe anxious inquiry, and, encouraging him by all means to pay his\r\nrespects to Sir Thomas without delay, sent him after the others with\r\ndelighted haste.\r\n\r\nFanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates. She had been\r\nquite overlooked by her cousins; and as her own opinion of her claims\r\non Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of\r\nclassing herself with his children, she was glad to remain behind and\r\ngain a little breathing-time. Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that\r\nwas endured by the rest, by the right of a disposition which not even\r\ninnocence could keep from suffering. She was nearly fainting: all her\r\nformer habitual dread of her uncle was returning, and with it\r\ncompassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the\r\ndevelopment before him, with solicitude on Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s account\r\nindescribable. She had found a seat, where in excessive trembling she\r\nwas enduring all these fearful thoughts, while the other three, no\r\nlonger under any restraint, were giving vent to their feelings of\r\nvexation, lamenting over such an unlooked-for premature arrival as a\r\nmost untoward event, and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been\r\ntwice as long on his passage, or were still in Antigua.\r\n\r\nThe Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates, from better\r\nunderstanding the family, and judging more clearly of the mischief that\r\nmust ensue. The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they felt the\r\ntotal destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while Mr.\r\nYates considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for\r\nthe evening, and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal\r\nbeing renewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were\r\nover, and he might be at leisure to be amused by it. The Crawfords\r\nlaughed at the idea; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their\r\nwalking quietly home and leaving the family to themselves, proposed Mr.\r\nYates\xe2\x80\x99s accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage.\r\nBut Mr. Yates, having never been with those who thought much of\r\nparental claims, or family confidence, could not perceive that anything\r\nof the kind was necessary; and therefore, thanking them, said, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\npreferred remaining where he was, that he might pay his respects to the\r\nold gentleman handsomely since he _was_ come; and besides, he did not\r\nthink it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was just beginning to collect herself, and to feel that if she\r\nstaid longer behind it might seem disrespectful, when this point was\r\nsettled, and being commissioned with the brother and sister\xe2\x80\x99s apology,\r\nsaw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the\r\ndreadful duty of appearing before her uncle.\r\n\r\nToo soon did she find herself at the drawing-room door; and after\r\npausing a moment for what she knew would not come, for a courage which\r\nthe outside of no door had ever supplied to her, she turned the lock in\r\ndesperation, and the lights of the drawing-room, and all the collected\r\nfamily, were before her. As she entered, her own name caught her ear.\r\nSir Thomas was at that moment looking round him, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cBut where\r\nis Fanny? Why do not I see my little Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and on perceiving her,\r\ncame forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her,\r\ncalling her his dear Fanny, kissing her affectionately, and observing\r\nwith decided pleasure how much she was grown! Fanny knew not how to\r\nfeel, nor where to look. She was quite oppressed. He had never been so\r\nkind, so _very_ kind to her in his life. His manner seemed changed, his\r\nvoice was quick from the agitation of joy; and all that had been awful\r\nin his dignity seemed lost in tenderness. He led her nearer the light\r\nand looked at her again\xe2\x80\x94inquired particularly after her health, and\r\nthen, correcting himself, observed that he need not inquire, for her\r\nappearance spoke sufficiently on that point. A fine blush having\r\nsucceeded the previous paleness of her face, he was justified in his\r\nbelief of her equal improvement in health and beauty. He inquired next\r\nafter her family, especially William: and his kindness altogether was\r\nsuch as made her reproach herself for loving him so little, and\r\nthinking his return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift\r\nher eyes to his face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the\r\nburnt, fagged, worn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender\r\nfeeling was increased, and she was miserable in considering how much\r\nunsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas was indeed the life of the party, who at his suggestion now\r\nseated themselves round the fire. He had the best right to be the\r\ntalker; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own\r\nhouse, in the centre of his family, after such a separation, made him\r\ncommunicative and chatty in a very unusual degree; and he was ready to\r\ngive every information as to his voyage, and answer every question of\r\nhis two sons almost before it was put. His business in Antigua had\r\nlatterly been prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool,\r\nhaving had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private\r\nvessel, instead of waiting for the packet; and all the little\r\nparticulars of his proceedings and events, his arrivals and departures,\r\nwere most promptly delivered, as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with\r\nheartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him\xe2\x80\x94interrupting himself\r\nmore than once, however, to remark on his good fortune in finding them\r\nall at home\xe2\x80\x94coming unexpectedly as he did\xe2\x80\x94all collected together\r\nexactly as he could have wished, but dared not depend on. Mr. Rushworth\r\nwas not forgotten: a most friendly reception and warmth of hand-shaking\r\nhad already met him, and with pointed attention he was now included in\r\nthe objects most intimately connected with Mansfield. There was nothing\r\ndisagreeable in Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking\r\nhim already.\r\n\r\nBy not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken,\r\nunalloyed enjoyment as by his wife, who was really extremely happy to\r\nsee him, and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to\r\nplace her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years.\r\nShe had been _almost_ fluttered for a few minutes, and still remained\r\nso sensibly animated as to put away her work, move Pug from her side,\r\nand give all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband.\r\nShe had no anxieties for anybody to cloud _her_ pleasure: her own time\r\nhad been irreproachably spent during his absence: she had done a great\r\ndeal of carpet-work, and made many yards of fringe; and she would have\r\nanswered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all the\r\nyoung people as for her own. It was so agreeable to her to see him\r\nagain, and hear him talk, to have her ear amused and her whole\r\ncomprehension filled by his narratives, that she began particularly to\r\nfeel how dreadfully she must have missed him, and how impossible it\r\nwould have been for her to bear a lengthened absence.\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her sister.\r\nNot that _she_ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisapprobation when the present state of his house should be known, for\r\nher judgment had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive\r\ncaution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s pink satin\r\ncloak as her brother-in-law entered, she could hardly be said to shew\r\nany sign of alarm; but she was vexed by the _manner_ of his return. It\r\nhad left her nothing to do. Instead of being sent for out of the room,\r\nand seeing him first, and having to spread the happy news through the\r\nhouse, Sir Thomas, with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the\r\nnerves of his wife and children, had sought no confidant but the\r\nbutler, and had been following him almost instantaneously into the\r\ndrawing-room. Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which\r\nshe had always depended, whether his arrival or his death were to be\r\nthe thing unfolded; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having\r\nanything to bustle about, and labouring to be important where nothing\r\nwas wanted but tranquillity and silence. Would Sir Thomas have\r\nconsented to eat, she might have gone to the housekeeper with\r\ntroublesome directions, and insulted the footmen with injunctions of\r\ndespatch; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner: he would take\r\nnothing, nothing till tea came\xe2\x80\x94he would rather wait for tea. Still Mrs.\r\nNorris was at intervals urging something different; and in the most\r\ninteresting moment of his passage to England, when the alarm of a\r\nFrench privateer was at the height, she burst through his recital with\r\nthe proposal of soup. \xe2\x80\x9cSure, my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would\r\nbe a much better thing for you than tea. Do have a basin of soup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas could not be provoked. \xe2\x80\x9cStill the same anxiety for\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris,\xe2\x80\x9d was his answer. \xe2\x80\x9cBut indeed\r\nI would rather have nothing but tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea directly; suppose\r\nyou hurry Baddeley a little; he seems behindhand to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d She carried\r\nthis point, and Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s narrative proceeded.\r\n\r\nAt length there was a pause. His immediate communications were\r\nexhausted, and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him, now\r\nat one, now at another of the beloved circle; but the pause was not\r\nlong: in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, and\r\nwhat were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do\r\nyou think the young people have been amusing themselves lately, Sir\r\nThomas? They have been acting. We have been all alive with acting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! and what have you been acting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! they\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _all_ will soon be told,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom hastily, and with affected\r\nunconcern; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is not worth while to bore my father with it now.\r\nYou will hear enough of it to-morrow, sir. We have just been trying, by\r\nway of doing something, and amusing my mother, just within the last\r\nweek, to get up a few scenes, a mere trifle. We have had such incessant\r\nrains almost since October began, that we have been nearly confined to\r\nthe house for days together. I have hardly taken out a gun since the\r\n3rd. Tolerable sport the first three days, but there has been no\r\nattempting anything since. The first day I went over Mansfield Wood,\r\nand Edmund took the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace\r\nbetween us, and might each have killed six times as many, but we\r\nrespect your pheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire.\r\nI do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than\r\nthey were. _I_ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life\r\nas this year. I hope you will take a day\xe2\x80\x99s sport there yourself, sir,\r\nsoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the present the danger was over, and Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s sick feelings\r\nsubsided; but when tea was soon afterwards brought in, and Sir Thomas,\r\ngetting up, said that he found that he could not be any longer in the\r\nhouse without just looking into his own dear room, every agitation was\r\nreturning. He was gone before anything had been said to prepare him for\r\nthe change he must find there; and a pause of alarm followed his\r\ndisappearance. Edmund was the first to speak\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething must be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is time to think of our visitors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria, still feeling her\r\nhand pressed to Henry Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and caring little for anything\r\nelse. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you leave Miss Crawford, Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny told of their departure, and delivered their message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen poor Yates is all alone,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go and fetch him. He\r\nwill be no bad assistant when it all comes out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the theatre he went, and reached it just in time to witness the\r\nfirst meeting of his father and his friend. Sir Thomas had been a good\r\ndeal surprised to find candles burning in his room; and on casting his\r\neye round it, to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general\r\nair of confusion in the furniture. The removal of the bookcase from\r\nbefore the billiard-room door struck him especially, but he had\r\nscarcely more than time to feel astonished at all this, before there\r\nwere sounds from the billiard-room to astonish him still farther. Some\r\none was talking there in a very loud accent; he did not know the\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94more than talking\xe2\x80\x94almost hallooing. He stepped to the door,\r\nrejoicing at that moment in having the means of immediate\r\ncommunication, and, opening it, found himself on the stage of a\r\ntheatre, and opposed to a ranting young man, who appeared likely to\r\nknock him down backwards. At the very moment of Yates perceiving Sir\r\nThomas, and giving perhaps the very best start he had ever given in the\r\nwhole course of his rehearsals, Tom Bertram entered at the other end of\r\nthe room; and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping his\r\ncountenance. His father\xe2\x80\x99s looks of solemnity and amazement on this his\r\nfirst appearance on any stage, and the gradual metamorphosis of the\r\nimpassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred and easy Mr. Yates,\r\nmaking his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was such an\r\nexhibition, such a piece of true acting, as he would not have lost upon\r\nany account. It would be the last\xe2\x80\x94in all probability\xe2\x80\x94the last scene on\r\nthat stage; but he was sure there could not be a finer. The house would\r\nclose with the greatest eclat.\r\n\r\nThere was little time, however, for the indulgence of any images of\r\nmerriment. It was necessary for him to step forward, too, and assist\r\nthe introduction, and with many awkward sensations he did his best. Sir\r\nThomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which\r\nwas due to his own character, but was really as far from pleased with\r\nthe necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its\r\ncommencement. Mr. Yates\xe2\x80\x99s family and connexions were sufficiently known\r\nto him to render his introduction as the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular friend,\xe2\x80\x9d another\r\nof the hundred particular friends of his son, exceedingly unwelcome;\r\nand it needed all the felicity of being again at home, and all the\r\nforbearance it could supply, to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding\r\nhimself thus bewildered in his own house, making part of a ridiculous\r\nexhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense, and forced in so\r\nuntoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt\r\nsure of disapproving, and whose easy indifference and volubility in the\r\ncourse of the first five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nTom understood his father\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, and heartily wishing he might be\r\nalways as well disposed to give them but partial expression, began to\r\nsee, more clearly than he had ever done before, that there might be\r\nsome ground of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance\r\nhis father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room; and that\r\nwhen he inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the\r\nbilliard-table, he was not proceeding beyond a very allowable\r\ncuriosity. A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations\r\non each side; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak\r\na few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr.\r\nYates, as to the happiness of the arrangement, the three gentlemen\r\nreturned to the drawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an increase of\r\ngravity which was not lost on all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come from your theatre,\xe2\x80\x9d said he composedly, as he sat down; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nfound myself in it rather unexpectedly. Its vicinity to my own room\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nin every respect, indeed, it took me by surprise, as I had not the\r\nsmallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a\r\ncharacter. It appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by\r\ncandlelight, and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit.\xe2\x80\x9d And then\r\nhe would have changed the subject, and sipped his coffee in peace over\r\ndomestic matters of a calmer hue; but Mr. Yates, without discernment to\r\ncatch Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, or diffidence, or delicacy, or discretion\r\nenough to allow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the\r\nothers with the least obtrusiveness himself, would keep him on the\r\ntopic of the theatre, would torment him with questions and remarks\r\nrelative to it, and finally would make him hear the whole history of\r\nhis disappointment at Ecclesford. Sir Thomas listened most politely,\r\nbut found much to offend his ideas of decorum, and confirm his\r\nill-opinion of Mr. Yates\xe2\x80\x99s habits of thinking, from the beginning to\r\nthe end of the story; and when it was over, could give him no other\r\nassurance of sympathy than what a slight bow conveyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was, in fact, the origin of _our_ acting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, after a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s thought. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend Yates brought the infection from\r\nEcclesford, and it spread\xe2\x80\x94as those things always spread, you know,\r\nsir\xe2\x80\x94the faster, probably, from _your_ having so often encouraged the\r\nsort of thing in us formerly. It was like treading old ground again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Yates took the subject from his friend as soon as possible, and\r\nimmediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had done and were\r\ndoing: told him of the gradual increase of their views, the happy\r\nconclusion of their first difficulties, and present promising state of\r\naffairs; relating everything with so blind an interest as made him not\r\nonly totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of his friends\r\nas they sat, the change of countenance, the fidget, the hem! of\r\nunquietness, but prevented him even from seeing the expression of the\r\nface on which his own eyes were fixed\xe2\x80\x94from seeing Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s dark\r\nbrow contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughters\r\nand Edmund, dwelling particularly on the latter, and speaking a\r\nlanguage, a remonstrance, a reproof, which _he_ felt at his heart. Not\r\nless acutely was it felt by Fanny, who had edged back her chair behind\r\nher aunt\xe2\x80\x99s end of the sofa, and, screened from notice herself, saw all\r\nthat was passing before her. Such a look of reproach at Edmund from his\r\nfather she could never have expected to witness; and to feel that it\r\nwas in any degree deserved was an aggravation indeed. Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s look\r\nimplied, \xe2\x80\x9cOn your judgment, Edmund, I depended; what have you been\r\nabout?\xe2\x80\x9d She knelt in spirit to her uncle, and her bosom swelled to\r\nutter, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, not to _him_! Look so to all the others, but not to _him_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Yates was still talking. \xe2\x80\x9cTo own the truth, Sir Thomas, we were in\r\nthe middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening. We were going\r\nthrough the three first acts, and not unsuccessfully upon the whole.\r\nOur company is now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home,\r\nthat nothing more can be done to-night; but if you will give us the\r\nhonour of your company to-morrow evening, I should not be afraid of the\r\nresult. We bespeak your indulgence, you understand, as young\r\nperformers; we bespeak your indulgence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy indulgence shall be given, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Thomas gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwithout any other rehearsal.\xe2\x80\x9d And with a relenting smile, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncome home to be happy and indulgent.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning away towards any or\r\nall of the rest, he tranquilly said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. and Miss Crawford were\r\nmentioned in my last letters from Mansfield. Do you find them agreeable\r\nacquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTom was the only one at all ready with an answer, but he being entirely\r\nwithout particular regard for either, without jealousy either in love\r\nor acting, could speak very handsomely of both. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Crawford was a\r\nmost pleasant, gentleman-like man; his sister a sweet, pretty, elegant,\r\nlively girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Rushworth could be silent no longer. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not say he is not\r\ngentleman-like, considering; but you should tell your father he is not\r\nabove five feet eight, or he will be expecting a well-looking man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas did not quite understand this, and looked with some surprise\r\nat the speaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I must say what I think,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Rushworth, \xe2\x80\x9cin my opinion\r\nit is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing. It is having too much\r\nof a good thing. I am not so fond of acting as I was at first. I think\r\nwe are a great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among\r\nourselves, and doing nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas looked again, and then replied with an approving smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same. It\r\ngives me sincere satisfaction. That I should be cautious and\r\nquick-sighted, and feel many scruples which my children do _not_ feel,\r\nis perfectly natural; and equally so that my value for domestic\r\ntranquillity, for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much\r\nexceed theirs. But at your time of life to feel all this, is a most\r\nfavourable circumstance for yourself, and for everybody connected with\r\nyou; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such\r\nweight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in better words\r\nthan he could find himself. He was aware that he must not expect a\r\ngenius in Mr. Rushworth; but as a well-judging, steady young man, with\r\nbetter notions than his elocution would do justice to, he intended to\r\nvalue him very highly. It was impossible for many of the others not to\r\nsmile. Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning; but\r\nby looking, as he really felt, most exceedingly pleased with Sir\r\nThomas\xe2\x80\x99s good opinion, and saying scarcely anything, he did his best\r\ntowards preserving that good opinion a little longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund\xe2\x80\x99s first object the next morning was to see his father alone, and\r\ngive him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme, defending his own\r\nshare in it as far only as he could then, in a soberer moment, feel his\r\nmotives to deserve, and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness, that\r\nhis concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his\r\njudgment in it very doubtful. He was anxious, while vindicating\r\nhimself, to say nothing unkind of the others: but there was only one\r\namongst them whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of\r\ndefence or palliation. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have all been more or less to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cevery one of us, excepting Fanny. Fanny is the only one who has\r\njudged rightly throughout; who has been consistent. _Her_ feelings have\r\nbeen steadily against it from first to last. She never ceased to think\r\nof what was due to you. You will find Fanny everything you could wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party,\r\nand at such a time, as strongly as his son had ever supposed he must;\r\nhe felt it too much, indeed, for many words; and having shaken hands\r\nwith Edmund, meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression, and\r\nforget how much he had been forgotten himself as soon as he could,\r\nafter the house had been cleared of every object enforcing the\r\nremembrance, and restored to its proper state. He did not enter into\r\nany remonstrance with his other children: he was more willing to\r\nbelieve they felt their error than to run the risk of investigation.\r\nThe reproof of an immediate conclusion of everything, the sweep of\r\nevery preparation, would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThere was one person, however, in the house, whom he could not leave to\r\nlearn his sentiments merely through his conduct. He could not help\r\ngiving Mrs. Norris a hint of his having hoped that her advice might\r\nhave been interposed to prevent what her judgment must certainly have\r\ndisapproved. The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming\r\nthe plan; they ought to have been capable of a better decision\r\nthemselves; but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed, of\r\nunsteady characters; and with greater surprise, therefore, he must\r\nregard her acquiescence in their wrong measures, her countenance of\r\ntheir unsafe amusements, than that such measures and such amusements\r\nshould have been suggested. Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as\r\nnearly being silenced as ever she had been in her life; for she was\r\nashamed to confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was\r\nso glaring to Sir Thomas, and would not have admitted that her\r\ninfluence was insufficient\xe2\x80\x94that she might have talked in vain. Her only\r\nresource was to get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn\r\nthe current of Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s ideas into a happier channel. She had a\r\ngreat deal to insinuate in her own praise as to _general_ attention to\r\nthe interest and comfort of his family, much exertion and many\r\nsacrifices to glance at in the form of hurried walks and sudden\r\nremovals from her own fireside, and many excellent hints of distrust\r\nand economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most\r\nconsiderable saving had always arisen, and more than one bad servant\r\nbeen detected. But her chief strength lay in Sotherton. Her greatest\r\nsupport and glory was in having formed the connexion with the\r\nRushworths. _There_ she was impregnable. She took to herself all the\r\ncredit of bringing Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s admiration of Maria to any effect.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had not been active,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand made a point of being\r\nintroduced to his mother, and then prevailed on my sister to pay the\r\nfirst visit, I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come\r\nof it; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who\r\nwants a great deal of encouragement, and there were girls enough on the\r\ncatch for him if we had been idle. But I left no stone unturned. I was\r\nready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister, and at last I did\r\npersuade her. You know the distance to Sotherton; it was in the middle\r\nof winter, and the roads almost impassable, but I did persuade her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how great, how justly great, your influence is with Lady\r\nBertram and her children, and am the more concerned that it should not\r\nhave been\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the roads _that_ day!\r\nI thought we should never have got through them, though we had the four\r\nhorses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his\r\ngreat love and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box on\r\naccount of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since\r\nMichaelmas. I cured him at last; but he was very bad all the winter\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthis was such a day, I could not help going to him up in his room\r\nbefore we set off to advise him not to venture: he was putting on his\r\nwig; so I said, \xe2\x80\x98Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and I\r\nshall be very safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has\r\nbeen upon the leaders so often now, that I am sure there is no fear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut, however, I soon found it would not do; he was bent upon going, and\r\nas I hate to be worrying and officious, I said no more; but my heart\r\nquite ached for him at every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes\r\nabout Stoke, where, what with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it\r\nwas worse than anything you can imagine, I was quite in an agony about\r\nhim. And then the poor horses too! To see them straining away! You know\r\nhow I always feel for the horses. And when we got to the bottom of\r\nSandcroft Hill, what do you think I did? You will laugh at me; but I\r\ngot out and walked up. I did indeed. It might not be saving them much,\r\nbut it was something, and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be\r\ndragged up at the expense of those noble animals. I caught a dreadful\r\ncold, but _that_ I did not regard. My object was accomplished in the\r\nvisit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that\r\nmight be taken to establish it. There is nothing very striking in Mr.\r\nRushworth\xe2\x80\x99s manners, but I was pleased last night with what appeared to\r\nbe his opinion on one subject: his decided preference of a quiet family\r\nparty to the bustle and confusion of acting. He seemed to feel exactly\r\nas one could wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, and the more you know of him the better you will like\r\nhim. He is not a shining character, but he has a thousand good\r\nqualities; and is so disposed to look up to you, that I am quite\r\nlaughed at about it, for everybody considers it as my doing. \xe2\x80\x98Upon my\r\nword, Mrs. Norris,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Grant the other day, \xe2\x80\x98if Mr. Rushworth\r\nwere a son of your own, he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater\r\nrespect.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her evasions, disarmed by her\r\nflattery; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that\r\nwhere the present pleasure of those she loved was at stake, her\r\nkindness did sometimes overpower her judgment.\r\n\r\nIt was a busy morning with him. Conversation with any of them occupied\r\nbut a small part of it. He had to reinstate himself in all the wonted\r\nconcerns of his Mansfield life: to see his steward and his bailiff; to\r\nexamine and compute, and, in the intervals of business, to walk into\r\nhis stables and his gardens, and nearest plantations; but active and\r\nmethodical, he had not only done all this before he resumed his seat as\r\nmaster of the house at dinner, he had also set the carpenter to work in\r\npulling down what had been so lately put up in the billiard-room, and\r\ngiven the scene-painter his dismissal long enough to justify the\r\npleasing belief of his being then at least as far off as Northampton.\r\nThe scene-painter was gone, having spoilt only the floor of one room,\r\nruined all the coachman\xe2\x80\x99s sponges, and made five of the under-servants\r\nidle and dissatisfied; and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day or\r\ntwo would suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been,\r\neven to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows in the\r\nhouse, for he was burning all that met his eye.\r\n\r\nMr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s intentions,\r\nthough as far as ever from understanding their source. He and his\r\nfriend had been out with their guns the chief of the morning, and Tom\r\nhad taken the opportunity of explaining, with proper apologies for his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s particularity, what was to be expected. Mr. Yates felt it as\r\nacutely as might be supposed. To be a second time disappointed in the\r\nsame way was an instance of very severe ill-luck; and his indignation\r\nwas such, that had it not been for delicacy towards his friend, and his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s youngest sister, he believed he should certainly attack the\r\nbaronet on the absurdity of his proceedings, and argue him into a\r\nlittle more rationality. He believed this very stoutly while he was in\r\nMansfield Wood, and all the way home; but there was a something in Sir\r\nThomas, when they sat round the same table, which made Mr. Yates think\r\nit wiser to let him pursue his own way, and feel the folly of it\r\nwithout opposition. He had known many disagreeable fathers before, and\r\noften been struck with the inconveniences they occasioned, but never,\r\nin the whole course of his life, had he seen one of that class so\r\nunintelligibly moral, so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas. He was\r\nnot a man to be endured but for his children\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and he might be\r\nthankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay\r\na few days longer under his roof.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed with external smoothness, though almost every mind\r\nwas ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his\r\ndaughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony. Maria was in a\r\ngood deal of agitation. It was of the utmost consequence to her that\r\nCrawford should now lose no time in declaring himself, and she was\r\ndisturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance\r\nthat point. She had been expecting to see him the whole morning, and\r\nall the evening, too, was still expecting him. Mr. Rushworth had set\r\noff early with the great news for Sotherton; and she had fondly hoped\r\nfor such an immediate _eclaircissement_ as might save him the trouble\r\nof ever coming back again. But they had seen no one from the Parsonage,\r\nnot a creature, and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of\r\ncongratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram. It was the\r\nfirst day for many, many weeks, in which the families had been wholly\r\ndivided. Four-and-twenty hours had never passed before, since August\r\nbegan, without bringing them together in some way or other. It was a\r\nsad, anxious day; and the morrow, though differing in the sort of evil,\r\ndid by no means bring less. A few moments of feverish enjoyment were\r\nfollowed by hours of acute suffering. Henry Crawford was again in the\r\nhouse: he walked up with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his respects\r\nto Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the\r\nbreakfast-room, where were most of the family. Sir Thomas soon\r\nappeared, and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of\r\nthe man she loved to her father. Her sensations were indefinable, and\r\nso were they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford, who\r\nhad a chair between herself and Tom, ask the latter in an undervoice\r\nwhether there were any plans for resuming the play after the present\r\nhappy interruption (with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas), because, in\r\nthat case, he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time\r\nrequired by the party: he was going away immediately, being to meet his\r\nuncle at Bath without delay; but if there were any prospect of a\r\nrenewal of Lovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows, he should hold himself positively engaged, he\r\nshould break through every other claim, he should absolutely condition\r\nwith his uncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted. The play\r\nshould not be lost by _his_ absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Bath, Norfolk, London, York, wherever I may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nattend you from any place in England, at an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was well at that moment that Tom had to speak, and not his sister.\r\nHe could immediately say with easy fluency, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you are going;\r\nbut as to our play, _that_ is all over\xe2\x80\x94entirely at an end\xe2\x80\x9d (looking\r\nsignificantly at his father). \xe2\x80\x9cThe painter was sent off yesterday, and\r\nvery little will remain of the theatre to-morrow. I knew how _that_\r\nwould be from the first. It is early for Bath. You will find nobody\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is about my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s usual time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you think of going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may, perhaps, get as far as Banbury to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose stables do you use at Bath?\xe2\x80\x9d was the next question; and while\r\nthis branch of the subject was under discussion, Maria, who wanted\r\nneither pride nor resolution, was preparing to encounter her share of\r\nit with tolerable calmness.\r\n\r\nTo her he soon turned, repeating much of what he had already said, with\r\nonly a softened air and stronger expressions of regret. But what\r\navailed his expressions or his air? He was going, and, if not\r\nvoluntarily going, voluntarily intending to stay away; for, excepting\r\nwhat might be due to his uncle, his engagements were all self-imposed.\r\nHe might talk of necessity, but she knew his independence. The hand\r\nwhich had so pressed hers to his heart! the hand and the heart were\r\nalike motionless and passive now! Her spirit supported her, but the\r\nagony of her mind was severe. She had not long to endure what arose\r\nfrom listening to language which his actions contradicted, or to bury\r\nthe tumult of her feelings under the restraint of society; for general\r\ncivilities soon called his notice from her, and the farewell visit, as\r\nit then became openly acknowledged, was a very short one. He was\r\ngone\xe2\x80\x94he had touched her hand for the last time, he had made his parting\r\nbow, and she might seek directly all that solitude could do for her.\r\nHenry Crawford was gone, gone from the house, and within two hours\r\nafterwards from the parish; and so ended all the hopes his selfish\r\nvanity had raised in Maria and Julia Bertram.\r\n\r\nJulia could rejoice that he was gone. His presence was beginning to be\r\nodious to her; and if Maria gained him not, she was now cool enough to\r\ndispense with any other revenge. She did not want exposure to be added\r\nto desertion. Henry Crawford gone, she could even pity her sister.\r\n\r\nWith a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence. She heard it\r\nat dinner, and felt it a blessing. By all the others it was mentioned\r\nwith regret; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling\xe2\x80\x94from\r\nthe sincerity of Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s too partial regard, to the unconcern of his\r\nmother speaking entirely by rote. Mrs. Norris began to look about her,\r\nand wonder that his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing; and\r\ncould almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it;\r\nbut with so many to care for, how was it possible for even _her_\r\nactivity to keep pace with her wishes?\r\n\r\nAnother day or two, and Mr. Yates was gone likewise. In _his_ departure\r\nSir Thomas felt the chief interest: wanting to be alone with his\r\nfamily, the presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been\r\nirksome; but of him, trifling and confident, idle and expensive, it was\r\nevery way vexatious. In himself he was wearisome, but as the friend of\r\nTom and the admirer of Julia he became offensive. Sir Thomas had been\r\nquite indifferent to Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s going or staying: but his good\r\nwishes for Mr. Yates\xe2\x80\x99s having a pleasant journey, as he walked with him\r\nto the hall-door, were given with genuine satisfaction. Mr. Yates had\r\nstaid to see the destruction of every theatrical preparation at\r\nMansfield, the removal of everything appertaining to the play: he left\r\nthe house in all the soberness of its general character; and Sir Thomas\r\nhoped, in seeing him out of it, to be rid of the worst object connected\r\nwith the scheme, and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of\r\nits existence.\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his sight that might\r\nhave distressed him. The curtain, over which she had presided with such\r\ntalent and such success, went off with her to her cottage, where she\r\nhappened to be particularly in want of green baize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s return made a striking change in the ways of the family,\r\nindependent of Lovers\xe2\x80\x99 Vows. Under his government, Mansfield was an\r\naltered place. Some members of their society sent away, and the spirits\r\nof many others saddened\xe2\x80\x94it was all sameness and gloom compared with the\r\npast\xe2\x80\x94a sombre family party rarely enlivened. There was little\r\nintercourse with the Parsonage. Sir Thomas, drawing back from\r\nintimacies in general, was particularly disinclined, at this time, for\r\nany engagements but in one quarter. The Rushworths were the only\r\naddition to his own domestic circle which he could solicit.\r\n\r\nEdmund did not wonder that such should be his father\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, nor\r\ncould he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe observed to Fanny, \xe2\x80\x9chave a claim. They seem to belong to us; they\r\nseem to be part of ourselves. I could wish my father were more sensible\r\nof their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was\r\naway. I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected. But the truth is,\r\nthat my father hardly knows them. They had not been here a twelvemonth\r\nwhen he left England. If he knew them better, he would value their\r\nsociety as it deserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people\r\nhe would like. We are sometimes a little in want of animation among\r\nourselves: my sisters seem out of spirits, and Tom is certainly not at\r\nhis ease. Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings\r\npass away with more enjoyment even to my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny: \xe2\x80\x9cin my opinion, my uncle would not like\r\n_any_ addition. I think he values the very quietness you speak of, and\r\nthat the repose of his own family circle is all he wants. And it does\r\nnot appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be\xe2\x80\x94I mean\r\nbefore my uncle went abroad. As well as I can recollect, it was always\r\nmuch the same. There was never much laughing in his presence; or, if\r\nthere is any difference, it is not more, I think, than such an absence\r\nhas a tendency to produce at first. There must be a sort of shyness;\r\nbut I cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry,\r\nexcept when my uncle was in town. No young people\xe2\x80\x99s are, I suppose,\r\nwhen those they look up to are at home\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you are right, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d was his reply, after a short\r\nconsideration. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe our evenings are rather returned to what they\r\nwere, than assuming a new character. The novelty was in their being\r\nlively. Yet, how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give!\r\nI have been feeling as if we had never lived so before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I am graver than other people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny. \xe2\x80\x9cThe evenings do\r\nnot appear long to me. I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies.\r\nI could listen to him for an hour together. It entertains _me_ more\r\nthan many other things have done; but then I am unlike other people, I\r\ndare say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you dare say _that_?\xe2\x80\x9d (smiling). \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to be told\r\nthat you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet?\r\nBut when did you, or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, Fanny? Go\r\nto my father if you want to be complimented. He will satisfy you. Ask\r\nyour uncle what he thinks, and you will hear compliments enough: and\r\nthough they may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it, and\r\ntrust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour uncle thinks you very pretty, dear Fanny\xe2\x80\x94and that is the long and\r\nthe short of the matter. Anybody but myself would have made something\r\nmore of it, and anybody but you would resent that you had not been\r\nthought very pretty before; but the truth is, that your uncle never did\r\nadmire you till now\xe2\x80\x94and now he does. Your complexion is so\r\nimproved!\xe2\x80\x94and you have gained so much countenance!\xe2\x80\x94and your figure\xe2\x80\x94nay,\r\nFanny, do not turn away about it\xe2\x80\x94it is but an uncle. If you cannot bear\r\nan uncle\xe2\x80\x99s admiration, what is to become of you? You must really begin\r\nto harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at. You must try\r\nnot to mind growing up into a pretty woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! don\xe2\x80\x99t talk so, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk so,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fanny, distressed by more\r\nfeelings than he was aware of; but seeing that she was distressed, he\r\nhad done with the subject, and only added more seriously\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect; and I\r\nonly wish you would talk to him more. You are one of those who are too\r\nsilent in the evening circle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do talk to him more than I used. I am sure I do. Did not you\r\nhear me ask him about the slave-trade last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did\xe2\x80\x94and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others. It\r\nwould have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I longed to do it\xe2\x80\x94but there was such a dead silence! And while my\r\ncousins were sitting by without speaking a word, or seeming at all\r\ninterested in the subject, I did not like\xe2\x80\x94I thought it would appear as\r\nif I wanted to set myself off at their expense, by shewing a curiosity\r\nand pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to\r\nfeel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day:\r\nthat you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women\r\nwere of neglect. We were talking of you at the Parsonage, and those\r\nwere her words. She has great discernment. I know nobody who\r\ndistinguishes characters better. For so young a woman it is remarkable!\r\nShe certainly understands _you_ better than you are understood by the\r\ngreater part of those who have known you so long; and with regard to\r\nsome others, I can perceive, from occasional lively hints, the\r\nunguarded expressions of the moment, that she could define _many_ as\r\naccurately, did not delicacy forbid it. I wonder what she thinks of my\r\nfather! She must admire him as a fine-looking man, with most\r\ngentlemanlike, dignified, consistent manners; but perhaps, having seen\r\nhim so seldom, his reserve may be a little repulsive. Could they be\r\nmuch together, I feel sure of their liking each other. He would enjoy\r\nher liveliness and she has talents to value his powers. I wish they met\r\nmore frequently! I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on\r\nhis side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, with half a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cto have any such apprehension. And\r\nSir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s wishing just at first to be only with his family, is so\r\nvery natural, that she can argue nothing from that. After a little\r\nwhile, I dare say, we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way,\r\nallowing for the difference of the time of year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first October that she has passed in the country since her\r\ninfancy. I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country; and\r\nNovember is a still more serious month, and I can see that Mrs. Grant\r\nis very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny could have said a great deal, but it was safer to say nothing,\r\nand leave untouched all Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s resources\xe2\x80\x94her accomplishments,\r\nher spirits, her importance, her friends, lest it should betray her\r\ninto any observations seemingly unhandsome. Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s kind\r\nopinion of herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance, and she\r\nbegan to talk of something else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and you and Mr.\r\nBertram too. We shall be quite a small party at home. I hope my uncle\r\nmay continue to like Mr. Rushworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is impossible, Fanny. He must like him less after to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvisit, for we shall be five hours in his company. I should dread the\r\nstupidity of the day, if there were not a much greater evil to\r\nfollow\xe2\x80\x94the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas. He cannot much\r\nlonger deceive himself. I am sorry for them all, and would give\r\nsomething that Rushworth and Maria had never met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this quarter, indeed, disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas.\r\nNot all his good-will for Mr. Rushworth, not all Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeference for him, could prevent him from soon discerning some part of\r\nthe truth\xe2\x80\x94that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man, as ignorant in\r\nbusiness as in books, with opinions in general unfixed, and without\r\nseeming much aware of it himself.\r\n\r\nHe had expected a very different son-in-law; and beginning to feel\r\ngrave on Maria\xe2\x80\x99s account, tried to understand _her_ feelings. Little\r\nobservation there was necessary to tell him that indifference was the\r\nmost favourable state they could be in. Her behaviour to Mr. Rushworth\r\nwas careless and cold. She could not, did not like him. Sir Thomas\r\nresolved to speak seriously to her. Advantageous as would be the\r\nalliance, and long standing and public as was the engagement, her\r\nhappiness must not be sacrificed to it. Mr. Rushworth had, perhaps,\r\nbeen accepted on too short an acquaintance, and, on knowing him better,\r\nshe was repenting.\r\n\r\nWith solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her: told her his fears,\r\ninquired into her wishes, entreated her to be open and sincere, and\r\nassured her that every inconvenience should be braved, and the\r\nconnexion entirely given up, if she felt herself unhappy in the\r\nprospect of it. He would act for her and release her. Maria had a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s struggle as she listened, and only a moment\xe2\x80\x99s: when her father\r\nceased, she was able to give her answer immediately, decidedly, and\r\nwith no apparent agitation. She thanked him for his great attention,\r\nhis paternal kindness, but he was quite mistaken in supposing she had\r\nthe smallest desire of breaking through her engagement, or was sensible\r\nof any change of opinion or inclination since her forming it. She had\r\nthe highest esteem for Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s character and disposition, and\r\ncould not have a doubt of her happiness with him.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas was satisfied; too glad to be satisfied, perhaps, to urge\r\nthe matter quite so far as his judgment might have dictated to others.\r\nIt was an alliance which he could not have relinquished without pain;\r\nand thus he reasoned. Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve. Mr.\r\nRushworth must and would improve in good society; and if Maria could\r\nnow speak so securely of her happiness with him, speaking certainly\r\nwithout the prejudice, the blindness of love, she ought to be believed.\r\nHer feelings, probably, were not acute; he had never supposed them to\r\nbe so; but her comforts might not be less on that account; and if she\r\ncould dispense with seeing her husband a leading, shining character,\r\nthere would certainly be everything else in her favour. A well-disposed\r\nyoung woman, who did not marry for love, was in general but the more\r\nattached to her own family; and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield\r\nmust naturally hold out the greatest temptation, and would, in all\r\nprobability, be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocent\r\nenjoyments. Such and such-like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas, happy\r\nto escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture, the wonder, the\r\nreflections, the reproach that must attend it; happy to secure a\r\nmarriage which would bring him such an addition of respectability and\r\ninfluence, and very happy to think anything of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisposition that was most favourable for the purpose.\r\n\r\nTo her the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him. She was in a\r\nstate of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall:\r\nthat she had pledged herself anew to Sotherton; that she was safe from\r\nthe possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her\r\nactions, and destroying her prospects; and retired in proud resolve,\r\ndetermined only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future,\r\nthat her father might not be again suspecting her.\r\n\r\nHad Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four\r\ndays after Henry Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s leaving Mansfield, before her feelings were\r\nat all tranquillised, before she had given up every hope of him, or\r\nabsolutely resolved on enduring his rival, her answer might have been\r\ndifferent; but after another three or four days, when there was no\r\nreturn, no letter, no message, no symptom of a softened heart, no hope\r\nof advantage from separation, her mind became cool enough to seek all\r\nthe comfort that pride and self revenge could give.\r\n\r\nHenry Crawford had destroyed her happiness, but he should not know that\r\nhe had done it; he should not destroy her credit, her appearance, her\r\nprosperity, too. He should not have to think of her as pining in the\r\nretirement of Mansfield for _him_, rejecting Sotherton and London,\r\nindependence and splendour, for _his_ sake. Independence was more\r\nneedful than ever; the want of it at Mansfield more sensibly felt. She\r\nwas less and less able to endure the restraint which her father\r\nimposed. The liberty which his absence had given was now become\r\nabsolutely necessary. She must escape from him and Mansfield as soon as\r\npossible, and find consolation in fortune and consequence, bustle and\r\nthe world, for a wounded spirit. Her mind was quite determined, and\r\nvaried not.\r\n\r\nTo such feelings delay, even the delay of much preparation, would have\r\nbeen an evil, and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for the\r\nmarriage than herself. In all the important preparations of the mind\r\nshe was complete: being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home,\r\nrestraint, and tranquillity; by the misery of disappointed affection,\r\nand contempt of the man she was to marry. The rest might wait. The\r\npreparations of new carriages and furniture might wait for London and\r\nspring, when her own taste could have fairer play.\r\n\r\nThe principals being all agreed in this respect, it soon appeared that\r\na very few weeks would be sufficient for such arrangements as must\r\nprecede the wedding.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire, and make way for the\r\nfortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected; and very early in\r\nNovember removed herself, her maid, her footman, and her chariot, with\r\ntrue dowager propriety, to Bath, there to parade over the wonders of\r\nSotherton in her evening parties; enjoying them as thoroughly, perhaps,\r\nin the animation of a card-table, as she had ever done on the spot; and\r\nbefore the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which\r\ngave Sotherton another mistress.\r\n\r\nIt was a very proper wedding. The bride was elegantly dressed; the two\r\nbridesmaids were duly inferior; her father gave her away; her mother\r\nstood with salts in her hand, expecting to be agitated; her aunt tried\r\nto cry; and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant. Nothing\r\ncould be objected to when it came under the discussion of the\r\nneighbourhood, except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and\r\nbridegroom and Julia from the church-door to Sotherton was the same\r\nchaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before. In\r\neverything else the etiquette of the day might stand the strictest\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nIt was done, and they were gone. Sir Thomas felt as an anxious father\r\nmust feel, and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which his\r\nwife had been apprehensive of for herself, but had fortunately escaped.\r\nMrs. Norris, most happy to assist in the duties of the day, by spending\r\nit at the Park to support her sister\xe2\x80\x99s spirits, and drinking the health\r\nof Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two, was all\r\njoyous delight; for she had made the match; she had done everything;\r\nand no one would have supposed, from her confident triumph, that she\r\nhad ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life, or could have the\r\nsmallest insight into the disposition of the niece who had been brought\r\nup under her eye.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the young couple was to proceed, after a few days, to\r\nBrighton, and take a house there for some weeks. Every public place was\r\nnew to Maria, and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer.\r\nWhen the novelty of amusement there was over, it would be time for the\r\nwider range of London.\r\n\r\nJulia was to go with them to Brighton. Since rivalry between the\r\nsisters had ceased, they had been gradually recovering much of their\r\nformer good understanding; and were at least sufficiently friends to\r\nmake each of them exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a time.\r\nSome other companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to\r\nhis lady; and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as\r\nMaria, though she might not have struggled through so much to obtain\r\nthem, and could better bear a subordinate situation.\r\n\r\nTheir departure made another material change at Mansfield, a chasm\r\nwhich required some time to fill up. The family circle became greatly\r\ncontracted; and though the Miss Bertrams had latterly added little to\r\nits gaiety, they could not but be missed. Even their mother missed\r\nthem; and how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered about\r\nthe house, and thought of them, and felt for them, with a degree of\r\naffectionate regret which they had never done much to deserve!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s consequence increased on the departure of her cousins.\r\nBecoming, as she then did, the only young woman in the drawing-room,\r\nthe only occupier of that interesting division of a family in which she\r\nhad hitherto held so humble a third, it was impossible for her not to\r\nbe more looked at, more thought of and attended to, than she had ever\r\nbeen before; and \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d became no uncommon question, even\r\nwithout her being wanted for any one\xe2\x80\x99s convenience.\r\n\r\nNot only at home did her value increase, but at the Parsonage too. In\r\nthat house, which she had hardly entered twice a year since Mr.\r\nNorris\xe2\x80\x99s death, she became a welcome, an invited guest, and in the\r\ngloom and dirt of a November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford. Her\r\nvisits there, beginning by chance, were continued by solicitation. Mrs.\r\nGrant, really eager to get any change for her sister, could, by the\r\neasiest self-deceit, persuade herself that she was doing the kindest\r\nthing by Fanny, and giving her the most important opportunities of\r\nimprovement in pressing her frequent calls.\r\n\r\nFanny, having been sent into the village on some errand by her aunt\r\nNorris, was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the Parsonage; and\r\nbeing descried from one of the windows endeavouring to find shelter\r\nunder the branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their\r\npremises, was forced, though not without some modest reluctance on her\r\npart, to come in. A civil servant she had withstood; but when Dr. Grant\r\nhimself went out with an umbrella, there was nothing to be done but to\r\nbe very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible;\r\nand to poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal\r\nrain in a very desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all\r\nher plan of exercise for that morning, and of every chance of seeing a\r\nsingle creature beyond themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the\r\nsound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Price\r\ndripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful. The value of an\r\nevent on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her.\r\nShe was all alive again directly, and among the most active in being\r\nuseful to Fanny, in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first\r\nallow, and providing her with dry clothes; and Fanny, after being\r\nobliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted and\r\nwaited on by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returning\r\ndownstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while the\r\nrain continued, the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was\r\nthus extended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her spirits to the\r\nperiod of dressing and dinner.\r\n\r\nThe two sisters were so kind to her, and so pleasant, that Fanny might\r\nhave enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way,\r\nand could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at\r\nthe end of the hour, and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncarriage and horses out to take her home, with which she was\r\nthreatened. As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such\r\nweather might occasion at home, she had nothing to suffer on that\r\nscore; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts, she was\r\nperfectly aware that none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage\r\naunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain, her being in\r\nsuch cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram.\r\n\r\nIt was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny, observing a harp in the\r\nroom, asked some questions about it, which soon led to an\r\nacknowledgment of her wishing very much to hear it, and a confession,\r\nwhich could hardly be believed, of her having never yet heard it since\r\nits being in Mansfield. To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and\r\nnatural circumstance. She had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since\r\nthe instrument\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, there had been no reason that she should; but\r\nMiss Crawford, calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject,\r\nwas concerned at her own neglect; and \xe2\x80\x9cShall I play to you now?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you have?\xe2\x80\x9d were questions immediately following with the\r\nreadiest good-humour.\r\n\r\nShe played accordingly; happy to have a new listener, and a listener\r\nwho seemed so much obliged, so full of wonder at the performance, and\r\nwho shewed herself not wanting in taste. She played till Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\nstraying to the window on the weather\xe2\x80\x99s being evidently fair, spoke\r\nwhat she felt must be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother quarter of an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, \xe2\x80\x9cand we shall see how\r\nit will be. Do not run away the first moment of its holding up. Those\r\nclouds look alarming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are passed over,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been watching them.\r\nThis weather is all from the south.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSouth or north, I know a black cloud when I see it; and you must not\r\nset forward while it is so threatening. And besides, I want to play\r\nsomething more to you\xe2\x80\x94a very pretty piece\xe2\x80\x94and your cousin Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprime favourite. You must stay and hear your cousin\xe2\x80\x99s favourite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny felt that she must; and though she had not waited for that\r\nsentence to be thinking of Edmund, such a memento made her particularly\r\nawake to his idea, and she fancied him sitting in that room again and\r\nagain, perhaps in the very spot where she sat now, listening with\r\nconstant delight to the favourite air, played, as it appeared to her,\r\nwith superior tone and expression; and though pleased with it herself,\r\nand glad to like whatever was liked by him, she was more sincerely\r\nimpatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she had been before;\r\nand on this being evident, she was so kindly asked to call again, to\r\ntake them in her walk whenever she could, to come and hear more of the\r\nharp, that she felt it necessary to be done, if no objection arose at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between\r\nthem within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams\xe2\x80\x99 going away\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nintimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s desire of something\r\nnew, and which had little reality in Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. Fanny went to\r\nher every two or three days: it seemed a kind of fascination: she could\r\nnot be easy without going, and yet it was without loving her, without\r\never thinking like her, without any sense of obligation for being\r\nsought after now when nobody else was to be had; and deriving no higher\r\npleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement, and _that_\r\noften at the expense of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry\r\non people or subjects which she wished to be respected. She went,\r\nhowever, and they sauntered about together many an half-hour in Mrs.\r\nGrant\xe2\x80\x99s shrubbery, the weather being unusually mild for the time of\r\nyear, and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches\r\nnow comparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till, in the\r\nmidst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s on the sweets of so\r\nprotracted an autumn, they were forced, by the sudden swell of a cold\r\ngust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about them, to jump up and\r\nwalk for warmth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is pretty, very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, looking around her as they\r\nwere thus sitting together one day; \xe2\x80\x9cevery time I come into this\r\nshrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty. Three years ago,\r\nthis was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the\r\nfield, never thought of as anything, or capable of becoming anything;\r\nand now it is converted into a walk, and it would be difficult to say\r\nwhether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament; and perhaps, in\r\nanother three years, we may be forgetting\xe2\x80\x94almost forgetting what it was\r\nbefore. How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time, and\r\nthe changes of the human mind!\xe2\x80\x9d And following the latter train of\r\nthought, she soon afterwards added: \xe2\x80\x9cIf any one faculty of our nature\r\nmay be called _more_ wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory.\r\nThere seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers,\r\nthe failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our\r\nintelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so\r\nobedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so\r\ntyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way;\r\nbut our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly\r\npast finding out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford, untouched and inattentive, had nothing to say; and\r\nFanny, perceiving it, brought back her own mind to what she thought\r\nmust interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may seem impertinent in _me_ to praise, but I must admire the taste\r\nMrs. Grant has shewn in all this. There is such a quiet simplicity in\r\nthe plan of the walk! Not too much attempted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Crawford carelessly, \xe2\x80\x9cit does very well for a place\r\nof this sort. One does not think of extent _here_; and between\r\nourselves, till I came to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country\r\nparson ever aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad to see the evergreens thrive!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, in reply. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own, and\r\nso it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general.\r\nThe evergreen! How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen!\r\nWhen one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature! In some\r\ncountries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but that\r\ndoes not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun\r\nshould nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their\r\nexistence. You will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors,\r\nespecially when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into\r\nthis sort of wondering strain. One cannot fix one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes on the\r\ncommonest natural production without finding food for a rambling\r\nfancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo say the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Crawford, \xe2\x80\x9cI am something like the\r\nfamous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.; and may declare that I see no\r\nwonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it. If anybody had\r\ntold me a year ago that this place would be my home, that I should be\r\nspending month after month here, as I have done, I certainly should not\r\nhave believed them. I have now been here nearly five months; and,\r\nmoreover, the quietest five months I ever passed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Too_ quiet for you, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought so _theoretically_ myself, but,\xe2\x80\x9d and her eyes\r\nbrightened as she spoke, \xe2\x80\x9ctake it all and all, I never spent so happy a\r\nsummer. But then,\xe2\x80\x9d with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nis no saying what it may lead to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat quick, and she felt quite unequal to surmising or\r\nsoliciting anything more. Miss Crawford, however, with renewed\r\nanimation, soon went on\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence\r\nthan I had ever expected to be. I can even suppose it pleasant to spend\r\n_half_ the year in the country, under certain circumstances, very\r\npleasant. An elegant, moderate-sized house in the centre of family\r\nconnexions; continual engagements among them; commanding the first\r\nsociety in the neighbourhood; looked up to, perhaps, as leading it even\r\nmore than those of larger fortune, and turning from the cheerful round\r\nof such amusements to nothing worse than a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with the\r\nperson one feels most agreeable in the world. There is nothing\r\nfrightful in such a picture, is there, Miss Price? One need not envy\r\nthe new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnvy Mrs. Rushworth!\xe2\x80\x9d was all that Fanny attempted to say. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\ncome, it would be very un-handsome in us to be severe on Mrs.\r\nRushworth, for I look forward to our owing her a great many gay,\r\nbrilliant, happy hours. I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton\r\nanother year. Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public\r\nblessing; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s wife must be to\r\nfill her house, and give the best balls in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was silent, and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness, till\r\nsuddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes, she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\r\nhere he is.\xe2\x80\x9d It was not Mr. Rushworth, however, but Edmund, who then\r\nappeared walking towards them with Mrs. Grant. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sister and Mr.\r\nBertram. I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone, that he may be Mr.\r\nBertram again. There is something in the sound of Mr. _Edmund_ Bertram\r\nso formal, so pitiful, so younger-brother-like, that I detest it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow differently we feel!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fanny. \xe2\x80\x9cTo me, the sound of _Mr._\r\nBertram is so cold and nothing-meaning, so entirely without warmth or\r\ncharacter! It just stands for a gentleman, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all. But there is\r\nnobleness in the name of Edmund. It is a name of heroism and renown; of\r\nkings, princes, and knights; and seems to breathe the spirit of\r\nchivalry and warm affections.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grant you the name is good in itself, and _Lord_ Edmund or _Sir_\r\nEdmund sound delightfully; but sink it under the chill, the\r\nannihilation of a Mr., and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr.\r\nThomas. Well, shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture\r\nupon sitting down out of doors at this time of year, by being up before\r\nthey can begin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund met them with particular pleasure. It was the first time of his\r\nseeing them together since the beginning of that better acquaintance\r\nwhich he had been hearing of with great satisfaction. A friendship\r\nbetween two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished:\r\nand to the credit of the lover\xe2\x80\x99s understanding, be it stated, that he\r\ndid not by any means consider Fanny as the only, or even as the greater\r\ngainer by such a friendship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, \xe2\x80\x9cand do you not scold us for our\r\nimprudence? What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be\r\ntalked to about it, and entreated and supplicated never to do so\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I might have scolded,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cif either of you had been\r\nsitting down alone; but while you do wrong together, I can overlook a\r\ngreat deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey cannot have been sitting long,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Grant, \xe2\x80\x9cfor when I\r\nwent up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window, and then\r\nthey were walking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd really,\xe2\x80\x9d added Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cthe day is so mild, that your sitting down\r\nfor a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent. Our weather must not\r\nalways be judged by the calendar. We may sometimes take greater\r\nliberties in November than in May.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Crawford, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are two of the most\r\ndisappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with! There is no\r\ngiving you a moment\xe2\x80\x99s uneasiness. You do not know how much we have been\r\nsuffering, nor what chills we have felt! But I have long thought Mr.\r\nBertram one of the worst subjects to work on, in any little manoeuvre\r\nagainst common sense, that a woman could be plagued with. I had very\r\nlittle hope of _him_ from the first; but you, Mrs. Grant, my sister, my\r\nown sister, I think I had a right to alarm you a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not flatter yourself, my dearest Mary. You have not the smallest\r\nchance of moving me. I have my alarms, but they are quite in a\r\ndifferent quarter; and if I could have altered the weather, you would\r\nhave had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time\xe2\x80\x94for here\r\nare some of my plants which Robert _will_ leave out because the nights\r\nare so mild, and I know the end of it will be, that we shall have a\r\nsudden change of weather, a hard frost setting in all at once, taking\r\neverybody (at least Robert) by surprise, and I shall lose every one;\r\nand what is worse, cook has just been telling me that the turkey, which\r\nI particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday, because I know how\r\nmuch more Dr. Grant would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the\r\nday, will not keep beyond to-morrow. These are something like\r\ngrievances, and make me think the weather most unseasonably close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sweets of housekeeping in a country village!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford\r\narchly. \xe2\x80\x9cCommend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St.\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s, and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you\r\ncould be. But we have no such people in Mansfield. What would you have\r\nme do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you can do nothing but what you do already: be plagued very often,\r\nand never lose your temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations, Mary, live\r\nwhere we may; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you, I\r\ndare say I shall find you with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and\r\nthe poulterer, perhaps on their very account. Their remoteness and\r\nunpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds, will be drawing\r\nforth bitter lamentations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort. A\r\nlarge income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of. It\r\ncertainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou intend to be very rich?\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, with a look which, to\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s eye, had a great deal of serious meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure. Do not you? Do not we all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my\r\npower to command. Miss Crawford may chuse her degree of wealth. She has\r\nonly to fix on her number of thousands a year, and there can be no\r\ndoubt of their coming. My intentions are only not to be poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy moderation and economy, and bringing down your wants to your\r\nincome, and all that. I understand you\xe2\x80\x94and a very proper plan it is for\r\na person at your time of life, with such limited means and indifferent\r\nconnexions. What can _you_ want but a decent maintenance? You have not\r\nmuch time before you; and your relations are in no situation to do\r\nanything for you, or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth\r\nand consequence. Be honest and poor, by all means\xe2\x80\x94but I shall not envy\r\nyou; I do not much think I shall even respect you. I have a much\r\ngreater respect for those that are honest and rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour degree of respect for honesty, rich or poor, is precisely what I\r\nhave no manner of concern with. I do not mean to be poor. Poverty is\r\nexactly what I have determined against. Honesty, in the something\r\nbetween, in the middle state of worldly circumstances, is all that I am\r\nanxious for your not looking down on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do look down upon it, if it might have been higher. I must look\r\ndown upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to\r\ndistinction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how may it rise? How may my honesty at least rise to any\r\ndistinction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was not so very easy a question to answer, and occasioned an \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nof some length from the fair lady before she could add, \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to\r\nbe in parliament, or you should have gone into the army ten years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That_ is not much to the purpose now; and as to my being in\r\nparliament, I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly\r\nfor the representation of younger sons who have little to live on. No,\r\nMiss Crawford,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a more serious tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthere _are_\r\ndistinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without\r\nany chance\xe2\x80\x94absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthey are of a different character.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA look of consciousness as he spoke, and what seemed a consciousness of\r\nmanner on Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s side as she made some laughing answer, was\r\nsorrowfull food for Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s observation; and finding herself quite\r\nunable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose side she was now\r\nfollowing the others, she had nearly resolved on going home\r\nimmediately, and only waited for courage to say so, when the sound of\r\nthe great clock at Mansfield Park, striking three, made her feel that\r\nshe had really been much longer absent than usual, and brought the\r\nprevious self-inquiry of whether she should take leave or not just\r\nthen, and how, to a very speedy issue. With undoubting decision she\r\ndirectly began her adieus; and Edmund began at the same time to\r\nrecollect that his mother had been inquiring for her, and that he had\r\nwalked down to the Parsonage on purpose to bring her back.\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s hurry increased; and without in the least expecting Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattendance, she would have hastened away alone; but the general pace\r\nwas quickened, and they all accompanied her into the house, through\r\nwhich it was necessary to pass. Dr. Grant was in the vestibule, and as\r\nthey stopt to speak to him she found, from Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s manner, that he\r\n_did_ mean to go with her. He too was taking leave. She could not but\r\nbe thankful. In the moment of parting, Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant\r\nto eat his mutton with him the next day; and Fanny had barely time for\r\nan unpleasant feeling on the occasion, when Mrs. Grant, with sudden\r\nrecollection, turned to her and asked for the pleasure of her company\r\ntoo. This was so new an attention, so perfectly new a circumstance in\r\nthe events of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s life, that she was all surprise and\r\nembarrassment; and while stammering out her great obligation, and her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut she did not suppose it would be in her power,\xe2\x80\x9d was looking at\r\nEdmund for his opinion and help. But Edmund, delighted with her having\r\nsuch an happiness offered, and ascertaining with half a look, and half\r\na sentence, that she had no objection but on her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s account, could\r\nnot imagine that his mother would make any difficulty of sparing her,\r\nand therefore gave his decided open advice that the invitation should\r\nbe accepted; and though Fanny would not venture, even on his\r\nencouragement, to such a flight of audacious independence, it was soon\r\nsettled, that if nothing were heard to the contrary, Mrs. Grant might\r\nexpect her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know what your dinner will be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Grant, smiling\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nturkey, and I assure you a very fine one; for, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d turning to her\r\nhusband, \xe2\x80\x9ccook insists upon the turkey\xe2\x80\x99s being dressed to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dr. Grant, \xe2\x80\x9call the better; I am glad to\r\nhear you have anything so good in the house. But Miss Price and Mr.\r\nEdmund Bertram, I dare say, would take their chance. We none of us want\r\nto hear the bill of fare. A friendly meeting, and not a fine dinner, is\r\nall we have in view. A turkey, or a goose, or a leg of mutton, or\r\nwhatever you and your cook chuse to give us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two cousins walked home together; and, except in the immediate\r\ndiscussion of this engagement, which Edmund spoke of with the warmest\r\nsatisfaction, as so particularly desirable for her in the intimacy\r\nwhich he saw with so much pleasure established, it was a silent walk;\r\nfor having finished that subject, he grew thoughtful and indisposed for\r\nany other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram. \xe2\x80\x9cHow came she\r\nto think of asking Fanny? Fanny never dines there, you know, in this\r\nsort of way. I cannot spare her, and I am sure she does not want to go.\r\nFanny, you do not want to go, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you put such a question to her,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Edmund, preventing his\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s speaking, \xe2\x80\x9cFanny will immediately say No; but I am sure, my\r\ndear mother, she would like to go; and I can see no reason why she\r\nshould not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her? She never\r\ndid before. She used to ask your sisters now and then, but she never\r\nasked Fanny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you cannot do without me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, in a self-denying\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my mother will have my father with her all the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, so I shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you take my father\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well thought of. So I will, Edmund. I will ask Sir Thomas, as\r\nsoon as he comes in, whether I can do without her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, on that head; but I meant my father\xe2\x80\x99s opinion as\r\nto the _propriety_ of the invitation\xe2\x80\x99s being accepted or not; and I\r\nthink he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant, as well as by\r\nFanny, that being the _first_ invitation it should be accepted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. We will ask him. But he will be very much surprised\r\nthat Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to be said, or that could be said to any\r\npurpose, till Sir Thomas were present; but the subject involving, as it\r\ndid, her own evening\xe2\x80\x99s comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in\r\nLady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s mind, that half an hour afterwards, on his looking in\r\nfor a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing-room, she\r\ncalled him back again, when he had almost closed the door, with \xe2\x80\x9cSir\r\nThomas, stop a moment\xe2\x80\x94I have something to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tone of calm languor, for she never took the trouble of raising her\r\nvoice, was always heard and attended to; and Sir Thomas came back. Her\r\nstory began; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room; for to hear\r\nherself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her\r\nnerves could bear. She was anxious, she knew\xe2\x80\x94more anxious perhaps than\r\nshe ought to be\xe2\x80\x94for what was it after all whether she went or staid?\r\nbut if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding, and\r\nwith very grave looks, and those grave looks directed to her, and at\r\nlast decide against her, she might not be able to appear properly\r\nsubmissive and indifferent. Her cause, meanwhile, went on well. It\r\nbegan, on Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s part, with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have something to tell you that\r\nwill surprise you. Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Thomas, as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdmund wants her to go. But how can I spare her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will be late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Thomas, taking out his watch; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what is\r\nyour difficulty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up the blanks in his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s story. He told the whole; and she had only to add, \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nstrange! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it not very natural,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mrs. Grant should\r\nwish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing can be more natural,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Thomas, after a short\r\ndeliberation; \xe2\x80\x9cnor, were there no sister in the case, could anything,\r\nin my opinion, be more natural. Mrs. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s shewing civility to Miss\r\nPrice, to Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s niece, could never want explanation. The only\r\nsurprise I can feel is, that this should be the _first_ time of its\r\nbeing paid. Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional\r\nanswer. She appears to feel as she ought. But as I conclude that she\r\nmust wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can see\r\nno reason why she should be denied the indulgence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut can I do without her, Sir Thomas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I think you may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend the day with us,\r\nand I shall certainly be at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe good news soon followed her. Edmund knocked at her door in his way\r\nto his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Fanny, it is all happily settled, and without the smallest\r\nhesitation on your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s side. He had but one opinion. You are to\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, I am _so_ glad,\xe2\x80\x9d was Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s instinctive reply; though when\r\nshe had turned from him and shut the door, she could not help feeling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet why should I be glad? for am I not certain of seeing or\r\nhearing something there to pain me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of this conviction, however, she was glad. Simple as such an\r\nengagement might appear in other eyes, it had novelty and importance in\r\nhers, for excepting the day at Sotherton, she had scarcely ever dined\r\nout before; and though now going only half a mile, and only to three\r\npeople, still it was dining out, and all the little interests of\r\npreparation were enjoyments in themselves. She had neither sympathy nor\r\nassistance from those who ought to have entered into her feelings and\r\ndirected her taste; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to\r\nanybody, and Mrs. Norris, when she came on the morrow, in consequence\r\nof an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas, was in a very ill\r\nhumour, and seemed intent only on lessening her niece\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure, both\r\npresent and future, as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, Fanny, you are in high luck to meet with such attention\r\nand indulgence! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for\r\nthinking of you, and to your aunt for letting you go, and you ought to\r\nlook upon it as something extraordinary; for I hope you are aware that\r\nthere is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of\r\nway, or ever dining out at all; and it is what you must not depend upon\r\never being repeated. Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is\r\nmeant as any particular compliment to _you_; the compliment is intended\r\nto your uncle and aunt and me. Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to\r\n_us_ to take a little notice of you, or else it would never have come\r\ninto her head, and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia\r\nhad been at home, you would not have been asked at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s part of\r\nthe favour, that Fanny, who found herself expected to speak, could only\r\nsay that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her,\r\nand that she was endeavouring to put her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s evening work in such a\r\nstate as to prevent her being missed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! depend upon it, your aunt can do very well without you, or you\r\nwould not be allowed to go. _I_ shall be here, so you may be quite easy\r\nabout your aunt. And I hope you will have a very _agreeable_ day, and\r\nfind it all mighty _delightful_. But I must observe that five is the\r\nvery awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table; and I\r\ncannot but be surprised that such an _elegant_ lady as Mrs. Grant\r\nshould not contrive better! And round their enormous great wide table,\r\ntoo, which fills up the room so dreadfully! Had the doctor been\r\ncontented to take my dining-table when I came away, as anybody in their\r\nsenses would have done, instead of having that absurd new one of his\r\nown, which is wider, literally wider than the dinner-table here, how\r\ninfinitely better it would have been! and how much more he would have\r\nbeen respected! for people are never respected when they step out of\r\ntheir proper sphere. Remember that, Fanny. Five\xe2\x80\x94only five to be sitting\r\nround that table. However, you will have dinner enough on it for ten, I\r\ndare say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris fetched breath, and went on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nonsense and folly of people\xe2\x80\x99s stepping out of their rank and\r\ntrying to appear above themselves, makes me think it right to give\r\n_you_ a hint, Fanny, now that you are going into company without any of\r\nus; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself\r\nforward, and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your\r\ncousins\xe2\x80\x94as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia. _That_ will never\r\ndo, believe me. Remember, wherever you are, you must be the lowest and\r\nlast; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage,\r\nyou are not to be taking place of her. And as to coming away at night,\r\nyou are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses. Leave him to settle\r\n_that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I should not think of anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it should rain, which I think exceedingly likely, for I never\r\nsaw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life, you must manage\r\nas well as you can, and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for\r\nyou. I certainly do not go home to-night, and, therefore, the carriage\r\nwill not be out on my account; so you must make up your mind to what\r\nmay happen, and take your things accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer niece thought it perfectly reasonable. She rated her own claims to\r\ncomfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could; and when Sir Thomas soon\r\nafterwards, just opening the door, said, \xe2\x80\x9cFanny, at what time would you\r\nhave the carriage come round?\xe2\x80\x9d she felt a degree of astonishment which\r\nmade it impossible for her to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Sir Thomas!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, red with anger, \xe2\x80\x9cFanny can\r\nwalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Sir Thomas, in a tone of most unanswerable dignity,\r\nand coming farther into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cMy niece walk to a dinner engagement\r\nat this time of the year! Will twenty minutes after four suit you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d was Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s humble answer, given with the feelings almost\r\nof a criminal towards Mrs. Norris; and not bearing to remain with her\r\nin what might seem a state of triumph, she followed her uncle out of\r\nthe room, having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words\r\nspoken in angry agitation\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite unnecessary! a great deal too kind! But Edmund goes; true, it is\r\nupon Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s account. I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this could not impose on Fanny. She felt that the carriage was for\r\nherself, and herself alone: and her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of her,\r\ncoming immediately after such representations from her aunt, cost her\r\nsome tears of gratitude when she was alone.\r\n\r\nThe coachman drove round to a minute; another minute brought down the\r\ngentleman; and as the lady had, with a most scrupulous fear of being\r\nlate, been many minutes seated in the drawing-room, Sir Thomas saw them\r\noff in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I must look at you, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, with the kind smile of an\r\naffectionate brother, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell you how I like you; and as well as I\r\ncan judge by this light, you look very nicely indeed. What have you got\r\non?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarriage. I hope it is not too fine; but I thought I ought to wear it\r\nas soon as I could, and that I might not have such another opportunity\r\nall the winter. I hope you do not think me too fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman can never be too fine while she is all in white. No, I see no\r\nfinery about you; nothing but what is perfectly proper. Your gown seems\r\nvery pretty. I like these glossy spots. Has not Miss Crawford a gown\r\nsomething the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable-yard and\r\ncoach-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeyday!\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s company, here\xe2\x80\x99s a carriage! who have\r\nthey got to meet us?\xe2\x80\x9d And letting down the side-glass to distinguish,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s, Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s barouche, I protest! There are his own two\r\nmen pushing it back into its old quarters. He is here, of course. This\r\nis quite a surprise, Fanny. I shall be very glad to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no occasion, there was no time for Fanny to say how very\r\ndifferently she felt; but the idea of having such another to observe\r\nher was a great increase of the trepidation with which she performed\r\nthe very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room Mr. Crawford certainly was, having been just long\r\nenough arrived to be ready for dinner; and the smiles and pleased looks\r\nof the three others standing round him, shewed how welcome was his\r\nsudden resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath. A\r\nvery cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund; and with the\r\nexception of Fanny, the pleasure was general; and even to _her_ there\r\nmight be some advantage in his presence, since every addition to the\r\nparty must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to\r\nsit silent and unattended to. She was soon aware of this herself; for\r\nthough she must submit, as her own propriety of mind directed, in spite\r\nof her aunt Norris\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, to being the principal lady in company,\r\nand to all the little distinctions consequent thereon, she found, while\r\nthey were at table, such a happy flow of conversation prevailing, in\r\nwhich she was not required to take any part\xe2\x80\x94there was so much to be\r\nsaid between the brother and sister about Bath, so much between the two\r\nyoung men about hunting, so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and\r\nDr. Grant, and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and\r\nMrs. Grant, as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to\r\nlisten in quiet, and of passing a very agreeable day. She could not\r\ncompliment the newly arrived gentleman, however, with any appearance of\r\ninterest, in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield, and sending\r\nfor his hunters from Norfolk, which, suggested by Dr. Grant, advised by\r\nEdmund, and warmly urged by the two sisters, was soon in possession of\r\nhis mind, and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her to\r\nresolve on. Her opinion was sought as to the probable continuance of\r\nthe open weather, but her answers were as short and indifferent as\r\ncivility allowed. She could not wish him to stay, and would much rather\r\nnot have him speak to her.\r\n\r\nHer two absent cousins, especially Maria, were much in her thoughts on\r\nseeing him; but no embarrassing remembrance affected _his_ spirits.\r\nHere he was again on the same ground where all had passed before, and\r\napparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams,\r\nas if he had never known Mansfield in any other state. She heard them\r\nspoken of by him only in a general way, till they were all re-assembled\r\nin the drawing-room, when Edmund, being engaged apart in some matter of\r\nbusiness with Dr. Grant, which seemed entirely to engross them, and\r\nMrs. Grant occupied at the tea-table, he began talking of them with\r\nmore particularity to his other sister. With a significant smile, which\r\nmade Fanny quite hate him, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo! Rushworth and his fair bride\r\nare at Brighton, I understand; happy man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they have been there about a fortnight, Miss Price, have they\r\nnot? And Julia is with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Yates, I presume, is not far off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Yates! Oh! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates. I do not imagine he\r\nfigures much in the letters to Mansfield Park; do you, Miss Price? I\r\nthink my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with\r\nMr. Yates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Rushworth and his two-and-forty speeches!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Crawford.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody can ever forget them. Poor fellow! I see him now\xe2\x80\x94his toil and\r\nhis despair. Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever\r\nwant him to make two-and-forty speeches to her\xe2\x80\x9d; adding, with a\r\nmomentary seriousness, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is too good for him\xe2\x80\x94much too good.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen changing his tone again to one of gentle gallantry, and addressing\r\nFanny, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou were Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s best friend. Your kindness\r\nand patience can never be forgotten, your indefatigable patience in\r\ntrying to make it possible for him to learn his part\xe2\x80\x94in trying to give\r\nhim a brain which nature had denied\xe2\x80\x94to mix up an understanding for him\r\nout of the superfluity of your own! _He_ might not have sense enough\r\nhimself to estimate your kindness, but I may venture to say that it had\r\nhonour from all the rest of the party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny coloured, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as a dream, a pleasant dream!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, breaking forth\r\nagain, after a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 musing. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall always look back on our\r\ntheatricals with exquisite pleasure. There was such an interest, such\r\nan animation, such a spirit diffused. Everybody felt it. We were all\r\nalive. There was employment, hope, solicitude, bustle, for every hour\r\nof the day. Always some little objection, some little doubt, some\r\nlittle anxiety to be got over. I never was happier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cNever\r\nhappier!\xe2\x80\x94never happier than when doing what you must know was not\r\njustifiable!\xe2\x80\x94never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and\r\nunfeelingly! Oh! what a corrupted mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were unlucky, Miss Price,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, in a lower tone, to avoid\r\nthe possibility of being heard by Edmund, and not at all aware of her\r\nfeelings, \xe2\x80\x9cwe certainly were very unlucky. Another week, only one other\r\nweek, would have been enough for us. I think if we had had the disposal\r\nof events\xe2\x80\x94if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just\r\nfor a week or two, about the equinox, there would have been a\r\ndifference. Not that we would have endangered his safety by any\r\ntremendous weather\xe2\x80\x94but only by a steady contrary wind, or a calm. I\r\nthink, Miss Price, we would have indulged ourselves with a week\xe2\x80\x99s calm\r\nin the Atlantic at that season.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed determined to be answered; and Fanny, averting her face,\r\nsaid, with a firmer tone than usual, \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as _I_ am concerned, sir,\r\nI would not have delayed his return for a day. My uncle disapproved it\r\nall so entirely when he did arrive, that in my opinion everything had\r\ngone quite far enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before, and\r\nnever so angrily to any one; and when her speech was over, she trembled\r\nand blushed at her own daring. He was surprised; but after a few\r\nmoments\xe2\x80\x99 silent consideration of her, replied in a calmer, graver tone,\r\nand as if the candid result of conviction, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you are right. It\r\nwas more pleasant than prudent. We were getting too noisy.\xe2\x80\x9d And then\r\nturning the conversation, he would have engaged her on some other\r\nsubject, but her answers were so shy and reluctant that he could not\r\nadvance in any.\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford, who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund, now\r\nobserved, \xe2\x80\x9cThose gentlemen must have some very interesting point to\r\ndiscuss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe most interesting in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her brother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chow to make\r\nmoney; how to turn a good income into a better. Dr. Grant is giving\r\nBertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon. I\r\nfind he takes orders in a few weeks. They were at it in the\r\ndining-parlour. I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off. He will\r\nhave a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with, and earned\r\nwithout much trouble. I apprehend he will not have less than seven\r\nhundred a year. Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger\r\nbrother; and as of course he will still live at home, it will be all\r\nfor his _menus_ _plaisirs_; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter, I\r\nsuppose, will be the sum total of sacrifice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing amuses\r\nme more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance\r\nof those who have a great deal less than themselves. You would look\r\nrather blank, Henry, if your _menus_ _plaisirs_ were to be limited to\r\nseven hundred a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I might; but all _that_ you know is entirely comparative.\r\nBirthright and habit must settle the business. Bertram is certainly\r\nwell off for a cadet of even a baronet\xe2\x80\x99s family. By the time he is four\r\nor five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year, and nothing to do\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford _could_ have said that there would be a something to do\r\nand to suffer for it, which she could not think lightly of; but she\r\nchecked herself and let it pass; and tried to look calm and unconcerned\r\nwhen the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBertram,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Crawford, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall make a point of coming to\r\nMansfield to hear you preach your first sermon. I shall come on purpose\r\nto encourage a young beginner. When is it to be? Miss Price, will not\r\nyou join me in encouraging your cousin? Will not you engage to attend\r\nwith your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time\xe2\x80\x94as I shall do\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nto lose a word; or only looking off just to note down any sentence\r\npreeminently beautiful? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a\r\npencil. When will it be? You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that\r\nSir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be more\r\nsorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he not feel this?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Fanny. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he can feel nothing as he\r\nought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe party being now all united, and the chief talkers attracting each\r\nother, she remained in tranquillity; and as a whist-table was formed\r\nafter tea\xe2\x80\x94formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by his\r\nattentive wife, though it was not to be supposed so\xe2\x80\x94and Miss Crawford\r\ntook her harp, she had nothing to do but to listen; and her\r\ntranquillity remained undisturbed the rest of the evening, except when\r\nMr. Crawford now and then addressed to her a question or observation,\r\nwhich she could not avoid answering. Miss Crawford was too much vexed\r\nby what had passed to be in a humour for anything but music. With that\r\nshe soothed herself and amused her friend.\r\n\r\nThe assurance of Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s being so soon to take orders, coming upon her\r\nlike a blow that had been suspended, and still hoped uncertain and at a\r\ndistance, was felt with resentment and mortification. She was very\r\nangry with him. She had thought her influence more. She _had_ begun to\r\nthink of him; she felt that she had, with great regard, with almost\r\ndecided intentions; but she would now meet him with his own cool\r\nfeelings. It was plain that he could have no serious views, no true\r\nattachment, by fixing himself in a situation which he must know she\r\nwould never stoop to. She would learn to match him in his indifference.\r\nShe would henceforth admit his attentions without any idea beyond\r\nimmediate amusement. If _he_ could so command his affections, _hers_\r\nshould do her no harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Crawford had quite made up his mind by the next morning to give\r\nanother fortnight to Mansfield, and having sent for his hunters, and\r\nwritten a few lines of explanation to the Admiral, he looked round at\r\nhis sister as he sealed and threw the letter from him, and seeing the\r\ncoast clear of the rest of the family, said, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do\r\nyou think I mean to amuse myself, Mary, on the days that I do not hunt?\r\nI am grown too old to go out more than three times a week; but I have a\r\nplan for the intermediate days, and what do you think it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo walk and ride with me, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly, though I shall be happy to do both, but _that_ would be\r\nexercise only to my body, and I must take care of my mind. Besides,\r\n_that_ would be all recreation and indulgence, without the wholesome\r\nalloy of labour, and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness. No, my\r\nplan is to make Fanny Price in love with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny Price! Nonsense! No, no. You ought to be satisfied with her two\r\ncousins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price, without making a small\r\nhole in Fanny Price\xe2\x80\x99s heart. You do not seem properly aware of her\r\nclaims to notice. When we talked of her last night, you none of you\r\nseemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in\r\nher looks within the last six weeks. You see her every day, and\r\ntherefore do not notice it; but I assure you she is quite a different\r\ncreature from what she was in the autumn. She was then merely a quiet,\r\nmodest, not plain-looking girl, but she is now absolutely pretty. I\r\nused to think she had neither complexion nor countenance; but in that\r\nsoft skin of hers, so frequently tinged with a blush as it was\r\nyesterday, there is decided beauty; and from what I observed of her\r\neyes and mouth, I do not despair of their being capable of expression\r\nenough when she has anything to express. And then, her air, her manner,\r\nher _tout_ _ensemble_, is so indescribably improved! She must be grown\r\ntwo inches, at least, since October.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhoo! phoo! This is only because there were no tall women to compare\r\nher with, and because she has got a new gown, and you never saw her so\r\nwell dressed before. She is just what she was in October, believe me.\r\nThe truth is, that she was the only girl in company for you to notice,\r\nand you must have a somebody. I have always thought her pretty\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nstrikingly pretty\xe2\x80\x94but \xe2\x80\x98pretty enough,\xe2\x80\x99 as people say; a sort of beauty\r\nthat grows on one. Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet\r\nsmile; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it\r\nmay all be resolved into a better style of dress, and your having\r\nnobody else to look at; and therefore, if you do set about a flirtation\r\nwith her, you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her\r\nbeauty, or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and\r\nfolly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer brother gave only a smile to this accusation, and soon afterwards\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny. I do not\r\nunderstand her. I could not tell what she would be at yesterday. What\r\nis her character? Is she solemn? Is she queer? Is she prudish? Why did\r\nshe draw back and look so grave at me? I could hardly get her to speak.\r\nI never was so long in company with a girl in my life, trying to\r\nentertain her, and succeed so ill! Never met with a girl who looked so\r\ngrave on me! I must try to get the better of this. Her looks say, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwill not like you, I am determined not to like you\xe2\x80\x99; and I say she\r\nshall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoolish fellow! And so this is her attraction after all! This it is,\r\nher not caring about you, which gives her such a soft skin, and makes\r\nher so much taller, and produces all these charms and graces! I do\r\ndesire that you will not be making her really unhappy; a _little_ love,\r\nperhaps, may animate and do her good, but I will not have you plunge\r\nher deep, for she is as good a little creature as ever lived, and has a\r\ngreat deal of feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can be but for a fortnight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry; \xe2\x80\x9cand if a fortnight can\r\nkill her, she must have a constitution which nothing could save. No, I\r\nwill not do her any harm, dear little soul! I only want her to look\r\nkindly on me, to give me smiles as well as blushes, to keep a chair for\r\nme by herself wherever we are, and be all animation when I take it and\r\ntalk to her; to think as I think, be interested in all my possessions\r\nand pleasures, try to keep me longer at Mansfield, and feel when I go\r\naway that she shall be never happy again. I want nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cModeration itself!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI can have no scruples now. Well, you\r\nwill have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself,\r\nfor we are a great deal together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left Fanny to her\r\nfate, a fate which, had not Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s heart been guarded in a way\r\nunsuspected by Miss Crawford, might have been a little harder than she\r\ndeserved; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young\r\nladies of eighteen (or one should not read about them) as are never to\r\nbe persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent,\r\nmanner, attention, and flattery can do, I have no inclination to\r\nbelieve Fanny one of them, or to think that with so much tenderness of\r\ndisposition, and so much taste as belonged to her, she could have\r\nescaped heart-whole from the courtship (though the courtship only of a\r\nfortnight) of such a man as Crawford, in spite of there being some\r\nprevious ill opinion of him to be overcome, had not her affection been\r\nengaged elsewhere. With all the security which love of another and\r\ndisesteem of him could give to the peace of mind he was attacking, his\r\ncontinued attentions\xe2\x80\x94continued, but not obtrusive, and adapting\r\nthemselves more and more to the gentleness and delicacy of her\r\ncharacter\xe2\x80\x94obliged her very soon to dislike him less than formerly. She\r\nhad by no means forgotten the past, and she thought as ill of him as\r\never; but she felt his powers: he was entertaining; and his manners\r\nwere so improved, so polite, so seriously and blamelessly polite, that\r\nit was impossible not to be civil to him in return.\r\n\r\nA very few days were enough to effect this; and at the end of those few\r\ndays, circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward his\r\nviews of pleasing her, inasmuch as they gave her a degree of happiness\r\nwhich must dispose her to be pleased with everybody. William, her\r\nbrother, the so long absent and dearly loved brother, was in England\r\nagain. She had a letter from him herself, a few hurried happy lines,\r\nwritten as the ship came up Channel, and sent into Portsmouth with the\r\nfirst boat that left the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead; and when\r\nCrawford walked up with the newspaper in his hand, which he had hoped\r\nwould bring the first tidings, he found her trembling with joy over\r\nthis letter, and listening with a glowing, grateful countenance to the\r\nkind invitation which her uncle was most collectedly dictating in\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nIt was but the day before that Crawford had made himself thoroughly\r\nmaster of the subject, or had in fact become at all aware of her having\r\nsuch a brother, or his being in such a ship, but the interest then\r\nexcited had been very properly lively, determining him on his return to\r\ntown to apply for information as to the probable period of the\r\nAntwerp\xe2\x80\x99s return from the Mediterranean, etc.; and the good luck which\r\nattended his early examination of ship news the next morning seemed the\r\nreward of his ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her,\r\nas well as of his dutiful attention to the Admiral, in having for many\r\nyears taken in the paper esteemed to have the earliest naval\r\nintelligence. He proved, however, to be too late. All those fine first\r\nfeelings, of which he had hoped to be the exciter, were already given.\r\nBut his intention, the kindness of his intention, was thankfully\r\nacknowledged: quite thankfully and warmly, for she was elevated beyond\r\nthe common timidity of her mind by the flow of her love for William.\r\n\r\nThis dear William would soon be amongst them. There could be no doubt\r\nof his obtaining leave of absence immediately, for he was still only a\r\nmidshipman; and as his parents, from living on the spot, must already\r\nhave seen him, and be seeing him perhaps daily, his direct holidays\r\nmight with justice be instantly given to the sister, who had been his\r\nbest correspondent through a period of seven years, and the uncle who\r\nhad done most for his support and advancement; and accordingly the\r\nreply to her reply, fixing a very early day for his arrival, came as\r\nsoon as possible; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been\r\nin the agitation of her first dinner-visit, when she found herself in\r\nan agitation of a higher nature, watching in the hall, in the lobby, on\r\nthe stairs, for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her\r\na brother.\r\n\r\nIt came happily while she was thus waiting; and there being neither\r\nceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting, she was with\r\nhim as he entered the house, and the first minutes of exquisite feeling\r\nhad no interruption and no witnesses, unless the servants chiefly\r\nintent upon opening the proper doors could be called such. This was\r\nexactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at, as\r\neach proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they\r\nboth advised Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s continuing where she was, instead of rushing\r\nout into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Fanny soon shewed themselves; and Sir Thomas had the\r\npleasure of receiving, in his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, certainly a very different\r\nperson from the one he had equipped seven years ago, but a young man of\r\nan open, pleasant countenance, and frank, unstudied, but feeling and\r\nrespectful manners, and such as confirmed him his friend.\r\n\r\nIt was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating happiness of\r\nsuch an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation,\r\nand the first of fruition; it was some time even before her happiness\r\ncould be said to make her happy, before the disappointment inseparable\r\nfrom the alteration of person had vanished, and she could see in him\r\nthe same William as before, and talk to him, as her heart had been\r\nyearning to do through many a past year. That time, however, did\r\ngradually come, forwarded by an affection on his side as warm as her\r\nown, and much less encumbered by refinement or self-distrust. She was\r\nthe first object of his love, but it was a love which his stronger\r\nspirits, and bolder temper, made it as natural for him to express as to\r\nfeel. On the morrow they were walking about together with true\r\nenjoyment, and every succeeding morrow renewed a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ which\r\nSir Thomas could not but observe with complacency, even before Edmund\r\nhad pointed it out to him.\r\n\r\nExcepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked or\r\nunlooked-for instance of Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of her in the last few\r\nmonths had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life,\r\nas in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother and\r\nfriend who was opening all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes\r\nand fears, plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of,\r\ndearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion; who could give\r\nher direct and minute information of the father and mother, brothers\r\nand sisters, of whom she very seldom heard; who was interested in all\r\nthe comforts and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield;\r\nready to think of every member of that home as she directed, or\r\ndiffering only by a less scrupulous opinion, and more noisy abuse of\r\ntheir aunt Norris, and with whom (perhaps the dearest indulgence of the\r\nwhole) all the evil and good of their earliest years could be gone over\r\nagain, and every former united pain and pleasure retraced with the\r\nfondest recollection. An advantage this, a strengthener of love, in\r\nwhich even the conjugal tie is beneath the fraternal. Children of the\r\nsame family, the same blood, with the same first associations and\r\nhabits, have some means of enjoyment in their power, which no\r\nsubsequent connexions can supply; and it must be by a long and\r\nunnatural estrangement, by a divorce which no subsequent connexion can\r\njustify, if such precious remains of the earliest attachments are ever\r\nentirely outlived. Too often, alas! it is so. Fraternal love, sometimes\r\nalmost everything, is at others worse than nothing. But with William\r\nand Fanny Price it was still a sentiment in all its prime and\r\nfreshness, wounded by no opposition of interest, cooled by no separate\r\nattachment, and feeling the influence of time and absence only in its\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nAn affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion of all who\r\nhad hearts to value anything good. Henry Crawford was as much struck\r\nwith it as any. He honoured the warm-hearted, blunt fondness of the\r\nyoung sailor, which led him to say, with his hands stretched towards\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s head, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, I begin to like that queer fashion already,\r\nthough when I first heard of such things being done in England, I could\r\nnot believe it; and when Mrs. Brown, and the other women at the\r\nCommissioner\xe2\x80\x99s at Gibraltar, appeared in the same trim, I thought they\r\nwere mad; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything\xe2\x80\x9d; and saw, with lively\r\nadmiration, the glow of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s cheek, the brightness of her eye, the\r\ndeep interest, the absorbed attention, while her brother was describing\r\nany of the imminent hazards, or terrific scenes, which such a period at\r\nsea must supply.\r\n\r\nIt was a picture which Henry Crawford had moral taste enough to value.\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s attractions increased\xe2\x80\x94increased twofold; for the sensibility\r\nwhich beautified her complexion and illumined her countenance was an\r\nattraction in itself. He was no longer in doubt of the capabilities of\r\nher heart. She had feeling, genuine feeling. It would be something to\r\nbe loved by such a girl, to excite the first ardours of her young\r\nunsophisticated mind! She interested him more than he had foreseen. A\r\nfortnight was not enough. His stay became indefinite.\r\n\r\nWilliam was often called on by his uncle to be the talker. His recitals\r\nwere amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas, but the chief object in\r\nseeking them was to understand the reciter, to know the young man by\r\nhis histories; and he listened to his clear, simple, spirited details\r\nwith full satisfaction, seeing in them the proof of good principles,\r\nprofessional knowledge, energy, courage, and cheerfulness, everything\r\nthat could deserve or promise well. Young as he was, William had\r\nalready seen a great deal. He had been in the Mediterranean; in the\r\nWest Indies; in the Mediterranean again; had been often taken on shore\r\nby the favour of his captain, and in the course of seven years had\r\nknown every variety of danger which sea and war together could offer.\r\nWith such means in his power he had a right to be listened to; and\r\nthough Mrs. Norris could fidget about the room, and disturb everybody\r\nin quest of two needlefuls of thread or a second-hand shirt button, in\r\nthe midst of her nephew\xe2\x80\x99s account of a shipwreck or an engagement,\r\neverybody else was attentive; and even Lady Bertram could not hear of\r\nsuch horrors unmoved, or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her\r\nwork to say, \xe2\x80\x9cDear me! how disagreeable! I wonder anybody can ever go\r\nto sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Henry Crawford they gave a different feeling. He longed to have been\r\nat sea, and seen and done and suffered as much. His heart was warmed,\r\nhis fancy fired, and he felt the highest respect for a lad who, before\r\nhe was twenty, had gone through such bodily hardships and given such\r\nproofs of mind. The glory of heroism, of usefulness, of exertion, of\r\nendurance, made his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful\r\ncontrast; and he wished he had been a William Price, distinguishing\r\nhimself and working his way to fortune and consequence with so much\r\nself-respect and happy ardour, instead of what he was!\r\n\r\nThe wish was rather eager than lasting. He was roused from the reverie\r\nof retrospection and regret produced by it, by some inquiry from Edmund\r\nas to his plans for the next day\xe2\x80\x99s hunting; and he found it was as well\r\nto be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command.\r\nIn one respect it was better, as it gave him the means of conferring a\r\nkindness where he wished to oblige. With spirits, courage, and\r\ncuriosity up to anything, William expressed an inclination to hunt; and\r\nCrawford could mount him without the slightest inconvenience to\r\nhimself, and with only some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas, who knew\r\nbetter than his nephew the value of such a loan, and some alarms to\r\nreason away in Fanny. She feared for William; by no means convinced by\r\nall that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries,\r\nof the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged, the rough\r\nhorses and mules he had ridden, or his many narrow escapes from\r\ndreadful falls, that he was at all equal to the management of a\r\nhigh-fed hunter in an English fox-chase; nor till he returned safe and\r\nwell, without accident or discredit, could she be reconciled to the\r\nrisk, or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the\r\nhorse which he had fully intended it should produce. When it was\r\nproved, however, to have done William no harm, she could allow it to be\r\na kindness, and even reward the owner with a smile when the animal was\r\none minute tendered to his use again; and the next, with the greatest\r\ncordiality, and in a manner not to be resisted, made over to his use\r\nentirely so long as he remained in Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intercourse of the two families was at this period more nearly\r\nrestored to what it had been in the autumn, than any member of the old\r\nintimacy had thought ever likely to be again. The return of Henry\r\nCrawford, and the arrival of William Price, had much to do with it, but\r\nmuch was still owing to Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s more than toleration of the\r\nneighbourly attempts at the Parsonage. His mind, now disengaged from\r\nthe cares which had pressed on him at first, was at leisure to find the\r\nGrants and their young inmates really worth visiting; and though\r\ninfinitely above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous\r\nmatrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent\r\npossibilities of any one most dear to him, and disdaining even as a\r\nlittleness the being quick-sighted on such points, he could not avoid\r\nperceiving, in a grand and careless way, that Mr. Crawford was somewhat\r\ndistinguishing his niece\xe2\x80\x94nor perhaps refrain (though unconsciously)\r\nfrom giving a more willing assent to invitations on that account.\r\n\r\nHis readiness, however, in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage, when the\r\ngeneral invitation was at last hazarded, after many debates and many\r\ndoubts as to whether it were worth while, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause Sir Thomas seemed so\r\nill inclined, and Lady Bertram was so indolent!\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded from\r\ngood-breeding and goodwill alone, and had nothing to do with Mr.\r\nCrawford, but as being one in an agreeable group: for it was in the\r\ncourse of that very visit that he first began to think that any one in\r\nthe habit of such idle observations _would_ _have_ _thought_ that Mr.\r\nCrawford was the admirer of Fanny Price.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one, being composed in\r\na good proportion of those who would talk and those who would listen;\r\nand the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful, according to the usual\r\nstyle of the Grants, and too much according to the usual habits of all\r\nto raise any emotion except in Mrs. Norris, who could never behold\r\neither the wide table or the number of dishes on it with patience, and\r\nwho did always contrive to experience some evil from the passing of the\r\nservants behind her chair, and to bring away some fresh conviction of\r\nits being impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold.\r\n\r\nIn the evening it was found, according to the predetermination of Mrs.\r\nGrant and her sister, that after making up the whist-table there would\r\nremain sufficient for a round game, and everybody being as perfectly\r\ncomplying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are,\r\nspeculation was decided on almost as soon as whist; and Lady Bertram\r\nsoon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for\r\nher own choice between the games, and being required either to draw a\r\ncard for whist or not. She hesitated. Luckily Sir Thomas was at hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do, Sir Thomas? Whist and speculation; which will amuse\r\nme most?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought, recommended speculation. He was a\r\nwhist player himself, and perhaps might feel that it would not much\r\namuse him to have her for a partner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d was her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s contented answer; \xe2\x80\x9cthen speculation, if\r\nyou please, Mrs. Grant. I know nothing about it, but Fanny must teach\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations of her own\r\nequal ignorance; she had never played the game nor seen it played in\r\nher life; and Lady Bertram felt a moment\xe2\x80\x99s indecision again; but upon\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s assuring her that nothing could be so easy, that it was the\r\neasiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s stepping forward with a\r\nmost earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss\r\nPrice, and teach them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs.\r\nNorris, and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime\r\nintellectual state and dignity, the remaining six, under Miss\r\nCrawford\xe2\x80\x99s direction, were arranged round the other. It was a fine\r\narrangement for Henry Crawford, who was close to Fanny, and with his\r\nhands full of business, having two persons\xe2\x80\x99 cards to manage as well as\r\nhis own; for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself\r\nmistress of the rules of the game in three minutes, he had yet to\r\ninspirit her play, sharpen her avarice, and harden her heart, which,\r\nespecially in any competition with William, was a work of some\r\ndifficulty; and as for Lady Bertram, he must continue in charge of all\r\nher fame and fortune through the whole evening; and if quick enough to\r\nkeep her from looking at her cards when the deal began, must direct her\r\nin whatever was to be done with them to the end of it.\r\n\r\nHe was in high spirits, doing everything with happy ease, and\r\npreeminent in all the lively turns, quick resources, and playful\r\nimpudence that could do honour to the game; and the round table was\r\naltogether a very comfortable contrast to the steady sobriety and\r\norderly silence of the other.\r\n\r\nTwice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his\r\nlady, but in vain; no pause was long enough for the time his measured\r\nmanner needed; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs.\r\nGrant was able, at the end of the first rubber, to go to her and pay\r\nher compliments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope your ladyship is pleased with the game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, yes! very entertaining indeed. A very odd game. I do not know\r\nwhat it is all about. I am never to see my cards; and Mr. Crawford does\r\nall the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBertram,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crawford, some time afterwards, taking the opportunity\r\nof a little languor in the game, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never told you what happened\r\nto me yesterday in my ride home.\xe2\x80\x9d They had been hunting together, and\r\nwere in the midst of a good run, and at some distance from Mansfield,\r\nwhen his horse being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had\r\nbeen obliged to give up, and make the best of his way back. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you\r\nI lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew-trees,\r\nbecause I can never bear to ask; but I have not told you that, with my\r\nusual luck\xe2\x80\x94for I never do wrong without gaining by it\xe2\x80\x94I found myself in\r\ndue time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see. I was\r\nsuddenly, upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field, in the\r\nmidst of a retired little village between gently rising hills; a small\r\nstream before me to be forded, a church standing on a sort of knoll to\r\nmy right\xe2\x80\x94which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place,\r\nand not a gentleman or half a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s house to be seen excepting\r\none\xe2\x80\x94to be presumed the Parsonage\xe2\x80\x94within a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw of the said\r\nknoll and church. I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund; \xe2\x80\x9cbut which way did you turn after\r\npassing Sewell\xe2\x80\x99s farm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions; though were I to\r\nanswer all that you could put in the course of an hour, you would never\r\nbe able to prove that it was _not_ Thornton Lacey\xe2\x80\x94for such it certainly\r\nwas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou inquired, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I never inquire. But I _told_ a man mending a hedge that it was\r\nThornton Lacey, and he agreed to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a good memory. I had forgotten having ever told you half so\r\nmuch of the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThornton Lacey was the name of his impending living, as Miss Crawford\r\nwell knew; and her interest in a negotiation for William Price\xe2\x80\x99s knave\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cand how did you like what you saw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much indeed. You are a lucky fellow. There will be work for five\r\nsummers at least before the place is liveable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not so bad as that. The farmyard must be moved, I grant you;\r\nbut I am not aware of anything else. The house is by no means bad, and\r\nwhen the yard is removed, there may be a very tolerable approach to\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe farmyard must be cleared away entirely, and planted up to shut out\r\nthe blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s shop. The house must be turned to front the east\r\ninstead of the north\xe2\x80\x94the entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must be\r\non that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am sure it may be\r\ndone. And _there_ must be your approach, through what is at present the\r\ngarden. You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the\r\nhouse; which will be giving it the best aspect in the world, sloping to\r\nthe south-east. The ground seems precisely formed for it. I rode fifty\r\nyards up the lane, between the church and the house, in order to look\r\nabout me; and saw how it might all be. Nothing can be easier. The\r\nmeadows beyond what _will_ _be_ the garden, as well as what now _is_,\r\nsweeping round from the lane I stood in to the north-east, that is, to\r\nthe principal road through the village, must be all laid together, of\r\ncourse; very pretty meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber.\r\nThey belong to the living, I suppose; if not, you must purchase them.\r\nThen the stream\xe2\x80\x94something must be done with the stream; but I could not\r\nquite determine what. I had two or three ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have two or three ideas also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cand one of them is,\r\nthat very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in\r\npractice. I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty. I\r\nthink the house and premises may be made comfortable, and given the air\r\nof a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s residence, without any very heavy expense, and that\r\nmust suffice me; and, I hope, may suffice all who care about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford, a little suspicious and resentful of a certain tone of\r\nvoice, and a certain half-look attending the last expression of his\r\nhope, made a hasty finish of her dealings with William Price; and\r\nsecuring his knave at an exorbitant rate, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, I will\r\nstake my last like a woman of spirit. No cold prudence for me. I am not\r\nborn to sit still and do nothing. If I lose the game, it shall not be\r\nfrom not striving for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe game was hers, and only did not pay her for what she had given to\r\nsecure it. Another deal proceeded, and Crawford began again about\r\nThornton Lacey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy plan may not be the best possible: I had not many minutes to form\r\nit in; but you must do a good deal. The place deserves it, and you will\r\nfind yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of.\r\n(Excuse me, your ladyship must not see your cards. There, let them lie\r\njust before you.) The place deserves it, Bertram. You talk of giving it\r\nthe air of a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s residence. _That_ will be done by the removal\r\nof the farmyard; for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never\r\nsaw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s residence, so much the look of a something above a mere\r\nparsonage-house\xe2\x80\x94above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year. It is\r\nnot a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as\r\nwindows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square\r\nfarmhouse: it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as\r\none might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from\r\ngeneration to generation, through two centuries at least, and were now\r\nspending from two to three thousand a year in.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Crawford listened,\r\nand Edmund agreed to this. \xe2\x80\x9cThe air of a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s residence,\r\ntherefore, you cannot but give it, if you do anything. But it is\r\ncapable of much more. (Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for\r\nthat queen; no, no, a dozen is more than it is worth. Lady Bertram does\r\nnot bid a dozen. She will have nothing to say to it. Go on, go on.) By\r\nsome such improvements as I have suggested (I do not really require you\r\nto proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt anybody\xe2\x80\x99s striking\r\nout a better) you may give it a higher character. You may raise it into\r\na _place_. From being the mere gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s residence, it becomes, by\r\njudicious improvement, the residence of a man of education, taste,\r\nmodern manners, good connexions. All this may be stamped on it; and\r\nthat house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the\r\ngreat landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road;\r\nespecially as there is no real squire\xe2\x80\x99s house to dispute the point\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncircumstance, between ourselves, to enhance the value of such a\r\nsituation in point of privilege and independence beyond all\r\ncalculation. _You_ think with me, I hope\xe2\x80\x9d (turning with a softened\r\nvoice to Fanny). \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever seen the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny gave a quick negative, and tried to hide her interest in the\r\nsubject by an eager attention to her brother, who was driving as hard a\r\nbargain, and imposing on her as much as he could; but Crawford pursued\r\nwith \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, you must not part with the queen. You have bought her too\r\ndearly, and your brother does not offer half her value. No, no, sir,\r\nhands off, hands off. Your sister does not part with the queen. She is\r\nquite determined. The game will be yours,\xe2\x80\x9d turning to her again; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwill certainly be yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Fanny had much rather it were William\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, smiling at\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Fanny! not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bertram,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, a few minutes afterwards, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know\r\nHenry to be such a capital improver, that you cannot possibly engage in\r\nanything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help. Only\r\nthink how useful he was at Sotherton! Only think what grand things were\r\nproduced there by our all going with him one hot day in August to drive\r\nabout the grounds, and see his genius take fire. There we went, and\r\nthere we came home again; and what was done there is not to be told!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were turned on Crawford for a moment with an expression\r\nmore than grave\xe2\x80\x94even reproachful; but on catching his, were instantly\r\nwithdrawn. With something of consciousness he shook his head at his\r\nsister, and laughingly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say there was much done at\r\nSotherton; but it was a hot day, and we were all walking after each\r\nother, and bewildered.\xe2\x80\x9d As soon as a general buzz gave him shelter, he\r\nadded, in a low voice, directed solely at Fanny, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be sorry to\r\nhave my powers of _planning_ judged of by the day at Sotherton. I see\r\nthings very differently now. Do not think of me as I appeared then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris, and being just then in the\r\nhappy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncapital play and her own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s great hands, she\r\ncalled out, in high good-humour, \xe2\x80\x9cSotherton! Yes, that is a place,\r\nindeed, and we had a charming day there. William, you are quite out of\r\nluck; but the next time you come, I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth\r\nwill be at home, and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly\r\nreceived by both. Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their\r\nrelations, and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man. They are at\r\nBrighton now, you know; in one of the best houses there, as Mr.\r\nRushworth\xe2\x80\x99s fine fortune gives them a right to be. I do not exactly\r\nknow the distance, but when you get back to Portsmouth, if it is not\r\nvery far off, you ought to go over and pay your respects to them; and I\r\ncould send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your\r\ncousins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head;\r\nand if I could get so far, I could not expect to be welcome in such a\r\nsmart place as that\xe2\x80\x94poor scrubby midshipman as I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might\r\ndepend on, when she was stopped by Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s saying with authority,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not advise your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may\r\nsoon have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my daughters\r\nwould be happy to see their cousins anywhere; and you will find Mr.\r\nRushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our\r\nfamily as his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than\r\nanything else,\xe2\x80\x9d was William\xe2\x80\x99s only answer, in an undervoice, not meant\r\nto reach far, and the subject dropped.\r\n\r\nAs yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbehaviour; but when the whist-table broke up at the end of the second\r\nrubber, and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their\r\nlast play, he became a looker-on at the other, he found his niece the\r\nobject of attentions, or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointed\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nHenry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton\r\nLacey; and not being able to catch Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s ear, was detailing it to\r\nhis fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness. His scheme\r\nwas to rent the house himself the following winter, that he might have\r\na home of his own in that neighbourhood; and it was not merely for the\r\nuse of it in the hunting-season (as he was then telling her), though\r\n_that_ consideration had certainly some weight, feeling as he did that,\r\nin spite of all Dr. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s very great kindness, it was impossible for\r\nhim and his horses to be accommodated where they now were without\r\nmaterial inconvenience; but his attachment to that neighbourhood did\r\nnot depend upon one amusement or one season of the year: he had set his\r\nheart upon having a something there that he could come to at any time,\r\na little homestall at his command, where all the holidays of his year\r\nmight be spent, and he might find himself continuing, improving, and\r\n_perfecting_ that friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park\r\nfamily which was increasing in value to him every day. Sir Thomas heard\r\nand was not offended. There was no want of respect in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naddress; and Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s reception of it was so proper and modest, so calm\r\nand uninviting, that he had nothing to censure in her. She said little,\r\nassented only here and there, and betrayed no inclination either of\r\nappropriating any part of the compliment to herself, or of\r\nstrengthening his views in favour of Northamptonshire. Finding by whom\r\nhe was observed, Henry Crawford addressed himself on the same subject\r\nto Sir Thomas, in a more everyday tone, but still with feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be your neighbour, Sir Thomas, as you have, perhaps, heard\r\nme telling Miss Price. May I hope for your acquiescence, and for your\r\nnot influencing your son against such a tenant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas, politely bowing, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the only way, sir, in\r\nwhich I could _not_ wish you established as a permanent neighbour; but\r\nI hope, and believe, that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton\r\nLacey. Edmund, am I saying too much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund, on this appeal, had first to hear what was going on; but, on\r\nunderstanding the question, was at no loss for an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence. But, Crawford, though\r\nI refuse you as a tenant, come to me as a friend. Consider the house as\r\nhalf your own every winter, and we will add to the stables on your own\r\nimproved plan, and with all the improvements of your improved plan that\r\nmay occur to you this spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be the losers,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sir Thomas. \xe2\x80\x9cHis going, though only\r\neight miles, will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle; but\r\nI should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile\r\nhimself to doing less. It is perfectly natural that you should not have\r\nthought much on the subject, Mr. Crawford. But a parish has wants and\r\nclaims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident, and\r\nwhich no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent. Edmund\r\nmight, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he might\r\nread prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park: he might\r\nride over every Sunday, to a house nominally inhabited, and go through\r\ndivine service; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every\r\nseventh day, for three or four hours, if that would content him. But it\r\nwill not. He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly\r\nsermon can convey; and that if he does not live among his parishioners,\r\nand prove himself, by constant attention, their well-wisher and friend,\r\nhe does very little either for their good or his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford bowed his acquiescence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat again,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sir Thomas, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Thornton Lacey is the only\r\nhouse in the neighbourhood in which I should _not_ be happy to wait on\r\nMr. Crawford as occupier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford bowed his thanks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Thomas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, \xe2\x80\x9cundoubtedly understands the duty of a\r\nparish priest. We must hope his son may prove that _he_ knows it too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever effect Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s little harangue might really produce on\r\nMr. Crawford, it raised some awkward sensations in two of the others,\r\ntwo of his most attentive listeners\xe2\x80\x94Miss Crawford and Fanny. One of\r\nwhom, having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so\r\ncompletely to be his home, was pondering with downcast eyes on what it\r\nwould be _not_ to see Edmund every day; and the other, startled from\r\nthe agreeable fancies she had been previously indulging on the strength\r\nof her brother\xe2\x80\x99s description, no longer able, in the picture she had\r\nbeen forming of a future Thornton, to shut out the church, sink the\r\nclergyman, and see only the respectable, elegant, modernised, and\r\noccasional residence of a man of independent fortune, was considering\r\nSir Thomas, with decided ill-will, as the destroyer of all this, and\r\nsuffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his\r\ncharacter and manner commanded, and from not daring to relieve herself\r\nby a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause.\r\n\r\nAll the agreeable of _her_ speculation was over for that hour. It was\r\ntime to have done with cards, if sermons prevailed; and she was glad to\r\nfind it necessary to come to a conclusion, and be able to refresh her\r\nspirits by a change of place and neighbour.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the party were now collected irregularly round the fire,\r\nand waiting the final break-up. William and Fanny were the most\r\ndetached. They remained together at the otherwise deserted card-table,\r\ntalking very comfortably, and not thinking of the rest, till some of\r\nthe rest began to think of them. Henry Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s chair was the first\r\nto be given a direction towards them, and he sat silently observing\r\nthem for a few minutes; himself, in the meanwhile, observed by Sir\r\nThomas, who was standing in chat with Dr. Grant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the assembly night,\xe2\x80\x9d said William. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were at Portsmouth I\r\nshould be at it, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Fanny, that I do not. I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of\r\ndancing too, when I cannot have you. And I do not know that there would\r\nbe any good in going to the assembly, for I might not get a partner.\r\nThe Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a\r\ncommission. One might as well be nothing as a midshipman. One _is_\r\nnothing, indeed. You remember the Gregorys; they are grown up amazing\r\nfine girls, but they will hardly speak to _me_, because Lucy is courted\r\nby a lieutenant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! shame, shame! But never mind it, William\xe2\x80\x9d (her own cheeks in a\r\nglow of indignation as she spoke). \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not worth minding. It is no\r\nreflection on _you_; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have\r\nall experienced, more or less, in their time. You must think of that,\r\nyou must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which\r\nfall to every sailor\xe2\x80\x99s share, like bad weather and hard living, only\r\nwith this advantage, that there will be an end to it, that there will\r\ncome a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure. When you\r\nare a lieutenant! only think, William, when you are a lieutenant, how\r\nlittle you will care for any nonsense of this kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant, Fanny. Everybody gets\r\nmade but me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear William, do not talk so; do not be so desponding. My uncle\r\nsays nothing, but I am sure he will do everything in his power to get\r\nyou made. He knows, as well as you do, of what consequence it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was checked by the sight of her uncle much nearer to them than she\r\nhad any suspicion of, and each found it necessary to talk of something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you fond of dancing, Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very; only I am soon tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance. Have you\r\nnever any balls at Northampton? I should like to see you dance, and I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ndance with you if you _would_, for nobody would know who I was here,\r\nand I should like to be your partner once more. We used to jump about\r\ntogether many a time, did not we? when the hand-organ was in the\r\nstreet? I am a pretty good dancer in my way, but I dare say you are a\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d And turning to his uncle, who was now close to them, \xe2\x80\x9cIs not\r\nFanny a very good dancer, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny, in dismay at such an unprecedented question, did not know which\r\nway to look, or how to be prepared for the answer. Some very grave\r\nreproof, or at least the coldest expression of indifference, must be\r\ncoming to distress her brother, and sink her to the ground. But, on the\r\ncontrary, it was no worse than, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say that I am unable to\r\nanswer your question. I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a\r\nlittle girl; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a\r\ngentlewoman when we do see her, which, perhaps, we may have an\r\nopportunity of doing ere long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance, Mr. Price,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHenry Crawford, leaning forward, \xe2\x80\x9cand will engage to answer every\r\ninquiry which you can make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction.\r\nBut I believe\xe2\x80\x9d (seeing Fanny looked distressed) \xe2\x80\x9cit must be at some\r\nother time. There is _one_ person in company who does not like to have\r\nMiss Price spoken of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrue enough, he had once seen Fanny dance; and it was equally true that\r\nhe would now have answered for her gliding about with quiet, light\r\nelegance, and in admirable time; but, in fact, he could not for the\r\nlife of him recall what her dancing had been, and rather took it for\r\ngranted that she had been present than remembered anything about her.\r\n\r\nHe passed, however, for an admirer of her dancing; and Sir Thomas, by\r\nno means displeased, prolonged the conversation on dancing in general,\r\nand was so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua, and\r\nlistening to what his nephew could relate of the different modes of\r\ndancing which had fallen within his observation, that he had not heard\r\nhis carriage announced, and was first called to the knowledge of it by\r\nthe bustle of Mrs. Norris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Fanny, Fanny, what are you about? We are going. Do not you see\r\nyour aunt is going? Quick, quick! I cannot bear to keep good old Wilcox\r\nwaiting. You should always remember the coachman and horses. My dear\r\nSir Thomas, we have settled it that the carriage should come back for\r\nyou, and Edmund and William.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas could not dissent, as it had been his own arrangement,\r\npreviously communicated to his wife and sister; but _that_ seemed\r\nforgotten by Mrs. Norris, who must fancy that she settled it all\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s last feeling in the visit was disappointment: for the shawl\r\nwhich Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round\r\nher shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s quicker hand, and she was\r\nobliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam\xe2\x80\x99s desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a momentary\r\nimpression on his uncle. The hope of an opportunity, which Sir Thomas\r\nhad then given, was not given to be thought of no more. He remained\r\nsteadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling; to gratify anybody\r\nelse who might wish to see Fanny dance, and to give pleasure to the\r\nyoung people in general; and having thought the matter over, and taken\r\nhis resolution in quiet independence, the result of it appeared the\r\nnext morning at breakfast, when, after recalling and commending what\r\nhis nephew had said, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not like, William, that you should\r\nleave Northamptonshire without this indulgence. It would give me\r\npleasure to see you both dance. You spoke of the balls at Northampton.\r\nYour cousins have occasionally attended them; but they would not\r\naltogether suit us now. The fatigue would be too much for your aunt. I\r\nbelieve we must not think of a Northampton ball. A dance at home would\r\nbe more eligible; and if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear Sir Thomas!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mrs. Norris, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew what was\r\ncoming. I knew what you were going to say. If dear Julia were at home,\r\nor dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton, to afford a reason, an occasion\r\nfor such a thing, you would be tempted to give the young people a dance\r\nat Mansfield. I know you would. If _they_ were at home to grace the\r\nball, a ball you would have this very Christmas. Thank your uncle,\r\nWilliam, thank your uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughters,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Thomas, gravely interposing, \xe2\x80\x9chave their\r\npleasures at Brighton, and I hope are very happy; but the dance which I\r\nthink of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins. Could we be all\r\nassembled, our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete, but the\r\nabsence of some is not to debar the others of amusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris had not another word to say. She saw decision in his looks,\r\nand her surprise and vexation required some minutes\xe2\x80\x99 silence to be\r\nsettled into composure. A ball at such a time! His daughters absent and\r\nherself not consulted! There was comfort, however, soon at hand. _She_\r\nmust be the doer of everything: Lady Bertram would of course be spared\r\nall thought and exertion, and it would all fall upon _her_. She should\r\nhave to do the honours of the evening; and this reflection quickly\r\nrestored so much of her good-humour as enabled her to join in with the\r\nothers, before their happiness and thanks were all expressed.\r\n\r\nEdmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways, look and speak\r\nas much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas could\r\ndesire. Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s feelings were for the other two. His father had never\r\nconferred a favour or shewn a kindness more to his satisfaction.\r\n\r\nLady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented, and had no\r\nobjections to make. Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little\r\ntrouble; and she assured him \xe2\x80\x9cthat she was not at all afraid of the\r\ntrouble; indeed, she could not imagine there would be any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was ready with her suggestions as to the rooms he would\r\nthink fittest to be used, but found it all prearranged; and when she\r\nwould have conjectured and hinted about the day, it appeared that the\r\nday was settled too. Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping a\r\nvery complete outline of the business; and as soon as she would listen\r\nquietly, could read his list of the families to be invited, from whom\r\nhe calculated, with all necessary allowance for the shortness of the\r\nnotice, to collect young people enough to form twelve or fourteen\r\ncouple: and could detail the considerations which had induced him to\r\nfix on the 22nd as the most eligible day. William was required to be at\r\nPortsmouth on the 24th; the 22nd would therefore be the last day of his\r\nvisit; but where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix on any\r\nearlier. Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied with thinking just the\r\nsame, and with having been on the point of proposing the 22nd herself,\r\nas by far the best day for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe ball was now a settled thing, and before the evening a proclaimed\r\nthing to all whom it concerned. Invitations were sent with despatch,\r\nand many a young lady went to bed that night with her head full of\r\nhappy cares as well as Fanny. To her the cares were sometimes almost\r\nbeyond the happiness; for young and inexperienced, with small means of\r\nchoice and no confidence in her own taste, the \xe2\x80\x9chow she should be\r\ndressed\xe2\x80\x9d was a point of painful solicitude; and the almost solitary\r\nornament in her possession, a very pretty amber cross which William had\r\nbrought her from Sicily, was the greatest distress of all, for she had\r\nnothing but a bit of ribbon to fasten it to; and though she had worn it\r\nin that manner once, would it be allowable at such a time in the midst\r\nof all the rich ornaments which she supposed all the other young ladies\r\nwould appear in? And yet not to wear it! William had wanted to buy her\r\na gold chain too, but the purchase had been beyond his means, and\r\ntherefore not to wear the cross might be mortifying him. These were\r\nanxious considerations; enough to sober her spirits even under the\r\nprospect of a ball given principally for her gratification.\r\n\r\nThe preparations meanwhile went on, and Lady Bertram continued to sit\r\non her sofa without any inconvenience from them. She had some extra\r\nvisits from the housekeeper, and her maid was rather hurried in making\r\nup a new dress for her: Sir Thomas gave orders, and Mrs. Norris ran\r\nabout; but all this gave _her_ no trouble, and as she had foreseen,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere was, in fact, no trouble in the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund was at this time particularly full of cares: his mind being\r\ndeeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now at\r\nhand, which were to fix his fate in life\xe2\x80\x94ordination and\r\nmatrimony\xe2\x80\x94events of such a serious character as to make the ball, which\r\nwould be very quickly followed by one of them, appear of less moment in\r\nhis eyes than in those of any other person in the house. On the 23rd he\r\nwas going to a friend near Peterborough, in the same situation as\r\nhimself, and they were to receive ordination in the course of the\r\nChristmas week. Half his destiny would then be determined, but the\r\nother half might not be so very smoothly wooed. His duties would be\r\nestablished, but the wife who was to share, and animate, and reward\r\nthose duties, might yet be unattainable. He knew his own mind, but he\r\nwas not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s. There were\r\npoints on which they did not quite agree; there were moments in which\r\nshe did not seem propitious; and though trusting altogether to her\r\naffection, so far as to be resolved\xe2\x80\x94almost resolved\xe2\x80\x94on bringing it to a\r\ndecision within a very short time, as soon as the variety of business\r\nbefore him were arranged, and he knew what he had to offer her, he had\r\nmany anxious feelings, many doubting hours as to the result. His\r\nconviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong; he could\r\nlook back on a long course of encouragement, and she was as perfect in\r\ndisinterested attachment as in everything else. But at other times\r\ndoubt and alarm intermingled with his hopes; and when he thought of her\r\nacknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement, her decided\r\npreference of a London life, what could he expect but a determined\r\nrejection? unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated,\r\ndemanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side as\r\nconscience must forbid.\r\n\r\nThe issue of all depended on one question. Did she love him well enough\r\nto forego what had used to be essential points? Did she love him well\r\nenough to make them no longer essential? And this question, which he\r\nwas continually repeating to himself, though oftenest answered with a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d had sometimes its \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield, and on this circumstance the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d had been very recently in alternation. He had seen\r\nher eyes sparkle as she spoke of the dear friend\xe2\x80\x99s letter, which\r\nclaimed a long visit from her in London, and of the kindness of Henry,\r\nin engaging to remain where he was till January, that he might convey\r\nher thither; he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such a journey\r\nwith an animation which had \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d in every tone. But this had occurred\r\non the first day of its being settled, within the first hour of the\r\nburst of such enjoyment, when nothing but the friends she was to visit\r\nwas before her. He had since heard her express herself differently,\r\nwith other feelings, more chequered feelings: he had heard her tell\r\nMrs. Grant that she should leave her with regret; that she began to\r\nbelieve neither the friends nor the pleasures she was going to were\r\nworth those she left behind; and that though she felt she must go, and\r\nknew she should enjoy herself when once away, she was already looking\r\nforward to being at Mansfield again. Was there not a \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d in all this?\r\n\r\nWith such matters to ponder over, and arrange, and re-arrange, Edmund\r\ncould not, on his own account, think very much of the evening which the\r\nrest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of\r\nstrong interest. Independent of his two cousins\xe2\x80\x99 enjoyment in it, the\r\nevening was to him of no higher value than any other appointed meeting\r\nof the two families might be. In every meeting there was a hope of\r\nreceiving farther confirmation of Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s attachment; but the\r\nwhirl of a ballroom, perhaps, was not particularly favourable to the\r\nexcitement or expression of serious feelings. To engage her early for\r\nthe two first dances was all the command of individual happiness which\r\nhe felt in his power, and the only preparation for the ball which he\r\ncould enter into, in spite of all that was passing around him on the\r\nsubject, from morning till night.\r\n\r\nThursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, still\r\nunable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear, determined to\r\nseek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and\r\nher sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her\r\nblameless; and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she\r\nhad reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she walked down to the\r\nParsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private\r\ndiscussion; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important\r\npart of it to Fanny, being more than half-ashamed of her own\r\nsolicitude.\r\n\r\nShe met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage, just setting\r\nout to call on her, and as it seemed to her that her friend, though\r\nobliged to insist on turning back, was unwilling to lose her walk, she\r\nexplained her business at once, and observed, that if she would be so\r\nkind as to give her opinion, it might be all talked over as well\r\nwithout doors as within. Miss Crawford appeared gratified by the\r\napplication, and after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought, urged Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s returning with\r\nher in a much more cordial manner than before, and proposed their going\r\nup into her room, where they might have a comfortable coze, without\r\ndisturbing Dr. and Mrs. Grant, who were together in the drawing-room.\r\nIt was just the plan to suit Fanny; and with a great deal of gratitude\r\non her side for such ready and kind attention, they proceeded indoors,\r\nand upstairs, and were soon deep in the interesting subject. Miss\r\nCrawford, pleased with the appeal, gave her all her best judgment and\r\ntaste, made everything easy by her suggestions, and tried to make\r\neverything agreeable by her encouragement. The dress being settled in\r\nall its grander parts\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut what shall you have by way of necklace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Crawford. \xe2\x80\x9cShall not you wear your brother\xe2\x80\x99s cross?\xe2\x80\x9d And as\r\nshe spoke she was undoing a small parcel, which Fanny had observed in\r\nher hand when they met. Fanny acknowledged her wishes and doubts on\r\nthis point: she did not know how either to wear the cross, or to\r\nrefrain from wearing it. She was answered by having a small trinket-box\r\nplaced before her, and being requested to chuse from among several gold\r\nchains and necklaces. Such had been the parcel with which Miss Crawford\r\nwas provided, and such the object of her intended visit: and in the\r\nkindest manner she now urged Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s taking one for the cross and to\r\nkeep for her sake, saying everything she could think of to obviate the\r\nscruples which were making Fanny start back at first with a look of\r\nhorror at the proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see what a collection I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cmore by half than I ever\r\nuse or think of. I do not offer them as new. I offer nothing but an old\r\nnecklace. You must forgive the liberty, and oblige me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny still resisted, and from her heart. The gift was too valuable.\r\nBut Miss Crawford persevered, and argued the case with so much\r\naffectionate earnestness through all the heads of William and the\r\ncross, and the ball, and herself, as to be finally successful. Fanny\r\nfound herself obliged to yield, that she might not be accused of pride\r\nor indifference, or some other littleness; and having with modest\r\nreluctance given her consent, proceeded to make the selection. She\r\nlooked and looked, longing to know which might be least valuable; and\r\nwas determined in her choice at last, by fancying there was one\r\nnecklace more frequently placed before her eyes than the rest. It was\r\nof gold, prettily worked; and though Fanny would have preferred a\r\nlonger and a plainer chain as more adapted for her purpose, she hoped,\r\nin fixing on this, to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to\r\nkeep. Miss Crawford smiled her perfect approbation; and hastened to\r\ncomplete the gift by putting the necklace round her, and making her see\r\nhow well it looked. Fanny had not a word to say against its\r\nbecomingness, and, excepting what remained of her scruples, was\r\nexceedingly pleased with an acquisition so very apropos. She would\r\nrather, perhaps, have been obliged to some other person. But this was\r\nan unworthy feeling. Miss Crawford had anticipated her wants with a\r\nkindness which proved her a real friend. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I wear this necklace I\r\nshall always think of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand feel how very kind you\r\nwere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must think of somebody else too, when you wear that necklace,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Miss Crawford. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must think of Henry, for it was his choice\r\nin the first place. He gave it to me, and with the necklace I make over\r\nto you all the duty of remembering the original giver. It is to be a\r\nfamily remembrancer. The sister is not to be in your mind without\r\nbringing the brother too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny, in great astonishment and confusion, would have returned the\r\npresent instantly. To take what had been the gift of another person, of\r\na brother too, impossible! it must not be! and with an eagerness and\r\nembarrassment quite diverting to her companion, she laid down the\r\nnecklace again on its cotton, and seemed resolved either to take\r\nanother or none at all. Miss Crawford thought she had never seen a\r\nprettier consciousness. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are\r\nyou afraid of? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine, and\r\nfancy you did not come honestly by it? or are you imagining he would be\r\ntoo much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which\r\nhis money purchased three years ago, before he knew there was such a\r\nthroat in the world? or perhaps\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94looking archly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou suspect a\r\nconfederacy between us, and that what I am now doing is with his\r\nknowledge and at his desire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such a thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Crawford more seriously, but without at all\r\nbelieving her, \xe2\x80\x9cto convince me that you suspect no trick, and are as\r\nunsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you, take the\r\nnecklace and say no more about it. Its being a gift of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneed not make the smallest difference in your accepting it, as I assure\r\nyou it makes none in my willingness to part with it. He is always\r\ngiving me something or other. I have such innumerable presents from him\r\nthat it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember\r\nhalf. And as for this necklace, I do not suppose I have worn it six\r\ntimes: it is very pretty, but I never think of it; and though you would\r\nbe most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket-box, you have\r\nhappened to fix on the very one which, if I have a choice, I would\r\nrather part with and see in your possession than any other. Say no more\r\nagainst it, I entreat you. Such a trifle is not worth half so many\r\nwords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny dared not make any farther opposition; and with renewed but less\r\nhappy thanks accepted the necklace again, for there was an expression\r\nin Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s eyes which she could not be satisfied with.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s change of\r\nmanners. She had long seen it. He evidently tried to please her: he was\r\ngallant, he was attentive, he was something like what he had been to\r\nher cousins: he wanted, she supposed, to cheat her of her tranquillity\r\nas he had cheated them; and whether he might not have some concern in\r\nthis necklace\xe2\x80\x94she could not be convinced that he had not, for Miss\r\nCrawford, complaisant as a sister, was careless as a woman and a\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nReflecting and doubting, and feeling that the possession of what she\r\nhad so much wished for did not bring much satisfaction, she now walked\r\nhome again, with a change rather than a diminution of cares since her\r\ntreading that path before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit this\r\nunexpected acquisition, this doubtful good of a necklace, in some\r\nfavourite box in the East room, which held all her smaller treasures;\r\nbut on opening the door, what was her surprise to find her cousin\r\nEdmund there writing at the table! Such a sight having never occurred\r\nbefore, was almost as wonderful as it was welcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said he directly, leaving his seat and his pen, and meeting\r\nher with something in his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon for being here. I\r\ncame to look for you, and after waiting a little while in hope of your\r\ncoming in, was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand. You\r\nwill find the beginning of a note to yourself; but I can now speak my\r\nbusiness, which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little\r\ntrifle\xe2\x80\x94a chain for William\xe2\x80\x99s cross. You ought to have had it a week\r\nago, but there has been a delay from my brother\xe2\x80\x99s not being in town by\r\nseveral days so soon as I expected; and I have only just now received\r\nit at Northampton. I hope you will like the chain itself, Fanny. I\r\nendeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste; but, at any rate,\r\nI know you will be kind to my intentions, and consider it, as it really\r\nis, a token of the love of one of your oldest friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he was hurrying away, before Fanny, overpowered by a\r\nthousand feelings of pain and pleasure, could attempt to speak; but\r\nquickened by one sovereign wish, she then called out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! cousin, stop\r\na moment, pray stop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot attempt to thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, in a very agitated\r\nmanner; \xe2\x80\x9cthanks are out of the question. I feel much more than I can\r\npossibly express. Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is\r\nbeyond\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is all you have to say, Fanny\xe2\x80\x9d smiling and turning away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, it is not. I want to consult you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost unconsciously she had now undone the parcel he had just put into\r\nher hand, and seeing before her, in all the niceness of jewellers\xe2\x80\x99\r\npacking, a plain gold chain, perfectly simple and neat, she could not\r\nhelp bursting forth again, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, this is beautiful indeed! This is the\r\nvery thing, precisely what I wished for! This is the only ornament I\r\nhave ever had a desire to possess. It will exactly suit my cross. They\r\nmust and shall be worn together. It comes, too, in such an acceptable\r\nmoment. Oh, cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Fanny, you feel these things a great deal too much. I am most\r\nhappy that you like the chain, and that it should be here in time for\r\nto-morrow; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion. Believe me, I\r\nhave no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to\r\nyours. No, I can safely say, I have no pleasure so complete, so\r\nunalloyed. It is without a drawback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour\r\nwithout saying another word; but Edmund, after waiting a moment,\r\nobliged her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is it that you want to consult me about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was about the necklace, which she was now most earnestly longing to\r\nreturn, and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing. She gave the\r\nhistory of her recent visit, and now her raptures might well be over;\r\nfor Edmund was so struck with the circumstance, so delighted with what\r\nMiss Crawford had done, so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct\r\nbetween them, that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one\r\npleasure over his own mind, though it might have its drawback. It was\r\nsome time before she could get his attention to her plan, or any answer\r\nto her demand of his opinion: he was in a reverie of fond reflection,\r\nuttering only now and then a few half-sentences of praise; but when he\r\ndid awake and understand, he was very decided in opposing what she\r\nwished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReturn the necklace! No, my dear Fanny, upon no account. It would be\r\nmortifying her severely. There can hardly be a more unpleasant\r\nsensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have\r\ngiven with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a\r\nfriend. Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so\r\ndeserving of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it had been given to me in the first instance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould not have thought of returning it; but being her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresent, is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with\r\nit, when it is not wanted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable, at least: and its\r\nhaving been originally her brother\xe2\x80\x99s gift makes no difference; for as\r\nshe was not prevented from offering, nor you from taking it on that\r\naccount, it ought not to prevent you from keeping it. No doubt it is\r\nhandsomer than mine, and fitter for a ballroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer in its way, and, for my\r\npurpose, not half so fit. The chain will agree with William\xe2\x80\x99s cross\r\nbeyond all comparison better than the necklace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it _be_ a sacrifice; I am\r\nsure you will, upon consideration, make that sacrifice rather than give\r\npain to one who has been so studious of your comfort. Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattentions to you have been\xe2\x80\x94not more than you were justly entitled to\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nam the last person to think that _could_ _be_, but they have been\r\ninvariable; and to be returning them with what must have something the\r\n_air_ of ingratitude, though I know it could never have the _meaning_,\r\nis not in your nature, I am sure. Wear the necklace, as you are engaged\r\nto do, to-morrow evening, and let the chain, which was not ordered with\r\nany reference to the ball, be kept for commoner occasions. This is my\r\nadvice. I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose\r\nintimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure, and in whose\r\ncharacters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and\r\nnatural delicacy as to make the few slight differences, resulting\r\nprincipally from situation, no reasonable hindrance to a perfect\r\nfriendship. I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated, his voice sinking a little, \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the two dearest objects\r\nI have on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was gone as he spoke; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as\r\nshe could. She was one of his two dearest\xe2\x80\x94that must support her. But\r\nthe other: the first! She had never heard him speak so openly before,\r\nand though it told her no more than what she had long perceived, it was\r\na stab, for it told of his own convictions and views. They were\r\ndecided. He would marry Miss Crawford. It was a stab, in spite of every\r\nlong-standing expectation; and she was obliged to repeat again and\r\nagain, that she was one of his two dearest, before the words gave her\r\nany sensation. Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him, it would\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94oh, how different would it be\xe2\x80\x94how far more tolerable! But he was\r\ndeceived in her: he gave her merits which she had not; her faults were\r\nwhat they had ever been, but he saw them no longer. Till she had shed\r\nmany tears over this deception, Fanny could not subdue her agitation;\r\nand the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the\r\ninfluence of fervent prayers for his happiness.\r\n\r\nIt was her intention, as she felt it to be her duty, to try to overcome\r\nall that was excessive, all that bordered on selfishness, in her\r\naffection for Edmund. To call or to fancy it a loss, a disappointment,\r\nwould be a presumption for which she had not words strong enough to\r\nsatisfy her own humility. To think of him as Miss Crawford might be\r\njustified in thinking, would in her be insanity. To her he could be\r\nnothing under any circumstances; nothing dearer than a friend. Why did\r\nsuch an idea occur to her even enough to be reprobated and forbidden?\r\nIt ought not to have touched on the confines of her imagination. She\r\nwould endeavour to be rational, and to deserve the right of judging of\r\nMiss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s character, and the privilege of true solicitude for him\r\nby a sound intellect and an honest heart.\r\n\r\nShe had all the heroism of principle, and was determined to do her\r\nduty; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature, let her\r\nnot be much wondered at, if, after making all these good resolutions on\r\nthe side of self-government, she seized the scrap of paper on which\r\nEdmund had begun writing to her, as a treasure beyond all her hopes,\r\nand reading with the tenderest emotion these words, \xe2\x80\x9cMy very dear\r\nFanny, you must do me the favour to accept\xe2\x80\x9d locked it up with the\r\nchain, as the dearest part of the gift. It was the only thing\r\napproaching to a letter which she had ever received from him; she might\r\nnever receive another; it was impossible that she ever should receive\r\nanother so perfectly gratifying in the occasion and the style. Two\r\nlines more prized had never fallen from the pen of the most\r\ndistinguished author\xe2\x80\x94never more completely blessed the researches of\r\nthe fondest biographer. The enthusiasm of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s love is even beyond\r\nthe biographer\xe2\x80\x99s. To her, the handwriting itself, independent of\r\nanything it may convey, is a blessedness. Never were such characters\r\ncut by any other human being as Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s commonest handwriting gave!\r\nThis specimen, written in haste as it was, had not a fault; and there\r\nwas a felicity in the flow of the first four words, in the arrangement\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cMy very dear Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d which she could have looked at for ever.\r\n\r\nHaving regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings by this happy\r\nmixture of reason and weakness, she was able in due time to go down and\r\nresume her usual employments near her aunt Bertram, and pay her the\r\nusual observances without any apparent want of spirits.\r\n\r\nThursday, predestined to hope and enjoyment, came; and opened with more\r\nkindness to Fanny than such self-willed, unmanageable days often\r\nvolunteer, for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought\r\nfrom Mr. Crawford to William, stating that as he found himself obliged\r\nto go to London on the morrow for a few days, he could not help trying\r\nto procure a companion; and therefore hoped that if William could make\r\nup his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been\r\nproposed, he would accept a place in his carriage. Mr. Crawford meant\r\nto be in town by his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s accustomary late dinner-hour, and William\r\nwas invited to dine with him at the Admiral\xe2\x80\x99s. The proposal was a very\r\npleasant one to William himself, who enjoyed the idea of travelling\r\npost with four horses, and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and,\r\nin likening it to going up with despatches, was saying at once\r\neverything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination\r\ncould suggest; and Fanny, from a different motive, was exceedingly\r\npleased; for the original plan was that William should go up by the\r\nmail from Northampton the following night, which would not have allowed\r\nhim an hour\xe2\x80\x99s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach; and\r\nthough this offer of Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s would rob her of many hours of his\r\ncompany, she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of\r\nsuch a journey, to think of anything else. Sir Thomas approved of it\r\nfor another reason. His nephew\xe2\x80\x99s introduction to Admiral Crawford might\r\nbe of service. The Admiral, he believed, had interest. Upon the whole,\r\nit was a very joyous note. Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s spirits lived on it half the\r\nmorning, deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being\r\nhimself to go away.\r\n\r\nAs for the ball, so near at hand, she had too many agitations and fears\r\nto have half the enjoyment in anticipation which she ought to have had,\r\nor must have been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking\r\nforward to the same event in situations more at ease, but under\r\ncircumstances of less novelty, less interest, less peculiar\r\ngratification, than would be attributed to her. Miss Price, known only\r\nby name to half the people invited, was now to make her first\r\nappearance, and must be regarded as the queen of the evening. Who could\r\nbe happier than Miss Price? But Miss Price had not been brought up to\r\nthe trade of _coming_ _out_; and had she known in what light this ball\r\nwas, in general, considered respecting her, it would very much have\r\nlessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing\r\nwrong and being looked at. To dance without much observation or any\r\nextraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners for about half the\r\nevening, to dance a little with Edmund, and not a great deal with Mr.\r\nCrawford, to see William enjoy himself, and be able to keep away from\r\nher aunt Norris, was the height of her ambition, and seemed to\r\ncomprehend her greatest possibility of happiness. As these were the\r\nbest of her hopes, they could not always prevail; and in the course of\r\na long morning, spent principally with her two aunts, she was often\r\nunder the influence of much less sanguine views. William, determined to\r\nmake this last day a day of thorough enjoyment, was out snipe-shooting;\r\nEdmund, she had too much reason to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and\r\nleft alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because\r\nthe housekeeper would have her own way with the supper, and whom _she_\r\ncould not avoid though the housekeeper might, Fanny was worn down at\r\nlast to think everything an evil belonging to the ball, and when sent\r\noff with a parting worry to dress, moved as languidly towards her own\r\nroom, and felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no\r\nshare in it.\r\n\r\nAs she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday; it had been\r\nabout the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage, and found\r\nEdmund in the East room. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I were to find him there again\r\nto-day!\xe2\x80\x9d said she to herself, in a fond indulgence of fancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice at that moment near her. Starting and looking up,\r\nshe saw, across the lobby she had just reached, Edmund himself,\r\nstanding at the head of a different staircase. He came towards her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look tired and fagged, Fanny. You have been walking too far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not been out at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse. You had\r\nbetter have gone out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny, not liking to complain, found it easiest to make no answer; and\r\nthough he looked at her with his usual kindness, she believed he had\r\nsoon ceased to think of her countenance. He did not appear in spirits:\r\nsomething unconnected with her was probably amiss. They proceeded\r\nupstairs together, their rooms being on the same floor above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come from Dr. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund presently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may guess my\r\nerrand there, Fanny.\xe2\x80\x9d And he looked so conscious, that Fanny could\r\nthink but of one errand, which turned her too sick for speech. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances,\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nexplanation that followed, and brought Fanny to life again, enabling\r\nher, as she found she was expected to speak, to utter something like an\r\ninquiry as to the result.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is engaged to me; but\xe2\x80\x9d (with a smile that did\r\nnot sit easy) \xe2\x80\x9cshe says it is to be the last time that she ever will\r\ndance with me. She is not serious. I think, I hope, I am sure she is\r\nnot serious; but I would rather not hear it. She never has danced with\r\na clergyman, she says, and she never _will_. For my own sake, I could\r\nwish there had been no ball just at\xe2\x80\x94I mean not this very week, this\r\nvery day; to-morrow I leave home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny struggled for speech, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry that anything\r\nhas occurred to distress you. This ought to be a day of pleasure. My\r\nuncle meant it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, yes! and it will be a day of pleasure. It will all end right.\r\nI am only vexed for a moment. In fact, it is not that I consider the\r\nball as ill-timed; what does it signify? But, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d stopping her, by\r\ntaking her hand, and speaking low and seriously, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know what all\r\nthis means. You see how it is; and could tell me, perhaps better than I\r\ncould tell you, how and why I am vexed. Let me talk to you a little.\r\nYou are a kind, kind listener. I have been pained by her manner this\r\nmorning, and cannot get the better of it. I know her disposition to be\r\nas sweet and faultless as your own, but the influence of her former\r\ncompanions makes her seem\xe2\x80\x94gives to her conversation, to her professed\r\nopinions, sometimes a tinge of wrong. She does not _think_ evil, but\r\nshe speaks it, speaks it in playfulness; and though I know it to be\r\nplayfulness, it grieves me to the soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe effect of education,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny gently.\r\n\r\nEdmund could not but agree to it. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that uncle and aunt! They have\r\ninjured the finest mind; for sometimes, Fanny, I own to you, it does\r\nappear more than manner: it appears as if the mind itself was tainted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment, and therefore,\r\nafter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you only want me as a\r\nlistener, cousin, I will be as useful as I can; but I am not qualified\r\nfor an adviser. Do not ask advice of _me_. I am not competent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Fanny, to protest against such an office, but you need\r\nnot be afraid. It is a subject on which I should never ask advice; it\r\nis the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked; and few,\r\nI imagine, do ask it, but when they want to be influenced against their\r\nconscience. I only want to talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing more. Excuse the liberty; but take care _how_ you talk to\r\nme. Do not tell me anything now, which hereafter you may be sorry for.\r\nThe time may come\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colour rushed into her cheeks as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Fanny!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Edmund, pressing her hand to his lips with\r\nalmost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are all\r\nconsiderate thought! But it is unnecessary here. The time will never\r\ncome. No such time as you allude to will ever come. I begin to think it\r\nmost improbable: the chances grow less and less; and even if it should,\r\nthere will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need\r\nbe afraid of, for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples; and if\r\nthey are removed, it must be by changes that will only raise her\r\ncharacter the more by the recollection of the faults she once had. You\r\nare the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said;\r\nbut you have always known my opinion of her; you can bear me witness,\r\nFanny, that I have never been blinded. How many a time have we talked\r\nover her little errors! You need not fear me; I have almost given up\r\nevery serious idea of her; but I must be a blockhead indeed, if,\r\nwhatever befell me, I could think of your kindness and sympathy without\r\nthe sincerest gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen. He had said\r\nenough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known,\r\nand with a brighter look, she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, cousin, I am convinced\r\nthat _you_ would be incapable of anything else, though perhaps some\r\nmight not. I cannot be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say. Do\r\nnot check yourself. Tell me whatever you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were now on the second floor, and the appearance of a housemaid\r\nprevented any farther conversation. For Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s present comfort it was\r\nconcluded, perhaps, at the happiest moment: had he been able to talk\r\nanother five minutes, there is no saying that he might not have talked\r\naway all Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s faults and his own despondence. But as it was,\r\nthey parted with looks on his side of grateful affection, and with some\r\nvery precious sensations on hers. She had felt nothing like it for\r\nhours. Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s note to William had worn\r\naway, she had been in a state absolutely the reverse; there had been no\r\ncomfort around, no hope within her. Now everything was smiling.\r\nWilliam\xe2\x80\x99s good fortune returned again upon her mind, and seemed of\r\ngreater value than at first. The ball, too\xe2\x80\x94such an evening of pleasure\r\nbefore her! It was now a real animation; and she began to dress for it\r\nwith much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball. All went well:\r\nshe did not dislike her own looks; and when she came to the necklaces\r\nagain, her good fortune seemed complete, for upon trial the one given\r\nher by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the\r\ncross. She had, to oblige Edmund, resolved to wear it; but it was too\r\nlarge for the purpose. His, therefore, must be worn; and having, with\r\ndelightful feelings, joined the chain and the cross\xe2\x80\x94those memorials of\r\nthe two most beloved of her heart, those dearest tokens so formed for\r\neach other by everything real and imaginary\xe2\x80\x94and put them round her\r\nneck, and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were, she\r\nwas able, without an effort, to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnecklace too. She acknowledged it to be right. Miss Crawford had a\r\nclaim; and when it was no longer to encroach on, to interfere with the\r\nstronger claims, the truer kindness of another, she could do her\r\njustice even with pleasure to herself. The necklace really looked very\r\nwell; and Fanny left her room at last, comfortably satisfied with\r\nherself and all about her.\r\n\r\nHer aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with an unusual\r\ndegree of wakefulness. It had really occurred to her, unprompted, that\r\nFanny, preparing for a ball, might be glad of better help than the\r\nupper housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s, and when dressed herself, she actually sent her own\r\nmaid to assist her; too late, of course, to be of any use. Mrs. Chapman\r\nhad just reached the attic floor, when Miss Price came out of her room\r\ncompletely dressed, and only civilities were necessary; but Fanny felt\r\nher aunt\xe2\x80\x99s attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman\r\ncould do themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHer uncle and both her aunts were in the drawing-room when Fanny went\r\ndown. To the former she was an interesting object, and he saw with\r\npleasure the general elegance of her appearance, and her being in\r\nremarkably good looks. The neatness and propriety of her dress was all\r\nthat he would allow himself to commend in her presence, but upon her\r\nleaving the room again soon afterwards, he spoke of her beauty with\r\nvery decided praise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram, \xe2\x80\x9cshe looks very well. I sent Chapman to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook well! Oh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, \xe2\x80\x9cshe has good reason to look\r\nwell with all her advantages: brought up in this family as she has\r\nbeen, with all the benefit of her cousins\xe2\x80\x99 manners before her. Only\r\nthink, my dear Sir Thomas, what extraordinary advantages you and I have\r\nbeen the means of giving her. The very gown you have been taking notice\r\nof is your own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth\r\nmarried. What would she have been if we had not taken her by the hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas said no more; but when they sat down to table the eyes of\r\nthe two young men assured him that the subject might be gently touched\r\nagain, when the ladies withdrew, with more success. Fanny saw that she\r\nwas approved; and the consciousness of looking well made her look still\r\nbetter. From a variety of causes she was happy, and she was soon made\r\nstill happier; for in following her aunts out of the room, Edmund, who\r\nwas holding open the door, said, as she passed him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must dance\r\nwith me, Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like,\r\nexcept the first.\xe2\x80\x9d She had nothing more to wish for. She had hardly\r\never been in a state so nearly approaching high spirits in her life.\r\nHer cousins\xe2\x80\x99 former gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer\r\nsurprising to her; she felt it to be indeed very charming, and was\r\nactually practising her steps about the drawing-room as long as she\r\ncould be safe from the notice of her aunt Norris, who was entirely\r\ntaken up at first in fresh arranging and injuring the noble fire which\r\nthe butler had prepared.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour followed that would have been at least languid under any\r\nother circumstances, but Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s happiness still prevailed. It was but\r\nto think of her conversation with Edmund, and what was the restlessness\r\nof Mrs. Norris? What were the yawns of Lady Bertram?\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen joined them; and soon after began the sweet expectation\r\nof a carriage, when a general spirit of ease and enjoyment seemed\r\ndiffused, and they all stood about and talked and laughed, and every\r\nmoment had its pleasure and its hope. Fanny felt that there must be a\r\nstruggle in Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the\r\neffort so successfully made.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriages were really heard, when the guests began really to\r\nassemble, her own gaiety of heart was much subdued: the sight of so\r\nmany strangers threw her back into herself; and besides the gravity and\r\nformality of the first great circle, which the manners of neither Sir\r\nThomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away, she found herself\r\noccasionally called on to endure something worse. She was introduced\r\nhere and there by her uncle, and forced to be spoken to, and to\r\ncurtsey, and speak again. This was a hard duty, and she was never\r\nsummoned to it without looking at William, as he walked about at his\r\nease in the background of the scene, and longing to be with him.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the Grants and Crawfords was a favourable epoch. The\r\nstiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their popular manners and\r\nmore diffused intimacies: little groups were formed, and everybody grew\r\ncomfortable. Fanny felt the advantage; and, drawing back from the toils\r\nof civility, would have been again most happy, could she have kept her\r\neyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford. _She_ looked all\r\nloveliness\xe2\x80\x94and what might not be the end of it? Her own musings were\r\nbrought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her, and her\r\nthoughts were put into another channel by his engaging her almost\r\ninstantly for the first two dances. Her happiness on this occasion was\r\nvery much _\xc3\xa0 la mortal_, finely chequered. To be secure of a partner at\r\nfirst was a most essential good\xe2\x80\x94for the moment of beginning was now\r\ngrowing seriously near; and she so little understood her own claims as\r\nto think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her, she must have been the\r\nlast to be sought after, and should have received a partner only\r\nthrough a series of inquiry, and bustle, and interference, which would\r\nhave been terrible; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his\r\nmanner of asking her which she did not like, and she saw his eye\r\nglancing for a moment at her necklace, with a smile\xe2\x80\x94she thought there\r\nwas a smile\xe2\x80\x94which made her blush and feel wretched. And though there\r\nwas no second glance to disturb her, though his object seemed then to\r\nbe only quietly agreeable, she could not get the better of her\r\nembarrassment, heightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving it,\r\nand had no composure till he turned away to some one else. Then she\r\ncould gradually rise up to the genuine satisfaction of having a\r\npartner, a voluntary partner, secured against the dancing began.\r\n\r\nWhen the company were moving into the ballroom, she found herself for\r\nthe first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes and smiles were\r\nimmediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother\xe2\x80\x99s had been,\r\nand who was beginning to speak on the subject, when Fanny, anxious to\r\nget the story over, hastened to give the explanation of the second\r\nnecklace: the real chain. Miss Crawford listened; and all her intended\r\ncompliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten: she felt only one\r\nthing; and her eyes, bright as they had been before, shewing they could\r\nyet be brighter, she exclaimed with eager pleasure, \xe2\x80\x9cDid he? Did\r\nEdmund? That was like himself. No other man would have thought of it. I\r\nhonour him beyond expression.\xe2\x80\x9d And she looked around as if longing to\r\ntell him so. He was not near, he was attending a party of ladies out of\r\nthe room; and Mrs. Grant coming up to the two girls, and taking an arm\r\nof each, they followed with the rest.\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s heart sunk, but there was no leisure for thinking long even of\r\nMiss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. They were in the ballroom, the violins were\r\nplaying, and her mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on\r\nanything serious. She must watch the general arrangements, and see how\r\neverything was done.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her, and asked if she were engaged;\r\nand the \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; to Mr. Crawford,\xe2\x80\x9d was exactly what he had intended\r\nto hear. Mr. Crawford was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him to her,\r\nsaying something which discovered to Fanny, that _she_ was to lead the\r\nway and open the ball; an idea that had never occurred to her before.\r\nWhenever she had thought of the minutiae of the evening, it had been as\r\na matter of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford; and the\r\nimpression was so strong, that though _her_ _uncle_ spoke the contrary,\r\nshe could not help an exclamation of surprise, a hint of her unfitness,\r\nan entreaty even to be excused. To be urging her opinion against Sir\r\nThomas\xe2\x80\x99s was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was her\r\nhorror at the first suggestion, that she could actually look him in the\r\nface and say that she hoped it might be settled otherwise; in vain,\r\nhowever: Sir Thomas smiled, tried to encourage her, and then looked too\r\nserious, and said too decidedly, \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be so, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d for her to\r\nhazard another word; and she found herself the next moment conducted by\r\nMr. Crawford to the top of the room, and standing there to be joined by\r\nthe rest of the dancers, couple after couple, as they were formed.\r\n\r\nShe could hardly believe it. To be placed above so many elegant young\r\nwomen! The distinction was too great. It was treating her like her\r\ncousins! And her thoughts flew to those absent cousins with most\r\nunfeigned and truly tender regret, that they were not at home to take\r\ntheir own place in the room, and have their share of a pleasure which\r\nwould have been so very delightful to them. So often as she had heard\r\nthem wish for a ball at home as the greatest of all felicities! And to\r\nhave them away when it was given\xe2\x80\x94and for _her_ to be opening the\r\nball\xe2\x80\x94and with Mr. Crawford too! She hoped they would not envy her that\r\ndistinction _now_; but when she looked back to the state of things in\r\nthe autumn, to what they had all been to each other when once dancing\r\nin that house before, the present arrangement was almost more than she\r\ncould understand herself.\r\n\r\nThe ball began. It was rather honour than happiness to Fanny, for the\r\nfirst dance at least: her partner was in excellent spirits, and tried\r\nto impart them to her; but she was a great deal too much frightened to\r\nhave any enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer looked at.\r\nYoung, pretty, and gentle, however, she had no awkwardnesses that were\r\nnot as good as graces, and there were few persons present that were not\r\ndisposed to praise her. She was attractive, she was modest, she was Sir\r\nThomas\xe2\x80\x99s niece, and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford. It\r\nwas enough to give her general favour. Sir Thomas himself was watching\r\nher progress down the dance with much complacency; he was proud of his\r\nniece; and without attributing all her personal beauty, as Mrs. Norris\r\nseemed to do, to her transplantation to Mansfield, he was pleased with\r\nhimself for having supplied everything else: education and manners she\r\nowed to him.\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts as he stood, and\r\nhaving, in spite of all his wrongs towards her, a general prevailing\r\ndesire of recommending herself to him, took an opportunity of stepping\r\naside to say something agreeable of Fanny. Her praise was warm, and he\r\nreceived it as she could wish, joining in it as far as discretion, and\r\npoliteness, and slowness of speech would allow, and certainly appearing\r\nto greater advantage on the subject than his lady did soon afterwards,\r\nwhen Mary, perceiving her on a sofa very near, turned round before she\r\nbegan to dance, to compliment her on Miss Price\xe2\x80\x99s looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she does look very well,\xe2\x80\x9d was Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s placid reply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChapman helped her to dress. I sent Chapman to her.\xe2\x80\x9d Not but that she\r\nwas really pleased to have Fanny admired; but she was so much more\r\nstruck with her own kindness in sending Chapman to her, that she could\r\nnot get it out of her head.\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _her_ by\r\ncommendation of Fanny; to her, it was as the occasion offered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nMrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had\r\ntime for, amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up\r\ncard-tables, giving hints to Sir Thomas, and trying to move all the\r\nchaperons to a better part of the room.\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny herself in her intentions to\r\nplease. She meant to be giving her little heart a happy flutter, and\r\nfilling her with sensations of delightful self-consequence; and,\r\nmisinterpreting Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s blushes, still thought she must be doing so\r\nwhen she went to her after the two first dances, and said, with a\r\nsignificant look, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps _you_ can tell me why my brother goes to\r\ntown to-morrow? He says he has business there, but will not tell me\r\nwhat. The first time he ever denied me his confidence! But this is what\r\nwe all come to. All are supplanted sooner or later. Now, I must apply\r\nto you for information. Pray, what is Henry going for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny protested her ignorance as steadily as her embarrassment allowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Crawford, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI must suppose it to be\r\npurely for the pleasure of conveying your brother, and of talking of\r\nyou by the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was confused, but it was the confusion of discontent; while Miss\r\nCrawford wondered she did not smile, and thought her over-anxious, or\r\nthought her odd, or thought her anything rather than insensible of\r\npleasure in Henry\xe2\x80\x99s attentions. Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in\r\nthe course of the evening; but Henry\xe2\x80\x99s attentions had very little to do\r\nwith it. She would much rather _not_ have been asked by him again so\r\nvery soon, and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his\r\nprevious inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all for\r\nthe sake of securing her at that part of the evening. But it was not to\r\nbe avoided: he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she\r\ncould not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy\r\nor ostentation in his manner; and sometimes, when he talked of William,\r\nhe was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heart which\r\ndid him credit. But still his attentions made no part of her\r\nsatisfaction. She was happy whenever she looked at William, and saw how\r\nperfectly he was enjoying himself, in every five minutes that she could\r\nwalk about with him and hear his account of his partners; she was happy\r\nin knowing herself admired; and she was happy in having the two dances\r\nwith Edmund still to look forward to, during the greatest part of the\r\nevening, her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite\r\nengagement with _him_ was in continual perspective. She was happy even\r\nwhen they did take place; but not from any flow of spirits on his side,\r\nor any such expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning.\r\nHis mind was fagged, and her happiness sprung from being the friend\r\nwith whom it could find repose. \xe2\x80\x9cI am worn out with civility,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say.\r\nBut with _you_, Fanny, there may be peace. You will not want to be\r\ntalked to. Let us have the luxury of silence.\xe2\x80\x9d Fanny would hardly even\r\nspeak her agreement. A weariness, arising probably, in great measure,\r\nfrom the same feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning, was\r\npeculiarly to be respected, and they went down their two dances\r\ntogether with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on\r\nthat Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son.\r\n\r\nThe evening had afforded Edmund little pleasure. Miss Crawford had been\r\nin gay spirits when they first danced together, but it was not her\r\ngaiety that could do him good: it rather sank than raised his comfort;\r\nand afterwards, for he found himself still impelled to seek her again,\r\nshe had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the\r\nprofession to which he was now on the point of belonging. They had\r\ntalked, and they had been silent; he had reasoned, she had ridiculed;\r\nand they had parted at last with mutual vexation. Fanny, not able to\r\nrefrain entirely from observing them, had seen enough to be tolerably\r\nsatisfied. It was barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering. Yet\r\nsome happiness must and would arise from the very conviction that he\r\ndid suffer.\r\n\r\nWhen her two dances with him were over, her inclination and strength\r\nfor more were pretty well at an end; and Sir Thomas, having seen her\r\nwalk rather than dance down the shortening set, breathless, and with\r\nher hand at her side, gave his orders for her sitting down entirely.\r\nFrom that time Mr. Crawford sat down likewise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Fanny!\xe2\x80\x9d cried William, coming for a moment to visit her, and\r\nworking away his partner\xe2\x80\x99s fan as if for life, \xe2\x80\x9chow soon she is knocked\r\nup! Why, the sport is but just begun. I hope we shall keep it up these\r\ntwo hours. How can you be tired so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo soon! my good friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Thomas, producing his watch with\r\nall necessary caution; \xe2\x80\x9cit is three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and your sister is not\r\nused to these sort of hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before I go. Sleep\r\nas long as you can, and never mind me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! William.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Did she think of being up before you set off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fanny, rising eagerly from her seat to be nearer\r\nher uncle; \xe2\x80\x9cI must get up and breakfast with him. It will be the last\r\ntime, you know; the last morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not. He is to have breakfasted and be gone by half-past\r\nnine. Mr. Crawford, I think you call for him at half-past nine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was too urgent, however, and had too many tears in her eyes for\r\ndenial; and it ended in a gracious \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d which was permission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, half-past nine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crawford to William as the latter was\r\nleaving them, \xe2\x80\x9cand I shall be punctual, for there will be no kind\r\nsister to get up for _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d And in a lower tone to Fanny, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have\r\nonly a desolate house to hurry from. Your brother will find my ideas of\r\ntime and his own very different to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a short consideration, Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the\r\nearly breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone: he should\r\nhimself be of it; and the readiness with which his invitation was\r\naccepted convinced him that the suspicions whence, he must confess to\r\nhimself, this very ball had in great measure sprung, were well founded.\r\nMr. Crawford was in love with Fanny. He had a pleasing anticipation of\r\nwhat would be. His niece, meanwhile, did not thank him for what he had\r\njust done. She had hoped to have William all to herself the last\r\nmorning. It would have been an unspeakable indulgence. But though her\r\nwishes were overthrown, there was no spirit of murmuring within her. On\r\nthe contrary, she was so totally unused to have her pleasure consulted,\r\nor to have anything take place at all in the way she could desire, that\r\nshe was more disposed to wonder and rejoice in having carried her point\r\nso far, than to repine at the counteraction which followed.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward, Sir Thomas was again interfering a little with her\r\ninclination, by advising her to go immediately to bed. \xe2\x80\x9cAdvise\xe2\x80\x9d was his\r\nword, but it was the advice of absolute power, and she had only to\r\nrise, and, with Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s very cordial adieus, pass quietly away;\r\nstopping at the entrance-door, like the Lady of Branxholm Hall, \xe2\x80\x9cone\r\nmoment and no more,\xe2\x80\x9d to view the happy scene, and take a last look at\r\nthe five or six determined couple who were still hard at work; and\r\nthen, creeping slowly up the principal staircase, pursued by the\r\nceaseless country-dance, feverish with hopes and fears, soup and negus,\r\nsore-footed and fatigued, restless and agitated, yet feeling, in spite\r\nof everything, that a ball was indeed delightful.\r\n\r\nIn thus sending her away, Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinking\r\nmerely of her health. It might occur to him that Mr. Crawford had been\r\nsitting by her long enough, or he might mean to recommend her as a wife\r\nby shewing her persuadableness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too; the last kiss\r\nwas given, and William was gone. Mr. Crawford had, as he foretold, been\r\nvery punctual, and short and pleasant had been the meal.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the\r\nbreakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy\r\nchange; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace,\r\nconceiving, perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might\r\nexercise her tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones\r\nand mustard in William\xe2\x80\x99s plate might but divide her feelings with the\r\nbroken egg-shells in Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s. She sat and cried _con_ _amore_ as\r\nher uncle intended, but it was _con_ _amore_ fraternal and no other.\r\nWilliam was gone, and she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit\r\nin idle cares and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him.\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s disposition was such that she could never even think of her\r\naunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house,\r\nwithout reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her\r\nwhen they had been last together; much less could her feelings acquit\r\nher of having done and said and thought everything by William that was\r\ndue to him for a whole fortnight.\r\n\r\nIt was a heavy, melancholy day. Soon after the second breakfast, Edmund\r\nbade them good-bye for a week, and mounted his horse for Peterborough,\r\nand then all were gone. Nothing remained of last night but\r\nremembrances, which she had nobody to share in. She talked to her aunt\r\nBertram\xe2\x80\x94she must talk to somebody of the ball; but her aunt had seen so\r\nlittle of what had passed, and had so little curiosity, that it was\r\nheavy work. Lady Bertram was not certain of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s dress or\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x99s place at supper but her own. \xe2\x80\x9cShe could not recollect what it\r\nwas that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was\r\nthat Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny: she was not sure whether\r\nColonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he\r\nsaid he was the finest young man in the room\xe2\x80\x94somebody had whispered\r\nsomething to her; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd these were her longest speeches and clearest communications: the\r\nrest was only a languid \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; very well; did you? did he? I did\r\nnot see _that_; I should not know one from the other.\xe2\x80\x9d This was very\r\nbad. It was only better than Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s sharp answers would have\r\nbeen; but she being gone home with all the supernumerary jellies to\r\nnurse a sick maid, there was peace and good-humour in their little\r\nparty, though it could not boast much beside.\r\n\r\nThe evening was heavy like the day. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think what is the matter\r\nwith me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram, when the tea-things were removed. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel\r\nquite stupid. It must be sitting up so late last night. Fanny, you must\r\ndo something to keep me awake. I cannot work. Fetch the cards; I feel\r\nso very stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till\r\nbedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself, no sounds were heard\r\nin the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the\r\ngame\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _that_ makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib. You\r\nare to deal, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; shall I deal for you?\xe2\x80\x9d Fanny thought and thought\r\nagain of the difference which twenty-four hours had made in that room,\r\nand all that part of the house. Last night it had been hope and smiles,\r\nbustle and motion, noise and brilliancy, in the drawing-room, and out\r\nof the drawing-room, and everywhere. Now it was languor, and all but\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nA good night\xe2\x80\x99s rest improved her spirits. She could think of William\r\nthe next day more cheerfully; and as the morning afforded her an\r\nopportunity of talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss\r\nCrawford, in a very handsome style, with all the heightenings of\r\nimagination, and all the laughs of playfulness which are so essential\r\nto the shade of a departed ball, she could afterwards bring her mind\r\nwithout much effort into its everyday state, and easily conform to the\r\ntranquillity of the present quiet week.\r\n\r\nThey were indeed a smaller party than she had ever known there for a\r\nwhole day together, and _he_ was gone on whom the comfort and\r\ncheerfulness of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended.\r\nBut this must be learned to be endured. He would soon be always gone;\r\nand she was thankful that she could now sit in the same room with her\r\nuncle, hear his voice, receive his questions, and even answer them,\r\nwithout such wretched feelings as she had formerly known.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe miss our two young men,\xe2\x80\x9d was Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s observation on both the\r\nfirst and second day, as they formed their very reduced circle after\r\ndinner; and in consideration of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s swimming eyes, nothing more was\r\nsaid on the first day than to drink their good health; but on the\r\nsecond it led to something farther. William was kindly commended and\r\nhis promotion hoped for. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there is no reason to suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sir\r\nThomas, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent. As to\r\nEdmund, we must learn to do without him. This will be the last winter\r\nof his belonging to us, as he has done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish he was not going away. They are\r\nall going away, I think. I wish they would stay at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had just applied for\r\npermission to go to town with Maria; and as Sir Thomas thought it best\r\nfor each daughter that the permission should be granted, Lady Bertram,\r\nthough in her own good-nature she would not have prevented it, was\r\nlamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia\xe2\x80\x99s return, which\r\nwould otherwise have taken place about this time. A great deal of good\r\nsense followed on Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s side, tending to reconcile his wife to\r\nthe arrangement. Everything that a considerate parent _ought_ to feel\r\nwas advanced for her use; and everything that an affectionate mother\r\n_must_ feel in promoting her children\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment was attributed to her\r\nnature. Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d; and at the end\r\nof a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s silent consideration spontaneously observed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Thomas, I have been thinking\xe2\x80\x94and I am very glad we took Fanny as\r\nwe did, for now the others are away we feel the good of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding, \xe2\x80\x9cVery true.\r\nWe shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her\r\nface, she is now a very valuable companion. If we have been kind to\r\n_her_, she is now quite as necessary to _us_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram presently; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is a comfort to think that\r\nwe shall always have _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his niece, and then gravely\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cShe will never leave us, I hope, till invited to some other\r\nhome that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _that_ is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas. Who should invite\r\nher? Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then, but\r\nshe would not think of asking her to live there; and I am sure she is\r\nbetter off here; and besides, I cannot do without her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe week which passed so quietly and peaceably at the great house in\r\nMansfield had a very different character at the Parsonage. To the young\r\nlady, at least, in each family, it brought very different feelings.\r\nWhat was tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation\r\nto Mary. Something arose from difference of disposition and habit: one\r\nso easily satisfied, the other so unused to endure; but still more\r\nmight be imputed to difference of circumstances. In some points of\r\ninterest they were exactly opposed to each other. To Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s mind,\r\nEdmund\xe2\x80\x99s absence was really, in its cause and its tendency, a relief.\r\nTo Mary it was every way painful. She felt the want of his society\r\nevery day, almost every hour, and was too much in want of it to derive\r\nanything but irritation from considering the object for which he went.\r\nHe could not have devised anything more likely to raise his consequence\r\nthan this week\xe2\x80\x99s absence, occurring as it did at the very time of her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s going away, of William Price\xe2\x80\x99s going too, and completing the\r\nsort of general break-up of a party which had been so animated. She\r\nfelt it keenly. They were now a miserable trio, confined within doors\r\nby a series of rain and snow, with nothing to do and no variety to hope\r\nfor. Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions, and\r\nacting on them in defiance of her (and she had been so angry that they\r\nhad hardly parted friends at the ball), she could not help thinking of\r\nhim continually when absent, dwelling on his merit and affection, and\r\nlonging again for the almost daily meetings they lately had. His\r\nabsence was unnecessarily long. He should not have planned such an\r\nabsence\xe2\x80\x94he should not have left home for a week, when her own departure\r\nfrom Mansfield was so near. Then she began to blame herself. She wished\r\nshe had not spoken so warmly in their last conversation. She was afraid\r\nshe had used some strong, some contemptuous expressions in speaking of\r\nthe clergy, and that should not have been. It was ill-bred; it was\r\nwrong. She wished such words unsaid with all her heart.\r\n\r\nHer vexation did not end with the week. All this was bad, but she had\r\nstill more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund;\r\nwhen Saturday came and still no Edmund; and when, through the slight\r\ncommunication with the other family which Sunday produced, she learned\r\nthat he had actually written home to defer his return, having promised\r\nto remain some days longer with his friend.\r\n\r\nIf she had felt impatience and regret before\xe2\x80\x94if she had been sorry for\r\nwhat she said, and feared its too strong effect on him\xe2\x80\x94she now felt and\r\nfeared it all tenfold more. She had, moreover, to contend with one\r\ndisagreeable emotion entirely new to her\xe2\x80\x94jealousy. His friend Mr. Owen\r\nhad sisters; he might find them attractive. But, at any rate, his\r\nstaying away at a time when, according to all preceding plans, she was\r\nto remove to London, meant something that she could not bear. Had Henry\r\nreturned, as he talked of doing, at the end of three or four days, she\r\nshould now have been leaving Mansfield. It became absolutely necessary\r\nfor her to get to Fanny and try to learn something more. She could not\r\nlive any longer in such solitary wretchedness; and she made her way to\r\nthe Park, through difficulties of walking which she had deemed\r\nunconquerable a week before, for the chance of hearing a little in\r\naddition, for the sake of at least hearing his name.\r\n\r\nThe first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together,\r\nand unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing. But at\r\nlast Lady Bertram left the room, and then almost immediately Miss\r\nCrawford thus began, with a voice as well regulated as she could\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nhow do _you_ like your cousin Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s staying away so long? Being the\r\nonly young person at home, I consider _you_ as the greatest sufferer.\r\nYou must miss him. Does his staying longer surprise you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny hesitatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; I had not particularly\r\nexpected it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of. It is the general\r\nway all young men do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not, the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe finds the house more agreeable _now_. He is a very\xe2\x80\x94a very pleasing\r\nyoung man himself, and I cannot help being rather concerned at not\r\nseeing him again before I go to London, as will now undoubtedly be the\r\ncase. I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he comes there\r\nwill be nothing to detain me at Mansfield. I should like to have seen\r\nhim once more, I confess. But you must give my compliments to him. Yes;\r\nI think it must be compliments. Is not there a something wanted, Miss\r\nPrice, in our language\xe2\x80\x94a something between compliments and\xe2\x80\x94and love\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nsuit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together? So many\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x99 acquaintance! But compliments may be sufficient here. Was his\r\nletter a long one? Does he give you much account of what he is doing?\r\nIs it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle; but I believe\r\nit was very short; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines. All that I\r\nheard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer, and that he\r\nhad agreed to do so. A _few_ days longer, or _some_ days longer; I am\r\nnot quite sure which.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! if he wrote to his father; but I thought it might have been to\r\nLady Bertram or you. But if he wrote to his father, no wonder he was\r\nconcise. Who could write chat to Sir Thomas? If he had written to you,\r\nthere would have been more particulars. You would have heard of balls\r\nand parties. He would have sent you a description of everything and\r\neverybody. How many Miss Owens are there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree grown up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they musical?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not at all know. I never heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the first question, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Crawford, trying to\r\nappear gay and unconcerned, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich every woman who plays herself is\r\nsure to ask about another. But it is very foolish to ask questions\r\nabout any young ladies\xe2\x80\x94about any three sisters just grown up; for one\r\nknows, without being told, exactly what they are: all very accomplished\r\nand pleasing, and one very pretty. There is a beauty in every family;\r\nit is a regular thing. Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp;\r\nand all sing, or would sing if they were taught, or sing all the better\r\nfor not being taught; or something like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing of the Miss Owens,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know nothing and you care less, as people say. Never did tone\r\nexpress indifference plainer. Indeed, how can one care for those one\r\nhas never seen? Well, when your cousin comes back, he will find\r\nMansfield very quiet; all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine\r\nand myself. I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time\r\ndraws near. She does not like my going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny felt obliged to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot doubt your being missed by\r\nmany,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be very much missed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford turned her eye on her, as if wanting to hear or see more,\r\nand then laughingly said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! missed as every noisy evil is missed\r\nwhen it is taken away; that is, there is a great difference felt. But I\r\nam not fishing; don\xe2\x80\x99t compliment me. If I _am_ missed, it will appear.\r\nI may be discovered by those who want to see me. I shall not be in any\r\ndoubtful, or distant, or unapproachable region.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Fanny could not bring herself to speak, and Miss Crawford was\r\ndisappointed; for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her\r\npower from one who she thought must know, and her spirits were clouded\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Miss Owens,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, soon afterwards; \xe2\x80\x9csuppose you were to have\r\none of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey; how should you like\r\nit? Stranger things have happened. I dare say they are trying for it.\r\nAnd they are quite in the right, for it would be a very pretty\r\nestablishment for them. I do not at all wonder or blame them. It is\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s duty to do as well for themselves as they can. Sir Thomas\r\nBertram\xe2\x80\x99s son is somebody; and now he is in their own line. Their\r\nfather is a clergyman, and their brother is a clergyman, and they are\r\nall clergymen together. He is their lawful property; he fairly belongs\r\nto them. You don\xe2\x80\x99t speak, Fanny; Miss Price, you don\xe2\x80\x99t speak. But\r\nhonestly now, do not you rather expect it than otherwise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny stoutly, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not expect it at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Crawford with alacrity. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder at that. But\r\nI dare say you know exactly\xe2\x80\x94I always imagine you are\xe2\x80\x94perhaps you do not\r\nthink him likely to marry at all\xe2\x80\x94or not at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny softly, hoping she did not err either in the\r\nbelief or the acknowledgment of it.\r\n\r\nHer companion looked at her keenly; and gathering greater spirit from\r\nthe blush soon produced from such a look, only said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is best off as\r\nhe is,\xe2\x80\x9d and turned the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation, and\r\nshe walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another\r\nweek of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they been put\r\nto the proof; but as that very evening brought her brother down from\r\nLondon again in quite, or more than quite, his usual cheerfulness, she\r\nhad nothing farther to try her own. His still refusing to tell her what\r\nhe had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it might\r\nhave irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke\xe2\x80\x94suspected only of\r\nconcealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself. And the\r\nnext day _did_ bring a surprise to her. Henry had said he should just\r\ngo and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but\r\nhe was gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting\r\nfor him to walk with her in the garden, met him at last most\r\nimpatiently in the sweep, and cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Henry, where can you\r\nhave been all this time?\xe2\x80\x9d he had only to say that he had been sitting\r\nwith Lady Bertram and Fanny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSitting with them an hour and a half!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mary.\r\n\r\nBut this was only the beginning of her surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, drawing her arm within his, and walking along the\r\nsweep as if not knowing where he was: \xe2\x80\x9cI could not get away sooner;\r\nFanny looked so lovely! I am quite determined, Mary. My mind is\r\nentirely made up. Will it astonish you? No: you must be aware that I am\r\nquite determined to marry Fanny Price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever his\r\nconsciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his having any such views\r\nhad never entered his sister\xe2\x80\x99s imagination; and she looked so truly the\r\nastonishment she felt, that he was obliged to repeat what he had said,\r\nand more fully and more solemnly. The conviction of his determination\r\nonce admitted, it was not unwelcome. There was even pleasure with the\r\nsurprise. Mary was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with\r\nthe Bertram family, and to be not displeased with her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarrying a little beneath him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d was Henry\xe2\x80\x99s concluding assurance. \xe2\x80\x9cI am fairly caught. You\r\nknow with what idle designs I began; but this is the end of them. I\r\nhave, I flatter myself, made no inconsiderable progress in her\r\naffections; but my own are entirely fixed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucky, lucky girl!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary, as soon as she could speak; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a\r\nmatch for her! My dearest Henry, this must be my _first_ feeling; but\r\nmy _second_, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your\r\nchoice from my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish\r\nand desire it. You will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude and\r\ndevotion. Exactly what you deserve. What an amazing match for her! Mrs.\r\nNorris often talks of her luck; what will she say now? The delight of\r\nall the family, indeed! And she has some _true_ friends in it! How\r\n_they_ will rejoice! But tell me all about it! Talk to me for ever.\r\nWhen did you begin to think seriously about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question, though\r\nnothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow the\r\npleasing plague had stolen on him\xe2\x80\x9d he could not say; and before he had\r\nexpressed the same sentiment with a little variation of words three\r\ntimes over, his sister eagerly interrupted him with, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear\r\nHenry, and this is what took you to London! This was your business! You\r\nchose to consult the Admiral before you made up your mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this he stoutly denied. He knew his uncle too well to consult him\r\non any matrimonial scheme. The Admiral hated marriage, and thought it\r\nnever pardonable in a young man of independent fortune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Fanny is known to him,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Henry, \xe2\x80\x9che will doat on her.\r\nShe is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as\r\nthe Admiral, for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not\r\nexist in the world. She is the very impossibility he would describe, if\r\nindeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas.\r\nBut till it is absolutely settled\xe2\x80\x94settled beyond all interference, he\r\nshall know nothing of the matter. No, Mary, you are quite mistaken. You\r\nhave not discovered my business yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, I am satisfied. I know now to whom it must relate, and am\r\nin no hurry for the rest. Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful! That\r\nMansfield should have done so much for\xe2\x80\x94that _you_ should have found\r\nyour fate in Mansfield! But you are quite right; you could not have\r\nchosen better. There is not a better girl in the world, and you do not\r\nwant for fortune; and as to her connexions, they are more than good.\r\nThe Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country.\r\nShe is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world.\r\nBut go on, go on. Tell me more. What are your plans? Does she know her\r\nown happiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor\xe2\x80\x94for very little more than opportunity. Mary, she is not like her\r\ncousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! you cannot. Were you even less pleasing\xe2\x80\x94supposing her not to\r\nlove you already (of which, however, I can have little doubt)\xe2\x80\x94you would\r\nbe safe. The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure\r\nher all your own immediately. From my soul I do not think she would\r\nmarry you _without_ love; that is, if there is a girl in the world\r\ncapable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her; but\r\nask her to love you, and she will never have the heart to refuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as her eagerness could rest in silence, he was as happy to tell\r\nas she could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeply\r\ninteresting to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing to\r\nrelate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s charms.\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s beauty of face and figure, Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s graces of manner and\r\ngoodness of heart, were the exhaustless theme. The gentleness, modesty,\r\nand sweetness of her character were warmly expatiated on; that\r\nsweetness which makes so essential a part of every woman\xe2\x80\x99s worth in the\r\njudgment of man, that though he sometimes loves where it is not, he can\r\nnever believe it absent. Her temper he had good reason to depend on and\r\nto praise. He had often seen it tried. Was there one of the family,\r\nexcepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other continually\r\nexercised her patience and forbearance? Her affections were evidently\r\nstrong. To see her with her brother! What could more delightfully prove\r\nthat the warmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness? What could be\r\nmore encouraging to a man who had her love in view? Then, her\r\nunderstanding was beyond every suspicion, quick and clear; and her\r\nmanners were the mirror of her own modest and elegant mind. Nor was\r\nthis all. Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of\r\ngood principles in a wife, though he was too little accustomed to\r\nserious reflection to know them by their proper name; but when he\r\ntalked of her having such a steadiness and regularity of conduct, such\r\na high notion of honour, and such an observance of decorum as might\r\nwarrant any man in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity,\r\nhe expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her being well\r\nprincipled and religious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could so wholly and absolutely confide in her,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cand _that_\r\nis what I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell might his sister, believing as she really did that his opinion of\r\nFanny Price was scarcely beyond her merits, rejoice in her prospects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more I think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthe more am I convinced that you\r\nare doing quite right; and though I should never have selected Fanny\r\nPrice as the girl most likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she is\r\nthe very one to make you happy. Your wicked project upon her peace\r\nturns out a clever thought indeed. You will both find your good in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was bad, very bad in me against such a creature; but I did not know\r\nher then; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first\r\nput it into my head. I will make her very happy, Mary; happier than she\r\nhas ever yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else. I will not take\r\nher from Northamptonshire. I shall let Everingham, and rent a place in\r\nthis neighbourhood; perhaps Stanwix Lodge. I shall let a seven years\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlease of Everingham. I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word. I\r\ncould name three people now, who would give me my own terms and thank\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary; \xe2\x80\x9csettle in Northamptonshire! That is pleasant! Then\r\nwe shall be all together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had spoken it, she recollected herself, and wished it unsaid;\r\nbut there was no need of confusion; for her brother saw her only as the\r\nsupposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage, and replied but to invite her\r\nin the kindest manner to his own house, and to claim the best right in\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must give us more than half your time,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot admit\r\nMrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself, for we shall\r\nboth have a right in you. Fanny will be so truly your sister!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary had only to be grateful and give general assurances; but she was\r\nnow very fully purposed to be the guest of neither brother nor sister\r\nmany months longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right; and in London, of course, a house of your own: no longer\r\nwith the Admiral. My dearest Henry, the advantage to you of getting\r\naway from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of\r\nhis, before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions, or learned\r\nto sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life! _You_\r\nare not sensible of the gain, for your regard for him has blinded you;\r\nbut, in my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of you. To\r\nhave seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture,\r\nwould have broken my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, we do not think quite alike here. The Admiral has his\r\nfaults, but he is a very good man, and has been more than a father to\r\nme. Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much. You\r\nmust not prejudice Fanny against him. I must have them love one\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary refrained from saying what she felt, that there could not be two\r\npersons in existence whose characters and manners were less accordant:\r\ntime would discover it to him; but she could not help _this_ reflection\r\non the Admiral. \xe2\x80\x9cHenry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if I\r\ncould suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which\r\nmy poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name, I would prevent the\r\nmarriage, if possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you _loved_\r\nwould be the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased to love,\r\nshe would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of a\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny\r\nPrice happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price, was of course the\r\ngroundwork of his eloquent answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad you seen her this morning, Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cattending with\r\nsuch ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstupidity, working with her, and for her, her colour beautifully\r\nheightened as she leant over the work, then returning to her seat to\r\nfinish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that\r\nstupid woman\xe2\x80\x99s service, and all this with such unpretending gentleness,\r\nso much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a\r\nmoment at her own command, her hair arranged as neatly as it always is,\r\nand one little curl falling forward as she wrote, which she now and\r\nthen shook back, and in the midst of all this, still speaking at\r\nintervals to _me_, or listening, and as if she liked to listen, to what\r\nI said. Had you seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied the\r\npossibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary, stopping short, and smiling in his\r\nface, \xe2\x80\x9chow glad I am to see you so much in love! It quite delights me.\r\nBut what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI care neither what they say nor what they feel. They will now see\r\nwhat sort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of\r\nsense. I wish the discovery may do them any good. And they will now see\r\ntheir cousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be\r\nheartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness. They\r\nwill be angry,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, and in a cooler\r\ntone; \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Rushworth will be very angry. It will be a bitter pill to\r\nher; that is, like other bitter pills, it will have two moments\xe2\x80\x99 ill\r\nflavour, and then be swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a\r\ncoxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nthough _I_ was the object of them. Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel a\r\ndifference indeed: a daily, hourly difference, in the behaviour of\r\nevery being who approaches her; and it will be the completion of my\r\nhappiness to know that I am the doer of it, that I am the person to\r\ngive the consequence so justly her due. Now she is dependent, helpless,\r\nfriendless, neglected, forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless or\r\nforgotten. Her cousin Edmund never forgets her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdmund! True, I believe he is, generally speaking, kind to her, and so\r\nis Sir Thomas in his way; but it is the way of a rich, superior,\r\nlong-worded, arbitrary uncle. What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together\r\ndo, what _do_ they do for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity\r\nin the world, to what I _shall_ do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning, and at an\r\nearlier hour than common visiting warrants. The two ladies were\r\ntogether in the breakfast-room, and, fortunately for him, Lady Bertram\r\nwas on the very point of quitting it as he entered. She was almost at\r\nthe door, and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain,\r\nshe still went on, after a civil reception, a short sentence about\r\nbeing waited for, and a \xe2\x80\x9cLet Sir Thomas know\xe2\x80\x9d to the servant.\r\n\r\nHenry, overjoyed to have her go, bowed and watched her off, and without\r\nlosing another moment, turned instantly to Fanny, and, taking out some\r\nletters, said, with a most animated look, \xe2\x80\x9cI must acknowledge myself\r\ninfinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of\r\nseeing you alone: I have been wishing it more than you can have any\r\nidea. Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are, I could\r\nhardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in\r\nthe first knowledge of the news I now bring. He is made. Your brother\r\nis a lieutenant. I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you\r\non your brother\xe2\x80\x99s promotion. Here are the letters which announce it,\r\nthis moment come to hand. You will, perhaps, like to see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny could not speak, but he did not want her to speak. To see the\r\nexpression of her eyes, the change of her complexion, the progress of\r\nher feelings, their doubt, confusion, and felicity, was enough. She\r\ntook the letters as he gave them. The first was from the Admiral to\r\ninform his nephew, in a few words, of his having succeeded in the\r\nobject he had undertaken, the promotion of young Price, and enclosing\r\ntwo more, one from the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend, whom\r\nthe Admiral had set to work in the business, the other from that friend\r\nto himself, by which it appeared that his lordship had the very great\r\nhappiness of attending to the recommendation of Sir Charles; that Sir\r\nCharles was much delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his\r\nregard for Admiral Crawford, and that the circumstance of Mr. William\r\nPrice\xe2\x80\x99s commission as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made\r\nout was spreading general joy through a wide circle of great people.\r\n\r\nWhile her hand was trembling under these letters, her eye running from\r\none to the other, and her heart swelling with emotion, Crawford thus\r\ncontinued, with unfeigned eagerness, to express his interest in the\r\nevent\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not talk of my own happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cgreat as it is, for I\r\nthink only of yours. Compared with you, who has a right to be happy? I\r\nhave almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to\r\nhave known before all the world. I have not lost a moment, however. The\r\npost was late this morning, but there has not been since a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelay. How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject,\r\nI will not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly\r\ndisappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London! I was\r\nkept there from day to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dear to\r\nme than such an object would have detained me half the time from\r\nMansfield. But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the\r\nwarmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately, there were\r\ndifficulties from the absence of one friend, and the engagements of\r\nanother, which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of, and\r\nknowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came away on Monday,\r\ntrusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by\r\nsuch very letters as these. My uncle, who is the very best man in the\r\nworld, has exerted himself, as I knew he would, after seeing your\r\nbrother. He was delighted with him. I would not allow myself yesterday\r\nto say how delighted, or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his\r\npraise. I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise\r\nof a friend, as this day _does_ prove it. _Now_ I may say that even I\r\ncould not require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be\r\nfollowed by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most\r\nvoluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas this been all _your_ doing, then?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fanny. \xe2\x80\x9cGood heaven! how\r\nvery, very kind! Have you really\xe2\x80\x94was it by _your_ desire? I beg your\r\npardon, but I am bewildered. Did Admiral Crawford apply? How was it? I\r\nam stupefied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry was most happy to make it more intelligible, by beginning at an\r\nearlier stage, and explaining very particularly what he had done. His\r\nlast journey to London had been undertaken with no other view than that\r\nof introducing her brother in Hill Street, and prevailing on the\r\nAdmiral to exert whatever interest he might have for getting him on.\r\nThis had been his business. He had communicated it to no creature: he\r\nhad not breathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain of the\r\nissue, he could not have borne any participation of his feelings, but\r\nthis had been his business; and he spoke with such a glow of what his\r\nsolicitude had been, and used such strong expressions, was so abounding\r\nin the _deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_, in _views_ _and_\r\n_wishes_ _more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_, that Fanny could not have\r\nremained insensible of his drift, had she been able to attend; but her\r\nheart was so full and her senses still so astonished, that she could\r\nlisten but imperfectly even to what he told her of William, and saying\r\nonly when he paused, \xe2\x80\x9cHow kind! how very kind! Oh, Mr. Crawford, we are\r\ninfinitely obliged to you! Dearest, dearest William!\xe2\x80\x9d She jumped up and\r\nmoved in haste towards the door, crying out, \xe2\x80\x9cI will go to my uncle. My\r\nuncle ought to know it as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d But this could not be\r\nsuffered. The opportunity was too fair, and his feelings too impatient.\r\nHe was after her immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cShe must not go, she must allow him five\r\nminutes longer,\xe2\x80\x9d and he took her hand and led her back to her seat, and\r\nwas in the middle of his farther explanation, before she had suspected\r\nfor what she was detained. When she did understand it, however, and\r\nfound herself expected to believe that she had created sensations which\r\nhis heart had never known before, and that everything he had done for\r\nWilliam was to be placed to the account of his excessive and unequalled\r\nattachment to her, she was exceedingly distressed, and for some moments\r\nunable to speak. She considered it all as nonsense, as mere trifling\r\nand gallantry, which meant only to deceive for the hour; she could not\r\nbut feel that it was treating her improperly and unworthily, and in\r\nsuch a way as she had not deserved; but it was like himself, and\r\nentirely of a piece with what she had seen before; and she would not\r\nallow herself to shew half the displeasure she felt, because he had\r\nbeen conferring an obligation, which no want of delicacy on his part\r\ncould make a trifle to her. While her heart was still bounding with joy\r\nand gratitude on William\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, she could not be severely resentful\r\nof anything that injured only herself; and after having twice drawn\r\nback her hand, and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him, she\r\ngot up, and said only, with much agitation, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr. Crawford, pray\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t! I beg you would not. This is a sort of talking which is very\r\nunpleasant to me. I must go away. I cannot bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d But he was still\r\ntalking on, describing his affection, soliciting a return, and,\r\nfinally, in words so plain as to bear but one meaning even to her,\r\noffering himself, hand, fortune, everything, to her acceptance. It was\r\nso; he had said it. Her astonishment and confusion increased; and\r\nthough still not knowing how to suppose him serious, she could hardly\r\nstand. He pressed for an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, hiding her face. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is all nonsense. Do not\r\ndistress me. I can hear no more of this. Your kindness to William makes\r\nme more obliged to you than words can express; but I do not want, I\r\ncannot bear, I must not listen to such\xe2\x80\x94No, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t think of me. But\r\nyou are _not_ thinking of me. I know it is all nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had burst away from him, and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard\r\nspeaking to a servant in his way towards the room they were in. It was\r\nno time for farther assurances or entreaty, though to part with her at\r\na moment when her modesty alone seemed, to his sanguine and preassured\r\nmind, to stand in the way of the happiness he sought, was a cruel\r\nnecessity. She rushed out at an opposite door from the one her uncle\r\nwas approaching, and was walking up and down the East room in the\r\nutmost confusion of contrary feeling, before Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s politeness or\r\napologies were over, or he had reached the beginning of the joyful\r\nintelligence which his visitor came to communicate.\r\n\r\nShe was feeling, thinking, trembling about everything; agitated, happy,\r\nmiserable, infinitely obliged, absolutely angry. It was all beyond\r\nbelief! He was inexcusable, incomprehensible! But such were his habits\r\nthat he could do nothing without a mixture of evil. He had previously\r\nmade her the happiest of human beings, and now he had insulted\xe2\x80\x94she knew\r\nnot what to say, how to class, or how to regard it. She would not have\r\nhim be serious, and yet what could excuse the use of such words and\r\noffers, if they meant but to trifle?\r\n\r\nBut William was a lieutenant. _That_ was a fact beyond a doubt, and\r\nwithout an alloy. She would think of it for ever and forget all the\r\nrest. Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again: he must\r\nhave seen how unwelcome it was to her; and in that case, how gratefully\r\nshe could esteem him for his friendship to William!\r\n\r\nShe would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the\r\ngreat staircase, till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhaving left the house; but when convinced of his being gone, she was\r\neager to go down and be with her uncle, and have all the happiness of\r\nhis joy as well as her own, and all the benefit of his information or\r\nhis conjectures as to what would now be William\xe2\x80\x99s destination. Sir\r\nThomas was as joyful as she could desire, and very kind and\r\ncommunicative; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William\r\nas to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her, till she\r\nfound, towards the close, that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and\r\ndine there that very day. This was a most unwelcome hearing, for though\r\nhe might think nothing of what had passed, it would be quite\r\ndistressing to her to see him again so soon.\r\n\r\nShe tried to get the better of it; tried very hard, as the dinner hour\r\napproached, to feel and appear as usual; but it was quite impossible\r\nfor her not to look most shy and uncomfortable when their visitor\r\nentered the room. She could not have supposed it in the power of any\r\nconcurrence of circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on\r\nthe first day of hearing of William\xe2\x80\x99s promotion.\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford was not only in the room\xe2\x80\x94he was soon close to her. He had\r\na note to deliver from his sister. Fanny could not look at him, but\r\nthere was no consciousness of past folly in his voice. She opened her\r\nnote immediately, glad to have anything to do, and happy, as she read\r\nit, to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris, who was also to\r\ndine there, screened her a little from view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR FANNY,\xe2\x80\x94for so I may now always call you, to the infinite\r\nrelief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _Miss_ _Price_ for at\r\nleast the last six weeks\xe2\x80\x94I cannot let my brother go without sending you\r\na few lines of general congratulation, and giving my most joyful\r\nconsent and approval. Go on, my dear Fanny, and without fear; there can\r\nbe no difficulties worth naming. I chuse to suppose that the assurance\r\nof my consent will be something; so you may smile upon him with your\r\nsweetest smiles this afternoon, and send him back to me even happier\r\nthan he goes.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nM. C.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were not expressions to do Fanny any good; for though she read in\r\ntoo much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss\r\nCrawford\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, it was evident that she meant to compliment her on\r\nher brother\xe2\x80\x99s attachment, and even to _appear_ to believe it serious.\r\nShe did not know what to do, or what to think. There was wretchedness\r\nin the idea of its being serious; there was perplexity and agitation\r\nevery way. She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her, and\r\nhe spoke to her much too often; and she was afraid there was a\r\nsomething in his voice and manner in addressing her very different from\r\nwhat they were when he talked to the others. Her comfort in that day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndinner was quite destroyed: she could hardly eat anything; and when Sir\r\nThomas good-humouredly observed that joy had taken away her appetite,\r\nshe was ready to sink with shame, from the dread of Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterpretation; for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her\r\neyes to the right hand, where he sat, she felt that _his_ were\r\nimmediately directed towards her.\r\n\r\nShe was more silent than ever. She would hardly join even when William\r\nwas the subject, for his commission came all from the right hand too,\r\nand there was pain in the connexion.\r\n\r\nShe thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever, and began to be in\r\ndespair of ever getting away; but at last they were in the\r\ndrawing-room, and she was able to think as she would, while her aunts\r\nfinished the subject of William\xe2\x80\x99s appointment in their own style.\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be to Sir\r\nThomas as with any part of it. \xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ William would be able to keep\r\nhimself, which would make a vast difference to his uncle, for it was\r\nunknown how much he had cost his uncle; and, indeed, it would make some\r\ndifference in _her_ presents too. She was very glad that she had given\r\nWilliam what she did at parting, very glad, indeed, that it had been in\r\nher power, without material inconvenience, just at that time to give\r\nhim something rather considerable; that is, for _her_, with _her_\r\nlimited means, for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his\r\ncabin. She knew he must be at some expense, that he would have many\r\nthings to buy, though to be sure his father and mother would be able to\r\nput him in the way of getting everything very cheap; but she was very\r\nglad she had contributed her mite towards it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you gave him something considerable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Bertram,\r\nwith most unsuspicious calmness, \xe2\x80\x9cfor _I_ gave him only \xc2\xa310.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, reddening. \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, he must have\r\ngone off with his pockets well lined, and at no expense for his journey\r\nto London either!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Thomas told me \xc2\xa310 would be enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris, being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency,\r\nbegan to take the matter in another point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is amazing,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9chow much young people cost their friends,\r\nwhat with bringing them up and putting them out in the world! They\r\nlittle think how much it comes to, or what their parents, or their\r\nuncles and aunts, pay for them in the course of the year. Now, here are\r\nmy sister Price\xe2\x80\x99s children; take them all together, I dare say nobody\r\nwould believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year, to say\r\nnothing of what _I_ do for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, sister, as you say. But, poor things! they cannot help it;\r\nand you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas. Fanny,\r\nWilliam must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies; and I\r\nshall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having. I\r\nwish he may go to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl. I think I\r\nwill have two shawls, Fanny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she could not help it, was very\r\nearnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at.\r\nThere was everything in the world _against_ their being serious but his\r\nwords and manner. Everything natural, probable, reasonable, was against\r\nit; all their habits and ways of thinking, and all her own demerits.\r\nHow could _she_ have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen\r\nso many, and been admired by so many, and flirted with so many,\r\ninfinitely her superiors; who seemed so little open to serious\r\nimpressions, even where pains had been taken to please him; who thought\r\nso slightly, so carelessly, so unfeelingly on all such points; who was\r\neverything to everybody, and seemed to find no one essential to him?\r\nAnd farther, how could it be supposed that his sister, with all her\r\nhigh and worldly notions of matrimony, would be forwarding anything of\r\na serious nature in such a quarter? Nothing could be more unnatural in\r\neither. Fanny was ashamed of her own doubts. Everything might be\r\npossible rather than serious attachment, or serious approbation of it\r\ntoward her. She had quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas\r\nand Mr. Crawford joined them. The difficulty was in maintaining the\r\nconviction quite so absolutely after Mr. Crawford was in the room; for\r\nonce or twice a look seemed forced on her which she did not know how to\r\nclass among the common meaning; in any other man, at least, she would\r\nhave said that it meant something very earnest, very pointed. But she\r\nstill tried to believe it no more than what he might often have\r\nexpressed towards her cousins and fifty other women.\r\n\r\nShe thought he was wishing to speak to her unheard by the rest. She\r\nfancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals, whenever\r\nSir Thomas was out of the room, or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris, and\r\nshe carefully refused him every opportunity.\r\n\r\nAt last\xe2\x80\x94it seemed an at last to Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s nervousness, though not\r\nremarkably late\xe2\x80\x94he began to talk of going away; but the comfort of the\r\nsound was impaired by his turning to her the next moment, and saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you nothing to send to Mary? No answer to her note? She will be\r\ndisappointed if she receives nothing from you. Pray write to her, if it\r\nbe only a line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes! certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fanny, rising in haste, the haste of\r\nembarrassment and of wanting to get away\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI will write directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went accordingly to the table, where she was in the habit of\r\nwriting for her aunt, and prepared her materials without knowing what\r\nin the world to say. She had read Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s note only once, and\r\nhow to reply to anything so imperfectly understood was most\r\ndistressing. Quite unpractised in such sort of note-writing, had there\r\nbeen time for scruples and fears as to style she would have felt them\r\nin abundance: but something must be instantly written; and with only\r\none decided feeling, that of wishing not to appear to think anything\r\nreally intended, she wrote thus, in great trembling both of spirits and\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to you, my dear Miss Crawford, for your kind\r\ncongratulations, as far as they relate to my dearest William. The rest\r\nof your note I know means nothing; but I am so unequal to anything of\r\nthe sort, that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther\r\nnotice. I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his\r\nmanners; if he understood me as well, he would, I dare say, behave\r\ndifferently. I do not know what I write, but it would be a great favour\r\nof you never to mention the subject again. With thanks for the honour\r\nof your note,\r\n\r\n\r\nI remain, dear Miss Crawford,\r\n&c., &c.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright, for\r\nshe found that Mr. Crawford, under pretence of receiving the note, was\r\ncoming towards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot think I mean to hurry you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in an undervoice,\r\nperceiving the amazing trepidation with which she made up the note,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot think I have any such object. Do not hurry yourself, I\r\nentreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I thank you; I have quite done, just done; it will be ready in a\r\nmoment; I am very much obliged to you; if you will be so good as to\r\ngive _that_ to Miss Crawford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe note was held out, and must be taken; and as she instantly and with\r\naverted eyes walked towards the fireplace, where sat the others, he had\r\nnothing to do but to go in good earnest.\r\n\r\nFanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation, both of\r\npain and pleasure; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die\r\nwith the day; for every day would restore the knowledge of William\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadvancement, whereas the pain, she hoped, would return no more. She had\r\nno doubt that her note must appear excessively ill-written, that the\r\nlanguage would disgrace a child, for her distress had allowed no\r\narrangement; but at least it would assure them both of her being\r\nneither imposed on nor gratified by Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s attentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nFanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she awoke the next\r\nmorning; but she remembered the purport of her note, and was not less\r\nsanguine as to its effect than she had been the night before. If Mr.\r\nCrawford would but go away! That was what she most earnestly desired:\r\ngo and take his sister with him, as he was to do, and as he returned to\r\nMansfield on purpose to do. And why it was not done already she could\r\nnot devise, for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay. Fanny had\r\nhoped, in the course of his yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s visit, to hear the day named;\r\nbut he had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nHaving so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey,\r\nshe could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford, as she\r\naccidentally did, coming up to the house again, and at an hour as early\r\nas the day before. His coming might have nothing to do with her, but\r\nshe must avoid seeing him if possible; and being then on her way\r\nupstairs, she resolved there to remain, during the whole of his visit,\r\nunless actually sent for; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house,\r\nthere seemed little danger of her being wanted.\r\n\r\nShe sat some time in a good deal of agitation, listening, trembling,\r\nand fearing to be sent for every moment; but as no footsteps approached\r\nthe East room, she grew gradually composed, could sit down, and be able\r\nto employ herself, and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and\r\nwould go without her being obliged to know anything of the matter.\r\n\r\nNearly half an hour had passed, and she was growing very comfortable,\r\nwhen suddenly the sound of a step in regular approach was heard; a\r\nheavy step, an unusual step in that part of the house: it was her\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s; she knew it as well as his voice; she had trembled at it as\r\noften, and began to tremble again, at the idea of his coming up to\r\nspeak to her, whatever might be the subject. It was indeed Sir Thomas\r\nwho opened the door and asked if she were there, and if he might come\r\nin. The terror of his former occasional visits to that room seemed all\r\nrenewed, and she felt as if he were going to examine her again in\r\nFrench and English.\r\n\r\nShe was all attention, however, in placing a chair for him, and trying\r\nto appear honoured; and, in her agitation, had quite overlooked the\r\ndeficiencies of her apartment, till he, stopping short as he entered,\r\nsaid, with much surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you no fire to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was snow on the ground, and she was sitting in a shawl. She\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not cold, sir: I never sit here long at this time of year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have a fire in general?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow comes this about? Here must be some mistake. I understood that you\r\nhad the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable. In\r\nyour bedchamber I know you _cannot_ have a fire. Here is some great\r\nmisapprehension which must be rectified. It is highly unfit for you to\r\nsit, be it only half an hour a day, without a fire. You are not strong.\r\nYou are chilly. Your aunt cannot be aware of this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny would rather have been silent; but being obliged to speak, she\r\ncould not forbear, in justice to the aunt she loved best, from saying\r\nsomething in which the words \xe2\x80\x9cmy aunt Norris\xe2\x80\x9d were distinguishable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d cried her uncle, recollecting himself, and not wanting\r\nto hear more: \xe2\x80\x9cI understand. Your aunt Norris has always been an\r\nadvocate, and very judiciously, for young people\xe2\x80\x99s being brought up\r\nwithout unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation in\r\neverything. She is also very hardy herself, which of course will\r\ninfluence her in her opinion of the wants of others. And on another\r\naccount, too, I can perfectly comprehend. I know what her sentiments\r\nhave always been. The principle was good in itself, but it may have\r\nbeen, and I believe _has_ _been_, carried too far in your case. I am\r\naware that there has been sometimes, in some points, a misplaced\r\ndistinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny, to suppose you will\r\never harbour resentment on that account. You have an understanding\r\nwhich will prevent you from receiving things only in part, and judging\r\npartially by the event. You will take in the whole of the past, you\r\nwill consider times, persons, and probabilities, and you will feel that\r\n_they_ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you\r\nfor that mediocrity of condition which _seemed_ to be your lot. Though\r\ntheir caution may prove eventually unnecessary, it was kindly meant;\r\nand of this you may be assured, that every advantage of affluence will\r\nbe doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been\r\nimposed. I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you, by\r\nfailing at any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and\r\nattention that are due to her. But enough of this. Sit down, my dear. I\r\nmust speak to you for a few minutes, but I will not detain you long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny obeyed, with eyes cast down and colour rising. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npause, Sir Thomas, trying to suppress a smile, went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not aware, perhaps, that I have had a visitor this morning. I\r\nhad not been long in my own room, after breakfast, when Mr. Crawford\r\nwas shewn in. His errand you may probably conjecture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s colour grew deeper and deeper; and her uncle, perceiving that\r\nshe was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking up\r\nquite impossible, turned away his own eyes, and without any farther\r\npause proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s visit.\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny,\r\nmake decided proposals for her, and entreat the sanction of the uncle,\r\nwho seemed to stand in the place of her parents; and he had done it all\r\nso well, so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas,\r\nfeeling, moreover, his own replies, and his own remarks to have been\r\nvery much to the purpose, was exceedingly happy to give the particulars\r\nof their conversation; and little aware of what was passing in his\r\nniece\xe2\x80\x99s mind, conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her\r\nfar more than himself. He talked, therefore, for several minutes\r\nwithout Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s daring to interrupt him. She had hardly even attained\r\nthe wish to do it. Her mind was in too much confusion. She had changed\r\nher position; and, with her eyes fixed intently on one of the windows,\r\nwas listening to her uncle in the utmost perturbation and dismay. For a\r\nmoment he ceased, but she had barely become conscious of it, when,\r\nrising from his chair, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Fanny, having performed one\r\npart of my commission, and shewn you everything placed on a basis the\r\nmost assured and satisfactory, I may execute the remainder by\r\nprevailing on you to accompany me downstairs, where, though I cannot\r\nbut presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself, I must\r\nsubmit to your finding one still better worth listening to. Mr.\r\nCrawford, as you have perhaps foreseen, is yet in the house. He is in\r\nmy room, and hoping to see you there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a look, a start, an exclamation on hearing this, which\r\nastonished Sir Thomas; but what was his increase of astonishment on\r\nhearing her exclaim\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, sir, I cannot, indeed I cannot go down to\r\nhim. Mr. Crawford ought to know\xe2\x80\x94he must know that: I told him enough\r\nyesterday to convince him; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday,\r\nand I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me,\r\nand quite out of my power to return his good opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not catch your meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Thomas, sitting down again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of your power to return his good opinion? What is all this? I know\r\nhe spoke to you yesterday, and (as far as I understand) received as\r\nmuch encouragement to proceed as a well-judging young woman could\r\npermit herself to give. I was very much pleased with what I collected\r\nto have been your behaviour on the occasion; it shewed a discretion\r\nhighly to be commended. But now, when he has made his overtures so\r\nproperly, and honourably\xe2\x80\x94what are your scruples _now_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fanny, forced by the anxiety of the\r\nmoment even to tell her uncle that he was wrong; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are quite\r\nmistaken. How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing? I gave him no\r\nencouragement yesterday. On the contrary, I told him, I cannot\r\nrecollect my exact words, but I am sure I told him that I would not\r\nlisten to him, that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect, and\r\nthat I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again. I am sure I\r\nsaid as much as that and more; and I should have said still more, if I\r\nhad been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously; but I did not\r\nlike to be, I could not bear to be, imputing more than might be\r\nintended. I thought it might all pass for nothing with _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could say no more; her breath was almost gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Thomas, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 silence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat you mean to _refuse_ Mr. Crawford?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRefuse him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRefuse Mr. Crawford! Upon what plea? For what reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I cannot like him, sir, well enough to marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very strange!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Thomas, in a voice of calm\r\ndispleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something in this which my comprehension does\r\nnot reach. Here is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you,\r\nwith everything to recommend him: not merely situation in life,\r\nfortune, and character, but with more than common agreeableness, with\r\naddress and conversation pleasing to everybody. And he is not an\r\nacquaintance of to-day; you have now known him some time. His sister,\r\nmoreover, is your intimate friend, and he has been doing _that_ for\r\nyour brother, which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient\r\nrecommendation to you, had there been no other. It is very uncertain\r\nwhen my interest might have got William on. He has done it already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, in a faint voice, and looking down with fresh shame;\r\nand she did feel almost ashamed of herself, after such a picture as her\r\nuncle had drawn, for not liking Mr. Crawford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have been aware,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sir Thomas presently, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must\r\nhave been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s manners\r\nto you. This cannot have taken you by surprise. You must have observed\r\nhis attentions; and though you always received them very properly (I\r\nhave no accusation to make on that head), I never perceived them to be\r\nunpleasant to you. I am half inclined to think, Fanny, that you do not\r\nquite know your own feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, sir! indeed I do. His attentions were always\xe2\x80\x94what I did not\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Thomas looked at her with deeper surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is beyond me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he. \xe2\x80\x9cThis requires explanation. Young as you are, and having seen\r\nscarcely any one, it is hardly possible that your affections\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused and eyed her fixedly. He saw her lips formed into a _no_,\r\nthough the sound was inarticulate, but her face was like scarlet. That,\r\nhowever, in so modest a girl, might be very compatible with innocence;\r\nand chusing at least to appear satisfied, he quickly added, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I\r\nknow _that_ is quite out of the question; quite impossible. Well, there\r\nis nothing more to be said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd for a few minutes he did say nothing. He was deep in thought. His\r\nniece was deep in thought likewise, trying to harden and prepare\r\nherself against farther questioning. She would rather die than own the\r\ntruth; and she hoped, by a little reflection, to fortify herself beyond\r\nbetraying it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndependently of the interest which Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s _choice_ seemed to\r\njustify\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Thomas, beginning again, and very composedly, \xe2\x80\x9chis\r\nwishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me. I am an\r\nadvocate for early marriages, where there are means in proportion, and\r\nwould have every young man, with a sufficient income, settle as soon\r\nafter four-and-twenty as he can. This is so much my opinion, that I am\r\nsorry to think how little likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr.\r\nBertram, is to marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge,\r\nmatrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts. I wish he were more\r\nlikely to fix.\xe2\x80\x9d Here was a glance at Fanny. \xe2\x80\x9cEdmund, I consider, from\r\nhis dispositions and habits, as much more likely to marry early than\r\nhis brother. _He_, indeed, I have lately thought, has seen the woman he\r\ncould love, which, I am convinced, my eldest son has not. Am I right?\r\nDo you agree with me, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was gently, but it was calmly said, and Sir Thomas was easy on the\r\nscore of the cousins. But the removal of his alarm did his niece no\r\nservice: as her unaccountableness was confirmed his displeasure\r\nincreased; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown,\r\nwhich Fanny could picture to herself, though she dared not lift up her\r\neyes, he shortly afterwards, and in a voice of authority, said, \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou any reason, child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s temper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe longed to add, \xe2\x80\x9cBut of his principles I have\xe2\x80\x9d; but her heart sunk\r\nunder the appalling prospect of discussion, explanation, and probably\r\nnon-conviction. Her ill opinion of him was founded chiefly on\r\nobservations, which, for her cousins\xe2\x80\x99 sake, she could scarcely dare\r\nmention to their father. Maria and Julia, and especially Maria, were so\r\nclosely implicated in Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct, that she could not\r\ngive his character, such as she believed it, without betraying them.\r\nShe had hoped that, to a man like her uncle, so discerning, so\r\nhonourable, so good, the simple acknowledgment of settled _dislike_ on\r\nher side would have been sufficient. To her infinite grief she found it\r\nwas not.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas came towards the table where she sat in trembling\r\nwretchedness, and with a good deal of cold sternness, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is of\r\nno use, I perceive, to talk to you. We had better put an end to this\r\nmost mortifying conference. Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer\r\nwaiting. I will, therefore, only add, as thinking it my duty to mark my\r\nopinion of your conduct, that you have disappointed every expectation I\r\nhad formed, and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what\r\nI had supposed. For I _had_, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have\r\nshewn, formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my\r\nreturn to England. I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of\r\ntemper, self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit\r\nwhich prevails so much in modern days, even in young women, and which\r\nin young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence.\r\nBut you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you\r\ncan and will decide for yourself, without any consideration or\r\ndeference for those who have surely some right to guide you, without\r\neven asking their advice. You have shewn yourself very, very different\r\nfrom anything that I had imagined. The advantage or disadvantage of\r\nyour family, of your parents, your brothers and sisters, never seems to\r\nhave had a moment\xe2\x80\x99s share in your thoughts on this occasion. How _they_\r\nmight be benefited, how _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment\r\nfor you, is nothing to _you_. You think only of yourself, and because\r\nyou do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy\r\nimagines to be necessary for happiness, you resolve to refuse him at\r\nonce, without wishing even for a little time to consider of it, a\r\nlittle more time for cool consideration, and for really examining your\r\nown inclinations; and are, in a wild fit of folly, throwing away from\r\nyou such an opportunity of being settled in life, eligibly, honourably,\r\nnobly settled, as will, probably, never occur to you again. Here is a\r\nyoung man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners, and of\r\nfortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking your hand in the most\r\nhandsome and disinterested way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you\r\nmay live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by\r\na man of half Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s estate, or a tenth part of his merits.\r\nGladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him. Maria\r\nis nobly married; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia\xe2\x80\x99s hand, I should\r\nhave given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than\r\nI gave Maria\xe2\x80\x99s to Mr. Rushworth.\xe2\x80\x9d After half a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\r\nshould have been very much surprised had either of my daughters, on\r\nreceiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it\r\nonly _half_ the eligibility of _this_, immediately and peremptorily,\r\nand without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any\r\nconsultation, put a decided negative on it. I should have been much\r\nsurprised and much hurt by such a proceeding. I should have thought it\r\na gross violation of duty and respect. _You_ are not to be judged by\r\nthe same rule. You do not owe me the duty of a child. But, Fanny, if\r\nyour heart can acquit you of _ingratitude_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ceased. Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that, angry as he\r\nwas, he would not press that article farther. Her heart was almost\r\nbroke by such a picture of what she appeared to him; by such\r\naccusations, so heavy, so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation!\r\nSelf-willed, obstinate, selfish, and ungrateful. He thought her all\r\nthis. She had deceived his expectations; she had lost his good opinion.\r\nWhat was to become of her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said she inarticulately, through her tears, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nvery sorry indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry! yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will probably have reason to\r\nbe long sorry for this day\xe2\x80\x99s transactions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were possible for me to do otherwise\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with another\r\nstrong effort; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make\r\nhim happy, and that I should be miserable myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother burst of tears; but in spite of that burst, and in spite of\r\nthat great black word _miserable_, which served to introduce it, Sir\r\nThomas began to think a little relenting, a little change of\r\ninclination, might have something to do with it; and to augur\r\nfavourably from the personal entreaty of the young man himself. He knew\r\nher to be very timid, and exceedingly nervous; and thought it not\r\nimprobable that her mind might be in such a state as a little time, a\r\nlittle pressing, a little patience, and a little impatience, a\r\njudicious mixture of all on the lover\xe2\x80\x99s side, might work their usual\r\neffect on. If the gentleman would but persevere, if he had but love\r\nenough to persevere, Sir Thomas began to have hopes; and these\r\nreflections having passed across his mind and cheered it, \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, in a tone of becoming gravity, but of less anger, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, child, dry\r\nup your tears. There is no use in these tears; they can do no good. You\r\nmust now come downstairs with me. Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting\r\ntoo long already. You must give him your own answer: we cannot expect\r\nhim to be satisfied with less; and you only can explain to him the\r\ngrounds of that misconception of your sentiments, which, unfortunately\r\nfor himself, he certainly has imbibed. I am totally unequal to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the idea of going\r\ndown to him, that Sir Thomas, after a little consideration, judged it\r\nbetter to indulge her. His hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered\r\na small depression in consequence; but when he looked at his niece, and\r\nsaw the state of feature and complexion which her crying had brought\r\nher into, he thought there might be as much lost as gained by an\r\nimmediate interview. With a few words, therefore, of no particular\r\nmeaning, he walked off by himself, leaving his poor niece to sit and\r\ncry over what had passed, with very wretched feelings.\r\n\r\nHer mind was all disorder. The past, present, future, everything was\r\nterrible. But her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s anger gave her the severest pain of all.\r\nSelfish and ungrateful! to have appeared so to him! She was miserable\r\nfor ever. She had no one to take her part, to counsel, or speak for\r\nher. Her only friend was absent. He might have softened his father; but\r\nall, perhaps all, would think her selfish and ungrateful. She might\r\nhave to endure the reproach again and again; she might hear it, or see\r\nit, or know it to exist for ever in every connexion about her. She\r\ncould not but feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford; yet, if he\r\nreally loved her, and were unhappy too! It was all wretchedness\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned; she was almost ready\r\nto faint at the sight of him. He spoke calmly, however, without\r\nausterity, without reproach, and she revived a little. There was\r\ncomfort, too, in his words, as well as his manner, for he began with,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Crawford is gone: he has just left me. I need not repeat what has\r\npassed. I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling, by an\r\naccount of what he has felt. Suffice it, that he has behaved in the\r\nmost gentlemanlike and generous manner, and has confirmed me in a most\r\nfavourable opinion of his understanding, heart, and temper. Upon my\r\nrepresentation of what you were suffering, he immediately, and with the\r\ngreatest delicacy, ceased to urge to see you for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Fanny, who had looked up, looked down again. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued her uncle, \xe2\x80\x9cit cannot be supposed but that he should request\r\nto speak with you alone, be it only for five minutes; a request too\r\nnatural, a claim too just to be denied. But there is no time fixed;\r\nperhaps to-morrow, or whenever your spirits are composed enough. For\r\nthe present you have only to tranquillise yourself. Check these tears;\r\nthey do but exhaust you. If, as I am willing to suppose, you wish to\r\nshew me any observance, you will not give way to these emotions, but\r\nendeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind. I advise\r\nyou to go out: the air will do you good; go out for an hour on the\r\ngravel; you will have the shrubbery to yourself, and will be the better\r\nfor air and exercise. And, Fanny\xe2\x80\x9d (turning back again for a moment), \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall make no mention below of what has passed; I shall not even tell\r\nyour aunt Bertram. There is no occasion for spreading the\r\ndisappointment; say nothing about it yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was an order to be most joyfully obeyed; this was an act of\r\nkindness which Fanny felt at her heart. To be spared from her aunt\r\nNorris\xe2\x80\x99s interminable reproaches! he left her in a glow of gratitude.\r\nAnything might be bearable rather than such reproaches. Even to see Mr.\r\nCrawford would be less overpowering.\r\n\r\nShe walked out directly, as her uncle recommended, and followed his\r\nadvice throughout, as far as she could; did check her tears; did\r\nearnestly try to compose her spirits and strengthen her mind. She\r\nwished to prove to him that she did desire his comfort, and sought to\r\nregain his favour; and he had given her another strong motive for\r\nexertion, in keeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her aunts.\r\nNot to excite suspicion by her look or manner was now an object worth\r\nattaining; and she felt equal to almost anything that might save her\r\nfrom her aunt Norris.\r\n\r\nShe was struck, quite struck, when, on returning from her walk and\r\ngoing into the East room again, the first thing which caught her eye\r\nwas a fire lighted and burning. A fire! it seemed too much; just at\r\nthat time to be giving her such an indulgence was exciting even painful\r\ngratitude. She wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of\r\nsuch a trifle again; but she soon found, from the voluntary information\r\nof the housemaid, who came in to attend it, that so it was to be every\r\nday. Sir Thomas had given orders for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be a brute, indeed, if I can be really ungrateful!\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\nin soliloquy. \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven defend me from being ungrateful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw nothing more of her uncle, nor of her aunt Norris, till they\r\nmet at dinner. Her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour to her was then as nearly as\r\npossible what it had been before; she was sure he did not mean there\r\nshould be any change, and that it was only her own conscience that\r\ncould fancy any; but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her; and when\r\nshe found how much and how unpleasantly her having only walked out\r\nwithout her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge could be dwelt on, she felt all the reason\r\nshe had to bless the kindness which saved her from the same spirit of\r\nreproach, exerted on a more momentous subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had known you were going out, I should have got you just to go as\r\nfar as my house with some orders for Nanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I have\r\nsince, to my very great inconvenience, been obliged to go and carry\r\nmyself. I could very ill spare the time, and you might have saved me\r\nthe trouble, if you would only have been so good as to let us know you\r\nwere going out. It would have made no difference to you, I suppose,\r\nwhether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir\r\nThomas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Norris, with a moment\xe2\x80\x99s check, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was very kind of\r\nyou, Sir Thomas; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house.\r\nFanny would have had quite as good a walk there, I assure you, with the\r\nadvantage of being of some use, and obliging her aunt: it is all her\r\nfault. If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is\r\na something about Fanny, I have often observed it before\xe2\x80\x94she likes to\r\ngo her own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to; she takes\r\nher own independent walk whenever she can; she certainly has a little\r\nspirit of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her, which I\r\nwould advise her to get the better of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could be\r\nmore unjust, though he had been so lately expressing the same\r\nsentiments himself, and he tried to turn the conversation: tried\r\nrepeatedly before he could succeed; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment\r\nenough to perceive, either now, or at any other time, to what degree he\r\nthought well of his niece, or how very far he was from wishing to have\r\nhis own children\xe2\x80\x99s merits set off by the depreciation of hers. She was\r\ntalking _at_ Fanny, and resenting this private walk half through the\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nIt was over, however, at last; and the evening set in with more\r\ncomposure to Fanny, and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could\r\nhave hoped for after so stormy a morning; but she trusted, in the first\r\nplace, that she had done right: that her judgment had not misled her.\r\nFor the purity of her intentions she could answer; and she was willing\r\nto hope, secondly, that her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure was abating, and would\r\nabate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality, and\r\nfelt, as a good man must feel, how wretched, and how unpardonable, how\r\nhopeless, and how wicked it was to marry without affection.\r\n\r\nWhen the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past,\r\nshe could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally\r\nconcluded, and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield, that everything\r\nwould soon be as if no such subject had existed. She would not, could\r\nnot believe, that Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s affection for her could distress him\r\nlong; his mind was not of that sort. London would soon bring its cure.\r\nIn London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation, and be\r\nthankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evil\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nWhile Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes, her uncle was,\r\nsoon after tea, called out of the room; an occurrence too common to\r\nstrike her, and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared\r\nten minutes afterwards, and advancing decidedly towards herself, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Thomas wishes to speak with you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, in his own room.\xe2\x80\x9d Then it\r\noccurred to her what might be going on; a suspicion rushed over her\r\nmind which drove the colour from her cheeks; but instantly rising, she\r\nwas preparing to obey, when Mrs. Norris called out, \xe2\x80\x9cStay, stay, Fanny!\r\nwhat are you about? where are you going? don\xe2\x80\x99t be in such a hurry.\r\nDepend upon it, it is not you who are wanted; depend upon it, it is me\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(looking at the butler); \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are so very eager to put yourself\r\nforward. What should Sir Thomas want you for? It is me, Baddeley, you\r\nmean; I am coming this moment. You mean me, Baddeley, I am sure; Sir\r\nThomas wants me, not Miss Price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Baddeley was stout. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, it is Miss Price; I am certain of\r\nits being Miss Price.\xe2\x80\x9d And there was a half-smile with the words, which\r\nmeant, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not think you would answer the purpose at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris, much discontented, was obliged to compose herself to work\r\nagain; and Fanny, walking off in agitating consciousness, found\r\nherself, as she anticipated, in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference was neither so short nor so conclusive as the lady had\r\ndesigned. The gentleman was not so easily satisfied. He had all the\r\ndisposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him. He had vanity,\r\nwhich strongly inclined him in the first place to think she did love\r\nhim, though she might not know it herself; and which, secondly, when\r\nconstrained at last to admit that she did know her own present\r\nfeelings, convinced him that he should be able in time to make those\r\nfeelings what he wished.\r\n\r\nHe was in love, very much in love; and it was a love which, operating\r\non an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth than delicacy, made her\r\naffection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld, and\r\ndetermined him to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcing\r\nher to love him.\r\n\r\nHe would not despair: he would not desist. He had every well-grounded\r\nreason for solid attachment; he knew her to have all the worth that\r\ncould justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with her; her\r\nconduct at this very time, by speaking the disinterestedness and\r\ndelicacy of her character (qualities which he believed most rare\r\nindeed), was of a sort to heighten all his wishes, and confirm all his\r\nresolutions. He knew not that he had a pre-engaged heart to attack. Of\r\n_that_ he had no suspicion. He considered her rather as one who had\r\nnever thought on the subject enough to be in danger; who had been\r\nguarded by youth, a youth of mind as lovely as of person; whose modesty\r\nhad prevented her from understanding his attentions, and who was still\r\noverpowered by the suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected, and\r\nthe novelty of a situation which her fancy had never taken into\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nMust it not follow of course, that, when he was understood, he should\r\nsucceed? He believed it fully. Love such as his, in a man like himself,\r\nmust with perseverance secure a return, and at no great distance; and\r\nhe had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a\r\nvery short time, that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted. A\r\nlittle difficulty to be overcome was no evil to Henry Crawford. He\r\nrather derived spirits from it. He had been apt to gain hearts too\r\neasily. His situation was new and animating.\r\n\r\nTo Fanny, however, who had known too much opposition all her life to\r\nfind any charm in it, all this was unintelligible. She found that he\r\ndid mean to persevere; but how he could, after such language from her\r\nas she felt herself obliged to use, was not to be understood. She told\r\nhim that she did not love him, could not love him, was sure she never\r\nshould love him; that such a change was quite impossible; that the\r\nsubject was most painful to her; that she must entreat him never to\r\nmention it again, to allow her to leave him at once, and let it be\r\nconsidered as concluded for ever. And when farther pressed, had added,\r\nthat in her opinion their dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to\r\nmake mutual affection incompatible; and that they were unfitted for\r\neach other by nature, education, and habit. All this she had said, and\r\nwith the earnestness of sincerity; yet this was not enough, for he\r\nimmediately denied there being anything uncongenial in their\r\ncharacters, or anything unfriendly in their situations; and positively\r\ndeclared, that he would still love, and still hope!\r\n\r\nFanny knew her own meaning, but was no judge of her own manner. Her\r\nmanner was incurably gentle; and she was not aware how much it\r\nconcealed the sternness of her purpose. Her diffidence, gratitude, and\r\nsoftness made every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of\r\nself-denial; seem, at least, to be giving nearly as much pain to\r\nherself as to him. Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who, as\r\nthe clandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram, had\r\nbeen her abhorrence, whom she had hated to see or to speak to, in whom\r\nshe could believe no good quality to exist, and whose power, even of\r\nbeing agreeable, she had barely acknowledged. He was now the Mr.\r\nCrawford who was addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love;\r\nwhose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and\r\nupright, whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of\r\nattachment; who was pouring out his sense of her merits, describing and\r\ndescribing again his affection, proving as far as words could prove it,\r\nand in the language, tone, and spirit of a man of talent too, that he\r\nsought her for her gentleness and her goodness; and to complete the\r\nwhole, he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npromotion!\r\n\r\nHere was a change, and here were claims which could not but operate!\r\nShe might have disdained him in all the dignity of angry virtue, in the\r\ngrounds of Sotherton, or the theatre at Mansfield Park; but he\r\napproached her now with rights that demanded different treatment. She\r\nmust be courteous, and she must be compassionate. She must have a\r\nsensation of being honoured, and whether thinking of herself or her\r\nbrother, she must have a strong feeling of gratitude. The effect of the\r\nwhole was a manner so pitying and agitated, and words intermingled with\r\nher refusal so expressive of obligation and concern, that to a temper\r\nof vanity and hope like Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s, the truth, or at least the strength\r\nof her indifference, might well be questionable; and he was not so\r\nirrational as Fanny considered him, in the professions of persevering,\r\nassiduous, and not desponding attachment which closed the interview.\r\n\r\nIt was with reluctance that he suffered her to go; but there was no\r\nlook of despair in parting to belie his words, or give her hopes of his\r\nbeing less unreasonable than he professed himself.\r\n\r\nNow she was angry. Some resentment did arise at a perseverance so\r\nselfish and ungenerous. Here was again a want of delicacy and regard\r\nfor others which had formerly so struck and disgusted her. Here was\r\nagain a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated\r\nbefore. How evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity\r\nwhere his own pleasure was concerned\xe2\x80\x94And, alas! how always known no\r\nprinciple to supply as a duty what the heart was deficient in. Had her\r\nown affections been as free\xe2\x80\x94as perhaps they ought to have been\xe2\x80\x94he never\r\ncould have engaged them.\r\n\r\nSo thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness, as she sat musing\r\nover that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs: wondering\r\nat the past and present; wondering at what was yet to come, and in a\r\nnervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of\r\nher being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford, and\r\nthe felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas was obliged, or obliged himself, to wait till the morrow for\r\na knowledge of what had passed between the young people. He then saw\r\nMr. Crawford, and received his account. The first feeling was\r\ndisappointment: he had hoped better things; he had thought that an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so\r\nlittle change on a gentle-tempered girl like Fanny; but there was\r\nspeedy comfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the\r\nlover; and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal, Sir\r\nThomas was soon able to depend on it himself.\r\n\r\nNothing was omitted, on his side, of civility, compliment, or kindness,\r\nthat might assist the plan. Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s steadiness was honoured, and\r\nFanny was praised, and the connexion was still the most desirable in\r\nthe world. At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome; he\r\nhad only to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency\r\nof his visits, at present or in future. In all his niece\xe2\x80\x99s family and\r\nfriends, there could be but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the\r\ninfluence of all who loved her must incline one way.\r\n\r\nEverything was said that could encourage, every encouragement received\r\nwith grateful joy, and the gentlemen parted the best of friends.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper and\r\nhopeful, Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunity\r\nwith his niece, and to shew no open interference. Upon her disposition\r\nhe believed kindness might be the best way of working. Entreaty should\r\nbe from one quarter only. The forbearance of her family on a point,\r\nrespecting which she could be in no doubt of their wishes, might be\r\ntheir surest means of forwarding it. Accordingly, on this principle,\r\nSir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her, with a mild\r\ngravity, intended to be overcoming, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Fanny, I have seen Mr.\r\nCrawford again, and learn from him exactly how matters stand between\r\nyou. He is a most extraordinary young man, and whatever be the event,\r\nyou must feel that you have created an attachment of no common\r\ncharacter; though, young as you are, and little acquainted with the\r\ntransient, varying, unsteady nature of love, as it generally exists,\r\nyou cannot be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a\r\nperseverance of this sort against discouragement. With him it is\r\nentirely a matter of feeling: he claims no merit in it; perhaps is\r\nentitled to none. Yet, having chosen so well, his constancy has a\r\nrespectable stamp. Had his choice been less unexceptionable, I should\r\nhave condemned his persevering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should\r\ncontinue to\xe2\x80\x94I know that it is paying me a very great compliment, and I\r\nfeel most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and I\r\nhave told him so, that it never will be in my power\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Sir Thomas, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no occasion for this. Your\r\nfeelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to\r\nyou. There is nothing more to be said or done. From this hour the\r\nsubject is never to be revived between us. You will have nothing to\r\nfear, or to be agitated about. You cannot suppose me capable of trying\r\nto persuade you to marry against your inclinations. Your happiness and\r\nadvantage are all that I have in view, and nothing is required of you\r\nbut to bear with Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s endeavours to convince you that they\r\nmay not be incompatible with his. He proceeds at his own risk. You are\r\non safe ground. I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls,\r\nas you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred. You will see\r\nhim with the rest of us, in the same manner, and, as much as you can,\r\ndismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant. He leaves\r\nNorthamptonshire so soon, that even this slight sacrifice cannot be\r\noften demanded. The future must be very uncertain. And now, my dear\r\nFanny, this subject is closed between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much\r\nsatisfaction. Her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s kind expressions, however, and forbearing\r\nmanner, were sensibly felt; and when she considered how much of the\r\ntruth was unknown to him, she believed she had no right to wonder at\r\nthe line of conduct he pursued. He, who had married a daughter to Mr.\r\nRushworth: romantic delicacy was certainly not to be expected from him.\r\nShe must do her duty, and trust that time might make her duty easier\r\nthan it now was.\r\n\r\nShe could not, though only eighteen, suppose Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s attachment\r\nwould hold out for ever; she could not but imagine that steady,\r\nunceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time.\r\nHow much time she might, in her own fancy, allot for its dominion, is\r\nanother concern. It would not be fair to inquire into a young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexact estimate of her own perfections.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself once more\r\nobliged to mention the subject to his niece, to prepare her briefly for\r\nits being imparted to her aunts; a measure which he would still have\r\navoided, if possible, but which became necessary from the totally\r\nopposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding. He\r\nhad no idea of concealment. It was all known at the Parsonage, where he\r\nloved to talk over the future with both his sisters, and it would be\r\nrather gratifying to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress\r\nof his success. When Sir Thomas understood this, he felt the necessity\r\nof making his own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business\r\nwithout delay; though, on Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s account, he almost dreaded the effect\r\nof the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself. He\r\ndeprecated her mistaken but well-meaning zeal. Sir Thomas, indeed, was,\r\nby this time, not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those\r\nwell-meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris, however, relieved him. He pressed for the strictest\r\nforbearance and silence towards their niece; she not only promised, but\r\ndid observe it. She only looked her increased ill-will. Angry she was:\r\nbitterly angry; but she was more angry with Fanny for having received\r\nsuch an offer than for refusing it. It was an injury and affront to\r\nJulia, who ought to have been Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s choice; and, independently\r\nof that, she disliked Fanny, because she had neglected her; and she\r\nwould have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been always\r\ntrying to depress.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the occasion than she\r\ndeserved; and Fanny could have blessed her for allowing her only to see\r\nher displeasure, and not to hear it.\r\n\r\nLady Bertram took it differently. She had been a beauty, and a\r\nprosperous beauty, all her life; and beauty and wealth were all that\r\nexcited her respect. To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of\r\nfortune, raised her, therefore, very much in her opinion. By convincing\r\nher that Fanny _was_ very pretty, which she had been doubting about\r\nbefore, and that she would be advantageously married, it made her feel\r\na sort of credit in calling her niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as soon as they were alone together\r\nafterwards, and she really had known something like impatience to be\r\nalone with her, and her countenance, as she spoke, had extraordinary\r\nanimation; \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Fanny, I have had a very agreeable surprise this\r\nmorning. I must just speak of it _once_, I told Sir Thomas I must\r\n_once_, and then I shall have done. I give you joy, my dear niece.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nlooking at her complacently, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cHumph, we certainly are a\r\nhandsome family!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny coloured, and doubted at first what to say; when, hoping to\r\nassail her on her vulnerable side, she presently answered\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear aunt, _you_ cannot wish me to do differently from what I have\r\ndone, I am sure. _You_ cannot wish me to marry; for you would miss me,\r\nshould not you? Yes, I am sure you would miss me too much for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear, I should not think of missing you, when such an offer as\r\nthis comes in your way. I could do very well without you, if you were\r\nmarried to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford. And you must be\r\naware, Fanny, that it is every young woman\xe2\x80\x99s duty to accept such a very\r\nunexceptionable offer as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was almost the only rule of conduct, the only piece of advice,\r\nwhich Fanny had ever received from her aunt in the course of eight\r\nyears and a half. It silenced her. She felt how unprofitable contention\r\nwould be. If her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s feelings were against her, nothing could be\r\nhoped from attacking her understanding. Lady Bertram was quite\r\ntalkative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure he fell in love\r\nwith you at the ball; I am sure the mischief was done that evening. You\r\ndid look remarkably well. Everybody said so. Sir Thomas said so. And\r\nyou know you had Chapman to help you to dress. I am very glad I sent\r\nChapman to you. I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that\r\nevening.\xe2\x80\x9d And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts, she soon\r\nafterwards added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than\r\nI did for Maria: the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a\r\npuppy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund had great things to hear on his return. Many surprises were\r\nawaiting him. The first that occurred was not least in interest: the\r\nappearance of Henry Crawford and his sister walking together through\r\nthe village as he rode into it. He had concluded\xe2\x80\x94he had meant them to\r\nbe far distant. His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight\r\npurposely to avoid Miss Crawford. He was returning to Mansfield with\r\nspirits ready to feed on melancholy remembrances, and tender\r\nassociations, when her own fair self was before him, leaning on her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and he found himself receiving a welcome, unquestionably\r\nfriendly, from the woman whom, two moments before, he had been thinking\r\nof as seventy miles off, and as farther, much farther, from him in\r\ninclination than any distance could express.\r\n\r\nHer reception of him was of a sort which he could not have hoped for,\r\nhad he expected to see her. Coming as he did from such a purport\r\nfulfilled as had taken him away, he would have expected anything rather\r\nthan a look of satisfaction, and words of simple, pleasant meaning. It\r\nwas enough to set his heart in a glow, and to bring him home in the\r\nproperest state for feeling the full value of the other joyful\r\nsurprises at hand.\r\n\r\nWilliam\xe2\x80\x99s promotion, with all its particulars, he was soon master of;\r\nand with such a secret provision of comfort within his own breast to\r\nhelp the joy, he found in it a source of most gratifying sensation and\r\nunvarying cheerfulness all dinner-time.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, when he and his father were alone, he had Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhistory; and then all the great events of the last fortnight, and the\r\npresent situation of matters at Mansfield were known to him.\r\n\r\nFanny suspected what was going on. They sat so much longer than usual\r\nin the dining-parlour, that she was sure they must be talking of her;\r\nand when tea at last brought them away, and she was to be seen by\r\nEdmund again, she felt dreadfully guilty. He came to her, sat down by\r\nher, took her hand, and pressed it kindly; and at that moment she\r\nthought that, but for the occupation and the scene which the tea-things\r\nafforded, she must have betrayed her emotion in some unpardonable\r\nexcess.\r\n\r\nHe was not intending, however, by such action, to be conveying to her\r\nthat unqualified approbation and encouragement which her hopes drew\r\nfrom it. It was designed only to express his participation in all that\r\ninterested her, and to tell her that he had been hearing what quickened\r\nevery feeling of affection. He was, in fact, entirely on his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside of the question. His surprise was not so great as his father\xe2\x80\x99s at\r\nher refusing Crawford, because, so far from supposing her to consider\r\nhim with anything like a preference, he had always believed it to be\r\nrather the reverse, and could imagine her to be taken perfectly\r\nunprepared, but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more\r\ndesirable than he did. It had every recommendation to him; and while\r\nhonouring her for what she had done under the influence of her present\r\nindifference, honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas\r\ncould quite echo, he was most earnest in hoping, and sanguine in\r\nbelieving, that it would be a match at last, and that, united by mutual\r\naffection, it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly\r\nfitted to make them blessed in each other, as he was now beginning\r\nseriously to consider them. Crawford had been too precipitate. He had\r\nnot given her time to attach herself. He had begun at the wrong end.\r\nWith such powers as his, however, and such a disposition as hers,\r\nEdmund trusted that everything would work out a happy conclusion.\r\nMeanwhile, he saw enough of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassment to make him\r\nscrupulously guard against exciting it a second time, by any word, or\r\nlook, or movement.\r\n\r\nCrawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s return, Sir\r\nThomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner; it\r\nwas really a necessary compliment. He staid of course, and Edmund had\r\nthen ample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what\r\ndegree of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her\r\nmanners; and it was so little, so very, very little\xe2\x80\x94every chance, every\r\npossibility of it, resting upon her embarrassment only; if there was\r\nnot hope in her confusion, there was hope in nothing else\xe2\x80\x94that he was\r\nalmost ready to wonder at his friend\xe2\x80\x99s perseverance. Fanny was worth it\r\nall; he held her to be worth every effort of patience, every exertion\r\nof mind, but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any\r\nwoman breathing, without something more to warm his courage than his\r\neyes could discern in hers. He was very willing to hope that Crawford\r\nsaw clearer, and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his\r\nfriend that he could come to from all that he observed to pass before,\r\nand at, and after dinner.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought more\r\npromising. When he and Crawford walked into the drawing-room, his\r\nmother and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if\r\nthere were nothing else to care for. Edmund could not help noticing\r\ntheir apparently deep tranquillity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not been so silent all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cFanny\r\nhas been reading to me, and only put the book down upon hearing you\r\ncoming.\xe2\x80\x9d And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the\r\nair of being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare. \xe2\x80\x9cShe often\r\nreads to me out of those books; and she was in the middle of a very\r\nfine speech of that man\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s his name, Fanny?\xe2\x80\x94when we heard your\r\nfootsteps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrawford took the volume. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me have the pleasure of finishing that\r\nspeech to your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall find it immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nby carefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves, he did find\r\nit, or within a page or two, quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram,\r\nwho assured him, as soon as he mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey,\r\nthat he had got the very speech. Not a look or an offer of help had\r\nFanny given; not a syllable for or against. All her attention was for\r\nher work. She seemed determined to be interested by nothing else. But\r\ntaste was too strong in her. She could not abstract her mind five\r\nminutes: she was forced to listen; his reading was capital, and her\r\npleasure in good reading extreme. To _good_ reading, however, she had\r\nbeen long used: her uncle read well, her cousins all, Edmund very well,\r\nbut in Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s reading there was a variety of excellence beyond\r\nwhat she had ever met with. The King, the Queen, Buckingham, Wolsey,\r\nCromwell, all were given in turn; for with the happiest knack, the\r\nhappiest power of jumping and guessing, he could always alight at will\r\non the best scene, or the best speeches of each; and whether it were\r\ndignity, or pride, or tenderness, or remorse, or whatever were to be\r\nexpressed, he could do it with equal beauty. It was truly dramatic. His\r\nacting had first taught Fanny what pleasure a play might give, and his\r\nreading brought all his acting before her again; nay, perhaps with\r\ngreater enjoyment, for it came unexpectedly, and with no such drawback\r\nas she had been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss\r\nBertram.\r\n\r\nEdmund watched the progress of her attention, and was amused and\r\ngratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework,\r\nwhich at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally: how it fell from\r\nher hand while she sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes\r\nwhich had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were\r\nturned and fixed on Crawford\xe2\x80\x94fixed on him for minutes, fixed on him, in\r\nshort, till the attraction drew Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s upon her, and the book was\r\nclosed, and the charm was broken. Then she was shrinking again into\r\nherself, and blushing and working as hard as ever; but it had been\r\nenough to give Edmund encouragement for his friend, and as he cordially\r\nthanked him, he hoped to be expressing Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s secret feelings too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat play must be a favourite with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cyou read as if you\r\nknew it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be a favourite, I believe, from this hour,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Crawford;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand\r\nbefore since I was fifteen. I once saw Henry the Eighth acted, or I\r\nhave heard of it from somebody who did, I am not certain which. But\r\nShakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how. It is a part\r\nof an Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s constitution. His thoughts and beauties are so\r\nspread abroad that one touches them everywhere; one is intimate with\r\nhim by instinct. No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of\r\nhis plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfrom one\xe2\x80\x99s earliest years. His celebrated passages are quoted by\r\neverybody; they are in half the books we open, and we all talk\r\nShakespeare, use his similes, and describe with his descriptions; but\r\nthis is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it. To know\r\nhim in bits and scraps is common enough; to know him pretty thoroughly\r\nis, perhaps, not uncommon; but to read him well aloud is no everyday\r\ntalent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, you do me honour,\xe2\x80\x9d was Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s answer, with a bow of mock\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nBoth gentlemen had a glance at Fanny, to see if a word of accordant\r\npraise could be extorted from her; yet both feeling that it could not\r\nbe. Her praise had been given in her attention; _that_ must content\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nLady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s admiration was expressed, and strongly too. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nreally like being at a play,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish Sir Thomas had been\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrawford was excessively pleased. If Lady Bertram, with all her\r\nincompetency and languor, could feel this, the inference of what her\r\nniece, alive and enlightened as she was, must feel, was elevating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a great turn for acting, I am sure, Mr. Crawford,\xe2\x80\x9d said her\r\nladyship soon afterwards; \xe2\x80\x9cand I will tell you what, I think you will\r\nhave a theatre, some time or other, at your house in Norfolk. I mean\r\nwhen you are settled there. I do indeed. I think you will fit up a\r\ntheatre at your house in Norfolk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, with quickness. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, that will never be.\r\nYour ladyship is quite mistaken. No theatre at Everingham! Oh no!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhe looked at Fanny with an expressive smile, which evidently meant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund saw it all, and saw Fanny so determined _not_ to see it, as to\r\nmake it clear that the voice was enough to convey the full meaning of\r\nthe protestation; and such a quick consciousness of compliment, such a\r\nready comprehension of a hint, he thought, was rather favourable than\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe subject of reading aloud was farther discussed. The two young men\r\nwere the only talkers, but they, standing by the fire, talked over the\r\ntoo common neglect of the qualification, the total inattention to it,\r\nin the ordinary school-system for boys, the consequently natural, yet\r\nin some instances almost unnatural, degree of ignorance and uncouthness\r\nof men, of sensible and well-informed men, when suddenly called to the\r\nnecessity of reading aloud, which had fallen within their notice,\r\ngiving instances of blunders, and failures with their secondary causes,\r\nthe want of management of the voice, of proper modulation and emphasis,\r\nof foresight and judgment, all proceeding from the first cause: want of\r\nearly attention and habit; and Fanny was listening again with great\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven in my profession,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edmund, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9chow little the art\r\nof reading has been studied! how little a clear manner, and good\r\ndelivery, have been attended to! I speak rather of the past, however,\r\nthan the present. There is now a spirit of improvement abroad; but\r\namong those who were ordained twenty, thirty, forty years ago, the\r\nlarger number, to judge by their performance, must have thought reading\r\nwas reading, and preaching was preaching. It is different now. The\r\nsubject is more justly considered. It is felt that distinctness and\r\nenergy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths; and\r\nbesides, there is more general observation and taste, a more critical\r\nknowledge diffused than formerly; in every congregation there is a\r\nlarger proportion who know a little of the matter, and who can judge\r\nand criticise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination;\r\nand upon this being understood, he had a variety of questions from\r\nCrawford as to his feelings and success; questions, which being made,\r\nthough with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste, without\r\nany touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew\r\nto be most offensive to Fanny, he had true pleasure in satisfying; and\r\nwhen Crawford proceeded to ask his opinion and give his own as to the\r\nproperest manner in which particular passages in the service should be\r\ndelivered, shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before,\r\nand thought with judgment, Edmund was still more and more pleased. This\r\nwould be the way to Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s heart. She was not to be won by all that\r\ngallantry and wit and good-nature together could do; or, at least, she\r\nwould not be won by them nearly so soon, without the assistance of\r\nsentiment and feeling, and seriousness on serious subjects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur liturgy,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Crawford, \xe2\x80\x9chas beauties, which not even a\r\ncareless, slovenly style of reading can destroy; but it has also\r\nredundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt.\r\nFor myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I\r\nought to be\xe2\x80\x9d (here was a glance at Fanny); \xe2\x80\x9cthat nineteen times out of\r\ntwenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to\r\nhave it to read myself. Did you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d stepping eagerly to Fanny, and\r\naddressing her in a softened voice; and upon her saying \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you did not speak? I saw your lips move. I fancied you\r\nmight be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive, and not _allow_\r\nmy thoughts to wander. Are not you going to tell me so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, you know your duty too well for me to\xe2\x80\x94even supposing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopt, felt herself getting into a puzzle, and could not be\r\nprevailed on to add another word, not by dint of several minutes of\r\nsupplication and waiting. He then returned to his former station, and\r\nwent on as if there had been no such tender interruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sermon, well delivered, is more uncommon even than prayers well\r\nread. A sermon, good in itself, is no rare thing. It is more difficult\r\nto speak well than to compose well; that is, the rules and trick of\r\ncomposition are oftener an object of study. A thoroughly good sermon,\r\nthoroughly well delivered, is a capital gratification. I can never hear\r\nsuch a one without the greatest admiration and respect, and more than\r\nhalf a mind to take orders and preach myself. There is something in the\r\neloquence of the pulpit, when it is really eloquence, which is entitled\r\nto the highest praise and honour. The preacher who can touch and affect\r\nsuch an heterogeneous mass of hearers, on subjects limited, and long\r\nworn threadbare in all common hands; who can say anything new or\r\nstriking, anything that rouses the attention without offending the\r\ntaste, or wearing out the feelings of his hearers, is a man whom one\r\ncould not, in his public capacity, honour enough. I should like to be\r\nsuch a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEdmund laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should indeed. I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my\r\nlife without a sort of envy. But then, I must have a London audience. I\r\ncould not preach but to the educated; to those who were capable of\r\nestimating my composition. And I do not know that I should be fond of\r\npreaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring,\r\nafter being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but\r\nnot for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook her head, and\r\nCrawford was instantly by her side again, entreating to know her\r\nmeaning; and as Edmund perceived, by his drawing in a chair, and\r\nsitting down close by her, that it was to be a very thorough attack,\r\nthat looks and undertones were to be well tried, he sank as quietly as\r\npossible into a corner, turned his back, and took up a newspaper, very\r\nsincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into\r\nexplaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her\r\nardent lover; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the\r\nbusiness from himself in murmurs of his own, over the various\r\nadvertisements of \xe2\x80\x9cA most desirable Estate in South Wales\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cTo Parents\r\nand Guardians\xe2\x80\x9d; and a \xe2\x80\x9cCapital season\xe2\x80\x99d Hunter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been as motionless\r\nas she was speechless, and grieved to the heart to see Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrangements, was trying by everything in the power of her modest,\r\ngentle nature, to repulse Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his looks and\r\ninquiries; and he, unrepulsable, was persisting in both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did that shake of the head mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it meant to\r\nexpress? Disapprobation, I fear. But of what? What had I been saying to\r\ndisplease you? Did you think me speaking improperly, lightly,\r\nirreverently on the subject? Only tell me if I was. Only tell me if I\r\nwas wrong. I want to be set right. Nay, nay, I entreat you; for one\r\nmoment put down your work. What did that shake of the head mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn vain was her \xe2\x80\x9cPray, sir, don\xe2\x80\x99t; pray, Mr. Crawford,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated twice\r\nover; and in vain did she try to move away. In the same low, eager\r\nvoice, and the same close neighbourhood, he went on, reurging the same\r\nquestions as before. She grew more agitated and displeased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you, sir? You quite astonish me; I wonder how you can\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I astonish you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you wonder? Is there anything in my\r\npresent entreaty that you do not understand? I will explain to you\r\ninstantly all that makes me urge you in this manner, all that gives me\r\nan interest in what you look and do, and excites my present curiosity.\r\nI will not leave you to wonder long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself, she could not help half a smile, but she said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to\r\nengage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy. Yes, that\r\nwas the word. Constancy: I am not afraid of the word. I would spell it,\r\nread it, write it with anybody. I see nothing alarming in the word. Did\r\nyou think I ought?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, wearied at last into speaking\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cperhaps,\r\nsir, I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well\r\nas you seemed to do at that moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrawford, delighted to get her to speak at any rate, was determined to\r\nkeep it up; and poor Fanny, who had hoped to silence him by such an\r\nextremity of reproof, found herself sadly mistaken, and that it was\r\nonly a change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to\r\nanother. He had always something to entreat the explanation of. The\r\nopportunity was too fair. None such had occurred since his seeing her\r\nin her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s room, none such might occur again before his leaving\r\nMansfield. Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s being just on the other side of the table was\r\na trifle, for she might always be considered as only half-awake, and\r\nEdmund\xe2\x80\x99s advertisements were still of the first utility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crawford, after a course of rapid questions and reluctant\r\nanswers; \xe2\x80\x9cI am happier than I was, because I now understand more\r\nclearly your opinion of me. You think me unsteady: easily swayed by the\r\nwhim of the moment, easily tempted, easily put aside. With such an\r\nopinion, no wonder that\xe2\x80\x94But we shall see.\xe2\x80\x94It is not by protestations\r\nthat I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged; it is not by\r\ntelling you that my affections are steady. My conduct shall speak for\r\nme; absence, distance, time shall speak for me. _They_ shall prove\r\nthat, as far as you can be deserved by anybody, I do deserve you. You\r\nare infinitely my superior in merit; all _that_ I know. You have\r\nqualities which I had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in\r\nany human creature. You have some touches of the angel in you beyond\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x94not merely beyond what one sees, because one never sees anything\r\nlike it\xe2\x80\x94but beyond what one fancies might be. But still I am not\r\nfrightened. It is not by equality of merit that you can be won. That is\r\nout of the question. It is he who sees and worships your merit the\r\nstrongest, who loves you most devotedly, that has the best right to a\r\nreturn. There I build my confidence. By that right I do and will\r\ndeserve you; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I\r\ndeclare it, I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes.\r\nYes, dearest, sweetest Fanny. Nay\xe2\x80\x9d (seeing her draw back displeased),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cforgive me. Perhaps I have as yet no right; but by what other name can\r\nI call you? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under\r\nany other? No, it is \xe2\x80\x98Fanny\xe2\x80\x99 that I think of all day, and dream of all\r\nnight. You have given the name such reality of sweetness, that nothing\r\nelse can now be descriptive of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny could hardly have kept her seat any longer, or have refrained\r\nfrom at least trying to get away in spite of all the too public\r\nopposition she foresaw to it, had it not been for the sound of\r\napproaching relief, the very sound which she had been long watching\r\nfor, and long thinking strangely delayed.\r\n\r\nThe solemn procession, headed by Baddeley, of tea-board, urn, and\r\ncake-bearers, made its appearance, and delivered her from a grievous\r\nimprisonment of body and mind. Mr. Crawford was obliged to move. She\r\nwas at liberty, she was busy, she was protected.\r\n\r\nEdmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the number of those who\r\nmight speak and hear. But though the conference had seemed full long to\r\nhim, and though on looking at Fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation,\r\nhe inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened\r\nto without some profit to the speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse\r\nwhether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned\r\nbetween them or not; and that if she did not lead the way, it should\r\nnever be touched on by him; but after a day or two of mutual reserve,\r\nhe was induced by his father to change his mind, and try what his\r\ninfluence might do for his friend.\r\n\r\nA day, and a very early day, was actually fixed for the Crawfords\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndeparture; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more\r\neffort for the young man before he left Mansfield, that all his\r\nprofessions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to\r\nsustain them as possible.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr.\r\nCrawford\xe2\x80\x99s character in that point. He wished him to be a model of\r\nconstancy; and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not\r\ntrying him too long.\r\n\r\nEdmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business; he\r\nwanted to know Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. She had been used to consult him in\r\nevery difficulty, and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her\r\nconfidence now; he hoped to be of service to her, he thought he must be\r\nof service to her; whom else had she to open her heart to? If she did\r\nnot need counsel, she must need the comfort of communication. Fanny\r\nestranged from him, silent and reserved, was an unnatural state of\r\nthings; a state which he must break through, and which he could easily\r\nlearn to think she was wanting him to break through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will speak to her, sir: I will take the first opportunity of\r\nspeaking to her alone,\xe2\x80\x9d was the result of such thoughts as these; and\r\nupon Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s information of her being at that very time walking\r\nalone in the shrubbery, he instantly joined her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am come to walk with you, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I?\xe2\x80\x9d Drawing her\r\narm within his. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a long while since we have had a comfortable\r\nwalk together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe assented to it all rather by look than word. Her spirits were low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d he presently added, \xe2\x80\x9cin order to have a comfortable walk,\r\nsomething more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together.\r\nYou must talk to me. I know you have something on your mind. I know\r\nwhat you are thinking of. You cannot suppose me uninformed. Am I to\r\nhear of it from everybody but Fanny herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny, at once agitated and dejected, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you hear of it from\r\neverybody, cousin, there can be nothing for me to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot of facts, perhaps; but of feelings, Fanny. No one but you can tell\r\nme them. I do not mean to press you, however. If it is not what you\r\nwish yourself, I have done. I had thought it might be a relief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in\r\ntalking of what I feel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose that we think differently? I have no idea of it. I dare\r\nsay that, on a comparison of our opinions, they would be found as much\r\nalike as they have been used to be: to the point\xe2\x80\x94I consider Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproposals as most advantageous and desirable, if you could return his\r\naffection. I consider it as most natural that all your family should\r\nwish you could return it; but that, as you cannot, you have done\r\nexactly as you ought in refusing him. Can there be any disagreement\r\nbetween us here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! But I thought you blamed me. I thought you were against me.\r\nThis is such a comfort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis comfort you might have had sooner, Fanny, had you sought it. But\r\nhow could you possibly suppose me against you? How could you imagine me\r\nan advocate for marriage without love? Were I even careless in general\r\non such matters, how could you imagine me so where your happiness was\r\nat stake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he had been talking to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly right. I may be\r\nsorry, I may be surprised\xe2\x80\x94though hardly _that_, for you had not had\r\ntime to attach yourself\xe2\x80\x94but I think you perfectly right. Can it admit\r\nof a question? It is disgraceful to us if it does. You did not love\r\nhim; nothing could have justified your accepting him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite mistaken\r\nwho wished you to do otherwise. But the matter does not end here.\r\nCrawford\xe2\x80\x99s is no common attachment; he perseveres, with the hope of\r\ncreating that regard which had not been created before. This, we know,\r\nmust be a work of time. But\xe2\x80\x9d (with an affectionate smile) \xe2\x80\x9clet him\r\nsucceed at last, Fanny, let him succeed at last. You have proved\r\nyourself upright and disinterested, prove yourself grateful and\r\ntender-hearted; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which\r\nI have always believed you born for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! never, never, never! he never will succeed with me.\xe2\x80\x9d And she spoke\r\nwith a warmth which quite astonished Edmund, and which she blushed at\r\nthe recollection of herself, when she saw his look, and heard him\r\nreply, \xe2\x80\x9cNever! Fanny!\xe2\x80\x94so very determined and positive! This is not like\r\nyourself, your rational self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, sorrowfully correcting herself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I _think_ I\r\nnever shall, as far as the future can be answered for; I think I never\r\nshall return his regard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must hope better things. I am aware, more aware than Crawford can\r\nbe, that the man who means to make you love him (you having due notice\r\nof his intentions) must have very uphill work, for there are all your\r\nearly attachments and habits in battle array; and before he can get\r\nyour heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds\r\nupon things animate and inanimate, which so many years\xe2\x80\x99 growth have\r\nconfirmed, and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the\r\nvery idea of separation. I know that the apprehension of being forced\r\nto quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him. I wish he\r\nhad not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for. I wish he had\r\nknown you as well as I do, Fanny. Between us, I think we should have\r\nwon you. My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not\r\nhave failed. He should have worked upon my plans. I must hope, however,\r\nthat time, proving him (as I firmly believe it will) to deserve you by\r\nhis steady affection, will give him his reward. I cannot suppose that\r\nyou have not the _wish_ to love him\xe2\x80\x94the natural wish of gratitude. You\r\nmust have some feeling of that sort. You must be sorry for your own\r\nindifference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are so totally unlike,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, avoiding a direct answer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nare so very, very different in all our inclinations and ways, that I\r\nconsider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy\r\ntogether, even if I _could_ like him. There never were two people more\r\ndissimilar. We have not one taste in common. We should be miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken, Fanny. The dissimilarity is not so strong. You are\r\nquite enough alike. You _have_ tastes in common. You have moral and\r\nliterary tastes in common. You have both warm hearts and benevolent\r\nfeelings; and, Fanny, who that heard him read, and saw you listen to\r\nShakespeare the other night, will think you unfitted as companions? You\r\nforget yourself: there is a decided difference in your tempers, I\r\nallow. He is lively, you are serious; but so much the better: his\r\nspirits will support yours. It is your disposition to be easily\r\ndejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are. His\r\ncheerfulness will counteract this. He sees difficulties nowhere: and\r\nhis pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you. Your\r\nbeing so far unlike, Fanny, does not in the smallest degree make\r\nagainst the probability of your happiness together: do not imagine it.\r\nI am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance. I am\r\nperfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike: I mean\r\nunlike in the flow of the spirits, in the manners, in the inclination\r\nfor much or little company, in the propensity to talk or to be silent,\r\nto be grave or to be gay. Some opposition here is, I am thoroughly\r\nconvinced, friendly to matrimonial happiness. I exclude extremes, of\r\ncourse; and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the\r\nlikeliest way to produce an extreme. A counteraction, gentle and\r\ncontinual, is the best safeguard of manners and conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFull well could Fanny guess where his thoughts were now: Miss\r\nCrawford\xe2\x80\x99s power was all returning. He had been speaking of her\r\ncheerfully from the hour of his coming home. His avoiding her was quite\r\nat an end. He had dined at the Parsonage only the preceding day.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes, Fanny,\r\nfeeling it due to herself, returned to Mr. Crawford, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nnot merely in _temper_ that I consider him as totally unsuited to\r\nmyself; though, in _that_ respect, I think the difference between us\r\ntoo great, infinitely too great: his spirits often oppress me; but\r\nthere is something in him which I object to still more. I must say,\r\ncousin, that I cannot approve his character. I have not thought well of\r\nhim from the time of the play. I then saw him behaving, as it appeared\r\nto me, so very improperly and unfeelingly\xe2\x80\x94I may speak of it now because\r\nit is all over\xe2\x80\x94so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth, not seeming to care\r\nhow he exposed or hurt him, and paying attentions to my cousin Maria,\r\nwhich\xe2\x80\x94in short, at the time of the play, I received an impression which\r\nwill never be got over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Edmund, scarcely hearing her to the end, \xe2\x80\x9clet\r\nus not, any of us, be judged by what we appeared at that period of\r\ngeneral folly. The time of the play is a time which I hate to\r\nrecollect. Maria was wrong, Crawford was wrong, we were all wrong\r\ntogether; but none so wrong as myself. Compared with me, all the rest\r\nwere blameless. I was playing the fool with my eyes open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a bystander,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps I saw more than you did; and I\r\ndo think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery possibly. No wonder. Nothing could be more improper than the\r\nwhole business. I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be\r\ncapable of it; but, if she could undertake the part, we must not be\r\nsurprised at the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the play, I am much mistaken if _Julia_ did not think he was\r\npaying her attentions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJulia! I have heard before from some one of his being in love with\r\nJulia; but I could never see anything of it. And, Fanny, though I hope\r\nI do justice to my sisters\xe2\x80\x99 good qualities, I think it very possible\r\nthat they might, one or both, be more desirous of being admired by\r\nCrawford, and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was\r\nperfectly prudent. I can remember that they were evidently fond of his\r\nsociety; and with such encouragement, a man like Crawford, lively, and\r\nit may be, a little unthinking, might be led on to\xe2\x80\x94there could be\r\nnothing very striking, because it is clear that he had no pretensions:\r\nhis heart was reserved for you. And I must say, that its being for you\r\nhas raised him inconceivably in my opinion. It does him the highest\r\nhonour; it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic\r\nhappiness and pure attachment. It proves him unspoilt by his uncle. It\r\nproves him, in short, everything that I had been used to wish to\r\nbelieve him, and feared he was not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am persuaded that he does not think, as he ought, on serious\r\nsubjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, rather, that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects,\r\nwhich I believe to be a good deal the case. How could it be otherwise,\r\nwith such an education and adviser? Under the disadvantages, indeed,\r\nwhich both have had, is it not wonderful that they should be what they\r\nare? Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s _feelings_, I am ready to acknowledge, have hitherto\r\nbeen too much his guides. Happily, those feelings have generally been\r\ngood. You will supply the rest; and a most fortunate man he is to\r\nattach himself to such a creature\xe2\x80\x94to a woman who, firm as a rock in her\r\nown principles, has a gentleness of character so well adapted to\r\nrecommend them. He has chosen his partner, indeed, with rare felicity.\r\nHe will make you happy, Fanny; I know he will make you happy; but you\r\nwill make him everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not engage in such a charge,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Fanny, in a shrinking\r\naccent; \xe2\x80\x9cin such an office of high responsibility!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs usual, believing yourself unequal to anything! fancying everything\r\ntoo much for you! Well, though I may not be able to persuade you into\r\ndifferent feelings, you will be persuaded into them, I trust. I confess\r\nmyself sincerely anxious that you may. I have no common interest in\r\nCrawford\xe2\x80\x99s well-doing. Next to your happiness, Fanny, his has the first\r\nclaim on me. You are aware of my having no common interest in\r\nCrawford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say; and they walked\r\non together some fifty yards in mutual silence and abstraction. Edmund\r\nfirst began again\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday,\r\nparticularly pleased, because I had not depended upon her seeing\r\neverything in so just a light. I knew she was very fond of you; but yet\r\nI was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as\r\nit deserved, and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some\r\nwoman of distinction or fortune. I was afraid of the bias of those\r\nworldly maxims, which she has been too much used to hear. But it was\r\nvery different. She spoke of you, Fanny, just as she ought. She desires\r\nthe connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself. We had a long talk\r\nabout it. I should not have mentioned the subject, though very anxious\r\nto know her sentiments; but I had not been in the room five minutes\r\nbefore she began introducing it with all that openness of heart, and\r\nsweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness which are so\r\nmuch a part of herself. Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Mrs. Grant in the room, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by\r\nthemselves; and when once we had begun, we had not done with you,\r\nFanny, till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she laments it; yet owns it may have been best. You will see her,\r\nhowever, before she goes. She is very angry with you, Fanny; you must\r\nbe prepared for that. She calls herself very angry, but you can imagine\r\nher anger. It is the regret and disappointment of a sister, who thinks\r\nher brother has a right to everything he may wish for, at the first\r\nmoment. She is hurt, as you would be for William; but she loves and\r\nesteems you with all her heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew she would be very angry with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Edmund, pressing her arm closer to him, \xe2\x80\x9cdo\r\nnot let the idea of her anger distress you. It is anger to be talked of\r\nrather than felt. Her heart is made for love and kindness, not for\r\nresentment. I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise; I\r\nwish you could have seen her countenance, when she said that you\r\n_should_ be Henry\xe2\x80\x99s wife. And I observed that she always spoke of you\r\nas \xe2\x80\x98Fanny,\xe2\x80\x99 which she was never used to do; and it had a sound of most\r\nsisterly cordiality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mrs. Grant, did she say\xe2\x80\x94did she speak; was she there all the\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she was agreeing exactly with her sister. The surprise of your\r\nrefusal, Fanny, seems to have been unbounded. That you could refuse\r\nsuch a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand. I\r\nsaid what I could for you; but in good truth, as they stated the\r\ncase\xe2\x80\x94you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by\r\na different conduct; nothing else will satisfy them. But this is\r\nteasing you. I have done. Do not turn away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _should_ have thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, after a pause of recollection\r\nand exertion, \xe2\x80\x9cthat every woman must have felt the possibility of a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s not being approved, not being loved by some one of her sex at\r\nleast, let him be ever so generally agreeable. Let him have all the\r\nperfections in the world, I think it ought not to be set down as\r\ncertain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to\r\nlike himself. But, even supposing it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to\r\nhave all the claims which his sisters think he has, how was I to be\r\nprepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own? He took me\r\nwholly by surprise. I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before\r\nhad any meaning; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him\r\nonly because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me. In my\r\nsituation, it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming\r\nexpectations on Mr. Crawford. I am sure his sisters, rating him as they\r\ndo, must have thought it so, supposing he had meant nothing. How, then,\r\nwas I to be\xe2\x80\x94to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me?\r\nHow was I to have an attachment at his service, as soon as it was asked\r\nfor? His sisters should consider me as well as him. The higher his\r\ndeserts, the more improper for me ever to have thought of him. And,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94we think very differently of the nature of women, if they can\r\nimagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this\r\nseems to imply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth. I know this to be the\r\ntruth; and most worthy of you are such feelings. I had attributed them\r\nto you before. I thought I could understand you. You have now given\r\nexactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend\r\nand Mrs. Grant, and they were both better satisfied, though your\r\nwarm-hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm\r\nof her fondness for Henry. I told them that you were of all human\r\ncreatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least; and\r\nthat the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s addresses was\r\nagainst him. Their being so new and so recent was all in their\r\ndisfavour; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to;\r\nand a great deal more to the same purpose, to give them a knowledge of\r\nyour character. Miss Crawford made us laugh by her plans of\r\nencouragement for her brother. She meant to urge him to persevere in\r\nthe hope of being loved in time, and of having his addresses most\r\nkindly received at the end of about ten years\xe2\x80\x99 happy marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for. Her\r\nfeelings were all in revolt. She feared she had been doing wrong:\r\nsaying too much, overacting the caution which she had been fancying\r\nnecessary; in guarding against one evil, laying herself open to\r\nanother; and to have Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s liveliness repeated to her at such\r\na moment, and on such a subject, was a bitter aggravation.\r\n\r\nEdmund saw weariness and distress in her face, and immediately resolved\r\nto forbear all farther discussion; and not even to mention the name of\r\nCrawford again, except as it might be connected with what _must_ be\r\nagreeable to her. On this principle, he soon afterwards observed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\ngo on Monday. You are sure, therefore, of seeing your friend either\r\nto-morrow or Sunday. They really go on Monday; and I was within a\r\ntrifle of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day! I\r\nhad almost promised it. What a difference it might have made! Those\r\nfive or six days more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were near staying there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery. I was most kindly pressed, and had nearly consented. Had I\r\nreceived any letter from Mansfield, to tell me how you were all going\r\non, I believe I should certainly have staid; but I knew nothing that\r\nhad happened here for a fortnight, and felt that I had been away long\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spent your time pleasantly there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that is, it was the fault of my own mind if I did not. They were\r\nall very pleasant. I doubt their finding me so. I took uneasiness with\r\nme, and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Miss Owens\xe2\x80\x94you liked them, did not you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very well. Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected girls. But I am\r\nspoilt, Fanny, for common female society. Good-humoured, unaffected\r\ngirls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. They\r\nare two distinct orders of being. You and Miss Crawford have made me\r\ntoo nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill, however, Fanny was oppressed and wearied; he saw it in her\r\nlooks, it could not be talked away; and attempting it no more, he led\r\nher directly, with the kind authority of a privileged guardian, into\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all that Fanny\r\ncould tell, or could leave to be conjectured of her sentiments, and he\r\nwas satisfied. It had been, as he before presumed, too hasty a measure\r\non Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s side, and time must be given to make the idea first\r\nfamiliar, and then agreeable to her. She must be used to the\r\nconsideration of his being in love with her, and then a return of\r\naffection might not be very distant.\r\n\r\nHe gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to his father;\r\nand recommended there being nothing more said to her: no farther\r\nattempts to influence or persuade; but that everything should be left\r\nto Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s assiduities, and the natural workings of her own mind.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas promised that it should be so. Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s account of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisposition he could believe to be just; he supposed she had all those\r\nfeelings, but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she _had_;\r\nfor, less willing than his son to trust to the future, he could not\r\nhelp fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were\r\nnecessary for her, she might not have persuaded herself into receiving\r\nhis addresses properly before the young man\xe2\x80\x99s inclination for paying\r\nthem were over. There was nothing to be done, however, but to submit\r\nquietly and hope the best.\r\n\r\nThe promised visit from \xe2\x80\x9cher friend,\xe2\x80\x9d as Edmund called Miss Crawford,\r\nwas a formidable threat to Fanny, and she lived in continual terror of\r\nit. As a sister, so partial and so angry, and so little scrupulous of\r\nwhat she said, and in another light so triumphant and secure, she was\r\nin every way an object of painful alarm. Her displeasure, her\r\npenetration, and her happiness were all fearful to encounter; and the\r\ndependence of having others present when they met was Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nsupport in looking forward to it. She absented herself as little as\r\npossible from Lady Bertram, kept away from the East room, and took no\r\nsolitary walk in the shrubbery, in her caution to avoid any sudden\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nShe succeeded. She was safe in the breakfast-room, with her aunt, when\r\nMiss Crawford did come; and the first misery over, and Miss Crawford\r\nlooking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than\r\nshe had anticipated, Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse\r\nto be endured than a half-hour of moderate agitation. But here she\r\nhoped too much; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity. She was\r\ndetermined to see Fanny alone, and therefore said to her tolerably\r\nsoon, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI must speak to you for a few minutes\r\nsomewhere\xe2\x80\x9d; words that Fanny felt all over her, in all her pulses and\r\nall her nerves. Denial was impossible. Her habits of ready submission,\r\non the contrary, made her almost instantly rise and lead the way out of\r\nthe room. She did it with wretched feelings, but it was inevitable.\r\n\r\nThey were no sooner in the hall than all restraint of countenance was\r\nover on Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s side. She immediately shook her head at Fanny\r\nwith arch, yet affectionate reproach, and taking her hand, seemed\r\nhardly able to help beginning directly. She said nothing, however, but,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSad, sad girl! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nhad discretion enough to reserve the rest till they might be secure of\r\nhaving four walls to themselves. Fanny naturally turned upstairs, and\r\ntook her guest to the apartment which was now always fit for\r\ncomfortable use; opening the door, however, with a most aching heart,\r\nand feeling that she had a more distressing scene before her than ever\r\nthat spot had yet witnessed. But the evil ready to burst on her was at\r\nleast delayed by the sudden change in Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s ideas; by the\r\nstrong effect on her mind which the finding herself in the East room\r\nagain produced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with instant animation, \xe2\x80\x9cam I here again? The East\r\nroom! Once only was I in this room before\xe2\x80\x9d; and after stopping to look\r\nabout her, and seemingly to retrace all that had then passed, she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cOnce only before. Do you remember it? I came to rehearse. Your\r\ncousin came too; and we had a rehearsal. You were our audience and\r\nprompter. A delightful rehearsal. I shall never forget it. Here we\r\nwere, just in this part of the room: here was your cousin, here was I,\r\nhere were the chairs. Oh! why will such things ever pass away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHappily for her companion, she wanted no answer. Her mind was entirely\r\nself-engrossed. She was in a reverie of sweet remembrances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable! The subject of it\r\nso very\xe2\x80\x94very\xe2\x80\x94what shall I say? He was to be describing and recommending\r\nmatrimony to me. I think I see him now, trying to be as demure and\r\ncomposed as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches. \xe2\x80\x98When two\r\nsympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimony may be called\r\na happy life.\xe2\x80\x99 I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I\r\nhave of his looks and voice as he said those words. It was curious,\r\nvery curious, that we should have such a scene to play! If I had the\r\npower of recalling any one week of my existence, it should be that\r\nweek\xe2\x80\x94that acting week. Say what you would, Fanny, it should be _that_;\r\nfor I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other. His sturdy\r\nspirit to bend as it did! Oh! it was sweet beyond expression. But alas,\r\nthat very evening destroyed it all. That very evening brought your most\r\nunwelcome uncle. Poor Sir Thomas, who was glad to see you? Yet, Fanny,\r\ndo not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas, though\r\nI certainly did hate him for many a week. No, I do him justice now. He\r\nis just what the head of such a family should be. Nay, in sober\r\nsadness, I believe I now love you all.\xe2\x80\x9d And having said so, with a\r\ndegree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in\r\nher before, and now thought only too becoming, she turned away for a\r\nmoment to recover herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had a little fit since I came into\r\nthis room, as you may perceive,\xe2\x80\x9d said she presently, with a playful\r\nsmile, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for\r\nas to scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do, I have\r\nnot the heart for it when it comes to the point.\xe2\x80\x9d And embracing her\r\nvery affectionately, \xe2\x80\x9cGood, gentle Fanny! when I think of this being\r\nthe last time of seeing you for I do not know how long, I feel it quite\r\nimpossible to do anything but love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was affected. She had not foreseen anything of this, and her\r\nfeelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clast.\xe2\x80\x9d She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than she\r\npossibly could; and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight of\r\nsuch emotion, hung about her with fondness, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hate to leave\r\nyou. I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going. Who says we\r\nshall not be sisters? I know we shall. I feel that we are born to be\r\nconnected; and those tears convince me that you feel it too, dear\r\nFanny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny roused herself, and replying only in part, said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are\r\nonly going from one set of friends to another. You are going to a very\r\nparticular friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very true. Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years. But\r\nI have not the least inclination to go near her. I can think only of\r\nthe friends I am leaving: my excellent sister, yourself, and the\r\nBertrams in general. You have all so much more _heart_ among you than\r\none finds in the world at large. You all give me a feeling of being\r\nable to trust and confide in you, which in common intercourse one knows\r\nnothing of. I wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till\r\nafter Easter, a much better time for the visit, but now I cannot put\r\nher off. And when I have done with her I must go to her sister, Lady\r\nStornaway, because _she_ was rather my most particular friend of the\r\ntwo, but I have not cared much for _her_ these three years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent, each\r\nthoughtful: Fanny meditating on the different sorts of friendship in\r\nthe world, Mary on something of less philosophic tendency. _She_ first\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs, and\r\nsetting off to find my way to the East room, without having an idea\r\nwhereabouts it was! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I\r\ncame along, and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table\r\nat work; and then your cousin\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, when he opened the door,\r\nat seeing me here! To be sure, your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s returning that very\r\nevening! There never was anything quite like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother short fit of abstraction followed, when, shaking it off, she\r\nthus attacked her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie. Thinking, I hope, of one\r\nwho is always thinking of you. Oh! that I could transport you for a\r\nshort time into our circle in town, that you might understand how your\r\npower over Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and\r\nheartburnings of dozens and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that\r\nwill be felt at hearing what you have done! For as to secrecy, Henry is\r\nquite the hero of an old romance, and glories in his chains. You should\r\ncome to London to know how to estimate your conquest. If you were to\r\nsee how he is courted, and how I am courted for his sake! Now, I am\r\nwell aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in\r\nconsequence of his situation with you. When she comes to know the truth\r\nshe will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is\r\na daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is wild to get\r\nmarried, and wants Henry to take. Oh! she has been trying for him to\r\nsuch a degree. Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an\r\nidea of the _sensation_ that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity\r\nthere will be to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to\r\nanswer! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and\r\nyour teeth, and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish\r\nMargaret were married, for my poor friend\xe2\x80\x99s sake, for I look upon the\r\nFrasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it\r\nwas a most desirable match for Janet at the time. We were all\r\ndelighted. She could not do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich,\r\nand she had nothing; but he turns out ill-tempered and _exigeant_, and\r\nwants a young woman, a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be\r\nas steady as himself. And my friend does not manage him well; she does\r\nnot seem to know how to make the best of it. There is a spirit of\r\nirritation which, to say nothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In\r\ntheir house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield\r\nParsonage with respect. Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence\r\nin my sister, and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes\r\none feel there _is_ attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with\r\nthe Frasers. I shall be at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as\r\na wife, Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband, are my standards of\r\nperfection. Poor Janet has been sadly taken in, and yet there was\r\nnothing improper on her side: she did not run into the match\r\ninconsiderately; there was no want of foresight. She took three days to\r\nconsider of his proposals, and during those three days asked the advice\r\nof everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having, and\r\nespecially applied to my late dear aunt, whose knowledge of the world\r\nmade her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the\r\nyoung people of her acquaintance, and she was decidedly in favour of\r\nMr. Fraser. This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial\r\ncomfort. I have not so much to say for my friend Flora, who jilted a\r\nvery nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord\r\nStornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth, but\r\nmuch worse-looking, and with a blackguard character. I _had_ my doubts\r\nat the time about her being right, for he has not even the air of a\r\ngentleman, and now I am sure she was wrong. By the bye, Flora Ross was\r\ndying for Henry the first winter she came out. But were I to attempt to\r\ntell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him, I\r\nshould never have done. It is you, only you, insensible Fanny, who can\r\nthink of him with anything like indifference. But are you so insensible\r\nas you profess yourself? No, no, I see you are not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, so deep a blush over Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s face at that moment as\r\nmight warrant strong suspicion in a predisposed mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent creature! I will not tease you. Everything shall take its\r\ncourse. But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you were not so absolutely\r\nunprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies. It is not\r\npossible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject, some\r\nsurmises as to what might be. You must have seen that he was trying to\r\nplease you by every attention in his power. Was not he devoted to you\r\nat the ball? And then before the ball, the necklace! Oh! you received\r\nit just as it was meant. You were as conscious as heart could desire. I\r\nremember it perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean, then, that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand?\r\nOh! Miss Crawford, _that_ was not fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnew of it! It was his own doing entirely, his own thought. I am\r\nashamed to say that it had never entered my head, but I was delighted\r\nto act on his proposal for both your sakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fanny, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I was not half afraid at the\r\ntime of its being so, for there was something in your look that\r\nfrightened me, but not at first; I was as unsuspicious of it at\r\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94indeed, indeed I was. It is as true as that I sit here. And had I\r\nhad an idea of it, nothing should have induced me to accept the\r\nnecklace. As to your brother\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour, certainly I was sensible of a\r\nparticularity: I had been sensible of it some little time, perhaps two\r\nor three weeks; but then I considered it as meaning nothing: I put it\r\ndown as simply being his way, and was as far from supposing as from\r\nwishing him to have any serious thoughts of me. I had not, Miss\r\nCrawford, been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him\r\nand some part of this family in the summer and autumn. I was quiet, but\r\nI was not blind. I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself\r\nin gallantries which did mean nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I cannot deny it. He has now and then been a sad flirt, and cared\r\nvery little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\naffections. I have often scolded him for it, but it is his only fault;\r\nand there is this to be said, that very few young ladies have any\r\naffections worth caring for. And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one\r\nwho has been shot at by so many; of having it in one\xe2\x80\x99s power to pay off\r\nthe debts of one\xe2\x80\x99s sex! Oh! I am sure it is not in woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature to\r\nrefuse such a triumph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think well of a man who sports with any\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s feelings; and there may often be a great deal more suffered\r\nthan a stander-by can judge of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not defend him. I leave him entirely to your mercy, and when he\r\nhas got you at Everingham, I do not care how much you lecture him. But\r\nthis I will say, that his fault, the liking to make girls a little in\r\nlove with him, is not half so dangerous to a wife\xe2\x80\x99s happiness as a\r\ntendency to fall in love himself, which he has never been addicted to.\r\nAnd I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a\r\nway that he never was to any woman before; that he loves you with all\r\nhis heart, and will love you as nearly for ever as possible. If any man\r\never loved a woman for ever, I think Henry will do as much for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny could not avoid a faint smile, but had nothing to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot imagine Henry ever to have been happier,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mary\r\npresently, \xe2\x80\x9cthan when he had succeeded in getting your brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had made a sure push at Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s feelings here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes. How very, very kind of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he must have exerted himself very much, for I know the parties\r\nhe had to move. The Admiral hates trouble, and scorns asking favours;\r\nand there are so many young men\xe2\x80\x99s claims to be attended to in the same\r\nway, that a friendship and energy, not very determined, is easily put\r\nby. What a happy creature William must be! I wish we could see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its\r\nvarieties. The recollection of what had been done for William was\r\nalways the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr.\r\nCrawford; and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary, who had been\r\nfirst watching her complacently, and then musing on something else,\r\nsuddenly called her attention by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to sit talking\r\nwith you here all day, but we must not forget the ladies below, and so\r\ngood-bye, my dear, my amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we shall\r\nnominally part in the breakfast-parlour, I must take leave of you here.\r\nAnd I do take leave, longing for a happy reunion, and trusting that\r\nwhen we meet again, it will be under circumstances which may open our\r\nhearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA very, very kind embrace, and some agitation of manner, accompanied\r\nthese words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall see your cousin in town soon: he talks of being there\r\ntolerably soon; and Sir Thomas, I dare say, in the course of the\r\nspring; and your eldest cousin, and the Rushworths, and Julia, I am\r\nsure of meeting again and again, and all but you. I have two favours to\r\nask, Fanny: one is your correspondence. You must write to me. And the\r\nother, that you will often call on Mrs. Grant, and make her amends for\r\nmy being gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first, at least, of these favours Fanny would rather not have been\r\nasked; but it was impossible for her to refuse the correspondence; it\r\nwas impossible for her even not to accede to it more readily than her\r\nown judgment authorised. There was no resisting so much apparent\r\naffection. Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond\r\ntreatment, and from having hitherto known so little of it, she was the\r\nmore overcome by Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s. Besides, there was gratitude towards\r\nher, for having made their _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ so much less painful than her\r\nfears had predicted.\r\n\r\nIt was over, and she had escaped without reproaches and without\r\ndetection. Her secret was still her own; and while that was the case,\r\nshe thought she could resign herself to almost everything.\r\n\r\nIn the evening there was another parting. Henry Crawford came and sat\r\nsome time with them; and her spirits not being previously in the\r\nstrongest state, her heart was softened for a while towards him,\r\nbecause he really seemed to feel. Quite unlike his usual self, he\r\nscarcely said anything. He was evidently oppressed, and Fanny must\r\ngrieve for him, though hoping she might never see him again till he\r\nwere the husband of some other woman.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the moment of parting, he would take her hand, he would\r\nnot be denied it; he said nothing, however, or nothing that she heard,\r\nand when he had left the room, she was better pleased that such a token\r\nof friendship had passed.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the Crawfords were gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford gone, Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s next object was that he should be\r\nmissed; and he entertained great hope that his niece would find a blank\r\nin the loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt, or\r\nfancied, an evil. She had tasted of consequence in its most flattering\r\nform; and he did hope that the loss of it, the sinking again into\r\nnothing, would awaken very wholesome regrets in her mind. He watched\r\nher with this idea; but he could hardly tell with what success. He\r\nhardly knew whether there were any difference in her spirits or not.\r\nShe was always so gentle and retiring that her emotions were beyond his\r\ndiscrimination. He did not understand her: he felt that he did not; and\r\ntherefore applied to Edmund to tell him how she stood affected on the\r\npresent occasion, and whether she were more or less happy than she had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nEdmund did not discern any symptoms of regret, and thought his father a\r\nlittle unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days could\r\nproduce any.\r\n\r\nWhat chiefly surprised Edmund was, that Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s sister, the friend\r\nand companion who had been so much to her, should not be more visibly\r\nregretted. He wondered that Fanny spoke so seldom of _her_, and had so\r\nlittle voluntarily to say of her concern at this separation.\r\n\r\nAlas! it was this sister, this friend and companion, who was now the\r\nchief bane of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s comfort. If she could have believed Mary\xe2\x80\x99s future\r\nfate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshould be, if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant\r\nas she was much inclined to think his, she would have been light of\r\nheart indeed; but the more she recollected and observed, the more\r\ndeeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for\r\nMiss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before. On his\r\nside the inclination was stronger, on hers less equivocal. His\r\nobjections, the scruples of his integrity, seemed all done away, nobody\r\ncould tell how; and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were\r\nequally got over\xe2\x80\x94and equally without apparent reason. It could only be\r\nimputed to increasing attachment. His good and her bad feelings yielded\r\nto love, and such love must unite them. He was to go to town as soon as\r\nsome business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed\xe2\x80\x94perhaps within\r\na fortnight; he talked of going, he loved to talk of it; and when once\r\nwith her again, Fanny could not doubt the rest. Her acceptance must be\r\nas certain as his offer; and yet there were bad feelings still\r\nremaining which made the prospect of it most sorrowful to her,\r\nindependently, she believed, independently of self.\r\n\r\nIn their very last conversation, Miss Crawford, in spite of some\r\namiable sensations, and much personal kindness, had still been Miss\r\nCrawford; still shewn a mind led astray and bewildered, and without any\r\nsuspicion of being so; darkened, yet fancying itself light. She might\r\nlove, but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment. Fanny\r\nbelieved there was scarcely a second feeling in common between them;\r\nand she may be forgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of\r\nMiss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s future improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking\r\nthat if Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s influence in this season of love had already done so\r\nlittle in clearing her judgment, and regulating her notions, his worth\r\nwould be finally wasted on her even in years of matrimony.\r\n\r\nExperience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced,\r\nand impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s nature that\r\nparticipation of the general nature of women which would lead her to\r\nadopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own. But\r\nas such were Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s persuasions, she suffered very much from them, and\r\ncould never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas, meanwhile, went on with his own hopes and his own\r\nobservations, still feeling a right, by all his knowledge of human\r\nnature, to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and\r\nconsequence on his niece\xe2\x80\x99s spirits, and the past attentions of the\r\nlover producing a craving for their return; and he was soon afterwards\r\nable to account for his not yet completely and indubitably seeing all\r\nthis, by the prospect of another visitor, whose approach he could allow\r\nto be quite enough to support the spirits he was watching. William had\r\nobtained a ten days\xe2\x80\x99 leave of absence, to be given to Northamptonshire,\r\nand was coming, the happiest of lieutenants, because the latest made,\r\nto shew his happiness and describe his uniform.\r\n\r\nHe came; and he would have been delighted to shew his uniform there\r\ntoo, had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance except on duty. So\r\nthe uniform remained at Portsmouth, and Edmund conjectured that before\r\nFanny had any chance of seeing it, all its own freshness and all the\r\nfreshness of its wearer\xe2\x80\x99s feelings must be worn away. It would be sunk\r\ninto a badge of disgrace; for what can be more unbecoming, or more\r\nworthless, than the uniform of a lieutenant, who has been a lieutenant\r\na year or two, and sees others made commanders before him? So reasoned\r\nEdmund, till his father made him the confidant of a scheme which placed\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s chance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all\r\nhis glory in another light.\r\n\r\nThis scheme was that she should accompany her brother back to\r\nPortsmouth, and spend a little time with her own family. It had\r\noccurred to Sir Thomas, in one of his dignified musings, as a right and\r\ndesirable measure; but before he absolutely made up his mind, he\r\nconsulted his son. Edmund considered it every way, and saw nothing but\r\nwhat was right. The thing was good in itself, and could not be done at\r\na better time; and he had no doubt of it being highly agreeable to\r\nFanny. This was enough to determine Sir Thomas; and a decisive \xe2\x80\x9cthen so\r\nit shall be\xe2\x80\x9d closed that stage of the business; Sir Thomas retiring\r\nfrom it with some feelings of satisfaction, and views of good over and\r\nabove what he had communicated to his son; for his prime motive in\r\nsending her away had very little to do with the propriety of her seeing\r\nher parents again, and nothing at all with any idea of making her\r\nhappy. He certainly wished her to go willingly, but he as certainly\r\nwished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended; and that\r\na little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park\r\nwould bring her mind into a sober state, and incline her to a juster\r\nestimate of the value of that home of greater permanence, and equal\r\ncomfort, of which she had the offer.\r\n\r\nIt was a medicinal project upon his niece\xe2\x80\x99s understanding, which he\r\nmust consider as at present diseased. A residence of eight or nine\r\nyears in the abode of wealth and plenty had a little disordered her\r\npowers of comparing and judging. Her father\xe2\x80\x99s house would, in all\r\nprobability, teach her the value of a good income; and he trusted that\r\nshe would be the wiser and happier woman, all her life, for the\r\nexperiment he had devised.\r\n\r\nHad Fanny been at all addicted to raptures, she must have had a strong\r\nattack of them when she first understood what was intended, when her\r\nuncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents, and brothers,\r\nand sisters, from whom she had been divided almost half her life; of\r\nreturning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy, with\r\nWilliam for the protector and companion of her journey, and the\r\ncertainty of continuing to see William to the last hour of his\r\nremaining on land. Had she ever given way to bursts of delight, it must\r\nhave been then, for she was delighted, but her happiness was of a\r\nquiet, deep, heart-swelling sort; and though never a great talker, she\r\nwas always more inclined to silence when feeling most strongly. At the\r\nmoment she could only thank and accept. Afterwards, when familiarised\r\nwith the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she could speak more\r\nlargely to William and Edmund of what she felt; but still there were\r\nemotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words. The\r\nremembrance of all her earliest pleasures, and of what she had suffered\r\nin being torn from them, came over her with renewed strength, and it\r\nseemed as if to be at home again would heal every pain that had since\r\ngrown out of the separation. To be in the centre of such a circle,\r\nloved by so many, and more loved by all than she had ever been before;\r\nto feel affection without fear or restraint; to feel herself the equal\r\nof those who surrounded her; to be at peace from all mention of the\r\nCrawfords, safe from every look which could be fancied a reproach on\r\ntheir account. This was a prospect to be dwelt on with a fondness that\r\ncould be but half acknowledged.\r\n\r\nEdmund, too\xe2\x80\x94to be two months from _him_ (and perhaps she might be\r\nallowed to make her absence three) must do her good. At a distance,\r\nunassailed by his looks or his kindness, and safe from the perpetual\r\nirritation of knowing his heart, and striving to avoid his confidence,\r\nshe should be able to reason herself into a properer state; she should\r\nbe able to think of him as in London, and arranging everything there,\r\nwithout wretchedness. What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield\r\nwas to become a slight evil at Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback was the doubt of her aunt Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s being comfortable\r\nwithout her. She was of use to no one else; but _there_ she might be\r\nmissed to a degree that she did not like to think of; and that part of\r\nthe arrangement was, indeed, the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish,\r\nand what only _he_ could have accomplished at all.\r\n\r\nBut he was master at Mansfield Park. When he had really resolved on any\r\nmeasure, he could always carry it through; and now by dint of long\r\ntalking on the subject, explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsometimes seeing her family, he did induce his wife to let her go;\r\nobtaining it rather from submission, however, than conviction, for Lady\r\nBertram was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought\r\nFanny ought to go, and therefore that she must. In the calmness of her\r\nown dressing-room, in the impartial flow of her own meditations,\r\nunbiased by his bewildering statements, she could not acknowledge any\r\nnecessity for Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s ever going near a father and mother who had done\r\nwithout her so long, while she was so useful to herself. And as to the\r\nnot missing her, which under Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s discussion was the point\r\nattempted to be proved, she set herself very steadily against admitting\r\nany such thing.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas had appealed to her reason, conscience, and dignity. He\r\ncalled it a sacrifice, and demanded it of her goodness and self-command\r\nas such. But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her that Fanny could be\r\nvery well spared\xe2\x80\x94_she_ being ready to give up all her own time to her\r\nas requested\xe2\x80\x94and, in short, could not really be wanted or missed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be, sister,\xe2\x80\x9d was all Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s reply. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you\r\nare very right; but I am sure I shall miss her very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next step was to communicate with Portsmouth. Fanny wrote to offer\r\nherself; and her mother\xe2\x80\x99s answer, though short, was so kind\xe2\x80\x94a few\r\nsimple lines expressed so natural and motherly a joy in the prospect of\r\nseeing her child again, as to confirm all the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s views of\r\nhappiness in being with her\xe2\x80\x94convincing her that she should now find a\r\nwarm and affectionate friend in the \xe2\x80\x9cmama\xe2\x80\x9d who had certainly shewn no\r\nremarkable fondness for her formerly; but this she could easily suppose\r\nto have been her own fault or her own fancy. She had probably alienated\r\nlove by the helplessness and fretfulness of a fearful temper, or been\r\nunreasonable in wanting a larger share than any one among so many could\r\ndeserve. Now, when she knew better how to be useful, and how to\r\nforbear, and when her mother could be no longer occupied by the\r\nincessant demands of a house full of little children, there would be\r\nleisure and inclination for every comfort, and they should soon be what\r\nmother and daughter ought to be to each other.\r\n\r\nWilliam was almost as happy in the plan as his sister. It would be the\r\ngreatest pleasure to him to have her there to the last moment before he\r\nsailed, and perhaps find her there still when he came in from his first\r\ncruise. And besides, he wanted her so very much to see the Thrush\r\nbefore she went out of harbour\xe2\x80\x94the Thrush was certainly the finest\r\nsloop in the service\xe2\x80\x94and there were several improvements in the\r\ndockyard, too, which he quite longed to shew her.\r\n\r\nHe did not scruple to add that her being at home for a while would be a\r\ngreat advantage to everybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know how it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we seem to want some of your\r\nnice ways and orderliness at my father\xe2\x80\x99s. The house is always in\r\nconfusion. You will set things going in a better way, I am sure. You\r\nwill tell my mother how it all ought to be, and you will be so useful\r\nto Susan, and you will teach Betsey, and make the boys love and mind\r\nyou. How right and comfortable it will all be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy the time Mrs. Price\xe2\x80\x99s answer arrived, there remained but a very few\r\ndays more to be spent at Mansfield; and for part of one of those days\r\nthe young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of\r\ntheir journey, for when the mode of it came to be talked of, and Mrs.\r\nNorris found that all her anxiety to save her brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s money\r\nwas vain, and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less\r\nexpensive conveyance of Fanny, they were to travel post; when she saw\r\nSir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose, she was struck\r\nwith the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage, and\r\nsuddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them, to go and\r\nsee her poor dear sister Price. She proclaimed her thoughts. She must\r\nsay that she had more than half a mind to go with the young people; it\r\nwould be such an indulgence to her; she had not seen her poor dear\r\nsister Price for more than twenty years; and it would be a help to the\r\nyoung people in their journey to have her older head to manage for\r\nthem; and she could not help thinking her poor dear sister Price would\r\nfeel it very unkind of her not to come by such an opportunity.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Fanny were horror-struck at the idea.\r\n\r\nAll the comfort of their comfortable journey would be destroyed at\r\nonce. With woeful countenances they looked at each other. Their\r\nsuspense lasted an hour or two. No one interfered to encourage or\r\ndissuade. Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself; and it\r\nended, to the infinite joy of her nephew and niece, in the recollection\r\nthat she could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present;\r\nthat she was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram\r\nfor her to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a\r\nweek, and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to\r\nthat of being useful to them.\r\n\r\nIt had, in fact, occurred to her, that though taken to Portsmouth for\r\nnothing, it would be hardly possible for her to avoid paying her own\r\nexpenses back again. So her poor dear sister Price was left to all the\r\ndisappointment of her missing such an opportunity, and another twenty\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 absence, perhaps, begun.\r\n\r\nEdmund\xe2\x80\x99s plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey, this absence\r\nof Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s. He too had a sacrifice to make to Mansfield Park as well as\r\nhis aunt. He had intended, about this time, to be going to London; but\r\nhe could not leave his father and mother just when everybody else of\r\nmost importance to their comfort was leaving them; and with an effort,\r\nfelt but not boasted of, he delayed for a week or two longer a journey\r\nwhich he was looking forward to with the hope of its fixing his\r\nhappiness for ever.\r\n\r\nHe told Fanny of it. She knew so much already, that she must know\r\neverything. It made the substance of one other confidential discourse\r\nabout Miss Crawford; and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to\r\nbe the last time in which Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s name would ever be mentioned\r\nbetween them with any remains of liberty. Once afterwards she was\r\nalluded to by him. Lady Bertram had been telling her niece in the\r\nevening to write to her soon and often, and promising to be a good\r\ncorrespondent herself; and Edmund, at a convenient moment, then added\r\nin a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd _I_ shall write to you, Fanny, when I have anything\r\nworth writing about, anything to say that I think you will like to\r\nhear, and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d Had\r\nshe doubted his meaning while she listened, the glow in his face, when\r\nshe looked up at him, would have been decisive.\r\n\r\nFor this letter she must try to arm herself. That a letter from Edmund\r\nshould be a subject of terror! She began to feel that she had not yet\r\ngone through all the changes of opinion and sentiment which the\r\nprogress of time and variation of circumstances occasion in this world\r\nof changes. The vicissitudes of the human mind had not yet been\r\nexhausted by her.\r\n\r\nPoor Fanny! though going as she did willingly and eagerly, the last\r\nevening at Mansfield Park must still be wretchedness. Her heart was\r\ncompletely sad at parting. She had tears for every room in the house,\r\nmuch more for every beloved inhabitant. She clung to her aunt, because\r\nshe would miss her; she kissed the hand of her uncle with struggling\r\nsobs, because she had displeased him; and as for Edmund, she could\r\nneither speak, nor look, nor think, when the last moment came with\r\n_him_; and it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her\r\nthe affectionate farewell of a brother.\r\n\r\nAll this passed overnight, for the journey was to begin very early in\r\nthe morning; and when the small, diminished party met at breakfast,\r\nWilliam and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe novelty of travelling, and the happiness of being with William,\r\nsoon produced their natural effect on Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s spirits, when Mansfield\r\nPark was fairly left behind; and by the time their first stage was\r\nended, and they were to quit Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s carriage, she was able to\r\ntake leave of the old coachman, and send back proper messages, with\r\ncheerful looks.\r\n\r\nOf pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end.\r\nEverything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William\xe2\x80\x99s mind,\r\nand he was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their\r\nhigher-toned subjects, all of which ended, if they did not begin, in\r\npraise of the Thrush, conjectures how she would be employed, schemes\r\nfor an action with some superior force, which (supposing the first\r\nlieutenant out of the way, and William was not very merciful to the\r\nfirst lieutenant) was to give himself the next step as soon as\r\npossible, or speculations upon prize-money, which was to be generously\r\ndistributed at home, with only the reservation of enough to make the\r\nlittle cottage comfortable, in which he and Fanny were to pass all\r\ntheir middle and later life together.\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s immediate concerns, as far as they involved Mr. Crawford, made\r\nno part of their conversation. William knew what had passed, and from\r\nhis heart lamented that his sister\xe2\x80\x99s feelings should be so cold towards\r\na man whom he must consider as the first of human characters; but he\r\nwas of an age to be all for love, and therefore unable to blame; and\r\nknowing her wish on the subject, he would not distress her by the\r\nslightest allusion.\r\n\r\nShe had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by Mr. Crawford.\r\nShe had heard repeatedly from his sister within the three weeks which\r\nhad passed since their leaving Mansfield, and in each letter there had\r\nbeen a few lines from himself, warm and determined like his speeches.\r\nIt was a correspondence which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she\r\nhad feared. Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s style of writing, lively and affectionate,\r\nwas itself an evil, independent of what she was thus forced into\r\nreading from the brother\xe2\x80\x99s pen, for Edmund would never rest till she\r\nhad read the chief of the letter to him; and then she had to listen to\r\nhis admiration of her language, and the warmth of her attachments.\r\nThere had, in fact, been so much of message, of allusion, of\r\nrecollection, so much of Mansfield in every letter, that Fanny could\r\nnot but suppose it meant for him to hear; and to find herself forced\r\ninto a purpose of that kind, compelled into a correspondence which was\r\nbringing her the addresses of the man she did not love, and obliging\r\nher to administer to the adverse passion of the man she did, was\r\ncruelly mortifying. Here, too, her present removal promised advantage.\r\nWhen no longer under the same roof with Edmund, she trusted that Miss\r\nCrawford would have no motive for writing strong enough to overcome the\r\ntrouble, and that at Portsmouth their correspondence would dwindle into\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nWith such thoughts as these, among ten hundred others, Fanny proceeded\r\nin her journey safely and cheerfully, and as expeditiously as could\r\nrationally be hoped in the dirty month of February. They entered\r\nOxford, but she could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s college as\r\nthey passed along, and made no stop anywhere till they reached Newbury,\r\nwhere a comfortable meal, uniting dinner and supper, wound up the\r\nenjoyments and fatigues of the day.\r\n\r\nThe next morning saw them off again at an early hour; and with no\r\nevents, and no delays, they regularly advanced, and were in the\r\nenvirons of Portsmouth while there was yet daylight for Fanny to look\r\naround her, and wonder at the new buildings. They passed the\r\ndrawbridge, and entered the town; and the light was only beginning to\r\nfail as, guided by William\xe2\x80\x99s powerful voice, they were rattled into a\r\nnarrow street, leading from the High Street, and drawn up before the\r\ndoor of a small house now inhabited by Mr. Price.\r\n\r\nFanny was all agitation and flutter; all hope and apprehension. The\r\nmoment they stopped, a trollopy-looking maidservant, seemingly in\r\nwaiting for them at the door, stepped forward, and more intent on\r\ntelling the news than giving them any help, immediately began with,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Thrush is gone out of harbour, please sir, and one of the officers\r\nhas been here to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven\r\nyears old, who, rushing out of the house, pushed the maid aside, and\r\nwhile William was opening the chaise-door himself, called out, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\njust in time. We have been looking for you this half-hour. The Thrush\r\nwent out of harbour this morning. I saw her. It was a beautiful sight.\r\nAnd they think she will have her orders in a day or two. And Mr.\r\nCampbell was here at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock to ask for you: he has got one of the\r\nThrush\xe2\x80\x99s boats, and is going off to her at six, and hoped you would be\r\nhere in time to go with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her out of the carriage, was\r\nall the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed; but he made no\r\nobjection to her kissing him, though still entirely engaged in\r\ndetailing farther particulars of the Thrush\xe2\x80\x99s going out of harbour, in\r\nwhich he had a strong right of interest, being to commence his career\r\nof seamanship in her at this very time.\r\n\r\nAnother moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance-passage of the\r\nhouse, and in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms, who met her there with looks of true\r\nkindness, and with features which Fanny loved the more, because they\r\nbrought her aunt Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s before her, and there were her two sisters:\r\nSusan, a well-grown fine girl of fourteen, and Betsey, the youngest of\r\nthe family, about five\xe2\x80\x94both glad to see her in their way, though with\r\nno advantage of manner in receiving her. But manner Fanny did not want.\r\nWould they but love her, she should be satisfied.\r\n\r\nShe was then taken into a parlour, so small that her first conviction\r\nwas of its being only a passage-room to something better, and she stood\r\nfor a moment expecting to be invited on; but when she saw there was no\r\nother door, and that there were signs of habitation before her, she\r\ncalled back her thoughts, reproved herself, and grieved lest they\r\nshould have been suspected. Her mother, however, could not stay long\r\nenough to suspect anything. She was gone again to the street-door, to\r\nwelcome William. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! my dear William, how glad I am to see you. But\r\nhave you heard about the Thrush? She is gone out of harbour already;\r\nthree days before we had any thought of it; and I do not know what I am\r\nto do about Sam\xe2\x80\x99s things, they will never be ready in time; for she may\r\nhave her orders to-morrow, perhaps. It takes me quite unawares. And now\r\nyou must be off for Spithead too. Campbell has been here, quite in a\r\nworry about you; and now what shall we do? I thought to have had such a\r\ncomfortable evening with you, and here everything comes upon me at\r\nonce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer son answered cheerfully, telling her that everything was always for\r\nthe best; and making light of his own inconvenience in being obliged to\r\nhurry away so soon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, I had much rather she had stayed in harbour, that I might\r\nhave sat a few hours with you in comfort; but as there is a boat\r\nashore, I had better go off at once, and there is no help for it.\r\nWhereabouts does the Thrush lay at Spithead? Near the Canopus? But no\r\nmatter; here\xe2\x80\x99s Fanny in the parlour, and why should we stay in the\r\npassage? Come, mother, you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny\r\nyet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn they both came, and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed her daughter\r\nagain, and commented a little on her growth, began with very natural\r\nsolicitude to feel for their fatigues and wants as travellers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor dears! how tired you must both be! and now, what will you have? I\r\nbegan to think you would never come. Betsey and I have been watching\r\nfor you this half-hour. And when did you get anything to eat? And what\r\nwould you like to have now? I could not tell whether you would be for\r\nsome meat, or only a dish of tea, after your journey, or else I would\r\nhave got something ready. And now I am afraid Campbell will be here\r\nbefore there is time to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand.\r\nIt is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street. We were\r\nbetter off in our last house. Perhaps you would like some tea as soon\r\nas it can be got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both declared they should prefer it to anything. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, Betsey, my\r\ndear, run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on; and\r\ntell her to bring in the tea-things as soon as she can. I wish we could\r\nget the bell mended; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetsey went with alacrity, proud to shew her abilities before her fine\r\nnew sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the anxious mother, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a sad fire we have got,\r\nand I dare say you are both starved with cold. Draw your chair nearer,\r\nmy dear. I cannot think what Rebecca has been about. I am sure I told\r\nher to bring some coals half an hour ago. Susan, you should have taken\r\ncare of the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was upstairs, mama, moving my things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, in a fearless,\r\nself-defending tone, which startled Fanny. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you had but just\r\nsettled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room; and I\r\ncould not get Rebecca to give me any help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarther discussion was prevented by various bustles: first, the driver\r\ncame to be paid; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca\r\nabout the manner of carrying up his sister\xe2\x80\x99s trunk, which he would\r\nmanage all his own way; and lastly, in walked Mr. Price himself, his\r\nown loud voice preceding him, as with something of the oath kind he\r\nkicked away his son\xe2\x80\x99s portmanteau and his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s bandbox in the\r\npassage, and called out for a candle; no candle was brought, however,\r\nand he walked into the room.\r\n\r\nFanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him, but sank down again\r\non finding herself undistinguished in the dusk, and unthought of. With\r\na friendly shake of his son\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and an eager voice, he instantly\r\nbegan\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHa! welcome back, my boy. Glad to see you. Have you heard the\r\nnews? The Thrush went out of harbour this morning. Sharp is the word,\r\nyou see! By G\xe2\x80\x94, you are just in time! The doctor has been here\r\ninquiring for you: he has got one of the boats, and is to be off for\r\nSpithead by six, so you had better go with him. I have been to Turner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabout your mess; it is all in a way to be done. I should not wonder if\r\nyou had your orders to-morrow: but you cannot sail with this wind, if\r\nyou are to cruise to the westward; and Captain Walsh thinks you will\r\ncertainly have a cruise to the westward, with the Elephant. By G\xe2\x80\x94, I\r\nwish you may! But old Scholey was saying, just now, that he thought you\r\nwould be sent first to the Texel. Well, well, we are ready, whatever\r\nhappens. But by G\xe2\x80\x94, you lost a fine sight by not being here in the\r\nmorning to see the Thrush go out of harbour! I would not have been out\r\nof the way for a thousand pounds. Old Scholey ran in at breakfast-time,\r\nto say she had slipped her moorings and was coming out, I jumped up,\r\nand made but two steps to the platform. If ever there was a perfect\r\nbeauty afloat, she is one; and there she lays at Spithead, and anybody\r\nin England would take her for an eight-and-twenty. I was upon the\r\nplatform two hours this afternoon looking at her. She lays close to the\r\nEndymion, between her and the Cleopatra, just to the eastward of the\r\nsheer hulk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d cried William, \xe2\x80\x9c_that\xe2\x80\x99s_ just where I should have put her myself.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the best berth at Spithead. But here is my sister, sir; here is\r\nFanny,\xe2\x80\x9d turning and leading her forward; \xe2\x80\x9cit is so dark you do not see\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her, Mr. Price now\r\nreceived his daughter; and having given her a cordial hug, and observed\r\nthat she was grown into a woman, and he supposed would be wanting a\r\nhusband soon, seemed very much inclined to forget her again. Fanny\r\nshrunk back to her seat, with feelings sadly pained by his language and\r\nhis smell of spirits; and he talked on only to his son, and only of the\r\nThrush, though William, warmly interested as he was in that subject,\r\nmore than once tried to make his father think of Fanny, and her long\r\nabsence and long journey.\r\n\r\nAfter sitting some time longer, a candle was obtained; but as there was\r\nstill no appearance of tea, nor, from Betsey\xe2\x80\x99s reports from the\r\nkitchen, much hope of any under a considerable period, William\r\ndetermined to go and change his dress, and make the necessary\r\npreparations for his removal on board directly, that he might have his\r\ntea in comfort afterwards.\r\n\r\nAs he left the room, two rosy-faced boys, ragged and dirty, about eight\r\nand nine years old, rushed into it just released from school, and\r\ncoming eagerly to see their sister, and tell that the Thrush was gone\r\nout of harbour; Tom and Charles. Charles had been born since Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing away, but Tom she had often helped to nurse, and now felt a\r\nparticular pleasure in seeing again. Both were kissed very tenderly,\r\nbut Tom she wanted to keep by her, to try to trace the features of the\r\nbaby she had loved, and talked to, of his infant preference of herself.\r\nTom, however, had no mind for such treatment: he came home not to stand\r\nand be talked to, but to run about and make a noise; and both boys had\r\nsoon burst from her, and slammed the parlour-door till her temples\r\nached.\r\n\r\nShe had now seen all that were at home; there remained only two\r\nbrothers between herself and Susan, one of whom was a clerk in a public\r\noffice in London, and the other midshipman on board an Indiaman. But\r\nthough she had _seen_ all the members of the family, she had not yet\r\n_heard_ all the noise they could make. Another quarter of an hour\r\nbrought her a great deal more. William was soon calling out from the\r\nlanding-place of the second story for his mother and for Rebecca. He\r\nwas in distress for something that he had left there, and did not find\r\nagain. A key was mislaid, Betsey accused of having got at his new hat,\r\nand some slight, but essential alteration of his uniform waistcoat,\r\nwhich he had been promised to have done for him, entirely neglected.\r\n\r\nMrs. Price, Rebecca, and Betsey all went up to defend themselves, all\r\ntalking together, but Rebecca loudest, and the job was to be done as\r\nwell as it could in a great hurry; William trying in vain to send\r\nBetsey down again, or keep her from being troublesome where she was;\r\nthe whole of which, as almost every door in the house was open, could\r\nbe plainly distinguished in the parlour, except when drowned at\r\nintervals by the superior noise of Sam, Tom, and Charles chasing each\r\nother up and down stairs, and tumbling about and hallooing.\r\n\r\nFanny was almost stunned. The smallness of the house and thinness of\r\nthe walls brought everything so close to her, that, added to the\r\nfatigue of her journey, and all her recent agitation, she hardly knew\r\nhow to bear it. _Within_ the room all was tranquil enough, for Susan\r\nhaving disappeared with the others, there were soon only her father and\r\nherself remaining; and he, taking out a newspaper, the accustomary loan\r\nof a neighbour, applied himself to studying it, without seeming to\r\nrecollect her existence. The solitary candle was held between himself\r\nand the paper, without any reference to her possible convenience; but\r\nshe had nothing to do, and was glad to have the light screened from her\r\naching head, as she sat in bewildered, broken, sorrowful contemplation.\r\n\r\nShe was at home. But, alas! it was not such a home, she had not such a\r\nwelcome, as\xe2\x80\x94she checked herself; she was unreasonable. What right had\r\nshe to be of importance to her family? She could have none, so long\r\nlost sight of! William\xe2\x80\x99s concerns must be dearest, they always had\r\nbeen, and he had every right. Yet to have so little said or asked about\r\nherself, to have scarcely an inquiry made after Mansfield! It did pain\r\nher to have Mansfield forgotten; the friends who had done so much\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndear, dear friends! But here, one subject swallowed up all the rest.\r\nPerhaps it must be so. The destination of the Thrush must be now\r\npreeminently interesting. A day or two might shew the difference. _She_\r\nonly was to blame. Yet she thought it would not have been so at\r\nMansfield. No, in her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house there would have been a\r\nconsideration of times and seasons, a regulation of subject, a\r\npropriety, an attention towards everybody which there was not here.\r\n\r\nThe only interruption which thoughts like these received for nearly\r\nhalf an hour was from a sudden burst of her father\xe2\x80\x99s, not at all\r\ncalculated to compose them. At a more than ordinary pitch of thumping\r\nand hallooing in the passage, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cDevil take those young\r\ndogs! How they are singing out! Ay, Sam\xe2\x80\x99s voice louder than all the\r\nrest! That boy is fit for a boatswain. Holla, you there! Sam, stop your\r\nconfounded pipe, or I shall be after you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis threat was so palpably disregarded, that though within five\r\nminutes afterwards the three boys all burst into the room together and\r\nsat down, Fanny could not consider it as a proof of anything more than\r\ntheir being for the time thoroughly fagged, which their hot faces and\r\npanting breaths seemed to prove, especially as they were still kicking\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s shins, and hallooing out at sudden starts immediately\r\nunder their father\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\n\r\nThe next opening of the door brought something more welcome: it was for\r\nthe tea-things, which she had begun almost to despair of seeing that\r\nevening. Susan and an attendant girl, whose inferior appearance\r\ninformed Fanny, to her great surprise, that she had previously seen the\r\nupper servant, brought in everything necessary for the meal; Susan\r\nlooking, as she put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her sister,\r\nas if divided between the agreeable triumph of shewing her activity and\r\nusefulness, and the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an\r\noffice. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had been into the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto hurry Sally and\r\nhelp make the toast, and spread the bread and butter, or she did not\r\nknow when they should have got tea, and she was sure her sister must\r\nwant something after her journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was very thankful. She could not but own that she should be very\r\nglad of a little tea, and Susan immediately set about making it, as if\r\npleased to have the employment all to herself; and with only a little\r\nunnecessary bustle, and some few injudicious attempts at keeping her\r\nbrothers in better order than she could, acquitted herself very well.\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s spirit was as much refreshed as her body; her head and heart\r\nwere soon the better for such well-timed kindness. Susan had an open,\r\nsensible countenance; she was like William, and Fanny hoped to find her\r\nlike him in disposition and goodwill towards herself.\r\n\r\nIn this more placid state of things William reentered, followed not far\r\nbehind by his mother and Betsey. He, complete in his lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuniform, looking and moving all the taller, firmer, and more graceful\r\nfor it, and with the happiest smile over his face, walked up directly\r\nto Fanny, who, rising from her seat, looked at him for a moment in\r\nspeechless admiration, and then threw her arms round his neck to sob\r\nout her various emotions of pain and pleasure.\r\n\r\nAnxious not to appear unhappy, she soon recovered herself; and wiping\r\naway her tears, was able to notice and admire all the striking parts of\r\nhis dress; listening with reviving spirits to his cheerful hopes of\r\nbeing on shore some part of every day before they sailed, and even of\r\ngetting her to Spithead to see the sloop.\r\n\r\nThe next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell, the surgeon of the Thrush, a\r\nvery well-behaved young man, who came to call for his friend, and for\r\nwhom there was with some contrivance found a chair, and with some hasty\r\nwashing of the young tea-maker\xe2\x80\x99s, a cup and saucer; and after another\r\nquarter of an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen, noise rising\r\nupon noise, and bustle upon bustle, men and boys at last all in motion\r\ntogether, the moment came for setting off; everything was ready,\r\nWilliam took leave, and all of them were gone; for the three boys, in\r\nspite of their mother\xe2\x80\x99s entreaty, determined to see their brother and\r\nMr. Campbell to the sally-port; and Mr. Price walked off at the same\r\ntime to carry back his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper.\r\n\r\nSomething like tranquillity might now be hoped for; and accordingly,\r\nwhen Rebecca had been prevailed on to carry away the tea-things, and\r\nMrs. Price had walked about the room some time looking for a\r\nshirt-sleeve, which Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in the\r\nkitchen, the small party of females were pretty well composed, and the\r\nmother having lamented again over the impossibility of getting Sam\r\nready in time, was at leisure to think of her eldest daughter and the\r\nfriends she had come from.\r\n\r\nA few inquiries began: but one of the earliest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHow did sister Bertram\r\nmanage about her servants?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWas she as much plagued as herself to get\r\ntolerable servants?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94soon led her mind away from Northamptonshire, and\r\nfixed it on her own domestic grievances, and the shocking character of\r\nall the Portsmouth servants, of whom she believed her own two were the\r\nvery worst, engrossed her completely. The Bertrams were all forgotten\r\nin detailing the faults of Rebecca, against whom Susan had also much to\r\ndepose, and little Betsey a great deal more, and who did seem so\r\nthoroughly without a single recommendation, that Fanny could not help\r\nmodestly presuming that her mother meant to part with her when her year\r\nwas up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer year!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Price; \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I hope I shall be rid of her\r\nbefore she has staid a year, for that will not be up till November.\r\nServants are come to such a pass, my dear, in Portsmouth, that it is\r\nquite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year. I have no hope\r\nof ever being settled; and if I was to part with Rebecca, I should only\r\nget something worse. And yet I do not think I am a very difficult\r\nmistress to please; and I am sure the place is easy enough, for there\r\nis always a girl under her, and I often do half the work myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was silent; but not from being convinced that there might not be\r\na remedy found for some of these evils. As she now sat looking at\r\nBetsey, she could not but think particularly of another sister, a very\r\npretty little girl, whom she had left there not much younger when she\r\nwent into Northamptonshire, who had died a few years afterwards. There\r\nhad been something remarkably amiable about her. Fanny in those early\r\ndays had preferred her to Susan; and when the news of her death had at\r\nlast reached Mansfield, had for a short time been quite afflicted. The\r\nsight of Betsey brought the image of little Mary back again, but she\r\nwould not have pained her mother by alluding to her for the world.\r\nWhile considering her with these ideas, Betsey, at a small distance,\r\nwas holding out something to catch her eyes, meaning to screen it at\r\nthe same time from Susan\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got there, my love?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny; \xe2\x80\x9ccome and shew it to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a silver knife. Up jumped Susan, claiming it as her own, and\r\ntrying to get it away; but the child ran to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s protection,\r\nand Susan could only reproach, which she did very warmly, and evidently\r\nhoping to interest Fanny on her side. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very hard that she was\r\nnot to have her _own_ knife; it was her own knife; little sister Mary\r\nhad left it to her upon her deathbed, and she ought to have had it to\r\nkeep herself long ago. But mama kept it from her, and was always\r\nletting Betsey get hold of it; and the end of it would be that Betsey\r\nwould spoil it, and get it for her own, though mama had _promised_ her\r\nthat Betsey should not have it in her own hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was quite shocked. Every feeling of duty, honour, and tenderness\r\nwas wounded by her sister\xe2\x80\x99s speech and her mother\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Susan,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Price, in a complaining voice, \xe2\x80\x9cnow, how can\r\nyou be so cross? You are always quarrelling about that knife. I wish\r\nyou would not be so quarrelsome. Poor little Betsey; how cross Susan is\r\nto you! But you should not have taken it out, my dear, when I sent you\r\nto the drawer. You know I told you not to touch it, because Susan is so\r\ncross about it. I must hide it another time, Betsey. Poor Mary little\r\nthought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to\r\nkeep, only two hours before she died. Poor little soul! she could but\r\njust speak to be heard, and she said so prettily, \xe2\x80\x98Let sister Susan\r\nhave my knife, mama, when I am dead and buried.\xe2\x80\x99 Poor little dear! she\r\nwas so fond of it, Fanny, that she would have it lay by her in bed, all\r\nthrough her illness. It was the gift of her good godmother, old Mrs.\r\nAdmiral Maxwell, only six weeks before she was taken for death. Poor\r\nlittle sweet creature! Well, she was taken away from evil to come. My\r\nown Betsey\xe2\x80\x9d (fondling her), \xe2\x80\x9c_you_ have not the luck of such a good\r\ngodmother. Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people\r\nas you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris, but a message to\r\nsay she hoped that her god-daughter was a good girl, and learnt her\r\nbook. There had been at one moment a slight murmur in the drawing-room\r\nat Mansfield Park about sending her a prayer-book; but no second sound\r\nhad been heard of such a purpose. Mrs. Norris, however, had gone home\r\nand taken down two old prayer-books of her husband with that idea; but,\r\nupon examination, the ardour of generosity went off. One was found to\r\nhave too small a print for a child\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and the other to be too\r\ncumbersome for her to carry about.\r\n\r\nFanny, fatigued and fatigued again, was thankful to accept the first\r\ninvitation of going to bed; and before Betsey had finished her cry at\r\nbeing allowed to sit up only one hour extraordinary in honour of\r\nsister, she was off, leaving all below in confusion and noise again;\r\nthe boys begging for toasted cheese, her father calling out for his rum\r\nand water, and Rebecca never where she ought to be.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to raise her spirits in the confined and scantily\r\nfurnished chamber that she was to share with Susan. The smallness of\r\nthe rooms above and below, indeed, and the narrowness of the passage\r\nand staircase, struck her beyond her imagination. She soon learned to\r\nthink with respect of her own little attic at Mansfield Park, in _that_\r\nhouse reckoned too small for anybody\xe2\x80\x99s comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nCould Sir Thomas have seen all his niece\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, when she wrote her\r\nfirst letter to her aunt, he would not have despaired; for though a\r\ngood night\xe2\x80\x99s rest, a pleasant morning, the hope of soon seeing William\r\nagain, and the comparatively quiet state of the house, from Tom and\r\nCharles being gone to school, Sam on some project of his own, and her\r\nfather on his usual lounges, enabled her to express herself cheerfully\r\non the subject of home, there were still, to her own perfect\r\nconsciousness, many drawbacks suppressed. Could he have seen only half\r\nthat she felt before the end of a week, he would have thought Mr.\r\nCrawford sure of her, and been delighted with his own sagacity.\r\n\r\nBefore the week ended, it was all disappointment. In the first place,\r\nWilliam was gone. The Thrush had had her orders, the wind had changed,\r\nand he was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth; and\r\nduring those days she had seen him only twice, in a short and hurried\r\nway, when he had come ashore on duty. There had been no free\r\nconversation, no walk on the ramparts, no visit to the dockyard, no\r\nacquaintance with the Thrush, nothing of all that they had planned and\r\ndepended on. Everything in that quarter failed her, except William\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffection. His last thought on leaving home was for her. He stepped\r\nback again to the door to say, \xe2\x80\x9cTake care of Fanny, mother. She is\r\ntender, and not used to rough it like the rest of us. I charge you,\r\ntake care of Fanny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilliam was gone: and the home he had left her in was, Fanny could not\r\nconceal it from herself, in almost every respect the very reverse of\r\nwhat she could have wished. It was the abode of noise, disorder, and\r\nimpropriety. Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it\r\nought to be. She could not respect her parents as she had hoped. On her\r\nfather, her confidence had not been sanguine, but he was more negligent\r\nof his family, his habits were worse, and his manners coarser, than she\r\nhad been prepared for. He did not want abilities but he had no\r\ncuriosity, and no information beyond his profession; he read only the\r\nnewspaper and the navy-list; he talked only of the dockyard, the\r\nharbour, Spithead, and the Motherbank; he swore and he drank, he was\r\ndirty and gross. She had never been able to recall anything approaching\r\nto tenderness in his former treatment of herself. There had remained\r\nonly a general impression of roughness and loudness; and now he\r\nscarcely ever noticed her, but to make her the object of a coarse joke.\r\n\r\nHer disappointment in her mother was greater: _there_ she had hoped\r\nmuch, and found almost nothing. Every flattering scheme of being of\r\nconsequence to her soon fell to the ground. Mrs. Price was not unkind;\r\nbut, instead of gaining on her affection and confidence, and becoming\r\nmore and more dear, her daughter never met with greater kindness from\r\nher than on the first day of her arrival. The instinct of nature was\r\nsoon satisfied, and Mrs. Price\xe2\x80\x99s attachment had no other source. Her\r\nheart and her time were already quite full; she had neither leisure nor\r\naffection to bestow on Fanny. Her daughters never had been much to her.\r\nShe was fond of her sons, especially of William, but Betsey was the\r\nfirst of her girls whom she had ever much regarded. To her she was most\r\ninjudiciously indulgent. William was her pride; Betsey her darling; and\r\nJohn, Richard, Sam, Tom, and Charles occupied all the rest of her\r\nmaternal solicitude, alternately her worries and her comforts. These\r\nshared her heart: her time was given chiefly to her house and her\r\nservants. Her days were spent in a kind of slow bustle; all was busy\r\nwithout getting on, always behindhand and lamenting it, without\r\naltering her ways; wishing to be an economist, without contrivance or\r\nregularity; dissatisfied with her servants, without skill to make them\r\nbetter, and whether helping, or reprimanding, or indulging them,\r\nwithout any power of engaging their respect.\r\n\r\nOf her two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram\r\nthan Mrs. Norris. She was a manager by necessity, without any of Mrs.\r\nNorris\xe2\x80\x99s inclination for it, or any of her activity. Her disposition\r\nwas naturally easy and indolent, like Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s; and a situation\r\nof similar affluence and do-nothingness would have been much more\r\nsuited to her capacity than the exertions and self-denials of the one\r\nwhich her imprudent marriage had placed her in. She might have made\r\njust as good a woman of consequence as Lady Bertram, but Mrs. Norris\r\nwould have been a more respectable mother of nine children on a small\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nMuch of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of. She might scruple\r\nto make use of the words, but she must and did feel that her mother was\r\na partial, ill-judging parent, a dawdle, a slattern, who neither taught\r\nnor restrained her children, whose house was the scene of mismanagement\r\nand discomfort from beginning to end, and who had no talent, no\r\nconversation, no affection towards herself; no curiosity to know her\r\nbetter, no desire of her friendship, and no inclination for her company\r\nthat could lessen her sense of such feelings.\r\n\r\nFanny was very anxious to be useful, and not to appear above her home,\r\nor in any way disqualified or disinclined, by her foreign education,\r\nfrom contributing her help to its comforts, and therefore set about\r\nworking for Sam immediately; and by working early and late, with\r\nperseverance and great despatch, did so much that the boy was shipped\r\noff at last, with more than half his linen ready. She had great\r\npleasure in feeling her usefulness, but could not conceive how they\r\nwould have managed without her.\r\n\r\nSam, loud and overbearing as he was, she rather regretted when he went,\r\nfor he was clever and intelligent, and glad to be employed in any\r\nerrand in the town; and though spurning the remonstrances of Susan,\r\ngiven as they were, though very reasonable in themselves, with\r\nill-timed and powerless warmth, was beginning to be influenced by\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s services and gentle persuasions; and she found that the best of\r\nthe three younger ones was gone in him: Tom and Charles being at least\r\nas many years as they were his juniors distant from that age of feeling\r\nand reason, which might suggest the expediency of making friends, and\r\nof endeavouring to be less disagreeable. Their sister soon despaired of\r\nmaking the smallest impression on _them_; they were quite untameable by\r\nany means of address which she had spirits or time to attempt. Every\r\nafternoon brought a return of their riotous games all over the house;\r\nand she very early learned to sigh at the approach of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconstant half-holiday.\r\n\r\nBetsey, too, a spoiled child, trained up to think the alphabet her\r\ngreatest enemy, left to be with the servants at her pleasure, and then\r\nencouraged to report any evil of them, she was almost as ready to\r\ndespair of being able to love or assist; and of Susan\xe2\x80\x99s temper she had\r\nmany doubts. Her continual disagreements with her mother, her rash\r\nsquabbles with Tom and Charles, and petulance with Betsey, were at\r\nleast so distressing to Fanny that, though admitting they were by no\r\nmeans without provocation, she feared the disposition that could push\r\nthem to such length must be far from amiable, and from affording any\r\nrepose to herself.\r\n\r\nSuch was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her head, and teach\r\nher to think of her cousin Edmund with moderated feelings. On the\r\ncontrary, she could think of nothing but Mansfield, its beloved\r\ninmates, its happy ways. Everything where she now was in full contrast\r\nto it. The elegance, propriety, regularity, harmony, and perhaps, above\r\nall, the peace and tranquillity of Mansfield, were brought to her\r\nremembrance every hour of the day, by the prevalence of everything\r\nopposite to them _here_.\r\n\r\nThe living in incessant noise was, to a frame and temper delicate and\r\nnervous like Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s, an evil which no superadded elegance or harmony\r\ncould have entirely atoned for. It was the greatest misery of all. At\r\nMansfield, no sounds of contention, no raised voice, no abrupt bursts,\r\nno tread of violence, was ever heard; all proceeded in a regular course\r\nof cheerful orderliness; everybody had their due importance;\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s feelings were consulted. If tenderness could be ever\r\nsupposed wanting, good sense and good breeding supplied its place; and\r\nas to the little irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris, they\r\nwere short, they were trifling, they were as a drop of water to the\r\nocean, compared with the ceaseless tumult of her present abode. Here\r\neverybody was noisy, every voice was loud (excepting, perhaps, her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s, which resembled the soft monotony of Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s, only\r\nworn into fretfulness). Whatever was wanted was hallooed for, and the\r\nservants hallooed out their excuses from the kitchen. The doors were in\r\nconstant banging, the stairs were never at rest, nothing was done\r\nwithout a clatter, nobody sat still, and nobody could command attention\r\nwhen they spoke.\r\n\r\nIn a review of the two houses, as they appeared to her before the end\r\nof a week, Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s celebrated\r\njudgment as to matrimony and celibacy, and say, that though Mansfield\r\nPark might have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n\r\nFanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss Crawford now\r\nat the rapid rate in which their correspondence had begun; Mary\xe2\x80\x99s next\r\nletter was after a decidedly longer interval than the last, but she was\r\nnot right in supposing that such an interval would be felt a great\r\nrelief to herself. Here was another strange revolution of mind! She was\r\nreally glad to receive the letter when it did come. In her present\r\nexile from good society, and distance from everything that had been\r\nwont to interest her, a letter from one belonging to the set where her\r\nheart lived, written with affection, and some degree of elegance, was\r\nthoroughly acceptable. The usual plea of increasing engagements was\r\nmade in excuse for not having written to her earlier; \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now that I\r\nhave begun,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cmy letter will not be worth your reading,\r\nfor there will be no little offering of love at the end, no three or\r\nfour lines _passionn\xc3\xa9es_ from the most devoted H. C. in the world, for\r\nHenry is in Norfolk; business called him to Everingham ten days ago, or\r\nperhaps he only pretended the call, for the sake of being travelling at\r\nthe same time that you were. But there he is, and, by the bye, his\r\nabsence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nwriting, for there has been no \xe2\x80\x98Well, Mary, when do you write to Fanny?\r\nIs not it time for you to write to Fanny?\xe2\x80\x99 to spur me on. At last,\r\nafter various attempts at meeting, I have seen your cousins, \xe2\x80\x98dear\r\nJulia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99; they found me at home yesterday, and\r\nwe were glad to see each other again. We _seemed_ _very_ glad to see\r\neach other, and I do really think we were a little. We had a vast deal\r\nto say. Shall I tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was\r\nmentioned? I did not use to think her wanting in self-possession, but\r\nshe had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday. Upon the whole,\r\nJulia was in the best looks of the two, at least after you were spoken\r\nof. There was no recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98Fanny,\xe2\x80\x99 and spoke of her as a sister should. But Mrs. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nday of good looks will come; we have cards for her first party on the\r\n28th. Then she will be in beauty, for she will open one of the best\r\nhouses in Wimpole Street. I was in it two years ago, when it was Lady\r\nLascelle\xe2\x80\x99s, and prefer it to almost any I know in London, and certainly\r\nshe will then feel, to use a vulgar phrase, that she has got her\r\npennyworth for her penny. Henry could not have afforded her such a\r\nhouse. I hope she will recollect it, and be satisfied, as well as she\r\nmay, with moving the queen of a palace, though the king may appear best\r\nin the background; and as I have no desire to tease her, I shall never\r\n_force_ your name upon her again. She will grow sober by degrees. From\r\nall that I hear and guess, Baron Wildenheim\xe2\x80\x99s attentions to Julia\r\ncontinue, but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement. She\r\nought to do better. A poor honourable is no catch, and I cannot imagine\r\nany liking in the case, for take away his rants, and the poor baron has\r\nnothing. What a difference a vowel makes! If his rents were but equal\r\nto his rants! Your cousin Edmund moves slowly; detained, perchance, by\r\nparish duties. There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be\r\nconverted. I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a _young_ one.\r\nAdieu! my dear sweet Fanny, this is a long letter from London: write me\r\na pretty one in reply to gladden Henry\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, when he comes back, and\r\nsend me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain\r\nfor his sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was great food for meditation in this letter, and chiefly for\r\nunpleasant meditation; and yet, with all the uneasiness it supplied, it\r\nconnected her with the absent, it told her of people and things about\r\nwhom she had never felt so much curiosity as now, and she would have\r\nbeen glad to have been sure of such a letter every week. Her\r\ncorrespondence with her aunt Bertram was her only concern of higher\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAs for any society in Portsmouth, that could at all make amends for\r\ndeficiencies at home, there were none within the circle of her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand mother\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance to afford her the smallest satisfaction: she\r\nsaw nobody in whose favour she could wish to overcome her own shyness\r\nand reserve. The men appeared to her all coarse, the women all pert,\r\neverybody underbred; and she gave as little contentment as she received\r\nfrom introductions either to old or new acquaintance. The young ladies\r\nwho approached her at first with some respect, in consideration of her\r\ncoming from a baronet\xe2\x80\x99s family, were soon offended by what they termed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cairs\xe2\x80\x9d; for, as she neither played on the pianoforte nor wore fine\r\npelisses, they could, on farther observation, admit no right of\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\nThe first solid consolation which Fanny received for the evils of home,\r\nthe first which her judgment could entirely approve, and which gave any\r\npromise of durability, was in a better knowledge of Susan, and a hope\r\nof being of service to her. Susan had always behaved pleasantly to\r\nherself, but the determined character of her general manners had\r\nastonished and alarmed her, and it was at least a fortnight before she\r\nbegan to understand a disposition so totally different from her own.\r\nSusan saw that much was wrong at home, and wanted to set it right. That\r\na girl of fourteen, acting only on her own unassisted reason, should\r\nerr in the method of reform, was not wonderful; and Fanny soon became\r\nmore disposed to admire the natural light of the mind which could so\r\nearly distinguish justly, than to censure severely the faults of\r\nconduct to which it led. Susan was only acting on the same truths, and\r\npursuing the same system, which her own judgment acknowledged, but\r\nwhich her more supine and yielding temper would have shrunk from\r\nasserting. Susan tried to be useful, where _she_ could only have gone\r\naway and cried; and that Susan was useful she could perceive; that\r\nthings, bad as they were, would have been worse but for such\r\ninterposition, and that both her mother and Betsey were restrained from\r\nsome excesses of very offensive indulgence and vulgarity.\r\n\r\nIn every argument with her mother, Susan had in point of reason the\r\nadvantage, and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her off.\r\nThe blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around her she had\r\nnever known. There was no gratitude for affection past or present to\r\nmake her better bear with its excesses to the others.\r\n\r\nAll this became gradually evident, and gradually placed Susan before\r\nher sister as an object of mingled compassion and respect. That her\r\nmanner was wrong, however, at times very wrong, her measures often\r\nill-chosen and ill-timed, and her looks and language very often\r\nindefensible, Fanny could not cease to feel; but she began to hope they\r\nmight be rectified. Susan, she found, looked up to her and wished for\r\nher good opinion; and new as anything like an office of authority was\r\nto Fanny, new as it was to imagine herself capable of guiding or\r\ninforming any one, she did resolve to give occasional hints to Susan,\r\nand endeavour to exercise for her advantage the juster notions of what\r\nwas due to everybody, and what would be wisest for herself, which her\r\nown more favoured education had fixed in her.\r\n\r\nHer influence, or at least the consciousness and use of it, originated\r\nin an act of kindness by Susan, which, after many hesitations of\r\ndelicacy, she at last worked herself up to. It had very early occurred\r\nto her that a small sum of money might, perhaps, restore peace for ever\r\non the sore subject of the silver knife, canvassed as it now was\r\ncontinually, and the riches which she was in possession of herself, her\r\nuncle having given her \xc2\xa310 at parting, made her as able as she was\r\nwilling to be generous. But she was so wholly unused to confer favours,\r\nexcept on the very poor, so unpractised in removing evils, or bestowing\r\nkindnesses among her equals, and so fearful of appearing to elevate\r\nherself as a great lady at home, that it took some time to determine\r\nthat it would not be unbecoming in her to make such a present. It was\r\nmade, however, at last: a silver knife was bought for Betsey, and\r\naccepted with great delight, its newness giving it every advantage over\r\nthe other that could be desired; Susan was established in the full\r\npossession of her own, Betsey handsomely declaring that now she had got\r\none so much prettier herself, she should never want _that_ again; and\r\nno reproach seemed conveyed to the equally satisfied mother, which\r\nFanny had almost feared to be impossible. The deed thoroughly answered:\r\na source of domestic altercation was entirely done away, and it was the\r\nmeans of opening Susan\xe2\x80\x99s heart to her, and giving her something more to\r\nlove and be interested in. Susan shewed that she had delicacy: pleased\r\nas she was to be mistress of property which she had been struggling for\r\nat least two years, she yet feared that her sister\xe2\x80\x99s judgment had been\r\nagainst her, and that a reproof was designed her for having so\r\nstruggled as to make the purchase necessary for the tranquillity of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHer temper was open. She acknowledged her fears, blamed herself for\r\nhaving contended so warmly; and from that hour Fanny, understanding the\r\nworth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to\r\nseek her good opinion and refer to her judgment, began to feel again\r\nthe blessing of affection, and to entertain the hope of being useful to\r\na mind so much in need of help, and so much deserving it. She gave\r\nadvice, advice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding, and\r\ngiven so mildly and considerately as not to irritate an imperfect\r\ntemper, and she had the happiness of observing its good effects not\r\nunfrequently. More was not expected by one who, while seeing all the\r\nobligation and expediency of submission and forbearance, saw also with\r\nsympathetic acuteness of feeling all that must be hourly grating to a\r\ngirl like Susan. Her greatest wonder on the subject soon became\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nthat Susan should have been provoked into disrespect and impatience\r\nagainst her better knowledge\xe2\x80\x94but that so much better knowledge, so many\r\ngood notions should have been hers at all; and that, brought up in the\r\nmidst of negligence and error, she should have formed such proper\r\nopinions of what ought to be; she, who had had no cousin Edmund to\r\ndirect her thoughts or fix her principles.\r\n\r\nThe intimacy thus begun between them was a material advantage to each.\r\nBy sitting together upstairs, they avoided a great deal of the\r\ndisturbance of the house; Fanny had peace, and Susan learned to think\r\nit no misfortune to be quietly employed. They sat without a fire; but\r\nthat was a privation familiar even to Fanny, and she suffered the less\r\nbecause reminded by it of the East room. It was the only point of\r\nresemblance. In space, light, furniture, and prospect, there was\r\nnothing alike in the two apartments; and she often heaved a sigh at the\r\nremembrance of all her books and boxes, and various comforts there. By\r\ndegrees the girls came to spend the chief of the morning upstairs, at\r\nfirst only in working and talking, but after a few days, the\r\nremembrance of the said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny\r\nfound it impossible not to try for books again. There were none in her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house; but wealth is luxurious and daring, and some of hers\r\nfound its way to a circulating library. She became a subscriber; amazed\r\nat being anything _in propria persona_, amazed at her own doings in\r\nevery way, to be a renter, a chuser of books! And to be having any\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s improvement in view in her choice! But so it was. Susan had read\r\nnothing, and Fanny longed to give her a share in her own first\r\npleasures, and inspire a taste for the biography and poetry which she\r\ndelighted in herself.\r\n\r\nIn this occupation she hoped, moreover, to bury some of the\r\nrecollections of Mansfield, which were too apt to seize her mind if her\r\nfingers only were busy; and, especially at this time, hoped it might be\r\nuseful in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London,\r\nwhither, on the authority of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s last letter, she knew he was\r\ngone. She had no doubt of what would ensue. The promised notification\r\nwas hanging over her head. The postman\xe2\x80\x99s knock within the neighbourhood\r\nwas beginning to bring its daily terrors, and if reading could banish\r\nthe idea for even half an hour, it was something gained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n\r\nA week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town, and Fanny had\r\nheard nothing of him. There were three different conclusions to be\r\ndrawn from his silence, between which her mind was in fluctuation; each\r\nof them at times being held the most probable. Either his going had\r\nbeen again delayed, or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing\r\nMiss Crawford alone, or he was too happy for letter-writing!\r\n\r\nOne morning, about this time, Fanny having now been nearly four weeks\r\nfrom Mansfield, a point which she never failed to think over and\r\ncalculate every day, as she and Susan were preparing to remove, as\r\nusual, upstairs, they were stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom they\r\nfelt they could not avoid, from Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s alertness in going to the\r\ndoor, a duty which always interested her beyond any other.\r\n\r\nIt was a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s voice; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning\r\npale about, when Mr. Crawford walked into the room.\r\n\r\nGood sense, like hers, will always act when really called upon; and she\r\nfound that she had been able to name him to her mother, and recall her\r\nremembrance of the name, as that of \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam\xe2\x80\x99s friend,\xe2\x80\x9d though she\r\ncould not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a\r\nsyllable at such a moment. The consciousness of his being known there\r\nonly as William\xe2\x80\x99s friend was some support. Having introduced him,\r\nhowever, and being all reseated, the terrors that occurred of what this\r\nvisit might lead to were overpowering, and she fancied herself on the\r\npoint of fainting away.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to keep herself alive, their visitor, who had at first\r\napproached her with as animated a countenance as ever, was wisely and\r\nkindly keeping his eyes away, and giving her time to recover, while he\r\ndevoted himself entirely to her mother, addressing her, and attending\r\nto her with the utmost politeness and propriety, at the same time with\r\na degree of friendliness, of interest at least, which was making his\r\nmanner perfect.\r\n\r\nMrs. Price\xe2\x80\x99s manners were also at their best. Warmed by the sight of\r\nsuch a friend to her son, and regulated by the wish of appearing to\r\nadvantage before him, she was overflowing with gratitude\xe2\x80\x94artless,\r\nmaternal gratitude\xe2\x80\x94which could not be unpleasing. Mr. Price was out,\r\nwhich she regretted very much. Fanny was just recovered enough to feel\r\nthat _she_ could not regret it; for to her many other sources of\r\nuneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he\r\nfound her. She might scold herself for the weakness, but there was no\r\nscolding it away. She was ashamed, and she would have been yet more\r\nashamed of her father than of all the rest.\r\n\r\nThey talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire;\r\nand Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart\r\ncould wish. She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her\r\nlife; and was only astonished to find that, so great and so agreeable\r\nas he was, he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to\r\nthe port-admiral, nor the commissioner, nor yet with the intention of\r\ngoing over to the island, nor of seeing the dockyard. Nothing of all\r\nthat she had been used to think of as the proof of importance, or the\r\nemployment of wealth, had brought him to Portsmouth. He had reached it\r\nlate the night before, was come for a day or two, was staying at the\r\nCrown, had accidentally met with a navy officer or two of his\r\nacquaintance since his arrival, but had no object of that kind in\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had given all this information, it was not unreasonable\r\nto suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she was\r\ntolerably able to bear his eye, and hear that he had spent half an hour\r\nwith his sister the evening before his leaving London; that she had\r\nsent her best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing; that\r\nhe thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having\r\nspent scarcely twenty-four hours in London, after his return from\r\nNorfolk, before he set off again; that her cousin Edmund was in town,\r\nhad been in town, he understood, a few days; that he had not seen him\r\nhimself, but that he was well, had left them all well at Mansfield, and\r\nwas to dine, as yesterday, with the Frasers.\r\n\r\nFanny listened collectedly, even to the last-mentioned circumstance;\r\nnay, it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any certainty; and\r\nthe words, \xe2\x80\x9cthen by this time it is all settled,\xe2\x80\x9d passed internally,\r\nwithout more evidence of emotion than a faint blush.\r\n\r\nAfter talking a little more about Mansfield, a subject in which her\r\ninterest was most apparent, Crawford began to hint at the expediency of\r\nan early walk. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a lovely morning, and at that season of the year\r\na fine morning so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybody\r\nnot to delay their exercise\xe2\x80\x9d; and such hints producing nothing, he soon\r\nproceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her daughters\r\nto take their walk without loss of time. Now they came to an\r\nunderstanding. Mrs. Price, it appeared, scarcely ever stirred out of\r\ndoors, except of a Sunday; she owned she could seldom, with her large\r\nfamily, find time for a walk. \xe2\x80\x9cWould she not, then, persuade her\r\ndaughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow him the pleasure\r\nof attending them?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and very complying.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer daughters were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place;\r\nthey did not often get out; and she knew they had some errands in the\r\ntown, which they would be very glad to do.\xe2\x80\x9d And the consequence was,\r\nthat Fanny, strange as it was\xe2\x80\x94strange, awkward, and distressing\xe2\x80\x94found\r\nherself and Susan, within ten minutes, walking towards the High Street\r\nwith Mr. Crawford.\r\n\r\nIt was soon pain upon pain, confusion upon confusion; for they were\r\nhardly in the High Street before they met her father, whose appearance\r\nwas not the better from its being Saturday. He stopt; and,\r\nungentlemanlike as he looked, Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr.\r\nCrawford. She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr.\r\nCrawford must be struck. He must be ashamed and disgusted altogether.\r\nHe must soon give her up, and cease to have the smallest inclination\r\nfor the match; and yet, though she had been so much wanting his\r\naffection to be cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost as\r\nbad as the complaint; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in\r\nthe United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of\r\nbeing sought by a clever, agreeable man, than have him driven away by\r\nthe vulgarity of her nearest relations.\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father-in-law with\r\nany idea of taking him for a model in dress; but (as Fanny instantly,\r\nand to her great relief, discerned) her father was a very different\r\nman, a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly\r\nrespected stranger, from what he was in his own family at home. His\r\nmanners now, though not polished, were more than passable: they were\r\ngrateful, animated, manly; his expressions were those of an attached\r\nfather, and a sensible man; his loud tones did very well in the open\r\nair, and there was not a single oath to be heard. Such was his\r\ninstinctive compliment to the good manners of Mr. Crawford; and, be the\r\nconsequence what it might, Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s immediate feelings were infinitely\r\nsoothed.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the two gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s civilities was an offer of Mr.\r\nPrice\xe2\x80\x99s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard, which Mr. Crawford,\r\ndesirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such, though he\r\nhad seen the dockyard again and again, and hoping to be so much the\r\nlonger with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of, if\r\nthe Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue; and as it was somehow\r\nor other ascertained, or inferred, or at least acted upon, that they\r\nwere not at all afraid, to the dockyard they were all to go; and but\r\nfor Mr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned thither directly, without\r\nthe smallest consideration for his daughters\xe2\x80\x99 errands in the High\r\nStreet. He took care, however, that they should be allowed to go to the\r\nshops they came out expressly to visit; and it did not delay them long,\r\nfor Fanny could so little bear to excite impatience, or be waited for,\r\nthat before the gentlemen, as they stood at the door, could do more\r\nthan begin upon the last naval regulations, or settle the number of\r\nthree-deckers now in commission, their companions were ready to\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nThey were then to set forward for the dockyard at once, and the walk\r\nwould have been conducted\xe2\x80\x94according to Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nsingular manner, had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of\r\nit, as the two girls, he found, would have been left to follow, and\r\nkeep up with them or not, as they could, while they walked on together\r\nat their own hasty pace. He was able to introduce some improvement\r\noccasionally, though by no means to the extent he wished; he absolutely\r\nwould not walk away from them; and at any crossing or any crowd, when\r\nMr. Price was only calling out, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue,\r\ntake care of yourselves; keep a sharp lookout!\xe2\x80\x9d he would give them his\r\nparticular attendance.\r\n\r\nOnce fairly in the dockyard, he began to reckon upon some happy\r\nintercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon joined by a brother\r\nlounger of Mr. Price\xe2\x80\x99s, who was come to take his daily survey of how\r\nthings went on, and who must prove a far more worthy companion than\r\nhimself; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied\r\ngoing about together, and discussing matters of equal and never-failing\r\ninterest, while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the\r\nyard, or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all\r\nwent to look at. Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest. Crawford\r\ncould not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down; but\r\nhe could have wished her sister away. A quick-looking girl of Susan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nage was the very worst third in the world: totally different from Lady\r\nBertram, all eyes and ears; and there was no introducing the main point\r\nbefore her. He must content himself with being only generally\r\nagreeable, and letting Susan have her share of entertainment, with the\r\nindulgence, now and then, of a look or hint for the better-informed and\r\nconscious Fanny. Norfolk was what he had mostly to talk of: there he\r\nhad been some time, and everything there was rising in importance from\r\nhis present schemes. Such a man could come from no place, no society,\r\nwithout importing something to amuse; his journeys and his acquaintance\r\nwere all of use, and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her.\r\nFor Fanny, somewhat more was related than the accidental agreeableness\r\nof the parties he had been in. For her approbation, the particular\r\nreason of his going into Norfolk at all, at this unusual time of year,\r\nwas given. It had been real business, relative to the renewal of a\r\nlease in which the welfare of a large and\xe2\x80\x94he believed\xe2\x80\x94industrious\r\nfamily was at stake. He had suspected his agent of some underhand\r\ndealing; of meaning to bias him against the deserving; and he had\r\ndetermined to go himself, and thoroughly investigate the merits of the\r\ncase. He had gone, had done even more good than he had foreseen, had\r\nbeen useful to more than his first plan had comprehended, and was now\r\nable to congratulate himself upon it, and to feel that in performing a\r\nduty, he had secured agreeable recollections for his own mind. He had\r\nintroduced himself to some tenants whom he had never seen before; he\r\nhad begun making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence,\r\nthough on his own estate, had been hitherto unknown to him. This was\r\naimed, and well aimed, at Fanny. It was pleasing to hear him speak so\r\nproperly; here he had been acting as he ought to do. To be the friend\r\nof the poor and the oppressed! Nothing could be more grateful to her;\r\nand she was on the point of giving him an approving look, when it was\r\nall frightened off by his adding a something too pointed of his hoping\r\nsoon to have an assistant, a friend, a guide in every plan of utility\r\nor charity for Everingham: a somebody that would make Everingham and\r\nall about it a dearer object than it had ever been yet.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, and wished he would not say such things. She was\r\nwilling to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been\r\nwont to suppose. She began to feel the possibility of his turning out\r\nwell at last; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her,\r\nand ought not to think of her.\r\n\r\nHe perceived that enough had been said of Everingham, and that it would\r\nbe as well to talk of something else, and turned to Mansfield. He could\r\nnot have chosen better; that was a topic to bring back her attention\r\nand her looks almost instantly. It was a real indulgence to her to hear\r\nor to speak of Mansfield. Now so long divided from everybody who knew\r\nthe place, she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned\r\nit, and led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties\r\nand comforts, and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed\r\nher to gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium, in speaking of\r\nher uncle as all that was clever and good, and her aunt as having the\r\nsweetest of all sweet tempers.\r\n\r\nHe had a great attachment to Mansfield himself; he said so; he looked\r\nforward with the hope of spending much, very much, of his time there;\r\nalways there, or in the neighbourhood. He particularly built upon a\r\nvery happy summer and autumn there this year; he felt that it would be\r\nso: he depended upon it; a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the\r\nlast. As animated, as diversified, as social, but with circumstances of\r\nsuperiority undescribable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMansfield, Sotherton, Thornton Lacey,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a society\r\nwill be comprised in those houses! And at Michaelmas, perhaps, a fourth\r\nmay be added: some small hunting-box in the vicinity of everything so\r\ndear; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey, as Edmund Bertram\r\nonce good-humouredly proposed, I hope I foresee two objections: two\r\nfair, excellent, irresistible objections to that plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny was doubly silenced here; though when the moment was passed,\r\ncould regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged\r\ncomprehension of one half of his meaning, and encouraged him to say\r\nsomething more of his sister and Edmund. It was a subject which she\r\nmust learn to speak of, and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon\r\nbe quite unpardonable.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished, or had\r\ntime for, the others were ready to return; and in the course of their\r\nwalk back, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute\xe2\x80\x99s privacy for telling Fanny\r\nthat his only business in Portsmouth was to see her; that he was come\r\ndown for a couple of days on her account, and hers only, and because he\r\ncould not endure a longer total separation. She was sorry, really\r\nsorry; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which\r\nshe wished he had not said, she thought him altogether improved since\r\nshe had seen him; he was much more gentle, obliging, and attentive to\r\nother people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield; she had\r\nnever seen him so agreeable\xe2\x80\x94so _near_ being agreeable; his behaviour to\r\nher father could not offend, and there was something particularly kind\r\nand proper in the notice he took of Susan. He was decidedly improved.\r\nShe wished the next day over, she wished he had come only for one day;\r\nbut it was not so very bad as she would have expected: the pleasure of\r\ntalking of Mansfield was so very great!\r\n\r\nBefore they parted, she had to thank him for another pleasure, and one\r\nof no trivial kind. Her father asked him to do them the honour of\r\ntaking his mutton with them, and Fanny had time for only one thrill of\r\nhorror, before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement. He\r\nwas engaged to dinner already both for that day and the next; he had\r\nmet with some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied; he\r\nshould have the honour, however, of waiting on them again on the\r\nmorrow, etc., and so they parted\xe2\x80\x94Fanny in a state of actual felicity\r\nfrom escaping so horrible an evil!\r\n\r\nTo have had him join their family dinner-party, and see all their\r\ndeficiencies, would have been dreadful! Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s cookery and Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwaiting, and Betsey\xe2\x80\x99s eating at table without restraint, and pulling\r\neverything about as she chose, were what Fanny herself was not yet\r\nenough inured to for her often to make a tolerable meal. _She_ was nice\r\nonly from natural delicacy, but _he_ had been brought up in a school of\r\nluxury and epicurism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prices were just setting off for church the next day when Mr.\r\nCrawford appeared again. He came, not to stop, but to join them; he was\r\nasked to go with them to the Garrison chapel, which was exactly what he\r\nhad intended, and they all walked thither together.\r\n\r\nThe family were now seen to advantage. Nature had given them no\r\ninconsiderable share of beauty, and every Sunday dressed them in their\r\ncleanest skins and best attire. Sunday always brought this comfort to\r\nFanny, and on this Sunday she felt it more than ever. Her poor mother\r\nnow did not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s sister as she\r\nwas but too apt to look. It often grieved her to the heart to think of\r\nthe contrast between them; to think that where nature had made so\r\nlittle difference, circumstances should have made so much, and that her\r\nmother, as handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her junior, should\r\nhave an appearance so much more worn and faded, so comfortless, so\r\nslatternly, so shabby. But Sunday made her a very creditable and\r\ntolerably cheerful-looking Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family\r\nof children, feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and only\r\ndiscomposed if she saw her boys run into danger, or Rebecca pass by\r\nwith a flower in her hat.\r\n\r\nIn chapel they were obliged to divide, but Mr. Crawford took care not\r\nto be divided from the female branch; and after chapel he still\r\ncontinued with them, and made one in the family party on the ramparts.\r\n\r\nMrs. Price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every fine Sunday\r\nthroughout the year, always going directly after morning service and\r\nstaying till dinner-time. It was her public place: there she met her\r\nacquaintance, heard a little news, talked over the badness of the\r\nPortsmouth servants, and wound up her spirits for the six days ensuing.\r\n\r\nThither they now went; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the Miss\r\nPrices as his peculiar charge; and before they had been there long,\r\nsomehow or other, there was no saying how, Fanny could not have\r\nbelieved it, but he was walking between them with an arm of each under\r\nhis, and she did not know how to prevent or put an end to it. It made\r\nher uncomfortable for a time, but yet there were enjoyments in the day\r\nand in the view which would be felt.\r\n\r\nThe day was uncommonly lovely. It was really March; but it was April in\r\nits mild air, brisk soft wind, and bright sun, occasionally clouded for\r\na minute; and everything looked so beautiful under the influence of\r\nsuch a sky, the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships\r\nat Spithead and the island beyond, with the ever-varying hues of the\r\nsea, now at high water, dancing in its glee and dashing against the\r\nramparts with so fine a sound, produced altogether such a combination\r\nof charms for Fanny, as made her gradually almost careless of the\r\ncircumstances under which she felt them. Nay, had she been without his\r\narm, she would soon have known that she needed it, for she wanted\r\nstrength for a two hours\xe2\x80\x99 saunter of this kind, coming, as it generally\r\ndid, upon a week\xe2\x80\x99s previous inactivity. Fanny was beginning to feel the\r\neffect of being debarred from her usual regular exercise; she had lost\r\nground as to health since her being in Portsmouth; and but for Mr.\r\nCrawford and the beauty of the weather would soon have been knocked up\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe loveliness of the day, and of the view, he felt like herself. They\r\noften stopt with the same sentiment and taste, leaning against the\r\nwall, some minutes, to look and admire; and considering he was not\r\nEdmund, Fanny could not but allow that he was sufficiently open to the\r\ncharms of nature, and very well able to express his admiration. She had\r\na few tender reveries now and then, which he could sometimes take\r\nadvantage of to look in her face without detection; and the result of\r\nthese looks was, that though as bewitching as ever, her face was less\r\nblooming than it ought to be. She _said_ she was very well, and did not\r\nlike to be supposed otherwise; but take it all in all, he was convinced\r\nthat her present residence could not be comfortable, and therefore\r\ncould not be salutary for her, and he was growing anxious for her being\r\nagain at Mansfield, where her own happiness, and his in seeing her,\r\nmust be so much greater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been here a month, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; not quite a month. It is only four weeks to-morrow since I left\r\nMansfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a most accurate and honest reckoner. I should call that a\r\nmonth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not arrive here till Tuesday evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is to be a two months\xe2\x80\x99 visit, is not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. My uncle talked of two months. I suppose it will not be less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how are you to be conveyed back again? Who comes for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know. I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt. Perhaps\r\nI may be to stay longer. It may not be convenient for me to be fetched\r\nexactly at the two months\xe2\x80\x99 end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, Mr. Crawford replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI know Mansfield, I\r\nknow its way, I know its faults towards _you_. I know the danger of\r\nyour being so far forgotten, as to have your comforts give way to the\r\nimaginary convenience of any single being in the family. I am aware\r\nthat you may be left here week after week, if Sir Thomas cannot settle\r\neverything for coming himself, or sending your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s maid for you,\r\nwithout involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he\r\nmay have laid down for the next quarter of a year. This will not do.\r\nTwo months is an ample allowance; I should think six weeks quite\r\nenough. I am considering your sister\xe2\x80\x99s health,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, addressing\r\nhimself to Susan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I think the confinement of Portsmouth\r\nunfavourable to. She requires constant air and exercise. When you know\r\nher as well as I do, I am sure you will agree that she does, and that\r\nshe ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of\r\nthe country. If, therefore\xe2\x80\x9d (turning again to Fanny), \xe2\x80\x9cyou find\r\nyourself growing unwell, and any difficulties arise about your\r\nreturning to Mansfield, without waiting for the two months to be ended,\r\n_that_ must not be regarded as of any consequence, if you feel yourself\r\nat all less strong or comfortable than usual, and will only let my\r\nsister know it, give her only the slightest hint, she and I will\r\nimmediately come down, and take you back to Mansfield. You know the\r\nease and the pleasure with which this would be done. You know all that\r\nwould be felt on the occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny thanked him, but tried to laugh it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am perfectly serious,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cas you perfectly know. And I\r\nhope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition.\r\nIndeed, you shall _not_; it shall not be in your power; for so long\r\nonly as you positively say, in every letter to Mary, \xe2\x80\x98I am well,\xe2\x80\x99 and I\r\nknow you cannot speak or write a falsehood, so long only shall you be\r\nconsidered as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny thanked him again, but was affected and distressed to a degree\r\nthat made it impossible for her to say much, or even to be certain of\r\nwhat she ought to say. This was towards the close of their walk. He\r\nattended them to the last, and left them only at the door of their own\r\nhouse, when he knew them to be going to dinner, and therefore pretended\r\nto be waited for elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you were not so tired,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, still detaining Fanny after\r\nall the others were in the house\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I left you in stronger health.\r\nIs there anything I can do for you in town? I have half an idea of\r\ngoing into Norfolk again soon. I am not satisfied about Maddison. I am\r\nsure he still means to impose on me if possible, and get a cousin of\r\nhis own into a certain mill, which I design for somebody else. I must\r\ncome to an understanding with him. I must make him know that I will not\r\nbe tricked on the south side of Everingham, any more than on the north:\r\nthat I will be master of my own property. I was not explicit enough\r\nwith him before. The mischief such a man does on an estate, both as to\r\nthe credit of his employer and the welfare of the poor, is\r\ninconceivable. I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly,\r\nand put everything at once on such a footing as cannot be afterwards\r\nswerved from. Maddison is a clever fellow; I do not wish to displace\r\nhim, provided he does not try to displace _me_; but it would be simple\r\nto be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me, and worse\r\nthan simple to let him give me a hard-hearted, griping fellow for a\r\ntenant, instead of an honest man, to whom I have given half a promise\r\nalready. Would it not be worse than simple? Shall I go? Do you advise\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advise! You know very well what is right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. When you give me your opinion, I always know what is right. Your\r\njudgment is my rule of right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! do not say so. We have all a better guide in ourselves, if we\r\nwould attend to it, than any other person can be. Good-bye; I wish you\r\na pleasant journey to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nothing I can do for you in town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing; I am much obliged to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no message for anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, my\r\ncousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I\r\nshall soon hear from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write his excuses\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained. He pressed\r\nher hand, looked at her, and was gone. _He_ went to while away the next\r\nthree hours as he could, with his other acquaintance, till the best\r\ndinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment, and\r\n_she_ turned in to her more simple one immediately.\r\n\r\nTheir general fare bore a very different character; and could he have\r\nsuspected how many privations, besides that of exercise, she endured in\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s house, he would have wondered that her looks were not much\r\nmore affected than he found them. She was so little equal to Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npuddings and Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s hashes, brought to table, as they all were, with\r\nsuch accompaniments of half-cleaned plates, and not half-cleaned knives\r\nand forks, that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiest\r\nmeal till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and\r\nbuns. After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the day to\r\nbe hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas, had he known all,\r\nmight have thought his niece in the most promising way of being\r\nstarved, both mind and body, into a much juster value for Mr.\r\nCrawford\xe2\x80\x99s good company and good fortune, he would probably have feared\r\nto push his experiment farther, lest she might die under the cure.\r\n\r\nFanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day. Though tolerably\r\nsecure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again, she could not help being low.\r\nIt was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend; and though, in\r\none light, glad to have him gone, it seemed as if she was now deserted\r\nby everybody; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield; and\r\nshe could not think of his returning to town, and being frequently with\r\nMary and Edmund, without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate\r\nherself for having them.\r\n\r\nHer dejection had no abatement from anything passing around her; a\r\nfriend or two of her father\xe2\x80\x99s, as always happened if he was not with\r\nthem, spent the long, long evening there; and from six o\xe2\x80\x99clock till\r\nhalf-past nine, there was little intermission of noise or grog. She was\r\nvery low. The wonderful improvement which she still fancied in Mr.\r\nCrawford was the nearest to administering comfort of anything within\r\nthe current of her thoughts. Not considering in how different a circle\r\nshe had been just seeing him, nor how much might be owing to contrast,\r\nshe was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and\r\nregardful of others than formerly. And, if in little things, must it\r\nnot be so in great? So anxious for her health and comfort, so very\r\nfeeling as he now expressed himself, and really seemed, might not it be\r\nfairly supposed that he would not much longer persevere in a suit so\r\ndistressing to her?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back, to London, on\r\nthe morrow, for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price\xe2\x80\x99s; and two\r\ndays afterwards, it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following\r\nletter from his sister, opened and read by her, on another account,\r\nwith the most anxious curiosity:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to inform you, my dearest Fanny, that Henry has been down to\r\nPortsmouth to see you; that he had a delightful walk with you to the\r\ndockyard last Saturday, and one still more to be dwelt on the next day,\r\non the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea, and your sweet\r\nlooks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony,\r\nand afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect.\r\nThis, as well as I understand, is to be the substance of my\r\ninformation. He makes me write, but I do not know what else is to be\r\ncommunicated, except this said visit to Portsmouth, and these two said\r\nwalks, and his introduction to your family, especially to a fair sister\r\nof yours, a fine girl of fifteen, who was of the party on the ramparts,\r\ntaking her first lesson, I presume, in love. I have not time for\r\nwriting much, but it would be out of place if I had, for this is to be\r\na mere letter of business, penned for the purpose of conveying\r\nnecessary information, which could not be delayed without risk of evil.\r\nMy dear, dear Fanny, if I had you here, how I would talk to you! You\r\nshould listen to me till you were tired, and advise me till you were\r\nstill tired more; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my\r\ngreat mind on paper, so I will abstain altogether, and leave you to\r\nguess what you like. I have no news for you. You have politics, of\r\ncourse; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people\r\nand parties that fill up my time. I ought to have sent you an account\r\nof your cousin\xe2\x80\x99s first party, but I was lazy, and now it is too long\r\nago; suffice it, that everything was just as it ought to be, in a style\r\nthat any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness, and\r\nthat her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit. My friend,\r\nMrs. Fraser, is mad for such a house, and it would not make _me_\r\nmiserable. I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter; she seems in high\r\nspirits, and very happy. I fancy Lord S. is very good-humoured and\r\npleasant in his own family, and I do not think him so very ill-looking\r\nas I did\xe2\x80\x94at least, one sees many worse. He will not do by the side of\r\nyour cousin Edmund. Of the last-mentioned hero, what shall I say? If I\r\navoided his name entirely, it would look suspicious. I will say, then,\r\nthat we have seen him two or three times, and that my friends here are\r\nvery much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance. Mrs. Fraser (no bad\r\njudge) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a\r\nperson, height, and air; and I must confess, when he dined here the\r\nother day, there were none to compare with him, and we were a party of\r\nsixteen. Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell\r\ntales, but\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94but Yours affectionately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had almost forgot (it was Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s fault: he gets into my head more\r\nthan does me good) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire. My dear\r\nlittle creature, do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks.\r\nThose vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty and health. My poor aunt\r\nalways felt affected if within ten miles of the sea, which the Admiral\r\nof course never believed, but I know it was so. I am at your service\r\nand Henry\xe2\x80\x99s, at an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice. I should like the scheme, and we\r\nwould make a little circuit, and shew you Everingham in our way, and\r\nperhaps you would not mind passing through London, and seeing the\r\ninside of St. George\xe2\x80\x99s, Hanover Square. Only keep your cousin Edmund\r\nfrom me at such a time: I should not like to be tempted. What a long\r\nletter! one word more. Henry, I find, has some idea of going into\r\nNorfolk again upon some business that _you_ approve; but this cannot\r\npossibly be permitted before the middle of next week; that is, he\r\ncannot anyhow be spared till after the 14th, for _we_ have a party that\r\nevening. The value of a man like Henry, on such an occasion, is what\r\nyou can have no conception of; so you must take it upon my word to be\r\ninestimable. He will see the Rushworths, which I own I am not sorry\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94having a little curiosity, and so I think has he\xe2\x80\x94though he will not\r\nacknowledge it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a letter to be run through eagerly, to be read deliberately,\r\nto supply matter for much reflection, and to leave everything in\r\ngreater suspense than ever. The only certainty to be drawn from it was,\r\nthat nothing decisive had yet taken place. Edmund had not yet spoken.\r\nHow Miss Crawford really felt, how she meant to act, or might act\r\nwithout or against her meaning; whether his importance to her were\r\nquite what it had been before the last separation; whether, if\r\nlessened, it were likely to lessen more, or to recover itself, were\r\nsubjects for endless conjecture, and to be thought of on that day and\r\nmany days to come, without producing any conclusion. The idea that\r\nreturned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford, after proving herself\r\ncooled and staggered by a return to London habits, would yet prove\r\nherself in the end too much attached to him to give him up. She would\r\ntry to be more ambitious than her heart would allow. She would\r\nhesitate, she would tease, she would condition, she would require a\r\ngreat deal, but she would finally accept.\r\n\r\nThis was Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s most frequent expectation. A house in town\xe2\x80\x94that, she\r\nthought, must be impossible. Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawford\r\nmight not ask. The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse. The\r\nwoman who could speak of him, and speak only of his appearance! What an\r\nunworthy attachment! To be deriving support from the commendations of\r\nMrs. Fraser! _She_ who had known him intimately half a year! Fanny was\r\nashamed of her. Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr.\r\nCrawford and herself, touched her, in comparison, slightly. Whether Mr.\r\nCrawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no\r\nconcern of hers, though, everything considered, she thought he _would_\r\ngo without delay. That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a\r\nmeeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line of\r\nconduct, and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she hoped _he_ would\r\nnot be actuated by any such degrading curiosity. He acknowledged no\r\nsuch inducement, and his sister ought to have given him credit for\r\nbetter feelings than her own.\r\n\r\nShe was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving\r\nthis than she had been before; and for a few days was so unsettled by\r\nit altogether, by what had come, and what might come, that her usual\r\nreadings and conversation with Susan were much suspended. She could not\r\ncommand her attention as she wished. If Mr. Crawford remembered her\r\nmessage to her cousin, she thought it very likely, most likely, that he\r\nwould write to her at all events; it would be most consistent with his\r\nusual kindness; and till she got rid of this idea, till it gradually\r\nwore off, by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days\r\nmore, she was in a most restless, anxious state.\r\n\r\nAt length, a something like composure succeeded. Suspense must be\r\nsubmitted to, and must not be allowed to wear her out, and make her\r\nuseless. Time did something, her own exertions something more, and she\r\nresumed her attentions to Susan, and again awakened the same interest\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nSusan was growing very fond of her, and though without any of the early\r\ndelight in books which had been so strong in Fanny, with a disposition\r\nmuch less inclined to sedentary pursuits, or to information for\r\ninformation\xe2\x80\x99s sake, she had so strong a desire of not _appearing_\r\nignorant, as, with a good clear understanding, made her a most\r\nattentive, profitable, thankful pupil. Fanny was her oracle. Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexplanations and remarks were a most important addition to every essay,\r\nor every chapter of history. What Fanny told her of former times dwelt\r\nmore on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith; and she paid her sister\r\nthe compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author.\r\nThe early habit of reading was wanting.\r\n\r\nTheir conversations, however, were not always on subjects so high as\r\nhistory or morals. Others had their hour; and of lesser matters, none\r\nreturned so often, or remained so long between them, as Mansfield Park,\r\na description of the people, the manners, the amusements, the ways of\r\nMansfield Park. Susan, who had an innate taste for the genteel and\r\nwell-appointed, was eager to hear, and Fanny could not but indulge\r\nherself in dwelling on so beloved a theme. She hoped it was not wrong;\r\nthough, after a time, Susan\xe2\x80\x99s very great admiration of everything said\r\nor done in her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house, and earnest longing to go into\r\nNorthamptonshire, seemed almost to blame her for exciting feelings\r\nwhich could not be gratified.\r\n\r\nPoor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder\r\nsister; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this, she began to\r\nfeel that when her own release from Portsmouth came, her happiness\r\nwould have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind. That a girl so\r\ncapable of being made everything good should be left in such hands,\r\ndistressed her more and more. Were _she_ likely to have a home to\r\ninvite her to, what a blessing it would be! And had it been possible\r\nfor her to return Mr. Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s regard, the probability of his being\r\nvery far from objecting to such a measure would have been the greatest\r\nincrease of all her own comforts. She thought he was really\r\ngood-tempered, and could fancy his entering into a plan of that sort\r\nmost pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven weeks of the two months were very nearly gone, when the one\r\nletter, the letter from Edmund, so long expected, was put into Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. As she opened, and saw its length, she prepared herself for a\r\nminute detail of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towards\r\nthe fortunate creature who was now mistress of his fate. These were the\r\ncontents\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Dear Fanny,\xe2\x80\x94Excuse me that I have not written before. Crawford told\r\nme that you were wishing to hear from me, but I found it impossible to\r\nwrite from London, and persuaded myself that you would understand my\r\nsilence. Could I have sent a few happy lines, they should not have been\r\nwanting, but nothing of that nature was ever in my power. I am returned\r\nto Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it. My hopes are\r\nmuch weaker. You are probably aware of this already. So very fond of\r\nyou as Miss Crawford is, it is most natural that she should tell you\r\nenough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine. I will\r\nnot be prevented, however, from making my own communication. Our\r\nconfidences in you need not clash. I ask no questions. There is\r\nsomething soothing in the idea that we have the same friend, and that\r\nwhatever unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us, we are\r\nunited in our love of you. It will be a comfort to me to tell you how\r\nthings now are, and what are my present plans, if plans I can be said\r\nto have. I have been returned since Saturday. I was three weeks in\r\nLondon, and saw her (for London) very often. I had every attention from\r\nthe Frasers that could be reasonably expected. I dare say I was not\r\nreasonable in carrying with me hopes of an intercourse at all like that\r\nof Mansfield. It was her manner, however, rather than any unfrequency\r\nof meeting. Had she been different when I did see her, I should have\r\nmade no complaint, but from the very first she was altered: my first\r\nreception was so unlike what I had hoped, that I had almost resolved on\r\nleaving London again directly. I need not particularise. You know the\r\nweak side of her character, and may imagine the sentiments and\r\nexpressions which were torturing me. She was in high spirits, and\r\nsurrounded by those who were giving all the support of their own bad\r\nsense to her too lively mind. I do not like Mrs. Fraser. She is a\r\ncold-hearted, vain woman, who has married entirely from convenience,\r\nand though evidently unhappy in her marriage, places her disappointment\r\nnot to faults of judgment, or temper, or disproportion of age, but to\r\nher being, after all, less affluent than many of her acquaintance,\r\nespecially than her sister, Lady Stornaway, and is the determined\r\nsupporter of everything mercenary and ambitious, provided it be only\r\nmercenary and ambitious enough. I look upon her intimacy with those two\r\nsisters as the greatest misfortune of her life and mine. They have been\r\nleading her astray for years. Could she be detached from them!\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsometimes I do not despair of it, for the affection appears to me\r\nprincipally on their side. They are very fond of her; but I am sure she\r\ndoes not love them as she loves you. When I think of her great\r\nattachment to you, indeed, and the whole of her judicious, upright\r\nconduct as a sister, she appears a very different creature, capable of\r\neverything noble, and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh\r\nconstruction of a playful manner. I cannot give her up, Fanny. She is\r\nthe only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife. If I\r\ndid not believe that she had some regard for me, of course I should not\r\nsay this, but I do believe it. I am convinced that she is not without a\r\ndecided preference. I have no jealousy of any individual. It is the\r\ninfluence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of. It\r\nis the habits of wealth that I fear. Her ideas are not higher than her\r\nown fortune may warrant, but they are beyond what our incomes united\r\ncould authorise. There is comfort, however, even here. I could better\r\nbear to lose her because not rich enough, than because of my\r\nprofession. That would only prove her affection not equal to\r\nsacrifices, which, in fact, I am scarcely justified in asking; and, if\r\nI am refused, that, I think, will be the honest motive. Her prejudices,\r\nI trust, are not so strong as they were. You have my thoughts exactly\r\nas they arise, my dear Fanny; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory,\r\nbut it will not be a less faithful picture of my mind. Having once\r\nbegun, it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel. I cannot give her\r\nup. Connected as we already are, and, I hope, are to be, to give up\r\nMary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most\r\ndear to me; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom,\r\nunder any other distress, I should turn to for consolation. The loss of\r\nMary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of\r\nFanny. Were it a decided thing, an actual refusal, I hope I should know\r\nhow to bear it, and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart,\r\nand in the course of a few years\xe2\x80\x94but I am writing nonsense. Were I\r\nrefused, I must bear it; and till I am, I can never cease to try for\r\nher. This is the truth. The only question is _how_? What may be the\r\nlikeliest means? I have sometimes thought of going to London again\r\nafter Easter, and sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she returns\r\nto Mansfield. Even now, she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield\r\nin June; but June is at a great distance, and I believe I shall write\r\nto her. I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter. To be\r\nat an early certainty is a material object. My present state is\r\nmiserably irksome. Considering everything, I think a letter will be\r\ndecidedly the best method of explanation. I shall be able to write much\r\nthat I could not say, and shall be giving her time for reflection\r\nbefore she resolves on her answer, and I am less afraid of the result\r\nof reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse; I think I am. My\r\ngreatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser, and I at a\r\ndistance unable to help my own cause. A letter exposes to all the evil\r\nof consultation, and where the mind is anything short of perfect\r\ndecision, an adviser may, in an unlucky moment, lead it to do what it\r\nmay afterwards regret. I must think this matter over a little. This\r\nlong letter, full of my own concerns alone, will be enough to tire even\r\nthe friendship of a Fanny. The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs.\r\nFraser\xe2\x80\x99s party. I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and\r\nhear of him. There is not a shadow of wavering. He thoroughly knows his\r\nown mind, and acts up to his resolutions: an inestimable quality. I\r\ncould not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without\r\nrecollecting what you once told me, and I acknowledge that they did not\r\nmeet as friends. There was marked coolness on her side. They scarcely\r\nspoke. I saw him draw back surprised, and I was sorry that Mrs.\r\nRushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram. You\r\nwill wish to hear my opinion of Maria\xe2\x80\x99s degree of comfort as a wife.\r\nThere is no appearance of unhappiness. I hope they get on pretty well\r\ntogether. I dined twice in Wimpole Street, and might have been there\r\noftener, but it is mortifying to be with Rushworth as a brother. Julia\r\nseems to enjoy London exceedingly. I had little enjoyment there, but\r\nhave less here. We are not a lively party. You are very much wanted. I\r\nmiss you more than I can express. My mother desires her best love, and\r\nhopes to hear from you soon. She talks of you almost every hour, and I\r\nam sorry to find how many weeks more she is likely to be without you.\r\nMy father means to fetch you himself, but it will not be till after\r\nEaster, when he has business in town. You are happy at Portsmouth, I\r\nhope, but this must not be a yearly visit. I want you at home, that I\r\nmay have your opinion about Thornton Lacey. I have little heart for\r\nextensive improvements till I know that it will ever have a mistress. I\r\nthink I shall certainly write. It is quite settled that the Grants go\r\nto Bath; they leave Mansfield on Monday. I am glad of it. I am not\r\ncomfortable enough to be fit for anybody; but your aunt seems to feel\r\nout of luck that such an article of Mansfield news should fall to my\r\npen instead of hers.\xe2\x80\x94Yours ever, my dearest Fanny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never will, no, I certainly never will wish for a letter again,\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s secret declaration as she finished this. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they bring\r\nbut disappointment and sorrow? Not till after Easter! How shall I bear\r\nit? And my poor aunt talking of me every hour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she could, but\r\nshe was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was\r\nquite unkind, both to her aunt and to herself. As for the main subject\r\nof the letter, there was nothing in that to soothe irritation. She was\r\nalmost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no\r\ngood in this delay,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is not it settled? He is blinded,\r\nand nothing will open his eyes; nothing can, after having had truths\r\nbefore him so long in vain. He will marry her, and be poor and\r\nmiserable. God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be\r\nrespectable!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked over the letter again. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98So very fond of me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tis nonsense all. She loves nobody but herself and her brother. Her\r\nfriends leading her astray for years! She is quite as likely to have\r\nled _them_ astray. They have all, perhaps, been corrupting one another;\r\nbut if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them, she is the\r\nless likely to have been hurt, except by their flattery. \xe2\x80\x98The only\r\nwoman in the world whom he could ever think of as a wife.\xe2\x80\x99 I firmly\r\nbelieve it. It is an attachment to govern his whole life. Accepted or\r\nrefused, his heart is wedded to her for ever. \xe2\x80\x98The loss of Mary I must\r\nconsider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny.\xe2\x80\x99 Edmund, you\r\ndo not know me. The families would never be connected if you did not\r\nconnect them! Oh! write, write. Finish it at once. Let there be an end\r\nof this suspense. Fix, commit, condemn yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch sensations, however, were too near akin to resentment to be long\r\nguiding Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s soliloquies. She was soon more softened and sorrowful.\r\nHis warm regard, his kind expressions, his confidential treatment,\r\ntouched her strongly. He was only too good to everybody. It was a\r\nletter, in short, which she would not but have had for the world, and\r\nwhich could never be valued enough. This was the end of it.\r\n\r\nEverybody at all addicted to letter-writing, without having much to\r\nsay, which will include a large proportion of the female world at\r\nleast, must feel with Lady Bertram that she was out of luck in having\r\nsuch a capital piece of Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants\r\ngoing to Bath, occur at a time when she could make no advantage of it,\r\nand will admit that it must have been very mortifying to her to see it\r\nfall to the share of her thankless son, and treated as concisely as\r\npossible at the end of a long letter, instead of having it to spread\r\nover the largest part of a page of her own. For though Lady Bertram\r\nrather shone in the epistolary line, having early in her marriage, from\r\nthe want of other employment, and the circumstance of Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeing in Parliament, got into the way of making and keeping\r\ncorrespondents, and formed for herself a very creditable, common-place,\r\namplifying style, so that a very little matter was enough for her: she\r\ncould not do entirely without any; she must have something to write\r\nabout, even to her niece; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of\r\nDr. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s morning calls, it was very\r\nhard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she\r\ncould put them to.\r\n\r\nThere was a rich amends, however, preparing for her. Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhour of good luck came. Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, Fanny had one from her aunt, beginning thus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Dear Fanny,\xe2\x80\x94I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming\r\nintelligence, which I make no doubt will give you much concern\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nThis was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen to\r\nacquaint her with all the particulars of the Grants\xe2\x80\x99 intended journey,\r\nfor the present intelligence was of a nature to promise occupation for\r\nthe pen for many days to come, being no less than the dangerous illness\r\nof her eldest son, of which they had received notice by express a few\r\nhours before.\r\n\r\nTom had gone from London with a party of young men to Newmarket, where\r\na neglected fall and a good deal of drinking had brought on a fever;\r\nand when the party broke up, being unable to move, had been left by\r\nhimself at the house of one of these young men to the comforts of\r\nsickness and solitude, and the attendance only of servants. Instead of\r\nbeing soon well enough to follow his friends, as he had then hoped, his\r\ndisorder increased considerably, and it was not long before he thought\r\nso ill of himself as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter\r\ndespatched to Mansfield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis distressing intelligence, as you may suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d observed her\r\nladyship, after giving the substance of it, \xe2\x80\x9chas agitated us\r\nexceedingly, and we cannot prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed\r\nand apprehensive for the poor invalid, whose state Sir Thomas fears may\r\nbe very critical; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother\r\nimmediately, but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on\r\nthis distressing occasion, as it would be too trying for me. We shall\r\ngreatly miss Edmund in our small circle, but I trust and hope he will\r\nfind the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be\r\napprehended, and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield\r\nshortly, which Sir Thomas proposes should be done, and thinks best on\r\nevery account, and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able\r\nto bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury. As I have\r\nlittle doubt of your feeling for us, my dear Fanny, under these\r\ndistressing circumstances, I will write again very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s feelings on the occasion were indeed considerably more warm and\r\ngenuine than her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s style of writing. She felt truly for them all.\r\nTom dangerously ill, Edmund gone to attend him, and the sadly small\r\nparty remaining at Mansfield, were cares to shut out every other care,\r\nor almost every other. She could just find selfishness enough to wonder\r\nwhether Edmund _had_ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came,\r\nbut no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate\r\nand disinterestedly anxious. Her aunt did not neglect her: she wrote\r\nagain and again; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund, and\r\nthese accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny, in the same\r\ndiffuse style, and the same medley of trusts, hopes, and fears, all\r\nfollowing and producing each other at haphazard. It was a sort of\r\nplaying at being frightened. The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not\r\nsee had little power over her fancy; and she wrote very comfortably\r\nabout agitation, and anxiety, and poor invalids, till Tom was actually\r\nconveyed to Mansfield, and her own eyes had beheld his altered\r\nappearance. Then a letter which she had been previously preparing for\r\nFanny was finished in a different style, in the language of real\r\nfeeling and alarm; then she wrote as she might have spoken. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is just\r\ncome, my dear Fanny, and is taken upstairs; and I am so shocked to see\r\nhim, that I do not know what to do. I am sure he has been very ill.\r\nPoor Tom! I am quite grieved for him, and very much frightened, and so\r\nis Sir Thomas; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me.\r\nBut Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to-morrow, and says we must\r\nconsider his journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom was not soon\r\nover. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s extreme impatience to be removed to Mansfield, and\r\nexperience those comforts of home and family which had been little\r\nthought of in uninterrupted health, had probably induced his being\r\nconveyed thither too early, as a return of fever came on, and for a\r\nweek he was in a more alarming state than ever. They were all very\r\nseriously frightened. Lady Bertram wrote her daily terrors to her\r\nniece, who might now be said to live upon letters, and pass all her\r\ntime between suffering from that of to-day and looking forward to\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s. Without any particular affection for her eldest cousin,\r\nher tenderness of heart made her feel that she could not spare him, and\r\nthe purity of her principles added yet a keener solicitude, when she\r\nconsidered how little useful, how little self-denying his life had\r\n(apparently) been.\r\n\r\nSusan was her only companion and listener on this, as on more common\r\noccasions. Susan was always ready to hear and to sympathise. Nobody\r\nelse could be interested in so remote an evil as illness in a family\r\nabove an hundred miles off; not even Mrs. Price, beyond a brief\r\nquestion or two, if she saw her daughter with a letter in her hand, and\r\nnow and then the quiet observation of, \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor sister Bertram must be\r\nin a great deal of trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo long divided and so differently situated, the ties of blood were\r\nlittle more than nothing. An attachment, originally as tranquil as\r\ntheir tempers, was now become a mere name. Mrs. Price did quite as much\r\nfor Lady Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price. Three\r\nor four Prices might have been swept away, any or all except Fanny and\r\nWilliam, and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it; or\r\nperhaps might have caught from Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s lips the cant of its being\r\na very happy thing and a great blessing to their poor dear sister Price\r\nto have them so well provided for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about the week\xe2\x80\x99s end from his return to Mansfield, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s immediate\r\ndanger was over, and he was so far pronounced safe as to make his\r\nmother perfectly easy; for being now used to the sight of him in his\r\nsuffering, helpless state, and hearing only the best, and never\r\nthinking beyond what she heard, with no disposition for alarm and no\r\naptitude at a hint, Lady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world\r\nfor a little medical imposition. The fever was subdued; the fever had\r\nbeen his complaint; of course he would soon be well again. Lady Bertram\r\ncould think nothing less, and Fanny shared her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s security, till\r\nshe received a few lines from Edmund, written purposely to give her a\r\nclearer idea of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s situation, and acquaint her with the\r\napprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician\r\nwith respect to some strong hectic symptoms, which seemed to seize the\r\nframe on the departure of the fever. They judged it best that Lady\r\nBertram should not be harassed by alarms which, it was to be hoped,\r\nwould prove unfounded; but there was no reason why Fanny should not\r\nknow the truth. They were apprehensive for his lungs.\r\n\r\nA very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom in\r\na juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s sheets of paper\r\ncould do. There was hardly any one in the house who might not have\r\ndescribed, from personal observation, better than herself; not one who\r\nwas not more useful at times to her son. She could do nothing but glide\r\nin quietly and look at him; but when able to talk or be talked to, or\r\nread to, Edmund was the companion he preferred. His aunt worried him by\r\nher cares, and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his conversation\r\nor his voice to the level of irritation and feebleness. Edmund was all\r\nin all. Fanny would certainly believe him so at least, and must find\r\nthat her estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as the\r\nattendant, supporter, cheerer of a suffering brother. There was not\r\nonly the debility of recent illness to assist: there was also, as she\r\nnow learnt, nerves much affected, spirits much depressed to calm and\r\nraise, and her own imagination added that there must be a mind to be\r\nproperly guided.\r\n\r\nThe family were not consumptive, and she was more inclined to hope than\r\nfear for her cousin, except when she thought of Miss Crawford; but Miss\r\nCrawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck, and to her\r\nselfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only\r\nson.\r\n\r\nEven in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten. Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter had this postscript. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the subject of my last, I had actually\r\nbegun a letter when called away by Tom\xe2\x80\x99s illness, but I have now\r\nchanged my mind, and fear to trust the influence of friends. When Tom\r\nis better, I shall go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of Mansfield, and so it continued, with scarcely any\r\nchange, till Easter. A line occasionally added by Edmund to his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s letter was enough for Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s information. Tom\xe2\x80\x99s amendment was\r\nalarmingly slow.\r\n\r\nEaster came particularly late this year, as Fanny had most sorrowfully\r\nconsidered, on first learning that she had no chance of leaving\r\nPortsmouth till after it. It came, and she had yet heard nothing of her\r\nreturn\xe2\x80\x94nothing even of the going to London, which was to precede her\r\nreturn. Her aunt often expressed a wish for her, but there was no\r\nnotice, no message from the uncle on whom all depended. She supposed he\r\ncould not yet leave his son, but it was a cruel, a terrible delay to\r\nher. The end of April was coming on; it would soon be almost three\r\nmonths, instead of two, that she had been absent from them all, and\r\nthat her days had been passing in a state of penance, which she loved\r\nthem too well to hope they would thoroughly understand; and who could\r\nyet say when there might be leisure to think of or fetch her?\r\n\r\nHer eagerness, her impatience, her longings to be with them, were such\r\nas to bring a line or two of Cowper\xe2\x80\x99s Tirocinium for ever before her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith what intense desire she wants her home,\xe2\x80\x9d was continually on her\r\ntongue, as the truest description of a yearning which she could not\r\nsuppose any schoolboy\xe2\x80\x99s bosom to feel more keenly.\r\n\r\nWhen she had been coming to Portsmouth, she had loved to call it her\r\nhome, had been fond of saying that she was going home; the word had\r\nbeen very dear to her, and so it still was, but it must be applied to\r\nMansfield. _That_ was now the home. Portsmouth was Portsmouth;\r\nMansfield was home. They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of\r\nher secret meditations, and nothing was more consolatory to her than to\r\nfind her aunt using the same language: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot but say I much regret\r\nyour being from home at this distressing time, so very trying to my\r\nspirits. I trust and hope, and sincerely wish you may never be absent\r\nfrom home so long again,\xe2\x80\x9d were most delightful sentences to her. Still,\r\nhowever, it was her private regale. Delicacy to her parents made her\r\ncareful not to betray such a preference of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house. It was\r\nalways: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I go back into Northamptonshire, or when I return to\r\nMansfield, I shall do so and so.\xe2\x80\x9d For a great while it was so, but at\r\nlast the longing grew stronger, it overthrew caution, and she found\r\nherself talking of what she should do when she went home before she was\r\naware. She reproached herself, coloured, and looked fearfully towards\r\nher father and mother. She need not have been uneasy. There was no sign\r\nof displeasure, or even of hearing her. They were perfectly free from\r\nany jealousy of Mansfield. She was as welcome to wish herself there as\r\nto be there.\r\n\r\nIt was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring. She had not\r\nknown before what pleasures she _had_ to lose in passing March and\r\nApril in a town. She had not known before how much the beginnings and\r\nprogress of vegetation had delighted her. What animation, both of body\r\nand mind, she had derived from watching the advance of that season\r\nwhich cannot, in spite of its capriciousness, be unlovely, and seeing\r\nits increasing beauties from the earliest flowers in the warmest\r\ndivisions of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s garden, to the opening of leaves of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplantations, and the glory of his woods. To be losing such pleasures\r\nwas no trifle; to be losing them, because she was in the midst of\r\ncloseness and noise, to have confinement, bad air, bad smells,\r\nsubstituted for liberty, freshness, fragrance, and verdure, was\r\ninfinitely worse: but even these incitements to regret were feeble,\r\ncompared with what arose from the conviction of being missed by her\r\nbest friends, and the longing to be useful to those who were wanting\r\nher!\r\n\r\nCould she have been at home, she might have been of service to every\r\ncreature in the house. She felt that she must have been of use to all.\r\nTo all she must have saved some trouble of head or hand; and were it\r\nonly in supporting the spirits of her aunt Bertram, keeping her from\r\nthe evil of solitude, or the still greater evil of a restless,\r\nofficious companion, too apt to be heightening danger in order to\r\nenhance her own importance, her being there would have been a general\r\ngood. She loved to fancy how she could have read to her aunt, how she\r\ncould have talked to her, and tried at once to make her feel the\r\nblessing of what was, and prepare her mind for what might be; and how\r\nmany walks up and down stairs she might have saved her, and how many\r\nmessages she might have carried.\r\n\r\nIt astonished her that Tom\xe2\x80\x99s sisters could be satisfied with remaining\r\nin London at such a time, through an illness which had now, under\r\ndifferent degrees of danger, lasted several weeks. _They_ might return\r\nto Mansfield when they chose; travelling could be no difficulty to\r\n_them_, and she could not comprehend how both could still keep away. If\r\nMrs. Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations, Julia was\r\ncertainly able to quit London whenever she chose. It appeared from one\r\nof her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s letters that Julia had offered to return if wanted, but\r\nthis was all. It was evident that she would rather remain where she\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nFanny was disposed to think the influence of London very much at war\r\nwith all respectable attachments. She saw the proof of it in Miss\r\nCrawford, as well as in her cousins; _her_ attachment to Edmund had\r\nbeen respectable, the most respectable part of her character; her\r\nfriendship for herself had at least been blameless. Where was either\r\nsentiment now? It was so long since Fanny had had any letter from her,\r\nthat she had some reason to think lightly of the friendship which had\r\nbeen so dwelt on. It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss\r\nCrawford or of her other connexions in town, except through Mansfield,\r\nand she was beginning to suppose that she might never know whether Mr.\r\nCrawford had gone into Norfolk again or not till they met, and might\r\nnever hear from his sister any more this spring, when the following\r\nletter was received to revive old and create some new sensations\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, my dear Fanny, as soon as you can, for my long silence,\r\nand behave as if you could forgive me directly. This is my modest\r\nrequest and expectation, for you are so good, that I depend upon being\r\ntreated better than I deserve, and I write now to beg an immediate\r\nanswer. I want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park, and you,\r\nno doubt, are perfectly able to give it. One should be a brute not to\r\nfeel for the distress they are in; and from what I hear, poor Mr.\r\nBertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery. I thought little of his\r\nillness at first. I looked upon him as the sort of person to be made a\r\nfuss with, and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder, and was\r\nchiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him; but now it is\r\nconfidently asserted that he is really in a decline, that the symptoms\r\nare most alarming, and that part of the family, at least, are aware of\r\nit. If it be so, I am sure you must be included in that part, that\r\ndiscerning part, and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I\r\nhave been rightly informed. I need not say how rejoiced I shall be to\r\nhear there has been any mistake, but the report is so prevalent that I\r\nconfess I cannot help trembling. To have such a fine young man cut off\r\nin the flower of his days is most melancholy. Poor Sir Thomas will feel\r\nit dreadfully. I really am quite agitated on the subject. Fanny, Fanny,\r\nI see you smile and look cunning, but, upon my honour, I never bribed a\r\nphysician in my life. Poor young man! If he is to die, there will be\r\n_two_ poor young men less in the world; and with a fearless face and\r\nbold voice would I say to any one, that wealth and consequence could\r\nfall into no hands more deserving of them. It was a foolish\r\nprecipitation last Christmas, but the evil of a few days may be blotted\r\nout in part. Varnish and gilding hide many stains. It will be but the\r\nloss of the Esquire after his name. With real affection, Fanny, like\r\nmine, more might be overlooked. Write to me by return of post, judge of\r\nmy anxiety, and do not trifle with it. Tell me the real truth, as you\r\nhave it from the fountainhead. And now, do not trouble yourself to be\r\nashamed of either my feelings or your own. Believe me, they are not\r\nonly natural, they are philanthropic and virtuous. I put it to your\r\nconscience, whether \xe2\x80\x98Sir Edmund\xe2\x80\x99 would not do more good with all the\r\nBertram property than any other possible \xe2\x80\x98Sir.\xe2\x80\x99 Had the Grants been at\r\nhome I would not have troubled you, but you are now the only one I can\r\napply to for the truth, his sisters not being within my reach. Mrs. R.\r\nhas been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham (as to be\r\nsure you know), and is not yet returned; and Julia is with the cousins\r\nwho live near Bedford Square, but I forget their name and street. Could\r\nI immediately apply to either, however, I should still prefer you,\r\nbecause it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to\r\nhave their own amusements cut up, as to shut their eyes to the truth. I\r\nsuppose Mrs. R.\xe2\x80\x99s Easter holidays will not last much longer; no doubt\r\nthey are thorough holidays to her. The Aylmers are pleasant people; and\r\nher husband away, she can have nothing but enjoyment. I give her credit\r\nfor promoting his going dutifully down to Bath, to fetch his mother;\r\nbut how will she and the dowager agree in one house? Henry is not at\r\nhand, so I have nothing to say from him. Do not you think Edmund would\r\nhave been in town again long ago, but for this illness?\xe2\x80\x94Yours ever,\r\nMary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in, but he\r\nbrings no intelligence to prevent my sending it. Mrs. R. knows a\r\ndecline is apprehended; he saw her this morning: she returns to Wimpole\r\nStreet to-day; the old lady is come. Now do not make yourself uneasy\r\nwith any queer fancies because he has been spending a few days at\r\nRichmond. He does it every spring. Be assured he cares for nobody but\r\nyou. At this very moment he is wild to see you, and occupied only in\r\ncontriving the means for doing so, and for making his pleasure conduce\r\nto yours. In proof, he repeats, and more eagerly, what he said at\r\nPortsmouth about our conveying you home, and I join him in it with all\r\nmy soul. Dear Fanny, write directly, and tell us to come. It will do us\r\nall good. He and I can go to the Parsonage, you know, and be no trouble\r\nto our friends at Mansfield Park. It would really be gratifying to see\r\nthem all again, and a little addition of society might be of infinite\r\nuse to them; and as to yourself, you must feel yourself to be so wanted\r\nthere, that you cannot in conscience\xe2\x80\x94conscientious as you are\xe2\x80\x94keep\r\naway, when you have the means of returning. I have not time or patience\r\nto give half Henry\xe2\x80\x99s messages; be satisfied that the spirit of each and\r\nevery one is unalterable affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s disgust at the greater part of this letter, with her extreme\r\nreluctance to bring the writer of it and her cousin Edmund together,\r\nwould have made her (as she felt) incapable of judging impartially\r\nwhether the concluding offer might be accepted or not. To herself,\r\nindividually, it was most tempting. To be finding herself, perhaps\r\nwithin three days, transported to Mansfield, was an image of the\r\ngreatest felicity, but it would have been a material drawback to be\r\nowing such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct, at the\r\npresent moment, she saw so much to condemn: the sister\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, the\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, _her_ cold-hearted ambition, _his_ thoughtless\r\nvanity. To have him still the acquaintance, the flirt perhaps, of Mrs.\r\nRushworth! She was mortified. She had thought better of him. Happily,\r\nhowever, she was not left to weigh and decide between opposite\r\ninclinations and doubtful notions of right; there was no occasion to\r\ndetermine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not. She\r\nhad a rule to apply to, which settled everything. Her awe of her uncle,\r\nand her dread of taking a liberty with him, made it instantly plain to\r\nher what she had to do. She must absolutely decline the proposal. If he\r\nwanted, he would send for her; and even to offer an early return was a\r\npresumption which hardly anything would have seemed to justify. She\r\nthanked Miss Crawford, but gave a decided negative. \xe2\x80\x9cHer uncle, she\r\nunderstood, meant to fetch her; and as her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s illness had\r\ncontinued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary, she\r\nmust suppose her return would be unwelcome at present, and that she\r\nshould be felt an encumbrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer representation of her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s state at this time was exactly\r\naccording to her own belief of it, and such as she supposed would\r\nconvey to the sanguine mind of her correspondent the hope of everything\r\nshe was wishing for. Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman, it\r\nseemed, under certain conditions of wealth; and this, she suspected,\r\nwas all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate\r\nhimself upon. She had only learnt to think nothing of consequence but\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Fanny could not doubt that her answer was conveying a real\r\ndisappointment, she was rather in expectation, from her knowledge of\r\nMiss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s temper, of being urged again; and though no second\r\nletter arrived for the space of a week, she had still the same feeling\r\nwhen it did come.\r\n\r\nOn receiving it, she could instantly decide on its containing little\r\nwriting, and was persuaded of its having the air of a letter of haste\r\nand business. Its object was unquestionable; and two moments were\r\nenough to start the probability of its being merely to give her notice\r\nthat they should be in Portsmouth that very day, and to throw her into\r\nall the agitation of doubting what she ought to do in such a case. If\r\ntwo moments, however, can surround with difficulties, a third can\r\ndisperse them; and before she had opened the letter, the possibility of\r\nMr. and Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s having applied to her uncle and obtained his\r\npermission was giving her ease. This was the letter\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most scandalous, ill-natured rumour has just reached me, and I\r\nwrite, dear Fanny, to warn you against giving the least credit to it,\r\nshould it spread into the country. Depend upon it, there is some\r\nmistake, and that a day or two will clear it up; at any rate, that\r\nHenry is blameless, and in spite of a moment\xe2\x80\x99s _etourderie_, thinks of\r\nnobody but you. Say not a word of it; hear nothing, surmise nothing,\r\nwhisper nothing till I write again. I am sure it will be all hushed up,\r\nand nothing proved but Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s folly. If they are gone, I would lay\r\nmy life they are only gone to Mansfield Park, and Julia with them. But\r\nwhy would not you let us come for you? I wish you may not repent\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x94Yours, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny stood aghast. As no scandalous, ill-natured rumour had reached\r\nher, it was impossible for her to understand much of this strange\r\nletter. She could only perceive that it must relate to Wimpole Street\r\nand Mr. Crawford, and only conjecture that something very imprudent had\r\njust occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world, and to\r\nexcite her jealousy, in Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s apprehension, if she heard it.\r\nMiss Crawford need not be alarmed for her. She was only sorry for the\r\nparties concerned and for Mansfield, if the report should spread so\r\nfar; but she hoped it might not. If the Rushworths were gone themselves\r\nto Mansfield, as was to be inferred from what Miss Crawford said, it\r\nwas not likely that anything unpleasant should have preceded them, or\r\nat least should make any impression.\r\n\r\nAs to Mr. Crawford, she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own\r\ndisposition, convince him that he was not capable of being steadily\r\nattached to any one woman in the world, and shame him from persisting\r\nany longer in addressing herself.\r\n\r\nIt was very strange! She had begun to think he really loved her, and to\r\nfancy his affection for her something more than common; and his sister\r\nstill said that he cared for nobody else. Yet there must have been some\r\nmarked display of attentions to her cousin, there must have been some\r\nstrong indiscretion, since her correspondent was not of a sort to\r\nregard a slight one.\r\n\r\nVery uncomfortable she was, and must continue, till she heard from Miss\r\nCrawford again. It was impossible to banish the letter from her\r\nthoughts, and she could not relieve herself by speaking of it to any\r\nhuman being. Miss Crawford need not have urged secrecy with so much\r\nwarmth; she might have trusted to her sense of what was due to her\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\nThe next day came and brought no second letter. Fanny was disappointed.\r\nShe could still think of little else all the morning; but, when her\r\nfather came back in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual,\r\nshe was so far from expecting any elucidation through such a channel\r\nthat the subject was for a moment out of her head.\r\n\r\nShe was deep in other musing. The remembrance of her first evening in\r\nthat room, of her father and his newspaper, came across her. No candle\r\nwas now wanted. The sun was yet an hour and half above the horizon. She\r\nfelt that she had, indeed, been three months there; and the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays\r\nfalling strongly into the parlour, instead of cheering, made her still\r\nmore melancholy, for sunshine appeared to her a totally different thing\r\nin a town and in the country. Here, its power was only a glare: a\r\nstifling, sickly glare, serving but to bring forward stains and dirt\r\nthat might otherwise have slept. There was neither health nor gaiety in\r\nsunshine in a town. She sat in a blaze of oppressive heat, in a cloud\r\nof moving dust, and her eyes could only wander from the walls, marked\r\nby her father\xe2\x80\x99s head, to the table cut and notched by her brothers,\r\nwhere stood the tea-board never thoroughly cleaned, the cups and\r\nsaucers wiped in streaks, the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin\r\nblue, and the bread and butter growing every minute more greasy than\r\neven Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s hands had first produced it. Her father read his\r\nnewspaper, and her mother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual,\r\nwhile the tea was in preparation, and wished Rebecca would mend it; and\r\nFanny was first roused by his calling out to her, after humphing and\r\nconsidering over a particular paragraph: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the name of your great\r\ncousins in town, Fan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment\xe2\x80\x99s recollection enabled her to say, \xe2\x80\x9cRushworth, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t they live in Wimpole Street?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, there\xe2\x80\x99s the devil to pay among them, that\xe2\x80\x99s all! There\xe2\x80\x9d (holding\r\nout the paper to her); \xe2\x80\x9cmuch good may such fine relations do you. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters; he may be too\r\nmuch of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less.\r\nBut, by G\xe2\x80\x94! if she belonged to _me_, I\xe2\x80\x99d give her the rope\xe2\x80\x99s end as\r\nlong as I could stand over her. A little flogging for man and woman too\r\nwould be the best way of preventing such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFanny read to herself that \xe2\x80\x9cit was with infinite concern the newspaper\r\nhad to announce to the world a matrimonial _fracas_ in the family of\r\nMr. R. of Wimpole Street; the beautiful Mrs. R., whose name had not\r\nlong been enrolled in the lists of Hymen, and who had promised to\r\nbecome so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world, having quitted\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s roof in company with the well-known and captivating Mr.\r\nC., the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R., and it was not known\r\neven to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a mistake, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny instantly; \xe2\x80\x9cit must be a mistake, it\r\ncannot be true; it must mean some other people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame; she spoke with a\r\nresolution which sprung from despair, for she spoke what she did not,\r\ncould not believe herself. It had been the shock of conviction as she\r\nread. The truth rushed on her; and how she could have spoken at all,\r\nhow she could even have breathed, was afterwards matter of wonder to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nMr. Price cared too little about the report to make her much answer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be all a lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he acknowledged; \xe2\x80\x9cbut so many fine ladies were\r\ngoing to the devil nowadays that way, that there was no answering for\r\nanybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I hope it is not true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Price plaintively; \xe2\x80\x9cit would\r\nbe so very shocking! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that\r\ncarpet, I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times; have not I,\r\nBetsey? And it would not be ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horror of a mind like Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s, as it received the conviction of\r\nsuch guilt, and began to take in some part of the misery that must\r\nensue, can hardly be described. At first, it was a sort of\r\nstupefaction; but every moment was quickening her perception of the\r\nhorrible evil. She could not doubt, she dared not indulge a hope, of\r\nthe paragraph being false. Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s letter, which she had read\r\nso often as to make every line her own, was in frightful conformity\r\nwith it. Her eager defence of her brother, her hope of its being\r\n_hushed_ _up_, her evident agitation, were all of a piece with\r\nsomething very bad; and if there was a woman of character in existence,\r\nwho could treat as a trifle this sin of the first magnitude, who would\r\ntry to gloss it over, and desire to have it unpunished, she could\r\nbelieve Miss Crawford to be the woman! Now she could see her own\r\nmistake as to _who_ were gone, or _said_ to be gone. It was not Mr. and\r\nMrs. Rushworth; it was Mrs. Rushworth and Mr. Crawford.\r\n\r\nFanny seemed to herself never to have been shocked before. There was no\r\npossibility of rest. The evening passed without a pause of misery, the\r\nnight was totally sleepless. She passed only from feelings of sickness\r\nto shudderings of horror; and from hot fits of fever to cold. The event\r\nwas so shocking, that there were moments even when her heart revolted\r\nfrom it as impossible: when she thought it could not be. A woman\r\nmarried only six months ago; a man professing himself devoted, even\r\n_engaged_ to another; that other her near relation; the whole family,\r\nboth families connected as they were by tie upon tie; all friends, all\r\nintimate together! It was too horrible a confusion of guilt, too gross\r\na complication of evil, for human nature, not in a state of utter\r\nbarbarism, to be capable of! yet her judgment told her it was so. _His_\r\nunsettled affections, wavering with his vanity, _Maria\xe2\x80\x99s_ decided\r\nattachment, and no sufficient principle on either side, gave it\r\npossibility: Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s letter stampt it a fact.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the consequence? Whom would it not injure? Whose views\r\nmight it not affect? Whose peace would it not cut up for ever? Miss\r\nCrawford, herself, Edmund; but it was dangerous, perhaps, to tread such\r\nground. She confined herself, or tried to confine herself, to the\r\nsimple, indubitable family misery which must envelop all, if it were\r\nindeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure. The mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsufferings, the father\xe2\x80\x99s; there she paused. Julia\xe2\x80\x99s, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s, Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nthere a yet longer pause. They were the two on whom it would fall most\r\nhorribly. Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s parental solicitude and high sense of honour and\r\ndecorum, Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s upright principles, unsuspicious temper, and genuine\r\nstrength of feeling, made her think it scarcely possible for them to\r\nsupport life and reason under such disgrace; and it appeared to her\r\nthat, as far as this world alone was concerned, the greatest blessing\r\nto every one of kindred with Mrs. Rushworth would be instant\r\nannihilation.\r\n\r\nNothing happened the next day, or the next, to weaken her terrors. Two\r\nposts came in, and brought no refutation, public or private. There was\r\nno second letter to explain away the first from Miss Crawford; there\r\nwas no intelligence from Mansfield, though it was now full time for her\r\nto hear again from her aunt. This was an evil omen. She had, indeed,\r\nscarcely the shadow of a hope to soothe her mind, and was reduced to so\r\nlow and wan and trembling a condition, as no mother, not unkind, except\r\nMrs. Price could have overlooked, when the third day did bring the\r\nsickening knock, and a letter was again put into her hands. It bore the\r\nLondon postmark, and came from Edmund.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Fanny,\xe2\x80\x94You know our present wretchedness. May God support you\r\nunder your share! We have been here two days, but there is nothing to\r\nbe done. They cannot be traced. You may not have heard of the last\r\nblow\xe2\x80\x94Julia\xe2\x80\x99s elopement; she is gone to Scotland with Yates. She left\r\nLondon a few hours before we entered it. At any other time this would\r\nhave been felt dreadfully. Now it seems nothing; yet it is an heavy\r\naggravation. My father is not overpowered. More cannot be hoped. He is\r\nstill able to think and act; and I write, by his desire, to propose\r\nyour returning home. He is anxious to get you there for my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake. I shall be at Portsmouth the morning after you receive this, and\r\nhope to find you ready to set off for Mansfield. My father wishes you\r\nto invite Susan to go with you for a few months. Settle it as you like;\r\nsay what is proper; I am sure you will feel such an instance of his\r\nkindness at such a moment! Do justice to his meaning, however I may\r\nconfuse it. You may imagine something of my present state. There is no\r\nend of the evil let loose upon us. You will see me early by the\r\nmail.\xe2\x80\x94Yours, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever had Fanny more wanted a cordial. Never had she felt such a one as\r\nthis letter contained. To-morrow! to leave Portsmouth to-morrow! She\r\nwas, she felt she was, in the greatest danger of being exquisitely\r\nhappy, while so many were miserable. The evil which brought such good\r\nto her! She dreaded lest she should learn to be insensible of it. To be\r\ngoing so soon, sent for so kindly, sent for as a comfort, and with\r\nleave to take Susan, was altogether such a combination of blessings as\r\nset her heart in a glow, and for a time seemed to distance every pain,\r\nand make her incapable of suitably sharing the distress even of those\r\nwhose distress she thought of most. Julia\xe2\x80\x99s elopement could affect her\r\ncomparatively but little; she was amazed and shocked; but it could not\r\noccupy her, could not dwell on her mind. She was obliged to call\r\nherself to think of it, and acknowledge it to be terrible and grievous,\r\nor it was escaping her, in the midst of all the agitating pressing\r\njoyful cares attending this summons to herself.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like employment, active indispensable employment, for\r\nrelieving sorrow. Employment, even melancholy, may dispel melancholy,\r\nand her occupations were hopeful. She had so much to do, that not even\r\nthe horrible story of Mrs. Rushworth (now fixed to the last point of\r\ncertainty), could affect her as it had done before. She had not time to\r\nbe miserable. Within twenty-four hours she was hoping to be gone; her\r\nfather and mother must be spoken to, Susan prepared, everything got\r\nready. Business followed business; the day was hardly long enough. The\r\nhappiness she was imparting, too, happiness very little alloyed by the\r\nblack communication which must briefly precede it\xe2\x80\x94the joyful consent of\r\nher father and mother to Susan\xe2\x80\x99s going with her\xe2\x80\x94the general\r\nsatisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded, and the\r\necstasy of Susan herself, was all serving to support her spirits.\r\n\r\nThe affliction of the Bertrams was little felt in the family. Mrs.\r\nPrice talked of her poor sister for a few minutes, but how to find\r\nanything to hold Susan\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, because Rebecca took away all the\r\nboxes and spoilt them, was much more in her thoughts: and as for Susan,\r\nnow unexpectedly gratified in the first wish of her heart, and knowing\r\nnothing personally of those who had sinned, or of those who were\r\nsorrowing\xe2\x80\x94if she could help rejoicing from beginning to end, it was as\r\nmuch as ought to be expected from human virtue at fourteen.\r\n\r\nAs nothing was really left for the decision of Mrs. Price, or the good\r\noffices of Rebecca, everything was rationally and duly accomplished,\r\nand the girls were ready for the morrow. The advantage of much sleep to\r\nprepare them for their journey was impossible. The cousin who was\r\ntravelling towards them could hardly have less than visited their\r\nagitated spirits\xe2\x80\x94one all happiness, the other all varying and\r\nindescribable perturbation.\r\n\r\nBy eight in the morning Edmund was in the house. The girls heard his\r\nentrance from above, and Fanny went down. The idea of immediately\r\nseeing him, with the knowledge of what he must be suffering, brought\r\nback all her own first feelings. He so near her, and in misery. She was\r\nready to sink as she entered the parlour. He was alone, and met her\r\ninstantly; and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these\r\nwords, just articulate, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Fanny, my only sister; my only comfort\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d She could say nothing; nor for some minutes could he say more.\r\n\r\nHe turned away to recover himself, and when he spoke again, though his\r\nvoice still faltered, his manner shewed the wish of self-command, and\r\nthe resolution of avoiding any farther allusion. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you breakfasted?\r\nWhen shall you be ready? Does Susan go?\xe2\x80\x9d were questions following each\r\nother rapidly. His great object was to be off as soon as possible. When\r\nMansfield was considered, time was precious; and the state of his own\r\nmind made him find relief only in motion. It was settled that he should\r\norder the carriage to the door in half an hour. Fanny answered for\r\ntheir having breakfasted and being quite ready in half an hour. He had\r\nalready ate, and declined staying for their meal. He would walk round\r\nthe ramparts, and join them with the carriage. He was gone again; glad\r\nto get away even from Fanny.\r\n\r\nHe looked very ill; evidently suffering under violent emotions, which\r\nhe was determined to suppress. She knew it must be so, but it was\r\nterrible to her.\r\n\r\nThe carriage came; and he entered the house again at the same moment,\r\njust in time to spend a few minutes with the family, and be a\r\nwitness\xe2\x80\x94but that he saw nothing\xe2\x80\x94of the tranquil manner in which the\r\ndaughters were parted with, and just in time to prevent their sitting\r\ndown to the breakfast-table, which, by dint of much unusual activity,\r\nwas quite and completely ready as the carriage drove from the door.\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s last meal in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house was in character with her\r\nfirst: she was dismissed from it as hospitably as she had been\r\nwelcomed.\r\n\r\nHow her heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she passed the barriers\r\nof Portsmouth, and how Susan\xe2\x80\x99s face wore its broadest smiles, may be\r\neasily conceived. Sitting forwards, however, and screened by her\r\nbonnet, those smiles were unseen.\r\n\r\nThe journey was likely to be a silent one. Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s deep sighs often\r\nreached Fanny. Had he been alone with her, his heart must have opened\r\nin spite of every resolution; but Susan\xe2\x80\x99s presence drove him quite into\r\nhimself, and his attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never\r\nbe long supported.\r\n\r\nFanny watched him with never-failing solicitude, and sometimes catching\r\nhis eye, revived an affectionate smile, which comforted her; but the\r\nfirst day\xe2\x80\x99s journey passed without her hearing a word from him on the\r\nsubjects that were weighing him down. The next morning produced a\r\nlittle more. Just before their setting out from Oxford, while Susan was\r\nstationed at a window, in eager observation of the departure of a large\r\nfamily from the inn, the other two were standing by the fire; and\r\nEdmund, particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s looks, and\r\nfrom his ignorance of the daily evils of her father\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nattributing an undue share of the change, attributing _all_ to the\r\nrecent event, took her hand, and said in a low, but very expressive\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder\xe2\x80\x94you must feel it\xe2\x80\x94you must suffer. How a man who had\r\nonce loved, could desert you! But _yours_\xe2\x80\x94your regard was new compared\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Fanny, think of _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first division of their journey occupied a long day, and brought\r\nthem, almost knocked up, to Oxford; but the second was over at a much\r\nearlier hour. They were in the environs of Mansfield long before the\r\nusual dinner-time, and as they approached the beloved place, the hearts\r\nof both sisters sank a little. Fanny began to dread the meeting with\r\nher aunts and Tom, under so dreadful a humiliation; and Susan to feel\r\nwith some anxiety, that all her best manners, all her lately acquired\r\nknowledge of what was practised here, was on the point of being called\r\ninto action. Visions of good and ill breeding, of old vulgarisms and\r\nnew gentilities, were before her; and she was meditating much upon\r\nsilver forks, napkins, and finger-glasses. Fanny had been everywhere\r\nawake to the difference of the country since February; but when they\r\nentered the Park her perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest\r\nsort. It was three months, full three months, since her quitting it,\r\nand the change was from winter to summer. Her eye fell everywhere on\r\nlawns and plantations of the freshest green; and the trees, though not\r\nfully clothed, were in that delightful state when farther beauty is\r\nknown to be at hand, and when, while much is actually given to the\r\nsight, more yet remains for the imagination. Her enjoyment, however,\r\nwas for herself alone. Edmund could not share it. She looked at him,\r\nbut he was leaning back, sunk in a deeper gloom than ever, and with\r\neyes closed, as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him, and the\r\nlovely scenes of home must be shut out.\r\n\r\nIt made her melancholy again; and the knowledge of what must be\r\nenduring there, invested even the house, modern, airy, and well\r\nsituated as it was, with a melancholy aspect.\r\n\r\nBy one of the suffering party within they were expected with such\r\nimpatience as she had never known before. Fanny had scarcely passed the\r\nsolemn-looking servants, when Lady Bertram came from the drawing-room\r\nto meet her; came with no indolent step; and falling on her neck, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Fanny! now I shall be comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been a miserable party, each of the three believing themselves\r\nmost miserable. Mrs. Norris, however, as most attached to Maria, was\r\nreally the greatest sufferer. Maria was her first favourite, the\r\ndearest of all; the match had been her own contriving, as she had been\r\nwont with such pride of heart to feel and say, and this conclusion of\r\nit almost overpowered her.\r\n\r\nShe was an altered creature, quieted, stupefied, indifferent to\r\neverything that passed. The being left with her sister and nephew, and\r\nall the house under her care, had been an advantage entirely thrown\r\naway; she had been unable to direct or dictate, or even fancy herself\r\nuseful. When really touched by affliction, her active powers had been\r\nall benumbed; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her\r\nthe smallest support or attempt at support. She had done no more for\r\nthem than they had done for each other. They had been all solitary,\r\nhelpless, and forlorn alike; and now the arrival of the others only\r\nestablished her superiority in wretchedness. Her companions were\r\nrelieved, but there was no good for _her_. Edmund was almost as welcome\r\nto his brother as Fanny to her aunt; but Mrs. Norris, instead of having\r\ncomfort from either, was but the more irritated by the sight of the\r\nperson whom, in the blindness of her anger, she could have charged as\r\nthe daemon of the piece. Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not\r\nhave happened.\r\n\r\nSusan too was a grievance. She had not spirits to notice her in more\r\nthan a few repulsive looks, but she felt her as a spy, and an intruder,\r\nand an indigent niece, and everything most odious. By her other aunt,\r\nSusan was received with quiet kindness. Lady Bertram could not give her\r\nmuch time, or many words, but she felt her, as Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s sister, to have\r\na claim at Mansfield, and was ready to kiss and like her; and Susan was\r\nmore than satisfied, for she came perfectly aware that nothing but\r\nill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris; and was so provided\r\nwith happiness, so strong in that best of blessings, an escape from\r\nmany certain evils, that she could have stood against a great deal more\r\nindifference than she met with from the others.\r\n\r\nShe was now left a good deal to herself, to get acquainted with the\r\nhouse and grounds as she could, and spent her days very happily in so\r\ndoing, while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut\r\nup, or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them, at\r\nthis time, for everything like comfort; Edmund trying to bury his own\r\nfeelings in exertions for the relief of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s, and Fanny\r\ndevoted to her aunt Bertram, returning to every former office with more\r\nthan former zeal, and thinking she could never do enough for one who\r\nseemed so much to want her.\r\n\r\nTo talk over the dreadful business with Fanny, talk and lament, was all\r\nLady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s consolation. To be listened to and borne with, and hear\r\nthe voice of kindness and sympathy in return, was everything that could\r\nbe done for her. To be otherwise comforted was out of the question. The\r\ncase admitted of no comfort. Lady Bertram did not think deeply, but,\r\nguided by Sir Thomas, she thought justly on all important points; and\r\nshe saw, therefore, in all its enormity, what had happened, and neither\r\nendeavoured herself, nor required Fanny to advise her, to think little\r\nof guilt and infamy.\r\n\r\nHer affections were not acute, nor was her mind tenacious. After a\r\ntime, Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other\r\nsubjects, and revive some interest in the usual occupations; but\r\nwhenever Lady Bertram _was_ fixed on the event, she could see it only\r\nin one light, as comprehending the loss of a daughter, and a disgrace\r\nnever to be wiped off.\r\n\r\nFanny learnt from her all the particulars which had yet transpired. Her\r\naunt was no very methodical narrator, but with the help of some letters\r\nto and from Sir Thomas, and what she already knew herself, and could\r\nreasonably combine, she was soon able to understand quite as much as\r\nshe wished of the circumstances attending the story.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth had gone, for the Easter holidays, to Twickenham, with a\r\nfamily whom she had just grown intimate with: a family of lively,\r\nagreeable manners, and probably of morals and discretion to suit, for\r\nto _their_ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times. His\r\nhaving been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew. Mr. Rushworth\r\nhad been gone at this time to Bath, to pass a few days with his mother,\r\nand bring her back to town, and Maria was with these friends without\r\nany restraint, without even Julia; for Julia had removed from Wimpole\r\nStreet two or three weeks before, on a visit to some relations of Sir\r\nThomas; a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to\r\nattribute to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates\xe2\x80\x99s account. Very soon\r\nafter the Rushworths\xe2\x80\x99 return to Wimpole Street, Sir Thomas had received\r\na letter from an old and most particular friend in London, who hearing\r\nand witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter, wrote to\r\nrecommend Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s coming to London himself, and using his\r\ninfluence with his daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was\r\nalready exposing her to unpleasant remarks, and evidently making Mr.\r\nRushworth uneasy.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter, without communicating\r\nits contents to any creature at Mansfield, when it was followed by\r\nanother, sent express from the same friend, to break to him the almost\r\ndesperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people.\r\nMrs. Rushworth had left her husband\xe2\x80\x99s house: Mr. Rushworth had been in\r\ngreat anger and distress to _him_ (Mr. Harding) for his advice; Mr.\r\nHarding feared there had been _at_ _least_ very flagrant indiscretion.\r\nThe maidservant of Mrs. Rushworth, senior, threatened alarmingly. He\r\nwas doing all in his power to quiet everything, with the hope of Mrs.\r\nRushworth\xe2\x80\x99s return, but was so much counteracted in Wimpole Street by\r\nthe influence of Mr. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s mother, that the worst consequences\r\nmight be apprehended.\r\n\r\nThis dreadful communication could not be kept from the rest of the\r\nfamily. Sir Thomas set off, Edmund would go with him, and the others\r\nhad been left in a state of wretchedness, inferior only to what\r\nfollowed the receipt of the next letters from London. Everything was by\r\nthat time public beyond a hope. The servant of Mrs. Rushworth, the\r\nmother, had exposure in her power, and supported by her mistress, was\r\nnot to be silenced. The two ladies, even in the short time they had\r\nbeen together, had disagreed; and the bitterness of the elder against\r\nher daughter-in-law might perhaps arise almost as much from the\r\npersonal disrespect with which she had herself been treated as from\r\nsensibility for her son.\r\n\r\nHowever that might be, she was unmanageable. But had she been less\r\nobstinate, or of less weight with her son, who was always guided by the\r\nlast speaker, by the person who could get hold of and shut him up, the\r\ncase would still have been hopeless, for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear\r\nagain, and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed\r\nsomewhere with Mr. Crawford, who had quitted his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house, as for\r\na journey, on the very day of her absenting herself.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas, however, remained yet a little longer in town, in the hope\r\nof discovering and snatching her from farther vice, though all was lost\r\non the side of character.\r\n\r\n_His_ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of. There was but\r\none of his children who was not at this time a source of misery to him.\r\nTom\xe2\x80\x99s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, and his recovery so much thrown back by it, that even\r\nLady Bertram had been struck by the difference, and all her alarms were\r\nregularly sent off to her husband; and Julia\xe2\x80\x99s elopement, the\r\nadditional blow which had met him on his arrival in London, though its\r\nforce had been deadened at the moment, must, she knew, be sorely felt.\r\nShe saw that it was. His letters expressed how much he deplored it.\r\nUnder any circumstances it would have been an unwelcome alliance; but\r\nto have it so clandestinely formed, and such a period chosen for its\r\ncompletion, placed Julia\xe2\x80\x99s feelings in a most unfavourable light, and\r\nseverely aggravated the folly of her choice. He called it a bad thing,\r\ndone in the worst manner, and at the worst time; and though Julia was\r\nyet as more pardonable than Maria as folly than vice, he could not but\r\nregard the step she had taken as opening the worst probabilities of a\r\nconclusion hereafter like her sister\xe2\x80\x99s. Such was his opinion of the set\r\ninto which she had thrown herself.\r\n\r\nFanny felt for him most acutely. He could have no comfort but in\r\nEdmund. Every other child must be racking his heart. His displeasure\r\nagainst herself she trusted, reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris,\r\nwould now be done away. _She_ should be justified. Mr. Crawford would\r\nhave fully acquitted her conduct in refusing him; but this, though most\r\nmaterial to herself, would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas. Her\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure was terrible to her; but what could her\r\njustification or her gratitude and attachment do for him? His stay must\r\nbe on Edmund alone.\r\n\r\nShe was mistaken, however, in supposing that Edmund gave his father no\r\npresent pain. It was of a much less poignant nature than what the\r\nothers excited; but Sir Thomas was considering his happiness as very\r\ndeeply involved in the offence of his sister and friend; cut off by it,\r\nas he must be, from the woman whom he had been pursuing with undoubted\r\nattachment and strong probability of success; and who, in everything\r\nbut this despicable brother, would have been so eligible a connexion.\r\nHe was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf, in\r\naddition to all the rest, when they were in town: he had seen or\r\nconjectured his feelings; and, having reason to think that one\r\ninterview with Miss Crawford had taken place, from which Edmund derived\r\nonly increased distress, had been as anxious on that account as on\r\nothers to get him out of town, and had engaged him in taking Fanny home\r\nto her aunt, with a view to his relief and benefit, no less than\r\ntheirs. Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, Sir Thomas\r\nnot in the secret of Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s character. Had he been privy to\r\nher conversation with his son, he would not have wished her to belong\r\nto him, though her twenty thousand pounds had been forty.\r\n\r\nThat Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit\r\nof a doubt with Fanny; and yet, till she knew that he felt the same,\r\nher own conviction was insufficient. She thought he did, but she wanted\r\nto be assured of it. If he would now speak to her with the unreserve\r\nwhich had sometimes been too much for her before, it would be most\r\nconsoling; but _that_ she found was not to be. She seldom saw him:\r\nnever alone. He probably avoided being alone with her. What was to be\r\ninferred? That his judgment submitted to all his own peculiar and\r\nbitter share of this family affliction, but that it was too keenly felt\r\nto be a subject of the slightest communication. This must be his state.\r\nHe yielded, but it was with agonies which did not admit of speech.\r\nLong, long would it be ere Miss Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s name passed his lips again,\r\nor she could hope for a renewal of such confidential intercourse as had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nIt _was_ long. They reached Mansfield on Thursday, and it was not till\r\nSunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her on the subject. Sitting\r\nwith her on Sunday evening\xe2\x80\x94a wet Sunday evening\xe2\x80\x94the very time of all\r\nothers when, if a friend is at hand, the heart must be opened, and\r\neverything told; no one else in the room, except his mother, who, after\r\nhearing an affecting sermon, had cried herself to sleep, it was\r\nimpossible not to speak; and so, with the usual beginnings, hardly to\r\nbe traced as to what came first, and the usual declaration that if she\r\nwould listen to him for a few minutes, he should be very brief, and\r\ncertainly never tax her kindness in the same way again; she need not\r\nfear a repetition; it would be a subject prohibited entirely: he\r\nentered upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the\r\nfirst interest to himself, to one of whose affectionate sympathy he was\r\nquite convinced.\r\n\r\nHow Fanny listened, with what curiosity and concern, what pain and what\r\ndelight, how the agitation of his voice was watched, and how carefully\r\nher own eyes were fixed on any object but himself, may be imagined. The\r\nopening was alarming. He had seen Miss Crawford. He had been invited to\r\nsee her. He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call;\r\nand regarding it as what was meant to be the last, last interview of\r\nfriendship, and investing her with all the feelings of shame and\r\nwretchedness which Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s sister ought to have known, he had gone\r\nto her in such a state of mind, so softened, so devoted, as made it for\r\na few moments impossible to Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s fears that it should be the last.\r\nBut as he proceeded in his story, these fears were over. She had met\r\nhim, he said, with a serious\xe2\x80\x94certainly a serious\xe2\x80\x94even an agitated air;\r\nbut before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence, she had\r\nintroduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I\r\nheard you were in town,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98I wanted to see you. Let us talk\r\nover this sad business. What can equal the folly of our two relations?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI could not answer, but I believe my looks spoke. She felt reproved.\r\nSometimes how quick to feel! With a graver look and voice she then\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x98I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister\xe2\x80\x99s expense.\xe2\x80\x99 So she\r\nbegan, but how she went on, Fanny, is not fit, is hardly fit to be\r\nrepeated to you. I cannot recall all her words. I would not dwell upon\r\nthem if I could. Their substance was great anger at the _folly_ of\r\neach. She reprobated her brother\xe2\x80\x99s folly in being drawn on by a woman\r\nwhom he had never cared for, to do what must lose him the woman he\r\nadored; but still more the folly of poor Maria, in sacrificing such a\r\nsituation, plunging into such difficulties, under the idea of being\r\nreally loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear.\r\nGuess what I must have felt. To hear the woman whom\xe2\x80\x94no harsher name\r\nthan folly given! So voluntarily, so freely, so coolly to canvass it!\r\nNo reluctance, no horror, no feminine, shall I say, no modest\r\nloathings? This is what the world does. For where, Fanny, shall we find\r\na woman whom nature had so richly endowed? Spoilt, spoilt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a little reflection, he went on with a sort of desperate\r\ncalmness. \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you everything, and then have done for ever. She\r\nsaw it only as folly, and that folly stamped only by exposure. The want\r\nof common discretion, of caution: his going down to Richmond for the\r\nwhole time of her being at Twickenham; her putting herself in the power\r\nof a servant; it was the detection, in short\xe2\x80\x94oh, Fanny! it was the\r\ndetection, not the offence, which she reprobated. It was the imprudence\r\nwhich had brought things to extremity, and obliged her brother to give\r\nup every dearer plan in order to fly with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopt. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny (believing herself required to speak),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat could you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing to be understood. I was like a man stunned. She went\r\non, began to talk of you; yes, then she began to talk of you,\r\nregretting, as well she might, the loss of such a\xe2\x80\x94. There she spoke\r\nvery rationally. But she has always done justice to you. \xe2\x80\x98He has thrown\r\naway,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98such a woman as he will never see again. She would\r\nhave fixed him; she would have made him happy for ever.\xe2\x80\x99 My dearest\r\nFanny, I am giving you, I hope, more pleasure than pain by this\r\nretrospect of what might have been\xe2\x80\x94but what never can be now. You do\r\nnot wish me to be silent? If you do, give me but a look, a word, and I\r\nhave done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo look or word was given.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were all disposed to wonder, but it seems to\r\nhave been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which\r\nknew no guile should not suffer. She spoke of you with high praise and\r\nwarm affection; yet, even here, there was alloy, a dash of evil; for in\r\nthe midst of it she could exclaim, \xe2\x80\x98Why would not she have him? It is\r\nall her fault. Simple girl! I shall never forgive her. Had she accepted\r\nhim as she ought, they might now have been on the point of marriage,\r\nand Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other\r\nobject. He would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth\r\nagain. It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation, in\r\nyearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham.\xe2\x80\x99 Could you have believed\r\nit possible? But the charm is broken. My eyes are opened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCruel!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fanny, \xe2\x80\x9cquite cruel. At such a moment to give way to\r\ngaiety, to speak with lightness, and to you! Absolute cruelty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCruelty, do you call it? We differ there. No, hers is not a cruel\r\nnature. I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings. The evil\r\nlies yet deeper: in her total ignorance, unsuspiciousness of there\r\nbeing such feelings; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to\r\nher to treat the subject as she did. She was speaking only as she had\r\nbeen used to hear others speak, as she imagined everybody else would\r\nspeak. Hers are not faults of temper. She would not voluntarily give\r\nunnecessary pain to any one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot\r\nbut think that for me, for my feelings, she would\xe2\x80\x94. Hers are faults of\r\nprinciple, Fanny; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted, vitiated mind.\r\nPerhaps it is best for me, since it leaves me so little to regret. Not\r\nso, however. Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing\r\nher, rather than have to think of her as I do. I told her so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; when I left her I told her so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long were you together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive-and-twenty minutes. Well, she went on to say that what remained\r\nnow to be done was to bring about a marriage between them. She spoke of\r\nit, Fanny, with a steadier voice than I can.\xe2\x80\x9d He was obliged to pause\r\nmore than once as he continued. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We must persuade Henry to marry her,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid she; \xe2\x80\x98and what with honour, and the certainty of having shut\r\nhimself out for ever from Fanny, I do not despair of it. Fanny he must\r\ngive up. I do not think that even _he_ could now hope to succeed with\r\none of her stamp, and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable\r\ndifficulty. My influence, which is not small shall all go that way; and\r\nwhen once married, and properly supported by her own family, people of\r\nrespectability as they are, she may recover her footing in society to a\r\ncertain degree. In some circles, we know, she would never be admitted,\r\nbut with good dinners, and large parties, there will always be those\r\nwho will be glad of her acquaintance; and there is, undoubtedly, more\r\nliberality and candour on those points than formerly. What I advise is,\r\nthat your father be quiet. Do not let him injure his own cause by\r\ninterference. Persuade him to let things take their course. If by any\r\nofficious exertions of his, she is induced to leave Henry\xe2\x80\x99s protection,\r\nthere will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain\r\nwith him. I know how he is likely to be influenced. Let Sir Thomas\r\ntrust to his honour and compassion, and it may all end well; but if he\r\nget his daughter away, it will be destroying the chief hold.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny, watching\r\nhim with silent, but most tender concern, was almost sorry that the\r\nsubject had been entered on at all. It was long before he could speak\r\nagain. At last, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Fanny,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon have done. I have\r\ntold you the substance of all that she said. As soon as I could speak,\r\nI replied that I had not supposed it possible, coming in such a state\r\nof mind into that house as I had done, that anything could occur to\r\nmake me suffer more, but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in\r\nalmost every sentence. That though I had, in the course of our\r\nacquaintance, been often sensible of some difference in our opinions,\r\non points, too, of some moment, it had not entered my imagination to\r\nconceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it. That\r\nthe manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her\r\nbrother and my sister (with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended\r\nnot to say), but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself,\r\ngiving it every reproach but the right; considering its ill\r\nconsequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance\r\nof decency and impudence in wrong; and last of all, and above all,\r\nrecommending to us a compliance, a compromise, an acquiescence in the\r\ncontinuance of the sin, on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as\r\nI now thought of her brother, should rather be prevented than sought;\r\nall this together most grievously convinced me that I had never\r\nunderstood her before, and that, as far as related to mind, it had been\r\nthe creature of my own imagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been\r\ntoo apt to dwell on for many months past. That, perhaps, it was best\r\nfor me; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings,\r\nhopes which must, at any rate, have been torn from me now. And yet,\r\nthat I must and would confess that, could I have restored her to what\r\nshe had appeared to me before, I would infinitely prefer any increase\r\nof the pain of parting, for the sake of carrying with me the right of\r\ntenderness and esteem. This is what I said, the purport of it; but, as\r\nyou may imagine, not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have\r\nrepeated it to you. She was astonished, exceedingly astonished\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nthan astonished. I saw her change countenance. She turned extremely\r\nred. I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings: a great, though short\r\nstruggle; half a wish of yielding to truths, half a sense of shame, but\r\nhabit, habit carried it. She would have laughed if she could. It was a\r\nsort of laugh, as she answered, \xe2\x80\x98A pretty good lecture, upon my word.\r\nWas it part of your last sermon? At this rate you will soon reform\r\neverybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey; and when I hear of you next,\r\nit may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists,\r\nor as a missionary into foreign parts.\xe2\x80\x99 She tried to speak carelessly,\r\nbut she was not so careless as she wanted to appear. I only said in\r\nreply, that from my heart I wished her well, and earnestly hoped that\r\nshe might soon learn to think more justly, and not owe the most\r\nvaluable knowledge we could any of us acquire, the knowledge of\r\nourselves and of our duty, to the lessons of affliction, and\r\nimmediately left the room. I had gone a few steps, Fanny, when I heard\r\nthe door open behind me. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Bertram,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. I looked back. \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nBertram,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, with a smile; but it was a smile ill-suited to the\r\nconversation that had passed, a saucy playful smile, seeming to invite\r\nin order to subdue me; at least it appeared so to me. I resisted; it\r\nwas the impulse of the moment to resist, and still walked on. I have\r\nsince, sometimes, for a moment, regretted that I did not go back, but I\r\nknow I was right, and such has been the end of our acquaintance. And\r\nwhat an acquaintance has it been! How have I been deceived! Equally in\r\nbrother and sister deceived! I thank you for your patience, Fanny. This\r\nhas been the greatest relief, and now we will have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd such was Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on his words, that for five minutes she\r\nthought they _had_ done. Then, however, it all came on again, or\r\nsomething very like it, and nothing less than Lady Bertram\xe2\x80\x99s rousing\r\nthoroughly up could really close such a conversation. Till that\r\nhappened, they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone, and how she\r\nhad attached him, and how delightful nature had made her, and how\r\nexcellent she would have been, had she fallen into good hands earlier.\r\nFanny, now at liberty to speak openly, felt more than justified in\r\nadding to his knowledge of her real character, by some hint of what\r\nshare his brother\xe2\x80\x99s state of health might be supposed to have in her\r\nwish for a complete reconciliation. This was not an agreeable\r\nintimation. Nature resisted it for a while. It would have been a vast\r\ndeal pleasanter to have had her more disinterested in her attachment;\r\nbut his vanity was not of a strength to fight long against reason. He\r\nsubmitted to believe that Tom\xe2\x80\x99s illness had influenced her, only\r\nreserving for himself this consoling thought, that considering the many\r\ncounteractions of opposing habits, she had certainly been _more_\r\nattached to him than could have been expected, and for his sake been\r\nmore near doing right. Fanny thought exactly the same; and they were\r\nalso quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect, the indelible\r\nimpression, which such a disappointment must make on his mind. Time\r\nwould undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings, but still it was a\r\nsort of thing which he never could get entirely the better of; and as\r\nto his ever meeting with any other woman who could\xe2\x80\x94it was too\r\nimpossible to be named but with indignation. Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s friendship was all\r\nthat he had to cling to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLet other pens dwell on guilt and misery. I quit such odious subjects\r\nas soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody, not greatly in fault\r\nthemselves, to tolerable comfort, and to have done with all the rest.\r\n\r\nMy Fanny, indeed, at this very time, I have the satisfaction of\r\nknowing, must have been happy in spite of everything. She must have\r\nbeen a happy creature in spite of all that she felt, or thought she\r\nfelt, for the distress of those around her. She had sources of delight\r\nthat must force their way. She was returned to Mansfield Park, she was\r\nuseful, she was beloved; she was safe from Mr. Crawford; and when Sir\r\nThomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then\r\nmelancholy state of spirits, of his perfect approbation and increased\r\nregard; and happy as all this must make her, she would still have been\r\nhappy without any of it, for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss\r\nCrawford.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Edmund was very far from happy himself. He was\r\nsuffering from disappointment and regret, grieving over what was, and\r\nwishing for what could never be. She knew it was so, and was sorry; but\r\nit was with a sorrow so founded on satisfaction, so tending to ease,\r\nand so much in harmony with every dearest sensation, that there are few\r\nwho might not have been glad to exchange their greatest gaiety for it.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas, poor Sir Thomas, a parent, and conscious of errors in his\r\nown conduct as a parent, was the longest to suffer. He felt that he\r\nought not to have allowed the marriage; that his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments\r\nhad been sufficiently known to him to render him culpable in\r\nauthorising it; that in so doing he had sacrificed the right to the\r\nexpedient, and been governed by motives of selfishness and worldly\r\nwisdom. These were reflections that required some time to soften; but\r\ntime will do almost everything; and though little comfort arose on Mrs.\r\nRushworth\xe2\x80\x99s side for the misery she had occasioned, comfort was to be\r\nfound greater than he had supposed in his other children. Julia\xe2\x80\x99s match\r\nbecame a less desperate business than he had considered it at first.\r\nShe was humble, and wishing to be forgiven; and Mr. Yates, desirous of\r\nbeing really received into the family, was disposed to look up to him\r\nand be guided. He was not very solid; but there was a hope of his\r\nbecoming less trifling, of his being at least tolerably domestic and\r\nquiet; and at any rate, there was comfort in finding his estate rather\r\nmore, and his debts much less, than he had feared, and in being\r\nconsulted and treated as the friend best worth attending to. There was\r\ncomfort also in Tom, who gradually regained his health, without\r\nregaining the thoughtlessness and selfishness of his previous habits.\r\nHe was the better for ever for his illness. He had suffered, and he had\r\nlearned to think: two advantages that he had never known before; and\r\nthe self-reproach arising from the deplorable event in Wimpole Street,\r\nto which he felt himself accessory by all the dangerous intimacy of his\r\nunjustifiable theatre, made an impression on his mind which, at the age\r\nof six-and-twenty, with no want of sense or good companions, was\r\ndurable in its happy effects. He became what he ought to be: useful to\r\nhis father, steady and quiet, and not living merely for himself.\r\n\r\nHere was comfort indeed! and quite as soon as Sir Thomas could place\r\ndependence on such sources of good, Edmund was contributing to his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s ease by improvement in the only point in which he had given\r\nhim pain before\xe2\x80\x94improvement in his spirits. After wandering about and\r\nsitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings, he had so well\r\ntalked his mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again.\r\n\r\nThese were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually brought\r\ntheir alleviation to Sir Thomas, deadening his sense of what was lost,\r\nand in part reconciling him to himself; though the anguish arising from\r\nthe conviction of his own errors in the education of his daughters was\r\nnever to be entirely done away.\r\n\r\nToo late he became aware how unfavourable to the character of any young\r\npeople must be the totally opposite treatment which Maria and Julia had\r\nbeen always experiencing at home, where the excessive indulgence and\r\nflattery of their aunt had been continually contrasted with his own\r\nseverity. He saw how ill he had judged, in expecting to counteract what\r\nwas wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself; clearly saw that he\r\nhad but increased the evil by teaching them to repress their spirits in\r\nhis presence so as to make their real disposition unknown to him, and\r\nsending them for all their indulgences to a person who had been able to\r\nattach them only by the blindness of her affection, and the excess of\r\nher praise.\r\n\r\nHere had been grievous mismanagement; but, bad as it was, he gradually\r\ngrew to feel that it had not been the most direful mistake in his plan\r\nof education. Something must have been wanting _within_, or time would\r\nhave worn away much of its ill effect. He feared that principle, active\r\nprinciple, had been wanting; that they had never been properly taught\r\nto govern their inclinations and tempers by that sense of duty which\r\ncan alone suffice. They had been instructed theoretically in their\r\nreligion, but never required to bring it into daily practice. To be\r\ndistinguished for elegance and accomplishments, the authorised object\r\nof their youth, could have had no useful influence that way, no moral\r\neffect on the mind. He had meant them to be good, but his cares had\r\nbeen directed to the understanding and manners, not the disposition;\r\nand of the necessity of self-denial and humility, he feared they had\r\nnever heard from any lips that could profit them.\r\n\r\nBitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he could scarcely\r\ncomprehend to have been possible. Wretchedly did he feel, that with all\r\nthe cost and care of an anxious and expensive education, he had brought\r\nup his daughters without their understanding their first duties, or his\r\nbeing acquainted with their character and temper.\r\n\r\nThe high spirit and strong passions of Mrs. Rushworth, especially, were\r\nmade known to him only in their sad result. She was not to be prevailed\r\non to leave Mr. Crawford. She hoped to marry him, and they continued\r\ntogether till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope was vain,\r\nand till the disappointment and wretchedness arising from the\r\nconviction rendered her temper so bad, and her feelings for him so like\r\nhatred, as to make them for a while each other\xe2\x80\x99s punishment, and then\r\ninduce a voluntary separation.\r\n\r\nShe had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin of all his\r\nhappiness in Fanny, and carried away no better consolation in leaving\r\nhim than that she _had_ divided them. What can exceed the misery of\r\nsuch a mind in such a situation?\r\n\r\nMr. Rushworth had no difficulty in procuring a divorce; and so ended a\r\nmarriage contracted under such circumstances as to make any better end\r\nthe effect of good luck not to be reckoned on. She had despised him,\r\nand loved another; and he had been very much aware that it was so. The\r\nindignities of stupidity, and the disappointments of selfish passion,\r\ncan excite little pity. His punishment followed his conduct, as did a\r\ndeeper punishment the deeper guilt of his wife. _He_ was released from\r\nthe engagement to be mortified and unhappy, till some other pretty girl\r\ncould attract him into matrimony again, and he might set forward on a\r\nsecond, and, it is to be hoped, more prosperous trial of the state: if\r\nduped, to be duped at least with good humour and good luck; while she\r\nmust withdraw with infinitely stronger feelings to a retirement and\r\nreproach which could allow no second spring of hope or character.\r\n\r\nWhere she could be placed became a subject of most melancholy and\r\nmomentous consultation. Mrs. Norris, whose attachment seemed to augment\r\nwith the demerits of her niece, would have had her received at home and\r\ncountenanced by them all. Sir Thomas would not hear of it; and Mrs.\r\nNorris\xe2\x80\x99s anger against Fanny was so much the greater, from considering\r\n_her_ residence there as the motive. She persisted in placing his\r\nscruples to _her_ account, though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her\r\nthat, had there been no young woman in question, had there been no\r\nyoung person of either sex belonging to him, to be endangered by the\r\nsociety or hurt by the character of Mrs. Rushworth, he would never have\r\noffered so great an insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to\r\nnotice her. As a daughter, he hoped a penitent one, she should be\r\nprotected by him, and secured in every comfort, and supported by every\r\nencouragement to do right, which their relative situations admitted;\r\nbut farther than _that_ he could not go. Maria had destroyed her own\r\ncharacter, and he would not, by a vain attempt to restore what never\r\ncould be restored, by affording his sanction to vice, or in seeking to\r\nlessen its disgrace, be anywise accessory to introducing such misery in\r\nanother man\xe2\x80\x99s family as he had known himself.\r\n\r\nIt ended in Mrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s resolving to quit Mansfield and devote\r\nherself to her unfortunate Maria, and in an establishment being formed\r\nfor them in another country, remote and private, where, shut up\r\ntogether with little society, on one side no affection, on the other no\r\njudgment, it may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became their\r\nmutual punishment.\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris\xe2\x80\x99s removal from Mansfield was the great supplementary\r\ncomfort of Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s life. His opinion of her had been sinking from\r\nthe day of his return from Antigua: in every transaction together from\r\nthat period, in their daily intercourse, in business, or in chat, she\r\nhad been regularly losing ground in his esteem, and convincing him that\r\neither time had done her much disservice, or that he had considerably\r\nover-rated her sense, and wonderfully borne with her manners before. He\r\nhad felt her as an hourly evil, which was so much the worse, as there\r\nseemed no chance of its ceasing but with life; she seemed a part of\r\nhimself that must be borne for ever. To be relieved from her,\r\ntherefore, was so great a felicity that, had she not left bitter\r\nremembrances behind her, there might have been danger of his learning\r\nalmost to approve the evil which produced such a good.\r\n\r\nShe was regretted by no one at Mansfield. She had never been able to\r\nattach even those she loved best; and since Mrs. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s elopement,\r\nher temper had been in a state of such irritation as to make her\r\neverywhere tormenting. Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris, not\r\neven when she was gone for ever.\r\n\r\nThat Julia escaped better than Maria was owing, in some measure, to a\r\nfavourable difference of disposition and circumstance, but in a greater\r\nto her having been less the darling of that very aunt, less flattered\r\nand less spoilt. Her beauty and acquirements had held but a second\r\nplace. She had been always used to think herself a little inferior to\r\nMaria. Her temper was naturally the easiest of the two; her feelings,\r\nthough quick, were more controllable, and education had not given her\r\nso very hurtful a degree of self-consequence.\r\n\r\nShe had submitted the best to the disappointment in Henry Crawford.\r\nAfter the first bitterness of the conviction of being slighted was\r\nover, she had been tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him\r\nagain; and when the acquaintance was renewed in town, and Mr.\r\nRushworth\xe2\x80\x99s house became Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s object, she had had the merit of\r\nwithdrawing herself from it, and of chusing that time to pay a visit to\r\nher other friends, in order to secure herself from being again too much\r\nattracted. This had been her motive in going to her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s. Mr.\r\nYates\xe2\x80\x99s convenience had had nothing to do with it. She had been\r\nallowing his attentions some time, but with very little idea of ever\r\naccepting him; and had not her sister\xe2\x80\x99s conduct burst forth as it did,\r\nand her increased dread of her father and of home, on that event,\r\nimagining its certain consequence to herself would be greater severity\r\nand restraint, made her hastily resolve on avoiding such immediate\r\nhorrors at all risks, it is probable that Mr. Yates would never have\r\nsucceeded. She had not eloped with any worse feelings than those of\r\nselfish alarm. It had appeared to her the only thing to be done.\r\nMaria\xe2\x80\x99s guilt had induced Julia\xe2\x80\x99s folly.\r\n\r\nHenry Crawford, ruined by early independence and bad domestic example,\r\nindulged in the freaks of a cold-blooded vanity a little too long. Once\r\nit had, by an opening undesigned and unmerited, led him into the way of\r\nhappiness. Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one\r\namiable woman\xe2\x80\x99s affections, could he have found sufficient exultation\r\nin overcoming the reluctance, in working himself into the esteem and\r\ntenderness of Fanny Price, there would have been every probability of\r\nsuccess and felicity for him. His affection had already done something.\r\nHer influence over him had already given him some influence over her.\r\nWould he have deserved more, there can be no doubt that more would have\r\nbeen obtained, especially when that marriage had taken place, which\r\nwould have given him the assistance of her conscience in subduing her\r\nfirst inclination, and brought them very often together. Would he have\r\npersevered, and uprightly, Fanny must have been his reward, and a\r\nreward very voluntarily bestowed, within a reasonable period from\r\nEdmund\xe2\x80\x99s marrying Mary.\r\n\r\nHad he done as he intended, and as he knew he ought, by going down to\r\nEveringham after his return from Portsmouth, he might have been\r\ndeciding his own happy destiny. But he was pressed to stay for Mrs.\r\nFraser\xe2\x80\x99s party; his staying was made of flattering consequence, and he\r\nwas to meet Mrs. Rushworth there. Curiosity and vanity were both\r\nengaged, and the temptation of immediate pleasure was too strong for a\r\nmind unused to make any sacrifice to right: he resolved to defer his\r\nNorfolk journey, resolved that writing should answer the purpose of it,\r\nor that its purpose was unimportant, and staid. He saw Mrs. Rushworth,\r\nwas received by her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive,\r\nand have established apparent indifference between them for ever; but\r\nhe was mortified, he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose\r\nsmiles had been so wholly at his command: he must exert himself to\r\nsubdue so proud a display of resentment; it was anger on Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount; he must get the better of it, and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria\r\nBertram again in her treatment of himself.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit he began the attack, and by animated perseverance had\r\nsoon re-established the sort of familiar intercourse, of gallantry, of\r\nflirtation, which bounded his views; but in triumphing over the\r\ndiscretion which, though beginning in anger, might have saved them\r\nboth, he had put himself in the power of feelings on her side more\r\nstrong than he had supposed. She loved him; there was no withdrawing\r\nattentions avowedly dear to her. He was entangled by his own vanity,\r\nwith as little excuse of love as possible, and without the smallest\r\ninconstancy of mind towards her cousin. To keep Fanny and the Bertrams\r\nfrom a knowledge of what was passing became his first object. Secrecy\r\ncould not have been more desirable for Mrs. Rushworth\xe2\x80\x99s credit than he\r\nfelt it for his own. When he returned from Richmond, he would have been\r\nglad to see Mrs. Rushworth no more. All that followed was the result of\r\nher imprudence; and he went off with her at last, because he could not\r\nhelp it, regretting Fanny even at the moment, but regretting her\r\ninfinitely more when all the bustle of the intrigue was over, and a\r\nvery few months had taught him, by the force of contrast, to place a\r\nyet higher value on the sweetness of her temper, the purity of her\r\nmind, and the excellence of her principles.\r\n\r\nThat punishment, the public punishment of disgrace, should in a just\r\nmeasure attend _his_ share of the offence is, we know, not one of the\r\nbarriers which society gives to virtue. In this world the penalty is\r\nless equal than could be wished; but without presuming to look forward\r\nto a juster appointment hereafter, we may fairly consider a man of\r\nsense, like Henry Crawford, to be providing for himself no small\r\nportion of vexation and regret: vexation that must rise sometimes to\r\nself-reproach, and regret to wretchedness, in having so requited\r\nhospitality, so injured family peace, so forfeited his best, most\r\nestimable, and endeared acquaintance, and so lost the woman whom he had\r\nrationally as well as passionately loved.\r\n\r\nAfter what had passed to wound and alienate the two families, the\r\ncontinuance of the Bertrams and Grants in such close neighbourhood\r\nwould have been most distressing; but the absence of the latter, for\r\nsome months purposely lengthened, ended very fortunately in the\r\nnecessity, or at least the practicability, of a permanent removal. Dr.\r\nGrant, through an interest on which he had almost ceased to form hopes,\r\nsucceeded to a stall in Westminster, which, as affording an occasion\r\nfor leaving Mansfield, an excuse for residence in London, and an\r\nincrease of income to answer the expenses of the change, was highly\r\nacceptable to those who went and those who staid.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grant, with a temper to love and be loved, must have gone with\r\nsome regret from the scenes and people she had been used to; but the\r\nsame happiness of disposition must in any place, and any society,\r\nsecure her a great deal to enjoy, and she had again a home to offer\r\nMary; and Mary had had enough of her own friends, enough of vanity,\r\nambition, love, and disappointment in the course of the last half-year,\r\nto be in need of the true kindness of her sister\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and the\r\nrational tranquillity of her ways. They lived together; and when Dr.\r\nGrant had brought on apoplexy and death, by three great institutionary\r\ndinners in one week, they still lived together; for Mary, though\r\nperfectly resolved against ever attaching herself to a younger brother\r\nagain, was long in finding among the dashing representatives, or idle\r\nheir-apparents, who were at the command of her beauty, and her \xc2\xa320,000,\r\nany one who could satisfy the better taste she had acquired at\r\nMansfield, whose character and manners could authorise a hope of the\r\ndomestic happiness she had there learned to estimate, or put Edmund\r\nBertram sufficiently out of her head.\r\n\r\nEdmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect. He had not to\r\nwait and wish with vacant affections for an object worthy to succeed\r\nher in them. Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford, and\r\nobserving to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with\r\nsuch another woman, before it began to strike him whether a very\r\ndifferent kind of woman might not do just as well, or a great deal\r\nbetter: whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear, as important to\r\nhim in all her smiles and all her ways, as Mary Crawford had ever been;\r\nand whether it might not be a possible, a hopeful undertaking to\r\npersuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be\r\nfoundation enough for wedded love.\r\n\r\nI purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that every one may be\r\nat liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable\r\npassions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as\r\nto time in different people. I only entreat everybody to believe that\r\nexactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so, and\r\nnot a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and\r\nbecame as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.\r\n\r\nWith such a regard for her, indeed, as his had long been, a regard\r\nfounded on the most endearing claims of innocence and helplessness, and\r\ncompleted by every recommendation of growing worth, what could be more\r\nnatural than the change? Loving, guiding, protecting her, as he had\r\nbeen doing ever since her being ten years old, her mind in so great a\r\ndegree formed by his care, and her comfort depending on his kindness,\r\nan object to him of such close and peculiar interest, dearer by all his\r\nown importance with her than any one else at Mansfield, what was there\r\nnow to add, but that he should learn to prefer soft light eyes to\r\nsparkling dark ones. And being always with her, and always talking\r\nconfidentially, and his feelings exactly in that favourable state which\r\na recent disappointment gives, those soft light eyes could not be very\r\nlong in obtaining the pre-eminence.\r\n\r\nHaving once set out, and felt that he had done so on this road to\r\nhappiness, there was nothing on the side of prudence to stop him or\r\nmake his progress slow; no doubts of her deserving, no fears of\r\nopposition of taste, no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from\r\ndissimilarity of temper. Her mind, disposition, opinions, and habits\r\nwanted no half-concealment, no self-deception on the present, no\r\nreliance on future improvement. Even in the midst of his late\r\ninfatuation, he had acknowledged Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s mental superiority. What must\r\nbe his sense of it now, therefore? She was of course only too good for\r\nhim; but as nobody minds having what is too good for them, he was very\r\nsteadily earnest in the pursuit of the blessing, and it was not\r\npossible that encouragement from her should be long wanting. Timid,\r\nanxious, doubting as she was, it was still impossible that such\r\ntenderness as hers should not, at times, hold out the strongest hope of\r\nsuccess, though it remained for a later period to tell him the whole\r\ndelightful and astonishing truth. His happiness in knowing himself to\r\nhave been so long the beloved of such a heart, must have been great\r\nenough to warrant any strength of language in which he could clothe it\r\nto her or to himself; it must have been a delightful happiness. But\r\nthere was happiness elsewhere which no description can reach. Let no\r\none presume to give the feelings of a young woman on receiving the\r\nassurance of that affection of which she has scarcely allowed herself\r\nto entertain a hope.\r\n\r\nTheir own inclinations ascertained, there were no difficulties behind,\r\nno drawback of poverty or parent. It was a match which Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwishes had even forestalled. Sick of ambitious and mercenary\r\nconnexions, prizing more and more the sterling good of principle and\r\ntemper, and chiefly anxious to bind by the strongest securities all\r\nthat remained to him of domestic felicity, he had pondered with genuine\r\nsatisfaction on the more than possibility of the two young friends\r\nfinding their natural consolation in each other for all that had\r\noccurred of disappointment to either; and the joyful consent which met\r\nEdmund\xe2\x80\x99s application, the high sense of having realised a great\r\nacquisition in the promise of Fanny for a daughter, formed just such a\r\ncontrast with his early opinion on the subject when the poor little\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s coming had been first agitated, as time is for ever producing\r\nbetween the plans and decisions of mortals, for their own instruction,\r\nand their neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 entertainment.\r\n\r\nFanny was indeed the daughter that he wanted. His charitable kindness\r\nhad been rearing a prime comfort for himself. His liberality had a rich\r\nrepayment, and the general goodness of his intentions by her deserved\r\nit. He might have made her childhood happier; but it had been an error\r\nof judgment only which had given him the appearance of harshness, and\r\ndeprived him of her early love; and now, on really knowing each other,\r\ntheir mutual attachment became very strong. After settling her at\r\nThornton Lacey with every kind attention to her comfort, the object of\r\nalmost every day was to see her there, or to get her away from it.\r\n\r\nSelfishly dear as she had long been to Lady Bertram, she could not be\r\nparted with willingly by _her_. No happiness of son or niece could make\r\nher wish the marriage. But it was possible to part with her, because\r\nSusan remained to supply her place. Susan became the stationary niece,\r\ndelighted to be so; and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of\r\nmind, and an inclination for usefulness, as Fanny had been by sweetness\r\nof temper, and strong feelings of gratitude. Susan could never be\r\nspared. First as a comfort to Fanny, then as an auxiliary, and last as\r\nher substitute, she was established at Mansfield, with every appearance\r\nof equal permanency. Her more fearless disposition and happier nerves\r\nmade everything easy to her there. With quickness in understanding the\r\ntempers of those she had to deal with, and no natural timidity to\r\nrestrain any consequent wishes, she was soon welcome and useful to all;\r\nand after Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over\r\nthe hourly comfort of her aunt, as gradually to become, perhaps, the\r\nmost beloved of the two. In _her_ usefulness, in Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s excellence, in\r\nWilliam\xe2\x80\x99s continued good conduct and rising fame, and in the general\r\nwell-doing and success of the other members of the family, all\r\nassisting to advance each other, and doing credit to his countenance\r\nand aid, Sir Thomas saw repeated, and for ever repeated, reason to\r\nrejoice in what he had done for them all, and acknowledge the\r\nadvantages of early hardship and discipline, and the consciousness of\r\nbeing born to struggle and endure.\r\n\r\nWith so much true merit and true love, and no want of fortune and\r\nfriends, the happiness of the married cousins must appear as secure as\r\nearthly happiness can be. Equally formed for domestic life, and\r\nattached to country pleasures, their home was the home of affection and\r\ncomfort; and to complete the picture of good, the acquisition of\r\nMansfield living, by the death of Dr. Grant, occurred just after they\r\nhad been married long enough to begin to want an increase of income,\r\nand feel their distance from the paternal abode an inconvenience.\r\n\r\nOn that event they removed to Mansfield; and the Parsonage there,\r\nwhich, under each of its two former owners, Fanny had never been able\r\nto approach but with some painful sensation of restraint or alarm, soon\r\ngrew as dear to her heart, and as thoroughly perfect in her eyes, as\r\neverything else within the view and patronage of Mansfield Park had\r\nlong been.\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MANSFIELD PARK ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 141-0.txt or 141-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/141/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
