THE JOURNEY IN THE WILDERNESS (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Sir Percy Florence and Lady Shelley\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a tale which extends over many years and travels into many\r\ncountries. By a peculiar fitness of circumstance the writer began,\r\ncontinued it, and concluded it among distant and diverse scenes. Above\r\nall, he was much upon the sea. The character and fortune of the\r\nfraternal enemies, the hall and shrubbery of Durrisdeer, the problem of\r\nMackellar\xe2\x80\x99s homespun and how to shape it for superior flights; these\r\nwere his company on deck in many star-reflecting harbours, ran often in\r\nhis mind at sea to the tune of slatting canvas, and were dismissed\r\n(something of the suddenest) on the approach of squalls. It is my hope\r\nthat these surroundings of its manufacture may to some degree find\r\nfavour for my story with seafarers and sea-lovers like yourselves.\r\n\r\nAnd at least here is a dedication from a great way off: written by the\r\nloud shores of a subtropical island near upon ten thousand miles from\r\nBoscombe Chine and Manor: scenes which rise before me as I write, along\r\nwith the faces and voices of my friends.\r\n\r\nWell, I am for the sea once more; no doubt Sir Percy also. Let us make\r\nthe signal B. R. D.!\r\n\r\nR. L. S.\r\n\r\nWaikiki, _May_ 17, 1889\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough an old, consistent exile, the editor of the following pages\r\nrevisits now and again the city of which he exults to be a native; and\r\nthere are few things more strange, more painful, or more salutary, than\r\nsuch revisitations. Outside, in foreign spots, he comes by surprise and\r\nawakens more attention than he had expected; in his own city, the\r\nrelation is reversed, and he stands amazed to be so little recollected.\r\nElsewhere he is refreshed to see attractive faces, to remark possible\r\nfriends; there he scouts the long streets, with a pang at heart, for\r\nthe faces and friends that are no more. Elsewhere he is delighted with\r\nthe presence of what is new, there tormented by the absence of what is\r\nold. Elsewhere he is content to be his present self; there he is\r\nsmitten with an equal regret for what he once was and for what he once\r\nhoped to be.\r\n\r\nHe was feeling all this dimly, as he drove from the station, on his\r\nlast visit; he was feeling it still as he alighted at the door of his\r\nfriend Mr. Johnstone Thomson, W.S., with whom he was to stay. A hearty\r\nwelcome, a face not altogether changed, a few words that sounded of old\r\ndays, a laugh provoked and shared, a glimpse in passing of the snowy\r\ncloth and bright decanters and the Piranesis on the dining-room wall,\r\nbrought him to his bed-room with a somewhat lightened cheer, and when\r\nhe and Mr. Thomson sat down a few minutes later, cheek by jowl, and\r\npledged the past in a preliminary bumper, he was already almost\r\nconsoled, he had already almost forgiven himself his two unpardonable\r\nerrors, that he should ever have left his native city, or ever returned\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something quite in your way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thomson. \xe2\x80\x9cI wished to do\r\nhonour to your arrival; because, my dear fellow, it is my own youth\r\nthat comes back along with you; in a very tattered and withered state,\r\nto be sure, but\xe2\x80\x94well!\xe2\x80\x94all that\xe2\x80\x99s left of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal better than nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the editor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what is this\r\nwhich is quite in my way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was coming to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thomson: \xe2\x80\x9cFate has put it in my power\r\nto honour your arrival with something really original by way of\r\ndessert. A mystery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mystery?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said his friend, \xe2\x80\x9ca mystery. It may prove to be nothing, and it\r\nmay prove to be a great deal. But in the meanwhile it is truly\r\nmysterious, no eye having looked on it for near a hundred years; it is\r\nhighly genteel, for it treats of a titled family; and it ought to be\r\nmelodramatic, for (according to the superscription) it is concerned\r\nwith death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I rarely heard a more obscure or a more promising\r\nannunciation,\xe2\x80\x9d the other remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what is It?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember my predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s, old Peter M\xe2\x80\x99Brair\xe2\x80\x99s business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember him acutely; he could not look at me without a pang of\r\nreprobation, and he could not feel the pang without betraying it. He\r\nwas to me a man of a great historical interest, but the interest was\r\nnot returned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well, we go beyond him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thomson. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay old Peter\r\nknew as little about this as I do. You see, I succeeded to a prodigious\r\naccumulation of old law-papers and old tin boxes, some of them of\r\nPeter\xe2\x80\x99s hoarding, some of his father\xe2\x80\x99s, John, first of the dynasty, a\r\ngreat man in his day. Among other collections, were all the papers of\r\nthe Durrisdeers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Durrisdeers!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, these may be of the\r\ngreatest interest. One of them was out in the \xe2\x80\x9945; one had some strange\r\npassages with the devil\xe2\x80\x94you will find a note of it in Law\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Memorials_, I think; and there was an unexplained tragedy, I know not\r\nwhat, much later, about a hundred years ago\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than a hundred years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thomson. \xe2\x80\x9cIn 1783.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that? I mean some death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the lamentable deaths of my Lord Durrisdeer and his brother, the\r\nMaster of Ballantrae (attainted in the troubles),\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thomson\r\nwith something the tone of a man quoting. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo say truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have only seen some dim reference to the\r\nthings in memoirs; and heard some traditions dimmer still, through my\r\nuncle (whom I think you knew). My uncle lived when he was a boy in the\r\nneighbourhood of St. Bride\xe2\x80\x99s; he has often told me of the avenue closed\r\nup and grown over with grass, the great gates never opened, the last\r\nlord and his old maid sister who lived in the back parts of the house,\r\na quiet, plain, poor, hum-drum couple it would seem\xe2\x80\x94but pathetic too,\r\nas the last of that stirring and brave house\xe2\x80\x94and, to the country folk,\r\nfaintly terrible from some deformed traditions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thomson. \xe2\x80\x9cHenry Graeme Durie, the last lord, died in\r\n1820; his sister, the honourable Miss Katherine Durie, in \xe2\x80\x9927; so much\r\nI know; and by what I have been going over the last few days, they were\r\nwhat you say, decent, quiet people and not rich. To say truth, it was a\r\nletter of my lord\xe2\x80\x99s that put me on the search for the packet we are\r\ngoing to open this evening. Some papers could not be found; and he\r\nwrote to Jack M\xe2\x80\x99Brair suggesting they might be among those sealed up by\r\na Mr. Mackellar. M\xe2\x80\x99Brair answered, that the papers in question were all\r\nin Mackellar\xe2\x80\x99s own hand, all (as the writer understood) of a purely\r\nnarrative character; and besides, said he, \xe2\x80\x98I am bound not to open them\r\nbefore the year 1889.\xe2\x80\x99 You may fancy if these words struck me: I\r\ninstituted a hunt through all the M\xe2\x80\x99Brair repositories; and at last hit\r\nupon that packet which (if you have had enough wine) I propose to show\r\nyou at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the smoking-room, to which my host now led me, was a packet,\r\nfastened with many seals and enclosed in a single sheet of strong paper\r\nthus endorsed:\r\n\r\n\r\nPapers relating to the lives and lamentable deaths of the late Lord\r\nDurisdeer, and his elder brother James, commonly called Master of\r\nBallantrae, attainted in the troubles: entrusted into the hands of John\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Brair in the Lawnmarket of Edinburgh, W.S.; this 20th day of\r\nSeptember Anno Domini 1789; by him to be kept secret until the\r\nrevolution of one hundred years complete, or until the 20th day of\r\nSeptember 1889: the same compiled and written by me, Ephraim Mackellar,\r\n\r\nFor near forty years Land Steward on the estates of his Lordship.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Thomson is a married man, I will not say what hour had struck\r\nwhen we laid down the last of the following pages; but I will give a\r\nfew words of what ensued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thomson, \xe2\x80\x9cis a novel ready to your hand: all you have\r\nto do is to work up the scenery, develop the characters, and improve\r\nthe style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are just the three things that I would\r\nrather die than set my hand to. It shall be published as it stands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s so bald,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Mr. Thomson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe there is nothing so noble as baldness,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am\r\nsure there is nothing so interesting. I would have all literature bald,\r\nand all authors (if you like) but one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d add Mr. Thomson, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nSUMMARY OF EVENTS DURING THIS MASTER\xe2\x80\x99S WANDERINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full truth of this odd matter is what the world has long been\r\nlooking for, and public curiosity is sure to welcome. It so befell that\r\nI was intimately mingled with the last years and history of the house;\r\nand there does not live one man so able as myself to make these matters\r\nplain, or so desirous to narrate them faithfully. I knew the Master; on\r\nmany secret steps of his career I have an authentic memoir in my hand;\r\nI sailed with him on his last voyage almost alone; I made one upon that\r\nwinter\xe2\x80\x99s journey of which so many tales have gone abroad; and I was\r\nthere at the man\xe2\x80\x99s death. As for my late Lord Durrisdeer, I served him\r\nand loved him near twenty years; and thought more of him the more I\r\nknew of him. Altogether, I think it not fit that so much evidence\r\nshould perish; the truth is a debt I owe my lord\xe2\x80\x99s memory; and I think\r\nmy old years will flow more smoothly, and my white hair lie quieter on\r\nthe pillow, when the debt is paid.\r\n\r\nThe Duries of Durrisdeer and Ballantrae were a strong family in the\r\nsouth-west from the days of David First. A rhyme still current in the\r\ncountryside\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nKittle folk are the Durrisdeers,\r\nThey ride wi\xe2\x80\x99 over mony spears\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nbears the mark of its antiquity; and the name appears in another, which\r\ncommon report attributes to Thomas of Ercildoune himself\xe2\x80\x94I cannot say\r\nhow truly, and which some have applied\xe2\x80\x94I dare not say with how much\r\njustice\xe2\x80\x94to the events of this narration:\r\n\r\nTwa Duries in Durrisdeer,\r\n    Ane to tie and ane to ride,\r\nAn ill day for the groom\r\n    And a waur day for the bride.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthentic history besides is filled with their exploits which (to our\r\nmodern eyes) seem not very commendable: and the family suffered its\r\nfull share of those ups and downs to which the great houses of Scotland\r\nhave been ever liable. But all these I pass over, to come to that\r\nmemorable year 1745, when the foundations of this tragedy were laid.\r\n\r\nAt that time there dwelt a family of four persons in the house of\r\nDurrisdeer, near St. Bride\xe2\x80\x99s, on the Solway shore; a chief hold of\r\ntheir race since the Reformation. My old lord, eighth of the name, was\r\nnot old in years, but he suffered prematurely from the disabilities of\r\nage; his place was at the chimney side; there he sat reading, in a\r\nlined gown, with few words for any man, and wry words for none: the\r\nmodel of an old retired housekeeper; and yet his mind very well\r\nnourished with study, and reputed in the country to be more cunning\r\nthan he seemed. The master of Ballantrae, James in baptism, took from\r\nhis father the love of serious reading; some of his tact perhaps as\r\nwell, but that which was only policy in the father became black\r\ndissimulation in the son. The face of his behaviour was merely popular\r\nand wild: he sat late at wine, later at the cards; had the name in the\r\ncountry of \xe2\x80\x9can unco man for the lasses;\xe2\x80\x9d and was ever in the front of\r\nbroils. But for all he was the first to go in, yet it was observed he\r\nwas invariably the best to come off; and his partners in mischief were\r\nusually alone to pay the piper. This luck or dexterity got him several\r\nill-wishers, but with the rest of the country, enhanced his reputation;\r\nso that great things were looked for in his future, when he should have\r\ngained more gravity. One very black mark he had to his name; but the\r\nmatter was hushed up at the time, and so defaced by legends before I\r\ncame into those parts, that I scruple to set it down. If it was true,\r\nit was a horrid fact in one so young; and if false, it was a horrid\r\ncalumny. I think it notable that he had always vaunted himself quite\r\nimplacable, and was taken at his word; so that he had the addition\r\namong his neighbours of \xe2\x80\x9can ill man to cross.\xe2\x80\x9d Here was altogether a\r\nyoung nobleman (not yet twenty-four in the year \xe2\x80\x9945) who had made a\r\nfigure in the country beyond his time of life. The less marvel if there\r\nwere little heard of the second son, Mr. Henry (my late Lord\r\nDurrisdeer), who was neither very bad nor yet very able, but an honest,\r\nsolid sort of lad like many of his neighbours. Little heard, I say; but\r\nindeed it was a case of little spoken. He was known among the salmon\r\nfishers in the firth, for that was a sport that he assiduously\r\nfollowed; he was an excellent good horse-doctor besides; and took a\r\nchief hand, almost from a boy, in the management of the estates. How\r\nhard a part that was, in the situation of that family, none knows\r\nbetter than myself; nor yet with how little colour of justice a man may\r\nthere acquire the reputation of a tyrant and a miser. The fourth person\r\nin the house was Miss Alison Graeme, a near kinswoman, an orphan, and\r\nthe heir to a considerable fortune which her father had acquired in\r\ntrade. This money was loudly called for by my lord\xe2\x80\x99s necessities;\r\nindeed the land was deeply mortgaged; and Miss Alison was designed\r\naccordingly to be the Master\xe2\x80\x99s wife, gladly enough on her side; with\r\nhow much good-will on his, is another matter. She was a comely girl,\r\nand in those days very spirited and self-willed; for the old lord\r\nhaving no daughter of his own, and my lady being long dead, she had\r\ngrown up as best she might.\r\n\r\nTo these four came the news of Prince Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s landing, and set them\r\npresently by the ears. My lord, like the chimney-keeper that he was,\r\nwas all for temporising. Miss Alison held the other side, because it\r\nappeared romantical; and the Master (though I have heard they did not\r\nagree often) was for this once of her opinion. The adventure tempted\r\nhim, as I conceive; he was tempted by the opportunity to raise the\r\nfortunes of the house, and not less by the hope of paying off his\r\nprivate liabilities, which were heavy beyond all opinion. As for Mr.\r\nHenry, it appears he said little enough at first; his part came later\r\non. It took the three a whole day\xe2\x80\x99s disputation, before they agreed to\r\nsteer a middle course, one son going forth to strike a blow for King\r\nJames, my lord and the other staying at home to keep in favour with\r\nKing George. Doubtless this was my lord\xe2\x80\x99s decision; and, as is well\r\nknown, it was the part played by many considerable families. But the\r\none dispute settled, another opened. For my lord, Miss Alison, and Mr.\r\nHenry all held the one view: that it was the cadet\xe2\x80\x99s part to go out;\r\nand the Master, what with restlessness and vanity, would at no rate\r\nconsent to stay at home. My lord pleaded, Miss Alison wept, Mr. Henry\r\nwas very plain spoken: all was of no avail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the direct heir of Durrisdeer that should ride by his King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbridle,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we were playing a manly part,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry, \xe2\x80\x9cthere might be\r\nsense in such talk. But what are we doing? Cheating at cards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are saving the house of Durrisdeer, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d his father said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd see, James,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry, \xe2\x80\x9cif I go, and the Prince has the\r\nupper hand, it will be easy to make your peace with King James. But if\r\nyou go, and the expedition fails, we divide the right and the title.\r\nAnd what shall I be then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be Lord Durrisdeer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cI put all I have upon\r\nthe table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI play at no such game,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be left in such a\r\nsituation as no man of sense and honour could endure. I shall be\r\nneither fish nor flesh!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. And a little after he had another\r\nexpression, plainer perhaps than he intended. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is your duty to be\r\nhere with my father,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know well enough you are the\r\nfavourite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there spoke Envy! Would you trip up my\r\nheels\xe2\x80\x94Jacob?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and dwelled upon the name maliciously.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry went and walked at the low end of the hall without reply; for\r\nhe had an excellent gift of silence. Presently he came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the cadet and I _should_ go,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my lord here is the\r\nmaster, and he says I _shall_ go. What say ye to that, my brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say this, Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Master, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when very obstinate\r\nfolk are met, there are only two ways out: Blows\xe2\x80\x94and I think none of us\r\ncould care to go so far; or the arbitrament of chance\xe2\x80\x94and here is a\r\nguinea piece. Will you stand by the toss of the coin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will stand and fall by it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cHeads, I go; shield, I\r\nstay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe coin was spun, and it fell shield. \xe2\x80\x9cSo there is a lesson for\r\nJacob,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall live to repent of this,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry, and flung out of the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Alison, she caught up that piece of gold which had just\r\nsent her lover to the wars, and flung it clean through the family\r\nshield in the great painted window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you loved me as well as I love you, you would have stayed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nshe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I could not love you, dear, so well, loved I not honour more,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d sang\r\nthe Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have no heart\xe2\x80\x94I hope you may be killed!\xe2\x80\x9d and she\r\nran from the room, and in tears, to her own chamber.\r\n\r\nIt seems the Master turned to my lord with his most comical manner, and\r\nsays he, \xe2\x80\x9cThis looks like a devil of a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are a devil of a son to me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried his father, \xe2\x80\x9cyou that\r\nhave always been the favourite, to my shame be it spoken. Never a good\r\nhour have I gotten of you, since you were born; no, never one good\r\nhour,\xe2\x80\x9d and repeated it again the third time. Whether it was the\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s levity, or his insubordination, or Mr. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s word about the\r\nfavourite son, that had so much disturbed my lord, I do not know; but I\r\nincline to think it was the last, for I have it by all accounts that\r\nMr. Henry was more made up to from that hour.\r\n\r\nAltogether it was in pretty ill blood with his family that the Master\r\nrode to the North; which was the more sorrowful for others to remember\r\nwhen it seemed too late. By fear and favour he had scraped together\r\nnear upon a dozen men, principally tenants\xe2\x80\x99 sons; they were all pretty\r\nfull when they set forth, and rode up the hill by the old abbey,\r\nroaring and singing, the white cockade in every hat. It was a desperate\r\nventure for so small a company to cross the most of Scotland\r\nunsupported; and (what made folk think so the more) even as that poor\r\ndozen was clattering up the hill, a great ship of the king\xe2\x80\x99s navy, that\r\ncould have brought them under with a single boat, lay with her broad\r\nensign streaming in the bay. The next afternoon, having given the\r\nMaster a fair start, it was Mr. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s turn; and he rode off, all by\r\nhimself, to offer his sword and carry letters from his father to King\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s Government. Miss Alison was shut in her room, and did little\r\nbut weep, till both were gone; only she stitched the cockade upon the\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s hat, and (as John Paul told me) it was wetted with tears when\r\nhe carried it down to him.\r\n\r\nIn all that followed, Mr. Henry and my old lord were true to their\r\nbargain. That ever they accomplished anything is more than I could\r\nlearn; and that they were anyway strong on the king\xe2\x80\x99s side, more than\r\nbelieve. But they kept the letter of loyalty, corresponded with my Lord\r\nPresident, sat still at home, and had little or no commerce with the\r\nMaster while that business lasted. Nor was he, on his side, more\r\ncommunicative. Miss Alison, indeed, was always sending him expresses,\r\nbut I do not know if she had many answers. Macconochie rode for her\r\nonce, and found the highlanders before Carlisle, and the Master riding\r\nby the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s side in high favour; he took the letter (so Macconochie\r\ntells), opened it, glanced it through with a mouth like a man\r\nwhistling, and stuck it in his belt, whence, on his horse passageing,\r\nit fell unregarded to the ground. It was Macconochie who picked it up;\r\nand he still kept it, and indeed I have seen it in his hands. News came\r\nto Durrisdeer of course, by the common report, as it goes travelling\r\nthrough a country, a thing always wonderful to me. By that means the\r\nfamily learned more of the Master\xe2\x80\x99s favour with the Prince, and the\r\nground it was said to stand on: for by a strange condescension in a man\r\nso proud\xe2\x80\x94only that he was a man still more ambitious\xe2\x80\x94he was said to\r\nhave crept into notability by truckling to the Irish. Sir Thomas\r\nSullivan, Colonel Burke and the rest, were his daily comrades, by which\r\ncourse he withdrew himself from his own country-folk. All the small\r\nintrigues he had a hand in fomenting; thwarted my Lord George upon a\r\nthousand points; was always for the advice that seemed palatable to the\r\nPrince, no matter if it was good or bad; and seems upon the whole (like\r\nthe gambler he was all through life) to have had less regard to the\r\nchances of the campaign than to the greatness of favour he might aspire\r\nto, if, by any luck, it should succeed. For the rest, he did very well\r\nin the field; no one questioned that; for he was no coward.\r\n\r\nThe next was the news of Culloden, which was brought to Durrisdeer by\r\none of the tenants\xe2\x80\x99 sons\xe2\x80\x94the only survivor, he declared, of all those\r\nthat had gone singing up the hill. By an unfortunate chance John Paul\r\nand Macconochie had that very morning found the guinea piece\xe2\x80\x94which was\r\nthe root of all the evil\xe2\x80\x94sticking in a holly bush; they had been \xe2\x80\x9cup\r\nthe gait,\xe2\x80\x9d as the servants say at Durrisdeer, to the change-house; and\r\nif they had little left of the guinea, they had less of their wits.\r\nWhat must John Paul do but burst into the hall where the family sat at\r\ndinner, and cry the news to them that \xe2\x80\x9cTam Macmorland was but new\r\nlichtit at the door, and\xe2\x80\x94wirra, wirra\xe2\x80\x94there were nane to come behind\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x9d?\r\n\r\nThey took the word in silence like folk condemned; only Mr. Henry\r\ncarrying his palm to his face, and Miss Alison laying her head outright\r\nupon her hands. As for my lord, he was like ashes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have still one son,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, Henry, I will do you this\r\njustice\xe2\x80\x94it is the kinder that is left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a strange thing to say in such a moment; but my lord had never\r\nforgotten Mr. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s speech, and he had years of injustice on his\r\nconscience. Still it was a strange thing, and more than Miss Alison\r\ncould let pass. She broke out and blamed my lord for his unnatural\r\nwords, and Mr. Henry because he was sitting there in safety when his\r\nbrother lay dead, and herself because she had given her sweetheart ill\r\nwords at his departure, calling him the flower of the flock, wringing\r\nher hands, protesting her love, and crying on him by his name\xe2\x80\x94so that\r\nthe servants stood astonished.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry got to his feet, and stood holding his chair. It was he that\r\nwas like ashes now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you loved him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe world knows that, glory be to God!\xe2\x80\x9d cries she; and then to Mr.\r\nHenry: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is none but me to know one thing\xe2\x80\x94that you were a traitor\r\nto him in your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows,\xe2\x80\x9d groans he, \xe2\x80\x9cit was lost love on both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTime went by in the house after that without much change; only they\r\nwere now three instead of four, which was a perpetual reminder of their\r\nloss. Miss Alison\xe2\x80\x99s money, you are to bear in mind, was highly needful\r\nfor the estates; and the one brother being dead, my old lord soon set\r\nhis heart upon her marrying the other. Day in, day out, he would work\r\nupon her, sitting by the chimney-side with his finger in his Latin\r\nbook, and his eyes set upon her face with a kind of pleasant intentness\r\nthat became the old gentleman very well. If she wept, he would condole\r\nwith her like an ancient man that has seen worse times and begins to\r\nthink lightly even of sorrow; if she raged, he would fall to reading\r\nagain in his Latin book, but always with some civil excuse; if she\r\noffered, as she often did, to let them have her money in a gift, he\r\nwould show her how little it consisted with his honour, and remind her,\r\neven if he should consent, that Mr. Henry would certainly refuse. _Non\r\nvi sed s\xc3\xa6pe cadendo_ was a favourite word of his; and no doubt this\r\nquiet persecution wore away much of her resolve; no doubt, besides, he\r\nhad a great influence on the girl, having stood in the place of both\r\nher parents; and, for that matter, she was herself filled with the\r\nspirit of the Duries, and would have gone a great way for the glory of\r\nDurrisdeer; but not so far, I think, as to marry my poor patron, had it\r\nnot been\xe2\x80\x94strangely enough\xe2\x80\x94for the circumstance of his extreme\r\nunpopularity.\r\n\r\nThis was the work of Tam Macmorland. There was not much harm in Tam;\r\nbut he had that grievous weakness, a long tongue; and as the only man\r\nin that country who had been out\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, who had come in again\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwas sure of listeners. Those that have the underhand in any fighting, I\r\nhave observed, are ever anxious to persuade themselves they were\r\nbetrayed. By Tam\xe2\x80\x99s account of it, the rebels had been betrayed at every\r\nturn and by every officer they had; they had been betrayed at Derby,\r\nand betrayed at Falkirk; the night march was a step of treachery of my\r\nLord George\xe2\x80\x99s; and Culloden was lost by the treachery of the\r\nMacdonalds. This habit of imputing treason grew upon the fool, till at\r\nlast he must have in Mr. Henry also. Mr. Henry (by his account) had\r\nbetrayed the lads of Durrisdeer; he had promised to follow with more\r\nmen, and instead of that he had ridden to King George. \xe2\x80\x9cAy, and the\r\nnext day!\xe2\x80\x9d Tam would cry. \xe2\x80\x9cThe puir bonnie Master, and the puir, kind\r\nlads that rade wi\xe2\x80\x99 him, were hardly ower the scaur, or he was aff\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nJudis! Ay, weel\xe2\x80\x94he has his way o\xe2\x80\x99t: he\xe2\x80\x99s to be my lord, nae less, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s mony a cold corp amang the Hieland heather!\xe2\x80\x9d And at this, if\r\nTam had been drinking, he would begin to weep.\r\n\r\nLet anyone speak long enough, he will get believers. This view of Mr.\r\nHenry\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour crept about the country by little and little; it was\r\ntalked upon by folk that knew the contrary, but were short of topics;\r\nand it was heard and believed and given out for gospel by the ignorant\r\nand the ill-willing. Mr. Henry began to be shunned; yet awhile, and the\r\ncommons began to murmur as he went by, and the women (who are always\r\nthe most bold because they are the most safe) to cry out their\r\nreproaches to his face. The Master was cried up for a saint. It was\r\nremembered how he had never any hand in pressing the tenants; as,\r\nindeed, no more he had, except to spend the money. He was a little wild\r\nperhaps, the folk said; but how much better was a natural, wild lad\r\nthat would soon have settled down, than a skinflint and a sneckdraw,\r\nsitting, with his nose in an account book, to persecute poor tenants!\r\nOne trollop, who had had a child to the Master, and by all accounts\r\nbeen very badly used, yet made herself a kind of champion of his\r\nmemory. She flung a stone one day at Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhaur\xe2\x80\x99s the bonnie lad that trustit ye?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry reined in his horse and looked upon her, the blood flowing\r\nfrom his lip. \xe2\x80\x9cAy, Jess?\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou too? And yet ye should ken me\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d For it was he who had helped her with money.\r\n\r\nThe woman had another stone ready, which she made as if she would cast;\r\nand he, to ward himself, threw up the hand that held his riding-rod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, would ye beat a lassie, ye ugly\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d cries she, and ran away\r\nscreaming as though he had struck her.\r\n\r\nNext day word went about the country like wildfire that Mr. Henry had\r\nbeaten Jessie Broun within an inch of her life. I give it as one\r\ninstance of how this snowball grew, and one calumny brought another;\r\nuntil my poor patron was so perished in reputation that he began to\r\nkeep the house like my lord. All this while, you may be very sure, he\r\nuttered no complaints at home; the very ground of the scandal was too\r\nsore a matter to be handled; and Mr. Henry was very proud and strangely\r\nobstinate in silence. My old lord must have heard of it, by John Paul,\r\nif by no one else; and he must at least have remarked the altered\r\nhabits of his son. Yet even he, it is probable, knew not how high the\r\nfeeling ran; and as for Miss Alison, she was ever the last person to\r\nhear news, and the least interested when she heard them.\r\n\r\nIn the height of the ill-feeling (for it died away as it came, no man\r\ncould say why) there was an election forward in the town of St.\r\nBride\xe2\x80\x99s, which is the next to Durrisdeer, standing on the Water of\r\nSwift; some grievance was fermenting, I forget what, if ever I heard;\r\nand it was currently said there would be broken heads ere night, and\r\nthat the sheriff had sent as far as Dumfries for soldiers. My lord\r\nmoved that Mr. Henry should be present, assuring him it was necessary\r\nto appear, for the credit of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will soon be reported,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we do not take the lead in our own country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a strange lead that I can take,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry; and when they\r\nhad pushed him further, \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you the plain truth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI dare\r\nnot show my face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the first of the house that ever said so,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Miss Alison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will go all three,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord; and sure enough he got into his\r\nboots (the first time in four years\xe2\x80\x94a sore business John Paul had to\r\nget them on), and Miss Alison into her riding-coat, and all three rode\r\ntogether to St. Bride\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe streets were full of the riff-raff of all the countryside, who had\r\nno sooner clapped eyes on Mr. Henry than the hissing began, and the\r\nhooting, and the cries of \xe2\x80\x9cJudas!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhere was the Master?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere were the poor lads that rode with him?\xe2\x80\x9d Even a stone was cast;\r\nbut the more part cried shame at that, for my old lord\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and Miss\r\nAlison\xe2\x80\x99s. It took not ten minutes to persuade my lord that Mr. Henry\r\nhad been right. He said never a word, but turned his horse about, and\r\nhome again, with his chin upon his bosom. Never a word said Miss\r\nAlison; no doubt she thought the more; no doubt her pride was stung,\r\nfor she was a bone-bred Durie; and no doubt her heart was touched to\r\nsee her cousin so unjustly used. That night she was never in bed; I\r\nhave often blamed my lady\xe2\x80\x94when I call to mind that night, I readily\r\nforgive her all; and the first thing in the morning she came to the old\r\nlord in his usual seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Henry still wants me,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9che can have me now.\xe2\x80\x9d To himself\r\nshe had a different speech: \xe2\x80\x9cI bring you no love, Henry; but God knows,\r\nall the pity in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJune the 1st, 1748, was the day of their marriage. It was December of\r\nthe same year that first saw me alighting at the doors of the great\r\nhouse; and from there I take up the history of events as they befell\r\nunder my own observation, like a witness in a court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nSUMMARY OF EVENTS (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nI made the last of my journey in the cold end of December, in a mighty\r\ndry day of frost, and who should be my guide but Patey Macmorland,\r\nbrother of Tam! For a tow-headed, bare-legged brat of ten, he had more\r\nill tales upon his tongue than ever I heard the match of; having\r\ndrunken betimes in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s cup. I was still not so old myself;\r\npride had not yet the upper hand of curiosity; and indeed it would have\r\ntaken any man, that cold morning, to hear all the old clashes of the\r\ncountry, and be shown all the places by the way where strange things\r\nhad fallen out. I had tales of Claverhouse as we came through the bogs,\r\nand tales of the devil, as we came over the top of the scaur. As we\r\ncame in by the abbey I heard somewhat of the old monks, and more of the\r\nfreetraders, who use its ruins for a magazine, landing for that cause\r\nwithin a cannon-shot of Durrisdeer; and along all the road the Duries\r\nand poor Mr. Henry were in the first rank of slander. My mind was thus\r\nhighly prejudiced against the family I was about to serve, so that I\r\nwas half surprised when I beheld Durrisdeer itself, lying in a pretty,\r\nsheltered bay, under the Abbey Hill; the house most commodiously built\r\nin the French fashion, or perhaps Italianate, for I have no skill in\r\nthese arts; and the place the most beautified with gardens, lawns,\r\nshrubberies, and trees I had ever seen. The money sunk here\r\nunproductively would have quite restored the family; but as it was, it\r\ncost a revenue to keep it up.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry came himself to the door to welcome me: a tall dark young\r\ngentleman (the Duries are all black men) of a plain and not cheerful\r\nface, very strong in body, but not so strong in health: taking me by\r\nthe hand without any pride, and putting me at home with plain kind\r\nspeeches. He led me into the hall, booted as I was, to present me to my\r\nlord. It was still daylight; and the first thing I observed was a\r\nlozenge of clear glass in the midst of the shield in the painted\r\nwindow, which I remember thinking a blemish on a room otherwise so\r\nhandsome, with its family portraits, and the pargeted ceiling with\r\npendants, and the carved chimney, in one corner of which my old lord\r\nsat reading in his Livy. He was like Mr. Henry, with much the same\r\nplain countenance, only more subtle and pleasant, and his talk a\r\nthousand times more entertaining. He had many questions to ask me, I\r\nremember, of Edinburgh College, where I had just received my mastership\r\nof arts, and of the various professors, with whom and their proficiency\r\nhe seemed well acquainted; and thus, talking of things that I knew, I\r\nsoon got liberty of speech in my new home.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this came Mrs. Henry into the room; she was very far\r\ngone, Miss Katharine being due in about six weeks, which made me think\r\nless of her beauty at the first sight; and she used me with more of\r\ncondescension than the rest; so that, upon all accounts, I kept her in\r\nthe third place of my esteem.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long before all Patey Macmorland\xe2\x80\x99s tales were blotted\r\nout of my belief, and I was become, what I have ever since remained, a\r\nloving servant of the house of Durrisdeer. Mr. Henry had the chief part\r\nof my affection. It was with him I worked; and I found him an exacting\r\nmaster, keeping all his kindness for those hours in which we were\r\nunemployed, and in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office not only loading me with work,\r\nbut viewing me with a shrewd supervision. At length one day he looked\r\nup from his paper with a kind of timidness, and says he, \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nMackellar, I think I ought to tell you that you do very well.\xe2\x80\x9d That was\r\nmy first word of commendation; and from that day his jealousy of my\r\nperformance was relaxed; soon it was \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mackellar\xe2\x80\x9d here, and \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nMackellar\xe2\x80\x9d there, with the whole family; and for much of my service at\r\nDurrisdeer, I have transacted everything at my own time, and to my own\r\nfancy, and never a farthing challenged. Even while he was driving me, I\r\nhad begun to find my heart go out to Mr. Henry; no doubt, partly in\r\npity, he was a man so palpably unhappy. He would fall into a deep muse\r\nover our accounts, staring at the page or out of the window; and at\r\nthose times the look of his face, and the sigh that would break from\r\nhim, awoke in me strong feelings of curiosity and commiseration. One\r\nday, I remember, we were late upon some business in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nThis room is in the top of the house, and has a view upon the bay, and\r\nover a little wooded cape, on the long sands; and there, right over\r\nagainst the sun, which was then dipping, we saw the freetraders, with a\r\ngreat force of men and horses, scouring on the beach. Mr. Henry had\r\nbeen staring straight west, so that I marvelled he was not blinded by\r\nthe sun; suddenly he frowns, rubs his hand upon his brow, and turns to\r\nme with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would not guess what I was thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking I\r\nwould be a happier man if I could ride and run the danger of my life,\r\nwith these lawless companions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him I had observed he did not enjoy good spirits; and that it\r\nwas a common fancy to envy others and think we should be the better of\r\nsome change; quoting Horace to the point, like a young man fresh from\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, just so,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd with that we may get back to our\r\naccounts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not long before I began to get wind of the causes that so much\r\ndepressed him. Indeed a blind man must have soon discovered there was a\r\nshadow on that house, the shadow of the Master of Ballantrae. Dead or\r\nalive (and he was then supposed to be dead) that man was his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrival: his rival abroad, where there was never a good word for Mr.\r\nHenry, and nothing but regret and praise for the Master; and his rival\r\nat home, not only with his father and his wife, but with the very\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nThey were two old serving-men that were the leaders. John Paul, a\r\nlittle, bald, solemn, stomachy man, a great professor of piety and\r\n(take him for all in all) a pretty faithful servant, was the chief of\r\nthe Master\xe2\x80\x99s faction. None durst go so far as John. He took a pleasure\r\nin disregarding Mr. Henry publicly, often with a slighting comparison.\r\nMy lord and Mrs. Henry took him up, to be sure, but never so resolutely\r\nas they should; and he had only to pull his weeping face and begin his\r\nlamentations for the Master\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chis laddie,\xe2\x80\x9d as he called him\xe2\x80\x94to have the\r\nwhole condoned. As for Henry, he let these things pass in silence,\r\nsometimes with a sad and sometimes with a black look. There was no\r\nrivalling the dead, he knew that; and how to censure an old serving-man\r\nfor a fault of loyalty, was more than he could see. His was not the\r\ntongue to do it.\r\n\r\nMacconochie was chief upon the other side; an old, ill-spoken,\r\nswearing, ranting, drunken dog; and I have often thought it an odd\r\ncircumstance in human nature that these two serving-men should each\r\nhave been the champion of his contrary, and blackened their own faults\r\nand made light of their own virtues when they beheld them in a master.\r\nMacconochie had soon smelled out my secret inclination, took me much\r\ninto his confidence, and would rant against the Master by the hour, so\r\nthat even my work suffered. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re a\xe2\x80\x99 daft here,\xe2\x80\x9d he would cry, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nbe damned to them! The Master\xe2\x80\x94the deil\xe2\x80\x99s in their thrapples that should\r\ncall him sae! it\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Henry should be master now! They were nane sae\r\nfond o\xe2\x80\x99 the Master when they had him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll can tell ye that. Sorrow on\r\nhis name! Never a guid word did I hear on his lips, nor naebody else,\r\nbut just fleering and flyting and profane cursing\xe2\x80\x94deil hae him! There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnane kent his wickedness: him a gentleman! Did ever ye hear tell, Mr.\r\nMackellar, o\xe2\x80\x99 Wully White the wabster? No? Aweel, Wully was an unco\r\npraying kind o\xe2\x80\x99 man; a dreigh body, nane o\xe2\x80\x99 my kind, I never could\r\nabide the sight o\xe2\x80\x99 him; onyway he was a great hand by his way of it,\r\nand he up and rebukit the Master for some of his on-goings. It was a\r\ngrand thing for the Master o\xe2\x80\x99 Ball\xe2\x80\x99ntrae to tak up a feud wi\xe2\x80\x99 a\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwabster, wasnae\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d Macconochie would sneer; indeed, he never took the\r\nfull name upon his lips but with a sort of a whine of hatred. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he\r\ndid! A fine employ it was: chapping at the man\xe2\x80\x99s door, and crying \xe2\x80\x98boo\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin his lum, and puttin\xe2\x80\x99 poother in his fire, and pee-oys [1] in his\r\nwindow; till the man thocht it was auld Hornie was come seekin\xe2\x80\x99 him.\r\nWeel, to mak a lang story short, Wully gaed gyte. At the hinder end,\r\nthey couldnae get him frae his knees, but he just roared and prayed and\r\ngrat straucht on, till he got his release. It was fair murder, a\xe2\x80\x99body\r\nsaid that. Ask John Paul\xe2\x80\x94he was brawly ashamed o\xe2\x80\x99 that game, him that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsic a Christian man! Grand doin\xe2\x80\x99s for the Master o\xe2\x80\x99 Ball\xe2\x80\x99ntrae!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nasked him what the Master had thought of it himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHow would I ken?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays he. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never said naething.\xe2\x80\x9d And on again in his usual manner of\r\nbanning and swearing, with every now and again a \xe2\x80\x9cMaster of Ballantrae\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsneered through his nose. It was in one of these confidences that he\r\nshowed me the Carlisle letter, the print of the horse-shoe still\r\nstamped in the paper. Indeed, that was our last confidence; for he then\r\nexpressed himself so ill-naturedly of Mrs. Henry that I had to\r\nreprimand him sharply, and must thenceforth hold him at a distance.\r\n\r\nMy old lord was uniformly kind to Mr. Henry; he had even pretty ways of\r\ngratitude, and would sometimes clap him on the shoulder and say, as if\r\nto the world at large: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very good son to me.\xe2\x80\x9d And grateful he\r\nwas, no doubt, being a man of sense and justice. But I think that was\r\nall, and I am sure Mr. Henry thought so. The love was all for the dead\r\nson. Not that this was often given breath to; indeed, with me but once.\r\nMy lord had asked me one day how I got on with Mr. Henry, and I had\r\ntold him the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking sideways on the burning fire, \xe2\x80\x9cHenry is a good\r\nlad, a very good lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard, Mr. Mackellar, that I\r\nhad another son? I am afraid he was not so virtuous a lad as Mr. Henry;\r\nbut dear me, he\xe2\x80\x99s dead, Mr. Mackellar! and while he lived we were all\r\nvery proud of him, all very proud. If he was not all he should have\r\nbeen in some ways, well, perhaps we loved him better!\xe2\x80\x9d This last he\r\nsaid looking musingly in the fire; and then to me, with a great deal of\r\nbriskness, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am rejoiced you do so well with Mr. Henry. You will\r\nfind him a good master.\xe2\x80\x9d And with that he opened his book, which was\r\nthe customary signal of dismission. But it would be little that he\r\nread, and less that he understood; Culloden field and the Master, these\r\nwould be the burthen of his thought; and the burthen of mine was an\r\nunnatural jealousy of the dead man for Mr. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that had even\r\nthen begun to grow on me.\r\n\r\nI am keeping Mrs. Henry for the last, so that this expression of my\r\nsentiment may seem unwarrantably strong: the reader shall judge for\r\nhimself when I have done. But I must first tell of another matter,\r\nwhich was the means of bringing me more intimate. I had not yet been\r\nsix months at Durrisdeer when it chanced that John Paul fell sick and\r\nmust keep his bed; drink was the root of his malady, in my poor\r\nthought; but he was tended, and indeed carried himself, like an\r\nafflicted saint; and the very minister, who came to visit him,\r\nprofessed himself edified when he went away. The third morning of his\r\nsickness, Mr. Henry comes to me with something of a hang-dog look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could trouble you upon a little\r\nservice. There is a pension we pay; it is John\xe2\x80\x99s part to carry it, and\r\nnow that he is sick I know not to whom I should look unless it was\r\nyourself. The matter is very delicate; I could not carry it with my own\r\nhand for a sufficient reason; I dare not send Macconochie, who is a\r\ntalker, and I am\xe2\x80\x94I have\xe2\x80\x94I am desirous this should not come to Mrs.\r\nHenry\xe2\x80\x99s ears,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, and flushed to his neck as he said it.\r\n\r\nTo say truth, when I found I was to carry money to one Jessie Broun,\r\nwho was no better than she should be, I supposed it was some trip of\r\nhis own that Mr. Henry was dissembling. I was the more impressed when\r\nthe truth came out.\r\n\r\nIt was up a wynd off a side street in St. Bride\xe2\x80\x99s that Jessie had her\r\nlodging. The place was very ill inhabited, mostly by the freetrading\r\nsort. There was a man with a broken head at the entry; half-way up, in\r\na tavern, fellows were roaring and singing, though it was not yet nine\r\nin the day. Altogether, I had never seen a worse neighbourhood, even in\r\nthe great city of Edinburgh, and I was in two minds to go back.\r\nJessie\xe2\x80\x99s room was of a piece with her surroundings, and herself no\r\nbetter. She would not give me the receipt (which Mr. Henry had told me\r\nto demand, for he was very methodical) until she had sent out for\r\nspirits, and I had pledged her in a glass; and all the time she carried\r\non in a light-headed, reckless way\xe2\x80\x94now aping the manners of a lady, now\r\nbreaking into unseemly mirth, now making coquettish advances that\r\noppressed me to the ground. Of the money she spoke more tragically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blood money!\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cI take it for that: blood money for the\r\nbetrayed! See what I\xe2\x80\x99m brought down to! Ah, if the bonnie lad were back\r\nagain, it would be changed days. But he\xe2\x80\x99s deid\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s lyin\xe2\x80\x99 deid amang\r\nthe Hieland hills\xe2\x80\x94the bonnie lad, the bonnie lad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had a rapt manner of crying on the bonnie lad, clasping her hands\r\nand casting up her eyes, that I think she must have learned of\r\nstrolling players; and I thought her sorrow very much of an\r\naffectation, and that she dwelled upon the business because her shame\r\nwas now all she had to be proud of. I will not say I did not pity her,\r\nbut it was a loathing pity at the best; and her last change of manner\r\nwiped it out. This was when she had had enough of me for an audience,\r\nand had set her name at last to the receipt. \xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d says she, and\r\ntaking the most unwomanly oaths upon her tongue, bade me begone and\r\ncarry it to the Judas who had sent me. It was the first time I had\r\nheard the name applied to Mr. Henry; I was staggered besides at her\r\nsudden vehemence of word and manner, and got forth from the room, under\r\nthis shower of curses, like a beaten dog. But even then I was not quit,\r\nfor the vixen threw up her window, and, leaning forth, continued to\r\nrevile me as I went up the wynd; the freetraders, coming to the tavern\r\ndoor, joined in the mockery, and one had even the inhumanity to set\r\nupon me a very savage small dog, which bit me in the ankle. This was a\r\nstrong lesson, had I required one, to avoid ill company; and I rode\r\nhome in much pain from the bite and considerable indignation of mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry was in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s room, affecting employment, but I could\r\nsee he was only impatient to hear of my errand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d says he, as soon as I came in; and when I had told him\r\nsomething of what passed, and that Jessie seemed an undeserving woman\r\nand far from grateful: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is no friend to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, indeed,\r\nMackellar, I have few friends to boast of, and Jessie has some cause to\r\nbe unjust. I need not dissemble what all the country knows: she was not\r\nvery well used by one of our family.\xe2\x80\x9d This was the first time I had\r\nheard him refer to the Master even distantly; and I think he found his\r\ntongue rebellious even for that much, but presently he resumed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nwhy I would have nothing said. It would give pain to Mrs. Henry . . .\r\nand to my father,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with another flush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif you will take a freedom at my hands, I would\r\ntell you to let that woman be. What service is your money to the like\r\nof her? She has no sobriety and no economy\xe2\x80\x94as for gratitude, you will\r\nas soon get milk from a whinstone; and if you will pretermit your\r\nbounty, it will make no change at all but just to save the ankles of\r\nyour messengers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Henry smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am grieved about your ankle,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, the\r\nnext moment, with a proper gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd observe,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI give you this advice upon consideration;\r\nand yet my heart was touched for the woman in the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there it is, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are to remember\r\nthat I knew her once a very decent lass. Besides which, although I\r\nspeak little of my family, I think much of its repute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with that he broke up the talk, which was the first we had together\r\nin such confidence. But the same afternoon I had the proof that his\r\nfather was perfectly acquainted with the business, and that it was only\r\nfrom his wife that Mr. Henry kept it secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear you had a painful errand to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord to me, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nwhich, as it enters in no way among your duties, I wish to thank you,\r\nand to remind you at the same time (in case Mr. Henry should have\r\nneglected) how very desirable it is that no word of it should reach my\r\ndaughter. Reflections on the dead, Mr. Mackellar, are doubly painful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnger glowed in my heart; and I could have told my lord to his face how\r\nlittle he had to do, bolstering up the image of the dead in Mrs.\r\nHenry\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and how much better he were employed to shatter that\r\nfalse idol; for by this time I saw very well how the land lay between\r\nmy patron and his wife.\r\n\r\nMy pen is clear enough to tell a plain tale; but to render the effect\r\nof an infinity of small things, not one great enough in itself to be\r\nnarrated; and to translate the story of looks, and the message of\r\nvoices when they are saying no great matter; and to put in half a page\r\nthe essence of near eighteen months\xe2\x80\x94this is what I despair to\r\naccomplish. The fault, to be very blunt, lay all in Mrs. Henry. She\r\nfelt it a merit to have consented to the marriage, and she took it like\r\na martyrdom; in which my old lord, whether he knew it or not, fomented\r\nher. She made a merit, besides, of her constancy to the dead, though\r\nits name, to a nicer conscience, should have seemed rather disloyalty\r\nto the living; and here also my lord gave her his countenance. I\r\nsuppose he was glad to talk of his loss, and ashamed to dwell on it\r\nwith Mr. Henry. Certainly, at least, he made a little coterie apart in\r\nthat family of three, and it was the husband who was shut out. It seems\r\nit was an old custom when the family were alone in Durrisdeer, that my\r\nlord should take his wine to the chimney-side, and Miss Alison, instead\r\nof withdrawing, should bring a stool to his knee, and chatter to him\r\nprivately; and after she had become my patron\xe2\x80\x99s wife the same manner of\r\ndoing was continued. It should have been pleasant to behold this\r\nancient gentleman so loving with his daughter, but I was too much a\r\npartisan of Mr. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s to be anything but wroth at his exclusion.\r\nMany\xe2\x80\x99s the time I have seen him make an obvious resolve, quit the\r\ntable, and go and join himself to his wife and my Lord Durrisdeer; and\r\non their part, they were never backward to make him welcome, turned to\r\nhim smilingly as to an intruding child, and took him into their talk\r\nwith an effort so ill-concealed that he was soon back again beside me\r\nat the table, whence (so great is the hall of Durrisdeer) we could but\r\nhear the murmur of voices at the chimney. There he would sit and watch,\r\nand I along with him; and sometimes by my lord\xe2\x80\x99s head sorrowfully\r\nshaken, or his hand laid on Mrs. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s head, or hers upon his knee as\r\nif in consolation, or sometimes by an exchange of tearful looks, we\r\nwould draw our conclusion that the talk had gone to the old subject and\r\nthe shadow of the dead was in the hall.\r\n\r\nI have hours when I blame Mr. Henry for taking all too patiently; yet\r\nwe are to remember he was married in pity, and accepted his wife upon\r\nthat term. And, indeed, he had small encouragement to make a stand.\r\nOnce, I remember, he announced he had found a man to replace the pane\r\nof the stained window, which, as it was he that managed all the\r\nbusiness, was a thing clearly within his attributions. But to the\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s fancies, that pane was like a relic; and on the first word of\r\nany change, the blood flew to Mrs. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder at you!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder at myself,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry, with more of bitterness than I\r\nhad ever heard him to express.\r\n\r\nThereupon my old lord stepped in with his smooth talk, so that before\r\nthe meal was at an end all seemed forgotten; only that, after dinner,\r\nwhen the pair had withdrawn as usual to the chimney-side, we could see\r\nher weeping with her head upon his knee. Mr. Henry kept up the talk\r\nwith me upon some topic of the estates\xe2\x80\x94he could speak of little else\r\nbut business, and was never the best of company; but he kept it up that\r\nday with more continuity, his eye straying ever and again to the\r\nchimney, and his voice changing to another key, but without check of\r\ndelivery. The pane, however, was not replaced; and I believe he counted\r\nit a great defeat.\r\n\r\nWhether he was stout enough or no, God knows he was kind enough. Mrs.\r\nHenry had a manner of condescension with him, such as (in a wife) would\r\nhave pricked my vanity into an ulcer; he took it like a favour. She\r\nheld him at the staff\xe2\x80\x99s end; forgot and then remembered and unbent to\r\nhim, as we do to children; burthened him with cold kindness; reproved\r\nhim with a change of colour and a bitten lip, like one shamed by his\r\ndisgrace: ordered him with a look of the eye, when she was off her\r\nguard; when she was on the watch, pleaded with him for the most natural\r\nattentions, as though they were unheard-of favours. And to all this he\r\nreplied with the most unwearied service, loving, as folk say, the very\r\nground she trod on, and carrying that love in his eyes as bright as a\r\nlamp. When Miss Katharine was to be born, nothing would serve but he\r\nmust stay in the room behind the head of the bed. There he sat, as\r\nwhite (they tell me) as a sheet, and the sweat dropping from his brow;\r\nand the handkerchief he had in his hand was crushed into a little ball\r\nno bigger than a musket-bullet. Nor could he bear the sight of Miss\r\nKatharine for many a day; indeed, I doubt if he was ever what he should\r\nhave been to my young lady; for the which want of natural feeling he\r\nwas loudly blamed.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of this family down to the 7th April, 1749, when\r\nthere befell the first of that series of events which were to break so\r\nmany hearts and lose so many lives.\r\n\r\n On that day I was sitting in my room a little before supper, when John\r\n Paul burst open the door with no civility of knocking, and told me\r\n there was one below that wished to speak with the steward; sneering at\r\n the name of my office.\r\n\r\nI asked what manner of man, and what his name was; and this disclosed\r\nthe cause of John\xe2\x80\x99s ill-humour; for it appeared the visitor refused to\r\nname himself except to me, a sore affront to the major-domo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, smiling a little, \xe2\x80\x9cI will see what he wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI found in the entrance hall a big man, very plainly habited, and\r\nwrapped in a sea-cloak, like one new landed, as indeed he was. Not, far\r\noff Macconochie was standing, with his tongue out of his mouth and his\r\nhand upon his chin, like a dull fellow thinking hard; and the stranger,\r\nwho had brought his cloak about his face, appeared uneasy. He had no\r\nsooner seen me coming than he went to meet me with an effusive manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ca thousand apologies for disturbing you, but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m in the most awkward position. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a son of a ramrod there\r\nthat I should know the looks of, and more betoken I believe that he\r\nknows mine. Being in this family, sir, and in a place of some\r\nresponsibility (which was the cause I took the liberty to send for\r\nyou), you are doubtless of the honest party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be sure at least,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat all of that party are quite\r\nsafe in Durrisdeer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man, it is my very thought,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I have just\r\nbeen set on shore here by a very honest man, whose name I cannot\r\nremember, and who is to stand off and on for me till morning, at some\r\ndanger to himself; and, to be clear with you, I am a little concerned\r\nlest it should be at some to me. I have saved my life so often, Mr. \xe2\x80\x94,\r\nI forget your name, which is a very good one\xe2\x80\x94that, faith, I would be\r\nvery loath to lose it after all. And the son of a ramrod, whom I\r\nbelieve I saw before Carlisle . . . \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can trust Macconochie until to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a delight to hear you say so,\xe2\x80\x9d says the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ntruth is that my name is not a very suitable one in this country of\r\nScotland. With a gentleman like you, my dear man, I would have no\r\nconcealments of course; and by your leave I\xe2\x80\x99ll just breathe it in your\r\near. They call me Francis Burke\xe2\x80\x94Colonel Francis Burke; and I am here,\r\nat a most damnable risk to myself, to see your masters\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse\r\nme, my good man, for giving them the name, for I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncircumstance I would never have guessed from your appearance. And if\r\nyou would just be so very obliging as to take my name to them, you\r\nmight say that I come bearing letters which I am sure they will be very\r\nrejoiced to have the reading of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColonel Francis Burke was one of the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Irishmen, that did his\r\ncause such an infinity of hurt, and were so much distasted of the Scots\r\nat the time of the rebellion; and it came at once into my mind, how the\r\nMaster of Ballantrae had astonished all men by going with that party.\r\nIn the same moment a strong foreboding of the truth possessed my soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will step in here,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, opening a chamber door, \xe2\x80\x9cI will let\r\nmy lord know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am sure it\xe2\x80\x99s very good of you, Mr. What-is-your-name,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nColonel.\r\n\r\nUp to the hall I went, slow-footed. There they were, all three\xe2\x80\x94my old\r\nlord in his place, Mrs. Henry at work by the window, Mr. Henry (as was\r\nmuch his custom) pacing the low end. In the midst was the table laid\r\nfor supper. I told them briefly what I had to say. My old lord lay back\r\nin his seat. Mrs. Henry sprang up standing with a mechanical motion,\r\nand she and her husband stared at each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes across the room; it\r\nwas the strangest, challenging look these two exchanged, and as they\r\nlooked, the colour faded in their faces. Then Mr. Henry turned to me;\r\nnot to speak, only to sign with his finger; but that was enough, and I\r\nwent down again for the Colonel.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned, these three were in much the same position I same\r\nleft them in; I believe no word had passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord Durrisdeer, no doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel, bowing, and my lord\r\nbowed in answer. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this,\xe2\x80\x9d continues the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cshould be the\r\nMaster of Ballantrae?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never taken that name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am Henry Durie,\r\nat your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the Colonel turns to Mrs. Henry, bowing with his hat upon his\r\nheart and the most killing airs of gallantry. \xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no mistake\r\nabout so fine a figure of a lady,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cI address the seductive\r\nMiss Alison, of whom I have so often heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more husband and wife exchanged a look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Mrs. Henry Durie,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cbut before my marriage my name was\r\nAlison Graeme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen my lord spoke up. \xe2\x80\x9cI am an old man, Colonel Burke,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\na frail one. It will be mercy on your part to be expeditious. Do you\r\nbring me news of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he hesitated, and then the words broke from him with\r\na singular change of voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lord, I will be round with you like a soldier,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nColonel. \xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord held out a wavering hand; he seemed to wave a signal, but\r\nwhether it was to give him time or to speak on, was more than we could\r\nguess. At length he got out the one word, \xe2\x80\x9cGood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the very best in the creation!\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Colonel. \xe2\x80\x9cFor my good\r\nfriend and admired comrade is at this hour in the fine city of Paris,\r\nand as like as not, if I know anything of his habits, he will be\r\ndrawing in his chair to a piece of dinner.\xe2\x80\x94Bedad, I believe the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfainting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Henry was indeed the colour of death, and drooped against the\r\nwindow-frame. But when Mr. Henry made a movement as if to run to her,\r\nshe straightened with a sort of shiver. \xe2\x80\x9cI am well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with her\r\nwhite lips.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry stopped, and his face had a strong twitch of anger. The next\r\nmoment he had turned to the Colonel. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not blame yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays he, \xe2\x80\x9cfor this effect on Mrs. Durie. It is only natural; we were\r\nall brought up like brother and sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Henry looked at her husband with something like relief or even\r\ngratitude. In my way of thinking, that speech was the first step he\r\nmade in her good graces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must try to forgive me, Mrs. Durie, for indeed and I am just an\r\nIrish savage,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel; \xe2\x80\x9cand I deserve to be shot for not\r\nbreaking the matter more artistically to a lady. But here are the\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s own letters; one for each of the three of you; and to be sure\r\n(if I know anything of my friend\xe2\x80\x99s genius) he will tell his own story\r\nwith a better grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe brought the three letters forth as he spoke, arranged them by their\r\nsuperscriptions, presented the first to my lord, who took it greedily,\r\nand advanced towards Mrs. Henry holding out the second.\r\n\r\nBut the lady waved it back. \xe2\x80\x9cTo my husband,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, with a choked\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was a quick man, but at this he was somewhat nonplussed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9chow very dull of me! To be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d But he still\r\nheld the letter.\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Henry reached forth his hand, and there was nothing to be\r\ndone but give it up. Mr. Henry took the letters (both hers and his\r\nown), and looked upon their outside, with his brows knit hard, as if he\r\nwere thinking. He had surprised me all through by his excellent\r\nbehaviour; but he was to excel himself now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me give you a hand to your room,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cThis has\r\ncome something of the suddenest; and, at any rate, you will wish to\r\nread your letter by yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she looked upon him with the same thought of wonder; but he gave\r\nher no time, coming straight to where she stood. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be better so,\r\nbelieve me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cand Colonel Burke is too considerate not to\r\nexcuse you.\xe2\x80\x9d And with that he took her hand by the fingers, and led her\r\nfrom the hall.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henry returned no more that night; and when Mr. Henry went to\r\nvisit her next morning, as I heard long afterwards, she gave him the\r\nletter again, still unopened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, read it and be done!\xe2\x80\x9d he had cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare me that,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nAnd by these two speeches, to my way of thinking, each undid a great\r\npart of what they had previously done well. But the letter, sure\r\nenough, came into my hands, and by me was burned, unopened.\r\n\r\n To be very exact as to the adventures of the Master after Culloden, I\r\n wrote not long ago to Colonel Burke, now a Chevalier of the Order of\r\n St. Louis, begging him for some notes in writing, since I could scarce\r\n depend upon my memory at so great an interval. To confess the truth, I\r\n have been somewhat embarrassed by his response; for he sent me the\r\n complete memoirs of his life, touching only in places on the Master;\r\n running to a much greater length than my whole story, and not\r\n everywhere (as it seems to me) designed for edification. He begged in\r\n his letter, dated from Ettenheim, that I would find a publisher for\r\n the whole, after I had made what use of it I required; and I think I\r\n shall best answer my own purpose and fulfil his wishes by printing\r\n certain parts of it in full. In this way my readers will have a\r\n detailed, and, I believe, a very genuine account of some essential\r\n matters; and if any publisher should take a fancy to the Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n manner of narration, he knows where to apply for the rest, of which\r\n there is plenty at his service. I put in my first extract here, so\r\n that it may stand in the place of what the Chevalier told us over our\r\n wine in the hall of Durrisdeer; but you are to suppose it was not the\r\n brutal fact, but a very varnished version that he offered to my lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE MASTER\xe2\x80\x99S WANDERINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Memoirs of the Chevalier de Burke_.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . I left Ruthven (it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly necessary to remark) with much\r\ngreater satisfaction than I had come to it; but whether I missed my way\r\nin the deserts, or whether my companions failed me, I soon found myself\r\nalone. This was a predicament very disagreeable; for I never understood\r\nthis horrid country or savage people, and the last stroke of the\r\nPrince\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal had made us of the Irish more unpopular than ever.\r\nI was reflecting on my poor chances, when I saw another horseman on the\r\nhill, whom I supposed at first to have been a phantom, the news of his\r\ndeath in the very front at Culloden being current in the army\r\ngenerally. This was the Master of Ballantrae, my Lord Durrisdeer\xe2\x80\x99s son,\r\na young nobleman of the rarest gallantry and parts, and equally\r\ndesigned by nature to adorn a Court and to reap laurels in the field.\r\nOur meeting was the more welcome to both, as he was one of the few\r\nScots who had used the Irish with consideration, and as he might now be\r\nof very high utility in aiding my escape. Yet what founded our\r\nparticular friendship was a circumstance, by itself as romantic as any\r\nfable of King Arthur.\r\n\r\nThis was on the second day of our flight, after we had slept one night\r\nin the rain upon the inclination of a mountain. There was an Appin man,\r\nAlan Black Stewart (or some such name, [2] but I have seen him since in\r\nFrance) who chanced to be passing the same way, and had a jealousy of\r\nmy companion. Very uncivil expressions were exchanged; and Stewart\r\ncalls upon the Master to alight and have it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Stewart,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master, \xe2\x80\x9cI think at the present time I\r\nwould prefer to run a race with you.\xe2\x80\x9d And with the word claps spurs to\r\nhis horse.\r\n\r\nStewart ran after us, a childish thing to do, for more than a mile; and\r\nI could not help laughing, as I looked back at last and saw him on a\r\nhill, holding his hand to his side, and nearly burst with running.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d I could not help saying to my companion, \xe2\x80\x9cI would\r\nlet no man run after me for any such proper purpose, and not give him\r\nhis desire. It was a good jest, but it smells a trifle cowardly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bent his brows at me. \xe2\x80\x9cI do pretty well,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I saddle\r\nmyself with the most unpopular man in Scotland, and let that suffice\r\nfor courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, bedad,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cI could show you a more unpopular with the naked\r\neye. And if you like not my company, you can \xe2\x80\x98saddle\xe2\x80\x99 yourself on some\r\none else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel Burke,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not let us quarrel; and, to that effect,\r\nlet me assure you I am the least patient man in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am as little patient as yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI care not who knows\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this rate,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, reining in, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall not go very far. And I\r\npropose we do one of two things upon the instant: either quarrel and be\r\ndone; or make a sure bargain to bear everything at each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a pair of brothers?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said no such foolishness,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a brother of my own,\r\nand I think no more of him than of a colewort. But if we are to have\r\nour noses rubbed together in this course of flight, let us each dare to\r\nbe ourselves like savages, and each swear that he will neither resent\r\nnor deprecate the other. I am a pretty bad fellow at bottom, and I find\r\nthe pretence of virtues very irksome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I am as bad as yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no skim milk in Francis\r\nBurke. But which is it to be? Fight or make friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it will be the best manner to spin a coin for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis proposition was too highly chivalrous not to take my fancy; and,\r\nstrange as it may seem of two well-born gentlemen of to-day, we span a\r\nhalf-crown (like a pair of ancient paladins) whether we were to cut\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s throats or be sworn friends. A more romantic circumstance\r\ncan rarely have occurred; and it is one of those points in my memoirs,\r\nby which we may see the old tales of Homer and the poets are equally\r\ntrue to-day\xe2\x80\x94at least, of the noble and genteel. The coin fell for\r\npeace, and we shook hands upon our bargain. And then it was that my\r\ncompanion explained to me his thought in running away from Mr. Stewart,\r\nwhich was certainly worthy of his political intellect. The report of\r\nhis death, he said, was a great guard to him; Mr. Stewart having\r\nrecognised him, had become a danger; and he had taken the briefest road\r\nto that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s silence. \xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cAlan Black is too vain a\r\nman to narrate any such story of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTowards afternoon we came down to the shores of that loch for which we\r\nwere heading; and there was the ship, but newly come to anchor. She was\r\nthe _Sainte-Marie-des-Anges_, out of the port of Havre-de-Grace. The\r\nMaster, after we had signalled for a boat, asked me if I knew the\r\ncaptain. I told him he was a countryman of mine, of the most\r\nunblemished integrity, but, I was afraid, a rather timorous man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cFor all that, he should certainly hear the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI asked him if he meant about the battle? for if the captain once knew\r\nthe standard was down, he would certainly put to sea again at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even then!\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cthe arms are now of no sort of utility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwho thinks of the arms? But, to be sure, we\r\nmust remember our friends. They will be close upon our heels, perhaps\r\nthe Prince himself, and if the ship be gone, a great number of valuable\r\nlives may be imperilled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe captain and the crew have lives also, if you come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nBallantrae.\r\n\r\nThis I declared was but a quibble, and that I would not hear of the\r\ncaptain being told; and then it was that Ballantrae made me a witty\r\nanswer, for the sake of which (and also because I have been blamed\r\nmyself in this business of the _Sainte-Marie-des-Anges_) I have related\r\nthe whole conversation as it passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrank,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cremember our bargain. I must not object to your\r\nholding your tongue, which I hereby even encourage you to do; but, by\r\nthe same terms, you are not to resent my telling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at this; though I still forewarned him what\r\nwould come of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil may come of it for what I care,\xe2\x80\x9d says the reckless fellow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always done exactly as I felt inclined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs is well known, my prediction came true. The captain had no sooner\r\nheard the news than he cut his cable and to sea again; and before\r\nmorning broke, we were in the Great Minch.\r\n\r\nThe ship was very old; and the skipper, although the most honest of men\r\n(and Irish too), was one of the least capable. The wind blew very\r\nboisterous, and the sea raged extremely. All that day we had little\r\nheart whether to eat or drink; went early to rest in some concern of\r\nmind; and (as if to give us a lesson) in the night the wind chopped\r\nsuddenly into the north-east, and blew a hurricane. We were awaked by\r\nthe dreadful thunder of the tempest and the stamping of the mariners on\r\ndeck; so that I supposed our last hour was certainly come; and the\r\nterror of my mind was increased out of all measure by Ballantrae, who\r\nmocked at my devotions. It is in hours like these that a man of any\r\npiety appears in his true light, and we find (what we are taught as\r\nbabes) the small trust that can be set in worldly friends. I would be\r\nunworthy of my religion if I let this pass without particular remark.\r\nFor three days we lay in the dark in the cabin, and had but a biscuit\r\nto nibble. On the fourth the wind fell, leaving the ship dismasted and\r\nheaving on vast billows. The captain had not a guess of whither we were\r\nblown; he was stark ignorant of his trade, and could do naught but\r\nbless the Holy Virgin; a very good thing, too, but scarce the whole of\r\nseamanship. It seemed, our one hope was to be picked up by another\r\nvessel; and if that should prove to be an English ship, it might be no\r\ngreat blessing to the Master and myself.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and sixth days we tossed there helpless. The seventh some\r\nsail was got on her, but she was an unwieldy vessel at the best, and we\r\nmade little but leeway. All the time, indeed, we had been drifting to\r\nthe south and west, and during the tempest must have driven in that\r\ndirection with unheard-of violence. The ninth dawn was cold and black,\r\nwith a great sea running, and every mark of foul weather. In this\r\nsituation we were overjoyed to sight a small ship on the horizon, and\r\nto perceive her go about and head for the _Sainte-Marie_. But our\r\ngratification did not very long endure; for when she had laid to and\r\nlowered a boat, it was immediately filled with disorderly fellows, who\r\nsang and shouted as they pulled across to us, and swarmed in on our\r\ndeck with bare cutlasses, cursing loudly. Their leader was a horrible\r\nvillain, with his face blacked and his whiskers curled in ringlets;\r\nTeach, his name; a most notorious pirate. He stamped about the deck,\r\nraving and crying out that his name was Satan, and his ship was called\r\nHell. There was something about him like a wicked child or a\r\nhalf-witted person, that daunted me beyond expression. I whispered in\r\nthe ear of Ballantrae that I would not be the last to volunteer, and\r\nonly prayed God they might be short of hands; he approved my purpose\r\nwith a nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBedad,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to Master Teach, \xe2\x80\x9cif you are Satan, here is a devil for\r\nye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe word pleased him; and (not to dwell upon these shocking incidents)\r\nBallantrae and I and two others were taken for recruits, while the\r\nskipper and all the rest were cast into the sea by the method of\r\nwalking the plank. It was the first time I had seen this done; my heart\r\ndied within me at the spectacle; and Master Teach or one of his\r\nacolytes (for my head was too much lost to be precise) remarked upon my\r\npale face in a very alarming manner. I had the strength to cut a step\r\nor two of a jig, and cry out some ribaldry, which saved me for that\r\ntime; but my legs were like water when I must get down into the skiff\r\namong these miscreants; and what with my horror of my company and fear\r\nof the monstrous billows, it was all I could do to keep an Irish tongue\r\nand break a jest or two as we were pulled aboard. By the blessing of\r\nGod, there was a fiddle in the pirate ship, which I had no sooner seen\r\nthan I fell upon; and in my quality of crowder I had the heavenly good\r\nluck to get favour in their eyes. _Crowding Pat_ was the name they\r\ndubbed me with; and it was little I cared for a name so long as my skin\r\nwas whole.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of a pandemonium that vessel was, I cannot describe, but she\r\nwas commanded by a lunatic, and might be called a floating Bedlam.\r\nDrinking, roaring, singing, quarrelling, dancing, they were never all\r\nsober at one time; and there were days together when, if a squall had\r\nsupervened, it must have sent us to the bottom; or if a king\xe2\x80\x99s ship had\r\ncome along, it would have found us quite helpless for defence. Once or\r\ntwice we sighted a sail, and, if we were sober enough, overhauled it,\r\nGod forgive us! and if we were all too drunk, she got away, and I would\r\nbless the saints under my breath. Teach ruled, if you can call that\r\nrule which brought no order, by the terror he created; and I observed\r\nthe man was very vain of his position. I have known marshals of\r\nFrance\xe2\x80\x94ay, and even Highland chieftains\xe2\x80\x94that were less openly puffed\r\nup; which throws a singular light on the pursuit of honour and glory.\r\nIndeed, the longer we live, the more we perceive the sagacity of\r\nAristotle and the other old philosophers; and though I have all my life\r\nbeen eager for legitimate distinctions, I can lay my hand upon my\r\nheart, at the end of my career, and declare there is not one\xe2\x80\x94no, nor\r\nyet life itself\xe2\x80\x94which is worth acquiring or preserving at the slightest\r\ncost of dignity.\r\n\r\nIt was long before I got private speech of Ballantrae; but at length\r\none night we crept out upon the boltsprit, when the rest were better\r\nemployed, and commiserated our position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone can deliver us but the saints,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mind is very different,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ballantrae; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am going to\r\ndeliver myself. This Teach is the poorest creature possible; we make no\r\nprofit of him, and lie continually open to capture; and,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam not going to be a tarry pirate for nothing, nor yet to hang in\r\nchains if I can help it.\xe2\x80\x9d And he told me what was in his mind to better\r\nthe state of the ship in the way of discipline, which would give us\r\nsafety for the present, and a sooner hope of deliverance when they\r\nshould have gained enough and should break up their company.\r\n\r\nI confessed to him ingenuously that my nerve was quite shook amid these\r\nhorrible surroundings, and I durst scarce tell him to count upon me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not very easy frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cnor very easy beat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few days after, there befell an accident which had nearly hanged us\r\nall; and offers the most extraordinary picture of the folly that ruled\r\nin our concerns. We were all pretty drunk: and some bedlamite spying a\r\nsail, Teach put the ship about in chase without a glance, and we began\r\nto bustle up the arms and boast of the horrors that should follow. I\r\nobserved Ballantrae stood quiet in the bows, looking under the shade of\r\nhis hand; but for my part, true to my policy among these savages, I was\r\nat work with the busiest and passing Irish jests for their diversion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun up the colours,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Teach. \xe2\x80\x9cShow the \xe2\x80\x94s the Jolly Roger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the merest drunken braggadocio at such a stage, and might have\r\nlost us a valuable prize; but I thought it no part of mine to reason,\r\nand I ran up the black flag with my own hand.\r\n\r\nBallantrae steps presently aft with a smile upon his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may perhaps like to know, you drunken dog,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are\r\nchasing a king\xe2\x80\x99s ship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTeach roared him the lie; but he ran at the same time to the bulwarks,\r\nand so did they all. I have never seen so many drunken men struck\r\nsuddenly sober. The cruiser had gone about, upon our impudent display\r\nof colours; she was just then filling on the new tack; her ensign blew\r\nout quite plain to see; and even as we stared, there came a puff of\r\nsmoke, and then a report, and a shot plunged in the waves a good way\r\nshort of us. Some ran to the ropes, and got the _Sarah_ round with an\r\nincredible swiftness. One fellow fell on the rum barrel, which stood\r\nbroached upon the deck, and rolled it promptly overboard. On my part, I\r\nmade for the Jolly Roger, struck it, tossed it in the sea; and could\r\nhave flung myself after, so vexed was I with our mismanagement. As for\r\nTeach, he grew as pale as death, and incontinently went down to his\r\ncabin. Only twice he came on deck that afternoon; went to the taffrail;\r\ntook a long look at the king\xe2\x80\x99s ship, which was still on the horizon\r\nheading after us; and then, without speech, back to his cabin. You may\r\nsay he deserted us; and if it had not been for one very capable sailor\r\nwe had on board, and for the lightness of the airs that blew all day,\r\nwe must certainly have gone to the yard-arm.\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed Teach was humiliated, and perhaps alarmed for his\r\nposition with the crew; and the way in which he set about regaining\r\nwhat he had lost, was highly characteristic of the man. Early next day\r\nwe smelled him burning sulphur in his cabin and crying out of \xe2\x80\x9cHell,\r\nhell!\xe2\x80\x9d which was well understood among the crew, and filled their minds\r\nwith apprehension. Presently he comes on deck, a perfect figure of fun,\r\nhis face blacked, his hair and whiskers curled, his belt stuck full of\r\npistols; chewing bits of glass so that the blood ran down his chin, and\r\nbrandishing a dirk. I do not know if he had taken these manners from\r\nthe Indians of America, where he was a native; but such was his way,\r\nand he would always thus announce that he was wound up to horrid deeds.\r\nThe first that came near him was the fellow who had sent the rum\r\noverboard the day before; him he stabbed to the heart, damning him for\r\na mutineer; and then capered about the body, raving and swearing and\r\ndaring us to come on. It was the silliest exhibition; and yet dangerous\r\ntoo, for the cowardly fellow was plainly working himself up to another\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden Ballantrae stepped forth. \xe2\x80\x9cHave done with this\r\nplay-acting,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think to frighten us with making faces?\r\nWe saw nothing of you yesterday, when you were wanted; and we did well\r\nwithout you, let me tell you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur and a movement in the crew, of pleasure and alarm, I\r\nthought, in nearly equal parts. As for Teach, he gave a barbarous howl,\r\nand swung his dirk to fling it, an art in which (like many seamen) he\r\nwas very expert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnock that out of his hand!\xe2\x80\x9d says Ballantrae, so sudden and sharp that\r\nmy arm obeyed him before my mind had understood.\r\n\r\nTeach stood like one stupid, never thinking on his pistols.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo down to your cabin,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Ballantrae, \xe2\x80\x9cand come on deck again when\r\nyou are sober. Do you think we are going to hang for you, you\r\nblack-faced, half-witted, drunken brute and butcher? Go down!\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nstamped his foot at him with such a sudden smartness that Teach fairly\r\nran for it to the companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, mates,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ballantrae, \xe2\x80\x9ca word with you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if\r\nyou are gentlemen of fortune for the fun of the thing, but I am not. I\r\nwant to make money, and get ashore again, and spend it like a man. And\r\non one thing my mind is made up: I will not hang if I can help it.\r\nCome: give me a hint; I\xe2\x80\x99m only a beginner! Is there no way to get a\r\nlittle discipline and common sense about this business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the men spoke up: he said by rights they should have a\r\nquartermaster; and no sooner was the word out of his mouth than they\r\nwere all of that opinion. The thing went by acclamation, Ballantrae was\r\nmade quartermaster, the rum was put in his charge, laws were passed in\r\nimitation of those of a pirate by the name of Roberts, and the last\r\nproposal was to make an end of Teach. But Ballantrae was afraid of a\r\nmore efficient captain, who might be a counterweight to himself, and he\r\nopposed this stoutly. Teach, he said, was good enough to board ships\r\nand frighten fools with his blacked face and swearing; we could scarce\r\nget a better man than Teach for that; and besides, as the man was now\r\ndisconsidered and as good as deposed, we might reduce his proportion of\r\nthe plunder. This carried it; Teach\xe2\x80\x99s share was cut down to a mere\r\nderision, being actually less than mine; and there remained only two\r\npoints: whether he would consent, and who was to announce to him this\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not let that stick you,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ballantrae, \xe2\x80\x9cI will do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he stepped to the companion and down alone into the cabin to face\r\nthat drunken savage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the man for us,\xe2\x80\x9d cries one of the hands. \xe2\x80\x9cThree cheers for the\r\nquartermaster!\xe2\x80\x9d which were given with a will, my own voice among the\r\nloudest, and I dare say these plaudits had their effect on Master Teach\r\nin the cabin, as we have seen of late days how shouting in the streets\r\nmay trouble even the minds of legislators.\r\n\r\nWhat passed precisely was never known, though some of the heads of it\r\ncame to the surface later on; and we were all amazed, as well as\r\ngratified, when Ballantrae came on deck with Teach upon his arm, and\r\nannounced that all had been consented.\r\n\r\nI pass swiftly over those twelve or fifteen months in which we\r\ncontinued to keep the sea in the North Atlantic, getting our food and\r\nwater from the ships we over-hauled, and doing on the whole a pretty\r\nfortunate business. Sure, no one could wish to read anything so\r\nungenteel as the memoirs of a pirate, even an unwilling one like me!\r\nThings went extremely better with our designs, and Ballantrae kept his\r\nlead, to my admiration, from that day forth. I would be tempted to\r\nsuppose that a gentleman must everywhere be first, even aboard a rover:\r\nbut my birth is every whit as good as any Scottish lord\xe2\x80\x99s, and I am not\r\nashamed to confess that I stayed Crowding Pat until the end, and was\r\nnot much better than the crew\xe2\x80\x99s buffoon. Indeed, it was no scene to\r\nbring out my merits. My health suffered from a variety of reasons; I\r\nwas more at home to the last on a horse\xe2\x80\x99s back than a ship\xe2\x80\x99s deck; and,\r\nto be ingenuous, the fear of the sea was constantly in my mind,\r\nbattling with the fear of my companions. I need not cry myself up for\r\ncourage; I have done well on many fields under the eyes of famous\r\ngenerals, and earned my late advancement by an act of the most\r\ndistinguished valour before many witnesses. But when we must proceed on\r\none of our abordages, the heart of Francis Burke was in his boots; the\r\nlittle eggshell skiff in which we must set forth, the horrible heaving\r\nof the vast billows, the height of the ship that we must scale, the\r\nthought of how many might be there in garrison upon their legitimate\r\ndefence, the scowling heavens which (in that climate) so often looked\r\ndarkly down upon our exploits, and the mere crying of the wind in my\r\nears, were all considerations most unpalatable to my valour. Besides\r\nwhich, as I was always a creature of the nicest sensibility, the scenes\r\nthat must follow on our success tempted me as little as the chances of\r\ndefeat. Twice we found women on board; and though I have seen towns\r\nsacked, and of late days in France some very horrid public tumults,\r\nthere was something in the smallness of the numbers engaged, and the\r\nbleak dangerous sea-surroundings, that made these acts of piracy far\r\nthe most revolting. I confess ingenuously I could never proceed unless\r\nI was three parts drunk; it was the same even with the crew; Teach\r\nhimself was fit for no enterprise till he was full of rum; and it was\r\none of the most difficult parts of Ballantrae\xe2\x80\x99s performance, to serve\r\nus with liquor in the proper quantities. Even this he did to\r\nadmiration; being upon the whole the most capable man I ever met with,\r\nand the one of the most natural genius. He did not even scrape favour\r\nwith the crew, as I did, by continual buffoonery made upon a very\r\nanxious heart; but preserved on most occasions a great deal of gravity\r\nand distance; so that he was like a parent among a family of young\r\nchildren, or a schoolmaster with his boys. What made his part the\r\nharder to perform, the men were most inveterate grumblers; Ballantrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscipline, little as it was, was yet irksome to their love of licence;\r\nand what was worse, being kept sober they had time to think. Some of\r\nthem accordingly would fall to repenting their abominable crimes; one\r\nin particular, who was a good Catholic, and with whom I would sometimes\r\nsteal apart for prayer; above all in bad weather, fogs, lashing rain\r\nand the like, when we would be the less observed; and I am sure no two\r\ncriminals in the cart have ever performed their devotions with more\r\nanxious sincerity. But the rest, having no such grounds of hope, fell\r\nto another pastime, that of computation. All day long they would be\r\ntelling up their shares or grooming over the result. I have said we\r\nwere pretty fortunate. But an observation fails to be made: that in\r\nthis world, in no business that I have tried, do the profits rise to a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s expectations. We found many ships and took many; yet few of them\r\ncontained much money, their goods were usually nothing to our\r\npurpose\xe2\x80\x94what did we want with a cargo of ploughs, or even of\r\ntobacco?\xe2\x80\x94and it is quite a painful reflection how many whole crews we\r\nhave made to walk the plank for no more than a stock of biscuit or an\r\nanker or two of spirit.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile our ship was growing very foul, and it was high time\r\nwe should make for our _port de carr\xc3\xa9nage_, which was in the estuary of\r\na river among swamps. It was openly understood that we should then\r\nbreak up and go and squander our proportions of the spoil; and this\r\nmade every man greedy of a little more, so that our decision was\r\ndelayed from day to day. What finally decided matters, was a trifling\r\naccident, such as an ignorant person might suppose incidental to our\r\nway of life. But here I must explain: on only one of all the ships we\r\nboarded, the first on which we found women, did we meet with any\r\ngenuine resistance. On that occasion we had two men killed and several\r\ninjured, and if it had not been for the gallantry of Ballantrae we had\r\nsurely been beat back at last. Everywhere else the defence (where there\r\nwas any at all) was what the worst troops in Europe would have laughed\r\nat; so that the most dangerous part of our employment was to clamber up\r\nthe side of the ship; and I have even known the poor souls on board to\r\ncast us a line, so eager were they to volunteer instead of walking the\r\nplank. This constant immunity had made our fellows very soft, so that I\r\nunderstood how Teach had made so deep a mark upon their minds; for\r\nindeed the company of that lunatic was the chief danger in our way of\r\nlife. The accident to which I have referred was this:\xe2\x80\x94We had sighted a\r\nlittle full-rigged ship very close under our board in a haze; she\r\nsailed near as well as we did\xe2\x80\x94I should be nearer truth if I said, near\r\nas ill; and we cleared the bow-chaser to see if we could bring a spar\r\nor two about their ears. The swell was exceeding great; the motion of\r\nthe ship beyond description; it was little wonder if our gunners should\r\nfire thrice and be still quite broad of what they aimed at. But in the\r\nmeanwhile the chase had cleared a stern gun, the thickness of the air\r\nconcealing them; and being better marksmen, their first shot struck us\r\nin the bows, knocked our two gunners into mince-meat, so that we were\r\nall sprinkled with the blood, and plunged through the deck into the\r\nforecastle, where we slept. Ballantrae would have held on; indeed,\r\nthere was nothing in this _contretemps_ to affect the mind of any\r\nsoldier; but he had a quick perception of the men\xe2\x80\x99s wishes, and it was\r\nplain this lucky shot had given them a sickener of their trade. In a\r\nmoment they were all of one mind: the chase was drawing away from us,\r\nit was needless to hold on, the _Sarah_ was too foul to overhaul a\r\nbottle, it was mere foolery to keep the sea with her; and on these\r\npretended grounds her head was incontinently put about and the course\r\nlaid for the river. It was strange to see what merriment fell on that\r\nship\xe2\x80\x99s company, and how they stamped about the deck jesting, and each\r\ncomputing what increase had come to his share by the death of the two\r\ngunners.\r\n\r\nWe were nine days making our port, so light were the airs we had to\r\nsail on, so foul the ship\xe2\x80\x99s bottom; but early on the tenth, before\r\ndawn, and in a light lifting haze, we passed the head. A little after,\r\nthe haze lifted, and fell again, showing us a cruiser very close. This\r\nwas a sore blow, happening so near our refuge. There was a great debate\r\nof whether she had seen us, and if so whether it was likely they had\r\nrecognised the _Sarah_. We were very careful, by destroying every\r\nmember of those crews we overhauled, to leave no evidence as to our own\r\npersons; but the appearance of the _Sarah_ herself we could not keep so\r\nprivate; and above all of late, since she had been foul, and we had\r\npursued many ships without success, it was plain that her description\r\nhad been often published. I supposed this alert would have made us\r\nseparate upon the instant. But here again that original genius of\r\nBallantrae\xe2\x80\x99s had a surprise in store for me. He and Teach (and it was\r\nthe most remarkable step of his success) had gone hand in hand since\r\nthe first day of his appointment. I often questioned him upon the fact,\r\nand never got an answer but once, when he told me he and Teach had an\r\nunderstanding \xe2\x80\x9cwhich would very much surprise the crew if they should\r\nhear of it, and would surprise himself a good deal if it was carried\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, here again he and Teach were of a mind; and by their joint\r\nprocurement the anchor was no sooner down than the whole crew went off\r\nupon a scene of drunkenness indescribable. By afternoon we were a mere\r\nshipful of lunatical persons, throwing of things overboard, howling of\r\ndifferent songs at the same time, quarrelling and falling together, and\r\nthen forgetting our quarrels to embrace. Ballantrae had bidden me drink\r\nnothing, and feign drunkenness, as I valued my life; and I have never\r\npassed a day so wearisomely, lying the best part of the time upon the\r\nforecastle and watching the swamps and thickets by which our little\r\nbasin was entirely surrounded for the eye. A little after dusk\r\nBallantrae stumbled up to my side, feigned to fall, with a drunken\r\nlaugh, and before he got his feet again, whispered me to \xe2\x80\x9creel down\r\ninto the cabin and seem to fall asleep upon a locker, for there would\r\nbe need of me soon.\xe2\x80\x9d I did as I was told, and coming into the cabin,\r\nwhere it was quite dark, let myself fall on the first locker. There was\r\na man there already; by the way he stirred and threw me off, I could\r\nnot think he was much in liquor; and yet when I had found another\r\nplace, he seemed to continue to sleep on. My heart now beat very hard,\r\nfor I saw some desperate matter was in act. Presently down came\r\nBallantrae, lit the lamp, looked about the cabin, nodded as if pleased,\r\nand on deck again without a word. I peered out from between my fingers,\r\nand saw there were three of us slumbering, or feigning to slumber, on\r\nthe lockers: myself, one Dutton and one Grady, both resolute men. On\r\ndeck the rest were got to a pitch of revelry quite beyond the bounds of\r\nwhat is human; so that no reasonable name can describe the sounds they\r\nwere now making. I have heard many a drunken bout in my time, many on\r\nboard that very _Sarah_, but never anything the least like this, which\r\nmade me early suppose the liquor had been tampered with. It was a long\r\nwhile before these yells and howls died out into a sort of miserable\r\nmoaning, and then to silence; and it seemed a long while after that\r\nbefore Ballantrae came down again, this time with Teach upon his heels.\r\nThe latter cursed at the sight of us three upon the lockers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ballantrae, \xe2\x80\x9cyou might fire a pistol at their ears. You\r\nknow what stuff they have been swallowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a hatch in the cabin floor, and under that the richest part\r\nof the booty was stored against the day of division. It fastened with a\r\nring and three padlocks, the keys (for greater security) being divided;\r\none to Teach, one to Ballantrae, and one to the mate, a man called\r\nHammond. Yet I was amazed to see they were now all in the one hand; and\r\nyet more amazed (still looking through my fingers) to observe\r\nBallantrae and Teach bring up several packets, four of them in all,\r\nvery carefully made up and with a loop for carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d says Teach, \xe2\x80\x9clet us be going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ballantrae. \xe2\x80\x9cI have discovered there is another man\r\nbesides yourself who knows a private path across the swamp; and it\r\nseems it is shorter than yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTeach cried out, in that case, they were undone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know for that,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ballantrae. \xe2\x80\x9cFor there are several other\r\ncircumstances with which I must acquaint you. First of all, there is no\r\nbullet in your pistols, which (if you remember) I was kind enough to\r\nload for both of us this morning. Secondly, as there is someone else\r\nwho knows a passage, you must think it highly improbable I should\r\nsaddle myself with a lunatic like you. Thirdly, these gentlemen (who\r\nneed no longer pretend to be asleep) are those of my party, and will\r\nnow proceed to gag and bind you to the mast; and when your men awaken\r\n(if they ever do awake after the drugs we have mingled in their\r\nliquor), I am sure they will be so obliging as to deliver you, and you\r\nwill have no difficulty, I daresay, to explain the business of the\r\nkeys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a word said Teach, but looked at us like a frightened baby as we\r\ngagged and bound him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you see, you moon-calf,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ballantrae, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy we made four\r\npackets. Heretofore you have been called Captain Teach, but I think you\r\nare now rather Captain Learn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was our last word on board the _Sarah_. We four, with our four\r\npackets, lowered ourselves softly into a skiff, and left that ship\r\nbehind us as silent as the grave, only for the moaning of some of the\r\ndrunkards. There was a fog about breast-high on the waters; so that\r\nDutton, who knew the passage, must stand on his feet to direct our\r\nrowing; and this, as it forced us to row gently, was the means of our\r\ndeliverance. We were yet but a little way from the ship, when it began\r\nto come grey, and the birds to fly abroad upon the water. All of a\r\nsudden Dutton clapped down upon his hams, and whispered us to be silent\r\nfor our lives, and hearken. Sure enough, we heard a little faint creak\r\nof oars upon one hand, and then again, and further off, a creak of oars\r\nupon the other. It was clear we had been sighted yesterday in the\r\nmorning; here were the cruiser\xe2\x80\x99s boats to cut us out; here were we\r\ndefenceless in their very midst. Sure, never were poor souls more\r\nperilously placed; and as we lay there on our oars, praying God the\r\nmist might hold, the sweat poured from my brow. Presently we heard one\r\nof the boats where we might have thrown a biscuit in her. \xe2\x80\x9cSoftly,\r\nmen,\xe2\x80\x9d we heard an officer whisper; and I marvelled they could not hear\r\nthe drumming of my heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the path,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ballantrae; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must get shelter anyhow;\r\nlet us pull straight ahead for the sides of the basin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis we did with the most anxious precaution, rowing, as best we could,\r\nupon our hands, and steering at a venture in the fog, which was (for\r\nall that) our only safety. But Heaven guided us; we touched ground at a\r\nthicket; scrambled ashore with our treasure; and having no other way of\r\nconcealment, and the mist beginning already to lighten, hove down the\r\nskiff and let her sink. We were still but new under cover when the sun\r\nrose; and at the same time, from the midst of the basin, a great\r\nshouting of seamen sprang up, and we knew the _Sarah_ was being\r\nboarded. I heard afterwards the officer that took her got great honour;\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s true the approach was creditably managed, but I think he had\r\nan easy capture when he came to board. [3]\r\n\r\nI was still blessing the saints for my escape, when I became aware we\r\nwere in trouble of another kind. We were here landed at random in a\r\nvast and dangerous swamp; and how to come at the path was a concern of\r\ndoubt, fatigue, and peril. Dutton, indeed, was of opinion we should\r\nwait until the ship was gone, and fish up the skiff; for any delay\r\nwould be more wise than to go blindly ahead in that morass. One went\r\nback accordingly to the basin-side and (peering through the thicket)\r\nsaw the fog already quite drunk up, and English colours flying on the\r\n_Sarah_, but no movement made to get her under way. Our situation was\r\nnow very doubtful. The swamp was an unhealthful place to linger in; we\r\nhad been so greedy to bring treasures that we had brought but little\r\nfood; it was highly desirable, besides, that we should get clear of the\r\nneighbourhood and into the settlements before the news of the capture\r\nwent abroad; and against all these considerations, there was only the\r\nperil of the passage on the other side. I think it not wonderful we\r\ndecided on the active part.\r\n\r\nIt was already blistering hot when we set forth to pass the marsh, or\r\nrather to strike the path, by compass. Dutton took the compass, and one\r\nor other of us three carried his proportion of the treasure. I promise\r\nyou he kept a sharp eye to his rear, for it was like the man\xe2\x80\x99s soul\r\nthat he must trust us with. The thicket was as close as a bush; the\r\nground very treacherous, so that we often sank in the most terrifying\r\nmanner, and must go round about; the heat, besides, was stifling, the\r\nair singularly heavy, and the stinging insects abounded in such myriads\r\nthat each of us walked under his own cloud. It has often been commented\r\non, how much better gentlemen of birth endure fatigue than persons of\r\nthe rabble; so that walking officers who must tramp in the dirt beside\r\ntheir men, shame them by their constancy. This was well to be observed\r\nin the present instance; for here were Ballantrae and I, two gentlemen\r\nof the highest breeding, on the one hand; and on the other, Grady, a\r\ncommon mariner, and a man nearly a giant in physical strength. The case\r\nof Dutton is not in point, for I confess he did as well as any of us.\r\n[4] But as for Grady, he began early to lament his case, tailed in the\r\nrear, refused to carry Dutton\xe2\x80\x99s packet when it came his turn, clamoured\r\ncontinually for rum (of which we had too little), and at last even\r\nthreatened us from behind with a cocked pistol, unless we should allow\r\nhim rest. Ballantrae would have fought it out, I believe; but I\r\nprevailed with him the other way; and we made a stop and ate a meal. It\r\nseemed to benefit Grady little; he was in the rear again at once,\r\ngrowling and bemoaning his lot; and at last, by some carelessness, not\r\nhaving followed properly in our tracks, stumbled into a deep part of\r\nthe slough where it was mostly water, gave some very dreadful screams,\r\nand before we could come to his aid had sunk along with his booty. His\r\nfate, and above all these screams of his, appalled us to the soul; yet\r\nit was on the whole a fortunate circumstance and the means of our\r\ndeliverance, for it moved Dutton to mount into a tree, whence he was\r\nable to perceive and to show me, who had climbed after him, a high\r\npiece of the wood, which was a landmark for the path. He went forward\r\nthe more carelessly, I must suppose; for presently we saw him sink a\r\nlittle down, draw up his feet and sink again, and so twice. Then he\r\nturned his face to us, pretty white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLend a hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI am in a bad place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ballantrae, standing still.\r\n\r\nDutton broke out into the most violent oaths, sinking a little lower as\r\nhe did, so that the mud was nearly to his waist, and plucking a pistol\r\nfrom his belt, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp me,\xe2\x80\x9d he cries, \xe2\x80\x9cor die and be damned to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ballantrae, \xe2\x80\x9cI did but jest. I am coming.\xe2\x80\x9d And he set down\r\nhis own packet and Dutton\xe2\x80\x99s, which he was then carrying. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not\r\nventure near till we see if you are needed,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to me, and went\r\nforward alone to where the man was bogged. He was quiet now, though he\r\nstill held the pistol; and the marks of terror in his countenance were\r\nvery moving to behold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9clook sharp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBallantrae was now got close up. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep still,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, and seemed to\r\nconsider; and then, \xe2\x80\x9cReach out both your hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDutton laid down his pistol, and so watery was the top surface that it\r\nwent clear out of sight; with an oath he stooped to snatch it; and as\r\nhe did so, Ballantrae leaned forth and stabbed him between the\r\nshoulders. Up went his hands over his head\xe2\x80\x94I know not whether with the\r\npain or to ward himself; and the next moment he doubled forward in the\r\nmud.\r\n\r\nBallantrae was already over the ankles; but he plucked himself out, and\r\ncame back to me, where I stood with my knees smiting one another. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ndevil take you, Francis!\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you are a half-hearted\r\nfellow, after all. I have only done justice on a pirate. And here we\r\nare quite clear of the _Sarah_! Who shall now say that we have dipped\r\nour hands in any irregularities?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI assured him he did me injustice; but my sense of humanity was so much\r\naffected by the horridness of the fact that I could scarce find breath\r\nto answer with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be more resolved. The need for this fellow\r\nceased when he had shown you where the path ran; and you cannot deny I\r\nwould have been daft to let slip so fair an opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not deny but he was right in principle; nor yet could I refrain\r\nfrom shedding tears, of which I think no man of valour need have been\r\nashamed; and it was not until I had a share of the rum that I was able\r\nto proceed. I repeat, I am far from ashamed of my generous emotion;\r\nmercy is honourable in the warrior; and yet I cannot altogether censure\r\nBallantrae, whose step was really fortunate, as we struck the path\r\nwithout further misadventure, and the same night, about sundown, came\r\nto the edge of the morass.\r\n\r\nWe were too weary to seek far; on some dry sands, still warm with the\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s sun, and close under a wood of pines, we lay down and were\r\ninstantly plunged in sleep.\r\n\r\nWe awaked the next morning very early, and began with a sullen spirit a\r\nconversation that came near to end in blows. We were now cast on shore\r\nin the southern provinces, thousands of miles from any French\r\nsettlement; a dreadful journey and a thousand perils lay in front of\r\nus; and sure, if there was ever need for amity, it was in such an hour.\r\nI must suppose that Ballantrae had suffered in his sense of what is\r\ntruly polite; indeed, and there is nothing strange in the idea, after\r\nthe sea-wolves we had consorted with so long; and as for myself, he\r\nfubbed me off unhandsomely, and any gentleman would have resented his\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nI told him in what light I saw his conduct; he walked a little off, I\r\nfollowing to upbraid him; and at last he stopped me with his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrank,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know what we swore; and yet there is no oath\r\ninvented would induce me to swallow such expressions, if I did not\r\nregard you with sincere affection. It is impossible you should doubt me\r\nthere: I have given proofs. Dutton I had to take, because he knew the\r\npass, and Grady because Dutton would not move without him; but what\r\ncall was there to carry you along? You are a perpetual danger to me\r\nwith your cursed Irish tongue. By rights you should now be in irons in\r\nthe cruiser. And you quarrel with me like a baby for some trinkets!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI considered this one of the most unhandsome speeches ever made; and\r\nindeed to this day I can scarce reconcile it to my notion of a\r\ngentleman that was my friend. I retorted upon him with his Scotch\r\naccent, of which he had not so much as some, but enough to be very\r\nbarbarous and disgusting, as I told him plainly; and the affair would\r\nhave gone to a great length, but for an alarming intervention.\r\n\r\nWe had got some way off upon the sand. The place where we had slept,\r\nwith the packets lying undone and the money scattered openly, was now\r\nbetween us and the pines; and it was out of these the stranger must\r\nhave come. There he was at least, a great hulking fellow of the\r\ncountry, with a broad axe on his shoulder, looking open-mouthed, now at\r\nthe treasure, which was just at his feet, and now at our disputation,\r\nin which we had gone far enough to have weapons in our hands. We had no\r\nsooner observed him than he found his legs and made off again among the\r\npines.\r\n\r\nThis was no scene to put our minds at rest: a couple of armed men in\r\nsea-clothes found quarrelling over a treasure, not many miles from\r\nwhere a pirate had been captured\xe2\x80\x94here was enough to bring the whole\r\ncountry about our ears. The quarrel was not even made up; it was\r\nblotted from our minds; and we got our packets together in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, and made off, running with the best will in the\r\nworld. But the trouble was, we did not know in what direction, and must\r\ncontinually return upon our steps. Ballantrae had indeed collected what\r\nhe could from Dutton; but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to travel upon hearsay; and the\r\nestuary, which spreads into a vast irregular harbour, turned us off\r\nupon every side with a new stretch of water.\r\n\r\nWe were near beside ourselves, and already quite spent with running,\r\nwhen, coming to the top of a dune, we saw we were again cut off by\r\nanother ramification of the bay. This was a creek, however, very\r\ndifferent from those that had arrested us before; being set in rocks,\r\nand so precipitously deep that a small vessel was able to lie\r\nalongside, made fast with a hawser; and her crew had laid a plank to\r\nthe shore. Here they had lighted a fire, and were sitting at their\r\nmeal. As for the vessel herself, she was one of those they build in the\r\nBermudas.\r\n\r\nThe love of gold and the great hatred that everybody has to pirates\r\nwere motives of the most influential, and would certainly raise the\r\ncountry in our pursuit. Besides, it was now plain we were on some sort\r\nof straggling peninsula, like the fingers of a hand; and the wrist, or\r\npassage to the mainland, which we should have taken at the first, was\r\nby this time not improbably secured. These considerations put us on a\r\nbolder counsel. For as long as we dared, looking every moment to hear\r\nsounds of the chase, we lay among some bushes on the top of the dune;\r\nand having by this means secured a little breath and recomposed our\r\nappearance, we strolled down at last, with a great affectation of\r\ncarelessness, to the party by the fire.\r\n\r\nIt was a trader and his negroes, belonging to Albany, in the province\r\nof New York, and now on the way home from the Indies with a cargo; his\r\nname I cannot recall. We were amazed to learn he had put in here from\r\nterror of the _Sarah_; for we had no thought our exploits had been so\r\nnotorious. As soon as the Albanian heard she had been taken the day\r\nbefore, he jumped to his feet, gave us a cup of spirits for our good\r\nnews, and sent big negroes to get sail on the Bermudan. On our side, we\r\nprofited by the dram to become more confidential, and at last offered\r\nourselves as passengers. He looked askance at our tarry clothes and\r\npistols, and replied civilly enough that he had scarce accommodation\r\nfor himself; nor could either our prayers or our offers of money, in\r\nwhich we advanced pretty far, avail to shake him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, you think ill of us,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ballantrae, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will show you how\r\nwell we think of you by telling you the truth. We are Jacobite\r\nfugitives, and there is a price upon our heads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this, the Albanian was plainly moved a little. He asked us many\r\nquestions as to the Scotch war, which Ballantrae very patiently\r\nanswered. And then, with a wink, in a vulgar manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI guess you and\r\nyour Prince Charlie got more than you cared about,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBedad, and that we did,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, my dear man, I wish you would\r\nset a new example and give us just that much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis I said in the Irish way, about which there is allowed to be\r\nsomething very engaging. It\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable thing, and a testimony to\r\nthe love with which our nation is regarded, that this address scarce\r\never fails in a handsome fellow. I cannot tell how often I have seen a\r\nprivate soldier escape the horse, or a beggar wheedle out a good alms\r\nby a touch of the brogue. And, indeed, as soon as the Albanian had\r\nlaughed at me I was pretty much at rest. Even then, however, he made\r\nmany conditions, and\xe2\x80\x94for one thing\xe2\x80\x94took away our arms, before he\r\nsuffered us aboard; which was the signal to cast off; so that in a\r\nmoment after, we were gliding down the bay with a good breeze, and\r\nblessing the name of God for our deliverance. Almost in the mouth of\r\nthe estuary, we passed the cruiser, and a little after the poor _Sarah_\r\nwith her prize crew; and these were both sights to make us tremble. The\r\nBermudan seemed a very safe place to be in, and our bold stroke to have\r\nbeen fortunately played, when we were thus reminded of the case of our\r\ncompanions. For all that, we had only exchanged traps, jumped out of\r\nthe frying-pan into the fire, ran from the yard-arm to the block, and\r\nescaped the open hostility of the man-of-war to lie at the mercy of the\r\ndoubtful faith of our Albanian merchant.\r\n\r\nFrom many circumstances, it chanced we were safer than we could have\r\ndared to hope. The town of Albany was at that time much concerned in\r\ncontraband trade across the desert with the Indians and the French.\r\nThis, as it was highly illegal, relaxed their loyalty, and as it\r\nbrought them in relation with the politest people on the earth, divided\r\neven their sympathies. In short, they were like all the smugglers in\r\nthe world, spies and agents ready-made for either party. Our Albanian,\r\nbesides, was a very honest man indeed, and very greedy; and, to crown\r\nour luck, he conceived a great delight in our society. Before we had\r\nreached the town of New York we had come to a full agreement, that he\r\nshould carry us as far as Albany upon his ship, and thence put us on a\r\nway to pass the boundaries and join the French. For all this we were to\r\npay at a high rate; but beggars cannot be choosers, nor outlaws\r\nbargainers.\r\n\r\nWe sailed, then, up the Hudson River, which, I protest, is a very fine\r\nstream, and put up at the \xe2\x80\x9cKing\xe2\x80\x99s Arms\xe2\x80\x9d in Albany. The town was full of\r\nthe militia of the province, breathing slaughter against the French.\r\nGovernor Clinton was there himself, a very busy man, and, by what I\r\ncould learn, very near distracted by the factiousness of his Assembly.\r\nThe Indians on both sides were on the war-path; we saw parties of them\r\nbringing in prisoners and (what was much worse) scalps, both male and\r\nfemale, for which they were paid at a fixed rate; and I assure you the\r\nsight was not encouraging. Altogether, we could scarce have come at a\r\nperiod more unsuitable for our designs; our position in the chief inn\r\nwas dreadfully conspicuous; our Albanian fubbed us off with a thousand\r\ndelays, and seemed upon the point of a retreat from his engagements;\r\nnothing but peril appeared to environ the poor fugitives, and for some\r\ntime we drowned our concern in a very irregular course of living.\r\n\r\nThis, too, proved to be fortunate; and it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the remarks that\r\nfall to be made upon our escape, how providentially our steps were\r\nconducted to the very end. What a humiliation to the dignity of man! My\r\nphilosophy, the extraordinary genius of Ballantrae, our valour, in\r\nwhich I grant that we were equal\xe2\x80\x94all these might have proved\r\ninsufficient without the Divine blessing on our efforts. And how true\r\nit is, as the Church tells us, that the Truths of Religion are, after\r\nall, quite applicable even to daily affairs! At least, it was in the\r\ncourse of our revelry that we made the acquaintance of a spirited youth\r\nby the name of Chew. He was one of the most daring of the Indian\r\ntraders, very well acquainted with the secret paths of the wilderness,\r\nneedy, dissolute, and, by a last good fortune, in some disgrace with\r\nhis family. Him we persuaded to come to our relief; he privately\r\nprovided what was needful for our flight, and one day we slipped out of\r\nAlbany, without a word to our former friend, and embarked, a little\r\nabove, in a canoe.\r\n\r\nTo the toils and perils of this journey, it would require a pen more\r\nelegant than mine to do full justice. The reader must conceive for\r\nhimself the dreadful wilderness which we had now to thread; its\r\nthickets, swamps, precipitous rocks, impetuous rivers, and amazing\r\nwaterfalls. Among these barbarous scenes we must toil all day, now\r\npaddling, now carrying our canoe upon our shoulders; and at night we\r\nslept about a fire, surrounded by the howling of wolves and other\r\nsavage animals. It was our design to mount the headwaters of the\r\nHudson, to the neighbourhood of Crown Point, where the French had a\r\nstrong place in the woods, upon Lake Champlain. But to have done this\r\ndirectly were too perilous; and it was accordingly gone upon by such a\r\nlabyrinth of rivers, lakes, and portages as makes my head giddy to\r\nremember. These paths were in ordinary times entirely desert; but the\r\ncountry was now up, the tribes on the war-path, the woods full of\r\nIndian scouts. Again and again we came upon these parties when we least\r\nexpected them; and one day, in particular, I shall never forget, how,\r\nas dawn was coming in, we were suddenly surrounded by five or six of\r\nthese painted devils, uttering a very dreary sort of cry, and\r\nbrandishing their hatchets. It passed off harmlessly, indeed, as did\r\nthe rest of our encounters; for Chew was well known and highly valued\r\namong the different tribes. Indeed, he was a very gallant, respectable\r\nyoung man; but even with the advantage of his companionship, you must\r\nnot think these meetings were without sensible peril. To prove\r\nfriendship on our part, it was needful to draw upon our stock of\r\nrum\xe2\x80\x94indeed, under whatever disguise, that is the true business of the\r\nIndian trader, to keep a travelling public-house in the forest; and\r\nwhen once the braves had got their bottle of _scaura_ (as they call\r\nthis beastly liquor), it behoved us to set forth and paddle for our\r\nscalps. Once they were a little drunk, goodbye to any sense or decency;\r\nthey had but the one thought, to get more _scaura_. They might easily\r\ntake it in their heads to give us chase, and had we been overtaken, I\r\nhad never written these memoirs.\r\n\r\nWe were come to the most critical portion of our course, where we might\r\nequally expect to fall into the hands of French or English, when a\r\nterrible calamity befell us. Chew was taken suddenly sick with symptoms\r\nlike those of poison, and in the course of a few hours expired in the\r\nbottom of the canoe. We thus lost at once our guide, our interpreter,\r\nour boatman, and our passport, for he was all these in one; and found\r\nourselves reduced, at a blow, to the most desperate and irremediable\r\ndistress. Chew, who took a great pride in his knowledge, had indeed\r\noften lectured us on the geography; and Ballantrae, I believe, would\r\nlisten. But for my part I have always found such information highly\r\ntedious; and beyond the fact that we were now in the country of the\r\nAdirondack Indians, and not so distant from our destination, could we\r\nbut have found the way, I was entirely ignorant. The wisdom of my\r\ncourse was soon the more apparent; for with all his pains, Ballantrae\r\nwas no further advanced than myself. He knew we must continue to go up\r\none stream; then, by way of a portage, down another; and then up a\r\nthird. But you are to consider, in a mountain country, how many streams\r\ncome rolling in from every hand. And how is a gentleman, who is a\r\nperfect stranger in that part of the world, to tell any one of them\r\nfrom any other? Nor was this our only trouble. We were great novices,\r\nbesides, in handling a canoe; the portages were almost beyond our\r\nstrength, so that I have seen us sit down in despair for half an hour\r\nat a time without one word; and the appearance of a single Indian,\r\nsince we had now no means of speaking to them, would have been in all\r\nprobability the means of our destruction. There is altogether some\r\nexcuse if Ballantrae showed something of a grooming disposition; his\r\nhabit of imputing blame to others, quite as capable as himself, was\r\nless tolerable, and his language it was not always easy to accept.\r\nIndeed, he had contracted on board the pirate ship a manner of address\r\nwhich was in a high degree unusual between gentlemen; and now, when you\r\nmight say he was in a fever, it increased upon him hugely.\r\n\r\nThe third day of these wanderings, as we were carrying the canoe upon a\r\nrocky portage, she fell, and was entirely bilged. The portage was\r\nbetween two lakes, both pretty extensive; the track, such as it was,\r\nopened at both ends upon the water, and on both hands was enclosed by\r\nthe unbroken woods; and the sides of the lakes were quite impassable\r\nwith bog: so that we beheld ourselves not only condemned to go without\r\nour boat and the greater part of our provisions, but to plunge at once\r\ninto impenetrable thickets and to desert what little guidance we still\r\nhad\xe2\x80\x94the course of the river. Each stuck his pistols in his belt,\r\nshouldered an axe, made a pack of his treasure and as much food as he\r\ncould stagger under; and deserting the rest of our possessions, even to\r\nour swords, which would have much embarrassed us among the woods, we\r\nset forth on this deplorable adventure. The labours of Hercules, so\r\nfinely described by Homer, were a trifle to what we now underwent. Some\r\nparts of the forest were perfectly dense down to the ground, so that we\r\nmust cut our way like mites in a cheese. In some the bottom was full of\r\ndeep swamp, and the whole wood entirely rotten. I have leaped on a\r\ngreat fallen log and sunk to the knees in touchwood; I have sought to\r\nstay myself, in falling, against what looked to be a solid trunk, and\r\nthe whole thing has whiffed away at my touch like a sheet of paper.\r\nStumbling, falling, bogging to the knees, hewing our way, our eyes\r\nalmost put out with twigs and branches, our clothes plucked from our\r\nbodies, we laboured all day, and it is doubtful if we made two miles.\r\nWhat was worse, as we could rarely get a view of the country, and were\r\nperpetually justled from our path by obstacles, it was impossible even\r\nto have a guess in what direction we were moving.\r\n\r\nA little before sundown, in an open place with a stream, and set about\r\nwith barbarous mountains, Ballantrae threw down his pack. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go no\r\nfurther,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and bade me light the fire, damning my blood in\r\nterms not proper for a chairman.\r\n\r\nI told him to try to forget he had ever been a pirate, and to remember\r\nhe had been a gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you mad?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cross me here!\xe2\x80\x9d And then, shaking his\r\nfist at the hills, \xe2\x80\x9cTo think,\xe2\x80\x9d cries he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I must leave my bones in\r\nthis miserable wilderness! Would God I had died upon the scaffold like\r\na gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d This he said ranting like an actor; and then sat biting\r\nhis fingers and staring on the ground, a most unchristian object.\r\n\r\nI took a certain horror of the man, for I thought a soldier and a\r\ngentleman should confront his end with more philosophy. I made him no\r\nreply, therefore, in words; and presently the evening fell so chill\r\nthat I was glad, for my own sake, to kindle a fire. And yet God knows,\r\nin such an open spot, and the country alive with savages, the act was\r\nlittle short of lunacy. Ballantrae seemed never to observe me; but at\r\nlast, as I was about parching a little corn, he looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever a brother?\xe2\x80\x9d said be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the blessing of Heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cnot less than five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the one,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a strange voice; and then presently,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall pay me for all this,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. And when I asked him what was\r\nhis brother\xe2\x80\x99s part in our distress, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9che sits in my\r\nplace, he bears my name, he courts my wife; and I am here alone with a\r\ndamned Irishman in this tooth-chattering desert! Oh, I have been a\r\ncommon gull!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\nThe explosion was in all ways so foreign to my friend\xe2\x80\x99s nature that I\r\nwas daunted out of all my just susceptibility. Sure, an offensive\r\nexpression, however vivacious, appears a wonderfully small affair in\r\ncircumstances so extreme! But here there is a strange thing to be\r\nnoted. He had only once before referred to the lady with whom he was\r\ncontracted. That was when we came in view of the town of New York, when\r\nhe had told me, if all had their rights, he was now in sight of his own\r\nproperty, for Miss Graeme enjoyed a large estate in the province. And\r\nthis was certainly a natural occasion; but now here she was named a\r\nsecond time; and what is surely fit to be observed, in this very month,\r\nwhich was November, \xe2\x80\x9947, and _I believe upon that very day as we sat\r\namong these barbarous mountains_, his brother and Miss Graeme were\r\nmarried. I am the least superstitious of men; but the hand of\r\nProvidence is here displayed too openly not to be remarked. [5]\r\n\r\nThe next day, and the next, were passed in similar labours; Ballantrae\r\noften deciding on our course by the spinning of a coin; and once, when\r\nI expostulated on this childishness, he had an odd remark that I have\r\nnever forgotten. \xe2\x80\x9cI know no better way,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto express my scorn\r\nof human reason.\xe2\x80\x9d I think it was the third day that we found the body\r\nof a Christian, scalped and most abominably mangled, and lying in a\r\npudder of his blood; the birds of the desert screaming over him, as\r\nthick as flies. I cannot describe how dreadfully this sight affected\r\nus; but it robbed me of all strength and all hope for this world. The\r\nsame day, and only a little after, we were scrambling over a part of\r\nthe forest that had been burned, when Ballantrae, who was a little\r\nahead, ducked suddenly behind a fallen trunk. I joined him in this\r\nshelter, whence we could look abroad without being seen ourselves; and\r\nin the bottom of the next vale, beheld a large war party of the savages\r\ngoing by across our line. There might be the value of a weak battalion\r\npresent; all naked to the waist, blacked with grease and soot, and\r\npainted with white lead and vermilion, according to their beastly\r\nhabits. They went one behind another like a string of geese, and at a\r\nquickish trot; so that they took but a little while to rattle by, and\r\ndisappear again among the woods. Yet I suppose we endured a greater\r\nagony of hesitation and suspense in these few minutes than goes usually\r\nto a man\xe2\x80\x99s whole life. Whether they were French or English Indians,\r\nwhether they desired scalps or prisoners, whether we should declare\r\nourselves upon the chance, or lie quiet and continue the heart-breaking\r\nbusiness of our journey: sure, I think these were questions to have\r\npuzzled the brains of Aristotle himself. Ballantrae turned to me with a\r\nface all wrinkled up and his teeth showing in his mouth, like what I\r\nhave read of people starving; he said no word, but his whole appearance\r\nwas a kind of dreadful question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey may be of the English side,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered; \xe2\x80\x9cand think! the best we\r\ncould then hope, is to begin this over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYet it must come to a plunge at last.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nhe suddenly plucked out his coin, shook it in his closed hands, looked\r\nat it, and then lay down with his face in the dust.\r\n\r\n_Addition by Mr. Mackellar_.\xe2\x80\x94I drop the Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s narration at this\r\npoint because the couple quarrelled and separated the same day; and the\r\nChevalier\xe2\x80\x99s account of the quarrel seems to me (I must confess) quite\r\nincompatible with the nature of either of the men. Henceforth they\r\nwandered alone, undergoing extraordinary sufferings; until first one\r\nand then the other was picked up by a party from Fort St. Frederick.\r\nOnly two things are to be noted. And first (as most important for my\r\npurpose) that the Master, in the course of his miseries buried his\r\ntreasure, at a point never since discovered, but of which he took a\r\ndrawing in his own blood on the lining of his hat. And second, that on\r\nhis coming thus penniless to the Fort, he was welcomed like a brother\r\nby the Chevalier, who thence paid his way to France. The simplicity of\r\nMr. Burke\xe2\x80\x99s character leads him at this point to praise the Master\r\nexceedingly; to an eye more worldly wise, it would seem it was the\r\nChevalier alone that was to be commended. I have the more pleasure in\r\npointing to this really very noble trait of my esteemed correspondent,\r\nas I fear I may have wounded him immediately before. I have refrained\r\nfrom comments on any of his extraordinary and (in my eyes) immoral\r\nopinions, for I know him to be jealous of respect. But his version of\r\nthe quarrel is really more than I can reproduce; for I knew the Master\r\nmyself, and a man more insusceptible of fear is not conceivable. I\r\nregret this oversight of the Chevalier\xe2\x80\x99s, and all the more because the\r\ntenor of his narrative (set aside a few flourishes) strikes me as\r\nhighly ingenuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nPERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY MR. HENRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can guess on what part of his adventures the Colonel principally\r\ndwelled. Indeed, if we had heard it all, it is to be thought the\r\ncurrent of this business had been wholly altered; but the pirate ship\r\nwas very gently touched upon. Nor did I hear the Colonel to an end even\r\nof that which he was willing to disclose; for Mr. Henry, having for\r\nsome while been plunged in a brown study, rose at last from his seat\r\nand (reminding the Colonel there were matters that he must attend to)\r\nbade me follow him immediately to the office.\r\n\r\nOnce there, he sought no longer to dissemble his concern, walking to\r\nand fro in the room with a contorted face, and passing his hand\r\nrepeatedly upon his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have some business,\xe2\x80\x9d he began at last; and there broke off,\r\ndeclared we must have wine, and sent for a magnum of the best. This was\r\nextremely foreign to his habitudes; and what was still more so, when\r\nthe wine had come, he gulped down one glass upon another like a man\r\ncareless of appearances. But the drink steadied him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will scarce be surprised, Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I tell you\r\nthat my brother\xe2\x80\x94whose safety we are all rejoiced to learn\xe2\x80\x94stands in\r\nsome need of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him I had misdoubted as much; but the time was not very\r\nfortunate, as the stock was low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is the money for the mortgage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI reminded him it was Mrs. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be answerable to my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is the mortgage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cit is on that I would consult you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI showed him how unfortunate a time it was to divert this money from\r\nits destination; and how, by so doing, we must lose the profit of our\r\npast economies, and plunge back the estate into the mire. I even took\r\nthe liberty to plead with him; and when he still opposed me with a\r\nshake of the head and a bitter dogged smile, my zeal quite carried me\r\nbeyond my place. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is midsummer madness,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I; \xe2\x80\x9cand I for one\r\nwill be no party to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak as though I did it for my pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have a\r\nchild now; and, besides, I love order; and to say the honest truth,\r\nMackellar, I had begun to take a pride in the estates.\xe2\x80\x9d He gloomed for\r\na moment. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what would you have?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing is mine,\r\nnothing. This day\xe2\x80\x99s news has knocked the bottom out of my life. I have\r\nonly the name and the shadow of things\xe2\x80\x94only the shadow; there is no\r\nsubstance in my rights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will prove substantial enough before a court,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with a burning eye, and seemed to repress the word upon\r\nhis lips; and I repented what I had said, for I saw that while he spoke\r\nof the estate he had still a side-thought to his marriage. And then, of\r\na sudden, he twitched the letter from his pocket, where it lay all\r\ncrumpled, smoothed it violently on the table, and read these words to\r\nme with a trembling tongue: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My dear Jacob\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94This is how he begins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncries he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My dear Jacob, I once called you so, you may remember; and\r\nyou have now done the business, and flung my heels as high as Criffel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhat do you think of that, Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom an only brother?\r\nI declare to God I liked him very well; I was always staunch to him;\r\nand this is how he writes! But I will not sit down under the\r\nimputation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94walking to and fro\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am as good as he; I am a better man\r\nthan he, I call on God to prove it! I cannot give him all the monstrous\r\nsum he asks; he knows the estate to be incompetent; but I will give him\r\nwhat I have, and it is more than he expects. I have borne all this too\r\nlong. See what he writes further on; read it for yourself: \xe2\x80\x98I know you\r\nare a niggardly dog.\xe2\x80\x99 A niggardly dog! I niggardly? Is that true,\r\nMackellar? You think it is?\xe2\x80\x9d I really thought he would have struck me\r\nat that. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you all think so! Well, you shall see, and he shall see,\r\nand God shall see. If I ruin the estate and go barefoot, I shall stuff\r\nthis bloodsucker. Let him ask all\xe2\x80\x94all, and he shall have it! It is all\r\nhis by rights. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand I foresaw all this, and worse, when\r\nhe would not let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d He poured out another glass of wine, and was\r\nabout to carry it to his lips, when I made so bold as to lay a finger\r\non his arm. He stopped a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and flung\r\nglass and all in the fireplace. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, let us count the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI durst no longer oppose him; indeed, I was very much affected by the\r\nsight of so much disorder in a man usually so controlled; and we sat\r\ndown together, counted the money, and made it up in packets for the\r\ngreater ease of Colonel Burke, who was to be the bearer. This done, Mr.\r\nHenry returned to the hall, where he and my old lord sat all night\r\nthrough with their guest.\r\n\r\nA little before dawn I was called and set out with the Colonel. He\r\nwould scarce have liked a less responsible convoy, for he was a man who\r\nvalued himself; nor could we afford him one more dignified, for Mr.\r\nHenry must not appear with the freetraders. It was a very bitter\r\nmorning of wind, and as we went down through the long shrubbery the\r\nColonel held himself muffled in his cloak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a great sum of money that your friend requires.\r\nI must suppose his necessities to be very great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, I thought drily; but perhaps it was the\r\ncloak about his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am only a servant of the family,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may deal openly with\r\nme. I think we are likely to get little good by him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cBallantrae is a gentleman of the most\r\neminent natural abilities, and a man that I admire, and that I revere,\r\nto the very ground he treads on.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he seemed to me to pause\r\nlike one in a difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are likely to get little good by him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure, and you can have it your own way, my dear man,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nColonel.\r\n\r\nBy this time we had come to the side of the creek, where the boat\r\nawaited him. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said be, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I am very much your debtor for\r\nall your civility, Mr. Whatever-your-name-is; and just as a last word,\r\nand since you show so much intelligent interest, I will mention a small\r\ncircumstance that may be of use to the family. For I believe my friend\r\nomitted to mention that he has the largest pension on the Scots Fund of\r\nany refugee in Paris; and it\xe2\x80\x99s the more disgraceful, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cries the\r\nColonel, warming, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause there\xe2\x80\x99s not one dirty penny for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe cocked his hat at me, as if I had been to blame for this partiality;\r\nthen changed again into his usual swaggering civility, shook me by the\r\nhand, and set off down to the boat, with the money under his arms, and\r\nwhistling as he went the pathetic air of _Shule Aroon_. It was the\r\nfirst time I had heard that tune; I was to hear it again, words and\r\nall, as you shall learn, but I remember how that little stave of it ran\r\nin my head after the freetraders had bade him \xe2\x80\x9cWheesht, in the deil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname,\xe2\x80\x9d and the grating of the oars had taken its place, and I stood and\r\nwatched the dawn creeping on the sea, and the boat drawing away, and\r\nthe lugger lying with her foresail backed awaiting it.\r\n\r\n The gap made in our money was a sore embarrassment, and, among other\r\n consequences, it had this: that I must ride to Edinburgh, and there\r\n raise a new loan on very questionable terms to keep the old afloat;\r\n and was thus, for close upon three weeks, absent from the house of\r\n Durrisdeer.\r\n\r\nWhat passed in the interval I had none to tell me, but I found Mrs.\r\nHenry, upon my return, much changed in her demeanour. The old talks\r\nwith my lord for the most part pretermitted; a certain deprecation\r\nvisible towards her husband, to whom I thought she addressed herself\r\nmore often; and, for one thing, she was now greatly wrapped up in Miss\r\nKatharine. You would think the change was agreeable to Mr. Henry; no\r\nsuch matter! To the contrary, every circumstance of alteration was a\r\nstab to him; he read in each the avowal of her truant fancies. That\r\nconstancy to the Master of which she was proud while she supposed him\r\ndead, she had to blush for now she knew he was alive, and these blushes\r\nwere the hated spring of her new conduct. I am to conceal no truth; and\r\nI will here say plainly, I think this was the period in which Mr. Henry\r\nshowed the worst. He contained himself, indeed, in public; but there\r\nwas a deep-seated irritation visible underneath. With me, from whom he\r\nhad less concealment, he was often grossly unjust, and even for his\r\nwife he would sometimes have a sharp retort: perhaps when she had\r\nruffled him with some unwonted kindness; perhaps upon no tangible\r\noccasion, the mere habitual tenor of the man\xe2\x80\x99s annoyance bursting\r\nspontaneously forth. When he would thus forget himself (a thing so\r\nstrangely out of keeping with the terms of their relation), there went\r\na shook through the whole company, and the pair would look upon each\r\nother in a kind of pained amazement.\r\n\r\nAll the time, too, while he was injuring himself by this defect of\r\ntemper, he was hurting his position by a silence, of which I scarce\r\nknow whether to say it was the child of generosity or pride. The\r\nfreetraders came again and again, bringing messengers from the Master,\r\nand none departed empty-handed. I never durst reason with Mr. Henry; he\r\ngave what was asked of him in a kind of noble rage. Perhaps because he\r\nknew he was by nature inclining to the parsimonious, he took a\r\nbackforemost pleasure in the recklessness with which he supplied his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s exigence. Perhaps the falsity of the position would have\r\nspurred a humbler man into the same excess. But the estate (if I may\r\nsay so) groaned under it; our daily expenses were shorn lower and\r\nlower; the stables were emptied, all but four roadsters; servants were\r\ndischarged, which raised a dreadful murmuring in the country, and\r\nheated up the old disfavour upon Mr. Henry; and at last the yearly\r\nvisit to Edinburgh must be discontinued.\r\n\r\nThis was in 1756. You are to suppose that for seven years this\r\nbloodsucker had been drawing the life\xe2\x80\x99s blood from Durrisdeer, and that\r\nall this time my patron had held his peace. It was an effect of\r\ndevilish malice in the Master that he addressed Mr. Henry alone upon\r\nthe matter of his demands, and there was never a word to my lord. The\r\nfamily had looked on, wondering at our economies. They had lamented, I\r\nhave no doubt, that my patron had become so great a miser\xe2\x80\x94a fault\r\nalways despicable, but in the young abhorrent, and Mr. Henry was not\r\nyet thirty years of age. Still, he had managed the business of\r\nDurrisdeer almost from a boy; and they bore with these changes in a\r\nsilence as proud and bitter as his own, until the coping-stone of the\r\nEdinburgh visit.\r\n\r\nAt this time I believe my patron and his wife were rarely together,\r\nsave at meals. Immediately on the back of Colonel Burke\xe2\x80\x99s announcement\r\nMrs. Henry made palpable advances; you might say she had laid a sort of\r\ntimid court to her husband, different, indeed, from her former manner\r\nof unconcern and distance. I never had the heart to blame Mr. Henry\r\nbecause he recoiled from these advances; nor yet to censure the wife,\r\nwhen she was cut to the quick by their rejection. But the result was an\r\nentire estrangement, so that (as I say) they rarely spoke, except at\r\nmeals. Even the matter of the Edinburgh visit was first broached at\r\ntable, and it chanced that Mrs. Henry was that day ailing and\r\nquerulous. She had no sooner understood her husband\xe2\x80\x99s meaning than the\r\nred flew in her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is too much! Heaven knows what pleasure I\r\nhave in my life, that I should be denied my only consolation. These\r\nshameful proclivities must be trod down; we are already a mark and an\r\neyesore in the neighbourhood. I will not endure this fresh insanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot afford it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfford?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cFor shame! But I have money of my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all mine, madam, by marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he snarled, and instantly left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nMy old lord threw up his hands to Heaven, and he and his daughter,\r\nwithdrawing to the chimney, gave me a broad hint to be gone. I found\r\nMr. Henry in his usual retreat, the steward\xe2\x80\x99s room, perched on the end\r\nof the table, and plunging his penknife in it with a very ugly\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do yourself too much injustice, and it is\r\ntime this should cease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d cries he, \xe2\x80\x9cnobody minds here. They think it only natural. I have\r\nshameful proclivities. I am a niggardly dog,\xe2\x80\x9d and he drove his knife up\r\nto the hilt. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I will show that fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried with an oath, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill show him which is the more generous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no generosity,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is only pride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I want morality?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nI thought he wanted help, and I should give it him, willy-nilly; and no\r\nsooner was Mrs. Henry gone to her room than I presented myself at her\r\ndoor and sought admittance.\r\n\r\nShe openly showed her wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want with me, Mr.\r\nMackellar?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord knows, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never troubled you before with\r\nany freedoms; but this thing lies too hard upon my conscience, and it\r\nwill out. Is it possible that two people can be so blind as you and my\r\nlord? and have lived all these years with a noble gentleman like Mr.\r\nHenry, and understand so little of his nature?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not know where his money goes to? his\xe2\x80\x94and yours\xe2\x80\x94and the money\r\nfor the very wine he does not drink at table?\xe2\x80\x9d I went on. \xe2\x80\x9cTo Paris\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nthat man! Eight thousand pounds has he had of us in seven years, and my\r\npatron fool enough to keep it secret!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight thousand pounds!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt in impossible; the estate is\r\nnot sufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows how we have sweated farthings to produce it,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\neight thousand and sixty is the sum, beside odd shillings. And if you\r\ncan think my patron miserly after that, this shall be my last\r\ninterference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need say no more, Mr. Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have done most\r\nproperly in what you too modestly call your interference. I am much to\r\nblame; you must think me indeed a very unobservant wife\xe2\x80\x9d (looking upon\r\nme with a strange smile), \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shall put this right at once. The\r\nMaster was always of a very thoughtless nature; but his heart is\r\nexcellent; he is the soul of generosity. I shall write to him myself.\r\nYou cannot think how you have pained me by this communication.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, madam, I had hoped to have pleased you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, for I raged\r\nto see her still thinking of the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pleased,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand pleased me of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat same day (I will not say but what I watched) I had the\r\nsatisfaction to see Mr. Henry come from his wife\xe2\x80\x99s room in a state most\r\nunlike himself; for his face was all bloated with weeping, and yet he\r\nseemed to me to walk upon the air. By this, I was sure his wife had\r\nmade him full amends for once. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI have done\r\na brave stroke this day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, as I was seated at my books, Mr. Henry came in softly\r\nbehind me, took me by the shoulders, and shook me in a manner of\r\nplayfulness. \xe2\x80\x9cI find you are a faithless fellow after all,\xe2\x80\x9d says he,\r\nwhich was his only reference to my part; but the tone he spoke in was\r\nmore to me than any eloquence of protestation. Nor was this all I had\r\neffected; for when the next messenger came (as he did not long\r\nafterwards) from the Master, he got nothing away with him but a letter.\r\nFor some while back it had been I myself who had conducted these\r\naffairs; Mr. Henry not setting pen to paper, and I only in the dryest\r\nand most formal terms. But this letter I did not even see; it would\r\nscarce be pleasant reading, for Mr. Henry felt he had his wife behind\r\nhim for once, and I observed, on the day it was despatched, he had a\r\nvery gratified expression.\r\n\r\nThings went better now in the family, though it could scarce be\r\npretended they went well. There was now at least no misconception;\r\nthere was kindness upon all sides; and I believe my patron and his wife\r\nmight again have drawn together if he could but have pocketed his\r\npride, and she forgot (what was the ground of all) her brooding on\r\nanother man. It is wonderful how a private thought leaks out; it is\r\nwonderful to me now how we should all have followed the current of her\r\nsentiments; and though she bore herself quietly, and had a very even\r\ndisposition, yet we should have known whenever her fancy ran to Paris.\r\nAnd would not any one have thought that my disclosure must have rooted\r\nup that idol? I think there is the devil in women: all these years\r\npassed, never a sight of the man, little enough kindness to remember\r\n(by all accounts) even while she had him, the notion of his death\r\nintervening, his heartless rapacity laid bare to her; that all should\r\nnot do, and she must still keep the best place in her heart for this\r\naccursed fellow, is a thing to make a plain man rage. I had never much\r\nnatural sympathy for the passion of love; but this unreason in my\r\npatron\xe2\x80\x99s wife disgusted me outright with the whole matter. I remember\r\nchecking a maid because she sang some bairnly kickshaw while my mind\r\nwas thus engaged; and my asperity brought about my ears the enmity of\r\nall the petticoats about the house; of which I reeked very little, but\r\nit amused Mr. Henry, who rallied me much upon our joint unpopularity.\r\nIt is strange enough (for my own mother was certainly one of the salt\r\nof the earth, and my Aunt Dickson, who paid my fees at the University,\r\na very notable woman), but I have never had much toleration for the\r\nfemale sex, possibly not much understanding; and being far from a bold\r\nman, I have ever shunned their company. Not only do I see no cause to\r\nregret this diffidence in myself, but have invariably remarked the most\r\nunhappy consequences follow those who were less wise. So much I thought\r\nproper to set down, lest I show myself unjust to Mrs. Henry. And,\r\nbesides, the remark arose naturally, on a re-perusal of the letter\r\nwhich was the next step in these affairs, and reached me, to my sincere\r\nastonishment, by a private hand, some week or so after the departure of\r\nthe last messenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from Colonel_ Burke (_afterwards Chevalier_) _to_ Mr.\r\nMackellar.\r\nTroyes in Champagne,\r\n_July_ 12, 1756\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Dear Sir,\xe2\x80\x94You will doubtless be surprised to receive a communication\r\nfrom one so little known to you; but on the occasion I had the good\r\nfortune to rencounter you at Durrisdeer, I remarked you for a young man\r\nof a solid gravity of character: a qualification which I profess I\r\nadmire and revere next to natural genius or the bold chivalrous spirit\r\nof the soldier. I was, besides, interested in the noble family which\r\nyou have the honour to serve, or (to speak more by the book) to be the\r\nhumble and respected friend of; and a conversation I had the pleasure\r\nto have with you very early in the morning has remained much upon my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nBeing the other day in Paris, on a visit from this famous city, where I\r\nam in garrison, I took occasion to inquire your name (which I profess I\r\nhad forgot) at my friend, the Master of B.; and a fair opportunity\r\noccurring, I write to inform you of what\xe2\x80\x99s new.\r\n\r\nThe Master of B. (when we had last some talk of him together) was in\r\nreceipt, as I think I then told you, of a highly advantageous pension\r\non the Scots Fund. He next received a company, and was soon after\r\nadvanced to a regiment of his own. My dear sir, I do not offer to\r\nexplain this circumstance; any more than why I myself, who have rid at\r\nthe right hand of Princes, should be fubbed off with a pair of colours\r\nand sent to rot in a hole at the bottom of the province. Accustomed as\r\nI am to Courts, I cannot but feel it is no atmosphere for a plain\r\nsoldier; and I could never hope to advance by similar means, even could\r\nI stoop to the endeavour. But our friend has a particular aptitude to\r\nsucceed by the means of ladies; and if all be true that I have heard,\r\nhe enjoyed a remarkable protection. It is like this turned against him;\r\nfor when I had the honour to shake him by the hand, he was but newly\r\nreleased from the Bastille, where he had been cast on a sealed letter;\r\nand, though now released, has both lost his regiment and his pension.\r\nMy dear sir, the loyalty of a plain Irishman will ultimately succeed in\r\nthe place of craft; as I am sure a gentleman of your probity will\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, the Master is a man whose genius I admire beyond expression,\r\nand, besides, he is my friend; but I thought a little word of this\r\nrevolution in his fortunes would not come amiss, for, in my opinion,\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s desperate. He spoke, when I saw him, of a trip to India\r\n(whither I am myself in some hope of accompanying my illustrious\r\ncountryman, Mr. Lally); but for this he would require (as I understood)\r\nmore money than was readily at his command. You may have heard a\r\nmilitary proverb: that it is a good thing to make a bridge of gold to a\r\nflying enemy? I trust you will take my meaning and I subscribe myself,\r\nwith proper respects to my Lord Durrisdeer, to his son, and to the\r\nbeauteous Mrs. Durie,\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\nYour obedient humble servant,\r\nFrancis Burke.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis missive I carried at once to Mr. Henry; and I think there was but\r\nthe one thought between the two of us: that it had come a week too\r\nlate. I made haste to send an answer to Colonel Burke, in which I\r\nbegged him, if he should see the Master, to assure him his next\r\nmessenger would be attended to. But with all my haste I was not in time\r\nto avert what was impending; the arrow had been drawn, it must now fly.\r\nI could almost doubt the power of Providence (and certainly His will)\r\nto stay the issue of events; and it is a strange thought, how many of\r\nus had been storing up the elements of this catastrophe, for how long a\r\ntime, and with how blind an ignorance of what we did.\r\n\r\n From the coming of the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s letter, I had a spyglass in my room,\r\n began to drop questions to the tenant folk, and as there was no great\r\n secrecy observed, and the freetrade (in our part) went by force as\r\n much as stealth, I had soon got together a knowledge of the signals in\r\n use, and knew pretty well to an hour when any messenger might be\r\n expected. I say, I questioned the tenants; for with the traders\r\n themselves, desperate blades that went habitually armed, I could never\r\n bring myself to meddle willingly. Indeed, by what proved in the sequel\r\n an unhappy chance, I was an object of scorn to some of these\r\n braggadocios; who had not only gratified me with a nickname, but\r\n catching me one night upon a by-path, and being all (as they would\r\n have said) somewhat merry, had caused me to dance for their diversion.\r\n The method employed was that of cruelly chipping at my toes with naked\r\n cutlasses, shouting at the same time \xe2\x80\x9cSquare-Toes\xe2\x80\x9d; and though they\r\n did me no bodily mischief, I was none the less deplorably affected,\r\n and was indeed for several days confined to my bed: a scandal on the\r\n state of Scotland on which no comment is required.\r\n\r\nIt happened on the afternoon of November 7th, in this same unfortunate\r\nyear, that I espied, during my walk, the smoke of a beacon fire upon\r\nthe Muckleross. It was drawing near time for my return; but the\r\nuneasiness upon my spirits was that day so great that I must burst\r\nthrough the thickets to the edge of what they call the Craig Head. The\r\nsun was already down, but there was still a broad light in the west,\r\nwhich showed me some of the smugglers treading out their signal fire\r\nupon the Ross, and in the bay the lugger lying with her sails brailed\r\nup. She was plainly but new come to anchor, and yet the skiff was\r\nalready lowered and pulling for the landing-place at the end of the\r\nlong shrubbery. And this I knew could signify but one thing, the coming\r\nof a messenger for Durrisdeer.\r\n\r\nI laid aside the remainder of my terrors, clambered down the brae\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nplace I had never ventured through before, and was hid among the\r\nshore-side thickets in time to see the boat touch. Captain Crail\r\nhimself was steering, a thing not usual; by his side there sat a\r\npassenger; and the men gave way with difficulty, being hampered with\r\nnear upon half a dozen portmanteaus, great and small. But the business\r\nof landing was briskly carried through; and presently the baggage was\r\nall tumbled on shore, the boat on its return voyage to the lugger, and\r\nthe passenger standing alone upon the point of rock, a tall slender\r\nfigure of a gentleman, habited in black, with a sword by his side and a\r\nwalking-cane upon his wrist. As he so stood, he waved the cane to\r\nCaptain Crail by way of salutation, with something both of grace and\r\nmockery that wrote the gesture deeply on my mind.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the boat away with my sworn enemies than I took a sort of\r\nhalf courage, came forth to the margin of the thicket, and there halted\r\nagain, my mind being greatly pulled about between natural diffidence\r\nand a dark foreboding of the truth. Indeed, I might have stood there\r\nswithering all night, had not the stranger turned, spied me through the\r\nmists, which were beginning to fall, and waved and cried on me to draw\r\nnear. I did so with a heart like lead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, my good man,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in the English accent, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are some\r\nthings for Durrisdeer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was now near enough to see him, a very handsome figure and\r\ncountenance, swarthy, lean, long, with a quick, alert, black look, as\r\nof one who was a fighter, and accustomed to command; upon one cheek he\r\nhad a mole, not unbecoming; a large diamond sparkled on his hand; his\r\nclothes, although of the one hue, were of a French and foppish design;\r\nhis ruffles, which he wore longer than common, of exquisite lace; and I\r\nwondered the more to see him in such a guise when he was but newly\r\nlanded from a dirty smuggling lugger. At the same time he had a better\r\nlook at me, toised me a second time sharply, and then smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wager, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I know both your name and your\r\nnickname. I divined these very clothes upon your hand of writing, Mr.\r\nMackellar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words I fell to shaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou need not be afraid of me. I bear no malice for your\r\ntedious letters; and it is my purpose to employ you a good deal. You\r\nmay call me Mr. Bally: it is the name I have assumed; or rather (since\r\nI am addressing so great a precision) it is so I have curtailed my own.\r\nCome now, pick up that and that\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94indicating two of the portmanteaus.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be as much as you are fit to bear, and the rest can very\r\nwell wait. Come, lose no more time, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis tone was so cutting that I managed to do as he bid by a sort of\r\ninstinct, my mind being all the time quite lost. No sooner had I picked\r\nup the portmanteaus than he turned his back and marched off through the\r\nlong shrubbery, where it began already to be dusk, for the wood is\r\nthick and evergreen. I followed behind, loaded almost to the dust,\r\nthough I profess I was not conscious of the burthen; being swallowed up\r\nin the monstrosity of this return, and my mind flying like a weaver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshuttle.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden I set the portmanteaus to the ground and halted. He turned\r\nand looked back at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the Master of Ballantrae?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do me the justice to observe,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI have made no\r\nsecret with the astute Mackellar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in the name of God,\xe2\x80\x9d cries I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat brings you here? Go back,\r\nwhile it is yet time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYour master has chosen this way, and not I;\r\nbut since he has made the choice, he (and you also) must abide by the\r\nresult. And now pick up these things of mine, which you have set down\r\nin a very boggy place, and attend to that which I have made your\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I had no thought now of obedience; I came straight up to him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nnothing will move you to go back,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cthough, sure, under all the\r\ncircumstances, any Christian or even any gentleman would scruple to go\r\nforward . . . \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are gratifying expressions,\xe2\x80\x9d he threw in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf nothing will move you to go back,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are still\r\nsome decencies to be observed. Wait here with your baggage, and I will\r\ngo forward and prepare your family. Your father is an old man; and . .\r\n. \xe2\x80\x9d I stumbled . . . \xe2\x80\x9cthere are decencies to be observed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthis Mackellar improves upon acquaintance. But look\r\nyou here, my man, and understand it once for all\xe2\x80\x94you waste your breath\r\nupon me, and I go my own way with inevitable motion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that so? We shall see then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I turned and took to my heels for Durrisdeer. He clutched at me and\r\ncried out angrily, and then I believe I heard him laugh, and then I am\r\ncertain he pursued me for a step or two, and (I suppose) desisted. One\r\nthing at least is sure, that I came but a few minutes later to the door\r\nof the great house, nearly strangled for the lack of breath, but quite\r\nalone. Straight up the stair I ran, and burst into the hall, and\r\nstopped before the family without the power of speech; but I must have\r\ncarried my story in my looks, for they rose out of their places and\r\nstared on me like changelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has come,\xe2\x80\x9d I panted out at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHimself,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son?\xe2\x80\x9d cried my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cImprudent, imprudent boy! Oh, could he not\r\nstay where he was safe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever a word says Mrs. Henry; nor did I look at her, I scarce knew why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry, with a very deep breath, \xe2\x80\x9cand where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left him in the long shrubbery,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nSo we went out together, he and I, without another word from any one;\r\nand in the midst of the gravelled plot encountered the Master strolling\r\nup, whistling as he came, and beating the air with his cane. There was\r\nstill light enough overhead to recognise, though not to read, a\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Jacob,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cSo here is Esau back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJames,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry, \xe2\x80\x9cfor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, call me by my name. I will\r\nnot pretend that I am glad to see you; but I would fain make you as\r\nwelcome as I can in the house of our fathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr in _my_ house? or _yours_?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich were you about\r\nto say? But this is an old sore, and we need not rub it. If you would\r\nnot share with me in Paris, I hope you will yet scarce deny your elder\r\nbrother a corner of the fire at Durrisdeer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very idle speech,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you understand the\r\npower of your position excellently well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I believe I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other with a little laugh. And this,\r\nthough they had never touched hands, was (as we may say) the end of the\r\nbrothers\xe2\x80\x99 meeting; for at this the Master turned to me and bade me\r\nfetch his baggage.\r\n\r\nI, on my side, turned to Mr. Henry for a confirmation; perhaps with\r\nsome defiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as the Master is here, Mr. Mackellar, you will very much\r\noblige me by regarding his wishes as you would my own,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are constantly troubling you: will you be so good as send one of\r\nthe servants?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with an accent on the word.\r\n\r\nIf this speech were anything at all, it was surely a well-deserved\r\nreproof upon the stranger; and yet, so devilish was his impudence, he\r\ntwisted it the other way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall we be common enough to say \xe2\x80\x98Sneck up\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d inquires he softly,\r\nlooking upon me sideways.\r\n\r\nHad a kingdom depended on the act, I could not have trusted myself in\r\nwords; even to call a servant was beyond me; I had rather serve the man\r\nmyself than speak; and I turned away in silence and went into the long\r\nshrubbery, with a heart full of anger and despair. It was dark under\r\nthe trees, and I walked before me and forgot what business I was come\r\nupon, till I near broke my shin on the portmanteaus. Then it was that I\r\nremarked a strange particular; for whereas I had before carried both\r\nand scarce observed it, it was now as much as I could do to manage one.\r\nAnd this, as it forced me to make two journeys, kept me the longer from\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\nWhen I got there, the business of welcome was over long ago; the\r\ncompany was already at supper; and by an oversight that cut me to the\r\nquick, my place had been forgotten. I had seen one side of the Master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn; now I was to see the other. It was he who first remarked my\r\ncoming in and standing back (as I did) in some annoyance. He jumped\r\nfrom his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I have not got the good Mackellar\xe2\x80\x99s place!\xe2\x80\x9d cries he. \xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\r\nlay another for Mr. Bally; I protest he will disturb no one, and your\r\ntable is big enough for all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could scarce credit my ears, nor yet my senses, when he took me by\r\nthe shoulders and thrust me, laughing, into my own place\xe2\x80\x94such an\r\naffectionate playfulness was in his voice. And while John laid the\r\nfresh place for him (a thing on which he still insisted), he went and\r\nleaned on his father\xe2\x80\x99s chair and looked down upon him, and the old man\r\nturned about and looked upwards on his son, with such a pleasant mutual\r\ntenderness that I could have carried my hand to my head in mere\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nYet all was of a piece. Never a harsh word fell from him, never a sneer\r\nshowed upon his lip. He had laid aside even his cutting English accent,\r\nand spoke with the kindly Scots\xe2\x80\x99 tongue, that set a value on\r\naffectionate words; and though his manners had a graceful elegance\r\nmighty foreign to our ways in Durrisdeer, it was still a homely\r\ncourtliness, that did not shame but flattered us. All that, he did\r\nthroughout the meal, indeed, drinking wine with me with a notable\r\nrespect, turning about for a pleasant word with John, fondling his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s hand, breaking into little merry tales of his adventures,\r\ncalling up the past with happy reference\xe2\x80\x94all he did was so becoming,\r\nand himself so handsome, that I could scarce wonder if my lord and Mrs.\r\nHenry sat about the board with radiant faces, or if John waited behind\r\nwith dropping tears.\r\n\r\nAs soon as supper was over, Mrs. Henry rose to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was never your way, Alison,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my way now,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied: which was notoriously false, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nwill give you a good-night, James, and a welcome\xe2\x80\x94from the dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe, and her voice dropped and trembled.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Henry, who had made rather a heavy figure through the meal,\r\nwas more concerned than ever; pleased to see his wife withdraw, and yet\r\nhalf displeased, as he thought upon the cause of it; and the next\r\nmoment altogether dashed by the fervour of her speech.\r\n\r\nOn my part, I thought I was now one too many; and was stealing after\r\nMrs. Henry, when the Master saw me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI take this near on an unfriendliness.\r\nI cannot have you go: this is to make a stranger of the prodigal son;\r\nand let me remind you where\xe2\x80\x94in his own father\xe2\x80\x99s house! Come, sit ye\r\ndown, and drink another glass with Mr. Bally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Mr. Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must not make a stranger\r\neither of him or you. I have been telling my son,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, his voice\r\nbrightening as usual on the word, \xe2\x80\x9chow much we valued all your friendly\r\nservice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I sat there, silent, till my usual hour; and might have been almost\r\ndeceived in the man\xe2\x80\x99s nature but for one passage, in which his perfidy\r\nappeared too plain. Here was the passage; of which, after what he knows\r\nof the brothers\xe2\x80\x99 meeting, the reader shall consider for himself. Mr.\r\nHenry sitting somewhat dully, in spite of his best endeavours to carry\r\nthings before my lord, up jumps the Master, passes about the board, and\r\nclaps his brother on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, _Hairry lad_,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, with a broad accent such as they\r\nmust have used together when they were boys, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not be downcast\r\nbecause your brother has come home. All\xe2\x80\x99s yours, that\xe2\x80\x99s sure enough,\r\nand little I grudge it you. Neither must you grudge me my place beside\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is too true, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d says my old lord with a little frown, a\r\nthing rare with him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been the elder brother of the parable in\r\nthe good sense; you must be careful of the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am easily put in the wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho puts you in the wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d cried my lord, I thought very tartly for\r\nso mild a man. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have earned my gratitude and your brother\xe2\x80\x99s many\r\nthousand times: you may count on its endurance; and let that suffice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Harry, that you may,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master; and I thought Mr. Henry\r\nlooked at him with a kind of wildness in his eye.\r\n\r\nOn all the miserable business that now followed, I have four questions\r\nthat I asked myself often at the time and ask myself still:\xe2\x80\x94Was the man\r\nmoved by a particular sentiment against Mr. Henry? or by what he\r\nthought to be his interest? or by a mere delight in cruelty such as\r\ncats display and theologians tell us of the devil? or by what he would\r\nhave called love? My common opinion halts among the three first; but\r\nperhaps there lay at the spring of his behaviour an element of all. As\r\nthus:\xe2\x80\x94Animosity to Mr. Henry would explain his hateful usage of him\r\nwhen they were alone; the interests he came to serve would explain his\r\nvery different attitude before my lord; that and some spice of a design\r\nof gallantry, his care to stand well with Mrs. Henry; and the pleasure\r\nof malice for itself, the pains he was continually at to mingle and\r\noppose these lines of conduct.\r\n\r\nPartly because I was a very open friend to my patron, partly because in\r\nmy letters to Paris I had often given myself some freedom of\r\nremonstrance, I was included in his diabolical amusement. When I was\r\nalone with him, he pursued me with sneers; before the family he used me\r\nwith the extreme of friendly condescension. This was not only painful\r\nin itself; not only did it put me continually in the wrong; but there\r\nwas in it an element of insult indescribable. That he should thus leave\r\nme out in his dissimulation, as though even my testimony were too\r\ndespicable to be considered, galled me to the blood. But what it was to\r\nme is not worth notice. I make but memorandum of it here; and chiefly\r\nfor this reason, that it had one good result, and gave me the quicker\r\nsense of Mr. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s martyrdom.\r\n\r\nIt was on him the burthen fell. How was he to respond to the public\r\nadvances of one who never lost a chance of gibing him in private? How\r\nwas he to smile back on the deceiver and the insulter? He was condemned\r\nto seem ungracious. He was condemned to silence. Had he been less\r\nproud, had he spoken, who would have credited the truth? The acted\r\ncalumny had done its work; my lord and Mrs. Henry were the daily\r\nwitnesses of what went on; they could have sworn in court that the\r\nMaster was a model of long-suffering good-nature, and Mr. Henry a\r\npattern of jealousy and thanklessness. And ugly enough as these must\r\nhave appeared in any one, they seemed tenfold uglier in Mr. Henry; for\r\nwho could forget that the Master lay in peril of his life, and that he\r\nhad already lost his mistress, his title, and his fortune?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry, will you ride with me?\xe2\x80\x9d asks the Master one day.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Henry, who had been goaded by the man all morning, raps out: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes wish you would be kinder, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d says the other,\r\nwistfully.\r\n\r\nI give this for a specimen; but such scenes befell continually. Small\r\nwonder if Mr. Henry was blamed; small wonder if I fretted myself into\r\nsomething near upon a bilious fever; nay, and at the mere recollection\r\nfeel a bitterness in my blood.\r\n\r\nSure, never in this world was a more diabolical contrivance: so\r\nperfidious, so simple, so impossible to combat. And yet I think again,\r\nand I think always, Mrs. Henry might have read between the lines; she\r\nmight have had more knowledge of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s nature; after all these\r\nyears of marriage she might have commanded or captured his confidence.\r\nAnd my old lord, too\xe2\x80\x94that very watchful gentleman\xe2\x80\x94where was all his\r\nobservation? But, for one thing, the deceit was practised by a master\r\nhand, and might have gulled an angel. For another (in the case of Mrs.\r\nHenry), I have observed there are no persons so far away as those who\r\nare both married and estranged, so that they seem out of ear-shot or to\r\nhave no common tongue. For a third (in the case of both of these\r\nspectators), they were blinded by old ingrained predilection. And for a\r\nfourth, the risk the Master was supposed to stand in (supposed, I\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94you will soon hear why) made it seem the more ungenerous to\r\ncriticise; and, keeping them in a perpetual tender solicitude about his\r\nlife, blinded them the more effectually to his faults.\r\n\r\nIt was during this time that I perceived most clearly the effect of\r\nmanner, and was led to lament most deeply the plainness of my own. Mr.\r\nHenry had the essence of a gentleman; when he was moved, when there was\r\nany call of circumstance, he could play his part with dignity and\r\nspirit; but in the day\xe2\x80\x99s commerce (it is idle to deny it) he fell short\r\nof the ornamental. The Master (on the other hand) had never a movement\r\nbut it commanded him. So it befell that when the one appeared gracious\r\nand the other ungracious, every trick of their bodies seemed to call\r\nout confirmation. Not that alone: but the more deeply Mr. Henry\r\nfloundered in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s toils, the more clownish he grew; and the\r\nmore the Master enjoyed his spiteful entertainment, the more\r\nengagingly, the more smilingly, he went! So that the plot, by its own\r\nscope and progress, furthered and confirmed itself.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the man\xe2\x80\x99s arts to use the peril in which (as I say) he\r\nwas supposed to stand. He spoke of it to those who loved him with a\r\ngentle pleasantry, which made it the more touching. To Mr. Henry he\r\nused it as a cruel weapon of offence. I remember his laying his finger\r\non the clean lozenge of the painted window one day when we three were\r\nalone together in the hall. \xe2\x80\x9cHere went your lucky guinea, Jacob,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe. And when Mr. Henry only looked upon him darkly, \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou need not look such impotent malice, my good fly. You can be rid of\r\nyour spider when you please. How long, O Lord? When are you to be\r\nwrought to the point of a denunciation, scrupulous brother? It is one\r\nof my interests in this dreary hole. I ever loved experiment.\xe2\x80\x9d Still\r\nMr. Henry only stared upon him with a grooming brow, and a changed\r\ncolour; and at last the Master broke out in a laugh and clapped him on\r\nthe shoulder, calling him a sulky dog. At this my patron leaped back\r\nwith a gesture I thought very dangerous; and I must suppose the Master\r\nthought so too, for he looked the least in the world discountenance,\r\nand I do not remember him again to have laid hands on Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\nBut though he had his peril always on his lips in the one way or the\r\nother, I thought his conduct strangely incautious, and began to fancy\r\nthe Government\xe2\x80\x94who had set a price upon his head\xe2\x80\x94was gone sound asleep.\r\nI will not deny I was tempted with the wish to denounce him; but two\r\nthoughts withheld me: one, that if he were thus to end his life upon an\r\nhonourable scaffold, the man would be canonised for good in the minds\r\nof his father and my patron\xe2\x80\x99s wife; the other, that if I was anyway\r\nmingled in the matter, Mr. Henry himself would scarce escape some\r\nglancings of suspicion. And in the meanwhile our enemy went in and out\r\nmore than I could have thought possible, the fact that he was home\r\nagain was buzzed about all the country-side, and yet he was never\r\nstirred. Of all these so-many and so-different persons who were\r\nacquainted with his presence, none had the least greed\xe2\x80\x94as I used to say\r\nin my annoyance\xe2\x80\x94or the least loyalty; and the man rode here and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94fully more welcome, considering the lees of old unpopularity,\r\nthan Mr. Henry\xe2\x80\x94and considering the freetraders, far safer than myself.\r\n\r\nNot but what he had a trouble of his own; and this, as it brought about\r\nthe gravest consequences, I must now relate. The reader will scarce\r\nhave forgotten Jessie Broun; her way of life was much among the\r\nsmuggling party; Captain Crail himself was of her intimates; and she\r\nhad early word of Mr. Bally\xe2\x80\x99s presence at the house. In my opinion, she\r\nhad long ceased to care two straws for the Master\xe2\x80\x99s person; but it was\r\nbecome her habit to connect herself continually with the Master\xe2\x80\x99s name;\r\nthat was the ground of all her play-acting; and so now, when he was\r\nback, she thought she owed it to herself to grow a haunter of the\r\nneighbourhood of Durrisdeer. The Master could scarce go abroad but she\r\nwas there in wait for him; a scandalous figure of a woman, not often\r\nsober; hailing him wildly as \xe2\x80\x9cher bonny laddie,\xe2\x80\x9d quoting pedlar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npoetry, and, as I receive the story, even seeking to weep upon his\r\nneck. I own I rubbed my hands over this persecution; but the Master,\r\nwho laid so much upon others, was himself the least patient of men.\r\nThere were strange scenes enacted in the policies. Some say he took his\r\ncane to her, and Jessie fell back upon her former weapons\xe2\x80\x94stones. It is\r\ncertain at least that he made a motion to Captain Crail to have the\r\nwoman trepanned, and that the Captain refused the proposition with\r\nuncommon vehemence. And the end of the matter was victory for Jessie.\r\nMoney was got together; an interview took place, in which my proud\r\ngentleman must consent to be kissed and wept upon; and the woman was\r\nset up in a public of her own, somewhere on Solway side (but I forget\r\nwhere), and, by the only news I ever had of it, extremely\r\nill-frequented.\r\n\r\nThis is to look forward. After Jessie had been but a little while upon\r\nhis heels, the Master comes to me one day in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s office, and\r\nwith more civility than usual, \xe2\x80\x9cMackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a damned\r\ncrazy wench comes about here. I cannot well move in the matter myself,\r\nwhich brings me to you. Be so good as to see to it: the men must have a\r\nstrict injunction to drive the wench away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, trembling a little, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can do your own dirty errands\r\nfor yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said not a word to that, and left the room.\r\n\r\nPresently came Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is news!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems all is\r\nnot enough, and you must add to my wretchedness. It seems you have\r\ninsulted Mr. Bally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder your kind favour, Mr. Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cit was he that insulted\r\nme, and, as I think, grossly. But I may have been careless of your\r\nposition when I spoke; and if you think so when you know all, my dear\r\npatron, you have but to say the word. For you I would obey in any point\r\nwhatever, even to sin, God pardon me!\xe2\x80\x9d And thereupon I told him what\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry smiled to himself; a grimmer smile I never witnessed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndid exactly well,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHe shall drink his Jessie Broun to the\r\ndregs.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, spying the Master outside, he opened the window, and\r\ncrying to him by the name of Mr. Bally, asked him to step up and have a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJames,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when our persecutor had come in and closed the door\r\nbehind him, looking at me with a smile, as if he thought I was to be\r\nhumbled, \xe2\x80\x9cyou brought me a complaint against Mr. Mackellar, into which\r\nI have inquired. I need not tell you I would always take his word\r\nagainst yours; for we are alone, and I am going to use something of\r\nyour own freedom. Mr. Mackellar is a gentleman I value; and you must\r\ncontrive, so long as you are under this roof, to bring yourself into no\r\nmore collisions with one whom I will support at any possible cost to me\r\nor mine. As for the errand upon which you came to him, you must deliver\r\nyourself from the consequences of your own cruelty, and, none of my\r\nservants shall be at all employed in such a case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father\xe2\x80\x99s servants, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to him with this tale,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\nThe Master grew very white. He pointed at me with his finger. \xe2\x80\x9cI want\r\nthat man discharged,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall not be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall pay pretty dear for this,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have paid so dear already for a wicked brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I am bankrupt even of fears. You have no place left where you can\r\nstrike me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will show you about that,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master, and went softly away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will he do next, Mackellar?\xe2\x80\x9d cries Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go away,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear patron, let me go away; I am but the\r\nbeginning of fresh sorrows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you leave me quite alone?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n We were not long in suspense as to the nature of the new assault. Up\r\n to that hour the Master had played a very close game with Mrs. Henry;\r\n avoiding pointedly to be alone with her, which I took at the time for\r\n an effect of decency, but now think to be a most insidious art;\r\n meeting her, you may say, at meal-time only; and behaving, when he did\r\n so, like an affectionate brother. Up to that hour, you may say he had\r\n scarce directly interfered between Mr. Henry and his wife; except in\r\n so far as he had manoeuvred the one quite forth from the good graces\r\n of the other. Now all that was to be changed; but whether really in\r\n revenge, or because he was wearying of Durrisdeer and looked about for\r\n some diversion, who but the devil shall decide?\r\n\r\nFrom that hour, at least, began the siege of Mrs. Henry; a thing so\r\ndeftly carried on that I scarce know if she was aware of it herself,\r\nand that her husband must look on in silence. The first parallel was\r\nopened (as was made to appear) by accident. The talk fell, as it did\r\noften, on the exiles in France; so it glided to the matter of their\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master, \xe2\x80\x9cif you are curious in these matters,\r\nthat has always seemed to me very moving. The poetry is harsh; and yet,\r\nperhaps because of my situation, it has always found the way to my\r\nheart. It is supposed to be sung, I should tell you, by an exile\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsweetheart; and represents perhaps, not so much the truth of what she\r\nis thinking, as the truth of what he hopes of her, poor soul! in these\r\nfar lands.\xe2\x80\x9d And here the Master sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cI protest it is a pathetic\r\nsight when a score of rough Irish, all common sentinels, get to this\r\nsong; and you may see, by their falling tears, how it strikes home to\r\nthem. It goes thus, father,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, very adroitly taking my lord for\r\nhis listener, \xe2\x80\x9cand if I cannot get to the end of it, you must think it\r\nis a common case with us exiles.\xe2\x80\x9d And thereupon he struck up the same\r\nair as I had heard the Colonel whistle; but now to words, rustic\r\nindeed, yet most pathetically setting forth a poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations\r\nfor an exiled lover; of which one verse indeed (or something like it)\r\nstill sticks by me:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nO, I will dye my petticoat red,\r\nWith my dear boy I\xe2\x80\x99ll beg my bread,\r\nThough all my friends should wish me dead,\r\n        For Willie among the rushes, O!\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sang it well, even as a song; but he did better yet a performer. I\r\nhave heard famous actors, when there was not a dry eye in the Edinburgh\r\ntheatre; a great wonder to behold; but no more wonderful than how the\r\nMaster played upon that little ballad, and on those who heard him, like\r\nan instrument, and seemed now upon the point of failing, and now to\r\nconquer his distress, so that words and music seemed to pour out of his\r\nown heart and his own past, and to be aimed directly at Mrs. Henry. And\r\nhis art went further yet; for all was so delicately touched, it seemed\r\nimpossible to suspect him of the least design; and so far from making a\r\nparade of emotion, you would have sworn he was striving to be calm.\r\nWhen it came to an end, we all sat silent for a time; he had chosen the\r\ndusk of the afternoon, so that none could see his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s face; but\r\nit seemed as if we held our breathing; only my old lord cleared his\r\nthroat. The first to move was the singer, who got to his feet suddenly\r\nand softly, and went and walked softly to and fro in the low end of the\r\nhall, Mr. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s customary place. We were to suppose that he there\r\nstruggled down the last of his emotion; for he presently returned and\r\nlaunched into a disquisition on the nature of the Irish (always so much\r\nmiscalled, and whom he defended) in his natural voice; so that, before\r\nthe lights were brought, we were in the usual course of talk. But even\r\nthen, methought Mrs. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s face was a shade pale; and, for another\r\nthing, she withdrew almost at once.\r\n\r\nThe next sign was a friendship this insidious devil struck up with\r\ninnocent Miss Katharine; so that they were always together, hand in\r\nhand, or she climbing on his knee, like a pair of children. Like all\r\nhis diabolical acts, this cut in several ways. It was the last stroke\r\nto Mr. Henry, to see his own babe debauched against him; it made him\r\nharsh with the poor innocent, which brought him still a peg lower in\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s esteem; and (to conclude) it was a bond of union between the\r\nlady and the Master. Under this influence, their old reserve melted by\r\ndaily stages. Presently there came walks in the long shrubbery, talks\r\nin the Belvedere, and I know not what tender familiarity. I am sure\r\nMrs. Henry was like many a good woman; she had a whole conscience but\r\nperhaps by the means of a little winking. For even to so dull an\r\nobserver as myself, it was plain her kindness was of a more moving\r\nnature than the sisterly. The tones of her voice appeared more\r\nnumerous; she had a light and softness in her eye; she was more gentle\r\nwith all of us, even with Mr. Henry, even with myself; methought she\r\nbreathed of some quiet melancholy happiness.\r\n\r\nTo look on at this, what a torment it was for Mr. Henry! And yet it\r\nbrought our ultimate deliverance, as I am soon to tell.\r\n\r\n The purport of the Master\xe2\x80\x99s stay was no more noble (gild it as they\r\n might) than to wring money out. He had some design of a fortune in the\r\n French Indies, as the Chevalier wrote me; and it was the sum required\r\n for this that he came seeking. For the rest of the family it spelled\r\n ruin; but my lord, in his incredible partiality, pushed ever for the\r\n granting. The family was now so narrowed down (indeed, there were no\r\n more of them than just the father and the two sons) that it was\r\n possible to break the entail and alienate a piece of land. And to\r\n this, at first by hints, and then by open pressure, Mr. Henry was\r\n brought to consent. He never would have done so, I am very well\r\n assured, but for the weight of the distress under which he laboured.\r\n But for his passionate eagerness to see his brother gone, he would not\r\n thus have broken with his own sentiment and the traditions of his\r\n house. And even so, he sold them his consent at a dear rate, speaking\r\n for once openly, and holding the business up in its own shameful\r\n colours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will observe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is an injustice to my son, if ever I\r\nhave one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that you are not likely to have,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd considering the cruel falseness of\r\nthe position in which I stand to my brother, and that you, my lord, are\r\nmy father, and have the right to command me, I set my hand to this\r\npaper. But one thing I will say first: I have been ungenerously pushed,\r\nand when next, my lord, you are tempted to compare your sons, I call on\r\nyou to remember what I have done and what he has done. Acts are the\r\nfair test.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord was the most uneasy man I ever saw; even in his old face the\r\nblood came up. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this is not a very wisely chosen moment, Henry,\r\nfor complaints,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThis takes away from the merit of your\r\ngenerosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not deceive yourself, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cThis injustice is\r\nnot done from generosity to him, but in obedience to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore strangers . . . \xe2\x80\x9d begins my lord, still more unhappily\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no one but Mackellar here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry; \xe2\x80\x9che is my friend.\r\nAnd, my lord, as you make him no stranger to your frequent blame, it\r\nwere hard if I must keep him one to a thing so rare as my defence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost I believe my lord would have rescinded his decision; but the\r\nMaster was on the watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Henry, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are the best of us still. Rugged and\r\ntrue! Ah! man, I wish I was as good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd at that instance of his favourite\xe2\x80\x99s generosity my lord desisted\r\nfrom his hesitation, and the deed was signed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it could he brought about, the land of Ochterhall was sold\r\nfor much below its value, and the money paid over to our leech and sent\r\nby some private carriage into France. Or so he said; though I have\r\nsuspected since it did not go so far. And now here was all the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness brought to a successful head, and his pockets once more\r\nbulging with our gold; and yet the point for which we had consented to\r\nthis sacrifice was still denied us, and the visitor still lingered on\r\nat Durrisdeer. Whether in malice, or because the time was not yet come\r\nfor his adventure to the Indies, or because he had hopes of his design\r\non Mrs. Henry, or from the orders of the Government, who shall say? but\r\nlinger he did, and that for weeks.\r\n\r\nYou will observe I say: from the orders of Government; for about this\r\ntime the man\xe2\x80\x99s disreputable secret trickled out.\r\n\r\nThe first hint I had was from a tenant, who commented on the Master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstay, and yet more on his security; for this tenant was a Jacobitish\r\nsympathiser, and had lost a son at Culloden, which gave him the more\r\ncritical eye. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I cannot but think\r\nstrange; and that is how he got to Cockermouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Cockermouth?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with a sudden memory of my first wonder on\r\nbeholding the man disembark so point-de-vice after so long a voyage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d says the tenant, \xe2\x80\x9cit was there he was picked up by Captain\r\nCrail. You thought he had come from France by sea? And so we all did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned this news a little in my head, and then carried it to Mr.\r\nHenry. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is an odd circumstance,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, and told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matters how he came, Mackellar, so long as he is here?\xe2\x80\x9d groans\r\nMr. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cbut think again! Does not this smack a little of\r\nsome Government connivance? You know how much we have wondered already\r\nat the man\xe2\x80\x99s security.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me think of this.\xe2\x80\x9d And as he thought,\r\nthere came that grim smile upon his face that was a little like the\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me paper,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. And he sat without another word and\r\nwrote to a gentleman of his acquaintance\xe2\x80\x94I will name no unnecessary\r\nnames, but he was one in a high place. This letter I despatched by the\r\nonly hand I could depend upon in such a case\xe2\x80\x94Macconochie\xe2\x80\x99s; and the old\r\nman rode hard, for he was back with the reply before even my eagerness\r\nhad ventured to expect him. Again, as he read it, Mr. Henry had the\r\nsame grim smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the best you have done for me yet, Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cWith\r\nthis in my hand I will give him a shog. Watch for us at dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt dinner accordingly Mr. Henry proposed some very public appearance\r\nfor the Master; and my lord, as he had hoped, objected to the danger of\r\nthe course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry, very easily, \xe2\x80\x9cyou need no longer keep this up\r\nwith me. I am as much in the secret as yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the secret?\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Henry? I give you my\r\nword, I am in no secret from which you are excluded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Master had changed countenance, and I saw he was struck in a joint\r\nof his harness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry, turning to him with a huge appearance of\r\nsurprise. \xe2\x80\x9cI see you serve your masters very faithfully; but I had\r\nthought you would have been humane enough to set your father\xe2\x80\x99s mind at\r\nrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking of? I refuse to have my business publicly\r\ndiscussed. I order this to cease,\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Master very foolishly and\r\npassionately, and indeed more like a child than a man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much discretion was not looked for at your hands, I can assure\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cFor see what my correspondent\r\nwrites\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94unfolding the paper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is, of course, in the interests both\r\nof the Government and the gentleman whom we may perhaps best continue\r\nto call Mr. Bally, to keep this understanding secret; but it was never\r\nmeant his own family should continue to endure the suspense you paint\r\nso feelingly; and I am pleased mine should be the hand to set these\r\nfears at rest. Mr. Bally is as safe in Great Britain as yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this possible?\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord, looking at his son, with a great\r\ndeal of wonder and still more of suspicion in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear father,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master, already much recovered. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\noverjoyed that this may be disclosed. My own instructions, direct from\r\nLondon, bore a very contrary sense, and I was charged to keep the\r\nindulgence secret from every one, yourself not excepted, and indeed\r\nyourself expressly named\xe2\x80\x94as I can show in black and white unless I have\r\ndestroyed the letter. They must have changed their mind very swiftly,\r\nfor the whole matter is still quite fresh; or rather, Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncorrespondent must have misconceived that part, as he seems to have\r\nmisconceived the rest. To tell you the truth, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\ngetting visibly more easy, \xe2\x80\x9cI had supposed this unexplained favour to a\r\nrebel was the effect of some application from yourself; and the\r\ninjunction to secrecy among my family the result of a desire on your\r\npart to conceal your kindness. Hence I was the more careful to obey\r\norders. It remains now to guess by what other channel indulgence can\r\nhave flowed on so notorious an offender as myself; for I do not think\r\nyour son need defend himself from what seems hinted at in Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter. I have never yet heard of a Durrisdeer who was a turncoat or a\r\nspy,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, proudly.\r\n\r\nAnd so it seemed he had swum out of this danger unharmed; but this was\r\nto reckon without a blunder he had made, and without the pertinacity of\r\nMr. Henry, who was now to show he had something of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say the matter is still fresh,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is recent,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master, with a fair show of stoutness and yet\r\nnot without a quaver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it so recent as that?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Mr. Henry, like a man a little puzzled,\r\nand spreading his letter forth again.\r\n\r\nIn all the letter there was no word as to the date; but how was the\r\nMaster to know that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed to come late enough for me,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, with a laugh. And at\r\nthe sound of that laugh, which rang false, like a cracked bell, my lord\r\nlooked at him again across the table, and I saw his old lips draw\r\ntogether close.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry, still glancing on his letter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I remember\r\nyour expression. You said it was very fresh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here we had a proof of our victory, and the strongest instance yet\r\nof my lord\xe2\x80\x99s incredible indulgence; for what must he do but interfere\r\nto save his favourite from exposure!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, with a kind of pitiful eagerness, \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nwe need dispute no more. We are all rejoiced at last to find your\r\nbrother safe; we are all at one on that; and, as grateful subjects, we\r\ncan do no less than drink to the king\xe2\x80\x99s health and bounty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus was the Master extricated; but at least he had been put to his\r\ndefence, he had come lamely out, and the attraction of his personal\r\ndanger was now publicly plucked away from him. My lord, in his heart of\r\nhearts, now knew his favourite to be a Government spy; and Mrs. Henry\r\n(however she explained the tale) was notably cold in her behaviour to\r\nthe discredited hero of romance. Thus in the best fabric of duplicity,\r\nthere is some weak point, if you can strike it, which will loosen all;\r\nand if, by this fortunate stroke, we had not shaken the idol, who can\r\nsay how it might have gone with us at the catastrophe?\r\n\r\nAnd yet at the time we seemed to have accomplished nothing. Before a\r\nday or two he had wiped off the ill-results of his discomfiture, and,\r\nto all appearance, stood as high as ever. As for my Lord Durrisdeer, he\r\nwas sunk in parental partiality; it was not so much love, which should\r\nbe an active quality, as an apathy and torpor of his other powers; and\r\nforgiveness (so to mis-apply a noble word) flowed from him in sheer\r\nweakness, like the tears of senility. Mrs. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s was a different\r\ncase; and Heaven alone knows what he found to say to her, or how he\r\npersuaded her from her contempt. It is one of the worst things of\r\nsentiment, that the voice grows to be more important than the words,\r\nand the speaker than that which is spoken. But some excuse the Master\r\nmust have found, or perhaps he had even struck upon some art to wrest\r\nthis exposure to his own advantage; for after a time of coldness, it\r\nseemed as if things went worse than ever between him and Mrs. Henry.\r\nThey were then constantly together. I would not be thought to cut one\r\nshadow of blame, beyond what is due to a half-wilful blindness, on that\r\nunfortunate lady; but I do think, in these last days, she was playing\r\nvery near the fire; and whether I be wrong or not in that, one thing is\r\nsure and quite sufficient: Mr. Henry thought so. The poor gentleman sat\r\nfor days in my room, so great a picture of distress that I could never\r\nventure to address him; yet it is to be thought he found some comfort\r\neven in my presence and the knowledge of my sympathy. There were times,\r\ntoo, when we talked, and a strange manner of talk it was; there was\r\nnever a person named, nor an individual circumstance referred to; yet\r\nwe had the same matter in our minds, and we were each aware of it. It\r\nis a strange art that can thus be practised; to talk for hours of a\r\nthing, and never name nor yet so much as hint at it. And I remember I\r\nwondered if it was by some such natural skill that the Master made love\r\nto Mrs. Henry all day long (as he manifestly did), yet never startled\r\nher into reserve.\r\n\r\nTo show how far affairs had gone with Mr. Henry, I will give some words\r\nof his, uttered (as I have cause not to forget) upon the 26th of\r\nFebruary, 1757. It was unseasonable weather, a cast back into Winter:\r\nwindless, bitter cold, the world all white with rime, the sky low and\r\ngray: the sea black and silent like a quarry-hole. Mr. Henry sat close\r\nby the fire, and debated (as was now common with him) whether \xe2\x80\x9ca man\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshould \xe2\x80\x9cdo things,\xe2\x80\x9d whether \xe2\x80\x9cinterference was wise,\xe2\x80\x9d and the like\r\ngeneral propositions, which each of us particularly applied. I was by\r\nthe window, looking out, when there passed below me the Master, Mrs.\r\nHenry, and Miss Katharine, that now constant trio. The child was\r\nrunning to and fro, delighted with the frost; the Master spoke close in\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s ear with what seemed (even from so far) a devilish grace of\r\ninsinuation; and she on her part looked on the ground like a person\r\nlost in listening. I broke out of my reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were you, Mr. Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI would deal openly with my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMackellar, Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do not see the weakness of my\r\nground. I can carry no such base thoughts to any one\xe2\x80\x94to my father least\r\nof all; that would be to fall into the bottom of his scorn. The\r\nweakness of my ground,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9clies in myself, that I am not\r\none who engages love. I have their gratitude, they all tell me that; I\r\nhave a rich estate of it! But I am not present in their minds; they are\r\nmoved neither to think with me nor to think for me. There is my loss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe got to his feet, and trod down the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cBut some method must be\r\nfound, Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking at me suddenly over his shoulder;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csome way must be found. I am a man of a great deal of patience\xe2\x80\x94far too\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94far too much. I begin to despise myself. And yet, sure, never was\r\na man involved in such a toil!\xe2\x80\x9d He fell back to his brooding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will burst of itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am far past anger now,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, which had so little coherency with\r\nmy own observation that I let both fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nACCOUNT OF ALL THAT PASSED ON THE NIGHT ON FEBRUARY 27TH, 1757.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the interview referred to, the Master went abroad; he\r\nwas abroad a great deal of the next day also, that fatal 27th; but\r\nwhere he went, or what he did, we never concerned ourselves to ask\r\nuntil next day. If we had done so, and by any chance found out, it\r\nmight have changed all. But as all we did was done in ignorance, and\r\nshould be so judged, I shall so narrate these passages as they appeared\r\nto us in the moment of their birth, and reserve all that I since\r\ndiscovered for the time of its discovery. For I have now come to one of\r\nthe dark parts of my narrative, and must engage the reader\xe2\x80\x99s indulgence\r\nfor my patron.\r\n\r\nAll the 27th that rigorous weather endured: a stifling cold; the folk\r\npassing about like smoking chimneys; the wide hearth in the hall piled\r\nhigh with fuel; some of the spring birds that had already blundered\r\nnorth into our neighbourhood, besieging the windows of the house or\r\ntrotting on the frozen turf like things distracted. About noon there\r\ncame a blink of sunshine, showing a very pretty, wintry, frosty\r\nlandscape of white hills and woods, with Crail\xe2\x80\x99s lugger waiting for a\r\nwind under the Craig Head, and the smoke mounting straight into the air\r\nfrom every farm and cottage. With the coming of night, the haze closed\r\nin overhead; it fell dark and still and starless, and exceeding cold: a\r\nnight the most unseasonable, fit for strange events.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henry withdrew, as was now her custom, very early. We had set\r\nourselves of late to pass the evening with a game of cards; another\r\nmark that our visitor was wearying mightily of the life at Durrisdeer;\r\nand we had not been long at this when my old lord slipped from his\r\nplace beside the fire, and was off without a word to seek the warmth of\r\nbed. The three thus left together had neither love nor courtesy to\r\nshare; not one of us would have sat up one instant to oblige another;\r\nyet from the influence of custom, and as the cards had just been dealt,\r\nwe continued the form of playing out the round. I should say we were\r\nlate sitters; and though my lord had departed earlier than was his\r\ncustom, twelve was already gone some time upon the clock, and the\r\nservants long ago in bed. Another thing I should say, that although I\r\nnever saw the Master anyway affected with liquor, he had been drinking\r\nfreely, and was perhaps (although he showed it not) a trifle heated.\r\n\r\nAnyway, he now practised one of his transitions; and so soon as the\r\ndoor closed behind my lord, and without the smallest change of voice,\r\nshifted from ordinary civil talk into a stream of insult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Henry, it is yours to play,\xe2\x80\x9d he had been saying, and now\r\ncontinued: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very strange thing how, even in so small a matter\r\nas a game of cards, you display your rusticity. You play, Jacob, like a\r\nbonnet laird, or a sailor in a tavern. The same dulness, the same petty\r\ngreed, _cette lenteur d\xe2\x80\x99heb\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 qui me fait rager_; it is strange I\r\nshould have such a brother. Even Square-toes has a certain vivacity\r\nwhen his stake is imperilled; but the dreariness of a game with you I\r\npositively lack language to depict.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Henry continued to look at his cards, as though very maturely\r\nconsidering some play; but his mind was elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear God, will this never be done?\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Master. \xe2\x80\x9c_Quel\r\nlourdeau_! But why do I trouble you with French expressions, which are\r\nlost on such an ignoramus? A _lourdeau_, my dear brother, is as we\r\nmight say a bumpkin, a clown, a clodpole: a fellow without grace,\r\nlightness, quickness; any gift of pleasing, any natural brilliancy:\r\nsuch a one as you shall see, when you desire, by looking in the mirror.\r\nI tell you these things for your good, I assure you; and besides,\r\nSquare-toes\xe2\x80\x9d (looking at me and stifling a yawn), \xe2\x80\x9cit is one of my\r\ndiversions in this very dreary spot to toast you and your master at the\r\nfire like chestnuts. I have great pleasure in your case, for I observe\r\nthe nickname (rustic as it is) has always the power to make you writhe.\r\nBut sometimes I have more trouble with this dear fellow here, who seems\r\nto have gone to sleep upon his cards. Do you not see the applicability\r\nof the epithet I have just explained, dear Henry? Let me show you. For\r\ninstance, with all those solid qualities which I delight to recognise\r\nin you, I never knew a woman who did not prefer me\xe2\x80\x94nor, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, with the most silken deliberation, \xe2\x80\x9cI think\xe2\x80\x94who did not\r\ncontinue to prefer me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Henry laid down his cards. He rose to his feet very softly, and\r\nseemed all the while like a person in deep thought. \xe2\x80\x9cYou coward!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid gently, as if to himself. And then, with neither hurry nor any\r\nparticular violence, he struck the Master in the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe Master sprang to his feet like one transfigured; I had never seen\r\nthe man so beautiful. \xe2\x80\x9cA blow!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not take a blow from\r\nGod Almighty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLower your voice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish my father to interfere\r\nfor you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, and sought to come between them.\r\n\r\nThe Master caught me by the shoulder, held me at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, and\r\nstill addressing his brother: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what this means?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the most deliberate act of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have blood, I must have blood for this,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease God it shall be yours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry; and he went to the wall\r\nand took down a pair of swords that hung there with others, naked.\r\nThese he presented to the Master by the points. \xe2\x80\x9cMackellar shall see us\r\nplay fair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it very needful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need insult me no more,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master, taking one of the swords\r\nat random. \xe2\x80\x9cI have hated you all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father is but newly gone to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must go\r\nsomewhere forth of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an excellent place in the long shrubbery,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cshame upon you both! Sons of the same mother,\r\nwould you turn against the life she gave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so, Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry, with the same perfect quietude of\r\nmanner he had shown throughout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is what I will prevent,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nAnd now here is a blot upon my life. At these words of mine the Master\r\nturned his blade against my bosom; I saw the light run along the steel;\r\nand I threw up my arms and fell to my knees before him on the floor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, like a baby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have no more trouble with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\ngood thing to have a coward in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have light,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry, as though there had been no\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis trembler can bring a pair of candles,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master.\r\n\r\nTo my shame be it said, I was still so blinded with the flashing of\r\nthat bare sword that I volunteered to bring a lantern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not need a l-l-lantern,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master, mocking me. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nno breath of air. Come, get to your feet, take a pair of lights, and go\r\nbefore. I am close behind with this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d making. the blade glitter as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nI took up the candlesticks and went before them, steps that I would\r\ngive my hand to recall; but a coward is a slave at the best; and even\r\nas I went, my teeth smote each other in my mouth. It was as he had\r\nsaid: there was no breath stirring; a windless stricture of frost had\r\nbound the air; and as we went forth in the shine of the candles, the\r\nblackness was like a roof over our heads. Never a word was said; there\r\nwas never a sound but the creaking of our steps along the frozen path.\r\nThe cold of the night fell about me like a bucket of water; I shook as\r\nI went with more than terror; but my companions, bare-headed like\r\nmyself, and fresh from the warm ball, appeared not even conscious of\r\nthe change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the place,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cSet down the candles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as he bid me, and presently the flames went up, as steady as in a\r\nchamber, in the midst of the frosted trees, and I beheld these two\r\nbrothers take their places.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe light is something in my eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give you every advantage,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Henry, shifting his\r\nground, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I think you are about to die.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke rather sadly than\r\notherwise, yet there was a ring in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry Durie,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo words before I begin. You are a\r\nfencer, you can hold a foil; you little know what a change it makes to\r\nhold a sword! And by that I know you are to fall. But see how strong is\r\nmy situation! If you fall, I shift out of this country to where my\r\nmoney is before me. If I fall, where are you? My father, your wife\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nis in love with me, as you very well know\xe2\x80\x94your child even, who prefers\r\nme to yourself:\xe2\x80\x94how will these avenge me! Had you thought of that, dear\r\nHenry?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at his brother with a smile; then made a fencing-room\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\nNever a word said Mr. Henry, but saluted too, and the swords rang\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nI am no judge of the play; my head, besides, was gone with cold and\r\nfear and horror; but it seems that Mr. Henry took and kept the upper\r\nhand from the engagement, crowding in upon his foe with a contained and\r\nglowing fury. Nearer and nearer he crept upon the man, till of a sudden\r\nthe Master leaped back with a little sobbing oath; and I believe the\r\nmovement brought the light once more against his eyes. To it they went\r\nagain, on the fresh ground; but now methought closer, Mr. Henry\r\npressing more outrageously, the Master beyond doubt with shaken\r\nconfidence. For it is beyond doubt he now recognised himself for lost,\r\nand had some taste of the cold agony of fear; or he had never attempted\r\nthe foul stroke. I cannot say I followed it, my untrained eye was never\r\nquick enough to seize details, but it appears he caught his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblade with his left hand, a practice not permitted. Certainly Mr. Henry\r\nonly saved himself by leaping on one side; as certainly the Master,\r\nlunging in the air, stumbled on his knee, and before he could move the\r\nsword was through his body.\r\n\r\nI cried out with a stifled scream, and ran in; but the body was already\r\nfallen to the ground, where it writhed a moment like a trodden worm,\r\nand then lay motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at his left hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all bloody,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the inside?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is cut on the inside,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and turned his back.\r\n\r\nI opened the man\xe2\x80\x99s clothes; the heart was quite still, it gave not a\r\nflutter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive us, Mr. Henry!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, a little stupidly; and then with a rising tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead? dead?\xe2\x80\x9d says he, and suddenly cast his bloody sword upon the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat must we do?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cBe yourself, sir. It is too late now: you\r\nmust be yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned and stared at me. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mackellar!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, and put his face\r\nin his hands.\r\n\r\nI plucked him by the coat. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, for all our sakes, be more\r\ncourageous!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat must we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe showed me his face with the same stupid stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo?\xe2\x80\x9d says he. And with that his eye fell on the body, and \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncries out, with his hand to his brow, as if he had never remembered;\r\nand, turning from me, made off towards the house of Durrisdeer at a\r\nstrange stumbling run.\r\n\r\nI stood a moment mused; then it seemed to me my duty lay most plain on\r\nthe side of the living; and I ran after him, leaving the candles on the\r\nfrosty ground and the body lying in their light under the trees. But\r\nrun as I pleased, he had the start of me, and was got into the house,\r\nand up to the hall, where I found him standing before the fire with his\r\nface once more in his hands, and as he so stood he visibly shuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Henry, Mr. Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis will be the ruin of us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this that I have done?\xe2\x80\x9d cries he, and then looking upon me\r\nwith a countenance that I shall never forget, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is to tell the old\r\nman?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe word knocked at my heart; but it was no time for weakness. I went\r\nand poured him out a glass of brandy. \xe2\x80\x9cDrink that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cdrink it\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d I forced him to swallow it like a child; and, being still\r\nperished with the cold of the night, I followed his example.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has to be told, Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be told.\xe2\x80\x9d And he fell\r\nsuddenly in a seat\xe2\x80\x94my old lord\xe2\x80\x99s seat by the chimney-side\xe2\x80\x94and was\r\nshaken with dry sobs.\r\n\r\nDismay came upon my soul; it was plain there was no help in Mr. Henry.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9csit there, and leave all to me.\xe2\x80\x9d And taking a candle\r\nin my hand, I set forth out of the room in the dark house. There was no\r\nmovement; I must suppose that all had gone unobserved; and I was now to\r\nconsider how to smuggle through the rest with the like secrecy. It was\r\nno hour for scruples; and I opened my lady\xe2\x80\x99s door without so much as a\r\nknock, and passed boldly in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some calamity happened,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, sitting up in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI will go forth again into the passage; and do you\r\nget as quickly as you can into your clothes. There is much to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe troubled me with no questions, nor did she keep me waiting. Ere I\r\nhad time to prepare a word of that which I must say to her, she was on\r\nthe threshold signing me to enter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif you cannot be very brave, I must go elsewhere; for\r\nif no one helps me to-night, there is an end of the house of\r\nDurrisdeer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very courageous,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; and she looked at me with a sort of\r\nsmile, very painful to see, but very brave too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has come to a duel,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA duel?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cA duel! Henry and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Master,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cThings have been borne so long, things of\r\nwhich you know nothing, which you would not believe if I should tell.\r\nBut to-night it went too far, and when he insulted you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cHe? Who?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! madam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, my bitterness breaking forth, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you ask me such\r\na question? Indeed, then, I may go elsewhere for help; there is none\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know in what I have offended you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me; put\r\nme out of this suspense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I dared not tell her yet; I felt not sure of her; and at the doubt,\r\nand under the sense of impotence it brought with it, I turned on the\r\npoor woman with something near to anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are speaking of two men: one of them insulted you,\r\nand you ask me which. I will help you to the answer. With one of these\r\nmen you have spent all your hours: has the other reproached you? To one\r\nyou have been always kind; to the other, as God sees me and judges\r\nbetween us two, I think not always: has his love ever failed you?\r\nTo-night one of these two men told the other, in my hearing\xe2\x80\x94the hearing\r\nof a hired stranger,\xe2\x80\x94that you were in love with him. Before I say one\r\nword, you shall answer your own question: Which was it? Nay, madam, you\r\nshall answer me another: If it has come to this dreadful end, whose\r\nfault is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stared at me like one dazzled. \xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d she said once, in a kind\r\nof bursting exclamation; and then a second time in a whisper to\r\nherself: \xe2\x80\x9cGreat God!\xe2\x80\x94In the name of mercy, Mackellar, what is wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI am made up; I can hear all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not fit to hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever it was, you shall say\r\nfirst it was your fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with a gesture of wringing her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cthis man will\r\ndrive me mad! Can you not put me out of your thoughts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not once of you,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI think of none but my dear\r\nunhappy master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with her hand to her heart, \xe2\x80\x9cis Henry dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLower your voice,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw her sway like something stricken by the wind; and I know not\r\nwhether in cowardice or misery, turned aside and looked upon the floor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are dreadful tidings,\xe2\x80\x9d said I at length, when her silence began\r\nto put me in some fear; \xe2\x80\x9cand you and I behove to be the more bold if\r\nthe house is to be saved.\xe2\x80\x9d Still she answered nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is Miss\r\nKatharine, besides,\xe2\x80\x9d I added: \xe2\x80\x9cunless we bring this matter through, her\r\ninheritance is like to be of shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI do not know if it was the thought of her child or the naked word\r\nshame, that gave her deliverance; at least, I had no sooner spoken than\r\na sound passed her lips, the like of it I never heard; it was as though\r\nshe had lain buried under a hill and sought to move that burthen. And\r\nthe next moment she had found a sort of voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a fight,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and she paused upon the\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a fair fight on my dear master\xe2\x80\x99s part,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for the\r\nother, he was slain in the very act of a foul stroke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9chatred of that man glows in my bosom like a burning\r\nfire; ay, even now he is dead. God knows, I would have stopped the\r\nfighting, had I dared. It is my shame I did not. But when I saw him\r\nfall, if I could have spared one thought from pitying of my master, it\r\nhad been to exult in that deliverance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI do not know if she marked; but her next words were, \xe2\x80\x9cMy lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shall be my part,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not speak to him as you have to me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9chave you not some one else to think of? Leave my lord\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one else?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. She looked at me with a countenance illegible.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to turn your back on him?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nStill she looked at me; then her hand went to her heart again. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you for that word!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to him now, where he sits in\r\nthe hall; speak to him\xe2\x80\x94it matters not what you say; give him your hand;\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98I know all;\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94if God gives you grace enough, say, \xe2\x80\x98Forgive me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod strengthen you, and make you merciful,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go to my\r\nhusband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me light you there,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, taking up the candle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will find my way in the dark,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a shudder, and I think\r\nthe shudder was at me.\r\n\r\nSo we separated\xe2\x80\x94she down stairs to where a little light glimmered in\r\nthe hall-door, I along the passage to my lord\xe2\x80\x99s room. It seems hard to\r\nsay why, but I could not burst in on the old man as I could on the\r\nyoung woman; with whatever reluctance, I must knock. But his old\r\nslumbers were light, or perhaps he slept not; and at the first summons\r\nI was bidden enter.\r\n\r\nHe, too, sat up in bed; very aged and bloodless he looked; and whereas\r\nhe had a certain largeness of appearance when dressed for daylight, he\r\nnow seemed frail and little, and his face (the wig being laid aside)\r\nnot bigger than a child\xe2\x80\x99s. This daunted me; nor less, the haggard\r\nsurmise of misfortune in his eye. Yet his voice was even peaceful as he\r\ninquired my errand. I set my candle down upon a chair, leaned on the\r\nbed-foot, and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Durrisdeer,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cit is very well known to you that I am a\r\npartisan in your family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope we are none of us partisans,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThat you love my son\r\nsincerely, I have always been glad to recognise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my lord, we are past the hour of these civilities,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nwe are to save anything out of the fire, we must look the fact in its\r\nbare countenance. A partisan I am; partisans we have all been; it is as\r\na partisan that I am here in the middle of the night to plead before\r\nyou. Hear me; before I go, I will tell you why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would always hear you, Mr. Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand that at any\r\nhour, whether of the day or night, for I would be always sure you had a\r\nreason. You spoke once before to very proper purpose; I have not\r\nforgotten that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here to plead the cause of my master,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI need not tell\r\nyou how he acts. You know how he is placed. You know with what\r\ngenerosity, he has always met your other\xe2\x80\x94met your wishes,\xe2\x80\x9d I corrected\r\nmyself, stumbling at that name of son. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\xe2\x80\x94you must know\xe2\x80\x94what he\r\nhas suffered\xe2\x80\x94what he has suffered about his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mackellar!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my lord, rising in bed like a bearded lion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you would hear me,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you do not know, what\r\nyou should know, one of the things I am here to speak of, is the\r\npersecution he must bear in private. Your back is not turned before one\r\nwhom I dare not name to you falls upon him with the most unfeeling\r\ntaunts; twits him\xe2\x80\x94pardon me, my lord\xe2\x80\x94twits him with your partiality,\r\ncalls him Jacob, calls him clown, pursues him with ungenerous raillery,\r\nnot to be borne by man. And let but one of you appear, instantly he\r\nchanges; and my master must smile and courtesy to the man who has been\r\nfeeding him with insults; I know, for I have shared in some of it, and\r\nI tell you the life is insupportable. All these months it has endured;\r\nit began with the man\xe2\x80\x99s landing; it was by the name of Jacob that my\r\nmaster was greeted the first night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord made a movement as if to throw aside the clothes and rise. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthere be any truth in this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I look like a man lying?\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted, checking him with my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have told me at first,\xe2\x80\x9d he odd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my lord! indeed I should, and you may well hate the face of this\r\nunfaithful servant!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take order,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cat once.\xe2\x80\x9d And again made the movement to\r\nrise.\r\n\r\nAgain I checked him. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not done,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cWould God I had! All\r\nthis my dear, unfortunate patron has endured without help or\r\ncountenance. Your own best word, my lord, was only gratitude. Oh, but\r\nhe was your son, too! He had no other father. He was hated in the\r\ncountry, God knows how unjustly. He had a loveless marriage. He stood\r\non all hands without affection or support\xe2\x80\x94dear, generous, ill-fated,\r\nnoble heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour tears do you much honour and me much shame,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, with a\r\npalsied trembling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you do me some injustice. Henry has been ever\r\ndear to me, very dear. James (I do not deny it, Mr. Mackellar), James\r\nis perhaps dearer; you have not seen my James in quite a favourable\r\nlight; he has suffered under his misfortunes; and we can only remember\r\nhow great and how unmerited these were. And even now his is the more\r\naffectionate nature. But I will not speak of him. All that you say of\r\nHenry is most true; I do not wonder, I know him to be very magnanimous;\r\nyou will say I trade upon the knowledge? It is possible; there are\r\ndangerous virtues: virtues that tempt the encroacher. Mr. Mackellar, I\r\nwill make it up to him; I will take order with all this. I have been\r\nweak; and, what is worse, I have been dull!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must not hear you blame yourself, my lord, with that which I have\r\nyet to tell upon my conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not been weak;\r\nyou have been abused by a devilish dissembler. You saw yourself how he\r\nhad deceived you in the matter of his danger; he has deceived you\r\nthroughout in every step of his career. I wish to pluck him from your\r\nheart; I wish to force your eyes upon your other son; ah, you have a\r\nson there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo sons\xe2\x80\x94I have two sons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made some gesture of despair that struck him; he looked at me with a\r\nchanged face. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is much worse behind?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, his voice dying\r\nas it rose upon the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch worse,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThis night he said these words to Mr. Henry:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have never known a woman who did not prefer me to you, and I think\r\nwho did not continue to prefer me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will hear nothing against my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; and from his\r\nreadiness to stop me in this direction, I conclude his eyes were not so\r\ndull as I had fancied, and he had looked not without anxiety upon the\r\nsiege of Mrs. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not of blaming her,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not that. These words\r\nwere said in my hearing to Mr. Henry; and if you find them not yet\r\nplain enough, these others but a little after: Your wife, who is in\r\nlove with me!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have quarrelled?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must fly to them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, beginning once again to leave his bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, holding forth my hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are dangerous words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill nothing make you understand, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nHis eyes besought me for the truth.\r\n\r\nI flung myself on my knees by the bedside. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthink on him you have left; think of this poor sinner whom you begot,\r\nwhom your wife bore to you, whom we have none of us strengthened as we\r\ncould; think of him, not of yourself; he is the other sufferer\xe2\x80\x94think of\r\nhim! That is the door for sorrow\xe2\x80\x94Christ\xe2\x80\x99s door, God\xe2\x80\x99s door: oh! it\r\nstands open. Think of him, even as he thought of you. \xe2\x80\x98_Who is to tell\r\nthe old man_?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94these were his words. It was for that I came; that is\r\nwhy I am here pleading at your feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me get up,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, thrusting me aside, and was on his feet\r\nbefore myself. His voice shook like a sail in the wind, yet he spoke\r\nwith a good loudness; his face was like the snow, but his eyes were\r\nsteady and dry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is too much speech,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the shrubbery,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. And when I had told him he knotted his old\r\nface in thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. James?\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have left him lying,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cbeside the candles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCandles?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. And with that he ran to the window, opened it, and\r\nlooked abroad. \xe2\x80\x9cIt might be spied from the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere none goes by at such an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d I objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes no matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne might. Hark!\xe2\x80\x9d cries he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the sound of men very guardedly rowing in the bay; and I told\r\nhim so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe freetraders,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cRun at once, Mackellar; put these\r\ncandles out. I will dress in the meanwhile; and when you return we can\r\ndebate on what is wisest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI groped my way downstairs, and out at the door. From quite a far way\r\noff a sheen was visible, making points of brightness in the shrubbery;\r\nin so black a night it might have been remarked for miles; and I blamed\r\nmyself bitterly for my incaution. How much more sharply when I reached\r\nthe place! One of the candlesticks was overthrown, and that taper\r\nquenched. The other burned steadily by itself, and made a broad space\r\nof light upon the frosted ground. All within that circle seemed, by the\r\nforce of contrast and the overhanging blackness, brighter than by day.\r\nAnd there was the bloodstain in the midst; and a little farther off Mr.\r\nHenry\xe2\x80\x99s sword, the pommel of which was of silver; but of the body, not\r\na trace. My heart thumped upon my ribs, the hair stirred upon my scalp,\r\nas I stood there staring\xe2\x80\x94so strange was the sight, so dire the fears it\r\nwakened. I looked right and left; the ground was so hard, it told no\r\nstory. I stood and listened till my ears ached, but the night was\r\nhollow about me like an empty church; not even a ripple stirred upon\r\nthe shore; it seemed you might have heard a pin drop in the county.\r\n\r\nI put the candle out, and the blackness fell about me groping dark; it\r\nwas like a crowd surrounding me; and I went back to the house of\r\nDurrisdeer, with my chin upon my shoulder, startling, as I went, with\r\ncraven suppositions. In the door a figure moved to meet me, and I had\r\nnear screamed with terror ere I recognised Mrs. Henry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you told him?\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was he who sent me,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is gone. But why are you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is gone!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe body,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you not with your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot have looked. Come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no light now,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see in the dark. I have been standing here so long\xe2\x80\x94so long,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, give me your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe returned to the shrubbery hand in hand, and to the fatal place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care of the blood,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlood?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and started violently back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it will be,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI am like a blind man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing! Have you not dreamed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, would to God we had!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I.\r\n\r\nShe spied the sword, picked it up, and seeing the blood, let it fall\r\nagain with her hands thrown wide. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. And then, with an\r\ninstant courage, handled it the second time, and thrust it to the hilt\r\ninto the frozen ground. \xe2\x80\x9cI will take it back and clean it properly,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays she, and again looked about her on all sides. \xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be that\r\nhe was dead?\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no flutter of his heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, and then remembering: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\nare you not with your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no use,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9che will not speak to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot speak to you?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! you have not tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a right to doubt me,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with a gentle dignity.\r\n\r\nAt this, for the first time, I was seized with sorrow for her. \xe2\x80\x9cGod\r\nknows, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cGod knows I am not so hard as I appear; on\r\nthis dreadful night who can veneer his words? But I am a friend to all\r\nwho are not Henry Durie\xe2\x80\x99s enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hard, then, you should hesitate about his wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nI saw all at once, like the rending of a veil, how nobly she had borne\r\nthis unnatural calamity, and how generously my reproaches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must go back and tell this to my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim I cannot face,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find him the least moved of all of us,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I cannot face him,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can return to Mr. Henry; I will see my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we walked back, I bearing the candlesticks, she the sword\xe2\x80\x94a strange\r\nburthen for that woman\xe2\x80\x94she had another thought. \xe2\x80\x9cShould we tell Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet my lord decide,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nMy lord was nearly dressed when I came to his chamber. He heard me with\r\na frown. \xe2\x80\x9cThe freetraders,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cBut whether dead or alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said I, and paused, ashamed of the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know; but you may very well have been in error. Why should they\r\nremove him if not living?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! here is a great door of hope.\r\nIt must be given out that he departed\xe2\x80\x94as he came\xe2\x80\x94without any note of\r\npreparation. We must save all scandal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw he had fallen, like the rest of us, to think mainly of the house.\r\nNow that all the living members of the family were plunged in\r\nirremediable sorrow, it was strange how we turned to that conjoint\r\nabstraction of the family itself, and sought to bolster up the airy\r\nnothing of its reputation: not the Duries only, but the hired steward\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we to tell Mr. Henry?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will see,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going first to visit him; then I go forth\r\nwith you to view the shrubbery and consider.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went downstairs into the hall. Mr. Henry sat by the table with his\r\nhead upon his hand, like a man of stone. His wife stood a little back\r\nfrom him, her hand at her mouth; it was plain she could not move him.\r\nMy old lord walked very steadily to where his son was sitting; he had a\r\nsteady countenance, too, but methought a little cold. When he was come\r\nquite up, he held out both his hands and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a broken, strangled cry, Mr. Henry leaped up and fell on his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s neck, crying and weeping, the most pitiful sight that ever a\r\nman witnessed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! father,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know I loved him; you know\r\nI loved him in the beginning; I could have died for him\xe2\x80\x94you know that!\r\nI would have given my life for him and you. Oh! say you know that. Oh!\r\nsay you can forgive me. O father, father, what have I done\xe2\x80\x94what have I\r\ndone? And we used to be bairns together!\xe2\x80\x9d and wept and sobbed, and\r\nfondled the old man, and clutched him about the neck, with the passion\r\nof a child in terror.\r\n\r\nAnd then he caught sight of his wife (you would have thought for the\r\nfirst time), where she stood weeping to hear him, and in a moment had\r\nfallen at her knees. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd O my lass,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must forgive me,\r\ntoo! Not your husband\xe2\x80\x94I have only been the ruin of your life. But you\r\nknew me when I was a lad; there was no harm in Henry Durie then; he\r\nmeant aye to be a friend to you. It\xe2\x80\x99s him\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the old bairn that\r\nplayed with you\xe2\x80\x94oh, can ye never, never forgive him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThroughout all this my lord was like a cold, kind spectator with his\r\nwits about him. At the first cry, which was indeed enough to call the\r\nhouse about us, he had said to me over his shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cClose the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd now he nodded to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may leave him to his wife now,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cBring a light, Mr.\r\nMackellar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon my going forth again with my lord, I was aware of a strange\r\nphenomenon; for though it was quite dark, and the night not yet old,\r\nmethought I smelt the morning. At the same time there went a tossing\r\nthrough the branches of the evergreens, so that they sounded like a\r\nquiet sea, and the air pulled at times against our faces, and the flame\r\nof the candle shook. We made the more speed, I believe, being\r\nsurrounded by this bustle; visited the scene of the duel, where my lord\r\nlooked upon the blood with stoicism; and passing farther on toward the\r\nlanding-place, came at last upon some evidences of the truth. For,\r\nfirst of all, where there was a pool across the path, the ice had been\r\ntrodden in, plainly by more than one man\xe2\x80\x99s weight; next, and but a\r\nlittle farther, a young tree was broken, and down by the landing-place,\r\nwhere the traders\xe2\x80\x99 boats were usually beached, another stain of blood\r\nmarked where the body must have been infallibly set down to rest the\r\nbearers.\r\n\r\nThis stain we set ourselves to wash away with the sea-water, carrying\r\nit in my lord\xe2\x80\x99s hat; and as we were thus engaged there came up a sudden\r\nmoaning gust and left us instantly benighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will come to snow,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord; \xe2\x80\x9cand the best thing that we could\r\nhope. Let us go back now; we can do nothing in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we went houseward, the wind being again subsided, we were aware of a\r\nstrong pattering noise about us in the night; and when we issued from\r\nthe shelter of the trees, we found it raining smartly.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of this, my lord\xe2\x80\x99s clearness of mind, no less than\r\nhis activity of body, had not ceased to minister to my amazement. He\r\nset the crown upon it in the council we held on our return. The\r\nfreetraders had certainly secured the Master, though whether dead or\r\nalive we were still left to our conjectures; the rain would, long\r\nbefore day, wipe out all marks of the transaction; by this we must\r\nprofit. The Master had unexpectedly come after the fall of night; it\r\nmust now be given out he had as suddenly departed before the break of\r\nday; and, to make all this plausible, it now only remained for me to\r\nmount into the man\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, and pack and conceal his baggage. True,\r\nwe still lay at the discretion of the traders; but that was the\r\nincurable weakness of our guilt.\r\n\r\nI heard him, as I said, with wonder, and hastened to obey. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nHenry were gone from the hall; my lord, for warmth\xe2\x80\x99s sake, hurried to\r\nhis bed; there was still no sign of stir among the servants, and as I\r\nwent up the tower stair, and entered the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s room, a horror of\r\nsolitude weighed upon my mind. To my extreme surprise, it was all in\r\nthe disorder of departure. Of his three portmanteaux, two were already\r\nlocked; the third lay open and near full. At once there flashed upon me\r\nsome suspicion of the truth. The man had been going, after all; he had\r\nbut waited upon Crail, as Crail waited upon the wind; early in the\r\nnight the seamen had perceived the weather changing; the boat had come\r\nto give notice of the change and call the passenger aboard, and the\r\nboat\xe2\x80\x99s crew had stumbled on him dying in his blood. Nay, and there was\r\nmore behind. This pre-arranged departure shed some light upon his\r\ninconceivable insult of the night before; it was a parting shot, hatred\r\nbeing no longer checked by policy. And, for another thing, the nature\r\nof that insult, and the conduct of Mrs. Henry, pointed to one\r\nconclusion, which I have never verified, and can now never verify until\r\nthe great assize\xe2\x80\x94the conclusion that he had at last forgotten himself,\r\nhad gone too far in his advances, and had been rebuffed. It can never\r\nbe verified, as I say; but as I thought of it that morning among his\r\nbaggage, the thought was sweet to me like honey.\r\n\r\nInto the open portmanteau I dipped a little ere I closed it. The most\r\nbeautiful lace and linen, many suits of those fine plain clothes in\r\nwhich he loved to appear; a book or two, and those of the best, C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommentaries,\xe2\x80\x9d a volume of Mr. Hobbes, the \xe2\x80\x9cHenriade\xe2\x80\x9d of M. de\r\nVoltaire, a book upon the Indies, one on the mathematics, far beyond\r\nwhere I have studied: these were what I observed with very mingled\r\nfeelings. But in the open portmanteau, no papers of any description.\r\nThis set me musing. It was possible the man was dead; but, since the\r\ntraders had carried him away, not likely. It was possible he might\r\nstill die of his wound; but it was also possible he might not. And in\r\nthis latter case I was determined to have the means of some defence.\r\n\r\nOne after another I carried his portmanteaux to a loft in the top of\r\nthe house which we kept locked; went to my own room for my keys, and,\r\nreturning to the loft, had the gratification to find two that fitted\r\npretty well. In one of the portmanteaux there was a shagreen\r\nletter-case, which I cut open with my knife; and thenceforth (so far as\r\nany credit went) the man was at my mercy. Here was a vast deal of\r\ngallant correspondence, chiefly of his Paris days; and, what was more\r\nto the purpose, here were the copies of his own reports to the English\r\nSecretary, and the originals of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s answers: a most damning\r\nseries: such as to publish would be to wreck the Master\xe2\x80\x99s honour and to\r\nset a price upon his life. I chuckled to myself as I ran through the\r\ndocuments; I rubbed my hands, I sang aloud in my glee. Day found me at\r\nthe pleasing task; nor did I then remit my diligence, except in so far\r\nas I went to the window\xe2\x80\x94looked out for a moment, to see the frost quite\r\ngone, the world turned black again, and the rain and the wind driving\r\nin the bay\xe2\x80\x94and to assure myself that the lugger was gone from its\r\nanchorage, and the Master (whether dead or alive) now tumbling on the\r\nIrish Sea.\r\n\r\nIt is proper I should add in this place the very little I have\r\nsubsequently angled out upon the doings of that night. It took me a\r\nlong while to gather it; for we dared not openly ask, and the\r\nfreetraders regarded me with enmity, if not with scorn. It was near six\r\nmonths before we even knew for certain that the man survived; and it\r\nwas years before I learned from one of Crail\xe2\x80\x99s men, turned publican on\r\nhis ill-gotten gain, some particulars which smack to me of truth. It\r\nseems the traders found the Master struggled on one elbow, and now\r\nstaring round him, and now gazing at the candle or at his hand which\r\nwas all bloodied, like a man stupid. Upon their coming, he would seem\r\nto have found his mind, bade them carry him aboard, and hold their\r\ntongues; and on the captain asking how he had come in such a pickle,\r\nreplied with a burst of passionate swearing, and incontinently fainted.\r\nThey held some debate, but they were momently looking for a wind, they\r\nwere highly paid to smuggle him to France, and did not care to delay.\r\nBesides which, he was well enough liked by these abominable wretches:\r\nthey supposed him under capital sentence, knew not in what mischief he\r\nmight have got his wound, and judged it a piece of good nature to\r\nremove him out of the way of danger. So he was taken aboard, recovered\r\non the passage over, and was set ashore a convalescent at the Havre de\r\nGrace. What is truly notable: he said not a word to anyone of the duel,\r\nand not a trader knows to this day in what quarrel, or by the hand of\r\nwhat adversary, he fell. With any other man I should have set this down\r\nto natural decency; with him, to pride. He could not bear to avow,\r\nperhaps even to himself, that he had been vanquished by one whom he had\r\nso much insulted whom he so cruelly despised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nSUMMARY OF EVENTS DURING THE MASTER\xe2\x80\x99S SECOND ABSENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the heavy sickness which declared itself next morning I can think\r\nwith equanimity, as of the last unmingled trouble that befell my\r\nmaster; and even that was perhaps a mercy in disguise; for what pains\r\nof the body could equal the miseries of his mind? Mrs. Henry and I had\r\nthe watching by the bed. My old lord called from time to time to take\r\nthe news, but would not usually pass the door. Once, I remember, when\r\nhope was nigh gone, he stepped to the bedside, looked awhile in his\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s face, and turned away with a gesture of the head and hand thrown\r\nup, that remains upon my mind as something tragic; such grief and such\r\na scorn of sublunary things were there expressed. But the most of the\r\ntime Mrs. Henry and I had the room to ourselves, taking turns by night,\r\nand bearing each other company by day, for it was dreary watching. Mr.\r\nHenry, his shaven head bound in a napkin, tossed fro without remission,\r\nbeating the bed with his hands. His tongue never lay; his voice ran\r\ncontinuously like a river, so that my heart was weary with the sound of\r\nit. It was notable, and to me inexpressibly mortifying, that he spoke\r\nall the while on matters of no import: comings and goings, horses\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nhe was ever calling to have saddled, thinking perhaps (the poor soul!)\r\nthat he might ride away from his discomfort\xe2\x80\x94matters of the garden, the\r\nsalmon nets, and (what I particularly raged to hear) continually of his\r\naffairs, cyphering figures and holding disputation with the tenantry.\r\nNever a word of his father or his wife, nor of the Master, save only\r\nfor a day or two, when his mind dwelled entirely in the past, and he\r\nsupposed himself a boy again and upon some innocent child\xe2\x80\x99s play with\r\nhis brother. What made this the more affecting: it appeared the Master\r\nhad then run some peril of his life, for there was a cry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Jamie\r\nwill be drowned\xe2\x80\x94Oh, save Jamie!\xe2\x80\x9d which he came over and over with a\r\ngreat deal of passion.\r\n\r\nThis, I say, was affecting, both to Mrs. Henry and myself; but the\r\nbalance of my master\xe2\x80\x99s wanderings did him little justice. It seemed he\r\nhad set out to justify his brother\xe2\x80\x99s calumnies; as though he was bent\r\nto prove himself a man of a dry nature, immersed in money-getting. Had\r\nI been there alone, I would not have troubled my thumb; but all the\r\nwhile, as I listened, I was estimating the effect on the man\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\r\nand telling myself that he fell lower every day. I was the one person\r\non the surface of the globe that comprehended him, and I was bound\r\nthere should be yet another. Whether he was to die there and his\r\nvirtues perish: or whether he should save his days and come back to\r\nthat inheritance of sorrows, his right memory: I was bound he should be\r\nheartily lamented in the one case, and unaffectedly welcomed in the\r\nother, by the person he loved the most, his wife.\r\n\r\nFinding no occasion of free speech, I bethought me at last of a kind of\r\ndocumentary disclosure; and for some nights, when I was off duty and\r\nshould have been asleep, I gave my time to the preparation of that\r\nwhich I may call my budget. But this I found to be the easiest portion\r\nof my task, and that which remained\xe2\x80\x94namely, the presentation to my\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x94almost more than I had fortitude to overtake. Several days I went\r\nabout with my papers under my arm, spying for some juncture of talk to\r\nserve as introduction. I will not deny but that some offered; only when\r\nthey did my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth; and I think I might\r\nhave been carrying about my packet till this day, had not a fortunate\r\naccident delivered me from all my hesitations. This was at night, when\r\nI was once more leaving the room, the thing not yet done, and myself in\r\ndespair at my own cowardice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you carry about with you, Mr. Mackellar?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\nlast days, I see you always coming in and out with the same armful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI returned upon my steps without a word, laid the papers before her on\r\nthe table, and left her to her reading. Of what that was, I am now to\r\ngive you some idea; and the best will be to reproduce a letter of my\r\nown which came first in the budget and of which (according to an\r\nexcellent habitude) I have preserved the scroll. It will show, too, the\r\nmoderation of my part in these affairs, a thing which some have called\r\nrecklessly in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDurrisdeer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c1757.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonoured Madam,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust I would not step out of my place without occasion; but I see\r\nhow much evil has flowed in the past to all of your noble house from\r\nthat unhappy and secretive fault of reticency, and the papers on which\r\nI venture to call your attention are family papers, and all highly\r\nworthy your acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI append a schedule with some necessary observations,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd am,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonoured Madam,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s obliged, obedient servant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEphraim Mackellar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchedule of Papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA. Scroll of ten letters from Ephraim Mackellar to the Hon. James\r\nDurie, Esq., by courtesy Master of Ballantrae during the latter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresidence in Paris: under dates . . . \xe2\x80\x9d (follow the dates) . . . \xe2\x80\x9cNota:\r\nto be read in connection with B. and C.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cB. Seven original letters from the said Mr of Ballantrae to the said\r\nE. Mackellar, under dates . . . \xe2\x80\x9d (follow the dates.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC. Three original letters from the Mr of Ballantrae to the Hon. Henry\r\nDurie, Esq., under dates . . . \xe2\x80\x9d (follow the dates) . . . \xe2\x80\x9cNota: given\r\nme by Mr. Henry to answer: copies of my answers A 4, A 5, and A 9 of\r\nthese productions. The purport of Mr. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s communications, of which\r\nI can find no scroll, may be gathered from those of his unnatural\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD. A correspondence, original and scroll, extending over a period of\r\nthree years till January of the current year, between the said Mr of\r\nBallantrae and \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94, Under Secretary of State; twenty-seven in all.\r\nNota: found among the Master\xe2\x80\x99s papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWeary as I was with watching and distress of mind, it was impossible\r\nfor me to sleep. All night long I walked in my chamber, revolving what\r\nshould be the issue, and sometimes repenting the temerity of my\r\nimmixture in affairs so private; and with the first peep of the morning\r\nI was at the sick-room door. Mrs. Henry had thrown open the shutters\r\nand even the window, for the temperature was mild. She looked\r\nsteadfastly before her; where was nothing to see, or only the blue of\r\nthe morning creeping among woods. Upon the stir of my entrance she did\r\nnot so much as turn about her face: a circumstance from which I augured\r\nvery ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d I began; and then again, \xe2\x80\x9cMadam;\xe2\x80\x9d but could make no more of\r\nit. Nor yet did Mrs. Henry come to my assistance with a word. In this\r\npass I began gathering up the papers where they lay scattered on the\r\ntable; and the first thing that struck me, their bulk appeared to have\r\ndiminished. Once I ran them through, and twice; but the correspondence\r\nwith the Secretary of State, on which I had reckoned so much against\r\nthe future, was nowhere to be found. I looked in the chimney; amid the\r\nsmouldering embers, black ashes of paper fluttered in the draught; and\r\nat that my timidity vanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, in a voice not fitting for a sick-room,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, madam, what have you done with my papers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have burned them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Henry, turning about. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough, it\r\nis too much, that you and I have seen them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a fine night\xe2\x80\x99s work that you have done!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all to\r\nsave the reputation of a man that ate bread by the shedding of his\r\ncomrades\xe2\x80\x99 blood, as I do by the shedding of ink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo save the reputation of that family in which you are a servant, Mr.\r\nMackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cand for which you have already done so\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a family I will not serve much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I am\r\ndriven desperate. You have stricken the sword out of my hands; you have\r\nleft us all defenceless. I had always these letters I could shake over\r\nhis head; and now\xe2\x80\x94What is to do? We are so falsely situate we dare not\r\nshow the man the door; the country would fly on fire against us; and I\r\nhad this one hold upon him\xe2\x80\x94and now it is gone\xe2\x80\x94now he may come back\r\nto-morrow, and we must all sit down with him to dinner, go for a stroll\r\nwith him on the terrace, or take a hand at cards, of all things, to\r\ndivert his leisure! No, madam! God forgive you, if He can find it in\r\nHis heart; for I cannot find it in mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder to find you so simple, Mr. Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndoes this man value reputation? But he knows how high we prize it; he\r\nknows we would rather die than make these letters public; and do you\r\nsuppose he would not trade upon the knowledge? What you call your\r\nsword, Mr. Mackellar, and which had been one indeed against a man of\r\nany remnant of propriety, would have been but a sword of paper against\r\nhim. He would smile in your face at such a threat. He stands upon his\r\ndegradation, he makes that his strength; it is in vain to struggle with\r\nsuch characters.\xe2\x80\x9d She cried out this last a little desperately, and\r\nthen with more quiet: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Mackellar; I have thought upon this\r\nmatter all night, and there is no way out of it. Papers or no papers,\r\nthe door of this house stands open for him; he is the rightful heir,\r\nforsooth! If we sought to exclude him, all would redound against poor\r\nHenry, and I should see him stoned again upon the streets. Ah! if Henry\r\ndies, it is a different matter! They have broke the entail for their\r\nown good purposes; the estate goes to my daughter; and I shall see who\r\nsets a foot upon it. But if Henry lives, my poor Mr. Mackellar, and\r\nthat man returns, we must suffer: only this time it will be together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the whole I was well pleased with Mrs. Henry\xe2\x80\x99s attitude of mind; nor\r\ncould I even deny there was some cogency in that which she advanced\r\nabout the papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us say no more about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only be sorry I trusted a\r\nlady with the originals, which was an unbusinesslike proceeding at the\r\nbest. As for what I said of leaving the service of the family, it was\r\nspoken with the tongue only; and you may set your mind at rest. I\r\nbelong to Durrisdeer, Mrs. Henry, as if I had been born there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI must do her the justice to say she seemed perfectly relieved; so that\r\nwe began this morning, as we were to continue for so many years, on a\r\nproper ground of mutual indulgence and respect.\r\n\r\nThe same day, which was certainly prededicate to joy, we observed the\r\nfirst signal of recovery in Mr. Henry; and about three of the following\r\nafternoon he found his mind again, recognising me by name with the\r\nstrongest evidences of affection. Mrs. Henry was also in the room, at\r\nthe bedfoot; but it did not appear that he observed her. And indeed\r\n(the fever being gone) he was so weak that he made but the one effort\r\nand sank again into lethargy. The course of his restoration was now\r\nslow but equal; every day his appetite improved; every week we were\r\nable to remark an increase both of strength and flesh; and before the\r\nend of the month he was out of bed and had even begun to be carried in\r\nhis chair upon the terrace.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps at this time that Mrs. Henry and I were the most uneasy\r\nin mind. Apprehension for his days was at an end; and a worse fear\r\nsucceeded. Every day we drew consciously nearer to a day of reckoning;\r\nand the days passed on, and still there was nothing. Mr. Henry bettered\r\nin strength, he held long talks with us on a great diversity of\r\nsubjects, his father came and sat with him and went again; and still\r\nthere was no reference to the late tragedy or to the former troubles\r\nwhich had brought it on. Did he remember, and conceal his dreadful\r\nknowledge? or was the whole blotted from his mind? This was the problem\r\nthat kept us watching and trembling all day when we were in his company\r\nand held us awake at night when we were in our lonely beds. We knew not\r\neven which alternative to hope for, both appearing so unnatural and\r\npointing so directly to an unsound brain. Once this fear offered, I\r\nobserved his conduct with sedulous particularity. Something of the\r\nchild he exhibited: a cheerfulness quite foreign to his previous\r\ncharacter, an interest readily aroused, and then very tenacious, in\r\nsmall matters which he had heretofore despised. When he was stricken\r\ndown, I was his only confidant, and I may say his only friend, and he\r\nwas on terms of division with his wife; upon his recovery, all was\r\nchanged, the past forgotten, the wife first and even single in his\r\nthoughts. He turned to her with all his emotions, like a child to its\r\nmother, and seemed secure of sympathy; called her in all his needs with\r\nsomething of that querulous familiarity that marks a certainty of\r\nindulgence; and I must say, in justice to the woman, he was never\r\ndisappointed. To her, indeed, this changed behaviour was inexpressibly\r\naffecting; and I think she felt it secretly as a reproach; so that I\r\nhave seen her, in early days, escape out of the room that she might\r\nindulge herself in weeping. But to me the change appeared not natural;\r\nand viewing it along with all the rest, I began to wonder, with many\r\nhead-shakings, whether his reason were perfectly erect.\r\n\r\nAs this doubt stretched over many years, endured indeed until my\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s death, and clouded all our subsequent relations, I may well\r\nconsider of it more at large. When he was able to resume some charge of\r\nhis affairs, I had many opportunities to try him with precision. There\r\nwas no lack of understanding, nor yet of authority; but the old\r\ncontinuous interest had quite departed; he grew readily fatigued, and\r\nfell to yawning; and he carried into money relations, where it is\r\ncertainly out of place, a facility that bordered upon slackness. True,\r\nsince we had no longer the exactions of the Master to contend against,\r\nthere was the less occasion to raise strictness into principle or do\r\nbattle for a farthing. True, again, there was nothing excessive in\r\nthese relaxations, or I would have been no party to them. But the whole\r\nthing marked a change, very slight yet very perceptible; and though no\r\nman could say my master had gone at all out of his mind, no man could\r\ndeny that he had drifted from his character. It was the same to the\r\nend, with his manner and appearance. Some of the heat of the fever\r\nlingered in his veins: his movements a little hurried, his speech\r\nnotably more voluble, yet neither truly amiss. His whole mind stood\r\nopen to happy impressions, welcoming these and making much of them; but\r\nthe smallest suggestion of trouble or sorrow he received with visible\r\nimpatience and dismissed again with immediate relief. It was to this\r\ntemper that he owed the felicity of his later days; and yet here it\r\nwas, if anywhere, that you could call the man insane. A great part of\r\nthis life consists in contemplating what we cannot cure; but Mr. Henry,\r\nif he could not dismiss solicitude by an effort of the mind, must\r\ninstantly and at whatever cost annihilate the cause of it; so that he\r\nplayed alternately the ostrich and the bull. It is to this strenuous\r\ncowardice of pain that I have to set down all the unfortunate and\r\nexcessive steps of his subsequent career. Certainly this was the reason\r\nof his beating McManus, the groom, a thing so much out of all his\r\nformer practice, and which awakened so much comment at the time. It is\r\nto this, again, that I must lay the total loss of near upon two hundred\r\npounds, more than the half of which I could have saved if his\r\nimpatience would have suffered me. But he preferred loss or any\r\ndesperate extreme to a continuance of mental suffering.\r\n\r\nAll this has led me far from our immediate trouble: whether he\r\nremembered or had forgotten his late dreadful act; and if he\r\nremembered, in what light he viewed it. The truth burst upon us\r\nsuddenly, and was indeed one of the chief surprises of my life. He had\r\nbeen several times abroad, and was now beginning to walk a little with\r\nan arm, when it chanced I should be left alone with him upon the\r\nterrace. He turned to me with a singular furtive smile, such as\r\nschoolboys use when in fault; and says he, in a private whisper and\r\nwithout the least preface: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you buried him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not make one sound in answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you buried him?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to see his grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI conceived I had best take the bull by the horns. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d said I,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have news to give that will rejoice you exceedingly. In all human\r\nlikelihood, your hands are clear of blood. I reason from certain\r\nindices; and by these it should appear your brother was not dead, but\r\nwas carried in a swound on board the lugger. But now he may be\r\nperfectly recovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat there was in his countenance I could not read. \xe2\x80\x9cJames?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother James,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not raise a hope that may be\r\nfound deceptive, but in my heart I think it very probable he is alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Henry; and suddenly rising from his seat with more\r\nalacrity than he had yet discovered, set one finger on my breast, and\r\ncried at me in a kind of screaming whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cMackellar\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94these were his\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnothing can kill that man. He is not mortal. He is bound upon my\r\nback to all eternity\xe2\x80\x94to all eternity!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, and, sitting down\r\nagain, fell upon a stubborn silence.\r\n\r\nA day or two after, with the same secret smile, and first looking about\r\nas if to be sure we were alone, \xe2\x80\x9cMackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you have\r\nany intelligence, be sure and let me know. We must keep an eye upon\r\nhim, or he will take us when we least expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not show face here again,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes he will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cWherever I am, there will he be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd again he looked all about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not dwell upon this thought, Mr. Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is a very good advice. We will never think of it,\r\nexcept when you have news. And we do not know yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he added; \xe2\x80\x9che may\r\nbe dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe manner of his saying this convinced me thoroughly of what I had\r\nscarce ventured to suspect: that, so far from suffering any penitence\r\nfor the attempt, he did but lament his failure. This was a discovery I\r\nkept to myself, fearing it might do him a prejudice with his wife. But\r\nI might have saved myself the trouble; she had divined it for herself,\r\nand found the sentiment quite natural. Indeed, I could not but say that\r\nthere were three of us, all of the same mind; nor could any news have\r\nreached Durrisdeer more generally welcome than tidings of the Master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to speak of the exception, my old lord. As soon as my\r\nanxiety for my own master began to be relaxed, I was aware of a change\r\nin the old gentleman, his father, that seemed to threaten mortal\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nHis face was pale and swollen; as he sat in the chimney-side with his\r\nLatin, he would drop off sleeping and the book roll in the ashes; some\r\ndays he would drag his foot, others stumble in speaking. The amenity of\r\nhis behaviour appeared more extreme; full of excuses for the least\r\ntrouble, very thoughtful for all; to myself, of a most flattering\r\ncivility. One day, that he had sent for his lawyer and remained a long\r\nwhile private, he met me as he was crossing the hall with painful\r\nfootsteps, and took me kindly by the hand. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave had many occasions to set a proper value on your services; and\r\nto-day, when I re-cast my will, I have taken the freedom to name you\r\nfor one of my executors. I believe you bear love enough to our house to\r\nrender me this service.\xe2\x80\x9d At that very time he passed the greater\r\nportion of his days in slumber, from which it was often difficult to\r\nrouse him; seemed to have lost all count of years, and had several\r\ntimes (particularly on waking) called for his wife and for an old\r\nservant whose very gravestone was now green with moss. If I had been\r\nput to my oath, I must have declared he was incapable of testing; and\r\nyet there was never a will drawn more sensible in every trait, or\r\nshowing a more excellent judgment both of persons and affairs.\r\n\r\nHis dissolution, though it took not very long, proceeded by\r\ninfinitesimal gradations. His faculties decayed together steadily; the\r\npower of his limbs was almost gone, he was extremely deaf, his speech\r\nhad sunk into mere mumblings; and yet to the end he managed to discover\r\nsomething of his former courtesy and kindness, pressing the hand of any\r\nthat helped him, presenting me with one of his Latin books, in which he\r\nhad laboriously traced my name, and in a thousand ways reminding us of\r\nthe greatness of that loss which it might almost be said we had already\r\nsuffered. To the end, the power of articulation returned to him in\r\nflashes; it seemed he had only forgotten the art of speech as a child\r\nforgets his lesson, and at times he would call some part of it to mind.\r\nOn the last night of his life he suddenly broke silence with these\r\nwords from Virgil: \xe2\x80\x9cGnatique pratisque, alma, precor, miserere,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nperfectly uttered, and with a fitting accent. At the sudden clear sound\r\nof it we started from our several occupations; but it was in vain we\r\nturned to him; he sat there silent, and, to all appearance, fatuous. A\r\nlittle later he was had to bed with more difficulty than ever before;\r\nand some time in the night, without any more violence, his spirit fled.\r\n\r\nAt a far later period I chanced to speak of these particulars with a\r\ndoctor of medicine, a man of so high a reputation that I scruple to\r\nadduce his name. By his view of it father and son both suffered from\r\nthe affection: the father from the strain of his unnatural sorrows\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nson perhaps in the excitation of the fever; each had ruptured a vessel\r\non the brain, and there was probably (my doctor added) some\r\npredisposition in the family to accidents of that description. The\r\nfather sank, the son recovered all the externals of a healthy man; but\r\nit is like there was some destruction in those delicate tissues where\r\nthe soul resides and does her earthly business; her heavenly, I would\r\nfain hope, cannot be thus obstructed by material accidents. And yet,\r\nupon a more mature opinion, it matters not one jot; for He who shall\r\npass judgment on the records of our life is the same that formed us in\r\nfrailty.\r\n\r\nThe death of my old lord was the occasion of a fresh surprise to us who\r\nwatched the behaviour of his successor. To any considering mind, the\r\ntwo sons had between them slain their father, and he who took the sword\r\nmight be even said to have slain him with his hand, but no such thought\r\nappeared to trouble my new lord. He was becomingly grave; I could\r\nscarce say sorrowful, or only with a pleasant sorrow; talking of the\r\ndead with a regretful cheerfulness, relating old examples of his\r\ncharacter, smiling at them with a good conscience; and when the day of\r\nthe funeral came round, doing the honours with exact propriety. I could\r\nperceive, besides, that he found a solid gratification in his accession\r\nto the title; the which he was punctilious in exacting.\r\n\r\n And now there came upon the scene a new character, and one that played\r\n his part, too, in the story; I mean the present lord, Alexander, whose\r\n birth (17th July, 1757) filled the cup of my poor master\xe2\x80\x99s happiness.\r\n There was nothing then left him to wish for; nor yet leisure to wish\r\n for it. Indeed, there never was a parent so fond and doting as he\r\n showed himself. He was continually uneasy in his son\xe2\x80\x99s absence. Was\r\n the child abroad? the father would be watching the clouds in case it\r\n rained. Was it night? he would rise out of his bed to observe its\r\n slumbers. His conversation grew even wearyful to strangers, since he\r\n talked of little but his son. In matters relating to the estate, all\r\n was designed with a particular eye to Alexander; and it would be:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\n us put it in hand at once, that the wood may be grown against\r\n Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s majority;\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cThis will fall in again handsomely for\r\n Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d Every day this absorption of the man\xe2\x80\x99s nature\r\n became more observable, with many touching and some very blameworthy\r\n particulars. Soon the child could walk abroad with him, at first on\r\n the terrace, hand in hand, and afterward at large about the policies;\r\n and this grew to be my lord\xe2\x80\x99s chief occupation. The sound of their two\r\n voices (audible a great way off, for they spoke loud) became familiar\r\n in the neighbourhood; and for my part I found it more agreeable than\r\n the sound of birds. It was pretty to see the pair returning, full of\r\n briars, and the father as flushed and sometimes as bemuddied as the\r\n child, for they were equal sharers in all sorts of boyish\r\n entertainment, digging in the beach, damming of streams, and what not;\r\n and I have seen them gaze through a fence at cattle with the same\r\n childish contemplation.\r\n\r\nThe mention of these rambles brings me to a strange scene of which I\r\nwas a witness. There was one walk I never followed myself without\r\nemotion, so often had I gone there upon miserable errands, so much had\r\nthere befallen against the house of Durrisdeer. But the path lay handy\r\nfrom all points beyond the Muckle Ross; and I was driven, although much\r\nagainst my will, to take my use of it perhaps once in the two months.\r\nIt befell when Mr. Alexander was of the age of seven or eight, I had\r\nsome business on the far side in the morning, and entered the\r\nshrubbery, on my homeward way, about nine of a bright forenoon. It was\r\nthat time of year when the woods are all in their spring colours, the\r\nthorns all in flower, and the birds in the high season of their\r\nsinging. In contrast to this merriment, the shrubbery was only the more\r\nsad, and I the more oppressed by its associations. In this situation of\r\nspirit it struck me disagreeably to hear voices a little way in front,\r\nand to recognise the tones of my lord and Mr. Alexander. I pushed\r\nahead, and came presently into their view. They stood together in the\r\nopen space where the duel was, my lord with his hand on his son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder, and speaking with some gravity. At least, as he raised his\r\nhead upon my coming, I thought I could perceive his countenance to\r\nlighten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9chere comes the good Mackellar. I have just been telling\r\nSandie the story of this place, and how there was a man whom the devil\r\ntried to kill, and how near he came to kill the devil instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had thought it strange enough he should bring the child into that\r\nscene; that he should actually be discoursing of his act, passed\r\nmeasure. But the worst was yet to come; for he added, turning to his\r\nson\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou can ask Mackellar; he was here and saw it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true, Mr. Mackellar?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the child. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you really see\r\nthe devil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not heard the tale,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand I am in a press of\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d So far I said a little sourly, fencing with the\r\nembarrassment of the position; and suddenly the bitterness of the past,\r\nand the terror of that scene by candle-light, rushed in upon my mind. I\r\nbethought me that, for a difference of a second\xe2\x80\x99s quickness in parade,\r\nthe child before me might have never seen the day; and the emotion that\r\nalways fluttered round my heart in that dark shrubbery burst forth in\r\nwords. \xe2\x80\x9cBut so much is true,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have met the devil in\r\nthese woods, and seen him foiled here. Blessed be God that we escaped\r\nwith life\xe2\x80\x94blessed be God that one stone yet stands upon another in the\r\nwalls of Durrisdeer! And, oh! Mr. Alexander, if ever you come by this\r\nspot, though it was a hundred years hence, and you came with the gayest\r\nand the highest in the land, I would step aside and remember a bit\r\nprayer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord bowed his head gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cMackellar is always in\r\nthe right. Come, Alexander, take your bonnet off.\xe2\x80\x9d And with that he\r\nuncovered, and held out his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank Thee, and\r\nmy son thanks Thee, for Thy manifold great mercies. Let us have peace\r\nfor a little; defend us from the evil man. Smite him, O Lord, upon the\r\nlying mouth!\xe2\x80\x9d The last broke out of him like a cry; and at that,\r\nwhether remembered anger choked his utterance, or whether he perceived\r\nthis was a singular sort of prayer, at least he suddenly came to a full\r\nstop; and, after a moment, set back his hat upon his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you have forgot a word, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Forgive us our\r\ntrespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. For Thine is\r\nthe kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that is easy saying,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is very easy saying,\r\nMackellar. But for me to forgive!\xe2\x80\x94I think I would cut a very silly\r\nfigure if I had the affectation to pretend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bairn, my lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with some severity, for I thought his\r\nexpressions little fitted for the care of children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, very true,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is dull work for a bairn. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go\r\nnesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI forget if it was the same day, but it was soon after, my lord,\r\nfinding me alone, opened himself a little more on the same head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am now a very happy man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so indeed, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand the sight of it gives me a\r\nlight heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an obligation in happiness\xe2\x80\x94do you not think so?\xe2\x80\x9d says he,\r\nmusingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cand one in sorrow, too. If we are not\r\nhere to try to do the best, in my humble opinion the sooner we are away\r\nthe better for all parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but if you were in my shoes, would you forgive him?\xe2\x80\x9d asks my lord.\r\n\r\nThe suddenness of the attack a little gravelled me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a duty laid upon us strictly,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHut!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are expressions! Do you forgive the man\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94no!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive me, I do not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShake hands upon that!\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord, with a kind of joviality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an ill sentiment to shake hands upon,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Christian\r\npeople. I think I will give you mine on some more evangelical\r\noccasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis I said, smiling a little; but as for my lord, he went from the\r\nroom laughing aloud.\r\n\r\n For my lord\xe2\x80\x99s slavery to the child, I can find no expression adequate.\r\n He lost himself in that continual thought: business, friends, and wife\r\n being all alike forgotten, or only remembered with a painful effort,\r\n like that of one struggling with a posset. It was most notable in the\r\n matter of his wife. Since I had known Durrisdeer, she had been the\r\n burthen of his thought and the loadstone of his eyes; and now she was\r\n quite cast out. I have seen him come to the door of a room, look\r\n round, and pass my lady over as though she were a dog before the fire.\r\n It would be Alexander he was seeking, and my lady knew it well. I have\r\n heard him speak to her so ruggedly that I nearly found it in my heart\r\n to intervene: the cause would still be the same, that she had in some\r\n way thwarted Alexander. Without doubt this was in the nature of a\r\n judgment on my lady. Without doubt she had the tables turned upon her,\r\n as only Providence can do it; she who had been cold so many years to\r\n every mark of tenderness, it was her part now to be neglected: the\r\n more praise to her that she played it well.\r\n\r\nAn odd situation resulted: that we had once more two parties in the\r\nhouse, and that now I was of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s. Not that ever I lost the love I\r\nbore my master. But, for one thing, he had the less use for my society.\r\nFor another, I could not but compare the case of Mr. Alexander with\r\nthat of Miss Katharine; for whom my lord had never found the least\r\nattention. And for a third, I was wounded by the change he discovered\r\nto his wife, which struck me in the nature of an infidelity. I could\r\nnot but admire, besides, the constancy and kindness she displayed.\r\nPerhaps her sentiment to my lord, as it had been founded from the first\r\nin pity, was that rather of a mother than a wife; perhaps it pleased\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94if I may so say\xe2\x80\x94to behold her two children so happy in each other;\r\nthe more as one had suffered so unjustly in the past. But, for all\r\nthat, and though I could never trace in her one spark of jealousy, she\r\nmust fall back for society on poor neglected Miss Katharine; and I, on\r\nmy part, came to pass my spare hours more and more with the mother and\r\ndaughter. It would be easy to make too much of this division, for it\r\nwas a pleasant family, as families go; still the thing existed; whether\r\nmy lord knew it or not, I am in doubt. I do not think he did; he was\r\nbound up so entirely in his son; but the rest of us knew it, and in a\r\nmanner suffered from the knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhat troubled us most, however, was the great and growing danger to the\r\nchild. My lord was his father over again; it was to be feared the son\r\nwould prove a second Master. Time has proved these fears to have been\r\nquite exaggerate. Certainly there is no more worthy gentleman to-day in\r\nScotland than the seventh Lord Durrisdeer. Of my own exodus from his\r\nemployment it does not become me to speak, above all in a memorandum\r\nwritten only to justify his father. . . .\r\n\r\n[_Editor\xe2\x80\x99s Note_. _Five pages of Mr. Mackellar\xe2\x80\x99s MS. are here omitted_.\r\n_I have gathered from their perusal an impression that Mr. Mackellar_,\r\n_in his old age_, _was rather an exacting servant_. _Against the\r\nseventh Lord Durrisdeer_ (_with whom_, _at any rate_, _we have no\r\nconcern_) _nothing material is alleged_.\xe2\x80\x94R. L. S.]\r\n\r\n. . . But our fear at the time was lest he should turn out, in the\r\nperson of his son, a second edition of his brother. My lady had tried\r\nto interject some wholesome discipline; she had been glad to give that\r\nup, and now looked on with secret dismay; sometimes she even spoke of\r\nit by hints; and sometimes, when there was brought to her knowledge\r\nsome monstrous instance of my lord\xe2\x80\x99s indulgence, she would betray\r\nherself in a gesture or perhaps an exclamation. As for myself, I was\r\nhaunted by the thought both day and night: not so much for the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake as for the father\xe2\x80\x99s. The man had gone to sleep, he was dreaming a\r\ndream, and any rough wakening must infallibly prove mortal. That he\r\nshould survive its death was inconceivable; and the fear of its\r\ndishonour made me cover my face.\r\n\r\nIt was this continual preoccupation that screwed me up at last to a\r\nremonstrance: a matter worthy to be narrated in detail. My lord and I\r\nsat one day at the same table upon some tedious business of detail; I\r\nhave said that he had lost his former interest in such occupations; he\r\nwas plainly itching to be gone, and he looked fretful, weary, and\r\nmethought older than I had ever previously observed. I suppose it was\r\nthe haggard face that put me suddenly upon my enterprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with my head down, and feigning to continue my\r\noccupation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cor, rather, let me call you again by the name of Mr. Henry,\r\nfor I fear your anger and want you to think upon old times\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good Mackellar!\xe2\x80\x9d said he; and that in tones so kindly that I had\r\nnear forsook my purpose. But I called to mind that I was speaking for\r\nhis good, and stuck to my colours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas it never come in upon your mind what you are doing?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I am doing?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated; \xe2\x80\x9cI was never good at guessing riddles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you are doing with your son?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with some defiance in his tone, \xe2\x80\x9cand what am I doing\r\nwith my son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father was a very good man,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, straying from the direct\r\npath. \xe2\x80\x9cBut do you think he was a wise father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause before he spoke, and then: \xe2\x80\x9cI say nothing against\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI had the most cause perhaps; but I say nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had the cause at least. And yet your\r\nfather was a good man; I never knew a better, save on the one point,\r\nnor yet a wiser. Where he stumbled, it is highly possible another man\r\nshould fail. He had the two sons\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord rapped suddenly and violently on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, my voice almost strangled with the thumping of\r\nmy heart. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you continue to indulge Mr. Alexander, you are following\r\nin your father\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps. Beware, my lord, lest (when he grows up)\r\nyour son should follow in the Master\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never meant to put the thing so crudely; but in the extreme of\r\nfear, there comes a brutal kind of courage, the most brutal indeed of\r\nall; and I burnt my ships with that plain word. I never had the answer.\r\nWhen I lifted my head, my lord had risen to his feet, and the next\r\nmoment he fell heavily on the floor. The fit or seizure endured not\r\nvery long; he came to himself vacantly, put his hand to his head, which\r\nI was then supporting, and says he, in a broken voice: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nill,\xe2\x80\x9d and a little after: \xe2\x80\x9cHelp me.\xe2\x80\x9d I got him to his feet, and he\r\nstood pretty well, though he kept hold of the table. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been ill,\r\nMackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d he said again. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething broke, Mackellar\xe2\x80\x94or was going to\r\nbreak, and then all swam away. I think I was very angry. Never you\r\nmind, Mackellar; never you mind, my man. I wouldnae hurt a hair upon\r\nyour head. Too much has come and gone. It\xe2\x80\x99s a certain thing between us\r\ntwo. But I think, Mackellar, I will go to Mrs. Henry\xe2\x80\x94I think I will go\r\nto Mrs. Henry,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and got pretty steadily from the room, leaving\r\nme overcome with penitence.\r\n\r\nPresently the door flew open, and my lady swept in with flashing eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is all this?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done to my husband? Will\r\nnothing teach you your position in this house? Will you never cease\r\nfrom making and meddling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9csince I have been in this house I have had plenty\r\nof hard words. For a while they were my daily diet, and I swallowed\r\nthem all. As for to-day, you may call me what you please; you will\r\nnever find the name hard enough for such a blunder. And yet I meant it\r\nfor the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told her all with ingenuity, even as it is written here; and when she\r\nhad heard me out, she pondered, and I could see her animosity fall.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou meant well indeed. I have had the same thought\r\nmyself, or the same temptation rather, which makes me pardon you. But,\r\ndear God, can you not understand that he can bear no more? He can bear\r\nno more!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cord is stretched to snapping. What matters\r\nthe future if he have one or two good days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI will meddle no more. I am pleased enough that you\r\nshould recognise the kindness of my meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when it came to the point, I have to suppose\r\nyour courage failed you; for what you said was said cruelly.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\npaused, looking at me; then suddenly smiled a little, and said a\r\nsingular thing: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what you are, Mr. Mackellar? You are an\r\nold maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n No more incident of any note occurred in the family until the return\r\n of that ill-starred man the Master. But I have to place here a second\r\n extract from the memoirs of Chevalier Burke, interesting in itself,\r\n and highly necessary for my purpose. It is our only sight of the\r\n Master on his Indian travels; and the first word in these pages of\r\n Secundra Dass. One fact, it is to observe, appears here very clearly,\r\n which if we had known some twenty years ago, how many calamities and\r\n sorrows had been spared!\xe2\x80\x94that Secundra Dass spoke English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nADVENTURE OF CHEVALIER BURKE IN INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extracted from his Memoirs_.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . Here was I, therefore, on the streets of that city, the name of\r\nwhich I cannot call to mind, while even then I was so ill-acquainted\r\nwith its situation that I knew not whether to go south or north. The\r\nalert being sudden, I had run forth without shoes or stockings; my hat\r\nhad been struck from my head in the mellay; my kit was in the hands of\r\nthe English; I had no companion but the cipaye, no weapon but my sword,\r\nand the devil a coin in my pocket. In short, I was for all the world\r\nlike one of those calendars with whom Mr. Galland has made us\r\nacquainted in his elegant tales. These gentlemen, you will remember,\r\nwere for ever falling in with extraordinary incidents; and I was myself\r\nupon the brink of one so astonishing that I protest I cannot explain it\r\nto this day.\r\n\r\nThe cipaye was a very honest man; he had served many years with the\r\nFrench colours, and would have let himself be cut to pieces for any of\r\nthe brave countrymen of Mr. Lally. It is the same fellow (his name has\r\nquite escaped me) of whom I have narrated already a surprising instance\r\nof generosity of mind\xe2\x80\x94when he found Mr. de Fessac and myself upon the\r\nramparts, entirely overcome with liquor, and covered us with straw\r\nwhile the commandant was passing by. I consulted him, therefore, with\r\nperfect freedom. It was a fine question what to do; but we decided at\r\nlast to escalade a garden wall, where we could certainly sleep in the\r\nshadow of the trees, and might perhaps find an occasion to get hold of\r\na pair of slippers and a turban. In that part of the city we had only\r\nthe difficulty of the choice, for it was a quarter consisting entirely\r\nof walled gardens, and the lanes which divided them were at that hour\r\nof the night deserted. I gave the cipaye a back, and we had soon\r\ndropped into a large enclosure full of trees. The place was soaking\r\nwith the dew, which, in that country, is exceedingly unwholesome, above\r\nall to whites; yet my fatigue was so extreme that I was already half\r\nasleep, when the cipaye recalled me to my senses. In the far end of the\r\nenclosure a bright light had suddenly shone out, and continued to burn\r\nsteadily among the leaves. It was a circumstance highly unusual in such\r\na place and hour; and, in our situation, it behoved us to proceed with\r\nsome timidity. The cipaye was sent to reconnoitre, and pretty soon\r\nreturned with the intelligence that we had fallen extremely amiss, for\r\nthe house belonged to a white man, who was in all likelihood English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cif there is a white man to be seen, I will have a\r\nlook at him; for, the Lord be praised! there are more sorts than the\r\none!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cipaye led me forward accordingly to a place from which I had a\r\nclear view upon the house. It was surrounded with a wide verandah; a\r\nlamp, very well trimmed, stood upon the floor of it, and on either side\r\nof the lamp there sat a man, cross-legged, after the Oriental manner.\r\nBoth, besides, were bundled up in muslin like two natives; and yet one\r\nof them was not only a white man, but a man very well known to me and\r\nthe reader, being indeed that very Master of Ballantrae of whose\r\ngallantry and genius I have had to speak so often. Word had reached me\r\nthat he was come to the Indies, though we had never met at least, and I\r\nheard little of his occupations. But, sure, I had no sooner recognised\r\nhim, and found myself in the arms of so old a comrade, than I supposed\r\nmy tribulations were quite done. I stepped plainly forth into the light\r\nof the moon, which shone exceeding strong, and hailing Ballantrae by\r\nname, made him in a few words master of my grievous situation. He\r\nturned, started the least thing in the world, looked me fair in the\r\nface while I was speaking, and when I had done addressed himself to his\r\ncompanion in the barbarous native dialect. The second person, who was\r\nof an extraordinary delicate appearance, with legs like walking canes\r\nand fingers like the stalk of a tobacco pipe, [6] now rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sahib,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cunderstands no English language. I understand it\r\nmyself, and I see you make some small mistake\xe2\x80\x94oh! which may happen very\r\noften. But the Sahib would be glad to know how you come in a garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBallantrae!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9chave you the damned impudence to deny me to my\r\nface?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBallantrae never moved a muscle, staring at me like an image in a\r\npagoda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sahib understands no English language,\xe2\x80\x9d says the native, as glib\r\nas before. \xe2\x80\x9cHe be glad to know how you come in a garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the divil fetch him,\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would be glad to know how I come\r\nin a garden, would he? Well, now, my dear man, just have the civility\r\nto tell the Sahib, with my kind love, that we are two soldiers here\r\nwhom he never met and never heard of, but the cipaye is a broth of a\r\nboy, and I am a broth of a boy myself; and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get a full meal\r\nof meat, and a turban, and slippers, and the value of a gold mohur in\r\nsmall change as a matter of convenience, bedad, my friend, I could lay\r\nmy finger on a garden where there is going to be trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey carried their comedy so far as to converse awhile in Hindustanee;\r\nand then says the Hindu, with the same smile, but sighing as if he were\r\ntired of the repetition, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sahib would be glad to know how you come\r\nin a garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the way of it?\xe2\x80\x9d says I, and laying my hand on my sword-hilt I\r\nbade the cipaye draw.\r\n\r\nBallantrae\xe2\x80\x99s Hindu, still smiling, pulled out a pistol from his bosom,\r\nand though Ballantrae himself never moved a muscle I knew him well\r\nenough to be sure he was prepared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sahib thinks you better go away,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Hindu.\r\n\r\nWell, to be plain, it was what I was thinking myself; for the report of\r\na pistol would have been, under Providence, the means of hanging the\r\npair of us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell the Sahib I consider him no gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, and turned away\r\nwith a gesture of contempt.\r\n\r\nI was not gone three steps when the voice of the Hindu called me back.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sahib would be glad to know if you are a dam low Irishman,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nhe; and at the words Ballantrae smiled and bowed very low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sahib say you ask your friend Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Hindu. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nSahib he cry quits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell the Sahib I will give him a cure for the Scots fiddle when next\r\nwe meet,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I.\r\n\r\nThe pair were still smiling as I left.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt some flaws may be picked in my own behaviour; and\r\nwhen a man, however gallant, appeals to posterity with an account of\r\nhis exploits, he must almost certainly expect to share the fate of\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar and Alexander, and to meet with some detractors. But there is one\r\nthing that can never be laid at the door of Francis Burke: he never\r\nturned his back on a friend. . . .\r\n\r\n(Here follows a passage which the Chevalier Burke has been at the pains\r\nto delete before sending me his manuscript. Doubtless it was some very\r\nnatural complaint of what he supposed to be an indiscretion on my part;\r\nthough, indeed, I can call none to mind. Perhaps Mr. Henry was less\r\nguarded; or it is just possible the Master found the means to examine\r\nmy correspondence, and himself read the letter from Troyes: in revenge\r\nfor which this cruel jest was perpetrated on Mr. Burke in his extreme\r\nnecessity. The Master, for all his wickedness, was not without some\r\nnatural affection; I believe he was sincerely attached to Mr. Burke in\r\nthe beginning; but the thought of treachery dried up the springs of his\r\nvery shallow friendship, and his detestable nature appeared naked.\xe2\x80\x94E.\r\nMcK.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTHE ENEMY IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a strange thing that I should be at a stick for a date\xe2\x80\x94the date,\r\nbesides, of an incident that changed the very nature of my life, and\r\nsent us all into foreign lands. But the truth is, I was stricken out of\r\nall my habitudes, and find my journals very ill redd-up, [7] the day\r\nnot indicated sometimes for a week or two together, and the whole\r\nfashion of the thing like that of a man near desperate. It was late in\r\nMarch at least, or early in April, 1764. I had slept heavily, and\r\nwakened with a premonition of some evil to befall. So strong was this\r\nupon my spirit that I hurried downstairs in my shirt and breeches, and\r\nmy hand (I remember) shook upon the rail. It was a cold, sunny morning,\r\nwith a thick white frost; the blackbirds sang exceeding sweet and loud\r\nabout the house of Durrisdeer, and there was a noise of the sea in all\r\nthe chambers. As I came by the doors of the hall, another sound\r\narrested me\xe2\x80\x94of voices talking. I drew nearer, and stood like a man\r\ndreaming. Here was certainly a human voice, and that in my own master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, and yet I knew it not; certainly human speech, and that in my\r\nnative land; and yet, listen as I pleased, I could not catch one\r\nsyllable. An old tale started up in my mind of a fairy wife (or perhaps\r\nonly a wandering stranger), that came to the place of my fathers some\r\ngenerations back, and stayed the matter of a week, talking often in a\r\ntongue that signified nothing to the hearers; and went again, as she\r\nhad come, under cloud of night, leaving not so much as a name behind\r\nher. A little fear I had, but more curiosity; and I opened the\r\nhall-door, and entered.\r\n\r\nThe supper-things still lay upon the table; the shutters were still\r\nclosed, although day peeped in the divisions; and the great room was\r\nlighted only with a single taper and some lurching reverberation of the\r\nfire. Close in the chimney sat two men. The one that was wrapped in a\r\ncloak and wore boots, I knew at once: it was the bird of ill omen back\r\nagain. Of the other, who was set close to the red embers, and made up\r\ninto a bundle like a mummy, I could but see that he was an alien, of a\r\ndarker hue than any man of Europe, very frailly built, with a singular\r\ntall forehead, and a secret eye. Several bundles and a small valise\r\nwere on the floor; and to judge by the smallness of this luggage, and\r\nby the condition of the Master\xe2\x80\x99s boots, grossly patched by some\r\nunscrupulous country cobbler, evil had not prospered.\r\n\r\nHe rose upon my entrance; our eyes crossed; and I know not why it\r\nshould have been, but my courage rose like a lark on a May morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cis this you?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and I was pleased with the unconcern of my\r\nown voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is even myself, worthy Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time you have brought the black dog visibly upon your back,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReferring to Secundra Dass?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me present you. He\r\nis a native gentleman of India.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHum!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI am no great lover either of you or your friends, Mr.\r\nBally. But I will let a little daylight in, and have a look at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd so saying, I undid the shutters of the eastern window.\r\n\r\nBy the light of the morning I could perceive the man was changed.\r\nLater, when we were all together, I was more struck to see how lightly\r\ntime had dealt with him; but the first glance was otherwise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are getting an old man,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nA shade came upon his face. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you could see yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nwould perhaps not dwell upon the topic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHut!\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cold age is nothing to me. I think I have been\r\nalways old; and I am now, I thank God, better known and more respected.\r\nIt is not every one that can say that, Mr. Bally! The lines in your\r\nbrow are calamities; your life begins to close in upon you like a\r\nprison; death will soon be rapping at the door; and I see not from what\r\nsource you are to draw your consolations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Master addressed himself to Secundra Dass in Hindustanee, from\r\nwhich I gathered (I freely confess, with a high degree of pleasure)\r\nthat my remarks annoyed him. All this while, you may be sure, my mind\r\nhad been busy upon other matters, even while I rallied my enemy; and\r\nchiefly as to how I should communicate secretly and quickly with my\r\nlord. To this, in the breathing-space now given me, I turned all the\r\nforces of my mind; when, suddenly shifting my eyes, I was aware of the\r\nman himself standing in the doorway, and, to all appearance, quite\r\ncomposed. He had no sooner met my looks than he stepped across the\r\nthreshold. The Master heard him coming, and advanced upon the other\r\nside; about four feet apart, these brothers came to a full pause, and\r\nstood exchanging steady looks, and then my lord smiled, bowed a little\r\nforward, and turned briskly away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must see to breakfast for these travellers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was plain the Master was a trifle disconcerted; but he assumed the\r\nmore impudence of speech and manner. \xe2\x80\x9cI am as hungry as a hawk,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nhe. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it be something good, Henry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord turned to him with the same hard smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Durrisdeer,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! never in the family,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one in this house renders me my proper title,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nit please you to make an exception, I will leave you to consider what\r\nappearance it will bear to strangers, and whether it may not be\r\ntranslated as an effect of impotent jealousy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could have clapped my hands together with delight: the more so as my\r\nlord left no time for any answer, but, bidding me with a sign to follow\r\nhim, went straight out of the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome quick,\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have to sweep vermin from the house.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nsped through the passages, with so swift a step that I could scarce\r\nkeep up with him, straight to the door of John Paul, the which he\r\nopened without summons and walked in. John was, to all appearance,\r\nsound asleep, but my lord made no pretence of waking him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, speaking as quietly as ever I heard him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nserved my father long, or I would pack you from the house like a dog.\r\nIf in half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time I find you gone, you shall continue to\r\nreceive your wages in Edinburgh. If you linger here or in St.\r\nBride\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94old man, old servant, and altogether\xe2\x80\x94I shall find some very\r\nastonishing way to make you smart for your disloyalty. Up and begone.\r\nThe door you let them in by will serve for your departure. I do not\r\nchoose my son shall see your face again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am rejoiced to find you bear the thing so quietly,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when we\r\nwere forth again by ourselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuietly!\xe2\x80\x9d cries he, and put my hand suddenly against his heart, which\r\nstruck upon his bosom like a sledge.\r\n\r\nAt this revelation I was filled with wonder and fear. There was no\r\nconstitution could bear so violent a strain\xe2\x80\x94his least of all, that was\r\nunhinged already; and I decided in my mind that we must bring this\r\nmonstrous situation to an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be well, I think, if I took word to my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. Indeed,\r\nhe should have gone himself, but I counted\xe2\x80\x94not in vain\xe2\x80\x94on his\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cdo. I will hurry breakfast: we must all appear at the\r\ntable, even Alexander; it must appear we are untroubled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI ran to my lady\xe2\x80\x99s room, and with no preparatory cruelty, disclosed my\r\nnews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mind was long ago made up,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must make our packets\r\nsecretly to-day, and leave secretly to-night. Thank Heaven, we have\r\nanother house! The first ship that sails shall bear us to New York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what of him?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe leave him Durrisdeer,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him work his pleasure upon\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, by your leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cThere shall be a dog at his heels\r\nthat can hold fast. Bed he shall have, and board, and a horse to ride\r\nupon, if he behave himself; but the keys\xe2\x80\x94if you think well of it, my\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x94shall be left in the hands of one Mackellar. There will be good\r\ncare taken; trust him for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you for that thought. All shall be\r\nleft in your hands. If we must go into a savage country, I bequeath it\r\nto you to take our vengeance. Send Macconochie to St. Bride\xe2\x80\x99s, to\r\narrange privately for horses and to call the lawyer. My lord must leave\r\nprocuration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment my lord came to the door, and we opened our plan to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never hear of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9che would think I feared him. I\r\nwill stay in my own house, please God, until I die. There lives not the\r\nman can beard me out of it. Once and for all, here I am, and here I\r\nstay in spite of all the devils in hell.\xe2\x80\x9d I can give no idea of the\r\nvehemency of his words and utterance; but we both stood aghast, and I\r\nin particular, who had been a witness of his former self-restraint.\r\n\r\nMy lady looked at me with an appeal that went to my heart and recalled\r\nme to my wits. I made her a private sign to go, and when my lord and I\r\nwere alone, went up to him where he was racing to and fro in one end of\r\nthe room like a half-lunatic, and set my hand firmly on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to be the plain-dealer once more; if for\r\nthe last time, so much the better, for I am grown weary of the part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing will change me,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid I should refuse to\r\nhear you; but nothing will change me.\xe2\x80\x9d This he said firmly, with no\r\nsignal of the former violence, which already raised my hopes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said I \xe2\x80\x9cI can afford to waste my breath.\xe2\x80\x9d I pointed to a\r\nchair, and he sat down and looked at me. \xe2\x80\x9cI can remember a time when my\r\nlady very much neglected you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never spoke of it while it lasted,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my lord, with a high\r\nflush of colour; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is all changed now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how much?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how much it is all\r\nchanged? The tables are turned, my lord! It is my lady that now courts\r\nyou for a word, a look\xe2\x80\x94ay, and courts you in vain. Do you know with\r\nwhom she passes her days while you are out gallivanting in the\r\npolicies? My lord, she is glad to pass them with a certain dry old\r\ngrieve [8] of the name of Ephraim Mackellar; and I think you may be\r\nable to remember what that means, for I am the more in a mistake or you\r\nwere once driven to the same company yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMackellar!\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord, getting to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cO my God, Mackellar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is neither the name of Mackellar nor the name of God that can\r\nchange the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cand I am telling you the fact. Now for you,\r\nthat suffered so much, to deal out the same suffering to another, is\r\nthat the part of any Christian? But you are so swallowed up in your new\r\nfriend that the old are all forgotten. They are all clean vanished from\r\nyour memory. And yet they stood by you at the darkest; my lady not the\r\nleast. And does my lady ever cross your mind? Does it ever cross your\r\nmind what she went through that night?\xe2\x80\x94or what manner of a wife she has\r\nbeen to you thenceforward?\xe2\x80\x94or in what kind of a position she finds\r\nherself to-day? Never. It is your pride to stay and face him out, and\r\nshe must stay along with you. Oh! my lord\xe2\x80\x99s pride\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the great\r\naffair! And yet she is the woman, and you are a great hulking man! She\r\nis the woman that you swore to protect; and, more betoken, the own\r\nmother of that son of yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are speaking very bitterly, Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, the Lord\r\nknows, I fear you are speaking very true. I have not proved worthy of\r\nmy happiness. Bring my lady back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lady was waiting near at hand to learn the issue. When I brought her\r\nin, my lord took a hand of each of us, and laid them both upon his\r\nbosom. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had two friends in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the comfort\r\never I had, it came from one or other. When you two are in a mind, I\r\nthink I would be an ungrateful dog\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He shut his mouth very hard, and\r\nlooked on us with swimming eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDo what ye like with me,\xe2\x80\x9d says he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9conly don\xe2\x80\x99t think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped again. \xe2\x80\x9cDo what ye please with me: God\r\nknows I love and honour you.\xe2\x80\x9d And dropping our two hands, he turned his\r\nback and went and gazed out of the window. But my lady ran after,\r\ncalling his name, and threw herself upon his neck in a passion of\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\nI went out and shut the door behind me, and stood and thanked God from\r\nthe bottom of my heart.\r\n\r\n At the breakfast board, according to my lord\xe2\x80\x99s design, we were all\r\n met. The Master had by that time plucked off his patched boots and\r\n made a toilet suitable to the hour; Secundra Dass was no longer\r\n bundled up in wrappers, but wore a decent plain black suit, which\r\n misbecame him strangely; and the pair were at the great window,\r\n looking forth, when the family entered. They turned; and the black man\r\n (as they had already named him in the house) bowed almost to his\r\n knees, but the Master was for running forward like one of the family.\r\n My lady stopped him, curtseying low from the far end of the hall, and\r\n keeping her children at her back. My lord was a little in front: so\r\n there were the three cousins of Durrisdeer face to face. The hand of\r\n time was very legible on all; I seemed to read in their changed faces\r\n a _memento mori_; and what affected me still more, it was the wicked\r\n man that bore his years the handsomest. My lady was quite transfigured\r\n into the matron, a becoming woman for the head of a great tableful of\r\n children and dependents. My lord was grown slack in his limbs; he\r\n stooped; he walked with a running motion, as though he had learned\r\n again from Mr. Alexander; his face was drawn; it seemed a trifle\r\n longer than of old; and it wore at times a smile very singularly\r\n mingled, and which (in my eyes) appeared both bitter and pathetic. But\r\n the Master still bore himself erect, although perhaps with effort; his\r\n brow barred about the centre with imperious lines, his mouth set as\r\n for command. He had all the gravity and something of the splendour of\r\n Satan in the \xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost.\xe2\x80\x9d I could not help but see the man with\r\n admiration, and was only surprised that I saw him with so little fear.\r\n\r\nBut indeed (as long as we were at the table) it seemed as if his\r\nauthority were quite vanished and his teeth all drawn. We had known him\r\na magician that controlled the elements; and here he was, transformed\r\ninto an ordinary gentleman, chatting like his neighbours at the\r\nbreakfast-board. For now the father was dead, and my lord and lady\r\nreconciled, in what ear was he to pour his calumnies? It came upon me\r\nin a kind of vision how hugely I had overrated the man\xe2\x80\x99s subtlety. He\r\nhad his malice still; he was false as ever; and, the occasion being\r\ngone that made his strength, he sat there impotent; he was still the\r\nviper, but now spent his venom on a file. Two more thoughts occurred to\r\nme while yet we sat at breakfast: the first, that he was abashed\xe2\x80\x94I had\r\nalmost said, distressed\xe2\x80\x94to find his wickedness quite unavailing; the\r\nsecond, that perhaps my lord was in the right, and we did amiss to fly\r\nfrom our dismasted enemy. But my poor man\xe2\x80\x99s leaping heart came in my\r\nmind, and I remembered it was for his life we played the coward.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over, the Master followed me to my room, and, taking\r\na chair (which I had never offered him), asked me what was to be done\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Bally,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthe house will still be open to you for a\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a time?\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know if I quite take your meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is plain enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cWe keep you for our reputation; as soon\r\nas you shall have publicly disgraced yourself by some of your\r\nmisconduct, we shall pack you forth again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are become an impudent rogue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master, bending his brows\r\nat me dangerously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI learned in a good school,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you must have perceived\r\nyourself that with my old lord\xe2\x80\x99s death your power is quite departed. I\r\ndo not fear you now, Mr. Bally; I think even\xe2\x80\x94God forgive me\xe2\x80\x94that I take\r\na certain pleasure in your company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke out in a burst of laughter, which I clearly saw to be assumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come with empty pockets,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think there will be any money going,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI would\r\nadvise you not to build on that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have something to say on the point,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not a guess what it will be, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you affect confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cI have still one strong\r\nposition\xe2\x80\x94that you people fear a scandal, and I enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Mr. Bally,\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not in the least fear a scandal\r\nagainst you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been studying repartee,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nspeech is very easy, and sometimes very deceptive. I warn you fairly:\r\nyou will find me vitriol in the house. You would do wiser to pay money\r\ndown and see my back.\xe2\x80\x9d And with that he waved his hand to me and left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nA little after, my lord came with the lawyer, Mr. Carlyle; a bottle of\r\nold wine was brought, and we all had a glass before we fell to\r\nbusiness. The necessary deeds were then prepared and executed, and the\r\nScotch estates made over in trust to Mr. Carlyle and myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one point, Mr. Carlyle,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord, when these affairs had\r\nbeen adjusted, \xe2\x80\x9con which I wish that you would do us justice. This\r\nsudden departure coinciding with my brother\xe2\x80\x99s return will be certainly\r\ncommented on. I wish you would discourage any conjunction of the two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will make a point of it, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Carlyle. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mas\xe2\x80\x94 Bally\r\ndoes not, then, accompany you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a point I must approach,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bally remains at\r\nDurrisdeer, under the care of Mr. Mackellar; and I do not mean that he\r\nshall even know our destination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommon report, however\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but, Mr. Carlyle, this is to be a secret quite among ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninterrupted my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cNone but you and Mackellar are to be made\r\nacquainted with my movements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Bally stays here? Quite so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Carlyle. \xe2\x80\x9cThe powers you\r\nleave\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Then he broke off again. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mackellar, we have a rather heavy\r\nweight upon us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bally will have no voice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will have no voice,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord; \xe2\x80\x9cand, I hope, no influence. Mr.\r\nBally is not a good adviser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, has Mr. Bally means?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand him to have nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cI give him table,\r\nfire, and candle in this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in the matter of an allowance? If I am to share the\r\nresponsibility, you will see how highly desirable it is that I should\r\nunderstand your views,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the question of an\r\nallowance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be no allowance,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish Mr. Bally to live\r\nvery private. We have not always been gratified with his behaviour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in the matter of money,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, \xe2\x80\x9che has shown himself an\r\ninfamous bad husband. Glance your eye upon that docket, Mr. Carlyle,\r\nwhere I have brought together the different sums the man has drawn from\r\nthe estate in the last fifteen or twenty years. The total is pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Carlyle made the motion of whistling. \xe2\x80\x9cI had no guess of this,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me once more, my lord, if I appear to push you; but it\r\nis really desirable I should penetrate your intentions. Mr. Mackellar\r\nmight die, when I should find myself alone upon this trust. Would it\r\nnot be rather your lordship\xe2\x80\x99s preference that Mr. Bally\r\nshould\xe2\x80\x94ahem\xe2\x80\x94should leave the country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord looked at Mr. Carlyle. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask that?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gather, my lord, that Mr. Bally is not a comfort to his family,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays the lawyer with a smile.\r\n\r\nMy lord\xe2\x80\x99s face became suddenly knotted. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish he was in hell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nhe, and filled himself a glass of wine, but with a hand so tottering\r\nthat he spilled the half into his bosom. This was the second time that,\r\nin the midst of the most regular and wise behaviour, his animosity had\r\nspirted out. It startled Mr. Carlyle, who observed my lord thenceforth\r\nwith covert curiosity; and to me it restored the certainty that we were\r\nacting for the best in view of my lord\xe2\x80\x99s health and reason.\r\n\r\nExcept for this explosion the interview was very successfully\r\nconducted. No doubt Mr. Carlyle would talk, as lawyers do, little by\r\nlittle. We could thus feel we had laid the foundations of a better\r\nfeeling in the country, and the man\xe2\x80\x99s own misconduct would certainly\r\ncomplete what we had begun. Indeed, before his departure, the lawyer\r\nshowed us there had already gone abroad some glimmerings of the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should perhaps explain to you, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, pausing, with his\r\nhat in his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have not been altogether surprised with your\r\nlordship\xe2\x80\x99s dispositions in the case of Mr. Bally. Something of this\r\nnature oozed out when he was last in Durrisdeer. There was some talk of\r\na woman at St. Bride\xe2\x80\x99s, to whom you had behaved extremely handsome, and\r\nMr. Bally with no small degree of cruelty. There was the entail, again,\r\nwhich was much controverted. In short, there was no want of talk, back\r\nand forward; and some of our wise-acres took up a strong opinion. I\r\nremained in suspense, as became one of my cloth; but Mr. Mackellar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndocket here has finally opened my eyes. I do not think, Mr. Mackellar,\r\nthat you and I will give him that much rope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n The rest of that important day passed prosperously through. It was our\r\n policy to keep the enemy in view, and I took my turn to be his\r\n watchman with the rest. I think his spirits rose as he perceived us to\r\n be so attentive, and I know that mine insensibly declined. What\r\n chiefly daunted me was the man\xe2\x80\x99s singular dexterity to worm himself\r\n into our troubles. You may have felt (after a horse accident) the hand\r\n of a bone-setter artfully divide and interrogate the muscles, and\r\n settle strongly on the injured place? It was so with the Master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n tongue, that was so cunning to question; and his eyes, that were so\r\n quick to observe. I seemed to have said nothing, and yet to have let\r\n all out. Before I knew where I was the man was condoling with me on my\r\n lord\xe2\x80\x99s neglect of my lady and myself, and his hurtful indulgence to\r\n his son. On this last point I perceived him (with panic fear) to\r\n return repeatedly. The boy had displayed a certain shrinking from his\r\n uncle; it was strong in my mind his father had been fool enough to\r\n indoctrinate the same, which was no wise beginning: and when I looked\r\n upon the man before me, still so handsome, so apt a speaker, with so\r\n great a variety of fortunes to relate, I saw he was the very personage\r\n to captivate a boyish fancy. John Paul had left only that morning; it\r\n was not to be supposed he had been altogether dumb upon his favourite\r\n subject: so that here would be Mr. Alexander in the part of Dido, with\r\n a curiosity inflamed to hear; and there would be the Master, like a\r\n diabolical \xc3\x86neas, full of matter the most pleasing in the world to any\r\n youthful ear, such as battles, sea-disasters, flights, the forests of\r\n the West, and (since his later voyage) the ancient cities of the\r\n Indies. How cunningly these baits might be employed, and what an\r\n empire might be so founded, little by little, in the mind of any boy,\r\n stood obviously clear to me. There was no inhibition, so long as the\r\n man was in the house, that would be strong enough to hold these two\r\n apart; for if it be hard to charm serpents, it is no very difficult\r\n thing to cast a glamour on a little chip of manhood not very long in\r\n breeches. I recalled an ancient sailor-man who dwelt in a lone house\r\n beyond the Figgate Whins (I believe, he called it after Portobello),\r\n and how the boys would troop out of Leith on a Saturday, and sit and\r\n listen to his swearing tales, as thick as crows about a carrion: a\r\n thing I often remarked as I went by, a young student, on my own more\r\n meditative holiday diversion. Many of these boys went, no doubt, in\r\n the face of an express command; many feared and even hated the old\r\n brute of whom they made their hero; and I have seen them flee from him\r\n when he was tipsy, and stone him when he was drunk. And yet there they\r\n came each Saturday! How much more easily would a boy like Mr.\r\n Alexander fall under the influence of a high-looking, high-spoken\r\n gentleman-adventurer, who should conceive the fancy to entrap him;\r\n and, the influence gained, how easy to employ it for the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n perversion!\r\n\r\nI doubt if our enemy had named Mr. Alexander three times before I\r\nperceived which way his mind was aiming\xe2\x80\x94all this train of thought and\r\nmemory passed in one pulsation through my own\xe2\x80\x94and you may say I started\r\nback as though an open hole had gaped across a pathway. Mr. Alexander:\r\nthere was the weak point, there was the Eve in our perishable paradise;\r\nand the serpent was already hissing on the trail.\r\n\r\nI promise you, I went the more heartily about the preparations; my last\r\nscruple gone, the danger of delay written before me in huge characters.\r\nFrom that moment forth I seem not to have sat down or breathed. Now I\r\nwould be at my post with the Master and his Indian; now in the garret,\r\nbuckling a valise; now sending forth Macconochie by the side postern\r\nand the wood-path to bear it to the trysting-place; and, again,\r\nsnatching some words of counsel with my lady. This was the _verso_ of\r\nour life in Durrisdeer that day; but on the _recto_ all appeared quite\r\nsettled, as of a family at home in its paternal seat; and what\r\nperturbation may have been observable, the Master would set down to the\r\nblow of his unlooked-for coming, and the fear he was accustomed to\r\ninspire.\r\n\r\nSupper went creditably off, cold salutations passed and the company\r\ntrooped to their respective chambers. I attended the Master to the\r\nlast. We had put him next door to his Indian, in the north wing;\r\nbecause that was the most distant and could be severed from the body of\r\nthe house with doors. I saw he was a kind friend or a good master\r\n(whichever it was) to his Secundra Dass\xe2\x80\x94seeing to his comfort; mending\r\nthe fire with his own hand, for the Indian complained of cold;\r\ninquiring as to the rice on which the stranger made his diet; talking\r\nwith him pleasantly in the Hindustanee, while I stood by, my candle in\r\nmy hand, and affected to be overcome with slumber. At length the Master\r\nobserved my signals of distress. \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have\r\nall your ancient habits: early to bed and early to rise. Yawn yourself\r\naway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce in my own room, I made the customary motions of undressing, so\r\nthat I might time myself; and when the cycle was complete, set my\r\ntinder-box ready, and blew out my taper. The matter of an hour\r\nafterward I made a light again, put on my shoes of list that I had worn\r\nby my lord\xe2\x80\x99s sick-bed, and set forth into the house to call the\r\nvoyagers. All were dressed and waiting\xe2\x80\x94my lord, my lady, Miss\r\nKatharine, Mr. Alexander, my lady\xe2\x80\x99s woman Christie; and I observed the\r\neffect of secrecy even upon quite innocent persons, that one after\r\nanother showed in the chink of the door a face as white as paper. We\r\nslipped out of the side postern into a night of darkness, scarce broken\r\nby a star or two; so that at first we groped and stumbled and fell\r\namong the bushes. A few hundred yards up the wood-path Macconochie was\r\nwaiting us with a great lantern; so the rest of the way we went easy\r\nenough, but still in a kind of guilty silence. A little beyond the\r\nabbey the path debauched on the main road and some quarter of a mile\r\nfarther, at the place called Eagles, where the moors begin, we saw the\r\nlights of the two carriages stand shining by the wayside. Scarce a word\r\nor two was uttered at our parting, and these regarded business: a\r\nsilent grasping of hands, a turning of faces aside, and the thing was\r\nover; the horses broke into a trot, the lamplight sped like\r\nWill-o\xe2\x80\x99-the-Wisp upon the broken moorland, it dipped beyond Stony Brae;\r\nand there were Macconochie and I alone with our lantern on the road.\r\nThere was one thing more to wait for, and that was the reappearance of\r\nthe coach upon Cartmore. It seems they must have pulled up upon the\r\nsummit, looked back for a last time, and seen our lantern not yet moved\r\naway from the place of separation. For a lamp was taken from a\r\ncarriage, and waved three times up and down by way of a farewell. And\r\nthen they were gone indeed, having looked their last on the kind roof\r\nof Durrisdeer, their faces toward a barbarous country. I never knew\r\nbefore, the greatness of that vault of night in which we two poor\r\nserving-men\xe2\x80\x94the one old, and the one elderly\xe2\x80\x94stood for the first time\r\ndeserted; I had never felt before my own dependency upon the\r\ncountenance of others. The sense of isolation burned in my bowels like\r\na fire. It seemed that we who remained at home were the true exiles,\r\nand that Durrisdeer and Solwayside, and all that made my country\r\nnative, its air good to me, and its language welcome, had gone forth\r\nand was far over the sea with my old masters.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of that night I paced to and fro on the smooth highway,\r\nreflecting on the future and the past. My thoughts, which at first\r\ndwelled tenderly on those who were just gone, took a more manly temper\r\nas I considered what remained for me to do. Day came upon the inland\r\nmountain-tops, and the fowls began to cry, and the smoke of homesteads\r\nto arise in the brown bosom of the moors, before I turned my face\r\nhomeward, and went down the path to where the roof of Durrisdeer shone\r\nin the morning by the sea.\r\n\r\n At the customary hour I had the Master called, and awaited his coming\r\n in the hall with a quiet mind. He looked about him at the empty room\r\n and the three covers set.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are a small party,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow comes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the party to which we must grow accustomed,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with a sudden sharpness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is all this?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and I and your friend Mr. Dass are now all the company,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, my lady, and the children, are gone upon a voyage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cCan this be possible? I have indeed fluttered\r\nyour Volscians in Corioli! But this is no reason why our breakfast\r\nshould go cold. Sit down, Mr. Mackellar, if you please\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94taking, as he\r\nspoke, the head of the table, which I had designed to occupy\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand as we eat, you can give me the details of this evasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could see he was more affected than his language carried, and I\r\ndetermined to equal him in coolness. \xe2\x80\x9cI was about to ask you to take\r\nthe head of the table,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cfor though I am now thrust into the\r\nposition of your host, I could never forget that you were, after all, a\r\nmember of the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a while he played the part of entertainer, giving directions to\r\nMacconochie, who received them with an evil grace, and attending\r\nspecially upon Secundra. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where has my good family withdrawn to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Mr. Bally, that is another point,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no orders to\r\ncommunicate their destination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me,\xe2\x80\x9d he corrected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo any one,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the less pointed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the master; \xe2\x80\x9c_c\xe2\x80\x99est de bon ton_: my\r\nbrother improves as he continues. And I, dear Mr. Mackellar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have bed and board, Mr. Bally,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI am permitted to\r\ngive you the run of the cellar, which is pretty reasonably stocked. You\r\nhave only to keep well with me, which is no very difficult matter, and\r\nyou shall want neither for wine nor a saddle-horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made an excuse to send Macconochie from the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for money?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I to keep well with my good friend\r\nMackellar for my pocket-money also? This is a pleasing return to the\r\nprinciples of boyhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no allowance made,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will take it on myself to\r\nsee you are supplied in moderation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn moderation?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will take it on yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ndrew himself up, and looked about the hall at the dark rows of\r\nportraits. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of my ancestors, I thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d says he; and\r\nthen, with a return to irony, \xe2\x80\x9cBut there must certainly be an allowance\r\nfor Secundra Dass?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt in not possible they have omitted\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will make a note of it, and ask instructions when I write,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nAnd he, with a sudden change of manner, and leaning forward with an\r\nelbow on the table\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think this entirely wise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI execute my orders, Mr. Bally,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProfoundly modest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps not equally ingenuous.\r\nYou told me yesterday my power was fallen with my father\xe2\x80\x99s death. How\r\ncomes it, then, that a peer of the realm flees under cloud of night out\r\nof a house in which his fathers have stood several sieges? that he\r\nconceals his address, which must be a matter of concern to his Gracious\r\nMajesty and to the whole republic? and that he should leave me in\r\npossession, and under the paternal charge of his invaluable Mackellar?\r\nThis smacks to me of a very considerable and genuine apprehension.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sought to interrupt him with some not very truthful denegation; but\r\nhe waved me down, and pursued his speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, it smacks of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will go beyond that, for I\r\nthink the apprehension grounded. I came to this house with some\r\nreluctancy. In view of the manner of my last departure, nothing but\r\nnecessity could have induced me to return. Money, however, is that\r\nwhich I must have. You will not give with a good grace; well, I have\r\nthe power to force it from you. Inside of a week, without leaving\r\nDurrisdeer, I will find out where these fools are fled to. I will\r\nfollow; and when I have run my quarry down, I will drive a wedge into\r\nthat family that shall once more burst it into shivers. I shall see\r\nthen whether my Lord Durrisdeer\xe2\x80\x9d (said with indescribable scorn and\r\nrage) \xe2\x80\x9cwill choose to buy my absence; and you will all see whether, by\r\nthat time, I decide for profit or revenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was amazed to hear the man so open. The truth is, he was consumed\r\nwith anger at my lord\xe2\x80\x99s successful flight, felt himself to figure as a\r\ndupe, and was in no humour to weigh language.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you consider _this_ entirely wise?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, copying his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese twenty years I have lived by my poor wisdom,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered with a\r\nsmile that seemed almost foolish in its vanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd come out a beggar in the end,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif beggar be a strong\r\nenough word for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have you to observe, Mr. Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, with a sudden\r\nimperious heat, in which I could not but admire him, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am\r\nscrupulously civil: copy me in that, and we shall be the better\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThroughout this dialogue I had been incommoded by the observation of\r\nSecundra Dass. Not one of us, since the first word, had made a feint of\r\neating: our eyes were in each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces\xe2\x80\x94you might say, in each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s bosoms; and those of the Indian troubled me with a certain\r\nchanging brightness, as of comprehension. But I brushed the fancy\r\naside, telling myself once more he understood no English; only, from\r\nthe gravity of both voices, and the occasional scorn and anger in the\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s, smelled out there was something of import in the wind.\r\n\r\n For the matter of three weeks we continued to live together in the\r\n house of Durrisdeer: the beginning of that most singular chapter of my\r\n life\xe2\x80\x94what I must call my intimacy with the Master. At first he was\r\n somewhat changeable in his behaviour: now civil, now returning to his\r\n old manner of flouting me to my face; and in both I met him half-way.\r\n Thanks be to Providence, I had now no measure to keep with the man;\r\n and I was never afraid of black brows, only of naked swords. So that I\r\n found a certain entertainment in these bouts of incivility, and was\r\n not always ill-inspired in my rejoinders. At last (it was at supper) I\r\n had a droll expression that entirely vanquished him. He laughed again\r\n and again; and \xe2\x80\x9cWho would have guessed,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this old wife\r\n had any wit under his petticoats?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no wit, Mr. Bally,\xe2\x80\x9d said I: \xe2\x80\x9ca dry Scot\xe2\x80\x99s humour, and something\r\nof the driest.\xe2\x80\x9d And, indeed, I never had the least pretension to be\r\nthought a wit.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour he was never rude with me, but all passed between us in\r\na manner of pleasantry. One of our chief times of daffing [9] was when\r\nhe required a horse, another bottle, or some money. He would approach\r\nme then after the manner of a schoolboy, and I would carry it on by way\r\nof being his father: on both sides, with an infinity of mirth. I could\r\nnot but perceive that he thought more of me, which tickled that poor\r\npart of mankind, the vanity. He dropped, besides (I must suppose\r\nunconsciously), into a manner that was not only familiar, but even\r\nfriendly; and this, on the part of one who had so long detested me, I\r\nfound the more insidious. He went little abroad; sometimes even\r\nrefusing invitations. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do I care for these\r\nthick-headed bonnet-lairds? I will stay at home, Mackellar; and we\r\nshall share a bottle quietly, and have one of our good talks.\xe2\x80\x9d And,\r\nindeed, meal-time at Durrisdeer must have been a delight to any one, by\r\nreason of the brilliancy of the discourse. He would often express\r\nwonder at his former indifference to my society. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwould add, \xe2\x80\x9cwe were upon opposite sides. And so we are to-day; but let\r\nus never speak of that. I would think much less of you if you were not\r\nstaunch to your employer.\xe2\x80\x9d You are to consider he seemed to me quite\r\nimpotent for any evil; and how it is a most engaging form of flattery\r\nwhen (after many years) tardy justice is done to a man\xe2\x80\x99s character and\r\nparts. But I have no thought to excuse myself. I was to blame; I let\r\nhim cajole me, and, in short, I think the watch-dog was going sound\r\nasleep, when he was suddenly aroused.\r\n\r\nI should say the Indian was continually travelling to and fro in the\r\nhouse. He never spoke, save in his own dialect and with the Master;\r\nwalked without sound; and was always turning up where you would least\r\nexpect him, fallen into a deep abstraction, from which he would start\r\n(upon your coming) to mock you with one of his grovelling obeisances.\r\nHe seemed so quiet, so frail, and so wrapped in his own fancies, that I\r\ncame to pass him over without much regard, or even to pity him for a\r\nharmless exile from his country. And yet without doubt the creature was\r\nstill eavesdropping; and without doubt it was through his stealth and\r\nmy security that our secret reached the Master.\r\n\r\nIt was one very wild night, after supper, and when we had been making\r\nmore than usually merry, that the blow fell on me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very fine,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we should do better to\r\nbe buckling our valise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you leaving?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all leaving to-morrow in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the port\r\nof Glascow first, thence for the province of New York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI suppose I must have groaned aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI boasted; I said a week, and it has taken me\r\nnear twenty days. But never mind; I shall make it up; I will go the\r\nfaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you the money for this voyage?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear and ingenuous personage, I have,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cBlame me, if you\r\nchoose, for my duplicity; but while I have been wringing shillings from\r\nmy daddy, I had a stock of my own put by against a rainy day. You will\r\npay for your own passage, if you choose to accompany us on our flank\r\nmarch; I have enough for Secundra and myself, but not more\xe2\x80\x94enough to be\r\ndangerous, not enough to be generous. There is, however, an outside\r\nseat upon the chaise which I will let you have upon a moderate\r\ncommutation; so that the whole menagerie can go together\xe2\x80\x94the house-dog,\r\nthe monkey, and the tiger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI count upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen me foiled; I mean\r\nyou shall see me victorious. To gain that I will risk wetting you like\r\na sop in this wild weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at least,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know very well you could not throw me\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot easily,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou put your finger on the point with your\r\nusual excellent good sense. I never fight with the inevitable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it is useless to appeal to you?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, perfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, if you would give me time, I could write\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what would be my Lord Durrisdeer\xe2\x80\x99s answer?\xe2\x80\x9d asks he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the rub.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, at any rate, how much more expeditious that I should go myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays he. \xe2\x80\x9cBut all this is quite a waste of breath. At seven to-morrow\r\nthe chaise will be at the door. For I start from the door, Mackellar; I\r\ndo not skulk through woods and take my chaise upon the wayside\xe2\x80\x94shall we\r\nsay, at Eagles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mind was now thoroughly made up. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you spare me quarter of an\r\nhour at St. Bride\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a little necessary business with\r\nCarlyle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hour, if you prefer,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not seek to deny that the\r\nmoney for your seat is an object to me; and you could always get the\r\nfirst to Glascow with saddle-horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought to leave old Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will brisken you up,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will be an ill journey for some one,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think, sir, for\r\nyou. Something speaks in my bosom; and so much it says plain\xe2\x80\x94that this\r\nis an ill-omened journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you take to prophecy,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9clisten to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere came up a violent squall off the open Solway, and the rain was\r\ndashed on the great windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo ye ken what that bodes, warlock?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a broad accent: \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be a man Mackellar unco\xe2\x80\x99 sick at sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I got to my chamber, I sat there under a painful excitation,\r\nhearkening to the turmoil of the gale, which struck full upon that\r\ngable of the house. What with the pressure on my spirits, the eldritch\r\ncries of the wind among the turret-tops, and the perpetual trepidation\r\nof the masoned house, sleep fled my eyelids utterly. I sat by my taper,\r\nlooking on the black panes of the window, where the storm appeared\r\ncontinually on the point of bursting in its entrance; and upon that\r\nempty field I beheld a perspective of consequences that made the hair\r\nto rise upon my scalp. The child corrupted, the home broken up, my\r\nmaster dead or worse than dead, my mistress plunged in desolation\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthese I saw before me painted brightly on the darkness; and the outcry\r\nof the wind appeared to mock at my inaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nMR. MACKELLAR\xe2\x80\x99S JOURNEY WITH THE MASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chaise came to the door in a strong drenching mist. We took our\r\nleave in silence: the house of Durrisdeer standing with dropping\r\ngutters and windows closed, like a place dedicate to melancholy. I\r\nobserved the Master kept his head out, looking back on these splashed\r\nwalls and glimmering roofs, till they were suddenly swallowed in the\r\nmist; and I must suppose some natural sadness fell upon the man at this\r\ndeparture; or was it some provision of the end? At least, upon our\r\nmounting the long brae from Durrisdeer, as we walked side by side in\r\nthe wet, he began first to whistle and then to sing the saddest of our\r\ncountry tunes, which sets folk weeping in a tavern, _Wandering Willie_.\r\nThe set of words he used with it I have not heard elsewhere, and could\r\nnever come by any copy; but some of them which were the most\r\nappropriate to our departure linger in my memory. One verse began\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHome was home then, my dear, full of kindly faces,\r\nHome was home then, my dear, happy for the child.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd ended somewhat thus\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNow, when day dawns on the brow of the moorland,\r\n    Lone stands the house, and the chimney-stone is cold.\r\nLone let it stand, now the folks are all departed,\r\n    The kind hearts, the true hearts, that loved the place of old.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could never be a judge of the merit of these verses; they were so\r\nhallowed by the melancholy of the air, and were sung (or rather\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csoothed\xe2\x80\x9d) to me by a master-singer at a time so fitting. He looked in\r\nmy face when he had done, and saw that my eyes watered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think I have never a regret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think you could be so bad a man,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif you had not all\r\nthe machinery to be a good one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not all,\xe2\x80\x9d says he: \xe2\x80\x9cnot all. You are there in error. The malady of\r\nnot wanting, my evangelist.\xe2\x80\x9d But methought he sighed as he mounted\r\nagain into the chaise.\r\n\r\nAll day long we journeyed in the same miserable weather: the mist\r\nbesetting us closely, the heavens incessantly weeping on my head. The\r\nroad lay over moorish hills, where was no sound but the crying of\r\nmoor-fowl in the wet heather and the pouring of the swollen burns.\r\nSometimes I would doze off in slumber, when I would find myself plunged\r\nat once in some foul and ominous nightmare, from the which I would\r\nawake strangling. Sometimes, if the way was steep and the wheels\r\nturning slowly, I would overhear the voices from within, talking in\r\nthat tropical tongue which was to me as inarticulate as the piping of\r\nthe fowls. Sometimes, at a longer ascent, the Master would set foot to\r\nground and walk by my side, mostly without speech. And all the time,\r\nsleeping or waking, I beheld the same black perspective of approaching\r\nruin; and the same pictures rose in my view, only they were now painted\r\nupon hillside mist. One, I remember, stood before me with the colours\r\nof a true illusion. It showed me my lord seated at a table in a small\r\nroom; his head, which was at first buried in his hands, he slowly\r\nraised, and turned upon me a countenance from which hope had fled. I\r\nsaw it first on the black window-panes, my last night in Durrisdeer; it\r\nhaunted and returned upon me half the voyage through; and yet it was no\r\neffect of lunacy, for I have come to a ripe old age with no decay of my\r\nintelligence; nor yet (as I was then tempted to suppose) a heaven-sent\r\nwarning of the future, for all manner of calamities befell, not that\r\ncalamity\xe2\x80\x94and I saw many pitiful sights, but never that one.\r\n\r\nIt was decided we should travel on all night; and it was singular, once\r\nthe dusk had fallen, my spirits somewhat rose. The bright lamps,\r\nshining forth into the mist and on the smoking horses and the hodding\r\npost-boy, gave me perhaps an outlook intrinsically more cheerful than\r\nwhat day had shown; or perhaps my mind had become wearied of its\r\nmelancholy. At least, I spent some waking hours, not without\r\nsatisfaction in my thoughts, although wet and weary in my body; and\r\nfell at last into a natural slumber without dreams. Yet I must have\r\nbeen at work even in the deepest of my sleep; and at work with at least\r\na measure of intelligence. For I started broad awake, in the very act\r\nof crying out to myself\r\n\r\nHome was home then, my dear, happy for the child,\r\n\r\n\r\nstricken to find in it an appropriateness, which I had not yesterday\r\nobserved, to the Master\xe2\x80\x99s detestable purpose in the present journey.\r\n\r\nWe were then close upon the city of Glascow, where we were soon\r\nbreakfasting together at an inn, and where (as the devil would have it)\r\nwe found a ship in the very article of sailing. We took our places in\r\nthe cabin; and, two days after, carried our effects on board. Her name\r\nwas the _Nonesuch_, a very ancient ship and very happily named. By all\r\naccounts this should be her last voyage; people shook their heads upon\r\nthe quays, and I had several warnings offered me by strangers in the\r\nstreet to the effect that she was rotten as a cheese, too deeply\r\nloaden, and must infallibly founder if we met a gale. From this it fell\r\nout we were the only passengers; the Captain, McMurtrie, was a silent,\r\nabsorbed man, with the Glascow or Gaelic accent; the mates ignorant\r\nrough seafarers, come in through the hawsehole; and the Master and I\r\nwere cast upon each other\xe2\x80\x99s company.\r\n\r\n_The Nonesuch_ carried a fair wind out of the Clyde, and for near upon\r\na week we enjoyed bright weather and a sense of progress. I found\r\nmyself (to my wonder) a born seaman, in so far at least as I was never\r\nsick; yet I was far from tasting the usual serenity of my health.\r\nWhether it was the motion of the ship on the billows, the confinement,\r\nthe salted food, or all of these together, I suffered from a blackness\r\nof spirit and a painful strain upon my temper. The nature of my errand\r\non that ship perhaps contributed; I think it did no more; the malady\r\n(whatever it was) sprang from my environment; and if the ship were not\r\nto blame, then it was the Master. Hatred and fear are ill bedfellows;\r\nbut (to my shame be it spoken) I have tasted those in other places,\r\nlain down and got up with them, and eaten and drunk with them, and yet\r\nnever before, nor after, have I been so poisoned through and through,\r\nin soul and body, as I was on board the _Nonesuch_. I freely confess my\r\nenemy set me a fair example of forbearance; in our worst days displayed\r\nthe most patient geniality, holding me in conversation as long as I\r\nwould suffer, and when I had rebuffed his civility, stretching himself\r\non deck to read. The book he had on board with him was Mr. Richardson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamous _Clarissa_! and among other small attentions he would read me\r\npassages aloud; nor could any elocutionist have given with greater\r\npotency the pathetic portions of that work. I would retort upon him\r\nwith passages out of the Bible, which was all my library\xe2\x80\x94and very fresh\r\nto me, my religious duties (I grieve to say it) being always and even\r\nto this day extremely neglected. He tasted the merits of the word like\r\nthe connoisseur he was; and would sometimes take it from my hand, turn\r\nthe leaves over like a man that knew his way, and give me, with his\r\nfine declamation, a Roland for my Oliver. But it was singular how\r\nlittle he applied his reading to himself; it passed high above his head\r\nlike summer thunder: Lovelace and Clarissa, the tales of David\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngenerosity, the psalms of his penitence, the solemn questions of the\r\nbook of Job, the touching poetry of Isaiah\xe2\x80\x94they were to him a source of\r\nentertainment only, like the scraping of a fiddle in a change-house.\r\nThis outer sensibility and inner toughness set me against him; it\r\nseemed of a piece with that impudent grossness which I knew to underlie\r\nthe veneer of his fine manners; and sometimes my gorge rose against him\r\nas though he were deformed\xe2\x80\x94and sometimes I would draw away as though\r\nfrom something partly spectral. I had moments when I thought of him as\r\nof a man of pasteboard\xe2\x80\x94as though, if one should strike smartly through\r\nthe buckram of his countenance, there would be found a mere vacuity\r\nwithin. This horror (not merely fanciful, I think) vastly increased my\r\ndetestation of his neighbourhood; I began to feel something shiver\r\nwithin me on his drawing near; I had at times a longing to cry out;\r\nthere were days when I thought I could have struck him. This frame of\r\nmind was doubtless helped by shame, because I had dropped during our\r\nlast days at Durrisdeer into a certain toleration of the man; and if\r\nany one had then told me I should drop into it again, I must have\r\nlaughed in his face. It is possible he remained unconscious of this\r\nextreme fever of my resentment; yet I think he was too quick; and\r\nrather that he had fallen, in a long life of idleness, into a positive\r\nneed of company, which obliged him to confront and tolerate my\r\nunconcealed aversion. Certain, at least, that he loved the note of his\r\nown tongue, as, indeed, he entirely loved all the parts and properties\r\nof himself; a sort of imbecility which almost necessarily attends on\r\nwickedness. I have seen him driven, when I proved recalcitrant, to long\r\ndiscourses with the skipper; and this, although the man plainly\r\ntestified his weariness, fiddling miserably with both hand and foot,\r\nand replying only with a grunt.\r\n\r\nAfter the first week out we fell in with foul winds and heavy weather.\r\nThe sea was high. The _Nonesuch_, being an old-fashioned ship and badly\r\nloaden, rolled beyond belief; so that the skipper trembled for his\r\nmasts, and I for my life. We made no progress on our course. An\r\nunbearable ill-humour settled on the ship: men, mates, and master,\r\ngirding at one another all day long. A saucy word on the one hand, and\r\na blow on the other, made a daily incident. There were times when the\r\nwhole crew refused their duty; and we of the afterguard were twice got\r\nunder arms\xe2\x80\x94being the first time that ever I bore weapons\xe2\x80\x94in the fear of\r\nmutiny.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of our evil season sprang up a hurricane of wind; so that\r\nall supposed she must go down. I was shut in the cabin from noon of one\r\nday till sundown of the next; the Master was somewhere lashed on deck.\r\nSecundra had eaten of some drug and lay insensible; so you may say I\r\npassed these hours in an unbroken solitude. At first I was terrified\r\nbeyond motion, and almost beyond thought, my mind appearing to be\r\nfrozen. Presently there stole in on me a ray of comfort. If the\r\n_Nonesuch_ foundered, she would carry down with her into the deeps of\r\nthat unsounded sea the creature whom we all so feared and hated; there\r\nwould be no more Master of Ballantrae, the fish would sport among his\r\nribs; his schemes all brought to nothing, his harmless enemies at\r\npeace. At first, I have said, it was but a ray of comfort; but it had\r\nsoon grown to be broad sunshine. The thought of the man\xe2\x80\x99s death, of his\r\ndeletion from this world, which he embittered for so many, took\r\npossession of my mind. I hugged it, I found it sweet in my belly. I\r\nconceived the ship\xe2\x80\x99s last plunge, the sea bursting upon all sides into\r\nthe cabin, the brief mortal conflict there, all by myself, in that\r\nclosed place; I numbered the horrors, I had almost said with\r\nsatisfaction; I felt I could bear all and more, if the _Nonesuch_\r\ncarried down with her, overtook by the same ruin, the enemy of my poor\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s house. Towards noon of the second day the screaming of the\r\nwind abated; the ship lay not so perilously over, and it began to be\r\nclear to me that we were past the height of the tempest. As I hope for\r\nmercy, I was singly disappointed. In the selfishness of that vile,\r\nabsorbing passion of hatred, I forgot the case of our innocent\r\nshipmates, and thought but of myself and my enemy. For myself, I was\r\nalready old; I had never been young, I was not formed for the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npleasures, I had few affections; it mattered not the toss of a silver\r\ntester whether I was drowned there and then in the Atlantic, or\r\ndribbled out a few more years, to die, perhaps no less terribly, in a\r\ndeserted sick-bed. Down I went upon my knees\xe2\x80\x94holding on by the locker,\r\nor else I had been instantly dashed across the tossing cabin\xe2\x80\x94and,\r\nlifting up my voice in the midst of that clamour of the abating\r\nhurricane, impiously prayed for my own death. \xe2\x80\x9cO God!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwould be liker a man if I rose and struck this creature down; but Thou\r\nmadest me a coward from my mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb. O Lord, Thou madest me so,\r\nThou knowest my weakness, Thou knowest that any face of death will set\r\nme shaking in my shoes. But, lo! here is Thy servant ready, his mortal\r\nweakness laid aside. Let me give my life for this creature\xe2\x80\x99s; take the\r\ntwo of them, Lord! take the two, and have mercy on the innocent!\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\nsome such words as these, only yet more irreverent and with more sacred\r\nadjurations, I continued to pour forth my spirit. God heard me not, I\r\nmust suppose in mercy; and I was still absorbed in my agony of\r\nsupplication when some one, removing the tarpaulin cover, let the light\r\nof the sunset pour into the cabin. I stumbled to my feet ashamed, and\r\nwas seized with surprise to find myself totter and ache like one that\r\nhad been stretched upon the rack. Secundra Dass, who had slept off the\r\neffects of his drug, stood in a corner not far off, gazing at me with\r\nwild eyes; and from the open skylight the captain thanked me for my\r\nsupplications.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s you that saved the ship, Mr. Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no\r\ncraft of seamanship that could have kept her floating: well may we say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Except the Lord the city keep, the watchmen watch in vain!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was abashed by the captain\xe2\x80\x99s error; abashed, also, by the surprise\r\nand fear with which the Indian regarded me at first, and the obsequious\r\ncivilities with which he soon began to cumber me. I know now that he\r\nmust have overheard and comprehended the peculiar nature of my prayers.\r\nIt is certain, of course, that he at once disclosed the matter to his\r\npatron; and looking back with greater knowledge, I can now understand\r\nwhat so much puzzled me at the moment, those singular and (so to speak)\r\napproving smiles with which the Master honoured me. Similarly, I can\r\nunderstand a word that I remember to have fallen from him in\r\nconversation that same night; when, holding up his hand and smiling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cnot every man is so great a coward as he\r\nthinks he is\xe2\x80\x94nor yet so good a Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d He did not guess how true he\r\nspoke! For the fact is, the thoughts which had come to me in the\r\nviolence of the storm retained their hold upon my spirit; and the words\r\nthat rose to my lips unbidden in the instancy of prayer continued to\r\nsound in my ears: with what shameful consequences, it is fitting I\r\nshould honestly relate; for I could not support a part of such\r\ndisloyalty as to describe the sins of others and conceal my own.\r\n\r\nThe wind fell, but the sea hove ever the higher. All night the\r\n_Nonesuch_ rolled outrageously; the next day dawned, and the next, and\r\nbrought no change. To cross the cabin was scarce possible; old\r\nexperienced seamen were cast down upon the deck, and one cruelly mauled\r\nin the concussion; every board and block in the old ship cried out\r\naloud; and the great bell by the anchor-bitts continually and dolefully\r\nrang. One of these days the Master and I sate alone together at the\r\nbreak of the poop. I should say the _Nonesuch_ carried a high, raised\r\npoop. About the top of it ran considerable bulwarks, which made the\r\nship unweatherly; and these, as they approached the front on each side,\r\nran down in a fine, old-fashioned, carven scroll to join the bulwarks\r\nof the waist. From this disposition, which seems designed rather for\r\nornament than use, it followed there was a discontinuance of\r\nprotection: and that, besides, at the very margin of the elevated part\r\nwhere (in certain movements of the ship) it might be the most needful.\r\nIt was here we were sitting: our feet hanging down, the Master betwixt\r\nme and the side, and I holding on with both hands to the grating of the\r\ncabin skylight; for it struck me it was a dangerous position, the more\r\nso as I had continually before my eyes a measure of our evolutions in\r\nthe person of the Master, which stood out in the break of the bulwarks\r\nagainst the sun. Now his head would be in the zenith and his shadow\r\nfall quite beyond the _Nonesuch_ on the farther side; and now he would\r\nswing down till he was underneath my feet, and the line of the sea\r\nleaped high above him like the ceiling of a room. I looked on upon this\r\nwith a growing fascination, as birds are said to look on snakes. My\r\nmind, besides, was troubled with an astonishing diversity of noises;\r\nfor now that we had all sails spread in the vain hope to bring her to\r\nthe sea, the ship sounded like a factory with their reverberations. We\r\nspoke first of the mutiny with which we had been threatened; this led\r\nus on to the topic of assassination; and that offered a temptation to\r\nthe Master more strong than he was able to resist. He must tell me a\r\ntale, and show me at the same time how clever he was and how wicked. It\r\nwas a thing he did always with affectation and display; generally with\r\na good effect. But this tale, told in a high key in the midst of so\r\ngreat a tumult, and by a narrator who was one moment looking down at me\r\nfrom the skies and the next up from under the soles of my feet\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nparticular tale, I say, took hold upon me in a degree quite singular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend the count,\xe2\x80\x9d it was thus that he began his story, \xe2\x80\x9chad for an\r\nenemy a certain German baron, a stranger in Rome. It matters not what\r\nwas the ground of the count\xe2\x80\x99s enmity; but as he had a firm design to be\r\nrevenged, and that with safety to himself, he kept it secret even from\r\nthe baron. Indeed, that is the first principle of vengeance; and hatred\r\nbetrayed is hatred impotent. The count was a man of a curious,\r\nsearching mind; he had something of the artist; if anything fell for\r\nhim to do, it must always be done with an exact perfection, not only as\r\nto the result, but in the very means and instruments, or he thought the\r\nthing miscarried. It chanced he was one day riding in the outer\r\nsuburbs, when he came to a disused by-road branching off into the moor\r\nwhich lies about Rome. On the one hand was an ancient Roman tomb; on\r\nthe other a deserted house in a garden of evergreen trees. This road\r\nbrought him presently into a field of ruins, in the midst of which, in\r\nthe side of a hill, he saw an open door, and, not far off, a single\r\nstunted pine no greater than a currant-bush. The place was desert and\r\nvery secret; a voice spoke in the count\xe2\x80\x99s bosom that there was\r\nsomething here to his advantage. He tied his horse to the pine-tree,\r\ntook his flint and steel in his hand to make a light, and entered into\r\nthe hill. The doorway opened on a passage of old Roman masonry, which\r\nshortly after branched in two. The count took the turning to the right,\r\nand followed it, groping forward in the dark, till he was brought up by\r\na kind of fence, about elbow-high, which extended quite across the\r\npassage. Sounding forward with his foot, he found an edge of polished\r\nstone, and then vacancy. All his curiosity was now awakened, and,\r\ngetting some rotten sticks that lay about the floor, he made a fire. In\r\nfront of him was a profound well; doubtless some neighbouring peasant\r\nhad once used it for his water, and it was he that had set up the\r\nfence. A long while the count stood leaning on the rail and looking\r\ndown into the pit. It was of Roman foundation, and, like all that\r\nnation set their hands to, built as for eternity; the sides were still\r\nstraight, and the joints smooth; to a man who should fall in, no escape\r\nwas possible. \xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 the count was thinking, \xe2\x80\x98a strong impulsion\r\nbrought me to this place. What for? what have I gained? why should I be\r\nsent to gaze into this well?\xe2\x80\x99 when the rail of the fence gave suddenly\r\nunder his weight, and he came within an ace of falling headlong in.\r\nLeaping back to save himself, he trod out the last flicker of his fire,\r\nwhich gave him thenceforward no more light, only an incommoding smoke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was I sent here to my death?\xe2\x80\x99 says he, and shook from head to foot.\r\nAnd then a thought flashed in his mind. He crept forth on hands and\r\nknees to the brink of the pit, and felt above him in the air. The rail\r\nhad been fast to a pair of uprights; it had only broken from the one,\r\nand still depended from the other. The count set it back again as he\r\nhad found it, so that the place meant death to the first comer, and\r\ngroped out of the catacomb like a sick man. The next day, riding in the\r\nCorso with the baron, he purposely betrayed a strong preoccupation. The\r\nother (as he had designed) inquired into the cause; and he, after some\r\nfencing, admitted that his spirits had been dashed by an unusual dream.\r\nThis was calculated to draw on the baron\xe2\x80\x94a superstitious man, who\r\naffected the scorn of superstition. Some rallying followed, and then\r\nthe count, as if suddenly carried away, called on his friend to beware,\r\nfor it was of him that he had dreamed. You know enough of human nature,\r\nmy excellent Mackellar, to be certain of one thing: I mean that the\r\nbaron did not rest till he had heard the dream. The count, sure that he\r\nwould never desist, kept him in play till his curiosity was highly\r\ninflamed, and then suffered himself, with seeming reluctance, to be\r\noverborne. \xe2\x80\x98I warn you,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98evil will come of it; something\r\ntells me so. But since there is to be no peace either for you or me\r\nexcept on this condition, the blame be on your own head! This was the\r\ndream:\xe2\x80\x94I beheld you riding, I know not where, yet I think it must have\r\nbeen near Rome, for on your one hand was an ancient tomb, and on the\r\nother a garden of evergreen trees. Methought I cried and cried upon you\r\nto come back in a very agony of terror; whether you heard me I know\r\nnot, but you went doggedly on. The road brought you to a desert place\r\namong ruins, where was a door in a hillside, and hard by the door a\r\nmisbegotten pine. Here you dismounted (I still crying on you to\r\nbeware), tied your horse to the pine-tree, and entered resolutely in by\r\nthe door. Within, it was dark; but in my dream I could still see you,\r\nand still besought you to hold back. You felt your way along the\r\nright-hand wall, took a branching passage to the right, and came to a\r\nlittle chamber, where was a well with a railing. At this\xe2\x80\x94I know not\r\nwhy\xe2\x80\x94my alarm for you increased a thousandfold, so that I seemed to\r\nscream myself hoarse with warnings, crying it was still time, and\r\nbidding you begone at once from that vestibule. Such was the word I\r\nused in my dream, and it seemed then to have a clear significancy; but\r\nto-day, and awake, I profess I know not what it means. To all my outcry\r\nyou rendered not the least attention, leaning the while upon the rail\r\nand looking down intently in the water. And then there was made to you\r\na communication; I do not think I even gathered what it was, but the\r\nfear of it plucked me clean out of my slumber, and I awoke shaking and\r\nsobbing. And now,\xe2\x80\x99 continues the count, \xe2\x80\x98I thank you from my heart for\r\nyour insistency. This dream lay on me like a load; and now I have told\r\nit in plain words and in the broad daylight, it seems no great\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I do not know,\xe2\x80\x99 says the baron. \xe2\x80\x98It is in some points\r\nstrange. A communication, did you say? Oh! it is an odd dream. It will\r\nmake a story to amuse our friends.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I am not so sure,\xe2\x80\x99 says the count.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sensible of some reluctancy. Let us rather forget it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98By all\r\nmeans,\xe2\x80\x99 says the baron. And (in fact) the dream was not again referred\r\nto. Some days after, the count proposed a ride in the fields, which the\r\nbaron (since they were daily growing faster friends) very readily\r\naccepted. On the way back to Rome, the count led them insensibly by a\r\nparticular route. Presently he reined in his horse, clapped his hand\r\nbefore his eyes, and cried out aloud. Then he showed his face again\r\n(which was now quite white, for he was a consummate actor), and stared\r\nupon the baron. \xe2\x80\x98What ails you?\xe2\x80\x99 cries the baron. \xe2\x80\x98What is wrong with\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 cries the count. \xe2\x80\x98It is nothing. A seizure, I know not\r\nwhat. Let us hurry back to Rome.\xe2\x80\x99 But in the meanwhile the baron had\r\nlooked about him; and there, on the left-hand side of the way as they\r\nwent back to Rome, he saw a dusty by-road with a tomb upon the one hand\r\nand a garden of evergreen trees upon the other.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, with a\r\nchanged voice. \xe2\x80\x98Let us by all means hurry back to Rome. I fear you are\r\nnot well in health.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Oh, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x99 cries the count, shuddering,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98back to Rome and let me get to bed.\xe2\x80\x99 They made their return with\r\nscarce a word; and the count, who should by rights have gone into\r\nsociety, took to his bed and gave out he had a touch of country fever.\r\nThe next day the baron\xe2\x80\x99s horse was found tied to the pine, but himself\r\nwas never heard of from that hour.\xe2\x80\x94And, now, was that a murder?\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nthe Master, breaking sharply off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure he was a count?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not certain of the title,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he was a gentleman of\r\nfamily: and the Lord deliver you, Mackellar, from an enemy so subtile!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese last words he spoke down at me, smiling, from high above; the\r\nnext, he was under my feet. I continued to follow his evolutions with a\r\nchildish fixity; they made me giddy and vacant, and I spoke as in a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hated the baron with a great hatred?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis belly moved when the man came near him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have felt that same,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerily!\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is news indeed! I wonder\xe2\x80\x94do I flatter\r\nmyself? or am I the cause of these ventral perturbations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was quite capable of choosing out a graceful posture, even with no\r\none to behold him but myself, and all the more if there were any\r\nelement of peril. He sat now with one knee flung across the other, his\r\narms on his bosom, fitting the swing of the ship with an exquisite\r\nbalance, such as a featherweight might overthrow. All at once I had the\r\nvision of my lord at the table, with his head upon his hands; only now,\r\nwhen he showed me his countenance, it was heavy with reproach. The\r\nwords of my own prayer\xe2\x80\x94_I were liker a man if I struck this creature\r\ndown_\xe2\x80\x94shot at the same time into my memory. I called my energies\r\ntogether, and (the ship then heeling downward toward my enemy) thrust\r\nat him swiftly with my foot. It was written I should have the guilt of\r\nthis attempt without the profit. Whether from my own uncertainty or his\r\nincredible quickness, he escaped the thrust, leaping to his feet and\r\ncatching hold at the same moment of a stay.\r\n\r\nI do not know how long a time passed by. I lying where I was upon the\r\ndeck, overcome with terror and remorse and shame: he standing with the\r\nstay in his hand, backed against the bulwarks, and regarding me with an\r\nexpression singularly mingled. At last he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI make no reproaches, but I offer you a bargain.\r\nOn your side, I do not suppose you desire to have this exploit made\r\npublic; on mine, I own to you freely I do not care to draw my breath in\r\na perpetual terror of assassination by the man I sit at meat with.\r\nPromise me\xe2\x80\x94but no,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, breaking off, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not yet in the\r\nquiet possession of your mind; you might think I had extorted the\r\npromise from your weakness; and I would leave no door open for\r\ncasuistry to come in\xe2\x80\x94that dishonesty of the conscientious. Take time to\r\nmeditate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he made off up the sliding deck like a squirrel, and plunged\r\ninto the cabin. About half an hour later he returned\xe2\x80\x94I still lying as\r\nhe had left me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you give me your troth as a Christian, and a\r\nfaithful servant of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s, that I shall have no more to fear\r\nfrom your attempts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give it you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall require your hand upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have the right to make conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, and we shook hands.\r\n\r\nHe sat down at once in the same place and the old perilous attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, covering my eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot bear to see you in that\r\nposture. The least irregularity of the sea might plunge you overboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are highly inconsistent,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, smiling, but doing as I\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cFor all that, Mackellar, I would have you to know you have\r\nrisen forty feet in my esteem. You think I cannot set a price upon\r\nfidelity? But why do you suppose I carry that Secundra Dass about the\r\nworld with me? Because he would die or do murder for me to-morrow; and\r\nI love him for it. Well, you may think it odd, but I like you the\r\nbetter for this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s performance. I thought you were magnetised\r\nwith the Ten Commandments; but no\xe2\x80\x94God damn my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he cries, \xe2\x80\x9cthe old\r\nwife has blood in his body after all! Which does not change the fact,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe continued, smiling again, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have done well to give your\r\npromise; for I doubt if you would ever shine in your new trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI should ask your pardon and God\xe2\x80\x99s for my\r\nattempt. At any rate, I have passed my word, which I will keep\r\nfaithfully. But when I think of those you persecute\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife is a singular thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand mankind a very singular\r\npeople. You suppose yourself to love my brother. I assure you, it is\r\nmerely custom. Interrogate your memory; and when first you came to\r\nDurrisdeer, you will find you considered him a dull, ordinary youth. He\r\nis as dull and ordinary now, though not so young. Had you instead\r\nfallen in with me, you would to-day be as strong upon my side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would never say you were ordinary, Mr. Bally,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned; \xe2\x80\x9cbut here\r\nyou prove yourself dull. You have just shown your reliance on my word.\r\nIn other terms, that is my conscience\xe2\x80\x94the same which starts\r\ninstinctively back from you, like the eye from a strong light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I mean otherwise. I mean, had I met you in my\r\nyouth. You are to consider I was not always as I am to-day; nor (had I\r\nmet in with a friend of your description) should I have ever been so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHut, Mr. Bally,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would have made a mock of me; you would\r\nnever have spent ten civil words on such a Square-toes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he was now fairly started on his new course of justification, with\r\nwhich he wearied me throughout the remainder of the passage. No doubt\r\nin the past he had taken pleasure to paint himself unnecessarily black,\r\nand made a vaunt of his wickedness, bearing it for a coat-of-arms. Nor\r\nwas he so illogical as to abate one item of his old confessions. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nnow that I know you are a human being,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cI can take the\r\ntrouble to explain myself. For I assure you I am human, too, and have\r\nmy virtues, like my neighbours.\xe2\x80\x9d I say, he wearied me, for I had only\r\nthe one word to say in answer: twenty times I must have said it: \xe2\x80\x9cGive\r\nup your present purpose and return with me to Durrisdeer; then I will\r\nbelieve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon he would shake his head at me. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! Mackellar, you might live\r\na thousand years and never understand my nature,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nbattle is now committed, the hour of reflection quite past, the hour\r\nfor mercy not yet come. It began between us when we span a coin in the\r\nhall of Durrisdeer, now twenty years ago; we have had our ups and\r\ndowns, but never either of us dreamed of giving in; and as for me, when\r\nmy glove is cast, life and honour go with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fig for your honour!\xe2\x80\x9d I would say. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd by your leave, these warlike\r\nsimilitudes are something too high-sounding for the matter in hand. You\r\nwant some dirty money; there is the bottom of your contention; and as\r\nfor your means, what are they? to stir up sorrow in a family that never\r\nharmed you, to debauch (if you can) your own nephew, and to wring the\r\nheart of your born brother! A footpad that kills an old granny in a\r\nwoollen mutch with a dirty bludgeon, and that for a shilling-piece and\r\na paper of snuff\xe2\x80\x94there is all the warrior that you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I would attack him thus (or somewhat thus) he would smile, and\r\nsigh like a man misunderstood. Once, I remember, he defended himself\r\nmore at large, and had some curious sophistries, worth repeating, for a\r\nlight upon his character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very like a civilian to think war consists in drums and\r\nbanners,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWar (as the ancients said very wisely) is _ultima\r\nratio_. When we take our advantage unrelentingly, then we make war. Ah!\r\nMackellar, you are a devil of a soldier in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s room at\r\nDurrisdeer, or the tenants do you sad injustice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think little of what war is or is not,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you weary me\r\nwith claiming my respect. Your brother is a good man, and you are a bad\r\none\xe2\x80\x94neither more nor less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad I been Alexander\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so we all dupe ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHad I been St. Paul, it\r\nwould have been all one; I would have made the same hash of that career\r\nthat you now see me making of my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, bearing down my interruption, \xe2\x80\x9chad I been the\r\nleast petty chieftain in the Highlands, had I been the least king of\r\nnaked negroes in the African desert, my people would have adored me. A\r\nbad man, am I? Ah! but I was born for a good tyrant! Ask Secundra Dass;\r\nhe will tell you I treat him like a son. Cast in your lot with me\r\nto-morrow, become my slave, my chattel, a thing I can command as I\r\ncommand the powers of my own limbs and spirit\xe2\x80\x94you will see no more that\r\ndark side that I turn upon the world in anger. I must have all or none.\r\nBut where all is given, I give it back with usury. I have a kingly\r\nnature: there is my loss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been hitherto rather the loss of others,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich\r\nseems a little on the hither side of royalty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTilly-vally!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cEven now, I tell you, I would spare that\r\nfamily in which you take so great an interest: yes, even now\xe2\x80\x94to-morrow\r\nI would leave them to their petty welfare, and disappear in that forest\r\nof cut-throats and thimble-riggers that we call the world. I would do\r\nit to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\xe2\x80\x94only\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly what?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly they must beg it on their bended knees. I think in public, too,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Mackellar, I doubt if there be a hall big\r\nenough to serve my purpose for that act of reparation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVanity, vanity!\xe2\x80\x9d I moralised. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think that this great force for evil\r\nshould be swayed by the same sentiment that sets a lassie mincing to\r\nher glass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! there are double words for everything: the word that swells, the\r\nword that belittles; you cannot fight me with a word!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nsaid the other day that I relied on your conscience: were I in your\r\nhumour of detraction, I might say I built upon your vanity. It is your\r\npretension to be _un homme de parole_; \xe2\x80\x98tis mine not to accept defeat.\r\nCall it vanity, call it virtue, call it greatness of soul\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nsignifies the expression? But recognise in each of us a common strain:\r\nthat we both live for an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt will be gathered from so much familiar talk, and so much patience on\r\nboth sides, that we now lived together upon excellent terms. Such was\r\nagain the fact, and this time more seriously than before. Apart from\r\ndisputations such as that which I have tried to reproduce, not only\r\nconsideration reigned, but, I am tempted to say, even kindness. When I\r\nfell sick (as I did shortly after our great storm), he sat by my berth\r\nto entertain me with his conversation, and treated me with excellent\r\nremedies, which I accepted with security. Himself commented on the\r\ncircumstance. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou begin to know me better. A very\r\nlittle while ago, upon this lonely ship, where no one but myself has\r\nany smattering of science, you would have made sure I had designs upon\r\nyour life. And, observe, it is since I found you had designs upon my\r\nown, that I have shown you most respect. You will tell me if this\r\nspeaks of a small mind.\xe2\x80\x9d I found little to reply. In so far as regarded\r\nmyself, I believed him to mean well; I am, perhaps, the more a dupe of\r\nhis dissimulation, but I believed (and I still believe) that he\r\nregarded me with genuine kindness. Singular and sad fact! so soon as\r\nthis change began, my animosity abated, and these haunting visions of\r\nmy master passed utterly away. So that, perhaps, there was truth in the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s last vaunting word to me, uttered on the second day of July, when\r\nour long voyage was at last brought almost to an end, and we lay\r\nbecalmed at the sea end of the vast harbour of New York, in a gasping\r\nheat, which was presently exchanged for a surprising waterfall of rain.\r\nI stood on the poop, regarding the green shores near at hand, and now\r\nand then the light smoke of the little town, our destination. And as I\r\nwas even then devising how to steal a march on my familiar enemy, I was\r\nconscious of a shade of embarrassment when he approached me with his\r\nhand extended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am now to bid you farewell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand that for ever. For now\r\nyou go among my enemies, where all your former prejudices will revive.\r\nI never yet failed to charm a person when I wanted; even you, my good\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x94to call you so for once\xe2\x80\x94even you have now a very different\r\nportrait of me in your memory, and one that you will never quite\r\nforget. The voyage has not lasted long enough, or I should have wrote\r\nthe impression deeper. But now all is at an end, and we are again at\r\nwar. Judge by this little interlude how dangerous I am; and tell those\r\nfools\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94pointing with his finger to the town\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto think twice and thrice\r\nbefore they set me at defiance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nPASSAGES AT NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have mentioned I was resolved to steal a march upon the Master; and\r\nthis, with the complicity of Captain McMurtrie, was mighty easily\r\neffected: a boat being partly loaded on the one side of our ship and\r\nthe Master placed on board of it, the while a skiff put off from the\r\nother, carrying me alone. I had no more trouble in finding a direction\r\nto my lord\xe2\x80\x99s house, whither I went at top speed, and which I found to\r\nbe on the outskirts of the place, a very suitable mansion, in a fine\r\ngarden, with an extraordinary large barn, byre, and stable, all in one.\r\nIt was here my lord was walking when I arrived; indeed, it had become\r\nhis chief place of frequentation, and his mind was now filled with\r\nfarming. I burst in upon him breathless, and gave him my news: which\r\nwas indeed no news at all, several ships having outsailed the\r\n_Nonesuch_ in the interval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been expecting you long,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord; \xe2\x80\x9cand indeed, of late\r\ndays, ceased to expect you any more. I am glad to take your hand again,\r\nMackellar. I thought you had been at the bottom of the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my lord, would God I had!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I. \xe2\x80\x9cThings would have been better\r\nfor yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, grimly. \xe2\x80\x9cI could not ask better. There is\r\na long score to pay, and now\xe2\x80\x94at last\xe2\x80\x94I can begin to pay it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI cried out against his security.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not Durrisdeer, and I have taken my\r\nprecautions. His reputation awaits him; I have prepared a welcome for\r\nmy brother. Indeed, fortune has served me; for I found here a merchant\r\nof Albany who knew him after the \xe2\x80\x9945 and had mighty convenient\r\nsuspicions of a murder: some one of the name of Chew it was, another\r\nAlbanian. No one here will be surprised if I deny him my door; he will\r\nnot be suffered to address my children, nor even to salute my wife: as\r\nfor myself, I make so much exception for a brother that he may speak to\r\nme. I should lose my pleasure else,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, rubbing his palms.\r\n\r\nPresently he bethought himself, and set men off running, with billets,\r\nto summon the magnates of the province. I cannot recall what pretext he\r\nemployed; at least, it was successful; and when our ancient enemy\r\nappeared upon the scene, he found my lord pacing in front of his house\r\nunder some trees of shade, with the Governor upon one hand and various\r\nnotables upon the other. My lady, who was seated in the verandah, rose\r\nwith a very pinched expression and carried her children into the house.\r\n\r\nThe Master, well dressed and with an elegant walking-sword, bowed to\r\nthe company in a handsome manner and nodded to my lord with\r\nfamiliarity. My lord did not accept the salutation, but looked upon his\r\nbrother with bended brows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, at last, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat ill wind brings you hither of all\r\nplaces, where (to our common disgrace) your reputation has preceded\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour lordship is pleased to be civil,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master, with a fine\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am pleased to be very plain,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my lord; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it is\r\nneedful you should clearly understand your situation. At home, where\r\nyou were so little known, it was still possible to keep appearances;\r\nthat would be quite vain in this province; and I have to tell you that\r\nI am quite resolved to wash my hands of you. You have already ruined me\r\nalmost to the door, as you ruined my father before me;\xe2\x80\x94whose heart you\r\nalso broke. Your crimes escape the law; but my friend the Governor has\r\npromised protection to my family. Have a care, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord,\r\nshaking his cane at him: \xe2\x80\x9cif you are observed to utter two words to any\r\nof my innocent household, the law shall be stretched to make you smart\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master, very slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so this is the advantage of a\r\nforeign land! These gentlemen are unacquainted with our story, I\r\nperceive. They do not know that I am the Lord Durrisdeer; they do not\r\nknow you are my younger brother, sitting in my place under a sworn\r\nfamily compact; they do not know (or they would not be seen with you in\r\nfamiliar correspondence) that every acre is mine before God\r\nAlmighty\xe2\x80\x94and every doit of the money you withhold from me, you do it as\r\na thief, a perjurer, and a disloyal brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not listen to his lies. I am the\r\nsteward of the estate, and there is not one word of truth in it. The\r\nman is a forfeited rebel turned into a hired spy: there is his story in\r\ntwo words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was thus that (in the heat of the moment) I let slip his infamy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Governor, turning his face sternly on the Master, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow more of you than you think for. We have some broken ends of your\r\nadventures in the provinces, which you will do very well not to drive\r\nme to investigate. There is the disappearance of Mr. Jacob Chew with\r\nall his merchandise; there is the matter of where you came ashore from\r\nwith so much money and jewels, when you were picked up by a Bermudan\r\nout of Albany. Believe me, if I let these matters lie, it is in\r\ncommiseration for your family and out of respect for my valued friend,\r\nLord Durrisdeer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of applause from the provincials.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have remembered how a title would shine out in such a hole as\r\nthis,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Master, white as a sheet: \xe2\x80\x9cno matter how unjustly come\r\nby. It remains for me, then, to die at my lord\xe2\x80\x99s door, where my dead\r\nbody will form a very cheerful ornament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway with your affectations!\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know very well I\r\nhave no such meaning; only to protect myself from calumny, and my home\r\nfrom your intrusion. I offer you a choice. Either I shall pay your\r\npassage home on the first ship, when you may perhaps be able to resume\r\nyour occupations under Government, although God knows I would rather\r\nsee you on the highway! Or, if that likes you not, stay here and\r\nwelcome! I have inquired the least sum on which body and soul can be\r\ndecently kept together in New York; so much you shall have, paid\r\nweekly; and if you cannot labour with your hands to better it, high\r\ntime you should betake yourself to learn. The condition is\xe2\x80\x94that you\r\nspeak with no member of my family except myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nI do not think I have ever seen any man so pale as was the Master; but\r\nhe was erect and his mouth firm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been met here with some very unmerited insults,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom\r\nwhich I have certainly no idea to take refuge by flight. Give me your\r\npittance; I take it without shame, for it is mine already\xe2\x80\x94like the\r\nshirt upon your back; and I choose to stay until these gentlemen shall\r\nunderstand me better. Already they must spy the cloven hoof, since with\r\nall your pretended eagerness for the family honour, you take a pleasure\r\nto degrade it in my person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very fine,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord; \xe2\x80\x9cbut to us who know you of old,\r\nyou must be sure it signifies nothing. You take that alternative out of\r\nwhich you think that you can make the most. Take it, if you can, in\r\nsilence; it will serve you better in the long run, you may believe me,\r\nthan this ostentation of ingratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, gratitude, my lord!\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Master, with a mounting intonation\r\nand his forefinger very conspicuously lifted up. \xe2\x80\x9cBe at rest: it will\r\nnot fail you. It now remains that I should salute these gentlemen whom\r\nwe have wearied with our family affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he bowed to each in succession, settled his walking-sword, and took\r\nhimself off, leaving every one amazed at his behaviour, and me not less\r\nso at my lord\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n We were now to enter on a changed phase of this family division. The\r\n Master was by no manner of means so helpless as my lord supposed,\r\n having at his hand, and entirely devoted to his service, an excellent\r\n artist in all sorts of goldsmith work. With my lord\xe2\x80\x99s allowance, which\r\n was not so scanty as he had described it, the pair could support life;\r\n and all the earnings of Secundra Dass might be laid upon one side for\r\n any future purpose. That this was done, I have no doubt. It was in all\r\n likelihood the Master\xe2\x80\x99s design to gather a sufficiency, and then\r\n proceed in quest of that treasure which he had buried long before\r\n among the mountains; to which, if he had confined himself, he would\r\n have been more happily inspired. But unfortunately for himself and all\r\n of us, he took counsel of his anger. The public disgrace of his\r\n arrival\xe2\x80\x94which I sometimes wonder he could manage to survive\xe2\x80\x94rankled in\r\n his bones; he was in that humour when a man\xe2\x80\x94in the words of the old\r\n adage\xe2\x80\x94will cut off his nose to spite his face; and he must make\r\n himself a public spectacle in the hopes that some of the disgrace\r\n might spatter on my lord.\r\n\r\nHe chose, in a poor quarter of the town, a lonely, small house of\r\nboards, overhung with some acacias. It was furnished in front with a\r\nsort of hutch opening, like that of a dog\xe2\x80\x99s kennel, but about as high\r\nas a table from the ground, in which the poor man that built it had\r\nformerly displayed some wares; and it was this which took the Master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfancy and possibly suggested his proceedings. It appears, on board the\r\npirate ship he had acquired some quickness with the needle\xe2\x80\x94enough, at\r\nleast, to play the part of tailor in the public eye; which was all that\r\nwas required by the nature of his vengeance. A placard was hung above\r\nthe hutch, bearing these words in something of the following\r\ndisposition:\r\n\r\nJames Durie,\r\nformerly MASTER of BALLANTRAE.\r\nClothes Neatly Clouted.\r\n\r\nSECUNDRA DASS,\r\nDecayed Gentleman of India.\r\nFine Goldsmith Work.\r\n\r\nUnderneath this, when he had a job, my gentleman sat withinside\r\ntailor-wise and busily stitching. I say, when he had a job; but such\r\ncustomers as came were rather for Secundra, and the Master\xe2\x80\x99s sewing\r\nwould be more in the manner of Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s. He could never have designed\r\nto gain even butter to his bread by such a means of livelihood: enough\r\nfor him that there was the name of Durie dragged in the dirt on the\r\nplacard, and the sometime heir of that proud family set up cross-legged\r\nin public for a reproach upon his brother\xe2\x80\x99s meanness. And in so far his\r\ndevice succeeded that there was murmuring in the town and a party\r\nformed highly inimical to my lord. My lord\xe2\x80\x99s favour with the Governor\r\nlaid him more open on the other side; my lady (who was never so well\r\nreceived in the colony) met with painful innuendoes; in a party of\r\nwomen, where it would be the topic most natural to introduce, she was\r\nalmost debarred from the naming of needle-work; and I have seen her\r\nreturn with a flushed countenance and vow that she would go abroad no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile my lord dwelled in his decent mansion, immersed in\r\nfarming; a popular man with his intimates, and careless or unconscious\r\nof the rest. He laid on flesh; had a bright, busy face; even the heat\r\nseemed to prosper with him; and my lady\xe2\x80\x94in despite of her own\r\nannoyances\xe2\x80\x94daily blessed Heaven her father should have left her such a\r\nparadise. She had looked on from a window upon the Master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhumiliation; and from that hour appeared to feel at ease. I was not so\r\nsure myself; as time went on, there seemed to me a something not quite\r\nwholesome in my lord\xe2\x80\x99s condition. Happy he was, beyond a doubt, but the\r\ngrounds of this felicity were wont; even in the bosom of his family he\r\nbrooded with manifest delight upon some private thought; and I\r\nconceived at last the suspicion (quite unworthy of us both) that he\r\nkept a mistress somewhere in the town. Yet he went little abroad, and\r\nhis day was very fully occupied; indeed, there was but a single period,\r\nand that pretty early in the morning, while Mr. Alexander was at his\r\nlesson-book, of which I was not certain of the disposition. It should\r\nbe borne in mind, in the defence of that which I now did, that I was\r\nalways in some fear my lord was not quite justly in his reason; and\r\nwith our enemy sitting so still in the same town with us, I did well to\r\nbe upon my guard. Accordingly I made a pretext, had the hour changed at\r\nwhich I taught Mr. Alexander the foundation of cyphering and the\r\nmathematic, and set myself instead to dog my master\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, fair or foul, he took his gold-headed cane, set his hat\r\non the back of his head\xe2\x80\x94a recent habitude, which I thought to indicate\r\na burning brow\xe2\x80\x94and betook himself to make a certain circuit. At the\r\nfirst his way was among pleasant trees and beside a graveyard, where he\r\nwould sit awhile, if the day were fine, in meditation. Presently the\r\npath turned down to the waterside, and came back along the\r\nharbour-front and past the Master\xe2\x80\x99s booth. As he approached this second\r\npart of his circuit, my Lord Durrisdeer began to pace more leisurely,\r\nlike a man delighted with the air and scene; and before the booth,\r\nhalf-way between that and the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, would pause a little,\r\nleaning on his staff. It was the hour when the Master sate within upon\r\nhis board and plied his needle. So these two brothers would gaze upon\r\neach other with hard faces; and then my lord move on again, smiling to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt was but twice that I must stoop to that ungrateful necessity of\r\nplaying spy. I was then certain of my lord\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in his rambles and\r\nof the secret source of his delight. Here was his mistress: it was\r\nhatred and not love that gave him healthful colours. Some moralists\r\nmight have been relieved by the discovery; I confess that I was\r\ndismayed. I found this situation of two brethren not only odious in\r\nitself, but big with possibilities of further evil; and I made it my\r\npractice, in so far as many occupations would allow, to go by a shorter\r\npath and be secretly present at their meeting. Coming down one day a\r\nlittle late, after I had been near a week prevented, I was struck with\r\nsurprise to find a new development. I should say there was a bench\r\nagainst the Master\xe2\x80\x99s house, where customers might sit to parley with\r\nthe shopman; and here I found my lord seated, nursing his cane and\r\nlooking pleasantly forth upon the bay. Not three feet from him sate the\r\nMaster, stitching. Neither spoke; nor (in this new situation) did my\r\nlord so much as cut a glance upon his enemy. He tasted his\r\nneighbourhood, I must suppose, less indirectly in the bare proximity of\r\nperson; and, without doubt, drank deep of hateful pleasures.\r\n\r\nHe had no sooner come away than I openly joined him. \xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, my\r\nlord,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is no manner of behaviour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grow fat upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; and not merely the words, which were\r\nstrange enough, but the whole character of his expression, shocked me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warn you, my lord, against this indulgency of evil feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not to which it is more perilous, the soul or the reason; but\r\nyou go the way to murder both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had never such mountains of\r\nbitterness upon your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it were no more,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will surely goad the man to\r\nsome extremity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the contrary; I am breaking his spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord.\r\n\r\n Every morning for hard upon a week my lord took his same place upon\r\n the bench. It was a pleasant place, under the green acacias, with a\r\n sight upon the bay and shipping, and a sound (from some way off) of\r\n marines singing at their employ. Here the two sate without speech or\r\n any external movement, beyond that of the needle or the Master biting\r\n off a thread, for he still clung to his pretence of industry; and here\r\n I made a point to join them, wondering at myself and my companions. If\r\n any of my lord\xe2\x80\x99s friends went by, he would hail them cheerfully, and\r\n cry out he was there to give some good advice to his brother, who was\r\n now (to his delight) grown quite industrious. And even this the Master\r\n accepted with a steady countenance; what was in his mind, God knows,\r\n or perhaps Satan only.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, on a still day of what they call the Indian Summer,\r\nwhen the woods were changed into gold and pink and scarlet, the Master\r\nlaid down his needle and burst into a fit of merriment. I think he must\r\nhave been preparing it a long while in silence, for the note in itself\r\nwas pretty naturally pitched; but breaking suddenly from so extreme a\r\nsilence, and in circumstances so averse from mirth, it sounded\r\nominously on my ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI have for once made a false step, and for once you\r\nhave had the wit to profit by it. The farce of the cobbler ends to-day;\r\nand I confess to you (with my compliments) that you have had the best\r\nof it. Blood will out; and you have certainly a choice idea of how to\r\nmake yourself unpleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever a word said my lord; it was just as though the Master had not\r\nbroken silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the Master, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not be sulky; it will spoil your\r\nattitude. You can now afford (believe me) to be a little gracious; for\r\nI have not merely a defeat to accept. I had meant to continue this\r\nperformance till I had gathered enough money for a certain purpose; I\r\nconfess ingenuously, I have not the courage. You naturally desire my\r\nabsence from this town; I have come round by another way to the same\r\nidea. And I have a proposition to make; or, if your lordship prefers, a\r\nfavour to ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk it,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may have heard that I had once in this country a considerable\r\ntreasure,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Master; \xe2\x80\x9cit matters not whether or no\xe2\x80\x94such is\r\nthe fact; and I was obliged to bury it in a spot of which I have\r\nsufficient indications. To the recovery of this, has my ambition now\r\ncome down; and, as it is my own, you will not grudge it me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and get it,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cI make no opposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master; \xe2\x80\x9cbut to do so, I must find men and carriage.\r\nThe way is long and rough, and the country infested with wild Indians.\r\nAdvance me only so much as shall be needful: either as a lump sum, in\r\nlieu of my allowance; or, if you prefer it, as a loan, which I shall\r\nrepay on my return. And then, if you so decide, you may have seen the\r\nlast of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord stared him steadily in the eyes; there was a hard smile upon\r\nhis face, but he uttered nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master, with a formidable quietness, and drawing at\r\nthe same time somewhat back\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHenry, I had the honour to address you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us be stepping homeward,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord to me, who was plucking at\r\nhis sleeve; and with that he rose, stretched himself, settled his hat,\r\nand still without a syllable of response, began to walk steadily along\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nI hesitated awhile between the two brothers, so serious a climax did we\r\nseem to have reached. But the Master had resumed his occupation, his\r\neyes lowered, his hand seemingly as deft as ever; and I decided to\r\npursue my lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you mad?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, so soon as I had overtook him. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you cast\r\naway so fair an opportunity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible you should still believe in him?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired my lord,\r\nalmost with a sneer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish him forth of this town!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish him anywhere and\r\nanyhow but as he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said my say,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my lord, \xe2\x80\x9cand you have said yours. There\r\nlet it rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I was bent on dislodging the Master. That sight of him patiently\r\nreturning to his needlework was more than my imagination could digest.\r\nThere was never a man made, and the Master the least of any, that could\r\naccept so long a series of insults. The air smelt blood to me. And I\r\nvowed there should be no neglect of mine if, through any chink of\r\npossibility, crime could be yet turned aside. That same day, therefore,\r\nI came to my lord in his business room, where he sat upon some trivial\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have found a suitable investment for my small\r\neconomies. But these are unhappily in Scotland; it will take some time\r\nto lift them, and the affair presses. Could your lordship see his way\r\nto advance me the amount against my note?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read me awhile with keen eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never inquired into the state\r\nof your affairs, Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond the amount of your\r\ncaution, you may not be worth a farthing, for what I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been a long while in your service, and never told a lie, nor\r\nyet asked a favour for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA favour for the Master,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you take me for a\r\nfool, Mackellar? Understand it once and for all, I treat this beast in\r\nmy own way; fear nor favour shall not move me; and before I am\r\nhoodwinked, it will require a trickster less transparent than yourself.\r\nI ask service, loyal service; not that you should make and mar behind\r\nmy back, and steal my own money to defeat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are very unpardonable expressions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink once more, Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand you will see they fit\r\nthe fact. It is your own subterfuge that is unpardonable. Deny (if you\r\ncan) that you designed this money to evade my orders with, and I will\r\nask your pardon freely. If you cannot, you must have the resolution to\r\nhear your conduct go by its own name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you think I had any design but to save you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d I began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my old friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know very well what I think! Here is\r\nmy hand to you with all my heart; but of money, not one rap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDefeated upon this side, I went straight to my room, wrote a letter,\r\nran with it to the harbour, for I knew a ship was on the point of\r\nsailing; and came to the Master\xe2\x80\x99s door a little before dusk. Entering\r\nwithout the form of any knock, I found him sitting with his Indian at a\r\nsimple meal of maize porridge with some milk. The house within was\r\nclean and poor; only a few books upon a shelf distinguished it, and (in\r\none corner) Secundra\xe2\x80\x99s little bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bally,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have near five hundred pounds laid by in\r\nScotland, the economies of a hard life. A letter goes by yon ship to\r\nhave it lifted. Have so much patience till the return ship comes in,\r\nand it is all yours, upon the same condition you offered to my lord\r\nthis morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose from the table, came forward, took me by the shoulders, and\r\nlooked me in the face, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you are very fond of money!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you love money\r\nbeyond all things else, except my brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear old age and poverty,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is another matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never quarrel for a name. Call it so,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\r\nMackellar, Mackellar, if this were done from any love to me, how gladly\r\nwould I close upon your offer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d I eagerly answered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI say it to my shame, but I cannot see\r\nyou in this poor place without compunction. It is not my single\r\nthought, nor my first; and yet it\xe2\x80\x99s there! I would gladly see you\r\ndelivered. I do not offer it in love, and far from that; but, as God\r\njudges me\xe2\x80\x94and I wonder at it too!\xe2\x80\x94quite without enmity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, still holding my shoulders, and now gently shaking me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou think of me more than you suppose. \xe2\x80\x98And I wonder at it too,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, repeating my expression and, I suppose, something of my voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an honest man, and for that cause I spare you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare me?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare you,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, letting me go and turning away. And then,\r\nfronting me once more. \xe2\x80\x9cYou little know what I would do with it,\r\nMackellar! Did you think I had swallowed my defeat indeed? Listen: my\r\nlife has been a series of unmerited cast-backs. That fool, Prince\r\nCharlie, mismanaged a most promising affair: there fell my first\r\nfortune. In Paris I had my foot once more high upon the ladder: that\r\ntime it was an accident; a letter came to the wrong hand, and I was\r\nbare again. A third time, I found my opportunity; I built up a place\r\nfor myself in India with an infinite patience; and then Clive came, my\r\nrajah was swallowed up, and I escaped out of the convulsion, like\r\nanother \xc3\x86neas, with Secundra Dass upon my back. Three times I have had\r\nmy hand upon the highest station: and I am not yet three-and-forty. I\r\nknow the world as few men know it when they come to die\xe2\x80\x94Court and camp,\r\nthe East and the West; I know where to go, I see a thousand openings. I\r\nam now at the height of my resources, sound of health, of inordinate\r\nambition. Well, all this I resign; I care not if I die, and the world\r\nnever hear of me; I care only for one thing, and that I will have. Mind\r\nyourself; lest, when the roof falls, you, too, should be crushed under\r\nthe ruins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n As I came out of his house, all hope of intervention quite destroyed,\r\n I was aware of a stir on the harbour-side, and, raising my eyes, there\r\n was a great ship newly come to anchor. It seems strange I could have\r\n looked upon her with so much indifference, for she brought death to\r\n the brothers of Durrisdeer. After all the desperate episodes of this\r\n contention, the insults, the opposing interests, the fraternal duel in\r\n the shrubbery, it was reserved for some poor devil in Grub Street,\r\n scribbling for his dinner, and not caring what he scribbled, to cast a\r\n spell across four thousand miles of the salt sea, and send forth both\r\n these brothers into savage and wintry deserts, there to die. But such\r\n a thought was distant from my mind; and while all the provincials were\r\n fluttered about me by the unusual animation of their port, I passed\r\n throughout their midst on my return homeward, quite absorbed in the\r\n recollection of my visit and the Master\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\r\n\r\nThe same night there was brought to us from the ship a little packet of\r\npamphlets. The next day my lord was under engagement to go with the\r\nGovernor upon some party of pleasure; the time was nearly due, and I\r\nleft him for a moment alone in his room and skimming through the\r\npamphlets. When I returned, his head had fallen upon the table, his\r\narms lying abroad amongst the crumpled papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, my lord!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried as I ran forward, for I supposed he was in\r\nsome fit.\r\n\r\nHe sprang up like a figure upon wires, his countenance deformed with\r\nfury, so that in a strange place I should scarce have known him. His\r\nhand at the same time flew above his head, as though to strike me down.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d he screeched, and I fled, as fast as my shaking legs\r\nwould bear me, for my lady. She, too, lost no time; but when we\r\nreturned, he had the door locked within, and only cried to us from the\r\nother side to leave him be. We looked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces, very\r\nwhite\xe2\x80\x94each supposing the blow had come at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will write to the Governor to excuse him,\xe2\x80\x9d says she. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must keep\r\nour strong friends.\xe2\x80\x9d But when she took up the pen, it flew out of her\r\nfingers. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot write,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will make a shift, my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nShe looked over me as I wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when I had\r\ndone. \xe2\x80\x9cThank God, Mackellar, I have you to lean upon! But what can it\r\nbe now? What, what can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn my own mind, I believed there was no explanation possible, and none\r\nrequired; it was my fear that the man\xe2\x80\x99s madness had now simply burst\r\nforth its way, like the long-smothered flames of a volcano; but to this\r\n(in mere mercy to my lady) I durst not give expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is more to the purpose to consider our own behaviour,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust we leave him there alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not dare disturb him,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cNature may know best; it may\r\nbe Nature that cries to be alone; and we grope in the dark. Oh yes, I\r\nwould leave him as he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, then, despatch this letter, my lady, and return here, if you\r\nplease, to sit with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray do,\xe2\x80\x9d cries my lady.\r\n\r\nAll afternoon we sat together, mostly in silence, watching my lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor. My own mind was busy with the scene that had just passed, and its\r\nsingular resemblance to my vision. I must say a word upon this, for the\r\nstory has gone abroad with great exaggeration, and I have even seen it\r\nprinted, and my own name referred to for particulars. So much was the\r\nsame: here was my lord in a room, with his head upon the table, and\r\nwhen he raised his face, it wore such an expression as distressed me to\r\nthe soul. But the room was different, my lord\xe2\x80\x99s attitude at the table\r\nnot at all the same, and his face, when he disclosed it, expressed a\r\npainful degree of fury instead of that haunting despair which had\r\nalways (except once, already referred to) characterised it in the\r\nvision. There is the whole truth at last before the public; and if the\r\ndifferences be great, the coincidence was yet enough to fill me with\r\nuneasiness. All afternoon, as I say, I sat and pondered upon this quite\r\nto myself; for my lady had trouble of her own, and it was my last\r\nthought to vex her with fancies. About the midst of our time of\r\nwaiting, she conceived an ingenious scheme, had Mr. Alexander fetched,\r\nand bid him knock at his father\xe2\x80\x99s door. My lord sent the boy about his\r\nbusiness, but without the least violence, whether of manner or\r\nexpression; so that I began to entertain a hope the fit was over.\r\n\r\nAt last, as the night fell and I was lighting a lamp that stood there\r\ntrimmed, the door opened and my lord stood within upon the threshold.\r\nThe light was not so strong that we could read his countenance; when he\r\nspoke, methought his voice a little altered but yet perfectly steady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ccarry this note to its destination with your own\r\nhand. It is highly private. Find the person alone when you deliver it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenry,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, querulously, \xe2\x80\x9cI am occupied. Not at all; I am only\r\noccupied. It is a singular thing a man must be supposed to be ill when\r\nhe has any business! Send me supper to this room, and a basket of wine:\r\nI expect the visit of a friend. Otherwise I am not to be disturbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with that he once more shut himself in.\r\n\r\nThe note was addressed to one Captain Harris, at a tavern on the\r\nportside. I knew Harris (by reputation) for a dangerous adventurer,\r\nhighly suspected of piracy in the past, and now following the rude\r\nbusiness of an Indian trader. What my lord should have to say to him,\r\nor he to my lord, it passed my imagination to conceive: or yet how my\r\nlord had heard of him, unless by a disgraceful trial from which the man\r\nwas recently escaped. Altogether I went upon the errand with\r\nreluctance, and from the little I saw of the captain, returned from it\r\nwith sorrow. I found him in a foul-smelling chamber, sitting by a\r\nguttering candle and an empty bottle; he had the remains of a military\r\ncarriage, or rather perhaps it was an affectation, for his manners were\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell my lord, with my service, that I will wait upon his lordship in\r\nthe inside of half an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, when he had read the note; and\r\nthen had the servility, pointing to his empty bottle, to propose that I\r\nshould buy him liquor.\r\n\r\nAlthough I returned with my best speed, the Captain followed close upon\r\nmy heels, and he stayed late into the night. The cock was crowing a\r\nsecond time when I saw (from my chamber window) my lord lighting him to\r\nthe gate, both men very much affected with their potations, and\r\nsometimes leaning one upon the other to confabulate. Yet the next\r\nmorning my lord was abroad again early with a hundred pounds of money\r\nin his pocket. I never supposed that he returned with it; and yet I was\r\nquite sure it did not find its way to the Master, for I lingered all\r\nmorning within view of the booth. That was the last time my Lord\r\nDurrisdeer passed his own enclosure till we left New York; he walked in\r\nhis barn, or sat and talked with his family, all much as usual; but the\r\ntown saw nothing of him, and his daily visits to the Master seemed\r\nforgotten. Nor yet did Harris reappear; or not until the end.\r\n\r\nI was now much oppressed with a sense of the mysteries in which we had\r\nbegun to move. It was plain, if only from his change of habitude, my\r\nlord had something on his mind of a grave nature; but what it was,\r\nwhence it sprang, or why he should now keep the house and garden, I\r\ncould make no guess at. It was clear, even to probation, the pamphlets\r\nhad some share in this revolution; I read all I could find, and they\r\nwere all extremely insignificant, and of the usual kind of party\r\nscurrility; even to a high politician, I could spy out no particular\r\nmatter of offence, and my lord was a man rather indifferent on public\r\nquestions. The truth is, the pamphlet which was the spring of this\r\naffair, lay all the time on my lord\xe2\x80\x99s bosom. There it was that I found\r\nit at last, after he was dead, in the midst of the north wilderness: in\r\nsuch a place, in such dismal circumstances, I was to read for the first\r\ntime these idle, lying words of a Whig pamphleteer declaiming against\r\nindulgency to Jacobites:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnother notorious Rebel, the M\xe2\x80\x94r of B\xe2\x80\x94e, is\r\nto have his Title restored,\xe2\x80\x9d the passage ran. \xe2\x80\x9cThis Business has been\r\nlong in hand, since he rendered some very disgraceful Services in\r\nScotland and France. His Brother, _L\xe2\x80\x94d D\xe2\x80\x94r_, is known to be no better\r\nthan himself in Inclination; and the supposed Heir, who is now to be\r\nset aside, was bred up in the most detestable Principles. In the old\r\nPhrase, it is _six of the one and half a dozen of the other_; but the\r\nFavour of such a Reposition is too extreme to be passed over.\xe2\x80\x9d A man in\r\nhis right wits could not have cared two straws for a tale so manifestly\r\nfalse; that Government should ever entertain the notion, was\r\ninconceivable to any reasoning creature, unless possibly the fool that\r\npenned it; and my lord, though never brilliant, was ever remarkable for\r\nsense. That he should credit such a rodomontade, and carry the pamphlet\r\non his bosom and the words in his heart, is the clear proof of the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s lunacy. Doubtless the mere mention of Mr. Alexander, and the\r\nthreat directly held out against the child\xe2\x80\x99s succession, precipitated\r\nthat which had so long impended. Or else my master had been truly mad\r\nfor a long time, and we were too dull or too much used to him, and did\r\nnot perceive the extent of his infirmity.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after the day of the pamphlets I was late upon the\r\nharbour-side, and took a turn towards the Master\xe2\x80\x99s, as I often did. The\r\ndoor opened, a flood of light came forth upon the road, and I beheld a\r\nman taking his departure with friendly salutations. I cannot say how\r\nsingularly I was shaken to recognise the adventurer Harris. I could not\r\nbut conclude it was the hand of my lord that had brought him there; and\r\nprolonged my walk in very serious and apprehensive thought. It was late\r\nwhen I came home, and there was my lord making up his portmanteau for a\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you come so late?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWe leave to-morrow for Albany,\r\nyou and I together; and it is high time you were about your\r\npreparations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Albany, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for what earthly purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChange of scene,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nAnd my lady, who appeared to have been weeping, gave me the signal to\r\nobey without more parley. She told me a little later (when we found\r\noccasion to exchange some words) that he had suddenly announced his\r\nintention after a visit from Captain Harris, and her best endeavours,\r\nwhether to dissuade him from the journey, or to elicit some explanation\r\nof its purpose, had alike proved unavailing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE JOURNEY IN THE WILDERNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe made a prosperous voyage up that fine river of the Hudson, the\r\nweather grateful, the hills singularly beautified with the colours of\r\nthe autumn. At Albany we had our residence at an inn, where I was not\r\nso blind and my lord not so cunning but what I could see he had some\r\ndesign to hold me prisoner. The work he found for me to do was not so\r\npressing that we should transact it apart from necessary papers in the\r\nchamber of an inn; nor was it of such importance that I should be set\r\nupon as many as four or five scrolls of the same document. I submitted\r\nin appearance; but I took private measures on my own side, and had the\r\nnews of the town communicated to me daily by the politeness of our\r\nhost. In this way I received at last a piece of intelligence for which,\r\nI may say, I had been waiting. Captain Harris (I was told) with \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nMountain, the trader,\xe2\x80\x9d had gone by up the river in a boat. I would have\r\nfeared the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s eye, so strong the sense of some complicity upon\r\nmy master\xe2\x80\x99s part oppressed me. But I made out to say I had some\r\nknowledge of the Captain, although none of Mr. Mountain, and to inquire\r\nwho else was of the party. My informant knew not; Mr. Mountain had come\r\nashore upon some needful purchases; had gone round the town buying,\r\ndrinking, and prating; and it seemed the party went upon some likely\r\nventure, for he had spoken much of great things he would do when he\r\nreturned. No more was known, for none of the rest had come ashore, and\r\nit seemed they were pressed for time to reach a certain spot before the\r\nsnow should fall.\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, the next day, there fell a sprinkle even in Albany;\r\nbut it passed as it came, and was but a reminder of what lay before us.\r\nI thought of it lightly then, knowing so little as I did of that\r\ninclement province: the retrospect is different; and I wonder at times\r\nif some of the horror of these events which I must now rehearse flowed\r\nnot from the foul skies and savage winds to which we were exposed, and\r\nthe agony of cold that we must suffer.\r\n\r\nThe boat having passed by, I thought at first we should have left the\r\ntown. But no such matter. My lord continued his stay in Albany where he\r\nhad no ostensible affairs, and kept me by him, far from my due\r\nemployment, and making a pretence of occupation. It is upon this\r\npassage I expect, and perhaps deserve, censure. I was not so dull but\r\nwhat I had my own thoughts. I could not see the Master entrust himself\r\ninto the hands of Harris, and not suspect some underhand contrivance.\r\nHarris bore a villainous reputation, and he had been tampered with in\r\nprivate by my lord; Mountain, the trader, proved, upon inquiry, to be\r\nanother of the same kidney; the errand they were all gone upon being\r\nthe recovery of ill-gotten treasures, offered in itself a very strong\r\nincentive to foul play; and the character of the country where they\r\njourneyed promised impunity to deeds of blood. Well: it is true I had\r\nall these thoughts and fears, and guesses of the Master\xe2\x80\x99s fate. But you\r\nare to consider I was the same man that sought to dash him from the\r\nbulwarks of a ship in the mid-sea; the same that, a little before, very\r\nimpiously but sincerely offered God a bargain, seeking to hire God to\r\nbe my bravo. It is true again that I had a good deal melted towards our\r\nenemy. But this I always thought of as a weakness of the flesh and even\r\nculpable; my mind remaining steady and quite bent against him. True,\r\nyet again, that it was one thing to assume on my own shoulders the\r\nguilt and danger of a criminal attempt, and another to stand by and see\r\nmy lord imperil and besmirch himself. But this was the very ground of\r\nmy inaction. For (should I anyway stir in the business) I might fail\r\nindeed to save the Master, but I could not miss to make a byword of my\r\nlord.\r\n\r\nThus it was that I did nothing; and upon the same reasons, I am still\r\nstrong to justify my course. We lived meanwhile in Albany, but though\r\nalone together in a strange place, had little traffic beyond formal\r\nsalutations. My lord had carried with him several introductions to\r\nchief people of the town and neighbourhood; others he had before\r\nencountered in New York: with this consequence, that he went much\r\nabroad, and I am sorry to say was altogether too convivial in his\r\nhabits. I was often in bed, but never asleep, when he returned; and\r\nthere was scarce a night when he did not betray the influence of\r\nliquor. By day he would still lay upon me endless tasks, which he\r\nshowed considerable ingenuity to fish up and renew, in the manner of\r\nPenelope\xe2\x80\x99s web. I never refused, as I say, for I was hired to do his\r\nbidding; but I took no pains to keep my penetration under a bushel, and\r\nwould sometimes smile in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I must be the devil and you Michael Scott,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to him one\r\nday. \xe2\x80\x9cI have bridged Tweed and split the Eildons; and now you set me to\r\nthe rope of sand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with shining eyes, and looked away again, his jaw\r\nchewing, but without words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyour will is my pleasure. I will do\r\nthis thing for the fourth time; but I would beg of you to invent\r\nanother task against to-morrow, for by my troth, I am weary of this\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know what you are saying,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my lord, putting on his\r\nhat and turning his back to me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a strange thing you should take\r\na pleasure to annoy me. A friend\xe2\x80\x94but that is a different affair. It is\r\na strange thing. I am a man that has had ill-fortune all my life\r\nthrough. I am still surrounded by contrivances. I am always treading in\r\nplots,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole world is banded against me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not talk wicked nonsense if I were you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will\r\ntell you what I _would_ do\xe2\x80\x94I would put my head in cold water, for you\r\nhad more last night than you could carry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo ye think that?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a manner of interest highly awakened.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould that be good for me? It\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I never tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mind the days when you had no call to try, and I wish, my lord, that\r\nthey were back again,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the plain truth is, if you continue\r\nto exceed, you will do yourself a mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to carry drink the way I used to,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cI get\r\novertaken, Mackellar. But I will be more upon my guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I would ask of you,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to bear in mind\r\nthat you are Mr. Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s father: give the bairn a chance to carry\r\nhis name with some responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99re a very sensible man, Mackellar, and have been\r\nlong in my employ. But I think, if you have nothing more to say to me I\r\nwill be stepping. If you have nothing more to say?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with that\r\nburning, childish eagerness that was now so common with the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lord, I have nothing more,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, dryly enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I think I will be stepping,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, and stood and looked\r\nat me fidgeting with his hat, which he had taken off again. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nyou will have no errands? No? I am to meet Sir William Johnson, but I\r\nwill be more upon my guard.\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent for a time, and then,\r\nsmiling: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you call to mind a place, Mackellar\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a little below\r\nEngles\xe2\x80\x94where the burn runs very deep under a wood of rowans. I mind\r\nbeing there when I was a lad\xe2\x80\x94dear, it comes over me like an old song!\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwas after the fishing, and I made a bonny cast. Eh, but I was happy. I\r\nwonder, Mackellar, why I am never happy now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif you would drink with more moderation you would\r\nhave the better chance. It is an old byword that the bottle is a false\r\nconsoler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cno doubt. Well, I think I will be going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, good-morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and so got himself at last from\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\nI give that for a fair specimen of my lord in the morning; and I must\r\nhave described my patron very ill if the reader does not perceive a\r\nnotable falling off. To behold the man thus fallen: to know him\r\naccepted among his companions for a poor, muddled toper, welcome (if he\r\nwere welcome at all) for the bare consideration of his title; and to\r\nrecall the virtues he had once displayed against such odds of fortune;\r\nwas not this a thing at once to rage and to be humbled at?\r\n\r\nIn his cups, he was more excessive. I will give but the one scene,\r\nclose upon the end, which is strongly marked upon my memory to this\r\nday, and at the time affected me almost with horror.\r\n\r\nI was in bed, lying there awake, when I heard him stumbling on the\r\nstair and singing. My lord had no gift of music, his brother had all\r\nthe graces of the family, so that when I say singing, you are to\r\nunderstand a manner of high, carolling utterance, which was truly\r\nneither speech nor song. Something not unlike is to be heard upon the\r\nlips of children, ere they learn shame; from those of a man grown\r\nelderly, it had a strange effect. He opened the door with noisy\r\nprecaution; peered in, shading his candle; conceived me to slumber;\r\nentered, set his light upon the table, and took off his hat. I saw him\r\nvery plain; a high, feverish exultation appeared to boil in his veins,\r\nand he stood and smiled and smirked upon the candle. Presently he\r\nlifted up his arm, snapped his fingers, and fell to undress. As he did\r\nso, having once more forgot my presence, he took back to his singing;\r\nand now I could hear the words, which were those from the old song of\r\nthe _Twa Corbies_ endlessly repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd over his banes when they are bare\r\nThe wind sall blaw for evermair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said there was no music in the man. His strains had no logical\r\nsuccession except in so far as they inclined a little to the minor\r\nmode; but they exercised a rude potency upon the feelings, and followed\r\nthe words, and signified the feelings of the singer with barbaric\r\nfitness. He took it first in the time and manner of a rant; presently\r\nthis ill-favoured gleefulness abated, he began to dwell upon the notes\r\nmore feelingly, and sank at last into a degree of maudlin pathos that\r\nwas to me scarce bearable. By equal steps, the original briskness of\r\nhis acts declined; and when he was stripped to his breeches, he sat on\r\nthe bedside and fell to whimpering. I know nothing less respectable\r\nthan the tears of drunkenness, and turned my back impatiently on this\r\npoor sight.\r\n\r\nBut he had started himself (I am to suppose) on that slippery descent\r\nof self-pity; on the which, to a man unstrung by old sorrows and recent\r\npotations there is no arrest except exhaustion. His tears continued to\r\nflow, and the man to sit there, three parts naked, in the cold air of\r\nthe chamber. I twitted myself alternately with inhumanity and\r\nsentimental weakness, now half rising in my bed to interfere, now\r\nreading myself lessons of indifference and courting slumber, until,\r\nupon a sudden, the _quantum mutatus ab illo_ shot into my mind; and\r\ncalling to remembrance his old wisdom, constancy, and patience, I was\r\noverborne with a pity almost approaching the passionate, not for my\r\nmaster alone but for the sons of man.\r\n\r\nAt this I leaped from my place, went over to his side and laid a hand\r\non his bare shoulder, which was cold as stone. He uncovered his face\r\nand showed it me all swollen and begrutten [10] like a child\xe2\x80\x99s; and at\r\nthe sight my impatience partially revived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink shame to yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is bairnly conduct. I might\r\nhave been snivelling myself, if I had cared to swill my belly with\r\nwine. But I went to my bed sober like a man. Come: get into yours, and\r\nhave done with this pitiable exhibition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmy heart is wae!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWae?\xe2\x80\x9d cried I. \xe2\x80\x9cFor a good cause, I think. What words were these you\r\nsang as you came in? Show pity to others, we then can talk of pity to\r\nyourself. You can be the one thing or the other, but I will be no party\r\nto half-way houses. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a striker, strike, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nbleater, bleat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCry!\xe2\x80\x9d cries he, with a burst, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94strike! that\xe2\x80\x99s talking! Man,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve stood it all too long. But when they laid a hand upon the child,\r\nwhen the child\xe2\x80\x99s threatened\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his momentary vigour whimpering off\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\nchild, my Alexander!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he was at his tears again.\r\n\r\nI took him by the shoulders and shook him. \xe2\x80\x9cAlexander!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\neven think of him? Not you! Look yourself in the face like a brave man,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99ll find you\xe2\x80\x99re but a self-deceiver. The wife, the friend, the\r\nchild, they\xe2\x80\x99re all equally forgot, and you sunk in a mere log of\r\nselfishness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMackellar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a wonderful return to his old manner and\r\nappearance, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may say what you will of me, but one thing I never\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94I was never selfish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will open your eyes in your despite,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long have we been\r\nhere? and how often have you written to your family? I think this is\r\nthe first time you were ever separate: have you written at all? Do they\r\nknow if you are dead or living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had caught him here too openly; it braced his better nature; there\r\nwas no more weeping, he thanked me very penitently, got to bed and was\r\nsoon fast asleep; and the first thing he did the next morning was to\r\nsit down and begin a letter to my lady: a very tender letter it was\r\ntoo, though it was never finished. Indeed all communication with New\r\nYork was transacted by myself; and it will be judged I had a thankless\r\ntask of it. What to tell my lady and in what words, and how far to be\r\nfalse and how far cruel, was a thing that kept me often from my\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nAll this while, no doubt, my lord waited with growing impatiency for\r\nnews of his accomplices. Harris, it is to be thought, had promised a\r\nhigh degree of expedition; the time was already overpast when word was\r\nto be looked for; and suspense was a very evil counsellor to a man of\r\nan impaired intelligence. My lord\xe2\x80\x99s mind throughout this interval\r\ndwelled almost wholly in the Wilderness, following that party with\r\nwhose deeds he had so much concern. He continually conjured up their\r\ncamps and progresses, the fashion of the country, the perpetration in a\r\nthousand different manners of the same horrid fact, and that consequent\r\nspectacle of the Master\xe2\x80\x99s bones lying scattered in the wind. These\r\nprivate, guilty considerations I would continually observe to peep\r\nforth in the man\xe2\x80\x99s talk, like rabbits from a hill. And it is the less\r\nwonder if the scene of his meditations began to draw him bodily.\r\n\r\n It is well known what pretext he took. Sir William Johnson had a\r\n diplomatic errand in these parts; and my lord and I (from curiosity,\r\n as was given out) went in his company. Sir William was well attended\r\n and liberally supplied. Hunters brought us venison, fish was taken for\r\n us daily in the streams, and brandy ran like water. We proceeded by\r\n day and encamped by night in the military style; sentinels were set\r\n and changed; every man had his named duty; and Sir William was the\r\n spring of all. There was much in this that might at times have\r\n entertained me; but for our misfortune, the weather was extremely\r\n harsh, the days were in the beginning open, but the nights frosty from\r\n the first. A painful keen wind blew most of the time, so that we sat\r\n in the boat with blue fingers, and at night, as we scorched our faces\r\n at the fire, the clothes upon our back appeared to be of paper. A\r\n dreadful solitude surrounded our steps; the land was quite dispeopled,\r\n there was no smoke of fires, and save for a single boat of merchants\r\n on the second day, we met no travellers. The season was indeed late,\r\n but this desertion of the waterways impressed Sir William himself; and\r\n I have heard him more than once express a sense of intimidation. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n have come too late, I fear; they must have dug up the hatchet;\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\n said; and the future proved how justly he had reasoned.\r\n\r\nI could never depict the blackness of my soul upon this journey. I have\r\nnone of those minds that are in love with the unusual: to see the\r\nwinter coming and to lie in the field so far from any house, oppressed\r\nme like a nightmare; it seemed, indeed, a kind of awful braving of\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s power; and this thought, which I daresay only writes me down a\r\ncoward, was greatly exaggerated by my private knowledge of the errand\r\nwe were come upon. I was besides encumbered by my duties to Sir\r\nWilliam, whom it fell upon me to entertain; for my lord was quite sunk\r\ninto a state bordering on _pervigilium_, watching the woods with a rapt\r\neye, sleeping scarce at all, and speaking sometimes not twenty words in\r\na whole day. That which he said was still coherent; but it turned\r\nalmost invariably upon the party for whom he kept his crazy lookout. He\r\nwould tell Sir William often, and always as if it were a new\r\ncommunication, that he had \xe2\x80\x9ca brother somewhere in the woods,\xe2\x80\x9d and beg\r\nthat the sentinels should be directed \xe2\x80\x9cto inquire for him.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nanxious for news of my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say. And sometimes, when we\r\nwere under way, he would fancy he spied a canoe far off upon the water\r\nor a camp on the shore, and exhibit painful agitation. It was\r\nimpossible but Sir William should be struck with these singularities;\r\nand at last he led me aside, and hinted his uneasiness. I touched my\r\nhead and shook it; quite rejoiced to prepare a little testimony against\r\npossible disclosures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in that case,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Sir William, \xe2\x80\x9cis it wise to let him go at\r\nlarge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose that know him best,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9care persuaded that he should be\r\nhumoured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir William, \xe2\x80\x9cit is none of my affairs. But if I\r\nhad understood, you would never have been here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur advance into this savage country had thus uneventfully proceeded\r\nfor about a week, when we encamped for a night at a place where the\r\nriver ran among considerable mountains clothed in wood. The fires were\r\nlighted on a level space at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge; and we supped and lay\r\ndown to sleep in the customary fashion. It chanced the night fell\r\nmurderously cold; the stringency of the frost seized and bit me through\r\nmy coverings so that pain kept me wakeful; and I was afoot again before\r\nthe peep of day, crouching by the fires or trotting to and fro at the\r\nstream\xe2\x80\x99s edge, to combat the aching of my limbs. At last dawn began to\r\nbreak upon hoar woods and mountains, the sleepers rolled in their\r\nrobes, and the boisterous river dashing among spears of ice. I stood\r\nlooking about me, swaddled in my stiff coat of a bull\xe2\x80\x99s fur, and the\r\nbreath smoking from my scorched nostrils, when, upon a sudden, a\r\nsingular, eager cry rang from the borders of the wood. The sentries\r\nanswered it, the sleepers sprang to their feet; one pointed, the rest\r\nfollowed his direction with their eyes, and there, upon the edge of the\r\nforest and betwixt two trees, we beheld the figure of a man reaching\r\nforth his hands like one in ecstasy. The next moment he ran forward,\r\nfell on his knees at the side of the camp, and burst in tears.\r\n\r\nThis was John Mountain, the trader, escaped from the most horrid\r\nperils; and his first word, when he got speech, was to ask if we had\r\nseen Secundra Dass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeen what?\xe2\x80\x9d cries Sir William.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have seen nothing of him. Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mountain. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I was right after all.\xe2\x80\x9d With that he\r\nstruck his palm upon his brow. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what takes him back?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat takes the man back among dead bodies. There is some damned\r\nmystery here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a word which highly aroused our curiosity, but I shall be more\r\nperspicacious, if I narrate these incidents in their true order. Here\r\nfollows a narrative which I have compiled out of three sources, not\r\nvery consistent in all points:\r\n\r\n_First_, a written statement by Mountain, in which everything criminal\r\nis cleverly smuggled out of view;\r\n\r\n_Second_, two conversations with Secundra Dass; and\r\n\r\n_Third_, many conversations with Mountain himself, in which he was\r\npleased to be entirely plain; for the truth is he regarded me as an\r\naccomplice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF THE TRADER, MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crew that went up the river under the joint command of Captain\r\nHarris and the Master numbered in all nine persons, of whom (if I\r\nexcept Secundra Dass) there was not one that had not merited the\r\ngallows. From Harris downward the voyagers were notorious in that\r\ncolony for desperate, bloody-minded miscreants; some were reputed\r\npirates, the most hawkers of rum; all ranters and drinkers; all fit\r\nassociates, embarking together without remorse, upon this treacherous\r\nand murderous design. I could not hear there was much discipline or any\r\nset captain in the gang; but Harris and four others, Mountain himself,\r\ntwo Scotchmen\xe2\x80\x94Pinkerton and Hastie\xe2\x80\x94and a man of the name of Hicks, a\r\ndrunken shoemaker, put their heads together and agreed upon the course.\r\nIn a material sense, they were well enough provided; and the Master in\r\nparticular brought with him a tent where he might enjoy some privacy\r\nand shelter.\r\n\r\nEven this small indulgence told against him in the minds of his\r\ncompanions. But indeed he was in a position so entirely false (and even\r\nridiculous) that all his habit of command and arts of pleasing were\r\nhere thrown away. In the eyes of all, except Secundra Dass, he figured\r\nas a common gull and designated victim; going unconsciously to death;\r\nyet he could not but suppose himself the contriver and the leader of\r\nthe expedition; he could scarce help but so conduct himself and at the\r\nleast hint of authority or condescension, his deceivers would be\r\nlaughing in their sleeves. I was so used to see and to conceive him in\r\na high, authoritative attitude, that when I had conceived his position\r\non this journey, I was pained and could have blushed. How soon he may\r\nhave entertained a first surmise, we cannot know; but it was long, and\r\nthe party had advanced into the Wilderness beyond the reach of any\r\nhelp, ere he was fully awakened to the truth.\r\n\r\nIt fell thus. Harris and some others had drawn apart into the woods for\r\nconsultation, when they were startled by a rustling in the brush. They\r\nwere all accustomed to the arts of Indian warfare, and Mountain had not\r\nonly lived and hunted, but fought and earned some reputation, with the\r\nsavages. He could move in the woods without noise, and follow a trail\r\nlike a hound; and upon the emergence of this alert, he was deputed by\r\nthe rest to plunge into the thicket for intelligence. He was soon\r\nconvinced there was a man in his close neighbourhood, moving with\r\nprecaution but without art among the leaves and branches; and coming\r\nshortly to a place of advantage, he was able to observe Secundra Dass\r\ncrawling briskly off with many backward glances. At this he knew not\r\nwhether to laugh or cry; and his accomplices, when he had returned and\r\nreported, were in much the same dubiety. There was now no danger of an\r\nIndian onslaught; but on the other hand, since Secundra Dass was at the\r\npains to spy upon them, it was highly probable he knew English, and if\r\nhe knew English it was certain the whole of their design was in the\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge. There was one singularity in the position. If\r\nSecundra Dass knew and concealed his knowledge of English, Harris was a\r\nproficient in several of the tongues of India, and as his career in\r\nthat part of the world had been a great deal worse than profligate, he\r\nhad not thought proper to remark upon the circumstance. Each side had\r\nthus a spy-hole on the counsels of the other. The plotters, so soon as\r\nthis advantage was explained, returned to camp; Harris, hearing the\r\nHindustani was once more closeted with his master, crept to the side of\r\nthe tent; and the rest, sitting about the fire with their tobacco,\r\nawaited his report with impatience. When he came at last, his face was\r\nvery black. He had overheard enough to confirm the worst of his\r\nsuspicions. Secundra Dass was a good English scholar; he had been some\r\ndays creeping and listening, the Master was now fully informed of the\r\nconspiracy, and the pair proposed on the morrow to fall out of line at\r\na carrying place and plunge at a venture in the woods: preferring the\r\nfull risk of famine, savage beasts, and savage men to their position in\r\nthe midst of traitors.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was to be done? Some were for killing the Master on the\r\nspot; but Harris assured them that would be a crime without profit,\r\nsince the secret of the treasure must die along with him that buried\r\nit. Others were for desisting at once from the whole enterprise and\r\nmaking for New York; but the appetising name of treasure, and the\r\nthought of the long way they had already travelled dissuaded the\r\nmajority. I imagine they were dull fellows for the most part. Harris,\r\nindeed, had some acquirements, Mountain was no fool, Hastie was an\r\neducated man; but even these had manifestly failed in life, and the\r\nrest were the dregs of colonial rascality. The conclusion they reached,\r\nat least, was more the offspring of greed and hope, than reason. It was\r\nto temporise, to be wary and watch the Master, to be silent and supply\r\nno further aliment to his suspicions, and to depend entirely (as well\r\nas I make out) on the chance that their victim was as greedy, hopeful,\r\nand irrational as themselves, and might, after all, betray his life and\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\nTwice in the course of the next day Secundra and the Master must have\r\nappeared to themselves to have escaped; and twice they were\r\ncircumvented. The Master, save that the second time he grew a little\r\npale, displayed no sign of disappointment, apologised for the stupidity\r\nwith which he had fallen aside, thanked his recapturers as for a\r\nservice, and rejoined the caravan with all his usual gallantry and\r\ncheerfulness of mien and bearing. But it is certain he had smelled a\r\nrat; for from thenceforth he and Secundra spoke only in each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\near, and Harris listened and shivered by the tent in vain. The same\r\nnight it was announced they were to leave the boats and proceed by\r\nfoot, a circumstance which (as it put an end to the confusion of the\r\nportages) greatly lessened the chances of escape.\r\n\r\nAnd now there began between the two sides a silent contest, for life on\r\nthe one hand, for riches on the other. They were now near that quarter\r\nof the desert in which the Master himself must begin to play the part\r\nof guide; and using this for a pretext of persecution, Harris and his\r\nmen sat with him every night about the fire, and laboured to entrap him\r\ninto some admission. If he let slip his secret, he knew well it was the\r\nwarrant for his death; on the other hand, he durst not refuse their\r\nquestions, and must appear to help them to the best of his capacity, or\r\nhe practically published his mistrust. And yet Mountain assures me the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s brow was never ruffled. He sat in the midst of these jackals, his\r\nlife depending by a thread, like some easy, witty householder at home\r\nby his own fire; an answer he had for everything\xe2\x80\x94as often as not, a\r\njesting answer; avoided threats, evaded insults; talked, laughed, and\r\nlistened with an open countenance; and, in short, conducted himself in\r\nsuch a manner as must have disarmed suspicion, and went near to stagger\r\nknowledge. Indeed, Mountain confessed to me they would soon have\r\ndisbelieved the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s story, and supposed their designated victim\r\nstill quite innocent of their designs; but for the fact that he\r\ncontinued (however ingeniously) to give the slip to questions, and the\r\nyet stronger confirmation of his repeated efforts to escape. The last\r\nof these, which brought things to a head, I am now to relate. And first\r\nI should say that by this time the temper of Harris\xe2\x80\x99s companions was\r\nutterly worn out; civility was scarce pretended; and for one very\r\nsignificant circumstance, the Master and Secundra had been (on some\r\npretext) deprived of weapons. On their side, however, the threatened\r\npair kept up the parade of friendship handsomely; Secundra was all\r\nbows, the Master all smiles; and on the last night of the truce he had\r\neven gone so far as to sing for the diversion of the company. It was\r\nobserved that he had also eaten with unusual heartiness, and drank\r\ndeep, doubtless from design.\r\n\r\nAt least, about three in the morning, he came out of the tent into the\r\nopen air, audibly mourning and complaining, with all the manner of a\r\nsufferer from surfeit. For some while, Secundra publicly attended on\r\nhis patron, who at last became more easy, and fell asleep on the frosty\r\nground behind the tent, the Indian returning within. Some time after,\r\nthe sentry was changed; had the Master pointed out to him, where he lay\r\nin what is called a robe of buffalo: and thenceforth kept an eye upon\r\nhim (he declared) without remission. With the first of the dawn, a\r\ndraught of wind came suddenly and blew open one side the corner of the\r\nrobe; and with the same puff, the Master\xe2\x80\x99s hat whirled in the air and\r\nfell some yards away. The sentry thinking it remarkable the sleeper\r\nshould not awaken, thereupon drew near; and the next moment, with a\r\ngreat shout, informed the camp their prisoner was escaped. He had left\r\nbehind his Indian, who (in the first vivacity of the surprise) came\r\nnear to pay the forfeit of his life, and was, in fact, inhumanly\r\nmishandled; but Secundra, in the midst of threats and cruelties, stuck\r\nto it with extraordinary loyalty, that he was quite ignorant of his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s plans, which might indeed be true, and of the manner of his\r\nescape, which was demonstrably false. Nothing was therefore left to the\r\nconspirators but to rely entirely on the skill of Mountain. The night\r\nhad been frosty, the ground quite hard; and the sun was no sooner up\r\nthan a strong thaw set in. It was Mountain\xe2\x80\x99s boast that few men could\r\nhave followed that trail, and still fewer (even of the native Indians)\r\nfound it. The Master had thus a long start before his pursuers had the\r\nscent, and he must have travelled with surprising energy for a\r\npedestrian so unused, since it was near noon before Mountain had a view\r\nof him. At this conjuncture the trader was alone, all his companions\r\nfollowing, at his own request, several hundred yards in the rear; he\r\nknew the Master was unarmed; his heart was besides heated with the\r\nexercise and lust of hunting; and seeing the quarry so close, so\r\ndefenceless, and seeming so fatigued, he vain-gloriously determined to\r\neffect the capture with his single hand. A step or two farther brought\r\nhim to one margin of a little clearing; on the other, with his arms\r\nfolded and his back to a huge stone, the Master sat. It is possible\r\nMountain may have made a rustle, it is certain, at least, the Master\r\nraised his head and gazed directly at that quarter of the thicket where\r\nhis hunter lay; \xe2\x80\x9cI could not be sure he saw me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mountain said; \xe2\x80\x9che\r\njust looked my way like a man with his mind made up, and all the\r\ncourage ran out of me like rum out of a bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d And presently, when\r\nthe Master looked away again, and appeared to resume those meditations\r\nin which he had sat immersed before the trader\xe2\x80\x99s coming, Mountain slunk\r\nstealthily back and returned to seek the help of his companions.\r\n\r\nAnd now began the chapter of surprises, for the scout had scarce\r\ninformed the others of his discovery, and they were yet preparing their\r\nweapons for a rush upon the fugitive, when the man himself appeared in\r\ntheir midst, walking openly and quietly, with his hands behind his\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, men!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, on his beholding them. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is a fortunate\r\nencounter. Let us get back to camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMountain had not mentioned his own weakness or the Master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisconcerting gaze upon the thicket, so that (with all the rest) his\r\nreturn appeared spontaneous. For all that, a hubbub arose; oaths flew,\r\nfists were shaken, and guns pointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us get back to camp,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cI have an explanation to\r\nmake, but it must be laid before you all. And in the meanwhile I would\r\nput up these weapons, one of which might very easily go off and blow\r\naway your hopes of treasure. I would not kill,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ngoose with the golden eggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe charm of his superiority once more triumphed; and the party, in no\r\nparticular order, set off on their return. By the way, he found\r\noccasion to get a word or two apart with Mountain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a clever fellow and a bold,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am not so sure\r\nthat you are doing yourself justice. I would have you to consider\r\nwhether you would not do better, ay, and safer, to serve me instead of\r\nserving so commonplace a rascal as Mr. Harris. Consider of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nconcluded, dealing the man a gentle tap upon the shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe in haste. Dead or alive, you will find me an ill man to quarrel\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they were come back to the camp, where Harris and Pinkerton stood\r\nguard over Secundra, these two ran upon the Master like viragoes, and\r\nwere amazed out of measure when they were bidden by their comrades to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstand back and hear what the gentleman had to say.\xe2\x80\x9d The Master had not\r\nflinched before their onslaught; nor, at this proof of the ground he\r\nhad gained, did he betray the least sufficiency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not let us be in haste,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cMeat first and public speaking\r\nafter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that they made a hasty meal: and as soon as it was done, the\r\nMaster, leaning on one elbow, began his speech. He spoke long,\r\naddressing himself to each except Harris, finding for each (with the\r\nsame exception) some particular flattery. He called them \xe2\x80\x9cbold, honest\r\nblades,\xe2\x80\x9d declared he had never seen a more jovial company, work better\r\ndone, or pains more merrily supported. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9csome one\r\nasks me, Why the devil I ran away? But that is scarce worth answer, for\r\nI think you all know pretty well. But you know only pretty well: that\r\nis a point I shall arrive at presently, and be you ready to remark it\r\nwhen it comes. There is a traitor here: a double traitor: I will give\r\nyou his name before I am done; and let that suffice for now. But here\r\ncomes some other gentleman and asks me, \xe2\x80\x98Why, in the devil, I came\r\nback?\xe2\x80\x99 Well, before I answer that question, I have one to put to you.\r\nIt was this cur here, this Harris, that speaks Hindustani?\xe2\x80\x9d cries he,\r\nrising on one knee and pointing fair at the man\xe2\x80\x99s face, with a gesture\r\nindescribably menacing; and when he had been answered in the\r\naffirmative, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthen are all my suspicions verified, and I\r\ndid rightly to come back. Now, men, hear the truth for the first time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThereupon he launched forth in a long story, told with extraordinary\r\nskill, how he had all along suspected Harris, how he had found the\r\nconfirmation of his fears, and how Harris must have misrepresented what\r\npassed between Secundra and himself. At this point he made a bold\r\nstroke with excellent effect. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou think you are\r\ngoing shares with Harris; I suppose you think you will see to that\r\nyourselves; you would naturally not think so flat a rogue could cozen\r\nyou. But have a care! These half idiots have a sort of cunning, as the\r\nskunk has its stench; and it may be news to you that Harris has taken\r\ncare of himself already. Yes, for him the treasure is all money in the\r\nbargain. You must find it or go starve. But he has been paid\r\nbeforehand; my brother paid him to destroy me; look at him, if you\r\ndoubt\xe2\x80\x94look at him, grinning and gulping, a detected thief!\xe2\x80\x9d Thence,\r\nhaving made this happy impression, he explained how he had escaped, and\r\nthought better of it, and at last concluded to come back, lay the truth\r\nbefore the company, and take his chance with them once more: persuaded\r\nas he was, they would instantly depose Harris and elect some other\r\nleader. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is the whole truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said he: \xe2\x80\x9cand with one exception, I\r\nput myself entirely in your hands. What is the exception? There he\r\nsits,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, pointing once more to Harris; \xe2\x80\x9ca man that has to die!\r\nWeapons and conditions are all one to me; put me face to face with him,\r\nand if you give me nothing but a stick, in five minutes I will show you\r\na sop of broken carrion, fit for dogs to roll in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was dark night when he made an end; they had listened in almost\r\nperfect silence; but the firelight scarce permitted any one to judge,\r\nfrom the look of his neighbours, with what result of persuasion or\r\nconviction. Indeed, the Master had set himself in the brightest place,\r\nand kept his face there, to be the centre of men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes: doubtless on a\r\nprofound calculation. Silence followed for awhile, and presently the\r\nwhole party became involved in disputation: the Master lying on his\r\nback, with his hands knit under his head and one knee flung across the\r\nother, like a person unconcerned in the result. And here, I daresay,\r\nhis bravado carried him too far and prejudiced his case. At least,\r\nafter a cast or two back and forward, opinion settled finally against\r\nhim. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible he hoped to repeat the business of the pirate ship,\r\nand be himself, perhaps, on hard enough conditions, elected leader; and\r\nthings went so far that way, that Mountain actually threw out the\r\nproposition. But the rock he split upon was Hastie. This fellow was not\r\nwell liked, being sour and slow, with an ugly, glowering disposition,\r\nbut he had studied some time for the church at Edinburgh College,\r\nbefore ill conduct had destroyed his prospects, and he now remembered\r\nand applied what he had learned. Indeed he had not proceeded very far,\r\nwhen the Master rolled carelessly upon one side, which was done (in\r\nMountain\xe2\x80\x99s opinion) to conceal the beginnings of despair upon his\r\ncountenance. Hastie dismissed the most of what they had heard as\r\nnothing to the matter: what they wanted was the treasure. All that was\r\nsaid of Harris might be true, and they would have to see to that in\r\ntime. But what had that to do with the treasure? They had heard a vast\r\nof words; but the truth was just this, that Mr. Durie was damnably\r\nfrightened and had several times run off. Here he was\xe2\x80\x94whether caught or\r\ncome back was all one to Hastie: the point was to make an end of the\r\nbusiness. As for the talk of deposing and electing captains, he hoped\r\nthey were all free men and could attend their own affairs. That was\r\ndust flung in their eyes, and so was the proposal to fight Harris. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nshall fight no one in this camp, I can tell him that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hastie. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhad trouble enough to get his arms away from him, and we should look\r\npretty fools to give them back again. But if it\xe2\x80\x99s excitement the\r\ngentleman is after, I can supply him with more than perhaps he cares\r\nabout. For I have no intention to spend the remainder of my life in\r\nthese mountains; already I have been too long; and I propose that he\r\nshould immediately tell us where that treasure is, or else immediately\r\nbe shot. And there,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, producing his weapon, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is the\r\npistol that I mean to use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, I call you a man,\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Master, sitting up and looking at\r\nthe speaker with an air of admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to call me anything,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hastie; \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is it\r\nto be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an idle question,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cNeeds must when the devil\r\ndrives. The truth is we are within easy walk of the place, and I will\r\nshow it you to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, as if all were quite settled, and settled exactly to his\r\nmind, he walked off to his tent, whither Secundra had preceded him.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of these last turns and wriggles of my old enemy except\r\nwith admiration; scarce even pity is mingled with the sentiment, so\r\nstrongly the man supported, so boldly resisted his misfortunes. Even at\r\nthat hour, when he perceived himself quite lost, when he saw he had but\r\neffected an exchange of enemies, and overthrown Harris to set Hastie\r\nup, no sign of weakness appeared in his behaviour, and he withdrew to\r\nhis tent, already determined (I must suppose) upon affronting the\r\nincredible hazard of his last expedient, with the same easy, assured,\r\ngenteel expression and demeanour as he might have left a theatre withal\r\nto join a supper of the wits. But doubtless within, if we could see\r\nthere, his soul trembled.\r\n\r\nEarly in the night, word went about the camp that he was sick; and the\r\nfirst thing the next morning he called Hastie to his side, and inquired\r\nmost anxiously if he had any skill in medicine. As a matter of fact,\r\nthis was a vanity of that fallen divinity student\xe2\x80\x99s, to which he had\r\ncunningly addressed himself. Hastie examined him; and being flattered,\r\nignorant, and highly auspicious, knew not in the least whether the man\r\nwas sick or malingering. In this state he went forth again to his\r\ncompanions; and (as the thing which would give himself most consequence\r\neither way) announced that the patient was in a fair way to die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all that,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with an oath, \xe2\x80\x9cand if he bursts by the\r\nwayside, he must bring us this morning to the treasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut there were several in the camp (Mountain among the number) whom\r\nthis brutality revolted. They would have seen the Master pistolled, or\r\npistolled him themselves, without the smallest sentiment of pity; but\r\nthey seemed to have been touched by his gallant fight and unequivocal\r\ndefeat the night before; perhaps, too, they were even already beginning\r\nto oppose themselves to their new leader: at least, they now declared\r\nthat (if the man was sick) he should have a day\xe2\x80\x99s rest in spite of\r\nHastie\xe2\x80\x99s teeth.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he was manifestly worse, and Hastie himself began to\r\ndisplay something of humane concern, so easily does even the pretence\r\nof doctoring awaken sympathy. The third the Master called Mountain and\r\nHastie to the tent, announced himself to be dying, gave them full\r\nparticulars as to the position of the cache, and begged them to set out\r\nincontinently on the quest, so that they might see if he deceived them,\r\nand (if they were at first unsuccessful) he should be able to correct\r\ntheir error.\r\n\r\nBut here arose a difficulty on which he doubtless counted. None of\r\nthese men would trust another, none would consent to stay behind. On\r\nthe other hand, although the Master seemed extremely low, spoke scarce\r\nabove a whisper, and lay much of the time insensible, it was still\r\npossible it was a fraudulent sickness; and if all went\r\ntreasure-hunting, it might prove they had gone upon a wild-goose chase,\r\nand return to find their prisoner flown. They concluded, therefore, to\r\nhang idling round the camp, alleging sympathy to their reason; and\r\ncertainly, so mingled are our dispositions, several were sincerely (if\r\nnot very deeply) affected by the natural peril of the man whom they\r\ncallously designed to murder. In the afternoon, Hastie was called to\r\nthe bedside to pray: the which (incredible as it must appear) he did\r\nwith unction; about eight at night, the wailing of Secundra announced\r\nthat all was over; and before ten, the Indian, with a link stuck in the\r\nground, was toiling at the grave. Sunrise of next day beheld the\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x99s burial, all hands attending with great decency of demeanour;\r\nand the body was laid in the earth, wrapped in a fur robe, with only\r\nthe face uncovered; which last was of a waxy whiteness, and had the\r\nnostrils plugged according to some Oriental habit of Secundra\xe2\x80\x99s. No\r\nsooner was the grave filled than the lamentations of the Indian once\r\nmore struck concern to every heart; and it appears this gang of\r\nmurderers, so far from resenting his outcries, although both\r\ndistressful and (in such a country) perilous to their own safety,\r\nroughly but kindly endeavoured to console him.\r\n\r\nBut if human nature is even in the worst of men occasionally kind, it\r\nis still, and before all things, greedy; and they soon turned from the\r\nmourner to their own concerns. The cache of the treasure being hard by,\r\nalthough yet unidentified, it was concluded not to break camp; and the\r\nday passed, on the part of the voyagers, in unavailing exploration of\r\nthe woods, Secundra the while lying on his master\xe2\x80\x99s grave. That night\r\nthey placed no sentinel, but lay altogether about the fire, in the\r\ncustomary woodman fashion, the heads outward, like the spokes of a\r\nwheel. Morning found them in the same disposition; only Pinkerton, who\r\nlay on Mountain\xe2\x80\x99s right, between him and Hastie, had (in the hours of\r\ndarkness) been secretly butchered, and there lay, still wrapped as to\r\nhis body in his mantle, but offering above that ungodly and horrific\r\nspectacle of the scalped head. The gang were that morning as pale as a\r\ncompany of phantoms, for the pertinacity of Indian war (or to speak\r\nmore correctly, Indian murder) was well known to all. But they laid the\r\nchief blame on their unsentinelled posture; and fired with the\r\nneighbourhood of the treasure, determined to continue where they were.\r\nPinkerton was buried hard by the Master; the survivors again passed the\r\nday in exploration, and returned in a mingled humour of anxiety and\r\nhope, being partly certain they were now close on the discovery of what\r\nthey sought, and on the other hand (with the return of darkness) were\r\ninfected with the fear of Indians. Mountain was the first sentry; he\r\ndeclares he neither slept nor yet sat down, but kept his watch with a\r\nperpetual and straining vigilance, and it was even with unconcern that\r\n(when he saw by the stars his time was up) he drew near the fire to\r\nawaken his successor. This man (it was Hicks the shoemaker) slept on\r\nthe lee side of the circle, something farther off in consequence than\r\nthose to windward, and in a place darkened by the blowing smoke.\r\nMountain stooped and took him by the shoulder; his hand was at once\r\nsmeared by some adhesive wetness; and (the wind at the moment veering)\r\nthe firelight shone upon the sleeper, and showed him, like Pinkerton,\r\ndead and scalped.\r\n\r\nIt was clear they had fallen in the hands of one of those matchless\r\nIndian bravos, that will sometimes follow a party for days, and in\r\nspite of indefatigable travel, and unsleeping watch, continue to keep\r\nup with their advance, and steal a scalp at every resting-place. Upon\r\nthis discovery, the treasure-seekers, already reduced to a poor half\r\ndozen, fell into mere dismay, seized a few necessaries, and deserting\r\nthe remainder of their goods, fled outright into the forest. Their fire\r\nthey left still burning, and their dead comrade unburied. All day they\r\nceased not to flee, eating by the way, from hand to mouth; and since\r\nthey feared to sleep, continued to advance at random even in the hours\r\nof darkness. But the limit of man\xe2\x80\x99s endurance is soon reached; when\r\nthey rested at last it was to sleep profoundly; and when they woke, it\r\nwas to find that the enemy was still upon their heels, and death and\r\nmutilation had once more lessened and deformed their company.\r\n\r\nBy this they had become light-headed, they had quite missed their path\r\nin the wilderness, their stores were already running low. With the\r\nfurther horrors, it is superfluous that I should swell this narrative,\r\nalready too prolonged. Suffice it to say that when at length a night\r\npassed by innocuous, and they might breathe again in the hope that the\r\nmurderer had at last desisted from pursuit, Mountain and Secundra were\r\nalone. The trader is firmly persuaded their unseen enemy was some\r\nwarrior of his own acquaintance, and that he himself was spared by\r\nfavour. The mercy extended to Secundra he explains on the ground that\r\nthe East Indian was thought to be insane; partly from the fact that,\r\nthrough all the horrors of the flight and while others were casting\r\naway their very food and weapons, Secundra continued to stagger forward\r\nwith a mattock on his shoulder, and partly because, in the last days\r\nand with a great degree of heat and fluency, he perpetually spoke with\r\nhimself in his own language. But he was sane enough when it came to\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think he will be gone quite away?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, upon their blest\r\nawakening in safety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray God so, I believe so, I dare to believe so,\xe2\x80\x9d Mountain had\r\nreplied almost with incoherence, as he described the scene to me.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed he was so much distempered that until he met us, the next\r\nmorning, he could scarce be certain whether he had dreamed, or whether\r\nit was a fact, that Secundra had thereupon turned directly about and\r\nreturned without a word upon their footprints, setting his face for\r\nthese wintry and hungry solitudes, along a path whose every stage was\r\nmile-stoned with a mutilated corpse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTHE JOURNEY IN THE WILDERNESS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nMountain\xe2\x80\x99s story, as it was laid before Sir William Johnson and my\r\nlord, was shorn, of course, of all the earlier particulars, and the\r\nexpedition described to have proceeded uneventfully, until the Master\r\nsickened. But the latter part was very forcibly related, the speaker\r\nvisibly thrilling to his recollections; and our then situation, on the\r\nfringe of the same desert, and the private interests of each, gave him\r\nan audience prepared to share in his emotions. For Mountain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintelligence not only changed the world for my Lord Durrisdeer, but\r\nmaterially affected the designs of Sir William Johnson.\r\n\r\nThese I find I must lay more at length before the reader. Word had\r\nreached Albany of dubious import; it had been rumoured some hostility\r\nwas to be put in act; and the Indian diplomatist had, thereupon, sped\r\ninto the wilderness, even at the approach of winter, to nip that\r\nmischief in the bud. Here, on the borders, he learned that he was come\r\ntoo late; and a difficult choice was thus presented to a man (upon the\r\nwhole) not any more bold than prudent. His standing with the painted\r\nbraves may be compared to that of my Lord President Culloden among the\r\nchiefs of our own Highlanders at the \xe2\x80\x99forty-five; that is as much as to\r\nsay, he was, to these men, reason\xe2\x80\x99s only speaking trumpet, and counsels\r\nof peace and moderation, if they were to prevail at all, must prevail\r\nsingly through his influence. If, then, he should return, the province\r\nmust lie open to all the abominable tragedies of Indian war\xe2\x80\x94the houses\r\nblaze, the wayfarer be cut off, and the men of the woods collect their\r\nusual disgusting spoil of human scalps. On the other side, to go\r\nfarther forth, to risk so small a party deeper in the desert, to carry\r\nwords of peace among warlike savages already rejoicing to return to\r\nwar: here was an extremity from which it was easy to perceive his mind\r\nrevolted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come too late,\xe2\x80\x9d he said more than once, and would fall into a\r\ndeep consideration, his head bowed in his hands, his foot patting the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAt length he raised his face and looked upon us, that is to say upon my\r\nlord, Mountain, and myself, sitting close round a small fire, which had\r\nbeen made for privacy in one corner of the camp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, to be quite frank with you, I find myself in two minds,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it very needful I should go on, but not at all proper I\r\nshould any longer enjoy the pleasure of your company. We are here still\r\nupon the water side; and I think the risk to southward no great matter.\r\nWill not yourself and Mr. Mackellar take a single boat\xe2\x80\x99s crew and\r\nreturn to Albany?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord, I should say, had listened to Mountain\xe2\x80\x99s narrative, regarding\r\nhim throughout with a painful intensity of gaze; and since the tale\r\nconcluded, had sat as in a dream. There was something very daunting in\r\nhis look; something to my eyes not rightly human; the face, lean, and\r\ndark, and aged, the mouth painful, the teeth disclosed in a perpetual\r\nrictus; the eyeball swimming clear of the lids upon a field of\r\nblood-shot white. I could not behold him myself without a jarring\r\nirritation, such as, I believe, is too frequently the uppermost feeling\r\non the sickness of those dear to us. Others, I could not but remark.\r\nwere scarce able to support his neighbourhood\xe2\x80\x94Sir William eviting to be\r\nnear him, Mountain dodging his eye, and, when he met it, blenching and\r\nhalting in his story. At this appeal, however, my lord appeared to\r\nrecover his command upon himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Albany?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a good voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot short of it, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir William. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no safety\r\nnearer hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would be very sweir [11] to return,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not\r\nafraid\xe2\x80\x94of Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a jerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish that I could say so much,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir William, smiling;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9calthough, if any man durst say it, it should be myself. But you are to\r\nkeep in view my responsibility, and that as the voyage has now become\r\nhighly dangerous, and your business\xe2\x80\x94if you ever had any,\xe2\x80\x9d says he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbrought quite to a conclusion by the distressing family intelligence\r\nyou have received, I should be hardly justified if I even suffered you\r\nto proceed, and run the risk of some obloquy if anything regrettable\r\nshould follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord turned to Mountain. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he pretend he died of?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I understand your honour,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trader, pausing like\r\na man very much affected, in the dressing of some cruel frost-bites.\r\n\r\nFor a moment my lord seemed at a full stop; and then, with some\r\nirritation, \xe2\x80\x9cI ask you what he died of. Surely that\xe2\x80\x99s a plain\r\nquestion,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mountain. \xe2\x80\x9cHastie even never knew. He seemed\r\nto sicken natural, and just pass away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d concluded my lord, turning to Sir William.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour lordship is too deep for me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir William.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, \xe2\x80\x9cthis in a matter of succession; my son\xe2\x80\x99s title\r\nmay be called in doubt; and the man being supposed to be dead of nobody\r\ncan tell what, a great deal of suspicion would be naturally roused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, God damn me, the man\xe2\x80\x99s buried!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sir William.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never believe that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my lord, painfully trembling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried again, and jumped to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cDid\r\nhe _look_ dead?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of Mountain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook dead?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the trader. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looked white. Why, what would he\r\nbe at? I tell you, I put the sods upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord caught Sir William by the coat with a hooked hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThis man\r\nhas the name of my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s well understood that he\r\nwas never canny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCanny?\xe2\x80\x9d says Sir William. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not of this world,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered my lord, \xe2\x80\x9cneither him nor the black\r\ndeil that serves him. I have struck my sword throughout his vitals,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried; \xe2\x80\x9cI have felt the hilt dirl [12] on his breastbone, and the hot\r\nblood spirt in my very face, time and again, time and again!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated, with a gesture indescribable. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he was never dead for\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and I sighed aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I think he was dead\r\nnow? No, not till I see him rotting,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\nSir William looked across at me with a long face. Mountain forgot his\r\nwounds, staring and gaping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would collect your spirits.\xe2\x80\x9d But my\r\nthroat was so dry, and my own wits so scattered, I could add no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lord, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not to be supposed that he would understand\r\nme. Mackellar does, for he kens all, and has seen him buried before\r\nnow. This is a very good servant to me, Sir William, this man\r\nMackellar; he buried him with his own hands\xe2\x80\x94he and my father\xe2\x80\x94by the\r\nlight of two siller candlesticks. The other man is a familiar spirit;\r\nhe brought him from Coromandel. I would have told ye this long syne,\r\nSir William, only it was in the family.\xe2\x80\x9d These last remarks he made\r\nwith a kind of a melancholy composure, and his time of aberration\r\nseemed to pass away. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can ask yourself what it all means,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nproceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cMy brother falls sick, and dies, and is buried, as so they\r\nsay; and all seems very plain. But why did the familiar go back? I\r\nthink ye must see for yourself it\xe2\x80\x99s a point that wants some clearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be at your service, my lord, in half a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir\r\nWilliam, rising. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mackellar, two words with you;\xe2\x80\x9d and he led me\r\nwithout the camp, the frost crunching in our steps, the trees standing\r\nat our elbow, hoar with frost, even as on that night in the Long\r\nShrubbery. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, this is midsummer madness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir William, as\r\nsoon as we were gotten out of bearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man is mad. I think that manifest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I seize and bind him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir William. \xe2\x80\x9cI will upon your\r\nauthority. If these are all ravings, that should certainly be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked down upon the ground, back at the camp, with its bright fires\r\nand the folk watching us, and about me on the woods and mountains;\r\nthere was just the one way that I could not look, and that was in Sir\r\nWilliam\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir William,\xe2\x80\x9d said I at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI think my lord not sane, and have long\r\nthought him so. But there are degrees in madness; and whether he should\r\nbe brought under restraint\xe2\x80\x94Sir William, I am no fit judge,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be the judge,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI ask for facts. Was there, in all\r\nthat jargon, any word of truth or sanity? Do you hesitate?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to understand you have buried this gentleman before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot buried,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; and then, taking up courage at last, \xe2\x80\x9cSir\r\nWilliam,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cunless I were to tell you a long story, which much\r\nconcerns a noble family (and myself not in the least), it would be\r\nimpossible to make this matter clear to you. Say the word, and I will\r\ndo it, right or wrong. And, at any rate, I will say so much, that my\r\nlord is not so crazy as he seems. This is a strange matter, into the\r\ntail of which you are unhappily drifted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI desire none of your secrets,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir William; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will be\r\nplain, at the risk of incivility, and confess that I take little\r\npleasure in my present company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would be the last to blame you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cfor that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not asked either for your censure or your praise, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreturned Sir William. \xe2\x80\x9cI desire simply to be quit of you; and to that\r\neffect, I put a boat and complement of men at your disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is fairly offered,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, after reflection. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you must\r\nsuffer me to say a word upon the other side. We have a natural\r\ncuriosity to learn the truth of this affair; I have some of it myself;\r\nmy lord (it is very plain) has but too much. The matter of the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn is enigmatical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so myself,\xe2\x80\x9d Sir William interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cand I propose (since I\r\ngo in that direction) to probe it to the bottom. Whether or not the man\r\nhas gone like a dog to die upon his master\xe2\x80\x99s grave, his life, at least,\r\nis in great danger, and I propose, if I can, to save it. There is\r\nnothing against his character?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, Sir William,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the other?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard my lord, of course; but, from\r\nthe circumstances of his servant\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty, I must suppose he had some\r\nnoble qualities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not ask me that!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cHell may have noble flames. I\r\nhave known him a score of years, and always hated, and always admired,\r\nand always slavishly feared him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI appear to intrude again upon your secrets,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir William,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbelieve me, inadvertently. Enough that I will see the grave, and (if\r\npossible) rescue the Indian. Upon these terms, can you persuade your\r\nmaster to return to Albany?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir William,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you how it is. You do not see my\r\nlord to advantage; it will seem even strange to you that I should love\r\nhim; but I do, and I am not alone. If he goes back to Albany, it must\r\nbe by force, and it will be the death-warrant of his reason, and\r\nperhaps his life. That is my sincere belief; but I am in your hands,\r\nand ready to obey, if you will assume so much responsibility as to\r\ncommand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will have no shred of responsibility; it is my single endeavour to\r\navoid the same,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sir William. \xe2\x80\x9cYou insist upon following this\r\njourney up; and be it so! I wash my hands of the whole matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith which word, he turned upon his heel and gave the order to break\r\ncamp; and my lord, who had been hovering near by, came instantly to my\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is it to be?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to have your way,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see the grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n The situation of the Master\xe2\x80\x99s grave was, between guides, easily\r\n described; it lay, indeed, beside a chief landmark of the wilderness,\r\n a certain range of peaks, conspicuous by their design and altitude,\r\n and the source of many brawling tributaries to that inland sea, Lake\r\n Champlain. It was therefore possible to strike for it direct, instead\r\n of following back the blood-stained trail of the fugitives, and to\r\n cover, in some sixteen hours of march, a distance which their\r\n perturbed wanderings had extended over more than sixty. Our boats we\r\n left under a guard upon the river; it was, indeed, probable we should\r\n return to find them frozen fast; and the small equipment with which we\r\n set forth upon the expedition, included not only an infinity of furs\r\n to protect us from the cold, but an arsenal of snow-shoes to render\r\n travel possible, when the inevitable snow should fall. Considerable\r\n alarm was manifested at our departure; the march was conducted with\r\n soldierly precaution, the camp at night sedulously chosen and\r\n patrolled; and it was a consideration of this sort that arrested us,\r\n the second day, within not many hundred yards of our destination\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n night being already imminent, the spot in which we stood well\r\n qualified to be a strong camp for a party of our numbers; and Sir\r\n William, therefore, on a sudden thought, arresting our advance.\r\n\r\nBefore us was the high range of mountains toward which we had been all\r\nday deviously drawing near. From the first light of the dawn, their\r\nsilver peaks had been the goal of our advance across a tumbled lowland\r\nforest, thrid with rough streams, and strewn with monstrous boulders;\r\nthe peaks (as I say) silver, for already at the higher altitudes the\r\nsnow fell nightly; but the woods and the low ground only breathed upon\r\nwith frost. All day heaven had been charged with ugly vapours, in the\r\nwhich the sun swam and glimmered like a shilling piece; all day the\r\nwind blew on our left cheek barbarous cold, but very pure to breathe.\r\nWith the end of the afternoon, however, the wind fell; the clouds,\r\nbeing no longer reinforced, were scattered or drunk up; the sun set\r\nbehind us with some wintry splendour, and the white brow of the\r\nmountains shared its dying glow.\r\n\r\nIt was dark ere we had supper; we ate in silence, and the meal was\r\nscarce despatched before my lord slunk from the fireside to the margin\r\nof the camp; whither I made haste to follow him. The camp was on high\r\nground, overlooking a frozen lake, perhaps a mile in its longest\r\nmeasurement; all about us, the forest lay in heights and hollows; above\r\nrose the white mountains; and higher yet, the moon rode in a fair sky.\r\nThere was no breath of air; nowhere a twig creaked; and the sounds of\r\nour own camp were hushed and swallowed up in the surrounding stillness.\r\nNow that the sun and the wind were both gone down, it appeared almost\r\nwarm, like a night of July: a singular illusion of the sense, when\r\nearth, air, and water were strained to bursting with the extremity of\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nMy lord (or what I still continued to call by his loved name) stood\r\nwith his elbow in one hand, and his chin sunk in the other, gazing\r\nbefore him on the surface of the wood. My eyes followed his, and rested\r\nalmost pleasantly upon the frosted contexture of the pines, rising in\r\nmoonlit hillocks, or sinking in the shadow of small glens. Hard by, I\r\ntold myself, was the grave of our enemy, now gone where the wicked\r\ncease from troubling, the earth heaped for ever on his once so active\r\nlimbs. I could not but think of him as somehow fortunate to be thus\r\ndone with man\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety and weariness, the daily expense of spirit, and\r\nthat daily river of circumstance to be swum through, at any hazard,\r\nunder the penalty of shame or death. I could not but think how good was\r\nthe end of that long travel; and with that, my mind swung at a tangent\r\nto my lord. For was not my lord dead also? a maimed soldier, looking\r\nvainly for discharge, lingering derided in the line of battle? A kind\r\nman, I remembered him; wise, with a decent pride, a son perhaps too\r\ndutiful, a husband only too loving, one that could suffer and be\r\nsilent, one whose hand I loved to press. Of a sudden, pity caught in my\r\nwindpipe with a sob; I could have wept aloud to remember and behold\r\nhim; and standing thus by his elbow, under the broad moon, I prayed\r\nfervently either that he should be released, or I strengthened to\r\npersist in my affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh God,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthis was the best man to me and to himself, and now\r\nI shrink from him. He did no wrong, or not till he was broke with\r\nsorrows; these are but his honourable wounds that we begin to shrink\r\nfrom. Oh, cover them up, oh, take him away, before we hate him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was still so engaged in my own bosom, when a sound broke suddenly\r\nupon the night. It was neither very loud, nor very near; yet, bursting\r\nas it did from so profound and so prolonged a silence, it startled the\r\ncamp like an alarm of trumpets. Ere I had taken breath, Sir William was\r\nbeside me, the main part of the voyagers clustered at his back,\r\nintently giving ear. Methought, as I glanced at them across my\r\nshoulder, there was a whiteness, other than moonlight, on their cheeks;\r\nand the rays of the moon reflected with a sparkle on the eyes of some,\r\nand the shadows lying black under the brows of others (according as\r\nthey raised or bowed the head to listen) gave to the group a strange\r\nair of animation and anxiety. My lord was to the front, crouching a\r\nlittle forth, his hand raised as for silence: a man turned to stone.\r\nAnd still the sounds continued, breathlessly renewed with a precipitate\r\nrhythm.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mountain spoke in a loud, broken whisper, as of a man\r\nrelieved. \xe2\x80\x9cI have it now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and, as we all turned to hear him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Indian must have known the cache,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is he\xe2\x80\x94he is\r\ndigging out the treasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sir William. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were geese not to have\r\nsupposed so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing is,\xe2\x80\x9d Mountain resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sound is very close to our\r\nold camp. And, again, I do not see how he is there before us, unless\r\nthe man had wings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreed and fear are wings,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Sir William. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this rogue has\r\ngiven us an alert, and I have a notion to return the compliment. What\r\nsay you, gentlemen, shall we have a moonlight hunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was so agreed; dispositions were made to surround Secundra at his\r\ntask; some of Sir William\xe2\x80\x99s Indians hastened in advance; and a strong\r\nguard being left at our headquarters, we set forth along the uneven\r\nbottom of the forest; frost crackling, ice sometimes loudly splitting\r\nunder foot; and overhead the blackness of pine-woods, and the broken\r\nbrightness of the moon. Our way led down into a hollow of the land; and\r\nas we descended, the sounds diminished and had almost died away. Upon\r\nthe other slope it was more open, only dotted with a few pines, and\r\nseveral vast and scattered rocks that made inky shadows in the\r\nmoonlight. Here the sounds began to reach us more distinctly; we could\r\nnow perceive the ring of iron, and more exactly estimate the furious\r\ndegree of haste with which the digger plied his instrument. As we\r\nneared the top of the ascent, a bird or two winged aloft and hovered\r\ndarkly in the moonlight; and the next moment we were gazing through a\r\nfringe of trees upon a singular picture.\r\n\r\nA narrow plateau, overlooked by the white mountains, and encompassed\r\nnearer hand by woods, lay bare to the strong radiance of the moon.\r\nRough goods, such as make the wealth of foresters, were sprinkled here\r\nand there upon the ground in meaningless disarray. About the midst, a\r\ntent stood, silvered with frost: the door open, gaping on the black\r\ninterior. At the one end of this small stage lay what seemed the\r\ntattered remnants of a man. Without doubt we had arrived upon the scene\r\nof Harris\xe2\x80\x99s encampment; there were the goods scattered in the panic of\r\nflight; it was in yon tent the Master breathed his last; and the frozen\r\ncarrion that lay before us was the body of the drunken shoemaker. It\r\nwas always moving to come upon the theatre of any tragic incident; to\r\ncome upon it after so many days, and to find it (in the seclusion of a\r\ndesert) still unchanged, must have impressed the mind of the most\r\ncareless. And yet it was not that which struck us into pillars of\r\nstone; but the sight (which yet we had been half expecting) of Secundra\r\nankle deep in the grave of his late master. He had cast the main part\r\nof his raiment by, yet his frail arms and shoulders glistered in the\r\nmoonlight with a copious sweat; his face was contracted with anxiety\r\nand expectation; his blows resounded on the grave, as thick as sobs;\r\nand behind him, strangely deformed and ink-black upon the frosty\r\nground, the creature\xe2\x80\x99s shadow repeated and parodied his swift\r\ngesticulations. Some night birds arose from the boughs upon our coming,\r\nand then settled back; but Secundra, absorbed in his toil; heard or\r\nheeded not at all.\r\n\r\nI heard Mountain whisper to Sir William, \xe2\x80\x9cGood God! it\xe2\x80\x99s the grave!\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s digging him up!\xe2\x80\x9d It was what we had all guessed, and yet to hear\r\nit put in language thrilled me. Sir William violently started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou damned sacrilegious hound!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSecundra leaped in the air, a little breathless cry escaped him, the\r\ntool flew from his grasp, and he stood one instant staring at the\r\nspeaker. The next, swift as an arrow, he sped for the woods upon the\r\nfarther side; and the next again, throwing up his hands with a violent\r\ngesture of resolution, he had begun already to retrace his steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you come, you help\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying. But by now my lord had\r\nstepped beside Sir William; the moon shone fair upon his face, and the\r\nwords were still upon Secundra\xe2\x80\x99s lips, when he beheld and recognised\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s enemy. \xe2\x80\x9cHim!\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed, clasping his hands, and\r\nshrinking on himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir William. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is none here to do you harm, if\r\nyou be innocent; and if you be guilty, your escape is quite cut off.\r\nSpeak, what do you here among the graves of the dead and the remains of\r\nthe unburied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou no murderer?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Secundra. \xe2\x80\x9cYou true man? you see me safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will see you safe, if you be innocent,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir William. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave said the thing, and I see not wherefore you should doubt it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere all murderers,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Secundra, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is why! He kill\xe2\x80\x94murderer,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npointing to Mountain; \xe2\x80\x9cthere two hire-murderers,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to my lord\r\nand myself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9call gallows\xe2\x80\x94murderers! Ah! I see you all swing in a rope.\r\nNow I go save the sahib; he see you swing in a rope. The sahib,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, pointing to the grave, \xe2\x80\x9che not dead. He bury, he not dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lord uttered a little noise, moved nearer to the grave, and stood\r\nand stared in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuried and not dead?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sir William. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of rant is\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, sahib,\xe2\x80\x9d said Secundra. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sahib and I alone with murderers; try\r\nall way to escape, no way good. Then try this way: good way in warm\r\nclimate, good way in India; here, in this dam cold place, who can tell?\r\nI tell you pretty good hurry: you help, you light a fire, help rub.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the creature talking of?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sir William. \xe2\x80\x9cMy head goes\r\nround.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I bury him alive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Secundra. \xe2\x80\x9cI teach him swallow his\r\ntongue. Now dig him up pretty good hurry, and he not much worse. You\r\nlight a fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir William turned to the nearest of his men. \xe2\x80\x9cLight a fire,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lot seems to be cast with the insane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou good man,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Secundra. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I go dig the sahib up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe returned as he spoke to the grave, and resumed his former toil. My\r\nlord stood rooted, and I at my lord\xe2\x80\x99s side, fearing I knew not what.\r\n\r\nThe frost was not yet very deep, and presently the Indian threw aside\r\nhis tool, and began to scoop the dirt by handfuls. Then he disengaged a\r\ncorner of a buffalo robe; and then I saw hair catch among his fingers:\r\nyet, a moment more, and the moon shone on something white. Awhile\r\nSecundra crouched upon his knees, scraping with delicate fingers,\r\nbreathing with puffed lips; and when he moved aside, I beheld the face\r\nof the Master wholly disengaged. It was deadly white, the eyes closed,\r\nthe ears and nostrils plugged, the cheeks fallen, the nose sharp as if\r\nin death; but for all he had lain so many days under the sod,\r\ncorruption had not approached him, and (what strangely affected all of\r\nus) his lips and chin were mantled with a swarthy beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mountain, \xe2\x80\x9che was as smooth as a baby when we laid him\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say hair grows upon the dead,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Sir William; but his\r\nvoice was thick and weak.\r\n\r\nSecundra paid no heed to our remarks, digging swift as a terrier in the\r\nloose earth. Every moment the form of the Master, swathed in his\r\nbuffalo robe, grew more distinct in the bottom of that shallow trough;\r\nthe moon shining strong, and the shadows of the standers-by, as they\r\ndrew forward and back, falling and flitting over his emergent\r\ncountenance. The sight held us with a horror not before experienced. I\r\ndared not look my lord in the face; but for as long as it lasted, I\r\nnever observed him to draw breath; and a little in the background one\r\nof the men (I know not whom) burst into a kind of sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Secundra, \xe2\x80\x9cyou help me lift him out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf the flight of time, I have no idea; it may have been three hours,\r\nand it may have been five, that the Indian laboured to reanimate his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s body. One thing only I know, that it was still night, and the\r\nmoon was not yet set, although it had sunk low, and now barred the\r\nplateau with long shadows, when Secundra uttered a small cry of\r\nsatisfaction; and, leaning swiftly forth, I thought I could myself\r\nperceive a change upon that icy countenance of the unburied. The next\r\nmoment I beheld his eyelids flutter; the next they rose entirely, and\r\nthe week-old corpse looked me for a moment in the face.\r\n\r\nSo much display of life I can myself swear to. I have heard from others\r\nthat he visibly strove to speak, that his teeth showed in his beard,\r\nand that his brow was contorted as with an agony of pain and effort.\r\nAnd this may have been; I know not, I was otherwise engaged. For at\r\nthat first disclosure of the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, my Lord Durrisdeer fell\r\nto the ground, and when I raised him up, he was a corpse.\r\n\r\n Day came, and still Secundra could not be persuaded to desist from his\r\n unavailing efforts. Sir William, leaving a small party under my\r\n command, proceeded on his embassy with the first light; and still the\r\n Indian rubbed the limbs and breathed in the mouth of the dead body.\r\n You would think such labours might have vitalised a stone; but, except\r\n for that one moment (which was my lord\xe2\x80\x99s death), the black spirit of\r\n the Master held aloof from its discarded clay; and by about the hour\r\n of noon, even the faithful servant was at length convinced. He took it\r\n with unshaken quietude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo cold,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cgood way in India, no good here.\xe2\x80\x9d And, asking for\r\nsome food, which he ravenously devoured as soon as it was set before\r\nhim, he drew near to the fire and took his place at my elbow. In the\r\nsame spot, as soon as he had eaten, he stretched himself out, and fell\r\ninto a childlike slumber, from which I must arouse him, some hours\r\nafterwards, to take his part as one of the mourners at the double\r\nfuneral. It was the same throughout; he seemed to have outlived at once\r\nand with the same effort, his grief for his master and his terror of\r\nmyself and Mountain.\r\n\r\nOne of the men left with me was skilled in stone-cutting; and before\r\nSir William returned to pick us up, I had chiselled on a boulder this\r\ninscription, with a copy of which I may fitly bring my narrative to a\r\nclose:##\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
