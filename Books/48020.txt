Autumn\'s red finger has been lightly\r\nlaid upon the foliage--sparingly, as the artist puts the brighter tints\r\ninto his picture: but the grandeur of an August sunset blazes upon the\r\npeaceful landscape, and lights all into glory.\r\n\r\nThe encircling woods and wide lawn-like meadows, the still ponds of\r\nlimpid water, the trim hedges, and the smooth winding roads; undulating\r\nhill-tops, melting into the purple distance; labouring men\'s cottages\r\ngleaming white from the surrounding foliage; solitary roadside inns\r\nwith brown thatched roofs and moss-grown stacks of lop-sided chimneys;\r\nnoble mansions hiding behind ancestral oaks; tiny Gothic edifices;\r\nSwiss and rustic lodges; pillared gates surmounted by escutcheons hewn\r\nin stone, and festooned with green wreaths of clustering ivy; village\r\nchurches and prim school-houses: every object in the fair English\r\nprospect is steeped in a luminous haze, as the twilight shadows steal\r\nslowly upward from the dim recesses of shady woodland and winding\r\nlane, and every outline of the landscape darkens against the deepening\r\ncrimson of the sky.\r\n\r\nUpon the broad _fa\xe7ade_ of a mighty red-brick mansion, built in the\r\nfavourite style of the early Georgian era, the sinking sun lingers\r\nlong, making gorgeous illumination. The long rows of narrow windows\r\nare all a-flame with the red light, and an honest homeward-tramping\r\nvillager pauses once or twice in the roadway to glance across the\r\nsmooth width of dewy lawn and tranquil lake, half fearful that there\r\nmust be something more than natural in the glitter of those windows,\r\nand that maybe Maister Floyd\'s house is a-fire.\r\n\r\nThe stately red-brick mansion belongs to Maister Floyd, as he is called\r\nin the honest _patois_ of the Kentish rustics; to Archibald Martin\r\nFloyd, of the great banking-house of Floyd, Floyd, and Floyd, Lombard\r\nStreet, City.\r\n\r\nThe Kentish rustics know very little of this City banking-house, for\r\nArchibald Martin, the senior partner, has long retired from any active\r\nshare in the business, which is carried on entirely by his nephews,\r\nAndrew and Alexander Floyd, both steady, middle-aged men, with families\r\nand country houses; both owing their fortune to the rich uncle, who had\r\nfound places in his counting-house for them some thirty years before,\r\nwhen they were tall, raw-boned, sandy-haired, red-complexioned Scottish\r\nyouths, fresh from some unpronounceable village north of Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nThe young gentlemen signed their names McFloyd when they first entered\r\ntheir uncle\'s counting-house; but they very soon followed that wise\r\nrelative\'s example, and dropped the formidable prefix. "We\'ve nae need\r\nto tell these sootherran bodies that we\'re Scotche," Alick remarked\r\nto his brother, as he wrote his name for the first time A. Floyd, all\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish banking-house had thriven wonderfully in the hospitable\r\nEnglish capital. Unprecedented success had waited upon every\r\nenterprise undertaken by the old-established and respected firm of\r\nFloyd, Floyd, and Floyd. It had been Floyd, Floyd, and Floyd for\r\nupwards of a century; for as one member of the house dropped off some\r\ngreener branch shot out from the old tree; and there had never yet\r\nbeen any need to alter the treble repetition of the well-known name\r\nupon the brass plates that adorned the swinging mahogany doors of the\r\nbanking-house. To this brass plate Archibald Martin Floyd pointed when,\r\nsome thirty years before the August evening of which I write, he took\r\nhis raw-boned nephews for the first time across the threshold of his\r\nhouse of business.\r\n\r\n"See there, boys," he said; "look at the three names upon that brass\r\nplate. Your uncle George is over fifty, and a bachelor,--that\'s the\r\nfirst name; our first cousin, Stephen Floyd, of Calcutta, is going to\r\nsell out of the business before long,--that\'s the second name; the\r\nthird is mine, and I\'m thirty-seven years of age, remember, boys, and\r\nnot likely to make a fool of myself by marrying. Your names will be\r\nwanted by-and-by to fill the blanks; see that you keep them bright in\r\nthe mean time; for let so much as one speck rest upon them, and they\'ll\r\nnever be fit for that brass plate."\r\n\r\nPerhaps the rugged Scottish youths took this lesson to heart, or\r\nperhaps honesty was a natural and inborn virtue in the house of Floyd.\r\nBe it as it might, neither Alick nor Andrew disgraced their ancestry;\r\nand when Stephen Floyd, the East-Indian merchant, sold out, and Uncle\r\nGeorge grew tired of business and took to building, as an elderly,\r\nbachelor-like hobby, the young men stepped into their relatives\'\r\nshoes, and took the conduct of the business upon their broad northern\r\nshoulders. Upon one point only Archibald Martin Floyd had misled his\r\nnephews, and that point regarded himself. Ten years after his address\r\nto the young men, at the sober age of seven-and-forty, the banker not\r\nonly made a fool of himself by marrying, but, if indeed such things\r\nare foolish, sank still further from the proud elevation of worldly\r\nwisdom, by falling desperately in love with a beautiful but penniless\r\nwoman, whom he brought home with him after a business-tour through the\r\nmanufacturing districts, and with but little ceremony introduced to\r\nhis relations and the county families round his Kentish estate as his\r\nnewly-wedded wife.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair was so sudden, that these very county families had\r\nscarcely recovered from their surprise at reading a certain paragraph\r\nin the left-hand column of the \'Times,\' announcing the marriage of\r\n"Archibald Martin Floyd, banker, of Lombard Street and Felden Woods,\r\nto Eliza, only surviving daughter of Captain Prodder," when the\r\nbridegroom\'s travelling carriage dashed past the Gothic lodge at his\r\ngates, along the avenue and under the great stone portico at the side\r\nof the house, and Eliza Floyd entered the banker\'s mansion, nodding\r\ngood-naturedly to the bewildered servants, marshalled into the hall to\r\nreceive their new mistress.\r\n\r\nThe banker\'s wife was a tall young woman, of about thirty, with a dark\r\ncomplexion, and great flashing black eyes that lit up a face, which\r\nmight otherwise have been unnoticeable, into the splendour of absolute\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nLet the reader recall one of those faces, whose sole loveliness lies in\r\nthe glorious light of a pair of magnificent eyes, and remember how far\r\nthey surpass all others in their power of fascination. The same amount\r\nof beauty frittered away upon a well-shaped nose, rosy pouting lips,\r\nsymmetrical forehead, and delicate complexion, would make an ordinarily\r\nlovely woman; but concentrated in one nucleus, in the wondrous lustre\r\nof the eyes, it makes a divinity, a Circe. You may meet the first any\r\nday of your life; the second, once in a lifetime.\r\n\r\nMr. Floyd introduced his wife to the neighbouring gentry at a\r\ndinner-party which he gave soon after the lady\'s arrival at Felden\r\nWoods, as his country seat was called; and this ceremony very briefly\r\ndespatched, he said no more about his choice either to his neighbours\r\nor his relations, who would have been very glad to hear how this\r\nunlooked-for marriage had come about, and who hinted the same to the\r\nhappy bridegroom, but without effect.\r\n\r\nOf course this very reticence on the part of Archibald Floyd himself\r\nonly set the thousand tongues of rumour more busily to work. Round\r\nBeckenham and West Wickham, near which villages Felden Woods was\r\nsituated, there was scarcely any one debased and degraded station of\r\nlife from which Mrs. Floyd was not reported to have sprung. She had\r\nbeen a factory-girl, and the silly old banker had seen her in the\r\nstreets of Manchester, with a coloured handkerchief on her head, a\r\ncoral necklace round her throat, and shoeless and stockingless feet\r\ntramping in the mud: he had seen her thus, and had fallen incontinently\r\nin love with her, and offered to marry her there and then. She was an\r\nactress, and he had seen her on the Manchester stage; nay, lower still,\r\nshe was some poor performer, decked in dirty white muslin, red-cotton\r\nvelvet, and spangles, who acted in a canvas booth, with a pitiful set\r\nof wandering vagabonds and a learned pig. Sometimes they said she was\r\nan equestrian, and it was at Astley\'s, and not in the manufacturing\r\ndistricts, that the banker had first seen her; nay, some there were,\r\nready to swear that they themselves had beheld her leaping through\r\ngilded hoops, and dancing the cachuca upon six bare-backed steeds, in\r\nthat sawdust-strewn arena. There were whispered rumours that were more\r\ncruel than these; rumours which I dare not even set down here, for the\r\nbusy tongues that dealt so mercilessly with the name and fame of Eliza\r\nFloyd were not unbarbed by malice. It may be that some of the ladies\r\nhad personal reasons for their spite against the bride, and that many\r\na waning beauty, in those pleasant Kentish mansions, had speculated\r\nupon the banker\'s income, and the advantages attendant upon a union\r\nwith the owner of Felden Woods.\r\n\r\nThe daring, disreputable creature, with not even beauty to recommend\r\nher,--for the Kentish damsels scrupulously ignored Eliza\'s wonderful\r\neyes, and were sternly critical with her low forehead, doubtful nose,\r\nand rather wide mouth,--the artful, designing minx, at the mature age\r\nof nine-and-twenty, with her hair growing nearly down to her eye-brows,\r\nhad contrived to secure to herself the hand and fortune of the richest\r\nman in Kent--the man who had been hitherto so impregnable to every\r\nassault from bright eyes and rosy lips, that the most indefatigable of\r\nmanoeuvring mothers had given him up in despair, and ceased to make\r\nvisionary and Alnaschar-like arrangements of the furniture in Mr.\r\nFloyd\'s great red-brick palace.\r\n\r\nThe female portion of the community wondered indignantly at the\r\nsupineness of the two Scotch nephews, and the old bachelor brother,\r\nGeorge Floyd. Why did not these people show a little spirit--institute\r\na commission of lunacy, and shut their crazy relative in a madhouse?\r\nHe deserved it.\r\n\r\nThe ruined _noblesse_ of the Faubourg St.-Germain could not have\r\nabused a wealthy Bonapartist with more vigorous rancour than these\r\npeople employed in their ceaseless babble about the banker\'s wife.\r\nWhatever she did was a new subject for criticism; even at that first\r\ndinner-party, though Eliza had no more ventured to interfere with the\r\narrangements of the man-cook and housekeeper than if she had been a\r\nvisitor at Buckingham Palace, the angry guests found that everything\r\nhad degenerated since "that woman" had entered the house. They hated\r\nthe successful adventuress,--hated her for her beautiful eyes and her\r\ngorgeous jewels, the extravagant gifts of an adoring husband,--hated\r\nher for her stately figure and graceful movements, which never betrayed\r\nthe rumoured obscurity of her origin,--hated her, above all, for her\r\ninsolence in not appearing in the least afraid of the lofty members of\r\nthat new circle in which she found herself.\r\n\r\nIf she had meekly eaten the ample dish of humble-pie which these county\r\nfamilies were prepared to set before her,--if she had licked the dust\r\nfrom their aristocratic shoes, courted their patronage, and submitted\r\nto be "taken up" by them,--they might perhaps in time have forgiven\r\nher. But she did none of this. If they called upon her, well and good;\r\nshe was frankly and cheerfully glad to see them. They might find her\r\nin her gardening-gloves, with rumpled hair and a watering-pot in her\r\nhands, busy amongst her conservatories; and she would receive them\r\nas serenely as if she had been born in a palace, and accustomed to\r\nhomage from her very babyhood. Let them be as frigidly polite as they\r\npleased, she was always easy, candid, gay, and good-natured. She would\r\nrattle away about her "dear old Archy," as she presumed to call her\r\nbenefactor and husband; or she would show her guests some new picture\r\nhe had bought, and would dare--the impudent, ignorant, pretentious\r\ncreature!--to talk about Art, as if all the high-sounding jargon with\r\nwhich they tried to crush her was as familiar to her as to a Royal\r\nAcademician. When etiquette demanded her returning these stately\r\nvisits, she would drive boldly up to her neighbours\' doors in a tiny\r\nbasket-carriage, drawn by one rough pony; for it was a whim of this\r\ndesigning woman to affect simplicity in her tastes, and to abjure all\r\ndisplay. She would take all the grandeur she met with as a thing of\r\ncourse, and chatter and laugh, with her flaunting theatrical animation,\r\nmuch to the admiration of misguided young men, who could not see the\r\nhigh-bred charms of her detractors, but who were never tired of talking\r\nof Mrs. Floyd\'s jolly manner and glorious eyes.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether poor Eliza Floyd knew all or half the cruel things\r\nthat were said of her! I shrewdly suspect that she contrived somehow or\r\nother to hear them all, and that she rather enjoyed the fun. She had\r\nbeen used to a life of excitement, and Felden Woods might have seemed\r\ndull to her but for these ever fresh scandals. She took a malicious\r\ndelight in the discomfiture of her enemies.\r\n\r\n"How badly they must have wanted you for a husband, Archy," she said,\r\n"when they hate me so ferociously! Poor portionless old maids, to think\r\nthat I should snatch their prey from them! I know they think it a hard\r\nthing that they can\'t have me hanged, for marrying a rich man."\r\n\r\nBut the banker was so deeply wounded when his adored wife repeated\r\nto him the gossip which she had heard from her maid, who was a\r\nstanch adherent to a kind, easy mistress, that Eliza ever afterwards\r\nwithheld these reports from him. They amused her; but they stung him\r\nto the quick. Proud and sensitive, like almost all very honest and\r\nconscientious men, he could not endure that any creature should dare\r\nto befoul the name of the woman he loved so tenderly. What was the\r\nobscurity from which he had taken her to him? Is a star less bright\r\nbecause it shines on a gutter as well as upon the purple bosom of the\r\nmidnight sea? Is a virtuous and generous-hearted woman less worthy\r\nbecause you find her making a scanty living out of the only industry\r\nshe can exercise; and acting Juliet to an audience of factory-hands,\r\nwho give threepence apiece for the privilege of admiring and applauding\r\nher?\r\n\r\nYes, the murder must out; the malicious were not altogether wrong in\r\ntheir conjectures: Eliza Prodder was an actress; and it was on the\r\ndirty boards of a second-rate theatre in Lancashire that the wealthy\r\nbanker had first beheld her. Archibald Floyd nourished a traditional,\r\npassive, but sincere admiration for the British Drama. Yes, the\r\n_British_ Drama; for he had lived in a day when the drama was British,\r\nand when \'George Barnwell\' and \'Jane Shore\' were amongst the favourite\r\nworks of art of a play-going public. How sad that we should have\r\ndegenerated since those classic days, and that the graceful story of\r\nMilwood and her apprentice-admirer is now so rarely set before us!\r\nImbued, therefore, with this admiration for the drama, Mr. Floyd,\r\nstopping for a night at this second-rate Lancashire town, dropped into\r\nthe dusty boxes of the theatre to witness the performance of \'Romeo and\r\nJuliet;\' the heiress of the Capulets being represented by Miss Eliza\r\nPercival, alias Prodder.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that Miss Percival was a good actress, or that she\r\nwould ever have become distinguished in her profession; but she had a\r\ndeep melodious voice, which rolled out the words of her author in a\r\ncertain rich though rather monotonous music, pleasant to hear; and upon\r\nthe stage she was very beautiful to look at, for her face lighted up\r\nthe little theatre better than all the gas that the manager grudged to\r\nhis scanty audiences.\r\n\r\nIt was not the fashion in those days to make "sensation" dramas of\r\nShakespeare\'s plays. There was no \'Hamlet\' with the celebrated\r\nwater-scene, and the Danish prince taking a "header" to save poor\r\nweak-witted Ophelia. In the little Lancashire theatre it would have\r\nbeen thought a terrible sin against all canons of dramatic art, had\r\nOthello or his Ancient attempted to sit down during any part of the\r\nsolemn performance. The hope of Denmark was no long-robed Norseman with\r\nflowing flaxen hair, but an individual who wore a short rusty black,\r\ncotton-velvet garment, shaped like a child\'s frock, and trimmed with\r\nbugles, which dropped off and were trodden upon at intervals throughout\r\nthe performance. The simple actors held, that tragedy, to be tragedy,\r\nmust be utterly unlike anything that had ever happened beneath the sun.\r\nAnd Eliza Prodder patiently trod the old and beaten track, far too\r\ngood-natured, light-hearted, and easy-going a creature to attempt any\r\nfoolish interference with the crookedness of the times, which she was\r\nnot born to set right.\r\n\r\nWhat can I say, then, about her performance of the impassioned Italian\r\ngirl? She wore white satin and spangles, the spangles sewn upon the\r\ndirty hem of her dress, in the firm belief, common to all provincial\r\nactresses, that spangles are an antidote to dirt. She was laughing and\r\ntalking in the white-washed little green-room the very minute before\r\nshe ran on to the stage to wail for her murdered kinsman and her\r\nbanished lover. They tell us that Macready began to be Richelieu at\r\nthree o\'clock in the afternoon, and that it was dangerous to approach\r\nor to speak to him between that hour and the close of the performance.\r\nSo dangerous, indeed, that surely none but the daring and misguided\r\ngentleman who once met the great tragedian in a dark passage, and gave\r\nhim "Good morrow, \'Mac,\'" would have had the temerity to attempt it.\r\nBut Miss Percival did not take her profession very deeply to heart; the\r\nLancashire salaries barely paid for the physical wear and tear of early\r\nrehearsals and long performances; how then, for that mental exhaustion\r\nof the true artist who lives in the character he represents?\r\n\r\nThe easy-going comedians with whom Eliza acted made friendly remarks\r\nto each other on their private affairs in the intervals of the most\r\nvengeful discourse; speculated upon the amount of money in the house\r\nin audible undertones during the pauses of the scene; and when Hamlet\r\nwanted Horatio down at the footlights to ask him if he "marked that,"\r\nit was likely enough that the prince\'s confidant was up the stage\r\ntelling Polonius of the shameful way in which his landlady stole the\r\ntea and sugar.\r\n\r\nIt was not, therefore, Miss Percival\'s acting that fascinated the\r\nbanker. Archibald Floyd knew that she was as bad an actress as ever\r\nplayed the leading tragedy and comedy for five-and-twenty shillings\r\na week. He had seen Miss O\'Neil in that very character, and it moved\r\nhim to a pitying smile as the factory-hands applauded poor Eliza\'s\r\npoison scene. But for all this he fell in love with her. It was a\r\nrepetition of the old story. It was Arthur Pendennis at the little\r\nChatteris theatre bewitched and bewildered by Miss Fotheringay all\r\nover again. Only that instead of a fickle, impressionable boy, it was\r\na sober, steady-going business-man of seven-and-forty, who had never\r\nfelt one thrill of emotion in looking on a woman\'s face until that\r\nnight,--until that night,--and from that night the world only held for\r\nhim one being, and life only had one object. He went the next evening,\r\nand the next; and then contrived to scrape acquaintance with some of\r\nthe actors at a tavern next the theatre. They sponged upon him cruelly,\r\nthese seedy comedians, and allowed him to pay for unlimited glasses of\r\nbrandy-and-water, and flattered and cajoled him, and plucked out the\r\nheart of his mystery; and then went back to Eliza Percival, and told\r\nher that she had dropped into a good thing, for that an old chap with\r\nno end of money had fallen over head and ears in love with her, and\r\nthat if she played her cards well, he would marry her to-morrow. They\r\npointed him out to her through a hole in the green curtain, sitting\r\nalmost alone in the shabby boxes, waiting for the play to begin, and\r\nfor her black eyes to shine upon him once more.\r\n\r\nEliza laughed at her conquest; it was only one amongst many such, which\r\nhad all ended alike,--leading to nothing better than the purchase of a\r\nbox on her benefit night, or a bouquet left for her at the stage-door.\r\nShe did not know the power of first love upon a man of seven-and-forty.\r\nBefore the week was out, Archibald Floyd had made her a solemn offer of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nHe had heard a great deal about her from her fellow-performers, and\r\nhad heard nothing but good. Temptations resisted; insidious proffers\r\nof jewels and gewgaws indignantly declined; graceful acts of gentle\r\nwomanly charity done in secret; independence preserved through all\r\npoverty and trial;--they told him a hundred stories of her goodness,\r\nthat brought the blood to his face with proud and generous emotion.\r\nAnd she herself told him the simple history of her life: told him that\r\nshe was the daughter of a merchant-captain called Prodder; that she\r\nwas born at Liverpool; that she remembered little of her father, who\r\nwas almost always at sea--nor of a brother, three years older than\r\nherself, who quarrelled with his father, the merchant-captain, and ran\r\naway, and was never heard of again--nor of her mother, who died when\r\nshe, Eliza, was four years old. The rest was told in a few words. She\r\nwas taken into the family of an aunt who kept a grocer\'s shop in Miss\r\nProdder\'s native town. She learnt artificial flower-making, and did\r\nnot take to the business. She went often to the Liverpool theatres,\r\nand thought she would like to go upon the stage. Being a daring and\r\nenergetic young person, she left her aunt\'s house one day, walked\r\nstraight to the stage-manager of one of the minor theatres, and asked\r\nhim to let her appear as Lady Macbeth. The man laughed at her, but\r\ntold her that, in consideration of her fine figure and black eyes, he\r\nwould give her fifteen shillings a week to "walk on," as he technically\r\ncalled the business of the ladies who wander on to the stage, sometimes\r\ndressed as villagers, sometimes in court costume of calico trimmed\r\nwith gold, and stare vaguely at whatever may be taking place in the\r\nscene. From "walking on," Eliza came to play minor parts, indignantly\r\nrefused by her superiors; from these she plunged ambitiously into the\r\ntragic lead,--and thus for nine years pursued the even tenour of her\r\nway; until, close upon her nine-and-twentieth birthday, Fate threw the\r\nwealthy banker across her pathway, and in the parish church of a small\r\ntown in the Potteries the black-eyed actress exchanged the name of\r\nProdder for that of Floyd.\r\n\r\nShe had accepted the rich man partly because, moved by a sentiment of\r\ngratitude for the generous ardour of his affection, she was inclined to\r\nlike him better than any one else she knew; and partly in accordance\r\nwith the advice of her theatrical friends, who told her, with more\r\ncandour than elegance, that she would be a jolly fool to let such\r\na chance escape her; but at the time she gave her hand to Archibald\r\nMartin Floyd, she had no idea whatever of the magnitude of the fortune\r\nhe had invited her to share. He told her that he was a banker, and her\r\nactive mind immediately evoked the image of the only banker\'s wife she\r\nhad ever known: a portly lady, who wore silk gowns, lived in a square\r\nstuccoed house with green blinds, kept a cook and housemaid, and took\r\nthree box-tickets for Miss Percival\'s benefit.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the doting husband loaded his handsome bride with\r\ndiamond bracelets and necklaces, and with silks and brocades that were\r\nstiff and unmanageable from their very richness,--when he carried\r\nher straight from the Potteries to the Isle of Wight, and lodged\r\nher in spacious apartments at the best hotel in Ryde, and flung his\r\nmoney here and there, as if he had carried the lamp of Aladdin in his\r\ncoat-pocket,--Eliza remonstrated with her new master, fearing that his\r\nlove had driven him mad, and that this alarming extravagance was the\r\nfirst outburst of insanity.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a repetition of the dear old Burleigh story when Archibald\r\nFloyd took his wife into the long picture-gallery at Felden Woods.\r\nShe clasped her hands for frank womanly joy as she looked at the\r\nmagnificence about her. She compared herself to the humble bride of the\r\nearl, and fell on her knees and did theatrical homage to her lord. "O\r\nArchy," she said, "it is all too good for me! I am afraid I shall die\r\nof my grandeur, as the poor girl pined away at Burleigh House."\r\n\r\nIn the full maturity of womanly loveliness, rich in health, freshness,\r\nand high spirits, how little could Eliza dream that she would hold even\r\na briefer lease of these costly splendours than the Bride of Burleigh\r\nhad done before her!\r\n\r\nNow the reader, being acquainted with Eliza\'s antecedents, may perhaps\r\nfind in them some clue to the insolent ease and well-bred audacity\r\nwith which Mrs. Floyd treated the second-rate county families, who\r\nwere bent upon putting her to confusion. She was an actress: for nine\r\nyears she had lived in that ideal world in which dukes and marquises\r\nare as common as butchers and bakers in work-a-day life; in which,\r\nindeed, a nobleman is generally a poor mean-spirited individual, who\r\ngets the worst of it on every hand, and is contemptuously entreated\r\nby the audience on account of his rank. How should she be abashed on\r\nentering the drawing-rooms of these Kentish mansions, when for nine\r\nyears she had walked nightly on to a stage to be the focus of every\r\neye, and to entertain her guests the evening through? Was it likely\r\nshe was to be over-awed by the Lenfields, who were coachbuilders in\r\nPark Lane, or the Miss Manderlys, whose father had made his money by a\r\npatent for starch,--she, who had received King Duncan at the gates of\r\nher castle, and had sat on a rickety throne dispensing condescending\r\nhospitality to the obsequious Thanes at Dunsinane? So, do what they\r\nwould, they were unable to subdue this base intruder; while, to add\r\nto their mortification, it every day became more obvious that Mr. and\r\nMrs. Floyd made one of the happiest couples who had ever worn the bonds\r\nof matrimony, and changed them into garlands of roses. If this were a\r\nvery romantic story, it would be perhaps only proper for Eliza Floyd\r\nto pine in her gilded bower, and misapply her energies in weeping for\r\nsome abandoned lover, deserted in an evil hour of ambitious madness.\r\nBut as my story is a true one,--not only true in a general sense, but\r\nstrictly true as to the leading facts which I am about to relate,--and\r\nas I could point out, in a certain county, far northward of the lovely\r\nKentish woods, the very house in which the events I shall describe took\r\nplace, I am bound also to be truthful here, and to set down as a fact\r\nthat the love which Eliza Floyd bore for her husband was as pure and\r\nsincere an affection as ever man need hope to win from the generous\r\nheart of a good woman. What share gratitude may have had in that love,\r\nI cannot tell. If she lived in a handsome house, and was waited on by\r\nattentive and deferential servants; if she ate of delicate dishes,\r\nand drank costly wines; if she wore rich dresses and splendid jewels,\r\nand lolled on the downy cushions of a carriage, drawn by high-mettled\r\nhorses, and driven by a coachman with powdered hair; if, wherever she\r\nwent, all outward semblance of homage was paid to her; if she had but\r\nto utter a wish, and, swift as the stroke of some enchanter\'s wand,\r\nthat wish was gratified,--she knew that she owed all to her husband,\r\nArchibald Floyd; and it may be that she grew not unnaturally to\r\nassociate him with every advantage she enjoyed, and to love him for\r\nthe sake of these things. Such a love as this may appear a low and\r\ndespicable affection when compared to the noble sentiment entertained\r\nby the Nancys of modern romance for the Bill Sykeses of their choice;\r\nand no doubt Eliza Floyd ought to have felt a sovereign contempt for\r\nthe man who watched her every whim, who gratified her every caprice,\r\nand who loved and honoured her as much, _ci-devant_ provincial actress\r\nthough she was, as he could have done had she descended the steps of\r\nthe loftiest throne in Christendom to give him her hand.\r\n\r\nShe was grateful to him, she loved him, and she made him perfectly\r\nhappy; so happy that the strong-hearted Scotchman was sometimes almost\r\npanic-stricken at the contemplation of his own prosperity, and would\r\nfall down on his knees and pray that this blessing might not be taken\r\nfrom him; that, if it pleased Providence to afflict him, he might be\r\nstripped of every shilling of his wealth, and left penniless, to begin\r\nthe world anew,--but with her. Alas, it was this blessing, of all\r\nothers, that he was to lose!\r\n\r\nFor a year Eliza and her husband lived this happy life at Felden\r\nWoods. He wished to take her on the Continent, or to London for the\r\nseason; but she could not bear to leave her lovely Kentish home.\r\nShe was happier than the day was long amongst her gardens, and\r\npineries, and graperies, her dogs and horses, and her poor. To these\r\nlast she seemed an angel, descended from the skies to comfort them.\r\nThere were cottages from which the prim daughters of the second-rate\r\ncounty families fled, tract in hand, discomfited and abashed by the\r\nblack looks of the half-starved inmates; but upon whose doorways the\r\nshadow of Mrs. Floyd was as the shadow of a priest in a Catholic\r\ncountry--always sacred, yet ever welcome and familiar. She had the\r\ntrick of making these people like her before she set to work to reform\r\ntheir evil habits. At an early stage of her acquaintance with them,\r\nshe was as blind to the dirt and disorder of their cottages as she\r\nwould have been to a shabby carpet in the drawing-room of a poor\r\nduchess; but by-and-by she would artfully hint at this and that little\r\nimprovement in the _m\xe9nages_ of her pensioners, until in less than\r\na month, without having either lectured or offended, she had worked\r\nan entire transformation. Mrs. Floyd was frightfully artful in her\r\ndealings with these erring peasants. Instead of telling them at once in\r\na candid and Christian-like manner that they were all dirty, degraded,\r\nungrateful, and irreligious, she diplomatized and finessed with them\r\nas if she had been canvassing the county. She made the girls regular in\r\ntheir attendance at church by means of new bonnets and smartly bound\r\nprayer-books; she kept married men out of the public-houses by bribes\r\nof tobacco to smoke at home, and once (oh, horror!) by the gift of a\r\nbottle of gin for moderate and social consumption in the family circle.\r\nShe cured a dirty chimney-piece by the present of a gaudy china vase\r\nto its proprietress, and a slovenly hearth by means of a brass fender.\r\nShe repaired a shrewish temper with a new gown, and patched up a family\r\nbreach of long standing with a chintz waistcoat. But one brief year\r\nafter her marriage,--while busy landscape-gardeners were working at the\r\nimprovements she had planned; while the steady process of reformation\r\nwas slowly but surely progressing amongst the grateful recipients of\r\nher bounty; while the eager tongues of her detractors were still waging\r\nwar upon her fair fame; while Archibald Floyd rejoiced as he held a\r\nbaby-daughter in his arms,--without one forewarning symptom to break\r\nthe force of the blow, the light slowly faded out of those glorious\r\neyes, never to shine again on this side of eternity, and Archibald\r\nMartin Floyd was a widower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nAURORA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe child which Eliza Floyd left behind her, when she was so suddenly\r\ntaken away from all earthly prosperity and happiness, was christened\r\nAurora. The romantic-sounding name had been a fancy of poor Eliza\'s;\r\nand there was no caprice of hers, however trifling, that had not\r\nalways been sacred with her adoring husband, and that was not doubly\r\nsacred now. The actual intensity of the widower\'s grief was known to\r\nno creature in this lower world. His nephews and his nephews\' wives\r\npaid him pertinacious visits of condolence; nay, one of these nieces by\r\nmarriage, a good motherly creature, devoted to her husband, insisted\r\non seeing and comforting the stricken man. Heaven knows whether her\r\ntenderness did convey any comfort to that shipwrecked soul! She found\r\nhim like a man who had suffered from a stroke of paralysis, torpid,\r\nalmost imbecile. Perhaps she took the wisest course that could possibly\r\nhave been taken. She said little to him upon the subject of his\r\naffliction; but visited him frequently, patiently sitting opposite\r\nto him for hours at a time, he and she talking of all manner of easy\r\nconventional topics,--the state of the country, the weather, a change\r\nin the ministry, and such subjects as were so far remote from the grief\r\nof his life, that a less careful hand than Mrs. Alexander Floyd\'s could\r\nhave scarcely touched upon the broken chords of that ruined instrument,\r\nthe widower\'s heart.\r\n\r\nIt was not until six months after Eliza\'s death that Mrs. Alexander\r\nventured to utter her name; but when she did speak of her, it was with\r\nno solemn hesitation, but tenderly and familiarly, as if she had been\r\naccustomed to talk of the dead. She saw at once that she had done\r\nright. The time had come for the widower to feel relief in speaking of\r\nthe lost one; and from that hour Mrs. Alexander became a favourite with\r\nher uncle. Years after, he told her that, even in the sullen torpor of\r\nhis grief, he had had a dim consciousness that she pitied him, and that\r\nshe was "a good woman." This good woman came that very evening into\r\nthe big room, where the banker sat by his lonely hearth, with a baby in\r\nher arms,--a pale-faced child, with great wondering black eyes, which\r\nstared at the rich man in sombre astonishment; a solemn-faced, ugly\r\nbaby, which was to grow by-and-by into Aurora Floyd, the heroine of my\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nThat pale, black-eyed baby became henceforth the idol of Archibald\r\nMartin Floyd, the one object in all this wide universe for which it\r\nseemed worth his while to endure life. From the day of his wife\'s death\r\nhe had abandoned all active share in the Lombard-Street business, and\r\nhe had now neither occupation nor delight, save in waiting upon the\r\nprattlings and humouring the caprices of this infant daughter. His love\r\nfor her was a weakness, almost verging upon a madness. Had his nephews\r\nbeen very designing men, they might perhaps have entertained some vague\r\nideas of that commission of lunacy for which the outraged neighbours\r\nwere so anxious. He grudged the hired nurses their offices of love\r\nabout the person of his child. He watched them furtively, fearful lest\r\nthey should be harsh with her. All the ponderous doors in the great\r\nhouse at Felden Woods could not drown the feeblest murmur of that\r\ninfant voice to those ever-anxious, loving ears.\r\n\r\nHe watched her growth as a child watches an acorn it hopes to rear to\r\nan oak. He repeated her broken baby-syllables till people grew weary of\r\nhis babble about the child. Of course the end of all this was, that, in\r\nthe common acceptation of the term, Aurora was spoiled. We do not say a\r\nflower is spoiled because it is reared in a hot-house where no breath\r\nof heaven can visit it too roughly; but then, certainly, the bright\r\nexotic is trimmed and pruned by the gardener\'s merciless hand, while\r\nAurora shot whither she would, and there was none to lop the wandering\r\nbranches of that luxuriant nature. She said what she pleased; thought,\r\nspoke, acted as she pleased; learned what she pleased; and she grew\r\ninto a bright impetuous being, affectionate and generous-hearted as her\r\nmother, but with some touch of native fire blended in her mould that\r\nstamped her as original. It is the common habit of ugly babies to grow\r\ninto handsome women, and so it was with Aurora Floyd. At seventeen she\r\nwas twice as beautiful as her mother had been at nine-and-twenty, but\r\nwith much the same irregular features, lighted up by a pair of eyes\r\nthat were like the stars of heaven, and by two rows of peerlessly white\r\nteeth. You rarely, in looking at her face, could get beyond these eyes\r\nand teeth; for they so dazzled and blinded you that they defied you\r\nto criticise the doubtful little nose, or the width of the smiling\r\nmouth. What if those masses of blue-black hair were brushed away from\r\na forehead too low for the common standard of beauty? A phrenologist\r\nwould have told you that the head was a noble one; and a sculptor would\r\nhave added that it was set upon the throat of a Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nMiss Floyd knew very little of her poor mother\'s history. There was\r\na picture in crayons hanging in the banker\'s sanctum sanctorum which\r\nrepresented Eliza in the full flush of her beauty and prosperity; but\r\nthe portrait told nothing of the history of its original, and Aurora\r\nhad never heard of the merchant-captain, the poor Liverpool lodging,\r\nthe grim aunt who kept a chandler\'s shop, the artificial flower-making,\r\nand the provincial stage. She had never been told that her maternal\r\ngrandfather\'s name was Prodder, and that her mother had played Juliet\r\nto an audience of factory hands, for the moderate and sometimes\r\nuncertain stipend of four-and-twopence a night. The county families\r\naccepted and made much of the rich banker\'s heiress; but they were\r\nnot slow to say that Aurora was her mother\'s own daughter, and had\r\nthe taint of the play-acting and horse-riding, the spangles and the\r\nsawdust, strong in her nature. The truth of the matter is, that before\r\nMiss Floyd emerged from the nursery she evinced a very decided tendency\r\nto become what is called "fast." At six years of age she rejected\r\na doll, and asked for a rocking-horse. At ten she could converse\r\nfluently upon the subject of pointers, setters, fox-hounds, harriers,\r\nand beagles, though she drove her governess to the verge of despair\r\nby persistently forgetting under what Roman emperor Jerusalem was\r\ndestroyed, and who was legate from the Pope at the time of Catherine\r\nof Arragon\'s divorce. At eleven she talked unreservedly of the horses\r\nin the Lenfield stables as a pack of screws; at twelve she contributed\r\nher half-crown to a Derby sweepstakes amongst her father\'s servants,\r\nand triumphantly drew the winning horse; and at thirteen she rode\r\nacross country with her cousin Andrew, who was a member of the Croydon\r\nhunt. It was not without grief that the banker watched his daughter\'s\r\nprogress in these doubtful accomplishments; but she was so beautiful,\r\nso frank and fearless, so generous, affectionate, and true, that he\r\ncould not bring himself to tell her that she was not all he could\r\ndesire her to be. If he could have governed or directed that impetuous\r\nnature, he would have had her the most refined and elegant, the most\r\nperfect and accomplished of her sex; but he could not do this, and he\r\nwas fain to thank God for her as she was, and to indulge her every whim.\r\n\r\nAlexander Floyd\'s eldest daughter, Lucy, first cousin, once removed,\r\nto Aurora, was that young lady\'s friend and confidante, and came now\r\nand then from her father\'s villa at Fulham to spend a month at Felden\r\nWoods. But Lucy Floyd had half a dozen brothers and sisters, and\r\nwas brought up in a very different manner to the heiress. She was a\r\nfair-faced, blue-eyed, rosy-lipped, golden-haired little girl, who\r\nthought Felden Woods a paradise upon earth, and Aurora more fortunate\r\nthan the Princess Royal of England, or Titania, Queen of the Fairies.\r\nShe was direfully afraid of her cousin\'s ponies and Newfoundland dogs,\r\nand had a firm conviction that sudden death held his throne within a\r\ncertain radius of a horse\'s heels; but she loved and admired Aurora,\r\nafter the manner common to these weaker natures, and accepted Miss\r\nFloyd\'s superb patronage and protection as a thing of course.\r\n\r\nThe day came when some dark but undefined cloud hovered about the\r\nnarrow home-circle at Felden Woods. There was a coolness between the\r\nbanker and his beloved child. The young lady spent half her time on\r\nhorseback, scouring the shady lanes round Beckenham, attended only by\r\nher groom--a dashing young fellow, chosen by Mr. Floyd on account of\r\nhis good looks for Aurora\'s especial service. She dined in her own room\r\nafter these long, lonely rides, leaving her father to eat his solitary\r\nmeal in the vast dining-room, which seemed to be fully occupied when\r\nshe sat in it, and desolately empty without her. The household at\r\nFelden Woods long remembered one particular June evening on which the\r\nstorm burst forth between the father and daughter.\r\n\r\nAurora had been absent from two o\'clock in the afternoon until\r\nsunset, and the banker paced the long stone terrace with his watch\r\nin his hand, the figures on the dial-plate barely distinguishable\r\nin the twilight, waiting for his daughter\'s coming home. He had sent\r\nhis dinner away untouched; his newspapers lay uncut upon the table,\r\nand the household spies, we call servants, told each other how his\r\nhand had shaken so violently that he had spilled half a decanter of\r\nwine over the polished mahogany in attempting to fill his glass. The\r\nhousekeeper and her satellites crept into the hall, and looked through\r\nthe half-glass doors at the anxious watcher on the terrace. The men in\r\nthe stables talked of "the row," as they called this terrible breach\r\nbetween father and child; and when at last horses\' hoofs were heard in\r\nthe long avenue, and Miss Floyd reined in her thorough-bred chestnut at\r\nthe foot of the terrace-steps, there was a lurking audience hidden here\r\nand there in the evening shadow, eager to hear and see.\r\n\r\nBut there was very little to gratify these prying eyes and ears. Aurora\r\nsprang lightly to the ground before the groom could dismount to assist\r\nher, and the chestnut, with heaving and foam-flecked sides, was led off\r\nto the stable.\r\n\r\nMr. Floyd watched the groom and the two horses as they disappeared\r\nthrough the great gates leading to the stable-yard, and then said very\r\nquietly, "You don\'t use that animal well, Aurora. A six hours\' ride is\r\nneither good for her nor for you. Your groom should have known better\r\nthan to allow it." He led the way into his study, telling his daughter\r\nto follow him, and they were closeted together for upwards of an hour.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Miss Floyd\'s governess departed from Felden\r\nWoods, and between breakfast and luncheon the banker paid a visit to\r\nthe stables, and examined his daughter\'s favourite chestnut mare, a\r\nbeautiful filly all bone and muscle, that had been trained for a racer.\r\nThe animal had strained a sinew, and walked lame. Mr. Floyd sent for\r\nhis daughter\'s groom, and paid and dismissed him on the spot. The young\r\nfellow made no remonstrance, but went quietly to his quarters, took off\r\nhis livery, packed a carpet-bag, and walked away from the house without\r\nbidding good-bye to his fellow-servants, who resented the affront, and\r\npronounced him a surly brute who had always been too high for this\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThree days after this, upon the 14th of June, 1856, Mr. Floyd and his\r\ndaughter left Felden Woods for Paris, where Aurora was placed at a\r\nvery expensive and exclusive Protestant finishing school, kept by the\r\nDemoiselles Lespard, in a stately mansion _entre cour et jardin_ in the\r\nRue Saint-Dominique, there to complete her very imperfect education.\r\n\r\nFor a year and two months Miss Floyd has been away at this Parisian\r\nfinishing school; it is late in the August of 1857, and again the\r\nbanker walks upon the long stone terrace in front of the narrow windows\r\nof his red-brick mansion, this time waiting for Aurora\'s arrival from\r\nParis. The servants have expressed considerable wonder at his not\r\ncrossing the Channel to fetch his daughter, and they think the dignity\r\nof the house somewhat lowered by Miss Floyd travelling unattended.\r\n\r\n"A poor dear young thing, that knows no more of this wicked world than\r\na blessed baby," said the housekeeper, "all alone amongst a pack of\r\nmoustachioed Frenchmen!"\r\n\r\nArchibald Martin Floyd had grown an old man in one day--that terrible\r\nand unexpected day of his wife\'s death; but even the grief of that\r\nbereavement had scarcely seemed to affect him so strongly as the loss\r\nof his daughter Aurora during the fourteen months of her absence from\r\nFelden Woods.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was that at sixty-five years of age he was less able to bear\r\neven a lesser grief; but those who watched him closely, declared that\r\nhe seemed as much dejected by his daughter\'s absence as he could well\r\nhave been by her death. Even now, that he paces up and down the broad\r\nterrace, with the landscape stretching wide before him, and melting\r\nvaguely away under that veil of crimson glory shed upon all things by\r\nthe sinking sun; even now that he hourly, nay, almost momentarily,\r\nexpects to clasp his only child in his arms, Archibald Floyd seems\r\nrather nervously anxious than joyfully expectant.\r\n\r\nHe looks again and again at his watch, and pauses in his walk to listen\r\nto Beckenham church clock striking eight; his ears are preternaturally\r\nalert to every sound, and give him instant warning of carriage-wheels\r\nfar off upon the wide high-road. All the agitation and anxiety he\r\nhas felt for the last week has been less than the concentrated fever\r\nof this moment. Will it pass on, that carriage, or stop at the\r\nlodge-gates? Surely his heart could never beat so loud save by some\r\nwondrous magnetism of fatherly love and hope. The carriage stops. He\r\nhears the clanking of the gates; the crimson-tinted landscape grows\r\ndim and blurred before his eyes, and he knows no more till a pair of\r\nimpetuous arms are twined about his neck, and Aurora\'s face is hidden\r\non his shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was a paltry hired carriage which Miss Floyd arrived in, and it\r\ndrove away as soon as she had alighted, and the small amount of luggage\r\nshe brought had been handed to the eager servants. The banker led his\r\nchild into the study, where they had held that long conference fourteen\r\nmonths before. A lamp burned upon the library table, and it was to this\r\nlight that Archibald Floyd led his daughter.\r\n\r\nA year had changed the girl to a woman--a woman with great hollow black\r\neyes, and pale haggard cheeks. The course of study at the Parisian\r\nfinishing school had evidently been too hard for the spoiled heiress.\r\n\r\n"Aurora, Aurora," the old man cried piteously, "how ill you look! how\r\naltered! how----"\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand lightly yet imperiously upon his lips.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak of me," she said, "I shall recover; but you--you,\r\nfather--you too are changed."\r\n\r\nShe was as tall as her father, and, resting her hands upon his\r\nshoulders, she looked at him long and earnestly. As she looked, the\r\ntears welled slowly up to her eyes which had been dry before, and\r\npoured silently down her haggard cheeks.\r\n\r\n"My father, my devoted father," she said in a broken voice, "if my\r\nheart was made of adamant, I think it might break when I see the change\r\nin this beloved face."\r\n\r\nThe old man checked her with a nervous gesture, a gesture almost of\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n"Not one word, not one word, Aurora," he said hurriedly; "at least,\r\nonly one. That person--he is dead?"\r\n\r\n"He is."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT BECAME OF THE DIAMOND BRACELET.\r\n\r\n\r\nAurora\'s relatives were not slow to exclaim upon the change for the\r\nworse which a twelvemonth in Paris had made in their young kinswoman. I\r\nfear that the Demoiselles Lespard suffered considerably in reputation\r\namongst the circle round Felden Woods from Miss Floyd\'s impaired good\r\nlooks. She was out of spirits too, had no appetite, slept badly, was\r\nnervous and hysterical, no longer took any interest in her dogs and\r\nhorses, and was altogether an altered creature. Mrs. Alexander Floyd\r\ndeclared it was perfectly clear that these cruel Frenchwomen had worked\r\npoor Aurora to a shadow: the girl was not used to study, she said; she\r\nhad been accustomed to exercise and open air, and no doubt had pined\r\nsadly in the close atmosphere of a schoolroom.\r\n\r\nBut Aurora\'s was one of those impressionable natures which quickly\r\nrecover from any depressing influence. Early in September Lucy Floyd\r\ncame to Felden Woods, and found her handsome cousin almost entirely\r\nrecovered from the drudgery of the Parisian _pension_, but still\r\nvery loth to talk much of that seminary. She answered Lucy\'s eager\r\nquestions very curtly; said that she hated the Demoiselles Lespard\r\nand the Rue Saint-Dominique, and that the very memory of Paris was\r\ndisagreeable to her. Like most young ladies with black eyes and\r\nblue-black hair, Miss Floyd was a good hater; so Lucy forbore to ask\r\nfor more information upon what was so evidently an unpleasant subject\r\nto her cousin. Poor Lucy had been mercilessly well educated; she spoke\r\nhalf a dozen languages, knew all about the natural sciences, had read\r\nGibbon, Niebuhr, and Arnold, from the title-page to the printer\'s name,\r\nand looked upon the heiress as a big brilliant dunce; so she quietly\r\nset down Aurora\'s dislike to Paris to that young lady\'s distaste for\r\ntuition, and thought little more about it. Any other reasons for Miss\r\nFloyd\'s almost shuddering horror of her Parisian associations lay far\r\nbeyond Lucy\'s simple power of penetration.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth of September was Aurora\'s birthday, and Archibald Floyd\r\ndetermined upon this, the nineteenth anniversary of his daughter\'s\r\nfirst appearance on this mortal scene, to give an entertainment,\r\nwhereat his county neighbours and town acquaintance might alike behold\r\nand admire the beautiful heiress.\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander came to Felden Woods to superintend the preparations for\r\nthis birthday ball. She drove Aurora and Lucy into town to order the\r\nsupper and the band, and to choose dresses and wreaths for the young\r\nladies. The banker\'s heiress was sadly out of place in a milliner\'s\r\nshowroom; but she had that rapid judgment as to colour, and that\r\nperfect taste in form, which bespeak the soul of an artist; and while\r\npoor mild Lucy was giving endless trouble, and tumbling innumerable\r\nboxes of flowers, before she could find any head-dress in harmony with\r\nher rosy cheeks and golden hair, Aurora, after one brief glance at the\r\nbright _parterres_ of painted cambric, pounced upon a crown-shaped\r\ngarland of vivid scarlet berries, with drooping and tangled leaves\r\nof dark shining green, that looked as if they had been just plucked\r\nfrom a running streamlet. She watched Lucy\'s perplexities with a\r\nhalf-compassionate, half-contemptuous smile.\r\n\r\n"Look at that poor bewildered child," she said; "I know that she would\r\nlike to put pink and yellow against her golden hair. Why, you silly\r\nLucy, don\'t you know that yours is the beauty which really does _not_\r\nwant adornment? A few pearls or forget-me-not blossoms, or a crown\r\nof water-lilies and a cloud of white areophane, would make you look\r\na sylphide; but I dare say you would like to wear amber satin and\r\ncabbage-roses."\r\n\r\nFrom the milliner\'s they drove to Mr. Gunter\'s in Berkeley Square,\r\nat which world-renowned establishment Mrs. Alexander commanded those\r\npreparations of turkeys preserved in jelly, hams cunningly embalmed\r\nin rich wines and broths, and other specimens of that sublime art of\r\nconfectionery which hovers midway between sleight-of-hand and cookery,\r\nand in which the Berkeley Square professor is without a rival. When\r\npoor Thomas Babington Macaulay\'s New-Zealander shall come to ponder\r\nover the ruins of St. Paul\'s, perhaps he will visit the remains of this\r\nhumbler temple in Berkeley Square, and wonder at the ice-pails and\r\njelly-moulds, the refrigerators and stewpans, the hot plates long cold\r\nand unheeded, and all the mysterious paraphernalia of the dead art.\r\n\r\nFrom the West End Mrs. Alexander drove to Charing Cross; she had a\r\ncommission to execute at Dent\'s,--the purchase of a watch for one of\r\nher boys, who was just off to Eton.\r\n\r\nAurora threw herself wearily back in the carriage while Mrs. Alexander\r\nand Lucy stopped at the watchmaker\'s. It was to be observed that,\r\nalthough Miss Floyd had recovered much of her old brilliancy and\r\ngaiety of temper, a certain gloomy shade would sometimes steal over\r\nher countenance when she was left to herself for a few minutes; a\r\ndarkly reflective expression quite foreign to her face. This shadow\r\nfell upon her beauty now as she looked out of the open window, moodily\r\nwatching the passers-by. Mrs. Alexander was a long time making her\r\npurchase; and Aurora had sat nearly a quarter of an hour blankly\r\nstaring at the shifting figures in the crowd, when a man hurrying by\r\nwas attracted by her face at the carriage window, and started, as if\r\nat some great surprise. He passed on, however, and walked rapidly\r\ntowards the Horse Guards; but before he turned the corner, came to a\r\ndead stop, stood still for two or three minutes scratching the back\r\nof his head reflectively with his big, bare hand, and then walked\r\nslowly back towards Mr. Dent\'s emporium. He was a broad-shouldered,\r\nbull-necked, sandy-whiskered fellow, wearing a cut-away coat and a\r\ngaudy neckerchief, and smoking a huge cigar, the rank fumes of which\r\nstruggled with a very powerful odour of rum-and-water recently imbibed.\r\nThis gentleman\'s standing in society was betrayed by the smooth head\r\nof a bull-terrier, whose round eyes peeped out of the pocket of his\r\ncut-away coat, and by a Blenheim spaniel carried under his arm. He was\r\nthe very last person, amongst all the souls between Cockspur Street and\r\nthe statue of King Charles, who seemed likely to have anything to say\r\nto Miss Aurora Floyd; nevertheless he walked deliberately up to the\r\ncarriage, and, planting his elbows upon the door, nodded to her with\r\nfriendly familiarity.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, without inconveniencing himself by the removal of the\r\nrank cigar, "how do?"\r\n\r\nAfter which brief salutation he relapsed into silence, and rolled his\r\ngreat brown eyes slowly here and there, in contemplative examination of\r\nMiss Floyd and the vehicle in which she sat; even carrying his powers\r\nof observation so far as to take particular notice of a plethoric\r\nmorocco-bag lying on the back seat, and to inquire casually whether\r\nthere was "anythink wallable in the old party\'s redicule?"\r\n\r\nBut Aurora did not allow him long for this leisurely employment; for\r\nlooking at him with her eyes flashing forked lightnings of womanly\r\nfury, and her face crimson with indignation, she asked him in a sharp\r\nspasmodic tone whether he had anything to say to her.\r\n\r\nHe had a great deal to say to her; but as he put his head in at the\r\ncarriage window and made his communication, whatever it might be,\r\nin a rum-and-watery whisper, it reached no ears but those of Aurora\r\nherself. When he had done whispering, he took a greasy leather-covered\r\naccount-book, and a short stump of lead-pencil, considerably the worse\r\nfor chewing, from his breast pocket, and wrote two or three lines upon\r\na leaf, which he tore out and handed to Aurora. "This is the address,"\r\nhe said; "you won\'t forget to send?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and looked away from him--looked away with an\r\nirrepressible gesture of disgust and loathing.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t like to buy a spannel dawg," said the man, holding the\r\nsleek, curly, black-and-tan animal up to the carriage window; "or a\r\nFrench poodle what\'ll balance a bit of bread on his nose while you\r\ncount ten? Hay? You should have \'em a bargain--say fifteen pound the\r\ntwo."\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mrs. Alexander emerged from the watchmaker\'s, just\r\nin time to catch a glimpse of the man\'s broad shoulders as he moved\r\nsulkily away from the carriage.\r\n\r\n"Has that person been begging of you, Aurora?" she asked, as they drove\r\noff.\r\n\r\n"No. I once bought a dog of him, and he recognized me."\r\n\r\n"And wanted you to buy one to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nMiss Floyd sat gloomily silent during the whole of the homeward drive,\r\nlooking out of the carriage window, and not deigning to take any\r\nnotice whatever of her aunt and cousin. I do not know whether it was\r\nin submission to that palpable superiority of force and vitality in\r\nAurora\'s nature which seemed to set her above her fellows, or simply\r\nin that inherent spirit of toadyism common to the best of us; but Mrs.\r\nAlexander and her fair-haired daughter always paid mute reverence\r\nto the banker\'s heiress, and were silent when it pleased her, or\r\nconversed at her royal will. I verily believe that it was Aurora\'s eyes\r\nrather than Archibald Martin Floyd\'s thousands which over-awed all her\r\nkinsfolk; and that if she had been a street-sweeper dressed in rags,\r\nand begging for halfpence, people would have feared her and made way\r\nfor her, and bated their breath when she was angry.\r\n\r\nThe trees in the long avenue of Felden Woods were hung with sparkling\r\ncoloured lamps, to light the guests who came to Aurora\'s birthday\r\nfestival. The long range of windows on the ground-floor was ablaze\r\nwith light; the crash of the band burst every now and then above\r\nthe perpetual roll of carriage wheels and the shouted repetition of\r\nvisitors\' names, and pealed across the silent woods: through the long\r\nvista of half a dozen rooms opening one into another, the waters of a\r\nfountain, sparkling with a hundred hues in the light, glittered amid\r\nthe dark floral wealth of a conservatory filled with exotics. Great\r\nclusters of tropical plants were grouped in the spacious hall; festoons\r\nof flowers hung about the vapoury curtains in the arched doorways.\r\nLight and splendour were everywhere around; and amid all, and more\r\nsplendid than all, in the dark grandeur of her beauty, Aurora Floyd,\r\ncrowned with scarlet, and robed in white, stood by her father\'s side.\r\n\r\nAmongst the guests who arrive latest at Mr. Floyd\'s ball are\r\ntwo officers from Windsor, who have driven across country in a\r\nmail-phaeton. The elder of these two, and the driver of the vehicle,\r\nhas been very discontented and disagreeable throughout the journey.\r\n\r\n"If I\'d had the remotest idea of the distance, Maldon," he said, "I\'d\r\nhave seen you and your Kentish banker very considerably inconvenienced\r\nbefore I would have consented to victimize my horses for the sake of\r\nthis snobbish party."\r\n\r\n"But it won\'t be a snobbish party," answered the young man impetuously.\r\n"Archibald Floyd is the best fellow in Christendom, and as for his\r\ndaughter----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course, a divinity, with fifty thousand pounds for her fortune;\r\nall of which will no doubt be very tightly settled upon herself if\r\nshe is ever allowed to marry a penniless scapegrace like Francis\r\nLewis Maldon, of Her Majesty\'s 11th Hussars. However, I don\'t want to\r\nstand in your way, my boy. Go in and win, and my blessing be upon your\r\nvirtuous endeavours. I can imagine the young Scotchwoman--red hair (of\r\ncourse you\'ll call it auburn), large feet, and freckles!"\r\n\r\n"Aurora Floyd--red hair and freckles!" The young officer laughed aloud\r\nat the stupendous joke. "You\'ll see her in a quarter of an hour,\r\nBulstrode," he said.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode, Captain of her Majesty\'s 11th Hussars, had consented\r\nto drive his brother-officer from Windsor to Beckenham, and to array\r\nhimself in his uniform, in order to adorn therewith the festival at\r\nFelden Woods, chiefly because, having at two-and-thirty years of age\r\nrun through all the wealth of life\'s excitements and amusements, and\r\nfinding himself a penniless spendthrift in this species of coin, though\r\nwell enough off for mere sordid riches, he was too tired of himself\r\nand the world to care much whither his friends and comrades led him.\r\nHe was the eldest son of a wealthy Cornish baronet, whose ancestor had\r\nreceived his title straight from the hands of Scottish King James,\r\nwhen baronetcies first came into fashion; the same fortunate ancestor\r\nbeing near akin to a certain noble, erratic, unfortunate, and injured\r\ngentleman called Walter Raleigh, and by no means too well used by\r\nthe same Scottish James. Now of all the pride which ever swelled the\r\nbreasts of mankind, the pride of Cornishmen is perhaps the strongest;\r\nand the Bulstrode family was one of the proudest in Cornwall. Talbot\r\nwas no alien son of this haughty house; from his very babyhood he had\r\nbeen the proudest of mankind. This pride had been the saving power\r\nthat had presided over his prosperous career. Other men might have\r\nmade a downhill road of that smooth pathway which wealth and grandeur\r\nmade so pleasant; but not Talbot Bulstrode. The vices and follies\r\nof the common herd were perhaps retrievable, but vice or folly in a\r\nBulstrode would have left a blot upon a hitherto unblemished escutcheon\r\nnever to be erased by time or tears. That pride of birth, which was\r\nutterly unallied to pride of wealth or station, had a certain noble and\r\nchivalrous side, and Talbot Bulstrode was beloved by many a parvenu\r\nwhom meaner men would have insulted. In the ordinary affairs of life\r\nhe was as humble as a woman or a child; it was only when Honour was\r\nin question that the sleeping dragon of pride which had guarded the\r\ngolden apples of his youth, purity, probity, and truth, awoke and bade\r\ndefiance to the enemy. At two-and-thirty he was still a bachelor, not\r\nbecause he had never loved, but because he had never met with a woman\r\nwhose stainless purity of soul fitted her in his eyes to become the\r\nmother of a noble race, and to rear sons who should do honour to the\r\nname of Bulstrode. He looked for more than ordinary every-day virtue in\r\nthe woman of his choice; he demanded those grand and queenly qualities\r\nwhich are rarest in womankind. Fearless truth, a sense of honour keen\r\nas his own, loyalty of purpose, unselfishness, a soul untainted by the\r\npetty basenesses of daily life,--all these he sought in the being he\r\nloved; and at the first warning thrill of emotion caused by a pair of\r\nbeautiful eyes, he grew critical and captious about their owner, and\r\nbegan to look for infinitesimal stains upon the shining robe of her\r\nvirginity. He would have married a beggar\'s daughter if she had reached\r\nhis almost impossible standard; he would have rejected the descendant\r\nof a race of kings if she had fallen one decimal part of an inch\r\nbelow it. Women feared Talbot Bulstrode; manoeuvring mothers shrank\r\nabashed from the cold light of those watchful gray eyes; daughters\r\nto marry blushed and trembled, and felt their pretty affectations,\r\ntheir ball-room properties, drop away from them under the quiet gaze\r\nof the young officer; till from fearing him, the lovely flutterers\r\ngrew to shun and dislike him, and to leave Bulstrode Castle and the\r\nBulstrode fortune unangled for in the great matrimonial fisheries.\r\nSo at two-and-thirty Talbot walked serenely safe amid the meshes and\r\npit-falls of Belgravia, secure in the popular belief, that Captain\r\nBulstrode of the 11th Hussars was not a marrying man. This belief was\r\nperhaps strengthened by the fact that the Cornishman was by no means\r\nthe elegant ignoramus whose sole accomplishments consist in parting his\r\nhair, waxing his moustaches, and smoking a meerschaum that has been\r\ncoloured by his valet, and who has become the accepted type of the\r\nmilitary man in time of peace.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode was fond of scientific pursuits; he neither smoked,\r\ndrank, nor gambled. He had only been to the Derby once in his life, and\r\non that one occasion had walked quietly away from the Stand while the\r\ngreat race was being run, and the white faces were turned towards the\r\nfatal Corner, and men were sick with terror and anxiety, and frenzied\r\nwith the madness of suspense. He never hunted, though he rode as well\r\nas Mr. Assheton Smith. He was a perfect swordsman, and one of Mr.\r\nAngelo\'s pet pupils; but he had never handled a billiard-cue in his\r\nlife, nor had he touched a card since the days of his boyhood, when he\r\ntook a hand at long whist with his father and mother and the parson of\r\nthe parish, in the south drawing-room at Bulstrode Castle. He had a\r\npeculiar aversion to all games of chance and skill, contending that it\r\nwas beneath a gentleman to employ, even for amusement, the implements\r\nof the sharper\'s pitiful trade. His rooms were as neatly kept as\r\nthose of a woman. Cases of mathematical instruments took the place of\r\ncigar-boxes; proof impressions of Raphael adorned the walls ordinarily\r\ncovered with French prints and water-coloured sporting-sketches from\r\nAckermann\'s emporium. He was familiar with every turn of expression\r\nin Descartes and Condillac, but would have been sorely puzzled to\r\ntranslate the argotic locutions of Monsieur de Kock, _p\xe8re_. Those\r\nwho spoke of him summed him up by saying that he wasn\'t a bit like\r\nan officer; but there was a certain cavalry regiment, which he had\r\ncommanded when a memorable and most desperate charge was made against\r\na bristling wall of Russian cannon, whose ranks told another story of\r\nCaptain Bulstrode. He had made an exchange into the 11th Hussars on\r\nhis return from the Crimea, whence, among other distinctions, he had\r\nbrought a stiff leg, which for a time disqualified him from dancing.\r\nIt was from pure benevolence, therefore, or from that indifference to\r\nall things which is easily mistaken for unselfishness, that Talbot\r\nBulstrode had consented to accept an invitation to the ball at Felden\r\nWoods.\r\n\r\nThe banker\'s guests were not of that charmed circle familiar to the\r\ncaptain of Hussars; so Talbot, after a brief introduction to his\r\nhost, fell back among the crowd assembled in one of the doorways,\r\nand quietly watched the dancers; not unobserved himself, however,\r\nfor he was just one of those people who will not pass in a crowd.\r\nTall and broad-chested, with a pale whiskerless face, aquiline nose,\r\nclear, cold, gray eyes, thick moustache, and black hair, worn as\r\nclosely cropped as if he had lately emerged from Coldbath Fields or\r\nMillbank prison, he formed a striking contrast to the yellow-whiskered\r\nyoung cornet who had accompanied him. Even that stiff leg, which in\r\nothers might have seemed a blemish, added to the distinction of his\r\nappearance, and, coupled with the glittering orders on the breast of\r\nhis uniform, told of deeds of prowess lately done. He took very little\r\ndelight in the gay assembly revolving before him to one of Charles\r\nd\'Albert\'s waltzes. He had heard the same music before, executed by\r\nthe same band; the faces, though unfamiliar to him, were not new: dark\r\nbeauties in pink, fair beauties in blue; tall dashing beauties in\r\nsilks, and laces, and jewels, and splendour; modestly downcast beauties\r\nin white crape and rose-buds. They had all been spread for him, those\r\nfamiliar nets of gauze and areophane, and he had escaped them all;\r\nand the name of Bulstrode might drop out of the history of Cornish\r\ngentry to find no record save upon gravestones, but it would never be\r\ntarnished by an unworthy race, or dragged through the mire of a divorce\r\ncourt by a guilty woman. While he lounged against the pillar of a\r\ndoorway, leaning on his cane, and resting his lame leg, and wondering\r\nlazily whether there was anything upon earth that repaid a man for\r\nthe trouble of living, Cornet Maldon approached him with a woman\'s\r\ngloved hand lying lightly on his arm, and a divinity walking by his\r\nside. A divinity! imperiously beautiful in white and scarlet, painfully\r\ndazzling to look upon, intoxicatingly brilliant to behold. Captain\r\nBulstrode had served in India, and had once tasted a horrible spirit\r\ncalled _bang_, which made the men who drank it half mad; and he could\r\nnot help fancying that the beauty of this woman was like the strength\r\nof that alcoholic preparation; barbarous, intoxicating, dangerous, and\r\nmaddening.\r\n\r\nHis brother-officer presented him to this wonderful creature, and he\r\nfound that her earthly name was Aurora Floyd, and that she was the\r\nheiress of Felden Woods.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode recovered himself in a moment. This imperious\r\ncreature, this Cleopatra in crinoline, had a low forehead, a nose that\r\ndeviated from the line of beauty, and a wide mouth. What was she but\r\nanother trap set in white muslin, and baited with artificial flowers,\r\nlike the rest? She was to have fifty thousand pounds for her portion,\r\nso she didn\'t want a rich husband; but she was a nobody, so of course\r\nshe wanted position, and had no doubt read up the Raleigh Bulstrodes\r\nin the sublime pages of Burke. The clear gray eyes grew cold as ever,\r\ntherefore, as Talbot bowed to the heiress. Mr. Maldon found his partner\r\na chair close to the pillar against which Captain Bulstrode had taken\r\nhis stand, and Mrs. Alexander Floyd swooping down upon the cornet at\r\nthis very moment, with the dire intent of carrying him off to dance\r\nwith a lady who executed more of her steps upon the toes of her partner\r\nthan on the floor of the ball-room, Aurora and Talbot were left to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bulstrode glanced downward at the banker\'s daughter. His gaze\r\nlingered upon the graceful head, with its coronal of shining scarlet\r\nberries, encircling smooth masses of blue-black hair. He expected to\r\nsee the modest drooping of the eyelids peculiar to young ladies with\r\nlong lashes, but he was disappointed; for Aurora Floyd was looking\r\nstraight before her, neither at him, nor at the lights, nor the\r\nflowers, nor the dancers, but far away into vacancy. She was so young,\r\nprosperous, admired, and beloved, that it was difficult to account for\r\nthe dim shadow of trouble that clouded her glorious eyes.\r\n\r\nWhile he was wondering what he should say to her, she lifted her eyes\r\nto his face, and asked him the strangest question he had ever heard\r\nfrom girlish lips.\r\n\r\n"Do you know if Thunderbolt won the Leger?" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe was too much confounded to answer for a moment, and she continued\r\nrather impatiently, "They must have heard by six o\'clock this evening\r\nin London; but I have asked half a dozen people here to-night, and no\r\none seems to know anything about it."\r\n\r\nTalbot\'s close-cropped hair seemed lifted from his head as he listened\r\nto this terrible address. Good heavens! what a horrible woman! The\r\nhussar\'s vivid imagination pictured the heir of all the Raleigh\r\nBulstrodes receiving his infantine impressions from such a mother.\r\nShe would teach him to read out of the \'Racing Calendar;\' she would\r\ninvent a royal alphabet of the turf, and tell him that "D stands for\r\nDerby, old England\'s great race," and "E stands for Epsom, a crack\r\nmeeting-place," &c. He told Miss Floyd that he had never been to\r\nDoncaster in his life, that he had never read a sporting-paper, and\r\nthat he knew no more of Thunderbolt than of King Cheops.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him rather contemptuously. "Cheops wasn\'t much," she\r\nsaid: "he won the Liverpool Autumn Cup in Blink Bonny\'s year; but most\r\npeople said it was a fluke."\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode shuddered afresh; but a feeling of pity mingled with\r\nhis horror. "If I had a sister," he thought, "I would get her to talk\r\nto this miserable girl, and bring her to a sense of her iniquity."\r\n\r\nAurora said no more to the captain of Hussars, but relapsed into the\r\nold far-away gaze into vacancy, and sat twisting a bracelet round and\r\nround upon her finely modelled wrist. It was a diamond bracelet, worth\r\na couple of hundred pounds, which had been given her that day by her\r\nfather. He would have invested all his fortune in Messrs. Hunt and\r\nRoskell\'s cunning handiwork, if Aurora had sighed for gems and gewgaws.\r\nMiss Floyd\'s glance fell upon the glittering ornament, and she looked\r\nat it long and earnestly, rather as if she were calculating the value\r\nof the stones than admiring the taste of the workmanship.\r\n\r\nWhile Talbot was watching her, full of wondering pity and horror, a\r\nyoung man hurried up to the spot where she was seated, and reminded her\r\nof an engagement for the quadrille that was forming. She looked at her\r\ntablets of ivory, gold, and turquoise, and with a certain disdainful\r\nweariness rose and took his arm. Talbot followed her receding form.\r\nTaller than most among the throng, her queenly head was not soon lost\r\nsight of.\r\n\r\n"A Cleopatra with a snub nose two sizes too small for her face, and\r\na taste for horseflesh!" said Talbot Bulstrode, ruminating upon the\r\ndeparted divinity. "She ought to carry a betting-book instead of those\r\nivory tablets. How _distrait_ she was all the time she sat here! I dare\r\nsay she has made a book for the Leger, and was calculating how much she\r\nstands to lose. What will this poor old banker do with her? put her\r\ninto a madhouse, or get her elected a member of the Jockey Club? With\r\nher black eyes and fifty thousand pounds, she might lead the sporting\r\nworld. There has been a female Pope, why should there not be a female\r\n\'Napoleon of the Turf\'?"\r\n\r\nLater, when the rustling leaves of the trees in Beckenham Woods were\r\nshivering in that cold gray hour which precedes the advent of the\r\ndawn, Talbot Bulstrode drove his friend away from the banker\'s lighted\r\nmansion. He talked of Aurora Floyd during the whole of that long\r\ncross-country drive. He was merciless to her follies; he ridiculed, he\r\nabused, he sneered at and condemned her questionable tastes. He bade\r\nFrancis Lewis Maldon marry her at his peril, and wished him joy of\r\n_such_ a wife. He declared that if he had such a woman for his sister\r\nhe would shoot her, unless she reformed and burnt her betting-book.\r\nHe worked himself up into a savage humour about the young lady\'s\r\ndelinquencies, and talked of her as if she had done him an unpardonable\r\ninjury by entertaining a taste for the Turf; till at last the poor meek\r\nyoung cornet plucked up a spirit, and told his superior officer that\r\nAurora Floyd was a very jolly girl, and a good girl, and a perfect\r\nlady, and that, if she did want to know who won the Leger, it was no\r\nbusiness of Captain Bulstrode\'s, and that he, Bulstrode, needn\'t make\r\nsuch a howling about it.\r\n\r\nWhile the two men are getting to high words about her, Aurora is seated\r\nin her dressing-room, listening to Lucy Floyd\'s babble about the ball.\r\n\r\n"There was never such a delightful party," that young lady said; "and\r\ndid Aurora see So-and-so, and So-and-so, and So-and-so? and above all,\r\ndid she observe Captain Bulstrode, who had served all through the\r\nCrimean war, and who walked lame, and was the son of Sir John Walter\r\nRaleigh Bulstrode, of Bulstrode Castle, near Camelford?"\r\n\r\nAurora shook her head with a weary gesture. No, she hadn\'t noticed any\r\nof these people. Poor Lucy\'s childish talk was stopped in a moment.\r\n\r\n"You are tired, Aurora dear," she said: "how cruel I am to worry you!"\r\n\r\nAurora threw her arms about her cousin\'s neck, and hid her face upon\r\nLucy\'s white shoulder.\r\n\r\n"I am tired," she said, "very, very tired."\r\n\r\nShe spoke with such an utterly despairing weariness in her tone, that\r\nher gentle cousin was alarmed by her words.\r\n\r\n"You are not unhappy, dear Aurora?" she asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n"No, no--only tired. There, go, Lucy. Good night, good night."\r\n\r\nShe gently pushed her cousin from the room, rejected the services of\r\nher maid, and dismissed her also. Then, tired as she was, she removed\r\nthe candle from the dressing-table to a desk on the other side of the\r\nroom, and seating herself at this desk, unlocked it, and took from one\r\nof its inmost recesses the soiled pencil-scrawl which had been given\r\nher a week before by the man who tried to sell her a dog in Cockspur\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nThe diamond bracelet, Archibald Floyd\'s birthday gift to his daughter,\r\nlay in its nest of satin and velvet upon Aurora\'s dressing-table. She\r\ntook the morocco-case in her hand, looked for a few moments at the\r\njewel, and then shut the lid of the little casket with a sharp metallic\r\nsnap.\r\n\r\n"The tears were in my father\'s eyes when he clasped the bracelet on my\r\narm," she said, as she reseated herself at the desk. "If he could see\r\nme now!"\r\n\r\nShe wrapped the morocco case in a sheet of foolscap, secured the parcel\r\nin several places with red wax and a plain seal, and directed it thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        "J. C.,\r\n\r\n   Care of Mr. Joseph Green,\r\n\r\n           Bell Inn,\r\n\r\n                Doncaster."\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Miss Floyd drove her aunt and cousin into\r\nCroydon, and, leaving them at a Berlin-wool shop, went alone to the\r\npost-office, where she registered and posted this valuable parcel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE BALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after Aurora\'s birthnight festival, Talbot Bulstrode\'s phaeton\r\ndashed once more into the avenue at Felden Woods. Again the captain\r\nmade a sacrifice on the shrine of friendship, and drove Francis Maldon\r\nfrom Windsor to Beckenham, in order that the young cornet might make\r\nthose anxious inquiries about the health of the ladies of Mr. Floyd\'s\r\nhousehold, which, by a pleasant social fiction, are supposed to be\r\nnecessary after an evening of intermittent waltzes and quadrilles.\r\n\r\nThe junior officer was very grateful for this kindness; for Talbot,\r\nthough the best of fellows, was not much given to putting himself out\r\nof the way for the pleasure of other people. It would have been far\r\npleasanter to the captain to dawdle away the day in his own rooms,\r\nlolling over those erudite works which his brother-officers described\r\nby the generic title of "heavy reading," or, according to the popular\r\nbelief of those hare-brained young men, employed in squaring the circle\r\nin the solitude of his chamber.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode was altogether an inscrutable personage to his\r\ncomrades of the 11th Hussars. His black-letter folios, his polished\r\nmahogany cases of mathematical instruments, his proof-before-letters\r\nengravings, were the fopperies of a young Oxonian rather than an\r\nofficer who had fought and bled at Inkermann. The young men who\r\nbreakfasted with him in his rooms trembled as they read the titles of\r\nthe big books on the shelves, and stared helplessly at the grim saints\r\nand angular angels in the pre-Raphaelite prints upon the walls. They\r\ndared not even propose to smoke in those sacred chambers, and were\r\nashamed of the wet impressions of the rims of the Moselle bottles which\r\nthey left upon the mahogany cases.\r\n\r\nIt seemed natural to people to be afraid of Talbot Bulstrode, just\r\nas little boys are frightened of a beadle, a policeman, and a\r\nschoolmaster, even before they have been told the attributes of these\r\nterrible beings. The colonel of the 11th Hussars, a portly gentleman,\r\nwho rode fifteen stone, and wrote his name high in the Peerage, was\r\nfrightened of Talbot. That cold gray eye struck a silent awe into the\r\nhearts of men and women with its straight penetrating gaze that always\r\nseemed to be telling them they were found out. The colonel was afraid\r\nto tell his best stories when Talbot was at the mess-table, for he had\r\na dim consciousness that the captain was aware of the discrepancies\r\nin those brilliant anecdotes, though that officer had never implied\r\na doubt by either look or gesture. The Irish adjutant forgot to brag\r\nabout his conquests amongst the fair sex: the younger men dropped\r\ntheir voices when they talked to each other of the side-scenes at Her\r\nMajesty\'s Theatre; and the corks flew faster, and the laughter grew\r\nlouder, when Talbot left the room.\r\n\r\nThe captain knew that he was more respected than beloved, and like all\r\nproud men who repel the warm feelings of others in utter despite of\r\nthemselves, he was grieved and wounded because his comrades did not\r\nbecome attached to him.\r\n\r\n"Will anybody, out of all the millions upon this wide earth, ever\r\nlove me?" he thought. "No one ever has as yet. Not even my father and\r\nmother. They have been proud of me; but they never loved me. How many\r\na young profligate has brought his parents\' gray hairs with sorrow\r\nto the grave, and has been beloved with the last heart-beat of those\r\nhe destroyed, as I have never been in my life! Perhaps my mother\r\nwould have loved me better, if I had given her more trouble; if I had\r\nscattered the name of Bulstrode all over London upon post-obits and\r\ndishonoured acceptances; if I had been drummed out of my regiment, and\r\nhad walked down to Cornwall without shoes or stockings, to fall at\r\nher feet, and sob out my sins and sorrows in her lap, and ask her to\r\nmortgage her jointure for the payment of my debts. But I have never\r\nasked anything of her, dear soul, except her love, and that she has\r\nbeen unable to give me. I suppose it is because I do not know how to\r\nask. How often I have sat by her side at Bulstrode, talking of all\r\nsorts of indifferent subjects, yet with a vague yearning at my heart\r\nto throw myself upon her breast and implore of her to love and bless\r\nher son; but held aloof by some icy barrier that I have been powerless\r\nall my life to break down! What woman has ever loved me? Not one.\r\nThey have tried to marry me, because I shall be Sir Talbot Bulstrode\r\nof Bulstrode Castle; but how soon they have left off angling for the\r\nprize, and shrunk away from me chilled and disheartened! I shudder when\r\nI remember that I shall be three-and-thirty next March, and that I have\r\nnever been beloved. I shall sell out, now the fighting is over, for I\r\nam no use amongst the fellows here; and, if any good little thing would\r\nfall in love with me, I would marry her and take her down to Bulstrode,\r\nto my mother and father, and turn country gentleman."\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode made this declaration in all sincerity. He wished\r\nthat some good and pure creature would fall in love with him, in order\r\nthat he might marry her. He wanted some spontaneous exhibition of\r\ninnocent feeling which might justify him in saying, "I am beloved!"\r\nHe felt little capacity for loving, on his own side; but he thought\r\nthat he would be grateful to any good woman who would regard him with\r\ndisinterested affection, and that he would devote his life to making\r\nher happy.\r\n\r\n"It would be something to feel that if I were smashed in a railway\r\naccident, or dropped out of a balloon, some one creature in this world\r\nwould think it a lonelier place for lack of me. I wonder whether my\r\nchildren would love me? I dare say not. I should freeze their young\r\naffections with the Latin grammar; and they would tremble as they\r\npassed the door of my study, and hush their voices into a frightened\r\nwhisper when papa was within hearing."\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode\'s ideal of woman was some gentle and feminine creature\r\ncrowned with an aureole of pale auburn hair; some timid soul with\r\ndowncast eyes, fringed with golden-tinted lashes; some shrinking\r\nbeing, as pale and prim as the medi\xe6val saints in his pre-Raphaelite\r\nengravings, spotless as her own white robes, excelling in all womanly\r\ngraces and accomplishments, but only exhibiting them in the narrow\r\ncircle of a home.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Talbot thought that he had met with his ideal when he entered\r\nthe long drawing-room at Felden Woods with Cornet Maldon on the\r\nseventeenth of September, 1857.\r\n\r\nLucy Floyd was standing by an open piano, with her white dress and\r\npale golden hair bathed in a flood of autumn sunlight. That sunlit\r\nfigure came back to Talbot\'s memory long afterwards, after a stormy\r\ninterval, in which it had been blotted away and forgotten, and the long\r\ndrawing-room stretched itself out like a picture before his eyes.\r\n\r\nYes, this was his ideal. This graceful girl, with the shimmering light\r\nfor ever playing upon her hair, and the modest droop in her white\r\neyelids. But undemonstrative as usual, Captain Bulstrode seated himself\r\nnear the piano, after the brief ceremony of greeting, and contemplated\r\nLucy with grave eyes that betrayed no especial admiration.\r\n\r\nHe had not taken much notice of Lucy Floyd on the night of the ball;\r\nindeed, Lucy was scarcely a candle-light beauty; her hair wanted the\r\nsunshine gleaming through it to light up the golden halo about her\r\nface, and the delicate pink of her cheeks waxed pale in the glare of\r\nthe great chandeliers.\r\n\r\nWhile Captain Bulstrode was watching Lucy with that grave contemplative\r\ngaze, trying to find out whether she was in any way different from\r\nother girls he had known, and whether the purity of her delicate beauty\r\nwas more than skin deep, the window opposite to him was darkened, and\r\nAurora Floyd stood between him and the sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe banker\'s daughter paused on the threshold of the open window,\r\nholding the collar of an immense mastiff in both her hands, and looking\r\nirresolutely into the room.\r\n\r\nMiss Floyd hated morning callers, and she was debating within herself\r\nwhether she had been seen, or whether it might be possible to steal\r\naway unperceived.\r\n\r\nBut the dog set up a big bark, and settled the question.\r\n\r\n"Quiet, Bow-wow," she said; "quiet, quiet, boy."\r\n\r\nYes, the dog was called Bow-wow. He was twelve years old, and Aurora\r\nhad so christened him in her seventh year, when he was a blundering,\r\nbig-headed puppy, that sprawled upon the table during the little girl\'s\r\nlessons, upset ink-bottles over her copy-books, and ate whole chapters\r\nof Pinnock\'s abridged histories.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen rose at the sound of her voice, and Miss Floyd came into\r\nthe room and sat down at a little distance from the captain and her\r\ncousin, twirling a straw hat in her hand and staring at her dog, who\r\nseated himself resolutely by her chair, knocking double-knocks of good\r\ntemper upon the carpet with his big tail.\r\n\r\nThough she said very little, and seated herself in a careless attitude\r\nthat bespoke complete indifference to her visitors, Aurora\'s beauty\r\nextinguished poor Lucy, as the rising sun extinguishes the stars.\r\n\r\nThe thick plaits of her black hair made a great diadem upon her low\r\nforehead, and crowned her an Eastern empress; an empress with a\r\ndoubtful nose, it is true, but an empress who reigned by right divine\r\nof her eyes and hair. For do not these wonderful black eyes, which\r\nperhaps shine upon us only once in a lifetime, in themselves constitute\r\na royalty?\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode turned away from his ideal to look at this dark-haired\r\ngoddess, with a coarse straw hat in her hand and a big mastiff\'s head\r\nlying on her lap. Again he perceived that abstraction in her manner\r\nwhich had puzzled him upon the night of the ball. She listened to her\r\nvisitors politely, and she answered them when they spoke to her; but it\r\nseemed to Talbot as if she constrained herself to attend to them by an\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n"She wishes me away, I dare say," he thought; "and no doubt considers\r\nme a \'slow party,\' because I don\'t talk to her of horses and dogs."\r\n\r\nThe captain resumed his conversation with Lucy. He found that she\r\ntalked exactly as he had heard other young ladies talk; that she knew\r\nall they knew, and had been to the places they had visited. The ground\r\nthey went over was very old indeed, but Lucy traversed it with charming\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\n"She is a good little thing," Talbot thought; "and would make an\r\nadmirable wife for a country gentleman. I wish she would fall in love\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\nLucy told him of some excursion in Switzerland, where she had been\r\nduring the preceding autumn with her father and mother.\r\n\r\n"And your cousin," he asked, "was she with you?"\r\n\r\n"No; Aurora was at school in Paris, with the Demoiselles Lespard."\r\n\r\n"Lespard, Lespard!" he repeated; "a Protestant pension in the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Dominique. Why, a cousin of mine is being educated there, a\r\nMiss Trevyllian. She has been there for three or four years. Do you\r\nremember Constance Trevyllian at the Demoiselles Lespard, Miss Floyd?"\r\nsaid Talbot, addressing himself to Aurora.\r\n\r\n"Constance Trevyllian! Yes, I remember her," answered the banker\'s\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing more, and for a few moments there was rather an\r\nawkward pause.\r\n\r\n"Miss Trevyllian is my cousin," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"I hope that you were very good friends."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\nShe bent over her dog, caressing his big head, and not even looking\r\nup as she spoke of Miss Trevyllian. It seemed as if the subject was\r\nutterly indifferent to her, and she disdained even to affect an\r\ninterest in it.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode bit his lip with offended pride. "I suppose this\r\npurse-proud heiress looks down upon the Trevyllians of Tredethlin," he\r\nthought, "because they can boast of nothing better than a few hundred\r\nacres of barren moorland, some exhausted tin-mines, and a pedigree that\r\ndates from the days of King Arthur."\r\n\r\nArchibald Floyd came into the drawing-room while the officers were\r\nseated there, and bade them welcome to Felden Woods.\r\n\r\n"A long drive, gentlemen," he said; "your horses will want a rest. Of\r\ncourse you will dine with us. We shall have a full moon to-night, and\r\nyou\'ll have it as light as day for your drive back."\r\n\r\nTalbot looked at Francis Lewis Maldon, who was sitting staring at\r\nAurora with vacant, open-mouthed admiration. The young officer knew\r\nthat the heiress and her fifty thousand pounds were not for him; but\r\nit was scarcely the less pleasant to look at her, and wish that like\r\nCaptain Bulstrode he had been the eldest son of a rich baronet.\r\n\r\nThe invitation was accepted by Mr. Maldon as cordially as it had been\r\ngiven, and with less than his usual stiffness of manner on the part of\r\nTalbot Bulstrode.\r\n\r\nThe luncheon-bell rang while they were talking, and the little party\r\nadjourned to the dining-room, where they found Mrs. Alexander Floyd\r\nsitting at the bottom of the table. Talbot sat next to Lucy, with Mr.\r\nMaldon opposite to them, while Aurora took her place beside her father.\r\n\r\nThe old man was attentive to his guests, but the shallowest observer\r\ncould have scarcely failed to notice his watchfulness of Aurora. It was\r\never present in his careworn face, that tender, anxious glance which\r\nturned to her at every pause in the conversation, and could scarcely\r\nwithdraw itself from her for the common courtesies of life. If she\r\nspoke, he listened,--listened as if every careless, half-disdainful\r\nword concealed a deeper meaning which it was his task to discern and\r\nunravel. If she was silent, he watched her still more closely, seeking\r\nperhaps to penetrate that gloomy veil which sometimes spread itself\r\nover her handsome face.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode was not so absorbed by his conversation with Lucy\r\nand Mrs. Alexander as to overlook this peculiarity in the father\'s\r\nmanner towards his only child. He saw too that when Aurora addressed\r\nthe banker, it was no longer with that listless indifference, half\r\nweariness, half disdain, which seemed natural to her on other\r\noccasions. The eager watchfulness of Archibald Floyd was in some\r\nmeasure reflected in his daughter; by fits and starts, it is true, for\r\nshe generally sank back into that moody abstraction which Captain\r\nBulstrode had observed on the night of the ball; but still it was\r\nthere, the same feeling as her father\'s, though less constant and\r\nintense. A watchful, anxious, half-sorrowful affection, which could\r\nscarcely exist except under abnormal circumstances. Talbot Bulstrode\r\nwas vexed to find himself wondering about this, and growing every\r\nmoment less and less attentive to Lucy\'s simple talk.\r\n\r\n"What does it mean?" he thought; "has she fallen in love with some man\r\nwhom her father has forbidden her to marry, and is the old man trying\r\nto atone for his severity? That\'s scarcely likely. A woman with a head\r\nand throat like hers could scarcely fail to be ambitious--ambitious and\r\nrevengeful, rather than over-susceptible of any tender passion. Did she\r\nlose half her fortune upon that race she talked to me about? I\'ll ask\r\nher presently. Perhaps they have taken away her betting-book, or lamed\r\nher favourite horse, or shot some pet dog, to cure him of distemper.\r\nShe is a spoiled child, of course, this heiress, and I dare say her\r\nfather would try to get a copy of the moon made for her, if she cried\r\nfor that planet."\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon, the banker took his guests into the gardens that\r\nstretched far away upon two sides of the house; the gardens which poor\r\nEliza Floyd had helped to plan nineteen years before.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode walked rather stiffly from his Crimean wound, but\r\nMrs. Alexander and her daughter suited their pace to his, while Aurora\r\nwalked before them with her father and Mr. Maldon, and with the mastiff\r\nclose at her side.\r\n\r\n"Your cousin is rather proud, is she not?" Talbot asked Lucy, after\r\nthey had been talking of Aurora.\r\n\r\n"Aurora proud! oh, no, indeed: perhaps, if she has any fault at all\r\n(for she is the dearest girl that ever lived), it is that she has not\r\nsufficient pride; I mean with regard to servants, and that sort of\r\npeople. She would as soon talk to one of those gardeners as to you or\r\nme; and you would see no difference in her manner, except that perhaps\r\nit would be a little more cordial to them than to us. The poor people\r\nround Felden idolize her."\r\n\r\n"Aurora takes after her mother," said Mrs. Alexander; "she is the\r\nliving image of poor Eliza Floyd."\r\n\r\n"Was Mrs. Floyd a countrywoman of her husband\'s?" Talbot asked. He was\r\nwondering how Aurora came to have those great, brilliant, black eyes,\r\nand so much of the south in her beauty.\r\n\r\n"No; my uncle\'s wife belonged to a Lancashire family."\r\n\r\nA Lancashire family! If Talbot Raleigh Bulstrode could have known that\r\nthe family name was Prodder; that one member of the haughty house had\r\npassed his youth in the pleasing occupations of a cabin-boy, making\r\nthick coffee and toasting greasy herrings for the matutinal meal of a\r\nsurly captain, and receiving more corporal correction from the sturdy\r\ntoe of his master\'s boot than sterling copper coin of the realm! If\r\nhe could have known that the great aunt of this disdainful creature,\r\nwalking before him in all the majesty of her beauty, had once kept a\r\nchandler\'s shop in an obscure street in Liverpool, and for aught any\r\none but the banker knew, kept it still! But this was a knowledge which\r\nhad wisely been kept even from Aurora herself, who knew little except\r\nthat, despite of having been born with that allegorical silver spoon\r\nin her mouth, she was poorer than other girls, inasmuch as she was\r\nmotherless.\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander, Lucy, and the captain overtook the others upon a rustic\r\nbridge, where Talbot stopped to rest. Aurora was leaning over the rough\r\nwooden balustrade, looking lazily at the water.\r\n\r\n"Did your favourite win the race, Miss Floyd?" he asked, as he watched\r\nthe effect of her profile against the sunlight; not a very beautiful\r\nprofile certainly, but for the long black eyelashes, and the radiance\r\nunder them, which their darkest shadows could never hide.\r\n\r\n"Which favourite?" she said.\r\n\r\n"The horse you spoke to me about the other night,--Thunderbolt; did he\r\nwin?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry to hear it."\r\n\r\nAurora looked up at him, reddening angrily. "Why so?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Because I thought you were interested in his success."\r\n\r\nAs Talbot said this, he observed, for the first time, that Archibald\r\nFloyd was near enough to overhear their conversation, and, furthermore\r\nthat he was regarding his daughter with even more than his usual\r\nwatchfulness.\r\n\r\n"Do not talk to me of racing; it annoys papa," Aurora said to the\r\ncaptain, dropping her voice. Talbot bowed. "I was right, then," he\r\nthought; "the turf is the skeleton. I dare say Miss Floyd has been\r\ndoing her best to drag her father\'s name into the \'Gazette,\' and yet he\r\nevidently loves her to distraction; while I----" There was something so\r\nvery pharisaical in the speech, that Captain Bulstrode would not even\r\nfinish it mentally. He was thinking, "This girl, who, perhaps, has been\r\nthe cause of nights of sleepless anxiety and days of devouring care,\r\nis tenderly beloved by her father; while I, who am a model to all the\r\nelder sons of England, have never been loved in my life."\r\n\r\nAt half-past six the great bell at Felden Woods rang a clamorous peal\r\nthat went shivering above the trees, to tell the country-side that the\r\nfamily were going to dress for dinner; and another peal at seven, to\r\ntell the villagers round Beckenham and West Wickham that Maister Floyd\r\nand his household were going to dine; but not altogether an empty or\r\ndiscordant peal, for it told the hungry poor of broken victuals and\r\nrich and delicate meats to be had almost for asking in the servants\'\r\noffices;--shreds of fricandeaux and patches of dainty preparations,\r\nquarters of chickens and carcasses of pheasants, which would have gone\r\nto fatten the pigs for Christmas, but for Archibald Floyd\'s strict\r\ncommands that all should be given to those who chose to come for it.\r\n\r\nMr. Floyd and his visitors did not leave the gardens till after the\r\nladies had retired to dress. The dinner-party was very animated, for\r\nAlexander Floyd drove down from the City to join his wife and daughter,\r\nbringing with him the noisy boy who was just going to Eton, and who was\r\npassionately attached to his cousin Aurora; and whether it was owing\r\nto the influence of this young gentleman, or to that fitfulness which\r\nseemed a part of her nature, Talbot Bulstrode could not discover, but\r\ncertain it was that the dark cloud melted away from Miss Floyd\'s face,\r\nand she abandoned herself to the joyousness of the hour with a radiant\r\ngrace, that reminded her father of the night when Eliza Percival played\r\nLady Teazle for the last time, and took her farewell of the stage in\r\nthe little Lancashire theatre.\r\n\r\nIt needed but this change in his daughter to make Archibald Floyd\r\nthoroughly happy. Aurora\'s smiles seemed to shed a revivifying\r\ninfluence upon the whole circle. The ice melted away, for the sun\r\nhad broken out, and the winter was gone at last. Talbot Bulstrode\r\nbewildered his brain by trying to discover why it was that this woman\r\nwas such a peerless and fascinating creature. Why it was that, argue\r\nas he would against the fact, he was nevertheless allowing himself to\r\nbe bewitched by this black-eyed siren; freely drinking of that cup of\r\n_bang_ which she presented to him, and rapidly becoming intoxicated.\r\n\r\n"I could almost fall in love with my fair-haired ideal," he thought,\r\n"but I cannot help admiring this extraordinary girl. She is like Mrs.\r\nNisbett in her zenith of fame and beauty; she is like Cleopatra sailing\r\ndown the Cydnus; she is like Nell Gwynne selling oranges; she is\r\nlike Lola Montes giving battle to the Bavarian students; she is like\r\nCharlotte Corday with the knife in her hand, standing behind the friend\r\nof the people in his bath; she is like everything that is beautiful,\r\nand strange, and wicked and unwomanly, and bewitching; and she is just\r\nthe sort of creature that many a fool would fall in love with."\r\n\r\nHe put the length of the room between himself and the enchantress, and\r\ntook his seat by the grand piano, at which Lucy Floyd was playing slow\r\nharmonious symphonies of Beethoven. The drawing-room at Felden Woods\r\nwas so long, that, seated by this piano, Captain Bulstrode seemed to\r\nlook back at the merry group about the heiress as he might have looked\r\nat a scene on the stage from the back of the boxes. He almost wished\r\nfor an opera-glass as he watched Aurora\'s graceful gestures and the\r\nplay of her sparkling eyes; and then turning to the piano, he listened\r\nto the drowsy music, and contemplated Lucy\'s face, marvellously fair\r\nin the light of that full moon of which Archibald Floyd had spoken,\r\nthe glory of which, streaming in from an open window, put out the dim\r\nwax-candles on the piano.\r\n\r\nAll that Aurora\'s beauty most lacked was richly possessed by Lucy.\r\nDelicacy of outline, perfection of feature, purity of tint, all were\r\nthere; but while one face dazzled you by its shining splendour, the\r\nother impressed you only with a feeble sense of its charms, slow\r\nto come and quick to pass away. There are so many Lucys but so few\r\nAuroras; and while you never could be critical with the one, you\r\nwere merciless in your scrutiny of the other. Talbot Bulstrode was\r\nattracted to Lucy by a vague notion that she was just the good and\r\ntimid creature who was destined to make him happy; but he looked at her\r\nas calmly as if she had been a statue, and was as fully aware of her\r\ndefects as a sculptor who criticises the work of a rival.\r\n\r\nBut she was exactly the sort of woman to make a good wife. She had\r\nbeen educated to that end by a careful mother. Purity and goodness had\r\nwatched over her and hemmed her in from her cradle. She had never seen\r\nunseemly sights, or heard unseemly sounds. She was as ignorant as a\r\nbaby of all the vices and horrors of this big world. She was lady-like,\r\naccomplished, well informed; and if there were a great many others of\r\nprecisely the same type of graceful womanhood, it was certainly the\r\nhighest type, and the holiest, and the best.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening, when Captain Bulstrode\'s phaeton was brought\r\nround to the flight of steps in front of the great doors, the little\r\nparty assembled on the terrace to see the two officers depart, and the\r\nbanker told his guests how he hoped this visit to Felden would be the\r\nbeginning of a lasting acquaintance.\r\n\r\n"I am going to take Aurora and my niece to Brighton for a month or so,"\r\nhe said, as he shook hands with the captain; "but on our return you\r\nmust let us see you as often as possible."\r\n\r\nTalbot bowed, and stammered his thanks for the banker\'s cordiality.\r\nAurora and her cousin Percy Floyd, the young Etonian, had gone down the\r\nsteps, and were admiring Captain Bulstrode\'s thorough-bred bays, and\r\nthe captain was not a little distracted by the picture the group made\r\nin the moonlight.\r\n\r\nHe never forgot that picture. Aurora, with her coronet of plaits\r\ndead black against the purple air, and her silk dress shimmering\r\nin the uncertain light, the delicate head of the bay horse visible\r\nabove her shoulder, and her ringed white hands caressing the animal\'s\r\nslender ears, while the purblind old mastiff, vaguely jealous, whined\r\ncomplainingly at her side.\r\n\r\nHow marvellous is the sympathy which exists between some people and\r\nthe brute creation! I think that horses and dogs understood every word\r\nthat Aurora said to them,--that they worshipped her from the dim depths\r\nof their inarticulate souls, and would have willingly gone to death\r\nto do her service. Talbot observed all this with an uneasy sense of\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether these creatures are wiser than we?" he thought;\r\n"do they recognize some higher attributes in this girl than we can\r\nperceive, and worship their sublime presence? If this terrible woman,\r\nwith her unfeminine tastes and mysterious propensities, were mean,\r\nor cowardly, or false, or impure, I do not think that mastiff would\r\nlove her as he does; I do not think my thorough-breds would let her\r\nhands meddle with their bridles: the dog would snarl, and the horses\r\nwould bite, as such animals used to do in those remote old days when\r\nthey recognized witchcraft and evil spirits, and were convulsed by\r\nthe presence of the uncanny. I dare say this Miss Floyd is a good,\r\ngenerous-hearted creature,--the sort of person fast men would call a\r\nglorious girl,--but as well read in the \'Racing Calendar\' and \'Ruff\'s\r\nGuide\' as other ladies in Miss Yonge\'s novels. I\'m really sorry for\r\nher."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN MELLISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house which the banker hired at Brighton for the month of October\r\nwas perched high up on the East Cliff, towering loftily above the\r\nwind-driven waves; the purple coast of Shoreham was dimly visible from\r\nthe upper windows in the clear autumn mornings, and the Chain Pier\r\nlooked like a strip of ribbon below the cliff. A pleasanter situation\r\nto my mind than those level terraces towards the west, from the windows\r\nof which the sea appears of small extent, and the horizon within half a\r\nmile or so of the Parade.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Floyd took his daughter and her cousin to Brighton, he\r\nentered into an arrangement which he thought, no doubt, a very great\r\nevidence of his wisdom; this was the engagement of a lady, who was\r\nto be a compound governess, companion, and chaperon to Aurora, who,\r\nas Mrs. Alexander said, was sadly in need of some accomplished and\r\nwatchful person, whose care it would be to train and prune those\r\nexuberant branches of her nature which had been suffered to grow as\r\nthey would from her infancy. The beautiful shrub was no longer to trail\r\nits wild stems along the ground, or shoot upward to the blue skies\r\nat its own sweet will; it was to be trimmed and clipped and fastened\r\nprimly to the stony wall of society with cruel nails and galling strips\r\nof cloth. In other words, an advertisement was inserted in the \'Times\'\r\nnewspaper, setting forth that a lady, by birth and education, was\r\nrequired as finishing governess and companion in the household of a\r\ngentleman, to whom salary was no object, provided the aforesaid lady\r\nwas perfect mistress of all the accomplishments under the sun, and was\r\naltogether such an exceptional and extraordinary being as could only\r\nexist in the advertising columns of a popular journal.\r\n\r\nBut if the world had been filled with exceptional beings, Mr. Floyd\r\ncould scarcely have received more answers to his advertisement than\r\ncame pelting in upon the unhappy little postmaster at Beckenham.\r\nThe man had serious thoughts of hiring a cart, in which to convey\r\nthe letters to Felden. If the banker had advertised for a wife,\r\nand had stated the amount of his income, he could scarcely have had\r\nmore answers. It seemed as if the female population of London, with\r\none accord, was seized with the desire to improve the mind and form\r\nthe manners of the daughter of the gentleman to whom terms were no\r\nobject. Officers\' widows, clergymen\'s widows, lawyers\' and merchants\'\r\nwidows, daughters of gentlemen of high family but reduced means, orphan\r\ndaughters of all sorts of noble and distinguished people,--declared\r\nthemselves each and every one to be the person who, out of all\r\nliving creatures upon this earth, was best adapted for the post.\r\nMrs. Alexander Floyd selected six letters, threw the rest into the\r\nwaste-paper basket, ordered the banker\'s carriage, and drove into town\r\nto see the six writers thereof. She was a practical and energetic\r\nwoman, and she put the six applicants through their facings so\r\nseverely, that when she returned to Mr. Floyd it was to announce that\r\nonly one of them was good for anything, and that she was coming down to\r\nFelden Woods the next day.\r\n\r\nThe chosen lady was the widow of an ensign who had died within six\r\nmonths of his marriage, and about an hour and a half before he would\r\nhave succeeded to some enormous property, the particulars of which\r\nwere never rightly understood by the friends of his unfortunate\r\nrelict. But vague as the story might be, it was quite clear enough to\r\nestablish Mrs. Walter Powell in life as a disappointed woman. She was\r\na woman with straight light hair, and a lady-like droop of the head.\r\nA woman who had left school to marry, and after six months\' wedded\r\nlife had gone back to the same school as instructress of the junior\r\npupils. A woman whose whole existence had been spent in teaching and\r\nbeing taught; who had exercised in her earlier years a species of\r\nhand-to-mouth tuition, teaching in the morning that which she learnt\r\nover-night; who had never lost an opportunity of improving herself;\r\nwho had grown mechanically proficient as a musician and an artist,\r\nwho had a certain parrot-like skill in foreign languages, who had\r\nread all the books incumbent upon her to read, and who knew all the\r\nthings imperative for her to know, and who, beyond all this, and\r\noutside the boundary of the schoolroom wall, was ignorant and soulless\r\nand low-minded and vulgar. Aurora swallowed the bitter pill as best\r\nshe might, and accepted Mrs. Powell as the person chartered for her\r\nimprovement:--a kind of ballast to be flung into the wandering bark, to\r\nsteady its erratic course and keep it off rocks and quicksands.\r\n\r\n"I must put up with her, Lucy, I suppose," she said; "and I must\r\nconsent to be improved and formed by the poor faded creature. I wonder\r\nwhether she will be like Miss Drummond, who used to let me off from my\r\nlessons, and read novels while I ran wild in the gardens and stables. I\r\ncan put up with her, Lucy, as long as I have you with me; but I think\r\nI should go mad, if I were to be chained up alone with that grim,\r\npale-faced watch-dog."\r\n\r\nMr. Floyd and his family drove from Felden to Brighton in the banker\'s\r\nroomy travelling-carriage, with Aurora\'s maid in the rumble, a pile of\r\nimperials upon the roof, and Mrs. Powell, with her young charges, in\r\nthe interior of the vehicle. Mrs. Alexander had gone back to Fulham,\r\nhaving done her duty, as she considered, in securing a protectress for\r\nAurora; but Lucy was to stay with her cousin at Brighton, and to ride\r\nwith her on the downs. The saddle-horses had gone down the day before\r\nwith Aurora\'s groom, a gray-haired and rather surly old fellow who had\r\nserved Archibald Floyd for thirty years; and the mastiff called Bow-wow\r\ntravelled in the carriage with his mistress.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after the arrival at Brighton, Aurora and her cousin were\r\nwalking together on the West Cliff, when a gentleman with a stiff leg\r\nrose from a bench upon which he had been seated listening to the band,\r\nand slowly advanced to them. Lucy dropped her eyelids with a faint\r\nblush; but Aurora held out her hand in answer to Captain Bulstrode\'s\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\n"I thought I should be sure to meet you down here, Miss Floyd," he\r\nsaid. "I only came this morning, and I was going to call at Folthorpe\'s\r\nfor your papa\'s address. Is he quite well?"\r\n\r\n"Quite--yes, that is--pretty well." A shadow stole over her face as she\r\nspoke. It was a wonderful face for fitful lights and shades. "But we\r\ndid not expect to see you at Brighton, Captain Bulstrode; we thought\r\nyour regiment was still quartered at Windsor."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my regiment--that is, the Eleventh is still at Windsor; but I\r\nhave sold out."\r\n\r\n"Sold out!" Both Aurora and her cousin opened their eyes at this\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I was tired of the army. It\'s dull work now the fighting is\r\nall over. I might have exchanged and gone to India, certainly," he\r\nadded, as if in answer to some argument of his own; "but I\'m getting\r\nmiddle-aged, and I am tired of roaming about the world."\r\n\r\n"I should like to go to India," said Aurora, looking seaward as she\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n"You, Aurora! but why?" exclaimed Lucy.\r\n\r\n"Because I hate England."\r\n\r\n"I thought it was France you disliked."\r\n\r\n"I hate them both. What is the use of this big world, if we are to stop\r\nfor ever in one place, chained to one set of ideas, fettered to one\r\nnarrow circle of people, seeing and hearing of the persons we hate for\r\never and ever, and unable to get away from the odious sound of their\r\nnames? I should like to turn female missionary, and go to the centre of\r\nAfrica with Dr. Livingstone and his family; and I would go if it wasn\'t\r\nfor papa."\r\n\r\nPoor Lucy stared at her cousin in helpless amazement. Talbot Bulstrode\r\nfound himself falling back into that state of bewilderment in which\r\nthis girl always threw him. What did she mean, this heiress of nineteen\r\nyears of age, by her fits of despondency and outbursts of bitterness?\r\nWas it not perhaps, after all, only an affectation of singularity?\r\n\r\nAurora looked at him with her brightest smile while he was asking\r\nhimself this question. "You will come and see papa?" she said.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bulstrode declared that he desired no greater happiness than\r\nto pay his respects to Mr. Floyd, in token whereof he walked with the\r\nyoung ladies towards the East Cliff.\r\n\r\nFrom that morning, the officer became a constant visitor at the\r\nbanker\'s. He played chess with Lucy, accompanied her on the piano\r\nwhen she sang, assisted her with valuable hints when she painted\r\nin water-colours, put in lights here and glimpses of sky there,\r\ndeepened autumnal browns, and intensified horizon purples, and made\r\nhimself altogether useful to the young lady, who was, as we know,\r\naccomplished in all lady-like arts. Mrs. Powell, seated in one of the\r\nwindows of the pleasant drawing-room, shed the benignant light of\r\nher faded countenance and pale-blue eyes upon the two young people,\r\nand represented all the proprieties in her own person; Aurora, when\r\nthe weather prevented her riding, occupied herself more restlessly\r\nthan profitably by taking up books and tossing them down, pulling\r\nBow-wow\'s ears, staring out of the windows, drawing caricatures of the\r\npromenaders on the cliff, and dragging out a wonderful little watch,\r\nwith a bunch of dangling inexplicable golden absurdities, to see what\r\no\'clock it was.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode, while leaning over Lucy\'s piano or drawing-board,\r\nor pondering about the next move of his queen, had ample leisure to\r\nwatch the movements of Miss Floyd, and to be shocked at the purposeless\r\nmanner in which that young lady spent the rainy mornings. Sometimes he\r\nsaw her poring over \'Bell\'s Life,\' much to the horror of Mrs. Walter\r\nPowell, who had a vague idea of the iniquitous proceedings recited in\r\nthat terrible journal, but who was afraid to stretch her authority so\r\nfar as to forbid its perusal.\r\n\r\nMrs. Powell looked with silent approbation upon the growing familiarity\r\nbetween gentle Lucy Floyd and the captain. She had feared at first that\r\nTalbot was an admirer of Aurora\'s; but the manner of the two soon\r\ndispelled her alarm. Nothing could be more cordial than Miss Floyd\'s\r\ntreatment of the officer; but she displayed the same indifference to\r\nhim that she did to everything else, except her dog and her father. Was\r\nit possible that well-nigh perfect face and those haughty graces had no\r\ncharm for the banker\'s daughter? Could it be that she could spend hour\r\nafter hour in the society of the handsomest and most aristocratic man\r\nshe had ever met, and yet be as heart-whole as when the acquaintance\r\nbegan? There was one person in the little party who was for ever asking\r\nthat question, and never able to answer it to her own satisfaction, and\r\nthat person was Lucy Floyd. Poor Lucy Floyd, who was engaged, night and\r\nday, in mentally playing that old German game which Faust and Margaret\r\nplayed together with the full-blown rose in the garden,--"He loves\r\nme--loves me not!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Walter Powell\'s shallow-sighted blue eyes might behold in Lucy\r\nCaptain Bulstrode\'s attraction to the East Cliff; but Lucy herself knew\r\nbetter--bitterly, cruelly better.\r\n\r\n"Captain Bulstrode\'s attentions to Miss Lucy Floyd were most evident,"\r\nMrs. Powell said one day when the captain left, after a long morning\'s\r\nmusic and singing and chess. How Lucy hated the prim phrase! None\r\nknew so well as she the value of those "attentions." They had been at\r\nBrighton six weeks, and for the last five the captain had been with\r\nthem nearly every morning. He had ridden with them on the downs, and\r\ndriven with them to the Dyke, and lounged beside them listening to\r\nthe band, and stood behind them in their box at the pretty little\r\ntheatre, and crushed with them into the Pavilion to hear Grisi and\r\nMario, and Alboni and poor Bosio. He had attended them through the\r\nwhole round of Brighton amusements, and had never seemed weary of\r\ntheir companionship. But for all this, Lucy knew what the last leaf\r\nupon the rose would tell her, when the many petals should be plucked\r\naway, and the poor stem be left bare. She knew how often he forgot to\r\nturn over the leaf in the Beethoven sonatas; how often he put streaks\r\nof green into an horizon that should have been purple, and touched\r\nup the trees in her foreground with rose-pink, and suffered himself\r\nto be ignominiously checkmated from sheer inattention, and gave her\r\nwandering, random answers when she spoke to him. She knew how restless\r\nhe was when Aurora read \'Bell\'s Life,\' and how the very crackle of the\r\nnewspaper made him wince with nervous pain. She knew how tender he was\r\nof the purblind mastiff, how eager to be friends with him, how almost\r\nsycophantic in his attentions to the big stately animal. Lucy knew, in\r\nshort, that which Talbot as yet did not know himself: she knew that he\r\nwas fast falling over head and ears in love with her cousin, and she\r\nhad at the same time a vague idea that he would much rather have fallen\r\nin love with herself, and that he was blindly struggling with the\r\ngrowing passion.\r\n\r\nIt was so; he was falling in love with Aurora. The more he protested\r\nagainst her, the more determinedly he exaggerated her follies, and\r\nargued with himself upon the folly of loving her, so much the more\r\nsurely did he love her. The very battle he was fighting kept her for\r\never in his mind, until he grew the veriest slave of the lovely vision,\r\nwhich he only evoked in order to endeavour to exorcise.\r\n\r\n"How could he take her down to Bulstrode, and introduce her to his\r\nfather and mother?" he thought; and at the thought she appeared to him\r\nilluminating the old Cornish mansion by the radiance of her beauty,\r\nfascinating his father, bewitching his mother, riding across the\r\nmoorland on her thorough-bred mare, and driving all the parish mad with\r\nadmiration of her.\r\n\r\nHe felt that his visits to Mr. Floyd\'s house were fast compromising him\r\nin the eyes of its inmates. Sometimes he felt himself bound in honour\r\nto make Lucy an offer of his hand; sometimes he argued that no one\r\nhad any right to consider his attentions more particular to one than\r\nto the other of the young ladies. If he had known of that weary game\r\nwhich Lucy was for ever mentally playing with the imaginary rose, I\r\nam sure he would not have lost an hour in proposing to her; but Mrs.\r\nAlexander\'s daughter had been far too well educated to betray one\r\nemotion of her heart, and she bore her girlish agonies, and concealed\r\nher hourly tortures, with the quiet patience common to these simple\r\nwomanly martyrs. She knew that the last leaf must soon be plucked, and\r\nthe sweet pain of uncertainty be for ever ended.\r\n\r\nHeaven knows how long Talbot Bulstrode might have done battle with his\r\ngrowing passion, had it not been for an event which put an end to his\r\nindecision and made him desperate. This event was the appearance of a\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nHe was walking with Aurora and Lucy upon the West Cliff one afternoon\r\nin November, when a mail-phaeton and pair suddenly drew up against the\r\nrailings that separated them from the road, and a big man, with huge\r\nmasses of Scotch plaid twisted about his waist and shoulders, sprang\r\nout of the vehicle, splashing the mud upon his legs, and rushed up to\r\nTalbot, taking off his hat as he approached, and bowing apologetically\r\nto the ladies.\r\n\r\n"Why, Bulstrode," he said, "who on earth would have thought of seeing\r\nyou here? I heard you were in India, man; but what have you done to\r\nyour leg?"\r\n\r\nHe was so breathless with hurry and excitement, that he was utterly\r\nindifferent to punctuation; and it seemed as much as he could do to\r\nkeep silence while Talbot introduced him to the ladies as Mr. Mellish,\r\nan old friend and school-fellow. The stranger stared with such\r\nopen-mouthed admiration at Miss Floyd\'s black eyes, that the captain\r\nturned round upon him almost savagely, as he asked what had brought\r\n_him_ to Brighton.\r\n\r\n"The hunting season, my boy. Tired of Yorkshire; know every field,\r\nditch, hedge, pond, sunk fence, and scrap of timber in the three\r\nRidings. I\'m staying at the Bedford; I\'ve got my stud with me--give you\r\na mount to-morrow morning if you like. Harriers meet at eleven--Dyke\r\nRoad. I\'ve a gray that\'ll suit you to a nicety--carry my weight, and as\r\neasy to sit as your arm-chair."\r\n\r\nTalbot hated his friend for talking of horses; he felt a jealous\r\nterror of him. This, perhaps, was the sort of man whose society\r\nwould be agreeable to Aurora,--this big, empty-headed Yorkshireman,\r\nwith his babble about his stud and hunting appointments. But turning\r\nsharply round to scrutinize Miss Floyd, he was gratified to find that\r\nyoung lady looking vacantly at the gathering mists upon the sea, and\r\napparently unconscious of the existence of Mr. John Mellish, of Mellish\r\nPark, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThis John Mellish was, I have said, a big man, looking even bigger than\r\nhe was by reason of about eight yards\' length of thick shepherd\'s plaid\r\ntwisted scientifically about his shoulders. He was a man of thirty\r\nyears of age at least, but having withal such a boyish exuberance\r\nin his manner, such a youthful and innocent joyousness in his face,\r\nthat he might have been a youngster of eighteen just let loose from\r\nsome public academy of the muscular Christianity school. I think\r\nthe Rev. Charles Kingsley would have delighted in this big, hearty,\r\nbroad-chested young Englishman, with brown hair brushed away from an\r\nopen forehead, and a thick auburn moustache bordering a mouth for ever\r\nready to expand into a laugh. Such a laugh, too! such a hearty and\r\nsonorous peal, that the people on the Parade turned round to look at\r\nthe owner of those sturdy lungs, and smiled good-naturedly for very\r\nsympathy with his honest merriment.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode would have given a hundred pounds to get rid of\r\nthe noisy Yorkshireman. What business had he at Brighton? Wasn\'t\r\nthe biggest county in England big enough to hold him, that he must\r\nneeds bring his north-country bluster to Sussex, for the annoyance of\r\nTalbot\'s friends?\r\n\r\nCaptain Bulstrode was not any better pleased when, strolling a little\r\nfurther on, the party met with Archibald Floyd, who had come out to\r\nlook for his daughter. The old man begged to be introduced to Mr.\r\nMellish, and invited the honest Yorkshireman to dine at the East Cliff\r\nthat very evening, much to the aggravation of Talbot, who fell sulkily\r\nback, and allowed John to make the acquaintance of the ladies. The\r\nfamiliar brute ingratiated himself into their good graces in about ten\r\nminutes; and by the time they reached the banker\'s house was more at\r\nhis ease with Aurora than was the heir of Bulstrode after two months\'\r\nacquaintance. He accompanied them to the door-step, shook hands with\r\nthe ladies and Mr. Floyd, patted the mastiff Bow-wow, gave Talbot a\r\nplayful sledge-hammer-like slap upon the shoulder, and ran back to the\r\nBedford to dress for dinner. His spirits were so high that he knocked\r\nover little boys and tumbled against fashionable young men, who drew\r\nthemselves up in stiff amazement as the big fellow dashed past them.\r\nHe sang a scrap of a hunting-song as he ran up the great staircase to\r\nhis eyrie at the Bedford, and chattered to his valet as he dressed. He\r\nseemed a creature especially created to be prosperous; to be the owner\r\nand dispenser of wealth, the distributor of good things. People who\r\nwere strangers to him ran after and served him on speculation, knowing\r\ninstinctively that they would get ample reward for their trouble.\r\nWaiters in a coffee-room deserted other tables to attend upon that at\r\nwhich he was seated. Box-keepers would leave parties of six shivering\r\nin the dreary corridors while they found a seat for John Mellish.\r\nMendicants picked him out from the crowd in a busy thoroughfare, and\r\nhung about him, and would not be driven away without a dole from the\r\npocket of his roomy waistcoat. He was always spending his money for\r\nthe convenience of other people. He had an army of old servants at\r\nMellish Park, who adored him and tyrannized over him after the manner\r\nof their kind. His stables were crowded with horses that were lame,\r\nor wall-eyed, or otherwise disqualified for service, but that lived\r\non his bounty like a set of jolly equine paupers, and consumed as\r\nmuch corn as would have supplied a racing stud. He was perpetually\r\npaying for things he neither ordered nor had, and was for ever being\r\ncheated by the dear honest creatures about him, who, for all they did\r\ntheir best to ruin him, would have gone through typical fire and water\r\nto serve him, and would have clung to him, and worked for him, and\r\nsupported him out of those very savings for which they had robbed him,\r\nwhen the ruin came. If "Muster John" had a headache, every creature in\r\nthat disorderly household was unhappy and uneasy till the ailment was\r\ncured; every lad in the stables, every servant-maid in the house, was\r\neager that his or her remedy should be tried for his restoration. If\r\nyou had said at Mellish Park that John\'s fair face and broad shoulders\r\nwere not the highest forms of manly beauty and grace, you would have\r\nbeen set down as a creature devoid of all taste or judgment. To the\r\nmind of that household, John Mellish in "pink" and pipe-clayed tops\r\nwas more beautiful than the Apollo Belvidere, whose bronze image\r\nin little adorned a niche in the hall. If you had told them that\r\nfourteen-stone weight was not indispensable to manly perfection, or\r\nthat it was possible there were more lofty accomplishments than driving\r\nunicorn or shooting forty-seven head of game in a morning, or pulling\r\nthe bay mare\'s shoulder into joint that time she got a sprain in the\r\nhunting-field, or vanquishing Joe Millings, the East Riding smasher,\r\nwithout so much as losing breath,--those simple-hearted Yorkshire\r\nservants would have fairly laughed in your face. Talbot Bulstrode\r\ncomplained that everybody respected him, and nobody loved him. John\r\nMellish might have uttered the reverse of this complaint, had he been\r\nso minded. Who could help loving the honest, generous squire, whose\r\nhouse and purse were open to all the country-side? Who could feel\r\nany chilling amount of respect for the friendly and familiar master\r\nwho sat upon the table in the big kitchen at Mellish Park, with his\r\ndogs and servants round him, and gave them the history of the day\'s\r\nadventures in the hunting-field, till the old blind fox-hound at his\r\nfeet lifted his big head and set up a feeble music? No; John Mellish\r\nwas well content to be beloved, and never questioned the quality of the\r\naffection bestowed upon him. To him it was all the purest virgin gold;\r\nand you might have talked to him for twelve hours at a sitting without\r\nconvincing him that men and women were vile and mercenary creatures,\r\nand that if his servants, and his tenantry, and the poor about his\r\nestate, loved him, it was for the sake of the temporal benefits they\r\nreceived of him. He was as unsuspicious as a child, who believes\r\nthat the fairies in a pantomime are fairies for ever and ever, and\r\nthat the harlequin is born in patches and a mask. He was as open to\r\nflattery as a school-girl who distributes the contents of her hamper\r\namong a circle of toadies. When people told him he was a fine fellow,\r\nhe believed them, and agreed with them, and thought that the world\r\nwas altogether a hearty, honest place, and that everybody was a fine\r\nfellow. Never having an _arri\xe8re pens\xe9e_ himself, he looked for none in\r\nthe words of other people, but thought that every one blurted out their\r\nreal opinions, and offended or pleased their fellows, as frankly and\r\nblunderingly as himself. If he had been a vicious young man, he would\r\nno doubt have gone altogether to the bad, and fallen among thieves.\r\nBut being blest with a nature that was inherently pure and innocent,\r\nhis greatest follies were no worse than those of a big school-boy who\r\nerrs from very exuberance of spirit. He had lost his mother in the\r\nfirst year of his infancy, and his father had died some time before\r\nhis majority; so there had been none to restrain his actions, and it\r\nwas something at thirty years of age to be able to look back upon a\r\nstainless boyhood and youth, which might have been befouled with the\r\nslime of the gutters, and infected with the odour of villanous haunts.\r\nHad he not reason to be proud of this?\r\n\r\nIs there anything, after all, so grand as a pure and unsullied life--a\r\nfair picture, with no ugly shadows lurking in the background--a smooth\r\npoem, with no crooked, halting line to mar the verse--a noble book,\r\nwith no unholy page--a simple story, such as our children may read? Can\r\nany greatness be greater? can any nobility be more truly noble? When\r\na whole nation mourned with one voice but a few months since; when we\r\ndrew down our blinds and shut out the dull light of the December day,\r\nand listened sadly to the far booming of the guns; when the poorest\r\nput aside their work-a-day troubles to weep for a widowed Queen and\r\norphaned children in a desolate palace; when rough omnibus-drivers\r\nforgot to blaspheme at each other, and tied decent scraps of crape upon\r\ntheir whips, and went sorrowfully about their common business, thinking\r\nof that great sorrow at Windsor,--the words that rose simultaneously to\r\nevery lip dwelt most upon the spotless character of him who was lost;\r\nthe tender husband, the watchful father, the kindly master, the liberal\r\npatron, the temperate adviser, the stainless gentleman.\r\n\r\nIt is many years since England mourned for another royal personage who\r\nwas called a "gentleman." A gentleman who played practical jokes, and\r\nheld infamous orgies, and persecuted a wretched foreign woman, whose\r\nchief sin and misfortune it was to be his wife; a gentleman who cut out\r\nhis own nether garments, and left the companion of his gayest revels,\r\nthe genius whose brightness had flung a spurious lustre upon the dreary\r\nsaturnalia of vice, to die destitute and despairing. Surely there is\r\nsome hope that we have changed for the better within the last thirty\r\nyears, inasmuch as we attach a new meaning to-day to this simple title\r\nof "gentleman." I take some pride, therefore, in the two young men of\r\nwhom I write, for the simple reason that I have no dark patches to\r\ngloss over in the history of either of them. I may fail in making you\r\nlike them; but I can promise that you shall have no cause to be ashamed\r\nof them. Talbot Bulstrode may offend you with his sulky pride; John\r\nMellish may simply impress you as a blundering countrified ignoramus;\r\nbut neither of them shall ever shock you by an ugly word or an unholy\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nREJECTED AND ACCEPTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dinner-party at Mr. Floyd\'s was a very merry one; and when John\r\nMellish and Talbot Bulstrode left the East Cliff to walk westward,\r\nat eleven o\'clock at night, the Yorkshireman told his friend that he\r\nhad never enjoyed himself so much in his life. This declaration must,\r\nhowever, be taken with some reserve; for it was one which John was in\r\nthe habit of making about three times a week: but he really had been\r\nvery happy in the society of the banker\'s family; and, what was more,\r\nhe was ready to adore Aurora Floyd without any further preparation\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nA few bright smiles and sparkling glances, a little animated\r\nconversation about the hunting-field and the race-course, combined with\r\nhalf a dozen glasses of those effervescent wines which Archibald Floyd\r\nimported from the fair Moselle country, had been quite enough to turn\r\nthe head of John Mellish, and to cause him to hold wildly forth in the\r\nmoonlight upon the merits of the beautiful heiress.\r\n\r\n"I verily believe I shall die a bachelor, Talbot," he said, "unless I\r\ncan get that girl to marry me. I\'ve only known her half a dozen hours,\r\nand I\'m head-over-heels in love with her already. What is it that has\r\nknocked me over like this, Bulstrode? I\'ve seen other girls with black\r\neyes and hair, and she knows no more of horses than half the women in\r\nYorkshire; so it isn\'t that. What is it, then, hey?"\r\n\r\nHe came to a full stop against a lamp-post, and stared fiercely at his\r\nfriend as he asked this question.\r\n\r\nTalbot gnashed his teeth in silence.\r\n\r\nIt was no use battling with his fate, then, he thought; the fascination\r\nof this woman had the same effect upon others as upon himself; and\r\nwhile he was arguing with, and protesting against, his passion, some\r\nbrainless fellow, like this Mellish, would step in and win the prize.\r\n\r\nHe wished his friend good night upon the steps of the Old Ship Hotel,\r\nand walked straight to his room, where he sat with his window open\r\nto the mild November night, staring out at the moon-lit sea. He\r\ndetermined to propose to Aurora Floyd before twelve o\'clock the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhy should he hesitate?\r\n\r\nHe had asked himself that question a hundred times before, and had\r\nalways been unable to answer it; and yet he had hesitated. He could\r\nnot dispossess himself of a vague idea that there was some mystery in\r\nthis girl\'s life; some secret known only to herself and her father;\r\nsome one spot upon the history of the past which cast a shadow on\r\nthe present. And yet, how could that be? How could that be, he asked\r\nhimself, when her whole life only amounted to nineteen years, and he\r\nhad heard the history of those years over and over again? How often\r\nhe had artfully led Lucy to tell him the simple story of her cousin\'s\r\ngirlhood! The governesses and masters that had come and gone at Felden\r\nWoods. The ponies and dogs, and puppies and kittens, and petted foals;\r\nthe little scarlet riding-habit that had been made for the heiress,\r\nwhen she rode after the hounds with her cousin Andrew Floyd. The worst\r\nblots that the officer could discover in those early years were a few\r\nbroken china vases, and a great deal of ink spilt over badly-written\r\nFrench exercises. And after being educated at home until she was nearly\r\neighteen, Aurora had been transferred to a Parisian finishing-school;\r\nand that was all. Her life had been the every-day life of other girls\r\nof her own position, and she differed from them only in being a great\r\ndeal more fascinating, and a little more wilful, than the majority.\r\n\r\nTalbot laughed at himself for his doubts and hesitations. "What a\r\nsuspicious brute I must be," he said, "when I imagine I have fallen\r\nupon the clue to some mystery simply because there is a mournful\r\ntenderness in the old man\'s voice when he speaks to his only child! If\r\nI were sixty-seven years of age, and had such a daughter as Aurora,\r\nwould there not always be a shuddering terror mingled with my love,--a\r\nhorrible dread that something would happen to take her away from me? I\r\nwill propose to Miss Floyd to-morrow."\r\n\r\nHad Talbot been thoroughly candid with himself, he would perhaps have\r\nadded, "Or John Mellish will make her an offer the day after."\r\n\r\nCaptain Bulstrode presented himself at the house on the East Cliff\r\nsome time before noon on the next day; but he found Mr. Mellish on the\r\ndoor-step, talking to Miss Floyd\'s groom and inspecting the horses,\r\nwhich were waiting for the young ladies; for the young ladies were\r\ngoing to ride, and John Mellish was going to ride with them.\r\n\r\n"But if you\'ll join us, Bulstrode," the Yorkshireman said,\r\ngood-naturedly, "you can ride the gray I spoke of yesterday. Saunders\r\nshall go back and fetch him."\r\n\r\nTalbot rejected this offer rather sulkily. "I\'ve my own horses here,\r\nthank you," he answered. "But if you\'ll let your groom ride down to the\r\nstables and tell my man to bring them up, I shall be obliged to you."\r\n\r\nAfter which condescending request Captain Bulstrode turned his back\r\nupon his friend, crossed the road, and folding his arms upon the\r\nrailings, stared resolutely at the sea. But in five minutes more the\r\nladies appeared upon the door-step, and Talbot, turning at the sound\r\nof their voices, was fain to cross the road once more for the chance\r\nof taking Aurora\'s foot in his hand as she sprang into her saddle; but\r\nJohn Mellish was before him again, and Miss Floyd\'s mare was curveting\r\nunder the touch of her light hand before the captain could interfere.\r\nHe allowed the groom to attend to Lucy, and, mounting as quickly as his\r\nstiff leg would allow him, he prepared to take his place by Aurora\'s\r\nside. Again he was too late; Miss Floyd had cantered down the hill\r\nattended by Mellish, and it was impossible for Talbot to leave poor\r\nLucy, who was a timid horsewoman.\r\n\r\nThe captain never admired Lucy so little as on horseback. His pale\r\nsaint with the halo of golden hair seemed to him sadly out of place\r\nin a side-saddle. He looked back at the day of his morning visit to\r\nFelden, and remembered how he had admired her, and how exactly she\r\ncorresponded with his ideal, and how determined he was to be bewitched\r\nby her rather than by Aurora. "If she had fallen in love with me," he\r\nthought, "I would have snapped my fingers at the black-browed heiress,\r\nand married this fair-haired angel out of hand. I meant to do that when\r\nI sold my commission. It was not for Aurora\'s sake I left the army, it\r\nwas not Aurora whom I followed down here. Which did I follow? What did\r\nI follow, I wonder? My destiny, I suppose, which is leading me through\r\nsuch a witch\'s dance as I never thought to tread at the sober age of\r\nthree-and-thirty. If Lucy had only loved me, it might have been all\r\ndifferent."\r\n\r\nHe was so angry with himself, that he was half inclined to be angry\r\nwith poor Lucy for not extricating him from the snares of Aurora. If he\r\ncould have read that innocent heart, as he rode in sulky silence across\r\nthe stunted turf on the wide downs! If he could have known the slow\r\nsick pain in that gentle breast, as the quiet girl by his side lifted\r\nher blue eyes every now and then to steal a glance at his hard profile\r\nand moody brow! If he could have read her secret later, when, talking\r\nof Aurora, he for the first time clearly betrayed the mystery of his\r\nown heart! If he could have known how the landscape grew dim before\r\nher eyes, and how the brown moorland reeled beneath her horse\'s hoofs\r\nuntil they seemed going down, down, down into some fathomless depth of\r\nsorrow and despair! But he knew nothing of this; and he thought Lucy\r\nFloyd a pretty, inanimate girl, who would no doubt be delighted to wear\r\na becoming dress as bridesmaid at her cousin\'s wedding.\r\n\r\nThere was to be a dinner-party that evening upon the East Cliff, to\r\nwhich both John Mellish and Talbot were invited; and the captain\r\nsavagely determined to bring matters to an issue before the night was\r\nout.\r\n\r\nTalbot Raleigh Bulstrode would have been very angry with you, had\r\nyou watched him too closely that evening as he fastened the golden\r\nsolitaire in his narrow cravat before his looking-glass in the\r\nbow-window at the Old Ship. He was ashamed of himself for being\r\ncauselessly savage with his valet, whom he dismissed abruptly before\r\nhe began to dress; and had not the courage to call the man back again\r\nwhen his own hot hands refused to do their office. He spilt half a\r\nbottleful of perfume upon his varnished boots, and smeared his face\r\nwith a scented waxy compound bought of Monsieur Eug\xe8ne Rimmel, which\r\npromised to _lisser sans graisser_ his moustache. He broke one of the\r\ncrystal-boxes in his dressing-case, and put the bits of broken glass\r\nin his waistcoat-pocket from sheer absence of mind. He underwent\r\nsemi-strangulation with the unbending circular collar in which, as a\r\ngentleman, it was his duty to invest himself; and he could have beaten\r\nthe ivory backs of his brushes upon his head in blind execration of\r\nthat short, stubborn black hair, which only curled at the _other ends;_\r\nand when at last he emerged from his room, it was with a spiteful\r\nsensation that every waiter in the place knew his secret, and had a\r\nperfect knowledge of every emotion in his breast, and that the very\r\nNewfoundland dog lying on the door-step had an inkling of the truth, as\r\nhe lifted up his big head to look at the captain, and then dropped it\r\nagain with a contemptuously lazy yawn.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bulstrode offered a handful of broken glass to the man who\r\ndrove him to the East Cliff, and then confusedly substituted about\r\nfifteen shillings worth of silver coin for that abnormal species\r\nof payment. There must have been two or three earthquakes and an\r\neclipse or so going on in some part of the globe, he thought, for this\r\njog-trot planet seemed all tumult and confusion to Talbot Bulstrode.\r\nThe world was all Brighton, and Brighton was all blue moonlight, and\r\nsteel-coloured sea, and glancing, dazzling gas-light, and hare-soup and\r\ncod and oysters, and Aurora Floyd. Yes, Aurora Floyd, who wore a white\r\nsilk dress, and a thick circlet of dull gold upon her hair, who looked\r\nmore like Cleopatra to-night than ever, and who suffered Mr. John\r\nMellish to take her down to dinner. How Talbot hated the Yorkshireman\'s\r\nbig fair face, and blue eyes, and white teeth, as he watched the two\r\nyoung people across a phalanx of glass and silver, and flowers and\r\nwax-candles, and pickles, and other Fortnum-and-Mason ware! Here was a\r\ngolden opportunity lost, thought the discontented captain, forgetful\r\nthat he could scarcely have proposed to Miss Floyd at the dinner-table,\r\namidst the jingle of glasses and popping of corks, and with a big\r\npowdered footman charging at him with a side-dish or a sauce-tureen\r\nwhile he put the fatal question. The desired moment came a few hours\r\nafterwards, and Talbot had no longer any excuse for delay.\r\n\r\nThe November evening was mild, and the three windows in the\r\ndrawing-room were open from floor to ceiling. It was pleasant to look\r\nout from the hot gas-light upon that wide sweep of moon-lit ocean,\r\nwith a white sail glimmering here and there against the purple night.\r\nCaptain Bulstrode sat near one of the open windows, watching that\r\ntranquil scene, with, I fear, very little appreciation of its beauty.\r\nHe was wishing that the people would drop off and leave him alone with\r\nAurora. It was close upon eleven o\'clock, and high time they went. John\r\nMellish would of course insist upon waiting for Talbot; this was what a\r\nman had to endure on account of some old school-boy acquaintance. All\r\nRugby might turn up against him in a day or two, and dispute with him\r\nfor Aurora\'s smiles. But John Mellish was engaged in a very animated\r\nconversation with Archibald Floyd, having contrived with consummate\r\nartifice to ingratiate himself in the old man\'s favour, and the\r\nvisitors having one by one dropped off, Aurora, with a listless yawn\r\nthat she took little pains to conceal, strolled out on to the broad\r\niron balcony. Lucy was sitting at a table at the other end of the room,\r\nlooking at a book of beauty. Oh, my poor Lucy! how much did you see\r\nof the Honourable Miss Brownsmith\'s high forehead and Roman nose? Did\r\nnot that young lady\'s handsome face stare up at you dimly through a\r\nblinding mist of tears that you were a great deal too well educated to\r\nshed? The chance had come at last. If life had been a Haymarket comedy,\r\nand the entrances and exits arranged by Mr. Buckstone himself, it\r\ncould have fallen out no better than this. Talbot Bulstrode followed\r\nAurora on to the balcony; John Mellish went on with his story about the\r\nBeverley foxhounds; and Lucy, holding her breath at the other end of\r\nthe room, knew as well what was going to happen as the captain himself.\r\n\r\nIs not life altogether a long comedy, with Fate for the stage-manager,\r\nand Passion, Inclination, Love, Hate, Revenge, Ambition, and Avarice by\r\nturns in the prompter\'s box? A tiresome comedy sometimes, with dreary,\r\ntalkee-talkee front scenes which come to nothing, but only serve to\r\nmake the audience more impatient as they wait while the stage is set\r\nand the great people change their dresses; or a "sensation" comedy,\r\nwith unlooked-for tableaux and unexpected _d\xe9nouements;_ but a comedy\r\nto the end of the chapter, for the sorrows which seem tragic to us\r\nare very funny when seen from the other side of the footlights; and\r\nour friends in the pit are as much amused with our trumpery griefs as\r\nthe Haymarket _habitu\xe9s_ when Mr. Box finds his gridiron empty, or\r\nMr. Cox misses his rasher. What can be funnier than other people\'s\r\nanguish? Why do we enjoy Mr. Maddison Morton\'s farces, and laugh till\r\nthe tears run down our cheek at the comedian who enacts them? Because\r\nthere is scarcely a farce upon the British stage which is not, from\r\nthe rising to the dropping of the curtain, a record of human anguish\r\nand undeserved misery. Yes, undeserved and unnecessary torture--there\r\nis the special charm of the entertainment. If the man who was weak\r\nenough to send his wife to Camberwell _had_ crushed a baby behind a\r\nchest of drawers, his sufferings wouldn\'t be half so delightful to an\r\nintellectual audience. If the gentleman who became embroiled with his\r\nlaundress _had_ murdered the young lady in the green boots, where would\r\nbe the fun of that old Adelphi farce in which poor Wright was wont to\r\ndelight us? And so it is with our friends on the other side of the\r\nfootlights, who enjoy our troubles all the more because we have not\r\nalways deserved them, and whose sorrows we shall gloat over by-and-by,\r\nwhen the bell for the next piece begins, and it is their turn to go on\r\nand act.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode went out on to the balcony, and the earth stood still\r\nfor ten minutes or so, and every steel-blue star in the sky glared\r\nwatchfully down upon the young man in this the supreme crisis of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAurora was leaning against a slender iron pilaster, looking aslant into\r\nthe town and across the town to the sea. She was wrapped in an opera\r\ncloak; no stiff, embroidered, young-ladyfied garment; but a voluminous\r\ndrapery of soft scarlet woollen stuff, such as Semiramide herself might\r\nhave worn. "She looks like Semiramide," Talbot thought. "How did this\r\nScotch banker and his Lancashire wife come to have an Assyrian for\r\ntheir daughter?"\r\n\r\nHe began brilliantly, this young man, as lovers generally do.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid you must have fatigued yourself this evening, Miss Floyd,"\r\nhe remarked.\r\n\r\nAurora stifled a yawn as she answered him. "I am rather tired," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t very encouraging. How was he to begin an eloquent speech,\r\nwhen she might fall asleep in the middle of it? But he did; he dashed\r\nat once into the heart of his subject, and he told her how he loved\r\nher; how he had done battle with this passion, which had been too\r\nstrong for him; how he loved her as he never thought to love any\r\ncreature upon this earth; and how he cast himself before her in all\r\nhumility to take his sentence of life or death from her dear lips.\r\n\r\nShe was silent for some moments, her profile sharply distinct to him\r\nin the moonlight, and those dear lips trembling visibly. Then, with\r\na half-averted face, and in words that seemed to come slowly and\r\npainfully from a stifled throat, she gave him his answer.\r\n\r\nThat answer was a rejection!\r\n\r\nNot a young lady\'s No, which means Yes to-morrow; or which means\r\nperhaps that you have not been on your knees in a passion of despair,\r\nlike Lord Edward Fitz-Morkysh in Miss Oderose\'s last novel. Nothing\r\nof this kind; but a calm negative, carefully and tersely worded, as\r\nif she feared to mislead him by so much as one syllable that could\r\nleave a loophole through which hope might creep into his heart. He was\r\nrejected. For a moment it was quite as much as he could do to believe\r\nit. He was inclined to imagine that the signification of certain words\r\nhad suddenly changed, or that he had been in the habit of mistaking\r\nthem all his life, rather than that those words meant this hard fact;\r\nnamely, that he, Talbot Raleigh Bulstrode, of Bulstrode Castle, and of\r\nSaxon extraction, had been rejected by the daughter of a Lombard-Street\r\nbanker.\r\n\r\nHe paused--for an hour and a half or so, as it seemed to him--in order\r\nto collect himself before he spoke again.\r\n\r\n"May I--venture to inquire," he said,--how horribly commonplace the\r\nphrase seemed! he could have used no worse had he been inquiring for\r\nfurnished lodgings,--"may I ask if any prior attachment--to one more\r\nworthy----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no, no!"\r\n\r\nThe answer came upon him so suddenly, that it almost startled him as\r\nmuch as her rejection.\r\n\r\n"And yet your decision is irrevocable?"\r\n\r\n"Quite irrevocable."\r\n\r\n"Forgive me if I am intrusive; but--but Mr. Floyd may perhaps have\r\nformed some higher views----"\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a stifled sob as she clasped her hands over her\r\naverted face.\r\n\r\n"Higher views!" she said; "poor dear old man! no, no, indeed."\r\n\r\n"It is scarcely strange that I bore you with these questions. It is so\r\nhard to think that, meeting you with your affections disengaged, I\r\nhave yet been utterly unable to win one shadow of regard upon which I\r\nmight build a hope for the future."\r\n\r\nPoor Talbot! Talbot, the splitter of metaphysical straws and chopper of\r\nlogic, talking of building hopes on shadows, with a lover\'s delirious\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\n"It is so hard to resign every thought of your ever coming to alter\r\nyour decision of to-night, Aurora,"--he lingered on her name for a\r\nmoment, first because it was so sweet to say it, and secondly, in the\r\nhope that she would speak,--"it is so hard to remember the fabric of\r\nhappiness I had dared to build, and to lay it down here to-night for\r\never."\r\n\r\nTalbot quite forgot that, up to the time of the arrival of John\r\nMellish, he had been perpetually arguing against his passion, and had\r\ndeclared to himself over and over again that he would be a consummate\r\nfool if he was ever beguiled into making Aurora his wife. He reversed\r\nthe parable of the fox; for he had been inclined to make faces at the\r\ngrapes while he fancied them within his reach, and now that they were\r\nremoved from his grasp, he thought that such delicious fruit had never\r\ngrown to tempt mankind.\r\n\r\n"If--if," he said, "my fate had been happier, I know how proud my\r\nfather, poor old Sir John, would have been of his eldest son\'s choice."\r\n\r\nHow ashamed he felt of the meanness of this speech! The artful sentence\r\nhad been constructed in order to remind Aurora whom she was refusing.\r\nHe was trying to bribe her with the baronetcy which was to be his in\r\ndue time. But she made no answer to the pitiful appeal. Talbot was\r\nalmost choked with mortification. "I see--I see," he said, "that it is\r\nhopeless. Good night, Miss Floyd."\r\n\r\nShe did not even turn to look at him as he left the balcony; but with\r\nher red drapery wrapped tightly round her, stood shivering in the\r\nmoonlight, with the silent tears slowly stealing down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Higher views!" she cried bitterly, repeating a phrase that Talbot\r\nused,--"higher views! God help him!"\r\n\r\n"I must wish you good-night and good-bye at the same time," Captain\r\nBulstrode said, as he shook hands with Lucy.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I leave Brighton early to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"So suddenly?"\r\n\r\n"Why, not exactly suddenly. I always meant to travel this winter. Can I\r\ndo anything for you--at Cairo?"\r\n\r\nHe was so pale and cold and wretched-looking, that she almost pitied\r\nhim--pitied him in spite of the wild joy growing up in her heart.\r\nAurora had refused him--it was perfectly clear--refused _him!_ The soft\r\nblue eyes filled with tears at the thought that a demigod should have\r\nendured such humiliation. Talbot pressed her hand gently in his own\r\nclammy palm. He could read pity in that tender look, but possessed no\r\nlexicon by which he could translate its deeper meaning.\r\n\r\n"You will wish your uncle good-bye for me, Lucy," he said. He called\r\nher Lucy for the first time; but what did it matter now? His great\r\naffliction set him apart from his fellow-men, and gave him dismal\r\nprivileges. "Good-night, Lucy; good-night and good-bye. I--I--shall\r\nhope to see you again--in a year or two."\r\n\r\nThe pavement of the East Cliff seemed so much air beneath Talbot\r\nBulstrode\'s boots as he strode back to the Old Ship; for it is\r\npeculiar to us, in our moments of supreme trouble or joy, to lose all\r\nconsciousness of the earth we tread, and to float upon an atmosphere of\r\nsublime egotism.\r\n\r\nBut the captain did not leave Brighton the next day on the first stage\r\nof his Egyptian journey. He stayed at the fashionable watering-place;\r\nbut he resolutely abjured the neighbourhood of the East Cliff, and, the\r\nday being wet, took a pleasant walk to Shoreham through the rain; and\r\nShoreham being such a pretty place, he was no doubt much enlivened by\r\nthat exercise.\r\n\r\nReturning through the fog at about four o\'clock, the captain met Mr.\r\nJohn Mellish close against the turnpike outside Cliftonville.\r\n\r\nThe two men stared aghast at each other.\r\n\r\n"Why, where on earth are you going?" asked Talbot.\r\n\r\n"Back to Yorkshire by the first train that leaves Brighton."\r\n\r\n"But this isn\'t the way to the station!"\r\n\r\n"No; but they\'re putting the horses in my portmanteau, and my shirts\r\nare going by the Leeds cattle-train; and----"\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode burst into a loud laugh, a harsh and bitter\r\ncachinnation, but affording wondrous relief to that gentleman\'s\r\novercharged breast.\r\n\r\n"John Mellish," he said, "you have been proposing to Aurora Floyd."\r\n\r\nThe Yorkshireman turned scarlet. "It--it--wasn\'t honourable of her to\r\ntell you," he stammered.\r\n\r\n"Miss Floyd has never breathed a word to me upon the subject. I\'ve just\r\ncome from Shoreham, and you\'ve only lately left the East Cliff. You\'ve\r\nproposed, and you\'ve been rejected."\r\n\r\n"I have," roared John; "and it\'s deuced hard when I promised her she\r\nshould keep a racing stud if she liked, and enter as many colts as she\r\npleased for the Derby, and give her own orders to the trainer, and I\'d\r\nnever interfere;--and--and--Mellish Park is one of the finest places\r\nin the county; and I\'d have won her a bit of blue ribbon to tie up her\r\nbonny black hair."\r\n\r\n"That old Frenchman was right," muttered Captain Bulstrode: "there\r\n_is_ a great satisfaction in the misfortune of others. If I go to my\r\ndentist, I like to find another wretch in the waiting-room; and I like\r\nto have my tooth extracted first, and to see him glare enviously at\r\nme as I come out of the torture chamber, knowing that my troubles are\r\nover, while his are to come. Good-bye, John Mellish, and God bless\r\nyou. You\'re not such a bad fellow after all."\r\n\r\nTalbot felt almost cheerful as he walked back to the Ship, and he\r\ntook a mutton cutlet and tomata sauce, and a pint of Moselle for his\r\ndinner: and the food and wine warmed him; and not having slept a wink\r\non the previous night, he fell into a heavy indigestible slumber, with\r\nhis head hanging over the sofa-cushion, and dreamt that he was at\r\nGrand Cairo (or at a place which would have been that city had it not\r\nbeen now and then Bulstrode Castle, and occasionally chambers in the\r\nAlbany); and that Aurora Floyd was with him, clad in imperial purple,\r\nwith hieroglyphics on the hem of her robe, and wearing a clown\'s jacket\r\nof white satin and scarlet spots, such as he had once seen foremost\r\nin a great race. Captain Bulstrode arose early the next morning, with\r\nthe full intention of departing from Sussex by the 8.45 express; but\r\nsuddenly remembering that he had but poorly acknowledged Archibald\r\nFloyd\'s cordiality, he determined on sacrificing his inclinations on\r\nthe shrine of courtesy, and calling once more at the East Cliff to take\r\nleave of the banker. Having once resolved upon this line of action, the\r\ncaptain would fain have hurried that moment to Mr. Floyd\'s house; but\r\nfinding that it was only half-past seven, he was compelled to restrain\r\nhis impatience and await a more seasonable hour. Could he go at nine?\r\nScarcely. At ten? Yes, surely, as he could then leave by the eleven\r\no\'clock train. He sent his breakfast away untouched, and sat looking\r\nat his watch in a mad hurry for the time to pass, yet growing hot and\r\nuncomfortable as the hour drew near.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter to ten he put on his hat and left the hotel. Mr. Floyd\r\nwas at home, the servant told him--upstairs in the little study, he\r\nthought. Talbot waited for no more. "You need not announce me," he\r\nsaid; "I know where to find your master."\r\n\r\nThe study was on the same floor as the drawing-room; and close against\r\nthe drawing-room door Talbot paused for a moment. The door was open;\r\nthe room empty; no, not empty: Aurora Floyd was there, seated with her\r\nback towards him, and her head leaning on the cushions of her chair. He\r\nstopped for another moment to admire the back view of that small head\r\nwith its crown of lustrous raven hair, then took a step or two in the\r\ndirection of the banker\'s study; then stopped again, then turned back,\r\nwent into the drawing-room, and shut the door behind him.\r\n\r\nShe did not stir as he approached her, nor answer when he stammered\r\nher name. Her face was as white as the face of a dead woman, and her\r\nnerveless hands hung over the cushions of the arm-chair. A newspaper\r\nwas lying at her feet. She had quietly swooned away sitting there by\r\nherself, with no one by to restore her to consciousness.\r\n\r\nTalbot flung some flowers from a vase on the table, and dashed the\r\nwater over Aurora\'s forehead; then wheeling her chair close to the open\r\nwindow, he set her with her face to the wind. In two or three moments\r\nshe began to shiver violently, and soon afterwards opened her eyes,\r\nand looked at him; as she did so, she put her hands to her head, as if\r\ntrying to remember something. "Talbot!" she said, "Talbot!"\r\n\r\nShe called him by his Christian name, she who five-and-thirty hours\r\nbefore had coldly forbidden him to hope.\r\n\r\n"Aurora," he cried, "Aurora, I thought I came here to wish your father\r\ngood-bye; but I deceived myself. I came to ask you once more, and once\r\nfor all, if your decision of the night before last was irrevocable."\r\n\r\n"Heaven knows I thought it was when I uttered it."\r\n\r\n"But it was not?"\r\n\r\n"Do you wish me to revoke it?"\r\n\r\n"Do I wish? do I----"\r\n\r\n"Because if you really do, I will revoke it; for you are a brave and\r\nhonourable man, Captain Bulstrode, and I love you very dearly."\r\n\r\nHeaven knows into what rhapsodies he might have fallen, but she put\r\nup her hand, as much as to say, "Forbear to-day, if you love me,"\r\nand hurried from the room. He had accepted the cup of _bang_ which\r\nthe siren had offered, and had drained the very dregs thereof, and\r\nwas drunken. He dropped into the chair in which Aurora had sat, and,\r\nabsent-minded in his joyful intoxication, picked up the newspaper that\r\nhad lain at her feet. He shuddered in spite of himself as he looked at\r\nthe title of the journal; it was \'Bell\'s Life.\' A dirty copy, crumpled,\r\nand beer-stained, and emitting rank odours of inferior tobacco. It was\r\ndirected to Miss Floyd, in such sprawling penmanship as might have\r\ndisgraced the potboy of a sporting public-house:--\r\n\r\n     "Miss Floid,\r\n         fell dun wodes,\r\n              kent."\r\n\r\nThe newspaper had been redirected to Aurora by the housekeeper at\r\nFelden. Talbot ran his eye eagerly over the front page; it was almost\r\nentirely filled with advertisements (and such advertisements!), but in\r\none column there was an account headed, "Frightful Accident in Germany:\r\nan English Jockey killed."\r\n\r\nCaptain Bulstrode never knew why he read of this accident. It was in\r\nno way interesting to him, being an account of a steeple-chase in\r\nPrussia, in which a heavy English rider and a crack French horse had\r\nbeen killed. There was a great deal of regret expressed for the loss of\r\nthe horse, and none for the man who had ridden him, who, the reporter\r\nstated, was very little known in sporting circles; but in a paragraph\r\nlower down was added this information, evidently procured at the last\r\nmoment: "The jockey\'s name was Conyers."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAURORA\'S STRANGE PENSIONER.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchibald Floyd received the news of his daughter\'s choice with evident\r\npride and satisfaction. It seemed as if some heavy burden had been\r\ntaken away, as if some cruel shadow had been lifted from the lives of\r\nfather and daughter.\r\n\r\nThe banker took his family back to Felden Woods, with Talbot Bulstrode\r\nin his train; and the chintz rooms--pretty, cheerful chambers, with\r\nbow-windows that looked across the well-kept stable-yard into long\r\nglades of oak and beech--were prepared for the ex-hussar, who was to\r\nspend his Christmas at Felden.\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander and her husband were established with her family in the\r\nwestern wing; Mr. and Mrs. Andrew were located at the eastern angle;\r\nfor it was the hospitable custom of the old banker to summon his\r\nkinsfolk about him early in December, and to keep them with him till\r\nthe bells of picturesque Beckenham church had heralded in the New Year.\r\n\r\nLucy Floyd\'s cheeks had lost much of their delicate colour when she\r\nreturned to Felden, and it was pronounced, by all who observed the\r\nchange, that the air of the East Cliff, and the autumn winds drifting\r\nacross the bleak downs, had been too much for the young lady\'s strength.\r\n\r\nAurora seemed to have burst forth into some new and more glorious\r\nbeauty since the morning upon which she had accepted the hand of Talbot\r\nBulstrode. There was a proud defiance in her manner, which became her\r\nbetter than gentleness becomes far lovelier women. There was a haughty\r\n_insouciance_ about this young lady which gave new brilliancy to her\r\ngreat black eyes, and new music to her joyous laugh. She was like some\r\nbeautiful noisy, boisterous waterfall; for ever dancing, rushing,\r\nsparkling, scintillating, and utterly defying you to do anything but\r\nadmire it. Talbot Bulstrode, having once abandoned himself to the\r\nspell of the siren, made no further struggle, but fairly fell into\r\nthe pit-falls of her eyes, and was entangled in the meshy network of\r\nher blue-black hair. The greater the tension of the bow-string, the\r\nstronger the rebound thereof; and Talbot Bulstrode was as weak to give\r\nway at last as he had long been powerful to resist. I must write his\r\nstory in the commonest words. He could not help it! He loved her; not\r\nbecause he thought her better, or wiser, or lovelier, or more suited to\r\nhim than many other women,--indeed he had grave doubts upon every one\r\nof these points,--but because it was his destiny, and he loved her.\r\n\r\nWhat is that hard word which M. Victor Hugo puts into the mouth of\r\nthe priest in \'The Hunch-back of Notre Dame\' as an excuse for the\r\ndarkness of his sin? [Greek: ANANKE!] It was his fate! So he wrote to\r\nhis mother, and told her that he had chosen a wife, who was to sit in\r\nthe halls of Bulstrode, and whose name was to be interwoven with the\r\nchronicles of the house; told her, moreover, that Miss Floyd was a\r\nbanker\'s daughter, beautiful and fascinating, with big black eyes, and\r\nfifty thousand pounds for her dowry. Lady Raleigh Bulstrode answered\r\nher son\'s letter upon a quarter of a quire of note-paper, filled\r\nwith fearful motherly prayers and suggestions; anxious hopes that he\r\nhad chosen wisely; questionings as to the opinions and religious\r\nprinciples of the young lady,--much indeed that Talbot would have been\r\nsorely puzzled to answer. Enclosed in this was a letter to Aurora, a\r\nwomanly and tender epistle, in which pride was tempered with love,\r\nand which brought big tears welling up to Miss Floyd\'s eyes, until\r\nLady Bulstrode\'s firm penmanship grew blotted and blurred beneath the\r\nreader\'s vision.\r\n\r\nAnd whither went poor slaughtered John Mellish? He returned to\r\nMellish Park, carrying with him his dogs, and horses, and grooms,\r\nand phaeton, and paraphernalia; but his grief--having unluckily come\r\nupon him after the racing season--was too much for him, and he fled\r\naway from the roomy old mansion, with its pleasant surroundings of\r\npark and woodland; for Aurora Floyd was not for him, and it was all\r\nflat, stale, and unprofitable. So he went to Paris, or _Parry_, as\r\nhe called that imperial city, and established himself in the biggest\r\nchambers at Meurice\'s, and went backwards and forwards between that\r\nestablishment and Galignani\'s ten times a day, in quest of the English\r\npapers. He dined drearily at V\xe9four\'s, Philippe\'s, the Trois Fr\xe8res,\r\nthe Maison Dor\xe9e, and the Caf\xe9 de Paris. His big voice was heard at\r\nevery expensive dining place in Paris, ordering "_Toos killyar de\r\nmellyour: vous savez;_" but he sent the daintiest dishes away untasted,\r\nand would sit for a quarter of an hour counting the toothpicks in the\r\ntiny blue vases, and thinking of Aurora. He rode dismally in the Bois\r\nde Boulogne, and sat shivering in _caf\xe9s chantants_, listening to songs\r\nthat always seemed set to the same melody. He haunted the circuses,\r\nand was well-nigh in love with a fair _man\xe8ge_ rider, who had black\r\neyes, and reminded him of Aurora; till, upon buying the most powerful\r\nopera-glass that the Rue de Rivoli could afford, he discovered that\r\nthe lady\'s face was an inch deep in a certain white wash called _blanc\r\nrosati_, and that the chief glory of her eyes were the rings of Indian\r\nink which surrounded them. He could have dashed that double-barrelled\r\ntruth-revealer to the ground, and trodden the lenses to powder with his\r\nheel, in his passion of despair: better to have been for ever deceived,\r\nto have gone on believing that woman to be like Aurora, and to have\r\ngone to that circus every night until his hair grew white, but not with\r\nage, and until he pined away and died.\r\n\r\nThe party at Felden Woods was a very joyous one. The voices of\r\nchildren made the house pleasant; noisy lads from Eton and Westminster\r\nclambered about the balustrades of the staircases, and played\r\nbattledore-and-shuttlecock upon the long stone terrace. These young\r\npeople were all cousins to Aurora Floyd, and loved the banker\'s\r\ndaughter with a childish worship, which mild Lucy could never inspire.\r\nIt was pleasant to Talbot Bulstrode to see that wherever his future\r\nwife trod, love and admiration waited upon her footsteps. He was not\r\nsingular in his passion for this glorious creature, and it could be,\r\nafter all, no such terrible folly to love one who was beloved by all\r\nwho knew her. So the proud Cornishman was happy, and gave himself up to\r\nhis happiness without further protest.\r\n\r\nDid Aurora love him? Did she make him due return for the passionate\r\ndevotion, the blind adoration? She admired and esteemed him; she was\r\nproud of him--proud of that very pride in his nature which made him\r\nso different to herself; and she was too impulsive and truthful a\r\ncreature to keep this sentiment a secret from her lover. She revealed,\r\ntoo, a constant desire to please her betrothed husband, suppressing at\r\nleast all outward token of the tastes that were so unpleasant to him.\r\nNo more copies of \'Bell\'s Life\' littered the ladies\' morning-room at\r\nFelden; and when Andrew Floyd asked Aurora to ride to meet with him,\r\nhis cousin refused the offer which would once have been so welcome.\r\nInstead of following the Croydon hounds, Miss Floyd was content to\r\ndrive Talbot and Lucy in a basket-carriage through the frost-bespangled\r\ncountry-side. Lucy was always the companion and confidante of the\r\nlovers; it was hard for her to hear their happy talk of the bright\r\nfuture stretching far away before them--stretching down, down the\r\nshadowy aisles of Time, to an escutcheoned tomb at Bulstrode, where\r\nhusband and wife would lie down, full of years and honours, in the days\r\nto come. It was hard to have to help them plan a thousand schemes of\r\npleasure, in which--Heaven pity her!--she was to join. But she bore\r\nher cross meekly, this pale Elaine of modern days; and she never told\r\nTalbot Bulstrode that she had gone mad and loved him, and was fain to\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nTalbot and Aurora were both concerned to see the pale cheeks of their\r\ngentle companion; but everybody was ready to ascribe them to a cold, or\r\na cough, or constitutional debility, or some other bodily evil, which\r\nwas to be cured by drugs and boluses; and no one for a moment imagined\r\nthat anything could possibly be amiss with a young lady who lived in\r\na luxurious house, went shopping in a carriage and pair, and had more\r\npocket-money than she cared to spend. But the Lily Maid of Astolat\r\nlived in a lordly castle, and had doubtless ample pocket-money to buy\r\ngorgeous silks for her embroidery, and had little on earth to wish for,\r\nand nothing to do; whereby she fell sick for love of Sir Lancelot, and\r\npined and died.\r\n\r\nSurely the secret of many sorrows lies in this. How many a grief\r\nhas been bred of idleness and leisure! How many a Spartan youth has\r\nnursed a bosom-devouring fox for very lack of better employment! Do\r\nthe gentlemen who write the leaders in our daily journals ever die\r\nof grief? Do the barristers whose names appear in almost every case\r\nreported in those journals go mad for love unrequited? Did the Lady\r\nwith the lamp cherish any foolish passion in those days and nights of\r\nceaseless toil, in those long watches of patient devotion far away in\r\nthe East? Do the curates of over-crowded parishes, the chaplains of\r\ngaols and convict-ships, the great medical attendants in the wards of\r\nhospitals--do they make for themselves the griefs that kill? Surely\r\nnot. With the busiest of us there may be some holy moments, some sacred\r\nhour snatched from the noise and confusion of the revolving wheel of\r\nLife\'s machinery, and offered up as a sacrifice to sorrow and care; but\r\nthe interval is brief, and the great wheel rolls on, and we have no\r\ntime to pine or die.\r\n\r\nSo Lucy Floyd, having nothing better to do, nursed and made much of her\r\nhopeless passion. She set up an altar for the skeleton, and worshipped\r\nat the shrine of her grief; and when people told her of her pale face,\r\nand the family doctor wondered at the failure of his quinine mixture,\r\nperhaps she nourished a vague hope that before the spring-time came\r\nback again, bringing with it the wedding-day of Talbot and Aurora, she\r\nwould have escaped from all this demonstrative love and happiness, and\r\nbe at rest.\r\n\r\nAurora answered Lady Raleigh Bulstrode\'s letter with an epistle\r\nexpressive of such gratitude and humility, such earnest hope of winning\r\nthe love of Talbot\'s mother, mingled with a dim fearfulness of never\r\nbeing worthy of that affection, as won the Cornish lady\'s regard for\r\nher future daughter. It was difficult to associate the impetuous girl\r\nwith that letter, and Lady Bulstrode made an image of the writer that\r\nvery much differed from the fearless and dashing original. She wrote\r\nAurora a second letter, more affectionately worded than the first, and\r\npromised the motherless girl a daughter\'s welcome at Bulstrode.\r\n\r\n"Will she ever let me call her \'mother,\' Talbot?" Aurora asked, as she\r\nread Lady Bulstrode\'s second letter, to her lover. "She is very proud,\r\nis she not?--proud of your ancient descent? My father comes from a\r\nGlasgow mercantile family, and I do not even know anything about my\r\nmother\'s relations."\r\n\r\nTalbot answered her with a grave smile.\r\n\r\n"She will accept you for your native worth, dearest Aurora," he said,\r\n"and will ask no foolish questions about the pedigree of such a man as\r\nArchibald Floyd; a man whom the proudest aristocrat in England might\r\nbe glad to call his father-in-law. She will reverence my Aurora\'s\r\ntransparent soul and candid nature, and will bless me for the choice I\r\nhave made."\r\n\r\n"I shall love her very dearly if she will only let me. Should I have\r\never cared about horse-racing, and read sporting-papers, if I could\r\nhave called a good woman \'mother?\'"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to ask this question rather of herself than of Talbot.\r\n\r\nComplete as was Archibald Floyd\'s satisfaction at his daughter\'s\r\ndisposal of her heart, the old man could not calmly contemplate a\r\nseparation from this idolized daughter; so Aurora told Talbot that she\r\ncould never take up her abode in Cornwall during her father\'s lifetime;\r\nand it was finally arranged that the young couple were to spend half\r\nthe year in London, and the other half at Felden Woods. What need had\r\nthe lonely widower of that roomy mansion, with its long picture-gallery\r\nand snug suites of apartments, each of them large enough to accommodate\r\na small family? What need had one solitary old man of that retinue of\r\nservants, the costly stud in the stables, the new-fangled vehicles\r\nin the coach-houses, the hot-house flowers, the pines and grapes and\r\npeaches, cultivated by three Scottish gardeners? What need had he\r\nof these things? He lived principally in the study in which he had\r\nonce had a stormy interview with his only child; the study in which\r\nhung the crayon portrait of Eliza Floyd; the room which contained\r\nan old-fashioned desk he had bought for a guinea in his boyhood, and\r\nin which there were certain letters written by a hand that was dead,\r\nsome tresses of purple-black hair cut from the head of a corpse, and a\r\npasteboard ticket, printed at a little town in Lancashire, calling upon\r\nthe friends and patrons of Miss Eliza Percival to come to the theatre,\r\nfor her especial benefit, upon the night of August 20, 1837.\r\n\r\nIt was decided, therefore, that Felden Woods was to be the country\r\nresidence of Talbot and Aurora, till such time as the young man should\r\nsucceed to the baronetcy and Bulstrode Castle, and be required to\r\nlive upon his estate. In the mean time the ex-hussar was to go into\r\nParliament, if the electors of a certain little borough in Cornwall,\r\nwhich had always sent a Bulstrode to Westminster, should be pleased to\r\nreturn him.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was to take place early in May, and the honeymoon was to\r\nbe spent in Switzerland and at Bulstrode Castle. Mrs. Walter Powell\r\nthought that her doom was sealed, and that she would have to quit those\r\npleasant pastures after the wedding-day; but Aurora speedily set the\r\nmind of the ensign\'s widow at rest by telling her that as she, Miss\r\nFloyd, was utterly ignorant of housekeeping, she would be happy to\r\nretain her services after marriage as guide and adviser in such matters.\r\n\r\nThe poor about Beckenham were not forgotten in Aurora Floyd\'s morning\r\ndrives with Lucy and Talbot. Parcels of grocery and bottles of wine\r\noften lurked beneath the crimson-lined leopard-skin carriage-rug;\r\nand it was no uncommon thing for Talbot to find himself making a\r\nfootstool of a huge loaf of bread. The poor were very hungry in that\r\nbright December weather, and had all manner of complaints, which,\r\nhowever otherwise dissimilar, were all to be benefited by one especial\r\ntreatment; namely, half-sovereigns, old brown sherry, French brandy,\r\nand gunpowder tea. Whether the daughter was dying of consumption, or\r\nthe father laid up with the rheumatics, or the husband in a raging\r\nfever, or the youngest boy recovering from a fall into a copper of\r\nboiling water, the above-named remedies seemed alike necessary, and\r\nwere far more popular than the chicken-broths and cooling fever-drinks\r\nprepared by the Felden cook. It pleased Talbot to see his betrothed\r\ndispensing good things to the eager recipients of her bounty. It\r\npleased him to think how even his mother must have admired this\r\nhigh-spirited girl, content to sit down in close cottage chambers and\r\ntalk to rheumatic old women. Lucy distributed little parcels of tracts\r\nprepared by Mrs. Alexander, and flannel garments made by her own white\r\nhands; but Aurora gave the half-sovereigns and the old sherry; and I\'m\r\nafraid these simple cottagers liked the heiress best; although they\r\nwere wise enough and just enough to know that each lady gave according\r\nto her means.\r\n\r\nIt was in returning from a round of these charitable visits that an\r\nadventure befell the little party, which was by no means pleasing to\r\nCaptain Bulstrode.\r\n\r\nAurora had driven further than usual, and it was striking four as her\r\nponies dashed past Beckenham church and down the hill towards Felden\r\nWoods. The afternoon was cold and cheerless; light flakes of snow\r\ndrifted across the hard road, and hung here and there upon the leafless\r\nhedges, and there was that inky blackness in the sky which presages a\r\nheavy fall. The woman at the lodge ran out with her apron over her head\r\nto open the gates as Miss Floyd\'s ponies approached, and at the same\r\nmoment a man rose from a bank by the roadside, and came close up to the\r\nlittle carriage.\r\n\r\nHe was a broad-shouldered, stout-built fellow, wearing a shabby\r\nvelveteen cut-away coat, slashed about with abnormal pockets, and white\r\nand greasy at the seams and elbows. His chin was muffled in two or\r\nthree yards of dirty woollen comforter, after the fashion of his kind;\r\nand the band of his low-crowned felt hat was ornamented with a short\r\nclay pipe, coloured of a respectable blackness. A dingy white dog, with\r\na brass collar, bow legs, a short nose, blood-shot eyes, one ear, a\r\nhanging jaw, and a generally supercilious expression of countenance,\r\nrose from the bank at the same moment with his master, and growled\r\nominously at the elegant vehicle and the mastiff Bow-wow trotting by\r\nits side.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was the same individual who had accosted Miss Floyd in\r\nCockspur Street three months before.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether Aurora recognized this person; but I know that\r\nshe touched her ponies\' ears with the whip, and that the spirited\r\nanimals had dashed past the man, and through the gates of Felden,\r\nwhen he sprang forward, caught at their heads, and stopped the light\r\nbasket-carriage, which rocked under the force of his strong hand.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode leapt from the vehicle, heedless of his stiff leg, and\r\ncaught the man by the collar.\r\n\r\n"Let go that bridle!" he cried, lifting his cane; "how dare you stop\r\nthis lady\'s ponies?"\r\n\r\n"Because I wanted to speak to her, that\'s why. Let go o\' my coat, will\r\nyer?"\r\n\r\nThe dog made at Talbot\'s legs, but the young man whirled round his cane\r\nand inflicted such chastisement upon the snub nose of that animal as\r\nsent him into temporary retirement, howling dismally.\r\n\r\n"You are an insolent scoundrel, and I\'ve a good mind to----"\r\n\r\n"Yer\'d be hinserlent, p\'raps, if yer was hungry," answered the man,\r\nwith a pitiful whine, which was meant to be conciliating. "Such weather\r\nas this here\'s all very well for young swells such as you, as has your\r\ndawgs and guns and \'untin\'; but the winter\'s tryin\' to a poor man\'s\r\ntemper, when he\'s industrious and willin\', and can\'t get a stroke of\r\nhonest work to do, or a mouthful of vittals. I only want to speak to\r\nthe young lady; she knows me well enough."\r\n\r\n"Which young lady?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Floyd; the heiress."\r\n\r\nThey were standing a little way from the pony-carriage. Aurora had\r\nrisen from her seat and flung the reins to Lucy; she was looking\r\ntowards the two men, pale and breathless, doubtless terrified for the\r\nresult of the encounter.\r\n\r\nTalbot released the man\'s collar, and went back to Miss Floyd.\r\n\r\n"Do you know this person, Aurora?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"He is one of your old pensioners, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"He is; do not say anything more to him, Talbot. His manner is rough,\r\nbut he means no harm. Stop with Lucy while I speak to him."\r\n\r\nRapid and impetuous in all her movements, she sprang from the carriage\r\nand joined the man beneath the bare branches of the trees before Talbot\r\ncould remonstrate.\r\n\r\nThe dog, which had crawled slowly back to his master\'s side, fawned\r\nupon her as she approached, and was driven away by a fierce growl from\r\nBow-wow, who was little likely to brook any such vulgar rivalry.\r\n\r\nThe man removed his felt hat, and tugged ceremoniously at a tuft of\r\nsandyish hair which ornamented his low forehead.\r\n\r\n"You might have spoken to a cove without all this here row, Miss\r\nFloyd," he said, in an injured tone.\r\n\r\nAurora looked at him indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Why did you stop me here?" she said; "why couldn\'t you write to me?"\r\n\r\n"Because writin\'s never so much good as speakin\', and because such\r\nyoung ladies as you are uncommon difficult to get at. How did I know\r\nthat your pa mightn\'t have put his hand upon my letter, and there\'d\r\nhave been a pretty to do? though I dessay, as for that, if I was to\r\ngo up to the house, and ask the old gent for a trifle, he wouldn\'t be\r\nback\'ard in givin\' it. I dessay he\'d be good for a fi\'-pun note; or a\r\ntenner, if it came to that."\r\n\r\nAurora\'s eyes flashed sparks of fire as she turned upon the speaker.\r\n"If ever you dare to annoy my father you shall pay dearly for it,\r\nMatthew Harrison," she said; "not that _I_ fear anything you can say,\r\nbut I will not have him annoyed; I will not have him tormented. He\r\nhas borne enough, and suffered enough, Heaven knows, without that. I\r\nwill not have him harassed, and his best and tenderest feelings made a\r\nmarket of, by such as you. I will not!"\r\n\r\nShe stamped her foot upon the frosty ground as she spoke. Talbot\r\nBulstrode saw and wondered at the gesture. He had half a mind to leave\r\nthe carriage and join Aurora and her petitioner; but the ponies were\r\nrestless, and he knew that it would not do to abandon the reins to poor\r\ntimid Lucy.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t take on so, Miss Floyd," answered the man, whom Aurora had\r\naddressed as Matthew Harrison; "I\'m sure I want to make things pleasant\r\nto all parties. All I ask is that you\'ll act a little liberal to a cove\r\nwot\'s come down in the world since you see him last. Lord, wot a world\r\nit is for ups and downs! If it had been the summer season, I\'d have had\r\nno needs to worrit you; but what\'s the good of standin\' at the top of\r\nRegent Street such weather as this with tarrier-pups and such likes?\r\nOld ladies has no eye for dawgs in the winter; and even the gents as\r\ncares for rat-catching is gettin\' uncommon scarce. There aint nothink\r\ndoin\' on the turf whereby a chap can make a honest penny; nor won\'t\r\nbe, come the Craven Meetin\'. I\'d never have come anigh you, miss, if I\r\nhadn\'t been hard up; and I know you\'ll act liberal."\r\n\r\n"Act liberally!" cried Aurora. "Good heavens! if every guinea I have,\r\nor ever hope to have, could blot out the business that you trade upon,\r\nI\'d open my hands and let the money run through them as freely as so\r\nmuch water."\r\n\r\n"It was only good-natur\'d of me to send you that ere paper, though,\r\nmiss, eh?" said Mr. Matthew Harrison, plucking a dry twig from the tree\r\nnearest him, and chewing it for his delectation.\r\n\r\nAurora and the man had walked slowly onward as they spoke, and were by\r\nthis time at some distance from the pony-carriage.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode was in a fever of restless impatience.\r\n\r\n"Do you know this pensioner of your cousin\'s, Lucy?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t remember his face. I don\'t think he belongs to Beckenham."\r\n\r\n"Why, if I hadn\'t have sent you that ere \'Life,\' you wouldn\'t have\r\nknow\'d; would you now?" said the man.\r\n\r\n"No, no, perhaps not," answered Aurora. She had taken her porte-monnaie\r\nfrom her pocket, and Mr. Harrison was furtively regarding the little\r\nmorocco receptacle with glistening eyes.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t ask me about any of the particklars," he said.\r\n\r\n"No. What should I care to know of them?"\r\n\r\n"No, certently," answered the man, suppressing a chuckle; "you know\r\nenough, if it comes to that; and if you wanted to know any more, I\r\ncouldn\'t tell you; for them few lines in the paper is all I could ever\r\nget hold of about the business. But I allus said it, and I allus will;\r\nif a man as rides up\'ards of eleven stone----"\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if he were in a fair way of rambling on for ever so long,\r\nif Aurora had not checked him by an impatient frown. Perhaps he stopped\r\nall the more readily as she opened her purse at the same moment, and\r\nhe caught sight of the glittering sovereigns lurking between leaves\r\nof crimson silk. He had no very acute sense of colour; but I am sure\r\nthat he thought gold and crimson made a pleasing contrast, as he\r\nlooked at the yellow coin in Miss Floyd\'s porte-monnaie. She poured\r\nthe sovereigns into her own gloved palm, and then dropped the golden\r\nshower into Mr. Harrison\'s hands, which were hollowed into a species of\r\nhorny basin for the reception of her bounty. The great trunk of an oak\r\nscreened them from the observation of Talbot and Lucy, as Aurora gave\r\nthe man this money.\r\n\r\n"You have no claim on me," she said, stopping him abruptly, as he began\r\na declaration of his gratitude, "and I protest against your making\r\na market of any past events which have come under your knowledge.\r\nRemember, once and for ever, that I am not afraid of you; and that if I\r\nconsent to assist you, it is because I will not have my father annoyed.\r\nLet me have the address of some place where a letter may always find\r\nyou,--you can put it into an envelope and direct it to me here,--and\r\nfrom time to time I promise to send you a moderate remittance;\r\nsufficient to enable you to lead an honest life, if you, or any of your\r\nset, are capable of doing so; but I repeat, that if I give you this\r\nmoney as a bribe, it is only for my father\'s sake."\r\n\r\nThe man uttered some expression of thanks, looking at Aurora earnestly;\r\nbut there was a stern shadow upon the dark face that forbade any hope\r\nof conciliation. She was turning from him, followed by the mastiff,\r\nwhen the bandy-legged dog ran forward, whining and raising himself upon\r\nhis hind legs to lick her hand.\r\n\r\nThe expression of her face underwent an immediate change. She shrank\r\nfrom the dog, and he looked at her for a moment with a dim uncertainty\r\nin his blood-shot eyes; then, as conviction stole upon the brute mind,\r\nhe burst into a joyous bark, frisking and capering about Miss Floyd\'s\r\nsilk dress, and imprinting dusty impressions of his fore paws upon the\r\nrich fabric.\r\n\r\n"The pore hanimal knows yer, miss," said the man, deprecatingly; "you\r\nwas never \'aughty to \'im."\r\n\r\nThe mastiff Bow-wow made as if he would have torn up every inch of\r\nground in Felden Woods at this juncture; but Aurora quieted him with a\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n"Poor Boxer!" she said; "poor Boxer! so you know me, Boxer."\r\n\r\n"Lord, miss, there\'s no knowin\' the faithfulness of them animals."\r\n\r\n"Poor Boxer! I think I should like to have you. Would you sell him,\r\nHarrison?"\r\n\r\nThe man shook his head.\r\n\r\n"No, miss," he answered, "thank you kindly; there aint much in the\r\nway of dawgs as I\'d refuse to make a bargain about. If you wanted a\r\nmute spannel, or a Russian setter, or a Hile of Skye, I\'d get him\r\nfor you and welcome, and ask nothin\' for my trouble; but this here\r\nbull-tarrier\'s father and mother and wife and fambly to me, and there\r\naint money enough in your pa\'s bank to buy him, miss."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Aurora, relentingly, "I know how faithful he is.\r\nSend me the address, and don\'t come to Felden again."\r\n\r\nShe returned to the carriage, and taking the reins from Talbot\'s hand,\r\ngave the restless ponies their head; the vehicle dashed past Mr.\r\nMatthew Harrison, who stood hat in hand, with his dog between his legs,\r\nuntil the party had gone by. Miss Floyd stole a glance at her lover\'s\r\nface, and saw that Captain Bulstrode\'s countenance wore its darkest\r\nexpression. The officer kept sulky silence till they reached the house,\r\nwhen he handed the two ladies from the carriage and followed them\r\nacross the hall. Aurora was on the lowest step of the broad staircase\r\nbefore he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Aurora," he said, "one word before you go upstairs."\r\n\r\nShe turned and looked at him a little defiantly; she was still very\r\npale, and the fire with which her eyes had flashed upon Mr. Matthew\r\nHarrison, dog-fancier and rat-catcher, had not yet died out of the\r\ndark orbs. Talbot Bulstrode opened the door of a long chamber under\r\nthe picture-gallery--half billiard-room, half library, and almost the\r\npleasantest apartment in the house--and stood aside for Aurora to pass\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe young lady crossed the threshold as proudly as Marie Antoinette\r\ngoing to face her plebeian accusers. The room was empty.\r\n\r\nMiss Floyd seated herself in a low easy-chair by one of the two great\r\nfireplaces, and looked straight at the blaze.\r\n\r\n"I want to ask you about that man, Aurora," Captain Bulstrode said,\r\nleaning over a _prie-dieu_ chair, and playing nervously with the carved\r\narabesques of the walnut-wood framework.\r\n\r\n"About which man?"\r\n\r\nThis might have been prevarication in some women; from Aurora it was\r\nsimply defiance, as Talbot knew.\r\n\r\n"The man who spoke to you in the avenue just now. Who is he, and what\r\nwas his business with you?" Here Captain Bulstrode fairly broke down.\r\nHe loved her, reader, he loved her, remember, and he was a coward.\r\nA coward under the influence of that most cowardly of all passions,\r\nLOVE!--the passion that could leave a stain upon a Nelson\'s name; the\r\npassion which might have made a dastard of the bravest of the three\r\nhundred at Thermopyl\xe6, or the six hundred at Balaklava. He loved her,\r\nthis unhappy young man, and he began to stammer, and hesitate, and\r\napologize, shivering under the angry light in her wonderful eyes.\r\n"Believe me, Aurora, that I would not for the world play the spy upon\r\nyour actions, or dictate to you the objects of your bounty. No, Aurora,\r\nnot if my right to do so were stronger than it is, and I were twenty\r\ntimes your husband; but that man, that disreputable-looking fellow who\r\nspoke to you just now--I don\'t think he is the sort of person you ought\r\nto assist."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not," she said; "I have no doubt I assist many people who\r\nought by rights to die in a workhouse or drop on the high-road; but,\r\nyou see, if I stopped to question their deserts, they might die of\r\nstarvation while I was making my inquiries; so perhaps it\'s better to\r\nthrow away a few shillings upon some unhappy creature who is wicked\r\nenough to be hungry, and not good enough to deserve to have anything\r\ngiven him to eat."\r\n\r\nThere was a recklessness about this speech that jarred upon Talbot, but\r\nhe could not very well take objection to it; besides, it was leading\r\naway from the subject upon which he was so eager to be satisfied.\r\n\r\n"But that man, Aurora--who is he?"\r\n\r\n"A dog-fancier."\r\n\r\nTalbot shuddered.\r\n\r\n"I thought he was something horrible," he murmured; "but what, in\r\nHeaven\'s name, could he want of you, Aurora?"\r\n\r\n"What most of my petitioners want," she answered; "whether it\'s the\r\ncurate of a new chapel with medi\xe6val decorations, who wants to rival\r\nour Lady of Bons-secours upon one of the hills about Norwood; or a\r\nlaundress, who has burnt a week\'s washing, and wants the means to make\r\nit good; or a lady of fashion, who is about to inaugurate a home for\r\nthe children of indigent lucifer-match sellers; or a lecturer upon\r\npolitical economy, or Shelley and Byron, or upon Charles Dickens and\r\nthe Modern Humorists, who is going to hold forth at Croydon: they all\r\nwant the same thing; money! If I tell the curate that my principles are\r\nevangelical, and that I can\'t pray sincerely if there are candlesticks\r\non the altar, he is not the less glad of my hundred pounds. If I inform\r\nthe lady of fashion that I have peculiar opinions about the orphans\r\nof lucifer-match sellers, and cherish a theory of my own against the\r\neducation of the masses, she will shrug her shoulders deprecatingly,\r\nbut will take care to let me know that any donation Miss Floyd may be\r\npleased to afford will be equally acceptable. If I told them that I had\r\ncommitted half a dozen murders, or that I had a silver statue of the\r\nwinner of last year\'s Derby erected on an altar in my dressing-room,\r\nand did daily and nightly homage to it, they would take my money and\r\nthank me kindly for it, as that man did just now."\r\n\r\n"But one word, Aurora: does the man belong to this neighbourhood?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"How, then, did you come to know him?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for a moment; steadily, unflinchingly, with a\r\nthoughtful expression in that ever-changing countenance; looked as\r\nif she were mentally debating some point. Then rising suddenly, she\r\ngathered her shawl about her, and walked towards the door. She paused\r\nupon the threshold, and said--\r\n\r\n"This cross-questioning is scarcely pleasant, Captain Bulstrode. If I\r\nchoose to give a five-pound note to any person who may ask me for it,\r\nI expect full licence to do so; and I will not submit to be called to\r\naccount for my actions--even by you."\r\n\r\n"Aurora!"\r\n\r\nThe tenderly reproachful tone struck her to the heart.\r\n\r\n"You may believe, Talbot," she said,--"you must surely believe that I\r\nknow too well the value of your love to imperil it by word or deed--you\r\n_must_ believe this."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOR JOHN MELLISH COMES BACK AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Mellish grew weary of the great city of Paris. Better love,\r\nand contentment, and a crust in a _mansarde_, than stalled oxen or\r\nother costly food in the loftiest saloons _au premier_, with the most\r\nobsequious waiters to do us homage, repressing so much as a smile at\r\nour insular idiom. He grew heartily weary of the Rue de Rivoli, the\r\ngilded railings of the Tuileries gardens, and the leafless trees behind\r\nthem. He was weary of the Place de la Concorde, and the Champs Elys\xe9es,\r\nand the rattle of the hoofs of the troop about his Imperial Highness\'s\r\ncarriage, when Napoleon the Third, or the baby prince, took his airing.\r\nThe plot was yet a-hatching which was to come so soon to a climax in\r\nthe Rue Lepelletier. He was tired of the broad Boulevards, and the\r\ntheatres, and the caf\xe9s, and the glove-shops--tired of staring at the\r\njewellers\' windows in the Rue de la Paix, picturing to himself the face\r\nof Aurora Floyd under the diamond and emerald tiaras displayed therein.\r\nHe had serious thoughts at times of buying a stove and a basket of\r\ncharcoal, and asphyxiating himself quietly in the great gilded saloon\r\nat Meurice\'s. What was the use of his money, or his dogs, or his\r\nhorses, or his broad acres? All these put together would not purchase\r\nAurora Floyd. What was the good of life, if it came to that, since the\r\nbanker\'s daughter refused to share it with him? Remember that this big,\r\nblue-eyed, curly-haired John Mellish had been from his cradle a spoiled\r\nchild,--spoiled by poor relations and parasites, servants and toadies,\r\nfrom the first hour to the thirtieth year of his existence,--and it\r\nseemed such a very hard thing that this beautiful woman should be\r\ndenied to him. Had he been an eastern potentate, he would have sent\r\nfor his vizier, and would have had that official bow-strung before his\r\neyes, and so made an end of it; but being merely a Yorkshire gentleman\r\nand landowner, he had no more to do but to bear his burden quietly. As\r\nif he had ever borne anything quietly! He flung half the weight of his\r\ngrief upon his valet; until that functionary dreaded the sound of Miss\r\nFloyd\'s name, and told a fellow-servant in confidence that his master\r\n"made such a howling about that young woman as he offered marriage to\r\nat Brighton, that there was no bearing him." The end of it all was,\r\nthat one night John Mellish gave sudden orders for the striking of\r\nhis tents, and early the next morning departed for the Great Northern\r\nRailway, leaving only the ashes of his fires behind him.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural to suppose that Mr. Mellish would have gone\r\nstraight to his country residence, where there was much business to\r\nbe done by him: foals to be entered for coming races, trainers and\r\nstable-boys to be settled with, the planning and laying down of a\r\nproposed tan-gallop to be carried out, and a racing stud awaiting\r\nthe eye of the master. But instead of going from the Dover Railway\r\nStation to the Great Northern Hotel, eating his dinner, and starting\r\nfor Doncaster by the express, Mr. Mellish drove to the Gloucester\r\nCoffee-house, and there took up his quarters, for the purpose, as he\r\nsaid, of seeing the Cattle-show. He made a melancholy pretence of\r\ndriving to Baker Street in a Hansom cab, and roamed hither and thither\r\nfor a quarter of an hour, staring dismally into the pens, and then fled\r\naway precipitately from the Yorkshire gentlemen-farmers, who gave him\r\nhearty greeting. He left the Gloucester the next morning in a dog-cart,\r\nand drove straight to Beckenham. Archibald Floyd, who knew nothing of\r\nthis young Yorkshireman\'s declaration and rejection, had given him a\r\nhearty invitation to Felden Woods. Why shouldn\'t he go there? Only to\r\nmake a morning call upon the hospitable banker; not to see Aurora; only\r\nto take a few long respirations of the air she breathed before he went\r\nback to Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nOf course he knew nothing of Talbot Bulstrode\'s happiness; and it had\r\nbeen one of the chief consolations of his exile to remember that that\r\ngentleman had put forth in the same vessel, and had been shipwrecked\r\nalong with him.\r\n\r\nHe was ushered into the billiard-room, where he found Aurora Floyd\r\nseated at a little table near the fire, making a pencil copy of a proof\r\nengraving of one of Rosa Bonheur\'s pictures, while Talbot Bulstrode sat\r\nby her side preparing her pencils.\r\n\r\nWe feel instinctively that the man who cuts lead-pencils, or holds\r\na skein of silk upon his outstretched hands, or carries lap-dogs,\r\nopera-cloaks, camp-stools, or parasols, is "engaged." Even John Mellish\r\nhad learned enough to know this. He breathed a sigh so loud as to be\r\nheard by Lucy and her mother seated by the other fireplace,--a sigh\r\nthat was on the verge of a groan,--and then held out his hand to\r\nMiss Floyd. Not to Talbot Bulstrode. He had vague memories of Roman\r\nlegends floating in his brain, legends of superhuman generosity and\r\nclassic self-abnegation; but he could not have shaken hands with that\r\ndark-haired young Cornishman, though the tenure of the Mellish estate\r\nhad hung upon the sacrifice. He could not do it. He seated himself a\r\nfew paces from Aurora and her lover, twisting his hat about in his hot,\r\nnervous hands until the brim was well-nigh limp; and was powerless to\r\nutter one sentence, even so much as some poor pitiful remark about the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nHe was a great spoiled baby of thirty years of age; and I am afraid\r\nthat, if the stern truth must be told, he saw Aurora Floyd across a\r\nmist, that blurred and distorted the bright face before his eyes. Lucy\r\nFloyd came to his relief, by carrying him off to introduce him to her\r\nmother; and kind-hearted Mrs. Alexander was delighted with his frank,\r\nfair English face. He had the good fortune to stand with his back to\r\nthe light, so that neither of the ladies detected that foolish mist in\r\nhis blue eyes.\r\n\r\nArchibald Floyd would not hear of his visitor\'s returning to town\r\neither that night or the next day.\r\n\r\n"You must spend Christmas with us," he said, "and see the New Year\r\nin, before you go back to Yorkshire. I have all my children about me\r\nat this season, and it is the only time that Felden seems like an old\r\nman\'s home. Your friend Bulstrode stops with us" (Mellish winced as he\r\nreceived this intelligence), "and I sha\'n\'t think it friendly if you\r\nrefuse to join our party."\r\n\r\nWhat a pitiful coward this John Mellish must have been to accept\r\nthe banker\'s invitation, and send the Newport Pagnell back to the\r\nGloucester, and suffer himself to be led away by Mr. Floyd\'s own man\r\nto a pleasant chamber, a few doors from the chintz-rooms occupied by\r\nTalbot! But I have said before, that love is a cowardly passion. It is\r\nlike the toothache; the bravest and strongest succumb to it, and howl\r\naloud under the torture. I don\'t suppose the Iron Duke would have been\r\nashamed to own that he objected to having his teeth out. I have heard\r\nof a great fighting man who could take punishment better than any other\r\nof the genii of the ring, but who fainted away at the first grip of\r\nthe dentist\'s forceps. John Mellish consented to stay at Felden, and\r\nhe went between the lights into Talbot\'s dressing-room, to expostulate\r\nwith the captain upon his treachery.\r\n\r\nTalbot did his best to console his doleful visitant.\r\n\r\n"There are more women than one in the world," he said, after John had\r\nunbosomed himself of his grief--he didn\'t think this, the hypocrite,\r\nthough he said it--"there are more women than one, my dear Mellish; and\r\nthere are many very charming and estimable girls, who would be glad to\r\nwin the affections of such a fellow as you."\r\n\r\n"I hate estimable girls," said Mr. Mellish; "bother my affections!\r\nnobody will ever win my affections; but I love her, I love that\r\nbeautiful black-eyed creature down-stairs, who looks at you with two\r\nflashes of lightning, and rides like young Challoner in a cloth habit;\r\nI love her, Bulstrode, and you told me that she\'d refused you, and that\r\nyou were going to leave Brighton by the eight o\'clock express, and\r\nyou didn\'t; and you sneaked back and made her a second offer, and she\r\naccepted you, and, damme, it wasn\'t fair play."\r\n\r\nHaving said which, Mr. Mellish flung himself upon a chair, which\r\ncreaked under his weight, and fell to poking the fire furiously.\r\n\r\nIt was hard for poor Talbot to have to excuse himself for having won\r\nAurora\'s hand. He could not very well remind John Mellish that if Miss\r\nFloyd had accepted him, it was perhaps because she preferred him to the\r\nhonest Yorkshireman. To John the matter never presented itself in this\r\nlight. The spoiled child had been cheated out of that toy above all\r\nother toys, upon the possession of which he had set his foolish heart.\r\nIt was as if he had bidden for some crack horse at Tattersall\'s, in\r\nfair and open competition with a friend, who had gone back after the\r\nsale to outbid him in some underhand fashion. He could not understand\r\nthat there had been no dishonesty in Talbot\'s conduct, and he was\r\nhighly indignant when that gentleman ventured to hint to him that\r\nperhaps, on the whole, it would have been wiser to have kept away from\r\nFelden Woods.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode had avoided any further allusion to Mr. Matthew\r\nHarrison the dog-fancier; and this, the first dispute between the\r\nlovers, had ended in the triumph of Aurora.\r\n\r\nMiss Floyd was not a little embarrassed by the presence of John\r\nMellish, who roamed disconsolately about the big rooms, seating\r\nhimself ever and anon at one of the tables to peer into the lenses of\r\na stereoscope, or to take up some gorgeously-bound volume and drop it\r\non the carpet in gloomy absence of mind, and who sighed heavily when\r\nspoken to, and was altogether far from pleasant company. Aurora\'s warm\r\nheart was touched by the piteous spectacle of this rejected lover, and\r\nshe sought him out once or twice, and talked to him about his racing\r\nstud, and asked him how he liked the hunting in Surrey; but John\r\nchanged from red to white, and from hot to cold, when she spoke to him,\r\nand fled away from her with a scared and ghastly aspect, which would\r\nhave been grotesque had it not been so painfully real.\r\n\r\nBut by-and-by John found a more pitiful listener to his sorrows than\r\never Talbot Bulstrode had been; and this gentle and compassionate\r\nlistener was no other than Lucy Floyd, to whom the big Yorkshireman\r\nturned in his trouble. Did he know, or did he guess, by some wondrous\r\nclairvoyance, that her griefs bore a common likeness to his own, and\r\nthat she was just the one person, of all others at Felden Woods, to be\r\npitiful to him and patient with him? He was by no means proud, this\r\ntransparent, boyish, babyish good fellow. Two days after his arrival at\r\nFelden, he told all to poor Lucy.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you know, Miss Floyd," he said, "that your cousin rejected\r\nme. Yes, of course you do; I believe she rejected Bulstrode about the\r\nsame time; but some men haven\'t a ha\'porth of pride: I must say I think\r\nthe captain acted like a sneak."\r\n\r\nA sneak! Her idol, her adored, her demi-god, her dark-haired and\r\ngray-eyed divinity, to be spoken of thus! She turned upon Mr. Mellish\r\nwith her fair cheeks flushed into a pale glow of anger, and told him\r\nthat Talbot had a right to do what he had done, and that whatever\r\nTalbot did was right.\r\n\r\nLike most men whose reflective faculties are entirely undeveloped,\r\nJohn Mellish was blessed with a sufficiently rapid perception; a\r\nperception sharpened just then by that peculiar sympathetic prescience,\r\nthat marvellous clairvoyance of which I have spoken; and in those few\r\nindignant words, and that angry flush, he read poor Lucy\'s secret: she\r\nloved Talbot Bulstrode as he loved Aurora--hopelessly.\r\n\r\nHow he admired this fragile girl, who was frightened of horses and\r\ndogs, and who shivered if a breath of the winter air blew across the\r\nheated hall, and who yet bore her burden with this quiet, uncomplaining\r\npatience! while he, who weighed fourteen stone, and could ride forty\r\nmiles across country with the bitterest blasts of December blowing in\r\nhis face, was powerless to endure his affliction. It comforted him\r\nto watch Lucy, and to read in those faint signs and tokens, which\r\nhad escaped even a mother\'s eye, the sad history of her unrequited\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nPoor John was too good-natured and unselfish to hold out for ever\r\nin the dreary fortress of despair which he had built up for his\r\nhabitation; and on Christmas-eve, when there were certain rejoicings\r\nat Felden, held in especial honour of the younger visitors, he gave\r\nway, and joined in their merriment, and was more boyish than the\r\nyoungest of them, burning his fingers with blazing raisins, suffering\r\nhis eyes to be bandaged at the will of noisy little players at\r\nblindman\'s-buff, undergoing ignominious penalties in their games of\r\nforfeits, performing alternately innkeepers, sheriff\'s officers,\r\npolicemen, clergymen, and justices, in the acted charades, lifting\r\nthe little ones who wanted to see "de top of de Kitmat tee" in his\r\nsturdy arms, and making himself otherwise agreeable and useful to young\r\npeople of from three to fifteen years of age; until at last, under\r\nthe influence of all this juvenile gaiety, and perhaps two or three\r\nglasses of Moselle, he boldly kissed Aurora Floyd beneath the branch of\r\nmistletoe, hanging, "for this night only," in the great hall at Felden\r\nWoods.\r\n\r\nAnd having done this, Mr. Mellish fairly lost his wits, and was "off\r\nhis head" for the rest of the evening; making speeches to the little\r\nones at the supper-table, and proposing Mr. Archibald Floyd and the\r\ncommercial interests of Great Britain, with three times three; leading\r\nthe chorus of those tiny treble voices with his own sonorous bass; and\r\nweeping freely--he never quite knew why--behind his table-napkin. It\r\nwas through an atmosphere of tears, and sparkling wines, and gas, and\r\nhot-house flowers, that he saw Aurora Floyd, looking, ah, how lovely!\r\nin those simple robes of white which so much became her, and with a\r\ngarland of artificial holly round her head. The spiked leaves and the\r\nscarlet berries formed themselves into a crown--I think, indeed, that a\r\ncheese-plate would have been transformed into a diadem, if Miss Floyd\r\nhad been pleased to put it on her head--and she looked like the genius\r\nof Christmas: something bright and beautiful; too beautiful to come\r\nmore than once a year.\r\n\r\nWhen the clocks were striking 2 a.m., long after the little ones had\r\nbeen carried away muffled up in opera-cloaks, terribly sleepy, and I\'m\r\nafraid in some instances under the influence of strong drink,--when\r\nthe elder guests had all retired to rest, and the lights, with a few\r\nexceptions, were fled, the garlands dead, and all but Talbot and\r\nJohn Mellish departed, the two young men walked up and down the long\r\nbilliard-room, in the red glow of the two declining fires, and talked\r\nto each other confidentially. It was the morning of Christmas-day, and\r\nit would have been strange to be unfriendly at such a time.\r\n\r\n"If you\'d fallen in love with the other one, Bulstrode," said John,\r\nclasping his old school-fellow by the hand, and staring at him\r\npathetically, "I could have looked upon you as a brother; she\'s better\r\nsuited to you, twenty thousand times better adapted to you, than her\r\ncousin, and you ought to have married her--in common courtesy--I mean\r\nto say as an honourable--having very much compromised yourself by your\r\nattentions--Mrs. Whatshername--the companion--Mrs. Powell--said so--you\r\nought to have married her."\r\n\r\n"Married her! Married whom?" cried Talbot rather savagely, shaking off\r\nhis friend\'s hot grasp, and allowing Mr. Mellish to sway backward upon\r\nthe heels of his varnished boots in rather an alarming manner. "Who do\r\nyou mean?"\r\n\r\n"The sweetest girl in Christendom--except one," exclaimed John,\r\nclasping his hot hands and elevating his dim blue eyes to the ceiling;\r\n"the loveliest girl in Christendom, except one--Lucy Floyd."\r\n\r\n"Lucy Floyd!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lucy; the sweetest girl in----"\r\n\r\n"Who says that I ought to marry Lucy Floyd?"\r\n\r\n"She says so--no, no, I don\'t mean that! I mean," said Mr. Mellish,\r\nsinking his voice to a solemn whisper,--"I mean that Lucy Floyd loves\r\nyou! She didn\'t tell me so--oh, no, bless your soul,--she never uttered\r\na word upon the subject; but she loves you. Yes," continued John,\r\npushing his friend away from him with both hands, and staring at him as\r\nif mentally taking his pattern for a suit of clothes, "that girl loves\r\nyou, and has loved you all along. I am not a fool, and I give you my\r\nword and honour that Lucy Floyd loves you."\r\n\r\n"Not a fool!" cried Talbot; "you\'re worse than a fool, John\r\nMellish--you\'re drunk!"\r\n\r\nHe turned upon his heel contemptuously, and taking a candle from a\r\ntable near the door, lighted it, and strode out of the room.\r\n\r\nJohn stood rubbing his hands through his curly hair, and staring\r\nhelplessly after the captain.\r\n\r\n"This is the reward a fellow gets for doing a generous thing," he\r\nsaid, as he thrust his own candle into the burning coals, ignoring\r\nany easier mode of lighting it. "It\'s hard, but I suppose it\'s human\r\nnature."\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode went to bed in a very bad humour. Could it be true\r\nthat Lucy loved him? Could this chattering Yorkshireman have discovered\r\na secret which had escaped the captain\'s penetration? He remembered\r\nhow, only a short time before, he had wished that this fair-haired girl\r\nmight fall in love with him, and now all was trouble and confusion.\r\nGuinevere was lady of his heart, and poor Elaine was sadly in the way.\r\nMr. Tennyson\'s wondrous book had not been given to the world in the\r\nyear fifty-seven, or no doubt poor Talbot would have compared himself\r\nto the knight whose "honour rooted in dishonour stood." Had he been\r\ndishonourable? Had he compromised himself by his attentions to Lucy?\r\nHad he deceived that fair and gentle creature? The down pillows in the\r\nchintz chamber gave no rest to his weary head that night; and when he\r\nfell asleep in the late daybreak, it was to dream horrible dreams, and\r\nto see in a vision Aurora Floyd standing on the brink of a clear pool\r\nof water in a woody recess at Felden, and pointing down through its\r\ncrystal surface to the corpse of Lucy, lying pale and still amidst\r\nlilies and clustering aquatic plants, whose long tendrils entwined\r\nthemselves with the fair golden hair.\r\n\r\nHe heard the splash of the water in that terrible dream, and awoke, to\r\nfind his valet breaking the ice in his bath in the adjoining room. His\r\nperplexities about poor Lucy vanished in the broad daylight, and he\r\nlaughed at a trouble which must have grown out of his own vanity. What\r\nwas he, that young ladies should fall in love with him? What a weak\r\nfool he must have been to have believed for one moment in the drunken\r\nbabble of John Mellish! So he dismissed the image of Aurora\'s cousin\r\nfrom his mind, and had eyes, ears, and thought only for Aurora herself,\r\nwho drove him to Beckenham church in her basket-carriage, and sat by\r\nhis side in the banker\'s great square pew.\r\n\r\nAlas, I fear he heard very little of the sermon that was preached that\r\nday; but, for all that, I declare that he was a good and devout man: a\r\nman whom God had blest with the gift of earnest belief; a man who took\r\nall blessings from the hand of God reverently, almost fearfully; and as\r\nhe bowed his head at the end of that Christmas service of rejoicing and\r\nthanksgiving, he thanked Heaven for his overflowing cup of gladness,\r\nand prayed that he might become worthy of so much happiness.\r\n\r\nHe had a vague fear that he was too happy; too much bound up heart\r\nand soul in the dark-eyed woman by his side. If she were to die! If\r\nshe were to be false to him! He turned sick and dizzy at the thought;\r\nand even in that sacred temple the Devil whispered to him that there\r\nwere still pools, loaded pistols, and other certain remedies for such\r\ncalamities as those,--so wicked as well as cowardly a passion is this\r\nterrible fever, Love!\r\n\r\nThe day was bright and clear, the light snow whitening the ground;\r\nevery line of hedge-top and tree cut sharply out against the cold blue\r\nof the winter sky. The banker proposed that they should send home\r\nthe carriages, and walk down the hill to Felden; so Talbot Bulstrode\r\noffered Aurora his arm, only too glad of the chance of a _t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate_\r\nwith his betrothed.\r\n\r\nJohn Mellish walked with Archibald Floyd, with whom the Yorkshireman\r\nwas an especial favourite; and Lucy was lost amid a group of brothers,\r\nsisters, and cousins.\r\n\r\n"We were so busy all yesterday with the little people," said Talbot,\r\n"that I forgot to tell you, Aurora, that I had had a letter from my\r\nmother."\r\n\r\nMiss Floyd looked up at him with her brightest glance. She was always\r\npleased to hear anything about Lady Bulstrode.\r\n\r\n"Of course there is very little news in the letter," added Talbot, "for\r\nthere is rarely much to tell at Bulstrode. And yet--yes--there is one\r\npiece of news which concerns yourself."\r\n\r\n"Which concerns me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. You remember my cousin, Constance Trevyllian?"\r\n\r\n"Y-es--"\r\n\r\n"She has returned from Paris, her education finished at last, and\r\nshe, I believe, all-accomplished, and has gone to spend Christmas at\r\nBulstrode. Good heavens, Aurora! what is the matter?"\r\n\r\nNothing very much, apparently. Her face had grown as white as a\r\nsheet of letter-paper; but the hand upon his arm did not tremble.\r\nPerhaps, had he taken especial notice of it, he would have found it\r\npreternaturally still.\r\n\r\n"Aurora, what is the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. Why do you ask?"\r\n\r\n"Your face is as pale as----"\r\n\r\n"It is the cold, I suppose," she said, shivering. "Tell me about your\r\ncousin, this Miss Trevyllian; when did she go to Bulstrode Castle?"\r\n\r\n"She was to arrive the day before yesterday. My mother was expecting\r\nher when she wrote."\r\n\r\n"Is she a favourite of Lady Bulstrode\'s?"\r\n\r\n"No very especial favourite. My mother likes her well enough; but\r\nConstance is rather a frivolous girl."\r\n\r\n"The day before yesterday," said Aurora; "Miss Trevyllian was to arrive\r\nthe day before yesterday. The letters from Cornwall are delivered at\r\nFelden early in the afternoon; are they not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear."\r\n\r\n"You will have a letter from your mother today, Talbot."\r\n\r\n"A letter to-day! oh, no, Aurora, she never writes two days running;\r\nseldom more than once a week."\r\n\r\nMiss Floyd did not make any answer to this, nor did her face regain its\r\nnatural hue during the whole of the homeward walk. She was very silent,\r\nonly replying in the briefest manner to Talbot\'s inquiries.\r\n\r\n"I am sure that you are ill, Aurora," he said, as they ascended the\r\nterrace steps.\r\n\r\n"I am ill."\r\n\r\n"But, dearest, what is it? Let me tell Mrs. Alexander, or Mrs. Powell.\r\nLet me go back to Beckenham for the doctor."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a mournful earnestness in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"My foolish Talbot," she said, "do you remember what Macbeth said to\r\n_his_ doctor? There are diseases that cannot be ministered to. Let me\r\nalone; you will know soon enough--you will know very soon, I dare say."\r\n\r\n"But, Aurora, what do you mean by this? What can there be upon your\r\nmind?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, what indeed! Let me alone, let me alone, Captain Bulstrode."\r\n\r\nHe had caught her hand; but she broke from him, and ran up the\r\nstaircase, in the direction of her own apartments.\r\n\r\nTalbot hurried to Lucy, with a pale, frightened, face.\r\n\r\n"Your cousin is ill, Lucy," he said; "go to her, for Heaven\'s sake, and\r\nsee what is wrong."\r\n\r\nLucy obeyed immediately; but she found the door of Miss Floyd\'s room\r\nlocked against her; and when she called to Aurora, and implored to be\r\nadmitted, that young lady cried out--\r\n\r\n"Go away, Lucy Floyd! go away, and leave me to myself, unless you want\r\nto drive me mad!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TALBOT BULSTRODE SPENT HIS CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no more happiness for Talbot Bulstrode that day. He wandered\r\nfrom room to room, till he was as weary of that exercise as the young\r\nlady in Monk Lewis\'s \'Castle Spectre;\' he roamed forlornly hither and\r\nthither, hoping to find Aurora, now in the billiard-room, now in the\r\ndrawing-room. He loitered in the hall, upon the shallow pretence of\r\nlooking at barometers and thermometers, in order to listen for the\r\nopening and shutting of Aurora\'s door. All the doors at Felden Woods\r\nwere perpetually opening and shutting that afternoon, as it seemed to\r\nTalbot Bulstrode.\r\n\r\nHe had no excuse for passing the doors of Miss Floyd\'s apartments, for\r\nhis own rooms lay at the opposite angle of the house; but he lingered\r\non the broad staircase, looking at the furniture-pictures upon the\r\nwalls, and not seeing one line in these Wardour-Street productions. He\r\nhad hoped that Aurora would appear at luncheon; but that dismal meal\r\nhad been eaten without her; and the merry laughter and pleasant talk\r\nof the family assembly had sounded far away to Talbot\'s ears--far away\r\nacross some wide ocean of doubt and confusion.\r\n\r\nHe passed the afternoon in this wretched manner, unobserved by any\r\none but Lucy, who watched him furtively from her distant seat, as he\r\nroamed in and out of the drawing-room. Ah, how many a man is watched by\r\nloving eyes whose light he never sees! How many a man is cared for by a\r\ntender heart whose secret he never learns! A little after dusk, Talbot\r\nBulstrode went to his room to dress. It was some time before the bell\r\nwould ring; but he would dress early, he thought, so as to make sure of\r\nbeing in the drawing-room when Aurora came down.\r\n\r\nHe took no light with him, for there were always wax-candles upon the\r\nchimney-piece in his room.\r\n\r\nIt was almost dark in that pleasant chintz chamber, for the fire\r\nhad been lately replenished, and there was no blaze; but he could\r\njust distinguish a white patch upon the green-cloth cover of the\r\nwriting-table. The white patch was a letter. He stirred the black mass\r\nof coal in the grate, and a bright flame went dancing up the chimney,\r\nmaking the room as light as day. He took the letter in one hand, while\r\nhe lighted one of the candles on the chimney-piece with the other.\r\nThe letter was from his mother. Aurora Floyd had told him that he\r\nwould receive such a letter. What did it all mean? The gay flowers\r\nand birds upon the papered walls spun round him as he tore open the\r\nenvelope. I firmly believe that we have a semi-supernatural prescience\r\nof the coming of all misfortune; a prophetic instinct, which tells us\r\nthat such a letter, or such a messenger, carries evil tidings. Talbot\r\nBulstrode had that prescience as he unfolded the paper in his hands.\r\nThe horrible trouble was before him; a brooding shadow, with a veiled\r\nface, ghastly and undefined; but it was _there._\r\n\r\n"My dear Talbot,--I know that the letter I am about to write will\r\ndistress and perplex you; but my duty lies not the less plainly before\r\nme. I fear that your heart is much involved in your engagement to Miss\r\nFloyd." The evil tidings concerned Aurora, then; the brooding shadow\r\nwas slowly lifting its dark veil, and the face of her he loved best\r\non earth appeared behind it. "But I know," continued that pitiless\r\nletter, "that the sense of honour is the strongest part of your nature,\r\nand that, however you may have loved this girl" (O God, she spoke of\r\nhis love in the past!), "you will not suffer yourself to be entrapped\r\ninto a false position through any weakness of affection. There is some\r\nmystery about the life of Aurora Floyd."\r\n\r\nThis sentence was at the bottom of the first page; and before Talbot\r\nBulstrode\'s shaking hand could turn the leaf, every doubt, every\r\nfear, every presentiment he had ever felt, flashed back upon him with\r\npreternatural distinctness.\r\n\r\n"Constance Trevyllian came here yesterday; and you may imagine that\r\nin the course of the evening you were spoken of, and your engagement\r\ndiscussed."\r\n\r\nA curse upon their frivolous women\'s gossip! Talbot crushed the letter\r\nin his hand, and was about to fling it from him; but, no, it _must_\r\nbe read. The shadow of doubt must be faced, and wrestled with, and\r\nvanquished, or there was no more peace upon this earth for him. He\r\nwent on reading the letter.\r\n\r\n"I told Constance that Miss Floyd had been educated in the Rue\r\nSt.-Dominique, and asked if she remembered her. \'What!\' she said,\r\n\'is it the Miss Floyd whom there was such a fuss about? the Miss\r\nFloyd who ran away from school?\' And she told me, Talbot, that a Miss\r\nFloyd was brought to the Desmoiselles Lespard by her father last June\r\ntwelvemonth, and that less than a fortnight after arriving at the\r\nschool she disappeared; her disappearance of course causing a great\r\nsensation and an immense deal of talk among the other pupils, as it was\r\nsaid she had _run away_. The matter was hushed up as much as possible;\r\nbut you know that girls will talk, and from what Constance tells me,\r\nI imagine that very unpleasant things were said about Miss Floyd. Now\r\nyou say that the banker\'s daughter only returned to Felden Woods in\r\nSeptember last. _Where was she in the interval?_"\r\n\r\nHe read no more. One glance told him that the rest of the letter\r\nconsisted of motherly cautions, and admonitions as to how he was to act\r\nin this perplexing business.\r\n\r\nHe thrust the crumpled paper into his bosom, and dropped into a chair\r\nby the hearth.\r\n\r\nIt was so, then! There was a mystery in the life of this woman. The\r\ndoubts and suspicions, the undefined fears and perplexities, which\r\nhad held him back at the first, and caused him to wrestle against his\r\nlove, had not been unfounded. There was good reason for them all, ample\r\nreason for them; as there is for every instinct which Providence puts\r\ninto our hearts. A black wall rose up round about him, and shut him for\r\never from the woman he loved; this woman whom he loved, so far from\r\nwisely, so fearfully well; this woman, for whom he had thanked God in\r\nthe church only a few hours before. And she was to have been his wife;\r\nthe mother of his children, perhaps. He clasped his cold hands over his\r\nface and sobbed aloud. Do not despise him for those drops of anguish:\r\nthey were the virgin tears of his manhood. Never since infancy had his\r\neyes been wet before. God forbid that such tears as those should be\r\nshed more than once in a lifetime! The agony of that moment was not to\r\nbe lived through twice. The hoarse sobs rent and tore his breast as if\r\nhis flesh had been hacked by a rusty sword; and when he took his wet\r\nhands from his face, he wondered that they were not red; for it seemed\r\nto him as if he had been weeping blood. What should he do?\r\n\r\nGo to Aurora, and ask her the meaning of that letter? Yes; the course\r\nwas plain enough. A tumult of hope rushed back upon him, and swept away\r\nhis terror. Why was he so ready to doubt her? What a pitiful coward he\r\nwas to suspect her--to suspect this girl, whose transparent soul had\r\nbeen so freely unveiled to him; whose every accent was truth! For in\r\nhis intercourse with Aurora, the quality which he had learned most to\r\nreverence in her nature was its sublime candour. He almost laughed at\r\nthe recollection of his mother\'s solemn letter. It was so like these\r\nsimple country people, whose lives had been bounded by the narrow\r\nlimits of a Cornish village--it was so like them to make mountains out\r\nof the veriest mole-hills. What was there so wonderful in that which\r\nhad occurred? The spoiled child, the wilful heiress, had grown tired of\r\na foreign school, and had run away. Her father, not wishing the girlish\r\nescapade to be known, had placed her somewhere else, and had kept\r\nher folly a secret. What was there from first to last in the whole\r\naffair that was not perfectly natural and probable, the exceptional\r\ncircumstances of the case duly considered?\r\n\r\nHe could fancy Aurora, with her cheeks in a flame, and her eyes\r\nflashing lightning, flinging a page of blotted exercises into the face\r\nof her French master, and running out of the schoolroom, amid a tumult\r\nof ejaculatory babble. The beautiful, impetuous creature! There is\r\nnothing a man cannot admire in the woman he loves, and Talbot was half\r\ninclined to admire Aurora for having run away from school.\r\n\r\nThe first dinner-bell had rung during Captain Bulstrode\'s agony; so the\r\ncorridors and rooms were deserted when he went to look for Aurora, with\r\nhis mother\'s letter in his breast.\r\n\r\nShe was not in the billiard-room or the drawing-room, but he found\r\nher at last in a little inner chamber at the end of the house, with a\r\nbay-window looking out over the park. The room was dimly lighted by a\r\nshaded lamp, and Miss Floyd was seated in the uncurtained window, with\r\nher elbow resting on a cushioned ledge, looking out at the steel-cold\r\nwintry sky and the whitened landscape. She was dressed in black; her\r\nface, neck, and arms gleaming marble-white against the sombre hue of\r\nher dress; and her attitude was as still as that of a statue.\r\n\r\nShe neither stirred nor looked round when Talbot entered the room.\r\n\r\n"My dear Aurora," he said, "I have been looking for you everywhere."\r\n\r\nShe shivered at the sound of his voice.\r\n\r\n"You wanted to see me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dearest. I want you to explain something to me. A foolish\r\nbusiness enough, no doubt, my darling, and, of course, very easily\r\nexplained; but, as your future husband, I have a right to ask for an\r\nexplanation; and I know, I know, Aurora, that you will give it in all\r\ncandour."\r\n\r\nShe did not speak, although Talbot paused for some moments, awaiting\r\nher answer. He could only see her profile, dimly lighted by the wintry\r\nsky. He could not see the mute pain, the white anguish, in that\r\nyouthful face.\r\n\r\n"I have had a letter from my mother, and there is something in that\r\nletter which I wish you to explain. Shall I read it to you, dearest?"\r\n\r\nHis voice faltered upon the endearing expression, and he remembered\r\nafterwards that it was the last time he had ever addressed her with a\r\nlover\'s tenderness. The day came when she had need of his compassion,\r\nand when he gave it freely; but that moment sounded the death-knell of\r\nLove. In that moment the gulf yawned, and the cliffs were rent asunder.\r\n\r\n"Shall I read you the letter, Aurora?"\r\n\r\n"If you please."\r\n\r\nHe took the crumpled epistle from his bosom, and, bending over the\r\nlamp, read it aloud to Aurora. He fully expected at every sentence that\r\nshe would interrupt him with some eager explanation; but she was silent\r\nuntil he had finished, and even then she did not speak.\r\n\r\n"Aurora, Aurora, is this true?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly true."\r\n\r\n"But why did you run away from the Rue St.-Dominique?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you."\r\n\r\n"And where were you between the month of June in the year fifty-six and\r\nlast September?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you, Talbot Bulstrode. This is my secret, which I cannot\r\ntell you."\r\n\r\n"You cannot tell me! There is upwards of a year missing from your life;\r\nand you cannot tell me, your betrothed husband, what you did with that\r\nyear?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot."\r\n\r\n"Then, Aurora Floyd, you can never be my wife."\r\n\r\nHe thought that she would turn upon him, sublime in her indignation and\r\nfury, and that the explanation he longed for would burst from her lips\r\nin a passionate torrent of angry words; but she rose from her chair,\r\nand, tottering towards him, fell upon her knees at his feet. No other\r\naction could have struck such terror to his heart. It seemed to him\r\na confession of guilt. But what guilt? what guilt? What was the dark\r\nsecret of this young creature\'s brief life?\r\n\r\n"Talbot Bulstrode," she said, in a tremulous voice, which cut him\r\nto the soul,--"Talbot Bulstrode, Heaven knows how often I have\r\nforeseen and dreaded this hour. Had I not been a coward, I should\r\nhave anticipated this explanation. But I thought--I thought the\r\noccasion might never come; or that when it did come you would be\r\ngenerous--and--trust me. If you can trust me, Talbot; if you can\r\nbelieve that this secret is not utterly shameful----"\r\n\r\n"Not utterly shameful!" he cried. "O God! Aurora, that I should ever\r\nhear you talk like this! Do you think there are any degrees in these\r\nthings? There must be _no_ secret between my wife and me; and the day\r\nthat a secret, or the shadow of one, arises between us, must see us\r\npart for ever. Rise from your knees, Aurora; you are killing me with\r\nthis shame and humiliation. Rise from your knees; and if we are to part\r\nthis moment, tell me, tell me, for pity\'s sake, that I have no need\r\nto despise myself for having loved you with an intensity which has\r\nscarcely been manly."\r\n\r\nShe did not obey him, but sank lower in her half-kneeling,\r\nhalf-crouching attitude, her face buried in her hands, and only the\r\ncoils of her black hair visible to Captain Bulstrode.\r\n\r\n"I was motherless from my cradle, Talbot," she said, in a half-stifled\r\nvoice. "Have pity upon me."\r\n\r\n"Pity!" echoed the captain; "_pity!_ Why do you not ask me for\r\n_justice?_ One question, Aurora Floyd; one more question; perhaps the\r\nlast I ever may ask of you. Does your father know why you left that\r\nschool, and where you were during that twelvemonth?"\r\n\r\n"He does."\r\n\r\n"Thank God, at least, for that! Tell me, Aurora, then--only tell me\r\nthis, and I will believe your simple word as I would the oath of\r\nanother woman. Tell me if he approved of your motive in leaving that\r\nschool; if he approved of the manner in which your life was spent\r\nduring that twelvemonth. If you can say yes, Aurora, there shall be no\r\nmore questions between us, and I can make you without fear my loved and\r\nhonoured wife."\r\n\r\n"I cannot," she answered. "I am only nineteen; but within the two last\r\nyears of my life I have done enough to break my father\'s heart; to\r\nbreak the heart of the dearest father that ever breathed the breath of\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"Then all is over between us. God forgive you, Aurora Floyd; but by\r\nyour own confession you are no fit wife for an honourable man. I shut\r\nmy mind against all foul suspicions; but the past life of my wife must\r\nbe a white unblemished page, which all the world may be free to read."\r\n\r\nHe walked towards the door, and then, returning, assisted the wretched\r\ngirl to rise, and led her back to her seat by the window, courteously,\r\nas if she had been his partner at a ball. Their hands met with as icy\r\na touch as the hands of two corpses. Ah, how much there was of death\r\nin that touch! How much had died between those two within the last few\r\nhours!--hope, confidence, security, love, happiness; all that makes\r\nlife worth the holding.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode paused upon the threshold of the little chamber, and\r\nspoke once more.\r\n\r\n"I shall have left Felden in half an hour, Miss Floyd," he said; "it\r\nwill be better to allow your father to suppose that the disagreement\r\nbetween us has arisen from something of a trifling nature, and that my\r\ndismissal has come from you. I shall write to Mr. Floyd from London,\r\nand, if you please, I will so word my letter as to lead him to think\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"You are very good," she answered. "Yes, I would rather he should think\r\nthat. It may spare him pain. Heaven knows I have cause to be grateful\r\nfor anything that will do that."\r\n\r\nTalbot bowed and left the room, closing the door behind him. The\r\nclosing of that door had a dismal sound to his ear. He thought of some\r\nfrail young creature abandoned by her sister nuns in a living tomb. He\r\nthought that he would rather have left Aurora lying rigidly beautiful\r\nin her coffin than as he was leaving her to-day.\r\n\r\nThe jangling, jarring sound of the second dinner-bell clanged out,\r\nas he went from the semi-obscurity of the corridor into the glaring\r\ngaslight of the billiard-room. He met Lucy Floyd coming towards him\r\nin her rustling silk dinner-dress, with fringes and laces and ribbons\r\nand jewels fluttering and sparkling about her; and he almost hated\r\nher for looking so bright and radiant, remembering, as he did, the\r\nghastly face of the stricken creature he had just left. We are apt to\r\nbe horribly unjust in the hour of supreme trouble; and I fear that if\r\nany one had had the temerity to ask Talbot Bulstrode\'s opinion of Lucy\r\nFloyd just at that moment, the captain would have declared her to be a\r\nmass of frivolity and affectation. If you discover the worthlessness\r\nof the only woman you love upon earth, you will perhaps be apt to feel\r\nmaliciously disposed towards the many estimable people about you. You\r\nare savagely inclined, when you remember that they for whom you care\r\nnothing are so good, while she on whom you set your soul is so wicked.\r\nThe vessel which you freighted with every hope of your heart has gone\r\ndown; and you are angry at the very sight of those other ships riding\r\nso gallantly before the breeze. Lucy recoiled at the aspect of the\r\nyoung man\'s face.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she asked; "what has happened, Captain Bulstrode?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing--I have received a letter from Cornwall which obliges me\r\nto----"\r\n\r\nHis hollow voice died away into a hoarse whisper before he could finish\r\nthe sentence.\r\n\r\n"Lady Bulstrode--or Sir John--is ill perhaps?" hazarded Lucy.\r\n\r\nTalbot pointed to his white lips and shook his head. The gesture might\r\nmean anything. He could not speak. The hall was full of visitors and\r\nchildren going into dinner. The little people were to dine with their\r\nseniors that day, as an especial treat and privilege of the season.\r\nThe door of the dining-room was open, and Talbot saw the gray head of\r\nArchibald Floyd dimly visible at the end of a long vista of lights\r\nand silver and glass and evergreens. The old man had his nephews and\r\nnieces and their children grouped about him; but the place at his right\r\nhand, the place Aurora was meant to fill, was vacant. Captain Bulstrode\r\nturned away from that gaily-lighted scene and ran up the staircase to\r\nhis room, where he found his servant waiting with his master\'s clothes\r\nlaid out, wondering why he had not come to dress.\r\n\r\nThe man fell back at the sight of Talbot\'s face, ghastly in the light\r\nof the wax-candles on the dressing-table.\r\n\r\n"I am going away, Philman," said the captain, speaking very fast,\r\nand in a thick indistinct voice. "I am going down to Cornwall by the\r\nexpress to-night, if I can get to Town in time to catch the train.\r\nPack my clothes and come after me. You can join me at the Paddington\r\nStation. I shall walk up to Beckenham, and take the first train for\r\nTown. Here, give this to the servants for me, will you?"\r\n\r\nHe took a confused heap of gold and silver from his pocket, and dropped\r\nit into the man\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Nothing wrong at Bulstrode, I hope, sir?" said the servant. "Is Sir\r\nJohn ill?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; I\'ve had a letter from my mother--I--you\'ll find me at the\r\nGreat Western."\r\n\r\nHe snatched up his hat, and was hurrying from the room; but the man\r\nfollowed him with his greatcoat.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll catch your death, sir, on such a night as this," the servant\r\nsaid, in a tone of respectful remonstrance.\r\n\r\nThe banker was standing at the door of the dining-room when Talbot\r\ncrossed the hall. He was telling a servant to look for his daughter.\r\n\r\n"We are all waiting for Miss Floyd," the old man said; "we cannot begin\r\ndinner without Miss Floyd."\r\n\r\nUnobserved in the confusion, Talbot opened the great door softly, and\r\nlet himself out into the cold winter\'s night. The long terrace was\r\nall ablaze with the lights in the high narrow windows, as upon the\r\nnight when he had first come to Felden; and before him lay the park,\r\nthe trees bare and leafless, the ground white with a thin coating of\r\nsnow, the sky above gray and starless,--a cold and desolate expanse,\r\nin dreary contrast with the warmth and brightness behind. All this was\r\ntypical of the crisis of his life. He was leaving warm love and hope,\r\nfor cold resignation or icy despair. He went down the terrace-steps,\r\nacross the trim garden-walks and out into that wide, mysterious\r\npark. The long avenue was ghostly in the gray light, the tracery of\r\nthe interlacing branches above his head making black shadows, that\r\nflickered to and fro upon the whitened ground beneath his feet. He\r\nwalked for a quarter of a mile before he looked back at the lighted\r\nwindows behind him. He did not turn, until a bend in the avenue had\r\nbrought him to a spot from which he could see the dimly lighted\r\nbay-window of the room in which he had left Aurora. He stood for some\r\ntime looking at this feeble glimmer, and thinking--thinking of all he\r\nhad lost, or all he had perhaps escaped--thinking of what his life was\r\nto be henceforth without that woman--thinking that he would rather\r\nhave been the poorest ploughboy in Beckenham parish than the heir of\r\nBulstrode, if he could have taken the girl he loved to his heart, and\r\nbelieved in her truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGHTING THE BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new year began in sadness at Felden Woods, for it found Archibald\r\nFloyd watching in the sick-room of his only daughter.\r\n\r\nAurora had taken her place at the long dinner-table upon the night\r\nof Talbot\'s departure; and except for being perhaps a little more\r\nvivacious and brilliant than usual, her manner had in no way changed\r\nafter that terrible interview in the bay-windowed room. She had talked\r\nto John Mellish, and had played and sung to her younger cousins; she\r\nhad stood behind her father, looking over his cards through all the\r\nfluctuating fortunes of a rubber of long whist; and the next morning\r\nher maid had found her in a raging fever, with burning cheeks and\r\nblood-shot eyes, her long purple-black hair all tumbled and tossed\r\nabout the pillows, and her dry hands scorching to the touch. The\r\ntelegraph brought two grave London physicians to Felden before noon;\r\nand the house was clear of visitors by nightfall, only Mrs. Alexander\r\nand Lucy remaining to assist in nursing the invalid. The West-End\r\ndoctors said very little. This fever was as other fevers to them. The\r\nyoung lady had caught a cold perhaps; she had been imprudent, as these\r\nyoung people will be, and had received some sudden chill. She had very\r\nlikely overheated herself with dancing, or had sat in a draught, or\r\neaten an ice. There was no immediate danger to be apprehended. The\r\npatient had a superb constitution; there was wonderful vitality in the\r\nsystem; and with careful treatment she would soon come round. Careful\r\ntreatment meant a two-guinea visit every day from each of these learned\r\ngentlemen; though, perhaps, had they given utterance to their inmost\r\nthoughts, they would have owned that, for all they could tell to the\r\ncontrary, Aurora Floyd wanted nothing but to be let alone, and left\r\nin a darkened chamber to fight out the battle by herself. But the\r\nbanker would have had all Saville Row summoned to the sick-bed of his\r\nchild, if he could by such a measure have saved her a moment\'s pain;\r\nand he implored the two physicians to come to Felden twice a day\r\nif necessary, and to call in other physicians if they had the least\r\nfear for their patient. Aurora was delirious; but she revealed very\r\nlittle in that delirium. I do not quite believe that people often make\r\nthe pretty, sentimental, consecutive confessions under the influence\r\nof fever which are so freely attributed to them by the writers of\r\nromances. We rave about foolish things in those cruel moments of\r\nfeverish madness. We are wretched because there is a man with a white\r\nhat on in the room; or a black cat upon the counterpane; or spiders\r\ncrawling about the bed-curtains; or a coal-heaver who _will_ put a sack\r\nof coals on our chest. Our delirious fancies are like our dreams, and\r\nhave very little connection with the sorrows or joys which make up the\r\nsum of our lives.\r\n\r\nSo Aurora Floyd talked of horses and dogs, and masters and governesses;\r\nof childish troubles that had afflicted her years before, and of\r\ngirlish pleasures, which, in her normal state of mind, had been utterly\r\nforgotten. She seldom recognized Lucy or Mrs. Alexander, mistaking them\r\nfor all kinds of unlikely people; but she never entirely forgot her\r\nfather, and, indeed, always seemed to be conscious of his presence,\r\nand was perpetually appealing to him, imploring him to forgive her for\r\nsome act of childish disobedience committed in those departed years of\r\nwhich she talked so much.\r\n\r\nJohn Mellish had taken up his abode at the Grayhound Inn, in Croydon\r\nHigh Street, and drove every day to Felden Woods, leaving his phaeton\r\nat the park-gates, and walking up to the house to make his inquiries.\r\nThe servants took notice of the big Yorkshireman\'s pale face, and set\r\nhim down at once as "sweet" upon their young lady. They liked him a\r\ngreat deal better than Captain Bulstrode, who had been too "\'igh"\r\nand "\'aughty" for them. John flung his half-sovereigns right and\r\nleft when he came to the hushed mansion in which Aurora lay, with\r\nloving friends about her. He held the footman who answered the door\r\nby the button-hole, and would have gladly paid the man half-a-crown\r\na minute for his time while he asked anxious questions about Miss\r\nFloyd\'s health. Mr. Mellish was warmly sympathized with, therefore,\r\nin the servants\' hall at Felden. His man had informed the banker\'s\r\nhousehold how he was the best master in England, and how Mellish Park\r\nwas a species of terrestrial Paradise, maintained for the benefit of\r\ntrustworthy retainers; and Mr. Floyd\'s servants expressed a wish that\r\ntheir young lady might get well, and marry the "fair one," as they\r\ncalled John. They came to the conclusion that there had been what they\r\ncalled "a split" between Miss Floyd and the captain, and that he had\r\ngone off in a huff; which was like his impudence, seeing that their\r\nyoung lady would have hundreds of thousands of pounds by-and-by, and\r\nwas good enough for a duke instead of a beggarly officer.\r\n\r\nTalbot\'s letter to Mr. Floyd reached Felden Woods on the 27th of\r\nDecember; but it lay for some time unopened upon the library table.\r\nArchibald had scarcely heeded his intended son-in-law\'s disappearance,\r\nin his anxiety about Aurora. When he did open the letter, Captain\r\nBulstrode\'s words were almost meaningless to him, though he was just\r\nable to gather that the engagement had been broken,--by his daughter\'s\r\nwish, as Talbot seemed to infer.\r\n\r\nThe banker\'s reply to this communication was very brief; he wrote:\r\n\r\n      "MY DEAR SIR,--Your letter arrived here some days since, but\r\n      has only been opened by me this morning. I have laid it aside,\r\n      to be replied to, D.V., at a future time. At present I am\r\n      unable to attend to anything. My daughter is seriously ill.\r\n\r\n                                   "Yours obediently,\r\n                                              "ARCHIBALD FLOYD."\r\n\r\n"Seriously ill!" Talbot Bulstrode sat for nearly an hour with the\r\nbanker\'s letter in his hand, looking at those two words. How much\r\nor how little might the sentence mean? At one moment, remembering\r\nArchibald Floyd\'s devotion to his daughter, he thought that this\r\nserious illness was doubtless some very trifling business,--some\r\nfeminine nervous attack, common to young ladies upon any hitch in their\r\nlove affairs; but five minutes afterwards he fancied that those words\r\nhad an awful meaning--that Aurora was dying; dying of the shame and\r\nanguish of that interview in the little chamber at Felden.\r\n\r\nHeaven above! what had he done? Had he murdered this beautiful\r\ncreature, whom he loved a million times better than himself? Had he\r\nkilled her with those impalpable weapons, those sharp and cruel words\r\nwhich he had spoken on the 25th of December? He acted the scene over\r\nagain and again, until the sense of outraged honour, then so strong\r\nupon him, seemed to grow dim and confused; and he began almost to\r\nwonder why he had quarrelled with Aurora. What if, after all, this\r\nsecret involved only some school-girl\'s folly? No; the crouching figure\r\nand ghastly face gave the lie to that hope. The secret, whatever it\r\nmight be, was a matter of life and death to Aurora Floyd. He dared\r\nnot try to guess what it was. He strove to close his mind against the\r\nsurmises that would arise to him. In the first days that succeeded that\r\nterrible Christmas he determined to leave England. He would try to\r\nget some Government appointment that would take him away to the other\r\nend of the world, where he could never hear Aurora\'s name--never be\r\nenlightened as to the mystery that had separated them. But now, now\r\nthat she was ill,--in danger, perhaps,--how could he leave the country?\r\nHow could he go away to some place where he might one day open the\r\nEnglish newspapers and see her name among the list of deaths?\r\n\r\nTalbot was a dreary guest at Bulstrode Castle. His mother and his\r\ncousin Constance respected his pale face, and held themselves aloof\r\nfrom him in fear and trembling; but his father asked what the deuce\r\nwas the matter with the boy, that he looked so chapfallen, and why he\r\ndidn\'t take his gun and go out on the moors, and get an appetite for\r\nhis dinner, like a Christian, instead of moping in his own rooms all\r\nday long, biting his fingers\' ends.\r\n\r\nOnce, and once only, did Lady Bulstrode allude to Aurora Floyd.\r\n\r\n"You asked Miss Floyd for an explanation, I suppose, Talbot?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mother."\r\n\r\n"And the result?"\r\n\r\n"Was the termination of our engagement. I had rather you would not\r\nspeak to me of this subject again, if you please, mother."\r\n\r\nTalbot took his gun, and went out upon the moors, as his father\r\nadvised; but it was not to slaughter the last of the pheasants, but\r\nto think in peace of Aurora Floyd, that the young man went out.\r\nThe low-lying clouds upon the moorlands seemed to shut him in like\r\nprison-walls. How many miles of desolate country lay between the dark\r\nexpanse on which he stood and the red-brick mansion at Felden!--how\r\nmany leafless hedge-rows!--how many frozen streams! It was only a day\'s\r\njourney, certainly, by the Great Western; but there was something cruel\r\nin the knowledge that half the length of England lay between the\r\nKentish woods and that far angle of the British Isles upon which Castle\r\nBulstrode reared its weather-beaten walls. The wail of mourning voices\r\nmight be loud in Kent, and not a whisper of death reach the listening\r\nears in Cornwall. How he envied the lowest servant at Felden, who knew\r\nday by day and hour by hour of the progress of the battle between Death\r\nand Aurora Floyd! And yet, after all, what was she to him? What did it\r\nmatter to him if she were well or ill? The grave could never separate\r\nthem more utterly than they had been separated from the very moment in\r\nwhich he discovered that she was not worthy to be his wife. He had done\r\nher no wrong; he had given her a full and fair opportunity of clearing\r\nherself from the doubtful shadow on her name; and she had been unable\r\nto do so. Nay, more, she had given him every reason to suppose, by her\r\nmanner, that the shadow was even a darker one than he had feared. Was\r\nhe to blame, then? Was it his fault if she were ill? Were his days to\r\nbe misery, and his nights a burden because of her? He struck the stock\r\nof his gun violently upon the ground at the thought, and thrust the\r\nramrod down the barrel, and loaded his fowling-piece furiously with\r\nnothing; and then, casting himself at full length upon the stunted\r\nturf, lay there till the early dusk closed in about him, and the soft\r\nevening dew saturated his shooting-coat, and he was in a fair way to be\r\nstricken with rheumatic fever.\r\n\r\nI might fill chapters with the foolish sufferings of this young man;\r\nbut I fear he must have become very wearisome to my afflicted readers;\r\nto those, at least, who have never suffered from this fever. The\r\nsharper the disease, the shorter its continuance; so Talbot will be\r\nbetter by-and-by, and will look back at his old self, and laugh at his\r\nold agonies. Surely this inconstancy of ours is the worst of all--this\r\nfickleness, by reason of which we cast off our former selves with no\r\nmore compunction than we feel in flinging away a worn-out garment. Our\r\npoor threadbare selves, the shadows of what we were! With what sublime,\r\npatronizing pity, with what scornful compassion, we look back upon the\r\nhelpless dead and gone creatures, and wonder that anything so foolish\r\ncould have been allowed to cumber the earth! Shall I feel the same\r\ncontempt ten years hence for myself as I am to-day, as I feel today\r\nfor myself as I was ten years ago? Will the loves and aspirations, the\r\nbeliefs and desires of to-day, appear as pitiful then as the dead loves\r\nand dreams of the bygone decade? Shall I look back in pitying wonder,\r\nand think what a fool that young man was, although there was something\r\ncandid and innocent in his very stupidity, after all? Who can wonder\r\nthat the last visit to Paris killed Voltaire? Fancy the octogenarian\r\nlooking round the national theatre, and seeing himself, through an\r\nendless vista of dim years, a young man again, paying his court to a\r\n"goat-faced cardinal," and being beaten by De Rohan\'s lackeys in broad\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nHave you ever visited some still country town after a lapse of years,\r\nand wondered, O fast-living reader! to find the people you knew in\r\nyour last visit still alive and thriving, with hair unbleached as\r\nyet, although you have lived and suffered whole centuries since then?\r\nSurely Providence gives us this sublimely egotistical sense of Time\r\nas a set-off against the brevity of our lives! I might make this book\r\na companion in bulk to the Catalogue of the British Museum, if I were\r\nto tell all that Talbot Bulstrode felt and suffered in the month of\r\nJanuary, 1858,--if I were to anatomize the doubts and confusions and\r\nself-contradictions, the mental resolutions made one moment to be\r\nbroken the next. I refrain, therefore, and will set down nothing but\r\nthe fact, that on a certain Sunday midway in the month, the captain,\r\nsitting in the family pew at Bulstrode church, directly facing the\r\nmonument of Admiral Hartley Bulstrode, who fought and died in the\r\ndays of Queen Elizabeth, registered a silent oath that, as he was a\r\ngentleman and a Christian, he would henceforth abstain from holding any\r\nvoluntary communication with Aurora Floyd. But for this vow he must\r\nhave broken down, and yielded to his yearning fear and love, and gone\r\nto Felden Woods to throw himself, blind and unquestioning, at the feet\r\nof the sick woman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tender green of the earliest leaflets was breaking out in bright\r\npatches upon the hedge-rows round Felden Woods; the ash-buds were no\r\nlonger black upon the front of March, and pale violets and primroses\r\nmade exquisite tracery in the shady nooks beneath the oaks and beeches.\r\nAll nature was rejoicing in the mild April weather, when Aurora lifted\r\nher dark eyes to her father\'s face with something of their old look\r\nand familiar light. The battle had been a long and severe one; but it\r\nwas well-nigh over now, the physicians said. Defeated Death drew back\r\nfor a while, to wait a better opportunity for making his fatal spring;\r\nand the feeble victor was to be carried down-stairs to sit in the\r\ndrawing-room for the first time since the night of December the 25th.\r\n\r\nJohn Mellish, happening to be at Felden that day, was allowed the\r\nsupreme privilege of carrying the fragile burden in his strong arms,\r\nfrom the door of the sick chamber to the great sofa by the fire in\r\nthe drawing-room; attended by a procession of happy people bearing\r\nshawls and pillows, vinaigrettes and scent-bottles, and other invalid\r\nparaphernalia. Every creature at Felden was devoted to this adored\r\nconvalescent. Archibald Floyd lived only to minister to her; gentle\r\nLucy waited on her night and day, fearful to trust the service to\r\nmenial hands; Mrs. Powell, like some pale and quiet shadow, lurked\r\namidst the bed-curtains, soft of foot and watchful of eye, invaluable\r\nin the sick-chamber, as the doctors said. Throughout her illness,\r\nAurora had never mentioned the name of Talbot Bulstrode. Not even\r\nwhen the fever was at its worst, and the brain most distraught, had\r\nthat familiar name escaped her lips. Other names, strange to Lucy, had\r\nbeen repeated by her again and again: the names of places and horses\r\nand slangy technicalities of the turf, had interlarded the poor girl\'s\r\nbrain-sick babble; but whatever were her feelings with regard to\r\nTalbot, no word had revealed their depth or sadness. Yet I do not think\r\nthat my poor dark-eyed heroine was utterly feelingless upon this point.\r\nWhen they first spoke of carrying her down-stairs, Mrs. Powell and Lucy\r\nproposed the little bay-windowed chamber, which was small and snug, and\r\nhad a southern aspect, as the fittest place for the invalid; but Aurora\r\ncried out shuddering, that she would never enter that hateful chamber\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAs soon as ever she was strong enough to bear the fatigue of the\r\njourney, it was considered advisable to remove her from Felden; and\r\nLeamington was suggested by the doctors as the best place for the\r\nchange. A mild climate and a pretty inland retreat, a hushed and quiet\r\ntown, peculiarly adapted to invalids, being almost deserted by other\r\nvisitors after the hunting season.\r\n\r\nShakespeare\'s birthday had come and gone, and the high festivals at\r\nStratford were over, when Archibald Floyd took his pale daughter to\r\nLeamington. A furnished cottage had been engaged for them a mile and\r\na half out of the town; a pretty place, half villa, half farmhouse,\r\nwith walls of white plaster chequered with beams of black wood, and\r\nwell-nigh buried in a luxuriant and trimly-kept flower-garden; a\r\npleasant place, forming one of a little cluster of rustic buildings\r\ncrowded about a gray old church in a nook of the roadway, where two\r\nor three green lanes met, and went branching off between overhanging\r\nhedges; a most retired spot, yet clamorous with that noise which is of\r\nall others cheerful and joyous,--the hubbub of farmyards, the cackle of\r\npoultry, the cooing of pigeons, the monotonous lowing of lazy cattle,\r\nand the squabbling grunt of quarrelsome pigs. Archibald could not have\r\nbrought his daughter to a better place. The chequered farmhouse seemed\r\na haven of rest to this poor weary girl of nineteen. It was so pleasant\r\nto lie wrapped in shawls, on a chintz-covered sofa, in the open window,\r\nlistening to the rustic noises in the straw-littered yard upon the\r\nother side of the hedge, with her faithful Bow-wow\'s big fore-paws\r\nresting on the cushions at her feet. The sounds in the farmyard were\r\npleasanter to Aurora than the monotonous inflections of Mrs. Powell\'s\r\nvoice; but as that lady considered it a part of her duty to read aloud\r\nfor the invalid\'s delectation, Miss Floyd was too good-natured to own\r\nhow tired she was of \'Marmion\' and \'Childe Harold,\' \'Evangeline,\' and\r\n\'The Queen of the May,\' and how she would have preferred in her present\r\nstate of mind to listen to a lively dispute between a brood of ducks\r\nround the pond in the farmyard, or a trifling discussion in the pigsty,\r\nto the sublimest lines ever penned by poet, living or dead. The poor\r\ngirl had suffered very much, and there was a certain sensuous, lazy\r\npleasure in this slow recovery, this gradual return to strength. Her\r\nown nature revived in unison with the bright revival of the genial\r\nsummer weather. As the trees in the garden put forth new strength and\r\nbeauty, so the glorious vitality of her constitution returned with\r\nmuch of its wonted power. The bitter blows had left their scars behind\r\nthem, but they had not killed her, after all. They had not utterly\r\nchanged her even, for glimpses of the old Aurora appeared day by day\r\nin the pale convalescent; and Archibald Floyd, whose life was at best\r\nbut a reflected existence, felt his hopes revive as he looked at his\r\ndaughter. Lucy and her mother had gone back to the villa at Fulham,\r\nand to their own family duties; so the Leamington party consisted\r\nonly of Aurora and her father, and that pale shadow of propriety, the\r\nensign\'s light-haired widow. But they were not long without a visitor.\r\nJohn Mellish, artfully taking the banker at a disadvantage in some\r\nmoment of flurry and confusion at Felden Woods, had extorted from him\r\nan invitation to Leamington; and a fortnight after their arrival he\r\npresented his stalwart form and fair face at the low wooden gates of\r\nthe chequered cottage. Aurora laughed (for the first time since her\r\nillness) as she saw that faithful adorer come, carpet-bag in hand,\r\nthrough the labyrinth of grass and flower-beds towards the open window\r\nat which she and her father sat; and Archibald, seeing that first\r\ngleam of gaiety in the beloved face, could have hugged John Mellish\r\nfor being the cause of it. He would have embraced a street tumbler, or\r\nthe low comedian of a booth at a fair, or a troop of performing dogs\r\nand monkeys, or anything upon earth that could win a smile from his\r\nsick child. Like the Eastern potentate in the fairy tale, who always\r\noffers half his kingdom and his daughter\'s hand to any one who can cure\r\nthe princess of her bilious headache, or extract her carious tooth,\r\nArchibald would have opened a banking account in Lombard Street, with a\r\nfabulous sum to start with, for any one who could give pleasure to this\r\nblack-eyed girl, now smiling, for the first time in that year, at sight\r\nof the big fair-faced Yorkshireman coming to pay his foolish worship at\r\nher shrine.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be supposed that Mr. Floyd had felt no wonder as to the\r\ncause of the rupture of his daughter\'s engagement to Talbot Bulstrode.\r\nThe anguish and terror endured by him during her long illness had\r\nleft no room for any other thought; but since the passing away of the\r\ndanger, he had pondered not a little upon the abrupt rupture between\r\nthe lovers. He ventured once, in the first week of their stay at\r\nLeamington, to speak to her upon the subject, asking why it was she\r\nhad dismissed the captain. Now if there was one thing more hateful\r\nthan another to Aurora Floyd, it was a lie. I do not say that she had\r\nnever told one in the course of her life. There are some acts of folly\r\nwhich carry falsehood and dissimulation at their heels as certainly as\r\nthe shadows which follow us when we walk towards the evening sun; and\r\nwe very rarely swerve from the severe boundary-line of right without\r\nbeing dragged ever so much farther than we calculated upon across the\r\nborder. Alas! my heroine is not faultless. She would take her shoes off\r\nto give them to the barefooted poor; she would take the heart from her\r\nbreast, if she could by so doing heal the wounds she has inflicted upon\r\nthe loving heart of her father. But a shadow of mad folly has blotted\r\nher motherless youth, and she has a terrible harvest to reap from that\r\nlightly-sown seed, and a cruel expiation to make for that unforgotten\r\nwrong. Yet her natural disposition is all truth and candour; and there\r\nare many young ladies, whose lives have been as primly ruled and\r\nordered as the fair pleasure-gardens of a Tyburnian square, who could\r\ntell a falsehood with a great deal better grace than Aurora Floyd. So\r\nwhen her father asked her why she had _dismissed_ Talbot Bulstrode, she\r\nmade no answer to that question; but simply told him that the quarrel\r\nhad been a very painful one, and that she hoped never to hear the\r\ncaptain\'s name again: although at the same time she assured Mr. Floyd\r\nthat her lover\'s conduct had been in nowise unbecoming a gentleman\r\nand a man of honour. Archibald implicitly obeyed his daughter in this\r\nmatter, and the name of Talbot Bulstrode never being spoken, it seemed\r\nas if the young man had dropped out of their lives, or as if he had\r\nnever had any part in the destiny of Aurora Floyd. Heaven knows what\r\nAurora herself felt and suffered in the quiet of her low-roofed,\r\nwhite-curtained little chamber, with the soft May moonlight stealing in\r\nat the casement-windows, and creeping in wan radiance about the walls.\r\nHeaven only knows the bitterness of the silent battle. Her vitality\r\nmade her strong to suffer; her vivid imagination intensified every\r\nthrob of pain. In a dull and torpid soul grief is a slow anguish; but\r\nwith her it was a fierce and tempestuous emotion, in which past and\r\nfuture seemed rolled together with the present to make a concentrated\r\nagony. But, by an all-wise dispensation, the stormy sorrow wears itself\r\nout by reason of its very violence, while the dull woe drags its slow\r\nlength sometimes through weary years, becoming at last engrafted in\r\nthe very nature of the patient sufferer, as some diseases become part\r\nof our constitutions. Aurora was fortunate in being permitted to fight\r\nher battle in silence, and to suffer unquestioned. If the dark hollow\r\nrings about her eyes told of sleepless nights, Archibald Floyd forbore\r\nto torment her with anxious speeches and trite consolations. The\r\nclairvoyance of love told him that it was better to let her alone. So\r\nthe trouble hanging over the little circle was neither seen nor spoken\r\nof. Aurora kept her skeleton in some quiet corner, and no one saw the\r\ngrim skull, or heard the rattle of the dry bones. Archibald Floyd read\r\nhis newspapers, and wrote his letters; Mrs. Walter Powell tended the\r\nconvalescent, who reclined during the best part of the day on the sofa\r\nin the open window; and John Mellish loitered about the garden and\r\nthe farmyard, leaned on the low white gate, smoking his cigar, and\r\ntalking to the men about the place, and was in and out of the house\r\ntwenty times in an hour. The banker pondered sometimes in serio-comic\r\nperplexity as to what was to be done with this big Yorkshireman, who\r\nhung upon him like a good-natured monster of six feet two, conjured\r\ninto existence by the hospitality of a modern Frankenstein. He had\r\ninvited him to dinner, and, lo, he appeared to be saddled with him for\r\nlife. He could not tell the friendly, generous, loud-spoken creature\r\nto go away. Besides, Mr. Mellish was on the whole very useful, and he\r\ndid much towards keeping Aurora in apparently good spirits. Yet, on\r\nthe other hand, was it right to tamper with this great loving heart?\r\nWas it just to let the young man linger in the light of those black\r\neyes, and then send him away when the invalid was equal to the effort\r\nof giving him his _cong\xe9?_ Archibald Floyd did not know that John had\r\nbeen rejected by his daughter on a certain autumn morning at Brighton.\r\nSo he made up his mind to speak frankly, and sound the depths of his\r\nvisitor\'s feelings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Powell was making tea at a little table near one of the windows;\r\nAurora had fallen asleep with an open book in her hand; and the banker\r\nwalked with John Mellish up and down an espaliered alley in the golden\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\nArchibald freely communicated his perplexities to the Yorkshireman.\r\n"I need not tell you, my dear Mellish," he said, "how pleasant it is\r\nto me to have you here. I never had a son; but if it had pleased\r\nGod to give me one, I could have wished him to be just such a frank,\r\nnoble-hearted fellow as yourself. I\'m an old man, and have seen a great\r\ndeal of trouble--the sort of trouble which strikes deeper home to the\r\nheart than any sorrows that begin in Lombard Street or on \'Change; but\r\nI feel younger in your society, and I find myself clinging to you and\r\nleaning on you as a father might upon his son. You may believe, then,\r\nthat _I_ don\'t wish to get rid of you."\r\n\r\n"I do, Mr. Floyd; but do you think that any one else wishes to get rid\r\nof me? Do you think I\'m a nuisance to Miss Floyd?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mellish," answered the banker energetically. "I am sure that\r\nAurora takes pleasure in your society, and seems to treat you almost as\r\nif you were her brother; but--but I know your feelings, my dear boy,\r\nand what I fear is, that you may perhaps never inspire a warmer feeling\r\nin her heart."\r\n\r\n"Let me stay and take my chance, Mr. Floyd," cried John, throwing\r\nhis cigar across the espaliers, and coming to a dead stop upon the\r\ngravel-walk in the warmth of his enthusiasm. "Let me stay and take my\r\nchance. If there\'s any disappointment to be borne, I\'ll bear it like a\r\nman; I\'ll go back to the Park, and you shall never be bothered with me\r\nagain. Miss Floyd has rejected me once already; but perhaps I was in\r\ntoo great a hurry. I\'ve grown wiser since then, and I\'ve learnt to bide\r\nmy time. I\'ve one of the finest estates in Yorkshire; I\'m not worse\r\nlooking than the generality of fellows, or worse educated than the\r\ngenerality of fellows. I mayn\'t have straight hair, and a pale face,\r\nand look as if I\'d walked out of a three-volume novel, like Talbot\r\nBulstrode. I may be a stone or two over the correct weight for winning\r\na young lady\'s heart; but I\'m sound, wind and limb. I never told a lie,\r\nor committed a mean action; and I love your daughter with as true and\r\npure a love as ever man felt for woman. May I try my luck once more?"\r\n\r\n"You may, John."\r\n\r\n"And have I,--thank you, sir, for calling me John,--have I your good\r\nwishes for my success?"\r\n\r\nThe banker shook Mr. Mellish by the hand as he answered this question.\r\n\r\n"You have, my dear John, my best and heartiest wishes."\r\n\r\nSo there were three battles of the heart being fought in that\r\nspring-tide of fifty-eight. Aurora and Talbot, separated from each\r\nother by the length and breadth of half England, yet united by an\r\nimpalpable chain, were struggling day by day to break its links; while\r\npoor John Mellish quietly waited in the background, fighting the sturdy\r\nfight of the strong heart, which very rarely fails to win the prize it\r\nis set upon, however high or far away that prize may seem to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE CH\xc2TEAU D\'ARQUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Mellish made himself entirely at home in the little Leamington\r\ncircle after this interview with Mr. Floyd. No one could have been more\r\ntender in his manner, more respectful, untiring, and devoted, than was\r\nthis rough Yorkshireman to the broken old man. Archibald must have\r\nbeen less than human had he not in somewise returned this devotion,\r\nand it is therefore scarcely to be wondered that he became very warmly\r\nattached to his daughter\'s adorer. Had John Mellish been the most\r\ndesigning disciple of Machiavelli, instead of the most transparent and\r\ncandid of living creatures, I scarcely think he could have adopted\r\na truer means of making for himself a claim upon the gratitude of\r\nAurora Floyd than by the affection he evinced for her father. And this\r\naffection was as genuine as all else in that simple nature. How could\r\nhe do otherwise than love Aurora\'s father? He was her father. He had\r\na sublime claim upon the devotion of the man who loved her; who loved\r\nher as John loved,--unreservedly, undoubtingly, childishly; with such\r\nblind, unquestioning love as an infant feels for its mother. There may\r\nbe better women than that mother, perhaps; but who shall make the child\r\nbelieve so?\r\n\r\nJohn Mellish could not argue with himself upon his passion, as Talbot\r\nBulstrode had done. He could not separate himself from his love, and\r\nreason with the wild madness. How could he divide himself from that\r\nwhich was himself; more than himself; a diviner self? He asked no\r\nquestions about the past life of the woman he loved. He never sought\r\nto know the secret of Talbot\'s departure from Felden. He saw her,\r\nbeautiful, fascinating, perfect; and he accepted her as a great and\r\nwonderful fact, like the round midsummer moon shining down on the\r\nrustic flower-beds and espaliered garden-walks in the balmy June nights.\r\n\r\nSo the tranquil days glided slowly and monotonously past that quiet\r\ncircle. Aurora bore her silent burden; bore her trouble with a grand\r\ncourage, peculiar to such rich organizations as her own; and none\r\nknew whether the serpent had been rooted from her breast, or had made\r\nfor himself a permanent home in her heart. The banker\'s most watchful\r\ncare could not fathom the womanly mystery; but there were times when\r\nArchibald Floyd ventured to hope that his daughter was at peace, and\r\nTalbot Bulstrode well-nigh forgotten. In any case, it was wise to\r\nkeep her away from Felden Woods; so Mr. Floyd proposed a tour through\r\nNormandy to his daughter and Mrs. Powell. Aurora consented, with a\r\ntender smile and gentle pressure of her father\'s hand. She divined the\r\nold man\'s motive, and recognized the all-watchful love which sought\r\nto carry her from the scene of her trouble. John Mellish, who was\r\nnot invited to join the party, burst forth into such raptures at the\r\nproposal, that it would have required considerable hardness of heart\r\nto have refused his escort. He knew every inch of Normandy, he said,\r\nand promised to be of infinite use to Mr. Floyd and his daughter;\r\nwhich, seeing that his knowledge of Normandy had been acquired in his\r\nattendance at the Dieppe steeple-chases, and that his acquaintance\r\nwith the French language was very limited, seemed rather doubtful.\r\nBut for all this he contrived to keep his word. He went up to Town and\r\nhired an all-accomplished courier, who conducted the little party from\r\ntown to village, from church to ruin, and who could always find relays\r\nof Normandy horses for the banker\'s roomy travelling-carriage. The\r\nlittle party travelled from place to place until pale gleams of colour\r\nreturned in transient flushes to Aurora\'s cheeks. Grief is terribly\r\nselfish. I fear that Miss Floyd never took into consideration the havoc\r\nthat might be going on in the great honest heart of John Mellish. I\r\ndare say that if she had ever considered the matter, she would have\r\nthought that a broad-shouldered Yorkshireman of six feet two could\r\nnever suffer seriously from such a passion as love. She grew accustomed\r\nto his society; accustomed to have his strong arm handy for her to lean\r\nupon when she grew tired; accustomed to his carrying her sketch-book\r\nand shawls and camp-stools; accustomed to be waited upon by him all\r\nday, and served faithfully by him at every turn; taking his homage as a\r\nthing of course, but making him superlatively and dangerously happy by\r\nher tacit acceptance of it.\r\n\r\nSeptember was half gone when they bent their way homeward, lingering\r\nfor a few days at Dieppe, where the bathers were splashing about in\r\nsemi-theatrical costume, and the Etablissement des Bains was all aflame\r\nwith coloured lanterns, and noisy with nightly concerts.\r\n\r\nThe early autumnal days were glorious in their balmy beauty. The best\r\npart of a year had gone by since Talbot Bulstrode had bade Aurora that\r\nadieu which, in one sense at least, was to be eternal. They two, Aurora\r\nand Talbot, might meet again, it is true. They might meet, ay, and even\r\nbe cordial and friendly together, and do each other good service in\r\nsome dim time to come; but the two lovers who had parted in the little\r\nbay-windowed room at Felden Woods could _never_ meet again. Between\r\n_them_ there was death and the grave.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some such thoughts as these had their place in the breast of\r\nAurora Floyd as she sat, with John Mellish at her side, looking down\r\nupon the varied landscape from the height upon which the ruined walls\r\nof the Ch\xe2teau d\'Arques still rear the proud memorials of a day that is\r\ndead. I don\'t suppose that the banker\'s daughter troubled herself much\r\nabout Henry the Fourth, or any other dead-and-gone celebrity who may\r\nhave left the impress of his name upon that spot. She felt a tranquil\r\nsense of the exquisite purity and softness of the air, the deep blue\r\nof the cloudless sky, the spreading woods and grassy plains, the\r\norchards, where the trees were rosy with their plenteous burden, the\r\ntiny streamlets, the white villa-like cottages and straggling gardens,\r\noutspread in a fair panorama beneath her. Carried out of her sorrow\r\nby the sensuous rapture we derive from nature, and for the first time\r\ndiscovering in herself a vague sense of happiness, she began to wonder\r\nhow it was she had outlived her grief by so many months.\r\n\r\nShe had never during those weary months heard of Talbot Bulstrode.\r\nAny change might have come to him without her knowledge. He might\r\nhave married; might have chosen a prouder and worthier bride to share\r\nhis lofty name. She might meet him on her return to England with that\r\nhappier woman leaning upon his arm. Would some good-natured friend\r\ntell the bride how Talbot had loved and wooed the banker\'s daughter?\r\nAurora found herself pitying this happier woman, who would, after\r\nall, win but the second love of that proud heart; the pale reflection\r\nof a sun that has set; the feeble glow of expiring embers when the\r\ngreat blaze has died out. They had made her a couch with shawls and\r\ncarriage-rugs, outspread upon a rustic seat, for she was still far from\r\nstrong; and she lay in the bright September sunshine, looking down at\r\nthe fair landscape, and listening to the hum of beetles and the chirp\r\nof grasshoppers upon the smooth turf.\r\n\r\nHer father had walked to some distance with Mrs. Powell, who explored\r\nevery crevice and cranny of the ruins with the dutiful perseverance\r\npeculiar to commonplace people; but faithful John Mellish never stirred\r\nfrom Aurora\'s side. He was watching her musing face, trying to read its\r\nmeaning--trying to gather a gleam of hope from some chance expression\r\nflitting across it. Neither he nor she knew how long he had watched her\r\nthus, when, turning to speak to him about the landscape at her feet,\r\nshe found him on his knees imploring her to have pity upon him, and to\r\nlove him, or to let him love her; which was much the same.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t expect you to love _me_, Aurora," he said passionately; "how\r\nshould you? What is there in a big clumsy fellow like me to win your\r\nlove? I don\'t ask that. I only ask you to let me love you, to let me\r\nworship you, as the people we see kneeling in the churches here worship\r\ntheir saints. You won\'t drive me away from you, will you, Aurora,\r\nbecause I presume to forget what you said to me that cruel day at\r\nBrighton? You would never have suffered me to stay with you so long,\r\nand to be so happy, if you had meant to drive me away at the last! You\r\nnever could have been so cruel!"\r\n\r\nMiss Floyd looked at him with a sudden terror in her face. What was\r\nthis? What had she done? More wrong, more mischief? Was her life to be\r\none of perpetual wrong-doing? Was she to be for ever bringing sorrow\r\nupon good people? Was this John Mellish to be another sufferer by her\r\nfolly?\r\n\r\n"Oh, forgive me!" she cried, "forgive me! I never thought----"\r\n\r\n"You never thought that every day spent by your side must make the\r\nanguish of parting from you more cruelly bitter. O Aurora, women should\r\nthink of these things! Send me away from you, and what shall I be for\r\nthe rest of my life?--a broken man, fit for nothing better than the\r\nrace-course and the betting-rooms; a reckless man, ready to go to the\r\nbad by any road that can take me there; worthless alike to myself and\r\nto others. You must have seen such men, Aurora; men whose unblemished\r\nyouth promised an honourable manhood; but who break up all of a sudden,\r\nand go to ruin in a few years of mad dissipation. Nine times out of ten\r\na woman is the cause of that sudden change. I lay my life at your feet,\r\nAurora; I offer you more than my heart--I offer you my destiny. Do with\r\nit as you will."\r\n\r\nHe rose in his agitation, and walked a few paces away from her. The\r\ngrass-grown battlements sloped away from his feet; an outer and\r\ninner moat lay below him, at the bottom of a steep declivity. What a\r\nconvenient place for suicide, if Aurora should refuse to take pity upon\r\nhim! The reader must allow that he had availed himself of considerable\r\nartifice in addressing Miss Floyd. His appeal had taken the form of an\r\naccusation rather than a prayer, and he had duly impressed upon this\r\npoor girl the responsibility she would incur in refusing him. And\r\nthis, I take it, is a meanness of which men are often guilty in their\r\ndealings with the weaker sex.\r\n\r\nMiss Floyd looked up at her lover with a quiet, half-mournful smile.\r\n\r\n"Sit down there, Mr. Mellish," she said, pointing to a camp-stool at\r\nher side.\r\n\r\nJohn took the indicated seat, very much with the air of a prisoner in a\r\ncriminal dock about to answer for his life.\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell you a secret?" asked Aurora, looking compassionately at\r\nhis pale face.\r\n\r\n"A secret?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; the secret of my parting with Talbot Bulstrode. It was not I\r\nwho dismissed him from Felden; it was he who refused to fulfil his\r\nengagement with me."\r\n\r\nShe spoke slowly, in a low voice, as if it were painful to her to say\r\nthe words which told of so much humiliation.\r\n\r\n"He did!" cried John Mellish, rising, red and furious, from his seat,\r\neager to run to look for Talbot Bulstrode then and there, in order to\r\ninflict chastisement upon him.\r\n\r\n"He did, John Mellish, and he was justified in doing so," answered\r\nAurora, gravely. "You would have done the same."\r\n\r\n"O Aurora, Aurora!"\r\n\r\n"You would. You are as good a man as he, and why should your sense\r\nof honour be less strong than his? A barrier arose between Talbot\r\nBulstrode and me, and separated us for ever. That barrier was a secret."\r\n\r\nShe told him of the missing year in her young life; how Talbot had\r\ncalled upon her for an explanation, and how she had refused to give\r\nit. John listened to her with a thoughtful face, which broke out into\r\nsunshine as she turned to him and said--\r\n\r\n"How would you have acted in such a case, Mr. Mellish?"\r\n\r\n"How should I have acted, Aurora? I should have trusted you. But I can\r\ngive you a better answer to your question, Aurora. I can answer it by a\r\nrenewal of the prayer I made you five minutes ago. Be my wife."\r\n\r\n"In spite of this secret?"\r\n\r\n"In spite of a hundred secrets. I could not love you as I do, Aurora,\r\nif I did not believe you to be all that is best and purest in woman. I\r\ncannot believe this one moment, and doubt you the next. I give my life\r\nand honour into your hands. I would not confide them to the woman whom\r\nI could insult by a doubt."\r\n\r\nHis handsome Saxon face was radiant with love and trustfulness as he\r\nspoke. All his patient devotion, so long unheeded, or accepted as a\r\nthing of course, recurred to Aurora\'s mind. Did he not deserve some\r\nreward, some requital for all this? But there was one who was nearer\r\nand dearer to her, dearer than even Talbot Bulstrode had ever been; and\r\nthat one was the white-haired old man pottering about amongst the ruins\r\non the other side of the grassy platform.\r\n\r\n"Does my father know of this, Mr. Mellish?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"He does, Aurora. He has promised to accept me as his son; and Heaven\r\nknows I will try to deserve that name. Do not let me distress you,\r\ndearest. The murder is out now. You know that I still love you; still\r\nhope. Let time do the rest."\r\n\r\nShe held out both her hands to him with a tearful smile. He took those\r\nlittle hands in his own broad palms, and bending down kissed them\r\nreverently.\r\n\r\n"You are right," she said; "let time do the rest. You are worthy of the\r\nlove of a better woman than me, John Mellish; but, with the help of\r\nHeaven, I will never give you cause to regret having trusted me."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEEVE HARGRAVES, THE "SOFTY."\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in October Aurora Floyd returned to Felden Woods, once more\r\n"engaged." The county families opened their eyes when the report\r\nreached them that the banker\'s daughter was going to be married, not\r\nto Talbot Bulstrode, but to Mr. John Mellish, of Mellish Park, near\r\nDoncaster. The unmarried ladies--rather hanging on hand about Beckenham\r\nand West Wickham--did not approve of all this chopping and changing.\r\nThey recognized the taint of the Prodder blood in this fickleness. The\r\nspangles and the sawdust were breaking out, and Aurora was, as they\r\nhad always said, her mother\'s own daughter. She was a very lucky young\r\nwoman, they remarked, in being able, after jilting one rich man, to\r\npick up another; but of course a young person whose father could give\r\nher fifty thousand pounds on her wedding-day might be permitted to\r\nplay fast and loose with the male sex, while worthier Marianas moped in\r\ntheir moated granges till gray hairs showed themselves in glistening\r\n_bandeaux_, and cruel crow\'s feet gathered about the corners of bright\r\neyes. It is well to be merry and wise, and honest and true, and to be\r\noff with the old love, &c.; but it is better to be Miss Floyd, of the\r\nsenior branch of Floyd, Floyd, and Floyd, for then you need be none\r\nof these things. At least to such effect was the talk about Beckenham\r\nwhen Archibald brought his daughter back to Felden Woods; and a crowd\r\nof dressmakers and milliners set to work at the marriage garments as\r\nbusily as if Miss Floyd had never had any clothes in her life before.\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander and Lucy came back to Felden to assist in the\r\npreparations for the wedding. Lucy had improved very much in appearance\r\nsince the preceding winter; there was a happier light in her soft blue\r\neyes, and a healthier hue in her cheeks; but she blushed crimson when\r\nshe first met Aurora, and hung back a little from Miss Floyd\'s caresses.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was to take place at the end of November. The bride and\r\nbridegroom were to spend the winter in Paris, where Archibald Floyd was\r\nto join them, and return to England, "in time for the Craven Meeting,"\r\nas John Mellish said,--for I am sorry to say that, having been so\r\nhappily successful in his love-affair, this young man\'s thoughts\r\nreturned into their accustomed channels; and the creature he held\r\ndearest on earth next to Miss Floyd and those belonging to her, was a\r\nbay filly called Aurora, and entered for the Oaks and Leger of a future\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nOught I to apologize for my heroine, because she has forgotten Talbot\r\nBulstrode, and that she entertains a grateful affection for this\r\nadoring John Mellish? She ought, no doubt, to have died of shame and\r\nsorrow after Talbot\'s cruel desertion; and Heaven knows that only her\r\nyouth and vitality carried her through a very severe battle with the\r\ngrim rider of the pale horse; but having once passed through that dread\r\nencounter, she was, however feeble, in a fair way to recover. These\r\npassionate griefs, to kill at all, must kill suddenly. The lovers who\r\ndie for love in our tragedies die in such a vast hurry, that there is\r\ngenerally some mistake or misapprehension about the business, and\r\nthe tragedy might have been a comedy if the hero or heroine had only\r\nwaited for a quarter of an hour. If Othello had but lingered a little\r\nbefore smothering his wife, Mistress Emilia might have come in and\r\nsworn and protested; and Cassio, with the handkerchief about his leg,\r\nmight have been in time to set the mind of the valiant Moor at rest,\r\nand put the Venetian dog to confusion. How happily Mr. and Mrs. Romeo\r\nMontague might have lived and died, thanks to the dear good friar, if\r\nthe foolish bridegroom had not been in such a hurry to swallow the vile\r\nstuff from the apothecary\'s! and as people are, I hope and believe, a\r\nlittle wiser in real life than they appear to be upon the stage, the\r\nworms very rarely get an honest meal off men and women who have died\r\nfor love. So Aurora walked through the rooms at Felden in which Talbot\r\nBulstrode had so often walked by her side; and if there was any regret\r\nat her heart, it was a quiet sorrow, such as we feel for the dead,--a\r\nsorrow not unmingled with pity, for she thought that the proud son of\r\nSir John Raleigh Bulstrode might have been a happier man if he had been\r\nas generous and trusting as John Mellish. Perhaps the healthiest sign\r\nof the state of her heart was, that she could speak of Talbot freely,\r\ncheerfully, and without a blush. She asked Lucy if she had met Captain\r\nBulstrode that year; and the little hypocrite told her cousin, Yes;\r\nthat he had spoken to them one day in the Park, and that she believed\r\nhe had gone into Parliament. She _believed!_ Why, she knew his maiden\r\nspeech by heart, though it was on some hopelessly uninteresting bill\r\nin which the Cornish mines were in some vague manner involved with the\r\nnational survey; and she could have repeated it as correctly as her\r\nyoungest brother could declaim to his "Romans, countrymen and lovers."\r\nAurora might forget him, and basely marry a fair-haired Yorkshireman;\r\nbut for Lucy Floyd earth only held this dark knight, with the severe\r\ngray eyes and the stiff leg. Poor Lucy, therefore, loved and was\r\ngrateful to her brilliant cousin for that fickleness which had brought\r\nabout such a change in the programme of the gay wedding at Felden\r\nWoods. The fair young confidante and bridesmaid could assist in the\r\nceremonial now with a good grace. She no longer walked about like a\r\n"corpse alive;" but took a hearty womanly interest in the whole affair,\r\nand was very much concerned in a discussion as to the merits of pink\r\n_versus_ blue for the bonnets of the bridesmaids.\r\n\r\nThe boisterous happiness of John Mellish seemed contagious, and made a\r\ngenial atmosphere about the great mansion at Felden. Stalwart Andrew\r\nFloyd was delighted with his young cousin\'s choice. No more refusals\r\nto join him in the hunting-field; but half the county breakfasting at\r\nFelden, and the long terrace and garden luminous with "pink."\r\n\r\nNot a ripple disturbed the smooth current of that brief courtship.\r\nThe Yorkshireman contrived to make himself agreeable to everybody\r\nbelonging to his dark-eyed divinity. He flattered their weaknesses, he\r\ngratified their caprices, he studied their wishes, and paid them all\r\nsuch insidious court, that I\'m afraid invidious comparisons were drawn\r\nbetween John and Talbot, to the disadvantage of the proud young officer.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for any quarrel to arise between the lovers, for John\r\nfollowed his mistress about like some big slave, who only lived to\r\ndo her bidding; and Aurora accepted his devotion with a Sultana-like\r\ngrace, which became her amazingly. Once more she visited the stables\r\nand inspected her father\'s stud, for the first time since she had left\r\nFelden for the Parisian finishing school. Once more she rode across\r\ncountry, wearing a hat which provoked considerable criticism,--a hat\r\nwhich was no other than the now universal turban, or pork-pie, but\r\nwhich was new to the world in the autumn of fifty-eight. Her earlier\r\ngirlhood appeared to return to her once more. It seemed almost as if\r\nthe two years and a half in which she had left and returned to her\r\nhome, and had met and parted with Talbot Bulstrode, had been blotted\r\nfrom her life, leaving her spirits fresh and bright as they were before\r\nthat stormy interview in her father\'s study in the June of fifty-six.\r\n\r\nThe county families came to the wedding at Beckenham church, and were\r\nfain to confess that Miss Floyd looked wondrously handsome in her\r\nvirginal crown of orange buds and flowers, and her voluminous Mechlin\r\nveil; she had pleaded hard to be married in a bonnet, but had been\r\noverruled by a posse of female cousins. Mr. Richard Gunter provided\r\nthe marriage feast, and sent a man down to Felden to superintend the\r\narrangements, who was more dashing and splendid to look upon than\r\nany of the Kentish guests. John Mellish alternately laughed and cried\r\nthroughout that eventful morning. Heaven knows how many times he shook\r\nhands with Archibald Floyd, carrying the banker off into solitary\r\ncorners, and swearing, with the tears running down his broad cheeks,\r\nto be a good husband to the old man\'s daughter; so that it must have\r\nbeen a relief to the white-haired old Scotchman when Aurora descended\r\nthe staircase, rustling in violet moir\xe9 antique, and surrounded by her\r\nbridesmaids, to take leave of this dear father before the prancing\r\nsteeds carried Mr. and Mrs. Mellish to that most prosaic of hymeneal\r\nstages, the London Bridge Station.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mellish! Yes, she was Mrs. Mellish now. Talbot Bulstrode read\r\nof her marriage in that very column of the newspaper in which he had\r\nthought perhaps to see her death. How flatly the romance ended! With\r\nwhat a dull cadence the storm died out, and what a commonplace gray,\r\nevery-day sky succeeded the terrors of the lightning! Less than a year\r\nsince, the globe had seemed to him to collapse, and creation to come\r\nto a standstill because of his trouble; and he was now in Parliament,\r\nlegislating for the Cornish miners, and getting stout, his ill-natured\r\nfriends said; and she--she who ought, in accordance with all dramatic\r\npropriety, to have died out of hand long before this, she had married\r\na Yorkshire landowner, and would no doubt take her place in the county\r\nand play My Lady Bountiful in the village, and be chief patroness at\r\nthe race-balls, and live happily ever afterwards. He crumpled the\r\n\'Times\' newspaper, and flung it from him in his rage and mortification.\r\n"And I once thought that she loved me!" he cried.\r\n\r\nAnd she did love you, Talbot Bulstrode; loved you as she can never love\r\nthis honest, generous, devoted John Mellish, though she may by-and-by\r\nbestow upon him an affection which is a great deal better worth having.\r\nShe loved you with the girl\'s romantic fancy and reverent admiration;\r\nand tried humbly to fashion her very nature anew, that she might be\r\nworthy of your sublime excellence. She loved you as women only love\r\nin their first youth, and as they rarely love the men they ultimately\r\nmarry. The tree is perhaps all the stronger when these first frail\r\nbranches are lopped away to give place to strong and spreading arms,\r\nbeneath which a husband and children may shelter.\r\n\r\nBut Talbot could not see all this. He saw nothing but that brief\r\nannouncement in the \'Times:\' "John Mellish, Esq., of Mellish Park,\r\nnear Doncaster, to Aurora, only daughter of Archibald Floyd, Banker,\r\nof Felden Woods, Kent." He was angry with his sometime love, and more\r\nangry with himself for feeling that anger; and he plunged furiously\r\ninto blue-books, to prepare himself for the coming session; and again\r\nhe took his gun and went out upon the "barren, barren moorland," as he\r\nhad done in the first violence of his grief, and wandered down to the\r\ndreary sea-shore, where he raved about his "Amy, shallow-hearted," and\r\ntried the pitch of his voice against the ides of February should come\r\nround, and the bill for the Cornish miners be laid before the Speaker.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of January, the servants at Mellish Park prepared for\r\nthe advent of Master John and his bride. It was a work of love in that\r\ndisorderly household, for it pleased them that master would have some\r\none to keep him at home, and that the county would be entertained, and\r\nfestivals held in the roomy rambling mansion. Architects, upholsterers,\r\nand decorators had been busy through the short winter days preparing a\r\nsuite of apartments for Mrs. Mellish; and the western, or as it was\r\ncalled the Gothic, wing of the house had been restored and remodelled\r\nfor Aurora, until the oak-roofed chambers blazed with rose-colour and\r\ngold, like a medi\xe6val chapel. If John could have expended half his\r\nfortune in the purchase of a roc\'s egg to hang in these apartments, he\r\nwould have gladly done so. He was so proud of his Cleopatra-like bride,\r\nhis jewel beyond all parallel amid all gems, that he fancied he could\r\nnot build a shrine rich enough for his treasure. So the house in which\r\nhonest country squires and their sensible motherly wives had lived\r\ncontentedly for nearly three centuries was almost pulled to pieces,\r\nbefore John thought it worthy of the banker\'s daughter. The trainers\r\nand grooms and stable-boys shrugged their shoulders superciliously,\r\nand spat fragments of straw disdainfully upon the paved stable-yard,\r\nas they heard the clatter of the tools of stonemasons and glaziers\r\nbusy about the fa\xe7ade of the restored apartments. The stable would\r\nbe _naught_ now, they supposed, and Muster Mellish would be always\r\ntied to his wife\'s apron-string. It was a relief to them to hear that\r\nMrs. Mellish was fond of riding and hunting, and would no doubt take\r\nto horse-racing in due time, as the legitimate taste of a lady of\r\nposition and fortune.\r\n\r\nThe bells of the village church rang loudly and joyously in the clear\r\nwinter air as the carriage-and-four which had met John and his bride\r\nat Doncaster, dashed into the gates of Mellish Park and up the long\r\navenue to the semi-Gothic, semi-barbaric portico of the great door.\r\nHearty Yorkshire voices rang out in loud cheers of welcome as Aurora\r\nstepped from the carriage, and passed under the shadow of the porch\r\nand into the old oak hall, which had been hung with evergreens and\r\nadorned with floral devices; amongst which figured the legend, "Welcom\r\nto Melish!" and other such friendly inscriptions, more conspicuous for\r\ntheir kindly meaning than their strict orthography. The servants were\r\nenraptured with their master\'s choice. She was so brightly handsome,\r\nthat the simple-hearted creatures accepted her beauty as we accept\r\nthe sunlight, and felt a genial warmth in that radiant loveliness,\r\nwhich the most classical perfection could never have inspired. Indeed,\r\na Grecian outline might have been thrown away upon the Yorkshire\r\nservants, whose uncultivated tastes were a great deal more disposed\r\nto recognize splendour of colour than purity of form. They could not\r\nchoose but admire Aurora\'s eyes, which they unanimously declared to be\r\n"regular shiners;" and the flash of her white teeth, glancing between\r\nthe full crimson lips; and the bright flush which lighted up her pale\r\nolive skin; and the purple lustre of her massive coronal of plaited\r\nhair. Her beauty was of that luxuriant and splendid order which has\r\nalways most effect upon the masses, and the fascination of her manner\r\nwas almost akin to sorcery in its power over simple people. I lose\r\nmyself when I try to describe the feminine intoxications, the wonderful\r\nfascination exercised by this dark-eyed siren. Surely the secret of her\r\npower to charm must have been the wonderful vitality of her nature, by\r\nvirtue of which she carried life and animal spirits about with her as\r\nan atmosphere, till dull people grew merry by reason of her contagious\r\npresence; or perhaps the true charm of her manner was that childlike\r\nand exquisite unconsciousness of self which made her for ever a new\r\ncreature; for ever impulsive and sympathetic, acutely sensible of all\r\nsorrow in others, though of a nature originally joyous in the extreme.\r\n\r\nMrs. Walter Powell had been transferred from Felden Woods to Mellish\r\nPark, and was comfortably installed in her prim apartments when the\r\nbride and bridegroom arrived. The Yorkshire housekeeper was to abandon\r\nthe executive power to the ensign\'s widow, who was to take all trouble\r\nof administration off Aurora\'s hands.\r\n\r\n"Heaven help your friends if they ever had to eat a dinner of my\r\nordering, John," Mrs. Mellish said, making free confession of her\r\nignorance; "I am glad, too, that we have no occasion to turn the poor\r\nsoul out upon the world once more. Those long columns of advertisements\r\nin the \'Times\' give me a sick pain at my heart when I think of what a\r\ngoverness must have to encounter. I cannot loll back in my carriage\r\nand be \'grateful for my advantages,\' as Mrs. Alexander says, when\r\nI remember the sufferings of others. I am rather inclined to be\r\ndiscontented with my lot, and to think it a poor thing, after all, to\r\nbe rich and happy in a world where so many must suffer; so I am glad we\r\ncan give Mrs. Powell something to do at Mellish Park."\r\n\r\nThe ensign\'s widow rejoiced very much in that she was to be retained\r\nin such comfortable quarters; but she did not thank Aurora for the\r\nbenefits received from the open hands of the banker\'s daughter. She\r\ndid not thank her, because--she hated her. Why did she hate her? She\r\nhated her for the very benefits she received, or rather because she,\r\nAurora, had power to bestow such benefits. She hated her as such slow,\r\nsluggish, narrow-minded creatures always hate the frank and generous;\r\nhated her as envy will for ever hate prosperity; as Haman hated\r\nMordecai from the height of his throne; and as the man of Haman nature\r\nwould hate, were he supreme in the universe. If Mrs. Walter Powell had\r\nbeen a duchess, and Aurora a crossing-sweeper, she would still have\r\nenvied her; she would have envied her glorious eyes and flashing teeth,\r\nher imperial carriage and generous soul. This pale, whity-brown-haired\r\nwoman felt herself contemptible in the presence of Aurora, and she\r\nresented the bounteous vitality of this nature which made her conscious\r\nof the sluggishness of her own. She detested Mrs. Mellish for the\r\npossession of attributes which she felt were richer gifts than all the\r\nwealth of the house of Floyd, Floyd, and Floyd melted into one mountain\r\nof ore. But it is not for a dependent to hate, except in a decorous and\r\ngentlewomanly manner--secretly, in the dim recesses of her soul; while\r\nshe dresses her face with an unvarying smile--a smile which she puts on\r\nevery morning with her clean collar, and takes off at night when she\r\ngoes to bed.\r\n\r\nNow as, by an all-wise dispensation of Providence, it is not possible\r\nfor one person so to hate another without that other having a vague\r\nconsciousness of the deadly sentiment, Aurora felt that Mrs. Powell\'s\r\nattachment to her was of no very profound nature. But the reckless girl\r\ndid not seek to fathom the depth of any inimical feeling which might\r\nlurk in her dependent\'s breast.\r\n\r\n"She is not very fond of me, poor soul!" she said; "and I dare say I\r\ntorment and annoy her with my careless follies. If I were like that\r\ndear considerate little Lucy, now--" And with a shrug of her shoulders,\r\nand an unfinished sentence such as this, Mrs. Mellish dismissed the\r\ninsignificant subject from her mind.\r\n\r\nYou cannot expect these grand, courageous creatures to be frightened\r\nof quiet people. And yet, in the great dramas of life, it is the quiet\r\npeople who do the mischief. Iago was not a noisy person; though, thank\r\nHeaven! it is no longer the fashion to represent him as an oily sneak,\r\nwhom even the most foolish of Moors _could not_ have trusted.\r\n\r\nAurora was at peace. The storms that had so nearly shipwrecked her\r\nyoung life had passed away, leaving her upon a fair and fertile shore.\r\nWhatever griefs she had inflicted upon her father\'s devoted heart had\r\nnot been mortal; and the old banker seemed a very happy man when he\r\ncame, in the bright April weather, to see the young couple at Mellish\r\nPark. Amongst all the hangers-on of that large establishment there\r\nwas only one person who did not join in the general voice when Mrs.\r\nMellish was spoken of, and that one person was so very insignificant\r\nthat his fellow-servants scarcely cared to ascertain his opinion.\r\nHe was a man of about forty, who had been born at Mellish Park, and\r\nhad pottered about the stables from his babyhood, doing odd jobs\r\nfor the grooms, and being reckoned, although a little "fond" upon\r\ncommon matters, a very acute judge of horse-flesh. This man was\r\ncalled Stephen, or, more commonly, Steeve Hargraves. He was a squat,\r\nbroad-shouldered fellow, with a big head, a pale haggard face,--a face\r\nwhose ghastly pallor seemed almost unnatural,--reddish-brown eyes, and\r\nbushy, sandy eyebrows, which formed a species of penthouse over those\r\nsinister-looking eyes. He was the sort of man who is generally called\r\n_repulsive_,--a man from whom you recoil with a feeling of instinctive\r\ndislike, which is, no doubt, both wicked and unjust; for we have no\r\nright to take objection to a man because he has an ugly glitter in his\r\neyes, and shaggy tufts of red hair meeting on the bridge of his nose,\r\nand big splay feet, which seem made to crush and destroy whatever comes\r\nin their way. This was what Aurora Mellish thought when, a few days\r\nafter her arrival at the Park, she saw Steeve Hargraves for the first\r\ntime, coming out of the harness-room with a bridle across his arm. She\r\nwas angry with herself for the involuntary shudder with which she drew\r\nback at the sight of this man, who stood at a little distance polishing\r\nthe brass ornaments upon a set of harness, and furtively regarding Mrs.\r\nMellish as she leaned on her husband\'s arm, talking to the trainer\r\nabout the foals at grass in the meadows outside the Park.\r\n\r\nAurora asked who the man was.\r\n\r\n"Why, his name is Hargraves, ma\'am," answered the trainer; "but we call\r\nhim Steeve. He\'s a little bit touched in the upper story,--a little\r\nbit \'fond,\' as we call it here; but he\'s useful about the stables when\r\nhe pleases; that arnt always though, for he\'s rather a queer temper,\r\nand there\'s none of us has ever been able to get the upper hand of him,\r\nas master knows."\r\n\r\nJohn Mellish laughed.\r\n\r\n"No," he said; "Steeve has pretty much his own way in the stables, I\r\nfancy. He was a favourite groom of my father\'s twenty years ago; but he\r\ngot a fall in the hunting-field, which did him some injury about the\r\nhead, and he\'s never been quite right since. Of course this, with my\r\npoor father\'s regard for him, gives him a claim upon us, and we put up\r\nwith his queer ways, don\'t we, Langley?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we do, sir," said the trainer; "though, upon my honour, I\'m\r\nsometimes half afraid of him, and begin to think he\'ll get up in the\r\nmiddle of the night and murder some of us."\r\n\r\n"Not till some of you have won a hatful of money, Langley. Steeve\'s\r\na little too fond of the brass to murder any of you for nothing. You\r\nshall see his face light up presently, Aurora," said John, beckoning to\r\nthe stable-man. "Come here, Steeve. Mrs. Mellish wishes you to drink\r\nher health."\r\n\r\nHe dropped a sovereign into the man\'s broad muscular palm,--the hand\r\nof a gladiator, with horny flesh and sinews of iron. Steeve\'s red eyes\r\nglistened as his fingers closed upon the money.\r\n\r\n"Thank you kindly, my lady," he said, touching his cap.\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a low subdued voice, which contrasted so strangely with the\r\nphysical power manifest in his appearance that Aurora drew back with a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nUnhappily for this poor "fond" creature, whose person was in itself\r\nrepulsive, there was something in this inward, semi-whispering voice\r\nwhich gave rise to an instinctive dislike in those who heard him speak\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\nHe touched his greasy woollen cap once more, and went slowly back to\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\n"How white his face is!" said Aurora. "Has he been ill?"\r\n\r\n"No. He has had that pale face ever since his fall. I was too young\r\nwhen it happened, to remember much about it; but I have heard my father\r\nsay, that when they brought the poor creature home, his face, which\r\nhad been florid before, was as white as a sheet of writing-paper, and\r\nhis voice, until that period strong and gruff, was reduced to the\r\nhalf-whisper in which he now speaks. The doctors did all they could for\r\nhim, and carried him through an awful attack of brain-fever; but they\r\ncould never bring back his voice, nor the colour to his cheeks."\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow!" said Mrs. Mellish gently; "he is very much to be pitied."\r\n\r\nShe was reproaching herself, as she said this, for that feeling of\r\nrepugnance which she could not overcome. It was a repugnance closely\r\nallied to terror; she felt as if she could scarcely be happy at Mellish\r\nPark while that man was on the premises. She was half inclined to beg\r\nher indulgent husband to pension him off, and send him to the other\r\nend of the county; but the next moment she was ashamed of her childish\r\nfolly, and a few hours afterwards had forgotten Steeve Hargraves, the\r\n"Softy," as he was politely called in the stables.\r\n\r\nReader, when any creature inspires you with this instinctive\r\nunreasoning abhorrence, avoid that creature. He is dangerous. Take\r\nwarning, as you take warning by the clouds in the sky, and the ominous\r\nstillness of the atmosphere when there is a storm coming. Nature\r\ncannot lie; and it is nature which has planted that shuddering terror\r\nin your breast; an instinct of self-preservation rather than of\r\ncowardly fear, which at the first sight of some fellow-creature tells\r\nyou more plainly than words can speak, "That man is my enemy!"\r\n\r\nHad Aurora suffered herself to be guided by this instinct,--had she\r\ngiven way to the impulse which she despised as childish, and caused\r\nStephen Hargraves to be dismissed from Mellish Park, what bitter\r\nmisery, what cruel anguish, might have been spared to herself and\r\nothers!\r\n\r\nThe mastiff Bow-wow had accompanied his mistress to her new home; but\r\nBow-wow\'s best days were done. A month before Aurora\'s marriage he had\r\nbeen run over by a pony-carriage in one of the roads about Felden, and\r\nhad been conveyed, bleeding and disabled, to the veterinary surgeon\'s,\r\nto have one of his hind-legs put into splints, and to be carried\r\nthrough his sufferings by the highest available skill in the science\r\nof dog-doctoring. Aurora drove every day to Croydon to see her sick\r\nfavourite; and at the worst Bow-wow was always well enough to recognize\r\nhis beloved mistress, and roll his listless, feverish tongue over\r\nher white hands, in token of that unchanging brute affection which\r\ncan only perish with life. So the mastiff was quite lame as well as\r\nhalf blind when he arrived at Mellish Park, with the rest of Aurora\'s\r\ngoods and chattels. He was a privileged creature in the roomy mansion;\r\na tiger-skin was spread for him upon the hearth in the drawing-room,\r\nand he spent his declining days in luxurious repose, basking in the\r\nfire-light or sunning himself in the windows, as it pleased his royal\r\nfancy; but, feeble as he was, always able to limp after Mrs. Mellish\r\nwhen she walked on the lawn or in the woody shrubberies which skirted\r\nthe gardens.\r\n\r\nOne day, when she had returned from her morning\'s ride with John and\r\nher father, who accompanied them sometimes upon a quiet gray cob, and\r\nseemed a younger man for the exercise, she lingered on the lawn in her\r\nriding-habit after the horses had been taken back to the stables, and\r\nMr. Mellish and his father-in-law had re-entered the house. The mastiff\r\nsaw her from the drawing-room window, and crawled out to welcome her.\r\nTempted by the exquisite softness of the atmosphere, she strolled, with\r\nher riding-habit gathered under her arm and her whip in her hand,\r\nlooking for primroses under the clumps of trees upon the lawn. She\r\ngathered a cluster of wild-flowers, and was returning to the house,\r\nwhen she remembered some directions respecting a favourite pony that\r\nwas ill, which she had omitted to give to her groom.\r\n\r\nShe crossed the stable-yard, followed by Bow-wow, found the groom, gave\r\nhim her orders, and went back to the gardens. While talking to the\r\nman, she had recognized the white face of Steeve Hargraves at one of\r\nthe windows of the harness-room. He came out while she was giving her\r\ndirections, and carried a set of harness across to a coach-house on the\r\nopposite side of the quadrangle. Aurora was on the threshold of the\r\ngates opening from the stables into the gardens, when she was arrested\r\nby a howl of pain from the mastiff Bow-wow. Rapid as lightning in every\r\nmovement, she turned round in time to see the cause of this cry. Steeve\r\nHargraves had sent the animal reeling away from him with a kick from\r\nhis iron-bound clog. Cruelty to animals was one of the failings of\r\nthe "Softy." He was not cruel to the Mellish horses, for he had sense\r\nenough to know that his daily bread depended upon his attention to\r\nthem; but Heaven help any outsider that came in his way! Aurora sprang\r\nupon him like a beautiful tigress, and catching the collar of his\r\nfustian jacket in her slight hands, rooted him to the spot upon which\r\nhe stood. The grasp of those slender hands, convulsed by passion, was\r\nnot to be easily shaken off; and Steeve Hargraves, taken completely off\r\nhis guard, stared aghast at his assailant. Taller than the stable-man\r\nby a foot and a half, she towered above him, her cheeks white with\r\nrage, her eyes flashing fury, her hat fallen off, and her black hair\r\ntumbling about her shoulders, sublime in her passion.\r\n\r\nThe man crouched beneath the grasp of the imperious creature.\r\n\r\n"Let me go!" he gasped, in his inward whisper, which had a hissing\r\nsound in his agitation; "let me go, or you\'ll be sorry; let me go!"\r\n\r\n"How dared you!" cried Aurora,--"how dared you hurt him? My poor dog!\r\nMy poor lame, feeble dog! How dared you to do it? You cowardly dastard!\r\nyou----"\r\n\r\nShe disengaged her right hand from his collar and rained a shower of\r\nblows upon his clumsy shoulders with her slender whip; a mere toy,\r\nwith emeralds set in its golden head, but stinging like a rod of\r\nflexible steel in that little hand.\r\n\r\n"How dared you!" she repeated again and again, her cheeks changing\r\nfrom white to scarlet in the effort to hold the man with one hand. Her\r\ntangled hair had fallen to her waist by this time, and the whip was\r\nbroken in half a dozen places.\r\n\r\nJohn Mellish, entering the stable-yard by chance at this very moment,\r\nturned white with horror at beholding the beautiful fury.\r\n\r\n"Aurora! Aurora!" he cried, snatching the man\'s collar from her grasp,\r\nand hurling him half a dozen paces off. "Aurora, what is it?"\r\n\r\nShe told him in broken gasps the cause of her indignation. He took the\r\nsplintered whip from her hand, picked up her hat, which she had trodden\r\nupon in her rage, and led her across the yard towards the back entrance\r\nto the house. It was such bitter shame to him to think that this\r\npeerless, this adored creature should do anything to bring disgrace, or\r\neven ridicule, upon herself. He would have stripped off his coat and\r\nfought with half a dozen coal-heavers, and thought nothing of it; but\r\nthat she----\r\n\r\n"Go in, go in, my darling girl," he said, with sorrowful tenderness;\r\n"the servants are peeping and prying about, I dare say. You should not\r\nhave done this; you should have told me."\r\n\r\n"I should have told you!" she cried impatiently. "How could I stop to\r\ntell you when I saw him strike my dog, my poor lame dog?"\r\n\r\n"Go in, darling, go in! There, there, calm yourself, and go in."\r\n\r\nHe spoke as if he had been trying to soothe an agitated child, for he\r\nsaw by the convulsive heaving of her breast that the violent emotion\r\nwould terminate in hysteria, as all womanly fury must, sooner or later.\r\nHe half led, half carried her up a back staircase to her own room, and\r\nleft her lying on a sofa in her riding-habit. He thrust the broken whip\r\ninto his pocket, and then, setting his strong white teeth and clenching\r\nhis fist, went to look for Stephen Hargraves. As he crossed the hall\r\nin his way out, he selected a stout leather-thonged hunting-whip from\r\na stand of formidable implements. Steeve, the "Softy," was sitting on\r\na horse-block when John re-entered the stable-yard. He was rubbing\r\nhis shoulders with a very doleful face, while a couple of grinning\r\nstable-boys, who had perhaps witnessed his chastisement, watched him\r\nfrom a respectful distance. They had no inclination to go too near him\r\njust then, for the "Softy" had a playful habit of brandishing a big\r\nclasp-knife when he felt himself aggrieved; and the bravest lad in\r\nthe stables had no wish to die from a stab in the abdomen, with the\r\npleasant conviction that his murderer\'s heaviest punishment might be a\r\nfortnight\'s imprisonment, or an easy fine.\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Hargraves," said John Mellish, lifting the "Softy" off the\r\nhorse-block and planting him at a convenient distance for giving\r\nfull play to the hunting-whip, "it wasn\'t Mrs. Mellish\'s business to\r\nhorsewhip you, but it was her duty to let me do it for her; so take\r\nthat, you coward."\r\n\r\nThe leathern thong whistled in the air, and curled about Steeve\'s\r\nshoulders; but John felt there was something despicable in the unequal\r\ncontest. He threw the whip away, and still holding him by the collar,\r\nconducted the "Softy" to the gates of the stable-yard.\r\n\r\n"You see that avenue," he said, pointing down a fair glade that\r\nstretched before them; "it leads pretty straight out of the Park, and I\r\nstrongly recommend you, Mr. Stephen Hargraves, to get to the end of it\r\nas fast as ever you can, and never to show your ugly white face upon an\r\ninch of ground belonging to me again. D\'ye hear?"\r\n\r\n"E-es, sir."\r\n\r\n"Stay! I suppose there\'s wages or something due to you." He took\r\na handful of money from his waistcoat-pocket and threw it on the\r\nground, sovereigns and half-crowns rolling hither and thither on the\r\ngravel-path; then turning on his heel, he left the "Softy" to pick\r\nup the scattered treasure. Steeve Hargraves dropped on his knees,\r\nand groped about till he had found the last coin; then, as he slowly\r\ncounted the money from one hand into the other, his white face relapsed\r\ninto a grin: John Mellish had given him gold and silver amounting to\r\nupwards of two years of his ordinary wages.\r\n\r\nHe walked a few paces down the avenue, and then looking back shook his\r\nfist at the house he was leaving behind him.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a fine-spirited madam, Mrs. John Mellish, sure enough," he\r\nmuttered; "but never you give me a chance of doing you any mischief, or\r\nby the Lord, _fond_ as I am, I\'ll do it! They think the \'Softy\'s\' up\r\nto naught, perhaps. Wait a bit."\r\n\r\nHe took his money from his pocket again, and counted it once more, as\r\nhe walked slowly towards the gates of the Park.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that Aurora had two enemies, one without\r\nand one within her pleasant home: one for ever brooding discontent\r\nand hatred within the holy circle of the domestic hearth; the other\r\nplotting ruin and vengeance without the walls of the citadel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPRING MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early spring brought Lucy Floyd on a visit to her cousin, a\r\nwondering witness of the happiness that reigned at Mellish Park.\r\n\r\nPoor Lucy had expected to find Aurora held as something better than the\r\ndogs, and a little higher than the horses, in that Yorkshire household;\r\nand was considerably surprised to find her dark-eyed cousin a despotic\r\nand capricious sovereign, reigning with undisputed sway over every\r\ncreature, biped or quadruped, upon the estate. She was surprised to see\r\nthe bright glow in her cheeks, the merry sparkle in her eyes; surprised\r\nto hear the light tread of her footstep, the gushing music of her\r\nlaugh; surprised, in fact, to discover that, instead of weeping over\r\nthe dry bones of her dead love for Talbot Bulstrode, Aurora had learned\r\nto love her husband.\r\n\r\nHave I any need to be ashamed of my heroine in that she had forgotten\r\nher straight-nosed, gray-eyed Cornish lover, who had set his pride and\r\nhis pedigree between himself and his affection, and had loved her at\r\nbest with a reservation, although Heaven only knows how dearly he had\r\nloved her? Have I any cause to blush for this poor, impetuous girl, if,\r\nturning in the sickness of her sorrowful heart with a sense of relief\r\nand gratitude to the honest shelter of John\'s love, she had quickly\r\nlearnt to feel for him an affection which repaid him a thousandfold for\r\nhis long-suffering devotion? Surely it would have been impossible for\r\nany true-hearted woman to withhold some such repayment for such a love\r\nas that which, in every word, and look, and thought, and deed, John\r\nMellish bestowed upon his wife. How could she be for ever his creditor\r\nfor such a boundless debt? Are hearts like his common amongst our clay?\r\nIs it a small thing to be beloved with this loyal and pure affection?\r\nIs it laid so often at the feet of any mortal woman that she should\r\nspurn and trample upon the holy offering?\r\n\r\nHe had loved; and more, he had trusted her. He had trusted her, when\r\nthe man who passionately loved her had left her in an agony of doubt\r\nand despair. The cause of this lay in the difference between the two\r\nmen. John Mellish had as high and stern a sense of honour as Talbot\r\nBulstrode; but while the proud Cornishman\'s strength of brain lay\r\nin the reflective faculties, the Yorkshireman\'s acute intellect was\r\nstrongest in its power of perception. Talbot drove himself half mad\r\nwith imagining what _might be;_ John saw what _was;_ and he saw, or\r\nfancied he saw, that the woman he loved was worthy of all love; and he\r\ngave his peace and honour freely into her keeping.\r\n\r\nHe had his reward. He had his reward in her frank womanly affection,\r\nand in the delight of seeing that she was happy; no cloud upon her\r\nface, no shadow on her life, but ever-beaming joy in her eyes,\r\never-changing smiles upon her lips. She was happy in the calm security\r\nof her home, happy in that pleasant stronghold in which she was so\r\nfenced about and guarded by love and devotion. I do not know that she\r\never felt any romantic or enthusiastic love for this big Yorkshireman;\r\nbut I do know that from the first hour in which she laid her head upon\r\nhis broad breast she was true to him--true as a wife should be; true\r\nin every thought; true in the merest shadow of a thought. A wide gulf\r\nyawned around the altar of her home, separating her from every other\r\nman in the universe, and leaving her alone with that one man whom she\r\nhad accepted as her husband. She had accepted him in the truest and\r\npurest sense of the word. She had accepted him from the hand of God, as\r\nthe protector and shelterer of her life; and morning and night, upon\r\nher knees, she thanked the gracious Creator who had made this man for\r\nher help-meet.\r\n\r\nBut after duly setting down all this, I have to confess that poor\r\nJohn Mellish was cruelly hen-pecked. Such big, blustering fellows are\r\ncreated to be the much-enduring subjects of petticoat government; and\r\nthey carry the rosy garlands until their dying hour with a sublime\r\nunconsciousness that those floral chains are not very easy to be\r\nbroken. Your little man is self-assertive, and for ever on his guard\r\nagainst womanly domination. All tyrannical husbands on record have\r\nbeen little men, from Mr. Daniel Quilp upwards; but who could ever\r\nconvince a fellow of six foot two in his stockings that he was afraid\r\nof his wife? He submits to the pretty tyrant with a quiet smile of\r\nresignation. What does it matter? She is so little, so fragile; he\r\ncould break that tiny wrist with one twist of his big thumb and finger;\r\nand in the mean time, till affairs get desperate, and such measures\r\nbecome necessary, it\'s as well to let her have her own way.\r\n\r\nJohn Mellish did not even debate the point. He loved her, and he laid\r\nhimself down to be trampled upon by her gracious feet. Whatever she\r\ndid or said was charming, bewitching, and wonderful to him. If she\r\nridiculed and laughed at him, her laughter was the sweetest harmony in\r\ncreation; and it pleased him to think that his absurdities could give\r\nbirth to such music. If she lectured him, she arose to the sublimity\r\nof a priestess, and he listened to her and worshipped her as the most\r\nnoble of living creatures. And with all this, his innate manliness of\r\ncharacter preserved him from any taint of that quality our _argot_\r\nhas christened _spooneyism_. It was only those who knew him well and\r\nwatched him closely who could fathom the full depths of his tender\r\nweakness. The noblest sentiments approach most nearly to the universal,\r\nand this love of John\'s was in a manner universal. It was the love\r\nof husband, father, mother, brother, melted into one comprehensive\r\naffection. He had a mother\'s weak pride in Aurora, a mother\'s foolish\r\nvanity in the wonderful creature, the _rara avis_ he had won from her\r\nnest to be his wife. If Mrs. Mellish was complimented while John stood\r\nby, he simpered like a school-girl who blushes at a handsome man\'s\r\nfirst flatteries. I\'m afraid he bored his male acquaintance about "my\r\nwife:" her marvellous leap over the bullfinch; the plan she drew for\r\nthe new stables, "which the architect said was a better plan than he\r\ncould have drawn himself, sir, by Gad" (a clever man, that Doncaster\r\narchitect); the surprising way in which she had discovered the fault\r\nin the chestnut colt\'s off fore-leg; the pencil sketch she had made\r\nof her dog Bow-wow ("Sir Edwin Landseer might have been proud of such\r\nspirit and dash, sir"). All these things did the county gentlemen hear,\r\nuntil, perhaps, they grew a shade weary of John\'s talk of "my wife."\r\nBut they were never weary of Aurora herself. She took her place at once\r\namong them; and they bowed down to her and worshipped her, envying John\r\nMellish the ownership of such a high-bred filly, as I fear they were\r\nbut likely, unconsciously, to designate my black-eyed heroine.\r\n\r\nThe domain over which Aurora found herself empress was no\r\ninconsiderable one. John Mellish had inherited an estate which brought\r\nhim an income of something between sixteen and seventeen thousand a\r\nyear. Far-away farms, upon wide Yorkshire wolds and fenny Lincolnshire\r\nflats, owned him master; and the intricate secrets of his possessions\r\nwere scarcely known to himself,--known, perhaps, to none but his\r\nland-steward and solicitor, a grave gentleman who lived in Doncaster,\r\nand drove about once a fortnight down to Mellish Park, much to the\r\nhorror of its light-hearted master, to whom "business" was a terrible\r\nbugbear. Not that I would have the reader for a moment imagine John\r\nMellish an empty-headed blockhead, with no comprehension save for his\r\nown daily pleasures. He was not a reading man, nor a business man,\r\nnor a politician, nor a student of the natural sciences. There was an\r\nobservatory in the Park; but John had fitted it up as a smoking-room,\r\nthe revolving openings in the roof being very convenient for letting\r\nout the effluvia of his guests\' cheroots and Havanas; Mr. Mellish\r\ncaring for the stars very much after the fashion of that Assyrian\r\nmonarch who was content to see them shine, and thank their Maker for\r\ntheir beauty. He was not a spiritualist; and unless one of the tables\r\nat Mellish could have given him "a tip" for the "Sellinger," or Great\r\nEbor, he would have cared very little if every inch of walnut and\r\nrosewood in his house had grown oracular. But for all this he was no\r\nfool; he had that brightly clear intellect which very often accompanies\r\nperfect honesty of purpose, and which is the very intellect of all\r\nothers most successful in the discomfiture of all knavery. He was not\r\na creature to despise, for his very weaknesses were manly. Perhaps\r\nAurora felt this, and that it was something to rule over such a man.\r\nSometimes, in an outburst of loving gratitude, she would nestle her\r\nhandsome head upon his breast,--tall as she was, she was only tall\r\nenough to take shelter under his wing,--and tell him that he was the\r\ndearest and the best of men, and that, although she might love him to\r\nher dying day, she could never, _never_, NEVER love him half as much as\r\nhe deserved. After which, half ashamed of herself for the sentimental\r\ndeclaration, she would alternately ridicule, lecture, and tyrannize\r\nover him for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nLucy beheld this state of things with silent bewilderment. Could the\r\nwoman who had once been loved by Talbot Bulstrode sink to _this?_ The\r\nhappy wife of a fair-haired Yorkshireman; with her fondest wishes\r\nconcentred in her namesake the bay filly, which was to run in a\r\nweight-for-age race at the York Spring, and was entered for the ensuing\r\nDerby; interested in a tan gallop, a new stable; talking of mysterious\r\nbut evidently all-important creatures, called by such names as Scott\r\nand Fobert and Chiffney and Challoner; and to all appearance utterly\r\nforgetful of the fact that there existed upon the earth a divinity with\r\nfathomless gray eyes, known to mortals as the heir of Bulstrode. Poor\r\nLucy was like to have been driven well-nigh demented by the talk about\r\nthis bay filly, Aurora, as the Spring Meeting drew near. She was taken\r\nto see her every morning by Aurora and John, who, in their anxiety for\r\nthe improvement of their favourite, looked at the animal upon each\r\nvisit as if they expected some wonderful physical transformation to\r\nhave occurred in the stillness of the night. The loose box in which\r\nthe filly was lodged was watched night and day by an amateur detective\r\nforce of stable-boys and hangers-on; and John Mellish once went so far\r\nas to dip a tumbler into the pail of water provided for the bay filly,\r\nAurora, to ascertain, of his own experience, that the crystal fluid\r\nwas innocuous; for he grew nervous as the eventful day drew nigh, and\r\nwas afraid of lurking danger to the filly from dark-minded touts who\r\nmight have heard of her in London. I fear the touts troubled their\r\nheads very little about this graceful two-year old, though she had\r\nthe blood of Old Melbourne and West Australian in her veins, to say\r\nnothing of other aristocracy upon the maternal side. The suspicious\r\ngentlemen hanging about York and Doncaster in those early April days\r\nwere a great deal too much occupied with Lord Glasgow\'s lot, and John\r\nScott\'s lot, and Lord Zetland\'s and Mr. Merry\'s lot, and other lots of\r\nequal distinction, to have much time to prowl about Mellish Park, or\r\npeer into that meadow which the young man had caused to be surrounded\r\nby an eight-foot fence for the privacy of the Derby winner _in futuro._\r\nLucy declared the filly to be the loveliest of creatures, and safe to\r\nwin any number of cups and plates that might be offered for equine\r\ncompetition; but she was always glad, when the daily visit was over,\r\nto find herself safely out of reach of those high-bred hind-legs,\r\nwhich seemed to possess a faculty for being in all four corners of the\r\nloose-box at one and the same moment.\r\n\r\nThe first day of the Meeting came, and found half the Mellish\r\nhousehold established at York: John and his family at an hotel near\r\nthe betting-rooms; and the trainer, his satellites, and the filly,\r\nat a little inn close to the Knavesmire. Archibald Floyd did his\r\nbest to be interested in the event which was so interesting to his\r\nchildren; but he freely confessed to his grandniece, Lucy, that he\r\nheartily wished the Meeting over, and the merits of the bay filly\r\ndecided. She had stood her trial nobly, John said; not winning with\r\na rush, it is true; in point of fact, being in a manner beaten; but\r\nevincing a power to _stay_, which promised better for the future than\r\nany two-year-old velocity. When the saddling-bell rang, Aurora, her\r\nfather, and Lucy were stationed in the balcony, a crowd of friends\r\nabout them; Mrs. Mellish, with a pencil in her hand, putting down\r\nall manner of impossible bets in her excitement, and making such a\r\nbook as might have been preserved as a curiosity in sporting annals.\r\nJohn was pushing in and out of the ring below; tumbling over small\r\nbook-men in his agitation; dashing from the ring to the weighing-house;\r\nand hanging about the small pale-faced boy who was to ride the filly\r\nas anxiously as if the jockey had been a prime minister, and John a\r\nfamily-man with half a dozen sons in need of Government appointments.\r\nI tremble to think how many bonuses, in the way of five-pound notes,\r\nJohn promised this pale-faced lad, on condition that the stakes (some\r\nsmall matter amounting to about sixty pounds) were pulled off--pulled\r\noff where, I wonder?--by the bay filly Aurora. If the youth had\r\nnot been of that preternatural order of beings who seem born of an\r\nemotionless character to wear silk for the good of their fellow-men,\r\nhis brain must certainly have been dazed by the variety of conflicting\r\ndirections which John Mellish gave him within the critical last quarter\r\nof an hour; but having received his orders early that morning from\r\nthe trainer, accompanied with a warning not to suffer himself to be\r\n_tewed_ (Yorkshire _patois_ for worried) by anything Mr. Mellish might\r\nsay, the sallow-complexioned lad walked about in the calm serenity of\r\ninnocence,--there are honest jockeys in the world,--and took his seat\r\nin the saddle with as even a pulse as if he had been about to ride in\r\nan omnibus.\r\n\r\nThere were some people upon the Stand that morning who thought the\r\nface of Aurora Mellish as pleasant a sight as the smooth greensward\r\nof the Knavesmire, or the best horse-flesh in the county of York. All\r\nforgetful of herself in her excitement, with her natural vivacity\r\nmultiplied by the animation of the scene before her, she was more\r\nthan usually lovely; and Archibald Floyd looked at her with a fond\r\nemotion, so intermingled with gratitude to Heaven for the happiness of\r\nhis daughter\'s destiny as to be almost akin to pain. She was happy;\r\nshe was thoroughly happy at last, this child of his dead Eliza, this\r\nsacred charge left to him by the woman he had loved; she was happy, and\r\nshe was _safe;_ he could go to his grave resignedly to-morrow, if it\r\npleased God,--knowing this. Strange thoughts, perhaps, for a crowded\r\nrace-course; but our most solemn fancies do not come always in solemn\r\nplaces. Nay, it is often in the midst of crowds and confusion that\r\nour souls wing their loftiest flights, and the saddest memories return\r\nto us. You see a man sitting at some theatrical entertainment, with a\r\ngrave, abstracted face, over which no change of those around him has\r\nany influence. He may be thinking of his dead wife, dead ten years\r\nago; he may be acting over well-remembered scenes of joy and sorrow;\r\nhe may be recalling cruel words, never to be atoned for upon earth,\r\nangry looks gone to be registered against him in the skies; while his\r\nchildren are laughing at the clown on the stage below him. He may\r\nbe moodily meditating inevitable bankruptcy or coming ruin, holding\r\nimaginary meetings with his creditors, and contemplating prussic\r\nacid upon the refusal of his certificate, while his eldest daughter\r\nis crying with Pauline Deschappelles. So Archibald Floyd, while the\r\nnumbers were going up, and the jockeys being weighed, and the book-men\r\nclamouring below him, leaned over the broad ledge of the stone balcony,\r\nand, looking far away across the grassy amphitheatre, thought of the\r\ndead wife who had bequeathed to him this precious daughter.\r\n\r\nThe bay filly, Aurora, was beaten ignominiously. Mrs. Mellish turned\r\nwhite with despair as she saw the amber jacket, black belt, and\r\nblue cap crawling in at the heels of the ruck, the jockey looking\r\npale defiance at the bystanders: as who should say that the filly\r\nhad never been meant to win, and that the defeat of to-day was but\r\nan artfully-concocted _ruse_ whereby fortunes were to be made in the\r\nfuture? John Mellish, something used to such disappointments, crept\r\naway to hide his discomfiture outside the ring; but Aurora dropped her\r\ncard and pencil, and, stamping her foot upon the stone flooring of the\r\nbalcony, told Lucy and the banker that it was a shame, and that the boy\r\nmust have sold the race, as it was _impossible_ the filly could have\r\nbeen fairly beaten. As she turned to say this, her cheeks flushed with\r\npassion, and her eyes flashing bright indignation on any one who might\r\nstand in the way to receive the angry electric light, she became aware\r\nof a pale face and a pair of gray eyes earnestly regarding her from\r\nthe threshold of an open window two or three paces off; and in another\r\nmoment both she and her father had recognized Talbot Bulstrode.\r\n\r\nThe young man saw that he was recognized, and approached them, hat in\r\nhand,--very, very pale, as Lucy always remembered,--and, with a voice\r\nthat trembled as he spoke, wished the banker and the two ladies "Good\r\nday."\r\n\r\nAnd it was thus that they met, these two who had "parted in silence and\r\ntears," more than "half broken-hearted," to sever, as they thought,\r\nfor eternity; it was thus--upon this commonplace, prosaic, half-guinea\r\nGrand Stand--that Destiny brought them once more face to face.\r\n\r\nA year ago, and how often in the spring twilight Aurora Floyd had\r\npictured her possible meeting with Talbot Bulstrode! He would come upon\r\nher suddenly, perhaps, in the still moonlight, and she would swoon away\r\nand die at his feet of the unendurable emotion. Or they would meet in\r\nsome crowded assembly; she dancing, laughing with hollow, simulated\r\nmirth; and the shock of one glance of those eyes would slay her in\r\nher painted glory of jewels and grandeur. How often, ah, how often\r\nshe had acted the scene and felt the anguish!--only a year ago, less\r\nthan a year ago, ay, even so lately as on that balmy September day\r\nwhen she had lain on the rustic couch at the Ch\xe2teau d\'Arques, looking\r\ndown at the fair Normandy landscape, with faithful John at watch by\r\nher side, the tame goats browsing upon the grassy platform behind\r\nher, and preternaturally ancient French children teasing the mild,\r\nlong-suffering animals. And to-day she met him with her thoughts so\r\nfull of the horse which had just been beaten, that she scarcely knew\r\nwhat she said to her sometime lover. Aurora Floyd was dead and buried,\r\nand Aurora Mellish, looking critically at Talbot Bulstrode, wondered\r\nhow any one could have ever gone near to the gates of death for the\r\nlove of him.\r\n\r\nIt was Talbot who grew pale at this unlooked-for encounter; it was\r\nTalbot whose voice was shaken in the utterance of those few every-day\r\nsyllables which common courtesy demanded of him. The captain had not\r\nso easily learned to forget. He was older than Aurora, and he had\r\nreached the age of two-and-thirty without having ever loved woman,\r\nonly to be the more desperately attacked by the fatal disease when\r\nhis time came. He suffered acutely at that sudden meeting. Wounded in\r\nhis pride by her serene indifference, dazzled afresh by her beauty,\r\nmad with jealous fury at the thought that he had lost her, Captain\r\nBulstrode\'s feelings were of no very enviable nature; and if Aurora had\r\never wished to avenge that cruel scene at Felden Woods, her hour of\r\nvengeance had most certainly come. But she was too generous a creature\r\nto have harboured such a thought. She had submitted in all humility to\r\nTalbot\'s decree; she had accepted his decision, and had believed in\r\nits justice; and seeing his agitation to-day, she was sorry for him.\r\nShe pitied him, with a tender, matronly compassion; such as she, in\r\nthe safe harbour of a happy home, might be privileged to feel for this\r\npoor wanderer, still at sea on life\'s troubled ocean. Love, and the\r\nmemory of love, must indeed have died before we can feel like this. The\r\nterrible passion must have died that slow and certain death, from the\r\ngrave of which no haunting ghost ever returns to torment the survivors.\r\nIt was, and it is not. Aurora might have been shipwrecked and cast on\r\na desert island with Talbot Bulstrode, and might have lived ten years\r\nin his company, without ever feeling for ten seconds as she had felt\r\nfor him once. With these impetuous and impressionable people, who live\r\nquickly, a year is sometimes as twenty years; so Aurora looked back at\r\nTalbot Bulstrode across a gulf which stretched for weary miles between\r\nthem, and wondered if they had really ever stood side by side, allied\r\nby Hope and Love, in the days that were gone.\r\n\r\nWhile Aurora was thinking of these things, as well as a little of\r\nthe bay filly, and while Talbot, half choked by a thousand confused\r\nemotions, tried to appear preternaturally at his ease, John Mellish,\r\nhaving refreshed his spirits with bottled beer, came suddenly upon the\r\nparty, and slapped the captain on the back.\r\n\r\n_He_ was not jealous, this happy John. Secure in his wife\'s love and\r\ntruth, he was ready to face a regiment of her old admirers; indeed,\r\nhe rather delighted in the idea of avenging Aurora upon this cowardly\r\nlover. Talbot glanced involuntarily at the members of the York\r\nconstabulary on the course below; wondering how they would act if he\r\nwere to fling John Mellish over the stone balcony, and do a murder then\r\nand there. He was thinking this while John was nearly wringing off his\r\nhand in cordial salutation, and asking what the deuce had brought him\r\nto the York Spring.\r\n\r\nTalbot explained rather lamely that, being knocked up by his\r\nParliamentary work, he had come down to spend a few days with an old\r\nbrother-officer, Captain Hunter, who had a place between York and Leeds.\r\n\r\nMr. Mellish declared that nothing could be more lucky than this. He\r\nknew Hunter well; the two men must join them at dinner that day; and\r\nTalbot must give them a week at the Park after he left the captain\'s\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nTalbot murmured some vague protestation of the impossibility of this,\r\nto which John paid no attention whatever, hustling his sometime rival\r\naway from the ladies in his eagerness to get back to the ring, where he\r\nhad to complete his book for the next race.\r\n\r\nSo Captain Bulstrode was gone once more, and throughout the brief\r\ninterview no one had cared to notice Lucy Floyd, who had been pale and\r\nred by turns half a dozen times within the last ten minutes.\r\n\r\nJohn and Talbot returned after the start, with Captain Hunter, who was\r\nbrought on to the stand to be presented to Aurora, and who immediately\r\nentered into a very animated discussion upon the day\'s racing. How\r\nCaptain Bulstrode abhorred this idle babble of horse-flesh; this\r\nperpetual jargon, alike in every mouth--from Aurora\'s rosy Cupid\'s bow\r\nto the tobacco-tainted lips of the book-men in the ring! Thank Heaven,\r\nthis was not _his_ wife who knew all the slang of the course, and, with\r\n_lorgnette_ in hand, was craning her swan-like throat to catch sight of\r\na bend in the Knavesmire and the horse that had a lead of half a mile.\r\n\r\nWhy had he ever consented to come into this accursed horse-racing\r\ncounty? Why had he deserted the Cornish miners, even for a week? Better\r\nto be wearing out his brains over Dryasdust pamphlets and Parliamentary\r\nminutes than to be here; desolate amongst this shallow-minded,\r\nclamorous multitude, who have nothing to do but to throw up caps and\r\ncry huzza for any winner of any race. Talbot, as a bystander, could\r\nnot but remark this, and draw from this something of a philosophical\r\nlesson on life. He saw that there was always the same clamour and the\r\nsame rejoicing in the crowd, whether the winning jockey wore blue and\r\nblack belt, yellow and black cap, white with scarlet spots, or any\r\nother variety of colour, even to dismal sable; and he could but wonder\r\nhow this was. Did the unlucky speculators run away and hide themselves\r\nwhile the uplifted voices were rejoicing? When the welkin was rent with\r\nthe name of Caractacus or Tim Whiffler, where were the men who had\r\nbacked Buckstone or the Marquis unflinchingly up to the dropping of the\r\nflag and the ringing of the bell? When Thormanby came in with a rush,\r\nwhere were the wretched creatures whose fortunes hung on "the Yankee"\r\nor Wizard? They were voiceless, these poor unlucky ones, crawling\r\naway with sick white faces to gather in groups, and explain to each\r\nother, with stable jargon intermingled with oaths, how the victory\r\njust over ought not to have been, and never could have been, but for\r\nsome un-looked-for and preposterous combination of events never before\r\nwitnessed upon any mortal course. How little is ever seen of the losers\r\nin any of the great races run upon this earth! For years and years the\r\nname of Louis Napoleon is an empty sound, signifying nothing; when,\r\nlo, a few master strokes of policy and _finesse_, a little juggling\r\nwith those pieces of pasteboard out of which are built the shaky\r\ncard-palaces men call empires, and creation rings with the same name;\r\nthe outsider emerges from the ruck, and the purple jacket spotted with\r\ngolden bees is foremost in the mighty race.\r\n\r\nTalbot Bulstrode leaned with folded arms upon the stone balustrade,\r\nlooking down at the busy life below him, and thinking of these things.\r\nPardon him for his indulgence in dreary platitudes and worn-out\r\nsentimentalities. He was a desolate, purposeless man; entered for\r\nno race himself; scratched for the matrimonial stakes; embittered\r\nby disappointment; soured by doubt and suspicion. He had spent the\r\ndull winter months upon the Continent, having no mind to go down to\r\nBulstrode to encounter his mother\'s sympathy and his cousin Constance\r\nTrevyllian\'s chatter. He was unjust enough to nourish a secret dislike\r\nto that young lady for the good service she had done him by revealing\r\nAurora\'s flight.\r\n\r\nAre we ever really grateful to the people who tell us of the iniquity\r\nof those we love? Are we ever really just to the kindly creatures who\r\ngive us friendly warning of our danger? No, never! We hate them; always\r\ninvoluntarily reverting to them as the first causes of our anguish;\r\nalways repeating to ourselves that, had they been silent, that anguish\r\nneed never have been; always ready to burst forth in our wild rage with\r\nthe mad cry, that "it is better to be much abused than but to know\'t a\r\nlittle." When the friendly Ancient drops his poisoned hints into poor\r\nOthello\'s ear, it is not Mistress Desdemona, but Iago himself, whom\r\nthe noble Moor first has a mind to strangle. If poor innocent Constance\r\nTrevyllian had been born the veriest cur in the county of Cornwall, she\r\nwould have had a better chance of winning Talbot\'s regard than she had\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nWhy had he come into Yorkshire? I left that question unanswered just\r\nnow, for I am ashamed to tell the reasons which actuated this unhappy\r\nman. He came, in a paroxysm of curiosity, to learn what kind of life\r\nAurora led with her husband, John Mellish. He had suffered horrible\r\ndistractions of mind upon this subject; one moment imagining her the\r\nmost despicable of coquettes, ready to marry any man who had a fair\r\nestate and a good position to offer her, and by-and-by depicting her\r\nas some white-robed Iphigenia, led a passive victim to the sacrificial\r\nshrine. So, when happening to meet his goodnatured brother-officer\r\nat the United Service Club, he had consented to run down to Captain\r\nHunter\'s country place, for a brief respite from Parliamentary minutes\r\nand red-tape, the artful hypocrite had never owned to himself that he\r\nwas burning to hear tidings of his false and fickle love, and that it\r\nwas some lingering fumes of the old intoxication that carried him down\r\nto Yorkshire. But now, now that he met her--met her, the heartless,\r\nabominable creature, radiant and happy--mere simulated happiness and\r\nfeverish mock radiance, no doubt, but too well put on to be quite\r\npleasing to him,--_now he knew her._ He knew her at last, the wicked\r\nenchantress, the soulless siren. He knew that she had never loved\r\nhim; that she was of course powerless to love; good for nothing but\r\nto wreath her white arms and flash the dark splendour of her eyes for\r\nweak man\'s destruction; fit for nothing but to float in her beauty\r\nabove the waves that concealed the bleached bones of her victims. Poor\r\nJohn Mellish! Talbot reproached himself for his hardness of heart in\r\nnourishing one spiteful feeling towards a man who was so deeply to be\r\npitied.\r\n\r\nWhen the race was done, Captain Bulstrode turned, and beheld the\r\nblack-eyed sorceress in the midst of a group gathered about a grave\r\nPatriarch with gray hair and the look of one accustomed to command.\r\n\r\nThis grave Patriarch was John Pastern.\r\n\r\nI write his name with respect, even as it was reverentially whispered\r\nthere, till, travelling from lip to lip, every one present knew that\r\na great man was amongst them. A very quiet, unassuming veteran,\r\nsitting with his womankind about him,--his wife and daughter, as I\r\nthink,--self-possessed and grave, while men were busy with his name in\r\nthe crowd below, and while tens of thousands were staked in trusting\r\ndependence on his acumen. What golden syllables might have fallen from\r\nthose oracular lips, had the veteran been so pleased! What hundreds\r\nwould have been freely bidden for a word, a look, a nod, a wink, a mere\r\nsignificant pursing-up of the lips from that great man! What is the\r\nfable of the young lady who discoursed pearls and diamonds to a truth\r\nsuch as this? Pearls and diamonds must be of large size which would\r\nbe worth the secrets of those Richmond stables, the secrets which Mr.\r\nPastern might tell if he chose. Perhaps it is the knowledge of this\r\nwhich gives him a calm, almost clerical, gravity of manner. People\r\ncome to him and fawn upon him, and tell him that such and such a horse\r\nfrom his stable has won, or looks safe to win; and he nods pleasantly,\r\nthanking them for the kind information; while perhaps his thoughts are\r\nfar away on Epsom Downs or Newmarket Heath, winning future Derbys and\r\nTwo Thousands with colts that are as yet unfoaled.\r\n\r\nJohn Mellish is on intimate terms with the great man, to whom he\r\npresents Aurora, and of whom he asks advice upon a matter that has been\r\ntroubling him for some time. His trainer\'s health is failing him, and\r\nhe wants assistance in the stables; a younger man, honest and clever.\r\nDoes Mr. Pastern know such a one?\r\n\r\nThe veteran tells him, after due consideration, that he does know of\r\na young man; honest, he believes, as times go, who was once employed\r\nin the Richmond stables, and who had written to him only a few days\r\nbefore, asking for his influence in getting him a situation. "But the\r\nlad\'s name has slipped my memory," added Mr. Pastern; "he was but a lad\r\nwhen he was with me; but, bless my soul, that\'s ten years ago! I\'ll\r\nlook up his letter, when I go home, and write to you about him. I know\r\nhe\'s clever, and I believe he\'s honest; and I shall be only too happy,"\r\nconcluded the old gentleman, gallantly, "to do anything to oblige Mrs.\r\nMellish."\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org \r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary \r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
